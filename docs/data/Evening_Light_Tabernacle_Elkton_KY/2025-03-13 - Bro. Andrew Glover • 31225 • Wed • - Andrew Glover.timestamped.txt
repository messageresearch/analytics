[41:48] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[41:52] from on high until you be endued with
[41:56] power from on high now in the book of 1
[41:59] Timothy chapter 3 I want to read a verse
[42:01] there in 1 Timothy chapter 3 I want to
[42:05] read in the 15th verse 1 Timothy 3 just
[42:09] one verse there amen 1 Timothy 3 in
[42:13] verse 15 the Bible here says Paul
[42:16] writing to Timothy he says but if I T
[42:19] long that thou mayest know how thou
[42:22] oughtest to behave thyself in the house
[42:25] of God I want you to notice what he says
[42:27] here which is the Church of the Living
[42:31] God is the pillar and ground of the
[42:34] truth amen which is the Church of the
[42:38] Living God the pillar and ground of the
[42:41] truth amen we ask the Lord this evening
[42:43] to add the blessing to the reading of
[42:45] his word as you can have your seats here
[42:47] this afternoon I want to uh by the help
[42:49] of the Lord for just a few moments
[42:50] tonight if I would uh take a title here
[42:53] tonight I want to speak to you on this
[42:55] the powerful Church of the Living God
[42:58] Amen the powerful Church of the Living
[43:00] God in 1957 brother BR preaches a sermon
[43:04] what does it take to make a Christian
[43:06] Life he says now if the Church of the
[43:08] Living God which is the pillar of the
[43:11] truth so here a prophet identifies amen
[43:14] that the Church of the Living God is the
[43:16] Pillar of Truth he said now God intended
[43:19] this church to be a powerful church this
[43:22] is what God intended to be a powerful
[43:24] Church a glorious church amen a church
[43:27] that the whole world could look upon as
[43:30] a bride of Christ well expected and
[43:33] espoused and to live in such an
[43:35] atmosphere and conduct itself in such a
[43:38] way that God would be proud of this
[43:40] church to present it to Christ at the
[43:43] coming of the Lord it should live in
[43:45] that characteristic in the church and it
[43:48] should be living that way so God has
[43:51] intentions for his church and it's not
[43:53] to be a powerless formal lukor church
[43:56] but it is to be a powerful Church it is
[43:59] to be a church amen that is displaying
[44:01] the characteristic of Jesus Christ tying
[44:04] spe 1955 he says I am positive sure this
[44:08] morning that if men and women could only
[44:11] get into the position of where their
[44:13] soul and their thinking and their
[44:15] attitudes would be perfect in the sight
[44:17] of God he said that would be one of the
[44:20] most powerful churches amen that ever
[44:22] existed so what is going to produce amen
[44:25] a powerful Church is when the soul amen
[44:28] the thinking and the attitude amen comes
[44:31] into the image that God has designed for
[44:33] it to be in amen that will be one of the
[44:36] most powerful churches amen that ever
[44:38] existed now uh just to read a couple
[44:41] translations there of St Luke 24 verse
[44:43] 49 if that's okay in the Amplified Bible
[44:46] it says listen carefully I am sending
[44:49] the promise of my father the Holy Spirit
[44:52] upon you but you are to remain in the
[44:54] city amen of Jerusalem until you are
[44:58] clothed fully anden and equipped with
[45:01] power from on high in the emphatic
[45:03] diaglot Luke 2449 says and behold I send
[45:07] forth the promise of my father upon you
[45:10] amen but remain you in the city amen
[45:13] till you are invested with power from on
[45:16] high amen so whatever God was sending
[45:19] amen from on high was going to equip the
[45:22] church it was going to dress the church
[45:24] and it was also going to invest are
[45:27] going to empower the church now when you
[45:29] look there at that word power actually
[45:31] the Greek word there is dunamus which is
[45:33] where we get the word Dynamite from and
[45:36] it means an inherit power it means a
[45:39] power residing In A Thing by virtue of
[45:41] its nature or which a person or thing
[45:44] exerts and puts forth it is power for
[45:47] performing Miracles it is moral power
[45:50] and Excellence of Soul it is the power
[45:52] and influence which belong to riches and
[45:55] wealth it is power and resources arising
[45:58] from numbers amen it is power consisting
[46:01] in amen or resting upon armies forces
[46:05] and host now I'll just say this Joel
[46:08] prophesied that in the last days there
[46:10] would be a great Army in the church
[46:12] right I believe tonight that that great
[46:14] Army is not coming neither do I believe
[46:17] it has been here amen but I believe I am
[46:20] looking at the great Army that Joel
[46:22] prophesied amen that would be a part of
[46:24] the Restoration in the hour that we're
[46:27] living in that's why Jesus would say
[46:29] behold I amen send the promise of my
[46:32] father upon you how many knows that if
[46:35] God sends a man he goes in the man if
[46:38] God sends you amen he goes in you look
[46:41] at this word send it means to order one
[46:44] Amen to go to a place appointed that he
[46:47] may be in a state of liberty now you
[46:50] know that Luke 24 was a prophecy amen
[46:53] that God would send the Holy Ghost in
[46:55] Acts 1: eight it says but you shall amen
[46:59] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[47:02] amen is come upon you and you shall be
[47:04] Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in
[47:07] all Judea and in Samaria and to the
[47:10] uttermost parts of the earth now I'll
[47:12] just say this amen if we know what the
[47:15] Holy Ghost is amen then we know what the
[47:18] Holy Ghost is not and I'll say this the
[47:20] Holy Ghost according to a prophet amen
[47:23] is the spirit of Jesus Christ in you am
[47:27] then the Holy Ghost is the power of God
[47:30] he said see the Holy Ghost is the power
[47:33] of God that has sent you into the heart
[47:35] as a witness of the spirit you have been
[47:38] born again your life is cleaned up the
[47:40] world is dead and all the stink of it is
[47:43] like the garic and Egypt seeed you're
[47:46] far away from it you're a new creature
[47:48] amen in Christ Jesus how many's a new
[47:51] creature amen in Christ Jesus old things
[47:54] has passed away and you become new all
[47:57] together you are a new creation you are
[48:00] born amen of the spirit of God see your
[48:03] whole members of your body is submissive
[48:06] to his spirit and you are moving in the
[48:08] Holy Ghost you are not listening to the
[48:11] sound of the world Amen your eyes are on
[48:14] Heavenly things listen folks the Holy
[48:17] Ghost did not come amen from the church
[48:20] amen it did not come from the bishop it
[48:22] did not come from the pope of the Roman
[48:24] church amen but the Holy Ghost descend
[48:26] Ed amen from God out of Heaven Amen to
[48:30] do one thing that is to turn your eyes
[48:33] from the things below and to cause you
[48:35] to look into the heels amen from when
[48:38] cometh your salvation the Holy Ghost is
[48:40] not power from the bishop amen the Holy
[48:43] Ghost is not power from the Pope the
[48:45] Holy Ghost is power from on high amen
[48:48] I'll say this the Holy Ghost is not a
[48:50] handshake amen the Holy Ghost is not a
[48:52] membership L amen it's the gift of God
[48:56] Amen with power from on high Amen to
[48:59] demonstrate to the people that God is
[49:01] not in a tomb in Jerusalem neither is he
[49:04] in a grave in Jeffersonville but he is
[49:07] right here in this building tonight amen
[49:10] veiled in human flesh by the baptism of
[49:12] the Holy Ghost I'll say what a prophet
[49:15] said he said the holy spirit is an
[49:17] experience amen of being filled and
[49:20] indued with power for
[49:23] service now come on folks amen the Holy
[49:26] Ghost just not just here making us shout
[49:28] it's not just here making us dance not
[49:31] just here making us speak in tongues but
[49:33] the Holy Ghost is here amen that God
[49:36] might have a vessel amen that he could
[49:38] do a service through amen if we have a
[49:41] true experience it is by true power
[49:44] brother said listen the true word comes
[49:45] to the true prophet and he tells you the
[49:48] true word amen and you follow that true
[49:50] word and you get a true experience of
[49:54] the word see because the word is made
[49:57] flesh in you and you become God's son
[50:00] and the word of God is revolving right
[50:03] out of God Amen into you see because you
[50:06] are his nature amen his spirit is in you
[50:10] and you will do the works of God Amen
[50:14] the Bible said so amen so God then is
[50:16] under obligation Amen to give every
[50:19] believer the Holy Ghost amen he said it
[50:22] like this he said see he's more willing
[50:24] to give it to you amen then you are to
[50:27] receive it see amen for God is under
[50:30] obligation Amen to keep his word how
[50:33] many knows that the Bible said amen to
[50:36] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[50:38] Jesus Christ amen and repent of your
[50:40] sins now watch and you shall amen
[50:43] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen
[50:45] it's very amazing to me amen that a
[50:48] repentance amen actually proceeds a
[50:51] receiving amen you didn't receive it and
[50:53] then repent amen but when you repented
[50:56] you receive the Holy Ghost brother B
[50:58] said a man cannot lay in the presence of
[51:01] God and a church cannot stay in the
[51:03] presence of God Amen under repentance
[51:06] unless the Holy Spirit comes down amen
[51:09] and gives unction and power Amen to
[51:11] start a move of God in there amen among
[51:14] those people listen folks when you begin
[51:17] to repent amen God begins to refresh
[51:21] amen when we begin to say Lord I've been
[51:23] wrong I'm sorry but I'm asking for your
[51:26] mercy mercy and your grace Amen to wash
[51:29] me and to cleanse me amen and to
[51:31] separate me as a Sanctified vessel amen
[51:34] I'm not here just to be a church member
[51:36] I'm not here just to see amen how much I
[51:39] can learn amen but I am here to do the
[51:42] Greater Works amen I am here Amen to
[51:45] manifest The Works of my father in which
[51:47] I have come from amen I know I'll say
[51:50] this the devil hates the preaching of
[51:52] the Gospel of repentance you know why
[51:55] Satan hates repentance preach
[51:57] is because when you begin to repent amen
[52:00] God begins to fill amen you with the
[52:03] power Amen to tear the devil's Kingdom
[52:06] down amen do you realize there were two
[52:09] preachers in the Bible Tommy they were
[52:11] gotten after for preaching something it
[52:13] was the Apostle Paul and it was John the
[52:16] Baptist you know they were actually
[52:17] seeking to kill those men you know why
[52:20] because the devil knew amen if the
[52:22] people got a hold of what they were
[52:24] preaching about amen they were going to
[52:26] going to tear his kingdom down listen
[52:29] folks amen the devil wants to stop amen
[52:32] a true repentance because the prophet
[52:34] said when you thoroughly repent and you
[52:36] believe on the Lord and are baptized in
[52:39] the name of Jesus Christ amen you make
[52:42] God a liar if you don't receive the Holy
[52:45] Ghost how many knows the Bible said that
[52:48] God is not a liar amen and neither is he
[52:51] the son of man amen that he should
[52:53] repent I want to propose to you tonight
[52:56] amen that if you get the Holy Ghost
[52:58] it'll be the greatest gift you ever
[53:00] receive if you ever get the baptism of
[53:03] the Holy Ghost in your soul it'll do
[53:05] more for you than alcohol it'll do more
[53:07] for you than drugs it'll do more for you
[53:10] than a cigarette amen when you receive
[53:12] the person of Jesus Christ in the depths
[53:15] of your soul you're not just sealed from
[53:17] one good meeting to another you are
[53:19] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[53:22] listen when the Seal of God comes upon
[53:25] the soul of a believer amen God is
[53:27] sealed in and the devil is sealed out
[53:31] well glory to God hallelujah I think
[53:34] it's time to reach the Holy Ghost again
[53:36] I think it's time to preach the power of
[53:38] the Holy Ghost in our churches I think
[53:40] it's time to preach it to our young
[53:42] people you got to have the Holy Ghost
[53:45] and when you get the Holy Ghost The
[53:47] Works of the devil will be destroyed by
[53:50] the manifestation of God in your
[53:54] flesh yes sir
[53:56] amen we want Power amen I'll just say
[53:59] this amen the Bible shows us amen that
[54:02] power belongs to God how many knows that
[54:06] amen the Bible says power belongs to God
[54:09] in Psalm 62:11 David says amen God has
[54:13] spoken once twice have I heard this amen
[54:16] that power belongeth unto God in 1
[54:19] Chronicles 2912 he says both riches and
[54:22] honor come of thee and thou reignest
[54:25] Over All and then thine hand is power
[54:28] and might and then thy hand is to make
[54:31] great and to give strength unto all 2
[54:34] Chronicles 258 but if thou will go amen
[54:38] do it be strong for the battle amen for
[54:41] God shall make thee fall before the
[54:43] enemy for God ha power to help and to
[54:47] cast down in job 26:12 he says he now I
[54:50] want you to listen to this the Bible
[54:52] says he divideth the sea amen with his
[54:55] power and by his understanding amen he
[54:58] smiteth through the proud amen watch
[55:01] this the power of God Amen actually has
[55:04] the ability Amen to divide the seed in
[55:07] Psalm 656 look what David says he says
[55:11] which by his strength he Seth fast the
[55:14] mountains amen being girded with power
[55:17] look at this word girded it means to
[55:19] equip amen or to clothe amen so David
[55:23] actually says that God will do the same
[55:25] thing to the the mountains amen that
[55:28] Jesus said would happen to a believer
[55:30] that receives the Holy Ghost listen
[55:33] folks amen the mountains are not held by
[55:35] an 18 penny nail amen the mountains are
[55:38] not held by a piece of rebar amen the
[55:40] mountains are held by the strength and
[55:43] the power of almighty God that's why the
[55:46] devil hates you you're not hailed by a
[55:48] handshake you're not hail by a
[55:50] preacher's personality but the same
[55:53] hands that is holding the mountains the
[55:55] same hands that has divided the sea is
[55:59] the same hands that has clothed you and
[56:01] equipped you and set you firmly in the
[56:04] position that you're standing in tonight
[56:06] oh I want to say it to the devil amen
[56:08] who's got more power I'll say it very
[56:11] plainly God
[56:13] does and there ain't nobody got more
[56:16] power than my God so what kind of power
[56:19] then listen to The Prophet asked the
[56:21] question who's got any more power than
[56:23] God so what kind of a power have you got
[56:26] got over you to take care of you sister
[56:29] Don all these months in this battle but
[56:32] what kind of power have you got over you
[56:34] to take care of you listen what a
[56:36] prophet said the whole powers that
[56:39] created the
[56:40] universe well that ought to make you put
[56:42] your shouting shoes on in the house of
[56:44] God Amen the same powers that created
[56:48] the universe is the same Powers that's
[56:51] taking care of every one of you
[56:53] Believers in church age book pick up
[56:55] your pen and write he says this the
[56:57] members of the Virgin bride will love
[57:00] him and they will have his potential see
[57:02] for he is their head and all power
[57:06] belongs to him they are subject to him
[57:09] as the members of our bodies amen are
[57:12] subject to our heads amen don't you ever
[57:15] forget this church that you're not
[57:18] subject to a preacher you're not subject
[57:20] to a pope somewhere you're not subject
[57:22] now I'm not I'm not saying you're not
[57:23] subject to a pastor I'm saying you're
[57:25] not subject to a man's idea you are
[57:28] subject to God and brother B said I amen
[57:31] I want to clarify that Amen brother B
[57:33] said I believe in Holy Ghost filled
[57:34] leadership amen but I believe it comes
[57:37] through the word amen by God called
[57:40] men in reality you're not submitting
[57:43] yourself to brother berer you're
[57:44] submitting yourself to the word that he
[57:47] has been entrusted to bring to you as a
[57:49] separate among the flock let me say this
[57:52] God's power is not to be made a show in
[57:56] it's actually to be displayed when you
[57:58] see the Seas you're looking at a display
[58:02] of the power of God when you see the
[58:04] mountains in their positions you are
[58:06] looking at a display of the power of God
[58:09] brother B said like this he said God's
[58:11] power amen is displayed in his
[58:14] characteristic now let me ask you
[58:16] something what is the characteristic of
[58:18] God well a prophet identified it he said
[58:21] it's Hebrews 138 right that Jesus Christ
[58:24] is the same amen yesterday today and
[58:27] forever he said it like this he said
[58:30] it's Malachi 3:6 for I am the Lord and I
[58:33] change not come on folks amen the
[58:35] characteristic of God is not our human
[58:37] ability it's not our education it's the
[58:41] fact that God is the unchanging God in
[58:44] the middle of a changing World in
[58:47] Hebrews chapter 1 and verse one I love
[58:49] what Paul says he said God man I'm
[58:51] feeling good it's a good atmosphere here
[58:54] tonight he said God who it's sunr times
[58:57] and diverse manners what did he do he
[59:00] spake in times past unto the fathers by
[59:03] the prophets but hath in these last days
[59:05] spoken unto us amen by his son whom he
[59:09] has appointed heir of All Things by whom
[59:11] also he made the worlds who be the
[59:14] brightness of his glory and the
[59:16] expressed image of his person now watch
[59:19] this and upholding all things amen by
[59:22] the word of his
[59:24] power it amazing brother brother David
[59:27] that it isn't the power of His word but
[59:30] he says upholding All Things by the word
[59:33] of his power when he has by himself
[59:35] purged our sins he sat down on the right
[59:38] hand of the Majesty on high Ram comes
[59:41] along in Hebrew series and says it like
[59:43] this he says the brightness of whose
[59:45] Glory God's glory the expressed image of
[59:48] whose presence God's he said see or
[59:51] expressed image of his person and
[59:53] upholding All Things by the word word he
[59:56] said there you are the word that upholds
[59:59] all things amen Matthew 24 heavens and
[1:00:02] earth will pass away but my word amen
[1:00:05] shall never pass away he said he upholds
[1:00:09] all things Satan tries to down it and
[1:00:12] say it's an old book it's been
[1:00:14] translated even the Roman Catholic
[1:00:16] bishop uh of the church Bishop Sheen
[1:00:18] said that it's been translated four or
[1:00:21] five different times and there's not
[1:00:23] much to it you couldn't live by it if
[1:00:25] you had to but he upholds all things by
[1:00:28] his word amen that's what I think about
[1:00:31] it he says I believe the Bible amen the
[1:00:35] word of his power he said there's power
[1:00:38] in the words oh Church of the Living God
[1:00:41] you say why do we need to get the word
[1:00:43] in us because we are not an emotional
[1:00:46] bride we are not a gifted musically
[1:00:49] bride we are a word born bride which
[1:00:52] means if the word is in the bride she
[1:00:55] cannot fail because the word cannot fail
[1:00:59] oh hallelujah what a revelation that
[1:01:01] ought to bring to your heart tonight
[1:01:03] amen Heavens will pass away and the
[1:01:05] Earth will pass away but if you got the
[1:01:08] holy ghost in your soul the devil can
[1:01:10] throw everything he's got at you but
[1:01:12] you'll get back up because the same
[1:01:15] power that divided the sea that fastened
[1:01:18] the mountains is in your soul and the
[1:01:21] devil can't move you the devil can't
[1:01:23] shake you hell can't scare you sickness
[1:01:26] can't defeat you disease can't have you
[1:01:28] because the word of his power is
[1:01:31] upholding you in the face of every
[1:01:33] obstacle that the devil frows in front
[1:01:35] of
[1:01:36] you my goodness we're not supported by
[1:01:39] our own human abilities our support is a
[1:01:42] Divine support our support is Christ and
[1:01:47] we are equipped I just want to say this
[1:01:50] we are not partially equipped for this
[1:01:52] battle we are fully equipped this said
[1:01:56] brother Andrew I'm not good enough can I
[1:01:58] just say it to you very plain God don't
[1:02:00] call the equipped but he equips the
[1:02:03] called in other words God don't call you
[1:02:06] and say you got this ability and this
[1:02:08] ability and this ability no he calls you
[1:02:12] and he gives you the ability to do what
[1:02:14] he's calling you to do he said see the
[1:02:17] god that wrote the word now I want you
[1:02:18] to catch this the god that wrote the
[1:02:21] word in this hour amen invested the word
[1:02:25] into a Prophet which is a Divine
[1:02:28] revealer of that word now come on folks
[1:02:31] they stayed with him in the first pool
[1:02:33] they shouted in the second pull but when
[1:02:35] he come to that third pull which was the
[1:02:38] opening of the word they could go no
[1:02:40] further you know why because now he's
[1:02:43] separating this bride amen from a church
[1:02:46] into a wife of Jesus Christ he's going
[1:02:49] to literally reveal the things that have
[1:02:52] been hid since before the foundation of
[1:02:55] the world and they're going to come into
[1:02:57] your soul by the preaching of the
[1:03:00] message of the hour listen folks he was
[1:03:03] invested with the word with power from

[1:03:10] breach 1963 he says now tomorrow night
[1:03:13] by the grace of God we're going to try
[1:03:16] amen to break that first seal if God
[1:03:18] will break it for us now watch this and
[1:03:21] let us see what this Revelation has been
[1:03:25] it's been healed from the foundation of
[1:03:27] the world now watch this he's going to
[1:03:30] reveal amen the symbol and there's no
[1:03:33] longer going to be a question upon the
[1:03:36] symbol remember uh how many how many
[1:03:39] Bible readers have we got here tonight
[1:03:40] you like to read your Bible okay go read
[1:03:42] the book of Revelation sometime and you
[1:03:44] won't get out of the first chapter
[1:03:46] without finding about 10 or 15 symbols
[1:03:49] because the Book of Revelation is a book
[1:03:51] of symbols but remember in the first
[1:03:53] seal he said now watch he said there's a
[1:03:55] symbol he said but there's got to come a
[1:03:58] reality to that symbol he said like when
[1:04:00] in heaven when that first sh open there
[1:04:02] was Thunder he said now watch he said
[1:04:04] now we'll turn to John 12 and we won't
[1:04:07] have to wonder no more so when a prophet
[1:04:10] begin to preach he was not refreshing
[1:04:12] your memory on what the symbol is he was
[1:04:15] showing you what the revelation of that
[1:04:18] symbol is listen folks if it's still in
[1:04:20] symbol form we are a powerless church we
[1:04:23] don't know what to believe we don't know
[1:04:25] if the White Horse is the Christ or if
[1:04:27] he is the Antichrist but if a revelation
[1:04:30] comes to that symbol then we know that
[1:04:33] it's not Christ it's the Antichrist it's
[1:04:35] the devil trying to conquer the Church
[1:04:38] of the Living God I say thank God for
[1:04:40] this message I say thank God for a
[1:04:42] prophet who was not just giving us a
[1:04:44] religious education folks he was giving
[1:04:47] us the revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:04:50] fight back against every devil that
[1:04:52] comes against us now listen to this he
[1:04:55] said before we do that Center friend or
[1:04:57] lukor church member do you just have a
[1:04:59] membership in a church or do you not
[1:05:02] have a membership and if you only have a
[1:05:04] membership he said you'd be pretty
[1:05:06] pretty near as well off without it you
[1:05:09] need a birth you must come to the blood
[1:05:12] you must come to something that just
[1:05:14] spots the sin away amen till there's no
[1:05:17] more remembrance of

[1:05:49] mediator as far as I know is still on
[1:05:52] the throne and he's making intercession

[1:12:56] his people where that Jesus Christ is
[1:12:59] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:03] proving himself and that's what the
[1:13:06] world is hungering for church the world
[1:13:09] is not hungering for more religious
[1:13:11] programs they're not hungering for more
[1:13:13] education or more theology or more
[1:13:16] philosophy they're starving to death to
[1:13:19] see the characteristic of God on display
[1:13:22] in people who claim to call themselves
[1:13:27] Christians now I know it may get a
[1:13:28] little tight here but let's just preach
[1:13:30] a second because people actually think
[1:13:32] fanaticism is the power of God I'll just
[1:13:35] say this fanaticism makes the real power
[1:13:38] of God shine that much more brighter you
[1:13:40] know what the real power of the
[1:13:41] resurrected Christ is it is the real
[1:13:44] Pentecostal blessing you know what the
[1:13:46] Pentecostal blessing is don't you it's
[1:13:49] the confirmation of the Resurrection if
[1:13:52] you have the Pentecostal blessing you
[1:13:54] are are confirming to whoever you come
[1:13:57] in contact with that the God I serve is
[1:14:00] a living God he's not a god of my
[1:14:03] imagination he's not a god of wood he's
[1:14:06] not a god of stone he's a living God

[1:14:12] he's a healing God oh sister Donna amen
[1:14:15] I say God bless you amen every person
[1:14:17] you've come in contact with is a witness
[1:14:20] to them that your God is not a god of
[1:14:23] religion he's not a god of History but
[1:14:25] he's an everpresent help in the time of
[1:14:28] trouble come on folks amen she may be
[1:14:31] bad on cancer but the word of this power
[1:14:34] upholds all things and she is proving to
[1:14:37] whoever she comes in contact with my God
[1:14:40] is
[1:14:41] alive Hallelujah and he's well and he's
[1:14:45] able to do exceedingly and abundantly
[1:14:48] above all I can ask her than I'm just
[1:14:50] going to say it very plainly Church the
[1:14:52] world has the wrong
[1:14:55] understanding of what power
[1:14:58] is the prophet of God said how could
[1:15:00] Satan say that man could be God I want
[1:15:03] you to hear this he's speaking of Jesus
[1:15:06] a man that could take the challenge of a
[1:15:08] priest are you with me he could take the
[1:15:12] challenge of a priest brother Danny he
[1:15:15] could let a drunken Soldier spit in his
[1:15:18] face I'm talking about your
[1:15:23] husband will you be my
[1:15:26] bodyguard you didn't answer that oh
[1:15:29] praise God I'm safe now makes you
[1:15:32] nervous when The Bodyguard just
[1:15:33] Chuckles
[1:15:35] kid he let a drunken Soldier spit in his
[1:15:38] face Brother Brad he let a priest
[1:15:41] challenge him you know what he says he
[1:15:43] said today we got the wrong conception
[1:15:46] of power see to the world power would
[1:15:49] have been amen spitting back or letting
[1:15:51] him have a piece of his mind power would
[1:15:53] have been amen standing right there now
[1:15:55] come on folks we're talking about the
[1:15:57] we're talking about the word made flesh
[1:15:59] we're talking about Jesus who spoke to
[1:16:01] the storms he raised the dead he healed
[1:16:04] the crippled he conquered blinded eyes
[1:16:06] come on he opened blinded eyes he done
[1:16:09] all these Miracles Brother Brad and yet
[1:16:11] he stands there and lets a priest
[1:16:14] challenge
[1:16:17] him and he don't stand there and preach
[1:16:20] him a six- hour sermon on what all he's
[1:16:22] done and how many sermons he's preached
[1:16:24] and
[1:16:25] but he stands there and he displays the
[1:16:28] power that was going to come from on
[1:16:31] high into his church another church in
[1:16:34] the last days he said today we got the
[1:16:37] wrong conception of power now can I just
[1:16:40] say what he said he said power is
[1:16:44] overcoming can I read the rest of this
[1:16:47] it's returning good for
[1:16:52] evil he says that's the real power he
[1:16:57] said see that can love your enemy oh God
[1:17:00] and can do good to those that do evil to
[1:17:03] you that's real power see he said that's
[1:17:07] God's power yes Maniacs can break chains
[1:17:10] but it takes a real man to return good
[1:17:13] for evil now watch this from his heart
[1:17:18] not because a religious duty but from
[1:17:21] his heart now folks it's not a strange
[1:17:25] thing that Malachi 4 says our hearts
[1:17:28] will be turned back unto the faith of
[1:17:30] the apostolic fathers listen folks we're
[1:17:33] not serving God from our heads we're
[1:17:35] serving God from our hearts which is the
[1:17:39] Abiding Place of the original restored
[1:17:42] real
[1:17:43] power now I just want to I just want to
[1:17:46] I want to read something to you if
[1:17:47] that's okay in Luke 2334 is everybody
[1:17:50] okay here's our lord Jesus hanging up on
[1:17:53] the cross he's our head he's our Lord
[1:17:56] he's our husband he's our everything
[1:17:59] right he's raised the dead he's open
[1:18:01] binded eyes he's calmed the storm he's
[1:18:03] walked on water he's broke bread and
[1:18:05] he's turned water into wine and he's
[1:18:07] brother John he's fed 5,000 with two
[1:18:10] fish and Five Loaves and I mean he's
[1:18:12] done some mighty things Brother Brad and
[1:18:14] here he is and he's hanging on the cross
[1:18:17] and there's the priest that challenged
[1:18:19] him there's the drunken soldier that
[1:18:21] spit in his face and I want you to hear
[1:18:24] what he says he says father forgive
[1:18:30] them
[1:18:32] hello did did I read that right father
[1:18:36] forgive them for they know not what they
[1:18:41] do and they parted his reignment and
[1:18:44] they cast lots I want you to watch
[1:18:47] something here is our lord Jesus hanging
[1:18:50] upon the cross he is the real power of
[1:18:52] God the Bible says there was was a spear
[1:18:55] right that was run in his side and out
[1:18:58] of his side come water and blood and
[1:19:00] spirit his Spirit was released come on
[1:19:04] Church why was the spirit released that
[1:19:06] it might come back upon those who had
[1:19:09] been saved and Redeemed by his blood and
[1:19:12] out of him comes these words
[1:19:17] father it always gets tight when you
[1:19:19] start preaching on
[1:19:21] this but it's still the truth folks
[1:19:24] father mother forgive them for they know
[1:19:27] not what they do now let me say this he
[1:19:29] is the head right then if he is the head
[1:19:33] the body is to display the same power
[1:19:36] that the head displayed look here in the
[1:19:39] prophet message Dr Moses he said there
[1:19:41] was a man spoke from a Pulpit a mighty
[1:19:43] scientist not long ago and he was
[1:19:45] questioning me back in the room about
[1:19:47] that light that Pillar of Fire that
[1:19:48] appeared and he said Reverend Brandon
[1:19:50] they put a meter on a dying Saint when
[1:19:52] it was Dy and slipped off in a room now
[1:19:55] here's a dying Saint amen they put a
[1:19:57] meter on her and they slip off into a
[1:19:59] room and she knew nothing about it and
[1:20:02] when her death struck her she wasn't
[1:20:05] afraid for she lifted up her eyes and
[1:20:08] asked God to forgive every enemy she
[1:20:12] had am I reading this right ask God to
[1:20:16] forgive every enemy she had and she
[1:20:19] thanked him for the life that she had
[1:20:22] lived and when that meter was put on Z
[1:20:24] hero there was enough power that raised
[1:20:28] from that woman it was a supernatural
[1:20:30] something that went from her that caught
[1:20:32] onto that meter and made out the same
[1:20:35] thing as a lie detector he said see now
[1:20:38] watch you wasn't made to tell lies and
[1:20:40] enough power come from that woman listen
[1:20:43] to send a radio message around the world
[1:20:46] five times I believe it was of power
[1:20:49] coming off of that dying woman go on
[1:20:52] beyond the moon the stars to the Throne
[1:20:54] of God with a prayer to a sinner's poor
[1:20:57] heart in the hours of her death oh God I
[1:21:02] wish I was a preacher right now our lord
[1:21:05] Jesus hangs on the cross brother Bor and
[1:21:08] his final words amen is Father forgive
[1:21:11] them for they know not what they do
[1:21:14] listen folks we're here to do more than
[1:21:16] just believe like Jesus and pray like
[1:21:19] Jesus and Shout like Jesus and heal like
[1:21:22] Jesus we're here to love and forgive the
[1:21:25] same way Jesus
[1:21:28] did that's what the world is hungering
[1:21:31] for they're not hungering for philosophy

[1:23:09] powerful Church a powerful church is a
[1:23:13] church that is able to
[1:23:15] forgive now I've been preaching since I
[1:23:17] was 13 years old I preached I know how
[1:23:19] many churches am me one of the first
[1:23:21] churches I ever preached in was right
[1:23:23] here right here was a side note free of
[1:23:25] charge I was preaching at brother W's
[1:23:27] the other day brother martin say having
[1:23:28] a banquet and brother Josh Martin I
[1:23:30] think he's been here Josh told me he
[1:23:32] said he said man preaching Banquets
[1:23:34] would make me nervous I said well I said
[1:23:36] Josh I got spooled on my first
[1:23:39] banquet he said what do you mean I said
[1:23:41] well I preached it brother bers and I
[1:23:43] said we had the we had the banquet in
[1:23:45] the fellowship hall and then we just
[1:23:47] come on up to the sanctuary and had
[1:23:49] Church you know people get a little
[1:23:50] nervous in banquet settings I said
[1:23:52] listen I just got spooked what I'm I'm
[1:23:54] saying is I've been in some Churches and
[1:23:56] I've seen churches that could outshout
[1:23:59] could out dance could out could out
[1:24:00] speak in tongues amen but they couldn't
[1:24:03] forgive and they couldn't let things go
[1:24:06] listen folks the strength of your church
[1:24:09] is the ability to let things go and
[1:24:12] still remain a
[1:24:14] church you say who you after I'm after
[1:24:16] the devil because you're here to do a
[1:24:19] service unto God come on folks the devil
[1:24:22] did not want them preaching repentance
[1:24:24] because they did not want the other
[1:24:26] people to get a hold of what they had
[1:24:28] brother B said Peter preached on the day
[1:24:30] of Pentecost and the devil never got out
[1:24:32] of his
[1:24:34] bed he said but when they got the Holy
[1:24:37] Ghost he said the devil rode over and
[1:24:40] said I can't stop this it's on the
[1:24:42] phenomenal side
[1:24:44] now brother brother Brad now there's not
[1:24:46] just one or two men with a holy
[1:24:49] ghost now there's a whole body with the
[1:24:52] Holy Ghost now there's many Witnesses
[1:24:54] all over the place doing a service unto
[1:24:59] [Applause]
[1:25:01] Jesus you say why in the world Amen do I
[1:25:04] need to get the Holy Ghost because
[1:25:06] brother berer can't go to your job he
[1:25:08] can't go to your school he can't go to
[1:25:10] your place of home he can't go to your
[1:25:12] family reunions but he can preach a
[1:25:15] gospel in the Pulpit that will move into
[1:25:17] your soul and you will do God a
[1:25:22] service I'm not trying to be fanatical
[1:25:24] here amen but you got a pastor that's
[1:25:27] Faithfully labored in this pull pit for
[1:25:29] years preaching this message preaching
[1:25:31] the Holy Ghost I tell you this amen
[1:25:33] Every Soul that you reach is going to be
[1:25:36] traced back to that man's Ministry
[1:25:38] because something he preached ignited
[1:25:41] something in your soul and you went
[1:25:43] witness to somebody listen folks and it
[1:25:46] set them on fire because God wants a
[1:25:49] powerful
[1:25:52] church so This Woman's in there and
[1:25:54] she's dying by the Brad it's her final
[1:25:57] minutes they hook this this meter up to
[1:25:59] her and death strikes her and she
[1:26:01] screams out father forgive every enemy
[1:26:05] I've
[1:26:06] got real power right brother John went
[1:26:10] in real power Bend she got up took the
[1:26:13] heart monitors off and walked out of the
[1:26:14] hospital and said ha God raised me from
[1:26:17] the dead well that would have been a
[1:26:19] display of the original Power of God but
[1:26:22] a prophet said the real power is
[1:26:24] overcoming and returning good for evil
[1:26:27] now I just I'm sorry I'm the guy I'm the
[1:26:30] guy that studies his quotes probably too
[1:26:32] much but I I love this message the
[1:26:34] perverted power was there as well
[1:26:36] because the proph of God said then that
[1:26:38] same scientist he slipped into a man's
[1:26:40] room that was an Infidel and he was
[1:26:42] dying with a veneral disease and they
[1:26:44] sent a young lady in there to get him
[1:26:46] all emotionally worked up and then when
[1:26:48] he got angry with her he began to curse
[1:26:50] and take God's name in vain now watch
[1:26:53] this and that meter turned back as far
[1:26:55] the other way as the Christians did this
[1:26:58] way now I want y'all to catch something
[1:27:00] here it's a powerful point when our lord
[1:27:03] Jesus was hanging on the cross dying
[1:27:06] amen there were two thieves beside him
[1:27:08] right amen it's like brother uh brother
[1:27:11] Shrewsberry used to have a joke he'd say
[1:27:13] he said this doctor or this this man he
[1:27:15] went in to pray for he said uh hey he
[1:27:18] said I want you to bring my banker and
[1:27:20] my lawyer in here he said okay he said I
[1:27:23] want you to bring my banker law in here
[1:27:24] he said I'm dying I want you to bring my
[1:27:26] banker and law and brother brother Roy
[1:27:27] always tell that story he'd say they
[1:27:29] finally asked him said sir why do you
[1:27:31] want your banker and your lawy you're in
[1:27:33] here while you're dying on each side of
[1:27:34] you he said well I want to die like
[1:27:36] Jesus between two
[1:27:41] thieves now listen the man is laying
[1:27:44] there dying our lord Jesus is hanging on
[1:27:47] the cross dying brother Brad He's
[1:27:49] between two thieves listen he's hanging
[1:27:52] there brother BR said and the one on his
[1:27:54] I believe it was on his right the one on
[1:27:56] his right was pardoned he said he had
[1:27:58] never thought of Jesus a day in his life
[1:28:02] he said the one on his left amen didn't
[1:28:04] even acknowledge who it was hanging
[1:28:06] beside him I I I pray I'm making sense
[1:28:08] out of this here's our lord Jesus
[1:28:10] hanging there do you realize in our Lord
[1:28:13] Jesus's death out of his death came a
[1:28:18] convert out of his death came a convert
[1:28:21] out of him hanging there dying saying
[1:28:24] father forgive them there was a man
[1:28:26] hanging on his right that received his
[1:28:29] pardon and he said today you will be
[1:28:31] with me in
[1:28:35] Paradise do you realize that this woman
[1:28:38] laying there dying there was an Infidel
[1:28:40] across the hallway there was a Christian
[1:28:42] on this side and that woman laying there
[1:28:45] dying the scientist here's brother B's
[1:28:47] words he said the scientist walked out
[1:28:49] of there and was converted by that
[1:28:51] woman's death
[1:28:54] and said if God respects people who use
[1:28:57] his name in The Glorious way and believe
[1:29:00] him that much he said I now believe in
[1:29:04] the Lord Jesus Christ and I accept him
[1:29:07] as my
[1:29:09] savior what are you saying brother
[1:29:11] Andrew I'm saying don't you ever give
[1:29:14] up don't you ever quit serving God down
[1:29:18] to your last breath let it be a powerful
[1:29:21] Church Hallelujah there to our final
[1:29:24] moments of breathing let our breath be
[1:29:27] used as a witness unto God that he's
[1:29:30] able to heal he's able to save he's able
[1:29:33] to deliver what are you saying I'm
[1:29:36] saying this amen I'm turning the corner
[1:29:38] here I'm saying this the power of Satan
[1:29:41] is
[1:29:43] limited can I can can you say something
[1:29:45] with me
[1:29:47] Satan can only do so
[1:29:50] much he's limited's lied but the power
[1:29:55] of God is
[1:29:58] unlimited W Brother come on folks that
[1:30:02] Grudge is limited that bitterness is
[1:30:04] limited that unforgiving spirit is
[1:30:07] limited that that old hateful attitude
[1:30:09] is limited but there is a God in heaven
[1:30:12] who has come into the church by the
[1:30:14] power of the Holy Ghost and he's an
[1:30:16] unlimited God way back before the
[1:30:19] foundation of the world when Satan
[1:30:21] perverted to evil God being infinite he
[1:30:23] looked in the stream of time and he saw
[1:30:25] the end which is for knowledge if he
[1:30:28] don't know all things you have a limited
[1:30:29] God you've made him finite like you and
[1:30:31] I he says but God is
[1:30:35] unlimited God's power God's knowledge
[1:30:38] everything he is the
[1:30:43] omnipotent can I can I close by giving
[1:30:46] the devil a black
[1:30:47] eye look at this word limited brother
[1:30:50] berer it is restricted in size a mount
[1:30:54] or extent it is few it is small or short
[1:30:58] of a person it is not great in ability
[1:31:01] or talents look here at unlimited though
[1:31:04] unlimited means it's not limited or
[1:31:07] restricted in terms of number quantity
[1:31:11] or
[1:31:14] extent oh God Brother David having an
[1:31:18] infinite number of
[1:31:20] solutions did I did I read that right
[1:31:23] how having an infinite
[1:31:26] number of solutions when something is
[1:31:30] unlimited means you can never defeat
[1:31:34] it when something is unlimited it means
[1:31:38] there's no corner you can back it in
[1:31:40] that it won't come out of Glory to God
[1:31:43] when something is unlimited it don't
[1:31:45] mean how many restrictions you put on it
[1:31:48] you will never bind it because it has an
[1:31:52] unlimited ability with itself listen
[1:31:55] what a prophet says now I'm bringing
[1:31:56] this down to the church okay if you can
[1:31:59] limit God then you can limit Christ are
[1:32:02] you ready for this and if you limit the
[1:32:04] church today in its possibilities you
[1:32:08] are limiting
[1:32:13] God if you limit God you limit
[1:32:18] Christ if you limit the church you're
[1:32:21] limiting God
[1:32:24] you ever thought about
[1:32:25] that when you say we can't do this when
[1:32:30] you say we're not able to overcome
[1:32:33] this when brother when your pastor
[1:32:36] preaches the word of God and just lays
[1:32:38] that word out there and it sometimes
[1:32:40] shcks the height off of you and
[1:32:41] sometimes it shouts you and sometimes it
[1:32:43] runs you and you know what I'm talking
[1:32:44] about and sometimes it just gets right
[1:32:46] down there and he's saying you can do
[1:32:48] this and you can overcome that and you
[1:32:50] can be this and you can and you say you
[1:32:52] know we just can't do
[1:32:55] that let me say this to you there's
[1:32:58] nothing more discouraging to a preacher
[1:33:01] who sits in an office all day long
[1:33:03] studying and talking and fellowshipping
[1:33:06] with an unlimited God reading from a
[1:33:09] message that has revealed unlimited
[1:33:11] power which has specifically told us we
[1:33:14] have unlimited
[1:33:16] Revival and on Wednesday night or Sunday
[1:33:19] morning the door bust open and here
[1:33:21] comes brother berer and he's all fired
[1:33:23] up he's ready to preach man he's hot on
[1:33:26] he's got this thought and this scripture
[1:33:27] and this quote and he's just preaching
[1:33:29] away and you're just sitting there
[1:33:31] saying well that's a good
[1:33:32] point well that's pretty good well that
[1:33:35] was for somebody else and well I can't
[1:33:37] do that and he's just shouting and
[1:33:39] having a good time and you're saying H
[1:33:41] what's wrong with him don't he know
[1:33:44] it thank God he don't come out of here
[1:33:47] as L as sometimes we
[1:33:48] do but what's happened is he's broke
[1:33:52] into a realm of unlimited
[1:33:54] he don't know how to
[1:33:57] stop glory to God he don't know how to
[1:34:00] back up to Giants come on folks we don't
[1:34:03] study about Goliath we study about David
[1:34:06] we don't study about the Philistines we
[1:34:08] study about shamgar and Samson we don't
[1:34:11] study about the walls of Jericho we
[1:34:13] study about Israel we don't study about
[1:34:16] the fiery fness we study about the three
[1:34:19] Hebrew boys we don't study about the
[1:34:22] lons we study about Daniel and every one
[1:34:25] of those members of the Church of the
[1:34:27] Living God display the characteristic of
[1:34:29] God he is
[1:34:32] unlimited the lies can't stop him the
[1:34:35] fire can't burn him the Philistines
[1:34:38] can't conquer him the walls of Jericho
[1:34:40] can't hold him Hallelujah he's an
[1:34:42] unlimited
[1:34:46] God he's an unlimited God he sent an
[1:34:49] unlimited message to reveal an unlimited
[1:34:52] power listen that has produced an
[1:34:55] unlimited
[1:34:57] Revival we got to go beyond our own
[1:35:00] sound barrier we got to go beyond our
[1:35:04] own sound barrier into the word of God
[1:35:08] then it's unlimited what God can do with
[1:35:12] that man can I say this to you it's time
[1:35:16] to catch a vision of the unlimited power
[1:35:20] there's only two types of churches in
[1:35:22] this University today brother said then
[1:35:25] Jesus in his church today now now here's
[1:35:27] here's where I want to bring it to Jesus
[1:35:30] in his church today would be just as
[1:35:33] powerless as your faith is and he'll be
[1:35:36] just as powerful as your faith
[1:35:40] is so there will either be a powerless
[1:35:43] church or there will be a powerful
[1:35:48] church can I say this to you you are a
[1:35:52] powerful
[1:35:54] Church of the Living
[1:35:57] God said like this you're always
[1:35:59] pointing how World the how Wicked the
[1:36:00] world's getting but you fail to see how
[1:36:02] powerful the church is getting at the
[1:36:04] same time she's rising up she's standing
[1:36:06] on the field oh she's a little flock but
[1:36:09] brother God's with her and listen and
[1:36:11] she's going to Triumph just as certain
[1:36:14] as Christ rose from the dead so she's
[1:36:18] not just going to display his power in
[1:36:21] the characteristic of returning good for
[1:36:23] evil
[1:36:24] but she's going to display his power as

[1:36:58] through Paul and said perilous times
[1:37:00] will come they'll deny the power of God
[1:37:03] but look here in Revelation 3:20 he says
[1:37:05] but behold I stand at the door and I
[1:37:08] knock and if any man hear my voice and
[1:37:12] open the door I will come into him and
[1:37:16] will Su with him and he with me you know
[1:37:20] what brother B says that word Su means
[1:37:22] he says
[1:37:24] reveal I will come into him and reveal
[1:37:28] myself to him he said his word testifies
[1:37:31] in the last days there will be a come of
[1:37:33] Falling Away there will be a cold formal
[1:37:36] powerless Church age he says that's what
[1:37:39] we're living in I love this it'll be a
