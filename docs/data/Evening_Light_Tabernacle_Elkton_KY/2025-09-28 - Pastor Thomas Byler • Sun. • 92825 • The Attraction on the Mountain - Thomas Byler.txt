========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] Here we [Music] Good morning. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand. Children can be dismissed to Sunday school. Let's open our Bibles to Psalms 81. And brother Brad, would you open the service in a word of prayer? Just bow our hearts. Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning with grateful hearts, thankful to be in your house once again, Lord, and just to come and hear what you'd have in store for us. We we know that our pastors labored and and got himself prepared and ready, Lord Jesus. And we come prepared and ready to hear from you this morning, Lord. And we just want to invite your presence in our midst, Lord. That you would move amongst us, each and every one. Go through the aisles, Lord, and just speak to each and every heart that's here this morning. and that everything be said we pray Lord from the reading of the word, the Sunday schools, the songs that be sang just to bring honor and glory to you as we lift our voices with worship and praise. We just want to tell you we love you and give you all the glory and honor. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Sing aloud unto God our strength. Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. Blow up the trumpet in the new moon in the time appointed on our solemn feast day. &gt;&gt; This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony when he went out through the land of Egypt where I heard a language that I understood not. Thou thou calledst me in trouble and I delivered thee. I answered thee in the secret place of thunder. I proved thee at the waters of Meba. Sila, &gt;&gt; there shall no strange god be in thee, neither shalt thou worship any strange god. But my people would not hearken to my voice and Israel would none of me. &gt;&gt; Oh that my people had hearkened unto me and Israel had walked in my ways. The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto him, but their time should have endured forever. This one together. He should have fed them also with that finest of the wheat, and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee. Amen. God bless you, brother Brian. Morning, brothers and sisters. Uh before I get started here, you can turn to Isaiah the 30th chapter. Uh what I I think it was two weeks ago told you I went ahead and everything's taken care of. The insurance is taken care of for the year. The prepaid is done on the propane and we do have a a summer fill. I made a small deposit yesterday. So that what I told you is true. The current amount in the general fund is about $10,400. uh the uh electric bills. I I've been checking our electric bills based on forget about the cost just on the wattage used and it's been consistent the last couple of years and you all know that your your electrical costs have gone up. So actually in the middle of the summer we probably had one of the highest bills we ever had in the last what almost 20 years. So it was about $800 and the last one was about 600. So as we go into the fall forward, we don't use the air conditioning a whole bunch. So the electrical bill won't be a lot of times it's no more than $2 to $400 a month. And we won't pay another propane bill as long as we have a normal winter. Probably I will do my first fill up in first couple of weeks of January. usually is when we start using the prepaid. But like I said, I know I say this a lot. Um, if you have any questions about how the money goes, don't be afraid to u ask me if you turn to the I was thinking of what you know, brother Phil said on Wednesday and then I hope I find the right place here. Let me find Yeah, go to the 21st verse. I was it was in one of the devotionals also and I was thinking and it goes actually to what he was saying on Wednesday night and and the verse says and thine ear shall hear a word from behind thee saying this is the way. So that voice is telling you this is the way. And as brother Phil was preaching to you all, you have to have that small still voice. The actual true baptism of the Holy Ghost like he was saying, it's not you doing it, but it's the spirit in you doing it for you. And then I'll read finish the scripture. Um I lost my place. This is the way walk you in it. and when you turn to the right hand and when you turn to the left. So that spiritual guide is there keeping you on that narrow path into glory this morning. That's that voice that's really important. It's the voice that takes the word of God and has it applied to your heart and your life every day, every hour and minute of your walk. And um I hope I don't lose my I was thinking this morning. I hope I find these notes correctly here this morning. Uh last couple of times I haven't I was telling you about that uh I was listening to brother Phil and finding if you get out there and you listen to where the world is at at this present time. It's like they've totally forgot about the dark ages. Totally forgot about what happened during the dark ages and what brought us the liberty that we have this morning. And I I was mentioning to you last week about Whitcliffe and he was trying to bring the church back to correctness in the 12th century. Uh and and what really struck me or there was a another person in in English society. This this was in 14 uh around 1412 to 1418. And this and it was a night his name was Sir John and he was a follower of Witcliffe and sometimes we forget what the church did to people and what they forced on people to believe and to do. And the people loved Sir John. They really loved this is this guy. But he believed Witcliffe and he followed the teachings of Witcliffe. And when I mention I'm about to mention another name and you wouldn't think this when I say King Henry V, you would see oh the battle of Argent Court defeated the French a great leader of English society. Well, it was also this same king that signed a law into effect through the parliament that if you prayed in your English language, the father's the father's prayer, if you read the scriptures in English and you taught the scriptures in English, that that was automatic execution. And I was just thinking, the world is just running after things that have no meaning anymore. And I I was noticing, like I said last week, that everyone forgets what we went through as a body of believers. But and what liberty God has given us in his word this morning, we're so willing to just surrender it all. And I I take it to one simple fact that the Protestant church out there, the church natural out there doesn't have the word of God anymore. You guys rub up against people that say they're Methodists, say they're Baptists, they say all the different denominations out, but you ask them a few few simple biblical questions where the scriptures are applied. And you know, they have no understanding in the word of God. And that's not their fault. Actually, it's the fault of their preachers not really teaching him the true word of God and presenting it to him in a correct way. And I was I was reading that scripture this morning. And if you would turn with me to uh Proverbs, I don't I'm going to say I won't say it. I know I say it a lot. I won't say what I was about to say. You know, one thing I learned being a military type of guy for my first job I ever had in life. What you know what people desire to see in you in your life? Can you guess what most important thing when people look at you? Whether you're a boss or a fellow worker, a pastor, a deacon, whatever you are in life, what's the most important thing people looking to see in your heart and life? And that word is consistency. They want to look at you and know that you're grounded in the word of God, grounded in truth. And when you say something today, it's the same thing you're going to say tomorrow. That's what people need to see in our hearts and lives this morning. That's what they need to see in our experience. No matter what happens in life, that you're consistent. You're walking day and night, day and night in the path that Christ sets before you. And they can see the consistency of the word of God, that you're not changing. You're firm in your beliefs in the word of God. That's what the world needs to see in us this morning. If you'll turn with me to Proverbs the 4th chapter and Sister Janette was listening to a message this morning and it it really struck me also. Um let me just read these scriptures here and then I'll sit down after a thought. I really don't have a lot to say. I said I wouldn't say that but I did. Let's start at about the fourth chapter of Proverbs. And like I've said before, you know, there's if you read a proverb every day, it would give you God's truth is unchanging. What Solomon saw in his century is the same in our century. People don't change. And I'll start at the 17th verse. For they for they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence, but the path of the just is as a shining light that shineth more onto the perfect day. Goes with what I'm saying. It's the consistency when in your heart and in your life that people need to see. The way of the wicked is is as darkness. They know not what they stumble. My son, attend to my words. Incline thy ear onto my sayings. So Solomon's telling all his children, telling us also so many thousands of years later to listen to what he says in the word of God. Let them not depart thine eyes and keep them in the midst of thine heart. This goes all the way back to what Moses told the children of Israel. They were forever to put the word of God before them. Anywhere they went, anything they did, they were always supposed to put the word of God before them. For they they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh. Keepeth the heart with all the diligence, for out of it are the issues of life. put away from thee a forward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee. And that I I know that true. That's the that's what's wrong in the age that we live. Everyone's got an opinion. Instead of just keeping keeping their opinion to themselves and just walking down the path of life, they want everyone else to know it. Let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. And the and this is the one I was thinking about this morning. this 26 verse here, ponder the path of thy feet, let all thy ways be established. And that's really important and what I was saying in the beginning that you um that the the word of God I I said it last week and I I'll continually say it. You have to study the word of God like it says. You have to put it in your heart and in your life. Without the word of God, when you deal with that person out there, he might be the most intelligent person in the world. But if you put the word of God into your heart and you have the spirit of Christ, God will lead you to say the right thing at the right time. You're not responsible for that, but you are responsible to study God's word to believe be a believer in the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And I I've no sometimes people will be talking to me and out of nowhere I'll go right back to where God wants me to say something. It's not me, it's not you, but it's just God looking over his word and presenting it to people the way it's supposed to present it. And the thing that would really struck me, I said I'd quit, but brother Brandham was talking on that message. He was talking, you know, you'll get you'll mix up with certain believers that say, "Well, I believe the gospel if Jesus said it, or I'll believe the gospel if Peter said it." And I'll and you and I look at people like that and I say, "Well, uh, Peter said in Acts chapter 2, I don't need to say it to you. Peter said in Acts chapter two, you know, to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." Have you fulfilled that requirement in your life? Are you been baptized in physical baptism in the name of Jesus Christ? What brother Brandham was really striking at whether you're a Catholic or you're a Protestant, are you fulfilling all the word of God in your life this morning, and I'll just finish with this thought if I don't ever say it too much. You really need to know your Bible. When you know your Bible and you know your message, you don't have to worry. God will tell you what you need to say at that time, what you need to know. He'll move you in the right way on what to say to the people that you deal with every day. And you I was just thinking the world, they have a lack the problem with the world this morning is there's a lack of biblical true biblical teaching. And the world is going into darkness because the they're not being taught right. They don't know no better. So you have to be ready to give them a word of wisdom in the time of need. Brother David, man, you love the Lord this morning. Amen. Let's stand if we could this morning and sing that little chorus. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours this morning. Are you glad his mercy has found you this morning? Amen. Oh, so glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours. Yes. So glad your mercy [Music] has followed me. So glad you found me and you set me free.

Oh, every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before. Amen. You believe that with all of your heart? Amen. Let's sing that little chorus. And I I think I forgot to give this the words this. Do you all have the words of that little chorus? I sang never never never have I ever ever ever been so happy with my Lord. Let's sing that this morning.

Oh, I want to see him this morning. I want to look upon his face this morning. Amen. Well, as I journey through the land, oh, singing as I go. Yes, I'm pointing so to Calvary to the crimson floor. Many arrows pierce my soul from without. My Lord, through him I must see and know I want to see him. Just look upon his face there to sing forever of his son on the streets of glory. Oh, let me lift my voice with cares all fast. Home at last, ever to rejoice and wind in service for my Lord. Oh, dark baby. But I'll cling more close to him.

And I don't see anyone else other than home folks, but God bless you all this morning. It's just good to be in the house of the Lord, isn't it? And we were we were gone last weekend and we went down to Campbellville and to the dedications there at Brother Larry Harris Church. And a lot of folks sent their uh hellos this morning. And I thought I would do it this morning. And uh most all the William the Williams the Andes family, brother Daniel and and brother John Andes and and brother Will, they all sent their love to the church this morning. They said to greet the people. God bless you this morning and also brother Donnie Reagan sent his greetings to brother Thomas and the church here this morning. We just had an awesome time in the Lord last week. But you know what? We're looking forward to what God has for us by today. Man, he's the same God. We just want to come hungry. And brother Thomas, he told us in the prayer room, he said he felt like he had something good. And I I didn't want to be rude. I started to tell him or say anything. I started to say, "Well, I've never heard you preach nothing bad. It's all been good." But the Lord's really laid something on his heart this morning. And how many with a great anticipation, amen, what God has to say for us this morning. And you know, if you come hungry, God will feed you. But if you don't come hungry, you'll leave because I done a horrible job or Brother Thomas preached too long or whatever. But if you come hungry, you will be blessed this morning. and you'll leave here and your cup will be overflowing. And I ran into some friends of mine and they said, "How are you doing?" I said, "I'm doing great. No complaints." And the one guy driving, he looked over at me. He said, "You really don't have any complaints?" I said, "I really don't have any complaints because I've got go." He goes, "It's because you're a Christian, didn't it?" And I said, "That's exactly right. When Jesus Christ comes in your heart, we don't have nothing to complain about because we read the back of the book and guess what? We win. Amen. Amen. Fill my way every day with love this morning. And I pray these songs bless you. They've been on my heart the last two mornings. And the Lord just really blessed me in a special way yesterday morning. And these songs are on my heart.

We do ask God that this thought I feel like you've laid upon my heart to speak God if Lord that you would just take control of it Lord and say what you once said this morning. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen and amen. You can be seated for a minute. I do want to go over with you. Amen. I told you I would Wednesday about uh the presentation Brother Brad gave a couple months ago. Are we good? Yeah. Do that. Yeah.
