we come before you once again thankful to be able to assemble ourselves together in your name knowing god that you're in our midst lord jesus we're so grateful for that father for the fulfilling of that promise that you made and lord we just ask god that you just be with each one that has come speak to every heart you know each one and just what they have need of and you know how to speak just to that heart lord we ask god that you just have your way in every portion of the service tonight bless the reading of the word the meditation of our heart that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to speak we just ask your blessing and father we just thank you father for your many blessings for your goodness to us lord we love you lord we just ask god that you'll be with us in us and through us now in jesus name amen ten bibles if you will to the book of hebrews two hebrews two just a little thought i feel like the lord laid on my heart to speak on it's kind of different i guess i don't know that i've speak spoke on this before so this will be a little different hebrews 2 verse 1 through 4. therefore we ought to give the more earnest he to the things which we have heard at least at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will may god at his blessings to reading and words you can be seated amen so we had a uh my aunt katie she passed away i think last uh this winter and so they had an auction for all her belongings amen and so the man that actually did the auction his name is jos or yoast says he called him an amish he'd be my uncle or my i guess it'd be my half uncle because we had my family had i think thinking it's 16 i think there was eight with the one my grandpa had eight children with the one wife she passed away and then he had another eight by another wife so we have 16 aunts and uncles and of course you know they have big families and so they have children and they have children so that's how far down the line we are so they uh it was kind of funny we were there looking at the belongings that they all laid out and they had a bible laying there in a case like and i opened the bible and the bible was i guess looked pretty new or looked new and i didn't know it was a german and english bible and then there was a byler bible when they called the bible bible and it was like that thick you know and so and i was just looking at some of my cousins and different ones and i says look look this they said something about you ought to have that one i said right there i said well i think this one over here is worth a lot more and i don't know what the bible bible went for it wasn't about three four hundred dollars probably but uh they went into a bidding war with the word of god and uh that bible other bible brought like twenty two hundred dollars just for that bible you know and i like that one so i went about 200 275 and they cut me off at about 300 i said that's it for me you know but anyway so today was truly worth a lot more and i couldn't help it after that you know one of my cousins was buying it and you know they go back and forth and squirm and like you know they just went in the bible but they outbid each other and everything at the end of it all when they said sold i went well hallelujah and my god laughs because you know but praise god it's the most valuable thing here you know oh my that was pretty good it probably went for more than anything else there but i thought that was good but anyway so but it was amazing you know to see like i said yours joey's my my half uncle and uh he pay he he was pretty wise about it and we we told him that but the amish schwarzenegger where i come from they can't go to our family reunion you know they can't go to something like that so he wanted to kind of have a family reunion slash auction so he just said we're having an auction for all the cousins you know all the cousins and so forth so he made it specific for that and it brought almost everybody there that was physically able to be there so i got to see even my my i think my sister anna and and david had moved out to uh missouri and we were trying to figure out last time we've seen each other and i guess it was like 16 years 16 years since we've seen each other in the same way with anna and jacob and uh the way we knew it is i had a picture of my mom's grave in my dad's grave and so he was kind of wondering how long it was and we knew it was at my dad's funeral so anyway we went back and i looked at the pictures and it was 16 years ago it meant not my dad but my mom because she was the last one to pass away so yeah it was my mom's funeral 16 years and you know after that long time especially if you're talking around from 45 to 60 you know people are going to change in that time frame and you gotta squirm and look and twice you know because it's amazing how you know just seeing one person one way you remember them that way and the next time you see them you don't really hardly recognize them because you know you're just a lot older and so it was pretty crazy because jacob i should have known pretty good but there was a group of schwarzenegger amish boy when you get in the group's fortune trouba army system mary jane you know how it is a little bit funny feeling and stuff but anyway uh so i was right there in the midst and i said i know you i said i would mean i'm not shy i said ah jacob that's who you are and he kind of laughed you know and jacob picked him out you know but he was really he really had aged but anyway so and my brother david um he was actually i actually baptized david mose and emmanuel in the pond up there one time and moania and moses both got the baptism the holy ghost but david didn't get it and so he turned back he went back amish he was pretty staunch he's a staunch amishman but i got up to him in the crowd of amishment hey dave you know i haven't seen you for a long time and i went up there and i gave him a hug you know he wasn't really abrasive but i jugged him up there anyway i said you better hug me i'm bigger you know not really but anyway we gave him a hug whether he liked it or not you know and so but he like loosened up and they were pretty good but so it was just good to see my family and so but david he has two children that have left the amish i didn't even know it but they were there also and so i got to meet them and they're coming you know one of them starting to go to baptist church and all but i really would love to sit down they want us to come and visit with and sit down and talk to the lord about them talk to them about the lord and the word of god so i have several that really that really want to do that and there's just a lot there's just actually a work to be done and so i certainly want to try to be a witness here and we plan on going again in a couple weeks but uh go back up there and and try to be a witness but anyway so that was it we had most all the cousins and the amish different ones they were all there and we had a pretty good time and this lady she had just a bunch of households she had scrapbooks she loved scrapbooks and she liked to make cards like uh cards like birthday cards all kinds of stamps and stuff she had and then just a bunch just a bunch of household stuff you know you thought you might get twenty five thousand dollar fourth but it ended up all going for about ninety five thousand dollars i don't know how but it did but anyway so but it was just good to see everybody again it was very different and i do realize that having been away from the amish and so forth i've missed out on getting to really know and and be close to a lot of my family amen so amen if nothing else i realized the importance realized the importance of trying to be a witness to them amen and you know i was thinking i was thinking about it if i'd had a chance to maybe have a talk with everybody or whatever if i would go up and talk to all these amish folks all these my brother and all of them i thought well what would you say you know i would ask him this question i said so i finally figured out i'd say this way i i finally figured out why that you guys are amish you know why you stay amish why you do the way that you do yeah imagine get their attention don't you and my answer would be this you're trying to make it to heaven you know right that's what they're trying to do they're trying to make it to heaven and they truly think that you got to be amish to make it you know and so and that's respect that's that's something that we have mutual grounds on is the fact that that's what they truly want to do and a lot of them i have family members that i realize they're not as happy as they used to be you know right they used to be a lot more cheerful but now they're getting up in their 60s and so forth getting older and as you get down towards the end of your life you realize that you know you can meet your maker one of these days amen and you get a little more serious about life and as you get more serious about life you realize that hey you either chose the right path or you didn't now right either you got it right or you didn't and it's the same way and i thought that's the same way with any church really everybody's trying to make it to heaven you know and if we all just realize that that it's not going to be your church that gets you there it's only there's only one way and that's through jesus christ because if you think it's just your church that's gone you're just bitterly wrong amen because there's only one way really and that is through jesus christ the lord i am the way the truth in life no man comes to the father but by me and so i believe that people would actually and if you'd have more respect for each other if you just looked at it that way and realized that that's truly what people's trying to do but they're just taking choosing their avenue choosing the path that they think is going to get them there because the fact is that that death is in front of them that right that last breath is in front of them the other world's in front of them and you better be serious about it amen and in choosing it so anyway we just hope that amen we can be a witness somehow to folks there i have of course david as you know they were here and so forth they have family members and then there says other families you just never know uh you know you know who you really can help but you just have to do what you can and see what the lord does because i know whenever i went to witness to my brothers and family i thought that this brother that sister would probably accept the lord and receive the word of god but it was just the other way around so you can't judge by your own self it takes god knocking on somebody's heart's door to do it amen and so anyway just keep praying for my family amen i have a real burden for them and i just uh anyway i just have a real burden for him amen that the lord will just uh you know if if people leave the amish if people come out where are they gonna go you know and so if they don't have the path to take how are they going to know what path to take really so anyway just pray for us all right so let's get back on the subject here let's talk tonight i want to talk about something tonight amen and i want to title a little bit something different if that's okay in brother bannon preaching a message on presuming he preached up a message on presuming he says you know i'm going to teach on the subject of presuming he says the webster says to presume is to venture without actual authority or to take it or to take for granted all right that's what the word presume means go without authority or just taking it for granted he says now that's where so many people does that just take it for granted amen that's right amen and now as we think about that word taking it for granted the actual interpretation is pretty a little different than what i expected it amen in the webster's it says that what does taking something for granted mean he says if you take something for granted he says you believe that it is true or accepted as normal without thinking about it without thinking about it i think everybody here sitting tonight if i would ask everybody just what that means i think most of us would agree that it's something that we would uh that we would we'd take something for granted it would be more or something perhaps that we neglect right something that we really don't take seriously we just take something for granted not seriously here it says that you don't really think about it but it baptized it in with presuming venturing without authority not being sure about not taking it real serious venturing into a place that you don't really have the authority go or don't really know about amen so tonight i want to just title this mike and grace will take a and and call this things we take for granted amen now in hebrews here if you'll notice that it says that we are to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard at least at any time we should let them slip i think that's something else that happens in our lives as we are married perhaps or or different things you know as we let our spouse or become more common to us isn't that right and we become negligent and we let it slip we let our relationship slip we can uh in our spiritual walk we let our prayer life slip and we just take for granted everything will be all right till we presume that everything will be okay now as i begin to think about this i really begin to think how we as human beings we as human beings have a very strong tendency to go backwards instead of forward so many times for every step forward that we take let's just do that for a second we take one step forward we take two steps back we take one step forward we take two steps back we take one step forward we take two steps back i'm already way back here again right we started over there and that's how we as human beings how that we tend to be and you know why the reason why is because of this flesh it's because of the first birth that we tend to be that way now we know that israel when they came out of egypt isn't that right the prophet of god said that the destination that they had to go to if i'm not wrong he says was about what two weeks about two weeks that it would take to get where they were going and it took what 40 years now that's some serious one step forward two step back that's worse than that isn't it every time israel amen whenever god would deliver him out of egypt you know they should have known that was the mighty hand of god hallelujah they praise god they worship god they give him glory but the first time they come up against the red sea they went 20 steps back now right why because they took it for granted that they could complain and that there would be nothing no no punishment with it in their eye the whole world is taking so much for granted they take it for granted we take things for granted amen now i've got different things would that be all right tonight we're going to talk about different things all the different things that we take for granted amen and it's a lot of things that we take for granted that we really don't think about amen and when you don't think about it when you take something for granted you don't what appreciate it like you should you neglect it and many times you lose it amen all right now there's so many things so many things that we take for granted but man as a whole is always seems like they always go backwards we're always going back and even hebrews there paul was telling them be careful now he says give earnesty to the things you've heard least you let them slip and it becomes common to you you know right when it becomes common to you a minute doesn't mean anything and then he says for if the word spoken by angels was set fast and every transcription transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect amen or let slip or take for granted so great a salvation amen how shall we escape i mean there is a reward people even in that part about judgment down the road talk about judgment how there is always a reward for everything you do now right uh i'm just going to speak it as it comes to mind we take for granted and we don't really think about how that this whole life this life what we're here for is to get ready for the other life how many believes that you know we just take it for granted that we're here we're going to live and so forth but no it's more than that we don't we should think more seriously about it not take for granted and realize that we're absolutely realized we're absolutely preparing and getting ready for the other life for eternal life amen for what is coming this is a place of preparation that's what this place is a place of choosing a place of preparation a place of training and certainly a place that you don't want to be negligent ultimately those who are negligent and take for granted the word of god are going to come to a judgment they don't think there's going to be a judge they don't want to believe that there's a judgment they just take it for granted that they won't but there will be the same way with the hell same way with destruction but those who don't take it for granted what do we expect a resurrection and a new heavens and a new earth amen oh we don't want to be in the side that neglects and that takes things for granted takes things lightly amen and paul's saying telling them here you know we're not going to escape either if we neglect this salvation which first was spoken of by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him and notice god also bearing them witness both signs and wonders with diverse miracles gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will so when this gospel came forth i mean those it came with power and demonstration of the holy ghost miracles were done just like in this end time amen the miraculous was done amen praise be to god so you better take heed peter first peter he also said in chapter the second second peter verse chapter 1 verse 12 he says wherefore i will not be negligent to be put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and are established in the present truth that's why i don't you know i've heard preachers perhaps i won't say they made it a doctrine or anything but they thought perhaps someday we won't have to have preachers anymore because the preaching is for the perfecting of the saints once the saints come to perfection you won't need the preachers anymore huh i like that idea pretty good but bible also teaches me that we're very forgetful and we need remaining so i think we'll always need preachers because we always need reminding because we're forgetful people is that right that's right we need our pure mind stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance amen why so do we don't become negligent and so we don't take things for granted all right so now let's just begin here amen i have a statement here that i would like to make just want to make a statement i thought of this statement and then i also read a quote on it that i really liked real well but that is live like you are going to die by the end of the day always live like you are going to die by the end of the day in other words be doing what you would want to be doing if you died at the end of the day then i thought about what the pride of god said how that you're not really fit to live in that right until you are ready to die and he believes that amen and it puts things in perspective amen it'll help you live right amen you love the lord first of all we take for granted where we live amen most of the time we don't really appreciate living in america you don't think about it you don't think about the freedoms that you have and that right just the place that you live just in this country we take for granted that we're living in the greatest country probably anywhere sure it's wicked sure it's that but look at the immigration crisis that we have that right they all want to get here brother glenn they want to get in here huh and guess what i if i was out there i would probably want to swim that canal myself i'd probably climb that wall myself i probably wouldn't care if i was illegal or whatever from what i hear that doesn't let you in if you get in so all you really gotta do is get in i'd be getting in huh why because they tell you about the opportunity and that right the privilege that you have people take for granted we take for granted the privilege that we have in the financial world isn't that right everybody wants to get in here sure they do amen no this country is certainly you know on its downward path but it's still the greatest place to live we still have more freedoms than anybody else we still got guns we still can meet in church huh most places no no amen and it's getting to where you know canada if i heard i heard about from canada how that they were searching for this church that is underground and they're meeting them from place to place and they're trying to catch them well folks that's back in the dark ages again huh my personal opinion is if people want to get together not wear a face mask and dive of it go make my day hey that's your privilege huh that's freedom you should know whether you want to go there or not make up your own mind but for them to dictate to you whether you can have a religious service and worship god or not and it has to be according to them that's dictatorship that's right out there that's dictatorship amen to me that's true freedom yeah we would advise you not to we don't want you to but if you're gonna you're gonna but not because we didn't warn you your blood's off of our their hands because they warned you is that right give us your warning thank you very much but now i want to do what i want to do spiritually if it kills me come on people when we chose to serve the lord amen we give up our own lives we take up our cross if and if we die like he did that's all fine amen all i know is if we go to jail today come we go to jail because we're having church praise be to god hallelujah we can suffer for christ glory hallelujah let's sing some songs these jail doors are about to shake like they did for paul we're under the power of god hey that wasn't in the script so you just take it from wherever you want to take that from but isn't it the truth we live in the world we still have freedom praise be to god isn't into something isn't it strange that the things that i'm saying here some of us might be ooh be careful brother about huh are we really living in a country where i got to be who be careful what i say huh shouldn't be because if i say something that's off the word i won't have a congregation am i right but for us to have to fear because the government don't like what she says well that's just a different story amen but freedom amen the country we live in the surroundings our area amen our country we appreciate it we're thankful for that freedom many many many many man has been shot in the head through here through here embodied half of their body blowed off their legs blowed off their arm blowed off millions of them so that you and i could sit here and have this freedom yeah that's what they need to be telling our kids in school buddy i tell you what if i was the head of the teachers they would learn what their what our constitution is they would learn what people how they died and the way that they died and the 18 and 20 year old boys that sacrificed their lives were scared to death but fought anyway and died anyway so that they could have freedom amen maybe it would cause people to appreciate it more but they take it for granted amen our very now where we live perhaps in what we have let's go to number two what we have what you possess how many knows most of the time no matter how much we still have now how much how full our closet is no matter how many cars we have out there and i've got four of them huh people don't appreciate what they have brother jack they take for granted what they have not everybody now huh i know the ohio people don't take for granted because man they won't find one little piece of trash out in the yard it is cleaned up folks when you get around some of these places the pile comes up halfway to the house i've seen it we down here in kentucky some hillbillies i like it hey if you feel like throwing your can out there for a while and clean it up in five years from now go red bobcat clean it up yeah that's what i'm saying appreciate where you live appreciate what you have isn't that right don't take it for granted we take each other for granted is that right a lot of times we take our wife for granted we take our husband for granted hello i mean we should never do that and we should always try to make sure our husband or our wife is happy how many knows that when you marry a wife it is your job to make her happy amen me and moses was sitting at david's at the table being terribly hair look funny too funny and uh i think moses was bragging about he made his wife happy he got a mother's day flowers she and and not just that but she'll bring her flowers and she likes that you know that says well then moses was like yeah let me tell you that's how my brother is and let me tell you young man if you have a wife you better get her some flowers i will i'm like well moses i don't do that too much you're like what do you do what do you do i tell her well honey you can have that later puppies it's about worse 10 pound dollar you can hear at him she said oh honey i love you different ways to make your wife happy right oh my that's right behind me knows it's our job we take our wife for granted sometimes we pay for it we take our husband for granted we pay for it if we neglect what god has given us we pay for it how many believes there's so many people living in a unhappy world in a terrible world they create their own world hello and they wouldn't have to it's simply their own fault amen because why look at what god has done now let me tell you something one of the greatest things that all of humanity is guilty for of absolutely taking for granted and that is god's goodness i was looking under a couple quotes about taking for granted and so forth and he brother bannon was talking about you know people take the salvation for granted he says you know as long as you're drawing breath he says your sins are under the blood and you can have pardon and you can be forgiven and you can get right with god but when you are take that last breath and go out yonder you're out from under that blood you're not privileged anymore whatever you are you are forever amen and people take and absolutely take for granted the goodness of god that's another thing that people take for granted is the goodness of god those who take god's goodness for granted will experience his wrath amen so i'm trusting tonight that's why we're here tonight is because we are not taking for granted what god did for us we will not take for granted what god has done for us what he has supplied for us what he has given us and that is his word that is his very own life that he gave for us so that you could be free so that you could be happy so that you could have the holy ghost amen another thing i found when we're in looking up these quotes but the bam talked about how that joseph and mary had it there they were on their way back home they were on their way back home and they took for granted that jesus was with him but found out he really wasn't because they took for granted that he was there and he wasn't he says that's exactly what our churches have done is they are taking for granted that jesus is with them and how many knows to actually put him outside and now they're taking for granted that he's still there and he's not there they just take for granted or presume that he's there and when the tribulation sets in they'll find out that he's not really there they just took for granted that he was they thought that they could live the way they want to live do the way they want to do is that right and that jesus would still be there but they're going to find out that they're presuming was wrong amen we take for granted our family many times our friends and they're right we take our church a lot of times for granted and so forth amen children take their parents for granted and even get disrespectful and disobedient amen when those kids if they'd really not take their parents for granted and realize the work the labor the struggle the love that the parents have put into that child from the day that it was born amen they would never disrespect their parents they would always let their parents have the last word because they brought them into the world if it wasn't for them they wouldn't even be here i mean how he believes that parents deserve respect absolutely they deserve respect and it is only when their parent kids take their parents for granted that they become disrespectful amen praise the lord we take our youth for granted never we don't think about it it's something we know that is true amen but when you get to be about 60 you realize by 70. i don't know about that now i was going out to the barn and i had taken me a nap today so i could preach tonight i got up and i got out there and my knee hurt oh my god said my goodness what's wrong with me i had to loosen up a little you know but we take our youth for granted i mean as we think you're going to be always young you're not always going to be young it doesn't take very long hello and it's gone your strength is gone amen i was lifting some barbells just trying to keep strong is that right brother glenn you know at 59.60 we better do a little pump and if we're going to make it 70 and still have any kind of strength you don't even do that well see i thought about lightening the weights up i said i looked over there and i said if something's too heavy is that just too heavy for a six year old because i think i'm young yet then i heard in the elbows at night now something's going on here i'm just taking for granted that i'm still young and i need to wake up [Music] amen 75 pounds really shouldn't be too much for me anyway we take our youth for granted amen and don't realize one day amen will be old amen people won't even recognize the hardly anymore because it's changed so much think about it sometimes i wished i would have said more to my family my brothers and sisters say well god bless you my brother god bless you my sister if we don't meet another 16 years it'll be an eternity maybe in another 16 years this is the last lap so to speak you know i'm saying this could be the last time we see each other we made the only see each other now at funerals that's where we're at amen simon believes it's time not to take things for granted don't take life for granted amen and you know that's what i realized i think that's one the one thing that i kind of maybe perhaps brought me even to this was the fact that we take life itself for granted we take life itself more than anything else for granted we don't we don't we take for granted and we think we're going to live to get old nothing's going to happen to us but we hear where a bunch of young people whole car load gets killed here all right this other person just drops dead or whatever no and we don't realize we take for granted and don't realize that anything could happen to us anything we take our health for granted we eat all the whoppers we can isn't that right i mean it's two for five dollars come on folks i ate so many of them things to my heart what am i doing i can't keep doing this but i'm gonna have to get some uh some advice from brother glenn because i'll tell you what when you get older you don't eat right your body tells you stuff i think you better listen that's right go home and drink a two big old spoon full of olive oil one in the morning and at night doing me good and not so many whoppers but we take health for granted all right my sister-in-law kathy as you all know she came down with cancer right my sister susie and then rebecca my first cousin she came down with cancer breast cancer she had to have both breasts removed and everything else i talked to her up there and uh i talked to her about it and she said and i said so she changed your dodge he says yeah four four five years ago we went to all organic huh kathy the same way we're going organic folks we are going to think about our health we're going to think about what we eat right we get serious about our health when we find out that we're about to die we find out our health is pretty important but sometimes we take it for granted too long it's why we get the place where we do amen we think we can eat anything any way we want to amen and then we pay for it because we take for granted that we're always going to be healthy but no but you take people that treasure let me tell you something you will not take life for granted these young people folks it would you know these in these x games have you ever seen them guys flipping the motorcycle over twice you know and doing all kinds of crazy stuff they're taking life for granted they make this one little wrong turn they're done amen and so we once you get a little bit older you get wise enough to know not to play with your life isn't that right you say well it may be very bold it is the bravest thing that you've ever died never seen nobody be so bold ultimately i ain't never seen somebody so stupid that's right sure it's brave sure it's that but to think that you might be paralyzed from the neck down i had a friend of mine that i worked with way back when i was 18 and he dove into a pond without really checking it out first there was rocks under there he hit his head and for the rest of his life he was paralyzed from the neck down now that wasn't necessarily foolishness okay he was just taking a swim but but didn't check it but you take any of those things and when you put the price on it you realize it's not worth the price amen so and and how many knows that when i talk about life that we take for granted most of all isn't that what exactly what the prophet preached on talking about life thirsting for life how the whole world thirsts for life and that's what we really want what we really desire if that's why armies are amish that's why men and i are mennonite that's why all these people are what they are because they want to live amen we want what eternal life because this mortal life is just a very short span very we take that for granted that we're mortal we think we're immortal people doing all that stuff think they're immortal almost act immortal and they almost are getting away with it amen desperation signs of his coming should throw every member of christ into desperation now about our souls how many knows that's one thing that we take for granted is our souls our soul is our life people take it too much for granted jesus said whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what shall it profit a man if he because gain the whole world and lose his own soul how many knows that's truly what we're interested in is our soul and people will neglect their soul moment of silence because that is so true we will not neglect our natural things hardly at all but when it comes to your soul is your soul ready to meet god before 12 o'clock tonight how do you take care of your soul do you feed your soul on the word of god is it more important than anything else in the world or do we neglect it do we take it for granted because i guarantee you not very many of us probably have been told by the doctor look you've got cancer can't be cured can't help you i've never been told hopefully i never will but i grant you for those who have it's a shock or even to think that you have cancer huh to say that hey you're going to die how many knows most people will get serious they'll spend their fortune huh they'll do whatever they can to stay alive they want to live amen and jesus even said what is it profit if you gain the whole world and lose your soul i heard brother brown preaching uh yesterday i think it was he talked about how that what if i don't know i don't know the exact things here but he says what if jesus if god would tell you look i'm going to let you for let you live for 20 million years it was a big number like that i'm gonna let you live and be live for 20 million years and i'm gonna make you the king of the whole world for that time all right he offers that or you can have a hard life of hardship and so forth but he says but no no this is what it was at the end of that but at the end of those years you'll be annihilated you'll become extinct you'll you'll be dead you'll you'll die you know he says i wouldn't want that i wouldn't want not even if i was offered that kind of a lifespan because eventually it would come around the years would be up and he would die how much better it is to have eternal life is what the point that he was trying to get is to see so folks how many knows we take time time itself we take for granted amen peter and caleb peter how old are you now forgot caleb's about 36 i think about 36. what can't we all remember when they were 15 16 17 here right another 15 years up there around 50 huh we take time for granted like it's just going to go on and on and on but how many knows time's running out not only for the world but for every one of us time is running out and we don't think about it like it says taking for granted is not thinking about it we don't think about it amen but how many times did prophet god say look and let me ask you this one more question what's the worst thing that can happen to us in this world this is a message question what's the worst thing that can happen to you in this world getting up and i remember up at brother billy's years ago brother john might remember when that gas truck turned over right and caught fire didn't they say he burnt up i'm not sure if people heard him screaming yeah in the air that would be a horrible way to die to drive a gas truck to get him off into the off the side of the road flip over and have that thing burn you and hear people see you screaming and screaming burn it to death what a horrible way to go that would be one of the worst way to go trapped in the car if i remember right brother bam says he's seen people die a lot of ways what's the worst thing that can happen to you can somebody tell me that's right sister hannah but everyone says the worst thing that can happen to you in this world is for you to go out of this world and not know the lord jesus christ that's the most horrible thing it's worse than burning up worse than any any kind of thing you could experience is for you to not be ready when your time comes why because over there how many knows is nothing but a nightmare over there and then it'll be the judgment and then it'll be damnation it's a horrible thing to have to go out of this world without knowing the lord jesus christ one more thing that i thought about this week about whether a church well let me let me let me let me pick this up here desperation we should be desperate our souls our welfare for hereafter that we are going to amount to if we gain the whole world what are we living for what do you work for what are you eating for what are you struggling for to live amen isn't that what we wanted to live and jesus came that we might have life and have it more abundantly all the father has given me will come to me and i will raise it up at the last day i mean us jesus came to give us eternal life totally free just receive it how many knows the world is completely taking it for granted totally ignoring it not taking serious not taking thought about it that's why they won't receive it why let's go on on the let me let me just finish this struggling for to live what are you living for to die and you're not fit to live until you're fit to die that's true amen desperations how many beliefs we need to be in desperation and the reason he says that we're not in desperation is because of a lack of the love of god amen i think the love of god causes desperations if god is in you the token inside of you and you see the conditions of the times and people waiting in sin the way that they are it'll throw you into desperation i mean those love of god puts you in desperation for people that don't know god one thing i've thought about the amish man in the night or any church that includes this one i have a little bit of a missionary part to give sunday morning but one way to tell whether a church is right or not is if they are trying to fulfill the commission that jesus gave the church amen what was the commission that's right when he rose from the dead everything he said was this is what i want you to do go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature amen to every creature go and preach the gospel a church that is not reaching out for lost souls don't have the love of god in their heart for people that don't know god hello they have no reaching out no burden for the people out there that don't know god is not the church of god amen because the church of god has a commission and they will go into all the world they will do what they can amen how many that's that should be our desire because listen when we come down to the door of death it isn't going to matter how much money you make that's going to have helped you live good here money helps you live good here but it's not what they're going to count for you on the day on that day on that day it's only what you have done for christ what did you do to try to help somebody else come into the kingdom of god amen and i don't know about you but i know that i need more of the love of god in my heart when i see people that amen that really need don't know really which way to go what to do amen and i haven't cared enough seems like to do more amen i just say lord help me amen use me where you can help me to feel for people that's ultimately the goal look we're all trying to make heaven amen and jesus jesus as brother braham said should be the what is it called it should be the tie of the thai post of every belief it's the thing that every person that names the name of christ should have in common and that is christ is the way jesus is the way it would put everything else aside and bring his right to christ amen people neglect their soul people neglect salvation and man they just take for granted they will always have the opportunity for something no it's not always going to have is it god's provide provision to absolutely take for granted that god has made a way how many believes he's made a way in this hour in the midst of a thousand different ways to go even if he didn't i would say in the midst of all of this confusion die god really needs to come down and he needs to come down and prove a way so that we can know without a doubt this is the way to go otherwise we're going to be in confusion and hasn't he done just that yes he has he has done just that so prove so vindicated amen that when you you can tell people look i can prove to you that jesus came in this hour and he proved that he was still alive he proved what was right amen through malachi 4. if i haven't told you the truth you can put a sign on my back if jesus christ doesn't come down here and prove and vindicate what i've just said you can call me a false prophet and run me out of the city did jesus show up every time people don't even accept proof anymore they don't accept evidence anymore amen that's why even paul was saying look many infallible signs and so forth he's done okay praise the lord your soul salvation all of these things we could go on couldn't we but mostly the goodness and the grace of god when the judgment day comes as the prophet of god said the question that god is going to be asking people is why did you neglect or as the prophet also said the meaning of it was take for granted millions of people are taking for granted that god's going to accept them that he's going to take him up there even though they reject and deny his word amen how many knows they're going to be disappointed there'll be millions of politicians millions of people that god says look i made the way for you why didn't you accept it you neglected it you took it for granted huh you spat in god's face by teaching people evolution rather than creation amen they take for granted that they won't have to come to judgment but how many knows it will there'll be a judgment day god's going to have a talk with him he'll have the last word every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess amen how many would say lord help me not the neglect don't let me take anything for granted every breath i don't want to take him for granted what was it stonewall jackson what makes you stand like that i don't take a cup of water and drink it without thanking my lord for he took nothing for granted don't take life for granted don't take your health for granted don't take salvation don't take anything for granted take it seriously don't let it slip don't step one step forward and then two weeks you're worse than what you was back then that's the way of your old man nature that's what the devil wants you to do amen keep stepping forward keep stepping forward keep stepping forward keep going forward and forward and forward getting closer to god taking less things for granted getting more serious in life and watch god bless you love him stand with me tonight musicians if you'll come with our heads bowed amen i want to say first of all that with our eyes closed if i was to ask how many is guilty of taking things for granted my hand would be the first stop it's first stop lord i take things too much for granted i don't appreciate things like i should just like israel amen they took it for granted but god was taking that god was with them and he was listening to everything they said but yet they still open their mouth they just took it for granted oh lord jesus tonight we ask god that every hand that is raised tonight we all well lord will guilty of taking things for granted we take so many little

be able to live and see god if i die tonight i'm ready to meet you lord jesus we're looking forward to that great land that is beyond this river lord the whole world is just presuming that it'll keep
