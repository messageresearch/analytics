just lined right up because i didn't know what songs to sing to close and you know you try to put things together and sometimes you wonder i don't know what i'm going to do but lord you're in control and the songs just line up talking about being shut in with god and and the hour we're living in so i'm going to try to pull this morning a little evangelistic meeting this morning and and message this morning and i don't tend to keep you long i'm not going to make any promises but um i just pulled some things out of the scripture that we've heard many many times but just a touch up and a brush up on where we stand john michael good to see you buddy always good to see you and uh a little tell a little story that we'll close with i'm going to keep you standing for just a minute but just just bear with me i'm going to stand longer than you are so uh i it's one of my favorite stories that the prophet tells and and i think it just types so well uh of what we're looking for in in the hour we're looking for and it's just a simple story he told and he was talking about how he was nervous and he was he'd been out on the field and he was just nervous and couldn't sleep and uh he he bent up and i think about around one o'clock in the morning he said he got up and set out in his chair in the living room and he was just meditating on things that was coming you know and things that he'd been through and and all along about daylight he said he was sitting there and and thinking about things and all of a sudden he heard uh from the girls room his daughters he heard a little rustling going on and next thing you know he said he looked up becky had woke up and she she thought to herself it's daylight daddy must be home so she jumped up woke up her little sister sarah and said that uh becky he said she was kind of a skinny long-legged thing and she come running through the room and sarah was shorter and young and he said she was just a kind of a toddler type and becky come running real fast she could outrun her and said becky jumped up in his lap and set a straddle of him and jumped up in there and was hugging on him and loving on him and thrown her arms around his neck and and he said you know how that makes your heart feel and uh he said there was come little sarah traipsing along uh you know in her hand-me-downs and said she was short and those little legs was sticking out over her feet and i could just imagine this going on in the house you know you see your youngest one come trying to catch up with big sister and can't catch up and the little feet you know the legs longer than her feet in their pajamas and and he said he he looked down there and becky looked up there and she was wanting to try to come and get up there and she was stumbling and falling and he said that she finally got there and and becky looked around and said sarah my sister i want to tell you something i was here first got all of daddy and there's nothing left for you he said a little sarah's lip dropped and drooped and the little tears began to well up in her bright brown eyes and i began to water and he said he stuck his other leg out and he said she looked up and he he kind of pulled her up there and she climbed up there like she was saddling a horse you know and she was about to fall off both sides she's too young to have her balance and legs wasn't long enough to touch the floor and toddling around you know and she looks up and says rebecca my sister i want to tell you something it's true that you've got all of daddy but i want you to know daddy's got all of me and i thought what an hour we're living in if we could just get so wrapped up and let him wrap us up take the story and combine it let's wrap up to jesus and let him wrap us up what have we got to fear and i thought man that's such a such a good story there and i just i've always loved that story and and it goes kind of along with what we're going to talk about here in a minute if you would turn with me into the book of matthew and we'll go to chapter 25 i'm going to read from two very familiar places here and gonna kind of expound on them and try to maybe take a little bit of a history lesson learn a little bit about customs and and some of the procedures and and why the why jesus spoke the way he spoke and why he typed things the way he typed and why the message of the hour types things the way it types and it all we'll see it all lines up matthew 25 verse 1 then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you bego ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage but watch what happens next and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not genesis chapter 7 quickly if you would genesis and we'll look at verse 13. give you a minute to get there chapter 7 verse 13. in the self-same day entered noah and sham and ham and japeth the sons of noah and noah's wife and the three wives of his son with him into the ark they in every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind and every bird of every sort and they went into and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life and they that went in one female of all flesh as god had commanded them and what happened and the lord shut him in and the flood was 40 days upon the earth and the waters increased and bear up the ark and it was lifted above the earth i want to speak this morning if we could for just a few minutes on the hour of preparation the hour of preparation let's just bow our heads heavenly father we come before you this morning with thankful hearts lord thankful to be able to assemble this morning and to come and feast around your word to hear the word and trust the lord that you're going to speak to every heart that's here and we're so thankful for that lord as we come to you this morning we lift up our pastor once again that he would get to be feeling well that all symptoms would subside lord and that he would get back on his feet and ready to preach the gospel lord back to with power and authority lord we just want to tell you lord we we love you we appreciate you we thank you for all you do for us we dedicate this service to you lord jesus just to bring honor and glory to you and to draw us closer to you we love you lord with all of our hearts in jesus name we pray amen you can be seated i think that i think it's kind of allergy seasons getting kicked up a little early this year and sinuses and i've noticed i've had a little cough and and so forth so may have to bear with me a time or two but i think that uh paul said it best in second corinthians 11 there and he said for i am jealous over you with a godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband that i may present you as chaste virgin to christ and as we look at these scriptures this morning i want to take just a few minutes and examine the parables of the 10 virgins and i want to look at noah and and the ark and the situation it happened there because both of these stories i feel like either point us to repentance acceptance holiness but more importantly than that these both point us to preparedness and we're living in an hour that as christians we have to be prepared we're living in an hour when preparations have to be made and and and we we see that it's more than just being around the church we see that it's more than just hearing the word it's more than just knowing the rituals or the plans but it's about living a life that is completely surrendered and prepared in christ because even in life we have to be prepared we have to take uh in order to be successful in life i should say we have to be prepared our children when they go to school when they have a test coming up we have to prepare the children right we have to go through the spelling words and they write them and they do over and over and they go through the math problems over and over we're getting them prepared for the situation that's to come at hand in life as adults you go through times that you maybe you have to go through a job interview maybe you have to write papers maybe you have to give speeches there's times in your life as an adult that you're going to have to make preparations if you're going to be successful i don't think there's anybody that would go to a major job interview and not be thinking about or prepare yourself for the questions that may come at you or the things that you might want to say the things you would want to emphasize you want to be prepared in life and we're in open hour that we have to be prepared brother brandon was talking about the watchman up in the tower and he says i feel that great holy spirit today is the same as the watchman that was in the tower in the beginning that holy spirit that tells us be ready be ready be prepared commit yourself and be ready for what's to come at hand he says that great holy spirit sitting up there as the watchman in the tower he said he's still the warning voice that speaks prepare to meet thy god every time he said you see a gray hair it's something telling you to prepare to meet your god he said every time you see an ambulance going down the road it's something telling you prepare to meet your god every time you go by a graveyard it's a sign that you've got to prepare to meet your god he said prepare now before because the hour is approaching now brothers and sisters we look at these 10 virgins that we just read about living in a day when they should have been prepared they are quiet this morning but you're listening these 10 virgins should have been prepared because they knew what was about to take place there was no surprise in what was going to happen but what we find is only half it was this many but this many actually believed what they heard only five had actually set back and and actually took to heart the message of the hour that went out and the seriousness and the level of dedication that was needed to enter into that marriage feast and there was only one way to enter into this feast are you with me and we see the common theme of jesus's teaching is centered around weddings and we think about the wedding of canaan of galilee we remember john the baptist he called himself the bridegroom who's going to introduce the ground the groom at the wedding feast we see the wedding parable where the king is announcing the and invited people to come to the wedding feast for his son and now we see this wedding parable concerning the five wise and the five foolish so we're going to have this little history lesson and look at these 10 virgins at this feast because in order to understand the wedding parable we need to look at the customs of the wedding feast jesus day as they were just a little bit different than ours america most in most places around the world we see a young man a young lady they'll see each other maybe there's something that attracts to one another their eyes catch one another and they find an attraction there and this attraction takes place and the two begin to feel a pull towards one another and they feel this pull towards one another and they begin to go uh over time this courtship takes place and they get to know each other better and better and better until they get to talking a little bit most of us have been there they get to talking a little bit and then try to decide should we get married it's more of a mutual thing most of the time right every now and then i guess there's one romeo that just pops the question out of the blue but most of the time it's a it's an agreed upon thing and so customarily they talk about this until this formal engagement takes place where usually the man will go and he'll propose to the lady and at that time it all sets in motion right everything is set in motion for the wedding to come there's what's the first thing people say what day is it when you're getting married have you set a date everybody wants to know what that date is because nobody wants to miss the wedding date everybody wants to be there at the wedding and nobody wants to miss it so they put it on their calendars and that's a big difference from what the wedding arrangement was for back then their wedding arrangement was quite different it was a ranged marriage from the families of the groom and the bride and over there in galilee the people of one village a lot of times they were closely related and you know everybody knew everybody everybody was kind of family so in order to prevent genetic defects and faults they would go out into the village next door they were trying to prevent cousins and cousins and aunts and nephews and you could imagine so it's customary for them to go out into the other villages and they're looking out there and so this practice had to bring around some cooperation between villages right and they go out there into these villages and so when a son come of age his father would take him to another village to find this bride and as he's going out into the village and he's searching out to try to find this pride he's looking and he's trying to see and so he says hey i kind of like this this lady right here i like this family right here at that time the negotiations will begin to take place between the father of the bride and the father of the groom and these preparations begin to take place in these negotiations and they begin to talk about it and they become on an agreement and they seal it with the oath of a handshake and a cup of wine a little bit different than what we're used to right so now they have come to a place in their life where these two are engaged this young man this young woman has now become engaged from two different villages and as they're sitting there engaged the marriage couldn't be consummated until the son goes and builds a room onto his father's house where the bride could live are you with me so the groom had to leave his bride and he tells her i'm going to go and prepare a place for you and we see the very same thing as jesus comforts the disciples in saint john let your heart not be troubled you believe in god you also and me and my father's house are many mansions his brothers maybe maybe different ones and he's typing it back so they can understand what's happening with this marriage supper in my father's house or many mansions if it were not slow i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and he said and if i go to prepare this place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am you may be also and whether ye i know you know the way imagine this conversation it's just like that of the young man and the young woman as this young man and this young woman's parents have come to agreement this young man looks at her says listen i'm gonna go and i'm gonna build you a place i'm gonna go build you a home like you've never seen before it's gonna take me a little while i'm gonna be gone but i promise you i will come back and i'm gonna bring you into my place we're living right now waiting to go to that place there's a place that's being prepared over for us there's a place that jesus promised us i will come again and i'm going to bring you unto myself so while the groom is out building this home the groom is out building this home the engaged bride's duty is to be ready plain and simple that's all she has to do is to be ready she has to be ready when her groom comes back to claim her she has to be ready this may take a year it may take a year and a half it may take a it may take six months who knows how long this will take but during this time she's going to go through the process of preparation for the wedding and during this time she has to choose bridesmaids to accompany her in this situation we're talking about she picks ten bridemaids must have been a pretty wealthy fella more bridesmaids more wealth more money more cost but here we have 10 bridesmaids and then this right here her garments had to be prepared am i going too slow too fast are you with me all right her garments had to be prepared revelations 19 7 8 says let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready and it was given to her to clothe herself and find linen bright and clean for the fine linen is the righteous of the saints but i want you to remember now this bride didn't have a set date there was no set date of when this marriage was going to take place all they knew is he promised i'm going to come back i'm going to build you a place and i will come back so she didn't know exactly when the groom would return only the only thing she knew is that the groom would turn return when he had everything set in order so the bride and this entire village so the bride and the entire church had to be ready now i can imagine that the word of his coming must have went before the caravan now they didn't have the kind of news we've got they didn't have cell phones they didn't have computers they didn't have email they didn't have text message but you know this guy probably got ready to pack his bags he's packing his camel he's packing his stuff up and people probably say where you going john where are you going bill [Music] i got to go get my bride when are you leaving three days hey you know john's headed down there to get go get his bride did you know did you know that he's fixing to go out there the caravan's fixing the leg and they're whispering in each other's ears trying to get the word out and before you know it the word gets there to the next village so now the bride is in anticipation the word has went forth and the bride finds herself in great anticipation and no doubt as the groom begins to enter into the city the groom is entering into the city and his best man accompanying the group when he gets there he begins to blow a trumpet can you imagine what that bride must have felt as a trumpet sounds and he announces the arrival of the groom make yourself known the groom is coming and upon arrival this trumpet sounds the announcements made it awakens who the sleepers it awakens the sleepers it awakens those that were slumbering and sleeping and brothers and sisters we've heard the trumpet for our day the sound has went forth there shall be nobody sleeping in our camp there should be nobody unprepared in the church if you're unprepared it's your own fault and we'll see as we look at these these 10 virgins we'll see the difference here because the midnight cry has been made that trumpet when it sounded the entire wedding party the village they had to be ready to follow him back as he come and got his blood so the groove has come down the trumpet is sound the words went out the announcements made he's here to take her home and he goes into the village and he gets a hold of his little bride and the whole village begins to get ready to follow the bridegroom back to his village you see this world is not our home where that bride lived that was not truly her home because he had went and built her a place he had went and built a mansion a place prepared for her so he has to realize this is not my home anymore he's come back for me and these uh bridesmaids it's their job to be able to prepare the way as they head back to the village so their job is to be ready to lead this this procession this wedding procession back to the village to where he lived so they come through here day or night they have to be ready so if the groom comes at night they've got to light their torches their little lanterns they've gotta light those so that the path could be clear of where we're going we're going to the marriage supper here's how you get there here's the light we're gonna light the way for you brother sisters the way has been lit for us can you imagine the difficulty of being ready for this kind of wedding procession maybe i should put it this way you are living with the difficulty of being ready for this wedding procession remember no date no date and trying to live with daily distractions these tens were these ten virgins were distracted but five of them were not prepared they had jobs they worked they uh uh places to be places to go just like you and i we work we have families we have uh homes we have to take care of does all this sound familiar but yet you got to be prepared when that trumpet said when the bridegroom comes you better be ready your all better be full and your cruise of oil better be full so the announcements was made this groom has come and they knew he was coming but it seemed a little bit overdue so here they are sleeping and slumbering in this parable they seem to think that that it would be that very night because they were ready like i said the word had traveled before the caravan and no point is the bride's maid should have known that they had enough oil and what we need to make sure of is that we've got enough of the holy spirit we need to make sure in this hour we're living in that we have enough of the holy spirit that leads us and guides us and prepares us and gets us to a place that we're dedicated before god that there is no question when he comes whether or not i'm going to be able to see the way let me tell you it doesn't matter what denomination a person's from you know that's a that's a that's something that we get tagged with that were isolators i don't look at us as isolators i look at us as prepared being filled with the holy ghost i looked up this a little quote i was looking for and i was trying to find i couldn't find it in the in the message and i knew it was there and i was digging and digging so i typed it into google and the quote was on wikipedia and they tag us as isolators but only we are the only ones that can go because we're the only ones that can ever have the holy spirit if that's our way of thinking we're wrong because the holy spirit is free out there for anybody that will have it the holy spirit is out there it doesn't matter what denomination you're from it matters what is on the inside of us these 10 virgins they had a little crucible five of them had it what was that that was a special place in their heart that's a special place in our heart where the holy spirit dwells and they had this little cruise and brother brown said now watch all of them were holy all of them were holy they had to be sanctified because that's the only cleansing a holy strain that god had is sanctification now watch all 10 of them were sanctified but five didn't have any oil in their lamp and five had oil in their lamp what does the old represent he said now it's not the purity of the virgins the whole story people want to get hung up on the virgins they want to get hung up on the life that those virgins was living and there's truth to that but the whole story it revolves around the oil because the oil represents the holy spirit so we can't focus on just what the virgins did or their works or their goodness a lot of times people want to get hung up on works and goodness and what i did for the church what i did for the gospel what i did for the message but you better make sure that you've got the old because all 10 of them were virgins all 10 of them were pure all 10 of them were just as clean living as could be but five had the oil there's not a church on earth that can live any more pure than the nazarene now listen to this he said in their teaching pilgrim holiness in them that's right they absolutely believe in the purity of sanctification their women don't wear rings or jewelry or anything purity sanctification every way they believe it the holiness organizations all the legalists that's their teaching they believe it holy holy holy holy he exclamations it women wear long hair long skirts man they're not even supposed to roll up their sleeves they don't smoke they don't drink they don't do none of that holy you couldn't live any cleaner but listen now but that same nazarene church if a man would speak in tongues in the church he'd be shot out the door he said they say they wouldn't even sit with one he said if you don't believe it try it find out find it out once they hate the very thoughts of it they say it's the devil but in my bible it says on the day of pentecost there was a upper room experience where there was 120 people and the the the the russian mighty wind came in and consumed over those people and the fire fell down and there was a holy globe and in that one they uttered unknown tongues but in the utterance of those unknown times everybody knew what everybody was saying and they were astonished so why is it people think because we believe in the gift of the holy ghost we believe in speaking in tongues and the gift of the holy holy ghost why is it people think we're standoffish or isolators it's just a sign of the old listen now all ten of them were virgins five was wise and had oil in their lamp another five was just as pure and holy but they had no wool they were sanctified without the holy ghost first john 5 and 7 says three that bear record in heaven father son and holy ghost these three are one but but there's three that bear record on earth water blood and spirit they're not all one but they agree as one you can't have the father without having the son you can't have the holy ghost would have it without having the father son and holy ghost they're one they're inseparable but you could be justified without being sanctified now we're getting to the topic you can be justified without being sanctified you can be sanctified without having the holy ghost be clean you live the pure life and you have a form of godliness but deny the power of healing and speaking in tongues and the great gifts of god and every one of them in there and one of the best examples and the easiest way for me to ever understand this when i was younger and i think this is a great way to explain it to young people is when brother brown said you know there's a glass laying out in a hull pen or a chicken pen and he said you go out there and you get that glass and you pick it up that's justification but it's still been laying in the hog pin it's still dirty [Music] it's not clean yet and he said you've got it in your hand you just can't use it yet that glass needs to be cleaned he said so then you take it and you wash it you sterilize it you boil it you take all the germs out of it and that's what god does through sanctification he picks us up and he looks at us and he says you're dirty [Applause] you're filthy i'm going to clean you up i'm going to sanctify you i'm going to make you worth using and so he takes it he takes the desire of sin out of her heart he cleans us up and next thing you know we're a candidate he says for a feeling of the holy ghost sanctify means to be cleaned and set aside for service he said so in the old testament he said the altar sanctified the vessels and cleanse it and set it aside not in service not in service but set aside for service and so now we've got this glass that was dirty and filthy it's been picked up it's been justified i know who you are i know what you are he's cleaned it he's taken all the dirty and the filth and the sin out of its life now i'm ready to use you so i'm going to set it aside now what do we have to have he says the holy spirit comes in and fills that vessel until it's bubbling over and over running now you're in service for the lord now you're in service for the lord so brothers and sisters think about that glass we have to find ourselves accepting the holy spirit you can't go without it you can be picked up you can be cleaned but without the holy ghost you're not going to go in the rapture i should've had a whole lot more amen there because that's what's happening right now people's denying that around the world here's your five virgins he said who had the old rapture in faith they believe in all the signs the wonders the prophecies and everything he said and the rest of them still virgins will not be lost but they'll go through that tribulation period so tell me you don't have to have the holy ghost to go i'll tell you you're wrong you have to have that holy ghost you have to find yourself go through all three stages justification sanctification filled with the holy ghost and here are these virgins and they say give us some of your old we want the holy ghost now he said it represents that holy ghost that all does he says that's the reason we anoint people with old when you come up to get paid for it you need to know why you're being anointed with oh it's because the preacher is saying i'm going to put this little spot of oil on you as a token that the holy ghost is going to touch your body not the preacher's prayer as good as it may be they may be able to pray and they may have a healing campaign in their life and that's great but it's a token of the holy ghost on your life that they'll cleanse you and heal you from your infirmities he said now these had the holy ghost they were sanctified they were sanctified plus the holy ghost they believed in the phenomenons they believed in all of god's power everything god spoke of here they believed it these were taken up and these said give it to us now we don't have enough to give it to you and they went in the rapture notice he didn't say they went into the marriage supper he kind of changed his thought there because we know that that marriage supper is the rapture he said they went into the rapture so when the trumpet sounded and the brother says when the announcements was made all these bride maids lit their torches in anticipation and brothers and sisters we see that in the world today the whole christian world is an anticipation for the second coming of christ that's all you hear talked about they talk about a coming of christ the second coming of christ they talk about a rapture and i've said it before rapture wasn't even a word many years ago they didn't they didn't use that word but now it's used every church on every corner they're talking about a rapture and every denomination every church every proclaimed christian plans to go in this marriage supper but only five of them had extra purchased oil only five of them were prepared if the groom tarried a little longer what was it predicted 77 we're tarrying the lord's tearing he's waiting for that last one he's waiting for that very last one to to get themselves in and to be ready and the cry's gone out and here are these five virgins that had the extra oil let me tell you it's going to take something extra if we're going to make it it's going to take something extra in your life something extra in my life right here deep down right here in my heart and these five foolish bride mates started to run out of oil and you know there's not a lot of places that probably worked after hours back then and the father i said hey you you're gonna have to go somewhere else i've only got enough for myself this is my experience and these five foolish had to go out in the middle of the night and they begin searching from door to door no doubt in panic no doubt frantically begging for more oil and i looked up a picture i like to look at the paintings because painters the artists that god inspires they can pull out details out of these out of these scriptures we hear in just a picture that's unimaginable and the picture i saw was the five wise wise virgins and the torches were burning were huge and there was a glow an ambient glow all around those five and the other five were almost on their knees with anguish on their face and fear and crying and begging you could see it in their mouth fixing the clown please give me some more frantic go go get your oil this is ours and in that picture the five wise had their torch in one hand and a little cruise of oil in the other hand you know what the five foolish had just a little dimly lit torch just a little flicker of a flame and fear and panic because it was fixing to be dark on them they could see the closing of time and so while they go out and they begin to look for more oil they're out begging for all door-to-door i need oils anybody have oils anybody is anybody awake come on is the store owner awake please open the store i need oil while they're out doing this and begging here comes the groom here comes the groom slipping in and he comes in there just quietly in the midst of the night catches away his little bride and the procession begins to follow him with the five wise virgins leading the way with their torches lit burning bright and they enter into his city they enter into a place that he has prepared for them and the you know what the custom is once that wedding party comes into the city the doors are shut so no nobody can enter into that city unless they came in with the groom we better have a relationship with god this morning nobody was able to enter into that city those those foolish virgins they came back and they come back and they look and say can we let us in will you please let us in we don't know you we don't know who you are the wedding party has already come into the end to end they're already at the table they're feasting i don't recognize you but i had to go get more oil i'm sorry that's too late brother sisters no one knows when that day will be just like that wedding they didn't know what day it was going to be they knew it was coming but there was no date set nobody knows all i know is the truth says that jesus said he gave us some clues he gave us some conditions and i believe we determined even last week we know we're living in that time we know that the groom is coming back so brother sister we need to make sure we're full with the oil as we look at noah god had him to preach 120 years this is simple preaching and teaching but this is reality of what happened and if we don't take heed to the reality of the past we won't change our future we should learn from our past noah preaches for 120 years right in the midst of the most scientific age scientific world than we've got today they built the pyramids they built the sphinx they embalmed bodies to look more natural than we could ever imagine but today they still look like they're alive thousands of years later he said they had color and dye that they made that last for 4 000 years and have never changed and it showed that they had a civilization like that you say why are you bringing that out because the bible says as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man we are living in the most technologically scientifically proven age since the time of the pyramids now we can't fathom that because we look at a bunch of rocks and stones and sand and we think oh that's neat looking but it's impossible for us to build it today we don't have the technology to build what they built today and here noah is and he's preaching it's going to rain because the word of god said so what are you talking about noah it has never rained how can you be talking about rain it's not going to rain you see noah was a prophet on the scene and anytime there's a prophet on a scene what follows a prophetic message judgment so noah here is up there preaching and he's preaching and the people are turning it down they laugh in his face and they look at him and they and they say you don't meet our scientific way noah what you're saying is not true noah there's no such thing as rain there's no such thing as speaking in tongues there's no such thing as the holy ghost if you just accept christ and clean your life up you're good to go noah and noah says it's gonna rain it's gonna rain you're just old-fashioned noah let me tell you we're probably some of the most old-fashioned people around we're so old-fashioned they don't even call us old-fashioned anymore do you realize that [Music] they don't even look at us with significance anymore we're just that's that group that's that crowd but i'm gonna tell you we're old-fashioned because the bible says we have to go back we have to go back to an original state we have to go back to to a garden of eden experience we have to go back to that day of pentecost experience that's what god is looking for and he said that scientific people looked at no one said look fella you're off in your head you're off in your head we got a radar we got a doppler we got machines that can go up there and it'll tell us exactly how much moisture is in the air and i'm going to tell you know what there is not one drop of water between here and there so where is it coming from you realize it had never rained before and for 120 years noah preaches rain how did he even know what to call it because it had never rained so here's noah saying i know it's going to do it because god said so and god is my jehovah jireh if he said it he'll provide it if he promised it he'll give it if he saved you you'll make it and noah's up there preaching over and over and over it's going to rain there's coming to rain the whole world is going to be washed away and the wickedness is going to be washed off the face of the earth it's going to rain it's going to happen ah that's nonsense that's nonsense we got our churches and our pastors don't say nothing like that our pastors don't preach on marriage and divorce our pastors don't preach on holiness our pastors don't preach on sin gambling no we we just love jesus he loves us oh joel you know who i'm talking about mr oldstein everybody's love everybody's happy god's good life's grand there's never nothing wrong for the people that love god glory to god i get on my jet and fly from here to canada tomorrow god's good you know joel osteen says some pretty good things from time to time but he's leaving out a lot of the meat he's got a lot of chocolate he got a lot of pie but he don't have a lot of meat and taters here's noah it's going to rain it's going to rain oh man you're off your head why are you building this ark up there do you think anybody's ever going to believe you the brother says let me tell you when god gets to a place that he's had enough god is going to get his point across god is going to make his authority understood and he tells noah he says i've heard they're scoffing enough noah you've preached you've been consistent you've been diligent in what you're doing i've heard all i'm going to hear now go get ready go get in and the animals will come two by two and two by two a male and female parrot flew in a male and female sparrow flew in a male and female goat a male and female sheep a male and female line a male and female tiger a male and female elephant a male and female giraffe and we could go on and on and on now you tell me how the people could sit there and watch this caravan of animals come into this ark and not believe the word as it went forth how can people see the signs that have been given and yet not believe the word that has come forth over and over one two by two two by two and noah tells them this is your last sign this is your last chance and they wouldn't believe it they told him said go on up there and live with your stinking animals go on up there and live with your stinking animals all we do we know you trained them [Music] you trained them to follow you you probably fed them with bread and cookies and crumbs and now they're just following you up there what a deceived bunch of people and noah says no matter what the world says i'm going to listen to god no matter what the world says about us you me follow god and he said some of those borderline believers you know you got those everywhere they're everywhere those borderline believers they sit around there and listen to his message and they set off just a little piece away and said you know what that old man may be right but we don't want to get too close to that i like some of the things they say but i don't think we need to get too close to that so let's just go up there and sit around and if it starts raining if it starts raining and that door shuts all we have to do is knock on the door because he's a kind-hearted man he's crazy but you know he'd do anything for you you ever heard that people say that man and people over there they do anything for you but they crazy oh no he'll do anything for you but he's crazy all you gotta do if it starts raining we'll knock on the door and he'll just let us come on right on but that's not what the bible said the bible said god shut the door and when god shuts that door there is not anything in this world that can pull that door back open and when god shuts the door for the final time there will be nothing in this world that can pull that door open and when i think about as the flood waters begin to come down and i think about these flood waters coming down on that ark and i think about the people standing around the outside and i imagine as the flood waters come up and how long about the time it hits them in the knees maybe the thighs begin to look around and they begin to wonder where's higher ground hey noah are you in there [Applause] something's happening out here something's happening out here noah and then the waters begin to come on up their waist and up to the throat and they begin to find themselves they can't bottom you ever been out in the ocean and all of a sudden you find yourself you can't touch the bottom and you're looking you about 200 feet from the shore you know you're going to swim back but still there's just that instant of a little bit of a concern because all of a sudden you were out there and the tide maybe changed a little bit and the wave come up and your feet's not touching anymore and here these people are as the rain waters come down and fall upon them they're not touching anymore and they look and shortly after there's no more tree branches to hang on to and the only thing is out there that they can see is this big boat bobbing up and down and they're thinking if i could just get to that boat that's not the way god works god gives opportunity god gives chances he says for whosoever will he never told anybody that they couldn't make it never but he gives you opportunity and here i can only imagine as this boat is going up and down and i can imagine claw marks in the outside of that boat but talking about noah it's the same thing he had to go through justification sanctification being filled the prophet said when he was in there on that first level he was down there with the creeping things and the chickens and so forth he said that was his justification he said then he went on up until the next level where the birds were in the ark that was his sanctification he said then he went up there where he could look out that little window and see the light and that was his buddhism of the holy ghost we all got to come that way justification sanctification being filled with the holy ghost and he said noah comes down there right to the end of this thing and he tells his family says in the morning god's going to close the door it's getting late but in the morning there will be darkness all over the earth in the morning the rains will go to fall and then this ark is going to float away and god will diminish every one of those cruel centers that disbelieved my message all of them's waiting he said the next morning they got up went into the ark does anybody know what day they went into the ark becky i knew you was going to have it may 17th sister alicia you say how does he know that it's all in the hebrew calendars the bible tells you may the 17th when noah was 600 years old after preaching for 120 years the rain comes down and all them people on the border said he's just but you see he said there's a divine line between belief and unbelief and you either come out on one side or the other and there's a time when you'll receive your last call brother sisters the last call is going out i beg of you this morning and challenge you this morning don't be found don't be found without the oil don't be found on the outside of the ark this morning don't find yourself in that place because when the door closes and it's shut there's a seal there and that seal can't be broken but find yourself this morning if you would like little rebecca and like a little sarah and run to papa run too papa this morning and wrap your arms around him tight as you can and when you're squeezing as hard as you can god give me the holy ghost god fill me with the holy ghost god give me more of you feel that living arm reach down around you and say i've got you i've got you this is the day to be prepared brothers and sisters as the musicians would come this is the day to be prepared the trumpet has sounded the announcement's been made the messages went forth conviction has been made and now it's time for us to be prepared surrendered and prepared let's just bow our heads if we could heavenly father we thank you lord for this day you've given us we thank you lord for this little thought lord it's a serious and sombering thought this morning lord jesus one that spurs our mind to consider what happened to those people in the bible that that were foolish in their thinking that were foolish in their ways that were stood against god's word and stood against god's plan and lord we don't want to be found without oil this morning lord we don't want to be found on the outside looking in and lord we believe we're bright we believe we're we've been sanctified we believe we've been justified and sanctified and filled with the holy ghost and lord if there's somebody here that feels like they haven't reached one of those steps i just pray lord that you would go down and prick their heart this morning let them find a place with some alone time this evening let them search themselves lord let us all search ourselves
