[28:05] remember the word unto thy servant upon
[28:08] which thou hast caused me to hope
[28:14] [Music]
[28:16] the proud have had me greatly in
[28:18] derision yet have i not declined from
[28:20] that law
[28:27] horror had taken hold upon me because of
[28:29] the wicked that forsake thy law
[28:37] i have remembered thy name o lord in the
[28:40] night and have kept thy law
[28:47] thou art my portion o lord i have said
[28:50] that i would keep thy words
[28:58] i thought on my ways and turned my feet
[29:01] unto thy testimonies
[29:07] the bands of the wicked have robbed me
[29:09] but i have not forgot in thy law
[29:18] i am a companion of all them that fear
[29:21] thee and of them that keep thy precepts
[29:24] the earth o lord is full of thy mercy
[29:27] teach me thy statutes god bless you may
[29:30] be seated brother brian
[29:42] morning brothers and sisters
[29:45] you know every time you go through the
[29:47] psalms
[29:48] david says i thought on my way and then
[29:51] i turned my direction while i'm
[29:53] paraphrasing there
[29:55] uh if you return with me to ezekiel
[30:00] the 33rd chapter
[30:04] you know i was
[30:06] thinking this morning
[30:08] let me just read the first
[30:10] ten verses
[30:13] and it goes along with what brother
[30:15] thomas and brother brad and ministers
[30:18] have been preaching
[30:19] you know everyone's accountable you
[30:21] whether they think so or not we're all
[30:23] accountable
[30:24] again the word of the lord came onto me
[30:26] saying
[30:28] son of man speak to the children of thy
[30:30] people and say unto them when i bring
[30:33] the sword upon a land and if the people
[30:36] of the land take a man of their coast
[30:38] and set them
[30:39] for their watchmen if you look at this
[30:41] scripture here
[30:43] uh
[30:44] when
[30:44] god is speaking to ezekiel
[30:47] he its first person here his people
[30:50] as the prophet for his day
[30:52] those are the people
[30:54] his people that he was supposed to speak
[30:56] to
[30:57] in the day that he was living he goes on
[30:59] to say
[31:01] when that when he seeth the sword come
[31:03] upon the land he blows the trumpet to
[31:06] warn the people
[31:08] then whosoever heareth the sound of the
[31:10] trumpet and take not warning if the
[31:12] sword come take him away
[31:14] and take him away his blood shall be
[31:17] upon his own head so in anything we do
[31:19] in life no matter what it is
[31:22] if if you see someone doing something
[31:24] wrong you have an obligation
[31:26] to tell them
[31:27] that they're doing something wrong
[31:30] and then if they choose not to heed you
[31:32] you know whether it's in business
[31:34] whether it's on the job hey stop doing
[31:36] that that's stupid you're going to hurt
[31:38] yourself if they choose not to listen to
[31:40] you
[31:41] then that's on them that's not on you
[31:44] and he goes on to say his own head if
[31:46] you hear the sound of the trumpet and
[31:48] took not warning his blood shall be upon
[31:50] him but he that taketh warning shall
[31:52] deliver his soul and you know in
[31:55] the day that we live in right now
[31:57] there's been a lot of preaching there's
[31:59] been a lot of teaching and everyone is
[32:01] responsible right now the trump had
[32:03] sounded for the whole world that we live
[32:05] in now they have to choose to hear the
[32:08] message
[32:10] uh in the where we're at
[32:13] and he goes on he heard the sound of the
[32:15] trumpet took not warning his blood shall
[32:17] be upon him but he that taketh warning
[32:19] shall deliver his soul
[32:21] but if the watchmen see the sword come
[32:23] and blow not the trumpet and the people
[32:25] be not worn if the sword come and take
[32:28] away any person from among them
[32:30] he is taken away in his iniquity but his
[32:32] blood i will require of the watchman's
[32:35] hand and now we've had a message for the
[32:37] hour that we're living so
[32:39] you can't say that you haven't been
[32:41] warned
[32:42] it goes from the youngest to the oldest
[32:45] you know everyone's accountable for the
[32:47] measure of truth that they've heard or
[32:49] received in their life and everyone will
[32:51] be accountable on that day for that and
[32:54] i was a i was just gonna read this is a
[32:57] quote out of the uh devotional this
[32:59] morning
[33:00] but uh this is what brother branham has
[33:03] to say it's on it's tomorrow it's
[33:05] tuesday it's august 31st
[33:07] and it and it goes on they we see in the
[33:10] scriptures that when a city was built
[33:11] and of course we're not living in this
[33:13] day where they had walled cities or
[33:16] towers that everyone would run into
[33:19] when the people come to steal their
[33:21] crops or or to attack
[33:23] but he goes
[33:25] we see in the scriptures when a city was
[33:27] built first thing was built
[33:28] was the protection of that city which
[33:31] was the wall
[33:33] then to be sure that the city was
[33:35] safeguarded they had a tower built way
[33:37] high on the wall and a watchman was in
[33:39] the tower day and night well it's a
[33:41] little bit different how you have the
[33:43] five-fold ministry that's your watchman
[33:45] that's what your soul is accountable
[33:47] today in the hour that we live in
[33:50] and he goes on 24 hours he around he
[33:53] washed east north west and south because
[33:56] he's higher than the rest of the people
[33:57] he can see off his duty is to warn the
[34:00] people when he could excuse me when he
[34:03] could see
[34:04] uncommon
[34:05] judgment army's approaching spies
[34:07] slipping by
[34:08] anything coming on no matter what it was
[34:11] he reported it back to the city and he
[34:13] was a good watchman
[34:15] you know sometimes you can
[34:17] when we hear the what god is speaking to
[34:19] us sometimes we don't always hear it
[34:21] like we need to hear it and take heed to
[34:24] it in the day that we're living
[34:25] and he goes i want to say something here
[34:28] i hope you catch it in the right way do
[34:30] you mean to tell me that they would put
[34:32] a nearsighted watchman in the tower when
[34:35] this life of the city depended on it but
[34:37] you know i was thinking you know
[34:40] uh i've been i don't mean in a bad way
[34:42] but the last couple of weeks i've been
[34:45] i don't listen to the news anymore i try
[34:48] not to because i just get angry i i
[34:50] don't mean angry in a bad way i just get
[34:52] a little bit angry that the situations
[34:55] that i've said a couple of weeks ago
[34:57] it's like we're living in the 1970s
[34:59] again and i know for some of you that
[35:01] aren't old enough that doesn't mean
[35:02] anything because you didn't live in the
[35:04] 1970s but what we see going on
[35:07] in the natural out there in our country
[35:11] to me we're just going right back to
[35:13] where we were 40 years ago but in the
[35:15] church sense the church is doing the
[35:17] same thing they're not going forward in
[35:19] god anymore and they're continually
[35:21] doing the same bad things over and over
[35:24] and over again and they're not coming to
[35:26] maturity in the age that we live in and
[35:28] he goes on to say
[35:30] i hope you catch it in the right way do
[35:32] you mean to tell me that they would put
[35:34] a near side of watchmen in the tower
[35:37] excuse me
[35:39] when the life of the city depended on
[35:41] him but they put a man in there that was
[35:43] half blind certainly not
[35:45] he would put the best side of man that
[35:47] they could find out to put to put in
[35:49] there and it goes what and he as he
[35:52] explains and it goes to
[35:54] the five-fold menace
[35:56] god sets men in the age that you live to
[35:59] keep you on the straight no basically
[36:01] but you we're all individuals we have a
[36:04] choice whether we'll heed that message
[36:07] and obey it and it's it's a it's a
[36:09] relationship there between you and your
[36:12] savior between and you've got to have
[36:14] that holy spirit you've got to have that
[36:16] holy ghost abiding in your heart and
[36:18] life for you to hear the message and
[36:20] know it's the truth and then to walk in
[36:22] it and he goes on to say
[36:24] what do he i don't want to i have a
[36:26] tendency to re-read certainly not he
[36:28] would put the best side of me man that
[36:30] could find
[36:32] they put in excuse me that they put in
[36:34] there god also when he builds his city
[36:36] his church it's walled with the blood of
[36:39] his own son jesus christ and he put a
[36:41] tower on it now god has said in the
[36:43] church
[36:45] first apostles secondary prophets and
[36:47] teachers pastors and so forth god set
[36:50] him in the church
[36:52] god put him there
[36:53] excuse me
[36:54] they're qualified for the job god
[36:57] wouldn't put a man in the tower in a
[36:58] position like that
[37:00] that said the days of miracles has
[37:02] passed you know we're well put way past
[37:04] this now the days of miracles pass you
[37:07] people do things that you can't even
[37:09] find in the scriptures and think they're
[37:11] okay
[37:12] you know this is we're talking when this
[37:14] was preached we're talking 50 60 years
[37:17] ago people have gone totally off the
[37:19] deep end they're all the way on the
[37:21] other side now because
[37:23] god would put a man in position like
[37:25] that
[37:26] to be a prophet or a seer that would say
[37:28] jesus christ isn't the same yesterday
[37:31] today and forever when the bible
[37:33] declares him to be you know people don't
[37:35] even you know even in brother branham's
[37:37] day they didn't believe jesus was divine
[37:40] but in our day it's even worse than that
[37:42] they just think he's another man and his
[37:45] teachings are no better than another
[37:46] man's teaching
[37:48] god would put not put a man in a tower
[37:50] there he would preach that would preach
[37:52] a wishy-washy gospel and not tell the
[37:55] truth and warn the people of the wrath
[37:57] that is to come
[37:58] he put a man in there that would be bold
[38:01] that would have the spirit and then
[38:02] seeing the uncommon coming judgment
[38:05] regardless of what the people said he'd
[38:07] warned them anyhow cry out against it he
[38:10] doesn't put blind
[38:12] prophets in his tower he let the
[38:13] prophets and preachers that foresee the
[38:15] coming judgment and warned the people
[38:17] and i was going to
[38:19] jump over here i hope i have the right
[38:21] right spot
[38:22] here in my thompson chain reference
[38:24] bible
[38:27] you know that i say it a lot i don't
[38:28] mean to
[38:29] but like i said the only hope you have
[38:31] is in christ if you're looking for
[38:33] anything else you're going to be
[38:34] miserable on that day um
[38:37] let's
[38:39] uh
[38:41] i'll just read a couple of these
[38:42] scriptures here that it's page 1448.
[38:48] and this is just some of the uh let me
[38:50] go to this this one right here
[38:54] and he sent forth his servants to call
[38:56] them that were bidding to the wedding
[38:58] and they would not come and you know god
[39:00] if you go through the gospels he's
[39:02] he's bringing that message to the people
[39:04] of his day he's and these some of the
[39:06] scriptures that deal it
[39:09] uh romans
[39:10] uh no i don't feel like reading that
[39:12] this morning i'm trying to find the
[39:14] right spot
[39:22] i'll i'll jump up here
[39:24] uh i isaiah 55 and the first row ho
[39:28] everyone that thirst has come you to the
[39:30] waters and he said there's no money
[39:32] coming in by me hey come by wine
[39:38] and then he says and then matthew
[39:40] 22 show you therefore into the highways
[39:43] as many as you shall find and bid them
[39:45] to the marriage and then john
[39:48] i'll just leave
[39:49] i'm losing my perspective here but the
[39:51] one thing i would say this morning
[39:53] you know i said i've been angry the last
[39:55] couple of weeks and he
[39:56] but i shouldn't be angry i'll i'll be
[39:59] honest with you yesterday
[40:01] i was out on a job i don't know why i'm
[40:03] saying this i was out on a job yesterday
[40:05] this family living in this
[40:07] house they got all kinds of children and
[40:10] i spent four or five hours trying to get
[40:12] their air conditioner i mean it's
[40:14] working don't get me wrong but i don't
[40:16] know how many times i've tried something
[40:17] different just to make a piece of junk
[40:19] work
[40:20] so they have air conditioning through a
[40:22] hot weekend my point being
[40:25] is that you
[40:27] they need to start from new everything
[40:29] they need a new unit
[40:30] well we need a new heart and a new life
[40:33] you just can't keep doing the same thing
[40:35] time and time again and getting a bad
[40:37] result
[40:38] and not expect to have a bad result at
[40:41] the end so everything we do has to be
[40:43] new
[40:44] you know you have to have that
[40:45] experience with jesus christ this
[40:47] morning that you're the new man that
[40:49] everything that you do in life is
[40:51] through him brother david

[44:55] and man we just appreciate the lord
[44:58] appreciate those that are here we have
[44:59] several loud but just trust in the lord
[45:01] will come and speak to our hearts this
[45:03] morning and i was just thinking of
[45:05] brother brian was
[45:06] talking to sunday school i said you know
[45:09] uh
[45:10] it's uh
[45:12] when he was talking to the news i just
[45:14] decided that i just i can't because
[45:17] you know
[45:18] if there's one thing that frustrates me
[45:20] is someone that's just an idiot
[45:23] and that's just about what they all are
[45:25] and i thought lord
[45:28] it doesn't matter because we know the
[45:30] end of the story we know what's going to
[45:32] happen we know it's supposed to happen
[45:34] but the blessing that god has given us
[45:36] to be born in such a beautiful country
[45:38] and to have the freedom that we have
[45:40] this morning
[45:41] it does rile our inner man that
[45:44] that man's got to die because this
[45:46] morning we're going to see the king you
[45:47] believe that with all your heart and i
[45:49] thought you know all this going on and
[45:51] the sickness going on and you know
[45:53] cover's real
[45:55] my son three of my grandchildren and my
[45:57] daughter-in-law they all have it my son
[45:59] has pneumonia and he's doing a lot well
[46:02] a lot better we've been praying for him
[46:03] but you know it's it's there
[46:06] but you know i'm looking for a day

[1:11:47] amen good to be in the house of the lord
[1:11:48] this morning
[1:11:50] um definitely
[1:11:52] been a hot week and like brother butler
[1:11:54] said we're probably all tired and
[1:11:55] drained and i think someone's got
[1:11:57] headaches and probably from the heat and
[1:11:59] stress and different things so uh
[1:12:02] certainly thankful to have a a place to
[1:12:04] come in out of the heat and fellowship
[1:12:07] around the word of god
[1:12:09] um just a a couple of quick
[1:12:11] announcements on my part for this
[1:12:13] weekend i it was delegated to me and
[1:12:15] we've got some good delegators in the
[1:12:17] church and and it was delegated to me to
[1:12:20] uh to uh kind of oversee the precautions
[1:12:23] that we will take for the upcoming
[1:12:24] meetings and i did infection control uh
[1:12:28] for a couple for several years at at the
[1:12:30] nursing home and you know when you're
[1:12:32] trained to see it it's tough and people
[1:12:34] you have to explain it to people but i
[1:12:36] was trained to always see the negative
[1:12:38] and that's kind of a tough place to be
[1:12:39] in sometimes but
[1:12:41] i was trained my eye catches if i see
[1:12:44] something on the floor it's a fall
[1:12:45] hazard
[1:12:46] and if i see somebody touch their nose
[1:12:48] and touch a doorknob it's an infection
[1:12:50] hazard and you know it's just a constant
[1:12:52] thing so some of the precautions we'll
[1:12:54] take and uh why don't you have your
[1:12:55] seats for just a second if you would
[1:12:58] no no no need in standing but a couple
[1:13:00] of the precautions we're going to take
[1:13:02] and i think brother butler made mention
[1:13:03] you you know sometimes we're doing
[1:13:05] things a little different
[1:13:07] the small bags of chips so
[1:13:09] individualized
[1:13:10] the small bottle of water is
[1:13:12] individualized
[1:13:14] the drinks will be poured
[1:13:16] from somebody and we're going to take
[1:13:18] all precautions we can uh so that we're
[1:13:20] not touching a lot from an affection
[1:13:22] control perspective
[1:13:24] touching and and you know you you
[1:13:26] transmit that way we did a
[1:13:28] drill uh in nursing school and when i
[1:13:31] was a uh infection control officer but
[1:13:34] we put this uh liquid on a person's
[1:13:37] hands
[1:13:38] and then we would tell them to go wash
[1:13:39] their hands
[1:13:40] and do it like you're supposed to do the
[1:13:42] abc song you know wash your hands and
[1:13:44] scrub them in your fingernails back of
[1:13:46] the hands and then come back and i could
[1:13:48] put a black light on it and it will show
[1:13:51] what was still left there you would be
[1:13:53] amazed at what was still left on the
[1:13:55] hand
[1:13:56] and so everywhere you touch you transfer
[1:13:58] and we all know this it's just it's just
[1:14:01] the way germs and stuff work so
[1:14:04] we're going to take the precautions that
[1:14:05] we can wash your hands
[1:14:07] i know it was mentioned to me to say
[1:14:09] something about uh you know try not to
[1:14:11] encourage people to shake hands you know
[1:14:14] it's that's tough it's tough in church
[1:14:16] because you want to greet people and you
[1:14:18] want to shake hands but you know uh
[1:14:21] really if you know some if you
[1:14:24] throw out your hand to somebody it's
[1:14:26] instinct to shake it and some people may
[1:14:28] be offended by that at this point where
[1:14:30] we're at so uh just be cautious of those
[1:14:33] things um
[1:14:35] you know and respect each other space i
[1:14:38] guess it will be the next thing but
[1:14:40] outside of that we're trusting god for
[1:14:42] great meetings
[1:14:43] um you know no virus is going to uh
[1:14:46] stop the power of god
[1:14:48] um he knows all things and he knew it
[1:14:51] before the beginning so
[1:14:53] it's all in control uh you know there's
[1:14:55] no chaos involved around it it's all
[1:14:57] under control and uh just pray for those
[1:15:00] that has it it is real uh you know i
[1:15:02] just seen a video yesterday a
[1:15:05] friend of mine who was a coach of mine
[1:15:08] when i was in high school and i tell you
[1:15:09] what he was about as athletic and and we
[1:15:12] thought he walked on water as far as
[1:15:13] playing baseball you know he was great
[1:15:15] and just a real athlete and he's 52 now
[1:15:18] i think but he's got cove with terrible
[1:15:21] badge taking transfusions chris shortens
[1:15:23] who it is you may know remember him he's
[1:15:25] a pastor of a church up around glasgow
[1:15:28] but you know he's uh he can't hardly
[1:15:31] breathe he can't hardly get around and
[1:15:33] we're talking about a picture of health
[1:15:35] so
[1:15:36] it's affected his blood pressure it's
[1:15:37] affected his blood sugar so it's real
[1:15:39] and it's something that we have to be
[1:15:42] uh mindful of but
[1:15:44] like i said outside that looking forward
[1:15:45] to great meetings and i won't keep on
[1:15:47] about that so if you would stand with me
[1:15:49] we'll turn
[1:15:50] this morning
[1:15:52] into the book of ephesians
[1:15:58] i'll take a little thought the familiar
[1:16:00] thought
[1:16:02] ephesians 6
[1:16:04] 10
[1:16:10] ephesians 6 and 10
[1:16:12] i'm going to look at the clock brother
[1:16:13] butler because when we start change
[1:16:15] sunday schools i can't tell what time i
[1:16:17] start when i stop so
[1:16:19] i don't want to just keep going if if if
[1:16:22] we're done we're done so
[1:16:24] ephesians 6 and 10 paul here i'm just
[1:16:27] thankful for paul you know i was
[1:16:30] thinking about paul earlier in the week
[1:16:31] and
[1:16:32] saw paul and
[1:16:34] and uh you know he made a conversion for
[1:16:36] christ
[1:16:37] and you know paul's known multiple times
[1:16:39] in the bible was the apostle to the
[1:16:41] gentiles so without paul making a
[1:16:42] conversion where would we be
[1:16:44] i think god had it all in control but it
[1:16:46] makes you think about you know brother
[1:16:48] balor was speaking about gifts and
[1:16:49] callings and and doing for christ what
[1:16:51] if paul hadn't done for christ or saul i
[1:16:53] should say and and took the conversion
[1:16:55] so something really to think about there
[1:16:57] and but we're thankful for paul
[1:16:59] and he says here finally my brethren be
[1:17:01] strong in the lord and in the power of
[1:17:03] his might put on the whole armor of god
[1:17:05] that you may be able to stand against
[1:17:07] the wiles
[1:17:08] of the devil for we wrestle not against
[1:17:11] flesh and blood
[1:17:12] but against principalities against
[1:17:15] powers against the rulers of the
[1:17:17] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:17:19] wickedness in high places
[1:17:21] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:17:24] of god that you may be able to withstand
[1:17:27] in the evil day
[1:17:28] and having done all to stand
[1:17:31] through thick and thin through your ups
[1:17:33] and downs and your goods your bads and
[1:17:35] your mountains and your valleys after
[1:17:36] you've done all to stand what's to say
[1:17:38] stand therefore
[1:17:40] stand therefore having your loins gird
[1:17:42] about with truth in heaven on the breast
[1:17:45] breastplate of righteousness and your
[1:17:47] feet shod with the preparation of the
[1:17:49] gospel of peace
[1:17:50] above all taking the shield of faith
[1:17:52] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[1:17:54] the fiery darts of the wicked and take
[1:17:57] the helmet of salvation the sword of the
[1:18:00] spirit which is the word of god
[1:18:03] praying always with prayer and
[1:18:05] supplication in the spirit and watching
[1:18:07] there unto all with all pers
[1:18:09] perseverance and supplication for all
[1:18:11] the saints let's just pray heavenly
[1:18:13] father we thank you lord for this day
[1:18:15] you've given us for the opportunity to
[1:18:18] come out and fellowship around your word
[1:18:19] and we see you see the believers you see
[1:18:22] the the ones who's come out this morning
[1:18:24] to
[1:18:25] have you speak to their hearts lord and
[1:18:26] we trust lord that they came with that
[1:18:28] purpose in mind lord that
[1:18:30] whatever they have need in their life
[1:18:31] lord that you would just meet that need
[1:18:33] this morning and and lord i raise my
[1:18:35] hand and say i'm a needy person this
[1:18:36] morning lord and i need more of you and
[1:18:38] i i need you to speak to my heart this
[1:18:40] morning to draw me closer to you and
[1:18:42] help me to recognize uh the battle that
[1:18:44] we're in this morning lord we just want
[1:18:46] to tell you we love you we appreciate
[1:18:48] you and we just asked your blessings
[1:18:49] upon the reading of the word in jesus
[1:18:51] name amen you can be seated
[1:18:54] also if you want to turn to second
[1:18:56] corinthians
[1:18:57] 10
[1:19:01] paul's speaking here and he says
[1:19:03] now i paul myself beseech you by the
[1:19:06] meekness and gentleness of christ who in
[1:19:09] presence
[1:19:10] and base among you
[1:19:12] but being absent and bold towards you
[1:19:14] but i beseech you that i may not that i
[1:19:16] may not be bold when i'm present with
[1:19:18] the confidence wherewith i think to be
[1:19:20] bold against some which think of us as
[1:19:22] if we walked according to flesh
[1:19:25] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[1:19:26] not war after the flesh for the weapons
[1:19:29] of our warfare are not carnal but mighty
[1:19:32] through god and the pulling down of
[1:19:34] strongholds
[1:19:35] so as i was looking at this and i was
[1:19:37] thinking
[1:19:38] if i speak to you this morning if we
[1:19:40] were to title it i would
[1:19:42] title it the unseen warfare
[1:19:44] uh you know in my whole life i i think
[1:19:47] and i've always been kind of intrigued
[1:19:48] with the unseen world i've always uh
[1:19:52] been intrigued with what goes on around
[1:19:54] our lives and and in our jobs and our
[1:19:57] homes and our families and it's actually
[1:19:59] stuff that's that's not visibly seen
[1:20:01] with our eyes
[1:20:03] but uh
[1:20:04] and yet it controls most of the actions
[1:20:06] or the reactions in our life
[1:20:09] the unseen world the unseen that you
[1:20:11] can't see the universe i always wonder
[1:20:13] what's just beyond that last star
[1:20:15] there's something else out there
[1:20:17] what's beyond the depths of the ocean
[1:20:20] what other life is down there there's
[1:20:21] something down there so the example i
[1:20:24] would give you this morning for the
[1:20:25] unseen world and how it affects us is
[1:20:27] covered 19.
[1:20:29] somebody show me kobe 18.
[1:20:32] show me kobe 19. i want to see cobia 19
[1:20:35] placed upon this pulpit
[1:20:37] you can't see it it's there
[1:20:39] not saying it's here but
[1:20:41] in reality it's there its own surfaces
[1:20:43] its own places we see the out the
[1:20:45] outcomes of it we see the symptoms the
[1:20:47] signs we see what happens with the
[1:20:50] unseen it's always there but a step
[1:20:52] beyond microbiology if we were to say
[1:20:54] would be in the spiritual realm
[1:20:56] and when we look into the spiritual
[1:20:58] realm and and even though we can't see
[1:21:00] it brothers and sisters there's a heated
[1:21:01] battle
[1:21:02] taking place this morning there is a
[1:21:05] heated battle
[1:21:06] taking place this morning and in this
[1:21:08] heated battle
[1:21:09] it's deciding what is controlling you
[1:21:13] what is controlling me
[1:21:15] that's what's happening in this battle
[1:21:17] that we can't see
[1:21:18] we can't see this battle that's taking
[1:21:20] place
[1:21:21] but it's there
[1:21:24] listen to this
[1:21:25] brother branham says grant lord that
[1:21:28] something will be said tonight
[1:21:30] or done that will cause the wayward to
[1:21:32] turn to christ for we believe we feel
[1:21:34] pressed in the spirit
[1:21:36] that great judgments
[1:21:38] are upon these lands in the last days
[1:21:41] plagues
[1:21:43] diseased germs already bred up
[1:21:47] yeah 1950
[1:21:50] diseased germs it's already bred up to
[1:21:52] be scattered throughout the nations
[1:21:56] the next statement says no doctor even
[1:21:59] know how to take hold of it
[1:22:02] in that astonishing quote 1950 there's
[1:22:06] germs being bred up that he's saying are
[1:22:07] prepared to be scattered across the
[1:22:09] nation
[1:22:10] and doctors can't
[1:22:12] take a hold of it let me tell you we're
[1:22:14] living in a day with technology and
[1:22:16] knowledge and wisdom and we've got some
[1:22:18] of the best trained doctors that the
[1:22:19] world has ever seen and they don't know
[1:22:21] what to do with them
[1:22:25] wear a mask
[1:22:27] get a vaccine don't get a vaccine the
[1:22:29] vaccine works the vaccine don't work you
[1:22:31] can still get sick you might kill
[1:22:32] somebody might spread it they don't know
[1:22:34] what to say
[1:22:37] and i'm not getting political here but
[1:22:39] i'm just telling you what he said
[1:22:41] and
[1:22:42] and he says when nations
[1:22:44] are breeding germs together
[1:22:47] to burst them in bombs and millions will
[1:22:49] die in hours over it
[1:22:54] yeah he said but i'm so thankful and
[1:22:56] here's where we can be thankful
[1:22:59] i'm so thankful he says that when the
[1:23:01] destroying angel went forth
[1:23:04] you said touch not nine that have to
[1:23:06] seal the father upon their foreheads
[1:23:09] do you see how important it is to know
[1:23:11] where you stand in this unseen world
[1:23:14] where do you stand this morning in the
[1:23:15] unseen world he said where the where the
[1:23:18] sacrificial lamb has been has been
[1:23:20] killed and we take this body under the
[1:23:22] blood god we're waiting for the midnight
[1:23:24] hour to come and we march out
[1:23:27] and it's called in these nights of the
[1:23:29] promised land and we're
[1:23:30] girded and shot with the gospel of peace
[1:23:32] with the full armor the whole armor of
[1:23:34] the gospel going forward
[1:23:37] and see the world is in fear
[1:23:42] the world is it does not know what to do
[1:23:44] right now
[1:23:46] they're relying upon cnn and fox news
[1:23:51] well i'm sorry
[1:23:53] that's not going to cut it but he says
[1:23:55] here we are we're prepared and we're
[1:23:58] known at the great chief captain the one
[1:24:00] that met joshua after crossing the river
[1:24:03] he said he knows where he's leading you
[1:24:08] god is good
[1:24:10] he says so here we are listen to this
[1:24:12] and we know tonight the morning star is
[1:24:15] over us the banners are gleaming the
[1:24:17] colors are streaming and we're bound to
[1:24:19] win
[1:24:21] don't you like that this morning we're
[1:24:23] bound to win
[1:24:24] we're bound to win
[1:24:27] he says
[1:24:28] if we trust in him who will not fail us
[1:24:32] he says listen now grant it tonight
[1:24:34] listen he says many things may be done
[1:24:37] send your spirit give people faith
[1:24:40] he says sometimes it startles
[1:24:44] why does it hurt alone
[1:24:46] because they can't see it
[1:24:48] and all of a sudden this faith is put
[1:24:50] upon them and the prophet's praying that
[1:24:51] this faith would come down and it comes
[1:24:53] down upon him he says sometimes sorrows
[1:24:55] and they realize the presence of the
[1:24:57] great thing
[1:25:00] wow
[1:25:01] i want to live in such a place that i'm
[1:25:03] able through jehovah through god
[1:25:05] almighty that i can recognize that the
[1:25:07] holy spirit is here and the holy spirit
[1:25:09] is leading and guiding and taking care
[1:25:11] of us because brothers and sisters i
[1:25:12] want to tell you we are in a
[1:25:13] battleground
[1:25:15] we were in a battleground this morning
[1:25:17] and the problem said we didn't come for
[1:25:18] a picnic
[1:25:19] we didn't come for a picnic we got on
[1:25:21] the battleground
[1:25:23] we're fighting the enemy this morning
[1:25:26] do you think about that
[1:25:28] we're fighting an enemy that comes
[1:25:30] straight about the pits of hell and it's
[1:25:33] been unleashed upon this he said we're
[1:25:35] not here to eat cookies
[1:25:41] you didn't get up this morning your feet
[1:25:43] hit the floor so i'm gonna go to church
[1:25:44] for a for dinner for a cookie for a meal
[1:25:48] now you come here this morning to see
[1:25:49] what god needed out of you and what you
[1:25:51] could do that god could use you in a
[1:25:53] greater way
[1:25:54] and that you could realize who you are
[1:25:56] this morning you if you come here to
[1:25:58] look pretty
[1:26:00] if you put your armor on this morning to
[1:26:02] come and see who would adore you and
[1:26:04] admire you and and see who you are and
[1:26:07] how great it you could be through
[1:26:09] ambition
[1:26:10] you're at the wrong place
[1:26:13] because there is a war that's raging
[1:26:15] this morning
[1:26:16] soldiers are giving their weapons in
[1:26:18] battle
[1:26:19] for a purpose they're giving their their
[1:26:22] their weapons and their shields and for
[1:26:24] a purpose it's not to look pretty
[1:26:27] oh they may have parades they may have
[1:26:29] this or that but when they go into the
[1:26:30] battlefield and the fire is raging
[1:26:33] they've got a weapon that is there ready
[1:26:35] to be used
[1:26:36] it's a fully functioning weapon
[1:26:40] and brothers and sisters sometimes we as
[1:26:41] christians
[1:26:43] we're looked down upon
[1:26:46] we're made fun of
[1:26:49] but on the inside we come as warriors
[1:26:52] on the inside we come as warriors we're
[1:26:54] because we've been sprinkled in the
[1:26:56] blood and that old rugged cross that's
[1:26:57] gone before us
[1:26:59] it's led the way and it showed the way
[1:27:01] that we could be warriors and soldiers
[1:27:03] and on our road to victory this morning
[1:27:06] so i don't care what the devil says
[1:27:08] the devil's going to come to you as
[1:27:10] parents and they're going to come to you
[1:27:12] and he's going to say your children
[1:27:13] can't be saved
[1:27:15] he's going to tell you that your
[1:27:16] children are lost he's going to tell you
[1:27:18] you can't have peace he's going to tell
[1:27:20] you as a young person that you can't
[1:27:21] have joy that you can't have happiness
[1:27:24] that's what the devil is going to tell
[1:27:25] you but god says the field
[1:27:28] belongs to us
[1:27:30] that the field belongs to us the devil's
[1:27:33] going to say you can't have your healing
[1:27:35] you can't get over that headache sister
[1:27:36] that's what the devil's going to tell
[1:27:38] you you can't get over these things you
[1:27:40] can't have your healing you can't have
[1:27:41] your security you can't have financial
[1:27:42] peace you can't have all these things
[1:27:44] the goodness that god has given us
[1:27:46] but god says footsteps means possession
[1:27:50] and when the children of israel were
[1:27:52] marching into the promised land they
[1:27:54] told
[1:27:54] said keep marching
[1:27:57] keep
[1:27:58] marching
[1:28:00] why keep marching because every time
[1:28:02] they moved up an inch they gave a little
[1:28:04] bit of more land
[1:28:06] every time brother says that's what we
[1:28:07] got to do is keep marching into victory
[1:28:10] nobody ever said there's going to be
[1:28:11] anything easy about it
[1:28:18] let me tell you there's people sitting
[1:28:19] here this morning
[1:28:22] sitting here this morning
[1:28:24] that have been through the battles

[1:28:31] they've been through the battles of life
[1:28:32] and they have the scars to prove it
[1:28:35] if we could see
[1:28:37] the unseen through our eyes and look
[1:28:39] into the hearts of some of the people
[1:28:40] sitting in this building tonight you
[1:28:42] would see scars of heartache
[1:28:44] scars of pain scars of agony scars of
[1:28:47] defeat scars of depression scars of fear
[1:28:53] they've been through it
[1:28:58] there's some of us sitting here this
[1:28:59] morning

[1:29:08] it maybe the pastor don't see it
[1:29:12] you know people's good at disguising
[1:29:15] people's real good at disguising what's
[1:29:16] going on in their life
[1:29:18] and hiding what's going on but there's
[1:29:20] people sitting here no doubt today
[1:29:21] that's going through things in the
[1:29:23] battle of life right now that satan is
[1:29:25] throwing dark after dark left aft right

[1:30:27] when you're going to look him eyeball to
[1:30:28] eyeball
[1:30:31] and you're going to have to make a
[1:30:32] decision
[1:30:33] are you going to run
[1:30:35] are you going to cow down or are you
[1:30:37] going to stand and fight and take the
[1:30:38] victory
[1:30:40] you see satan is always studying
[1:30:43] he don't have nothing else to do in life
[1:30:47] you know what his number one priority is
[1:30:50] you
[1:30:53] you
[1:30:55] he's not worried about brother brother
[1:30:56] byler
[1:30:58] he's worried about you
[1:31:00] he's not worried about aaron he's
[1:31:01] worried about sister becky
[1:31:03] you see what i mean
[1:31:04] he's individualized
[1:31:07] and he's got all of his sights on you
[1:31:08] and i i thought about this some time ago
[1:31:11] years ago and i thought you know he's
[1:31:13] got a crosshair on each and ever
[1:31:16] through one set of eyes
[1:31:21] you're in his crosshair this morning if
[1:31:24] you're a christian and you proclaim
[1:31:26] jesus christ as your savior then you are
[1:31:29] in satan's crosshairs
[1:31:34] it's like a game of chess
[1:31:37] now i'm not
[1:31:38] i don't know much about chess
[1:31:43] i don't know nothing about chess
[1:31:47] but what little i do know
[1:31:50] is when it comes down to it
[1:31:53] when the king on either side of the
[1:31:54] board can move no
[1:31:56] more
[1:31:58] once that king is trapped
[1:32:01] the winning side declares checkmate
[1:32:05] and the game's over is that right you
[1:32:08] chest people is that right
[1:32:10] once the king can't move no more and
[1:32:11] he's stuck and it's over he's done
[1:32:14] checkmate you lose
[1:32:16] well there's a painting
[1:32:19] that's hung in the louvre
[1:32:20] in the museum in paris
[1:32:22] and it's known as checkmate
[1:32:25] and in this painting
[1:32:26] it depicts two chess players
[1:32:29] and on one side of the chess board is
[1:32:31] satan
[1:32:33] and satan is sitting there and he
[1:32:34] appears arrogant
[1:32:36] and he's confident
[1:32:38] and he knows that he's got the game in
[1:32:40] his hand
[1:32:41] and he's sitting there you can look at i
[1:32:43] looked it up on the internet looked at
[1:32:45] the picture there and i thought wow what
[1:32:46] a depiction of this game of chess
[1:32:49] because on the other side of the board
[1:32:51] here is a person that's frantic
[1:32:53] and they're frightened
[1:32:55] and and they're frustrated because they
[1:32:57] feel defeated and they know if satan
[1:32:59] wins this game of chess he wins their
[1:33:01] soul
[1:33:03] you ever feel like you're in a game of
[1:33:05] life
[1:33:09] a game of life
[1:33:10] when you don't know what where you're
[1:33:13] going to end up where the battle is
[1:33:14] going to stop
[1:33:15] what the next move is
[1:33:18] but here in this painting that's hanging
[1:33:20] on the wall and this is supposed to be a
[1:33:22] factual legend here
[1:33:24] there was a grand master chess player
[1:33:27] that happened to be walking through the
[1:33:28] move looking at the museum artifacts the
[1:33:31] the paintings the mona lisa and so and
[1:33:33] he comes up and he begins to look at
[1:33:35] this chess board
[1:33:37] and he sees satan and all of his
[1:33:39] arrogance you know he's pretty arrogant
[1:33:42] satan's pretty confident he don't ever
[1:33:44] go into a battle thinking he's going to
[1:33:45] lose
[1:33:48] and so he he goes
[1:33:49] in this grand chest master
[1:33:52] looks up at this pain and begins to look
[1:33:53] and say
[1:33:55] studying it
[1:33:57] and he can't take his eyes off of it
[1:33:59] and he studies it
[1:34:01] and he studies
[1:34:04] and as he's looking at it
[1:34:06] he notices something surprising
[1:34:09] and he calls the curator of the museum
[1:34:11] museum and says come here come here
[1:34:13] do you have a chess board
[1:34:15] he said well i probably got one in the
[1:34:16] office well can you go get it so he goes
[1:34:19] and gets it he brings out and sets up
[1:34:20] this chess board and this chess grand
[1:34:22] master begins to look at the painting
[1:34:24] and he puts piece by piece and he's
[1:34:26] looking and he's matching up the sides
[1:34:27] and looking at the opponents and he's
[1:34:29] matching all these pieces up and then he
[1:34:30] begins out jubilation he begins to shout
[1:34:32] and say look at this
[1:34:34] the depiction is wrong
[1:34:36] satan's not winning he just thinks he's
[1:34:39] winning this guy who is beat and
[1:34:41] defeated and looks like he's he has one
[1:34:44] more move that beat satan out of the
[1:34:46] board
[1:34:49] brothers and sisters
[1:34:51] what a depiction
[1:34:53] how that we can let things get such an
[1:34:55] image in our mind that we can't even see
[1:34:57] what's before
[1:34:59] and here this young player wasn't his
[1:35:01] pitcher
[1:35:02] it wasn't checkmate
[1:35:05] it wasn't check me he had the ability to
[1:35:07] feed satan
[1:35:09] and that's the way it is in our lives
[1:35:10] sometimes we feel down we feel defeated
[1:35:12] we feel depressed we feel like we're in
[1:35:14] a corner with no move left
[1:35:18] you ever been there
[1:35:20] and you feel like you can't move any
[1:35:22] direction and we consider this world a
[1:35:24] mess if you ask anybody right now this
[1:35:26] world's a mess it's in war it's in
[1:35:28] violence
[1:35:31] we have a pandemic
[1:35:34] we have unemployment
[1:35:38] it causes struggling marriages
[1:35:42] causing kids not to go to school
[1:35:45] causing kids to be socially distancing
[1:35:47] from all their friends and all they know
[1:35:49] is a young person
[1:35:50] i can't imagine growing up with nobody
[1:35:52] around
[1:35:54] but our kids are growing up that way
[1:35:56] you got unemployment depression
[1:35:58] isolation you know we're not made to be
[1:36:00] isolated
[1:36:03] we're not made to be tucked away and
[1:36:05] isolated we're made to fellowship
[1:36:09] but here you see this this isolation and
[1:36:12] inflation and it goes on and on and on
[1:36:16] and it's easy for us to become this
[1:36:18] illusion
[1:36:20] in our minds that we can't see the
[1:36:22] picture and we begin to feel lost
[1:36:25] and then we begin to look for direction
[1:36:26] and sometimes we end up in the wrong
[1:36:28] place but if we would just realize that
[1:36:30] it looks like checkmate but fear not the
[1:36:32] game's not over because the king of king
[1:36:34] has another move
[1:36:38] this is not new to god
[1:36:41] it may it may scare us it might give us
[1:36:43] fear
[1:36:46] anxiety
[1:36:49] not knowing what tomorrow but this is
[1:36:50] not new to god he's not called aware
[1:36:53] of the situation in your life
[1:36:57] denominational groups
[1:37:00] are beginning to look
[1:37:02] and they're beginning to see
[1:37:04] what we've been saying for years
[1:37:07] that it's rotten to the core
[1:37:10] i was i was just amazed
[1:37:12] at some of the comments that i seen on
[1:37:14] facebook of some some
[1:37:17] denominational
[1:37:19] groups
[1:37:20] and they had been out to
[1:37:22] i guess go to shop or whatever
[1:37:25] and they were just astonished
[1:37:27] at the pollution
[1:37:29] the vulgarity
[1:37:32] in nashville tennessee and i think where
[1:37:34] you been i seen that when i was 16 years
[1:37:36] old
[1:37:40] but something has something has happened
[1:37:43] and i told joyce we were talking one day
[1:37:45] and i said you know what it's just
[1:37:46] amazing at how deceitful
[1:37:48] and how sly satan is
[1:37:52] you know back in 1906
[1:37:56] april the 9th there was azusa street
[1:37:58] meetings
[1:37:59] the azusa street revival meetings began
[1:38:02] to sweep across the nation
[1:38:04] well it wasn't long after that in 1909 a
[1:38:08] prophet of god was born
[1:38:11] so something had to happen to
[1:38:14] combat this movement of god
[1:38:16] that's sweeping across the land
[1:38:19] are you with me
[1:38:20] because anytime there's a battle between
[1:38:23] good and evil it's going to come down to
[1:38:26] modern day it's going to come right down
[1:38:27] there in our front door
[1:38:32] and this movement happened over time
[1:38:34] over and over and over
[1:38:36] and we begin to look at god here
[1:38:39] and i think about this azusa street
[1:38:41] revival
[1:38:42] and if we were to go back and look i
[1:38:44] told joe as i said if we were to go back
[1:38:45] and look at pictures
[1:38:48] and video
[1:38:50] of the life
[1:38:52] of people in 1906
[1:38:57] what would you see
[1:39:00] and i didn't timeline at all but i
[1:39:02] thought this is how sly the devil is
[1:39:08] i would i would venture to say that in
[1:39:10] 1906
[1:39:11] if a woman was in a bathing suit she
[1:39:13] would be put in prison
[1:39:16] i would venture to say that
[1:39:19] because it was so out of the ordinary
[1:39:22] it was not something that was accepted
[1:39:24] she would have been considered insane
[1:39:25] they would have put her in an insane
[1:39:27] asylum
[1:39:30] but what happened
[1:39:31] slowly
[1:39:34] year by year
[1:39:36] by year
[1:39:38] a little more
[1:39:39] a little less i should say
[1:39:41] a little less
[1:39:45] alcohol became big you had the
[1:39:47] prohibition coming on
[1:39:51] we got god moving in the spirit and we
[1:39:53] got people moving in the spirit
[1:39:56] if you know what i mean
[1:39:58] and it becomes it began to become
[1:40:00] standard
[1:40:02] and what is standard today
[1:40:05] would have had you thrown in prison
[1:40:09] in 1906
[1:40:16] i tell you i was about as nervous as
[1:40:18] i've been in a while to preach this
[1:40:20] message because i knew i was exposing
[1:40:22] satan today
[1:40:24] i knew that i was going to
[1:40:26] tell everybody in this building what
[1:40:28] satan is how he operates how he moves
[1:40:30] his motives his intentions
[1:40:34] i hope you're listening because brothers
[1:40:36] and sisters the spiritual warfare has
[1:40:38] been going on from the very beginning
[1:40:40] god created the heavens and the earth
[1:40:42] and the angels and what happens lucifer
[1:40:47] he begins to get jealous
[1:40:49] and lucifer comes down there and he
[1:40:51] begins to talk to the other angels
[1:40:54] the very angels that god created and he
[1:40:56] convinces brothers and sisters one-third
[1:40:58] of the angels to fall down with him and
[1:41:02] and go against god through jealousy
[1:41:06] and we act like satan's no big deal let
[1:41:08] me tell you if he can convince one-third
[1:41:10] of god's angels
[1:41:12] what can he talk you into
[1:41:18] so lucifer was thrown out of heaven
[1:41:24] and it looks like god's been defeated
[1:41:26] now god says i tell you what i'm going
[1:41:28] to do i'm going to make
[1:41:29] create a man in my own image
[1:41:31] i'm going to create a man in my own
[1:41:32] likeness
[1:41:34] satan says
[1:41:36] that's a good move god
[1:41:38] that's a good move
[1:41:43] so what does satan do
[1:41:46] surely eve
[1:41:50] surely
[1:41:52] you won't die
[1:41:55] surely you won't die what's he doing
[1:41:57] he's taking the next move into his hand
[1:41:59] and he adam and eve to fall the garden
[1:42:02] of eden allow him control now of the
[1:42:04] earth
[1:42:08] looks like god's down again doesn't it
[1:42:13] god says i'll tell you what i'm going to
[1:42:14] do
[1:42:16] i'm going to get me
[1:42:18] a way of redemption
[1:42:20] and god goes out there and he takes this
[1:42:22] little lamb
[1:42:23] and he slays the lamb and he throws
[1:42:25] those bloody lambskins at adam and eve
[1:42:29] and the prophet said he told him to put
[1:42:30] him on and he said he could see those
[1:42:32] lambskins bloody hitting against their
[1:42:34] thighs but what was it was redemption so
[1:42:36] that god so they could have a way back
[1:42:38] into the garden to talk to god
[1:42:41] that's how good god is
[1:42:48] satan didn't quit
[1:42:52] satan says
[1:42:53] come here cain
[1:42:57] you've been watching this deal with abel
[1:43:01] how could god favor him so much more
[1:43:03] than you
[1:43:05] how can god favor abel so much more than
[1:43:07] you how do you stand that
[1:43:12] i guess nobody's ever had a jealous
[1:43:14] spirit before
[1:43:16] [Applause]
[1:43:18] come on
[1:43:19] [Applause]
[1:43:21] we're human
[1:43:25] my wings hadn't sprouted yet
[1:43:30] how can you stand able
[1:43:32] look at you kane you work so hard you
[1:43:34] make such a beautiful presentation you
[1:43:37] sweat you labor you work so hard and
[1:43:39] still it's not good enough for god
[1:43:44] i tell you what do cane
[1:43:46] why don't you slip on out in the field
[1:43:47] when nobody's around
[1:43:51] in the secret of your own domain
[1:43:55] and get rid of him
[1:43:57] just get rid of him just get rid of the
[1:44:00] problem
[1:44:03] god's
[1:44:07] severed
[1:44:10] do you realize that
[1:44:12] so what does god do
[1:44:14] i won't be defeated
[1:44:16] so god then
[1:44:18] brings up seth
[1:44:21] and you know we often seth is so
[1:44:23] overlooked in the bible very rarely
[1:44:25] preached on very rarely talked about but
[1:44:26] do you realize that god brought self up
[1:44:28] so that man could then be calling on the
[1:44:31] lord again
[1:44:32] and there was the lineage of god coming
[1:44:34] right back and brothers and sisters this
[1:44:35] goes on and on back and forth over and
[1:44:37] over all through the old testament that
[1:44:39] nimrod and abraham and pharaoh and moses
[1:44:42] on and on and on
[1:44:44] and the apostle paul looks back at this
[1:44:46] and he understands that we as christians
[1:44:49] we as christians are engaged in that
[1:44:51] spiritual war
[1:44:54] just like our natural soldiers
[1:44:57] are engaged in a natural war
[1:45:00] it's the same kind of battle different
[1:45:01] front
[1:45:03] and he understands that we're fighting a
[1:45:05] real enemy
[1:45:07] yeah
[1:45:08] and this is where we get a little bit
[1:45:09] hairy at times because nobody wants to
[1:45:12] talk about the devil
[1:45:18] nobody wants to talk about him
[1:45:21] you know it's it's great when we come to
[1:45:22] church and we hear about the word we
[1:45:24] hear the word of god we hear about the
[1:45:25] overcoming power of god we hear
[1:45:27] the greatness of god we hear the
[1:45:29] salvation of god we hear the healing of
[1:45:31] god
[1:45:32] but we forget the other side of the
[1:45:34] story
[1:45:36] and this battle is raging back and forth
[1:45:38] and satan is committed
[1:45:41] he's committed to the cause
[1:45:44] and that made me think about this
[1:45:45] taliban people
[1:45:48] brother brian tell me if i'm wrong are
[1:45:49] they committed to their calls
[1:45:52] they are committed to their calls
[1:45:53] they'll die for their cause they'll do
[1:45:55] whatever it takes to get to the point of
[1:45:57] their cause and that's the way
[1:45:59] satan is
[1:46:02] there was a poll taken
[1:46:05] there was a poll taken and
[1:46:07] they were asking people about
[1:46:09] the reality of satan in their life
[1:46:16] sixty percent
[1:46:18] sixty percent of americans
[1:46:21] believe that the devil or satan is not
[1:46:24] an actual living thing but simply a
[1:46:27] symbol
[1:46:30] that was in 1966.
[1:46:35] where are people at today
[1:46:37] let me tell you we better realize and
[1:46:39] make no mistake about it because the
[1:46:41] devil is real
[1:46:43] demons are real i've come face to face
[1:46:46] with it only one time and i don't ask
[1:46:48] for it again
[1:46:53] i told the story years ago
[1:46:57] i think it scared adriana and austin
[1:47:01] i quit telling it because my kids were
[1:47:04] old enough to understand
[1:47:07] but it's real
[1:47:12] plug your kids ears if you don't want
[1:47:13] them to hear it
[1:47:16] but when i was young i began to battle
[1:47:18] back and forth i was battling whether or
[1:47:20] not
[1:47:22] if i was going to preach and god was
[1:47:25] calling me to come and preach and god
[1:47:26] was calling me to do this and i i was
[1:47:29] fighting with all i had within me
[1:47:31] and i'd done this for a while and time
[1:47:33] went on and time went on and finally i'd
[1:47:35] made a commitment i'll say god i'm gonna
[1:47:37] do it
[1:47:38] i'll do whatever you want me to do
[1:47:41] and we were in the in our old house
[1:47:44] i never told this story because it
[1:47:46] happened
[1:47:47] originated upstairs where the kids slept
[1:47:51] i didn't want him sleeping with me so i
[1:47:52] never told him
[1:47:56] but i was laying there one night
[1:48:01] and i woke up
[1:48:03] laying flat on my back
[1:48:05] joist was asleep
[1:48:07] and i hear footsteps
[1:48:11] just as plain as day walking in the loft
[1:48:14] above our bedroom
[1:48:16] and you know the sounds of your house
[1:48:17] you know what kind of noise the creaks
[1:48:19] and noises your house makes this was not
[1:48:21] anything that i'd ever heard somebody
[1:48:23] was in my house
[1:48:26] and right about the time when i thought
[1:48:27] i'm fixing to get up and see what's
[1:48:29] going on i was paralyzed
[1:48:32] literally
[1:48:34] i could not move
[1:48:35] i tried to pry myself up off the bed
[1:48:39] i tried to put my feet up on the floor
[1:48:41] and nothing would happen
[1:48:43] but i could hear slowly these steps
[1:48:45] coming down the stairs
[1:48:50] and you think well you were just
[1:48:51] dreaming i wasn't dreaming
[1:48:53] i'm telling you i wasn't dreaming
[1:48:56] and slowly out of the side of my face i
[1:48:58] was pinned it felt pinned to the bed
[1:49:02] and slowly out of the side of my eyes
[1:49:04] the corner of my eyes i see this dark
[1:49:06] shadow
[1:49:09] and it comes slowly through the room
[1:49:11] around the side of the bed come down to
[1:49:14] the foot of the bed
[1:49:16] and as i'm looking up over the foot of
[1:49:17] my bed i see this just
[1:49:20] black dark shadow image and i'm i'm
[1:49:23] wanting to cry
[1:49:25] i want to scream i want to run
[1:49:28] i want to do everything i can possibly
[1:49:30] do
[1:49:31] but i'm stuck
[1:49:33] and as it comes up over the top
[1:49:36] the foot of the bed and begins to look
[1:49:37] down upon me and it's like it was a
[1:49:40] piercing darkness looking down upon me
[1:49:44] i couldn't breathe
[1:49:46] i thought i'm going to die
[1:49:50] and it's as real today to me as it was
[1:49:52] the day it happened
[1:49:54] and i can remember that feeling of pain
[1:49:56] and pressure and fear and i look at the
[1:49:58] shadow over top of me and the only thing
[1:50:00] that comes to my mind is jesus
[1:50:04] and i say it with all it's in me jesus
[1:50:07] and just like that it was gone
[1:50:11] but it made a believer out of me
[1:50:14] i knew that there's a realm on the other
[1:50:16] side
[1:50:17] there is a reality
[1:50:20] of what's happening on the other side
[1:50:23] you know somebody once said that
[1:50:26] the devil's cleverest trick is to make
[1:50:28] people believe that it doesn't exist
[1:50:36] think about that
[1:50:39] if you don't think he if you don't take
[1:50:41] him serious
[1:50:43] what have you got to fear
[1:50:47] not a thing
[1:50:50] another guy said the devil may be out of
[1:50:53] out of fashion for some but he's not out
[1:50:55] of business
[1:50:59] they don't want to think about satan
[1:51:00] they don't want to see him they don't
[1:51:01] want to know him
[1:51:03] but yet he's still
[1:51:04] working billy sunday you know brother
[1:51:07] brown talked a lot about billy sunday
[1:51:10] the evangelist
[1:51:11] and he said i know that the devil is
[1:51:13] real for two reasons
[1:51:15] number one because the bible says so
[1:51:19] and number two because i've done
[1:51:20] business with him
[1:51:30] most of this morning this morning
[1:51:32] wouldn't want to admit that
[1:51:34] we like billy sunday we've done business
[1:51:36] with the devil
[1:51:38] but i can guarantee you
[1:51:40] some everybody in this building at some
[1:51:42] point in time you've done a deal and a
[1:51:44] business deal with the devil
[1:51:48] oh come on now some of you looking at me
[1:51:50] cross-eyed like a cow looking at a new
[1:51:51] gate
[1:51:53] it's the truth you've done some kind of
[1:51:55] deal with the devil you've done
[1:51:56] something you shouldn't do you've looked
[1:51:59] at something you shouldn't look at
[1:52:00] you've listened to stuff you shouldn't
[1:52:01] listen to you've worn or done stuff that
[1:52:04] you shouldn't wear
[1:52:07] that's dealing with the devil that is
[1:52:09] the beginning of the devil's business
[1:52:14] so i always want us to remember today
[1:52:18] that as a church we're engaged in the
[1:52:20] spiritual warfare
[1:52:23] and we need to study him
[1:52:27] we need to know his moves we need to
[1:52:29] know how he carries out his plans we
[1:52:30] need to know his motives
[1:52:32] his intentions and never forget that
[1:52:37] i heard a story
[1:52:39] about muhammad ali
[1:52:42] and muhammad ali was scheduled to fight
[1:52:44] george foreman
[1:52:47] two amazing boxers
[1:52:50] champion versus upcoming
[1:52:55] george foreman had never been knocked
[1:52:57] out
[1:52:58] and only done the knocking out
[1:53:00] and he was trying to come up work his
[1:53:01] way up if i'm not mistaken to take on
[1:53:04] the muhammad ali
[1:53:06] and so muhammad ali
[1:53:08] steps into the ring
[1:53:10] and he steps into the ring after he's
[1:53:12] made all these months of preparation to
[1:53:14] fight george foreman and george foreman
[1:53:17] was known as a man that comes in with
[1:53:18] power and authority and he's going to
[1:53:21] knock you out as quick as he can
[1:53:23] so muhammad ali finds himself in the
[1:53:25] ring and he backs up against the ropes
[1:53:30] and stands in defense
[1:53:33] george foreman wore him out
[1:53:37] for the first round
[1:53:39] the second round
[1:53:40] the third the fourth the fifth
[1:53:44] the sixth
[1:53:46] and people are one he's not even going
[1:53:48] to fight him
[1:53:49] he's scared to even take his hands down
[1:53:52] he's not going to do anything to defend
[1:53:54] himself he's just sitting there got his
[1:53:55] hands up and taking this beating from
[1:53:56] george foreman i can't believe this
[1:53:59] the next round he comes out
[1:54:02] and muhammad ali i will tell you he
[1:54:04] floats like a butterfly stings like a
[1:54:05] bee
[1:54:07] he unleashed on george foreman and he
[1:54:10] let george foreman have all that he
[1:54:11] could handle and knocked him out cold
[1:54:15] and they asked him after the fight what
[1:54:17] was you doing he said i studied
[1:54:22] i knew he come out hitting hard
[1:54:24] i knew he'd come out with authority
[1:54:27] and i also knew that he never went past
[1:54:29] the fifth round
[1:54:32] and he said so i knew if i could just
[1:54:33] let him hit me and i defended myself and
[1:54:36] let him hit me over and over and over
[1:54:38] eventually he was going to get wore out
[1:54:42] and he said when i seen he couldn't
[1:54:43] hardly stand no more and he'd wore
[1:54:45] himself out and he was out of breath
[1:54:46] because he couldn't swing no more he
[1:54:48] said i'll let him have it
[1:54:51] brother sisters that's knowing your
[1:54:53] enemy
[1:54:55] that's being aware of the tactics
[1:55:00] you know a lot of people
[1:55:05] a lot of people around church
[1:55:09] is this okay
[1:55:11] a lot of people around church
[1:55:13] they think their enemies are their
[1:55:15] brothers and sisters in christ
[1:55:20] you disagree with them on something and
[1:55:22] you disagree here you disagree there and
[1:55:24] all of a sudden they're your enemies you
[1:55:25] know
[1:55:26] you have a little conflict and you can't
[1:55:28] say i'm sorry
[1:55:31] or i was wrong
[1:55:35] i worked with a girl well she's older
[1:55:37] than i am
[1:55:38] she always tells everybody i'm a brother
[1:55:40] she never wanted
[1:55:41] i don't know what that means i don't
[1:55:42] know what's good or bad
[1:55:45] but i worked with her and i'm going to
[1:55:46] tell you what
[1:55:49] she'd do anything for anybody
[1:55:52] she would try to she would try to do
[1:55:55] whatever it took to give them days off
[1:55:57] and she may be watching today and if she
[1:55:59] is she knows i'm telling this with love
[1:56:03] and she would do anything
[1:56:05] possible
[1:56:06] but you don't show up to work
[1:56:10] or you quit without a notice
[1:56:12] you know what her saying is
[1:56:14] what is it
[1:56:17] they're dead to me
[1:56:22] yeah because she would pour out
[1:56:23] everything that she had trying to help
[1:56:25] these people and all of a sudden they
[1:56:26] don't come into work they don't they
[1:56:28] just don't show up and then they call
[1:56:30] back two three weeks later it was funny
[1:56:32] they called back can i get my job back i
[1:56:33] say you need to talk to her she wants
[1:56:35] her job back no she's dead to me she
[1:56:37] doesn't exist
[1:56:44] what is that
[1:56:46] that's a spirit
[1:56:50] they're dead to me
[1:56:52] and that's the way sometimes we get and
[1:56:54] she did it in fun would be honest she
[1:56:56] really went on the extra mile i want to
[1:56:58] clarify her name
[1:56:59] clear it up there she would go the extra
[1:57:02] mile
[1:57:03] i may have to encourage her a little bit
[1:57:05] but she would try
[1:57:09] but we mistakenly think that our
[1:57:10] brothers and sisters are our enemies
[1:57:14] but what does it say in verse 10
[1:57:17] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:57:19] lord and the power of his might
[1:57:21] put on the whole armor of god that you
[1:57:23] may be able to stand against the
[1:57:26] wiles
[1:57:27] of the devil
[1:57:29] have you ever looked up what wiles is
[1:57:32] we know in our mind what it what it's
[1:57:34] insinuating
[1:57:36] but it means devious
[1:57:38] cunning strategies employed in
[1:57:41] manipulating or persuading someone to do
[1:57:44] what one wants
[1:57:50] for we wrestle not
[1:57:53] against flesh and blood
[1:57:56] it's not your brother
[1:57:59] it's not your sister
[1:58:01] it's not your neighbor that didn't let
[1:58:03] you borrow the shovel
[1:58:05] it's not the guy that cuts you off on
[1:58:07] the on the highway
[1:58:09] and and told you is number one it's not
[1:58:11] that guy
[1:58:13] it's the spirit behind that guy
[1:58:17] it's the spirit because we wrestle not
[1:58:19] against flesh and blood but against
[1:58:20] principalities
[1:58:23] what are these principalities
[1:58:25] principalities in the bible and there's
[1:58:27] different levels of demons
[1:58:30] that's what our principalities are and
[1:58:31] if you look in the bible you see
[1:58:32] principalities and powers go hand in
[1:58:35] hand
[1:58:37] so these these principalities these
[1:58:39] demons
[1:58:40] the presence of demonic activity these
[1:58:42] things are real and what their goal is
[1:58:45] is to kill
[1:58:47] injure worry destroy
[1:58:50] vex harass
[1:58:52] irritate
[1:58:55] confuse frustrate
[1:58:57] and bother
[1:58:59] humans
[1:59:01] now let me ask you how many of you had
[1:59:02] to deal with the devil
[1:59:07] yeah he's got your number
[1:59:09] he's got your card
[1:59:11] you're on the fight card with the devil
[1:59:13] whether you know it or not
[1:59:15] and we got to bring these things to
[1:59:16] realization
[1:59:18] because he does these things because
[1:59:19] he's mad and wants to get back at god
[1:59:21] and who are you but god's children how
[1:59:23] much more how much happy does it make
[1:59:25] him to get back at god's children for
[1:59:27] god kicking him out of heaven
[1:59:31] so he's out to get you why do we need to
[1:59:33] know this
[1:59:34] you say i've heard these things my whole
[1:59:36] life we got young christians here
[1:59:40] they need to hear these things they need
[1:59:41] to know that when they become christians
[1:59:44] they become under attack
[1:59:47] let me tell you a young person you can
[1:59:49] float along through life all you want
[1:59:53] and you fly under the radar satan
[1:59:57] as long as you are not
[1:59:59] serving christ
[2:00:04] you're just under the radar you're kind
[2:00:05] of in no man's land
[2:00:08] you're floating through time
[2:00:12] but it's important that you know that
[2:00:13] once you give your heart to christ
[2:00:17] once you give your heart to christ
[2:00:19] flying under the radar doesn't exist
[2:00:21] anymore
[2:00:22] from that point on you're now an enemy
[2:00:24] of the state you're an enemy of satan
[2:00:27] you're an enemy of his domain because
[2:00:29] you're here on earth
[2:00:32] so he's coming for you
[2:00:36] principalities are first mentioned
[2:00:40] and it talks about it in different
[2:00:42] versions of the bible and different ones
[2:00:45] it talks about principalities rulers
[2:00:47] authorities
[2:00:49] forces and authorities rulers of power
[2:00:53] and they it's always tied to evil and
[2:00:56] maliciousness
[2:00:59] that's not what you thought she's gonna
[2:01:00] get this morning is it
[2:01:04] evil and maliciousness
[2:01:11] the first mention of roman 8 romans 8 is
[2:01:14] the first mention
[2:01:16] it says who should separate us from the
[2:01:18] love of christ shall tribulation or
[2:01:19] distress or persecution famine neckiness
[2:01:22] peril or sword
[2:01:24] for as written for thy sake we are
[2:01:26] killed all day long and we're accounted
[2:01:28] as sheep for the slaughter nay and all
[2:01:30] these things we are more than conquerors
[2:01:35] him that loved
[2:01:36] us
[2:01:39] listen to the next statement for i am
[2:01:41] persuaded
[2:01:43] he says i got to tell you this i'm
[2:01:45] persuaded let me let you know this isn't
[2:01:47] either death nor life nor angels
[2:01:52] principalities
[2:01:53] powers nor the things nor the present or
[2:01:56] the things to come
[2:01:58] no height nor depth or any other
[2:02:00] creature shall be able to separate us
[2:02:04] from the love
[2:02:06] of god
[2:02:09] which is in christ jesus
[2:02:12] my lord
[2:02:16] brothers and sisters if i didn't verses
[2:02:18] of victory
[2:02:19] i've never read them
[2:02:21] if that's not verses of victory that
[2:02:23] tells us that christ has won over all
[2:02:25] the forces that rage against us and that
[2:02:27] we have been told today that we're more
[2:02:29] than conquerors against these forces of
[2:02:31] evil and nothing life death angels
[2:02:34] demons nothing can take that away from
[2:02:36] us
[2:02:38] god is good
[2:02:46] so the goal of these principalities and
[2:02:48] powers
[2:02:51] are to do as much damage to humans
[2:02:54] as god will allow
[2:02:59] they're part of a a rank in the kingdom
[2:03:01] of darkness
[2:03:03] that include all these fallen angels
[2:03:06] that's been kicked out of heaven with
[2:03:08] lucifer
[2:03:09] and their intent is to hinder the
[2:03:11] purpose of god on earth and take as many
[2:03:13] people as possible
[2:03:15] to hell
[2:03:19] you know where the devil wants to do
[2:03:20] with you he wants to take you to hell
[2:03:23] that's his that's his life's ambition
[2:03:26] he wants to see you fall he wants to see
[2:03:28] you turn your back on god he wants to
[2:03:31] say you become a
[2:03:33] from a light of god to a child of hell
[2:03:37] and that's his intention that's his goal
[2:03:43] and you know he's accomplished a lot of
[2:03:44] that
[2:03:47] he's accomplished a lot of that
[2:03:50] the problem has been over time that
[2:03:52] these spirits
[2:03:56] the stand for these things
[2:03:58] have been glamorized
[2:04:03] i know this is in the living room here
[2:04:05] we're preaching in the living room here
[2:04:07] but they're glamorized through media
[2:04:12] books
[2:04:14] songs
[2:04:19] facebook
[2:04:20] [Music]
[2:04:21] video games
[2:04:24] hey my kids have to
[2:04:28] but sometimes i wonder
[2:04:31] and i say that with sincere heart i
[2:04:33] really wonder
[2:04:34] about the things that we bring in upon
[2:04:37] ourselves
[2:04:41] because there's always a hidden message
[2:04:43] the unseen there's a hidden message a
[2:04:46] hidden agenda a hidden thought something
[2:04:49] that's being implanted into the brains
[2:04:51] and in the minds
[2:04:53] of god's people
[2:04:56] because i bet if we were to look and we
[2:04:57] were to take a poll
[2:04:59] i bet if we were to ask how many of
[2:05:01] these companies that make these movies
[2:05:03] these books these video games how many
[2:05:06] of them are christian based
[2:05:08] companies
[2:05:10] how many you think
[2:05:12] that's what i was thinking
[2:05:15] so do they have the best interest of our
[2:05:18] minds
[2:05:19] do they have the best interest of your
[2:05:20] children's mind
[2:05:22] [Music]
[2:05:23] unseen
[2:05:25] but there
[2:05:29] these principalities
[2:05:32] we have to be careful not only what we
[2:05:34] see what we hear the things we we look
[2:05:36] at feed upon but we got to be careful of
[2:05:39] the places we go
[2:05:42] these principalities they're not
[2:05:44] regulated to just individuals
[2:05:47] they cover territories
[2:05:51] they cover territories they cover lands
[2:05:53] they cover cities
[2:05:55] there there are cities that carry
[2:05:57] spirits of murder
[2:06:01] i think it was in
[2:06:03] 50s i'm not sure whenever the mobsters
[2:06:06] was in chicago
[2:06:08] i didn't read the day but i read the
[2:06:09] story but in chicago they had to go to
[2:06:12] the burger king
[2:06:14] and as they used their mobile freezers
[2:06:16] because the murder rate was so high they
[2:06:17] didn't have a place to put the bodies
[2:06:22] and what is chicago still known for
[2:06:24] today
[2:06:25] murder
[2:06:30] these these
[2:06:31] these principalities they cover regions
[2:06:34] they hover over places
[2:06:36] some places are perverted
[2:06:40] some places are filled with
[2:06:41] homosexuality lesbianism
[2:06:44] some places are filled party
[2:06:47] party till you can't party no more
[2:06:49] you go to louisiana mardi gras
[2:06:51] never been don't want to go don't ever
[2:06:53] care to see it
[2:06:56] they say it's the stinkiness place on
[2:06:58] the face of the earth i had some friends
[2:07:00] that went there and they said the smell
[2:07:02] was unbearable
[2:07:05] pollution
[2:07:09] party till you can't party no more
[2:07:14] brother brown listen to this
[2:07:17] brother branham said that same spirit of
[2:07:19] god that said these things
[2:07:21] and said oh city capernaum
[2:07:24] who called yourself by the name of the
[2:07:26] angels
[2:07:28] los angeles
[2:07:30] how you've exalted yourself into heaven
[2:07:34] and are the very root and seat of satan
[2:07:41] he says preachers
[2:07:43] it's a graveyard for him
[2:07:46] good men go there and die like rats
[2:07:51] he said what a havoc
[2:07:54] and we
[2:07:55] let me ask you
[2:07:57] are we careful
[2:08:00] of where we go
[2:08:04] or do we just get in the car
[2:08:06] start it and drive
[2:08:10] something i've been working on and this
[2:08:11] is kind of off subject but really not
[2:08:14] something i've been kind of working on
[2:08:16] is i heard a preacher and i can't
[2:08:18] remember if it was brother tim pruitt
[2:08:20] or who it was
[2:08:23] but he's he said that somebody had told
[2:08:26] him never get angry
[2:08:29] when you get caught in traffic
[2:08:31] or something slows you down
[2:08:34] or something hinders you
[2:08:38] because what you can't see
[2:08:41] may be the accident that was you was
[2:08:43] prepared to be in
[2:08:45] what you can't see is the truck that was
[2:08:48] fixing to run across the road
[2:08:50] what you can't see is the death that was
[2:08:53] upon your life but your guardian angel
[2:08:56] put a horse and buggy in front of you
[2:09:02] and i've been working on that because
[2:09:04] boy
[2:09:05] did that used to bother me
[2:09:07] bad
[2:09:14] i was good
[2:09:15] i guess i i guess i moved from black
[2:09:18] road where it was calm
[2:09:20] and peaceful
[2:09:22] well most of the time
[2:09:24] to a drag strip
[2:09:27] some of you know what i'm talking about
[2:09:32] i was coming down the road right here
[2:09:34] stringtown road the other day
[2:09:38] coming down the road just minding my
[2:09:39] business about 40 miles an hour that's
[2:09:41] plenty fast enough on that road i was in
[2:09:43] a dually dooley pickup truck
[2:09:46] and all of a sudden in my mirror i see
[2:09:48] this
[2:09:50] torpedo coming
[2:09:54] i think what in the world they're going
[2:09:55] to run over me no they weren't running
[2:09:57] over going around me i bet they went
[2:10:00] around me 70 mile an hour brothers yeah
[2:10:03] wide open and then the next day i found
[2:10:05] out somebody to run over
[2:10:07] our smack mirrors with with chris and
[2:10:10] chars bro
[2:10:12] charles brother right
[2:10:14] cut him up
[2:10:15] why because people are they're they're
[2:10:18] neurotics they're under a spirit they're
[2:10:20] under an influence but thank god he
[2:10:22] allowed me just to keep my cool
[2:10:25] and i said have a great day
[2:10:29] hope you make it to your destination
[2:10:34] see we have protection
[2:10:37] as christians we have protection
[2:10:40] what is that
[2:10:41] our protection is one another through
[2:10:43] christ we pray for one another we hurt
[2:10:45] for one another we we we we feel for one
[2:10:48] another
[2:10:49] jesus is one of the greatest things that
[2:10:51] you could ever do in your life is to be
[2:10:52] able to put yourself in somebody else's
[2:10:55] hurt
[2:10:57] when you can accomplish that
[2:11:00] you're moving
[2:11:03] because until you can you can't
[2:11:04] understand
[2:11:06] you can't understand but when we hurt
[2:11:07] for people when we see people sometimes
[2:11:09] we have to just look and say is that
[2:11:11] person in anguish
[2:11:12] maybe i should pray for them
[2:11:16] because we just don't know
[2:11:19] you just don't know what somebody's
[2:11:21] going through
[2:11:24] you hear mary magdalene's name mentioned
[2:11:26] throughout the bible
[2:11:28] in jesus's time she was a a follower of
[2:11:30] him one of his one of his disciples that
[2:11:32] followed him married magdalene but who
[2:11:34] was she before she touched jesus
[2:11:38] jesus performed an exorcism in her
[2:11:44] yeah
[2:11:45] he performed an exorcism in her he come
[2:11:47] to her and cast out seven demons out of
[2:11:50] her
[2:11:51] unseen to the rest of the world but
[2:11:53] jesus knew
[2:11:55] because that battle was going on
[2:11:58] brother sister we need jesus for full
[2:12:00] deliverance this morning
[2:12:02] we need jesus to be in our lives like he
[2:12:04] was those people back in that day the
[2:12:06] legion we've told the story many times
[2:12:08] jesus goes to legion who've cast out
[2:12:10] thousands of demons
[2:12:13] nobody else saw
[2:12:16] unseen they just thought he was insane
[2:12:19] they didn't know what it meant
[2:12:21] and here he is eat up with these over
[2:12:23] and over for years and years and years
[2:12:25] he's eat up with these demons
[2:12:32] one more one or two more and then we're
[2:12:34] going to close
[2:12:36] for we struggle not against flesh and
[2:12:38] blood blood but against rulers against
[2:12:40] authorities
[2:12:42] powers of the dark world and against the
[2:12:44] spiritual forces of evil and heavenly
[2:12:46] realms
[2:12:48] i don't know if any of you has ever read
[2:12:50] any of charles stanley's stuff
[2:12:52] but he writes some pretty good stuff
[2:12:54] from time to time
[2:12:56] and he says when the enemy strikes
[2:12:58] we must be very clear on one point
[2:13:01] brothers and sisters in christ are not
[2:13:04] our enemies
[2:13:05] we need to recognize that the devil
[2:13:07] attempts to
[2:13:08] blind us
[2:13:10] deceive us
[2:13:11] so that we become
[2:13:13] divided
[2:13:19] and begin to war
[2:13:22] against one another
[2:13:25] rather than against
[2:13:28] him the real enemy is the devil and his
[2:13:32] forces acting behind the scene
[2:13:34] in every case
[2:13:36] of spiritual assault
[2:13:43] if two people come to brother byler
[2:13:46] and they're at odds with one another
[2:13:48] and they say i can't stand this guy i
[2:13:50] can't stand him he lied he this he that
[2:13:54] he done this he done that i i i just
[2:13:56] want to kill him
[2:14:00] satan
[2:14:01] has caused that division
[2:14:06] you know it's a funny thing
[2:14:08] human nature
[2:14:11] we're easily rubbed the wrong way
[2:14:16] one minute we we love everybody one
[2:14:18] minute everybody's our best friend one
[2:14:19] minute everything's good and
[2:14:21] everything's going going fine and just
[2:14:23] one little thing rubs us wrong
[2:14:26] and the whole atmosphere changes
[2:14:31] we got to remember
[2:14:32] brothers and sisters we got to remember
[2:14:34] it's not my brother
[2:14:36] it's not my sister
[2:14:39] it's the devil causing the divide
[2:14:43] there's strength in numbers how many
[2:14:44] times have we said that there's strength
[2:14:46] in numbers and we're only as strong as
[2:14:48] our weakest link so we have to be able
[2:14:50] to to fight satan off
[2:14:52] in these places and allow him not to get
[2:14:53] in
[2:14:54] and influence us to do those things
[2:15:01] but the realization is the truth is
[2:15:03] we got to be willing to forgive one
[2:15:05] another
[2:15:08] i said we're funny people by nature
[2:15:13] why is it so hard to say that
[2:15:16] i'm sorry brother
[2:15:18] man i was wrong
[2:15:19] will you forgive me
[2:15:22] you want to talk about a peace
[2:15:26] you can hold that grudge all you want
[2:15:29] i've seen it i've seen people do it you
[2:15:31] brother baller's seen people do it hold
[2:15:33] grudges for years and years and years
[2:15:36] and their thought is they're dead to me
[2:15:42] when all they have to do
[2:15:45] is take the humble side
[2:15:48] and say
[2:15:49] i'm sorry
[2:15:51] will you forgive me
[2:15:53] the devil has tried to kill us
[2:15:56] he tries to steal our friendship
[2:15:58] he's tried to steal our joy
[2:16:01] he's trying to split our homes
[2:16:04] he's tried to get between husband and
[2:16:06] wife
[2:16:07] he tries to get between children and
[2:16:10] mother and children and father
[2:16:12] he tries to get between congregation and
[2:16:14] pastor come on people
[2:16:17] i'm telling y'all his tricks i don't
[2:16:19] know today
[2:16:22] he's trying to destroy the church of
[2:16:24] christ
[2:16:27] he's trying to destroy god's people
[2:16:35] but jesus brings unity
[2:16:39] harmony
[2:16:42] peace
[2:16:44] joy love compassion
[2:16:48] we're coming into a weekend coming up
[2:16:49] when we need unity
[2:16:52] we need love
[2:16:53] we need compassion we need god the
[2:16:56] spirit of god to come down and move upon
[2:16:58] our people in a mighty way that they
[2:17:00] will never be the same from that day
[2:17:02] forward
[2:17:08] so he's a havoc maker
[2:17:10] yeah
[2:17:11] yeah he's a havoc maker
[2:17:16] he wants to try to get
[2:17:18] between what you believe
[2:17:21] yep
[2:17:24] i had a young man call me some time ago
[2:17:26] it's probably been
[2:17:28] maybe
[2:17:29] i don't know
[2:17:30] a few years
[2:17:31] say
[2:17:33] and he calls me
[2:17:35] asked me how i'm doing
[2:17:37] you know how it all starts how you doing
[2:17:39] brother i'm doing good how are you
[2:17:43] you know have you ever thought about
[2:17:45] this
[2:17:46] what brother branham said here
[2:17:49] as soon as he asked that
[2:17:53] what's he what's where's he going
[2:17:55] what's he trying to do here where is he
[2:17:56] going
[2:17:57] have you ever thought about this or that
[2:17:59] and
[2:18:00] what was he doing he was trying to place
[2:18:02] doubt in my mind
[2:18:04] he was trying to divide me from what the
[2:18:06] very things i believed in the most
[2:18:09] and he was trying to build that divide
[2:18:11] there to get me to step away
[2:18:14] from what i believed
[2:18:17] i let him ramble on for a while
[2:18:19] and he was telling me about this
[2:18:21] new movement he'd seen and this
[2:18:23] over here and this over there and how
[2:18:25] great this was how great this preacher
[2:18:27] was and this and that and the other and
[2:18:29] i just let him ramble on until he was
[2:18:31] finished
[2:18:32] and i said you know what
[2:18:34] that's what i told him i said you show
[2:18:36] me something better
[2:18:40] you show me something better
[2:18:43] than this
[2:18:45] show me something better than the
[2:18:47] message of the hour
[2:18:50] something that'll make you live
[2:18:52] as godly of a life
[2:18:55] something that'll make your women dress
[2:18:56] like ladies
[2:18:58] something that'll make you sing gospel
[2:19:00] songs instead of honky tonk songs
[2:19:04] show me something that'll make you uh
[2:19:06] go places that you should go and stay
[2:19:08] out of the places you shouldn't be
[2:19:11] show me something better
[2:19:14] that's about the end of that
[2:19:15] conversation
[2:19:18] because he knew i had him right there
[2:19:20] and that war was going on in between my
[2:19:23] mind and his mind and there was a no
[2:19:25] doubt satan and good and evil was
[2:19:26] battling it out trying to figure out can
[2:19:28] we do it can we get him can we get him
[2:19:30] can we get him
[2:19:31] show me something better you're gonna
[2:19:34] have to better than that
[2:19:37] today's in the world
[2:19:39] kids are in the world
[2:19:44] it's sad
[2:19:47] it's sad
[2:19:50] you know what the d
[2:19:52] in
[2:19:53] devil stands for
[2:19:55] lord showed this to me this morning i
[2:19:56] like this
[2:19:58] drama
[2:20:03] drama
[2:20:05] ain't nothing i i i hate more than drama
[2:20:10] somebody that's always stirring
[2:20:11] something
[2:20:14] but what we got to remember we got to be
[2:20:16] careful now because it's not them
[2:20:20] there's a motive there's a spirit
[2:20:21] there's an intention behind it to keep
[2:20:23] the waters muddy to dismantle to
[2:20:26] disassemble to destroy the fame
[2:20:28] framework of the church and to to reduce
[2:20:31] the gifts and the callings and the
[2:20:32] movement of christ i'll tell you what
[2:20:34] i'm i've been pretty happy with the
[2:20:36] movement we've been having here
[2:20:38] i think the preaching of the word has
[2:20:40] been really good brother bob has been
[2:20:41] bringing out gifts and talking about
[2:20:43] gifts we had people singing that usually
[2:20:45] didn't sing we've had people singing
[2:20:46] more that wasn't singing
[2:20:51] so what does satan want to do
[2:20:56] turn it down
[2:21:01] i'm gonna have to find a place to get
[2:21:02] off here
[2:21:04] i gotta gotta get off this ship
[2:21:08] i found this
[2:21:10] and i thought it was pretty good you
[2:21:12] know we got the beatitudes
[2:21:15] and this was the devil's beatitudes
[2:21:19] yeah
[2:21:21] blessed are those that are too tired too
[2:21:23] busy too distracted to spend an hour a
[2:21:26] week with their fellow christians
[2:21:28] they're my best workers
[2:21:32] blessed are those christians who wait to
[2:21:34] be asked and expect to be thanked
[2:21:38] i can use them this is satan talking now
[2:21:41] this is satan's beatitudes
[2:21:44] blessed are the touchy who stop going to
[2:21:47] church
[2:21:48] for they're my missionaries
[2:21:53] blessed are the troublemakers for they
[2:21:56] shall be called my children
[2:21:59] other complainers for their complaints
[2:22:01] are music to my ears
[2:22:03] blessed are those who keep a list of
[2:22:05] preachers mistakes
[2:22:06] for they get nothing out of his sermons
[2:22:11] i thought somebody spent some time
[2:22:13] writing these
[2:22:17] blessed is a church member who expects
[2:22:18] to be invited to his own church
[2:22:21] for he is part of the problem instead of
[2:22:22] the solution
[2:22:24] you know it it's really sad when you
[2:22:26] have to call people and ask them when
[2:22:28] are you going to come back to church
[2:22:33] i probably shouldn't say this brother
[2:22:34] butler but it's come to me more than
[2:22:35] once i got to say it
[2:22:37] sometimes on wednesday nights i could
[2:22:39] throw a handful of gravel out across
[2:22:40] this
[2:22:41] pews and not hit anybody
[2:22:45] that's all i'm going to say
[2:22:48] blessed are those who gossip for they
[2:22:51] shall call strife and divisions that
[2:22:53] please me
[2:22:54] blessed are those who are easily
[2:22:56] offended for they will soon get angry
[2:22:59] and quit
[2:23:00] blessed are those who do not give an
[2:23:02] offering to carry
[2:23:04] stealing from god you steal from me
[2:23:10] for me not from me blessed is he who
[2:23:12] professes to love god but hates his
[2:23:14] brother and sister for he shall be with
[2:23:16] me forever
[2:23:21] last one blessed are you who when you
[2:23:23] hear this think the preacher is talking
[2:23:25] about someone other than you
[2:23:29] for i've got you right where i want you
[2:23:33] let's stand
[2:23:36] give the lord credit this morning god's
[2:23:38] good
[2:23:44] you say how do we do this
[2:23:46] how do we overcome how do we fight this
[2:23:48] battle how do we continue to walk day in
[2:23:50] and day out
[2:23:52] with this battle raging
[2:23:55] there's only one way you can do it
[2:23:58] it's because of the blood that was shed
[2:23:59] on calvary
[2:24:02] and that blood that was shed on calvary
[2:24:04] he didn't have to do it
[2:24:06] you heard me talking about billy sunday
[2:24:07] and what he said earlier you know
[2:24:09] brother brandon said billy sunday said
[2:24:10] in one of his messages that on the day
[2:24:13] of the crucifixion when christ was up on
[2:24:14] the cross and was nailed to the cross he
[2:24:17] said there was an angel sitting on every
[2:24:19] limb
[2:24:20] waiting to come at his back and call
[2:24:24] to take away
[2:24:30] he didn't have to do it
[2:24:33] but he loved you and i enough
[2:24:36] that he kept those hands nailed to the
[2:24:39] cross
[2:24:40] because all he had to do was jerk that
[2:24:42] hand off he said and point a finger
[2:24:45] and they all would have came to him
[2:24:48] what a mighty god we serve
[2:24:51] let's bow our heads heavenly father
[2:24:54] lord jesus we're thankful lord
[2:24:57] you've ministered to our hearts this
[2:24:58] morning lord and spoken words of wisdom
[2:25:01] and and knowledge of
[2:25:03] who we're at and who we're battling in
[2:25:06] this war that's raging amongst us and so
[2:25:08] many times we fail to realize that the
[2:25:11] unseen things are what's controlling us
[2:25:13] in our lives it's controlling our
[2:25:14] neighbors it's controlling our brothers
[2:25:16] and sisters and the things we say and
[2:25:18] and do and the actions that we that we
[2:25:20] profess and the things we do father so
[2:25:23] lord may all of our actions be coming
[2:25:25] from you father may we find ourselves
[2:25:28] dedicated and and committed lord to to
[2:25:31] the word of god and to prayer and to
[2:25:33] dedication and commitment to you so that
[2:25:35] we don't fall for those wiles of the
[2:25:37] devil
[2:25:38] so that when satan comes and knocking on
[2:25:40] our door we're able to recognize who he
[2:25:43] is we're able to recognize the
[2:25:45] cunningness and the deception and the
[2:25:48] slowness that he brings forward
[2:25:52] lord jesus we ask for your help this
[2:25:54] morning
[2:25:55] but we also know
[2:25:57] that through you
[2:25:58] we can make it because the word says
[2:26:01] that we're more than conquerors
[2:26:04] we've been made more than conquerors
[2:26:06] through jesus christ
[2:26:10] and lord without you
[2:26:12] we fall in those traps
[2:26:14] without the holy ghost leading and
[2:26:15] guiding we find ourselves looking at
[2:26:17] things we shouldn't
[2:26:19] saying things we shouldn't treating
[2:26:20] people in ways that we shouldn't treat
[2:26:22] them
[2:26:24] but lord god
[2:26:26] thank you for that blood that was shed
[2:26:30] just as you made a way for adam and eve
[2:26:32] in that garden through those bloody
[2:26:34] lambskins that was cast on them lord a
[2:26:37] way back that they could come and
[2:26:38] fellowship with you through all of our
[2:26:40] mistakes through all of our failures
[2:26:43] there was a lamb of god
[2:26:46] that was shed
[2:26:49] on calvary's tree the blood that run
[2:26:51] down that tree of calvary lord
[2:26:54] and said today you're victorious
[2:26:57] today you're a conqueror

[2:28:14] brother and sister for some reason this
[2:28:16] year these meetings have just been so
[2:28:18] heavy on my heart
