[54:16] don't shine
[54:18] you can't be a beacon if your light
[54:21] don't shine
[54:23] there's a little light in all of us by
[54:25] god's design

[54:34] deacon if your wife don't mind
[54:37] no you can't be a deacon if your wife
[54:40] don't mind
[54:42] there's a light in all of us my god

[54:46] and you can't be a beacon if your light
[54:50] don't shine
[54:52] well this looks like a mine
[54:56] i'm gonna let it shine
[54:59] [Applause]
[55:03] i'm gonna let it shine
[55:06] well now this
[55:19] i'm is one more great handcrafted praise
[55:21] tonight this morning amen
[55:23] [Applause]
[55:30] i like good old-fashioned singing don't
[55:32] you i was years ago i first came in the
[55:35] message i was preaching up in ohio right
[55:38] outside of cincinnati and i preached and
[55:40] i was just fresh out of the apostolic
[55:42] church come out of the oneness
[55:43] pentecostal group
[55:45] and i didn't know that people just sat
[55:47] and stared at you when you preached i
[55:48] was used to it by getting in with you a
[55:50] lot of times we we didn't need chairs we
[55:53] all we just mostly stood most of the
[55:55] service that's just the way the
[55:56] pentecostal church was and the pastor
[55:58] after the church got me outside and he
[56:00] said you know said you're just a little
[56:02] bit too pentecostal said you hang around
[56:04] long enough said we'll settle you down
[56:07] i said brother i might be pentecostal
[56:09] but i said at least i'm two church ages
[56:10] ahead of y'all
[56:16] look like a bunch of methodists i told
[56:17] my wife i said man they were singing
[56:19] that night i was singing like i was
[56:20] talking about the other night singing
[56:22] you know down at the cross and they were
[56:23] dragging that song out i looked at her
[56:25] so we at church are we at a funeral
[56:28] i mean we come to have church
[56:30] i believe we ought to be able to feel
[56:32] the spirit of god and enjoy god's
[56:34] presence
[56:35] amen and his word ought to
[56:37] cause something to pulsate in your heart
[56:39] amen that's like i said that's where the
[56:41] real music is is in your heart that's
[56:43] what makes melody to him and then all
[56:46] this that we have here this morning just
[56:47] accompanies what's already in our hearts
[56:50] this morning so we certainly appreciate
[56:52] the lord again i know i've said it every
[56:54] night but i mean it with all my heart i
[56:55] appreciate brother byler giving us the
[56:57] invitation i do want to take just a
[56:59] moment and then thank a sister i don't
[57:01] remember your name but brother byler
[57:03] brought me a little offering that you
[57:04] have given to us to help with the hotel
[57:06] rooms i want to say thank you so much
[57:08] for that and i pray that god will return
[57:10] it to you many fold it was a real
[57:12] blessing to us and we thank you for that
[57:14] um brother david last night i walked out
[57:17] i've been every time i preached here so
[57:19] far i've been trying to preach with a
[57:21] certain my mouth not literally but
[57:23] trying to let it melt quick so i can get
[57:24] done fast and then brother dave is going
[57:26] to complain about me preaching short and
[57:28] i said well i'll try to slip a little
[57:30] button in this morning if i can
[57:32] amen just kidding i don't i know i'm not
[57:34] supposed to do that but i just
[57:36] appreciate the lord you're an easy crowd
[57:38] to preach and it's always good to preach
[57:39] somewhere where it's easy to preach
[57:41] people pulling the only two kind of
[57:43] preachers that make me want to preach
[57:44] them that can and them that can't
[57:47] amen and really it's just a gift it's up
[57:49] to you to pull
[57:51] and get what you need from it it's not
[57:52] about us but first night we preached on
[57:54] being sifted and satan eaten trust that
[57:57] something was said that helped you in
[57:58] your christian experience
[58:00] last night we preached on the journey to
[58:02] revival
[58:03] i want you to turn with me this morning
[58:04] if you would to hebrews chapter 12
[58:07] i'd like to turn over there
[58:09] and we had just a wonderful time so far
[58:11] around the word of the lord and we
[58:13] appreciate it trust something's been
[58:15] said that we preached or
[58:17] sung or whatever that would
[58:19] help you in your walk with christ i mean
[58:21] believe that's what it's all about is
[58:22] our walk with christ i got to study in
[58:25] that one day years ago and
[58:28] i found the first attribute that was
[58:30] ever associated with god in the bible
[58:32] was that his voice came walking in the
[58:35] garden in the cool of the day
[58:37] then i found out enoch walked with god
[58:39] abraham was told to walk before me
[58:41] that's an attribute that's found in
[58:43] every son of god
[58:44] is to build to be able to walk with god
[58:47] walk with his voice walk with his word
[58:50] but then i get confused because
[58:51] sometimes i read the bible tells me to
[58:53] sit
[58:54] and said when christ raised that we set
[58:56] with him in heavenly places
[58:59] and when a man sets it's assigned the
[59:00] work is finished and i want to say this
[59:02] morning i believe in a finished work i
[59:04] believe it's already been accomplished
[59:05] by christ
[59:06] then i'm told to walk with him and i
[59:09] believe that's an every day we're to be
[59:11] walking with him this morning we're
[59:13] going to look at a different position
[59:15] we're not going to look at setting we're
[59:16] not going to look at walking we're going
[59:18] to look at running
[59:20] running that's in the bible too we're
[59:23] taught to run
[59:24] i'm going to speak about that this
[59:25] morning let me just say this before we
[59:27] go any further
[59:29] god is not concerned so much about
[59:31] the position of our body
[59:34] or the posture of our body as much as
[59:36] he's concerned about the position of our
[59:39] hearts
[59:40] and there's three great religions in the
[59:42] world today that all tie back and claim
[59:45] abraham as the originator
[59:47] one of them is the muslim faith
[59:50] the other is judaism then the other is
[59:52] christianity
[59:54] now
[59:55] the muslim faith comes from
[59:57] ishmael that came out of abram
[1:00:00] you know
[1:00:01] abram ishmael was not abram's abraham's
[1:00:04] son he was abram's son
[1:00:07] and once he got a name change and was
[1:00:09] changed to abraham that's where isaac
[1:00:11] came from
[1:00:13] but then there's a royal seat of abraham
[1:00:15] and that was christ
[1:00:16] and all of us are abraham seed and we're
[1:00:18] heirs for the same promise because we
[1:00:21] are in christ you believe that
[1:00:23] them other two religions that we speak
[1:00:25] about it's important which way they face
[1:00:27] when they pray and they all want to face
[1:00:29] jerusalem and pray to the east and pray
[1:00:31] three times a day as if god's concerned
[1:00:33] about the the posture of our
[1:00:36] body but you realize you can be in
[1:00:38] church you can be at home you ladies can
[1:00:40] be behind the sink you you mean to be on
[1:00:42] a job
[1:00:44] and because that your heart is right
[1:00:47] god can hear us anywhere we pray
[1:00:49] because he's concerned about the
[1:00:51] position of our heart our position never
[1:00:53] changes that's what we are in christ and
[1:00:55] i found out paul as i was talking last
[1:00:57] night he called himself he spent a lot
[1:00:59] of years in prison most of the books of
[1:01:00] the bible he wrote was wrote from prison
[1:01:02] 13 books of the bible he spent a lot of
[1:01:04] time in prison but he never one time
[1:01:06] ever called himself a prisoner wrong
[1:01:08] never he called himself a prisoner of
[1:01:11] jesus christ
[1:01:13] he knew he had a position in christ and
[1:01:15] his location could never change his
[1:01:18] position but matter if he's in ephesus
[1:01:20] if he's in rome if he's in the city of
[1:01:22] philippi wouldn't matter where he was
[1:01:24] his location could change but his
[1:01:26] position could never change
[1:01:28] so our location can never change our
[1:01:30] position but i do want to say this
[1:01:32] morning if you run this race you'll find
[1:01:34] out while these days your position is
[1:01:36] going to change your location
[1:01:39] it's going to change you from earth to
[1:01:41] glory amen that's where we're want to
[1:01:43] get to this morning is in that great
[1:01:46] rapture how many wants to be a part of
[1:01:48] that
[1:01:49] amen so i want to read this morning if
[1:01:50] we could
[1:01:51] from hebrews chapter 12
[1:01:54] and i want to read verses 1 and verse 2
[1:01:56] and get right into our subject
[1:01:59] hebrews chapter 12 verse 1.
[1:02:02] wherefore
[1:02:03] seeing we also are compassed about
[1:02:07] what's so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:02:12] notice this let us
[1:02:14] lay aside every weight
[1:02:16] and the sin which dost so easily beset
[1:02:20] us
[1:02:21] and let us run with patience
[1:02:24] the race that is set before us
[1:02:27] now i find it odd that the word patience
[1:02:30] would be
[1:02:31] used in the light of us running
[1:02:34] but he doesn't say run with patience the
[1:02:36] race but run the race with patience
[1:02:40] then he says verse 2
[1:02:42] looking unto jesus the author
[1:02:45] and the finisher of our faith who for
[1:02:48] the joy that was set before him endured
[1:02:50] the cross
[1:02:51] despising the shame and has set down
[1:02:54] notice him we're running he's already
[1:02:56] set down he sat down at the right hand
[1:03:00] of the throne
[1:03:02] of god
[1:03:04] father we thank you for your word this
[1:03:05] morning
[1:03:07] lord i know it's the closing service
[1:03:10] and father we just prayed this morning
[1:03:12] that even in this service the holy
[1:03:15] spirit would encourage us
[1:03:17] that he would speak to every heart we do
[1:03:19] thank you for the praise reports that we
[1:03:21] heard this morning
[1:03:23] no one you're a god that answers prayer
[1:03:25] you're the same yesterday today and
[1:03:27] forever
[1:03:28] you never change father
[1:03:30] and lord as your prophet said we're not
[1:03:32] waiting on you you're waiting on us
[1:03:35] and lord we want this meeting somehow
[1:03:38] some way
[1:03:39] that when we leave here we're closer to
[1:03:41] you father that's our desire
[1:03:43] may you bless every person this morning
[1:03:45] may you help us to get out of the way
[1:03:47] and the holy spirit to use us once again
[1:03:49] speak to your people and we'll give you
[1:03:51] praise for all things in the wonderful
[1:03:53] name of the lord jesus christ and the
[1:03:55] church says
[1:03:57] amen god bless you you may be seated
[1:03:59] this morning
[1:04:04] it is common knowledge
[1:04:07] yet debatable by some so we'll just take
[1:04:10] brother branham's word for it
[1:04:12] the man that penned the book of hebrews
[1:04:15] was paul the apostle
[1:04:19] at the same time that he penned the book
[1:04:21] of hebrews there's no question that he
[1:04:23] was writing to his hebrew brethren
[1:04:26] he was writing really to the hebrews the
[1:04:29] book of hebrews to the hebrews to tell
[1:04:31] them that they no longer had to live
[1:04:33] after the hebrews
[1:04:35] that means this he was trying to bring
[1:04:38] his age out of law
[1:04:41] over into grace
[1:04:44] now i want to say this morning before we
[1:04:46] ever get started that paul was inspired
[1:04:50] not by his own thoughts
[1:04:52] he was not pinning what he was pinning
[1:04:54] because it was coming from inspiration
[1:04:57] out of his own intellectual mind
[1:05:00] what paul was writing was inspired and
[1:05:03] came directly from a source
[1:05:05] and that source
[1:05:07] is from that great pillar of fire that
[1:05:10] we see hanging in this building this
[1:05:12] morning
[1:05:13] many years ago 18 years old i said last
[1:05:16] night i opened a church there in florida
[1:05:18] fresh out of the pentecostal church and
[1:05:20] i started pastoring and a young man out
[1:05:22] of the church of god came into our
[1:05:24] services and he said i have a problem
[1:05:26] with what you preach i said what is it
[1:05:28] he said i have a problem that two men 2
[1:05:31] 000 years apart you keep declaring that
[1:05:34] brother branham preached he didn't call
[1:05:35] him brother but he called him william
[1:05:37] branham preached the same gospel that
[1:05:39] paul preached i said that's exactly the
[1:05:41] truth brother branham preached exactly
[1:05:44] the same message that paul the apostle
[1:05:46] preached he said how can you believe
[1:05:48] that of all the fearloads and all the
[1:05:50] teachers we got around
[1:05:53] christianity there's not one that
[1:05:55] teaches word by word exactly what paul
[1:05:58] said i said but in this day it did
[1:06:00] happen how can you believe that how can
[1:06:03] two men two thousand years apart preach
[1:06:05] the exact same message i said i'll tell
[1:06:07] you why you're thinking that brother
[1:06:09] branham said in an office with this
[1:06:10] bible and he studied until he come up
[1:06:12] with an interpretation that matches paul
[1:06:15] i said ain't no man can take his bible
[1:06:17] and do that it's not ever going to come
[1:06:19] that way he said then how in the world
[1:06:20] could these two men preach the same golf
[1:06:22] life and i'll tell you how i said
[1:06:24] because both of them got the revelation
[1:06:26] from the exact same source
[1:06:28] it was a pillar of fire that met paul on
[1:06:31] the road damascus and it's the same
[1:06:33] pillar of fire that come back in this
[1:06:35] day amen and picked up a man by the name
[1:06:38] of brother branham and through that
[1:06:40] pillar of fire he was capable of
[1:06:42] preaching the exact same message that
[1:06:44] paul preached in the early church
[1:06:47] he was given a mission to go with the
[1:06:49] message that would forerun the second
[1:06:51] coming of christ but then he was given
[1:06:53] up he was given a commission but then he
[1:06:55] was given a message and that message god
[1:06:57] would open the seven seals and he would
[1:06:59] restore the word exactly how they had it
[1:07:02] two thousand years ago and this morning
[1:07:04] sitting in this audience under the
[1:07:06] hospices of malachi 4's messi listen to
[1:07:08] me now is a peoples whose hearts have
[1:07:11] been turned back to the exact same faith
[1:07:13] that they preached in the early church
[1:07:15] but that i give god praise this morning
[1:07:18] to be identified with that
[1:07:20] but you see the bible teaches
[1:07:23] us that in the beginning was now you
[1:07:25] know the scripture in the beginning was
[1:07:27] the
[1:07:28] the word
[1:07:29] the word was with god and the word
[1:07:33] was god when i first came the message i
[1:07:35] didn't think brother branham knew the
[1:07:37] verses in between because he'd always
[1:07:39] say in the beginning was the word words
[1:07:40] with god the word was god and the word
[1:07:42] was made flesh and dwelt among us but it
[1:07:44] was about 11 verses in between there but
[1:07:47] that word that he's referring to in john
[1:07:50] 1 1 is not your bible
[1:07:54] no it's brother until the question
[1:07:56] answers it's the first thing that ever
[1:07:58] came out of god when god gave himself
[1:08:01] birth that logos that came out of god in
[1:08:04] the beginning that was the word that was
[1:08:06] in the beginning with god now it was
[1:08:08] that logos
[1:08:10] that was the author of the word the
[1:08:12] bible because what that word would do it
[1:08:15] would move upon men and then it would
[1:08:17] anoint those men inspire those men bring
[1:08:19] them in up into the spirit until they
[1:08:21] begin to pen and what they were writing
[1:08:23] was the mind of god expressed and when
[1:08:26] they put it on paper or badger skin then
[1:08:28] we find out that what they expressed was
[1:08:30] the word of god so it was really the
[1:08:33] word logos is the author of the written
[1:08:35] word
[1:08:37] are y'all with me say amen
[1:08:39] so you see he moved up on moses to pin
[1:08:42] the old testament he moved up on paul to
[1:08:45] pin the new testament he didn't come in
[1:08:47] this day and move on a man to pin
[1:08:49] another bible we don't need another
[1:08:51] bible this bible is our absolute you
[1:08:53] believe that that same glorified that
[1:08:56] moved upon moses to penned the bible
[1:08:58] moved upon paul to write the new
[1:09:00] testament but listen now it's the same
[1:09:02] word the same pillar of fire that come
[1:09:04] down this
[1:09:06] day in brother bennett's ministry and
[1:09:08] gave us the perfect interpretation of
[1:09:10] the word of god with divine vindication
[1:09:13] making jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:09:16] today and forever brother sister young
[1:09:19] man i don't care who you are young lady
[1:09:21] you're a blessed individual this morning
[1:09:23] be sitting under a message like we got
[1:09:25] and that's why i encourage you never let
[1:09:27] this message get common to you put it in
[1:09:29] your heart and run with it as fast as
[1:09:31] you can go to the finish line in this
[1:09:33] hour
[1:09:35] that pillar of fire over that prophet's
[1:09:37] head i'll tell you what brother ben said
[1:09:39] in the end time this is how he said it
[1:09:41] he said now brother i seen the word of
[1:09:44] god perfectly by the word
[1:09:49] in that amazing statement
[1:09:51] i have seen the word of god perfectly by
[1:09:55] the word it was that pillar of fire
[1:09:58] that made this bible become a new book
[1:10:00] in this age you know he sat in that
[1:10:02] office and said i was about to make a
[1:10:03] horrible mistake but about 12 o'clock he
[1:10:05] came in the room when he stepped behind
[1:10:07] that pulpit this message is not the
[1:10:10] thoughts of william branham it's the
[1:10:11] thoughts of almighty god expressed
[1:10:13] through william branham
[1:10:15] you believe that this is the very mind
[1:10:16] of god for this age this message got the
[1:10:19] power and the ability to put us into a
[1:10:21] wrap
[1:10:23] it's got the power to change our body
[1:10:26] but it can't stay in book form it's got
[1:10:28] to come out these books got to get down
[1:10:30] in our hearts it's got to change us into
[1:10:32] the same image of christ
[1:10:35] now look brother that's what makes me
[1:10:37] happy because i believe that saint lick
[1:10:40] at least the lick a portion of that
[1:10:42] pillar fire has come down into the heart
[1:10:44] of every man and woman this morning that
[1:10:46] has the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:48] but it's down in that soul and it's here
[1:10:50] leading you and guiding you not only
[1:10:52] through this message in this message and
[1:10:54] ultimately into a rapture in a body
[1:10:56] change right on down as brother bam said
[1:10:59] would lead us into a millennium and i'm
[1:11:01] a quote with brother banham i'm
[1:11:02] identified with a group that knows he's
[1:11:05] unveiled knows he's the same yesterday
[1:11:07] today and forever knows that this is not
[1:11:10] fanaticism it's jesus christ the same
[1:11:12] yesterday today and forever i'm
[1:11:14] identified with a group here tonight yet
[1:11:17] they're called a bunch of heretics a
[1:11:18] bunch of fanatics on the count of the
[1:11:20] word of god but i am not ashamed of the
[1:11:22] gospel of jesus christ it is the power
[1:11:24] of god under salvation and i'm one i'm
[1:11:27] with them living didn't say him i'm with
[1:11:29] them living epistles spoke of vindicated
[1:11:32] god veiled in human form in men and
[1:11:36] women oh glory hallelujah he says aren't
[1:11:39] you glad to be identified after 50 years
[1:11:41] with that same group that believes that
[1:11:43] same thing and sees god identifying
[1:11:46] himself in the same way that he did back
[1:11:48] there
[1:11:49] praise god making him still to this
[1:11:51] morning jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:11:54] today
[1:11:55] and forever
[1:11:57] now let me say this and then we're going
[1:11:58] to get right in our subject and i'll
[1:12:00] i'll try to get this shirt to dissolve
[1:12:02] quickly
[1:12:04] but that pillar of fire when he returns
[1:12:06] three different occasions
[1:12:08] that pillar of fire came to earth don't
[1:12:10] you ever let nobody tell you that's this
[1:12:12] intellectual reasoning crowd that tells
[1:12:14] you that ain't that great pillar of fire
[1:12:16] that met moses and paul i don't care
[1:12:18] what that unbelieving crowd says that
[1:12:20] picture won't never come out of my
[1:12:21] church
[1:12:23] i said this crowd will leave before that
[1:12:25] picture ever leaves you don't want to be
[1:12:27] identified with that picture you sure
[1:12:28] don't want me as
[1:12:30] your preacher
[1:12:31] i'm not ashamed of my prophet nor that
[1:12:34] pillar of fire
[1:12:36] as paul told timothy deep thou therefore
[1:12:38] not ashamed the testimony of the lord
[1:12:39] nor of me as prisoner i'm not ashamed of
[1:12:42] william branham he's my brother
[1:12:44] just like i'm not ashamed of you but i'm
[1:12:47] not the one in that photograph he is
[1:12:49] he's the one god vindicated as the
[1:12:51] prophet ministering to this age i'm not
[1:12:53] the prophet messenger i'm just here
[1:12:56] to repeat what he's already preached and
[1:12:58] any man worth this salt will only tell
[1:13:00] you what he preached
[1:13:03] oh i should be getting some amens now
[1:13:05] you remember i told you i'm trying to
[1:13:07] close that generational gap i don't
[1:13:08] believe there's a message for the young
[1:13:10] and for the old i believe the same
[1:13:11] message that's going to change the old
[1:13:13] is the same message going to change the
[1:13:15] young the same name the olds baptized in
[1:13:18] is the same name that you use the young
[1:13:20] is baptized in the same holy ghost that
[1:13:23] baptize your mom and daddies it's the
[1:13:25] same holy ghost that baptizes you the
[1:13:27] same spirit of god that's gonna change
[1:13:29] their bodies it's the same spirit of god
[1:13:30] gonna change your body hey the same
[1:13:33] takes you the whole generation listen to
[1:13:35] is the same tape that us younger
[1:13:37] generations listening to
[1:13:40] the message ain't changing times change
[1:13:43] men change but this message ain't
[1:13:45] changing it's not saith the lord
[1:13:49] i asked my boy on the way to church i
[1:13:51] said who won the game
[1:13:53] last night them two volleyball he said
[1:13:55] the young people i said see you didn't
[1:13:56] need me after all
[1:14:01] praise the lord
[1:14:04] amen some of y'all will get used to me
[1:14:06] in a minute
[1:14:07] you ain't by the third service you
[1:14:09] probably never will
[1:14:12] but you realize when that pillar of fire
[1:14:14] come
[1:14:15] it didn't it came only brother herrera
[1:14:18] to it came only to fulfill
[1:14:20] what had been prophesied
[1:14:23] when he sent moses down in egypt he
[1:14:25] didn't send moses to run with a message
[1:14:27] to actually come up with a message he
[1:14:29] actually went down there because moses
[1:14:30] was going to egypt was god's
[1:14:32] interpretation of what he had already
[1:14:34] spoken to abraham how that his people
[1:14:36] would serve join in the strain then and
[1:14:38] after 400 years i'll bring him out with
[1:14:40] a mighty hand moses was that man that
[1:14:43] god was going to use and moses's life
[1:14:45] became god's interpretation for the day
[1:14:50] brother do you realize when they come
[1:14:52] out that upper room i do believe they
[1:14:53] were drunk i do believe they come out of
[1:14:56] the windows and doors staggering like a
[1:14:57] bunch of drunks i do believe that it was
[1:14:59] nine o'clock in the morning i do believe
[1:15:01] they were talking to tribal languages
[1:15:03] under the inspiration the holy spirit no
[1:15:05] question but what struck me the most was
[1:15:07] not the fact that they staggered not the
[1:15:09] fact they were speaking tongues but the
[1:15:11] fact that they were able to identify
[1:15:13] what scripture god was interpreting for
[1:15:15] that hour and peter said
[1:15:18] i know y'all think we're drunk weeds
[1:15:20] truck as y'all suppose it's only nine
[1:15:22] o'clock in the morning but this is the
[1:15:24] next thing that identified the real
[1:15:25] evidence of a man being baptized with
[1:15:27] the spirit he said this this is that
[1:15:30] which was spoken by the prophet joel
[1:15:31] saith god when the holy spirit came on
[1:15:34] peter he was able to identify what
[1:15:36] scriptures god was interpreting for the
[1:15:38] hour and he wasn't just packing a bible
[1:15:40] quote in scripture he was those
[1:15:42] scriptures being interpreted when they
[1:15:44] come out of that upper room staggering
[1:15:45] like trust and speak in other tongues
[1:15:47] their men were literally god's
[1:15:49] interpretation for that day and my
[1:15:52] brother sister when he returned in this
[1:15:53] hour we're not here just quoting
[1:15:55] scripture we are the scripture for this
[1:15:57] day the word is made flesh in you you
[1:16:00] say oh but i can tell you now brother
[1:16:02] bannon's malachi 4 this day this
[1:16:04] scripture's fulfilled i sinualized the
[1:16:07] prophet that is true but there's also
[1:16:09] more to that and he shall turn the
[1:16:11] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:16:13] of the apostolic fathers i can say this
[1:16:16] morning this day that scripture is being
[1:16:18] fulfilled right here in this building
[1:16:20] there's people who is the word made
[1:16:22] threat for this hour
[1:16:25] you say luke 17 30 the son of man didn't
[1:16:27] reveal that was in brother banner's
[1:16:29] ministry this day this great and i
[1:16:31] believe that too but why don't you
[1:16:32] finish it all and worship the carcass is
[1:16:35] there will the eagles be gathered
[1:16:37] together right here this morning is a
[1:16:39] group of eagles this day gathered around
[1:16:41] the caucus of the word of god brother we
[1:16:44] just ain't quoting the scriptures we are
[1:16:46] the scriptures being lived out to this
[1:16:48] day
[1:16:51] i know a mighty angel come down from
[1:16:52] heaven i know he was close with a cloud
[1:16:55] again i don't care what that crowd says
[1:16:57] brother bam said he was there picked up
[1:16:59] by seven angels guess what i believe he
[1:17:01] was picked up by seven angels
[1:17:05] got time to play with that reasoning
[1:17:07] crowd
[1:17:09] take some man's ideal who's unvindicated
[1:17:12] take his opinion over what god's
[1:17:14] interpreted
[1:17:15] then the bible said he come down with a
[1:17:17] mighty voice and when he came down
[1:17:20] revelation 17 he exposed the mother and
[1:17:23] all of his daughters but in revelation
[1:17:25] 18 he said come out of her everybody say
[1:17:27] my people
[1:17:28] sitting in this building is my people
[1:17:32] come on this day this scripture is being
[1:17:33] interpreted that's why you're not down
[1:17:35] there in denominations you're here
[1:17:37] fellowshipping around god's
[1:17:38] interpretation of the day because you're
[1:17:40] my people you heard a voice that say
[1:17:42] come out of it amen and we came out so
[1:17:44] therefore you're god's interpretation of
[1:17:47] that scripture
[1:17:49] i preached it years ago brother bran was
[1:17:52] you know you know he here he had such a
[1:17:55] tremendous i'll just say it he had the
[1:17:57] exact same ministry that jews
[1:17:58] experienced 2 000 years ago
[1:18:00] he didn't let us gentiles go in on
[1:18:03] theology
[1:18:04] god didn't let us go into theology at
[1:18:06] the end of the gentile age in the bright
[1:18:09] age he sent the exact same ministry that
[1:18:11] they witness at the end of the old
[1:18:12] testament
[1:18:15] but i could declare to you this morning
[1:18:17] and i know i gotta hurry
[1:18:18] but alpha's now become omega it ain't
[1:18:20] becoming omega it's already became omega
[1:18:23] the first is the last they're
[1:18:26] identically the same the first ministry
[1:18:27] in the last ministry is exactly the same
[1:18:32] i i preached this all over the world
[1:18:34] that's a rag right there right
[1:18:36] it's in my right pocket
[1:18:39] if i change this location to my left
[1:18:40] pocket
[1:18:41] did i change the rag
[1:18:44] no i only changed its location its
[1:18:47] position
[1:18:48] so when i say alpha's omega what i'm
[1:18:50] telling you the cornerstone has now
[1:18:52] become the the headstone it's still the
[1:18:55] same stone it's just in a different
[1:18:57] position
[1:18:58] come on he set this this head this
[1:19:00] christ it sat down on the church young
[1:19:03] people you got such a privilege and an
[1:19:05] honor this morning to hear the things
[1:19:06] that we hear when you play these pages
[1:19:08] open them years spend a little time in
[1:19:11] prayer sometimes we miss brother byler
[1:19:13] i've been telling my young people at
[1:19:14] home we got to get back to our prayer
[1:19:16] meetings we got to get back to them old
[1:19:17] fashioned time when we led the order we
[1:19:19] pray god's sweetened our spirit up open
[1:19:22] us up but then said you can never he
[1:19:24] said it we could sing too much brother
[1:19:26] we can do a lot of things too much he
[1:19:28] said there's one thing we can never do
[1:19:29] too much and that's praise
[1:19:31] i said we ought to pray twice as much as
[1:19:33] we listen to tapes so that what on them
[1:19:36] tape has got some good ground to get in
[1:19:38] there and produce fruit in our lives
[1:19:41] [Music]
[1:19:44] you love him say man see i told you now
[1:19:47] it's your fault not mine
[1:19:49] oh i just feel something turn over my
[1:19:51] soul this morning
[1:19:53] you love him
[1:19:54] now look paul was given a message
[1:19:57] and his message when he was struck down
[1:19:59] on the road to damascus going down there
[1:20:01] to kill christians i couldn't understand
[1:20:03] why christians were afraid of him i can
[1:20:06] understand why barnabas son of
[1:20:07] consolation had to convince his apostles
[1:20:09] don't be afraid something's happened in
[1:20:12] this man's life
[1:20:13] he met that pillar of fire
[1:20:15] he said who are you lord
[1:20:17] he said i'm jesus whom you persecute
[1:20:20] 15th chapter corinthians paul tells
[1:20:22] about how the apostles saw it after his
[1:20:24] resurrection seen 500 brother one time
[1:20:26] seen the cephas in the other and the
[1:20:27] women but then he turned around said but
[1:20:29] lost the ball he was seen of me paul
[1:20:32] didn't meet him in the form that other
[1:20:34] apostles met him in they met him in
[1:20:36] flesh paul didn't meet him in a fresh
[1:20:37] body he met him in the form that he was
[1:20:39] in after his resurrection which was that
[1:20:41] purifier that's why he preached jesus
[1:20:44] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:20:46] forever let me explain what i'm talking
[1:20:47] about then i'll get right down on into
[1:20:49] it he didn't preach christ jesus the
[1:20:51] same he preached jesus christ the same
[1:20:55] because you'll find out when paul talks
[1:20:56] about christ jesus he's talking about
[1:20:58] christ that anointed logos that became a
[1:21:01] man so it was christ jesus but when he
[1:21:03] preached jesus christ he was preaching
[1:21:05] jesus who went back in the form of what
[1:21:07] he's in before he came flesh and he said
[1:21:09] that's what's the same yesterday day
[1:21:11] forever it wasn't jesus of the man that
[1:21:13] met abraham back there no it was that
[1:21:15] logos that pillar of fire came down the
[1:21:17] form of a man called melchizedek come on
[1:21:20] now but later he was made flesh glory to
[1:21:23] god now tonight he said he's the same
[1:21:25] yesterday today and forever
[1:21:30] what makes i know i'm 51 but i feel 15
[1:21:32] tonight
[1:21:33] that makes my heart thrilled to be able
[1:21:35] to see that identified in my day what a
[1:21:38] blessed man i am tonight
[1:21:40] i heard this message when i was 18. i'm
[1:21:43] just as excited about it at 51 as i was
[1:21:45] when i was 18. this message turned my
[1:21:48] world around
[1:21:50] hallelujah thank god it did
[1:21:54] but he met that pillar of fire
[1:21:56] and there he
[1:21:57] sold out
[1:21:59] he said i didn't go to
[1:22:01] jerusalem i didn't confer the other
[1:22:03] apostles
[1:22:04] he'd go up and check out what god gave
[1:22:06] him by other men he said what i got i
[1:22:09] got directly from the revelation of
[1:22:11] jesus christ said glaciers when i
[1:22:13] certify your brother in the gospel i
[1:22:14] preach it's not after man neither was it
[1:22:16] given a man but it came by the
[1:22:18] revelation of jesus christ glory to god
[1:22:21] and i believe that
[1:22:22] so what happened was paul now listen now
[1:22:25] with a revelation but read the same old
[1:22:28] testament written by moses that he had
[1:22:30] always read he'd always studied because
[1:22:33] you've got to remember the new testament
[1:22:35] wasn't written when paul met christ
[1:22:38] the only thing he had to study was the
[1:22:40] old testament scriptures that's why in
[1:22:42] christians when he said christ died
[1:22:44] according to the scriptures he's not
[1:22:46] talking about the new testament he
[1:22:47] talked about the old testament he said
[1:22:49] but he was buried according he's talking
[1:22:52] about the old testament that he raised
[1:22:53] again on the third day according to the
[1:22:55] scriptures so the old testament spoke of
[1:22:57] christ as death spoke of his barrel
[1:22:59] spoke of his resurrection i'll go
[1:23:00] further it spoke of his birth it spoke
[1:23:03] of his life it spoke of his death it
[1:23:04] spoke with his bro it spoke of his
[1:23:06] resurrection and it also spoke of his
[1:23:08] second coming
[1:23:10] but all of a sudden now with a
[1:23:12] revelation meeting christ paul goes back
[1:23:14] and with a veil tore off his heart and
[1:23:16] off of his mind he goes back to the same
[1:23:18] scriptures but this time brother byler
[1:23:20] when he reads the scriptures all he can
[1:23:22] see is christ everywhere he looks he
[1:23:24] sees christ when he sees god coming down
[1:23:26] with a lamb and covered out of an earth
[1:23:28] he sees christ what is he's able to
[1:23:30] sacrifice he sees christ when he sees
[1:23:32] abraham taking isaac he sees christ
[1:23:34] everywhere he reads and looked in the
[1:23:36] old testament all he sees is christ and
[1:23:38] when he saw christ all he could see was
[1:23:41] grace
[1:23:44] so now he started preaching that new
[1:23:46] testament church we've got to come out a
[1:23:48] law
[1:23:49] come over and grab someone paul paul you
[1:23:51] mean to tell me that we can lay down all
[1:23:54] the law and all of it's been fulfilled
[1:23:56] and one man called jesus he said that's
[1:23:59] exactly what i'm telling you you don't
[1:24:00] have to go down the synagogue no more
[1:24:02] and go down to that priest god gave us a
[1:24:05] priest you ain't got to go down take no
[1:24:07] lamb no more god gave us a lamb you
[1:24:09] don't have to be afraid to walk behind
[1:24:11] the veil now god tore that tail and we
[1:24:14] can come right into the presence of
[1:24:15] almighty god through jesus christ
[1:24:20] hallelujah that takes away all human
[1:24:22] works and it makes it not works but
[1:24:24] makes it grace i'm here called the grace
[1:24:27] you young people believe this message
[1:24:29] because of grace
[1:24:30] you'll live for god cause of grace
[1:24:32] you'll take a rapture cause of grace
[1:24:35] because when the headstone comes it
[1:24:37] comes with challenge crying grace grace
[1:24:40] unto it
[1:24:44] you imagine
[1:24:45] he preaches over there and takes that
[1:24:47] whole hebrews brother bam tells him in
[1:24:49] hebrews says right to the first chapter
[1:24:51] the whole book of hebrews is exaltation
[1:24:54] of who
[1:24:56] moses
[1:24:58] the angels
[1:25:00] no the priest no
[1:25:02] the exaltation of jesus christ
[1:25:05] he's greater than the angels
[1:25:07] to which of the angels said he at any
[1:25:08] time
[1:25:09] thou art my son does they have a
[1:25:10] begotten me to none of them he said he's
[1:25:13] greater than moses he's greater than the
[1:25:15] law he's greater than the temple he's
[1:25:18] greater than the priest matter of fact
[1:25:20] he said he's not even a high priest
[1:25:22] after the order of aaron he's a high
[1:25:24] priest after the order of melchizedek he
[1:25:27] went on to say that by the blood of
[1:25:29] bulls and goats you can never take away
[1:25:32] sin he said but this
[1:25:34] man offered one sacrifice for sins
[1:25:37] forever or they caught by one offering
[1:25:40] he has perfected forever them that are
[1:25:42] sanctified but if i don't make you love
[1:25:44] him i don't know what will you mean
[1:25:46] preacher i don't have to fast to find
[1:25:47] favor you mean i don't have to go to
[1:25:49] church to find favor i don't have to
[1:25:51] preach to find favor i don't have to
[1:25:53] sing no
[1:25:54] you're accepted in the beloved because
[1:25:56] you're in christ you already got favor
[1:25:58] with god
[1:26:02] you know what he said every high priest
[1:26:04] offering up the same sacrifices
[1:26:06] daily could never take away sins
[1:26:09] and this is what his words were every
[1:26:11] high priest stand it daily
[1:26:13] offering the same sacrifices that can
[1:26:15] never take away sin you notice what he
[1:26:17] said every high priest standeth daily
[1:26:21] stand it daily you notice when they went
[1:26:23] into the holiness of all a holy place
[1:26:25] there was no place to sit down
[1:26:27] because their work would never be done
[1:26:29] but he said when this man offered one
[1:26:31] sacrifice for sin he didn't say stands
[1:26:33] he said he sets
[1:26:35] he offered one sacrifice princeton and
[1:26:37] sets down because his work is finished
[1:26:39] lord of god you don't have to do
[1:26:41] anything he's already did it you don't
[1:26:43] have to bring a sacrifice he's already
[1:26:45] did it he's not asking for your blood
[1:26:46] he's already got his own blood we don't
[1:26:49] justify ourselves by our righteousness
[1:26:50] he's already justified us in the sight
[1:26:52] of god as though we never sin in the
[1:26:55] first place
[1:26:56] now listen what i'm getting to now paul
[1:26:58] was trying to bring him from law over in
[1:27:00] the grace i'll tell you what he was
[1:27:02] doing he was putting the baton of faith
[1:27:04] in her hand and said here's the baton of
[1:27:06] faith not works faith not law faith
[1:27:09] grace
[1:27:11] take this baton and run
[1:27:15] run
[1:27:16] and they were now to i mean they he
[1:27:18] wanted them to run
[1:27:20] from law the way joseph ran from
[1:27:23] potiphar's wife
[1:27:25] run your life depends on it your
[1:27:27] reputation depends on it
[1:27:32] and what he was trying to get in the sea
[1:27:34] now
[1:27:35] that we're in a race
[1:27:36] [Music]
[1:27:37] let me hurry we're in a race
[1:27:39] we're in a race you know
[1:27:42] i'm going to say this
[1:27:43] brother joe
[1:27:45] day of pentecost peter
[1:27:47] got so drunk on the spirit he preached
[1:27:50] one sermon
[1:27:51] and 3 000 souls were added to the church
[1:27:54] today
[1:27:55] between me and you and brother byler and
[1:27:57] all these other brothers we got to
[1:27:59] preach 3 000 sermons just get one soul
[1:28:01] at it
[1:28:04] people's let this get common to them
[1:28:07] god we should never let that happen to
[1:28:08] us
[1:28:09] so let me say what i get to what i'm
[1:28:11] saying
[1:28:12] we're running a race now
[1:28:14] each one of us that have come into
[1:28:16] christ
[1:28:18] the baton is in your hand now paul i
[1:28:20] don't have time i preach this stuff in
[1:28:21] five six sermons at home but he he uses
[1:28:25] many analogies and most of them are
[1:28:26] sports
[1:28:28] to express truth
[1:28:30] i can show you he used boxing he used
[1:28:32] wrestling he used running he used a
[1:28:34] farmer sowing seed i mean there's all
[1:28:37] kind of analogies the human body that
[1:28:39] man and his wife all kind of
[1:28:41] acknowledges expression the one i want
[1:28:43] to borrow this morning take your mind in
[1:28:44] this direction
[1:28:46] is running the race this race of faith
[1:28:49] every believer
[1:28:50] once he's in christ
[1:28:52] is in a race and you are running
[1:28:55] for your life
[1:28:59] running to obtain listen now an
[1:29:02] incorruptible
[1:29:03] crown
[1:29:05] right you're not going to get following
[1:29:06] this message don't expect a lot of
[1:29:09] accolades from the world you're not
[1:29:10] going to get them
[1:29:13] it's not going to happen you don't even
[1:29:14] hardly get them from people who claim to
[1:29:15] believe it
[1:29:16] much less get it from the world so
[1:29:18] you're running to
[1:29:20] to win a prize we're going to be down in
[1:29:22] that just a minute each one of us that
[1:29:24] run this race have to realize we're
[1:29:26] running a race oh hallelujah where i
[1:29:29] believe brother butler i can see the
[1:29:30] finish line
[1:29:32] in sight
[1:29:34] i'm gonna say it like this to you
[1:29:36] all them that's going on is depending on
[1:29:39] you to finish this race
[1:29:43] time now is blending with eternity
[1:29:47] that means that there's no one after us
[1:29:50] listen folks if what we know is true
[1:29:52] when our prophet preached to us there is
[1:29:54] not eight ages
[1:29:57] there are not seven and a half ages
[1:29:59] more than there's eight messengers seven
[1:30:00] i have messengers william brown is our
[1:30:03] last major word prophet
[1:30:05] there won't be another one after him
[1:30:08] the next one's coming it's coming to
[1:30:09] israel and you bunch of gentiles don't
[1:30:11] waste your time
[1:30:13] unless you've got a dark complexion a
[1:30:14] long nose stay right here in america
[1:30:17] keep believing brother branham now y'all
[1:30:19] don't know what i was talking about paul
[1:30:20] remember the hook knows jesus ain't
[1:30:22] making fun of nobody's hook
[1:30:26] but the point i'm saying is them other
[1:30:27] two prophets aren't the gentiles they're
[1:30:29] to jews this is our last gentile major
[1:30:32] word prophet
[1:30:34] there will not i didn't say it wouldn't
[1:30:36] be prophets but they ain't gonna be
[1:30:37] another major word prophet that's your
[1:30:38] last one
[1:30:40] so three seven eight messengers then
[1:30:43] there ain't eight ages we're now in the
[1:30:44] bright coming of christ where the bride
[1:30:46] comes out of the church she's dressed
[1:30:48] with a message for the second coming of
[1:30:50] our lord that's happening right here
[1:30:52] this morning it's already taking place
[1:30:54] the bride is being called out so what
[1:30:56] happened when the seed went the ground
[1:30:58] according to john 12 24 brother being
[1:31:00] applied that to the bride just like he
[1:31:02] did to the groom
[1:31:04] and we went in the ground we but by the
[1:31:06] time we got to the fourth church age the
[1:31:08] seed went in the dark denominational
[1:31:09] dirt wrong
[1:31:10] but then a light came boring
[1:31:13] a light came it's like i was talking
[1:31:14] about last night about that weed growing
[1:31:16] in them cracks you know why that
[1:31:19] that concrete because it don't grow down
[1:31:21] it grows to the light
[1:31:23] and that seed and you go
[1:31:24] goes to light
[1:31:26] my wife and i visited uh a little case
[1:31:29] over in uh athens tennessee area called
[1:31:31] the uh royal sea but now they were in
[1:31:34] this dark room was wherever they put
[1:31:36] lights there was plants growing up i
[1:31:39] asked old fellas the joke plant does he
[1:31:41] said no birds fly and drop the seed we
[1:31:43] just put light in here and
[1:31:45] them them seeds got life in them and
[1:31:47] they grow to the light
[1:31:48] hey brother satan's tried everything he
[1:31:50] can to keep your young people believing
[1:31:51] this message but there's a predestinated
[1:31:54] seed in you it'll grow to the light
[1:31:56] it'll recognize the word
[1:31:58] don't care what anybody else does
[1:32:00] there's something in you toward the word
[1:32:01] of god it'll find you one way or another
[1:32:05] so what happened god sent right in the
[1:32:07] reformation out of the reformation come
[1:32:09] martin luther god put the baton of
[1:32:12] justification in his hand and he started
[1:32:13] running with all that's within him but
[1:32:15] he could only run so far but there met
[1:32:18] him at the end of his run was a man by
[1:32:19] the name of john wesley he put
[1:32:22] the baton
[1:32:23] over in his hand and john the ground
[1:32:25] john wesley could only thrown as far as
[1:32:27] he could and put that baton in the hands
[1:32:30] of pentecost and the pentecostals ran as
[1:32:32] far as they can but guess what tonight
[1:32:34] they've handed that baton over to you
[1:32:36] you're the people that's got that baton
[1:32:38] and guess what you ain't handing it off
[1:32:40] to nobody else you're going to cross the
[1:32:42] finish line
[1:32:44] and faith without us cannot be made
[1:32:46] perfect hey this ain't the hour to
[1:32:48] stumble and ain't down to get your eyes
[1:32:50] on the crowd that's watching it's keep
[1:32:52] your eyes on the finish line keep
[1:32:53] running this way how long i have to run
[1:32:55] by luke until your body's changed we
[1:32:58] don't have time to sit down settle down
[1:33:00] we got to take this message and run with
[1:33:02] it until our bodies are changed
[1:33:07] the finish line the finish line remember
[1:33:10] they without us
[1:33:12] cannot be made perfect
[1:33:14] the sad thing is
[1:33:16] and i don't i'm not saying this to
[1:33:18] anybody in here but i'm just going to
[1:33:19] say what i got to say
[1:33:21] we're finding
[1:33:22] brother better less runners
[1:33:26] now
[1:33:27] matter of fact it's sad but we're seeing
[1:33:29] many people who used to run well
[1:33:31] that don't run so well today
[1:33:33] they've got in the stands and they
[1:33:35] become spectators instead of
[1:33:36] participators
[1:33:38] matter of fact someone even left the
[1:33:39] track decided they won't want to run no
[1:33:42] more i got dear preacher friends the day
[1:33:45] that sold out they got their eye on some
[1:33:47] wild woman somewhere and took their eye
[1:33:50] off the prize
[1:33:51] might as well say it's the truth young
[1:33:53] people the devil is going to shake
[1:33:54] everything he can in front of you get
[1:33:56] your eyes off this message but whatever
[1:33:58] you do if your brother man said look to
[1:33:59] the right and look to the left look
[1:34:01] forward look back say if you ain't got
[1:34:02] nowhere to look look up keep your eye on
[1:34:05] christ i'll finish my message this
[1:34:07] morning with that thought keep your eye
[1:34:08] on christ you've got to keep your eye
[1:34:10] you'll say well preachers fail so what
[1:34:13] christ don't churches fail so what
[1:34:15] christ don't yeah but this my friend
[1:34:18] fell show what christ knows you ain't
[1:34:21] making about them you're making it by
[1:34:23] christ amen you stay in there until god
[1:34:26] has sealed you with the holy spirit and
[1:34:29] you're sealed in i got news for you the
[1:34:31] devil is still out you're going to have
[1:34:33] to run this race you're going to have
[1:34:34] your struggles you're going to have your
[1:34:36] obstacles you're going to have your
[1:34:37] battle but if you've got that tie pose
[1:34:39] down on the inside the inside that
[1:34:41] anchors you to christ keep your eye on
[1:34:43] christ and run until you finish this
[1:34:46] race
[1:34:49] less runners
[1:34:50] most
[1:34:52] this is a sobering thought but most
[1:34:54] runners
[1:34:56] that will make up the rapture
[1:34:58] is already in the graves
[1:35:01] the majority of them
[1:35:03] that are going in the rapture is laying
[1:35:05] in graves this morning
[1:35:08] as the pyramid i know i got one at home
[1:35:11] but
[1:35:11] and i use it as an illustration a lot of
[1:35:13] times people would love to take the
[1:35:14] pyramid and flip it upside down
[1:35:16] and say we're in the wide age we're not
[1:35:19] the pyramids got to stay the way it is
[1:35:22] the majority there it is the majority
[1:35:24] that make up the rapture look at how
[1:35:27] wide that base is but as we get near to
[1:35:29] the headstone it gets to be fewer all
[1:35:31] the time so let me tell you something
[1:35:33] young people it's good i mean it's good

[1:39:21] you ever heard that song

[1:39:33] but listen my son's just getting married

[1:40:23] calls me lord
[1:40:25] i said no brother carver that's not
[1:40:27] possible yes she does i'll tell her to
[1:40:29] give me a glass of water she'll say oh
[1:40:31] lord gerald get it yourself

[1:40:45] he's a good man she's a good woman
[1:40:48] he was kidding but jeremiah you know i
[1:40:50] told his mom and said mom i can't make
[1:40:52] that boy
[1:40:53] you know do for him for two solid weeks
[1:40:55] and i said that's the ironing clothes i
[1:40:57] don't like iron clothes i learned when i
[1:40:59] was young 16 because i went out on the
[1:41:00] field in the pitch i was church
[1:41:01] preaching my mama taught me how to iron
[1:41:03] clothes and you know how i put the
[1:41:04] creases there and the way to do it and
[1:41:06] in school my clothes were so ironed so
[1:41:09] bright in high school that i made best
[1:41:11] dressed because my mama always dressed
[1:41:13] me just just just always had my shirt
[1:41:16] tucked in always it looked like a little
[1:41:17] pentecostal well my wife told me when
[1:41:19] she met me i come to the church he said
[1:41:21] we smelled you when you come into
[1:41:22] brother yancey's church
[1:41:24] she said i turn around and look to see
[1:41:25] who this guy was with this roman coming
[1:41:27] off of him and said look like a little
[1:41:29] pentecostal prep came in
[1:41:32] i said well must have done something for
[1:41:33] you you married him
[1:41:38] so she said won't you take jeremiah i
[1:41:39] said mama jeremiah's not gonna go
[1:41:41] he's a mama's boy i'm not iron his
[1:41:43] clothes i'm just not gonna do it for two
[1:41:45] weeks
[1:41:46] said you should so i'll teach him how to
[1:41:48] iron i said well whatever you want to do
[1:41:49] i said just go ask him and i was in the
[1:41:51] room praying god don't let that boy go
[1:41:54] i'm going to tell you the main reason
[1:41:56] wasn't because i iron the clothes
[1:41:57] because it's going to cost me another 2
[1:41:58] 400 to take him and i didn't wanna spend
[1:42:00] twenty four hundred dollars on that boy
[1:42:02] and so mama come back in there you
[1:42:04] remember she came back a few minutes ago
[1:42:05] and said later and said luke he said
[1:42:07] he'd go
[1:42:10] so i got online dealt airlines got him a
[1:42:13] ticket got it already i'm thinking
[1:42:14] nothing about it
[1:42:16] got down to port elizabeth south africa
[1:42:18] to preach my first message that night a
[1:42:20] little small church probably is about as
[1:42:22] wide as that here to here they squeezed
[1:42:25] in about 100 some people hot in there
[1:42:27] that night and usually i'm nervous
[1:42:29] brother you know how did you get nervous
[1:42:31] first place and i'm back in the office
[1:42:32] and i'm getting nervous but i'm getting
[1:42:34] really nervous because
[1:42:36] the message that i want to preach seems
[1:42:37] like the burning of it's lifting from me
[1:42:40] and i like to preach by inspiration i
[1:42:41] like to walk out and know i got the mind
[1:42:43] of god for that particular service and i
[1:42:44] was tore up back and i said god what in
[1:42:47] the world's going on so i just did what
[1:42:49] i only think i know to do it got on my
[1:42:50] knees started praying and a little voice
[1:42:52] inside said don't you preach that
[1:42:56] i set back up in the chair and say lord
[1:42:58] i got all kind of messy but what what am
[1:43:00] i and it's like something just as clear
[1:43:02] as anything said pick up your bible i
[1:43:03] picked it up and i opened the john
[1:43:05] chapter five and i'm
[1:43:08] telling you i read it and it was about
[1:43:10] the angel coming out and stirring the
[1:43:11] water
[1:43:12] and something spoke to me and said go
[1:43:14] out there and preach
[1:43:16] a season of troubling and i went out and
[1:43:18] preached that when god troubles the
[1:43:20] waters
[1:43:21] and my my thought that night was this
[1:43:24] whosoever will can come
[1:43:26] but not when so ever
[1:43:29] anybody can come but only when god calls
[1:43:32] when he stirs the water i preach that
[1:43:35] and here's a whole audience but only one
[1:43:37] boy in that building that night is
[1:43:39] weeping and crying
[1:43:42] he wouldn't quit i looked back and
[1:43:44] there's that jeremiah my old son
[1:43:46] weeping and crying i said what in the
[1:43:48] world is going on that boy's heard me
[1:43:50] for 18 years that night sitting he was
[1:43:52] it was like i say it was here but he was
[1:43:54] sitting kind of back there and he kept
[1:43:56] crying and i had two brother bills that
[1:43:58] traveled with me and both of them sit on
[1:43:59] sign he sat and they got to crying
[1:44:01] because he was crying
[1:44:03] and brother in that service i made an
[1:44:04] altar call for them to come to christ
[1:44:07] the only boy in that building that
[1:44:08] lifted his hand said he wanted to give
[1:44:10] himself to christ was my son
[1:44:14] here mama may have thought it was just a
[1:44:16] little feeling she was having but it was
[1:44:18] the leadership of the lord daddy didn't
[1:44:20] want to take him and i thought it was
[1:44:21] just her wanting him to travel with me
[1:44:23] and god was orchestrating that thing he
[1:44:26] had a little something for jeremiah in
[1:44:28] that meeting and brother we got back to
[1:44:30] the little part where we were standing i
[1:44:31] knelt down started praying thanking the
[1:44:33] lord for doing something for jeremiah
[1:44:35] and i felt a presence come in and i
[1:44:37] raised the cover up over my head i was
[1:44:39] little down the couch in the living room
[1:44:41] it was jeremiah setting another count he
[1:44:43] was crying i said what's wrong son he
[1:44:45] said daddy i fully surrendered myself to
[1:44:47] the lord tonight i gave my heart to
[1:44:49] christ i said boy you know what's next
[1:44:51] you've heard me tell it he said daddy i
[1:44:53] know to be baptized i said when we get
[1:44:55] home he said get home daddy after two
[1:44:57] weeks i got to be baptized now i took
[1:45:00] him down to the water in the pool at the
[1:45:01] church baptized him in the name of the
[1:45:03] lord jesus christ i see god radically
[1:45:06] changed that boy changed desire thought
[1:45:08] he was going to college and go go here
[1:45:10] and do this but something turned him
[1:45:12] around i'm not against that i'm just
[1:45:13] telling you god's got a path for us he
[1:45:16] puts that baton in your head and you
[1:45:17] gotta run my point is this jeremiah
[1:45:20] couldn't go on on daddy's coat
[1:45:23] well jeremiah couldn't go on a mama
[1:45:25] skirt jeremiah had to have a personal
[1:45:27] relationship with jesus christ just like
[1:45:29] every one of you hey brother i'm just
[1:45:31] going to tell you i told my boys i said
[1:45:33] sean you can live in this house as long
[1:45:35] as you like and if you ain't got no
[1:45:37] conviction you can borrow mine until you
[1:45:38] get your own and they went to church
[1:45:41] they never asked us as i said other
[1:45:42] night my seven children never ask us are
[1:45:45] we going to church tonight they knew on
[1:45:47] wednesdays and sundays we're going to
[1:45:48] church and if there's revival we're
[1:45:50] going to church paul ain't coming before
[1:45:52] church school ain't coming before church
[1:45:54] we put the house of god first in our
[1:45:56] lives i'm just tell you where it is hey
[1:46:00] and with all that they still don't know
[1:46:02] christ until they meet him here's what
[1:46:05] i'm saying to you rules don't put you in
[1:46:07] this race leaving my mom and daddy's
[1:46:09] standards don't put you in this race but
[1:46:11] when one day them rules come off of a
[1:46:14] book and them standards and their
[1:46:16] principles come off a book and go down
[1:46:18] into your heart glory to god and put you
[1:46:20] in the race now now you got to pretend
[1:46:22] baton you got christ now and you go to
[1:46:25] church not because mom and daddy does
[1:46:27] you go to church because you love to go
[1:46:29] to church when mom and dad is sitting at
[1:46:31] home you're still in the house of god
[1:46:32] you don't know how many young people
[1:46:34] i've seen god get a hold of mom and
[1:46:36] daddy make an excuse why they don't want
[1:46:37] to go to church on wednesday night and
[1:46:39] that young person still showed up that
[1:46:41] shows god has done something inside of
[1:46:44] them that they don't have a
[1:46:45] second-handed robe but they got a
[1:46:47] first-hand revelation from the holy
[1:46:49] spirit a new birth that's put them in
[1:46:52] christ and now they're in the race
[1:47:00] let me tell you this i gotta hurry
[1:47:03] he said run this race

[1:47:26] something
[1:47:27] i said that danny williams i told you
[1:47:29] other than that daniel you've told me
[1:47:30] that he said when i was 21 year old boy
[1:47:32] two had twins our first kids were twins

[1:47:35] a boy sitting with a girl the other
[1:47:37] night out there last night i said are
[1:47:38] y'all brother and sister i knew they
[1:47:39] weren't i said y'all brothers and
[1:47:41] sisters no
[1:47:43] i said boyfriend girlfriend he said
[1:47:44] trying to be
[1:47:49] so pray man pray
[1:47:51] pray pray pray
[1:47:54] i was dating my wife lisa
[1:47:56] my daddy on the construction business
[1:47:57] florida
[1:47:58] i used to call her back then brother joe
[1:48:01] we didn't have flip phones like y'all we
[1:48:02] didn't have that if us guys were going
[1:48:04] to have a phone it'd like to be carrying
[1:48:06] a purse we weren't getting out of that
[1:48:08] car with no purse
[1:48:09] we didn't wear these things you wrap
[1:48:11] around there's two fenders looking we
[1:48:12] just didn't do it and i'd leave that bag
[1:48:15] in the side between the two seats i
[1:48:17] travel leave that there my daddy gave it
[1:48:18] to me still remember and i'd had to open
[1:48:20] that up and get the phone out
[1:48:22] u.s cellular or something like that
[1:48:24] oh i'm talking about you kids don't know
[1:48:26] nothing about it
[1:48:28] y'all do don't you
[1:48:30] yeah and i'd get that phone and i didn't
[1:48:32] think about cost i didn't realize it
[1:48:34] cost per minute
[1:48:36] and so i was calling lisa
[1:48:38] and we'd fall asleep and
[1:48:40] she said loop what
[1:48:42] you said oh no just breathing hard
[1:48:46] and we uh
[1:48:48] i got home from the meetings and dad got
[1:48:50] the deal and it was a thousand dollars
[1:48:54] a thousand dollars about didn't like a
[1:48:55] thousand dollars a day that's a lot of
[1:48:57] money
[1:48:58] you know and so my dad said son
[1:49:01] you're not going to preach
[1:49:03] you're coming off the field you're going
[1:49:04] to work till you pay this
[1:49:06] bill
[1:49:07] that's all right you know i preached for
[1:49:09] pentecostals you know they were oneness
[1:49:11] and that's about all you got in the
[1:49:12] offering was ones and so you couldn't
[1:49:14] afford to pay no thousand dollar phone
[1:49:16] bill
[1:49:17] that's why i'm glad somebody believed it
[1:49:19] was 120 got baptized in the upper room
[1:49:22] and so uh anyways
[1:49:24] my dad made me work and i had to pay
[1:49:26] that thousand dollars but i found out i
[1:49:27] told you i said lisa you don't be
[1:49:28] cheaper if i marry you
[1:49:31] but you were paying a thousand dollar
[1:49:32] phone bill then i married her and seven
[1:49:34] kids come along and said you know i've
[1:49:35] been cheaper if i just kept paying
[1:49:36] thousand dollar phone bills
[1:49:44] it might say patience
[1:49:46] well the word patience isn't like
[1:49:48] waiting let me tell you what patience
[1:49:49] really means it means endurance
[1:49:53] run the race with endurance
[1:49:57] now listen to this here's what's strange
[1:49:58] the word race is where we get the word
[1:50:01] in english agony
[1:50:05] run because there's going to be times
[1:50:07] like brother bam called this message the
[1:50:09] bread of affliction
[1:50:12] sometimes it's gonna be painful but you
[1:50:14] keep running
[1:50:16] sometimes you're gonna fall
[1:50:18] get back up
[1:50:19] sometimes you might fall flat on your
[1:50:21] face
[1:50:22] don't stay there the difference between
[1:50:25] them that win and then the dope is them
[1:50:27] they keep running
[1:50:29] even in hard times
[1:50:31] when the race gets hard and there's
[1:50:34] affliction there's agony you got to keep
[1:50:36] oh here's the word i used last night
[1:50:38] commitment
[1:50:40] you got to be determined in your own
[1:50:41] heart if nobody else makes it i'm going
[1:50:44] to keep running
[1:50:45] i'm not quitting i'm not stopping i have
[1:50:48] committed my life to christ and instead
[1:50:50] committed to him i'll tell you something
[1:50:52] when that happens you'll find out one of
[1:50:54] these days as you get older it ain't you
[1:50:56] holding him it's him holding you
[1:50:59] i tell you i say this
[1:51:01] all the time
[1:51:03] and i mean this i hate to say it this
[1:51:04] way but you get so far in christ you
[1:51:07] couldn't quit if you wanted to
[1:51:12] remember that sith that i talked about
[1:51:14] that first night
[1:51:15] one of the great symptom times came in
[1:51:17] john 6.
[1:51:20] all jesus said was except you eat the
[1:51:22] flesh the man drinks blood got no life
[1:51:23] in you
[1:51:24] all the preachers and everybody walked
[1:51:27] away from him then he turned to twelve
[1:51:29] said were y'all also
[1:51:30] simpson time came
[1:51:32] they said
[1:51:33] whom shall we go
[1:51:35] i'm going to tell you something not one
[1:51:36] of those apostles could have stood there
[1:51:37] and said hey lord we go nowhere we
[1:51:39] understood exactly what you said
[1:51:42] i'm going to tell you something them 12
[1:51:43] didn't understand that statement no more
[1:51:45] than
[1:51:46] that bunch walked away
[1:51:49] the only difference between them 12 and
[1:51:51] them ones that walked away is not
[1:51:53] because they understood his state
[1:51:54] but they understood the one who made the
[1:51:57] statement
[1:51:59] sometimes it ain't what you understand
[1:52:02] and it
[1:52:03] ain't what you know it's who you know
[1:52:07] can you lift your hand and say praise
[1:52:08] the lord
[1:52:09] now i ran to race and it when we talk
[1:52:11] about agony when you're preparing to run
[1:52:14] a race you know as well as i do it ain't
[1:52:16] easy sometimes you don't even want to
[1:52:17] show up
[1:52:18] you don't want to show up to the track
[1:52:20] you don't want to do what the coach asks
[1:52:22] you to do but you got to stay committed
[1:52:26] it's got to stay committed well i had a
[1:52:28] coach
[1:52:29] when i was about i think i was 13 12
[1:52:33] i was going to play i was in the
[1:52:35] all-star baseball game and i had a track
[1:52:37] meet on saturday
[1:52:38] and i was running the mile run
[1:52:41] and my coach was a wonderful fella but
[1:52:44] he told me that morning we were in the
[1:52:46] state finals and if i won the state then
[1:52:48] i would go up to washington n.c and i'd
[1:52:50] run for the national east side of the
[1:52:52] country my time and the mile was five
[1:52:55] minutes and 46 seconds
[1:52:58] that's fast for a little fella
[1:53:01] that was my speed
[1:53:03] and my coach said to me said luke in
[1:53:05] this state there's a boy there
[1:53:08] that you can't beat him
[1:53:11] well that's a good coach ain't it
[1:53:13] real encouraging
[1:53:15] you can't beat this kid he's got a time
[1:53:17] but i just don't think you can hang with
[1:53:18] him but i want you to try just give it a
[1:53:20] try
[1:53:21] well i went home and told my dad he said
[1:53:23] daddy ain't really no sense of me going
[1:53:25] he said why i said the coach told me i
[1:53:27] couldn't win he said what
[1:53:29] got my dad mad
[1:53:30] because my dad wasn't like this modern
[1:53:32] stuff oh everybody gets a trophy
[1:53:36] [Music]
[1:53:37] you know that happened when got mama's
[1:53:39] involved
[1:53:41] got all them bleeding hearts involved
[1:53:43] and these women want to coach these men
[1:53:46] coach these boys i did that when i
[1:53:47] coached little league the the ymca fell
[1:53:50] came to me and said look i hate to tell
[1:53:52] you this but y'all had a championship

[1:54:46] i said glory to god
[1:54:48] and i coached them boys and i'll tell
[1:54:50] you something about them in a minute but
[1:54:52] my dad was a type of guy like they told
[1:54:54] me well women don't matter he said what
[1:54:56] the name of god when it don't matter why

[1:55:25] we got to the track meet there were
[1:55:27] several coaches around there and my time
[1:55:29] was pretty fast but this particular boy
[1:55:31] he was fast had a great time and in my
[1:55:34] heart i didn't think i could beat him
[1:55:36] but my dad believed i could
[1:55:38] so i figured this one time i'm gonna
[1:55:41] listen to my dad instead the coach
[1:55:43] here's what my daddy told me
[1:55:45] he said son i want you to run with
[1:55:47] endurance
[1:55:49] and this this was a statement to me
[1:55:51] he said when you run
[1:55:53] i want you to be patient
[1:55:56] i don't ever want you to run beside him
[1:55:59] i don't ever want you to get ahead of
[1:56:00] him
[1:56:01] i want you to run three laps on his
[1:56:04] heels
[1:56:06] you make him conscious that you were
[1:56:08] there
[1:56:09] he said on that last lap you give it
[1:56:11] everything you've got you know
[1:56:14] i started that race and i stayed on that
[1:56:17] guy's back hills just running you know
[1:56:19] we were in a certain pace and he was
[1:56:21] you're getting a certain pace when
[1:56:22] you're running and he was ahead of me
[1:56:23] but i me and he he was running and he
[1:56:26] because i can do this constantly do this
[1:56:28] and i knew then i had his attention he's
[1:56:30] waiting for me to get up with him i
[1:56:32] wouldn't with three laps i stayed with
[1:56:33] her and my daddy knew if i could stay
[1:56:35] there making con
[1:56:36] he would exert more energy
[1:56:39] and he exerted all of his energy on that
[1:56:41] last round man it was like i don't know
[1:56:43] like superman came in me and i started
[1:56:46] running and i beat that kid by half a
[1:56:48] lap
[1:56:49] my coach was shocked and there was only
[1:56:51] one person in the whole audience
[1:56:53] screaming hollering and was my daddy
[1:56:56] that's my boy i knew he could do it and
[1:56:59] all i did was listen to my daddy's
[1:57:00] instruction now here's what i want to
[1:57:02] tell you our daddy came down this hour
[1:57:05] and gave us instructions
[1:57:07] he gave us a message to teach us how to
[1:57:09] win this and when ain't nobody else
[1:57:11] rooting for you jesus is rooting for you
[1:57:14] that's my boy that's my girl they can
[1:57:16] make it by the grace of god
[1:57:25] isn't that good
[1:57:26] [Applause]
[1:57:29] what happens is i want to give this to
[1:57:30] you i'm hurrying brother david i'm about
[1:57:33] to close
[1:57:34] listen
[1:57:37] christianity young people listen to me
[1:57:39] christianity is not a sprint
[1:57:43] it's a marathon
[1:57:46] so when you come out of the blocks like
[1:57:48] a lot of people do brother
[1:57:49] bowler you've seen them they'll come out
[1:57:50] of the blocks red hot sizzling running
[1:57:52] as fast as they can oh i'm a christian
[1:57:54] i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make it and
[1:57:55] they don't even make it to the next
[1:57:56] revival
[1:58:00] because they think it's a
[1:58:02] sprint and what you have to realize
[1:58:04] i've seen them do it i've seen it in
[1:58:06] races take off
[1:58:07] brother they get
[1:58:08] running hard they can trying to beat the
[1:58:10] crowd they get around that bend you can
[1:58:12] watch their legs
[1:58:13] wobble a little bit
[1:58:15] they're about finished they ain't gonna
[1:58:16] make it there's no way they can make it
[1:58:18] they didn't set themselves right they
[1:58:19] didn't get in that motion that they're
[1:58:21] supposed to be in hey
[1:58:23] how you saying there's a motion with
[1:58:24] this word
[1:58:26] there's a cycle with it you're getting
[1:58:27] the holy ghost getting a spirit and
[1:58:29] you're running these tapes amen at your
[1:58:32] coach that's teaching you how to do it
[1:58:33] that's teaching how to win hey how i can
[1:58:36] overcome
[1:58:39] and what happens is this message
[1:58:41] i found out it's not for sprinters
[1:58:45] it's people who are in this
[1:58:48] for the long run
[1:58:51] how long you've been running now you
[1:58:52] said that last night you've been running
[1:58:54] how long now 40 years
[1:58:57] 35 35
[1:58:59] i heard it when i'm 18 i'm 51. it's
[1:59:02] still as fresh as it was
[1:59:04] when i was 18 years old
[1:59:06] brother you've been raised around
[1:59:08] manhattan
[1:59:09] one day you met christ it became yours
[1:59:12] you've been running a long time a lot of
[1:59:14] elders in here been around a long time
[1:59:16] some you know i got elders in my church
[1:59:18] i tell our young people don't go ask
[1:59:20] opinions from another young person
[1:59:22] about something very serious in life
[1:59:25] most times they're going to tell you
[1:59:26] what you want to hear they won't hurt
[1:59:27] your feelings go down under them old oak
[1:59:30] trees
[1:59:30] that's been serving a god a long time
[1:59:33] don't get so haughty that you think you
[1:59:34] can't learn something i got some old oak
[1:59:37] trees in our church you know brother
[1:59:38] bill i mean some respectful men that
[1:59:40] even i today 51 year old these 81 year
[1:59:43] old men ask their opinion about things
[1:59:45] things i got to make decisions in the
[1:59:46] church what do you think about this i
[1:59:48] bounce off of them see because every men
[1:59:50] got some wisdom about it they've been
[1:59:52] around a long time
[1:59:54] some of them got gray hair some got
[1:59:56] white hair and some of them got no hair
[2:00:00] but down on the inside of that heart
[2:00:02] beats wisdom
[2:00:04] beats understanding they've been running
[2:00:06] this way a long time they know it's a
[2:00:09] marathon and they know they gotta run
[2:00:12] with endurance it's that that endurance
[2:00:14] is that sort of it's sort of that uh
[2:00:16] what we would call well i'll call it
[2:00:18] like this it's that sustained kind of
[2:00:21] running
[2:00:21] it ain't really the running that can
[2:00:23] handle everything or that can take
[2:00:25] everything it's the ideal of mastering
[2:00:27] everything
[2:00:29] as brother bannon would say perfect
[2:00:32] faith what's it do masters all what
[2:00:37] circumstances that's what it does it
[2:00:40] just keeps sometimes like the old story
[2:00:42] i remember the kid the tortoise and the
[2:00:44] hair
[2:00:45] y'all remember that
[2:00:47] and one starts out putting the other
[2:00:48] ones just gradually just making it
[2:00:51] sometimes
[2:00:52] it's sunday morning
[2:00:54] homer lockhorn his wife anybody remember
[2:00:56] sister longoria i first preached for
[2:00:59] homer i wasn't even married i'm still

[2:01:16] about

[2:02:11] pray and read hey that's what happens
[2:02:13] when it becomes personal becomes your
[2:02:15] sometimes you might be slow but it's
[2:02:16] that sustain and kind like sometimes
[2:02:19] like getting one
[2:02:21] foot over the other but as long as i'm
[2:02:22] still moving as long as i'm still
[2:02:24] running as long as i'm still making it
[2:02:26] sometimes i get sidetracked but
[2:02:28] something gets me back in sometime they
[2:02:30] get off something gets me back and
[2:02:32] sometimes i feel like i'm taking two
[2:02:33] steps back one step for at least i'm
[2:02:36] still fighting at least i'm still
[2:02:37] running i hope you young people listen

[2:03:02] i gotta hurry here
[2:03:06] i coach
[2:03:08] well
[2:03:09] i coach baseball
[2:03:12] oh david back there they got me when i
[2:03:14] fresh come out pentecost pastor in
[2:03:16] arkansas for about three years i wish
[2:03:18] i'd stayed brother hair i wish i stayed
[2:03:20] six more months
[2:03:22] i stayed three years in arkansas
[2:03:24] and i left some my closest friends are
[2:03:27] from arkansas now but
[2:03:29] i wish i'd stayed six more months three
[2:03:30] and a half years i said why why six
[2:03:32] months what's the big deal i said cause
[2:03:34] i know i'd have been raptured about that
[2:03:36] been my three and a half years of
[2:03:37] tribulation
[2:03:46] i taught our kids
[2:03:48] through baseball i taught them the
[2:03:50] principal reason i was saying that's
[2:03:51] because david's brother is my dear
[2:03:53] friend he played softball when i came to
[2:03:55] arkansas
[2:03:56] you all know i was so legal i kicked him
[2:03:58] off the trusty board because he played
[2:04:00] softball
[2:04:02] i said that's out of the world
[2:04:04] saw the devil ain't no business no son
[2:04:05] of god got any business out there
[2:04:06] playing softball
[2:04:08] you think he quit no i quit the trustee
[2:04:10] board
[2:04:12] a few years later i had a few kids
[2:04:14] and my kids were playing baseball and
[2:04:16] they saw pictures of me out on the field
[2:04:18] and i took my oldest boys we went to the
[2:04:20] world series baseball world series and i
[2:04:22] was coaching and uh oh daryl couldn't
[2:04:25] believe it
[2:04:26] that preacher backslid
[2:04:29] kid he kicked me off a trusty board
[2:04:32] letting his boys play
[2:04:33] boys
[2:04:36] a lot of principles of life about
[2:04:38] baseball respect i had one particular
[2:04:41] boy that i coached but i taught him to
[2:04:43] win whatever you do
[2:04:45] you play to win you play hard but always
[2:04:47] keep the right attitude even if you lose
[2:04:49] you keep a winner's attitude
[2:04:50] i had a boy his name was quasi
[2:04:54] smart mouth
[2:04:56] threw his helmet throw his back
[2:04:58] i pulled him aside one day and i've
[2:04:59] always prayed with the kids and i told
[2:05:01] cousins to godzi on my team you might
[2:05:03] get away with that at home you might get
[2:05:05] away with that at school but you ain't
[2:05:06] gonna get away with it out here i build
[2:05:08] a relationship with the boy
[2:05:10] i
[2:05:11] said you're gonna say yes sir and you're
[2:05:12] gonna say no sir when umpire calls
[2:05:14] strike three you ever throw that helmet
[2:05:16] you'll never be in another game you'll
[2:05:17] set the i taught him a lot of
[2:05:19] things i said now what happened is when
[2:05:20] you get older the way you handle
[2:05:22] authority here is the way you're going
[2:05:23] to handle authority out there i tell my
[2:05:25] kids police officers to respect the
[2:05:27] police officer whatever you do i don't
[2:05:29] care if you think he's in a wrong you
[2:05:31] still respect him my boys will tell you
[2:05:32] that in a restaurant i go in if there's
[2:05:34] a police officer in there we pay for
[2:05:35] their meal don't we i make sure tell
[2:05:37] that waitress we'll get that police
[2:05:38] officer i've done that my whole life
[2:05:40] with my boys in taunton respect
[2:05:41] authority the reason i did that because
[2:05:43] i knew if they couldn't respect
[2:05:44] authority they
[2:05:45] could see they'll never respect
[2:05:47] authority they can't see
[2:05:52] like cop who's your police i pulled you
[2:05:54] over you know why i pulled you over most
[2:05:55] people lie
[2:05:57] no i know exactly why i pull you over

[2:06:01] they're mad at a cop or pulling them
[2:06:02] over speeding every people say speed and
[2:06:04] trap that's a speeding trap what's a
[2:06:06] speeding track for if you ain't speeding

[2:06:11] tree and hiding camouflage if you ain't
[2:06:14] disobeying the law don't worry about him
[2:06:18] i go down interested all the time see
[2:06:19] him tucked back in the tree go by
[2:06:22] way back and keep on going because i
[2:06:23] ain't got no problem as long as i'm not
[2:06:25] breaking the law i'm not under the law
[2:06:31] any peace opera say amen
[2:06:33] thank you joe
[2:06:36] it's true i've never had a police
[2:06:38] officer ever ever ever ever pull me over

[2:06:44] know why i pulled you over

[2:06:51] i've never had a cop do i've never had a
[2:06:53] police officer pull me over get me
[2:06:54] inside the room and say do you know how
[2:06:55] i put your no i only pulled you over not
[2:06:57] because you're doing anything wrong i
[2:06:59] wanted to tell you how of a great driver
[2:07:01] you are
[2:07:06] no law is not there to congratulate you
[2:07:08] laws there to get the law breaker and
[2:07:11] that this generation it's like you get
[2:07:12] mad because the law gets the law that's
[2:07:15] what they're there for
[2:07:17] i had one bull meal when i left homer's
[2:07:19] church a couple weeks ago by the homers
[2:07:21] and i really was going through a little
[2:07:22] country town and really wasn't paying
[2:07:24] attention got through preaching i was
[2:07:25] about seven miles over and he pulled me
[2:07:27] over and he got out of his car and i had
[2:07:30] my registration and my entrance card
[2:07:32] license i knew i was speeding
[2:07:35] he got me
[2:07:36] so i had the had him handed out like
[2:07:38] that he looked in my back seat and he's
[2:07:40] seen them suits and
[2:07:42] my briefcase my bible up in my front
[2:07:43] seat he looked up and said where are you
[2:07:45] coming from i said church
[2:07:47] and i still was holding he never taken
[2:07:49] out my hand
[2:07:50] he said he's speeding a little bit and i
[2:07:51] said yes sir i didn't even realize it
[2:07:54] didn't have an attitude toward authority
[2:07:57] he's doing his job
[2:07:59] he had every right to give me a ticket
[2:08:01] you know what he did
[2:08:03] would you slow down preacher i said yes
[2:08:05] sir
[2:08:06] i said have a good day and then i found
[2:08:09] out grace does exist during law
[2:08:12] program said is this before law during
[2:08:13] long after law
[2:08:15] you know makes a difference your
[2:08:17] attitude
[2:08:19] what's your attitude running this race
[2:08:20] let me give you a couple more and i'm
[2:08:21] done but anyways this boy named cozzy he
[2:08:24] was a smart aleck
[2:08:26] and i worked with him he kept working
[2:08:27] until i till at home his daddy started
[2:08:29] seeing cause he changed remember what i
[2:08:31] told you preach the gospel no matter
[2:08:33] what you do and if necessary use words
[2:08:37] when you run this race don't try to step
[2:08:39] by don't try to get around the route run
[2:08:41] it and run it right
[2:08:44] so i dealt with this boy you know we
[2:08:46] went to the world series and this man
[2:08:47] walks up to me he said hey you know who
[2:08:49] i am i said
[2:08:51] not really he said i'm cause he's daddy
[2:08:54] i said nice to meet you
[2:08:55] he said somebody told me you was a
[2:08:57] preacher

[2:10:48] down there
[2:10:50] man gave me the money i built our church
[2:10:53] and i thought god there's no way you
[2:10:55] could bring me in contact with a man
[2:10:56] like this and there'll not be something
[2:10:58] in this i kept trying my best way how
[2:11:00] can i tell this man
[2:11:02] not just about helping but how could i
[2:11:04] tell him about christ
[2:11:06] so i went out to eat with him i ordered
[2:11:08] at that time i drank diet coke and drank
[2:11:10] diet coke and he had a budweiser over
[2:11:12] there he was drinking i was drinking a
[2:11:14] coke and he was drinking the budweiser
[2:11:15] now when i come out of pentecost

[2:11:18] sinful
[2:11:20] since i got the holy ghost i can drink
[2:11:21] coffee and and you know diet coke
[2:11:24] but
[2:11:25] he was a sinner he was doing what he's
[2:11:26] doing i don't know what i was doing i
[2:11:27] kept trying i couldn't get to him
[2:11:30] finally one day i went down to the bank
[2:11:32] and i walked in the office they got the
[2:11:34] place where the guy would hug me like we
[2:11:36] were brothers
[2:11:37] that's the way he treated me
[2:11:39] and i said rick i want to ask you a
[2:11:41] question
[2:11:42] i said why would you give the money for
[2:11:45] my church to build a church and why
[2:11:47] would you do all this stuff for me
[2:11:50] he stopped he turned me around he said
[2:11:52] luke
[2:11:53] any man
[2:11:55] that would treat my son the way you did
[2:11:58] and any man would treat him like he's a
[2:11:59] lone boy i'd do anything for you and
[2:12:02] when he said it something dropped down
[2:12:03] in my heart
[2:12:05] it's like the holy spirit turned the
[2:12:06] light on i said rick
[2:12:08] that's what i've been trying to tell you
[2:12:11] he said what are you talking about i
[2:12:13] said you see how you want to treat me
[2:12:15] for the way i treated your son he said
[2:12:16] yeah i said that's exactly how god feels

[2:12:21] is what he wants to do for you if you'll
[2:12:23] accept his son god will bless you if you
