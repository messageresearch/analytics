to be in the house of the lord you can be seated for just a minute i'd like to take a few minutes if i could just to maybe speak and give you a little testimony and just kind of maybe settle myself so it's been a been a while since i've been in the in the pulpit so i ask that you bear with me and uh pray for us and scotch for us like brother butler said so just wanted to say thank you to brother byler for his friendship first and foremost and for having the confidence uh to ask me to minister in the church it's it's a big responsibility i've never taken it lightly and you know i just really cherish the opportunity to be able to do that um you know talk about testimony god's certainly been good to us i've been good to my family and good to the church you know you look out you see the people of the church and you see how god's moved on the people and and how god moves in our services and and just seems like we're getting to a higher place and that's where we've got to get to um it's been about 11 years i think since i delivered a message to the church and so my my lovely wife reminded me of that so you know no pressure no nerves you know so it's been a while but uh some maybe be wondering why you know after 11 years would i decide to go back into the ministry well you know i think about it and you think why would you do that well brothers and sisters it's a late hour it's a really late hour and we're witnessing the world crumbling around us and as we sit back and we watch and you know you can't help but see what's going on in the news and things that's going on and the world is just falling apart a good friend of mine called me the other day he's a baptist pastor in hopkinsville and he was talking and we were talking about the world events and things going on and as we were talking we got down and he said you know remember me and mom in prayer his mom was going through pancreatic cancer and any of you know anything about it and had any identification with that it's it's not a good it's not a good diagnosis to have and just a sweet lady mary crawford's her name if you just uh lift her up in your prayers but uh he asked me he said just pray for us and so you know i sit in there and it just so happened you know sometimes people ask you to pray for them and and you not you know you're not in the in a place where you can just sit down and really dedicate the time and put forth the effort to to pray at that very moment but it just so happened that that i was kind of out just exploring the woods when i was talking to him on the phone and i sat down beside a on a little falling over tree over over a little branch there and i just sat down and i began to pray and thinking about the things that we had talked about and as i prayed i sat there and i said lord i don't even know how to pray how do you pray for our country how do you pray for our world how do you how do you pray for that when you see the things falling apart and crumbling how do you pray and i sat there for a minute and the more i thought about it and thought about our government and and how things you know the patriotic side and you man you want to see the country strike you know thrive you want to see uh you want to see things go good because we're raised americans we're patriotic but on the flip side we know what the prophet said and so i sat there and it just like the spirit just spoke to me and said come lord come that's all you can pray come lord come because the times are not it's not going to get any easier and if you believe that i'm afraid you've got false hope because we know what the prophets told us uh brother branham said in the 50s he said they thought they could fix the world with a democracy he said that didn't work he said they thought they could fix it with a dictator he said that didn't work so the only thing we've got to get us out of here is jesus christ so you know sometimes i think about the last 11 years and i think man what a waste of time what what what time i've wasted and you know that's probably a lot of truth in that but i can't turn back time i can only i can only pick up from today and go forward and i'll be honest with you because i think that's the best way to to handle situations is to just be honest and get it out get things out in the open we went through things my family that that that hurt i mean that's all you can say we had hurt feelings we had anger issues i mean it was uh you know there's things you have to overcome and anybody knows that you cannot minister to the people you cannot bring education to christ if uh if you got those things in your in your life so by god's grace everything is fine um you know we've overcome all of that uh we had to get softened back down we had to do some exploring for ourselves or our family we had to just kind of get away for a while and and get to a place to where we could regroup ourselves uh because we were kind of in a we felt like just kind of in limbo of where we were at and what we were doing so but god has god has been good to us he's made a way um and you know after we softened back up i guess in the last couple years we entered in or i entered into i guess that deal making stage i'm sure some of you have been there with god before god if you'll do this i'll do that uh if you'll if you'll provide this i'll go here i'll do this we've probably all been guilty of that and it's kind of a funny thing how our minds our human minds think that we can make a deal with god and somebody who's never lost before so we you know he's always going to come out on the wind inside no matter where we're at so um long story short i'm going to get uh get through the testimony part and get into the word here in just a minute um but god has provided in such a way i said god i'm in a you know i'm in a job that i cannot feel like i cannot minister and be effective and put in the time and effort with the job that i'm in i had a good job i was director of nursing for seven years my wife and hannah and brother troy know what go into that and it's such high level stress that it really uh you just you just can't imagine this the stress level my wife tried it for a little while and it didn't work too well for her so by god's grace she's got a new job today too but so i said god you know you're gonna have to provide me a job to where i can have the time and the ability to put in the effort and the study like i need to have so i began to look in i actually went through a little campaign phase there where i was running for an office for a public position we didn't win that i was kind of discouraging it there but i thought you know that's not what god wanted me to be that's not that's not the job i needed to be doing what god needs me to do so we didn't cry over spilled milk we just moved on with life and i was sitting there one day at work out in the parking lot trying to think you know just kind of praying and the lord kind of spoke to me and he said just call so and so so it's actually the the boss that i have now i called him i said gary are you by any chance are you looking for anybody a nurse a registered nurse to do some consultant work for you and i said you know most pharmacies have that and then when they deal with long-term care they have a consultant go in and he said i've been needing to do that for about 10 years and he said let me think about it and i'll get back with you well time went on week two weeks i think about three weeks and finally the phone rang one day and i didn't even recognize the number and uh i answered the phone and it was gary and he said brad i said yes sir and he said he said i want to offer you a job and so i thought man how does god how does god know how to do that god moves in such a way that he can make a way when there seems no way to be made it was actually a dream job you know i couldn't ask for a better job nursing i couldn't ask for a better boss his family his family owned pharmacy they're a christian family you go into the pharmacy they have christian music playing not rock and roll or you know but they have christian music playing inside the pharmacy and so i you know you just can't hardly get much better than that it's been such a blessing for us and we're thankful for that and so then i thought well i'm going to try them again because you know sometimes we want to make a lot of deals and i said well god i've got this house and we need to we need to downsize and it's just more than we need to take on it's more than more than i want to manage um you know when you're young and ambitious sometimes you think bigger is better and so here we were in our early 40s with a 3 600 square foot house no need of half of that so i said god if you if you'll help us get rid of this house i'll consider getting back in the ministry you know it's just the way you do it's just the way you work and and i thought well this this will be the end of it here because nobody in todd county is going to come by this house 3 600 square foot there's just not that big of a market well within i think it was within three months we we pretty much had closed on it and a family from pennsylvania had come down and bought it so you know that's just the way god works god will make a way and we're thankful for that god's been very good to us and you know i need your help this morning so you know the preacher can only preach if he can get himself out of the way and part of getting yourself out of the way is getting over your nerves and uh i'm nervous i mean you can tell i'm sure but we'll we'll move forward and see but i just need you to pull pull on the gift i don't know how long we'll go this morning i know the very first message i preached brother byler talked about it the other day the heart of a thoroughbred we were in the little church and i preached on that and about the life of seabiscuit and i can remember i'm in my early 20s i guess and and i remember working up that message and getting my notes together and i was thinking in my in my room there and i thought man i hope i don't hold them people over two hours they'll kill me i think about 20 minutes later we were we were done we were out so you know sometimes you uh you think and you and you try and you push and you go forward but uh it all works out man i found out though one thing about preaching it's not about the qual the quantity it's not how long you go it's about the quality it's about what's said when you're there so um if we go for 30 minutes that'll be fine if we go an hour that'll be fine 20 minutes that's what we'll do so let's stand if you would let's go before the lord in prayer this morning let's bow our heads heavenly father we're certainly thankful lord be in your house and for the opportunity to come and speak to your people this morning lord and lord you know i've had the opportunity to to speak in front of people in the past lord and i've been able to sit down and talk to different politicians and governors and and so forth and lord there's nothing ever like stepping before the bride of jesus christ it's such an honor and a privilege responsibility lord lord we just asked or that you would just help us this morning to get ourselves out of the way we just asked or that you would move in a cert in a special way that you would meet the needs of the people to be an encouragement to the people lord and we just want to tell you we love you and we appreciate you and we thank you for the lord for all that you do for us draw us close to you through this service in christ's name amen turn in your bibles if you would to genesis chapter 37 i tell you the devil's really been trying to get at people i think here recently with this not only covid but allergies and i know he's been hounding me over the last few days with cough and allergies and and it's drainage so we'll all bind together today and and rebuke that devil in the name of the lord jesus um genesis chapter 37 and jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of canaan and these are the generations of jacob joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock of with his brethren and the lad was with the sons of bilhah and the sons of zilpha and his father his father's wives and joseph brought unto his father their evil report so we look at joseph here just as we kind of go down through here and we see that joseph he was doing exactly what he was supposed to do he was supposed to be the one to come back and report to his father because we know that joseph was the one most loved by his father he had trust his father had trust in him so he would come back and tell and that didn't work out real good for joseph with him and his brothers okay now israel loved joseph more than all his children because because he was the son of his old age and he made him a code of many colors and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him they could not speak peace peaceably unto him and joseph dreamed a dream and he told his brethren and they hated him yet the more so here's twice right here immediately in the scriptures that he's been hated by his brothers the more he tries to do to please god the more he tries to do to please his father he's hated even the more and he said unto them here i pray you this dream which i have dreamed for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf so what is that word obeisance so we look at that and we found out that the word obeisance i looked that up and it means to make a body of in token of res of respect or submission so he's mad they've his these sheaves have now laid themselves down into submission now how do you think that made the the mother brothers feel when he told them that he's the 11th born out of 12 and benjamin's just a child and here his other brothers are sitting there and and he's saying you're going to bow down to me and his brethren said unto him shall we indeed reign over us or shall thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and his words and he dreamed yet another dream and he told his brother and said behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou has dreamed shall i my thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth and his brethren envied him but his father observed the same you may have your seats but the lord add his blessings to the reading of the word another little scripture that i just want to quote real quick is uh hebrews chapter 13 and eight very familiar scripture to us jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever those three little words yesterday today and forever the prophet used those words 3036 times in his messages over the time so those three words yesterday today and forever must have some significant importance into the life of the believer to build the faith to get us to where we need to be so yesterday today and forever and i want to take just for a little thought this morning on the word yesterday yesterday now we all know what the word yesterday refers to it refers to the day before today and if you think about what yesterday is yesterday defines who you are who i am today so yesterday begins to mold our character yesterday builds our faith up to a place that we can get closer to god or yesterday takes us into a place that we become further away from god yesterday can either strengthen us and draw us closer to god make us strong in the word or yesterday could take us to a place that we become weak and undedicated in god yesterday could possibly be the most important day of your life we don't think about that but how we handle yesterday makes us who we are i mean look around brothers and sisters everybody in here lived yesterday right if we're breathing today we lived yesterday so what does yesterday do for you how did it define you think about your yesterday what happened yesterday did you go through struggles yesterday did you find yourself in a place that you relied upon you had to rely upon god maybe god felt like you felt like god wasn't there did you find yourself in a place that you were just getting up there on top of the world and you felt like you were as close as you could be yesterday what happened yesterday because it makes us who we are today that's why brothers and sisters we need to have god first and foremost in our life and everything we do many times we look at the word yesterday and we can grow in yesterday we've all been there in a place in our life i'm sure when everything is good life is good the preacher preached a great service my goodness all the bills are paid the refrigerator is full the kids all get along everything's going just fine god's moving in our life and nothing can ever go wrong been there we've been there or have you ever found yourself defeated in yesterday when it's when where before nothing could go wrong but now nothing goes right now nothing goes right and you find yourself uh the preacher he didn't even know you were there at church your spirit's deflated the frigerator broke down you don't have enough money at the end of the month and now you're sitting here and you're saying oh my goodness life is horrible god where are you at how many has been there so did god forsake you at that time did god leave you and walk away and say you're on your own now buddy no he was there all the time but sometimes we fail to put god in a place of today we fail to put god in a current situation where we have to rely upon god we leave him out in the past listen to what the prophet said 58 lifting him up out of history we are the people today of his pasture we are the sheep of his fold and he's waiting on us to stand and call him into action call him upon the scene watch him go into movements watch him do the supreme watch him do the thing that man will wonder and scratch their heads and not understand it the world can't understand the way god moves the world don't understand how god could come into a god of history a god of joseph a god of mary a god of all these different characters in the bible how he can come back into a present day in your life today and move on the scene the world does not understand that listen what he said he's a historical god and a present day god he's waiting to be called out of history he's waiting on us to call him out of history when you're going through those laws in life when things are not going good god is sitting there and he's just waiting that's why we have to realize who we are let's look at joseph the life of joseph a little bit and let's just see how god moved out throughout his life so joseph we looked at he's a born the 11th child of 12 loved the most by his father so much that his father makes him a special coat a coat of privilege a coat of many colors to recognize him as you're my favorite boy that had to be tough i was an only child man i'm telling you if you was the child of 11 and and you're publicly made hey this is my bright and shining star right here and i see you over there so joseph is now carrying this burden that he's the greatest of his brothers maybe he could have got into his head just a little bit and he begins to take responsibility because he was a responsible person his father knew that his father knew he was responsible so one day he sends joseph out into the field to go find his brothers and make sure that they're tending to the flocks fine so they're sitting out there and as joseph's beginning to walk through the field his brothers see him coming and immediately that hatred begins to bowl that hatred that we've seen before where he said i dreamed a dream and i seen you guys fall down at my feet and i've seen you submit to me that they remember that and that hatred begins to bull and bull and ball up in them and they look at him and they say you know what we're going to do we'll kill him if we take him off the scene there will be no dream to come to pass we'll just move him completely out of the scene and then we'll be on our own we don't have to worry about that little brother of ours no more just get him out of the way but thankfully reuben stepped up and said no we can't kill him he is our own blood we can't kill him so they put put together another plan and they say well just throw him in this pit we'll just leave him in there for now can you imagine a 17 year old boy going out there to be with your family and they throw you into a pit and there's joseph out there crying and crying help me brothers let me out of this pit why are you keeping me in here brothers let me out of here please brothers 17 years old i've got a 16 year old there's other young people here i wouldn't want to see my child at 17 crying in a pit not knowing if he's going to live or die but that's exactly what they did to him put him in this pit until this group of slave traders come by so here you have these flights come by they're slave traders and reuben says we'll just sell him just sell him get him out of our lives and get him out of our way we'll go back we'll tell father that he was killed and so that's what they did they took it he took his his precious coat everything has symbolism so his his token of of of superiority they take it and they dip it in goat's blood and take it back to jacob and say now look sorry dad we found this on the road joseph was killed joseph was killed but that was yesterday that was yesterday so now he's in this slave trade and he's going there these ishmaelites they come and they go before the egyptians and there's potiphar and potiphar who is a chief chief of the uh of the masters to the to the pharaoh and he's chief counsel to him and potiphar looks at him and he sees joseph and he's like man there's something different about this guy there's something different than him than all the rest of the slaves i don't know what it is i can't put my finger on it but i want him so potiphar begins to look at him and then potiphar takes him back down to his house in slavery now but when you look at the bible what does it say and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man wow so yesterday he's in a pit and he's struggling for his very life and he's been sold into slavery but now here he is the lord is with him in slavery he's a prosperous man and it says that that the master even saw that the lord was with him now you tell me that's not a shining but there's not an aura around somebody when a master of egypt can look at an israelite and say god is with him the lord is with him and he said the lord saw that the master saw the lord was with him and the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand wow me just read the rest of this to you and joseph found grace in his sight he served him he made him overseer of his house and all that he had put into his hand and it came to pass from from the time that he had made him overseer in the house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the egyptians house for joseph's satan wow you think god can't take a bad situation and turn it around to make you supreme god can take any kind of bad that you're going through and step right in slide right in there and turn the ti the tides to where the enemy serving you he had so much confidence in joseph a slave that he made him ruler of his house so you understand when potiphar left he didn't call one of the other egyptians to come over and oversee his house he said joseph come over here and oversee my house while i'm gone brothers and sisters joseph didn't allow the struggles of yesterday he didn't allow the struggles of his new life of slavery to hinder him from going forward with god now can you imagine in the back of his mind he still has to be thinking why did they get rid of me what did i do because he just thought he was doing what he was supposed to do he was following the father's orders and he was dreaming what god made him dream what did he do he wasn't malicious in anything he'd done so in the back of his mind he still has to be thinking i wonder if benjamin's okay i wonder how my father's doing i wonder if he's still living working for potiphar giving everything he's got to egypt working for potiphar how easy it would have been for joseph to turn from god where would you i mean don't answer out loud but where would you be what would you be thinking god where are you i've done everything up to this time i've followed all the commandments you've ever given me where are you now he could have easily said that joseph could have easily took that that route he could have become so wretched towards god but he didn't life was good his master blessed him his master was pleased with him his master gave him everything that he needed he made him overseer of the house he was the man in charge life's good but that was yesterday you see every day we live builds our character every day the things we go through makes us who we are it makes us stronger it gives us our christian character so here now you see life gives us these ups and downs just like it did for joseph and so things were going well and who steps in potiphar's wife she sees how goodly that joseph is because he's a goodly man and she calls on him joseph come away with me hold up joseph said no ma'am i won't have any part of that so what does she do but she grabs his garments pulls him out pulls the garments off of his back and makes it look like that he tried to ravish her and then she begins to put him into a place and she's crying out to all the people of egypt look what this man has done did you bring him here to make a mockery of us wow what option did potiphar have he had no option but to put joseph in the in the prison into bondage so here the man that was in charge is now the man in chains and there's something how things change from one day to the other chapter 39 this is a good three or four chapters there that you go through but we're not gonna hit them all but chapter 39 we see joseph in prison what we just talked about in verse 21 what does it say does anybody got it the lord was with joseph wow man we think we've got it hard sometimes we think we've got it really really bad sometimes i don't i i don't know anybody that's ever been thrown in a pit to die if you have see me after service if you've been left to slavery if you've been put in bondage if you've been falsely accused in such a way that joseph was but the lord was with him the lord was with joseph and showed him mercy let me just show you how much god cares about where we're at in our life joseph is now in the prison he's now in chains he's now in bondage and he's sitting there and what does the next verse say god gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison brothers and sisters that ought to be our prayer every day god give me favor in those i come in contact with we need to be in favor of those we come in contact with that way we have an advantage now joseph because of who he was because god was with him god gave him favor to the keeper of the prison now he's in a different place god can make your worst enemy have favor on you the keeper of the prison left joseph in charge isn't that something you got a prisoner watching prisoners that don't go too well in todd county jail i don't know about the egyptian jail but he had some kind of confidence in joseph let's jump off of joseph for just a minute let's look at shamgar for a minute so there was shamgar he's there setting sitting there in his day the philistines they had come in there were no judges in israel so philistines had run of the land they could go anywhere they wanted to do anything they wanted to do to anybody nobody was going to stop them so here's shamgar and shamgar standing there and last year yesterday they took everything that he had to feed his family to feed his wife to feed his kids to feed his livestock now can you imagine you work all year long to put put aside and you have to store this grain for the next year's crop and you've got all this in place and here comes these these philistines come in and take everything that you've got said he was standing there and he's looking at his wife her shirt sleeves was torn she didn't have clothes fitting to where the kids didn't have no shoes the kids were barefooted and he said he can see him standing there and says well wife dear i suppose maybe this winter we won't starve wow what relief when shamgar he's sitting there and he says wow god has blessed us we come through the worst worst event we've ever been through in our life when the philistines took everything we had last year and now we've got grain we've got enough wheat we've got enough we can feed the kids we can make some porridge for breakfast i guess we're going to be all right he says this maybe i can even sell a little and get you some clothes now what an honor it must have been for shamgar you know how humiliated he must have felt from the prior year knowing that the philistines had come and robbed him of everything he had in his life then he only robbed from him they stole from his wife his kids he took their clothes took their their their food all this was surrounded they're green they had to have the green maybe i could sell a little bit and get you some clothes then he heard something thump thump thump thumb thump thump the familiar sound of marching soldiers can you imagine the the the feeling his heart must have had and the as he must have fell down to his lowest point back and remembered everything that happened the year before he said he looked out the window and raised the barn door and saw 600 men prophet said they were big fat fellas walking up there so you know sham garden had no grain so he wasn't no big fat fella so here was this man who had had lost everything and you got these big fat soldiers walking up with armor and shields and he looks over and they're there to take his his food and to rob him once again and he looked over at his little wife brother branham said and shamgar said he could see the tears running down his face he knew what was coming brother sister sometimes in life we see things coming before they ever get there and it's almost like watching a train wreck you don't want to see it but you can't take your eyes off of it it's coming our way you can hear the train coming shamgar was here in a place he could hear the train coming destruction was in his path and he looked out there and he said i'm just a farmer i can't fight them i'm outnumbered they're 600 to my one what could i do brothers and sisters that was yesterday that was yesterday because today he rose up and he said i am an israelite i am an israelite i have been circumcised i have the covenant of the lord and today i am not a farmer but a warrior so shamgar goes out there with an ox goat a stick with a brass horn on it and he begins to beat and beat and beat can you imagine as the holy spirit must have swept through that land as body was falling left and right left and right one after another how much did it looked when he got done what did he do he brought god on the scene he didn't just settle for a god of history but he brought god on the scene he wasn't bound to the fear of yesterday he wasn't bound to the fear of losing everything he had he wasn't bound to the fear of watching his children starved to death or his wife starved to death with no clothes he wasn't bound to that he brought a present-day god on the scene two thousand years ago jewish jewish law stated that the consequence of adultery was to literally be dragged out into the outskirts of the city and be stoned to death they didn't play so on this particular day the jewish authorities are walking through the streets they get word of a young lady who's found herself in a place that she didn't belong they get her they catch her in the very act of adultery there's no doubt about it she's guilty no doubt about it what could she say caught in the very act news begins to spread you know how small towns are town knows more about you than you know about yourself so here the news begins to spread in this little town and they begin to come and the crowd gets bigger and bigger and bigger and you got more stone throwers and more stone throwers and they grow in number you know everybody wants to do their part when it comes to keeping law you see that a lot of times in church everybody wants to do their part when they know the law same thing happened here in this city we've got stones we called her and we want to know what you got to say jesus so here now is jesus in the streets and they approach him and they're going to try to find him and catch him off guard so they go up to jesus and they begin to look at him and they say rabbi which means master this woman has been caught in the very act of adultery the law says we will stone her to death what do you say listen listen that's what we heard silence the hush of an atmosphere so quiet that you could have heard a pin drop they were looking and wanting some big great words of wisdom from jesus and he simply sits there silent while all these stone throwers are sitting there just palms sweating ready to throw just ready just grimacing on their face let's kill her and jesus simply bends down kneels down on the ground and begins to write and he says you without sin cast the first stone i don't know what he wrote i'd like to know i've often thought maybe he just wrote pardoned pardon for that young lady you without sin cast the first stone if you've done nothing wrong before cast the stone and one by one the stones begin to drop can you imagine the horror that this young lady was feeling in her mind and the tears rolling down her face and then when she begins to look there and she looks up at jesus she looks around and she sees no accusers whatsoever nobody's left jesus says where are they and her sobbing through her tears and tears falling on the ground and her crying and sobbing where are they there are none there are none then i won't accuse you either he said go and sin no more [Music] [Applause] yesterday that woman was living a life of adultery she was living a life of prostitution she was living a life that the whole city the entire country there looked down upon her and was cast aside by her entire community but today because of god's grace today because of jesus christ was on the scene and he was in her midst he changed her life god changed her life she found value now she has value in life now she's accepted by the community now she's saved brothers and sisters can you imagine the feeling she must have had knowing that now i'm free my sins are gone all preachers look at their clutches you know jesus was walking with his disciples on a mission jesus is walking along knowing the road that is ahead of him his disciples fall sleepy you know where i'm going his disciples fall sleepy they fall asleep and he's sitting there and he says i've got to go a little bit farther so he goes right into this garden and he kneels down beside this rock and begins to pray now right there brothers and sisters when jesus knelt down and began to pray that was no longer god that was a man brother branham said it couldn't have been god because god can't die and there had to be a decision made as he began to sit down here and kneel down to pray and brother branham illustrates it so well he said i can see gabriel come down and his great sword by his side and he's sitting beside jesus he said i can see wormwood over here and all the other great angels lighting down upon the rocks and he said then that great holy spirit elohim the self-existing one he came down into his presence you know what's next he said he asked him son do you want to go through with it that's a man put yourself there he knew what was fixing to happen he knew what laid ahead in his future he knew what tomorrow holds and he said do you want to go through with it brother branham said the angels were listening he said what's your answer the whole world lays on your shoulders do you want to pay the price or do you want to or do you want to you can come right on now without death he had an option he could have went right on into the heavenlies never suffered one bit there lays calvary before you they'll spit in your face they'll take you to calvary you're going to die in agony with a crown of thorns on your head and your blood will drain out are you willing wow are you willing angels standing there wondering what's fixing to take place and what did jesus say as a man knowing the future of tomorrow not my will but thine be done brother branham said right there the angels knew so much what was fixing to take place said that the angels right then unfolded their blessings to begin to minister to him because they knew what laid ahead as a man he made that decision right there in that very garden he made the decision and he agreed to take the sins of the entire world upon his shoulders he agreed right there to take your fears he agreed to take your doubts he agreed to take your your your lust your hatred your anger your injury your strife your bitterness he took all of those mean qualities all those hateful things that we carry in our life and he took it upon his shoulders to a place called calvary they beat him they mocked him they spit on him they put a crown of thorn up on his head just like the prophet said they hung him up on a cross to die and he took his last breath but that was yesterday thank god for today because today jesus is no longer in the grave he's not in some tomb jesus is alive he's alive and well god god there was nothing they could do the grave couldn't hold him the devil couldn't stop him they couldn't do nothing with him he went down into the pits of hell and took the keys from the devil and said now they're mine release these people listen to what the prophet says he's the same yesterday today and forever just call on a historical god watch him become a present god raised up out of history to shine just as he did back then he'll act the same he'll do the same he'll forgive the same he'll heal the same his compassions are the same his willingness is the same his power is the same he's the same last three words he's waiting on us four words he's waiting on us he's everything he ever was when the world is crumbling around us just like we spoke about earlier when the world is crumbling and falling to shreds and pieces before our very eyes this word didn't change his saving power didn't change he still saves he still heals he still delivers anything you have need of this morning he's there for you i'm gonna close with this one little statement here with all the ups and downs as i've studied out on joseph there's so much more you could go into on joseph and and we know what happened with joseph he had the the the the butler and the baker and they go down into prison with him and and so they have dreams down there and one uh joseph interprets the dreams right and so i'm just going to hit him real quick so he interprets the dreams and one of them is set free and one of them's head was taken but you know joseph told that one guy let's say was it the was it the butler the one who lived i can't remember but anyway he told him he said remember me joseph said remember me when you go before the before the throne of egypt remember what i did for you remember how i interpreted these dreams that lasted about that long if you look in the bible it says almost two years went by before he remembered him you just saved somebody's life and they don't think about you for two years two years passed then we know the rest of the story pharaoh ends up having dreams and they call up joseph and joseph comes up interprets the dreams the the fatted cows uh eat up the skinny or the skinny cows eat up the fatted and and so we know all of egypt saved on the account of joseph's interpretation of the dream so now we find joseph lifted up into a place of authority he was the very second to the very king of egypt we're talking about a israel bull he's now second in place to the very king of egypt and here's what always stood out to me as so astounding as he now sits in his position all of israel is saved now because they had food his father come they recognized and the pharaoh looks at him and he changes his name to zephaniah panah changes his name anybody know what that means i'm going to tell you because it's good god speaks and he lives can you imagine all of egypt now had to look at joseph zephaniah panaya who is now known as god who speaks and is alive so all that god all that joseph went through in his entire life we signed the lord was with him the lord was with him the lord looked over and the lord gave favor to him and now god put him in a place that they looked at him because god was living through him brothers and sisters don't let yesterday define you in a bad way don't let your yesterday caused you to backslide on god every day chicken little said the best thing every day is a new day today is a new day what will you do with today because what you do with today well tell us what you'll be tomorrow let's stand musicians if you come i want to be the kind of christian that brings god onto the scene i hadn't always been that but many times i've said things i wish i hadn't said why because i didn't bring god on the scene been times i've done things i wished i hadn't done why because i didn't bring god on the scene he's waiting for us he's waiting for you he's waiting for me he's waiting for us to make the right decision to call him on the scene to live his life through us i want to be like a joseph god speaks and is alive let's bow our heads heavenly father we thank you lord for this day we thank you for all you've done for us lord we thank you for this little message that you laid on my heart lord and i just trust lord that it was a blessing to the people lord if there's anybody sitting out there this morning that says i want my yesterday to be in the past i want it to be yesterday and i want to live for today but i want to take everything that that i have learned and build upon so that i can be the christian i need to be for tomorrow and you just want to raise your hands and ask the lord to help you to be the christian you need to be today god bless those hands thank you lord thank you lord you're so good to us lord [Music] to thank the lord jesus when he was in the garden as a man my name was on your mind everybody sitting here was on your mind we thank you for that lord [Music] thank you for a present day god thank you for loving
