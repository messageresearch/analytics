[43:11] let's just start if you will let's go to
[43:13] 2 Corinthians 2
[43:26] Corinthians 2 Corinthians
[43:30] 3 and we'll begin with verse one Do We
[43:33] Begin Again to commend ourselves or need
[43:37] we as some others Epistles of
[43:40] commendation to you or letters of
[43:42] commendation from you ye are our epistle
[43:46] written in our hearts known and read of
[43:48] all men for as much for as much as you
[43:51] are manifestly declared to be the
[43:53] Epistle of Christ ministered by us WR
[43:57] written not with ink but with the spirit
[44:00] of the Living God not in the tables of
[44:02] stone but in the fleshly tables of the
[44:05] heart amen may God add His blessings to
[44:07] the reading of the word tonight amen you
[44:09] can be
[44:11] seated
[44:13] amen amen I got to think about that
[44:16] quote brother brandom talked about and
[44:19] what he
[44:19] made when he made a comment about the
[44:23] bride being the final voice to the final
[44:25] age so I'm going to title this the final
[44:28] voice amen the final voice to the final
[44:32] age amen Paul talking of course here
[44:35] he's talking about you know they were
[44:37] talking about um needing a letter or
[44:40] some kind of uh Commendation about each
[44:43] other whatever and he did then Paul goes
[44:45] describing how that you know you're our
[44:48] epistle
[44:50] amen that's known and read of all men
[44:54] how many knows that's what we are amen
[44:57] we're like a book each and every one of
[45:00] us is like a book amen and let me just
[45:04] say I think the hardest person to read
[45:08] that book the person that it's hardest
[45:10] the hardest to read that book is
[45:14] yourself ain't that right at least
[45:17] that's how I found it in my life amen
[45:20] because it's so easy to read everybody
[45:24] else a that right oh this person's this
[45:26] way and this person's that way and so
[45:28] forth and so forth you know but when it
[45:30] comes to looking at yourself amen it
[45:33] takes something special amen it actually
[45:36] takes the Holy Ghost amen and if you're
[45:41] as honest with yourself as I am of to
[45:44] myself sometime when the Holy Ghost to
[45:46] really get the getting me to look in the
[45:48] mirror I get a little
[45:50] worried I get a little scared I'm like
[45:53] brother by you know you're this way now
[45:54] you might want to admit it but you are
[45:57] and you ought to
[45:59] be amen and I don't like it amen every
[46:03] one of us have Natures that pull you in
[46:06] a certain
[46:08] direction a that right and sometimes we
[46:11] don't recognize that
[46:12] direction and I found one thing that
[46:15] whenever I'm carnal whenever Thomas
[46:17] berer is carnal and I'm telling you you
[46:20] whenever you're
[46:22] carnal you don't only uh not only don't
[46:26] you really read yourself you go
[46:32] blind that's right most of the time when
[46:34] you get carnal you'll swear up and down
[46:36] no I'm not carnal no and and even a a
[46:41] spiritual uh type of blindness uh a
[46:45] self-justification
[46:47] spirit you'll promise that you've got
[46:50] the quote you I got the quote
[46:52] brother but yet in it all you'll be
[46:55] wrong
[46:57] you're wrong in your attitude you're
[46:59] wrong in the way you're doing it and
[47:02] even though there's a quote in that way
[47:03] it's not wasn't meant to be applied in
[47:05] that
[47:07] manner amen and down none of that was in
[47:10] the script so y'all it's all
[47:12] free but that's the truth isn't it amen
[47:15] and as brother Brandon Begin to say this
[47:17] let me just read this quote to kind of
[47:19] lay a foundation he says it this
[47:21] way and uh I got to think in the final
[47:24] voice to the final age but you know
[47:26] really I was thinking you know uh that
[47:29] that it is the final voice to the final
[47:31] age but it's a voice that's been around
[47:33] for a very long
[47:39] time so let me I'm going to I'm going to
[47:42] skip ahead and then go
[47:43] back we go to the end and then we'll
[47:45] pick the other up is that all
[47:49] right amen and now notice the people who
[47:53] took Wesley's Revelation from be you
[47:57] know that he got from God they became
[48:00] living Epistles read and known of all
[48:02] men for their generation and when the
[48:05] Methodist failed God raised up others
[48:08] and so that it had so it has gone on
[48:11] through the years until in the last day
[48:14] there is again another people in the
[48:16] land who under their Messenger will be
[48:19] the final voice to the final
[48:22] age amen so how many beli we're the
[48:25] final voice to the final age but brother
[48:28] B I'm talking about uh the the Church of
[48:32] God the people of God of course we know
[48:34] ever since the time amen when Christ
[48:36] ascended and whenever he sent his Spirit
[48:38] back on the day of Pentecost that the
[48:41] voice of God and the mouthpiece of God
[48:44] has been the Church of
[48:46] God it's been his
[48:48] people that's been their mouthpiece
[48:51] God's mouthpiece God's
[48:54] voice amen
[48:57] he says a momentary com com
[48:59] consideration of the church history will
[49:01] prove how accurate this thought is in
[49:04] the Dark Ages the word was almost
[49:05] entirely lost to the people but God sent
[49:07] Luther with the word and the Luther the
[49:10] Lutheran spoke for God at that time but
[49:15] they organized and again the pure word
[49:16] of God was lost for organization Trends
[49:20] towers dogmas and Creeds and so forth
[49:22] amen and when they could no longer speak
[49:24] speak for God then God sent Wesley on
[49:27] and on and on and on so God has always
[49:31] spoken amen and it is quite something
[49:34] how
[49:35] that the voice of God has always been
[49:39] through not the moon not Sun not trees
[49:42] not anything but always been through his
[49:45] people remember one place Jesus said
[49:47] when you're taken up in counsels and so
[49:49] forth and amen don't premeditate what
[49:51] you're going to say because it'll be
[49:54] given to you what to say in the moment
[49:56] that it is amen and I've experienced
[49:59] that many of times folks you'll come up
[50:02] into situations and you have no idea you
[50:04] know how it's going to go but if you'll
[50:06] just surrender God God will give you the
[50:07] wisdom he'll give you the words to speak
[50:10] amen how many knows whenever you say
[50:11] those word it absolutely dumbfounds
[50:14] anybody that's coming against
[50:17] you amen so this thought of not only
[50:21] being the final voice but how many knows
[50:23] that they're the temple of God not the
[50:25] not just the voice of God but amen their

[52:58] now I've got I want to tie some other
[53:00] thoughts in here with it it'll go along
[53:03] with this but I had a few more thoughts
[53:05] that I want to kind of try tie in with
[53:07] the help of the
[53:10] Lord amen and the next scripture is in
[53:15] Romans amen and this morning when I woke
[53:18] up I had all these thoughts flooding in
[53:21] so I just got one of these little things
[53:23] here and I got the back of it so once I
[53:25] write it down I don't want rewrite it
[53:27] but I hope we can make sense of it amen
[53:30] final voice Romans let's go to Romans
[53:34] 8 Romans
[53:39] 8 in verse 19 it says for the earnest
[53:43] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[53:46] the manifestation of the sons of God for
[53:49] the creature was made subject to vanity
[53:51] not willingly but by reason of him who
[53:53] has subjected the same in Hope down to
[53:56] verse 22 for we know that the whole
[53:58] creation granth and travaileth in pain
[54:01] together until now and not only they but
[54:03] we ourselves also which have the first
[54:05] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[54:07] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[54:09] adoption to wit the Redemption of our
[54:12] body how many knows brother Brandon
[54:13] preached a lot of message on adoption he
[54:15] had the adoption
[54:16] series many times brother Brandon would
[54:19] talk about how that he had under he was
[54:21] under expectation for the children of
[54:24] God to come to the place of adop
[54:27] Amen to where when they speak their word
[54:29] would be backed
[54:31] up
[54:33] amen let me tell you tell me my brother
[54:36] my sister he says when when there was
[54:38] ever a time that the sons of God was
[54:40] ever to be manifested outside of this
[54:42] time now when were there is ever time in
[54:46] history he says that this was to be
[54:48] manifest the time to deliver all nature
[54:51] even nature itself groaning waiting for
[54:54] the manifestation amen for the sons of
[54:57] God to manifest themselves listen he
[55:01] says and he goes to talking about the
[55:03] Old Testament all the way down through
[55:04] here he says but now all things has been
[55:07] brought coming shaping up into a
[55:09] headstone to the manifestation of the
[55:11] sons of God coming back and the spirit
[55:14] of God coming into these men so
[55:17] perfectly until their ministry will be
[55:19] so close like Christ till it'll join him
[55:23] and the church together
[55:28] now how many know we've had it we've got
[55:30] the word we've had a perfectly
[55:33] Vindicated a message brother brandom
[55:36] that was so much like
[55:39] Christ amen there was I don't believe
[55:42] there was ever a man closer that
[55:44] reflected Christ more than the prophet
[55:46] of
[55:48] God that came to the place that God
[55:51] could say you speak you say you speak
[55:55] you say it and what ever you say that's
[55:57] what it'll
[56:00] be see tonight we want to talk about
[56:02] that where we're going isin that right
[56:04] how many wants to progress in your
[56:05] Christian
[56:07] walk I mean we ain't staying in the same
[56:09] place as we were Sunday not the same
[56:13] place as last week or last year or last
[56:15] month no we're going somewhere we're
[56:17] coming closer and closer amen as Christ
[56:21] comes closer and the time of his
[56:22] appearing gets closer so we here are get
[56:26] closer also and if we've had a Ministry
[56:29] and a message amen that was so much like
[56:31] him amen I going to say this when are we
[56:33] going to eat the book so to speak and
[56:35] become the
[56:36] book and when are we going to see this
[56:38] manifested in a greater way because I
[56:40] don't know about you but I sure love to
[56:42] see a little bit more of
[56:45] it yes
[56:47] sir not that everybody's called to do
[56:50] great great great things but I'm here to
[56:52] tell you you should be able to hear the
[56:53] voice of God every day in your life for
[56:56] your
[56:58] situations
[57:00] amen I got to hurry but I'm not going to
[57:03] hurry so here we
[57:06] go amen all right shaping up oh my
[57:10] notice the coming of the Lord Jesus is
[57:12] so close at hand un till the spirit from
[57:15] way down in there from justification
[57:17] from sanctification baptism of the Holy
[57:20] Spirit and right now into that time of
[57:22] the coming of The Headstone the church
[57:24] has got to be so perfect perfectly like
[57:27] Christ until Christ and the church can
[57:29] unite
[57:31] together amen The Same Spirit and if the
[57:35] spirit of Christ is in you it makes you
[57:38] live the life of Christ amen act the
[57:41] Life of Christ do the works of Christ he
[57:44] that believeth on me the works that I do
[57:46] shall he do also we got a Ministry
[57:48] coming that's just exactly like the Life
[57:51] of Christ what does that Ministry
[57:53] identify the coming of the Lord I mean
[57:56] no Pentecostals were up there pretty
[57:58] close but he was still not all the way
[58:01] no they had the restoration of the gifts
[58:03] and so forth but now it was back to the
[58:05] fullness of the
[58:08] word fullness of the word in other words
[58:10] Jesus come down and did exactly what he
[58:13] used to do when he was here on the earth
[58:17] unquestionable that to me that never
[58:19] gets old what Jesus came and did that
[58:22] wasn't we're not talking about what
[58:23] brother brandom did we're talking about
[58:25] what Christ did through brother brandom
[58:29] amen because that was Christ through
[58:31] brother
[58:33] brandom
[58:34] amen oh
[58:39] my all right we'll just we'll just go on
[58:43] here
[58:46] okay
[58:50] now brother Braham says the coming of
[58:52] the Lord look at look at the world today
[58:55] and watch what Kush Chef's saying and
[58:58] all these other great things the great
[59:00] worldwide conflicts right at hand at any
[59:03] time could go to powder at any second
[59:06] notice and if that we know that it's
[59:08] that close any sensible person can read
[59:11] the newspapers or listen to the radio
[59:14] and know that it's
[59:16] close can you imagine him saying that
[59:18] back there how much more it fits
[59:21] today you can look at the radio you can
[59:24] hear it and you can know that it's close
[59:27] amen by listen just looking around amen
[59:31] remember Christ comes for his church
[59:32] before that happens so how close is the
[59:36] coming of the Lord maybe before this
[59:38] meeting ends amen we're at the end time
[59:42] praise be to
[59:43] God Amen now listen let me just let me
[59:47] let me I want to talk to you a little
[59:49] bit about when when uh when omnipotence
[59:52] meets omnipotence and so forth but let's
[59:54] go down here with this talk again and a
[59:56] little just be in place where where God
[59:58] can use us in such a way to speak his
[1:00:00] word amen cuz I've been out out on the
[1:00:04] farm I'll tell you what it's as we all
[1:00:05] know that we've been in a drought things
[1:00:07] have been drier out there than I've ever
[1:00:09] seen it I mean you talk about dry I've
[1:00:12] been having to feed cows Here Am me in
[1:00:15] middle of September and I usually don't
[1:00:17] like to do that till December or so you
[1:00:19] know and and I'm like boy oh boy this is
[1:00:21] really drying and I got to thinking
[1:00:23] about what the how that the prophet of
[1:00:25] God he uh
[1:00:26] he said you know a lot of times he said
[1:00:27] he'd lay hands on one another don't pray
[1:00:30] for yourself because the Bible said pray
[1:00:31] one for the other and it's it's the Life
[1:00:33] of Christ to pray for somebody else amen
[1:00:36] and I got to thinking about what brother
[1:00:37] bam said about how that the the
[1:00:40] Believers there's coming a time should
[1:00:42] come a time when we come to the place of
[1:00:44] adoption so that when we speak God backs
[1:00:46] it up ain't that right now listen
[1:00:49] everything everything's all of nature
[1:00:51] The Whole World's groaning everything's
[1:00:52] moving what for for the manifestation of
[1:00:54] the sons of God when true Sons born Sons
[1:00:58] filled Sons I like that born Sons filled
[1:01:03] Sons speak and their word is back I
[1:01:06] believe we're on the border of it now
[1:01:07] yes sir say to this mountain and it'll
[1:01:10] be so brother I desire so and so a
[1:01:14] certain thing done a believer in Christ

[1:01:18] Jesus Christ there's a manifestation oh

[1:01:28] there and said I fixing to call I'm
[1:01:30] fixing to call somebody hey I need y'all
[1:01:32] to pray for some rain out here will
[1:01:35] you CU what prophet of God said you know
[1:01:38] if a brother somebody needs some rain
[1:01:40] somebody say I give you rain in the name
[1:01:42] of the
[1:01:43] Lord amen I believe in another place and
[1:01:46] I was looking for it he says you know
[1:01:47] come a time when the sons of God they'll
[1:01:49] if you will not need a limb restored
[1:01:51] they'll restore Limbs and so forth goow
[1:01:53] it
[1:01:54] back amen
[1:01:57] even more I'll listen that's right oh my
[1:02:02] bless your crop oh waiting groaning all
[1:02:04] nature waiting for the manifestation of
[1:02:06] the sons of God God ordained it at the
[1:02:08] beginning he gave man a domain amen
[1:02:14] praise the
[1:02:21] Lord
[1:02:24] amen that's right remember what Jesus
[1:02:26] said verily I say unto you he that
[1:02:29] believeth on me the works that I sh
[1:02:31] shall you do also and greater than these
[1:02:33] shall he do because I go unto my
[1:02:38] father
[1:02:40] Amen in Mark 11 and verse
[1:02:45] 22 if you remember the story of the Fig
[1:02:48] Tree drying up by its roots in
[1:02:51] verse I'm sorry I it's in St Mark 11 St
[1:02:55] Mark 11 11 verse 22 and Jesus answer
[1:02:59] saith unto them have faith in God for
[1:03:02] verily I say unto you that whosoever
[1:03:04] shall say to this mountain be thou
[1:03:05] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[1:03:08] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:03:10] shall believe that those things which he
[1:03:12] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[1:03:15] whatsoever he saith therefore say I unto
[1:03:18] you whatsoever things you desire When
[1:03:20] you pray believe that you rece receive
[1:03:23] them and you shall have
[1:03:26] them how many believes that's
[1:03:29] true
[1:03:33] amen amen John 14 no that's not the one
[1:03:37] I'm looking for it's Matthew 17 Matthew
[1:03:40] 17 and we'll begin with verse 20 I
[1:03:44] believe it
[1:03:46] is let's go to 19 because we remember
[1:03:49] they were trying to rebuke a devil and
[1:03:50] cast them out out of the child and so
[1:03:52] forth but couldn't and then Jesus in
[1:03:55] verse 19 of chapter 17 then came the
[1:03:58] disciples to Jesus apart and said why
[1:04:00] could we not cast him out Jesus said
[1:04:01] unto them because of your unbelief for
[1:04:04] verily I say unto you if ye have faith
[1:04:06] as the grain of mustard seed he shall
[1:04:08] say to this mountain remove hence and
[1:04:10] and Y to a y place and it shall remove
[1:04:14] and nothing shall be impossible unto you
[1:04:16] how be it this kind goeth not out but by
[1:04:19] prayer and fasting now the point that I
[1:04:22] wanted to bring out was he says nothing
[1:04:26] shall be impossible unto you how many
[1:04:30] beli all things are
[1:04:33] possible the song We sang I think before
[1:04:35] coming up all things are possible is
[1:04:37] that
[1:04:38] right all things are possible to them
[1:04:42] that believe amen let's talk about deity
[1:04:46] speaking how many believe brother Bram
[1:04:48] said that whenever a ministers under the
[1:04:50] anointing back there when he comes out
[1:04:52] five-fold ministry under the anointing
[1:04:55] is The Voice of God speaking the same as
[1:04:58] deity speaking it's God speaking to
[1:05:01] folks amen now notice he says now he
[1:05:06] says we know that no man could move no
[1:05:08] mountain by just speaking to it he says
[1:05:11] the only thing could do that would be
[1:05:14] deity amen so then if that mountain is
[1:05:17] before us and our objective is right our
[1:05:20] motive is right then it isn't us
[1:05:23] speaking anymore it's deity speaking
[1:05:26] then it has to
[1:05:29] move amen and listen to what he says I
[1:05:32] truly believe that the church this was
[1:05:34] in 58 the church is on the brink of one
[1:05:36] of the greatest outpourings that it's
[1:05:39] ever had in any age amen now
[1:05:43] notice I'm going to move on down through
[1:05:45] here again now notice now if he is the
[1:05:48] Living Word if he is the Living Word
[1:05:50] then his this wrote here on the Bible is
[1:05:53] part of him then if you can receive this
[1:05:55] this into him if you can receive it into
[1:05:58] yourself which is the word this word
[1:06:00] comes into you by faith and makes it
[1:06:03] live how many believe that if the word
[1:06:05] comes into you if the holy spirit's in
[1:06:07] there now if you don't have the Holy
[1:06:09] Spirit you're not even any of his but
[1:06:12] you need that spirit in there brother
[1:06:14] Bram trying to say here you have the
[1:06:15] Holy Ghost and now you receive the word
[1:06:18] in there is't that right every promise
[1:06:20] is true therefore you say to this
[1:06:22] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[1:06:24] your heart because what you are deity
[1:06:27] speaking the Bible said so amen and
[1:06:32] whatever you say shall come to pass if
[1:06:33] you don't doubt he says if you can get
[1:06:36] all of the world bread out of you let
[1:06:39] the Holy Spirit M make you in into a
[1:06:42] full son or daughter of God no world no
[1:06:47] condemnation no
[1:06:50] doubt wasn't that a condition of
[1:06:52] anything is possible if you can be
[1:06:55] believe if doubt is completely
[1:06:59] gone then you are absolutely in a
[1:07:02] position to ask anything nothing is
[1:07:05] impossible for
[1:07:07] you are you
[1:07:10] ready oh
[1:07:12] my that's right nothing is impossible
[1:07:15] what is it then it's no more you it's
[1:07:17] God in you then you take his word it's a
[1:07:21] promise say father it's your promise
[1:07:23] amen something's got to
[1:07:26] move
[1:07:28] amen there it is he is spirit and he is
[1:07:33] life not that is just exactly what the
[1:07:37] word is exactly what Jesus is he is the
[1:07:39] word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled
[1:07:42] man in faith takes the word into his
[1:07:44] heart placs it upon his lips why that is
[1:07:46] the same as deity speaking mountains has
[1:07:49] to go Satan cannot stand before that
[1:07:56] how many like
[1:07:57] that final voice to the final age amen
[1:08:02] but so much I I just want to say so much
[1:08:04] more we're so much more than just our
[1:08:07] lips being used by God how many believe
[1:08:11] that amen we'll get get into that now
[1:08:14] notice once
[1:08:16] again this is going back a little make
[1:08:18] see see off the subject but you it'll
[1:08:20] tie in he was talking about Napoleon
[1:08:24] having conquered at all at 33 conquering
[1:08:26] pretty much the world but there was
[1:08:28] another young man that came into the
[1:08:30] world one time and he died at 33 and he
[1:08:33] conquered everything that could be
[1:08:34] conquered when he was on Earth he
[1:08:36] conquered passion Pride he conquered
[1:08:39] sickness he conquered Devils when he
[1:08:42] died he conquered death he rose up
[1:08:44] conquered hell he went in and conquered
[1:08:46] everything that was against mankind amen
[1:08:49] the great wine press God crushed it down
[1:08:51] and conquered death hell the grave
[1:08:53] sickness formalities everything else and
[1:08:56] overcome it all and Rose on the third
[1:08:58] day conquered all the atmospheres above
[1:09:01] and cut that mist between God and
[1:09:07] man and connected Heaven and Earth
[1:09:09] together or should we say connected God
[1:09:12] and man together how many knows the
[1:09:14] greatest honor and the greatest
[1:09:15] privilege we have is to have Jesus
[1:09:18] Christ to have God on the inside of our
[1:09:20] hearts the great
[1:09:23] comforter and all the Mist
[1:09:25] and all the
[1:09:29] Spooks all the hail mares and the all of
[1:09:33] these bead pushing and all of this Hocus
[1:09:35] Pocus and praying to whatever all of
[1:09:37] this stuff all the superstitions isn't
[1:09:40] that right he scattered all the
[1:09:43] Superstition especially in our age when
[1:09:45] he came in the evening light came
[1:09:48] through the through Malachi 4 is that
[1:09:50] right and it scattered
[1:09:53] all super superstitions and questions
[1:09:56] and it even even the Superstition of
[1:09:58] that you're going to burn eternally in
[1:10:01] hell if that ain't scary I don't know
[1:10:03] what it
[1:10:04] is to think when you go to hell there'll
[1:10:07] be never an end to it yes there will we
[1:10:10] found out there was we never knew that
[1:10:13] down through
[1:10:14] history amen the Amish they keep you
[1:10:17] Amish with that threat and with that
[1:10:19] scare but if you ever leave the AL
[1:10:21] you'll bur burn forever you'll burn for
[1:10:23] eternally well I sure don't want that
[1:10:25] better better stay right
[1:10:26] here huh all the sup all the he
[1:10:30] conquered all of that I no this what he
[1:10:32] does he cut every obstacle from the
[1:10:35] human beings that they might be
[1:10:37] connected like they were in the garden

[1:13:24] the a whole Egyptian
[1:13:28] Army something happens when those two
[1:13:31] omnipotents meet when you meet a man
[1:13:34] that surrendered to God has the faith of
[1:13:36] God in his heart when God comes down
[1:13:39] there and tells him to do something and
[1:13:41] there's nothing going to stand in his
[1:13:44] way how many believes we as children of

[1:13:49] duty amen and you've got God there is
[1:13:52] nothing that can stand in your way

[1:15:10] right oh my listen whatsoever you say
[1:15:14] with that creative power of the
[1:15:16] omnipotence God he says knowing that
[1:15:19] he's promised that he said it's in his
[1:15:20] word it creates a power that goes out
[1:15:22] yonder and bring things to pass
[1:15:27] amen things that are not it makes them
[1:15:29] though as though they are because two
[1:15:32] omnipotents have met there he
[1:15:35] strands oh my think about
[1:15:37] it what about Paul how many knows that
[1:15:40] Paul he was he was one of God's children
[1:15:43] he had omnipotence in him God come down
[1:15:46] amen and he was
[1:15:47] preaching I thought the other night
[1:15:49] brother brother Tommy we might just have
[1:15:51] all night meeting we could have probably
[1:15:53] done it you could have went another two
[1:15:55] hours and I could have went for
[1:15:59] three
[1:16:02] huh oh
[1:16:04] my that's right but we just don't have
[1:16:07] it anymore already I thought about you
[1:16:10] know uh you make a you know You' made an
[1:16:13] alar call like that back in the 1940s
[1:16:16] and 50s and you'd had that you'd had
[1:16:18] you'd had 30 40 people probably lined up
[1:16:20] to that
[1:16:22] trough back then
[1:16:26] even Billy uh
[1:16:30] Billy no no Billy Andrews remember he
[1:16:33] he'd come up through there and have have
[1:16:35] meetings up in russeville and all those
[1:16:37] areas and everywhere and they had all
[1:16:38] kinds of people but the Bible says that
[1:16:39] people's hearts would waxs
[1:16:42] cold people have cold
[1:16:44] Hearts folks I'm a pastor and I'll tell
[1:16:47] you what if Tommy he he didn't really
[1:16:49] make get the offer but somebody said
[1:16:50] would somebody want to just get closer
[1:16:52] to the Lord and and you know give to God
[1:16:55] complete heart you know tonight when I
[1:16:57] come up and then nobody goes I I don't
[1:16:58] know I I I want to get up there and I
[1:17:00] want to say yeah I do I want to close
[1:17:02] your
[1:17:03] walk I I'm not going to I take the
[1:17:05] opport miss the opportunity to get
[1:17:08] closer to the Lord if the opportunity is
[1:17:10] given it ain't a sign of weakness or
[1:17:12] that you're sinful or this that or the
[1:17:14] other hello it's a sign that you love
[1:17:16] the Lord and my you want more of
[1:17:19] God quickly to respond a soft heart how
[1:17:23] many need need hearts of Flesh not
[1:17:25] hearts of stone people's hearts have
[1:17:27] gotten stony one other place brother BR
[1:17:30] mentioned about America it's just been
[1:17:32] preached over until the people just sit
[1:17:33] and stare and and they become completely
[1:17:36] numb to the gospel because they heard it
[1:17:38] so much and they've been burnt so much
[1:17:40] and everything else until people just
[1:17:41] sit around and days so to speak let not
[1:17:45] get that way isn't that right amen oh my
[1:17:50] but we hum believe that the voice of God
[1:17:52] is still in the land today
[1:17:57] amen
[1:18:01] my all
[1:18:05] right that's
[1:18:08] right everything
[1:18:13] about not just the
[1:18:15] mouthpiece but every aspect of our
[1:18:19] hearts should be
[1:18:21] controlled by the Holy Spirit because
[1:18:25] Paul said it's not me that liveth
[1:18:27] anymore but it's Christ that lives in
[1:18:32] me soul see Christ Living in individual
[1:18:36] with that Soul surrendered Christ speaks
[1:18:39] through the lips he thinks through the
[1:18:42] mind he sees Through The Eyes he acts
[1:18:45] through the temperament hallelujah how
[1:18:48] many believe
[1:18:50] that our emotions are to be controlled
[1:18:53] by the Holy Ghost our feelings are
[1:18:56] supposed to be controlled our
[1:18:57] temperament is supposed to be controlled
[1:19:00] by the Holy
[1:19:01] Ghost the way that you act the way that
[1:19:04] you do tars people amen they should be
[1:19:06] able to see what has that person
[1:19:11] God he acts like a real
[1:19:15] Christian is that a heart's desire Lord
[1:19:17] help me to be a perfect reflection when
[1:19:20] people see you they see Jesus
[1:19:33] amen listen to this I liked it that's
[1:19:36] right you see through your eyes act
[1:19:38] through your temperament Hallelujah and
[1:19:40] the things of the world has passed away
[1:19:42] how can it be anything but sweet and
[1:19:44] pleasant all the time Christ has got
[1:19:46] control amen that's right it's Christ in
[1:19:49] you the great mystery how many believes
[1:19:51] out Christ the mystery of Christ in you
[1:19:54] that's the hope of glory it's a mystery
[1:19:57] to the
[1:20:00] world you know you know I probably
[1:20:03] shouted loud enough Tommy probably
[1:20:05] shouted loud enough for to go be heard
[1:20:07] two or three blocks up
[1:20:09] there
[1:20:11] hello but did you know that we weren't
[1:20:13] very loud preachers there was other
[1:20:15] preachers that were louder than us
[1:20:16] brother Tommy up
[1:20:21] there there was other people that was
[1:20:23] louder as far as I'm concerned preaching
[1:20:27] than what we
[1:20:29] were that's right what brother Bram say
[1:20:32] lived
[1:20:34] sermons you
[1:20:36] know for anybody to believe anything we
[1:20:39] say Tommy all they had to do was turn
[1:20:41] our head all they had to do is turn
[1:20:43] their heads and look at our
[1:20:46] wives look at the
[1:20:49] women amen you wearing long hair and
[1:20:53] having dresses on and the way that you
[1:20:54] did that spoke louder than anything we
[1:20:57] said I truly believe it was it it it was
[1:21:00] louder than anything because actions
[1:21:03] speak louder than words and if our wives
[1:21:06] would have been in pants and short hair
[1:21:08] and makeup and dressed like a bunch of
[1:21:10] prostitutes there ain't nobody would
[1:21:12] have believed our
[1:21:14] word maybe they would have but we as
[1:21:16] Believers wouldn't believe when somebody
[1:21:18] else talks and their wives look like
[1:21:19] that isn't that the
[1:21:21] truth we sure wouldn't hear nothing why
[1:21:24] because it speaks
[1:21:26] loud a li a life lived is so much louder
[1:21:30] than screaming or whatever it might be
[1:21:33] when women dress the way they're
[1:21:34] supposed to they say wow them really
[1:21:37] Christians
[1:21:38] amen all they had to do is look at how
[1:21:41] the were sisters are
[1:21:42] dressed amen it says everything it says
[1:21:46] more than we can ever
[1:21:48] say amen I thought it was
[1:21:52] good that's right you said well I
[1:21:54] believe the truth brother bam that's
[1:21:56] right it's in here it has to come here
[1:21:59] he says your whole makeup is Christ your
[1:22:04] attitude amen how many knows our
[1:22:07] attitude is
[1:22:08] Christ now let me just say this for the
[1:22:12] next 15 minutes if I can or a few
[1:22:14] minutes maybe not even that long but
[1:22:16] there's so many different aspects to
[1:22:19] Jesus all
[1:22:21] right because brother brandom talked
[1:22:23] about how that you know you know
[1:22:24] whenever you talk about love and when
[1:22:26] you talk about uh you know being kind
[1:22:29] cuz we know that Christ there's nobody
[1:22:31] is kind there's no other friend as kind
[1:22:34] as Jesus is as sweet and as gentle as
[1:22:38] Jesus is but brother bam talk preached
[1:22:40] about the kind old priest remember how
[1:22:42] he test whenever Jesus to plated some
[1:22:45] ropes and got mad
[1:22:47] and had his righteous indignation up and
[1:22:50] played at everybody he says well my kind
[1:22:52] old priest came and helped us when we
[1:22:54] were SI amen when we needed money he did
[1:22:56] this and here this guy comes all rambun
[1:22:58] and throws everything up what kind of a
[1:23:00] love does he have what kind of a man is
[1:23:03] this
[1:23:05] amen see there's a there's a Jesus where
[1:23:08] he says you know uh you know with the
[1:23:11] woman caught in the very Act of adultery
[1:23:13] he says you know he that is without sin
[1:23:15] cast the first stone and they all
[1:23:18] left and he says you know uh he says
[1:23:21] where's our
[1:23:22] accusers she says they're gone I don't
[1:23:24] have any he says neither do I condemn
[1:23:26] thee how what what sweeter words could
[1:23:29] you have as that neither do I condemned
[1:23:32] he just go and sin no
[1:23:34] more and on the other hand amen when
[1:23:37] Jesus speaks to Sinners he speaks in a
[1:23:40] certain way he speaks with
[1:23:42] Mercy even brother B said don't condemn
[1:23:45] The Sinner for sinner for sinning don't
[1:23:48] blame him for smoking his pipe and
[1:23:49] drinking his beer and doing all of that
[1:23:51] that's his pleasure that's the only
[1:23:53] pleasure he knows but live a life so
[1:23:55] that he can see that what you have is a
[1:23:57] million times more but when Jesus goes
[1:24:00] to talk to the Hypocrites and those who
[1:24:02] reject him he calls him a bunch of you
[1:24:04] bunch of you're your father the devil
[1:24:07] you serpents you snakes and boy he just
[1:24:09] gets all over
[1:24:12] him there's a different aspects of
[1:24:15] Jesus he speaks to The Sinner he speaks
[1:24:17] to the backslider he talks to the
[1:24:20] Hypocrites he talks to the
[1:24:22] Pharisees amen when you say repent every
[1:24:25] one of you amen you know that's actually
[1:24:29] God that's warning to people need to
[1:24:32] repent or
[1:24:34] perish it's actually speaking love to
[1:24:37] them
[1:24:39] amen so how many knows that sometimes
[1:24:41] you have to keep the balance on
[1:24:44] everything he says you know whenever he
[1:24:47] was dumb he opened not his mouth when
[1:24:49] they were accusing him of all those
[1:24:50] false accusations and all the things
[1:24:52] that he did
[1:24:54] he was a sheep to the
[1:24:56] slaughter and most of the time when
[1:24:58] somebody says something or does
[1:24:59] something to you you're supposed to turn
[1:25:00] the other cheek but you know when he
[1:25:02] came up to Simon's house and Simon never
[1:25:04] invited him and never and never he
[1:25:05] invited him but didn't welcome in all
[1:25:07] these other things and he said I've got
[1:25:09] something to say to you there are
[1:25:11] certain times when you want to when it's
[1:25:13] time to talk I mean please when you're
[1:25:15] living in a chrisan life you want Jesus
[1:25:17] to be able to say now let that Holy
[1:25:19] Spirit tell you when to talk and when to
[1:25:22] keep your mouth shut it takes Divine
[1:25:25] deity rulership in your heart for you to
[1:25:28] know what to do when to do what to say
[1:25:32] when to say
[1:25:33] it depends on who you're talking to and
[1:25:36] what you're talking about amen how many
[1:25:39] believes it takes wisdom it takes the
[1:25:40] wisdom of the holy spirit in our heart
[1:25:42] to operate for us to be able to govern
[1:25:44] this thing the way it is supposed
[1:25:48] to amen because if we don't if we don't
[1:25:51] then we're just about we bring such a
[1:25:53] reproach on it know no worse than if our
[1:25:55] women were dressed like prostitutes it
[1:25:57] brings a reproach on Christ when we act
[1:25:59] carnal when we're supposed to be
[1:26:02] Christians and we act in a way that we
[1:26:04] shouldn't act that's why it takes a lot
[1:26:06] of prayer brother Sean a lot of prayer
[1:26:08] and
[1:26:09] everything say God lead me help
[1:26:12] me help me do do this right here help me
[1:26:16] to speak to the sinner in the voice that
[1:26:18] he would speak to him in because brother
[1:26:21] Braham said he speaks to The Sinner in
[1:26:23] your voice in the voice that he would
[1:26:25] speak to him in he speaks to the
[1:26:27] prostitute in the voice that he would
[1:26:28] speak to them in he thinks through your
[1:26:31] mind the very thoughts and he speaks to
[1:26:34] your heart amen and the Very way that he
[1:26:37] would if he was here on
[1:26:40] Earth
[1:26:42] amen now I had to think the
[1:26:45] pope claims this
[1:26:48] position the pope claims that he is here
[1:26:51] instead of the Son of God in other words
[1:26:54] he is here acting as the Son of God no
[1:26:57] his church is here acting the Son of God
[1:27:01] and living the Son of God not just
[1:27:05] acting but living it how many beliefs
[1:27:07] God is speaking through us God is living
[1:27:10] through us he is thinking through us how
[1:27:15] many say God I have some improvement to
[1:27:17] do I need some I I have some growing no
[1:27:20] matter how spiritual you are right about
[1:27:22] now you got to realize amen cuz said
[1:27:24] whatever you would ask and he listened
[1:27:26] to this
[1:27:29] I when you've got that life when you've
[1:27:31] got this kind of life on the inside of
[1:27:33] you brother then then this kind of deity
[1:27:36] let me just see if I can say it the way
[1:27:40] that I've got it wrote
[1:27:41] down Amen Let me live in such a position
[1:27:44] with God that God moves in you to speak
[1:27:48] to
[1:27:49] your
[1:27:50] situations how many knows brother
[1:27:52] brandom live so close to
[1:27:55] God but hardly ever never hardly that I
[1:27:58] know
[1:28:00] of did Brother Bram ever do anything
[1:28:03] just in himself he always waited for God
[1:28:06] to tell him because even Jesus said I do
[1:28:09] nothing until my father shows me first
[1:28:12] now I believe that's the secret that's
[1:28:14] the secret between you failing in what
[1:28:16] you
[1:28:17] ask and receiving what you
[1:28:21] ask because a lot of times we ask
[1:28:23] according to to his flesh or in
[1:28:25] ourselves but I'm here to tell you that
[1:28:27] if ever God tells you to say
[1:28:29] something
[1:28:31] amen then you say it you believe it
[1:28:34] because remember butam he didn't just
[1:28:36] say well now I don't like this storm I
[1:28:38] want the storm to go away never did a
[1:28:42] voice said speak to it first whatever
[1:28:47] you say it'll
[1:28:49] be even the young
[1:28:51] couple he was saying man don't act like
[1:28:53] that don't act like that God said tell
[1:28:55] them whatever just say whatever you want
[1:28:57] to
[1:28:58] them and it'll
[1:29:01] be folks I know without one little bitty
[1:29:05] of Doubt not even one shadow of a doubt
[1:29:08] that he could have spoken him out of
[1:29:14] existence cuz see God don't tell you
[1:29:16] something and then you say something and
[1:29:18] he not back it
[1:29:20] up no God would have backed him up just
[1:29:24] just as that uh Elisha I believe it was
[1:29:26] you know that had got that temper about
[1:29:28] them kids and cursed
[1:29:30] them brother BR said he really shouldn't
[1:29:32] have done that that was his carnal
[1:29:34] nature that was his own self that was
[1:29:36] not a reflection of Christ but because
[1:29:38] he said it God honored
[1:29:41] it amen
[1:29:43] on so we have to make sure that it's God
[1:29:46] speaking through US believing through US
[1:29:50] amen
[1:29:54] people come to brother bandam they' say
[1:29:56] just pronounce healing on my child and
[1:29:59] it'll be done and and I believe
[1:30:02] it it'll be done how many remembers him
[1:30:05] him talking about that and brother Ram
[1:30:07] says I can't do
[1:30:10] that I can't do that why because if it's
[1:30:13] not him saying and then don't happen
[1:30:15] then your confidence is going to
[1:30:16] certainly be
[1:30:17] shattered is't that
[1:30:19] right I can't say it until God tells me
[1:30:22] to say it
[1:30:24] that's right
[1:30:27] because she might have believed it I
[1:30:30] don't know if it had happened or not I
[1:30:32] don't know the woman claimed or the
[1:30:33] person claimed it would have been done
[1:30:36] but bad things would have happened if it
[1:30:38] wouldn't have
[1:30:39] been false prophet ain't that right he
[1:30:42] said it was well and it
[1:30:44] wasn't boy wouldn't that be a real trick
[1:30:46] of the
[1:30:47] devil that's right to bring a reproach
[1:30:50] on the prophet but he was wise enough to
[1:30:52] say no I can't do it I won't do it until
[1:30:56] he tells me let me seek the Lord on it
[1:31:00] how many believ that's the way we need
[1:31:01] to live because I believe that we're
[1:31:03] coming brothers and sisters I want
[1:31:05] evening light Tabernacle I want all of
[1:31:06] us to come higher come to that place of
[1:31:08] adoption where God can trust amen trust
[1:31:11] us enough to give us that
[1:31:13] word

[1:31:17] speaking out of exist them or curse them
[1:31:19] and everything else amen but say the
[1:31:21] right thing what would the prophet do he
[1:31:23] said says I forgive you for
[1:31:26] that I forgive you for that he didn't
[1:31:28] want to send them to
[1:31:31] hell no because God is in a merciful
[1:31:38] god I wonder how they acted after that
[1:31:40] brother Tommy I don't think he ever said
[1:31:43] how they acted were they
[1:31:45] convicted that the Holy Ghost come down
[1:31:47] and such a way until they were just you
[1:31:49] know cuz you know the Holy Ghost can
[1:31:51] make a person just bring on such
[1:31:52] conviction until they can follow on
[1:31:54] their knees that's the kind of things
[1:31:56] that God can do especially when Hade
[1:31:58] right remember I heard kittens kids over
[1:32:00] there cutting up and carrying on weren't
[1:32:03] they he says I want my children he says
[1:32:05] you have them and them folks got under
[1:32:07] conviction comeing to left and what did
[1:32:09] they do come and fall on Mama's lap
[1:32:11] because he says if if if if God don't
[1:32:15] bring whatever you ask in your lap I'm a
[1:32:16] false
[1:32:21] prophet amen aren't we longing for that
