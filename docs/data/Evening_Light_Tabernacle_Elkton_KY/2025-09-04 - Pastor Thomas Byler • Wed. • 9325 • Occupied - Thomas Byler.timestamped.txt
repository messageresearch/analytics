[23:28] know, today's a very important day.
[23:31] It's a national holiday. Brother John
[23:33] Wade's birthday. How old are you,
[23:35] Brother John?
[23:36] &gt;&gt; 55.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; 5. Oh, he's double nickels. He's a young
[23:40] guy. My He's young. I didn't know he was
[23:43] that young, Brother John. God bless you.
[23:45] Let's give Brother John a hand. Amen.
[23:47] And
[23:50] you know, I I really appreciate him.
[23:51] They they drive a long ways and several
[23:54] of you do. And you know, I have a rough
[23:56] trip. It's about four minutes and it's
[23:59] hard for me sometimes, but God bless you
[24:01] all that you make such a great big
[24:03] sacrifice and and you know, uh, the Lord
[24:07] just knew I I needed to be close. That's
[24:09] all I can say. But we got mom had her
[24:13] procedure done today and she's doing
[24:15] good. And other than them being about
[24:18] four hours later than they were supposed
[24:19] to to do it, but everything went well.
[24:22] And and uh they of course at mom's young
[24:26] age, they were worried that she might
[24:28] not wake up. But you know,
[24:32] as I told them before, we don't worry
[24:35] about things like that because I believe
[24:38] that we're in God's hands.
[24:41] And when it's our time to go, whether
[24:43] we're walking, talking, or we're
[24:45] sleeping, we're going to go. But I
[24:47] believe that he's got us in his hands.
[24:49] You know, we sing that song. He's got
[24:51] the whole world in his hands. And I
[24:52] believe he's got me in his hands. You
[24:54] believe he's got you in his hands? And I
[24:56] got one more testimony. There's a lady
[25:00] in our in the church there at Christian
[25:02] Tabernacle in Arkansas, and Sister Mner
[25:04] Alexander. Uh, I've known her my whole
[25:07] life and she's the one that said that I
[25:08] would be in prison by the time I was 20
[25:11] because I was so mean. About a year and
[25:14] a half ago, she developed bleeding. She
[25:16] was just bleeding profusely. They had to
[25:19] go in and do surgery on her. Well,
[25:20] Thursday night, it started again. The
[25:22] cat come scratching at the door. So they
[25:25] rushed her to the emergency room and in
[25:27] and hing out there where we used to live
[25:29] and and so they transferred her to
[25:32] Jonesboro and and they was trying she it
[25:35] was just wasn't looking very good and
[25:38] and so they done surgery on her the next
[25:40] day and and when the surgeon got in
[25:44] there, you know what he told her? He
[25:46] said, "You healed yourself. There's not
[25:49] one drop of blood on the inside of your
[25:51] body."
[25:52] &gt;&gt; She healed herself. I said, 'Yeah, the
[25:55] great physician come by. Amen. And give
[25:57] her healing in her body. And
[26:00] Amen. She's in her She's in her 80s and
[26:05] but God is a healer tonight.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I, you know, I just I I think
[26:11] of what brother Donnie Reagan said. He
[26:12] called him said, "You poor old dumb
[26:14] devil. Every time I take my medicine, I
[26:16] say one of these days I'm going to be
[26:17] healed. I'm claiming what God's done for

[44:36] God bless you buddy.
[44:41] Lord,
[44:43] I believe.
[44:47] Lord,
[44:49] I believe
[44:52] that all things are possible.
[44:58] Lord, I believe.
[45:04] Lord,
[45:06] I believe.
[45:10] Oh,
[45:12] I believe
[45:15] that all things are possible.
[45:20] Lord, I

[45:25] [Music]
[45:27] Amen. And amen. Good evening.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Good evening.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to look out there and see
[45:34] each one of you. Amen.
[45:37] Thank you, brother David. Appreciate it.
[45:39] got me a good cold cold one. Amen.
[45:43] Praise the Lord. You know, I was just
[45:45] thinking about that last song we sang.
[45:47] Thank you, musicians, celib. Amen. If we
[45:50] truly believe that all things are
[45:52] possible. Amen. Ain't that a nice place
[45:55] to be?
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nice position to be in to be at a
[46:01] place to where we can believe that the
[46:02] God that you serve, with him all things
[46:05] are possible.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible.
[46:08] Wow. Right.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Nothing's impossible.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Well, that ought to get us excited right
[46:15] there. Amen.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be back. Amen. Had a good
[46:19] trip. Unfortunately, I think some of us
[46:22] caught some kind of a bug. I don't know
[46:23] just what it is, but it don't seem to be
[46:25] too bad, but Amen. So, uh just a little
[46:28] bit of chest congestion and and so
[46:30] forth, but Amen. Not enough to keep me
[46:33] down. Praise the Lord. We're going to
[46:34] get up and keep going. So, God bless
[46:36] everybody for coming out tonight. Amen.
[46:38] God bless you. We had a good trip. Amen.
[46:41] So, if you will, we'll just get into the
[46:42] word this this evening.
[46:46] Amen. I was just in my office this
[46:48] afternoon and really kind of just
[46:54] uh
[46:56] trying hard. Lord, give me something.
[46:59] Give me something. you know, and uh I
[47:02] had some thoughts that I had a little
[47:04] bit few hours before and I just kind of
[47:08] didn't know about all that, you know,
[47:09] didn't just didn't think about it. And
[47:10] then I begin to think about those
[47:12] thoughts again and and then it begin to
[47:15] kind of come and I says, "Well, Lord,
[47:17] maybe that's what you wanted." Amen.
[47:19] Amen. So, Lord, help me to be able to
[47:21] listen to your voice. Amen.
[47:24] Amen. Let's bow our heads before we read
[47:27] his word. Dear kind heavenly father, we
[47:29] Lord thank you Lord Jesus. Father to be
[47:33] gathered here with your children, the
[47:35] purchased of your blood, Father, that
[47:37] which you went to Calvary for, all the
[47:39] suffering that you went through, Lord
[47:40] Jesus, the price that you paid, the
[47:43] physical agony, the spiritual agony that
[47:45] you went through, Lord, for the people
[47:46] that are before me, Lord. And as the
[47:48] prophet has said, if I had a drop of
[47:51] blood, drop of your blood, how precious
[47:53] that would be in that vessel. But you
[47:55] said, "I have something even more
[47:57] precious than that before me." And that
[48:00] is the purchase of what that blood did,
[48:02] what that blood purchased, Father. And
[48:04] we thank you, Lord, for every soul that
[48:06] is here, Lord. And for those who love
[48:08] you, love you enough to come out on a
[48:10] Wednesday night, Lord. Lay aside their
[48:12] work, lay aside their busy schedule and
[48:14] the things of the world to come into
[48:17] your house to listen to what you have to
[48:19] say to us, Lord. We believe, Father,
[48:21] that you'll speak to our hearts tonight,
[48:23] Lord, through your word. Give me
[48:24] strength, Lord. And bless me, Lord
[48:26] Jesus, and give me the gift, so to
[48:29] speak, as the prophet put it, the real
[48:31] gift is to be able to get yourself out
[48:33] of the way, Lord. This is so true. So
[48:36] help me, Lord, to get out of the way and
[48:37] just let you have your way, Father,
[48:39] tonight. And bless the bleeding of the
[48:41] word, the meditation of our heart. For
[48:43] we ask it in Jesus name. Amen. And amen.
[48:48] Amen. All right. Go ahead and put that
[48:51] title up if you will. Amen.
[48:54] I want to talk about being occupied.
[48:57] Occupied. And it's actually kind of
[48:59] different because uh I don't really even
[49:02] have a word, amen, to pull out of the
[49:04] scriptures, but we'll try to explain a
[49:06] little bit. Is that all right?
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the first one we want to go to
[49:10] is John 6 and St. John 6.
[49:17] So, I thought, well, we'll just do a
[49:20] little Sunday school lesson today. Just
[49:22] a little teaching maybe. Amen.
[49:27] All right. St. John 6, Brother David
[49:31] Gadman will be with us this coming
[49:33] weekend. Amen. Our first Sunday of the
[49:35] month. Hadn't had brother David in a
[49:38] while. And so, Amen. We're looking
[49:40] forward to Amen. to hearing him
[49:42] minister. Amen. This weekend. All right.
[49:51] John 6.
[50:03] Yeah. Okay. Thought I had the wrong one.
[50:08] It is the spirit. Oh, 63.
[50:12] Did I tell you 63?
[50:15] &gt;&gt; All right. Now it's up there. Okay.
[50:17] Well, it got me again. All right. That's
[50:20] right. It's right there. It's on your
[50:23] coat. Right. All right. It is the spirit
[50:26] that quickenth. The flesh profitth
[50:29] nothing. The words that I speak unto
[50:32] you, they are spirit and they are life.
[50:35] Amen. May God add his blessings to the
[50:37] reading of the word. Amen. You can be
[50:39] seated.
[50:41] That's a scripture that came to me and I
[50:43] was beginning to think of how brother
[50:45] Bam talked about how that spirits travel
[50:48] with words. Ain't that right? Amen.
[50:51] Words carry spirits. That's what we want
[50:54] to talk about for a while with the help
[50:55] of the Lord. And and also uh there's
[50:59] another scripture I'm going to go ahead
[51:01] and read just to kind of lay a
[51:02] foundation. Jesus said, "When a strong
[51:05] man armed keepeth his his palace, his
[51:10] goods are in peace.
[51:13] But when a stronger than he shall come
[51:15] upon him and overcome him, he taketh
[51:17] from him all of his armor, wherein he
[51:20] trustth and divideth his spoils. He that
[51:23] is not with me is against me, and he
[51:25] that gatherth not with me scatterth."
[51:28] Amen. When the unclean spirit of a is
[51:30] gone out of a man, he walketh through
[51:32] dry places, seeking rest, and findeth
[51:35] none, he saith, I will return to my
[51:38] house, whence I came out. And when he
[51:42] cometh, he findeth it swept and
[51:45] garnished. Amen. So one thing we want to
[51:48] speak on a little bit with the help of
[51:50] the Lord is also along with this other
[51:53] is how that how that u
[51:58] you can be saved, you can be sanctified,
[52:01] you can even be filled with the Holy
[52:02] Ghost, but the devil will always bombard
[52:05] you. He will always come at you as long
[52:06] as we're in this life. Ain't that right?
[52:09] And we're living in an age when there
[52:12] the devil has many many weapons that are
[52:16] formed against us.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; He has so many tricks up the sleeve that
[52:20] it's not even funny. Ain't that right?
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, but the first thing I want
[52:25] to talk about first of all is uh
[52:27] avenues. Amen. Avenues by which uh the
[52:31] devil comes in. Amen. Amen. and and and
[52:34] how how how important words and the
[52:37] power of words are. Now, I thought about
[52:42] this here and and and where I got this
[52:45] about being occupied. Amen. It says that
[52:48] when he found this house, it was
[52:50] garnished. It was cleaned. It was swept,
[52:52] right? But how many knows it wasn't
[52:54] occupied?
[52:56] Amen. There was nobody there. It was
[52:58] empty. Brother Bam taught that if you
[53:00] don't get the Holy Ghost after being
[53:02] saved and sanctified, Amen. There's
[53:04] nobody there to protect you and he comes
[53:06] back. Amen. And gets you become more
[53:09] evil than what you was before because
[53:11] you've got to have the the Holy Spirit
[53:14] occupying the house. Amen. Guarding the
[53:18] house. How many believe there's a lot of
[53:20] guarding that we've got to do in our
[53:22] age?
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to talk to you about uh I
[53:27] want to talk to you about why people
[53:29] change. Why do people change? Amen.
[53:32] People will be going along just being
[53:35] you know uh so to speak perhaps a
[53:37] Christian and and so forth or or even
[53:39] preachers, message preachers even. Ain't
[53:41] that right? Go along for 20 years
[53:43] preaching the message and all of a
[53:44] sudden something changes. Ain't that
[53:46] right?
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I wrote down here, I said,
[53:52] "The reason that people change, the
[53:54] reason that we change is because we
[53:56] still haven't gotten to the place that
[53:58] we need to be."
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's pretty pretty strong
[54:03] statement, but it's true. Amen. Because
[54:05] we we need to change. Amen. We need to
[54:07] get better. We need to get closer to
[54:09] God. But I'll go ahead and say it while
[54:11] we're on it. Amen. Kind of getting ahead
[54:13] of myself, but h how um how many knows?
[54:18] Can somebody tell me what he said? what
[54:19] brother banham said about orman
[54:22] Neville.
[54:24] Amen.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. He said no matter
[54:28] coming or going, he said he never
[54:30] changes. He's he's always the same.
[54:36] You know, and me and my wife driving
[54:37] back from our our trip, we was listening
[54:39] to a message. I'm not sure which one it
[54:41] was anymore, but he had or brother Orman
[54:44] Orman Neville come up and to pray. And
[54:47] you talk about a prayer. My I wish I
[54:50] could pray like that.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; I thought, "Wow." I mean, he went on for
[54:54] a good little while and he was just my
[54:56] it was just a prayer now. And and you
[54:59] could see why Brother Brandham wanted
[55:00] brother Orman Neville for the pastor. I
[55:03] mean, it was he kept him in there many
[55:04] times because he knew what brother Brand
[55:07] what Brother Orman Neville was. Amen.
[55:10] But you know, it's the devil's business,
[55:12] isn't it? And this is this is going to
[55:13] really talk about uh a stability. Amen.
[55:17] Because Amen. We're starting we we're
[55:20] running in this race. Ain't that right?
[55:22] Amen. And I want everybody here to be
[55:25] stable.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; I want you to get to the place to where
[55:29] you don't have to change. And I know
[55:30] we're going to have to change probably a
[55:32] little bit all the way till we go to
[55:33] rapture. But you shouldn't be up and
[55:36] down and in and out and uh you know all
[55:37] of that, right? Brother Bam talked about
[55:40] that a lot of times because people
[55:41] haven't gone far enough. They're just
[55:43] justified or sanctified and and so
[55:45] they're still very unstable. They're
[55:47] still uh you know they're they're still
[55:51] uh um affected by the weather by a
[55:54] different weather that comes along.
[55:55] Amen. And for example, Amen. when
[55:58] somebody says something bad about you.
[56:00] Amen. A lot of people can't handle that.
[56:02] We say, "Well, you know, words can't
[56:04] hurt me. Six and stones may break my
[56:06] bones, but words will never hurt me. And
[56:08] we realize, well, I hope that you're at
[56:10] that place. Congratulation. That's very
[56:12] nice.
[56:15] I'm glad you're at that place. I hope
[56:17] that I am. Amen. Why? So to where I
[56:21] could, well, that person said this about
[56:22] you. And how many knows that is one of
[56:25] the biggest tricks of the devil a lot of
[56:27] times is for somebody to go tell
[56:29] somebody else something somebody said
[56:31] about them. Right.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; That's very nasty. That's very dirty.
[56:36] That's that that's can be very demonic
[56:38] because you're sowing discord.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; You're bringing bitterness towards those
[56:42] people. And and so and we realize that
[56:45] our tongue is a world of fire. And this
[56:46] is what James said. Amen. Behold how
[56:49] great a fire little fire kindleth. It's
[56:51] like a match. Amen. And you just light
[56:53] that little bit and you just say a
[56:54] little something and funny. I'm here to
[56:56] tell you it can split a whole church. It
[56:58] can divide families. It can split up
[57:00] friendships. It can all kinds of things.
[57:03] So, well, how many knows that words are
[57:07] powerful?
[57:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Words are powerful. Amen. And
[57:14] spirits not only not only with words,
[57:19] but thoughts
[57:21] are powerful.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; How many know words? Of course, a word
[57:25] is a thought expressed.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And I believe it was brother
[57:30] Bam said that Eve before she ever fell,
[57:33] before she ever had a relationship with
[57:35] that serpent, Amen. she first had to
[57:38] open up her what?
[57:40] &gt;&gt; The womb of her mind, in other words,
[57:42] the thoughts, the words that she was
[57:43] hearing, she had to open that up.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And how many knows the second that
[57:50] that uh uh the serpent said, "Thou shalt
[57:53] not surely die." Now, there was a
[57:57] spirit. And brother Bam said, "The most
[57:59] horrible spirit that there is is a
[58:02] spirit of unbelief."
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. A spirit of unbelief. I mean, come
[58:10] on, folks. How How about it? He really
[58:11] got us into a lot of trouble by her
[58:13] spirit of unbelief, didn't she?
[58:15] &gt;&gt; It caused a lot of problems and so will
[58:17] it to anybody that when you allow
[58:19] unbelief to come into your life, you're
[58:21] in for a world of of of terrible things.
[58:24] Amen.
[58:25] And before we go too far, let's just say
[58:28] this. And I like to take the opposite a
[58:30] lot of times here. It says, "The words
[58:33] that I speak to you, they are spirit and
[58:36] they are life." Amen. Hallelujah.
[58:40] Hallelujah. So he says this Bible, Amen.
[58:42] these words here are spirit. That's what
[58:44] he said.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. They are spirit and they are life.
[58:48] But they it does have to go into the
[58:51] right kind of ground into the right
[58:52] heart
[58:53] &gt;&gt; and that but they're alive. Amen. God
[58:56] God said, "My word goes forth. It will
[58:57] not come back to me void." Amen.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; It's powerful. Their spirit and their
[59:02] life. Amen. And
[59:06] &gt;&gt; well, maybe I should. What the hell? Go
[59:08] ahead and say it, you know, and and
[59:12] well, I'll wait. Amen. I'll get this
[59:14] thing all messed up. But anyway, Eve,
[59:17] Eve, back to Eve. Thinking about when
[59:19] Eve when the first things, you know, and
[59:22] I want to go back further yet. Let's go
[59:23] on back. Let's go back. You know, when
[59:25] the devil was still in heaven,
[59:28] all the way back when devil was still in
[59:29] heaven. What did he say? Thou has set in
[59:32] thine heart.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, it began with thoughts
[59:36] that the devil had,
[59:39] I would be like the most high. I will do
[59:40] this, that, or the other. And let's
[59:42] admit it. Any job that you have, any
[59:45] objective that you have, the first place
[59:48] that it comes to is in your mind. You
[59:49] might not tell your wife, you might not
[59:51] tell your family. You might not tell
[59:52] nobody, but you're going to have a plan.
[59:55] And that plan is in your mind. And
[59:58] that's the way it is with the devil. He
[59:59] just his thoughts got him into a lot of
[1:00:03] trouble.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Just those thoughts. I want to be like
[1:00:09] him. Amen. Let me say again with Eve it
[1:00:14] was thou shalt not surely die. The
[1:00:16] second that she received that word and
[1:00:19] believed that she wouldn't really die.
[1:00:22] She doubted the word of God. How many
[1:00:24] know that was it? She had fallen right
[1:00:28] then and there. Long before she was
[1:00:30] cursed, long before God come along, she
[1:00:33] had already fallen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; The second that she opened the womb of
[1:00:37] her mind. See that? How many knows
[1:00:39] that's one of the main channels that the
[1:00:41] devil comes into our mind. Amen. Comes
[1:00:43] up into the womb of our mind. And so,
[1:00:45] Amen. That's where the great battle is.
[1:00:47] And that's how a lot of times how the
[1:00:49] devil gets into or back into the house.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz we want our house, we want our house
[1:00:56] to be protected.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the goodman of the house, if
[1:01:00] he's stronger, how many knows you've got
[1:01:02] to be stronger than the one that's
[1:01:04] coming after you?
[1:01:06] How can you ever be stronger than the
[1:01:08] devil if you don't have the baptism of
[1:01:11] the Holy Ghost? But the Bible says you
[1:01:12] don't stand a chance against the devil
[1:01:14] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; You got to have the goodman of the
[1:01:17] house. You got to have that Holy Spirit
[1:01:19] there.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; To guard because it mean if you don't if
[1:01:24] you don't have the Holy Ghost, Bible
[1:01:25] says greater is he that is in you
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; So it's important to have that baptism
[1:01:32] of the Holy Ghost in your heart.
[1:01:36] Amen. And then faith also, brother
[1:01:38] Brandon many times talked about faith
[1:01:39] being that goodman. He said that
[1:01:41] whenever people get healed all the time,
[1:01:43] people come in meetings, get healed.
[1:01:45] Amen. And a week later, week later,
[1:01:46] they're worse than they were to begin
[1:01:48] with. Why? Because went out there, he
[1:01:50] said they went out there and they got
[1:01:52] sicker because the thing died or
[1:01:54] whatever. You know how he explains it.
[1:01:56] Amen. And they got sicker. And he says
[1:01:57] just as faith that killed that thing,
[1:01:59] unbelief will resurrect it again.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. ended up saying to that person's
[1:02:04] twice as worse as what it is was before.
[1:02:09] Amen.
[1:02:13] Amen.
[1:02:14] So we see that on the one side God his
[1:02:18] word they are spirit and they are life.
[1:02:22] They're powerful.
[1:02:24] Every thought every word comes from
[1:02:26] somewhere. Amen. And so on the other
[1:02:29] side of the coin so to speak, Amen. The
[1:02:32] devil's words are powerful.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; How many believes the devil's words are
[1:02:37] powerful? The devil's thoughts are
[1:02:40] powerful,
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; they're not as powerful as God's,
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; but they're powerful enough that people
[1:02:46] get to taken out and believing his word.
[1:02:50] All creation fell because of it. It was
[1:02:53] powerful enough to get all of humanity
[1:02:56] in the condition that we're in. Every
[1:02:58] ambulance, everything that ever happened
[1:03:01] was because of the unbelief that he
[1:03:03] brought that that evil spirit. How many
[1:03:06] believes it was an evil spirit
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; that come into Eve?
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; When she received that, she received
[1:03:12] that evil spirit
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; of I maybe you're right.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're right.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; That's what it took. Brother Bam said in
[1:03:23] a church, and I don't I like to preach
[1:03:25] on this. in a church. Oh, somebody will
[1:03:27] go through the church and say, "Well,
[1:03:28] this ain't right and that ain't right."
[1:03:31] Hello. Be careful. He said, "Because
[1:03:33] why? Those are words. If you listen,"
[1:03:35] And he also said, "If you just listen to
[1:03:37] gossip,
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; what will the Holy Spirit do?
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; It will take its flight if you just
[1:03:44] listen to it." Now, you might listen to
[1:03:47] it and say, "Now, brother, let's pray
[1:03:49] about it."
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Huh? And you might try to do that. But
[1:03:53] if you believe it and you accept it,
[1:03:55] you're going to have the same
[1:03:56] bitterness. You're going to have the
[1:03:57] same attitude that that person has.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil has a lot of ways to
[1:04:03] bring evil spirits upon us.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows that uh uh just
[1:04:08] that type of just those words, just
[1:04:10] those words of saying something bad
[1:04:12] about somebody. Amen. It'll it'll it'll
[1:04:15] bring an infraction.
[1:04:17] Amen. There's a spirit that comes with
[1:04:19] it.
[1:04:20] Amen.
[1:04:29] Proverbs 18 and 21
[1:04:32] it says death and life are in the power
[1:04:35] of the tongue.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; In the power of the tongue life and
[1:04:42] death.
[1:04:44] Ma Yeah, excuse me. In Matthew 12:36,
[1:04:49] I say unto you that every idle word that
[1:04:51] a man shall speak, they shall give
[1:04:53] account thereof in the day of judgment.
[1:04:55] For by thy words thou shalt be
[1:04:58] justified, and by thy words thou shalt
[1:05:02] be condemned.
[1:05:05] Hallelujah. Remember we preached on
[1:05:08] you're your own judge. God don't judge
[1:05:10] you. Brother Bam says your own judge.
[1:05:12] You decide whether you want to go to
[1:05:13] heaven or hell.
[1:05:15] It's whether you accept God's word or
[1:05:18] whether you're going to doubt God's
[1:05:19] word.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And whatever you confess with the
[1:05:23] mouth, confession is made unto
[1:05:24] salvation.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. So by thy words, Amen.
[1:05:31] You'll either be saved or be condemned.
[1:05:33] You'll either say what God said. How
[1:05:36] many believe that that's actually what's
[1:05:38] going to save you? If you'll if you'll
[1:05:40] confess with your mouth, hey, the Lord
[1:05:42] Jesus died on Calvary. it. I think
[1:05:45] Romans 7 or 8 there, Paul said, "For if
[1:05:48] we believe that Jesus Christ died and
[1:05:50] rose again and that God raised him up,
[1:05:52] amen, we shall be saved. For with the
[1:05:54] heart man believeth unto salvation, then
[1:05:57] with the mouth confession it's made unto
[1:05:58] salvation." Something like that. A
[1:06:01] little rough there, but anyway. Amen.
[1:06:04] So, it's got to be a confession of your
[1:06:06] mouth.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:14] So that's why brother Abraham said never
[1:06:16] let a negative thought go through your
[1:06:18] mind. I mean he believes you got to
[1:06:20] watch every thought that go through your
[1:06:23] mind
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; because the way that most of the time
[1:06:26] before you do something that thought
[1:06:28] will come in. I don't care what it is. I
[1:06:31] don't care if it's lust. I don't care if
[1:06:32] it's jealousy. I don't care if it's
[1:06:34] hatred. I don't care if it's bitterness.
[1:06:35] I don't care if it's unforgiveness. All
[1:06:37] those things are thoughts that come into
[1:06:39] your mind. a lot of times hurts and
[1:06:42] pains and wrongdoings and saying
[1:06:43] something wrong. Amen. I remember
[1:06:45] preaching something uh uh uh you know
[1:06:48] something about being led by the Holy
[1:06:50] Spirit and saying nice things. Amen. And
[1:06:53] went right after church went out there
[1:06:55] and embarrassed myself. Amen.
[1:06:59] Saying something to you. Amen. What I
[1:07:01] said to you, sister. Amen. And it was
[1:07:03] just, you know, I was like, man, can't I
[1:07:05] say anything right?
[1:07:08] But how many knows how many of you how
[1:07:10] many of you have ever done that? You say
[1:07:11] something, "Man, I wish I would have
[1:07:13] said that."
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's because we're human yet,
[1:07:17] ain't it?
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Sure. But it's very, very important. You
[1:07:21] tell your children the wrong thing. You
[1:07:23] tell them, "Amen. You ain't no good.
[1:07:24] You'll never amount to anything." You're
[1:07:26] really sewing a seed that you ought to
[1:07:28] be sewing.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:40] Amen. What was it, Jehoshaphat? And I
[1:07:42] wanted to go read that letter, but I
[1:07:44] didn't get to studying on it. But how
[1:07:45] many knows Jehoshaphat? And I'm not sure
[1:07:47] which king it was, but it was an enemy
[1:07:48] that had conquered everybody else. He
[1:07:51] sent Jehoshaphat a letter saying, "Don't
[1:07:52] you think that you're going to trust in
[1:07:54] God now?" now all these other guys
[1:07:55] trusted in their God. Ain't that right?
[1:07:58] And they were they weren't able to
[1:08:00] deliver him. And neither is your God
[1:08:01] going to deliver him. So just surrender.
[1:08:03] Ain't that right? But he went into
[1:08:05] prayer. Ain't that right? He went to
[1:08:06] prayer. Amen. And God spoke to him.
[1:08:08] Amen. And that whole army ended up being
[1:08:10] defeated.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he didn't take he didn't
[1:08:13] take what that what we would call letter
[1:08:16] of intimidation. That's what it was. It
[1:08:18] was a letter of intimidation. And that's
[1:08:20] what the devil does to every one of us
[1:08:22] if we aren't careful. He tries to
[1:08:23] intimidate you.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. With thoughts that are not
[1:08:26] according to the word of God.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:33] Amen.
[1:08:37] All right. So, let's let's look a little
[1:08:38] bit just for a few minutes in Numbers
[1:08:40] 13. It says uh uh you know, when they
[1:08:44] were when they were given
[1:08:47] the commission,
[1:08:50] uh I think a man out of each tribe, they
[1:08:52] were commissioned to go into the
[1:08:53] promised land and to spy out the land.
[1:08:57] Go spy the land out. Come back. Amen.
[1:09:01] and tell us what what's going going on.
[1:09:03] And they of course brought grapes like
[1:09:05] you wouldn't believe. And notice and
[1:09:07] they went and came to Moses and to Aaron
[1:09:09] and to all the congregation of the
[1:09:11] children of Israel. This is in numbers
[1:09:13] 13 and verse 26. Amen. And the
[1:09:16] wilderness of Pyan Kadesh and brought
[1:09:18] back word unto them and unto all the
[1:09:21] congregation and showed them the fruit
[1:09:23] of the land. And they told him and said,
[1:09:25] "We came into the land where the thou
[1:09:27] has sent us, and surely it flowth with
[1:09:30] milk and honey, and this is the fruit of
[1:09:32] it." Wow, that was very positive. It's
[1:09:34] good, wasn't it? Nevertheless, uh-oh.
[1:09:38] Nevertheless, the people be strong that
[1:09:41] dwell in the land, and the cities are
[1:09:43] walled and very great. And moreover, we
[1:09:46] saw the ch children of Anoch there,
[1:09:49] giants.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; I wrote down here what we're facing. You
[1:09:54] and I, Amen, we fight, we we we face
[1:09:56] giants.
[1:09:58] Amen. That the uh medical world says
[1:10:01] won't be healed, can't be healed,
[1:10:03] cancer, diabetes.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's one of the first things
[1:10:07] that when I found out that, you know,
[1:10:09] that uh you know, well, I don't want to
[1:10:12] say I had it, but
[1:10:15] anyway, the doctor said that I had it.
[1:10:17] Diabetes, somebody said, "No, that'll
[1:10:19] never be healed." Amen. Amen. That's
[1:10:22] something never healed. That's a giant.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Big, mean, and ugly. Hello. Amen. That
[1:10:29] you know, and and and big giants were in
[1:10:31] the law. We saw there the children of
[1:10:32] Anoch. Whether it's high blood pressure,
[1:10:35] maybe cancer, and the Amalachite dwell
[1:10:37] Amalachites dwell in the land of the
[1:10:39] south, the Hittites, and the Jebusites,
[1:10:41] the Ammonites dwell in the mountains,
[1:10:42] and the Canaanites dwell in by the sea
[1:10:44] and by the coast of Jordan. Amen. But
[1:10:47] Caleb stealed the people before Moses
[1:10:49] and said, "Let us go up at once."
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; And possess it, for we are able to
[1:10:57] overcome it. We are well able to
[1:11:00] overcome it.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; How many likes to confession like that?
[1:11:05] Amen. And I want to say tonight, this
[1:11:07] layout is age when the devil has got
[1:11:10] every gun that he's ever accumulated in
[1:11:13] 6,000 years. Every bit of his smarts,
[1:11:16] everything that he has, Amen, he's
[1:11:17] throwing it at you, he's throwing at me.
[1:11:20] But guess what? Amen. We're not going to
[1:11:22] go down with that thing. We're going to
[1:11:24] well overcome it. We're more than able
[1:11:26] to overcome it.
[1:11:29] We're able, oh my, we're more than able
[1:11:32] to come overcome lukewarmness and
[1:11:34] formality. Amen. just some church
[1:11:36] entity.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; We Oh my I believe that we can live the
[1:11:40] literal life of Jesus Christ. Amen. The
[1:11:42] way that the prophet said that we had to
[1:11:44] have in order to go to rapture.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; It will take the literal life of Jesus
[1:11:49] Christ.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Not just some formalism,
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; but we're more than able.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:04] I'm going to just say it where it comes
[1:12:06] to mind. We've come a long way, church.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; We've come a long way.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we're going to go further.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that we're going to go
[1:12:20] further and we're going to keep going
[1:12:22] and we're going to keep going. We're not
[1:12:23] going to stop. We're not going to have a
[1:12:25] certain plateau. We're going to go till
[1:12:27] we get out of here.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to go all the way to
[1:12:33] the fullness of Christ.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Not just partial, not just a halfway.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Not a halfway Christian life. No, that's
[1:12:42] not going to do for us.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Got to be a complete surrender.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, let's look at this report.
[1:12:52] Amen. One guy says, "Let's go up with
[1:12:54] one." But the men that went up with him
[1:12:56] said, "We be not able to go up against
[1:12:59] the people, for they are stronger than
[1:13:01] we."
[1:13:07] And they brought up an evil report of
[1:13:08] the land which they had searched out in
[1:13:10] the children of Israel, saying, "The
[1:13:11] land through which we have gone to
[1:13:14] search it is a land that eateth up the
[1:13:16] inhabitants thereof, and all the people
[1:13:18] that we saw in it are men of great
[1:13:20] stature."
[1:13:21] And there we saw the giants, the son of
[1:13:23] Anoch, which came to which come of the
[1:13:27] giants, and we were in our own sight as
[1:13:31] grasshoppers.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; And in so were we in their sight.
[1:13:38] Amen.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; That's the problem. That's right.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; And I thought, you know, I believe that
[1:13:48] we need a certain amount of
[1:13:52] self-confidence.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not I should not say self, but a
[1:14:00] certain amount of confidence about
[1:14:02] oursel.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Self-confidence would be
[1:14:06] confidence in yourself. But we have
[1:14:08] confidence in what we are
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; and who we are. We've got confidence in
[1:14:14] the God that we serve.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; When David went to Goliath, he didn't
[1:14:19] think I'm a little grasshopper. He said,
[1:14:21] "No, you big giant. You know, the bigger
[1:14:23] they are, the harder they fall."
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I read in the Bible the other day,
[1:14:31] Brother Brad, I've always had that giant
[1:14:32] getting hit and then hit falling
[1:14:34] backwards. I had it wrong. I read it the
[1:14:36] other day and it said he fell on his
[1:14:38] face.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. fell on his face.
[1:14:46] I wonder how many tonight have had
[1:14:48] giants in your life and you saw them
[1:14:50] fall on your face. Fall on their face.
[1:14:53] Depression fall on your face. Cancer
[1:14:56] fall on your face. High blood pressure
[1:14:58] fall on your face.
[1:15:00] Lukewarmness fall on your face.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Emptiness fall on your face.
[1:15:06] Robbing my joy fall on your face.
[1:15:08] Robbing my peace fall on your face.
[1:15:12] anything that takes away and robs you.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. In their own eyes, they were as
[1:15:19] grasshoppers because I'm here to tell
[1:15:21] you, they should have thought of it as
[1:15:23] David did. You know, we're more than
[1:15:24] able. Amen. Caleb stilled the people. Oh
[1:15:28] boy. I'll tell you what, no doubt. But
[1:15:30] he wanted to probably tell him, "Hey,
[1:15:31] y'all y'all need to shut up."
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. Quit with your negative
[1:15:37] talk.
[1:15:42] There ain't a one of us sitting here
[1:15:44] that should not be able to over any kind
[1:15:46] of a issue or problem that comes ahead
[1:15:48] of you that you face tomorrow. Any trial
[1:15:51] that you face, anything that you face
[1:15:53] tomorrow. Hello. Are you with me now?
[1:15:55] Amen. Amen. Because why? Because what?
[1:15:58] Look at what God has done. Look at what
[1:16:00] God has done in your past. Amen. All you
[1:16:02] got to do is have faith that that same
[1:16:04] God. Amen. He's going to take care of
[1:16:06] you in the future.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we shouldn't be doubters.
[1:16:10] Well, he saved us there. He brought us
[1:16:12] out of Egypt to give us water. He gave
[1:16:14] us food. Amen. He opened the Red Sea.
[1:16:16] But now we're whiners.
[1:16:20] There's giants over there.
[1:16:23] We can't do it.
[1:16:26] I'm here to tell you something tonight.
[1:16:29] Now, people listening out there, because
[1:16:31] of their statement there, they did not
[1:16:34] go in and God rejected them. Amen.
[1:16:36] They're going to hell. They're eternally
[1:16:38] lost.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. They came to Katis
[1:16:44] Barnea and they doubted for the last
[1:16:46] time.
[1:16:48] My God took them out and they all
[1:16:51] wandered in the wilderness and they all
[1:16:52] died off and their children went in.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; But and Jesus said they're everyone
[1:16:58] dead.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; God doesn't take kindly to unbelief.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so when we cry, when we doubt,
[1:17:07] don't fear, don't fret, don't be
[1:17:09] dismayed.
[1:17:10] How many know the devil tries to bring
[1:17:12] fear on us? He tries to scare the liver
[1:17:15] out of. But the Bible says, "Take
[1:17:16] courage and don't be dismayed."
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; There's thoughts, amen, that come just
[1:17:22] like these people. They were dismayed.
[1:17:24] When those people gave that report, they
[1:17:27] were dismayed. They were discouraged.
[1:17:30] I wrote down here that it turned their
[1:17:32] courage and it melted it down.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; It melted their courage.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as when David cut the head
[1:17:43] off of Goliath, ain't that right? And
[1:17:46] they were scared. They had been melted
[1:17:48] down into their foxholes. They were
[1:17:50] scared of that Goliath. But when the
[1:17:51] little old David come out there and took
[1:17:53] his head off, come on you men. I thought
[1:17:55] you guys were big guys. I'm a little guy
[1:17:57] and I took his head off. How about
[1:17:58] getting up out of there and killing a
[1:18:00] few yourself?
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; You know how many men got courage and
[1:18:03] how the giants and others killed because
[1:18:05] David's faith?
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as their courage was, you
[1:18:11] know, became greater because Amen. of
[1:18:14] what was done, so because of these men's
[1:18:17] words,
[1:18:19] they were dismayed and disheartened and
[1:18:22] discouraged.
[1:18:23] Amen.
[1:18:25] The doctor says, "You've got high blood
[1:18:28] pressure,
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; you've got diabetes,
[1:18:32] you've got cancer. You're going to die
[1:18:34] of cancer if you don't aren't careful.
[1:18:36] You'll be dismayed."
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; But we're not to do that. Ain't that
[1:18:47] right?
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; We're to take courage. Be of courage. Be
[1:18:50] very courageous. He told Joshua, "The
[1:18:53] land's ours. We're more than able.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; How many believe we're more than able to
[1:18:58] overcome anything the devil throws at
[1:18:59] us?
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:04] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, never let a
[1:19:07] negative thought come into your mind
[1:19:10] because those negative thoughts will
[1:19:13] bring all kinds of things. I call a
[1:19:15] these negative thoughts, they are a a
[1:19:17] cesspool. Amen.
[1:19:20] Hurts, wrongs, feelings. Amen. They
[1:19:22] bring evil spirits and bitterness.
[1:19:25] That's where the devil comes in a lot of
[1:19:26] times.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Unforgiveness
[1:19:31] is a place of cesspool for hatred,
[1:19:35] revenge, murder.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Unforgiveness. Why you think the Bible
[1:19:40] said so much that you got to forgive one
[1:19:41] another?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; As we walk along here, you got to
[1:19:44] forgive.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, it makes an opening.
[1:19:48] It's a window that the devil comes in.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; My my my praise the Lord.
[1:20:01] Amen.
[1:20:06] Question.
[1:20:10] What is it?
[1:20:12] What is it that defeats the devil any
[1:20:16] place, anytime?
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God in it.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; But man makes a statement paraphrasing.
[1:20:25] The word of God will defeat the devil
[1:20:26] anytime, any place, under any
[1:20:29] circumstances.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Not necessarily gifts,
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; not emotion.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; No, but faith in the word. You've got to
[1:20:39] speak it.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Give him the word.
[1:20:43] Brother Brandom, I did a search and he
[1:20:45] says, "Boo the devil. If the devil boos,
[1:20:47] boo him back." And how do we boo him? He
[1:20:49] said, "How do we do him? How do we boo
[1:20:51] him?" By quoting him the word.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; See, it's nowhere in the Bible. Just
[1:20:56] boo.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Hello. But that boo is in you applying
[1:21:01] the word like Jesus did.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Man, if you're Christ, you
[1:21:06] know, make these stones into bread."
[1:21:08] Boo, devil. The word says, amen, man
[1:21:12] shall not live by bread alone, but by
[1:21:15] every word of God. And he got his
[1:21:16] feather sins, folks.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; You apply the word. You give him the
[1:21:20] word and it will defeat him.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; It's so important that we apply the word
[1:21:29] of God.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; So much so
[1:21:37] that before God can heal you cuz he's
[1:21:40] the high priest up there now of what?
[1:21:43] He's the high priest of our profession.
[1:21:46] Brother Bam said profession confession
[1:21:48] is the same thing. In other words,
[1:21:50] before God can heal you before he can
[1:21:52] deliver you, do anything for you, you've
[1:21:54] got to confess that he's already done
[1:21:57] it.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; You got to believe that he's already
[1:21:59] done it. Even so, it's so crazy to think
[1:22:03] that better bannon would say if Jesus
[1:22:04] was right here, he couldn't do no more
[1:22:06] for you than what he's already done.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. He was here in my
[1:22:13] suit. If he's here in my suit, he can do
[1:22:16] nothing until first you accept what he
[1:22:18] done already. How many is glad that you
[1:22:22] can accept what he has done already? By
[1:22:24] his stripes, I am healed by his word. I
[1:22:28] am saved by his word. I am forgiven. I
[1:22:32] am justified. I am sanctified. I am
[1:22:36] glorified. His word said it.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; I believe it. That gives the devil a
[1:22:42] black eye.
[1:22:46] The power of confession.
[1:22:50] Faith confession. Amen.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Nothing is powerful. Brother Bram says,
[1:22:56] and I I had I had had one quote and I
[1:22:58] didn't bring it out. This is one of the
[1:22:59] rare times I only have one quote out
[1:23:01] here,
[1:23:03] but he's talking about the atom, the
[1:23:05] atomic bomb, and
[1:23:07] greatest battle ever fought. He's
[1:23:09] talking about how that the word Amen.
[1:23:12] will how Let me think now.
[1:23:15] Wished I had it.
[1:23:19] That's why he says that thing that that
[1:23:21] atomic bomb. Amen. Faith in the word of
[1:23:24] God is like the atomic bomb. It
[1:23:26] annihilates,
[1:23:28] disintegrates,
[1:23:30] casts out,
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; keeps out, keep the devil out of your
[1:23:34] house.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; How many believe that? It completely
[1:23:36] eradicates him. That power of that word
[1:23:39] in you speaking
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; keeps him out.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:46] Part of the reason was I begin to think
[1:23:48] about this, I thought, you know, we're
[1:23:49] living in an unstable world. Brother
[1:23:51] Brandham was living in a world where the
[1:23:53] Christian world the people that he knew
[1:23:56] he even had to preach a couple message
[1:23:57] called why are the people so tossed
[1:23:59] about ain't that right amen and
[1:24:02] different ones and he was mentioned say
[1:24:03] some of them are in the justified state
[1:24:05] some are sanctified state why why can't
[1:24:07] people keep the victory and so forth you
[1:24:09] know because they hadn't gone far enough
[1:24:12] with God
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; why can't they be stable why do why do
[1:24:16] why are they so movable why do people
[1:24:18] move so much
[1:24:20] Why do people go here and there all the
[1:24:22] time? Cast to and fro.
[1:24:27] Amen.
[1:24:30] I think as brother Bradam mentioned
[1:24:32] here, if everybody that has come to this
[1:24:34] church would still be here, the balcony
[1:24:37] was be full.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; But what is it? Something happened.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Something happens with people.
[1:24:50] I think about brother Josh, Leah, Devin,
[1:24:52] and Jana. I think about those who have
[1:24:54] come here few years ago. I really
[1:24:57] wouldn't expected you to stay very long.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Why? Because people would come and go
[1:25:02] just like that.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there was still too much
[1:25:05] unbelief around. That's right.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; People were not anchored.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; It's almost for a pastor, it's
[1:25:12] discouraging.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is wrong?
[1:25:18] Oh, you know, I don't care what you say
[1:25:20] about this church or me. I know where I
[1:25:23] stand.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; I know what God has done for this
[1:25:25] church. It ain't what I've done with
[1:25:27] this church. This is what God has done
[1:25:28] with this church.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we want. We want God
[1:25:34] in it. God gets the glory.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, no weapon
[1:25:39] formed against God's church will stand.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's unstable people.
[1:25:44] People ain't got no anchor. People ain't
[1:25:46] got the Holy Ghost down into soul that
[1:25:49] let thoughts come in, jealousy come in,
[1:25:52] pride come in,
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; all kinds of things and rule them.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; It's all carnality.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not godly. It's sulfuric
[1:26:04] acid.
[1:26:16] Lord, thank I thank God for stable
[1:26:18] people.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; I thank God that he's caused us to be
[1:26:21] stable.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And people that can control their
[1:26:24] tongue,
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; people that control their hearts, people
[1:26:27] that control their minds, and what
[1:26:29] thoughts they allow to come in.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's where it all starts.
[1:26:32] Comes into the mind, goes from here,
[1:26:34] goes to there. And I will, as a pastor,
[1:26:37] I will constantly hammer on people
[1:26:39] saying stuff they oughtn't say.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Doing things they oughtn't do
[1:26:44] because I know where it gets us.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:49] I just want to be a humble, simple
[1:26:52] Christian church. Is that all right?
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thank God for his goodness.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. today. Can I have a little more
[1:27:05] time?
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Talk about avenues by which the devil
[1:27:09] comes in and brings spirits in. We know
[1:27:11] that brother Brandon preached against
[1:27:12] the television because we know that.
[1:27:14] Amen. One wrong movie, one wrong word.
[1:27:16] It's a It's a window.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right for the devil to come
[1:27:20] in?
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. It was one window. But now
[1:27:24] look at it.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; We even called it in in our phones and
[1:27:28] everything to call it Windows. Windows
[1:27:30] 9, Windows 11, all kinds. It's windows.
[1:27:32] All you got to tap on that window and
[1:27:34] you better watch out. Ain't that right?
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're scrolling, you got to
[1:27:38] be very careful. I don't care if you're
[1:27:40] hunting videos and stuff. They'll throw
[1:27:42] some crap.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Will
[1:27:47] throw a little crap in there, baby.
[1:27:49] They'll throw some trash in there. Ain't
[1:27:51] that right?
[1:27:56] Got to watch this window.
[1:28:00] Oh my. But isn't that right? You got to
[1:28:02] watch it. That's why you got to watch
[1:28:04] your children whether they have a phone
[1:28:05] or not and where they are and whether
[1:28:07] they're alone or not and all that other
[1:28:09] stuff. You better watch out. Those
[1:28:10] spirits will come in quicker than we can
[1:28:12] shake a stick.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Kids, we know all the way back in
[1:28:16] Elvis Presley and all of that when they
[1:28:17] begin to come out with those songs.
[1:28:19] Amen. And those rock and roll songs and
[1:28:21] those lusty songs. Amen. The world just
[1:28:23] blew up in lust. Blew up in murders.
[1:28:26] Blew up in all kinds of stuff. That's
[1:28:28] where brother Ram says streams of demon
[1:28:30] powers are coming because of the music
[1:28:32] that's being played that's being allowed
[1:28:34] to play the words that are being sung.
[1:28:38] And now you have people getting ready
[1:28:39] for Armageddon with all the video games
[1:28:42] and the killing and the murdering and
[1:28:43] the bloody splattering desensitizing
[1:28:46] people. Them kids are becoming
[1:28:48] desensitized. They can go into a school
[1:28:50] and shoot them up and have no feelings
[1:28:52] about it. Why? They practice it on a
[1:28:54] video game.
[1:28:58] Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; I think you like that video brother
[1:29:02] Tommy sent. I think it was on the church
[1:29:03] said I wa watched that where a little
[1:29:05] girl Amen. You know, she was on her
[1:29:07] phone and she had gotten killed because
[1:29:08] her mom wanted her help her look, you
[1:29:11] know, and see because it was raining
[1:29:12] hard and she didn't. She was too busy on
[1:29:14] her phone and Amen. and so forth and and
[1:29:16] all the things that Jesus told her
[1:29:19] about, you know, how girls will get on
[1:29:21] there and and look at all these models
[1:29:23] and wish they were like that and they'll
[1:29:25] feel bad because they're not. Hello. And
[1:29:27] and and it ends up they end up getting
[1:29:29] spirits that ought to have depression.
[1:29:32] They ought to have just by getting on
[1:29:34] there.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Why? These are all windows avenues by
[1:29:37] which the devil comes in. Amen. You take
[1:29:40] let a woman dress ill fame. Let her
[1:29:43] dress wrong. What does it if a man don't
[1:29:45] turn his head and he looks and he
[1:29:48] thanks, a spirit of lust, boom.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? A spirit of lust will
[1:29:53] jump on you quicker what you can shake
[1:29:54] his dick.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. If you open up your mind,
[1:29:58] that's why you have to turn your head.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just avenues by which the devil
[1:30:04] comes.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Nelly Sanders found out. She
[1:30:09] found out when she stopped and had a
[1:30:11] couple thoughts. See, she ought to have
[1:30:12] thought that said the devil said, "Do
[1:30:15] you remember?" Sometimes the devil uses
[1:30:17] our memory.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He uses our memory. We
[1:30:20] used to dance this, that, or the other.
[1:30:22] And what happened? What happened with
[1:30:24] her? She stopped and she entertained the
[1:30:26] thought and a spirit came on her. And
[1:30:28] before she knew it, she was out there
[1:30:30] dancing.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And right back out there and a
[1:30:33] hideous devil, devil demonized bat
[1:30:37] looking thing got into her. Brother
[1:30:39] Brandham cast it out and maybe she had a
[1:30:41] hard time getting it out of the house.
[1:30:43] Ain't that right? Y'all remember the
[1:30:44] story?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and laugh a little bit. It's It
[1:30:47] was funny, wasn't it?
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; His brother jumping off the bed and him
[1:30:51] going in behind and
[1:30:54] his brother sobered up. Ain't that
[1:30:55] right?
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Sobered up, man. That's right. But the
[1:30:58] point was she allowed that thought to
[1:31:00] come in. How many we got to guard our
[1:31:03] thoughts?
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm tired. But I don't feel like
[1:31:07] going tonight.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Bitter guard your thought.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He that is faithful in little
[1:31:13] things will be faithful in many.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; He's not faithful in little things, how
[1:31:17] will we be faithful in on many big
[1:31:19] things? Amen.
[1:31:22] Amen. So many things.
[1:31:25] Praise the Lord. That's right. John
[1:31:28] Ryan, what did he have to do? Didn't
[1:31:30] feel it. Went back and says, "I ain't
[1:31:31] healed." And you said I was going to be.
[1:31:33] Don't you believe me? Yeah, I believe
[1:31:35] you. All right, then. Go out there and
[1:31:36] confess it. All he can do say is,
[1:31:38] "Praise God, I'm healed. Praise God, I'm
[1:31:41] healed." Amen. If you can't do nothing
[1:31:43] else, repeat that word over and over and
[1:31:45] over and over again. Amen. And your body
[1:31:48] will come subject to it.
[1:31:52] Doesn't have to be an emotion or a
[1:31:53] thrill down your back. No, just take
[1:31:56] that word, believe it. Brother Bam says
[1:31:58] something's got to happen
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; cuz God keeps his word.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. the thought of what God said.
[1:32:07] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:12] Amen.
[1:32:17] Legion. How did he get that way? Brother
[1:32:20] Ram said maybe he came home and had a
[1:32:22] drink or whatever and his wife asked him
[1:32:24] if he had a drink. Said, "No, honey. I
[1:32:25] didn't drink." Huh? What happened? The
[1:32:29] second he chose not to confess and be
[1:32:31] honest, a spirit of lying came on him.
[1:32:34] Ain't that right? The spirit of lion
[1:32:37] came on him and then another one came on
[1:32:38] and then another one. Before he knew it,
[1:32:40] he was out there in that graveyard. How
[1:32:42] many knows? Listen kids, it's easy.
[1:32:45] Amen. To take one spirit and then they
[1:32:47] take a lot of spirits.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. They multiply. They come in by the
[1:32:52] droves. Ain't that right? They'll come
[1:32:54] in by the droves. You just get a little
[1:32:56] attitude.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:02] In saying this, I thought about saying
[1:33:05] this. You might get an attitude towards
[1:33:07] me.
[1:33:10] That's right. Because I'm not perfect.
[1:33:12] Sometimes I say stuff up here that some
[1:33:15] of you maybe don't like. And maybe I
[1:33:18] shouldn't say it. Maybe it was my carnal
[1:33:20] self.
[1:33:23] But my question is, what kind of
[1:33:25] attitude do you take towards it?
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:31] Well, I ain't never coming back.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; I'm leaving here. He ain't got a lick a
[1:33:37] sense that armies boy,
[1:33:40] huh? All kinds of things. Just just the
[1:33:43] attitude. Hello.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Just a second you take that attitude or
[1:33:48] you say, "Wow, I'm sure he didn't mean
[1:33:50] to say that." Or, you know, there's
[1:33:51] another way of looking at it. Bless him,
[1:33:53] Lord.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:33:57] So I thought about saying that. So now I
[1:33:59] said but no matter no matter who it is,
[1:34:01] no matter what it is, guard your heart.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Guard your
[1:34:08] heart. How do you guard your heart? By
[1:34:10] guarding your mind and by guarding your
[1:34:12] thoughts
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; every single day.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; How many knows the internet and all of
[1:34:18] that stuff? Those are all weapons that
[1:34:20] are formed against you.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. There's Oh, it's Oh my.
[1:34:26] Here we go. I said when I come to this
[1:34:29] part, I said, "Now preach.
[1:34:32] Woo. Think about it. Every form." Amen.
[1:34:35] He has so many weapons against you. But
[1:34:37] when you got that Holy Ghost, you got to
[1:34:39] have that Holy Ghost
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; to keep him out.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; When you're happy, stay happy.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; When you're stable, stay stable.
[1:34:52] How many believe that God brings
[1:34:54] stability in people's lives?
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Not instability.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:35:08] Wow.
[1:35:10] Every word of God when you think about
[1:35:14] every word of God is spirit and they are
[1:35:17] life.
[1:35:19] Now, in closing,
[1:35:26] we know that God spoke the word. Ain't
[1:35:30] that right? Even the prophecy of
[1:35:33] Revelation is the spoken word. And
[1:35:36] whatever isn't fulfilled yet will be
[1:35:39] fulfilled.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. Mary was the
[1:35:46] beneficiary of that.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Because it was alive. It
[1:35:51] was real.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll send you Malachi 4. I'll send
[1:35:56] you Elijah to prophet before the coming
[1:35:58] of the great and dreadful day of the
[1:36:00] Lord.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Remember this before I go on. It's the
[1:36:08] devil's business to devalue the word of
[1:36:11] God.
[1:36:12] Just like the water baptism, people
[1:36:14] might say, and I know sure it's not
[1:36:16] anybody here, people might say, "Well,
[1:36:18] doesn't really matter how you baptize."
[1:36:23] I just got one thing to say. Jesus after
[1:36:26] dying on the cross,
[1:36:29] going down to hell, fighting with the
[1:36:31] devil, kicking him around, grabbing the
[1:36:33] keys of death, hell, and the grave,
[1:36:36] coming up out of there, making himself
[1:36:38] visible to the disciples. And one and
[1:36:41] only commandments that he gives them is
[1:36:43] to go into all the world. Amen. And
[1:36:46] baptizing them in the name of the
[1:36:47] father, son, and the holy ghost, which
[1:36:49] is Jesus Christ. And you want to say it
[1:36:52] doesn't matter.
[1:36:56] Amen. How many knows that's that's a
[1:36:59] devil talking?
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "If you've been
[1:37:03] baptized, Amen. and and you got the Holy
[1:37:05] Ghost." There's a lot of people baptized
[1:37:07] in Father, Son, the Holy Ghost on in
[1:37:09] dark ages. But he said, "Now that you
[1:37:11] know, it'll be different.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; You're not ignorant anymore now.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; You'll be responsible when you hear the
[1:37:18] truth.
[1:37:19] If you've got the Holy Ghost, I'll say
[1:37:21] this. I'll say this. I believe if you've
[1:37:24] got the Holy Ghost and you reject the
[1:37:26] truth of the word, you're going to lose
[1:37:27] your Holy Ghost.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Hello. Well, you can't turn the light
[1:37:32] down. Amen. I want to say this. How many
[1:37:34] believe this message, the message of the
[1:37:36] hour, Amen. This is what God has sent to
[1:37:38] us.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; I want to say that this message, every
[1:37:41] message is anointed.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we wonder, well, what should I
[1:37:45] testify? What should I say? What words
[1:37:47] should come out of my mouth? Tell them
[1:37:49] that God sent a prophet in this
[1:37:51] generation. Tell them that God's in
[1:37:53] Malachi 4. I'm here to tell you tonight,
[1:37:55] Brother Brandham said, if they are seed
[1:37:57] of God, when that light shines, when
[1:37:59] that word comes forth, amen, they'll be
[1:38:02] quickened.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; It'll quicken. There'll be thousands
[1:38:05] that won't believe it, but there'll be
[1:38:06] that one
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; in a while that'll receive it.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; How many is that one once in a while?
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. We got a lot of them. That
[1:38:17] one once in a while will say, "I believe
[1:38:19] that's the truth."
[1:38:21] tell them that God had to come down and
[1:38:23] all this mess of these churches and
[1:38:24] everything. I mean, he had to come and
[1:38:26] show us a way that we would know that's
[1:38:28] right. If that don't catch their
[1:38:30] attention, I don't know what will. It
[1:38:31] did mine. I would say absolutely that is
[1:38:34] the truth. I do want to know which way
[1:38:36] is right.
[1:38:38] So, what I say, what I'm saying is when
[1:38:40] you speak this message, when you're a
[1:38:42] witness of this message to people, Amen.
[1:38:44] It's got power in it.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; It's not some old dead letter. It's
[1:38:48] power. God is behind it.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; I've heard of people for the first time
[1:38:56] listening to serpent seed and other very
[1:38:59] strong messages. Hello, and picking it
[1:39:03] up just like that.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; I don't say sometimes it don't take a
[1:39:06] little bit. I don't say that. But if
[1:39:08] they're a seed, according to the prophet
[1:39:10] of God, if you're a seed of God, when
[1:39:13] that light comes across your way, you're
[1:39:16] going to come. You're going to sprout.
[1:39:18] You're going to come forth.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:28] All right.
[1:39:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:35] God is good, isn't he?
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; So, let's get shut in with God. How many
[1:39:43] wants to get shut in God? With God.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Young people get shut in with God.
[1:39:47] Remember what I'm telling you tonight
[1:39:50] about watch every thought that comes to
[1:39:51] your mind.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Watch everything that you watch on the
[1:39:55] internet. Be careful. Is that right?
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Cuz it them things will jump out of that
[1:40:01] phone onto you in a heartbeat.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. If you're going to have
[1:40:08] victory in your heart, you're going to
[1:40:09] have joy in your heart. The devil's
[1:40:12] going to try to get you.
[1:40:14] All of those weapons out there,
[1:40:15] everything out there is formed to try to
[1:40:18] get you
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; to fall, to open up your heart or mind
[1:40:22] so that he can come in and bring all
[1:40:24] kinds of devils in.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Don't really want to say it.
[1:40:34] Amen.
[1:40:36] So, I don't think I will.
[1:40:39] But I'm here to tell you one thing that
[1:40:42] if you open up all of that garbage
[1:40:45] that's out there,
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; you'll be susceptible to it.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; You'll be susceptible to it.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Terrible.
[1:40:55] Evening like tabernacle.
[1:40:57] Be sound. Be stable. Get to the place to
[1:41:01] where you can stay the way that you're
[1:41:02] supposed to be.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I got to change. I got to change.
[1:41:08] Well, then change.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Change to what you're supposed to be and
[1:41:12] then walk in it. God hung the stars. He
[1:41:15] put them there and he says, "Go there
[1:41:16] and hold your place. Find your place."
[1:41:19] Amen. And then stay there because the
[1:41:22] devil do anything to get you out of your
[1:41:25] place.
[1:41:30] Amen. God bless you. Let's stand.
[1:41:32] if you'll come.
[1:41:38] Thank you for your prayers.
[1:41:40] Thank God for the energy to be able to
[1:41:43] minister and Amen.
[1:41:46] Not being dog sick. Little bit, but not
[1:41:49] bad. Praise the Lord. Amen. Could use
[1:41:52] Tylenol right now, but that's all right.
[1:41:55] You love the Lord.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Do you love each other?
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We all love each other. Amen.
[1:42:02] Let me see. How does how does that go?
[1:42:09] Right.
[1:42:11] That's okay. Is it a heart? Ain't that
[1:42:14] right? It means I love you. Right.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Love you. I just thought about that when
[1:42:19] I was studying. I said, I'm gonna give
[1:42:21] him a heart. Everybody else does that.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Let's give the Lord
[1:42:29] a hand. Say thank you.
[1:42:31] Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:35] God bless you.
[1:42:37] [Applause]
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; That's awesome, wasn't it?
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I The song come on my heart and uh
[1:42:48] God is good all the time. And the first
[1:42:51] verse says, "If you're walking through a
[1:42:54] valley,
[1:42:55] there are shadows all around, but do not
[1:42:58] what?"
[1:43:00] That's right. Amen. For God is good all
[1:43:03] the time. Well, if you're walking
[1:43:08] through the valley,
[1:43:11] oh, there are shadows
[1:43:14] all around.
[1:43:18] Do not fear.
[1:43:22] He will guide you. Oh, he will keep you
[1:43:28] safe at sound.
[1:43:36] Remember,
[1:43:38] where'd they go
[1:43:42] [Music]
[1:43:43] of Thomas?
[1:43:46] God is good
[1:43:50] all the time.
[1:43:52] He puts a song of grace in his heart of
[1:43:58] mine. God is good
[1:44:03] all the time
[1:44:06] and through the darkest
[1:44:09] night his light will shine. God is good.
[1:44:16] Oh, he's so good.
[1:44:21] God.
[1:44:23] Well, we were sinners,
[1:44:27] so are worthy.
[1:44:30] Yet for us, he chose to die.
[1:44:37] He filled us with
[1:44:40] the Holy Spirit.
[1:44:44] Now we can stand and testify.
[1:44:50] Oh that his love
[1:44:54] is everlasting
[1:44:58] and his mercies
[1:45:00] oh they will never end. God is good. Oh
[1:45:06] yes.
[1:45:07] All the time
[1:45:10] he puts a song of praise in this heart
[1:45:16] of mine. God is good
[1:45:21] all the time.
[1:45:24] And through the darkest
[1:45:27] night, his light will shine. God is
[1:45:32] good.
[1:45:34] Oh, he's so good
[1:45:38] all the time.
[1:45:41] And though I may not understand
[1:45:48] all the plans you have for me.
[1:45:55] For my life is in your hands
[1:46:01] and through the eyes of faith I can
[1:46:06] clearly see. Oh God is good.
[1:46:11] Oh all the time.
[1:46:15] He puts a song of grace in this heart of
[1:46:21] mine. God is good.
[1:46:25] All the time
[1:46:29] through the darkest
[1:46:31] night, his light will shine. God is
[1:46:36] good.
[1:46:38] Oh, he's so good
[1:46:42] all the time. Amen.
[1:46:46] Amen.
[1:46:49] Amen. You love him with all of your
[1:46:52] heart. You know, there's something I've
[1:46:54] always thought of when
[1:46:56] they talk about that they carried that
[1:46:58] cluster of grapes out. How many likes
[1:47:00] grapes? Oh, I when I worked in the
[1:47:02] grocery store, those grapes would come
[1:47:04] in those big clusters. I think it took
[1:47:06] two men to carry a cluster of grapes. I
[1:47:10] always thought, how could they not
[1:47:11] believe
[1:47:13] with the evidence that was in front of
[1:47:15] them? And how can we not believe today
[1:47:18] without with the evidence in front of
[1:47:20] us? Amen. It's been good to be in the
[1:47:22] house of the Lord. And brother Brad, we
[1:47:24] have a prayer request that come in.
[1:47:26] Would you come and pray over this and
[1:47:28] dismiss this tonight? It was given to me
[1:47:30] just a few minutes ago.
[1:47:38] It's a prayer request for Mansky's son,
[1:47:41] Tammy Mansky's son, friend of Adriana,
[1:47:44] and he's having surgery tomorrow at
[1:47:46] 9:00. and we just want to pray that the
[1:47:48] Lord would guide the hands of the
[1:47:50] physicians and that all would be well.
[1:47:52] So, let's just bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:47:53] Father, we come before you tonight.
[1:47:55] Lord, we're praying for this young man,
[1:47:57] Danny. And we don't don't know the
[1:47:59] situation of the surgery or uh or what
[1:48:02] the ailment is, but Father, we know the
[1:48:04] the creator of the body. We know the
[1:48:06] maker of the body, Lord. And we know the
[1:48:08] great physician. And Lord, the doctors,
[1:48:10] they'll treat us and they'll give us
[1:48:12] medicine and pain relief and try to fix
[1:48:15] the problem. but only you're the healer,
[1:48:17] Father. So Lord, we commit this young
[1:48:19] man into your hands tonight, Lord. And
[1:48:21] we just ask, Lord, that you would lead
[1:48:23] and guide and direct the physicians as
[1:48:25] they prepare to do the surgery and that
[1:48:27] they would just be able to to have the
[1:48:30] surgery without any complications, Lord,
[1:48:32] and that you would just sweep through
[1:48:33] the operating room. And Lord, that you
[1:48:35] would touch his body with a supernatural
[1:48:38] touch, Lord, and give him the the
[1:48:41] recovery that he needs. Lord, we just
[1:48:43] want to tell you we love you. We
[1:48:44] appreciate you. We thank you for the
[1:48:45] word tonight, Lord, as it went forth.
[1:48:47] And we thank you for this close-knit
[1:48:49] church that loves one another and and
[1:48:51] that has been growing in in in the word
[1:48:54] and and with each other. And we just
[1:48:56] ask, Lord, that you continue to bless
[1:48:57] our church, bless our pastor, and and
[1:48:59] each and every family that's here, Lord,
[1:49:01] and be with us tonight as we go our
[1:49:03] separate ways, Father. And may your
[1:49:05] guardian angels be about us, encamped
[1:49:07] about us, and bring us back at your
[1:49:09] appointed time. We just want to tell you
[1:49:10] we love you. We appreciate you. and
[1:49:12] thank you for all you do. In Jesus name
[1:49:14] we pray. Amen. Amen. God is good
[1:49:21] all the time.
[1:49:24] He puts us all the praise in this heart
[1:49:30] of mine. God is good
[1:49:35] all the time.
