she's doing fine and she should she didn't get to go to church much and i think she's about hour from there and she said i just don't get around as good as i used to but she said i want y'all to know she said i really miss my church family i said well we'll be praying for you so remember sister martha in prayer and i i wasn't trying to prostitute but i told her i said well if you can't go just facebook us i know there's probably other places she could closer but she sure does miss everyone so god bless you this morning and we're going to turn the service to brother thomas this morning i appreciate brother brad amen and his ministry and amen the blessing that he is and i'm just looking forward for what god will have for us this morning amen let's sing amazing grace grace how sweet the sound that saved was lost [Music] [Applause] through me [Music] we have it was grace that brought [Music] [Applause] me [Music] we home when we've been there ten thousand years [Music] [Laughter] the sun [Music] days to see god's praise and [Music] amen good to be in the house of the lord this morning i always love that last verse when we've been there ten thousand years but no no less days we can just keep praising and praising and praising and praising there's no no less days it won't end and uh that's that's the hope for the believer and and the christian that loves the lord so let's just bow our heads if we can go before the lord in prayer gracious heavenly father we thank you lord for this day you've given us for your many blessings lord for the opportunity you've given us to speak to your people lord and lord what a honor and privilege and responsibility it is lord to open the word and and break it forth to the people or we just trust that what you've laid on my heart what you've inspired me to preach lord i i just pray lord that your inspiration would come down and anoint the word as it goes forth and touch the people lord lord we're a needy people lord we we need your guidance we need your counsel we need you in in numerous ways father and lord we just want to give you honor praise and glory for all you do for us lord we commit the remainder of this service into your hands in jesus name amen amen if you would turn in your bibles to psalms i'm going to look at just a little psalm here and and try to break it down and i tell you when it when it opened up to me the the psalms 27 is where we're gonna go and when i looked at psalms 27 i certainly didn't go in the didn't in my mind wasn't going to go the direction that we ended up going but as i began to look at it and opened up and the lord just really i feel like led me in a direction that i trusted it would be a blessing and a help to somebody just one person i know uh young when i was just young 20 in my 20s i got to spend some time with brother biscuit and one of the wisest things i think that was ever told to me especially from brother biscuit uh he said you know he said brother brad every time i step up to the pulpit and i go before the people he said always just say if i can help just if it'll help just one person it'll be worth it all and so i just trust this will be a help to you um i know your turn there just kind of get a thought of the direction i'm going i've got a little story here it's it's not really a comet comedy or a little comic but it is just a little story but there was a man that said to his friend he said i'm really in trouble he said i have a mountain of credit card debt i've lost my job my car is being repossessed my house is in foreclosure but i'm not worried about it he said how can that be he said well i've hired a professional warrior he does all the worrying for me and and his friend replied he's that's fantastic how much does this professional warrior cost you and he said it's fifty thousand dollars a year he says wow that's expensive where are you going to get that kind of money and the man replied and said i don't know that's for him to worry about so as we look at this scripture here psalms 27 i want to title this no worries because as believers as christians we truly shouldn't have worries we shouldn't be worried we shouldn't be nervous and anxious and and have fearful events so we want to break this down if we can psalms 27 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and foes came upon me to eat upon my flesh they stumbled and failed though in host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this i will be confident one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord god bless the reading of the word you can have your seats i'm going to continue reading just to finish up through the rest of this chapter but listen closely as we continue to go forward hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy upon me and answer me when thou saitest seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in anger thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of salvation when my father and mother forsake me the lord will take me up teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over unto the will of my enemies for false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord so the prophet said this and speaking about david as we get going now he says oh my look over there that day when the enemy was coming in on david and we and all david did was give him some wine and a piece of meat and bread and the enemy was coming he's talking about his own people the enemy was coming and he didn't know what to do he said he gathered up all the people of israel there and gathered him up and they lifted up their hands and said god you are our god you have protected us you have brought moses the prophet and you have brought the children of israel out of egypt you brought them through the desert he's identifying who they are and who god is so david here is putting himself in a place of saying god we know who you are we're not going to worry we're going to drink wine we're going to eat bread we're gonna eat meat the enemy's coming i'm not worried because i've seen what you've done in the past so here they sit there and they say you know we're the minority we're the minority in this but everybody that come upon them was afraid to touch them because david said he laid there and he said oh god how great you are we've sinned he admitted his faults we've sinned and here lays our children and our wives and we're coming before you crying out what can we do the enemy's coming so now they're sitting there and brother branham said as he was praying the spirit fell down there on the audience and he and someone prophesied and said thus saith the lord you'll not fight but you'll stand he said they'll go down there a certain way and god caused confusion upon all those soldiers that they just went and they killed themselves they never laid hand never laid sword never laid anything upon david or his people and brother brown said that is the predestinated chosen people of christ looking at the scriptures today and reading we're going to look at the life of david and no no doubt the life of david was a life filled with uncertainty it was a life filled even from a small child we're filled with situations full of fear and worry and anxiety that was the life that david come up through he had to overcome those challenges so how did it control his emotions how did he control the worry and and those anxious moments in life when he sat in there and the and the enemy is surrounding him whether it be a lion gonna take his his flock whether it be a bear whether it be a a giant that he has to that that he has to slay where there is this the army of saul coming after him to kill him how does he overcome these emotions how does the fear not take him down i could imagine myself that david would be an absolute nervous wreck put yourself in his shoes how would you feel how would you feel if you were constantly in a battle that everything you'd done was constantly a battle and you were having to fight your way through it not knowing what the true outcome would be but having to believe we're talking about lions bears giants we're talking about kings with armies what about when his own son came after him how would that make you feel how would your emotions rage then so the psalms 27 as we look at this we say that this is a cry for help this is a cry that david is putting forth and david is declaring his beliefs that in the greatness of god and he begins to trust in the protection that god provides in in psalms 27 they think it is written in the early part of david's life when he's in flight from king saul now to keep in mind that this psalm is written in two sections one through six and seven through fourteen one through six it declares the power of god and the boundless hope that god will bring rescue and protection from all enemies go back and read one through six and you'll see how that god is gonna provide over and over and over and that's what he's saying you are my light you're my salvation you're my healer you're everything i need 7 through 14 is the second portion after david has declared all this stuff now he's saying and i believe it i believe it it's more than just words on paper but now i believe it i know you are who you say you are brothers and sisters the devil loves to work on our emotions and the emotions of fear worry and anxiety those are three of the the devil's greatest weapons against the believer and i'm going to prove it to you before the days are and that's some of his greatest weapons you think about in the very beginning in the garden of eden there was adam and eve living in the garden of eden they're living in such peace and harmony and they're living in harmony with god and nature and they had complete control of their lives complete control of their lives if you remember brother brown said adam had the ability to move trees pluck up and go over here he could move mountains he could change the way the streams went he could add waterfalls he could do anything you want you're talking about a confidence and a complete control in his life but here come old satan so satan comes in there in adam's confident life that's in total control satan comes in and he gets involved and throws discord in the life of adam and eve so think about what happens now so now that satan's come and got involved instead of them having that sweet communion that sweet communion with god in the cool of the evening when they would come down and meet with god and they would say oh god it's so lovely we're so glad you came and that peace and that that stillness in the cool of the evening they no longer have that now adam and eve they find themselves hiding they find themselves in a place that they've never been before they find themselves in a hiding place and saying what the world's going on what is this emotion that we're feeling what was it it was fear it was fear because satan had come in and made discord amongst them so now they're in a place that they've never been before and these emotions are running through their bodies over and over and over and they are afraid their hearts are gripped completely with fear i can imagine that their heart rate began to pound they sweat probably started coming off their foreheads and they hear god crying adam where are thou adam where art thou and here they are tucked behind a bush and hiding behind fig leaves because of what's happened in their life they are scared they are scared of something that has never harmed them before you see us humans we it's a human response mechanism that we have built in this for fear and and it's called the fight or flight fight or flight so in this fight or flight there is a physical response that takes place when you perceive when you perceive that there is stressful situation or that something is frightening to you so it begins to kick in your nervous system now this is anatomy and physiology and you know i'm a nurse and i love this stuff and it's amazing to me that god puts this in people but it's there for a reason but this fight or flight kicks in and these responses kick in so that we can survive it's your survival mode it's what happens to soldiers when are on the battlefield fight or flight kicks in and all the things starts happening is is their heart rate begins to increase because their blood vessels have dilated getting blood to their muscle muscles their lungs increase in capacity because they die like the bronchial tubes dilate to take in more oxygen their eye your eyes dilate so that you can take in more light and you can visually see better all this is happening but what is it happening to your body all this is happening but now you get all this energy and you get full of nervousness and you get these endorphins running through your body epinephrine and and adrenaline we've all heard well he's running on adrenaline this is what fear can do to you and when you get in such a place that you begin to fear and you begin to have anxiety then you go into panic attacks this happens it happens king david here let's look a little bit more at his life and we're going to get on into this david had these same emotions he's a human being so no doubt he had to face these same challenges how do you think he felt when he seen that line there and he knew he was supposed to go by the hands of his body and pull this line off of his lamb i would say there was some adrenaline flowing i would say there was some fear there maybe a little bit of anxiety man what am i getting myself into but i can't sit there and watch him die that's how people can pick up cars off of children because that is our adrenaline that gets going in such a way that it pumps their body up david here this man he was the king of israel we know that and i like the life of david jesus himself is called the son of david david was born into a little family in the town of bethlehem in the tribe of judea judah and he was the great grandson of ruth i always find that amazing the lineage as it begins to come down ruth and boaz and he's the great-grandson of ruth the youngest of eight sons of jesse he's one of the most controversial figures in the old testament [Music] he wasn't an angel david's life was full of controversy david's life was full of such a public display of wrongness at times i mean he he blatantly had an adulterous act he stole another man's wife and then went and had that man killed so his life is full of controversy but one thing about it is david always gave particular attention to the matters of spiritual life he began to get so close to god in his spiritual life that he was known as a man who was after god's own heart terrible mistakes awful things but you know what david had he was teachable he was teachable you know this just comes to me you know i coach i coach baseball and help and you take you take you can take a team of kids and if they're teachable you can make some ball players out of them if they will listen and they will do what you tell them to do whether it's basketball baseball soccer hockey i don't care what it is if they are teachable if they will listen and do you can make something out of them but if not have you got your hands full brother jeff knows what i'm talking about this one's punching this one that's what's punching that one this one won't do this and this one's running here and running there and i gotta have water i'm hurt it's just cause it but if you get something that's teachable you can do something and david was teachable and david was humble david was always humble and he was quick to create correct his behaviors when he knew he had done something wrong when it was brought to his attention when the prophet come to him and said there was a man that took another man's wife what should we do to him well let's kill him but it was you oh mom i'm so sorry i didn't realize i didn't even find myself in that place but now that you've brought it to my attention i'm sorry i want to correct my behaviors he paid special attention to his conscience and he wanted to live connected to god so you sometimes we find ourselves in a place in our life to where we're probably not doing everything we should do or know to do anybody ever been there but i still want to be so connected to god that he can look through me look over my faults and forgive me for what i've done wrong so that i can rely and trust on him and the things that i need in my life that way i don't have to worry i don't have to have fear i will fix it god show me if i'm wrong tell me david's trouble started we know as a simple shepherd went on into his key as king hood where he was king king there and enemies pursuing him constantly you'll find a story in the book of samuel first and second samuel and he's the most mentioned man in the old testament the most mentioned man so he was a special kind of person david was a special kind of person but david says here in this psalm the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is my stronghold in life whom shall i be afraid so when he was in hiding from his enemies and fear was all around him david would talk to himself the greatest psalm a songwriter that's ever lived david would find himself into a calm and secret place in hiding and he would begin to talk to himself and then he would begin to pin his thoughts on whatever parchment he had you know they say sometimes you don't even know your true thoughts or emotions until you write them down and then you read them so write your thoughts keep a journal you'll find out who you really are good or bad you'll find out who you are so david then finds himself in a place and he begins to write and the conversation david has with himself is one that he shares with god and david says i'm in progress and i'm serving a god that i can talk to he's in communion with god david now begins to understand that god is my light he writes it my light and my salvation god is my light he who eliminates the dark path david spending time in caves he could realize that when you're living in complete darkness because you're hiding you need somebody to shed some light on your life so david begins to write that david also understands that god is his salvation he's not going to be saved by anybody during this perilous times but god one man can't fight off ten one man can't fight off a hundred not by yourself and david says he's my salvation i know he's the one that fights my battles why do i worry i know who i am i know who he is he's my salvation so why should i worry he'll fight my battles for me brothers and sisters we have to get that in our mindset that god fights our battles we don't fight our own battles i can't fight my own battles i'm not strong enough i'm not smart enough but god has the answer david says god is my stronghold we need a stronghold something that stands the test of time something that can that you can wrap your arms around and it doesn't move and psalms 99 says the lord is the refuge of the oppressed and the stronghold in the times of trouble why worry this is our very question we should ask ourselves of believers why do we have to be afraid what are we afraid of why do we have fear if we're like david like david said if we know who we're protected by and who we're sheltered by who is the greatest and the most powerful protector of all why do we fear why do we worry why do we let fear and anxiety rule in our lives i tell you what many times it's over insignificant things it's things that you can't control anyway and we stew and we worry and we fret and we cry sometimes for we don't even know why i know firsthand when i was in fourth grade i had such anxiety of leaving the house of leaving my parents to go to school i cried and i begged and i begged my parents to let me stay home daddy told me one time i'm gonna wear you out i said bring it on i'm not going you you can beat me do whatever you want i'm not going to school and i cried and i cried and i was so scared and they were like what are you scared of what are you afraid of is there somebody doing something to you no i got friends at school well what's going on is there a teacher that's been said something to you no i got the teachers like me what was it it was something right here that i felt like if that i wasn't in control and that something bad was going to happen i thought if i left my parents the first ambulance i heard well mom and dad was going to the hospital they've been in a wreck these thoughts go through your head and when these thoughts begin to go through your head and you stew on them that's when your fears begin to bring out the anxiety and that anxiety begins to kick into high gear and then you've got these endorphins going and you can't control it and nobody can control it you get into such a place you think i'm having a heart attack the panic begins to come your heart races you get the pressure on your chest it happened later in my life as well one other time that i can remember i was going through some some rough things and and so forth and it's just more than i told you i said you've got to get me to the doctor i'm dying of a heart attack nothing was wrong with my heart she said you don't have to slow down you don't have to quit worrying about stuff that you can't control as i got older i realized in life that there's a lot of things a lot of situations that we just don't have control over and that's when we trust in god now no doubt in life we've got areas of concern now concern is a little bit different than worry we're always concerned about others we're concerned about our family we're concerned about things things we should be prayerful about now as parents you've got to be careful because you let this concern begin to overwhelm and if you're not careful that concern goes into worry and then that goes on into fear and if you've got kids around 16 you know exactly what i'm talking about ours just got his driver's license yep that's right and he's a good driver i i taught him i even let him drive before he should just to get more time in you've been there you've done it so he goes that day we go up there and he's so happy he gets his driver's license and he's happy and you know i know what's coming next can i go to hop town and it's pouring down rain cats and dogs i mean it's just coming up looks like a monsoon and for some reason always comes to me to ask the questions instead of his mama i don't know if it's because he he knows i'll give in or she don't or what but he comes to me and i said yeah you can go and boy in my mind i'm thinking what am i saying how can i let this 16 year old on his first day of his driver's license head off 30 miles away driving 65 miles an hour and oh i forgot he's got to get on the parkway where he's going and he's never driven on the parkway i remember that when he was halfway there and i think man i hope he knows what exit to get off of i hope he knows where he how to get back on i hope he don't get on the wrong way so all these thoughts are going through your mind as a parent and joel has come she said did you tell him he could go to hop town yep i said you remember when you got your license you had to go everybody when you got your license what'd you do you had to go right i couldn't hold that back from him so what i had to tell myself is he's prepared for this he's driven he's practiced i have confidence that he will obey the speed limit i have confidence that he will look both ways twice before he pulls out god i put it in your hands i did my part i did my part now god it's your turn i got one even better when he decided he wanted to be a pilot he starts taking pilot's lessons this is all fine and good as long as he's with the instructor but then that day came when they said oh you're ready to go on your own 16 years old whoo of course let me tell you how that day went we get there it's on his birthday he won a solo on his uh 16th or 15th 16th right 16th birthday he wanted to solo so we get there it's april 15th of april and you know the weather can be anything the 15th of april well we had 15 and 18 20 mile an hour wind gust and he's uh taking taking flights around the airport around and around with the instructor in there and he's coming into practice landing and that thing is just it's going everywhere i mean the wind is blowing and it's up and down and i'm thinking oh my lord what about doing i thought to myself i thought well the instructor won't let him go unless he's ready now it's in your hands now it's in your hands was it easy no did he do it yes did god make a way yes god seen that he would bring him back home why worry why worry it's all it's life guys it's life it's what we live and because we're christians we can live another day because we know what god is and who god is we can make it through till tomorrow david said when the wicked advance upon me to eat my flesh they're going to tomboy and fall he knew what their purpose was they was going to kill him they was going to slay him and he said but that don't matter they're going to fall you're talking about confidence you're talking about confidence that david had so much confidence in god that he said i'm the target of all of these people they have all their swords their weapons are trained on me but when they come they'll fall that's confidence in god confidence in god and david says this one thing that i ask that i can only seek that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life remember he's a flawed man he's a flawed human being but he asked how i just want to live in the house of the lord all the days of my life to gaze upon your beauty to gaze upon your beauty and to seek you in your temple listen to what david says in four and five paraphrasing david didn't go ask for stuff and say lord you know i i could use a new chariot my horses get kind of old i could use a new team of horses no i've outgrown my palace i need a new palace no but he respected god for his beauty for the precious holy worthy life that god could provide him david knew a secret place a secret place that you have to find yourself in david had such a personal relationship with god that he gained confidence how did he get in that secret place troubles things that put him in such a place that he had to hide and write his thoughts and get sincere and dedicated and true with god and got in such a place that he could god through all my trials through all my running all of my fear and all of my worry you're beautiful you're beautiful god and sometimes i wonder if we don't take that far enough we are to admire god in his beauty we ought to ask god pull us up close to your bosom god pull us up and let me lay my head in your lap and just let you just stroke my brow lord do we ever get into a place do we get that sincere with god that we get into a place that we can allow god to have that kind of communion with us the kind of communion that adam and eve had in the garden of eden before the fall we're talking about a restoration of a bride right that's what this message is based upon a restoration of a bride we got to get into a place that we realize we are the bride and that he's the bridegroom and that god wants to he wants to stroke the brow of your head and tell you it's all right why worry [Music] even as a shepherd boy even as a shepherd boy there was a such a relationship between god and david that it allowed him to overcome the fear of the lion and the bear as a young man there was a relationship with god that when he faced that giant he looked at john in the eyes and said i'm gonna take these five stones f-a-i-t-h and i'm gonna overcome this uncircumcised philistine while all of israel laid down and cowed down and trembled in their boots at the thought of this giant and one young boy you're talking about some courage now that's some god-given courage right there what was it that gave david the courage to walk into the enemy's grounds and walk up to the to the man that wanted him dead more than anything in this world while he's sleeping and grab his coat and cut off a piece of coat tail just to throw it in the face later and say i could have killed you you're talking about courage you're talking about curse david had to overcome his fear fear anxiety worry they all create phobias i've got something here in my notes i want to backtrack to worry to give way to anxiety or unease listen to this definition webster knows more about it spiritually than sometimes we do to allow one's mind to dwell on difficult difficulty or troubles you have allowed your mind to dwell on difficulties or troubles anxiety the feeling of fear dread or uneasiness it might cause you to sweat feel restless or tense a rapid heartbeat for example you might feel anxious before facing a difficult problem at work or taking a test or an important decision and i like this one on fear it's an emotion induced by perceived danger perceived danger or threat and it causes physiological and psychological changes in behavior in the last one phobia phobia an extreme or irrational fear something that is unlikely to cause harm we hear different kinds of phobias one of probably the most common phobias is claustrophobia we all know what that is right fear of height spaces and that begins to grow in your mind let's look at phobias for just a minute it's a mind game the greatest battle ever fought was where and mine i was on a trip one time with some family and some friends and we went into a cave yep we went deep into this cave and we went way on deep we come to a place so so tight so small we had to get down our hands and knees and we were crawling on our hands and knees well then it got tighter and tighter and before i'm thinking it i'm on my belly and i'm just squirming through there as tight as i could and then all of a sudden i thought i can't stand up i can't stand up hey i got to get out of here they said turn off the lights quit thinking about it i got to get out of here i can't get i'm stuck i wasn't stuck but in my mind this fear and this phobia and the anxiety i probably did swell up quite a bit with the blood pumping through me at that time my heart was racing as fast as it could go and i think i've got to get out of this cave i've never been back in a cave and i have a hard time going under houses so when i built mine i built it on a slab that wasn't the reason why but phobias they begin to build out of fear claustrophobia arachnophobia spiders is that spider really going to hurt you no no that spider is not going to hurt you there's people that have uh hydrophobia they're afraid to even get in the water they won't take a shower they won't take a bath they're afraid that water is going to hurt them we're made of about 90 of water i don't think the water is going to hurt you but what is it it's something in their mind that has taken place in there and it's begun it fires up this fear and anxiety in their lives this fear and anxiety brothers and sisters you've got to be able to overcome worry fear anxiety it's detrimental to your health it's detrimental to you as a christian i've got some quotes that i just found astounding as i study on this and i typed in worrying and i typed in worrying i want you to listen to some of these how to do sister you believe with all your heart and a prayer line do you believe the lord jesus will make you well he says no we're perfect stranger aren't we she says he says i want to talk to you just a little bit i feel it shaking i feel it shaken he said now there's there's something conscious you're conscious of something near now aren't you there's something taking place he said that is the spirit of god you have a worrying about something immediately the spirit of god the holy ghost picked up on this worrying listen to a lot of prayer lines and you'll find this repetitive he picks up first on the nervousness the worrying the fear listen to what he says you're bothered and upset you're nervous for one thing you're real nervous aren't you a mental nervous causing you to have all kinds of funny feeling and so forth isn't that true it mainly works on you in the afternoon and late evenings when you get tired and run down listen to this next statement that has caused a trouble so in my mind if you're listening this message you're not paying attention you think he's fixing to pray for this woman for a nervous condition but he's not he says that's what has caused your trouble it's from the nervous condition i see your trouble you have a tumor it's from your nervous condition he says do you believe god's going to heal you she said yes he said receive your healer in the name of the lord listen to this one you've come here want to have you have you feel that there's something you're desiring to know about your condition you're nervous aren't you extremely nervous you've lost quite a bit of weight i see a lady standing before me much heavier than you so you've lost a lot of weight do you believe now you're all tightened up all the time you heard us saying you're wound tight you're nervous you're tense you're you're tight everything you're just man you just feel like oh i'm just i'm achy all over because i'm so nervous and wound up tight he said what it is you've put yourself in a strain you've put yourself in a strain and you've been in quite a strain anyhow he said you started worrying not long ago and he said you got you looked like something happened to you that just got you all tightened up he said that's just the devil trying to hinder you all this nervousness and tightness and worry has caused her to tighten up in such a way that this woman went to him prepared because she couldn't function in life listen to this extreme case here oh you're upset about something person comes right into the prayer line first thing he says you're upset about something you've got a distress you're nervous isn't that right it's a nerd isn't it a nervous condition you see you're always worrying rubbing your hands you've got in a habit of doing that and he said you're all excited you're all excited so the prophet the holy spirit picked up on those endorphins going through the adrenaline and he picked up on you're so excited you're rubbing your hands you're nervous you're worrying about stuff all the time and he said it's your own family isn't it your children has caused you trouble isn't that right extreme case here listen listen and hasn't your child tried to take your life now you know why she's wringing her hands while she's nervous she's worried she's coming to a place i got to figure out how to help my child my child is trying to kill me and he said and he gave you glass wasn't it put glass in her food or in her drink that had to be what he was talking about and he's tried to poison someone else too wasn't it she said yes and he said dear father be merciful to this woman and spare her her life the nervousness was going to take her life and spare her child the nervousness the nervousness you say well the holy spirit and brother branham is sensitive to that nervousness i'm going to show you the holy spirit anywhere is sensitive to nervousness brother branham's telling about the vision and the life story and he's talking about he slept all he fell off into that vision you know he was he was nervous he was about ready to take his own life and he falls off into this vision and he's sitting there and he said i began to i fell into a trance and i walked down along a prairie and he said i was walking with my hat on and i was whistling a song the wheel of the wagon is broken and he said i seen a little girl she said hello daddy and i said well hello lady i'm as old as you are why would you call me daddy she said daddy just don't know where you're at she said this is glory she said mother's waiting for you up there and so he's talking about the home paraphrase and she's telling him that your home is up there he says i don't have a home or vagabonds and she said well mother's waiting for you up at the home go up there because you're in glory and he said i went up and looked at that home and i see my wife coming she was a german black hair black eyes and she coming with her hands out reaching for me and so she took me by the hand and i knelt down and i i said hope i don't understand look how pretty sharon is listen to what she says back billy you're worrying too much about sharon and me she didn't say oh yeah billy it's just so glorious up here she's a young lady she look how beautiful she is no she said the first thing when he spoke to her the spirit spoke back and said no billy you're worrying too much about sharon and you're worrying too much about us we're all right don't worry about us the prophet of god the prophet of god in such a place that he's ready to take his life and the spirit has to put him into a vision into a trance and tell him don't worry you're my prophet it's all right they're here they're fine they're okay she says we're far better off than you are and he said then i just come into a room and it was dark and i felt her arm around me patting me and i heard her voice and i thought oh no it can't be it can't be the vision's over and he said i shook my head and i looked and her arm was still around me patting me and she said billy promise me you won't worry anymore that was her concern don't worry promise me you won't worry no more and i said i promise hope i promise and brother branham said she took her arm away and it was all over and he said i've never worried since he said i've never worried since because i can tell you i've anchored my faith in true god i've anchored myself in such a place that that i know that all the uh things are stacked against me that he is the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me will be there he said i know [Music] i've worried no more one more real quick you've heard the message letting off the pressure you've heard it or read it and numerous times i'm sure but listen to what he says if you've ever come to christ you can let off the pressure [Applause] if you've ever come to christ you can let off that pressure you can just settle down because it's over he said it's god's provided place of safety where you can say the name of the lord is a mighty tower and the righteous run into it in a time of sickness and the doctor says there's nothing nothing else i can do don't build up pressure now that's easy to say we're human beings and that's easy to say don't build up pressure when you don't know what tomorrow might hold when the doctors tell you there's nothing else i can do he says don't build up pressure let the pressure off how do you do that call your pastor he says call your pastor and let him anoint you in oil and pray over you the prayer of faith to save the sick and that lets off the pressure you say i wonder brother branham you don't wonder just let the pressure off commit your case to god as it was all over don't build up pressure let it go let the pressure go i'm so worried brother branham you say well i'm so worried brother branham i just don't know let off the pressure he keeps going on and on and on let off the pressure get into that city of refuge just like david see god don't change god seeks communion we had a communion service not a week or so ago we had a communion service and that is a time of communion that we take serious when we break the bread and we we break the fruit of the vine and we we commune with god but what's more than a monthly communion service god wants a communion on a daily basis not five minutes not ten minutes and i'm guilty as you are i promise but we have to learn to dedicate more time to god to dedicate more of our time on our knees and in a sweet communion with god so that we can find that refuge to let off the pressure and sister's pressure is coming we haven't seen pressure right you know we've we've had four pretty good years but pressure is coming the odds are stacked against you and i when you say i'm a christian a lot of odds are stacked against you when you say you're a believer all odds are stacked against you find that place of refuge let off the pressure brother branham said he met a woman here not long ago about in a 10 cent store she was about 60 years old and she said brother brandon i've got two sons it's doctors older than you and and she says he said well my goodness he said you don't look over 30 years old and she said what is it she said when i come to christ at about 20 years old i sat down and thought about it and i studied religions but when i found the true one and i come to christ it took he took my case i took my case my soul my all to him and i've never had a worry since 60 something years old and looked like a young woman because at 20 she gave her cares her burdens her life to christ she didn't have nothing to worry about why worry brother brown said christ promised that he take all your cares cast your cares on him so what are you worried about worry builds up pressure pressure blows up you say how do i do it just trust his promise just trust his promise how do you do it how do you make it through a day how do you handle all the pressures and the stress of job and economy and your business and and this and that and kids in school and how you handle all that just trust him just trust his promise he made a promise that he would do it even in a time of death when the death angel comes into the room he said oh brother branham i know i'll be nervous oh no you're in a refuge you're in a refuge remember he died for you brother branham you mean when the death angel is knocking at your door and you you still don't get all steamed up not a bit not a bit how do you do that i've come into the refuge i've come to the refuge brothers and sisters god is my shelter in a time of storm god is there for us when the storms of life come our way god is there for us why worry why worry when you're sick and you don't feel like you can get healing he's your healer why worry why do we worry when you feel like you're motherless he's a mother when you're fatherless he's a father why do worry why don't we worry when your friends all forsake you young people sometimes friends may walk away from you i've lost many friends but he's been a friend to me why worry why do i worry about what goes on in day-to-day life why because he's the bridge over troubled water why worry he's your rose of sharing he's the lily in your valley why worry i'm not telling you if you don't know this is scripture but we've got to know it here we've got to know when these times of trouble come and we have nothing that he's provided that he's your rock in a weary land that he's your lifter of your bowed head when you're crying and you're depressed and you're down why worry why worry he's the bread in a starving land he's the manna when there's no food to eat why are we worrying he's your hope of glory he's the will inside the will he's my savior he's my redeemer [Applause] that's my god do you know him why worry why worry as the musicians come why worry we can be honest there are times we're all prone to worry it's human nature but i'm thankful to know that when we worry over big things or we worry over little things there is someone who can make an anxiety makeover but there is a god who cares that there is a god who can manage our anxiety so that worry and fear and anxiety don't dominate our life so that worry and fear and anxiety don't take you into a place of mental depression or into a place of physical sickness we don't want to be those people standing in the prayer line and the spirit talks through through one of the preachers brother byler myself or any other preacher and says why are you so nervous i can sense nervous we need security we need a refuge first peter 5 7 if y'all just play something softly says cast all your cares upon him for he careth for you philippians 4 6-7 be careful for nothing be careful for nothing what's that saying don't worry don't care for the things this world don't worry about it don't worry be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be known to god and the peace of god which path this passage all understanding shall keep your minds and hearts through christ jesus god's good if you would just stand to your feet with me just bow your heads and close your eyes and let's just take a minute to find ourselves in communion with god find ourselves in a place of refuge find ourselves in a place that we could honestly say god i worry about stuff that doesn't matter i i hold on to things that i have no control over and i let these things burden my life i let i lose sleep over and there's not a thing in the world i can do about them god i need you to take away those thoughts those fears those anxieties maybe there's somebody here that that suffered with anxiety and panic and pressure i just want you to know god cares turn your you turn your anxiety over to god and when you feel those feelings coming on just lay there at god's feet say god calm my spirit control my body lord let me find peace and a refuge let me find shelter in the time of storm oh lord jesus you see the needs of your people lord [Music] lord jesus may we find that trust and confidence in you lord as david had that though enemies come about us they come to seek and destroy and devour us the devil's job is to kill steal and destroy but we fear that not there's no fear in that because god we know you we thank you for that lord we thank you for this day lord lord i just trust and believe and hope that it was a blessing and help to somebody i know it helped me lord i thank you for that lord thank you lord jesus in christ's name we pray amen brother david well i have found a friend in jesus
