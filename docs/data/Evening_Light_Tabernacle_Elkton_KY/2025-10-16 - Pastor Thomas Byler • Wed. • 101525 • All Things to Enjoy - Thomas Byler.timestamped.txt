[0:00] Songs of praise in this heart of mine.
[0:05] God is good
[0:08] all the time.
[0:10] [Music]
[0:12] Through the darkest night, his light
[0:16] will shine. God is good. Oh yes, he's so
[0:22] good
[0:24] all the time. One more time. Well, God
[0:28] is good
[0:31] all the time
[0:34] through the
[0:36] [Music]
[0:38] word of mine. God is good
[0:43] all the time
[0:46] and through the darkest time his light
[0:51] will shine. God is good.
[0:55] Oh, he's so good
[0:59] all the time. Amen.
[1:03] Amen.
[1:05] Amen. Don't you love him tonight? Amen.
[1:08] God bless you tonight. Turn around and
[1:10] look at your neighbor and say, "God
[1:11] bless you." And then you may be seated
[1:12] tonight. Amen. It's just good to be in
[1:15] the house of the Lord. And my, aren't
[1:18] you excited tonight what God has in
[1:21] store for us? Amen.
[1:24] Amen. I would not be denied tonight. And
[1:27] you know, I really didn't even know we'd
[1:28] be at church today.
[1:31] The devil tried to jump on Janet this
[1:33] morning. The cat comes scratching.
[1:36] First time she'd been on oxygen since
[1:38] she's been in the hospital. She wasn't
[1:40] doing good. We called the doctor. He
[1:42] said, "Just take her to the emergency
[1:43] room to the hospital."
[1:46] We prayed and the brothers began to pray
[1:48] and look back there on the back row
[1:50] tonight. She's here.
[1:54] Amen. And I, you know, and
[1:58] me and brother Steve Avery, we always
[2:00] text each other on Wednesday and Sunday,
[2:02] and I told him, I said, "I'm looking for
[2:04] a wonderful time in the Lord." But, you
[2:06] know, it's been a battle today, but
[2:07] guess what? We're not going to be denied
[2:09] tonight what God has for us. Amen. You
[2:12] want to put those words up? I forgot to
[2:14] There we go. Well, when pains of death
[2:18] seized on my soul, unto the Lord I cry.
[2:27] Well, till Jesus came and he made me
[2:33] whole. Where I would not be
[2:39] where I would not be day. Oh no. Well, I
[2:46] would not be denied.

[2:54] came and he made me whole. Well, I would
[3:00] not be denied.
[3:04] Well, as Jacob in the days of old will I
[3:11] wrestle
[3:13] with the Lord
[3:17] and in
[3:19] with a courage bold. Well, I stood up on
[3:26] his word.
[3:28] Well, I would not be denied.
[3:35] Oh, I would not be denied
[3:41] till Jesus
[3:43] came and he made me whole. Well, I would
[3:49] not be denied.
[3:54] Oh, Satan

[4:02] hear my prayer.
[4:06] But praise the Lord, the work is done
[4:12] and Christ the Lord is here. Amen. Well,

[12:18] [Music]
[12:32] &gt;&gt; If you were blind and then could see
[12:38] If you were bound and then set free,
[12:44] &gt;&gt; then you'd understand why Jesus means so
[12:50] much to me.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; If you were hurt and then were healed.
[12:59] If by his grace God was revealed,
[13:05] &gt;&gt; then you'd understand why he means so
[13:09] much to me.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; I love the Lord because he died for me
[13:22] on Calary.
[13:26] I love the Lord because his power set
[13:34] the sinner free.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Although I cannot comprehend,
[13:44] I know his love is without end.
[13:50] Now you understand why he means so much
[13:55] to me.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; If you were lost and then were found.
[14:05] If you were deaf and then hurt sound,
[14:11] then you'd understand why Jesus means so
[14:16] much to me.
[14:21] If you were dead and then felt lying.
[14:26] That's how it feels when you find
[14:30] Christ.
[14:32] Now you understand why he so much to me.
[14:39] [Music]
[14:41] I love the Lord because he died for me
[14:48] on Calvary.
[14:52] I love the Lord because his power set
[15:00] the sinner free.
[15:05] Although I cannot comprehend,
[15:10] I know his love is without him.
[15:16] Now you understand why you mean so much
[15:21] to me.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Now you understand why it means so much
[15:31] to me.
[15:36] [Music]
[15:38] Praise the Lord.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:44] Amen. You enjoy that song tonight.
[15:47] Amen. Now you know why he means so much
[15:49] to me. Amen. God bless you tonight.

[15:54] let's sing that song, The Goodness of
[15:56] God tonight if we could. And Amen. Don't
[16:00] you love him tonight?
[16:03] Amen.
[16:05] I love you
[16:10] for your mercy never fails me.
[16:16] And all my days
[16:19] I've been held in your hands.
[16:25] From the moment that I wake up
[16:30] until I lay my head.
[16:34] Oh, I will sing
[16:37] the goodness
[16:40] of God.
[16:41] [Music]
[16:45] All my life you have been faithful.
[16:51] [Music]
[16:54] All my life you have been so so good.
[17:02] With every breath that I am able,
[17:08] I will sing
[17:11] of the goodness
[17:13] of God.
[17:16] I love your voice.
[17:21] You have led me through the fire.
[17:26] In darkest night,
[17:29] you are close like no other.
[17:35] I've known you as a father.
[17:39] I've known you as a friend.
[17:43] And I have been in the goodness
[17:48] of God.
[17:54] And all my life, God bless you. You've
[17:56] been faithful.
[18:02] [Music]
[18:10] With every breath that I am able,
[18:16] I will sing
[18:18] of the goodness
[18:21] of God.
[18:22] [Music]
[18:24] Amen. Praise the Lord. What a nice song.
[18:28] Amen. Praise the Lord. I don't know who
[18:30] made who wrote that, but it was a very
[18:32] inspirational song. Good evening,
[18:35] everyone. Amen. God bless each one that
[18:38] was traveling. Glad to have everybody
[18:39] back again. Amen. And thank you
[18:42] musicians. That'll be all. Appreciate
[18:44] the music tonight. Amen.
[18:47] Amen.
[18:56] Getting that time of year when days are
[18:58] certainly getting shorter.
[19:00] Getting a little bit darker. Amen. It's
[19:03] bad, brother Troy. When you come to
[19:04] church and it's dark already, right?
[19:07] I know what that's like. Amen. In the
[19:10] middle of winter and we're going to
[19:11] church. We got over an hour drive and
[19:14] but it's dark already, you know. Amen.
[19:16] It can seem like a long night, but Amen.
[19:20] Praise the Lord. It's worth it though,
[19:21] right?
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, we
[19:24] greet you all in the name of the Lord
[19:25] and Amen. Trust God is good to you. And
[19:28] if y'all have need of anything, Amen.
[19:30] We're certainly here to help you in any
[19:32] way that we can. Amen. Let's just bow
[19:34] our head. Lord Jesus, we once again
[19:37] approach your throne of grace, Lord
[19:38] Jesus. So grateful to have a wonderful
[19:40] God like you, Lord. Father, we're just
[19:43] so thankful for what you did for us on
[19:45] Calvary, Lord, as Brother Steve and
[19:47] Sister Becky sang the song. Thank you
[19:48] for dying for us, Lord. Lord, and it
[19:51] helps, Lord, to understand just why we
[19:54] feel the way that we do about you, Lord.
[19:57] and we just desire God that you'll just
[19:58] bless the service tonight as I've been
[20:00] praying through the week and there was a
[20:02] certain direction that I was going and I
[20:05] just didn't seem to be able to really
[20:08] find the mind of the Lord on it and just
[20:10] prayed for something that you would give
[20:12] us and I feel like God you Lord you went
[20:16] a different direction and certainly in a
[20:18] different way but we just pray God that
[20:20] it'll be truly your mind Lord Jesus not
[20:23] myself but Father that you'll speak to
[20:25] your people the words, Father, that they
[20:27] need to hear tonight, God. And help us
[20:29] to go from here a better people than
[20:31] what we've come, Lord. Father, you've
[20:33] heard the different requests, Lord
[20:35] Jesus. Those who have needs, we know
[20:37] that you're more than able to meet it,
[20:38] Father. And we just pray that you'd give
[20:40] us the faith to receive everything that
[20:42] we have need of. Bless the reading of
[20:44] the word now, meditation of a heart.
[20:46] Help me to get out of the way and help
[20:48] the people to operate the gift tonight.
[20:50] Father, we just love you and commit
[20:51] ourselves to you now in Jesus name.
[20:53] Amen.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. didn't uh don't always really like
[20:57] to say this. It I think it puts y'all on
[20:59] guard a little bit whenever I tell you.
[21:01] Well, this is uh another first one.
[21:04] Amen. Amen. Kind of a first message that
[21:08] I really preached. Amen. On this. So,
[21:11] Amen. Um Amen. I trust be a blessing to
[21:14] you. I know I've preached many times on
[21:16] that while we preached on Sunday talking
[21:18] about blessing. Amen. Blessing. But I
[21:21] felt like the Lord had just given us
[21:22] something a little deeper. Even though
[21:23] it was something that we've ministered
[21:25] on before, but amen. If God's in it,
[21:28] Amen. It doesn't matter what it is, it's
[21:30] always good. Praise the Lord. So, if you
[21:34] will turn your Bibles tonight, we'll go
[21:36] begin um with First Timothy. First
[21:40] Timothy.
[21:47] Amen. Just a simple little thought.
[21:49] Amen. But
[21:52] anyway,
[21:55] 1 Timothy 6
[22:01] and verse 17.
[22:05] Amen.
[22:08] Half the congregation looks down and
[22:10] half the congregation looks up. So,
[22:13] Amen.
[22:14] Amen. 17. Charge them that are rich in
[22:18] this world, that they be not high-
[22:20] minded, nor trust in uncertain riches,
[22:24] but in the living God, who giveth us
[22:26] richly all things to enjoy. May God add
[22:30] his blessings to the reading of the
[22:31] word. You can be seated.
[22:35] Not a title tonight. You can put it up
[22:37] if you want to. My title tonight is all
[22:41] things to enjoy. Amen. I was going to
[22:45] just call it enjoy it.
[22:49] Enjoy it. Amen. But I thought it'd be
[22:51] more appropriate because it's straight
[22:53] out of the scriptures. All things to
[22:56] enjoy. Amen. Praise the Lord. How many
[22:59] believes that every part of the
[23:00] scripture is inspired.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; I believe this part is inspired.
[23:06] Amen. And so we want to speak on that
[23:10] with the help of the Lord for a little
[23:12] while. Amen. talking about enjoyment.
[23:16] Enjoyment.
[23:19] Amen. So God gave us everything so you
[23:21] could do what?
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Enjoy it.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, where I was raised,
[23:30] where I come from, they just
[23:32] everything's so hard, so cold, and you
[23:35] don't have much of a smile. You got to
[23:36] be staunch, you know, and uh you know,
[23:40] you you know, you just just don't find
[23:41] them smiling a lot.
[23:43] You know, you know, smile, a smile, I
[23:45] found out as I was studying, a smile is
[23:48] precious.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. Frowns come by pretty
[23:53] easy. It's easy to frown in the world
[23:55] that we're living in.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; When you find somebody with a smile,
[23:58] it's almost, whoa, what what what's
[24:01] that? What's he so happy about?
[24:03] Right? But he gives us all things,
[24:07] everything to enjoy.
[24:12] I thought I began to think about that.
[24:15] Amen. Now, I want to actually talk about
[24:19] enjoying and I'm going to tie that in
[24:22] with pleasure,
[24:24] having pleasure. And then we want to
[24:27] talk about joy. Amen. The other side is
[24:30] going to bring in a little bit of joy.
[24:32] Amen. And show you kind of the
[24:34] difference and how that we enjoy
[24:37] having joy. How many glad to have joy?
[24:40] Amen.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. Joy unspeakable and full
[24:43] of glory.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. First, I want to read Amen. And
[24:48] you know uh what I pulled up on the
[24:52] meaning
[24:54] of
[24:57] uh enjoy. The meaning of enjoy. Well,
[25:01] you know, I first when I thought about
[25:02] this, I says, "Boy, you sure don't need
[25:04] to pull that up. Everybody knows what it
[25:05] is what enjoy is." But I did anyway. And
[25:09] I thought it pulled something else up
[25:11] that I kind of want to use the word out
[25:13] of. And it says to enjoy means to
[25:17] experience pleasure
[25:21] and satisfaction from something.
[25:24] Amen.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Pleasure and satisfaction.
[25:31] Amen.
[25:33] Brother, how many know said in one place
[25:35] he said the world is pleasure mad.
[25:39] pleasure mad.
[25:43] Why do you think that Disney World and
[25:46] uh you know places of swimming and
[25:48] slides and uh you know these wheels and
[25:52] the I don't know they got all kinds of
[25:54] crazy stuff out there don't they to try
[25:57] to give people pleasure
[26:00] give them joy
[26:03] you know
[26:05] give them a thrill
[26:08] something to enjoy.
[26:12] Let me say this. If a person doesn't
[26:15] have God and doesn't know God, and the
[26:17] world is full of no joy,
[26:20] suffering, and agony,
[26:22] a lot of times they'll take a gun to
[26:24] their head or they'll jump off a bridge
[26:27] because life ain't worth living.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; So, I want to start out by saying that
[26:32] we need pleasure.
[26:34] We need enjoyment.
[26:38] You're eating really good or you're just
[26:40] quiet tonight, but
[26:43] That's right. Enjoy.
[26:46] That's right. Pleasure and satisfaction
[26:50] from something. To have the benefit of
[26:52] something. Amen. I like that. That too.
[26:56] Amen. The benefit of something or to
[27:01] have it as a condition. It can also mean
[27:04] to have a good time.
[27:06] Amen.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Woo. Praise the Lord.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many come to church to have a
[27:12] good time?
[27:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord. We come
[27:17] here to have a good time.
[27:21] And mama stopped there and bring back
[27:23] the thought brother Brandham. He was
[27:24] world dating a worldly girl and they
[27:27] went out there and they were smoking
[27:30] cigarettes. She tried to hand her him a
[27:31] cigarette. Ain't that right? Tried to
[27:33] get him to drink and he wanted to go to
[27:36] a dance and they says, "I don't dance. I
[27:38] don't smoke. I don't drink." things. You
[27:40] said, "Well, what do you do for fun?"
[27:43] &gt;&gt; Well, I like to go to church.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; How many's having a good time?
[27:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. We're having a good time.
[27:52] We're doing what we enjoy, Brother John.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; That's why we drive through the dark.
[27:58] That's why we come on Wednesday because
[28:00] we got something in our heart that has
[28:02] given us joy and we enjoy having joy.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But brother B said we can't wait
[28:10] for the doors to open. Apparently not
[28:12] everybody wanted to come tonight.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't enjoy church enough.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[28:22] Apparently not. There's something else
[28:24] you enjoy more.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Or you'd be here.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And what do you
[28:38] think we're going to do when we go over
[28:39] there to the other side?
[28:42] &gt;&gt; We're going to enjoy ourselves.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a lot of fun. We're
[28:48] going to let the glory roll when the
[28:49] roll is called in glory.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; We're going to have the time of our
[28:53] life.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what it said? That's right.
[28:57] It means that you are having a good
[29:01] time. We're having a great time.
[29:06] I thought, boy, this is a Wednesday
[29:08] night. Everybody going to be tired.
[29:09] Ain't nobody going to feel like really
[29:10] having a good time tonight.
[29:15] But we preach Sunday. Ain't that right?
[29:16] If you really got God on the inside, it
[29:19] don't matter if it's Monday, Tuesday,
[29:20] Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
[29:21] whatever. You ain't got to get in here
[29:23] to get built up. No, you come in here
[29:26] built up.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, let's not
[29:29] preach that again. Hallelujah.
[29:33] That's good, isn't it?
[29:35] Oh, I like that meaning main meaning of
[29:38] enjoy is to experience pleasure.
[29:45] This is the most common meaning as in I
[29:48] enjoy reading books or we enjoyed our
[29:51] vacation. How many know there's a lot of
[29:54] people that like enjoyment?
[29:58] &gt;&gt; People do all kinds of things for
[30:01] enjoyment.
[30:04] Amen. They like to have pleasure.
[30:07] Enjoyment is to have pleasure.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Bible says that in the last days people
[30:15] will be lovers of pleasure more than
[30:17] lovers of God.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; But I wrote underneath there he says our
[30:22] pleasure is loving God.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Our pleasure is loving
[30:29] God. That's what our pleasure is.
[30:37] Amen.
[30:40] All right, let's talk about joy for a
[30:41] minute.
[30:43] Amen.
[30:45] Joy
[30:49] in the Bible. Joy is a deepseated
[30:54] inner gladness
[30:57] and state of being that comes from
[30:59] trusting God even amidst hardship
[31:03] rather than being dependent upon
[31:05] circumstances.
[31:06] It is considered a fruit of the spirit
[31:08] and can be expressed through praise,
[31:12] worship, and rejoicing.
[31:16] Amen. How many know a lot of times
[31:18] there's a lot of rejoicing that happens
[31:20] when you're having a good time
[31:22] &gt;&gt; and when you're having pleasure
[31:25] and rejoicing in God's promises and
[31:28] salvation. Biblical joy is a distinct
[31:31] concept from fleeting happiness
[31:35] such as is often based upon worldly
[31:37] circumstances.
[31:39] Source of joy. The ultimate source of
[31:42] joy is God himself.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:51] Not external factors. It stems from
[31:54] relationship with Jesus Christ and the
[31:56] security of one's salvation. Romans
[32:00] 14:17 says, "For the kingdom of God is
[32:03] not meat and drink, but it's
[32:06] righteousness, peace, and joy in the
[32:10] Holy Ghost." How many believe that's the
[32:12] kingdom that you and I are in?
[32:15] &gt;&gt; It's something that we all crave.
[32:20] It's something that we all thirst for.
[32:22] Everybody wants joy.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants happiness. Everybody
[32:27] wants to have a good time. Everybody
[32:29] wants to have pleasure.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; It's in us.
[32:35] Amen.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; I don't have it paged. I wish I would.
[32:42] Now I got to go find it.
[32:47] Amen. Talk about pleasure.
[32:51] Talk about
[32:53] enjoy. God tells us that he gave us
[32:56] everything so that we could enjoy it. So
[32:59] God wants you to have everything that he
[33:02] gives you. He wants you to enjoy it.
[33:07] And I'm thankful I'm thankful that
[33:10] enjoyment isn't just for
[33:14] Amen. the good times
[33:18] &gt;&gt; are the good things.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; It's also for the bad.
[33:26] You know, you can have pleasure in the
[33:28] bad stuff,
[33:31] pleasure
[33:33] in the bad stuff. All right, let me
[33:36] finish this verse.
[33:38] Now, talk about pleasure. Notice this.
[33:41] As we say, talk about tying enjoyment in
[33:44] with pleasure.
[33:46] In Revelations 4 and 11, it says, "Thou
[33:50] art worthy, oh Lord, to receive glory
[33:53] and honor and power, for thou has
[33:56] created all things and for thy
[34:01] &gt;&gt; pleasure."
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Pleasure.
[34:04] Enjoyment.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; For his enjoyment. He did it for his
[34:08] enjoyment. You think that God wants us
[34:10] to go through life depressed,
[34:13] downhearted?
[34:16] with the blues.
[34:19] That's what like the prophet of God
[34:20] said. He don't believe that a a you know
[34:22] a Christian is tossed about. Amen. That
[34:25] he's got the blues and everything else.
[34:27] No. A Christian God wants you to be
[34:30] happy. He wants you to enjoy things.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Sure he does. really in in in a way, you
[34:39] know, when I got to thinking about this
[34:41] and that title, it ought to attract we
[34:43] ought to have at least 10 or two hits on
[34:45] this one.
[34:48] Enjoying all things. Hey, everybody,
[34:50] they going to click on that. You know,
[34:54] click on that. You know, I like to enjoy
[34:56] all things.
[34:58] Amen.
[35:00] Well, just listen a while. We'll see if
[35:02] you like it or not.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:07] That's right. Amen. Please place. Praise
[35:10] the Lord. All right. Got a got quite a
[35:13] few things here. I want to talk about
[35:14] our happy. Have you ever heard of your
[35:16] happy thought?
[35:17] Your happy place. You know, get your
[35:20] mind channeled somewhere and something
[35:22] good and something happy.
[35:24] [Music]
[35:27] Well, the Bible does talk about he says
[35:28] whatsoever things are good, report
[35:31] whatsoever things are, think on these
[35:32] things. How many believe you and I, I
[35:35] don't know about you, but we got a happy
[35:36] thought. We got a happy place we can go
[35:38] to.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; We sure do.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; I'm jumping around here now.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; All right. That's right. We'll get into
[35:47] that in a minute.
[35:49] The ultimate source of God's joy is God
[35:52] himself, not external factors. It stems
[35:55] from relationship with Jesus Christ and
[35:58] the security of one's salvation.
[36:02] Amen. Why? Cuz all those people, they go
[36:05] out there and they have a good time.
[36:07] They enjoy themselves, but it's a
[36:10] temporary enjoyment.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even at bars, the people come up
[36:16] there and they want to give you a drink
[36:18] and they'll say, "What's your pleasure?"
[36:20] Ain't that right? Well, tonight I want
[36:23] to ask the world. I want to ask you,
[36:25] "What is your pleasure?" In other words,
[36:28] what do you do for pleasure?
[36:33] cuz you're going to do something for
[36:34] pleasure.
[36:36] Ain't nobody that don't like to have
[36:38] some kind of pleasure, some kind of
[36:39] enjoyment.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; I don't know, brother Sean. Some people
[36:45] are just so sad and blue dear. They hate
[36:46] when anybody else smiles or is happy.
[36:48] They don't want you to be happy.
[36:54] I'm the kind of people I try to get away
[36:56] from.
[37:00] I got to go, man.
[37:04] That's right.
[37:05] Praise the Lord.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:12] All right.
[37:16] Another one.
[37:18] So, a state of being, it is described as
[37:21] a state of being that is constant. This
[37:25] joy is constant
[37:31] rather than a fleeting feeling.
[37:36] Amen.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Didn't David even say, "The joy of the
[37:41] Lord is my strength."
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:50] We really getting down if we're going to
[37:52] sing the song.
[37:54] He fills my heart with laughter.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[38:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, we ain't started yet. Y'all ready
[38:07] tonight? Y'all want to have church? We
[38:09] We'll have church.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:13] This is a fresh one. I like it fresh.
[38:17] Praise the Lord.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now notice it's constant rather
[38:24] than a fleeting feeling like happiness.
[38:27] Despite circumstances, biblical joy is
[38:30] possible
[38:32] even during times of sorrow or
[38:35] suffering.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[38:41] &gt;&gt; All right, we might as well preach. Paul
[38:43] said
[38:45] in 2 Corinthians 12 and verse 7, "An
[38:49] least I should be exalted above measure
[38:51] through the abundance of revelations,
[38:53] there was given unto me a thorn in the
[38:55] flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet
[38:57] me. Least I should be exalted above
[39:00] measure." In other words, he'd get so
[39:02] high on it
[39:04] way up there somewhere, God allowed a
[39:06] thorn in his flesh to keep him down.
[39:12] I bought these things of the Lord thrice
[39:14] that he might depart. And he said to me,
[39:16] "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my
[39:18] strength is made perfect in weakness.
[39:20] Most gladly, therefore, will I glory in
[39:22] mine infirmities, that the power of
[39:25] Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I
[39:28] take pleasure,
[39:32] Paul. I take pleasure. I enjoy.
[39:44] I know that's a little hard to sink in,
[39:46] ain't it? A little hard to fathom that
[39:50] somebody could enjoy
[39:52] infirmities.
[39:57] Well, you take it what you want. He
[39:59] called it pleasure. All right.
[40:02] Sounds like enjoyment to me.
[40:06] pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches,
[40:09] in necessities, in persecutions, in
[40:12] distresses for Christ's sake.
[40:15] And here comes the punchline, folks.
[40:17] Here is what make Paul happy about the
[40:20] whole thing.
[40:22] He said, "Because for when I am weak,
[40:25] then I am truly strong." How many know
[40:28] that when you are weak,
[40:31] he becomes strong?
[40:33] My strength is made perfect in weakness.
[40:36] If you'd never have cancer, if you'd
[40:38] never get downhearted, you would never
[40:40] enjoy the good time. You couldn't call
[40:42] upon God and say, "God, deliver me out
[40:45] of this." And when he does, can you
[40:47] imagine David when he killed Goliath
[40:50] afterwards? He must have had a dance
[40:52] party. W It was a trial. Sure, it was
[40:55] hard. Amen. And I had to have faith. But
[40:57] guess what? Now look, it's God that
[41:00] does. It strengthens you.
[41:03] That's where his fun was in seeing God
[41:06] work.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Evening light
[41:09] tabernacle. Our pleasure is in seeing
[41:12] God come. Amen. And change our
[41:14] situations.
[41:15] That's why we're happy. That's why we
[41:17] have joy in the midst of trials.
[41:20] The Christian, brother Bram said, is to
[41:22] conduct himself with joy amidst the
[41:25] trials that God allows that come his
[41:27] way.
[41:33] I love that revelation right there.
[41:39] [Music]
[41:52] Isn't it something that God has so fixed
[41:55] it
[41:56] that we can
[41:58] have joy unspeakable and full of glory?
[42:01] We can have our mountaintop experiences.
[42:04] And then we can have our terrible times.
[42:08] We can have our times of trial, times of
[42:11] rainfall,
[42:13] times of trouble. But how many knows
[42:16] that your trials, brother Bam says,
[42:18] sometimes we pray for comfort and peace
[42:20] and God sends us trial does the best
[42:22] thing that he can. Send us a trial. Why?
[42:25] Because that's where God shows that he's
[42:28] with you, that he loves you, and it
[42:30] makes you stronger. Even our trials make
[42:33] us stronger
[42:35] &gt;&gt; if we allow them.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; If we allow them to,
[42:42] it'll make you even happier.
[42:46] Amen.
[42:48] Even happier.
[42:50] even give you more joy
[42:52] because the joy of the Lord goes deeper
[42:55] than just a temporary feeling,
[42:59] &gt;&gt; a worldly happiness,
[43:02] &gt;&gt; a good oldfashioned mud bogging with big
[43:05] old trucks spitting that mud up and
[43:07] everybody
[43:09] hello. Next day, you know, all they're
[43:12] drinking and all they're getting drunk.
[43:15] Next day they have a big old hangover.
[43:18] We come to church and we we have a good
[43:21] time and we have a hangover. I was wear
[43:23] I was thinking on the church even the
[43:25] believer has hangovers.
[43:29] That's right. I like my hangover,
[43:31] brother John. I love my hangover because
[43:33] I'm telling you what, the Holy Spirit
[43:35] just comes and he encumbers us here on a
[43:37] Wednesday night. He comes down upon us.
[43:41] Ain't that right? And we get drunk in
[43:42] their spirit. We act funny a little bit.
[43:45] Amen. And then the next morning, guess
[43:47] what? Amen. He's still hanging over me.
[43:50] He's still hanging over me. I feel as
[43:53] good the next morning as I did on
[43:55] Wednesday night. Woo!
[43:58] I love my hangover.
[44:03] Woo! That's right.
[44:06] Make old man jump up and kick his heels
[44:08] together. Why? We got something to have
[44:11] be happy about.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; We got real joy. If you want joy, real
[44:16] joy, wonderful joy, let Jesus come into
[44:19] your heart.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Get more of Jesus.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; That's why we think of our business and
[44:28] our work.
[44:31] Oh well, if my bank account has $20,000
[44:36] in it, I'm a pretty happy camper. You
[44:39] might have joy cuz you got money in the
[44:41] bank. Maybe your retirement fund is up
[44:44] to $500,000.
[44:46] Woo! You feel pretty good. Well, guess
[44:49] what? That Bible says that riches grows
[44:52] wings and flies away. Amen. But I want
[44:55] you to know that's not lasting joy. We
[44:58] don't look at our bank account. We don't
[45:00] look at this, that, or the other. We
[45:02] look at what God said. When Job when he
[45:05] was in a bad shape, Amen. all down on
[45:08] the ash heap. God, man. He begin to say,
[45:10] "Who who uh set the foundations of the
[45:14] world? Who put the cornerstone out
[45:16] there? Who set it there?" He says,
[45:18] "Where was you, Job?" Amen. When the
[45:20] morning stars sang together, and the
[45:23] sons of God shot it for joy. Amen. He
[45:25] tried to get him in the right thought.
[45:28] Whatsoever things are good, whatsoever
[45:29] everything to love you a good report.
[45:31] Think about God and I'll bring you joy.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; That's our happy thought.
[45:42] Amen.
[45:45] What are we going to do when we get over
[45:47] there?
[45:51] &gt;&gt; We're going to sit there.
[45:59] Hallelujah.
[46:04] Hallelujah.
[46:06] Yeah. For a thousand years. Why? Because
[46:11] that joy will never fade.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; And it's constant.
[46:18] It's forever.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Has anybody got anything to be happy
[46:23] about?
[46:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. Think about it. You got a
[46:28] lot to be happy about.
[46:31] I'm going to sit there under evergreen.
[46:33] I'm going to think, "Thank you, Lord.
[46:36] Thank you, Lord, that you thought of me
[46:37] before the foundation of the world.
[46:39] Thank you for your grace. Thank you for
[46:41] saving me. Thank you for saving me. It's
[46:45] amazing grace how sweet the sound that
[46:47] saved the rest like me. Amen. You can
[46:49] have all the deep revelations you want
[46:50] to. I just be glad to know that I'm a
[46:52] son of God and I made it to heaven and
[46:55] I'm there as his child.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[47:02] We get too complicated. go back to the
[47:04] simplicity of things. Thank you for
[47:06] Calvary. Thank you for what he did for
[47:09] me, for dying for me.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:14] Praise the Lord.
[47:21] He said that you jo enjoy. Well, imagine
[47:25] how long we would be, Brother Brad, if
[47:26] we just really start writing down all
[47:28] things.
[47:31] Whenever I begin to think about he gave
[47:33] all things.
[47:36] Amen.
[47:38] For you
[47:40] to enjoy
[47:44] Romans.
[47:46] No Corinthians.
[47:50] Ah, come on. Now,
[47:54] this is the nice part. If you could just
[47:55] scroll it down, brother Brad, I wouldn't
[47:57] have to go looking for it.
[48:04] All right, let me look see where it's
[48:06] at.
[48:10] When I begin to think about
[48:12] all things, there it is. It's just not
[48:15] on that side of the page where I usually
[48:17] look new Bibles. I like to keep the same
[48:19] Bible so that I know it's down in that
[48:21] corner up there. So, I mean, I think the
[48:24] other day at Walmart, I bought about
[48:25] four of them because I wear them out a
[48:28] lot. So you got to have about four of
[48:29] them the same kind. Listen, let no man
[48:32] therefore glory in men, for all things
[48:35] are yours.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you we're pretty quiet
[48:42] for having been just told that
[48:43] everything's yours.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Yeah. The Bible don't
[48:52] lie. Everything is yours.
[48:56] He says, "Whether Paul or Apollos or
[48:58] Cphus or the world,
[49:02] how many believe the world is ours?"
[49:04] That's right. All of you sinners, all of
[49:07] that, this is not their world. This is
[49:10] theirs now. They're allowed to say
[49:12] they're squatters,
[49:14] but this is our world.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:24] Praise God. Whether the world or life,
[49:29] how many believe life is yours?
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Or death.
[49:35] Death is yours.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Or things present
[49:41] or things to come. All are yours and you
[49:46] are Christ.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; How many I don't like that last part.
[49:50] How many glad that you belong to Christ
[49:54] &gt;&gt; and you're a joined heir of everything
[49:56] he gets. You're a joined heir.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Just like a wife, she has everything the
[50:01] husband has.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Everything is yours.
[50:06] All things.
[50:08] Praise be to God.
[50:11] Amen. So why shouldn't we have joy in
[50:13] our hearts? Amen.
[50:19] In Psalms
[50:21] 16 and verse 11 it says, "Thou
[50:24] wilt show me the path of life in thy
[50:28] presence is fullness of joy."
[50:33] &gt;&gt; How many loves
[50:35] just to worship the Lord, come to
[50:39] church, hear the word of God, sing those
[50:42] songs, bathe in his presence.
[50:46] That's why I know
[50:49] maybe we should more, but just after
[50:50] church, you know, we just dart out of
[50:52] here. Maybe sometimes we linger a little
[50:54] bit.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Just bask in his presence.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Bask in it. Amen.
[51:01] Listen. In his presence is fullness of
[51:03] joy. At thy r right hand are pleasures
[51:08] forever more. How many knows that being
[51:11] with God is a real pleasure? We take
[51:14] pleasure in the presence of Almighty
[51:17] God. There's so many pleasures.
[51:20] Amen. In Christ.
[51:23] Praise the Lord.
[51:25] Amen.
[51:38] It is so satisfying. People will do just
[51:42] about anything
[51:45] for that pleasure.
[51:47] Is that right?
[51:50] Why do you think that they get wicked
[51:53] and wicked and wicer? Because what they
[51:55] did do doesn't satisfy them anymore.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Doesn't give them pleasure anymore.
[52:01] Brother Brandon been preaching said the
[52:03] women had become so common to man that
[52:05] ma man left man and went with man.
[52:08] had become so common.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Hello. They had become so wicked. Ain't
[52:13] that right?
[52:15] &gt;&gt; And now look at where it's at.
[52:18] Gotten even worse. There's no end. Why?
[52:21] Because they can never find what they're
[52:24] looking for.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; They'll never find that joy that you
[52:27] have.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That true enjoyment,
[52:34] the real pleasure
[52:37] that comes
[52:39] with
[52:42] knowing that
[52:44] your sins are gone.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; How many believes that it's a real
[52:50] pleasure to know that you've been
[52:52] forgiven of your sins?
[52:55] It's a real pleasure to know that you've
[52:57] been justified,
[52:59] &gt;&gt; that you're righteous before God. The
[53:01] real pleasure that we have, the real
[53:02] enjoyment
[53:04] that we have is our fellowship with
[53:06] Almighty God on a daily basis,
[53:09] &gt;&gt; whether you're at home or whether you're
[53:10] at work or wherever you are.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, brother Brian
[53:15] commotes it every time he comes up here,
[53:16] but you got to have that personal
[53:18] relationship with God, that personal
[53:20] walk with God. There's nothing in the
[53:22] world like it. If you don't have that,
[53:27] get it. I don't care if you got to stay
[53:29] in a corn field. You're half starved.
[53:32] Maybe all the way. Go right to the point
[53:34] of death. Like old Buddy Robinson said,
[53:36] "God, if you don't give me the Holy
[53:38] Ghost, you're going to come back and
[53:39] find a pile of bones in this place." He
[53:42] got desperate about it and God come on
[53:43] the scene.
[53:45] Amen.
[53:50] The world wants pleasure. They do. And
[53:52] everything they do, they do because of
[53:54] that thirsting that's in their heart.
[53:57] How many is enjoying
[54:00] having that thirst quenched?
[54:02] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I'm glad
[54:03] that God come and quenched that thirst
[54:06] in my soul. He said, "You drink this
[54:08] water, you'll never thirst again. Eat
[54:11] this food and you'll never hunger
[54:12] again." I thank God I am enjoying
[54:15] the fact that we've eating a food that
[54:18] fills that satisfy. I don't have to have
[54:21] another nose ring. I don't have look
[54:23] like some bull walking around running
[54:25] around with a nose ring. Hello. Or my
[54:28] earrings. Or I don't. No. I'm happy. I
[54:30] mean, he's happy.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. I I'm glad. I I I enjoy my
[54:34] life because he's in control. That's the
[54:37] only way you'll ever really enjoy life
[54:39] is if he's in control.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like to hunt. I like to fish.
[54:43] Amen. Some people get their enjoyment
[54:45] out of uh NASCAR. They get it out of uh
[54:48] Disney World. They get it out of
[54:50] hunting. You know, there's a sign that
[54:51] says, "And you know, I've hunted almost
[54:53] every day of my life. They love it.
[54:55] That's their pleasure. And every other
[54:56] day has been wasted."
[55:01] That's a fanatic, ain't it? It's a
[55:03] little bit overboard. Hello. But I'm
[55:04] here to tell you, Amen. Every day that
[55:07] you don't spend with God is wasted.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And fellowshipping with God,
[55:11] that's a waste of time. Amen. All of
[55:13] those things will never satisfy.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; They'll never give you real enjoyment.
[55:19] They never give you true joy.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:30] The sinner,
[55:32] he wants to enjoy things. But Bam says
[55:35] in enticing spirits, the church comes in
[55:38] and adopts other things. They have to
[55:40] have a little party where they can all
[55:42] lay in the beach for recreation or a
[55:45] little enjoyment. How many knows they
[55:47] even go on the beaches for enjoyment,
[55:49] &gt;&gt; for pleasure?
[55:52] They think maybe they get a little peace
[55:53] out there looking at the sunset. How
[55:55] many knows looking at the sunset's not
[55:58] going to give you any peace?
[56:01] No. Drinking a beer or dope or whatever,
[56:04] it's not going to give you any peace.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; No. A card party to get together, even a
[56:12] church for fellowship. That's right.
[56:13] Have to dance somewhere. one another the
[56:16] member's house sometimes maybe even the
[56:18] church basement a dance adopting trying
[56:21] to get something to satisfy what's the
[56:23] matter he says they're a bunch of pigs
[56:26] anyway
[56:28] they're pigs to begin with he says if
[56:31] ever they come in contact with Christ
[56:34] they'd have so much joy those things
[56:37] would be dead than midnight to them
[56:40] &gt;&gt; gospel drunk on the spirit amen joy
[56:43] unspeakable
[56:45] and full of glory.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; If your joy isn't contagious, then you
[56:50] ain't got enough.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] Don't condemn the sinner. Have mercy on
[57:00] him. Let him go ahead and smoke his
[57:02] pipe. Let him drink his liquor. Let him
[57:04] have his car parties. That's his
[57:07] pleasure. Don't blame him coming home
[57:10] and everything tired and wore out. He
[57:12] wants some pleasure.
[57:16] Isn't that right? Everybody wants some
[57:18] pleasure. Everybody wants enjoyment.
[57:24] But the thing for you to do is to live
[57:27] such a godly life that you can prove to
[57:29] him that the gospel holds 10,000 times
[57:33] more than that for him.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; How many believes that? Amen. Let him
[57:38] know there's something so much greater
[57:40] than that. Amen.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Than what they have.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:47] My Then he goes to say and if he dies in
[57:50] that state, he'll go under a devil's
[57:52] intoxication
[57:54] dragging that old pipe. God's his judge.
[57:56] Amen. But there's one thing. If you die
[57:59] under the anointing power of the Holy
[58:00] Ghost, like Steven did when he looked up
[58:02] in the face of God said, "I see the
[58:04] heavens open and Jesus standing at the
[58:05] right hand of God." You're a heavenbound
[58:08] bird. Amen.
[58:15] One more.
[58:18] I like this one.
[58:23] An old
[58:24] famous one.
[58:27] You'll know where I'm going in a minute.
[58:29] Have you ever noticed how the world gets
[58:31] into the spirit of things of the world?
[58:34] They go to their ball games, their
[58:36] sporting events, their dances, and enter
[58:38] into the spirit of it. They don't sit
[58:40] there like wall flowers.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Hello. Old dried up sticks.
[58:50] They ready right into the feel of
[58:51] things. Amen. And become part of things.
[58:54] But oh, they hate the Christian for
[58:56] getting in the spirit of God's word.
[58:59] Amen. How many believe that we get in
[59:01] the spirit of God's word?
[59:04] &gt;&gt; They call us fanatics and holy rollers.
[59:06] They call us crazy.
[59:09] Amen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; After the way that they call hair or
[59:12] heresy, so worshiped by the God of my
[59:15] father.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Think about it. They want to call
[59:19] you crazy.
[59:24] Amen.
[59:28] Matthew 5, I believe it is.
[59:32] Blessed are they which are persecuted
[59:34] for righteousness sake, for theirs is
[59:37] the kingdom of heaven.
[59:39] Amen.
[59:42] Blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[59:45] and persecute you and say all manner of
[59:47] evil against you falsely for my sake.
[59:51] Rejoice.
[59:53] Woo.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; What's Let me hear what rejoicing sounds
[59:57] like. Yeah.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Woo. Yeah.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Okay. Rejoice
[1:00:11] and be exceeding
[1:00:15] glad.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Be exceeding glad when they call you
[1:00:22] oldfashioned.
[1:00:24] Amen. Why? Because you're worthy.
[1:00:26] Remember when Peter them were beaten and
[1:00:28] everything else and persecuted, they
[1:00:30] went out there and they rejoiced.
[1:00:33] They were happy because they were found
[1:00:35] worthy to suffer for the cross. They
[1:00:38] were having a good time. They were
[1:00:40] enjoying. That was their pleasure.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; That was to suffer for Christ.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:48] Be exceedingly glad. Rejoice and be
[1:00:51] exceedingly glad when they make fun of
[1:00:53] you. Amen.
[1:00:57] Call me crazy if you want to. I'm not
[1:01:00] the one with pink hair and nose rings
[1:01:02] and look like a freak.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:08] Boy, it's just terrible out there, isn't
[1:01:11] it?
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know where I was today for sure.
[1:01:13] I guess it was Menard or something. And
[1:01:16] you know, there there you are in line.
[1:01:18] There's a woman right in front of you
[1:01:19] with these little bitty old shorts on.
[1:01:21] And I says, you know, that's a perfect
[1:01:22] that's her underwear.
[1:01:24] Where where's your skirt?
[1:01:27] I thought, boy, you really want to say,
[1:01:28] "Hey, lady, you forgot your skirt."
[1:01:33] Didn't have the nerve. Y'all forgive me.
[1:01:37] [Applause]
[1:01:41] But that's the truth, ain't it? That's
[1:01:42] the world we're living in.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; People go out there and don't realize
[1:01:46] they completely forgot to get dressed
[1:01:50] everywhere, too, isn't it? You thought
[1:01:51] it was bad when Brother Brandon was
[1:01:53] here. Look at it right out now.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:57] That's right. Our sisters wears those
[1:02:00] tights maybe in sports and so forth and
[1:02:02] that's good. But Lord of mercy, I
[1:02:05] probably should have already a time or
[1:02:07] two had to talk with somebody come in
[1:02:09] here in tights.
[1:02:12] Hello. At least our sisters wear their
[1:02:15] skirts. Praise the Lord.
[1:02:18] All right. Well, that wasn't in the
[1:02:19] script, so I don't know. That's just the
[1:02:22] world we're living in. Aren't you glad
[1:02:23] that Hey, if they've called you
[1:02:24] oldfashioned, Peter and they were
[1:02:27] beaten.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul when he was talking about his
[1:02:30] I was thrice was I beaten with rods.
[1:02:33] Amen. A shipwreck. How many knows? Paul
[1:02:35] said when I was in a shipwreck. Amen.
[1:02:37] Fixing to go down. He was weak. But then
[1:02:42] God became strong. How many knows when
[1:02:44] you become weak, he becomes strong.
[1:02:47] That's a good time for God to step on
[1:02:48] the scene. Listen, they won't they don't
[1:02:52] they don't slow their hatred and
[1:02:53] disapproval. But ignore that. You can
[1:02:56] expect it knowing where it is coming
[1:02:58] from. Just go on and get in the spirit
[1:03:01] of worship. Our spirit is clean. Our
[1:03:04] spirit is fresh. It's real. It is sober
[1:03:07] and it's serious, but nonetheless full
[1:03:11] of the joy of the Lord.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Woo. And Christians, he says, "Ought to
[1:03:19] be just as exuberant
[1:03:22] and full of pleasure in the Lord as the
[1:03:25] world is and is when it savors and
[1:03:28] delights in its pleasures."
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like I told you before, boy, I'll
[1:03:34] tell you what, when that guy comes into
[1:03:35] the touchdown zone, what he do? Spike
[1:03:38] that ball.
[1:03:40] Hello. When we say, "Well, praise be to
[1:03:42] God." Amen. Justified as though we never
[1:03:44] done it in the first place. Woo! Yeah.
[1:03:50] Just as exuberant as they are in there,
[1:03:52] we ought to be in ours. Praise God. When
[1:03:55] I was a sinner, Christ come down and he
[1:03:57] saved me. Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; They go to wave and they just have a
[1:04:08] time. Yeah.
[1:04:10] Come on, people. Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Just exuberant
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; in our pleasures as they are theirs.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; What are we doing? We're enjoying it.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Enjoy it.
[1:04:23] Go ahead. Enjoy it.
[1:04:25] [Applause]
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Might as well.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; All right, let's get our closing
[1:04:35] statements
[1:04:37] tonight.
[1:04:39] I didn't pull the quotes up.
[1:04:43] Pleasure.
[1:04:45] Enjoyment.
[1:04:47] Well, brother Ber,
[1:04:49] what if I'm sick and dying?
[1:04:53] What if I come down to the door of death
[1:04:56] and I'm laying on the bed? How in the
[1:04:58] world are we going to enjoy that?
[1:05:03] Have I got your attention?
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to tell you something. I
[1:05:08] believe that you can still have your
[1:05:09] enjoyment.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; You can still have your pleasure.
[1:05:13] How do I know? Because if you remember
[1:05:16] brother Bossworth when he was going,
[1:05:18] brother Brandham went to him and wanted
[1:05:19] to pray for him and he said, "No,
[1:05:21] brother Brandham, I'm just going." And
[1:05:22] brother Brandham in the wisdom of a
[1:05:25] Godly man asked him, "When was your
[1:05:29] greatest time?
[1:05:33] When was the greatest enjoyment? Where's
[1:05:36] the greatest time of your pleasure? What
[1:05:39] was the best time of when people getting
[1:05:40] healed, eyes coming open? What was it?
[1:05:42] When is your greatest pleasure?
[1:05:45] He said, "No, not back then. Right now."
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "This is the best time of my
[1:05:52] life
[1:05:53] cuz I'm 5 minutes from now. I'm going to
[1:05:56] go into the presence of God. I'm going
[1:05:58] to go and be where I've wanted to be the
[1:06:00] whole time." Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; I want to make a statement that should
[1:06:05] stick down in our hard drive. I believe
[1:06:07] brother Bosworth lived his life for that
[1:06:10] day. He kept looking for that day. How
[1:06:13] many knows brother Brandham did? He
[1:06:15] looked for the day that he would go see
[1:06:17] Hope and Sharon Rose. He looked and
[1:06:20] lived for that day.
[1:06:22] Evan Bosworth must have lived for that
[1:06:25] day. How many believes that you'll live
[1:06:27] right? You'll do right. Ain't nobody
[1:06:29] going to have to tell you, preach you,
[1:06:31] or put you in the church band to try to
[1:06:33] get you to do right. If you'll look at
[1:06:35] that last day when I come down to that
[1:06:36] door of death, how many would say,
[1:06:38] "That's how I want to go." If I go by
[1:06:41] the way of the grave, that's how I want
[1:06:42] to go. I wanted to say, "This is my time
[1:06:44] of my life. This is the best time. I'm
[1:06:47] fixing to go."
[1:06:49] Paul Raider, he was dying, ain't that
[1:06:52] right? And they were singing near my God
[1:06:54] to some kind of a sad song or whatever.
[1:06:56] He says, "Come on, pull them saints
[1:06:58] back." Who's down here? Me or you?
[1:07:03] Sense of humor. Down at the cross where
[1:07:06] my savior down some chipper song. Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Even in death, you can have joy. How
[1:07:14] many believes
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; you can have joy? You can have pleasure
[1:07:17] because that's what you're living for.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you'll live right if you look
[1:07:24] for that day. Live for that day.
[1:07:27] Amen.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Paul when he come down to that says, "Oh
[1:07:37] death,
[1:07:38] oh death, where's your sting? Oh grave,
[1:07:43] where's your victory?" But I thank G God
[1:07:46] through Jesus Christ that gives us the

[1:07:55] Amen.
[1:07:58] I found the pleasure I once craved.
[1:08:02] I forget just how it goes.
[1:08:05] It is joy and peace within.
[1:08:08] It is like a great overwhelming flood
[1:08:12] springing up within my soul.
[1:08:16] It is joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:08:20] Full of glory, full of glory. It is joy
[1:08:25] unspeakable and full of glory. Oh, the
[1:08:30] half has never yet been told.
[1:08:35] God bless you. Stand with me. Have a
[1:08:39] prayer before we turn it over to brother
[1:08:41] David.
[1:08:43] How many tonight would admit that you
[1:08:45] need more of the joy of the Lord?
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; You need to enjoy this whole thing a
[1:08:50] whole lot better than you do. Raise your
[1:08:51] hand if that's the truth. Lord Jesus,
[1:08:53] you know why you laid that on my hand,
[1:08:55] my heart, Lord. I said, God, you lay
[1:08:57] what we need, Father, on our hearts,
[1:08:59] Lord. And I know I need that, Lord.
[1:09:01] Father, it shouldn't be out in the barn
[1:09:03] that I scream and holler and worship
[1:09:05] you, Lord. But wherever I am, we should
[1:09:07] enjoy the presence of God. And that goes
[1:09:10] for every one of us, Lord. We got our
[1:09:11] hands raised and saying, Lord, we need
[1:09:14] more of that joy.
[1:09:17] Paul and Silas when they were in jail,
[1:09:19] what did they begin to pray? And they
[1:09:21] begin to sing. and so forth. They had
[1:09:24] their pleasure to be able to be
[1:09:26] persecuted for Christ. They had joy that
[1:09:28] is everlasting
[1:09:31] that comes only by knowing God. And that
[1:09:34] was their enjoyment. That was their
[1:09:37] pleasure is living for God. We raise our
[1:09:41] hands tonight, God, and say, "Help us to
[1:09:43] go from here a different people than
[1:09:45] what we live Monday and Tuesday and
[1:09:47] Wednesday." Lord, tomorrow help us to
[1:09:49] have a different attitude about things
[1:09:51] to keep our mind on you, on the things
[1:09:53] that'll actually inspire us and give us
[1:09:56] joy. None of the things, our jobs and
[1:09:58] all of that gives us joy, Lord. It is
[1:10:00] you. It's your word. It's your presence,
[1:10:02] Father, that we meditate upon day and
[1:10:04] night, Lord Jesus, that gives us
[1:10:07] pleasure that draws us closer to you,
[1:10:09] Lord. Gives us true joy so that our
[1:10:12] spouses, our children can see that mom
[1:10:15] and dad really have something. and made
[1:10:18] a children say, "Mom, I want what you
[1:10:20] got. Dad, I want what you got."
[1:10:24] And you can pray with him. See, let's
[1:10:26] pray. You can have it. Surrender your
[1:10:29] life to God. And you can have that same
[1:10:31] joy, that same peace. Father, we thank
[1:10:34] you, Lord Jesus, that you have the peace
[1:10:36] that you've given us, the joy that
[1:10:38] you've given us, the grace that you've
[1:10:40] given us. Father, the comfort that you
[1:10:43] have given us. And we you knew we needed
[1:10:46] a comforter, Lord. And we thank you for
[1:10:48] that comfort. Amen. I believe it was
[1:10:50] when the angels come down, they brought
[1:10:53] tidings of comfort and joy to Oh,
[1:10:56] tidings of comfort and joy, Father. And
[1:10:59] that what we have in our hearts, Lord
[1:11:00] Jesus, we don't have to go to the world
[1:11:02] and all these other stuff for comfort or
[1:11:03] joy. We come to church to get more,
[1:11:05] Lord. And Father, we ask, God, as our
[1:11:08] hands are up now, Lord, give us more of
[1:11:09] your joy. Lord Jet does no matter what
[1:11:12] the circumstances is, whether it's good
[1:11:14] or bad, we can always obtain that joy in
[1:11:19] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. God bless
[1:11:22] you, brother David.
