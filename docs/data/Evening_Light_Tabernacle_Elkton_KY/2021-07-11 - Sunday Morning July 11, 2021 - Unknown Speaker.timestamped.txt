[18:30] of them that speak lies shall be stopped
[18:33] you can have your seats brother brian
[18:46] good morning brothers and sisters uh
[18:49] if you return with me to uh ii
[18:52] corinthians
[18:53] the third chapter before i get started i
[18:57] know we had a
[18:59] had a missionary offering last week
[19:02] so with what's been people the offerings
[19:06] people have made over
[19:08] over the last couple of months right now
[19:10] in the missionary fund
[19:14] there's uh seven to three hundred
[19:16] dollars and brother thomas
[19:19] gave an offering to someone a couple of
[19:20] weeks ago and it would have been it
[19:22] would have been about eight thousand
[19:24] dollars
[19:25] um with all the obligations that we have
[19:29] taking the missionary fund and taking
[19:31] all those other things out of
[19:33] out of the funds we have about eleven
[19:36] thousand dollars
[19:38] in the general fund and as of
[19:41] uh the tenth of this month uh there's
[19:44] eighty-eight thousand dollars
[19:47] left to pay off on the principle of the
[19:49] church
[19:51] and uh it's i've said this before the
[19:54] church is a 25-year loan the maturity
[19:56] date
[19:56] is like october september of 2030
[20:00] so we're well ahead we're probably three
[20:02] or four years ahead of
[20:04] uh early right now and having it paid
[20:06] off so
[20:08] god is more than able you know that was
[20:09] a pretty good psalm this morning so
[20:11] i don't know who you are or where you
[20:13] come from people here this morning
[20:16] but if you came here depressed that
[20:18] psalm pretty much tells you that you
[20:20] shouldn't be depressed
[20:21] as a christian really should you be
[20:24] depressed
[20:24] i'm not saying there isn't spirits or
[20:26] depression out there in the world but
[20:28] if you've got that kind of hope and that
[20:30] kind of god that's taking care of you
[20:32] really should you be sad this morning
[20:34] should be no you should be happy and
[20:36] joyful
[20:39] that god has thought about you from the
[20:41] foundation of the earth
[20:43] and the beginning of everything god had
[20:44] you in his mind and had you in his
[20:46] purpose
[20:46] so with thoughts like that how can you
[20:48] be depressed i mean
[20:50] doesn't mean that life can't beat you
[20:51] down sometimes but in the end you got
[20:53] light at the end of the tunnel
[20:55] just think of that person next to you
[20:56] that you work with that doesn't have any
[20:58] light at the end of the tunnel
[20:59] that'd be a pretty miserable place to be
[21:01] this morning but
[21:02] before i go into
[21:05] uh that chapter and corinthians you got
[21:09] you don't have to turn to it i'll read
[21:11] here but i was just
[21:13] sitting in my office this morning and i
[21:14] was thinking
[21:16] you know if we were going to use
[21:17] examples to follow i was just i don't
[21:19] know why i was thinking about this but i
[21:20] was thinking about the first chapter of
[21:22] jonah
[21:23] and and uh i'll read a few of these
[21:25] verses here but
[21:27] you got to remember these men that were
[21:28] on the ship with jonah
[21:30] they they weren't hebrews they weren't
[21:33] like us
[21:33] they were just regular regular gentiles
[21:36] like you and me
[21:38] in a sense they were like us they were
[21:39] just regular gentiles worshipping
[21:41] their own gods but they had more
[21:44] manliness about them
[21:45] than most people in the world today and
[21:47] i'll just and i'll explain why
[21:49] i'll say that but the lord's this is
[21:52] in the fourth verse but the lord sent
[21:54] out a great wind into the sea and there
[21:56] was a mighty tempest in the sea so the
[21:58] ship was like to be broken
[22:00] and you got to remember we're talking
[22:03] several thousand years ago
[22:05] and we're talking wood ships with square
[22:08] cells and oars
[22:10] and they couldn't tack in the wind the
[22:12] only thing they could do is stare by a
[22:14] square sail so it means the only time
[22:16] they could use a sail
[22:18] is when the wind was in their favor or
[22:20] in the direction they wanted to go
[22:22] so they didn't have this the ability to
[22:24] react with the seeds like
[22:26] they do today more afraid and it goes
[22:29] large out the grain went into the sea
[22:31] and there was a mighty tempest in the
[22:32] sea
[22:33] so that chips was like to be broken then
[22:36] the mares were afraid and cried every
[22:38] man
[22:38] ought to his god and cast forth awares
[22:41] that we're in the ship into the sea to
[22:42] lighten it
[22:43] any of them but jonah was down in the
[22:45] sides of the ship
[22:46] as he lay and he was fast asleep so
[22:50] so the ship master came to him and said
[22:52] unto him what means thou
[22:53] o sleeper arrives call upon our god if
[22:55] we so be that god will think upon us
[22:58] that we perish not and they said
[23:00] everyone to his fellow come let us cast
[23:03] lots that we may know for those
[23:05] for whose cause this evil is upon us so
[23:07] they cast lots and the lots fell upon
[23:10] jonah
[23:11] so jonah was still hiding the fact of
[23:13] hawaii was on the boat
[23:15] then he said unto them tell it said on
[23:18] then tell us we pray thee
[23:19] for this cause this evil is upon us and
[23:22] what is thine occupation and once comes
[23:24] thou
[23:25] what is thy country and of what people
[23:27] are thou of
[23:29] and he said unto them i am a hebrew and
[23:31] i fear
[23:32] the lord and the god of heaven which
[23:34] hath made me
[23:35] made to see in the dry land then it goes
[23:37] back to the psalm
[23:38] that we just read then were the men
[23:40] exceedingly afraid and said unto him why
[23:43] hast thou
[23:43] done this for the men knew that he fled
[23:46] from the presence of the lord because he
[23:48] had told them
[23:49] so these men are even though they're
[23:51] gentiles they're pretty smart when it
[23:52] comes to
[23:53] the the hebrew god they got the only god
[23:56] and
[23:56] then he goes on then they said on to
[23:58] them what shall we do then
[24:00] unto thee that the sea may become unto
[24:03] us for the sea rot and was tempest and
[24:05] he said unto them take me up
[24:07] and cast me forth into the sea so shall
[24:10] the sea
[24:10] become unto you for i know not for my
[24:13] sake this great thompson's
[24:15] upon him nevertheless the men rode hard
[24:18] to bring it
[24:19] to the land they and they could not for
[24:21] the sea rot with temptations against
[24:23] them what i'm trying to say these men
[24:25] wouldn't throw no or in the sea it tells
[24:28] you about their character and their
[24:30] integrity they didn't want to cast that
[24:31] man into the sea because they knew it
[24:33] would be death
[24:34] and it and in the end wherefore they
[24:36] cried unto the lord
[24:38] and said we beseech thee and in the end
[24:40] they had to do it i'm not saying that
[24:41] they didn't do it
[24:43] wherefore they cried on the lord say we
[24:44] beseech thee lord we beseech thee
[24:47] let us not perish for this man's life
[24:49] lay not upon us innocent blood for thou
[24:51] o lord has done
[24:52] as it pleased thee so they took up jonah
[24:55] and cast them forth into the sea
[24:57] and the sea ceased from its rage then
[24:59] the mere
[25:00] men feared the lord exceedingly and
[25:02] offered a sacrifice unto the lord
[25:04] and made vows no and then we all know
[25:07] what happened after that the
[25:09] lord made a great fish and we swallowed
[25:10] jonah but i was just
[25:12] i don't know i was just thinking this
[25:13] morning that's real character that's men
[25:15] being real men
[25:16] doing what men should do and that's
[25:18] protect each other
[25:20] until the uttermost end and then
[25:22] sometimes that's lacking in
[25:24] the world that we have right now there's
[25:26] you know i was just thinking in the
[25:27] world you live
[25:28] no matter who you are or what you are
[25:30] you you know brother
[25:31] adam said jesus said everyone says as a
[25:34] christian
[25:35] you should treat people like you want to
[25:37] be treated it doesn't make a difference
[25:39] whether they're a pagan
[25:40] a christian it doesn't make a difference
[25:42] you should treat people like you need to
[25:44] be like you expected to be treated
[25:46] you could shouldn't expect something out
[25:48] of someone else that you wouldn't do
[25:50] yourself and that's
[25:51] where we're at in the world people
[25:53] expect other people to do things for
[25:55] them that they
[25:56] wouldn't be willing to do for other
[25:58] people and
[25:59] i don't know why i'm saying this but
[26:01] that's in i was also listening to a
[26:03] message this morning and i'm not
[26:05] i'm totally off my point which i do a
[26:08] lot but
[26:11] i was you know that message that brother
[26:13] brown preached on identification
[26:15] where you have to identify with your
[26:16] sacrifice so everything we do
[26:18] what christian you're identified with
[26:21] jesus christ
[26:22] everything we do is identified without
[26:25] sacrifices
[26:26] in jesus christ and that's our hope and
[26:28] that identification should choke forth
[26:30] in our life for who we are and what we
[26:32] are this morning
[26:33] you know and in the natural sense
[26:37] i guess we're all americans but in the
[26:39] spiritual sense we're all christians you
[26:41] know brother brown
[26:42] said as an american you've got to
[26:44] identify with the good and the bad and
[26:45] as a christian sometimes you've got to
[26:47] identify
[26:48] with the bad things that happen and the
[26:50] good things that happen you know no one
[26:51] gets out of this life without struggle
[26:54] so our only hope is in jesus christ this
[26:56] morning
[26:58] and i'm totally uh off my point but i'll
[27:00] just read this
[27:01] i was thinking this morning i don't know
[27:04] if you all remember i've got one of
[27:05] those kind of memories it was like
[27:07] i forget what year it was 1994 1995 but
[27:11] i'll just read a few of these scriptures
[27:12] here
[27:14] do we begin to commend this is the third
[27:16] chapter of
[27:17] second corinthians i know i do that a
[27:19] lot
[27:20] some things never change but we'll start
[27:23] this verse first
[27:24] do we begin again to commend ourselves
[27:26] or need we
[27:27] as some others epistles of condemnation
[27:30] to you or
[27:31] letters of commendation from you and we
[27:34] are
[27:35] epistles written in our hearts known and
[27:37] read of all men
[27:38] so we are epistles so god has wrote a
[27:40] tablet he's writing on your heart right
[27:42] now this morning
[27:44] and you're in a position where god is
[27:46] leading you and writing on your
[27:48] heart putting his love in you putting
[27:50] his desires in you this morning
[27:52] can we always see on the outside what
[27:54] god is doing for you or for me
[27:56] no but god is working on the inside and
[27:58] he goes on to say for as much as you are
[28:01] manifestly declared to be the epistles
[28:03] of christ
[28:04] ministered by us written not with ink
[28:06] but with spirit of the living god and
[28:08] not in the tables of stone but in the
[28:10] fleshly tables of the heart so
[28:12] everything that god does for us is in
[28:14] the is to the inner man
[28:16] and then from the inner man everything
[28:18] reflects out the world's got it opposite
[28:21] they got you changing the outside hoping
[28:23] the inside will change with it
[28:25] but actually the real christian
[28:27] experience is the other way around
[28:28] god has to start on the inside and it
[28:30] has to work its way on the outside
[28:32] and he goes as such trust we have
[28:34] through christ to godward
[28:36] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[28:38] to think of anything as ourselves but
[28:40] our sufficiencies of god
[28:42] who has also made as able ministers of
[28:44] the new testament
[28:46] not of the letter but of the spirit for
[28:48] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[28:50] life and like
[28:52] brother thomas mentioned on wednesday
[28:55] like
[28:56] brother parrish was praying that spirit
[28:59] the holy ghost itself
[29:00] has got to have control over everything
[29:03] what made us able ministers of the new
[29:05] testament not of the letter but of the
[29:07] spirit
[29:08] for the letter kill it but the spirit
[29:09] giveth life but
[29:11] if but if the ministration of death
[29:13] written engraven in stones was glorious
[29:15] so that
[29:16] the children of israel could not
[29:19] steadfast behold the face of moses for
[29:21] the glory of his continents which glory
[29:23] was to be done away with
[29:25] how shall not the ministers of the
[29:27] spirit be rather glorious
[29:29] for if the administration i'm going to
[29:32] stop there
[29:33] i'm not going to read this whole chapter
[29:35] but my simple point this morning
[29:37] not wanting to take a long time
[29:41] every one of us has a responsibility to
[29:44] be that person that god wants us to be
[29:46] and then every one of us has got to get
[29:48] to a position where we let god work in
[29:50] our hearts and lives
[29:51] bring us into that place that we're
[29:53] supposed to be
[29:54] you know i was just thinking this
[29:56] morning i said i don't i'm not going to
[29:58] say it again
[30:02] but and where you're at this morning
[30:05] with jesus christ you've
[30:06] as as i get older i i know for myself i
[30:09] gotta stay
[30:10] you gotta i was just listening to
[30:13] brother brown this morning
[30:15] the closer you get the better off you
[30:17] are the further off you get
[30:18] the worse you are that's the thing about
[30:20] the you've got to stay close to the lord
[30:22] in every day of your life
[30:24] if you let anything get between you and
[30:26] him that's when you start having
[30:28] problems so
[30:29] may god bless you all brother david
[30:48] hey you love him with all of your heart
[30:50] let's stand and sing that little course

[1:08:48] morning turn with us to the book of
[1:08:50] acts the 11th chapter
[1:08:55] i was thinking looking back there and
[1:08:57] just kind of studying and kind of
[1:08:59] looking at some things last night just
[1:09:02] and that brother whoever was that was
[1:09:04] teaching the little
[1:09:06] sun sunday school lesson and didn't know
[1:09:09] what i was going to preach i probably
[1:09:10] didn't even know i was here
[1:09:11] amen and so we just appreciate brother
[1:09:14] byler having us while he's away so we
[1:09:17] appreciate that so you just pray with us
[1:09:18] and just a little simple thought but
[1:09:21] anyway i'm just thinking about that this
[1:09:22] morning as he was
[1:09:24] up here talking
[1:09:27] about and what i want to preach on this
[1:09:29] morning so you just pray for us
[1:09:31] acts 11 verse 26 and says
[1:09:34] and when he had found him he brought him
[1:09:37] unto antioch and it came to pass that a
[1:09:40] whole year they assembled themselves
[1:09:42] with the church and taught much people
[1:09:45] and the disciples were called
[1:09:46] christians first in antioch
[1:09:50] may the lord add his blessings to the re
[1:09:52] word you may be seated
[1:09:54] i want to read a thought or a quote to
[1:09:57] you this morning
[1:09:58] and it was where i want to draw my
[1:10:00] thoughts from this morning
[1:10:03] brother brown makes a statement in
[1:10:04] israel in the homeland in 1953
[1:10:08] he said now notice he condemned moses
[1:10:10] because moses glorified himself
[1:10:12] you know you remember this in a
[1:10:14] scripture that moses
[1:10:15] he was supposed to speak to the rock and
[1:10:17] he smoked the rock
[1:10:20] he said condemn moses and you just
[1:10:22] watched today
[1:10:23] he said these big churches they're all
[1:10:26] wanting you to come to their church in
[1:10:27] their organization
[1:10:29] and every preacher is falling to try to
[1:10:31] get a feather in his hat
[1:10:33] he will go along and say well i might be
[1:10:35] the district christopher
[1:10:36] i might be this that or the other now
[1:10:39] listen what he says
[1:10:40] brother i want to be a christian
[1:10:44] that's what men and women need is christ
[1:10:49] i want to preach on that this morning to
[1:10:51] be a christian
[1:10:53] to be a christian that's what he said he
[1:10:57] said brother
[1:10:58] i want to be a christian and as that
[1:11:01] brother was
[1:11:02] speaking this morning in the sunday
[1:11:04] school he was telling about
[1:11:06] you know when i heard a brother preach
[1:11:07] he said
[1:11:09] what if christ was in your skin
[1:11:16] when you go places
[1:11:20] on the job different places
[1:11:23] do they see christ in you
[1:11:27] and i know people today such a
[1:11:31] it seems like it's such a hard road you
[1:11:34] know it's just a struggle
[1:11:36] but i wonder if people see christ in us
[1:11:40] how many people aggravate us you're
[1:11:43] driving on the road they cut you off
[1:11:44] they aggravate you
[1:11:46] or do they see christ in us
[1:11:49] i've had to apologize a lot of times
[1:11:53] well i like that state he said brother i
[1:11:55] want to be a christian
[1:11:57] now uh i googled this i i looked up the
[1:12:00] word christian i googled it
[1:12:02] then i had it because google you know is
[1:12:03] always right
[1:12:06] and then also i i i i got this bible
[1:12:09] dictionary at home and
[1:12:11] looked up the definition of a christian
[1:12:12] but let here's what google said
[1:12:15] said christian is it an inherent a
[1:12:18] follower of christ
[1:12:20] so if we're a christian this morning i'm
[1:12:22] an inherit
[1:12:23] or i'm a follower of christ this morning
[1:12:26] if i'm a christian
[1:12:27] if you're a christian this morning
[1:12:28] you're a follower of christ
[1:12:31] i want to be a christian this morning
[1:12:33] because i want to follow christ that's
[1:12:36] the only way
[1:12:36] that i'm going to get into rapture is
[1:12:38] follow him because he is the word for
[1:12:40] the hour that we're living in
[1:12:44] so christian isn't a heart or follower
[1:12:46] of christ
[1:12:47] a faithful supporter
[1:12:50] all we might support a lot of things
[1:12:53] amen
[1:12:54] but if we're a christian this morning
[1:12:55] we're going to support the cause of
[1:12:57] christ
[1:12:58] amen whatever it is we're going to
[1:13:00] support
[1:13:01] the cause of christ i you know y'all
[1:13:05] was talking about your missionary funds
[1:13:07] and everything i think that's what
[1:13:08] that's great amen every church
[1:13:10] ought to be missionary minded amen
[1:13:12] brother branson we need to watch what we
[1:13:16] support but a christian said is a
[1:13:19] faithful support
[1:13:20] a faithful supporter sticking fast
[1:13:23] amen i want to stick fast to christ this
[1:13:26] morning
[1:13:27] i don't want to let him get out of my
[1:13:29] sight this morning
[1:13:30] amen another uh the definition was
[1:13:33] clinging
[1:13:35] my head i want to cling to him as much
[1:13:37] as i can
[1:13:38] amen you remember when he was here on
[1:13:40] earth and he began to teach you know he
[1:13:42] had three phases
[1:13:43] he had the first or the second poll then
[1:13:45] they opened another word and when he
[1:13:46] began to preach
[1:13:48] amen that me my father are one except
[1:13:51] you eat to my flesh and drink my blood
[1:13:52] the bible says they turn and walk with
[1:13:54] them no more
[1:13:56] amen and he looked around at the 12 that
[1:13:59] were left
[1:14:00] and said where you go also they said to
[1:14:02] whom shall we go
[1:14:03] seeing thou has the words of eternal
[1:14:05] life i say this morning if we're a
[1:14:07] christian where else are we going to go
[1:14:09] see that he has the words of eternal
[1:14:12] life this morning
[1:14:15] amen so i want to cling to him this is
[1:14:19] one who professes
[1:14:20] believe in the teachings of jesus christ
[1:14:24] so if you're a christian this morning
[1:14:26] you're a professor of the belief
[1:14:28] in the teachings of this bible of christ
[1:14:33] says a christian it's someone whose
[1:14:35] behavior
[1:14:38] and heart reflects jesus christ
[1:14:42] hallelujah god i've seen god help me
[1:14:45] this morning
[1:14:46] i'm saying lord help me wherever i go
[1:14:48] whatever i do
[1:14:50] amen let me be let me my behavior be
[1:14:52] like
[1:14:53] what you would want it to be lord help
[1:14:55] my behavior help my
[1:14:56] help my behavior and my heart to reflect
[1:15:00] you lord
[1:15:01] amen i want to reflect him so much amen
[1:15:04] i wouldn't people see me
[1:15:05] i want them to see christ in me is that
[1:15:07] what your desire is is that what your
[1:15:09] prayer
[1:15:10] is this morning that they'll see christ
[1:15:11] in you
[1:15:14] hallelujah there's a critic someone
[1:15:16] who's hard behavior
[1:15:18] i thought about that i just looked at
[1:15:19] that i thought god
[1:15:21] what about i believe it's inventory
[1:15:23] taking time it's checking up time
[1:15:25] we need to find out where we're standing
[1:15:27] in this late hour that we're living in
[1:15:30] and i sure want my behavior and heart to
[1:15:32] reflect jesus christ
[1:15:34] it's his followers of jesus were first
[1:15:37] called christians at antioch we read
[1:15:38] that
[1:15:39] they were called christians because
[1:15:41] their speech
[1:15:45] and behavior was like christ
[1:15:50] they were called christians because we
[1:15:52] remember
[1:15:53] in the in the scripture where peter you
[1:15:55] know he
[1:15:56] was warming himself by the fire and they
[1:15:58] came and said hey do you know him
[1:16:01] and he died him and they said hey you're
[1:16:04] one of them we seen you and he denied
[1:16:05] him
[1:16:06] and one of them said hey we know you're
[1:16:08] one of his because your speech
[1:16:10] betrays you i wonder this morning
[1:16:14] the people in the world and not only
[1:16:15] that but people sitting around us
[1:16:17] this morning and recognize us being a
[1:16:19] christian because
[1:16:20] our speech and our behavior are like his
[1:16:25] that's something to think about amen
[1:16:29] oh you say well you say you're a
[1:16:32] christian i want to be a christian
[1:16:34] brother said to be like a christian
[1:16:36] means to be like christ

[1:16:48] this was real good
[1:16:50] so i'll just read this to you real

[1:17:23] if you still got a desire in your heart
[1:17:25] to serve god oh god help us this morning
[1:17:28] he said you don't have to if you still
[1:17:29] got to desire in your heart to serve god
[1:17:31] i wonder this morning how many in here
[1:17:33] this building this morning as a
[1:17:35] desire to serve god this morning

[1:35:58] it's a christian and then hearing of
[1:36:00] christ look at that a faithful supporter
[1:36:02] follower clinging it's in the word
[1:36:05] occurs
[1:36:06] three times in the new testament the
[1:36:08] disciples were first called christian
[1:36:10] in any acts 11 26. peter
[1:36:14] exalted if anyone suffers as a christian
[1:36:17] let him
[1:36:18] not be ashamed first peter 4 16. yet if
[1:36:21] any man suffers christian let him not be
[1:36:23] ashamed but let him glorify god on this
[1:36:25] behalf
[1:36:26] in each instance the word christian
[1:36:29] uh assumes that the person called by
[1:36:31] that name
[1:36:32] was a follower of christ christians were
[1:36:35] loyal to christ
[1:36:36] just as the herodians were loyal to
[1:36:38] herod
[1:36:39] matthew 22 16 and they sent out their
[1:36:41] disciples with herodians
[1:36:43] saying master we know that thou art true
[1:36:46] and teach us the way of god and truth
[1:36:48] neither cares for thou for any man for
[1:36:51] thou regardless not the person of man
[1:36:53] mark 3 6 and the pharisees went forth
[1:36:56] straightway to counsel with the
[1:36:57] herodians against him
[1:36:58] how they might destroy them and then the
[1:37:01] same
[1:37:02] book mark the 12th chapter 13 birth and
[1:37:04] they sent unto him certain of the
[1:37:06] pharisees
[1:37:07] of the her and of the herodians to catch
[1:37:09] him in his words
[1:37:10] what were they doing they were trying to
[1:37:12] trap him in his words
[1:37:15] oh if i can just be like he was this
[1:37:17] morning brother david
[1:37:19] they came to him one time and said hey

[1:37:29] is it all right let me ask you a
[1:37:32] question
[1:37:34] john the baptist baptism
[1:37:38] was it of man or was it of god
[1:37:42] and they said we got a counsel just for
[1:37:44] a little bit
[1:37:45] and they got their group together they
[1:37:46] said now listen if we say
[1:37:49] it's a man they'll stone us because they
[1:37:52] all consider him to be a prophet
[1:37:55] but if we say this of god hillary asked
[1:37:56] us why don't we believe them
[1:37:58] so you know what they'd asked him or you
[1:38:00] know what they told him say we can't

[1:40:29] to do as he did would it not produce the
[1:40:31] same thing that he did when he was here
[1:40:32] on earth
[1:40:33] this is what the prophet of god said he
[1:40:35] said it like this if the spirit of john
[1:40:37] dillinger was on the in me
[1:40:38] he said i'll be dangerous to be around

[1:45:39] he said brother branham i already said
[1:45:41] brother david what do you mean by that

[1:45:45] like this
[1:45:46] 1954 everlasting life and how to respect
[1:45:49] he said what's the matter with
[1:45:51] a lot of people today is they're trying
[1:45:52] to pack up to be a christian
[1:45:56] he said we need to do some unpacking we
[1:45:59] want to put the
[1:46:00] mama i can't go because the boys want me
[1:46:02] to bring my card table along so we pat
[1:46:04] that on the camel

[1:46:09] we'll pack this on the camel
[1:46:10] and the camel's so matched down he says
[1:46:12] and he's so boldly
[1:46:14] he can't hardly walk he said what we
[1:46:15] need to do is do some unpacking
[1:46:17] god help me to impact me this morning

[1:46:38] you got some things you got to do amen
[1:46:43] thank you lord hallelujah
[1:46:46] oh thank you jesus amen
[1:46:51] now listen again that bible
[1:46:54] dictionary he said the designation of
[1:46:58] the early father of christ this
[1:46:59] christian was initiated by the
[1:47:01] non-christian population for antioch
[1:47:04] originally it was a term of derision an
[1:47:07] object of ridicule
[1:47:09] like they call you holy roller brother
[1:47:10] bram said i've never seen a holy roller
[1:47:13] but if they call me an unholy ruler then
[1:47:15] there must be unholy rulers
[1:47:18] is that it's an object of ridicule or
[1:47:19] scorn eventually however
[1:47:22] christians used it of themselves as a
[1:47:25] name of
[1:47:25] honor and not a shame
[1:47:29] prior to their adoption of the name
[1:47:32] the christians call themselves believers
[1:47:34] acts 5 14 and believers were then
[1:47:36] more added to the lord multitudes both
[1:47:38] men and women
[1:47:39] call themselves brothers acts 6 6 3
[1:47:42] wherefore the brethren look you out
[1:47:44] among you seven men of honest report for
[1:47:46] the holy ghost and wisdom
[1:47:48] point over this business our saints acts
[1:47:51] 9 13
[1:47:53] 18. these names answered
[1:47:56] these names the 99 has answered lord i
[1:47:59] have heard of this
[1:47:59] man how much he had done of the saints
[1:48:02] at jerusalem names that also continue to
[1:48:05] be used
[1:48:05] in modern terms the name christian what
[1:48:08] emptied of its meaning
[1:48:10] as a follower of christ like the lady
[1:48:12] said that i read
[1:48:13] i have you know i'm a methodist he said
[1:48:17] it it means said to some today christian
[1:48:20] means little more than
[1:48:21] an european or american
[1:48:24] who is not jewish while others have
[1:48:26] sought to make its proper use
[1:48:28] the name of a particular denomination
[1:48:31] however
[1:48:32] its original meaning is a noble one of
[1:48:36] which any follower of christ can be
[1:48:38] rightly proud
[1:48:39] i can be proud because i'm a christian
[1:48:42] this morning
[1:48:44] amen god's obligated to his word
[1:48:47] if i'm professed to be a christian he's
[1:48:49] obligated his word
[1:48:51] he's not obligated to me it's not but
[1:48:52] he's obligated his word
[1:48:54] amen if he said he'd heal yeah then he's
[1:48:56] obligated his word
[1:48:58] amen the lord's supper how many
[1:49:00] remembers the lord's supper
[1:49:01] how do you you know how that uh that
[1:49:03] pain originated how many knows how that
[1:49:05] painting originated
[1:49:08] good i'll read it to you so this is a
[1:49:11] replica of leonardo da vinci's
[1:49:13] of the last supper the famous
[1:49:15] masterpiece took over seven years to
[1:49:17] paint
[1:49:18] the interesting story behind the
[1:49:20] painting is this
[1:49:21] da vinci felt that he should use living
[1:49:23] persons as models
[1:49:25] since this was to be such an important
[1:49:27] picture
[1:49:28] he started with the painting of christ
[1:49:30] hundreds of young men were
[1:49:31] studied to find a man whose face
[1:49:33] portrayed innocent and beauty
[1:49:35] after long search he found a man whom he
[1:49:37] felt could portray christ
[1:49:39] the painting of christ took six months
[1:49:41] when christ was completed
[1:49:42] eventually worked for six years making
[1:49:44] the disciples all were completed but one
[1:49:47] that one was judas to find someone
[1:49:50] whom the events he thought looked like
[1:49:52] judas was a problem after a long
[1:49:54] discouraging search
[1:49:55] davinci heard of a man in prison at rome
[1:49:57] who was sentenced
[1:49:58] to die for his brutal crimes leonardo
[1:50:01] went to rome
[1:50:02] as as a prisoner was brought before him
[1:50:04] he saw a man with an
[1:50:05] ugly vicious face scarred and full of
[1:50:08] hate
[1:50:08] he knew immediately that this was a man
[1:50:10] he wanted to represent judas the
[1:50:12] savior's betrayer
[1:50:14] by special permission from the king the
[1:50:16] prisoner was brought to
[1:50:18] milan to pose for da vinci for six
[1:50:20] months he sent for da vinci
[1:50:21] and appointed ours finally the gifted
[1:50:24] artist finished his painting
[1:50:25] as a guard breaking the person away he
[1:50:28] broke loose
[1:50:29] rushing to leonardo's side he gasped it
[1:50:32] gaps look at me do you not know who i
[1:50:35] am with his sharp christian eyes and
[1:50:37] eventually looked at the man and said no
[1:50:39] i do not know you i never saw you until
[1:50:41] you were brought before me in rome
[1:50:43] then the pressure lifted his head toward
[1:50:45] heaven and cried oh god
[1:50:47] have i fallen so low then he turns to
[1:50:50] davinci said leonardo da vinci look at
[1:50:52] me
[1:50:52] again i'm the same man you painted only
[1:50:55] seven years ago as a figure of christ
[1:50:58] but brandon says it's like this um uh
[1:51:00] 1953
[1:51:01] diamond democracy immunology religious
[1:51:05] realm
[1:51:06] it said it took 10 years for that man he
[1:51:09] said it don't even take 10 years
[1:51:10] just 10 minutes away from christ
[1:51:16] just 10 minutes away from christ and
[1:51:17] you'll never know where you end up at
[1:51:23] invention in the usa brother brown 1954
[1:51:25] brother and says like this
[1:51:26] you never know where to stand a man
[1:51:28] that's unstable like that or a person
[1:51:30] that's professes to be a christian
[1:51:31] and that unstable you don't know what to
[1:51:33] do about that person today they're a
[1:51:35] christian tomorrow you don't know where
[1:51:36] they're at
[1:51:37] in church today they're rejoicing and
[1:51:39] singing and praising god and tomorrow
[1:51:40] out drinking
[1:51:41] corrosion around that type of a person
[1:51:43] is hard to do anything with
[1:51:46] god deliver me this morning if you give
[1:51:49] that your book didn't say god deliver me
[1:51:53] so i want to be a christian you know the
[1:51:56] church don't say
[1:51:58] this church it don't save you it only
[1:52:01] helps you
[1:52:02] maintain what you got
[1:52:07] amen i believe we need to do some
[1:52:09] maintaining around the
[1:52:10] church then i need to do some
[1:52:13] maintaining
[1:52:14] amen how do you maintain it start
[1:52:17] feeding it you remember that chief
[1:52:19] that brother talked about like a black
[1:52:21] dog white dog fighting
[1:52:23] he said well chief which one wins the
[1:52:24] most he said the one i feed the most
[1:52:27] what do you feed on during the week
[1:52:32] that wednesday night service sunday
[1:52:34] mornings but during them times what do
[1:52:35] you feed on
[1:52:37] lord help me help me lord
[1:52:40] i need you more the church helps you
[1:52:43] remain a christian
[1:52:44] it's not packing an image but it's being
[1:52:46] a limited image
[1:52:48] don't let me be a living image a walking
[1:52:50] example
[1:52:54] i want to be a christian
[1:52:57] remember i said churches have become
[1:52:58] prostitutes by giving out wrong doctrine
[1:53:05] oh god help us a christian before he can
[1:53:09] really call himself a christian
[1:53:11] has to meet god face to face and know
[1:53:13] where he stands
[1:53:15] god help me this morning if you're here
[1:53:18] this morning and you really ain't a
[1:53:19] christian
[1:53:20] then you've got to meet god face to face
[1:53:22] and really know where you stand at this
[1:53:24] morning
[1:53:26] because the scripture says the bible
[1:53:29] says that everything that can be shaken
[1:53:31] will be shaken and brother it's a second
[1:53:33] time
[1:53:35] it's a scary time but he had a glorious
[1:53:37] time for this bride
[1:53:38] because we know that we're fixing to be
[1:53:40] out of here
[1:53:42] thank you lord hallelujah right around
[1:53:45] like this i feel like running i'll be
[1:53:48] like jumping and screaming and something
[1:53:49] that's how i feel
[1:53:53] like running jumping screaming
[1:53:57] hallelujah that's how i feel sometimes
[1:54:01] hey man let me read this to you
[1:54:05] hey man he said now listen
[1:54:09] he said he said on greater than solomon
[1:54:11] is here 1963.
[1:54:13] he said the church needs to know not to
[1:54:14] solve hybrid something soft and family
[1:54:16] like the church is just make a
[1:54:18] confession be baptized and you're a
[1:54:20] christian
[1:54:23] is it not something soft and flabby just
[1:54:24] to be baptized and you're christian
[1:54:26] me my wife was walked uh driving down
[1:54:29] the road uh it's
[1:54:30] been several years now and they had it
[1:54:33] and i got xm
[1:54:34] you know satellite radio in my car so
[1:54:38] i turned it over there joel osteen you
[1:54:41] know he's
[1:54:42] always smiling he's that kind of guy
[1:54:45] brother wallace that
[1:54:46] you can whip him every day and take his
[1:54:48] lunch money away from him
[1:54:50] he looks like the kind of you know
[1:54:54] anyway he said repeat he on that right
[1:54:57] he's a repeat after me
[1:54:58] and he's supposed to repeat that to him
[1:55:00] he said all right now you're a christian
[1:55:02] i looked at my wife as what you think
[1:55:04] she goes i kind of doubt it
[1:55:06] said i do too to not be baptized be
[1:55:10] flabby soft flabby
[1:55:11] he said to be a christian or self-denial
[1:55:18] they had to deny themselves
[1:55:21] he said something i'll deny yourself
[1:55:22] take up your cross
[1:55:24] and follow me back then to be a
[1:55:27] christian
[1:55:28] death i believe it does the same thing
[1:55:31] today
[1:55:32] only spiritual separation from the
[1:55:34] things of the world
[1:55:36] but we don't want to take up our cross
[1:55:37] do we we always want it easy
[1:55:41] it reminds me of this little story this
[1:55:43] guy was complaining about his cross that
[1:55:46] he was carrying
[1:55:47] and he said god i'm tired of carrying my
[1:55:48] cross
[1:55:50] i said i want another cross that i can
[1:55:52] carry this one's i'm just tired of it
[1:55:54] he said all right there's three crosses
[1:55:57] make your choice so he picked up the
[1:55:59] other one he goes oh those
[1:56:00] splinters uh i don't want this one too
[1:56:03] many splinters
[1:56:05] so he picked up this other second one
[1:56:08] he said man i can't i don't want this
[1:56:10] one i can't lift it so he picked up this
[1:56:12] other one
[1:56:12] he said man this fits just right no
[1:56:14] splinters ain't too heavy
[1:56:16] the lord said that's been your cross all
[1:56:17] along
[1:56:19] see what you go through i might not be
[1:56:21] able to go through and what i go through
[1:56:23] you might not be able to go through but
[1:56:25] every one of us has a cross
[1:56:27] and one of us and everyone has to deny
[1:56:29] ourselves
[1:56:31] he said deny yourself take up your cross
[1:56:32] follow me today it's so soft when people
[1:56:34] call themselves christian
[1:56:36] when it used to mean death to confess
[1:56:37] christ and you had to depend on him
[1:56:39] daily for everything you had need of
[1:56:41] brother it's getting to that time it's
[1:56:43] getting to that spot
[1:56:45] hey man that we've got to depend on him
[1:56:47] once again but we had to depend on him
[1:56:49] all along but like i was saying you know
[1:56:52] the doctors
[1:56:52] seem like they don't know nothing
[1:56:54] anymore what's wrong i don't know
[1:56:57] well i come to you you tell me which but
[1:56:59] that's why i come to you for you to tell
[1:57:01] me what
[1:57:01] was wrong they know i got to depend on
[1:57:04] god
[1:57:06] again he says jesus christ the same 1962
[1:57:08] said
[1:57:11] he just looked like an ordinary jew he
[1:57:13] was dressed like an ordinary man i don't
[1:57:15] believe you have to dress funny to be
[1:57:16] different to be a christian
[1:57:18] i don't believe you have to act funny i
[1:57:20] believe you just be a person
[1:57:21] just be a christian that's all nothing
[1:57:25] peculiar
[1:57:26] it's just something inside of you has
[1:57:27] took place you see happiness joy and
[1:57:30] peace and satisfaction
[1:57:31] and long suffering gentleness peace
[1:57:33] people can talk about you
[1:57:34] it don't bother you a bit see that's the
[1:57:38] fruits of the spirit
[1:57:39] hallelujah and the fruits of the spirit
[1:57:41] if you want to turn to it galatians
[1:57:43] chapter 5 and verse to uh
[1:57:47] 20 uh 22 but the by the fruit of the
[1:57:50] spirit but the fruit of the spirit is
[1:57:51] love joy peace
[1:57:52] long suffering gentleness goodness faith
[1:57:54] maintenance temperance against such
[1:57:56] there is no law
[1:57:57] and they that are christ have crucified
[1:57:58] the flesh with affections and lust
[1:58:01] he said that's the fruits of the spirit
[1:58:04] love joy peace long suffering goodness
[1:58:09] maintenance temperance
[1:58:12] is it against such there is no law amen
[1:58:15] and they that are christ have crucified
[1:58:18] their self in the lust the flesh
[1:58:21] paul said i gotta die daily if he had to
[1:58:23] die daily what about me and you brothers
[1:58:25] and sisters
[1:58:27] amen all brothers and sisters
[1:58:30] it's like this a lot of us was mixed up
[1:58:34] in a marriage
[1:58:35] some of us a lot of us did this and this
[1:58:38] i heard
[1:58:38] some of the old timers by the way you
[1:58:40] probably heard it too many one was going
[1:58:42] to hear and preach marriage and divorce
[1:58:44] and they told their wives whatever he
[1:58:45] says
[1:58:46] that's what we'll do
[1:58:52] but you know what he said he said go and
[1:58:54] do it no more
[1:58:55] teach your children not to do it no more
[1:58:58] what was it grace
[1:59:00] grace somebody was trying to brother
[1:59:03] wade somebody was trying to
[1:59:04] chase their family tree you know that
[1:59:06] started here some maybe fifteen twenty
[1:59:08] everybody wanted to trace their roots
[1:59:10] some person told me he said man i
[1:59:12] started and i and i had to quit
[1:59:14] i didn't want to go back no further
[1:59:18] but you look at the life you look at the
[1:59:20] you go back and you trust the genealogy
[1:59:22] of christ
[1:59:24] tamar ray had the
[1:59:28] harlot we call
[1:59:34] ruth moabite you know where she come
[1:59:36] from
[1:59:37] incest

[1:59:46] when they came to him and threw that
[1:59:48] woman down at his feet said she's been
[1:59:49] caught in the very act of adultery
[1:59:51] moses law said she ought to be stoned
[1:59:53] what about you what do you say
[1:59:55] the bible says he stooped down
[1:59:59] hallelujah didn't say a word just begin
[2:00:02] to rot in the sand
[2:00:07] when i couldn't come to where he was he
[2:00:10] came to me
[2:00:13] he stooped down they threw their stones
[2:00:15] away
[2:00:16] she rose up grace
[2:00:19] hallelujah grace hey man
[2:00:23] in the seal book brother brandon said
[2:00:24] like this live just live a simple
[2:00:26] christian life
[2:00:29] hallelujah christ was a very expression
[2:00:32] of god
[2:00:34] i mean you brothers and sisters it's the
[2:00:37] bride of christ
[2:00:38] we're supposed to be the very expression
[2:00:40] of christ
[2:00:43] i just want to be a christian like
[2:00:44] brother brown said
[2:00:46] can i read you two more things and we'll
[2:00:48] get out of here
[2:00:50] unveiling my god 1964.
[2:00:55] brother wade i think might have been
[2:00:56] mentioned like this or somebody did
[2:01:01] he said i'll notice how many american
[2:01:02] citizens is in here
[2:01:05] huh he said raise up your hand
[2:01:08] he said all right you're an american
[2:01:09] citizen then you're identified with this
[2:01:12] nation
[2:01:12] whatever this nation is you must be
[2:01:16] he said is that right you're all of her
[2:01:18] glory
[2:01:19] and you all are for shame you're
[2:01:21] identified with her
[2:01:22] you are an american so you take on
[2:01:24] america he says hallelujah
[2:01:27] i was with george washington when he
[2:01:28] crossed the delaware
[2:01:31] because if we're american i was with
[2:01:32] jordan oh i can see it now
[2:01:34] i was with him when i because i always
[2:01:36] like to study history and everything
[2:01:38] i was with george washington when he
[2:01:39] crossed the delaware
[2:01:44] i'm identified with him that's right i
[2:01:45] was with abraham lincoln at the
[2:01:47] gettysburg address
[2:01:49] i was standing there i was with the
[2:01:51] soldiers at guam with boys you host the
[2:01:53] flag
[2:01:54] i was there i'm an american i'm
[2:01:56] identified with it amen
[2:01:58] now to be an american whether her shame
[2:02:00] in the revolution is in the
[2:02:01] revolutionary
[2:02:02] i bear it because i'm an american that's
[2:02:04] right
[2:02:06] then he goes on to say in the same sense
[2:02:07] i'm better than god and as a christian
[2:02:12] i'm identified with him
[2:02:15] he says amen i like that amen
[2:02:18] and amen is not a gender
[2:02:22] that means so be it there's only two
[2:02:24] genders
[2:02:25] male and female 31 ways to make a be a
[2:02:30] pervert
