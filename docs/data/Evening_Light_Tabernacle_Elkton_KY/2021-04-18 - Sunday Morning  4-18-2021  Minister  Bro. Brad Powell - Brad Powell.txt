heavenly father lord we just thankful for to be in your house this morning lord we're just thankful lord that your people your bride has come out lord this morning to worship you in spirit and truth lord for without that spirit and without the truth we would not be a place we need to be lord lord jesus we thank you for the music we've heard this morning and the songs of zion and singing out lord and praising you and lifting you but now we come to the portion of the service lord where the word goes forth lord and as the word goes forth we know that in the word there's healing and the word their strength and the word there's deliverance and the word there's forgiveness lord everything that we have need of we can find in the word lord and we just ask lord that you would just come down and speak to our hearts this morning lord may you just come and draw us close to you may you go through the aisles this morning and speak to each one of our hearts lord and just go about and you're just a midst of the holy spirit fall upon the crowd lord jesus and say lord what can i do to get closer to you lord what can i do to allow you to work greater in my life lord lord we want to tell you we love you we appreciate you we give you honor praise and glory we thank you for all you do in jesus name amen amen good to be in the house of the lord this morning and uh i'm thankful that uh that we serve a risen savior i'm thankful that uh god has continued to move in his bride and his people and and i just i just want to be part of that so i want to speak this morning if you want to turn in your bibles uh we'll read from two places we'll read from john chapter 3 and second corinthians chapter 12. two very familiar scriptures but i just want to speak on if we could for just a little bit uh and if i would title this it would be descending into greatness i'm getting some rebound is that is that me for the micah okay descending into greatness and if you look in john chapter 3 let's just go there this is this is where john is speaking john the apostle speaking of john the baptist and this is considered his last testimony john the baptist's last testimony after these things jesus after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judea and there he tarried with them and baptized and john also was baptizing in anan near salem because there was much water there and they came and were baptized for john was not yet cast into prison then there arose a question between some of john's disciples and the jews about purifying and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou bearest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him and john answered and said a man can receive nothing that's important a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven he yourselves bear witness bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because the bridegroom's voice this is my joy therefore is fulfilled here's what we want to get to he must increase but i must decrease he that cometh from above is above all and he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth that he cometh from heaven is above all and what he hath seen and heard and testifieth and no man receiveth this his testimony he that hath received this testimony has said to seal that god is true for he whom god has sent speaketh the words of god for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his hand he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him second corinthians real quick if you would chapter 12 verse 9 and 11. second corinthians 12 9 and 11. give you just a second i still hear pages turning and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong i am become a fool and glory and that you compel me for i ought to have been commended of you nothing for in nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles though i be nothing may god as is blessings to the reading of the word you can have your seats so i'm going to take this thought descending into greatness and you know i'm a topic preacher so i study out topics and i try to go at it and break it down and just kind of look at it and see what what the lord would have for us but this morning will be similar the same way but this is not at all what i had in mind uh really when brother balor asked me wednesday night to take this service um uh this is not what i had on my mind up until about three o'clock this morning so we need the help of the lord this morning okay uh we always do but this morning this thing we need a special so but if that's what what he wants that's what we'll we'll deliver so um bro brandon says here in paul he says when i am weak then i am strong yes he said i will glorify my infirmities of the weakness and so forth i'm thanking god that all of all is out of me and when i get everything out of me then god can come in but as long as i've got some of myself there then god can't get in so brother brown is telling us that as long as he's got just a little bit just a portion just some just a fragment of himself in the way god has no room in there there's no room for god there and god can't get in there listen what he says he says and that's it we smother him out we drive him away now that is a bad thought to have in our mind that we would be in such a place that we drive push or smother god away from us he said it's from the poorest to the richest from the least to the greatest we keep god out of our lives because of our own selves it's he says i've often said you've heard it a million times that the greatest enemy i got is william brown so we're talking about the prophet of the hour a man sent from god to come to reveal the word to a bride in this last age and he's not talking about his greatest battle or his greatest enemy that he's got he's not talking about satan he's not talking about the anything any of the demons that satan can throw at him but he's talking about himself because he knows that jesus christ has already defeated satan and there's nothing that satan can throw at him that he can't overcome but it's himself that he can't overcome that ought to catch our attention he says because he's the one that gets in the way william branham he's the one that gets lazy william he's the one that gets into a place sometime that he thinks he can do something about it and when he does he shoves god right out of the picture and that is easy for us as human beings because we want to fix things we are constantly in our minds if there's a problem we try to figure out a way to get through it around it over it or whatever instead of sometimes letting god do the work we lift ourselves up and brother brown said if i can get rid of that guy when i get into a place like that and he's out of the way then god can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about the prophet of the hour if he can get himself out of the way and god can come in and do something that william branham knows nothing about you talking about a man of humility he's talking about a humble approach and getting himself into a place lower than low to allow god to come in and do something through him he says that's when god can use you that's when god can use any of you you can point finger at yourself this morning and say if i can get myself out of the way i can let god come in and use me you think how would god use me what can i do for god who's his eyes who's his ears who's his voice how's he expressing himself in the world today he's expressing himself through his believers if we just get out of the way so we see these two we read our scriptures we see these two patriarchs of the new testament and they're that's their goal that's what they're trying to do they're trying to get themselves out of the way men of god william branham and these two patriarchs we talked about they're recognizing that the whole world is relying upon them to get out of the way and let god move on the scene and do what god wants done now it's a bold statement when john the baptist says i have to decrease so that he can increase you think about those two words decrease and increase decrease means to make something smaller fewer in size the amount the intensity or degree and so increase is just the opposite of that we're growing we're getting better we're getting stronger we're getting bigger we're adding to god's kingdom and we think about in the human or in the american language english language we think about the word down and that has a negative connotation to it you think about down and you think well man that that's not a good word it's reserved for losers down the word we try to avoid it we want to try to ignore it when it's thrown at it because when you attach it to other words they bring us down like down and out down-hearted downfall down scale downhill downer down under but the word up is just the opposite it has these positive connotations and it's associated with the heroes and winners and the people of the bible it's upscale upcoming upper class upstanding and we think about our present world we live in what have you been taught your whole life to move up in the world to move up in your career to move up in your job to move up amongst your peers to move up in school to constantly be moving up and here we've got that in our minds and in our minds we're directed towards that way to go up up up and people they want to rise above the rise to the occasion or rise above odds that's what we're taught so how do we change that in our minds when we think about christ how do we think change that in our mind when we realize that in order to get stronger in christ we have to get weaker how do we change that let's look at this these john the baptist when he says that it had to startle his disciples and open their eyes in such a way they're looking at him in shock and in awe and he tells them i must decrease so that jesus can increase and that goes completely against their fleshly desires so how do we descend into greatness let's look at this passage for just a minute so right before we get to this scripture we had jesus just had the conversation with nicodemus and during that conversation jesus is telling nicodemus that you have to be born again and we go to the most important or one of the most famous verses in the bible john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that's whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life so jesus is having this conversation with nicodemus and after it's over he's he's witnessed the nicodemus and all that's taking place jesus then travels about 50 miles into another another area called salaam and he's associated right there with the jordan river and so over there jesus then begins to baptize people and it's one of the only accounts i think the only account where we see jesus actually baptizing in the river and so john the baptist is over here in the same place now let's get the setting here and he's over there baptizing people at the same place and there's an argument that that ensues between john's disciples and some other jewish men now we're not we don't know the bible don't tell us what they were arguing about maybe they were arguing about how you get baptized how how you how you who baptized who should do it how you do it wherever but anyway we know that the end result john's disciples come back to john and they question what is jesus doing they told john they said that man that you was with on the other side of the jordan the one you testified about he's baptizing and now everybody's going to him you see they were followers of john the baptist they was loyally following him and now all of a sudden this new guy comes into town and he's getting all the credit this new guy comes into town and they don't like it one single bit they're sitting there and they look and they because to them it's a competition now this was their life to them this is what they did day in and day out they went to give people they witnessed they they brought people to john the baptist he baptized them and everything was good this was their livelihood man they were in control of their life but now they're not happy about this that man over there has moved into our territory they've got a little bit of anger about them and just think about it you know it's like if you owned a successful business on north main street in the town you live in and you had the one product that everybody had to have everybody needed it and you're the only place in town that carries this product and then all of a sudden you find out that on south main street somebody else is putting in a store and you know what they've got that same product that you've got how would you feel so here is the disciples of john the baptist and they're here and they're going through this and in their mind they're proud of the work they're doing and they go and they go to john and they tell him they don't even call him by name they don't even notify or recognize him as jesus they don't even recognize him as a messiah even though john does they don't it's that man you were with over there who is he why is he here what's he doing he's encroaching on our territory john baptist ministry was big it was established it was growing by the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and john's disciples are just are concerned about this but john he had a different approach he listened to what they had to say but he knew exactly who he was they thought john was the man for the hour they thought that john was the man going to take us all in he's the one that's going to going to settle all this even though john says i told y'all don't you remember me telling you i'm just the forerunner i'm not the one i'm not the one that needs to be getting the credit john knew that jesus was the man of the hour so john he knew who jesus was his disciples didn't but they're upset everybody's going to jesus watch what john says because he knew his ministry was only successful because of god's blessings it wasn't anything he was doing it was what god allowed him to do he said a man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven and brothers and sisters we've got to keep that in our minds at all times or if not we find ourselves puffed up we find ourselves in a prideful situation we find god not able to move through us and use us because we have got ourselves into a place that we are successful i did it i'm successful i did this i did that you see how easy it happens that's exactly what john john the baptist disciples did you did this john we're with you where one were you how come he's coming in they couldn't put their self in a lower place but i'll tell you this anything we have come from heaven if you've got a business and it's a successful business it's been given to you from heaven if you've got a uh uh if you've got peace in your life it's nothing you did you didn't learn that in a school that's been given to you from heaven if your marriage is still held together today it's because it was given from heaven all of these things that god had done and he's done it to you because it comes down from heaven and if we can find ourselves stepping out of the way in life and letting god be first how much how much further along will we be down the road how much more could god use you how much more could there be a ministry in your life i'm not talking about preaching i'm not talking about singing i'm just talking about being a christian i'm talking about living the life before others i like where john goes into the scriptures there and he immediately likens himself to the best man at the wedding and i i never caught that before last night at 3 30. i've never caught that that john likened himself to the best man at the wedding in this case he knows that jesus is in a in an accordion and a marriage with his bro with the bride or the church and john understands his role in the kingdom of god and he understands that the groom is the one to be blessed and that's what he tells his guys he says you know i'm happy being the best man in the wedding i'm happy to be the best man because the groom is the most important man of the hour in this case last night i think it was probably a different scenario but in this case he's putting god first and foremost in his life and brothers and sisters if we can continually do that there is nothing that will stand in the way because god delivers those who gets out of the way god he he trusts those who gets out of the way god he makes the believers that get out of the way god can use and he never fails you have you are in a win-win situation you have nothing to lose you know you see you hear ball games and stuff you hear athletes they go into they're the underdog they have nothing to lose they have no worries they have no fear they don't care because all they can do is upset and defeat the other team you've got nothing to lose let's look at paul for a few minutes brother brown said this was a man that was trained he could speak almost any language there was in the world he had the right to brag about it he was brought up under the strict sect of the pharisees his father was a pharisee and later he was a pharisee of the pharisees and that means he was the strictest of the pharisees a great fellow and he had authority and he was smart his father had given him an education or the best teacher and there was all that there was all in all the land and at that time the most notable teacher of any schools and paul became that type of man he learned every language every psychology and he was going to make havoc of the church can you imagine knowing how to speak every language of the land what kind of man is this what kind of education what kind of training and teaching does this man have that that he could know every language and psychology but yet paul with all of his education after he received christ listen to what he said he says it's not how strong and great i am i've got to forget that in order for god to use me he had to realize that he couldn't depend upon himself he couldn't depend on his education he couldn't depend on his upraising and his teaching because it wasn't right and he said he got there and he's come to a place and he says brethren when i come to you it's not with excellency of speech but it's with the power of god he wasn't relying upon all he had learned listen what he says can you imagine a man a pharisee a pharisee he's a teacher a teacher trained from a childhood for the ministry and this is this is the guy's going to wreak havoc on the church an eloquent man smart a man who could turn the world upside down the greatest missionary that's ever been known to confess that he come in weakness we're taught from a child to be strong we're taught to be durable we're taught to fight through the battles we're taught to be overcomers this message teaches us to be overcomers but if you want to be an overcomer you've got to find yourself in a weakened condition that god can actually come in and use you and you've got all of your pride all of your education and everything out of the way just like paul did he said he come in weakness and in fear he said not and in much trembling he said the reason he was fearing was not because he was scared of anything so paul wasn't scared of anything he said it was something that he learned he said he didn't come with excellency of speech but he came in fear in the way knowing nothing but christ and him crucified his fear come from not being able to get low enough that god could step down in him and use him and overcome all that he knew in the past this was a man who was a warrior he had to be stripped of himself we got to be stripped of ourselves our homes have to be stripped of themselves our schools have to be stripped of themselves our churches have to be stripped of their selves our marriages have to be stripped of ourselves because if we're not dripped down god can't can't intervene god can't be in your marriage if you're going to do it if you're going to control the marriage god's not in it our priorities sometimes get wrong we place ourselves up here and god down here instead of being up here low weak meek lowly and humble we put ourselves up here as bread winner head of the house it's the truth we got to strip ourselves down listen to what he says i hope this gets deep to us he said that you realize that you've got to become nothing not a know-it-all not a great somebody a nobody you've got to come to dust a place where you know you're nothing and then later you can rise back up right no he said and you've got to be able to keep yourself there and never rise above it never rise above it for as soon as you rise above it you rise above god keep yourself in the dust and on the road to damascus you got to keep yourself off your high horses god took paul and made a slave out of him bound him to himself and i love this because we want to say sometimes god has a sense of humor here's where god has a sense of humor listen to this brother ryan said that he bound him he made him a slave and bound him to himself and bound him to the gentiles which he hated god will take you and use you in places that you never wanted to go he'll take you and use you and i guess people are with people that you just can't stand to be around and that's what he did to paul he said you've stripped yourself down paul now i'm going to come in now go to those gentiles go to those people that you hate go to those people that you can't stand the ones you put in prison the ones you beat the ones who's tortured go to them now and bring them to me you're talking about breaking somebody down we talk about stripping out stripping this stuff away god stripped paul down in such a way that he couldn't do nothing but walk around with his head huh all the pride he ever had had to have been stripped away from him and that's what we got to do to ourselves today god said to paul my strength is perfect in your weakness you know sometimes we don't even recognize god until we're in a situation to where we are completely out of control you hear stories about all time somebody and i'm not using this church as an illustration but you hear it all the time people somebody goes to a hospital somebody's on their deathbed and all of a sudden god miraculously steps in why was that because somebody got so broken down that they could not rely on themselves the family was so broken down because they had nothing to do with the doctors they don't know medical conditions all they know is their loved one's dying and they get so low and down before god that god hears their prayers and it's sad that it has to be that way but sometimes that's the way it happens you have to get that low before my strength is perfect in your weakness and brother brown says the more that can be yielded the better i can use you anybody that's ever got up before people in a church singing ministering music if you don't yield yourself god can't move you can have a bunch of notes and quotes and thoughts but if god's not in those thoughts there is not a connection between the people and the minister and the word just goes out void you have to yield yourself into such a place that you're dedicated you're weak and you get your mind to a place that is away from everything to do with the world and god begins to use you let's look in the book of hebrews real quick chapter 11 the hero the heroes of the bible made strong through weakness you know all those heroes down through there you got samson you got gideon you got david you got samuel you got all those prophets you got uh i think rahabs in there you got all these different heroes and heroines of the bible and then when you get down there and it says this and and chapter and verse 34. quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword and out of weakness they were made strong they had to get weak before they could get strong out of their weakness they were made strong here's something to console us he says here's something that encourages out of weakness and humility god chooses people to build his kingdom out of out of your weakness out of your humility out of you becoming humble before people god builds his kingdom that's an amazing statement that the prophet says he said you stand in front of a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world and know nothing but that's what god is building his kingdom out of i promise i'm gonna lift you up when i get to the end i'm gonna get you back up out of the gutter okay so just bury with me isn't it strange though that god likes us to sheep he likes us to sheep the most helpless thing that there is in the animal kingdom one of the most insufficient animals with defense is the sheep the squirrel they run in a tree the rabbit runs off in the bushes the dog bites lions tear up brother branham said the horse can kick the bird flies but the sheep just stands there has anybody ever raised sheep nobody's as ignorant as i am i tried raising sheep you're talking about aggravating they just look at you get over here get over here they drive you nuts but they're defenseless at the night when when they they were laming we had to pull them into the barn because when they had their lambs the coyotes would carry them away because they don't fight man they just stand there and they just stand there and let it whatever it is come down and get a hold of them and god likens us to that right there and he wants us to realize that we are totally insufficient without him those sheep were totally insufficient without me bringing them in feeding them water them to make sure the lambs were nursing i said when those when those sheep would have babies they just they just born die you couldn't keep those things alive insufficient and he wants us to realize we're insufficient and he takes that person that's insufficient and he begins to modem into a person that god can use he begins to build their character he begins to take that weakness and then he begins to make his own self that's why our childhoods are so important how we raise our children is so important because you're beginning to instill in them the ways of the gospel the ways of christ and when you instill that into them there's something on the inside that they begin to realize even at a young age i'm nobody i'm a nobody but god can use me as somebody david you look at david there out on the battlefield the poorest excuse of a soldier that could be found the bible says that he was a ruddy little fella brother brown said he was a scrawny looking fella stoop shoulder probably just out there ready stoop shutter had a little piece of sheepskin around him he never had any training in swordsmanship he didn't know anything about battle but he's he he got into such a place that he was so low as he looked out there and he said why are we bowing down before this god before this giant and so he stood there and relied upon god and god looked down at him and he said this little guy's got this little guy's got fire in him that he wants to do something for me when he sees the whole army of israel bowing down and cowing down he's standing there as low knowing that he has no ability whatsoever in himself and he calls up on me to deliver the giant five little stones moses we look at moses and we look at the life of moses it's an interesting life because moses was raised right in the courts of pharaoh and moses was the had taken such a position the prophet said he was the next in line to be pharaoh he was smart he was educated he was training the soldiers this guy was a trained soldier but when he seen what was happening with his own people when he realized who he was and he goes out into the backside of the desert and he goes out there in the desert he settles down he's running from all that he knows he's running from his education he's running from his his royal throne he's running from all that he's in the desert in the wilderness and on the backside a man 80 years old with long whiskers brother brown said he got didn't learn he got one glimpse of a burning bush that stood there and said i'll be with you go to egypt because he knew in himself he wasn't anybody moses had come to the realization i have i am nobody in egypt i have no authority in egypt if i go to egypt they will probably have my head and he knew in himself he was nothing but the prophet said he went right down there with a little old stick in his hand and took over a whole nation of people because he allowed god to use him he got himself into a place that god could use him i truly believe that if we want to find the king kingdom of god and we want to find heaven and we want to find ourselves and maybe a place right here on earth that god can use us we have to be willing to do exactly as john did as paul did as moses did as david did brothers and sisters we have to descend into greatness we have to descend into greatness because i don't think there's any other way to do it there's you can't be a halfway christian you can't be a halfway uh a good person there's nothing you can do halfway that'll never work you and i both know that if we want to get great we have to descend i have to be able to give myself to god i have to be able to let god use my feet i have to be able to let god use my voice i have to be able to let god use my character and my christian ability out in front of the people to draw people to god i have to be able to submit myself to what he wants but there's risk involved there's risk involved there's risk involved if you submit your life and you surrender to god you say risk what do you mean risk you just can't give god a little bit that's risky there's risk you've got to be able to go all in with god and allow him to use you it's like jumping into a swimming pool you stick your toe in and you freeze to death but if you rare back and you run as hard as you can go and you jump in a big cannonball right in the deep end you're all in you're all in at that point and that's what god is looking for people who will go all in who will take that risk who will get themselves into a place god i surrender everything to you now use me god i want to be the person that allows god to use me and myself not be in his way my thinking is not in his way my beliefs are not in his way and when i say beliefs it's a tough one because we believe this message but sometimes we have beliefs that don't completely line up with this message i'm just being honest and i think we all have things in our lives things that maybe you were taught in message churches in the past that don't truly line up with god's word when you dig into it and we've got beliefs that we stand on and beliefs that we look at and it hinders us from allowing god to use us the risk and become more christ-like is that the more you look like christ the greater your challenges will be are you up to the challenge are you up to the challenge this morning because you're going to be faced with powers of evil that are going to come at you over and over and over and the more you look like christ the more satan throw your way the biggest i ever told is once you're a christian you got it made that is the biggest lie ever told by anybody in shoe leather because once you become christian once you submit your life to god you're a christian and god begins to use you satan's going to come at you from every angle of attack possible he is very good at strength in the strategies of warfare and he knows where your weaknesses are and he will throw them before you but god's looking for people who could stand that challenge god's looking for people who can allow himself to come in and then use him use you as he would see fit that's why we have to say when i'm weak he's strong the beauty of christ increasing in our lives is the way we live our lives it's the way we experience life it's the way others see how we live isn't it don't you live different when just be honest with yourself don't have to raise your hand but don't you feel good and feel different when you know that you're walking hand in hand with god when you're submitting yourself when you when you when you're not working you're not placing anything before god and you're walking hand in hand with god and you can feel him and you know you're in a special place with him at that time in your life don't you feel different that's when you're weak you know the footprints on the stands of time it wasn't that perky it wasn't god left that person god was packing that person it was in their weakest hour god was doing something for them and in our weakest hours when god does something for us when we have christ increasing on our soul we become more satisfied the things of this world don't matter so much anymore you say well i struggle with this i struggle with that i struggle over here i struggle over there you know your struggles but the closer you get with god and the more you allow him in your life the less those things matter they just don't matter anymore i used to think it was in houses i used to think it was in lane i used to think it was in automobiles it doesn't matter those things are nothing but it's if god is in my life it's god in my life of my wife it's god in my children that is my heart's desire those are the things that have value others will look at you and marvel at god working in your life when we when we hear these stories of david and we hear the stories of paul and we hear the stories of moses and how what they did we marvel at that that's not just history that's our brothers that's who you are god chose us in this hour he chose people a chosen group of people to live out that kind of life that you would write a testament of yourself for god being humble being humble we've got to give god credit for his accomplishments that's an image that's an image of decreasing so god can increase just give god credit how do you do that die daily paul said i have to die daily brother brown said he has to die daily i have to die daily we get up we live our lives and we go through our routines and everything and by the end of the day sometimes we are in such a place that we just have to say god i need to die before you i need to lay my life down before you god because i didn't do too well today i failed over here i felt over there i did this i said this i shouldn't have done this is that just me thank you i was feeling nervous but we have to be able to to lay ourselves down before god and say god if i don't die before you i am nobody i just want to be able to proclaim him as lord as savior as forgiver as my god the messiah the one to come it's real it's he's coming i don't know if i'll see it i hope i do i believe i will i believe we're at a late hour and i know you've heard of some of you all your life but one thing about it he don't lie so it's going to happen he's going to come down and catch a bride away listen at the humility of god before we get ready to close the humility of god is so great but there was a there was a a cross called calvary you want to talk about descending to become great god went to a place that he was beaten he was mocked he was scorned he was spit upon he took you your pride your arrogance my arrogance your my pride my my mistakes that i made in life and he carried all of that upon his shoulders and packed it on a cross up to a hill called golgotha with up that they beat and spit and mocked and scorned him to death and then he went there when he died you talk about descendant he went down into the pits of hell and he took those keys from satan and he come back up it took greatness he overcome on the third day when that tomb was open god showed i can go down i can carry all the sin the weight of this world and i will raise myself back to greatness so there's your there's your way out god did that on calvary maybe you're sitting today and you think man i got so much pride in my life i got so much pride in my life i'm just like those disciples that was following john baptist just let go of it die today just die today and put it right here on the altar and just die and say god i don't want this pride in my life anymore because i realize you can't use me you can't even talk to me with such pride and arrogance in my life maybe you got shame in your life well i'm gonna say something sticky here how many of you ever been ashamed of the message you've had an opportunity to say something and he was ashamed hey i'm i'm probably guilty more than any of you especially those of you that's been raised in a message because i've got people that i've got friends i've got family i got people that know nothing of this but was i ashamed to say something about it god i've got to get rid of that shame how can i lead people to christ if i can't tell them about the message if i'm ashamed to tell them what god's done in this hour how will they ever see it peter had shame it's nothing to be ashamed about peter had shame he stood there and and right there when they asked him hey i know you he said no i don't i don't know him so how could he be a witness god had to get a hold of his life fear fear maybe fear's gripping you maybe you're afraid to get up in front of people maybe you're afraid to maybe you're afraid to sing maybe you're afraid to to even praise god you're afraid of what somebody will say you got to lay that down you got to lay that down at the altar and say god whatever you have me to do it's pulling on my heart lord you've been there i know there's people in here that's been there that god has pulled on their heart to do things and they don't do it because they're afraid of what somebody will think say or do it's the truth die today we die today so that god can ascend we die today so that god can be great not in himself we know god's great the world knows god's great they can't deny that but i want them to see god great in you let's stand to our feet if we could i just want to be able to say lord if there's anything in my life pride fear shame doubt pray arrogance a lack of commitment because i'm committed to other things maybe i just want to be able to say lord if there's anything that's causing me not to allow you to be magnified through me i want to lay it right here on this altar i want to put it right here where there's no more doubt let's just bow our heads if we could heavenly father lord i got this thought this morning early lord and i know it's not a jumping shouting message but i believe lord there's real nutrients in this message there's food in there there's the ability to overcome the ability to to uh get ourselves into a place that you could use us ability to for us to just surrender ourselves lord that's what you did for us god you surrendered yourself for us at calvary and all you ask in exchange is that we just serve you and love you lord and lord we just want to empty ourselves out this morning and if there's anybody here that has got anything you know your hang-ups you know your faults you know your failures you know where you're where you you don't allow god completely into your life to where god could use you maybe god's been calling on you with a gift in your life maybe a gift of ministry or music your heart denied to do it because you're afraid your fear you're worried what somebody will say or do won't you just lay that down today lay that down before god in the altar of your heart and say god from this day forward i'm not going to fear what others say i'm not going to be ashamed of the gospel i'm not going to be ashamed of the message i'm not going to let my pride stand before men i'm not going to be arrogant because you and you alone are worthy lord just thank you lord jesus lord do you see those hands that's volunteered themselves up to you lord as a sacrifice to you lord may you just go down and lord just fill their hearts lord this morning quench whatever thirst they have whatever desire it is in their life lord to be closer to you lord thank you lord for this day thank you for this message lord and i trust lord that it sticks with us lord and in the weeks to come lord it keeps us close to you until to the word comes again lord there's something we can just ponder on and and think on and and just question ourselves daily where where am i at and where do i need to die lord because it's a daily affair [Music] thank you lord for all you do for us [Music] i could never ever singing with all your heart want to live the
