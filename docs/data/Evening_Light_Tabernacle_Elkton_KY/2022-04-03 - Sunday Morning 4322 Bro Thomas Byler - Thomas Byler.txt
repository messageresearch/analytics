========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] right [Music] good [Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] ah foreign [Music] right [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] good [Music] [Music] [Music] morning everyone um is pointing out uh you're just only people who can hear my mouth shall speak of wisdom meditation of my heart uh none of them can by any means but they're going to give god that he should still live forever and not see corruption [Applause] [Music] they call their land after their own name this is their ways they're falling they're saying but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave forth he shall receive foreign you shall go to this generation of his fathers they shall never see life together [Music] from you know whatever [Music] isaiah the principle of um church uh after i make the payments this coming week will be done for about 75 thousand dollars and we're at that point when you if you've been paid off and longer early don't be afraid to ask me listen to what brother thomas had to say wednesday and i was just as i was reading the song this morning you know that is foreign but then isaiah talks about as it goes further on this you know there's always a positive and it's not a nice place you can't believe anything you hear ii devotional this morning and i was thinking uh not to be funny here you know some sometimes this is what this man had to say and this is for april 3rd you know these were men in world war ii they were about to go into conflict and this is their devotional for this day out of that little book i had and the scripture that was what this morning goes to what brother thomas was talking about on the wednesday and the scriptures second timothy first chapter the seventh verse and it says for god has not given us a spirit of fear but a power and a blood and mind and that last portion of that scripture and if you have the gospel of the hour and your heart and mind this morning you have jesus christ abiding in your life within your heart you can be grateful that you do have a sound mind [Music] is some of you know this historically some of you might not like to offer his power so congratulations basically thank god involved in the spiritual power through the word of god jesus christ he talked about this man given my pronunciation dr john valley of pembroke maybe it would have taken a lot longer for home and victory if they lost that armor but he goes on forgotten providence you're bringing almost 400 000 men across the channel but it goes great then took their little crash risking everything helping brothers off the safety entertainment and made her way southward in france and he felt that meeting our friend soldiers were so grateful for fear that he was no longer a man and that's pretty pretty brutal thing when someone so fearful to be abandoned and fear has destroyed his ability and thinking of the day that we live in you know a fearful day but for christians you know you can become so fearful in life with everything that's going on around you there's a story of a man in the early church and this goes to what i was thinking this morning there is a story of a man in the early church which you never see tomorrow and you remember him and we all as soon as i mentioned this thing you'll know the story and peter was his name and he seemed to he wouldn't after the free time show and goes on a short time later however we see the same man as the leader of the liberal league of christians in jerusalem not exceeding any of us could be this morning if you weren't successful or you made mistakes ten years ago five years ago two weeks ago you can still change god's channel and go to a short time later however we see this man as the leader [Applause] and give us the power of god all powers said jesus give it up to me in heaven and on earth go to there before and make disciples to behold i set a promise of my father upon me but terribly in the city but you don't move any further than god gives you the experience for when you start getting ahead of god or getting ahead of what the lord wants you to do that's what you start out in trouble and so you know i promise my father unto you in the city of jesus christ but you shall receive the power after the holy ghost will come upon you and you should be with the most important thing i can say this morning without that holy ghost power in your heart this morning everything we do i'm not saying it's not good it isn't fruitful but without god leading you and god being inside you you're not going to be successful today you know when i look at the world the way it is this morning it's pretty rude right everyone here does that your friends when you journey people making the thoughts that you can trust more you're greater than you find out there's no portrayal but you know the only thing that matters is jesus foreign [Music] [Applause] this morning where everything that we do that doesn't mean that you don't need to work anymore christ every day he's an awesome god this morning and we just appreciate the lord this morning it's good to see each and every one out we have several missing this morning but we're just happy for you that are here this morning and the john with the sean's sister lisa is here we appreciate her visiting with us this morning and man i don't see anyone else this morning let's sing that course oh say but i'm glad i'm glad amen if we could i know say but i'm glad i'm glad oh [Music] are you glad this morning i know say but i'm glad i'm glad i know say that i'm glad i'm glad for jesus has come and my cups overrun amen oh let's stand and sing it to him once again this morning and oh [Music] [Music] jesus has come [Music] [Applause] amen are you glad this morning amen i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now this morning well i started out driving for the lord many years ago [Applause] [Music] i've had a lot of [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh he's offered everything that's got a name all the wealth i want the world and fame if i could still i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now [Laughter] where there's nothing in the world that could ever take the place of god's love [Music] all the silver and gold couldn't buy my touch from above when my soul needs healing then i begin to feel his power and i said praise the lord i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now amen oh i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now gotta make it to heaven somehow though the devil tips me and he tries to turn me around oh he's offered everything that's

though my sins were scarlet they're white as so i was blind but today i am free oh i was lost in the darkness but now i found i was blind [Music] all my life has been free-range [Applause] where what

me i want my life to and when i come to that great eternity he'll smile and say he was satisfied with me i'm satisfied with god's great redemption i'm satisfied it's sufficient for a man i'm satisfied

the testing [Music] and i need faith for the time when the sun does not shine and the mountaintop is just a memory [Music] there's no sign to be seen i don't feel a thing to the word of god alone i can clean [Music] and i need strength for the day when troubles come my way and i just don't understand what it means that's when nothing else will do faith alone will see me through and believing becomes [Music] it's not hard to believe when things are going well when skies are sunny [Music] when you feel you're making progress doing good living in a time of plenty oh but if all of that should change would you still keep the faith that's the question [Music] because believing when believing isn't easy that is the testing oh and i need faith for the time when the sun does not shine and the mountaintop is just a memory when there's no sign to be and i need strength for the day the troubles come my way and the mountaintop is just a memory and that's what nothing else will do faith alone will see me through [Applause] [Music] when the sun does not shine and the mountaintop is just a memory when there's no sign to be seen i don't feel a [Music] my troubles come my way and i just don't

right it may be tuesday morning but it depends on if this old man can get everything together or not but anyway um so anyway so lord willing tomorrow so he all remembers in prayer me and my wife we're just gonna get away and get away amen and just relax for a little bit and so amen praise be to god brother ben no rod will be with you all wednesday night brother brad will take next sunday for us and we don't know just who the following wednesday we might but we might not either so amen that's how we like just pray god will bless you while we're gone amen pray for us that amen my wife she's uh that'll be all for the music uh my wife she we had originally planned to go with mike and grace uh and go down the miako river i don't know if you all know where that is to through the deep hole all right and and so my wife she looked up what deep hole was and it had so many gators they were laying on top of each other and she doesn't like gators so she was really nervous the last week or so about knowing and oh my this is not much of a vacation for her you know because you don't like going around them gators but it was really i mean they have hundreds of gators in that hole which we try to bypass but anyway so that didn't work out the river is really really low amen and we probably have to drag our canoes or boats around like that so mike and grace you're not going to go at this time i guess uh but anyway so because of that low reload river because we was planning a three-day trip down there and and and have spent about two or three nights on the river but as it works out amen we've got a place that we can stay now and it's going to be at a house way out on five acres and it's gonna be real nice and so we're just gonna go and and fish you know here and there and relax and take it easy and we'll try to make sure that donna gets a good vacation for a change amen he may not take all my time our time fishing but anyway we'll do quite a bit of it if we can help it man but anyway so that's the plan amen and so lord willing how many knows how you always pray a bunch about whatever you do because you always want god in and watch have him watch over you amen so that i mean you have to trade safe journey amen we was praying like today amen and i know we want to take the lord's supper communion so forth this morning and i thought well lord today be nice to have maybe something courage and about communion and then it just began to open up and i can always tell when the lord kind of opens up a thought for me and a message and you know and so we want to with the help of the lord this morning to speak something that is centered around communion amen because i got to thinking of how what communion is what really communion is and it's actually communing with the lord amen and when you're communing with the lord or each other or whatever it might be it has to do with fellowship in the right you're fellowshipping when you're communing amen and so and we want to talk about fellowship with the help of the lord this morning stand with me we'll just get into the word of god this morning bow our heads kind heavenly father lord we want to put you before us always in everything lord and ask for your guidance and for your ability lord that you give lord for your presence lord jesus and for your divine will god in the message this morning that we feel lord you've laid upon our heart minister and then the communion lord that you've asked us to do father we ask lord jesus that you just be in the service and also in the communion service this morning as we remember what you did for us and lord just help us lord this morning to get out of the way and speak to our hearts and our lives draw us closer to you lord jesus and help us and cause us lord to have fellowship with you and with one another for we ask these blessings in the name of jesus christ amen and amen turn your bibles will to the first book of the the first book of john amen first epistle of john john 1 and we want to read 1 down through 7. we want to perhaps this will give us a little better understanding of communion that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life everybody in this book of first john i guess if you'll notice this first verse makes it very personal doesn't it amen their eyes have seen their hands have handled and so forth that they have been with the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness to show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that's which we have seen in her declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us amen how many believes that birds of a feather flock together amen fellowship is about birds of a feather having fellowship amen together and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ how many is glad to have fellowship this morning with jesus christ amen and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full and this is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin may god add his blessings to the reading of the word this morning you can be seated now notice i like that he says listen he says our fellowship is with the father it's with his son jesus christ and then also it says that if we are in the lightest walk in the lightest year then we have fellowship one with another i believe brother benham said that brother bosworth that he i talked to him he says and brother bosworth asked him he says what is fellowship and he says you know fellowship is two fellows in one ship amen two fellows in one ship and i got to thinking about that because you know just because you're in the shape one thing that it means if you're in the same ship it also means that you're going to the same place right you're going the same direction the bible says how can two walk together unless they be agreed and then how many knows that's the whole idea of fellowship is agreement because you if you don't agree with somebody you don't have very good fellowship huh husbands and wives right get in the argument it's called argument you disagree you know you don't it's just not the most pleasant thing there is amen and so it's about agreement and even depaul talked about what agreement has uh be bial or bail with christ you know they don't agree with each other light and darkness don't agree there's a whole lot of disagreement going on amen how many beliefs and i believe that it brings in unity it brings in oneness amen and we are to have fellowship oh i like this and let me just say this i truly believe and i said it before i want to say it again that you know unless a person is truly born again unless two people are filled with the holy ghost they really don't have a lot in common all right now listen let me just read you read you a quote from the prophet when he said on communion remembering the lord he says sometimes we place now we come to the lord's table okay talking about this dolores table here to take communion showing that we have fellowship with christ because remember if jesus said that if you if i watched thou has no part with me i mean it's important to be able to take uh communion it really is no part with me you know and so he says we come to the lord's table we've explained it before how that we call it communion the taking of the bread sometimes we place it on the wrong thing we place the right thing in the wrong place it isn't so much the bread that matters or the wine that matters or the kosher and so forth that's what it is but the main thing is is the communion it means to talk to talking to him remembering him i think it's the most blessed time of services see every hour of our life ought to be a communion how many knows you're not to take of it if you're not worthy if you don't aren't in fellowship with christ then you take damnation to yourself because you're saying you have communion in which with him you have fellowship with him you are part of him and you aren't really and then god has to correct you for that he has to judge you for that he has to bring judgment that's why he said when the lord judges us chasing us huh if you're not right amen so it's important then again the next quote he says the communion with the lord is like an oasis in the desert praise the lord we could stop here and preach for a while you know to talk with the lord to have fellowship to have a prayer prepare me how many knows that's most of the time when you have fellowship with it when you're praying even paul said praying always in the spirit when you're driving down the road talk with him fellowship with god loves communication god loves for you to talk to him we don't do enough of it i got all my prayer bones i believe it was yesterday evening and yesterday and this morning god i'm coming before you again but you know i just don't do this enough lord help me to do it more [Music] pray without ceasing about fellowship without ceasing have communion god dwelled all by himself for eons of time before the first angel was made before the first stardust was made but he didn't want to be alone he wanted can we say fellowship amen we'd be a lot better off just like shadrach mesha their prayer was daniel was a prayer warrior he was in a ace he had a he went to his oasis three times a day to get away from the cares of life the work the business just oh if we just take time out of our schedule to have a little bit of a siesta with him a little little oasis a little rest with him just to take it aside the fellowship with him we'd be stronger christians i'd be a better preacher than what i am i'd be a better christian than what i am i'd be a better husband than i am i'd be a better grandparent than what i am amen what is it that you can't do too much pray fellowship talk commune something you can't never do it or you can sing too much you can pray to preach too much so you can't preach no more he might go horse might go horse and not be able to preach anymore but you can't talk to the lord too much aren't you glad that he is within hearing distance because of his shed blood on calvary now he can hear you is that right he can hear you you can have fellowship you couldn't have it before then one place i believe the bible says is as long as often you take this or as often as you meet do this in remembrance of me what are we supposed to remember we're supposed to remember calvary we're supposed to remember what made our fellowship with him possible this is my blood which you know is filled for you this is my body which is broken for you so that you can have fellowship with me again daniel had such a relationship with him huh until he didn't fear going into the lions then three hebrew children had such fellowship with god until they didn't mind getting burnt if that's what it takes huh but they had a walk with god lord help us in our walk with him our fellowship with him amen it's like an oasis in the desert it's like a spring like the traveler coming by can stop and he drinks the water till he quenches his thirst that's remembering the lord coming by the order of the table where the passing pilgrim that's so journeying here on earth with us together that we can come by this table and there drink of his blessings and of his grace and of his word in fellowship around his word amen how many know that's what you do every time that we come to church we come to the table of god to feast together to fellowship around the word of god we don't come to talk about what terrible things happened to you yesterday and the day before we don't talk about your business and how you can do your business better and how you can make money and just that or the other or you know how bad it's really going or whether i think prices are up or whether they're down we're not here to fellowship around that stuff we're here to fellowship around something greater that is the word of god amen how we can get closer to god we're here to feed jesus has a table spread where the saints of god are fit how many believe jesus says come dine the master calleth come and dine come and dine around the word of god amen praise the lord now so until our thirsty souls are satisfied and when we leave the place of worship refreshed satisfying fight going back out to me the desert problems again you know right i mean you need strength for this journey how many people this morning man you will just really enjoy the presence of the lord at church and you'll get something from church and you'll get fed and you go out feeling better but by the time wednesday comes around man you you're feeling terrible already monday and every tuesday everything could go wrong did go wrong maybe you lost your temper maybe you you know backslid somehow and boy you just need that again huh it happens to us don't it that's right but coming together at the table you know we come to refresh ourselves in the presence of god amen to get refreshed satisfied going out to meet the desert problem again and we need we need it for strength to be able to deal with our problems amen to not get drunk broke down to stay afloat just learn to get strong enough to from a sunday to wednesday and back to us wednesday sunday again still on top of it how many please we ought to stay on top of it that's right yes an oasis in the desert refreshing ourselves in his presence now how many knows if you're going to talk to somebody you got to have something to talk about what you're going to talk about what are you going to think about well this group here think about it birds of a feather flock together there's a lot of people doing a lot of different things there's a lot of people with a lot of different interests this morning and they're out there with the group that they like to hang with that they like to be with doing the things that they like to do talking about the things that they would like to hear but what brings us together is this word it's the word of god amen and let's talk about first of all you have to be in agreement with somebody before you can really talk about anything you take a big group you take a church somewhere all right or let's just say you have a convention somewhere where many churches come together those people every person with a certain spirit they will find another person with that same spirit they call to each other they're drawn to each other huh it's just something about it they it just somehow they make their way together remember what the prophet says he says you know even the young the middle age and the older people a lot of times they hang out together he says when you see a little child hanging with grandma right what do you say well they don't really have a lot to fellowship about no he says usually she's got a bag of candy or something and that's why the little kids over there get a little piece of gum i get a little candy you know why because grandma's mind is so far beyond the child's right because the first time she gets her candy who does she run back to who does he run back to their little friends of their own age and they have things in common i mean he believes that's how it is they have things in common amen i want you to know that god wants us to have things in common god wants us to be unified how many believes that he wants us to be able to fellowship one with another let me just say this a real genuine believer really doesn't have fellowship with a make-believer or a unbeliever believers hang with believers make believers have a tendency to hang with make believers unbelievers hang with unbelievers not right that's why he says if we come under the blood of jesus christ you will have fellowship one with another you can't help it why because you have the same interests you think the same i mean that's one thing that gives us fellowship with one another is the fact that when we come to christ this is something that we should all be able to agree on that when we come to christ you died to your own thinking you die to your own ways you die to yourself because jesus said unless you crucify even yourself and die to yourself you're not worthy of me and then we begin to think like christ thinks am i right each and every one of us and then we have fellowship one with another you know paul he really loved for us to have fellowship he loved for us to have fellowship one with another and to think the way that we're supposed to think if there being if this is in philippians the second chapter if there be any consolation in christ if any comfort of love let this just i go so fast any consolation if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels of mercy fulfill ye my joy that you be like-minded come on folks how many believes that we have to be like my we need to think the same things brother perry's know that when they were in the upper room they were what with one mind one accord one mind they had one goal one ambition and it was so unified that the god himself when they got in that place in that condition christ came down when we come together that's what we're supposed to have if we all come to church expecting folks so many times one person will come up and say brother brother that was just for me huh that'll be the only person that ever says anything about having enjoyed the service huh now the others probably probably everybody did but if that person comes with expectation and they're ready to hear from and that the holy spirit speaks to that person they make a special note a lot of times to tell the preacher hey brother i want you to know that was for me and don't ask don't ask me how preaching works other than you have to be led by the spirit because i've preached sermons that i felt like was a flop like i just really didn't get off the ground with this airplane we just had to go ahead and shut her back down you know and it'll be in those services somebody will come and say that i'm like wow you know like i said i don't know how maybe god maybe god kept me down here so i would say something that maybe i wouldn't have said up there but he wanted to say something to somebody and he is the one that is in the control tower how many believes that now i believe that's how it ought to be don't you it always makes you feel good whether you preach a sermon that you felt like the roof almost came off or you never left the ground as long as god's doing it that's all we care about amen so paul says here he says for you my f for you my joy fulfill you my choice and all of that to say this that you think alike that you feel like now we all have a little bit of difference but i'm telling you what i believe the closer we can get to thinking the same thing the better off we are amen i'll just stop here because it comes to my brain and i probably won't say it if i don't say it do you realize that's the problem with our nation right now lincoln say about a country divided a house divided against itself jesus said he repeated befall it cannot stand how many knows that our former presidents and different ones won't mention names but you probably know said we are going to fundamentally change america so we know that there's a group that's wanting to not have america to be america anymore they want to change it huh and there's the christian or conservative there's a lot of us that don't really want to change it i like my constitution i like america you know i sure i mean not so much anymore but you know what i'm saying i like what the foreign fathers i like the idea that we were a christian nation we could actually say we were a christian nation god was with us he sure ain't anymore that's the truth but it's because that they divide they don't think a lot they don't have the same god they're not going to write in the same direction you cannot have fellowship with people that are going in a different direction not in a nation not in a family not in a church [Music] huh when you've got a church where somebody wants to go in a certain direction huh the pastor wants to go a certain direction you are in for some trouble the splash will fly upwards when you've got a husband and wife that can't get along it gets a little sparky huh yeah that's the truth amen something has to give but praise the lord now notice so he says that ye may be like-minded having the same love being of one accord this ain't just me preaching folks this is the scriptures the court and of one mind one mind one accord one direction what is our goal church make the rapture to be in the rapture to go to heaven that is our goal he didn't have this hope in him in him the bible says purify us himself even as he is pure that's our goal if we don't have that goal that we don't have much in common hello there's baptist there's methodists there's presbyterian there's amish there are mennonite there's beechy amish there's beachy amish mennonite yeah there's all three piled together there's this that there's the other they don't agree with each other they can't walk with each other there's pentecost huh and how many knows we came out from all of that to follow what the manifested vindicated word of the hour to follow the word it's back to the word the proven word i want to get into that just a little bit later but just to shake you people so many people claim to be following the word let me just tap this a little bit i can't hardly get off of it but the pharisees how many knows the pharisees and the scribes they were israel they were the church the way that god had meant for him that he set up if there was ever a people of god in the church of god it was israel but yet when christ came he condemned him huh he condemned them he said you make the word of god a non-effect he called him you are your father the devil and his works were doing everything else the whole system of what seemed to be what was god wasn't god so be careful you got to make sure that you're sure that you're following christ amen all right so he says like-minded of one accord of one mind why because the next word will explain what will happen if you're not let nothing be done through strife or vainglory how many knows brother brown could have taken up those offers of a debate no he says debates lead to arguments and fussing and the holy ghost don't do that the holy ghost shows you the truth and you follow it or we don't even have such a custom paul said if people don't want to listen to this then we don't even have such a custom we're not going to argue about it but if you believe paul let any and preacher or angel come from heaven if he's a a spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that we write unto you are the commandments of god now when somebody comes says well it doesn't matter what paul says huh can you fellowship with somebody like that how many knows the one thing we believe is this is bible is true every bit of it is true and that we are not to live by one word or two words or some of this and some of that and say well we don't believe that part of the bible i don't have fellowship with you i believe all of the word i believe this is the eternal word of god it's all true because jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god praise the lord if you don't believe that you can't amen to that but i believe it you love him now notice so he says let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man to his own thing but every man also to the things of others let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus i don't know if you've ever been called crazy or not you're crazy huh you've lost your mind huh you know what i have to say that yeah you're exactly right i did lose my mind i lost my mind in romans the sixth verse see one time i was carnally minded for to be carnally minded is death how many knows that's what the whole world is minded this carnally minded it's death we just had a mass shooting overdue overnight i guess it was six people getting shot and killed and all of this why because to be carnally minded his death a believer a christ-like mind that would never do something like that he wouldn't murder and kill his sleeve and steal and stuff no but to be carnally minded is that but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is immunity it's against god i mean it's just your carnal mind will never think the things that the holy spirit or christ's mind will think no no it's imminent against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god amen but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit why do you think the prophet said that if you aren't born of the holy ghost hello you're not in your right mind [Music] let me see how i wrote this down the world says that we are out of our mind praise be to god i'm happy this way they say i'm crazy yeah paul said after the way that they call heresy which is crazy so worship i the god of my father who was it one of those one of those uh uh quote now i forget his name now but one of i'd hear it but one of them said you know you know you're oh you're like a madman or something you know but anyway so not those the world says that we are out of our mind yeah we have lost our mind our carnal mind is what we've lost and we've got our mind that you're supposed to have and i write down here listen but they are out of the right mind they are out of the right mind they don't have the right this world everyone out there think about that's not born of the holy spirit doesn't have the right that they're supposed to have so who's the crazy one who's the one that's really out of the mind well i ain't got to say nothing i ain't got to say a word all you have to do is look around and listen to our politics and you'll know who is out of their mind and if you don't think they're out of mind you ain't in your right mind either you think that's the right mind you need a mind change huh that's right god help us you know what we have to preach any more days we got to teach our children that if if they were born with the genetics of a male oh guess what god made you a man that's right if you're a little bit dating you look a little girlish go to the workout room all right start trying to look and act like a man don't get all dainty on me huh that's right you're not a female you're a man [Applause] start being a man you were born a woman the same way huh but what did they do no they cut their hair like a man they look like a man they got short hair just like me they're supposed to have long hair and that right they cut theirs off and all of these sissies and some of these hunting shows brother joe with these long hairs i'm like oh man i almost liked you until i saw your hair huh how many know they think that you're weird huh no sister when you have a long dress on and you have your hair the way it's supposed to be and don't look like jezebel with all the makeup you're out there and you don't have nose rings and so forth they look at you and they think you're weird what do you think when you look at that he says that is weird there's some weird people in the world why because they ain't in their right mind the prophet said he said you know and it's true the guys are long good and long hairs not right and she got a lot of attention by going in shorts and going out in public we're wearing shorts right so he wanted some attention he put some shorts on too we went out ew huh that's right it's terrible perverted carnal mind how are they gonna ever have fellowship on with another huh how are they going to have fellowship with god they're not going to have fellowship with god amen my so to be carnally minded is death praise the lord but to be spiritually minded is life and peace how many know the only way you'll ever get peace is to change your mind is to say god i don't know what to do i don't know where to go i can't go anymore i want to give you my life i want to give you my heart i want to give you my bible says to love him with all your heart soul mind and strength you gotta love it with your mind give him your mind also amen let him come in there and let you allow you to believe this bible believe what he did on calvary huh because it is a gift it is a grace to you to be able to believe this word because look at all the people that don't so that's mercy to be able to bring this and to believe what christ did to forgive you of all of your sins all of your past can be god you can be as free and as happy and as jumpy as any of these little kids that are not at the age of accountability yet amen that's exact i don't care if you're uh how old you are hey man you can kick up your kill say well praise be to god you ain't got enough room up here for me just like a little kid as innocent as a kid as happy as a kid as joyful as a kid as much peace as a kid amen such a child i guess people might think you're talking about goats but we're not talking about goat as a child as a as a kid amen you love him praise be to god my jesus loves for us to be one how many believes jesus loves when we love one another when we are together as one let me tell you something church eating like tabernacle maybe we need to work on this a little bit but we are to be united together we're supposed to be and think alike jesus said in chapter 17 of saint john verse 22 let's go with 20 20. neither pray i for these alone but for them which shall believe on me through their word that they all they all may be one as thou father art in me huh how many know jesus loves unity in a group of people see god which is jesus he knew what it was like to be in heaven to have disunity in heaven two-thirds of the angels right or a third of the angels sided with satan and he had to kick them all out excuse me so god doesn't like this unity role he don't it's not how he does it amen he loves for his people to dwell together that fellowship one with another that they may be one as so the example is like the father and jesus were one how many know they were actually in the same body are in me and i indeed that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that god has sent me the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them thou in me that they may be pure be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me amen paul he believed in unity first corinthians 1 and verse 10 says now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing amen how many believes that ought to be it's how it ought to be we speak the same three think the same way amen that there be no divisions among you and that ye be perfectly joy be joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment again it goes back to two can't walk together unless they're agreed the body of christ how many knows by one spirit are we all baptized into one body amen and that body is to be one it ought to be in unison amen when my when my body tells me to move my fingers and hands it says to take a step forward my feet disobey just exactly what that body says do folks i don't know how to say this but sometimes i wonder if we don't have a sometimes you have a maybe you have a body all of us they got people some people got the jerks you can't stop that jerk i wish you would quit but my arm keeps just going to the side huh what are you going to ask by the parish what are you going to ask me what is wrong with your arm no what is wrong with your heart what is wrong with you there's something wrong you don't just normally keep doing that i don't know this is off script i guess but i hope it helps you that body is supposed to be one just everything does what the mind tells it to right and this is supposed to be governed by christ right whatever and he is the head how many knows it says that the body that jesus is the head of the body he is the mind of the body he tells it what to do it moves all according to him the way that he wants it to move oh when we get together like that a rap shall take place we come into perfect harmony that's what god wants perfect harmony with this word jesus said all things are possible to them that believe nothing shall be impossible with you do you know what those bible schools out there taught in brother branham's hour they were teaching that the holy ghost was only for the 12 disciples they were saying there's no such thing as the holy ghost today the days of miracles this past is what they were teaching them weren't they now tell me was that the mind of christ no that was not the mind of christ that's why the prophet god come along and correct that thing oh my can i tell you a story again maybe somebody hadn't heard it young man went off to bible school to learn about the bible and his mom got real sick and was fixing to die and they sent word to the son said your mom is about to die you better come home well mom had a friend that said well you know we got a little old church down on the corner we believe in praying for the sake she says well my lord let me go down there and get prayed for she went down there and she got prayed for and she got well said word to the son no he ain't got to come because your mom's fine a little later when he does come home he asked mom well mom whatever happened how did you get better she had to tell them but we went down there and they shall lay hands on the sick the shall recover they prayed for me and i got better mark 16. they shall lay hands on the sink and they shall recover well mom now don't act so crazy now settle down huh you know them people are kind of looked down upon and so forth and we learned in our bible school that mark 16 from the like the 16th verse or some a little bit before that from there on is not even inspired tell me the devil ain't that worth teaching things that's contrary to the word now how many knows the holy spirit always has a way to come back the holy spirit always gets the last word i like that the holy spirit always corrects he says praise be to god holland mom what's with you well i was just thinking son if god can heal me with the uninspired word what can he do with this part praise be to god what a rebuke amen folks we're living in a generation where churches don't think the way that god wants them to they aren't on the same page with god [Music] i want to get to the point i want to bring up about the pharisees and so forth because we know that they were the church of the hour right one thing that a believer believes is that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever his word is eternal it never passes away isn't that right his word does not pass away and sooner or later he comes and he fulfills every promise that he made when jesus came how many knows that was a promise that was made and it was being fulfilled right in front of their eyes and yet they were so blind hello because i want you to know something jesus and the pharisees didn't get along very well they didn't a believer and a unbeliever really don't have a lot in common i believe this paul said it this way he says that you're not supposed to be be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers in other words don't marry somebody that don't believe like you do be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness oh my think about it if you're interested in righteousness we'll have fellowship if you're not we won't that's what with jesus and the pharisees what was it saint john 3 16 there somewhere in there and he says and this is uh the condemnation that light has come into the world after he said forgot to love the world he says this is condemnation let's come and men love darkness rather than life any time that the truth is presented in front of a person if they are not of the light they will not enjoy it they will scatter from it they'll get away from it what fellowship so my question now on the way to church i thought what fellowship does light have with darkness do you see the two present at once no as soon as you turn on the light the darkness scatters it leaves they have no fellowship huh just exactly like when you come into florida kitchen brother urban and you turn the light on at night you'll find out if you got roaches or not if you got roaches man they would come off of that counter and scatter like you wouldn't believe they'll get to get scoot out they love the darkness huh if you really want a nightmare amen i was sleeping one time with my shirt off and i heard landed right on my chest and come running up towards my head i don't know about you but i don't like roaches creatures of the night they love the darkness reminds me of the pharisees think about it the truth was right there in front of them jesus come and he manifested the word of god oh my jesus said my sheep know my voice they hear my voice they know the truth so where does that put all these denominational churches that saw jesus christ discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart just like he did with the woman at the well over and over and over again and pointed us to not his own words not to himself not to him being popular or a millionaire or moral millionaire but took us right straight to the word of god said all of your name putting on a book on somewhere in the book of church that don't mean nothing ain't no bible for it the bible says by one spirit i would baptize into one body that's how you get into the body and then become a member in particular isn't that right that's the right way acts 2 38 amen repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ there's only one way to come not all kinds of different ways all your good deeds isn't going to do that you got to come by the way the word chest whether it's for knowledge whether it's predestination whether it's your name being on the book all of those things are straightened up and then jesus christ would come down and vindicate it and prove it because it was the word not brother branham's word it was god's word amen what did it do for us that were of the light something happened down here didn't it something down here happened that's why we're sitting here because we're in agreement that god send a prophet in this generation behold i'll send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord not the acceptable year of the lord john the baptist but the day great and dreadfully i'll send you elijah the prophet he'll turn our hearts back isn't that right we fellowship around the truth that we stay with what the bible said and we say with what that prophet says when it comes to the interpretation now remember a prophet is a divine revealer of the word of god according to the scriptures they the word of god comes to the prophets surely i will do nothing but reveal my secrets unto my servants the prophets the bible says how many is in agreement amen and we come out of amish i come out of army he can't dead sweats as good as he comes english yeah come from amish mennonite baptist pentecostal [Music] invisible union probably god says you know he used to say you know now he finds you a local church somewhere but towards the end when they put christ outside of the church and he was knocking trying to get back in huh because their thinking was different than what christ's thinking was they thought different they took their own thinking they lead to their own understanding then we had to come out of it come on be not partakers of our sentence you receive none of her plagues he called her the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth that great huh anytime you deny christ let me tell you something you can't expect to make it to heaven and say well i believe this portion of the word but i don't believe that part of the word my church teaches different right there you separate yourself from god because i don't care what church it is i don't care if it's this church huh this church better be preaching what this word says or it's wrong the bible says let every man's word be a lie and mind the truth that's the agreement amen you believe it so listen what he says and what communion has light with darkness it absolutely has no fellowship what was the quote says you know you can't be he makes a statement you can't be the bride of jesus christ in this hour and belong to some man-made denomination no you can't because they don't have no fellows they don't have any communion together you wouldn't sit here i want to say i wouldn't sit here but i'm here if i come up here and said something contrary to the word of god if this church was the brother's coming here with long hair huh not dressed right not do right not act right mostly our sisters is what shows what the church condition is isn't that right because we usually dress you know but our sister coming here they dress wrong they dress like a prostitute they look like one can't have them up in the sink because their skirts are too tight or they're wearing pants the bible calls with deuteronomy an abomination huh it used to be an abomination in the early 1900s but all of a sudden it become legal no no no no you used to give arrest them for many skirts but now all of a sudden no it's not okay just because you make it okay if it wasn't okay then it's not okay now a woman to cut her hair huh even pentecost they used to preach it you know paul says let it be shorn or shaven you know it's a shame right and it's a shame for a man to have long hair so it's just a shame for a woman to cut her hair i don't care what part of the word it is i want all of it don't you not just some of it because that's what that's why the whole world is going to hell it's because they just take some of the word you can't be a part of something like that you can't belong to something like that expect to be the bride of jesus christ amen why because you have no fellowship how many know jesus is coming one of these days what is he coming for when a boy meets a girl you want to date her and you want to get to know her real good vice versa to make sure you're on the right page the same page that you have the same goal that you think alike isn't that right because if you don't you have trouble down the road amen and jesus christ is coming for a bride for a people that think like he does how many wants to be lord let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus so that we can have fellowship we can have something to talk about amen when he says something we say amen amen you love him this morning amen all right we want to take the lord's supper and communion this morning so if you will we'll change the order to service stand with me if you will let's bow our heads with those few words how many in here just have a greater desire to think the way that you're supposed to the way that jesus wants you to think lord help me to think the right thought i've got his spirit i believe i'm holy spirit filled but sometimes thoughts want to come into my mind just like it did judas the devil put into his mind to betray him he put doubt in there even though he had walked with him all that time and we don't want to be no judas we don't want the devil to put any kind of thoughts in our mind this morning we just want to think his thoughts god bless those hands lord help us to think your thoughts and think the way that you want us to think the way we're supposed to be lord and we just ask god that you'd help us lord so that we could have divine fellowship with you on a daily basis in jesus name bless those hands now amen and amen god bless you this morning you love him now we have come we have feasted at his table we have fellowship around his word and around christ and this we realize that this is a symbol of his broken body and his blood that was shed for us so that we could have constant communion constant fellowship with jesus christ let's turn our bibles if you will to first corinthians you
