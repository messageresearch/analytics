How many's looking forward to a good day in the Lord? How many's come to worship the Lord? Amen. That's what we come to do, to worship him in spirit and in truth. God bless you this morning. Good morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. It is a good morning. Amen. Amen. We just want to open up service in prayer. I'm sure brother Amen. Joshua probably has some prayer requests, but let's just open up in prayer this morning. Dear heavenly father, as we come before you, Lord, gathering ourselves together for one purpose, Lord Jesus, like it was in the days of Job when the sons of God gathered themselves together to present themselves before the Lord. Lord, and we know that you see us, you see every good thing about us. You see every bad thing about us, Lord. So here we stand, Father, with open hearts and open minds, Lord, asking God that you'll search our hearts, see if there be any wicked way in us, Lord. And as you said in your prayer, deliver us from all evil, Father. And that's what we would desire this morning, God, that you'll help us to be better Christians when we leave today, Lord. And we ask God that you would just come Lord Jesus and by your Holy Spirit speak through the minister brother Chris Kathy this morning speak through him Lord Jesus. Use his lips father. Use his mind. Use his heart father. Use his spirit God Lord Jesus to minister to your people what we have need of today Lord. For we know that you're the same yesterday, today and forever. And Lord, you still can cause our hearts to burn along the way as you speak with us. Father, you know the needs, Father, this morning. And we commit this day, this morning's service, we commit our fellowship, dinner, our fellowship one with another. And then the evening service at 2:30. Again, we commit to you asking God that your divine will would be done. For we ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. You can be seated for a minute. I just want to talk to you for a couple of minutes before we start the worship service. Amen. First of all, I just want to Amen. Thank brother John. Amen. And Sister Alicia for all they've done out here with the with our property. Amen. With the bulldozer and stuff that he's done. Tens of thousands probably. I mean, it would a lot lot of lot of work he did. Amen. And we really really appreciate it. We're getting close to getting the pad ready back here or uh just graded. What we're doing it is we're just getting to get it ready so that whenever a year, two years, whatever, whatever time frame God has for us, if we see y'all decide to have a building there, we will. Amen. But I felt led just to go ahead and get that foundation and all done. And so that has went well. And I think right now, uh, Brother John, of course, he, uh, took all the logs off of it and we got like $3,200, Amen. for the logs. Amen. And we appreciate that. And so, uh, I think the bill for about 40. I thought when I first started doing it, I I told him, "Well, we're going to need about 10 loads of rock in here." Oh, my brother Joe come along. He said, "No, you're going to need a hundred. What are you talking about?" So, we were hoping to meet somewhere in the middle, you know, but Amen. So, I don't know. I think it's around 41. Brad said 49. 47. 47 loads that we've hauled so far. But, Amen. We appreciate Brother Joe. Amen. We was going to have to pay $275 a load. Amen. Brother Joe did a little of his business and got us uh got it up here at the rock quarry just about a mile up here. Ain't that right? Y'all see that big old pile, right? Amen. Got it for $175 a load. So that's, you know, it'll probably be at least the 6,000 at least $6,000 he saved by making a phone call. So that's the kind of guy he is though, is he? He's a businessman. whatever he touches it turns into pure gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we appreciate him. Amen. And of course, brother Brad also with what he's done. He's not here this morning with the work that he's done and so forth, but Amen. So any we do have uh eight $8,600 bill, I think, that we're going to try to pay tomorrow. Um and so but we did get 3,200 off of there. So, I think it's around I don't know, my math may be off, but it's somewhere around $5,500 that we have to come up with, but that's not just too bad, but we do need about He said, Brother John says about 20 more loads to get it right up to grade where we want it. So, that's supposed to happen Tuesday, Lord willing. Okay. And so, I was going to have an offering this morning towards that, but Amen. with so many gone and everything and we're not having it done yet, let's just wait till we get it all all in and then we'll tell you what we have need of and then we'll go maybe have an offering next weekend for that. Would that be okay? &gt;&gt; Amen. And if anybody has something you want to give in between or something, you just talk to brother Brian say, "Hey, you know, I just want to do I want to do this or whatever." Okay? But for everybody, give everybody a chance to be blessed. Amen. Amen. One more important very very important announcement we want to make and it's it's on a um I'm talking about whistles and bells kind of an announcement. Amen. Is that all right? Amen. Brother Gersham and Courtney stand up. They got engaged. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [Applause] Amen. Thank y'all. Congratulations. Congratulations. You can be seated. How long have y'all been dating? &gt;&gt; Three and a &gt;&gt; three and a half month. All right. Well, that's okay. Me and my wife, I think we're right at three months when we got engaged. We didn't we didn't mess around either. But anyway, so that's all right. Amen. When you find the right one, why wait, right? Amen. I drove up drove past them this morning and and they got out of their truck. I pulled up in here and I said to Donna, I said, "I hear wedding bells or something like that, didn't I, honey?" And so I came in here and Brother Willie said, "Hey, you can announce that they're going to get married." So I was like, "That's awesome." So praise the Lord. Everybody happy this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how we like it. God bless you. Let's worship the Lord. We'll turn it over. Amen. To Brother Joshua this morning. morning. May let's stand and we want to welcome our visitors all from out of town. Hope you feel welcome this morning. Amen. Let's sing. It was a great thing that he did for me.

He took my sins and he saved my soul. He cleaned me up and he made me whole. My Jesus died on Calvary so the whole wide world could see. It was a great thing that he did for me.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] Amen. Thank you, brother Glenn. We appreciate that. Amen. We're going to turn over to the word at this time and let's stand and listen. Let the worshippers arise this morning as brother Chris comes. who come expecting this morning. Amen. Let's just open up with hearts of worship and be ready to receive the word this morning. Whatever the Lord would have for us. Amen. Oh, Father, I see that you are drawing a line in the sand. I want to be standing on your side, holding your hand. So, let your kingom come. Let it live in me. This is my prayer. This is my plea. Let the worippers arise. [Music] Oh, let the sons and the daughters sing. I'm surrendering my all. [Music] I surrender to the king. And father, I hear it growing louder. The song of your redeem. As the saints of every nation are awakening a sing from our hearts there comes an anthem. Oh hear the heavens ring. This is our song a song to our king. Let the worshipers arise. Oh, let the sons and the daughters sing. Oh, I'm surrendering my all. I surrender to the king. And father I see a bride in power with full authority. She is claiming every promise and believing what she speaks. Every weapon formed against her has fallen at her feet. Oh hear her praise. Oh the king of kings. Let the worshippers arise. Oh, let the sons and the daughters sing. Oh, I'm surrendering my all to the king. All sing it. Let the worshippers arise. Let the sons and the daughters sing. I'm gendering my all. [Music] I surrender to the king. Aren't you thankful this morning? I was actually thinking that song as I was driving here this morning. I said, you know, I'm going to ask him to sing Let the Worshippers Arise. And I thought, God knows before we even asked. That's how much caring he is. He just says, hey, I'll confirm it today. I said, thank you for confirming it. Aren't you thankful? I believe we live in a time that it it's not a time to sit back and relax. &gt;&gt; I was thinking as I was driving over here, Brother Ber, I thought it's time to arise. Yeah, it &gt;&gt; it's not a time to sit back and relax. It's it's a time to buckle up and put on the armor and say, "God, I I'm moving forward." God didn't give you a message just to sit back and just relax. He didn't open just part of the book just to say, "Hey, he didn't set you free just to be like, I'm going to barely make it." But he's gave you a way. He's gave you a light. He He's gave you the greatest thing that's ever hit this planet. and he's calling you to arise. And we get up in the morning and we like we're about to die. We I it blows my mind that we get up in the morning and we're down and out. But we should put our feet on the ground and say, "God, I'm thankful for waking me up this morning. I'm thankful to know the truth." I tell you what, I I I come out of a Baptist home. I come out of a I call me the CEO Christian, Brother Ber. Uh I I came on uh uh what was it? Christmas, Easter, and other holidays. That's when I came to church. But I'm thankful that God gave me the truth that every time them doors are open, I don't care what we're on vacation. Yes. My wife, we're going to get fed. &gt;&gt; I I'm just that way. Because when you fall in love with the maker, &gt;&gt; when you fall in love with your God, when he becomes personal to you, &gt;&gt; when you realize you can't live without him, when you see sister Ber healed of cancer and you see things changing and you you God is the still same yesterday and today and forever. We serve a God. [Music] Oh my, I love him this morning. I like to brag on them. I like to talk about him. I'm not here to talk about me. I'm here to lift the one up that carried the load. He's carried it all for you today. May God bless you. I better stop. We'll be preaching all day long. But I'm here to tell you, God is good. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful. I just, you know, you going to call me a holy roller, whatever today, but I'm thankful to be called that today. &gt;&gt; I'm just, you know, they say, "Chris, you're a nut." I said, "Well, I want to leave me that way. I'm happy that way." I tell you, the more I've been in this message, it's been nothing but good. &gt;&gt; This message has been nothing but good. It, you know, it's took me years and years to to grow in wisdom and strength and but I'm I'm so thankful every day he's working on me. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful he's working on me. May God bless you. God bless you, saints. You may be seated. I hope it's okay. I was asking my wife, would she could she sing a song this morning if you don't mind? Uh I just had this song on my heart, too, and I hopefully she can encourage you today. We thank you in the name of Jesus Christ. Brother Larry Harris sends his greetings. We moved to Campbellville, Kentucky. Brother Wade was there and um we're kind of like two hours away on the opposite side of you now. I was looking on the map trying to figure out where where everybody was, but we're like two hours on the opposite side. And I'm just thankful there's bride AC. I was driving here and I thought we passed all these churches and I thought young people you should be blessed today that there's plenty of people going to church but who has the key to unlock the door? &gt;&gt; And I pulled up brother Ber and I thought here's another church that has the key to unlock the door. &gt;&gt; You know that it ain't not it's it's grace. It's grace. It's it's nothing you've done. It's just what God has done for you. &gt;&gt; He's gave you grace in this day. May this song bless you this morning. [Music] &gt;&gt; There we go. &gt;&gt; Sorry. Sometimes I fall to my knees and pray. Come Jesus, come. Let today be the day. Sometimes I feel I'm going to break, but I'm holding on to a hope that won't fade. Come Jesus, come. We've been waiting so long for the day you return to heal every hurt and write every wrong. [Music] We need you right now. Come and turn this around. Deep down I know this world isn't home. Come Jesus, come. There'll be no war. And there'll be no chains when Jesus comes. Let today be the day he'll come for the weak and the strong just the same and all will believe in the power of his name. Sing it with me. Come Jesus, come. We've been waiting so long for the day you return. To heal every hurt and write every wrong. We need you right now. Come and turn this around. Deep down I know this world isn't home. Come Jesus come. One day he'll come and we'll stand face to face. Come and lay it all down. Cause it might be today. The time is right now. There's no need to wait. Your past will be washed by rivers of grace. Come Jesus, come. We've been waiting so long for the day you return to heal every hurt and write every wrong. We need you right now. Come and turn this around. Deep down I know this world isn't home. Come Jesus, come. Come Jesus, come. We've been waiting so long for the day you return to heal every hurt and write every wrong. We need you right now. Come and turn this around. Deep down I know this world isn't home. Come Jesus, come. [Music] Father, we truly just come before your throne today, God. We're needy people, Father. God, I ask we read these words, Father, and don't take it lightly. May it come through every aisle, come every through every heart. May you come through my heart, God. May be delivered in love and God, not out of selfish or motives, but God, you would speak today. We come to hear from you, Lord. And God, may you encourage your people. Whatever it is, Lord, we just love you, Father. We're just so looking for your coming, Lord. It's I believe it's anytime. And I I believe we're standing at the door, Lord, and we've put some of the world is the most of the world has put you on the outdoor knocking. But God, we've opened our heart today. And we say, Lord, come in and change our lives. And God, let us be a fire on the hill that serves you, Lord, with everything we got. Forgive us of our failures, Lord. May you speak your only what you'd have speak this morning. We love you. Bless this church. Bless your people. Bless brother Ber, faithful pastor. bless him today. Encourage him in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you today. We we God we we greet you in the name of Jesus. We uh I don't if you've known me, but I'm Chris Kathy. That's Rachel. Kathy. I got my son Isaac. He's about 6 foot three now. He I have to look up to him. Uh Joseph is uh catching up. And uh man, it's time's flying. Um I thought I thought this morning I'm like, man, I I I'm going out and he's going up. So So you can tell my wife still feeds me well. So, but I'm thankful that God feeds us the most. And um thankful, brother Ber, for having us. And I do count it an honor to be before you today. And I don't count it lightly because I believe you're God's children. And uh I just I I this could be my last service. And I just this could be your last service. Listen, I just let's enter in today. Let's come expecting. Brother Bram says you get expecting what you came for today. So, if you came for just a crumb, then you're going to get a crumb. But I I drove through here and I said, "Lord, I I really want to be spoke to this morning. I even myself." And may God really speak this morning. God bless you as we turn this morning uh to Ephesians uh Ephesians chapter 5. Very, very familiar scripture. Ephesians 5 verse uh verse one. We're just going to go through that this morning. Ephesians 5 verse one. This is just kind of what God kept leading me back through last night and just thinking on what God had to speak on. But Ephesians uh 5:1 uh we're going to go through this. It says, it says in Ephesians 5:1, it says, "Be ye therefore followers of God as as dear ch dear children and walk in love." I believe a lot of times in this message that we might know the book, we might know we you might have been raised in the message. I wasn't raised in the message, but I, you know, I tell you what, people doesn't care what you got to say. People don't care what you how many quotes you know if you're not walking in love. Um, it says, "Walk in love as Christ also had loved us and had given himself for us. An offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savior." Aren't you thankful that we have a sweet smelling savior that just loves us? And I'm just building to this. And I like what it says in verse four. It says, "We are not required to be perfect." Aren't you thankful that you're not required to be perfect, but to receive his love? You know, a lot of times we think we got to be perfect. And young people, you think you got to I got to be the most per you're going to fail. But aren't you thankful that God that God died for you? all that he all your sins, everything that you've done, you know, you're going to fall, but I'm here to tell you to get back up. &gt;&gt; You know, get back up. He says, we are not you, we are not required, but we're perfect. Uh we're not required to be perfect, but we receive his love. Verse five, we cannot earn God's favor. It's free given freely. Aren't you thankful of that? &gt;&gt; Um and then uh um it goes on, I want to read that verse uh uh verse sorry, I think I read the wrong thing. Sorry. But verse verse uh two, go back to verse two. It says, "And walk in love as Christ hath loved us, has given himself for as an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet smoke." Verse three, "But fornification, uncleanness and covetousness. Let us not once named among you as become saints." Verse four, it says, "Neither filthiness, nor foolish talk, nor jesting, which are not covenant, but rather giving of thanks. For this ye know, that no homonger, nor unclean person, nor uh covenant man, and the idoltor, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words. Beau uh for because of these things come in wrath. It says, the God of God upon the children of a disobedience. But ye but not ye therefore be takers of them, for ye were sometimes darkness. Aren't you thankful that you could say, "I was sometimes darkness, but now you are light." I love that scripture because, you know, we were all caught in that that that that light that we were sometimes darkness, but now you are yet light in the Lord. Walk as children of light. For verse 9, for the fruit of the spirit is all what? &gt;&gt; Goodness and truth. In righteousness and truth. Aren't you thankful? It's all good. There ain't nothing God that that you can say today that God hasn't been good to you. &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm here to tell you that the devil gives you bad days, but God doesn't give you a bad day. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful of that? Verse uh 10, it says, "Provening what is acceptable unto the Lord." And it says, "Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness." And it goes on to say, "Uh, but rather reprove them." In other words, expose them. In verse 12 it says, "For it is a shame even to speak to those things which are done of them in secret, but in all things that are reproved and made manifest by the light. For whomsoever doeth make manifest in the light." It says, "Wherefore," he said, I like what he says here. This is the Lord speaking. He says, "Wherefore," he saith, "Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thy life." You may be seated. May God had his blessings. And I I'm He said to sing that song, let the worshippers arise. And I thought how great that song is. Because we live in a time that I believe that the bride needs to wake up. &gt;&gt; I believe we live in a time that, brother Ber, we live in a time that that that the message has become common to us. That we've grown up in the message. We've lived in a home that's grown up in the message. But but really I I believe the Lord is saying today in verse 14, he says, "Awake thou that sleepeth." &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I I've got up at 5 4:00 on plane flights for work and I uh about every other week and you get to the motel room and you you want to set up a wakeup call cuz your flight's at 6:00, but you got to get up at 3:00 and then the only person is awake is the pilot and God. I mean, I'm just being honest this morning. You know, you get up, you get to the you get there and everybody's asleep. They walk on the plane, they they get to the plane, they get I'm just bringing life to you today, but you get to the airport and you feel like, man, is the air is even the captain awake. You know, you you look down through the hall and you get on the plane and you look through there and you go, "M, I hope the captain's awake cuz I'm not awake that this morning." And I thought, but you know, we serve a God that doesn't sleep. We serve a God that doesn't sleep on you. I don't care what time of morning it is. I don't care what time you get on your knees, what time you call on God. Our God is a 24-hour God that doesn't sleep. That's always a caring God that says, "Hey, while you're sleeping, I'm still watching over you." &gt;&gt; That's our God today. But it says, "Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead." And I'm here to tell you today, I was reading that. And I was looking that up, brother Ber the other night and I was really studying that and I thought, "Wow." And they used to read this back in the day when they would baptize somebody, they would actually put them under the water and they would actually recite these words, "Awake thou that sleepest from the dead." And meaning that your old flesh, maybe you haven't been baptized today, but I'm here to tell you, don't wait. Don't wait to get a God. Don't wait to get an axe experience with God. Don't wait to get God on the inside. Don't wait to let the Holy Spirit change your life. &gt;&gt; But he says, "Wherefore awake, awake that sleepeth and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thy life." Verse 15 says, "See then that we walk circumstantly not as fools but as wise." Verse uh 16, redeeming the time because the days are evil. &gt;&gt; And I just want to speak a few minutes on this on this thought, redeeming the time. I believe we live in a time that time is going so fast you can't keep up. I believe we're living in such a busyness of life. The devil keeps us busy, young people. He keeps you busy with social media. He keeps you busy with social your phone. He keeps you busy. I tell you, I was at a store the other day, Brother Ber, and this young kid was doing this and literally hid the wall. Hid the wall. He didn't even look up. He just hid the wall. I said, "That's the time we live in that go that the devil wants to keep you so busy, young people, that you don't have no time for God. And God is still waiting for you to come back to your first love. &gt;&gt; He We're in a time that everything's running fast. We're we're in a time that is busy." And I said, "You know what busy stands for? Being under Satan's yoke. &gt;&gt; Being under Satan's yoke." God. The devil wants to keep you so yolked up in even your job or whatever you're doing that you'll even miss Wednesday nights. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's okay to miss a little Wednesday night here and there. It's okay to maybe miss a Sunday, but no. Have you ever missed the gas station when you went by when it was almost on E? No, &gt;&gt; I have. I'm going to be honest. &gt;&gt; My car didn't run that good, Brother Ber. I I kind of started putting. But maybe some of you felt like I barely got here today, but you're here. And maybe you didn't feel like getting out of the bed today. And maybe you feel like you just put along in life. But I'm here to tell you, let God come on and change that attitude. Let God fill you up. Maybe you say, "Brother Chris, my joy is empty." Well, guess what? He'll give you some more joy today. Whatever you need today. Well, I tell you, aren't you thankful that we got a little gauge? And sometimes, I mean, there's not every day that I feel like waking up. And there's been days I'm like, "Oh gosh, I got to preach today. Oh, my barely can feel my body. I'm not feeling good." But I'm here to tell you, it's not about your feelings today. &gt;&gt; It's not about how we feel. It's it's about we just come here and say, "God, you have control. You have control of my life." But now, we live in a time that we need to redeem our time back. The devil's trying to steal your family's time, your devotion time, your prayer time, your everything in your life. The devil wants to take up in your family's life, fill it with games, and hey, they're all good in their place. In volleyball, I saw all that's good in his time. But God wants to fill you young people. He wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He wants to give you a life that's worth living. Maybe you're maybe you say, "Well, my family don't do this. My dad don't pray. My mama don't read the Bible." Well, guess what? You read the Bible. &gt;&gt; You pray. You read your scriptures every day. You listen to the prophet. If your parents don't listen to it, you listen to it. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, we're living in a time, brother Wade, that we need to redeem our time back. We don't have I tell you, I'm 43 years old and as time goes, I'll be 50 and 60. Before you know it, Isaac's going to already he just got his permit the other day. And I said, "Lord Jesus." I said, "Son," I said, "I guess I need to practice and you need the prayer." But I started to realize, "Where is time going?" Hey, just before a blink of an eye, you're a grandparent or whatever. And these young people look at us like we're crazy, but they'll say the same thing. &gt;&gt; But we're living in a time. We have the greatest message of the hour. We have the whole book revealed before you from Genesis to Revelation. What are you doing with it? It's time to take the sword and say, "Lord, wherever you want me, I'll follow. If I'm the if I'm the housewife, I'll be the best housewife. If I be the I'll be the Sunday school teacher, I'll be the best Sunday. If I'll be a leoty, I'll be the best leoty." &gt;&gt; If he tells me to clean the bathrooms, I'll clean it the best I can. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But I like redeeming the time. I wrote this down. I was looking this up. Redeeming the time. And it it talks about a word called chyros. Chyros meaning it's a time that we look back at. In the Greek word, we look at chyros as like on your watch. You look at your time every day. I You're probably looking at your time. When's he going to be quiet? But I but I'm here to tell you, we're living in a Kronos time, brother. That's in a time that that's in a different atmosphere. &gt;&gt; That's in God's time when he says one day is a thousand years. A thousand years is a day. And I tell you what, we it's still there. It's it's dark out here. It looks light. We were leaving the house. It looked It looked dark, but I'm telling you, it's it's dark in out here. But it's light and go tonight. It's light in this building today. Aren't you thankful? He says, I like redeeming the time. It comes from the Greek word. It says extra orzo. It says it means to buy up, to purchase, or rescue from the loss. Aren't you thinking that God rescued you from where you were one day? &gt;&gt; Maybe you were in a p maybe you're in a pool room. Maybe you were in a Baptist church like me. Maybe you just went to church on Christmas, Easter, and the holidays. But God has redeemed you back. He's took you from the pawn shop and he's gave you something to live for. He's gave you something to not just wake up and go, "Well, I see it every day. People wake up and they they get in their bed and then they go they say, "God, God, lay me down to sleep." And then they get up and they It's just terrible to get up. But I'm here to tell you, I tell you, you should wake up and say, "God, what do you want me to do today for you? Who you want me to witness to today? Redeem your time back." Because the devil is Man, I need to remind you, church, the devil is under your feet today. He's not. He's under your feet. And I tell you, it should put something inside of you to say, "I'm a called out child of God." &gt;&gt; That I didn't just come here. We got to remind the devil who our daddy is. &gt;&gt; We need to remind the devil who he is. I heard brother Donnie say at the meetings, he said when he took the keys, I loved it. He said when he took the keys of of heaven and hell, he come down there and took it from the devil of hell, he kicked the door open. And he said all of a sudden all the selfies he had. You know what selfies are? Maybe you don't, but but you know when that young people do. And he said all of a sudden he took the keys of the of hell. And he said all of a sudden all his selfies of everybody he thought he had started falling off the wall. It started falling off the wall. I said, "Brother Donnie, that's the truth. I thought about us. How many selfies the devil took of you and had took of me? But God redeemed the time. He's redeemed you. He's called you out. He's gave you a light. He's gave you a purpose. When it says redeem in the time, verse 16, verse 17, it says, "Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what will of the Lord is." Verse 18, it says, "And be not drunk with wine, wearing in excess, but be filled with the spirit, speaking to yourselves through psalms and hymns, I love this, and spiritual songs." Young people, Taylor Swift ain't a spiritual song. I I'm sorry to say that today, but Taylor Swift and all this craziness out here is not a spiritual song. It's nothing but the pits of hell coming through these radio stations that's coming after you on your Facebook ads and every single thing he can get you in. He is trying to take your time somewhere you shouldn't be. &gt;&gt; I pray it's a blessing today. He says, "And then be not drunk with the wine." Verse 19, "Speak yourselves in psalms and spiritual songs." Find something that's genuine. Find something that that that that you know, you look behind it and know how they wrote the song. Don't just look at and go, "That's a great song." They might be a devil worshipper just singing a song about God. &gt;&gt; I tell you, we got to redeem the pond. Verse 20, giving thanks always for all things unto God in the Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I tell you, that's hard to do sometimes when you're going through the hardest trial of your life and just say, "Lord, I'm going to give thanks always no matter what it is." &gt;&gt; That's hard to do when you when they call you and say, "You got two months to live." And say, "God, I still love you. I still care for you. You you're still my all and all." &gt;&gt; Submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of God. I like this translation. and he doesn't have that. But another translation says, "Be in uh imitators of God in everything you do. For then you will represent your father and the beloved sons of God and continue to walk surrendered to the extravagant love of Christ." I thought, man, Lord, let me walk in a every single day. I don't have but so much time in a day. And how much time have I set aside for God? Yeah. &gt;&gt; How much time have I set aside at night to say, "God, I do thy lay me down to sleep." I'm preaching to me today, too. I'm here to tell you, we got to redeem our time back. &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about a Cairo time, a time that we look at and it's 11:32. But God doesn't look at time like that. God looks at a time and he goes, "Hey, when we pass on, I I bet he looks at you go, "Whoa, hey, it's good to see you, Brother Chris. It's only been two minutes. you've lived two minutes. But for us, we feel like it's been 50 years and 70 years and we look at the calendar, but but but God has pointed us to look at Israel and look at the wars and rumors. But church, I believe we're here. &gt;&gt; I believe we're right at the door and the ark doors closing. And I want to tell you today, if you don't see me again, I'm here to tell you to get while there while there's grace of God. Get to the ark right now and say, "God, I surrender my life. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I surrender my soul. I surrender my life. Young people, young girls, uh just give it your all. And you know what, young people, don't marry somebody that doesn't love God. &gt;&gt; Your life will be so miserable. Find somebody that loves God more than you love them. &gt;&gt; Find somebody that really loves God that not just talk the wall and say the message quotes, but find somebody that really loves God. Amen. &gt;&gt; As he was saying, someone got engaged. Congratulations. And I thought, I remember that day. It wasn't It didn't last long. You get engaged, it's like, let's go. Let's go. You know, you don't want to be It's just, you know, they're the one. You know, you're the one. But I I'm thankful for that. But I thought, young people, redeem your time back. Don't waste your time dating filth of the world. &gt;&gt; I don't know why it's not in my notes, but don't waste your time dating filth of the world that, you know, they don't love God. you know it. You They don't love God. They listen to Taylor Swift. They listen to all these other trash people and all of a sudden come to church and just say, "Well, I want God today." And all they're doing is just sitting there waiting to to pry on you. But I'm here to tell you, God, find somebody that's sold out to God. &gt;&gt; They're sold out to this message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I don't know. It's not in my notes. I didn't bring I didn't bring all them notes, but God just speaking this morning. [Music] But it says, I like this one one scripture in this one verse. It's a different in verse 14. It says, "Awake, oh sleeper, rise from the dead in Christ and he'll give you light. Be careful how to you live. Don't live like fools." But but like who's that who that are wise. I like what it says right here. Uh it talks about brother Brandham the prophet of God says he said this is the hour. He said, "This is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into." He said, "Just before the coming of the bridegroom, oh, the real church of the living God ought to be on fire." &gt;&gt; I mean, this is 1964. He says the real church should be living on fire. I believe that half the time we travel, I don't know why we got a wet blanket on us. I'm here to tell you need to get a little fire on the inside. You need to get a little reviving today. Say, "God, revive me today. I'm tired of living stagnant. I'm the way. I'm tired of just barely getting through." He didn't save you to barely get through. He saved you to put you on your feet and conquer the devil. Oh, he's conquered death hell in the grave. He's not a halfway God. He's not a God that just saves you. Say, "Well, you just live through life." And you know what, brother Chris? Well, I'm just going to get up this morning. No, he gave you something to praise him about. He set you free. He's gave you the keys to open the door. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, I I always pray. I said, "Boys, you get some of this. Don't get what get get what daddy's got." That's like that one preacher would say, "Hot dog, he's got it." I'm here to tell you, get something real. Get something that will change your life. redeem the time back. But he says just before the coming of the bridegroom, oh the real church of the living going ought to be on fire, burning with the light of the gospel being vindicated among them. Rise and shine for the light has come to you. The light of this this day, he says, I like what he says, rise and shine. He said, the light of this day, Isaiah was the light of his day. Noah was the light of his day. Why? He had the word manifest. &gt;&gt; Oh, he said in the gospel, the Bible, the word of this day, the light of this day. What a glorious time we're living. &gt;&gt; And you know what? The light has come in your day &gt;&gt; and my day. And I tell you, we're going to be held accountable for what we've been seeing. &gt;&gt; You know what? They don't they don't see it. I heard the prophet say the other day on the tape, he said, "I'm not against them people. I'm against the organizations." There's great people in all these church that that that that that grow up and they all they can see. But God has gave you the entire book. &gt;&gt; He's gave you the entire revelation open before your eyes and we still don't redeem the time back &gt;&gt; and say, "God, when I get home, I'm going to dedicate the next 30 days. I'm going to say, God, I'm going to I'm going to pray to you more. I'm going to read my Bible more. I'm going to listen to these tapes more. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have every app. I'm tell you what, I was overseas last year in Ecuador. &gt;&gt; I'm tell you, we are blessed people. &gt;&gt; I got in a car and I rode down. I said, "We, Brother Ber," I said, "I'm going on a missionary trip and I thought, wow, I got in here just kind of joined the military." When I was in the military, I joined it for the GI Bill. I'm just being honest. I joined it to pay for college, but when it was time for war and they said, "Hey, you're going to Iraq." I was like, "I didn't sign up for this. I signed up. I'm being honest. I signed up for the GI Bill, not this. I'm here to tell you, when you sign up to be a Christian when you sign up to accept this message, put on it on the whole armor of God. Hey, the devil's going to come at you. Your family's going to destroy come at you. Family members, your kids, your grandchildren. But I'm here to tell you, it's time to take a stand and say, "God, I will stand for this truth." Like Sister Hattie Wright said, it's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; I know you're all going to say, "Well, uh, y'all just get this crazy guy out of here." But I'm here to tell you, I love Jesus. I love this message. Every single day, Brother Ber, it gets sweeter. &gt;&gt; It's it it just it did the book become a new book to me. And when the problem is today, the book hasn't became a new book to you and me. And when it becomes a new book and you realize what he's done for you, &gt;&gt; you'll redeem the time. &gt;&gt; You'll redeem the the nonsense of this or social media. The other night I was on my phone. I was scrolling through it. Maybe you had done this and I said, "Lord, I'm putting this nonsense down." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because all the time we'll sit there and we just look this and look down. I said, "Lord, I started praying the other night. I said, "Lord, let me get I control this phone, not the phone controls me. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of it. The devil wants you to do this all day long and you can't talk or you can't do this and all of a sudden you're asleep." And I said, "Lord, forgive me. &gt;&gt; I'm being honest. I'm being real. I'm just being real with you. I hope that's okay. I'm just being real. I just because I got a tie on doesn't mean I don't fail." And I'm here to tell you, just because I'm a preacher today, I'm here to tell you an hour on Facebook. I'm just being honest with you today. I'm here to tell you, God will go whatever time he can get to you. The devil will come to you every which way. If it's on your job, he'll make you work. I can make extra money and not go to church. Let me tell you, that's not the will of God. That's not the will of God to go move somewhere. Someone said to me one time, "Brother Ber," they said, "Well, we're going to move all the way over here." And I said, "Is there a church?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to make really good money. I'm going to make hundreds of thousands. I said, first of all, I don't care how much money you're going to make. Is there a church that will feed your family? &gt;&gt; Is there a church that stands for the message of the hour? So too many times we we look at that that oh well I look at this and I look at this number and look at this well it'll help my family. No, it'll actually pull you farther away from God. &gt;&gt; That ain't in my notes. But I'm here to tell you if you're looking to move away make sure they have a church that loves God. &gt;&gt; There has a pastor like brother Ber so many years been standing for the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; People are falling by the wayside. Kids and youth and families are falling apart because they don't redeem the time &gt;&gt; and put Jesus Christ where he should be put. &gt;&gt; Chasing things of this world is nonsense. I'm here to tell you it says in my Bible it says, "Seek ye the kingdom of the first and everything else will be added." I told the boys the other day, I said, "Boys, you listen. If something happens to daddy, you seek the kingdom with everything that's within you and then everything else will be. Don't do it the other way. Don't put it the other way. You put it out of order, it don't work. &gt;&gt; But too many times we put it out of order in God and but we need to redeem the time. But I was thinking talking about that pilot. You get on the airplane and you think about the time and you think about how early it is. But have you ever just messed the wake up call? Have you ever set your alarm and you didn't hear it and you're and 30 minutes passed or an hour passed and you're like, "Man, I got called this. I got to tell him, I'm sorry I'm late. I overslept." I'm here to tell you, you don't want to oversleep on God. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you, you got the greatest thing that ever hit you today. And I'm here to tell you to redeem your time and say, "Lord, I want to walk with this light that I got. I want to be a blessing to the world. I don't care if they're on my job. I don't care if they're at the gas station. I don't care where they're at. They might not look like you, but that might be the very person that God wants to call in. &gt;&gt; Too many times in the message, we go, "Oh, well, let me go measure your hair and let me go look at your shoes and let me look at your pants." You know what? I came out of a church. I didn't have any of that. I had shorts on, believe it or not. But God called me out. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Too many times we we got these measuring tapes and we Oh, by the way, Brother Ber, let me see how big them hit. You know what? Stop worrying about them. Just pour the love of God on them. &gt;&gt; Let God do the cleaning. &gt;&gt; Just invite them to church. Let God do the cleaning. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It could be the very person on your job today that we're waiting on. &gt;&gt; It could be at the gas pump today. It could be the person the bomb sitting there. Whoever it is, I'm just telling you to be salty. &gt;&gt; Be salty today. Redeem your time. I like that. He said, "Be on fire. We ought to be so on fire for God." I tell you what, I I'm just watching these people leaving the message like drove. Like just off the scenes. I said, "It's insanity. I I don't understand because if the Bible become a new book and the whole book has been open. &gt;&gt; I heard someone say the other day, brother Ber, they said, "Well, they went they actually went to a church, left a message." He said, "Well, I don't believe just like that, but I believe a serpent seed." And I'm like, "That's just nonsense." You know what? You either believe it 100% or you don't. I believe it all the way. 100%. I'm thankful for it. I looked this word up, Kronos. It says it's the Greek word is the time. It's the minutes and the hours, the days and years. But God's in chairos time. The Greek word meaning it's it's a moment. It's God's season. It's God's appointed time. I believe I was thinking about uh we just went through 911 again. Like 23 years has passed since 911. And then you have that Charlie Kirk one life 33 years old. I thought stand up for God. don't even know the message of the hour, but stood up for God. Died as a martyr. And I thought he redeemed the time. There's people going to church. Maybe not a message church, but they're going to church praying more. And one life said, "Lord, let me be that life." &gt;&gt; I had the greatest truth. Let me redeem my time back where young people and older people could say, "You know what? I want to be on fire like he's got it." people buying shirts and this and by God people are going to I mean the re ratio of people getting back to church blows my mind. How about the bride of Christ today? How about the bride that I'm speaking of today? You might have come down and out. You might have barely made it to church, but I'm here to tell you say, "God, refill me today. Give me some more fire." Maybe a mother's down today. Oh, I thought about this. Paul urged the believers to redeem the time. He says, "Because the days are evil." Ephesians 5:16. He's not just managing hours, but he's se he's seizing God's opportunities. He's saying, "Hey, you have opportunity for God. You have a certain amount of time." Every one of us in here are allotted a certain amount of time. &gt;&gt; There's people in the hospital today. There's babies being born that are on incubators. There's babies there's babies that are on life support today. There's babies that passed away. There's young kids that just got hit in a car wreck. There we all have an appointed time. &gt;&gt; But what are you doing with your time? &gt;&gt; That's what I'm here to ask you today. What are you doing with your time? What am I doing with my time? I say, Lord, forgive me. Lord, let me redeem my time. Luke 2:49. And it said unto them, "How is it that you be you you you sought you sought me? Witz ye not that I must be about my father's business." I like that scripture because he talks about it talks about a time that he should be about his father's business. I believe that we live in a time that we should be about our father's business. We live in such an hour that the Russia could pull the bomb any day. But aren't you glad that we live in a time that God is on the inside? And when they push that last that before that first bomb drops, the bride will be singing farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer. I'm loving it. I'm waiting for his I'm looking every day for his coming. Brother Ber, I know you are. Every single day, every single day, I said, Lord, could this be the day? Could this be the very hour that my mom walks through the door and says, "Boy, what you been preaching about? What you been living about? Come on, let's go." &gt;&gt; That's the hour I'm living for. That's the hour as I get older, younger, younger generation, you'll realize as you get older, that's what you live for is Jesus Christ alone. &gt;&gt; You can't breathe without him. You can't walk without him. You can't go to your job without him. You can't pay your bills without them. &gt;&gt; You can't pump the gas like we did earlier without him. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm thankful that we serve a God that cares. &gt;&gt; Oh my I thought about I thought about this Galatians talking about time. Actually, let's turn to Psalms 39:4-5 about time. It says that it says the Lord make me to know t mine end and the measure of my days. He says what it is that I may know how def fril I am but th how hast made my days as a handbreath and my age is as nothing before thee. Verse uh James 4, turn to James 4. I like that it says James 4:14. Where is you? You know not what shall be tomorrow? For what is your life? We're talking about a time. We're talking about redeeming the time, young people. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appearth for a little while and vanished away. I hope Brother Ber don't don't get me on this. But I thought about that scripture just a minute ago and if he could put that on the screen, James 4:14. But I thought about that back there and as I was praying and I thought, you know, for what is your life? It says for young people it says it's even a vapor but it pierced for a little while and vanished m I said how can I pure a vapor so I thought that's your vapor &gt;&gt; that's how much your life means in the time of choros time but in God's time that's young people that's how much time we have that I hope this sticks with you today more than everything it has that that's how much time your life is and it becomes a vapor and you don't see it anymore more. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you to live that vapor of life, to live that life, young people, all whatever age you are, to live that vapor the best you can. &gt;&gt; May this paper stick with you all. I'm going to have to buy him a whole new thing of lens cleanser. Sorry, brother, but I thought about that's how long your life is. I'll mail it to you, brother. I'll do Amazon. But I thought today, brother Wade, that's how long we have of time. &gt;&gt; It's here for a little while and it's gone. And you know, we just buried my father-in-law that believe this message with all his heart. And I thought, we're ordering this and they're trying to order the grave, the the grave marker. They're trying to figure that out. And I thought, we got out there and they got the little hash mark in between your name and it says, "I live from this day to this day." Okay, it's a start and a finish. But you know what? That's a good thing. But I want to know what matters. What matters the most is the hash. Is what matters the most? What you're doing for God now through the years that he alllighted you? What are you doing with God? Are you leaving a true mark for Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; With that little dash there, there means something went on from this day to this day. And I want to say, hey, that man loved Jesus Christ with all he's got. Hey, Chris fell, but he got back up. He failed every He I fall every day. But I'm here to tell you, it's about getting back up, young people. You make a mistake, it's going to happen. Get back up. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, forgive me." And move forward. Too many times we live like we're through the rearview mirror. Like brother Bram says, we get ragged up. We get ragged up on the side of the road. My son just got the the permit and he's trying to adjust the windows. Sorry, Isaac, but he he's just in this. He's just in that. how you adjust this and I mean I'm praying I'm saying Lord Jesus we hope we make it today but he's doing really good but he's adjusting this he's just that's how our is always adjusting something of us even at 43 years old he's saying you know what put the phone up and talk to your wife do something for God do this talk to this person he's always adjusting us &gt;&gt; that's like when you get on a plane they adjust the wings and they're flying in and they get through turbulence and they adjust them and you know what a lot of times they'll adjust them down and you'll see you'll start maybe there's a pilot in here and they'll adjust them and all of a sudden they'll start going up and they'll be in a storm and all of a sudden all of a sudden you get to you'll be in the darkest storm and all of a sudden you see just clouds of shininess. I tell you it would do us some good today to get get the darkness out of our life and start looking what God sometimes we just need to write down what God's done for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. just take a note. I bet you couldn't fill up a page of what God has done for you. You would have pages on top of pages on top of pages of what go how God the goodness of God in your life. &gt;&gt; The goodness I pray this is okay this morning. But but it would do you some good to write down and say God and stop using God as a checklist and say, "Well, God, I need this today and I need that today and I need I've been w I've been living in that life. I need this today." No. Just tell God how much you love him. &gt;&gt; Just tell God. Say when you wake up, say, "God, I want to redeem my time today. I want to be the best mother. I want to be the best father. I want to be the best employee. I want to be the best boss today. I whatever he tells you to be, just be it for him. &gt;&gt; Just redeem your time." We live in an hour that he's taking our time up. The devil is just bomb. I don't know about you, but he's bombarding your minds. I like Ephesians. if if you could turn there. Ephesians how we read that. But I flipped over there this morning in Ephesians 6 verse 10. It says, "Finally, my brethren," this is right after we're talking about redeeming the time. Chapter 6 10. It says, "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord." &gt;&gt; Brother Brown preaches a message, the greatest battle ever fought. I just wrote that down. He says, uh, "Be strong in the Lord in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may able to stand against the ws of the devil. He's equipped you today. Verse 12, for the wrestle not against flesh of blood, but against principalities, against powers. Most people almost recite this, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual witness in high places. We have arrived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have arrived in this hour. &gt;&gt; Verse 13. Wherefore take ye upon the take ye onto the whole armor of God that you may able to withstand in this evil day. Having done all to stand therefore having your lord your loins gird about with truth and having on the breath of righteousness and your foot shaw with the preparations of the gospel of the peace. Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherein you shall able to quench all the fiery darts of the of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation with the sword of the spirit, which is the word of the God. Aren't you thankful that you have the word of God that you can defeat the devil anywhere, any place, and anyhow, &gt;&gt; that you don't just have Aren't you thankful that you're not in a Baptist church today, that you came to church today, that the entire book has been open? I'll tell you, my dad still looks at me like, "Son, hey," he called me today. He said, "Hey, I want to come visit you and the boys." And I, you know, I grew up home, a very broke up home. And dad said, "Hey, I want to come visit the boys. I don't want to go to church, but I just want to see the family." I said, "Well, I I'm sorry, but I'll be in church. You can come visit us, but I tell you what, we going to church when the doors are open. I don't care if I'm speaking or not. I'm going to church. I need church. I need to be You know what? I need you and you need me. Believe it or not, we need we live in an hour and we need each other. We need each other more than we've ever need each other. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Dad, I tell you what, I'm sold out for Jesus Christ." 21 years ago, when I saw the message, I said, "Lord, this I'm thankful that you brought me in." &gt;&gt; My grandmother, I remember leaving for the military. She handed me two books. Maybe you've heard this before. She handed me Jezebel religion and why we're non- denomination. I tell you what, brother Ber, I was in them barracks in the military. I lit that place up. Like I was I'm telling you, I was crazy for I said, "Lord, let me be on fire in these barracks. Let me change a life." I didn't go in there shoved the whole message cuz I didn't know the whole message. I just come in there with love of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm tell you one morning, I'll never forget the drill sergeants w I'm talking about redeeming your time. The drill sergeant walked into the room and we had Bible study. It was 2:00 in the morning. I'll never forget I was in Leonardwood, Missouri. I call it Lost in the Woods. And we were in Lynwood, Missouri. And Brother White, Brother Wade, I was in there and we were having Bible study at 2:00 in the morning. The drill sergeant came by to see what we were doing. We're supposed to be asleep. We're having revival. I mean, brother, brother, I'm just being honest. I redeemed the time. I got in there. We were talking about God. We were talking about the Bible. I was trying to teach about service seed and barely knew about serene and I started just started eating the word. &gt;&gt; I started young people eating the word. &gt;&gt; Read the word and let it become real to you. &gt;&gt; And that's when it started becoming real to me and I was like I want them to go I want them to get what I got. &gt;&gt; And I started eating the word and and the drill sergeant walked in. He goes, "What are you doing, Mr. Kathy?" I said, "We just having church. Is that okay? He said, "No, it's not." He said, "You know what? Y'all go to bed. You're going to do lunges the rest of the night." And I thought about he he had this he had this log. I hope this is okay. He had this log and he called it had on the side of it was desire. It had written desire on it. He said, "You're going to become best friends with desire." He made me take that log and he said, "I want you to walk up and down the hallway and I want you to do lunges till the morning till you see sunlight." I started doing lunges down the hall and as I would do one I would just say thank you God. Thank you God. And you know what? About two hours passed and I thought about what God done for me. About 2 hours passed I started getting really tired and weary and my legs started shaking and I wanted to drop the log. And then three hours passed and four hours pass and I got down to the end of the mall and I said, "God, this ain't nothing what you done for me. You carried a cross on a hill called Galtha. You died for my sins. You redeemed me. That's what he's done for you. That's what he's done for me this morning. He's redeemed you today. He's got you from a pawn shop out here and pulled you out and gave you the light. &gt;&gt; Why are you not the happiest people in the world? You should be the happiest people today. You should be something on the inside that says, "I'm happy. I don't care what I'm going through. I love Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; But too many times we wake up and, "Oh, well, let's go to church and it's just another day." No, it's not another day. It could be the very day your grandchildren, your children, your family gets restored. &gt;&gt; It could be the very day they get filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; This could be the various service. This could be their last service. &gt;&gt; This could be my last service. But I'm here to tell you to redeem your time back. &gt;&gt; Take back the time. What the devil is trying to steal your time, young people. He's trying to steal every bit of your time. And you know what? He'll steal it with chats. Where you on 14 chats? Oh, well, Danny, I'm on a chat. What kind of chat? Well, it's a church chat. Well, they got 12 of them. They don't got one. and they got 14 chats and I'll say, "Son, when have you read your Bible? When have you read? When have you prayed?" Same thing with me. I'll get on these chats for work and conversations and I'll go, "Lord, have I forgot you today? Redeem your time back. Saints, young people, old people, young middle age, redeem your time. Oh, he's worth it all to us." I think Colossians 5, you don't have to turn there for time, but Colossians 4:5 says, "Walk in wisdom toward them that with without redeeming the time." Talking about redeeming the time. Ecclesiastes 3:11, "He hath made everything beautiful in his time." And also, he has set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. John 13:33-35, he says, "A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another as I as I have loved you, that you also have one one love for the other. Be he says, by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another." I tell you what, I tell you, I I I say, Lord, give me more love today. Fill me today with so much love, Lord, that when I go out that when I pass somebody like like uh if I even walk by somebody, I don't have to say anything, they feel the love of God. &gt;&gt; They know that just because I carry a message book or I quote the message that it's more than just quoting a quote. The devil knows the quotes. The devil knows the Bible. The devil knows the word better than you do. But get the word on the inside and let it become a living life. I tell you what, that's what we need today. And I'm here to tell the bride today is if I could say anything, I would tell you to take the time back that go the devil has stolen. &gt;&gt; He's stealing every bit of our time. He steals mine every day. But I'm here to tell you, I say, "Oh, devil, I'm going to take the time back. &gt;&gt; I'm going to redeem the time." &gt;&gt; I like what it says here in uh I'll turn to it. John John third as I was reading 34-35 another translation says so now I'm giving you a new commandment love each other just as I have loved you are also to love one another your love for for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples I said Lord let me be let me have so much love that they know that I love Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; Matthew 24 1-12 I love this they can turn it there Matthew 24 1-12 as we come down to a close he says then Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for show show him the buildings of the temple and Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left one here one stone upon another and then shall not be thrown down verse three and he set upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be, and what shall they be sign of thy coming, the end of the world? And Jesus answered, said unto them, take heed no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many. Verse six, and ye shall hear the wars of rumors of wars, and you shall not be troubled. I believe that's where we're here today. For all these things must come to pass, but the end is not. For nation, listen to this, for nation shall rise against a nation, kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes and diverse places. We're here. &gt;&gt; We have arrived. &gt;&gt; It says, "And all these things are the beginning of sorrows. Then shall you deliver you up from the afflicted, and shall kill you, and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake." I believe we arrived to this. &gt;&gt; These killings and everything. I like verse 11. They go to verse 11. It says, "And many false prophets shall arise and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved." So I'm here to tell you, endure to the end. Give it all you got. Give everything you got for the truth. Give you redeem your time back and say, "Lord, I'm brother Ber. I'm giving it all I got. I don't want to just live a halfway life. I don't want to live here and live halfway in the world and h No, young people, give it all you got. Sell out to Jesus Christ. Sell out to them to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Because if you don't sell out to it, the devil will sell you out to the world. &gt;&gt; And he'll leave you up somewhere. I'm telling you what the devil will do, young people. He will put you somewhere you don't want to be. He'll wreck you up somewhere. He'll run over you and laugh at you and say, "Guess what? That's where you should be." But you know what? you you're in the best place you could be in today. That's the house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The house of God. But it says, I like what it says in verse 11, and many false prophets shall arise. I thought about, aren't you thankful that we had arise, a prophet that arise that's not false. &gt;&gt; And too many times I I just want to get personal with you today. Too many times we're on websites and we're redeeming our time on nonsense. &gt;&gt; I don't understand it. I don't understand why you would go to a church website or to a website, not even a church website, that that believe the sign and do this and do that. Well, you know what I The only sign that I believe is the one that the prophet took a picture of. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Show me one picture I thought about this. I thought about there's no other places that Jesus took his picture with. And people, Brother Ber, people are getting on these websites and on these things and social media and they're taking these people's word. The only word I want to take is what God says and what this Bible says and what the prophet of God has opened the word of God to you and me today. I would tell you to stay off them websites. I would say stay only website the only thing you should be in the message of the hour and this book every day. &gt;&gt; This book I tell you this book will become a new book when you take the message of the hour and you line it up with the word of God. It will it will hit the target every time. &gt;&gt; Mine's falling apart, but I'm here to tell you it's about to fall off the plat platform. But I'm here to tell you, I'm just tell you, I love my maker more than I do more than I did yesterday, more than last week because I every single day I want to fall in love with him again. &gt;&gt; I like what the prophet says as the musicians come. He said, "You you asked them." He said, "You you talk about it." He said, "Well, you got our television. and we got our television and that's how we find comfort. See, he said, "That's the American attitude. See, we got television, we got plenty of money." I'm like, "Amen." He says, "We got fine cars. We got nice houses." He said, "What what do we need with the Lord?" He said, "What do we need?" He said, "That's the attitude." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I said, "My the brother of God says about the only religion is salvation we have and love is amongst the real godly people. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "You know, the Bible said that would happen." The Bible readers, he said, "I heard you holler, "Amen." And you preacher back there. He said, "That's right." He said, "Love would would be so far away in the last days." Listen to this. He said, "Love will be so far away in the last days. The only love there would be left will be between the elect of God's people." &gt;&gt; Between the elect. I'm I feel like I'm I believe I'm speaking the leg today. He said, "The only love left will be between the elect of God." I tell you what, I love being around believers. &gt;&gt; Brother Wade, I love being around, Brother Ber. I love being around believers. There's something that they put off. There's something that the love of God is so on the inside. I'm here to tell you that's the kind of love you want to get. God's love. The prophet go go goes on to say he said oh bless the eternal God who in the message called love he said oh bless the eternal God who brought again the lord from the dead he has now pres presented us to us after 1900 years yet alive and just as sufficient in his power and his presence as he was 1900 years ago when he walked in the Galilee and we thank thee oh father because thou has done it to us done for us he said in this dark evil day that We're living when there is so much confusion on every hand among the world. I'm like, "Amen, brother." And in the nations, and politics, and every walk of life, the prophet of God says, "Even to the Christian walk, yet there is confusion." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Then he goes on to say, he says, "But we are so glad to know that Jesus still lives." Oh, he says, "And as the scripture has said unto him, the same yesterday, today, and forever, and when we see the end of approaching rapidly," he said, "the signs of his near coming, our hearts jump for joy." He said, "We rest upon the blessed promise that he is the same and that he loves us and he gave himself for us." He said, "Our hearts jump for joy." I'm here to tell you when I see the signs in the Russia and Ukraine and I tell you it made I'm excited. People look at me at work and they're like, "Chris, you crazy." You know, I'm scared to death. There ain't nothing to be scared about when you're in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; There ain't, as the prophet would say, there ain't no bomb shelter that will cover you. There won't be nothing to cover you but the grace of God &gt;&gt; and the God that's on the inside. as they pay something softly this morning as we come down to a close about redeeming the time. Maybe all heads bowed just for a few minutes. Maybe there's someone today that will step out and say, "Lord, I I've been this. I've been that way." Just say, "Lord, I want to redeem the time back. [Music] just one person. It didn't matter who it is. No one looking around. You can do it in your seat. You can The altar's open. Whatever. Say, "Lord, I want to redeem the time back from my phone, from social media, whatever it may be that's taking your time. Say, Lord, I want to redeem my time to give it more to you." Oh, hands everywhere, Lord. Bless them, Lord. My hands up, Lord. I say, redeem the time in my life. Let me be more like you, Lord. Maybe there's someone online today. Say, "I want to redeem the time, Lord. Maybe they couldn't make it to church today. May you bless their hearts. May you touch them where they're at. May where they're sitting. Father, may these young people, may you just cover a shield of protection around them, Lord, where they would get the Holy Ghost, Lord. Oh, may you fill them today, Lord. Whatever their whatever their requests are, all these hands, Lord, may you touch every one of them this morning. We love you, Father. May you restore us. May you just put a zeal in our heart to be on fire for you, Lord. Bless your people today. We love you, Father. We give you today. We give you our lives. We surrender everything to you, Lord. Bless Brother Ber and your saints today. in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Music] Give me Jesus. In the morning when I rise. In the morning when I rise.
