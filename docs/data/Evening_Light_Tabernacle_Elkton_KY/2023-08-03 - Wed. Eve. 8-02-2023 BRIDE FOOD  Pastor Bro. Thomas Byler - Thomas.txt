night amen I know we all got jobs and work and different things we're busy but you know sometimes that's just our downfall is we're just too busy for God and amen and we need to make more time for God Amen so God bless you amen get to see everybody I see Woody brother friend with him so God bless you young man amen pray the church service will be a blessing to him amen praise the Lord so amen I feel like I've and I prayed Lord I prayed Lord give me something fresh Lord amen amen amen and just I was thinking something perhaps that I ain't never preached before never thought of before or whatever amen so we've got a little of both amen some of the stuff we've heard before it's still fresh amen amen as long as it's under the anointing it stays fresh amen but we do have a little another Direction kind of uh that that I felt led to going in for some reason that I feel the Holy Spirit just took me that way Amen to speak about amen a king amen and a queen amen and a virgin amen that amen I want to speak of for a little while with the help of the Lord and I didn't know if I wanted to do the last part first or the first part first part last so we're just going to achieve the Holy Spirit won't tie it together some mile is that okay amen if you will turn your Bibles amen we'll go over into the book of Esther the Book of Esther I mean we're going to talk about Ash Thai we're going to talk about Esther I'm going to talk about Mordecai amen those three people that we're going to talk talk about mainly tonight but we want to speak on and I just titled this amen I titled this uh bride food bride food amen so this may be a little serious amen I I really uh I changed from what I was thinking of going but um amen this is something that man you could just take a series on so we'll see if the Lord wants us to just go do that or not but amen we feel just to go that way at this time amen amen we know that Jesus said I'm the bread of life amen The Divide of this bread you'll live forever the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen amen from a nose it gives you life it it brings you alive the word of God does amen I didn't do it to that 80 year old man that was a preacher you know and they called him up there and he began to preach about job and uh the horizontal rainbow and I don't know what all he preached on but he wasn't no time that old man come alive man did you come up all for the ground and be able to click his heels together and come back down without falling down amen he come alive the Lord of God is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul the spirit and is it is earner of the thought and intents of the heart praise God so how many knows God knows what you have need of tonight he's just the same as he he always was amen I might go a complete different directions come speak right down your alley amen might walk all over your toes but that's not me walking that's a holy ghost talking that's the holy ghost walking amen how many wants that type of service were God speaks to you amen amen all right let's just uh read here and I I'll tell you what I you know I even in Reading here there's so much that I'd like to lay out but um I'm going to just amen read the story a little bit because we really didn't have to know what's going on before we can even get into the detail of it Esther amen chapter one now it came to pass in the days of ahazarus I hope that's correctly pronounced I'm going to call him a hazardous tonight would that be all right amen all right which Reign from India even unto Ethiopia over 170 and 20 provinces amen 170 and 20. wouldn't that be 190 I don't know why they couldn't put that way it's just under 90. well anyway there you go 190 prop that's pretty widespan ain't it it's a wide span that in those days when the king of hazarus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shoes and the palace in the third year of his Reign he made a feast to all his princes and his servants the power of Persia and Mead media notice but I'm talking about this and this is the now this was way back in the times of the Persians and the medes amen the medes and the Persians we probably just know it by word we don't know that much about it unless of course you're a historian but during that time there was a time that they were like Russia and America and you know their superpower so to speak amen and the Nobles and the princes of the promise promises being before him when he showed the riches of his glorious Kingdom and the honor of his Excellency excellent Majesty many days even in 104 score days amen and when those days were expired the king made a feast unto all that were present in shushan the palace both unto the Great and the small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's Palace amen now I'm going to let you go ahead and be seated hey man so we see here that this king is quite something because I want to I want to bring it up a little bit because brother Branham talked about this and he typed this and there's a couple types that are made and I think it's quite something how that of course we know that probably a large portion of the reason that God chose to actually write a book of extra and become a Bible and to record a king of Persian and so forth uh and have all of this in here was because amen that we would even today take the things that are said as an example amen because I truly believe that even though the Bible is a history book a book of History should we say Amen the book of the past showing the past that doesn't mean that it's not still anointed amen it'll go on and on and on through all of eternity I believe it'll be real amen and so it's still anointed and God puts this in here amen and a for a reason my goodness gracious the old Devil's trying to get all up in my throat amen give me a sore throat or something we rebuke him amen praise the Lord but I thought about that I thought you know some there's a reason there's always a reason why God does things praise the Lord and he's the reason that he wrote this now I'm gonna I'm gonna skip over and Skip on down a little bit because I want to get to the moral of the story but notice he says for seven days they had a special Feast around the palace now the king had a palace now the next few verses talk about uh bash Thai how did she also had a feast in her house isn't that right all right and then uh I believe it was down in verse uh let's go to yeah let's go on down to verse 10. and on the seventh day well yeah vashti was on the ninth verse talking about having a having a feast at her house and on the seventh day when the heart of the King was Mary with wine he commanded oh boy I gotta print I just put a mark there he commanded then down at the end of the verse it says the seven chamber Chambers uh chamberlains the presence of hazarias the king all right so he commended his seven chamberlains to bring mashed out of the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princess her beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen Ash star refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was very Roth and his anger burned in him but mentions he said that he got angry and that he was humiliated to the point that his face turned red amen but now whether humiliation or whether it's anger he got a little hot under the collar didn't he amen because his own wife wouldn't come when he called amen amen and so then of course we find in verse 13 the king said to the wise men which knew the times and the laws and the King's Men Are Stars all that knew the law and judgment so forth they said what shall we do unto the queen of Asha according to the law because she had not performed the Commandment of the King has arised by the chambermen chamberlains amen and so now notice here in uh verse 17 and for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all all the men all the women so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported the King has arised command that match died a queen to be brought before him but she came likewise shall the ladies of Persia Anita say this day unto all the king's princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath and he pleased the king Let There Go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of Persians and the medes and that it be not altered that Ash die come no more before the King has arised and let the King give that her Royal Estate unto another that is better than she amen now I want to type ashtai with the denominational systems of this age amen and Esther of course she's going to be a virgin she's going to be God's chosen or God's elect is that all right praise the Lord and we're gonna actually bring you quotes and scriptures on that and of course now I'm gonna go on down to verse two if you would chapter two and after these things when the Wrath of the King has arised was a peace he remembered bastard and when she had and what she had done and what was the degree against her then said the king's servant administered on to him let there be a fair virgins be fair Merchants sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all Providence of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to shushan the Palace to the house of the women unto the custody of haggai the king's Chamberlain Keeper of the women that let their things be be purification be given to them now notice in verse 7 and he brought up a hadash the that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother nor and the maid was fair and beautiful who Mordecai when her father and mother were dead took her as his own daughter and they came to pass it when the Kings commandment and his decree Was Heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace to the custody of hagai that Esther was brought also into the King's house to the custody of hagai Keeper of the women and the Maiden pleased him notice that amen the maiden pleased him how many believe that amen uh Jesus said he said you know I always do that which pleases the father I mean how many tonight's here in a dear year then you want to be pleasing to the king amen we want to be pleasing to him I will try to go back and pick a few thoughts up here but and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her things for purification how many beans were not washed by denominational Waters we're Washed by The Wonder of the word amen this King that we've got he gives us what we need for purification amen praise be to God with such things as belong to her and seven maidens maidens are servants right servants we could type with the angels seven they said Church Messengers amen which are meeting me given her out of the King's house and they preferred her and her mates unto the best Palace of the House of the wind praise be the God how many believes you got in the best place in the kingdom of God God yeah there may be people outside of this city it may be foolish virgin they may be this they may be that but you have thought the best spot that's it you have got the best spot and that is to have fellowship with the king of gates out of everybody out there on the planet you've got the best spot and you're the Mordecai it has told you that you ought to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth let me believe that Hallelujah oh my first of all I wanna I wanna let me see here I'm gonna finish the story okay I just got a few more scriptures and then we'll go back and start preaching all right now notice and Esther and I know there's Mercy Loudon he says in Mordecai walked every day now Mordecai is kind of like early Asia right somebody that kind of watched over us or kind of tutored her make sure that she was on the right path and so forth I mean even at any age it was kind of a person that brought Rebecca to Isaac isn't that right they meant just kind of like our prophet and our generation has introduced us not to some man not to himself but he has pointed us to him isn't that right amen kind of Mordecai like Ellie had walked every day before the court of the women's House of novias Esther's did and what she uh what what should become of her amen and now when every maid's turn was come to go to the king of hazarus after he had been 12 months according to the manner of the women for so we're the days of their purification according it was accomplished to it six months with oil and myrrh and six months with sweet odors my my races I'm here to tell you this man didn't want no stinking woman well come on folks we might spray a little here and there but six months worth of oils and perfumes and everything else my my well I might as well tell you God don't want no stinking woman either he wants a clean woman he wants a pure woman praise be to God amen hallelujah now notice with sweet owners I thought about those odors I believe Paul talked about sweet smelling odor of sweet smelling amen we'll maybe bring that up and with other things for the purifying of the women praise be to God down in verse 15 now we're getting closer to the end here now when the turn of Esther in other words King her turn the daughter of ABI Hill the uncle of Mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what a haggai the king's Chamberlain the king of the women had appointed in other words she didn't want anything special all this other stuff amen Astro obtained favor in the sight of all them looked upon her so Esther was taken unto the king azerias into his house Royal in the 10th Mount which is in the month Tibet in the seventh year of his Reign and the King loved Esther above all the churches I mean women how many believe that there's churches churches Brides Brides brides churches but there's one there's one that God really has his eye on there's one that God really favors tonight I want to show you a little bit amen invite the help of the Lord maybe the next few Services because I'm here to tell you that that God is looking for a special one he's coming for somebody he's going to have somebody that's ready somebody that has gotten themselves ready and that are waiting for him and that are qualified you realize you're gonna have to qualify qualified to be the bird of Christ amen that's right now notice and she obtained grace and favor in this sight more than all the versions so that he said the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of vashtag Amen my notice in verse verse 19 that last I come no more before the King has arise and let the King give the Royal Estate unto another that is better than her oh praise be to God first of all make an example because I like it I like the way that the prophet put it when he said that uh with this example that Vash die had made it was a bad example I mean it was it it was a bad example amen then and according to the scriptures that we find out that amen that all the other women are going to go to act me like cheetahs Amen in one place I believe brother bam said that you know he says you know the women are going to get the attitude that when your husband ask them something that they're going to just say well let's go jump in the room amen why don't you fix me a sandwich honey would you fix me a sandwich or this out of the other amen well you know where the bread is you know what a sandwich is this morning I'll tell you I asked my wife I said honey you think I can have some I feel like some bacon and egg sandwich this morning yeah in a little while I was upstairs and she says honey your breakfast is ready I come down and making eggs and so forth and she even had some of my brother Steve's cucumbers and squash fried up and I had me a good Jubilee time and I thought my life ain't ruined she's not a vast eye hey man she don't tell me to go jump in a river and then isn't that the truth about what better man say about the women nowadays running things he says you know you better get out there and do that and you better get out there and do this too many bad guys oh my praise the Lord let me begin let me just begin with this amen because I want to talk about the bride's food amen this all comes from a little bit about the bride's food the bride's clothing dressing and so forth but about it makes a statement you're not feeding on the man man's words will fail but you're feeling on the unfailing body word of the son of man and if you haven't fed fully on every word to give you strength to Fly Above these denominations and things of the world well you at this time do so if man I'm at least it's time to fly a little higher by eating the right food we don't know how privileged we are and I hope we can get to express somehow just a little bit of how privileged the people we are to have the unadulterated word of God the way that we do amen amen the pure word of God the saith the Lord what denomination can say look our preacher when he gets done preaching he does if Jesus don't come do what he did with the woman that dwell and show him Life Alive like that you ain't got to believe what I said and then he comes down every time never fails and does it all I can tell you is this belief that you'll go to hell brother bam says because if you disbelieve now he is that is sin that is true unbelief if you see it happening it's absolutely Vindicated and then for you to disbelieve that's sin amen oh my brother Anthony questions and answers he was talking about how that you know people used to not love him and indeed and not look and look at him and just you know uh he'd go along and they'd be talking if he'd say hello they wouldn't even say hello to him on the streets and so forth he was he just meant nothing his family name was nothing is dead you know of course it was what he was and so forth and everybody looked down on him and so forth but you know towards the end of his end of his life he said he says you know people just didn't love me at all nobody had any use for me and he got to talking about how that even David one time was a sheep herder and so forth and God had taken him from the Sheep coat and so forth all the way and made him a great king and so forth and he says now look what God has done and you know even in my life people wouldn't love me or anything he says but now he says I gotta people pray for me and businessman's prospered by the people we've been in and all these other things that God has done because of what God is doing through the prophet and he always said it's not me amen but it's God people didn't love me at all nobody had any huge for me and now by the help of God I I believe that I am directing the Bride of Jesus Christ how many believe that that he was actually not just think that he was thinking he was without question directing the pride of Jesus Christ I thought one place even said that he was dressing the Bride of Jesus Christ I couldn't pull that up on my computer and it come to my mind and then directing the bride of Christ when I pulled that up then this is what I found that he's directing the Bride of Jesus Christ kind of like Mordecai he was kind of a director aren't you glad somebody that can direct you thank you praise be the god he's directing the Bride of Jesus Christ all Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound where did he come from my education I have none where did it come from my personality I don't have any amen didn't eat did he come from me no a theology no he had no education but the seventh grade isn't that right he said where did it come he said it come from the grace of God that saved me praise be the god it's Grace that taught my heart into fear raised my fears relieved on and on and on oh how I love Jesus he said that beautiful name that saved me when I was a sinner healed me when I was sick gave me the promise of a home in that City oh I got a home on that rock nothing else matter now but to get all of God's children together and say let's go amen praise the Lord brother Brandon I'm talking about a vision or a dream that he had now are you remember what dream that I got interpretation was he says the interpretation was for me to go back and star up food amen start our food where was The Storehouse this Tabernacle where is there anything like it in the country around here anywhere that'll compare it with the message that we have is there anywhere anybody that can even compare with the message of the hour there's no comparison there's nothing out there there ain't nothing like the message of the hour oh my I don't know half the quote but just before Brother Bear I'm about to talking about Mordecai he got talking about this and so forth he says you know you know that the Mordecai he had to be kind of kind of become ashamed or whatever and that's the way people people black you know I wonder how Jesus must feel and you know when he was sitting there having his teeth washed he wasn't welcomed kind of like a king man he was he didn't feel too good he was humiliated that's the way Jesus must feel living after God is done there he sits with dirty feet people pay him no attention when you come to church when you're at home and you're your car how about entertaining him a little bit amen praise be the God all right let me go on here I'm trying to show you that what we eat on is spiritual food in these seasons I mean he's glad for spirits of food and it's in due season right the right time amen oh my of course our brothers here and some of them having little churches but where would you go to to find it show its comparison anywhere you go right out there into denominational Creeds is all you got is that right horse and buggy cars these are all kinds of crazy all kinds of things like that oh my now notice what comparison you'll go right out there in the uh name of the Lord Jesus Christ remember what place he says I didn't call you miss Jesus Christ how many believe that I I'm Mordecai has introduced us to our King Lord Jesus Christ you'll go right away from these other things he and here's where the food's been stored up well one message that I preached here to you all look I've been preaching from one to six hours to you on a message I know that the spoken word is the original seed about six hours long how many land to be able to Feast on that I got a quote out of there tonight I want to read to you oh I I take a week to take just a little bit here and a little bit there ah see because it's been stored up it's on tapes it wide on the tapes for people in their houses them temps will fall into the hands of the predestinated of God he can direct his work hey God's Gonna direct that word how many of us can say you know I heard a message I've listened to a tape and that's what caught my attention the way that he preached the truth that he sold amen our Mordecai amen praise be to God that's right he can direct that word he'll direct everything just exactly to his course that's the reason he has sent me back here to do this starve up the food here and he forbid me even to go overseas store up food how many beliefs it's important my I don't want to go down here too far because I want to get to my message but think remember that when a woman that didn't have any food in that right and Elijah comment on he says you know give me a drink give me a food and give me a cake and so forth and then go make yourself one obey the word at first is what the prophet said when you come into obedience amen then that Chief AA for amen three and a half years he talked about there'll be a little group little elected lady amen that when everybody's starving to death She's gonna have us five seven course meal you can be eating good when the whole world's dying churches are dying people are dying but you can eat good amen you're going to eat something that's going to put you in a rapturing condition amen oh praise the Lord hallelujah amen all right I get excited and I just kind of Amen get off my course but anyway praise the Lord now let's just look here so now notice and I want to compare this scripture with a New Testament scripture if I may Matthew 22 and Jesus answered and spake unto them again by para old bulls and said the Kingdom of Heaven is likened to a certain King which made him marriage for his son and he sent forth his servants to call them that were bitten to the marriage or the wedding and they would not go ahead come they would not come and he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bad and behold I have prepared my dinner he made a face how maybe God has made us a feast amen I gotta I I don't think I'll get to it tonight but I've got wrote down all all the things that are on that table that we can Feast on Amen some of the things prepared my dinner it ain't talking about taters and beans and steak it's talk about spiritual food amen my oxen and my fotlings are killed and things already come unto the marriage but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm and other to his merchandise I'm in a note that tight regret it what you what she had positioned she lost her place he put her away and last I took her place not that side but Esther took her place somebody that was better than her now notice now we know brother bam says in them he says now we know that the little book of Esther how did Mordecai his uncle had a daughter and it was during the times of the Reigns of the meats and the Persians it's a very beautiful type there the king one of the greatest kings in the world of that day he had a great feast and he called the queen to come to set by it but she wouldn't do it she refused to do it now notice he's talking about a type and so what did he do he was so humiliated he didn't know what to do that That was supposed to come isn't that exactly what happened in our day God gave all those churches he gave oh he gave him last time so to speak a chance to come and sit by my side we didn't many times lay it down your denominational differences and come to the word but they would not amen they wouldn't do it you know the thing of it is how many believe that God has actually uh not just them but he's given the whole world the invitation to come listen if you're sitting under the sound of my voice you hear me say Jesus said come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest amen whosoever will let him come when you hear that that is your invitation to come to Christ what you do with that depends on where you'll end up at you can't just turn down his invitation and do not be consequences amen there is consequences when you turn down oh the voice of the Holy Spirit speaking through the ministry oh man I'm I'm scared to death for people one day you know when the very fire of God comes forth the ministers preach what the Holy Spirit puts on their heart and people say nah that's just brother Wilder that's just that preacher I don't have to leave I'm not going to listen to that I know he's just playing that at me you go ahead and think that and see where you end up at huh amen praise the Lord now notice I want to bring something else up before I go on on this story now notice he says you remember in the Bible this was in marriage and divorce you remember in the Bible the king Mary Esther married Esther because the queen refused he just got him another one what happened when she refused to come out to the king to obey him the same thing it is with a woman that refuses to be wife to her husband amen notice he says now notice and so is it with the church that refuses to become pregnant in the age that we are now living to bring forth children not to this age amen I'm gonna stop on that quote and pick up another notice he can put her away but she cannot put him away he did it he's a loser Wesley Pentecost when they refuse to become the further part of him by having sexual spiritual sexual Affair to become pregnant with further part of the word in other words you just can't say where you're at you gotta keep growing you gotta go further and further in Christ when you stop and put a period for where you were at huh and you refuse to go further with God God has a right to put you away now notice Luther when he did to Wesley in Pentecost and they refused to become for the part of him now notice you understand she refused the Lutheran Church refused for Christ to have any more Desire with her loser refused it and let me say this you're going to call me something anyhow oh is it today with every one of them they'd failed to take that word they refused Christ and any woman that refuses a man his child has no right to be a wife to him amen amen now notice now we're not lutherans we're not with this and neither are we Pentecostals we've got to be the children of this age through the pregnancy of the word of God to bring forth a child of this age how many believe is that amen now notice the sea child [Music] my I'm going to stop and pick that back up there's another quote that I want to bring out how many remembers the spoken word is the original seat and brother Braham talks about uh uh the three different seeds that's been sown you know and the last one of course was his own Ministry he said he was a dentist seemed like to be the deadest of all of them but now notice he says notice now we believe that we're in the end time do we do we believe that before you have a crop now you have to plant a seed do you see why I've let the churches turn me out tell me everything call me all kinds of names and everything else and just stay right there with that word see there's a plan the seed's been planted it's already been planted friends it's already done oh that's one of the things that's on the table for us to eat is that seed amen it's got some seed on it that if you eat it you'll become it by the word aren't you glad you're not a denominational see you're not a Pentecostal seed you're a message sheet you're a word seed listen it won't it won't produce out there just in the middle there it's got to be in your heart that's where it's got to fall that seat's got to fall in somebody's heart somebody's got to believe that word accept that word into their heart amen aren't you thankful Lord help me to take that seat in let me let me just read you a little more is that okay my isn't it something how that Not only was this woman a type of a woman that would not go on and be with her husband but she actually a type of being pregnant with another man I'm listening oh there's a plan it's been sown it's already it's already done I love that it's already done I can say it now it's over she's done been planted what do you reckon is happening around the message what's going on I'll tell you what's going on we may not see the full effect of it it may not be the way that we think it is but I guarantee you one thing this seed is coming to maturity there is going to be a crop from this message there's going to be a group of people that is The Virtuous unadulterated virtuous bride of Jesus Christ that he's coming for because this message when we're talking about it is about getting ready for the Rapture folks it's Harvest Time amen and that seed has to come into you oh man here we are blessed be the Lord we come to the body to be the bride of Christ now to be flesh of his flesh bone of his borrow bone amen I mean please Spirit of his spirit amen now notice listen what about these rains back here that y'all had claiming having to rain this down if it's on coming then it's over do we believe it like it was in the days of Noah long shopping he's getting his bride ready why didn't these Reigns why didn't you Pentecostals back there a few years ago when you started 40 or 50 years ago why didn't you bring Christ the bridegroom to the bride I'm gonna let that soak in a minute why because you pregnant it yourself with your denomination word of God amen that's exactly what you've done and he won't marry hard last time poor Vash time this hour how many knows she actually he was outside her door knocking she may have put him out but he put her out amen she pronounced her dad back in 1962 the prophet of God said Pentecostals are dead amen Church of God all of them denominations are dead they have rejected God it doesn't matter how much that Turtle snaps his mouth after his head stopped off he's dead don't know it but the fruit of it has really come to fruition hasn't it oh I'm gonna let that soak in he won't marry her he will marry a virgin it's flat but that's the truth you know you'll know it in the flat way you don't have to wonder I don't stumble around about it amen listen we've got to be the children of this age through the seed that's been brought I hope you understand couldn't be pregnant no so what did he do he put her away in divorcement that's right but she dares put him away he put her away and he went right on revealing his word to the body and vindicating his saying by himself his children oh is this you his children uh began to kind of look more like him because it's fully Midori I mean it could say that's right I'm back I'm acting a little more like Christ lately I'm acting more like the one I've got more of a thirst for the word I've got more of it desire to have the same passions that Christ had and that it pleased the one that has sent me we should be acting a whole lot more like that seed word amen praise be to God oh my to now notice that's right fully maturing or they they become the children of the word not children of the church Children of the word the bride will be a lovely lady of the word I'm not not not touched by man's organization any man-made Theory shall be purely unadulterated Bride of the word amen and amen I hope you get that out there in New York in the air she'll be impregnated daughter of God I mean that's what his table and that's what his church is in this hour we are pregnant by the word of God our womb is posed up and we ain't got no rules for men's ideas man theology wrong doctrines something contrary with the Buffett in the Bible says hello that's I don't know if this church or any church that's another God that's man-made isn't that what I heard she is not she she didn't touch the man's ID in Creeds and dogmas anything that's a man I don't want no part of I wonder what God is in it amen praise the Lord hallelujah so that's the part that I wanted to get if you'll notice how that they refused to go on they refuse to go further in Christ just like vashti refused when she refused not only the denominations refused but they took the seat man can you imagine how disappointing it was for Adam when he found out hey his little baby don't look like me looks more like the serpent we need to have a test here huh No Doubt but she was pregnant by another man Eve was before Adam got to her amen and in this hour when Christ came in his fullness let me believe the fullness of Christ came young people listen would you like to see the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel through to Wilderness would you like to see it you wanna see that Pillar of Fire well there's been a picture taken of it there it is right there right on this wall right here that's the almighty God by the brother Adam said that's a that's a the letter Israel through the wilderness that very same guy coming in Mighty way they wouldn't go on with him God put her away in divorcement said you're dead you'll never rise again I'll get me a virgin yes your mama's gotta be dead your daddy's gonna be dead amen that old church Creed brother Brown says you gotta be dead them all denominational parents gotta be dead you're gonna be a lone child so to speak like baby esteroids then where to go and then the king comes picks you up and you find favor with the King how many beliefs you found favor with the King you know the grace of God in your heart you found favor with the King he was the greatest King in the time well guess what the greatest king of all this Hallelujah the greatest of all Kings is Jesus Christ amen and you found favor hey man aren't you glad to have found favor with him praise be to God Hallelujah now notice and he send out the chamber maids and so forth that went out to pick up all the young maidens the beautiful women throughout the kingdom in Providence and he was over which was the greatest in the world and it came across this little Jewish girl she was kind of an outcast because like the Gentile see she was a outcast off to the side she had no father mother but Mordecai and she had to qualify amen folks I'm here to tell you God's not just going to take everything into the rapture no you're going to have to qualify you're going to have to come up to the conditions you're going to have to come God's way I mean God has a provided way he has made it provided right for us today and he we have to come in that way oh and I don't know about you dumb more and more I said Lord take me deeper into your word Lord help me to understand more father amen I don't know about you but I'm on a closer walk with God how many always these eyes are closer walk with I would you like to stay long enough for me to just tell you how to have a closer walk with God tonight I want to tell you how to call what brother bam said you know this food that's on the table amen that this little virgin is eating this you know oh my and she had to go to qualifying so what they did they had to take these girls for a purification for many months and they had them perfume them and all kinds of adorning and fix them all up so that they could go before the king and that's just about the way the world wants to fix the church today Adorn it with the world huh Adorn and I looked up that adorned she was a door and Esther was adorned but she wasn't the door all the things how many believes the bride of Christ has an adornment amen in Philippians I guess it is no first Peter 3 and 1-4 likewise you wives being subjections to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won but a conversation of the wives while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear who is adorning let it not be the outward adorning of the plating of the hair or the world or the putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price isn't this something that this King amen looked at Esther and it wasn't the perfume it wasn't the gold it wasn't the silver she didn't put all of that on but you had something down in there that he liked I'm gonna tell you right now when she bought herself before the king it wasn't by the adorning of the world and when you bring yourself to Christ it isn't that dawning of the greatness of a wonderful preacher you are a great church you have or whatever it might be it's gonna be what's not on the inside oh Hallelujah that's what God sees just like that rich young uh man that come from Chicago I believe he'd come out west you know to find him a wife and men that had a big dance and all of these other things and he went out and take a break from the dance went out behind the building and look at the little girl throwing out though schweiner in your bare feet and your dirty clothes but he liked her he looked at her and said no that's the kind of wife that looks like a real girl he went up to her and I'll tell you what she didn't do like all the other girls and come right up in the face and then just get off walked in everything else no she was a little shy and bashful huh but there was a character about her that she he liked that's the way it is with you and I it is not the outward adorning of things but it's what's down on the inside that makes a difference it isn't what we are on the outside it's what he is what he sees on the inside of us amen listen to pattern after the things of the world trying to get more members taking in anything for Fellowship it's a pitiful thing one organization trying to beat the other one that's all worldism amen so it was to become a bride so she didn't want a none of this adorning of the world she wanted to go into the king just like she was in my hands no price I bring simply through thy cross I cling I am realizing I am nothing but Lord I just I'm a Meek and quiet and speaking quiet spirit is what she had which was in the sight of God a great price amen how many believes that the king got him a good wife he got a good woman amen nothing as good as a good wife praise God she adorned herself listen she adorned herself like the Pentecostals women ought to with a Meek and humble spirit amen and with all these fancy first ladies come by with their new Fang dangle things and the King looked at them and put them in the chamber with the concubines but when disaster come into his side he got a glimpse of that sweet humble Meek Spirit he said that's hard go get the crown and put it on her how many knows there's a showdown coming when God is gonna put that Crown of Life on you and I take his interactions and this is my wife all the denominations are gonna be sitting in the tribulation period then bunch of cooks they call us brother Glenn a bunch of crazy people believe in God sends a prophet following a prophet following a prophet huh isn't Rebecca glad she followed eliaser she found the love of her life amen oh Don Osborne I used to like it when he's singing all that Ellie don't you hear can't you hear that Alias are called hey man the air is gonna be a wedding hey man I can't quite come up with it amen uh and our Joys will soon begin in the evening when the camel train comes in hey man come to me after 10 years it's a miracle you love the Lord isn't he good how many believe we got some good food we got good food to eat people we have food that'll absolutely sustain you it'll give you strength it'll change your character it'll mold you into what you need to be that the king can look down on you and say that's what I'm looking for amen now before I really go into this vashtag thing I was really seeking Lord say Lord just give me something really a deeper walk with you and this is what it gave me so I hope you enjoy it is that all right let me see if I let me see if I can just close this up now notice like yesterday was the hidden man of the in the heart that hidden man the meekness and gentleness of the spirit in the human heart not the glory and class of the world as I've always said the gospel glows amen Hollywood shines but the gospel glows and it's a million miles apart the Church of Christ glows with loveness and softness and sweet and kind that's right amen praise the Lord Lord Jesus help us tonight to get to have the character amen that he's looking for on the inside of us amen praise the Lord now a few quotes you had in closing listen how many remembers and this is where I got to I thought Lord Jesus you know how can I really get deeper you know deeper in you you know and you know what he told me you know what he told me the same thing he always gonna tell you the way up is down because remember God is not into glamor he's not in big things amen because Us in the message have to watch for that a little bit people liking big fancy things and everything else amen I don't think preachers are I think I've listened to a lot of preachers here more than I have and until lately until my son encouraged me to do it I hadn't hardly listened to any preachers but lately I have and I'm here to tell you I am amazed by the time I'm Amazed same things that we're preaching I mean whether it's thirst and and you know whole everyone the first Common drink of the fountain without money without price that and I could just mention a lot of stuff I'm saying well that's that's what that's right because I'll tell you right now folks that we used to man we'd have preachers come up here and preach the next guy to come up here beat you under the boy that was completely different from what yeah that guy said you're like but when you hear and you're hearing the same thing amen but we're all getting ready it's harvest time this is the Harvest time it's time to get ready to leave here folks amen oh my God so now notice let me see here he says God took Paul and made his slave out of him he says he bound him to himself and sent him to the Gentiles which he hated but you see he had to be loose from his ecclesiastical power to be bound to the power of God he had to lose his strengths and become weak and nothing in order to receive strength from God to be bound to God to do what God would tell him to do how many believes when you want a closer walk with god listen to this that's what we have to do today that's what we need that's what every man needs it's a loss of himself lose loss of his ability loss of what he is that he might have a complete healing to the Holy Spirit the housewife feeds it the Schoolboy needs that we all needed even our children need it all across the board amen the pastor needs on it no my now notice God said to Paul my strength is made perfect in your weakness we always seen how great we can become or you know a mighty and strong and this that and the other and Paul he was weak he says at least I be exalted of measure through the abundance of the revelations that's given to me in other words oh he Paul wanted to fly high he wanted to go way go way up there God says he says God has given me an infirmity in my flesh and now it just makes me weak instead of being big and powerful and great deep Revelation here I am just oh man I'm tired all the time I'm weak I can't see right I'd love to be able to read I gotta write and pick letters and so forth his eyes bothering him isn't that right God had a way of perfecting his strength in and through weakness amen now notice my my strength become more perfect as you become more weaker foreign you got to forget about your education let me tell you something me or anybody else when you ever think you got this you've heard to say you got this i got this you better watch that statement amen you know what we ought to be saying he got this he's got this I sure don't I ain't got this he's got this because you exalt yourself in the little bit and you exalt yourself just a little bit you think you got this you watch out amen God will show you you ain't got this praise the Lord oh my now notice and before I go actually uh into a little bit more of this I want to I I just had a few strength you know a few few things I want to point out to you but everyone says here's something to console us here's something that encourages out of weakness and humility God chooses the people to build his kingdom out of if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of God with his church we'll stand in a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world never Byram said Esther was kind of an outcast that's who God chose wasn't it David he was kind of an outcast can you imagine if David his brothers when they were growing up you're just a shrimp in the family you're just a shrimp get out of the way huh they all thought they were the great ones there's one thing that David learned is that not to lean on his own strength isn't that right and not his own ability oh my I hope we get this I know I've said it before this is about I've said I've said before I want to say it again listen Rick and reject and cast it out by the world and a bunch of go with nothings that wasn't even properly that's not even proper English yeah that probably isn't but it's the sweetest words that you'll ever hear because when you get to realize and you don't know so much it's when we think we know something is when we get in trouble when we get a whole bunch of knowledge up here we get ourselves all messed up oh he ought to be doing that and I know better than that and this I didn't look out huh not a bunch of know-it-alls but you got to come to the place where you realize you don't know nothing how many knows Jesus said without me you can do nothing so without him you're nothing so that makes you nothing it makes him what everything oh let's go praise be to God we can we mess ourselves up don't we amen as I've often said don't never be big in your own side if you big let it be in God's sight be little in your own sign that humbles him to God so God will exalt but those exalt themselves God will abase amen listen man the guy that sticks out his chest and thinks he's somebody that shows how little he really is to me that's right the more simpler you can get the higher God will raise you just be simple don't know a whole lot and be simple so God can use you I mean those this threat what does the devil use we've been cleaning up around the house and cleaning up that old trailer back there and we've had stored up stuff like you ain't never seen you know how that is we went to the burn pile and we had some moldy old history books the history of the world spend thousands of dollars on it but history of moldy and stinky everything else and it was the history book it was uh encyclopedia and all that great I said why why are you burn these bugs see some you know people can really learn from this and I thought you know I it rang through my mind he says well if they stay here nobody'll ever never read them but the rep says there's no they don't don't even need to write history there's not going to be a history isn't that right so I ain't worried about this history I ain't worried about that I'm worried about what the Bible says so burnt all the history of the world pretty much I just got ahead a little bit because it's all over the burn anyway right all the knowledge so much knowledge you don't know nothing if you don't know Christ amen be simple let me hurry up here oh my I hope this gets down deep now remember this is Brother Band I'm speaking in 63 or 62 I believe it is and he's speaking to himself and I believe he goes for every one of us I don't care if I've been a preacher for 31 years this is for me too hey Matt it's for you gets down deep to us both here in inter tank world to you that you realize that you got to become a nothing you want more gods become less you want more God become less become nothing not a know-it-all not a great somebody but a nobody I always thought about going some preaching somewhere and introducing my hi I am nobody my name is nobody I'm nobody be confused unless they knew the message so I hope God can use a nobody amen because that's who God uses I mean those God uses nobodies nobody young people listen I want to try to explain this you've got to get to the place that you that you're nothing you got to get to a place that you know that you're nothing are you listen you're quiet you're listening now and don't ever rise above that because how many knows we have a I'ma say something right now a new revelation I got a new revelation we I'm gonna place it this way carefully there's some revivals we don't need we don't need Revival you don't need Revival I've heard that there's some revivals we don't need a certain kind of revivals we don't need when you are a nobody stay there don't revive because how many knows we sometimes the devil if if you go to die unto yourself and you become dead tomorrow somebody's going to do something to you to see if you're really dead or not they're gonna cross you they're going to cut you off somewhere you're gonna be mean to you why what's happening the devil's trying to give you CPR let's revive this guy he needs Revival Thomas spoiler let's revive you we don't need Revival of the flesh we need death death to the flesh we need God to the fudge the spirit is what we want to revive because it's him that we push out that we push away that we ain't got no time for on the Wednesday on a Sunday he gets back Christ it is revived it's the holy ghost that we need to revive my prayers say God I need a Revival the spirit needs a Revival this flesh don't need Revival how many believe that amen listen all of these campaigns brother Brown says and all that all of these Preachers did he said he didn't do no good he says what do did it do nothing and it'll never do any good until every person that professes to be a Christian will forget his own abilities and yield himself to God then God can achieve his purpose by sending not a Revival my brother but what he needs to send first is a killing I like that let that flesh die don't let the flesh revive Let It Die if we really want the Spirit Revival then we have to have a death to the flesh first even brother Bannerman is overages that's what we need that's what all of us need he said here and in the tape world everybody listening to this it'll change to a husbands treat their wives treat their husbands children their obedience every aspect of your life will change a little bit more than what you got tonight if you will die more to yourself amen my granddaughters they were arguing and fuss they like to argue and fuss they didn't want me to tell this they were in the pool and we were up they were jumping off the railing they had two rails to jump off into the pool they couldn't get along they weren't happy with that no I want that side no I want that I just switch sides I said yeah girls come here I want to teach you something I don't think I've told Grace this but I said I want to teach you something first of all let me tell you something you know how not to argue let me teach you how you really ought to do it you ought to have preference and and this is why we preach all the time about dying to yourself why don't you die to yourself and ask what the other person would like ask Evelyn ask her which side do you want to climb on them like yeah I want to climb up that's I know amalon now you ask Elena which side do you want to climb on huh and they say well okay we'll ask that and then then what is the conclusion now what do you really do what should the outcome I said the outcome be is you should say look whichever side you want you go on there okay because I you go ahead and take that side because I know you want to climb the wide side huh it wasn't 10 minutes later thank you everyone oh boy if that'll work but anyway I thought it was funny they know how to work oh my death to ourselves right I said that's what we teach about girls it's about dying to yourself I said eternal life is living for the other one what do you want and guess what there won't be no argument we'll get along really good and we've had a lot of the other let's work on that for a little bit I mean hey told the parents so I guess hope they'll appreciate a good agree with that amen praise the Lord all right we're on overtime already you love him listen don't listen that's right he says in what good did it do it'll never do any good until every person that professes to be a Christian will forget his own abilities he yield himself to God God will achieve by sending another Revival brother but what he needs to send is a killing first so that we can revive he says you have to die how many beliefs We Gotta Die to ourselves praise the Lord can I hurry I know y'all got a long way to go but let me go ahead listen you might say well I'm a failure I'm a nobody I'm worthless I can't do nonsense like Moses said God I can't even talk you know I have a speech problem you see oh Lord I just feel so bad I don't believe that I could do it God don't feel sorry for you he feels like kicking you around a little bit sure God don't feel sorry for you he gets angry with you he said you're just getting in shape then where he can use you and that what we all want when you feel like well you're not sufficient I can't do it or whatever amen you finally down and realizing that you can't but then when you yield to God God can take the very thing and accomplish the job oh my listen to what he says you're just getting in shape then God can use you most Moses got cured up oh I'll tell you what you get on your high horse horse God bring you down isn't that right get the feeling like you're really somebody God has to cure us poses on the backside of the desert for 40 years to cure him oh we need cure listen he had a cure he has a way he was away from his human abilities he didn't have nothing that he could rely on amen listen God said 40 years out there I've had you against Sephora Sephora fussing and carrying on out here in the wilderness where you could find out whether there's any weak weakness or not when you're standing up there the big Prince hello Dr Moses good morning Reverend so so you're coming uh coming Prince all of you think that not a bunch of sheep and a high-tempered wife that'll fix him up yes sir yes Moses in there he was in an awful shape he says now I can use you when you realize that you're nothing now come on up here by these burning bush I want to send you down yonder God give us some more of that kind God give us some weak links God There It Is God give us more wigglings that's what we need is some weaklings you don't hear that too much do you what is that yourself I wanted to tell the kids and trying to explain explain that to him when I said that you become a nobody he says you've got to become dust do you ever see a cremated person I didn't it wasn't the person anymore all I saw was dust all it is is dust a jar of dust that's what you got to become if you want more of God if you want more God here now there listen if you want more of God you've got to become dust that's nothing no shape no backbone no rising up no you dirt dust dead just dust you got to become God dust you got to get to the place that you're nothing and don't ever rise above it amen because as soon as you do you rise above it you rise above God you've got to keep yourself in the dust and on the road to Damascus keep yourself off of your high horses that's for everywhere here and in the tape world praise be to God that's right closing uh they say brother banham if you'll compromise on the name of Jesus baptism well we'll have a great meeting in Chicago or these places like such there was a man that actually tried to get him to compromise remember oh you think he'd do that I don't care where you get together what you do brother say with us saith the Lord I want some of them to come and tell me where that's wrong what he's teaching show me in the word where God word of God where that's wrong yeah they won't tackle it no sir but it's thus says the Lord stay with it if every one of them kicks you I don't care how weak you become then I become strong when they kick me out God will take me in and when they keep you I'll keep you in remember it's the elf Scholars that God always picks the nobodies then he makes them somebody's for him amen maybe not even in this life but in the world to come how many knows we don't care if we're nobody or what we are as long as we're yielded to almighty God bless you let's stand this morning this evening amen well brother I would be a better Christian but I just don't have time to pray uh oh there you go right there you're too busy with yourself to give God your time is that right there's so much of our self that's what's keeping more of the Holy Ghost away how many is guilty of in one manner or the other of keeping God out because you're still too much centered on yourself you're not quite dust yet amen or and that's the easiest thing in this life to do because as long as we're drawing breath there's a chance for this thing to revive ain't that true this thing will revive maybe we possibly can amen but we got to keep ourselves down there and realize that it's only God in us that's anything it's powerheads Lord Jesus we come before you tonight and Lord by going over time I feel like we're just dying to ourselves a little let's forget about our precious time and the time that we would quit but Lord we want to take a few minutes now Lord and talk to you to search our hearts Let each person in here search their heart do you want a closer they want they want perfect strength you want God to have his strength perfect in you he said to Paul my my strength is made perfect when you're weak Lord sometimes you have to bring us to those places of weakness sickness troubles Red Seas that's all things that you do to bring us to break us down and to crush us to the dirt to make us realize hey there's this is something that you can't deal with this is something that you ain't got this you need me I got this and help us to realize that as David did he never gave the glory to himself for the lion the bearer or Goliath he gave you the glory Lord Lord as have we asked God tonight that you help each person in here tonight Lord that you'd look at their hearts they'd look at their hearts look at their life we all desire to have a closer walk with you that's my desire God and you've already shown Us hall and I truly believe tonight that you're just taking us back to the Simplicity of your word Lord we ask God tonight that as we raise our hands and surrender us to you we ask God that you would kill us you would kill the flesh Lord we raise our hands in surrenderance so to speak put it in that Inferno the fire of the Holy Ghost and let it cremate ourself let that self die as the prophet God said not just die but rot Lord Jesus be gone let people not see these people that are here tonight anymore but let people see Christ reflected in their lives Lord we ask in the name of Jesus Christ that you would take this Wednesday night service Lord and help everybody to go out those doors more determined than ever to serve you on a greater measure than what they have when they came in tonight Lord more dedicated to you more dead to their self more consecrated to you to think about you day and night to keep their hearts and Minds centered on you realizing God that you have chosen us you have put something in us that makes us want to be that way we would never want to be that way in ourselves it's you that has put this desire in our hearts and we thank you God for that wonderful desire that you have put in these people's lovely hearts Lord Jesus to assemble themselves together Lord Jesus to hear your word to chasten this Lord to correct this Lord make us better wives make us better hunts but make me a better Pastor make me a better husband make me a better Grandpa and help me die so that that can happen I want Revival of the spirit in my heart God the Revival of the spirit in our hearts and the only way that will happen is that if we die more to ourselves first or bring a death for let that old man be dust not revive but let the Holy Ghost revive in my heart we raise our hands and say Lord revive the spirit in my heart Lord maybe go from here and maybe have a joyful day oh such a wonderful day tomorrow on our jobs wherever we are Lord
