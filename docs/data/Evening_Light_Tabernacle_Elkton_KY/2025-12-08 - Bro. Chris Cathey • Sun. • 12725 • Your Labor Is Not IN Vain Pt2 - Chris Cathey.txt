And you know, and I always think back of Sister Peggy and on the second verse one time, she asked me, she said, "Brother David, did you put your name in there or is that really the way it goes?"

Well, he sought [music] me and he bought me [singing] with his redeeming [music] blood. Love me. [singing] I knew him and all my love [music] is due.

We're just going to let them have it here in just a few minutes.

[music] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful tonight? God bless you. You may be seated. Just had a few songs on our heart tonight to sing. I hope it's a blessing as they come forward. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; When I [singing] think of how he came [music] so far from glory. He came to dwell among the lowly such as I to suffer shame and such disgrace. on Mount [singing] Calary took my place. Then I ask myself this question. Who am I? &gt;&gt; Oh, who am I that a king [singing] would bleed and die for? [singing] Who am I that he would pray? [singing] Not my will but thine, Lord. &gt;&gt; Not my will but thine, Lord. &gt;&gt; The answer I may never [singing] know. Why ever love me [music] so? [singing] to that old rugged cross he would go for who am I? When I'm reminded [singing] of his words I'll leave you never. If you'll be true, I'll give to you life forever and forever. I wonder what I could have done to deserve God's only son. We fight our battles until they're won. For who am I? Oh, who am I that a king would bleed and die for? &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, who am I that he would pray? Not my will but thine, Lord. &gt;&gt; Not my will but thine, Lord. [singing] &gt;&gt; The answer I may never know. Just why he ever loved me. to [music] an old [singing] rugged cross he would go for who am I? &gt;&gt; Oh, and to an [music] old [singing] rugged cross he would go for who am I? Hey, [applause] God bless you all. Pray for me as I sing this. It's been a really long time and I hope I can make it through it. [clears throat] The [singing] room grew still as she made her way to Jesus. She stumbled through the tears that made her blind. [singing] She felt such pain. [music] Some just spoke in anger. Heard folks whisper, "There's no place here for her kind." But still on she came through the shame that flushed her face until [music] at last [singing] she knelt before his feet. And though she spoke no [singing] words, everything she said was heard as she poured her love for the master from her box of alabaster. I've come [singing] to pour my praise on him like oil from Mary's alabaster box. Don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and I dry them with my hair. [singing] You who weren't there the night Jesus found me. [singing] You did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his loving arms around me. And you don't know the cost of [music] the oil in my alabaster box. I can't forget the way life used to be. I was a prisoner to the sin that held me bound. [singing] [music] I spent my days poured my [singing] life without [music] measure into a little treasure box I thought I'd found. [singing] until the day when [singing] Jesus came to me. He healed my soul with the wonder of his touch. So now I'm giving back to him. All the praise he's worthy of. I've been forgiven. That's [music] why I love [singing] him so much. [screaming] I've come to pour my praise on him like oil from Mary's alabaster box. [music] Don't be angry if I wash his feet with [music] my tears and I dry them with my hair. You [singing and music] weren't there the night Jesus found me. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; You did not feel what I felt when he [music] wrapped his loving arms around me. And you don't know [singing and music] the cost of the oil in my alabaster box. Sing it with me. I've come to pour my praise on him like oil [singing] alabaster box. So don't be angry if I wash his feet with my [singing] tears and I dry them with my hair. You [singing] weren't there the night Jesus found me. And you did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his loving arms around me. And you don't know the cost of the oil in my alabaster bone. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise [snorts] the Lord. Tell you, every time you think about [music] what he's done for you, where he's took you from in this world and gave you salvation, I'm so thankful today. Just thought we would sing [music] this song. [music] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to criticize [singing] when [music] someone else fails. It's so easy to [singing] see faults in them when we overlook ourselves. [music] Lord knows I'm not perfect. I [singing] don't deserve to throw rocks at anyone. So [singing and music] when there's a mistake, let [singing] it be this [music] one. &gt;&gt; If I'm guilty, [singing and music] let me be guilty of too much mercy. [music and singing] If I'm going to be wrong, let me [music and singing] be wrong for treating someone else right. [music] &gt;&gt; I don't want to purse down. All I want to do now is help [music] my brother [singing] back on his feet. If I'm guilty, [music and singing] let me be guilty of too much mercy. [singing] &gt;&gt; So many moments [music] I'm busy [singing] taking when I should be g. [music] So [singing] many moments I'm busy [music] talking when I should be giving. Yeah, [music] I need to make it more about others. Time after time [singing] I have found [music] the simple truth. Whatever you give is going to come back around. If I'm guilty, [music] let me be guilty of too much [music] mercy. If I'm going to be [singing] wrong, [music] let me be wrong for treating [singing] someone else right. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm first down. All I want to do now [singing] is help my brother back [music] on his feet. &gt;&gt; If I'm guilty, [music] let me be guilty of too much mercy. [music] If I'm guilty, let me be guilty of too much mercy. [singing] [music] If I'm going to be wrong, let me be wrong for treating someone [singing and music] else right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Push [music and singing] down. All I want to do now is help my brother back on his [music and singing] feet. If I'm guilty, let me be guilty of too much [music] mercy. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] Let me be guilty. Too much mercy. You know, he showed us mercy. He came by your way, shaped [music] in sin, speaking lies. Aren't you thankful tonight? We serve a great God. We have a great message. God has revealed the end of the hour and we should be the happiest people. &gt;&gt; You know, there's nothing in the cross that I see that's negative, but nothing but positive. If you ever look at the cross, do you see any negative in the cross? It's always [music] positive. [snorts] I thought about, you know, you do have to have negative trials and [music] hard things in life. But it takes the negative and the positive to crank your car up tonight. If you go crank it up tonight, if you take the negative off, it won't crank. So sometimes you need the negative to just filter out the junk in our life of the trials and tribulations and things we go through. But I'm thankful for it all. He's still worthy of our praise. May God bless you tonight. Let's [music] just turn to him tonight. Let's just pray. Father, we love you, God, as we turn the order of the service, [music] Lord. God, the most important part is the hearing of your word. [music] And God, we stand before your people today, God, and just ask you would speak, [music] Lord. God, you'd have your way tonight. God, we love you, Father. We serve such a great God. You're you've been God, you've always been there [music] for us. You never forsaken us. God, we might have forsaken you, but you've never forsaken us. God, we're thankful for this truth and thankful for this church. And brother Ber, may you bless them tonight, Lord. May you touch them. Father, may you touch your people. May you encourage us. May you stop by [music] and lift us up in heavenly places tonight in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you tonight. I just again want to speak your labor is not in vain. Excuse my voice, but we'll get through it. Labor is not in vain. I just maybe put that part two, but I just felt led to finish it out. I was going to go a different direction, but I just feel led just to bring this out again as we turn to 1 Corinthians 15:E 50. As we stand, it' be great. 1 Corinthians 15:50-58. Read this and I'll get into some more of this. 1 Corinthians 15:50-58. It says now it says this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God nor doeth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold I show you a min a mystery. We shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye. Are you waiting for that day? at the last trump. For the shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For the incorruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. Aren't you thankful God took your place tonight? He He became sin that you may not become sin. &gt;&gt; He became cor He corruption where we could we could get salvation. Verse [snorts] 54. So when this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory. Aren't you thankful there's no more death to a Christian? Verse 55, oh death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is of the law. And as I spoke before, but thanks be to God which give us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Not through some other god tonight, not through some other Buddha tonight that over in India, they they serve all these gods. Hundreds and hundreds of gods, but but you've been enlightened to serve one Lord Jesus Christ. And he goes on to verse say verse 58. Therefore, my beloved brethren, it says, "Be yet steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. For so much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord." May God has blessings. You may be seated. Aren't you thankful that your labor is not in vain? &gt;&gt; There's a lot of stuff we could do tonight. You can go home. You can go watch a ball game. Whatever it is, but you're here tonight and I'm here to tell you, your labor is not in vain. Just because I'm laboring up here, you're laboring. You're pulling on the word of God. And I just ask you tonight just to pull on the word as it comes forth and let you get your blessing. But it's not in vain what you're doing, what you're coming to church, bringing your kids day after day, service after service. &gt;&gt; And it might be that very service tonight that you walk out well. &gt;&gt; It might be the very service tonight you check your bank account and you got more money than you than you left with. &gt;&gt; There might be a job offer on Monday morning because you came today. &gt;&gt; You never know. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But our God looks at your faithfulness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Your God looks on the inside of the heart. &gt;&gt; And that's why I love what brother Brandwood would, and I'm paraphrasing tonight, but God would look at the inside of your heart tonight. And he doesn't look through our mind. Aren't you glad God doesn't look at your mind tonight like we look at other people and we go, "Well, we think he does this and we think they're this." But aren't you glad our God Aren't you glad we're not to judge everybody &gt;&gt; because we probably wouldn't. There wouldn't be many saved probably. &gt;&gt; But our God looks past the mind. He looks inside your heart. &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Brother Chris, I'm I'm a million miles away." But hey, you're still go in progression tonight. We're all sons and daughters of a king. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean that you're not going to fall up and make mistakes. And there's nothing that my sons can do that they come to me and tell me, "Daddy, I messed up. I done this." And hey, hey, you know what? Make it right &gt;&gt; that I not put them up in my hold them and say, "No matter what age you are, I forgive you and Jesus Christ forgives you." &gt;&gt; And so, how much more does the father forgive us when we're falling short? And we're falling short in life. And there's things that young people, you're going to fall short in things. &gt;&gt; But it's the the thing you need to understand is you got to get back up. &gt;&gt; You got to keep pressing on. I fall every day. Every single day, I need I need to I need to look in the mirror and say, "Lord, but your mercies are new every morning." &gt;&gt; I like what David says because you realize you need them mercies every day. Not just not just on Sunday, but Monday through Friday through Saturday through Sunday, we need his mercies. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, if you say, "Brother Chris, I think I went too far." And maybe you felt like I've gone too far from the God. But guess what? If there's that deep cause, too deep to respond, there's some you be thankful tonight that there's something on the inside saying, "That's me, Lord. That's me. I come another service and maybe this service will be your breakthrough. &gt;&gt; Maybe this service you'll leave without depression and anxiety or whatever you keep bringing in every single day. &gt;&gt; And too many times we we carry our stuff that he says my yoke is light. &gt;&gt; Too many times we we carry our baggage and we we carry past sin. We carry past mistakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. when God wants, he's already carried it to the cross. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I'm just way off my notes, but here I am. But I but I but I'm here to TELL YOU THAT WE got to STOP CARRYING IT. IT'S NOT YOUR DUTY to carry it. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ carried it all [snorts] &gt;&gt; and it's not in vain. He went to the CROSS AND HIS BLOOD is still dripping for every one of you tonight. &gt;&gt; Every single one of you BY NAME. HAS CALLED YOU OUT BY THE CROSS. &gt;&gt; Make it personal tonight. &gt;&gt; Make it personable in a way that when he looks when he was on the cross, you by name was on his mind. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't in vain. He got beaten. He didn't get beaten in vain. He He kept his mouth shut for me and you. He could have called 10 million legions of angels down from heaven to end it right away. But he knew he saw me and you today. HE SAW US COMING TO CHURCH AND AND THROUGH THIS LIFE AND GOING THROUGH HEARTACHES AND MAYBE LOSING MY HOUSE AND MAYBE LOSING MY CAR, BUT his increase is better. &gt;&gt; And maybe you've lost a loved one or maybe you lost a job. WHATEVER IT IS, BUT GOD is still worthy of our praise. &gt;&gt; And maybe you think like Job tonight, JOB LOST IT ALL, BOYS. HE WOULD GOT SICK. HE uh he tried Job. Who can I try? Who's worthy? And he looks at he says, "Try job. He won't curse me. He won't he he he he's a worthy man." &gt;&gt; And maybe you come in this church and you're like, "Brother Chris, I'm tired. I'm weary. I've lived in the message long enough, but I'm here to tell you, don't live in the message. Let the message live in you. &gt;&gt; Let the message be a part of your life. Let the word of God shine in your heart and live for him forever. &gt;&gt; But it says, "Be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding." I love that. And the work of the Lord, his work is not finished. Maybe you be the last hands and feet that's all he's got to get that last person in. Praise God. If I could tell you, I would give all the money I have, which ain't much. I give it all to you if you could find the last person because this is a pess house to me. Every single day you live in it, you're like, "How are we making it day by day? The government's corrupt. Everything's corrupt. The only thing we got is a solid foundation is the word of God. &gt;&gt; It has been opened before our day from Genesis to Revelation. And you have been given the sword. &gt;&gt; Every one of you has been given the sword of the king. &gt;&gt; And you go, "Well, brother Brandham, it came down in Arizona and he got the sword of the king, but he got the sword of the king and he's handed it off to each and every one of us. He's gave YOU A SWORD TO FIGHT THE devil anywhere, anytime, any place, &gt;&gt; and we take it for granted that it came to him and he passed it off to you &gt;&gt; because he says this message must live. I'm talking about live individuals, not live on a book, not live on a bookshelf, not live on these iPads, but live on the inside and be something that you're walking written epistles read of all men. People are watching you. Your grandchildren are watching you. Maybe you say, "Brother Chris, I kind of lost one." Well, guess what? It's not in vain. You look at me like, "Well, that's crazy. It's not in vain." No, you can have your house. your whole house tonight. The devil will tell you, "Well, my house is." You can have your house, just apply it to them. &gt;&gt; Just because YOUR FAITHFULNESS, YOUR ENTIRE home comes in. &gt;&gt; For the ones you love than the ones that loved you, &gt;&gt; you talking about grace tonight. That's the grace of God. I don't care how far they look, how far they can sin. I tell you, my God's my God's blood that shaped iniquity. My blood, God's blood that shed on Calvary, I'm sorry, shed on Calvary is still dripping tonight for every one of lost souls. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's your family member tonight. Maybe you got a brother, a sister, whatever uh here in the world, but God's going to call them in one day. &gt;&gt; God's going to call every one of them in &gt;&gt; just because of your stance in Jesus Christ. I like where 1 Corinthians 15 and and and I read this earlier, but this other translation says, "So now, beloved ones, stand firm, stable, enduring. Live your lives with an unshakable confidence." &gt;&gt; I think it would do good us tonight to have an unshakable confidence. You know, you might say, "Well, I probably don't want to boast, RIGHT?" NO, BUT JUST HAVE A CONFIDENCE. You know what your savior did for you. know that the blood is sufficient for all your needs. Whatever needs you got, it's sufficient. &gt;&gt; Whatever sin you committed, whatever you did last night, whatever you did today, whatever you're going to do, that the cross is three-dimensional. &gt;&gt; It's for your past sin, your present sin, and your future sin. &gt;&gt; Oh, think about it tonight. It don't JUST COVER YOUR PAST. IT covers your present and it covers your future sin. That's how strong Jesus's blood is. [applause] That covers it all. Aren't you thankful tonight? As I read earlier, the definition of steadfast is firm, fixed, unwavering, dependable. That's hard to find today. Dependable. I have a little little little job and you barely get anybody to come in to work today. They want to call in about this. My tooth hurts or a lot my this way my my wheel fell off or it's always some excuse. &gt;&gt; I ran out of gas. &gt;&gt; My my mama's foot hurts. It don't matter. &gt;&gt; It's always an excuse. But I'm here to tell you, WHEN I SHOW UP TO the kingdom one day, when I show up to the gate, when I get to heaven, I This is how we should all be. When we should get up to heaven, THERE'S ONE PLACE YOU SHOULD SHOW UP EXHAUSTED. That's when you get to the end of the gate and you should just be going, "Brother Joe, oh, I barely MADE IT, BUT I MADE IT." [applause] That's when you SHOULD SHOW UP EXHAUSTED. YOU SHOULD SHOW UP EXHAUSTED RIGHT WHEN YOU get up to Jesus Christ. Say, "God, I just fall in your arms." &gt;&gt; That's where you want to show up exhausted. And I tell you what, I might be exhausted tonight, but it's worth it all. &gt;&gt; It's worth it all for one more soul. &gt;&gt; One more saint to say, "God, I want to serve you more. I want to give my life. I want to pray more. I want to read my Bible more. but be fixed, unwavering, dependable, constantly faithful of what I have. And then I wrote down unmovable. Unmovable means to [snorts] be not to be pushed off course. Shaken. I tell you, we're living in a time that if you can be shaken, you will be shaken. We're living in a message of the hour where they can look at quotes and twist this quote and say this date and that date. But I'm here to tell you if it line still lines up with the word, I take the entire book. &gt;&gt; You got to line it up from Genesis to Revelation. &gt;&gt; The prophet of our hour, you know, they want to say this. He made I'll tell you what, to me, he may he didn't he might have made mistakes as a man, but he still brought the revealed word of God. &gt;&gt; And he's made Jesus Christ revealed in your day. &gt;&gt; That's right. There's many people we'll go through the airport and I I was in Dallas the other week preaching a couple weeks ago, brother Dallas David McGary's and everybody looks chaotic. You drive through there and you go up through there, everybody looks depressed 100 miles an hour and they got a void that I can walk through the AIRPORT AND SAY, "LORD, I'M SO GLAD I'M NOT ONE OF THEM. &gt;&gt; Doesn't make me any better. I'm just It just shows me how much more grace I can take. It makes ME GO, "LORD, I'M THANKFUL FOR calling me out." WHEN YOU SEE THIS LOST WORLD DYING and going to hell &gt;&gt; and you know what? Hell wasn't made for them all. He said, "Whosoever will come, let him come." His much grace is so extended to the entire world. But we forget. Maybe it's at the gas station. Maybe it's on your job. Maybe he doesn't look like you. Maybe she don't look like you. But you let God do the cleaning. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You just be the you just be the the oil that comes on the outside and they go, "I want what he's got. &gt;&gt; I want what he's got." But unstable, pushed off course, shaken or shifted away from the truth of God's word. You know, I tell you, I I just believe the word of God. Once you get truly anchored in Jesus Christ, once you get anchored in this message of the hour, you will not leave &gt;&gt; because you are part of God. &gt;&gt; You can't leave. Once you get anchored in to this truth, you can't leave. Maybe it's crossed your mind. Well, this might be THE TRUTH. THIS NO, IT IS THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; It's the revelation of Jesus Christ. You wouldn't know about water baptism. And I guess he does say water baptism, you don't need a revelation, but you wouldn't know what happened in the garden. You would all through the entire the entire book, all the seals were open for you, for me. God knew that we had to stand in the toughest day, the hardest day when all the hell of uh demons have released on the earth. &gt;&gt; But you going to get on there on that day and Paul's going to ask you how you made it. They're going to look at you and you're going to say, "How did you do it?" No, they're going to say, "No, how did you make it? I didn't even see NO LIGHT." YOU MIGHT SEE LIGHT, but there is no light. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham in his day had him come ac the the agents come across the back wall and he penciled a little. It was complete darkness. &gt;&gt; And he penciled a little bit of light for me and you tonight. He saw believers. He saw you, every one of you. AND HE SAID, "I'LL PENCIL A GRACE for you." &gt;&gt; Because he knew there'll be a small in number, &gt;&gt; but mighty in Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; but be strong, unmovable. It's not in vain. You [snorts] might say, "Well, Brother Chris, I've been praising this long. I've been worship leading this long." I don't care. It's not in vain. WHEN YOU WORSHIP GOD, IT'S NOT IN VAIN. &gt;&gt; When you read your Bible, it's not in vain. When you get on YOUR KNEES AND PRAY, IT'S NOT IN VAIN. &gt;&gt; It makes you that much stronger for God. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I read a quote not long ago. He said, "You can get to a place where the devil doesn't know what to do with you." Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, when I get out of the bed, I want the devil to say, "Here he goes again." &gt;&gt; Brother Joe, here he comes. HE'S WAKING UP. LORD JESUS, DON'T WAKE him up. &gt;&gt; LET HIM PASS ON. LET HIM GO TO GLORY. &gt;&gt; HE WON'T SHUT up about the truth because he knows my beginning and he knows my end. &gt;&gt; It's been revealed to you, brother. It's been revealed to you, sister, tonight. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You might ask for a million dollars of this and that, but you've got a million dollars. &gt;&gt; You got more than a million dollars. You've got the entire book that's been handed to you. And what are you doing with it? &gt;&gt; Are you letting it sit where it be just dusty? But are you being his hands and his feet tonight? Are you into a lost world today that you can tell people about Jesus? It's so easy. I'm telling you, it's so easy just to sit there and say, "It's me and my four and no more." &gt;&gt; It's easy to listen to a message and say, "Well, my family's in. I'll forget the others." But I'm hearing today that we need to stop worrying about that. We need to get as many people. I'm like on a rescue boat. Come on, keep throwing them. Keep throwing them. &gt;&gt; As many as you ever been on, you ever saw a cruise ship and went to a gospel cruise one time and I was telling that brother, they shut down everything. They shut by the bars. They shut It was amazing. They shut down everything. And they shut down they they had no just regular drinks. It was just amazing. But I saw these little boats and he's got these little rescue boats all down the side. And I said, "Lord, how many people on this boat needs the rescue of the Holy Ghost? How many people in this boat still are singing about you, quoting your scriptures, and on that day they'll say, "Depart from me. I never knew you." &gt;&gt; But you have been get given eternal life. You've been given the key to unlock the door. &gt;&gt; You should walk around the out of this church today with your head held high. You should be the happiest people. I don't care what your circumstance looks. I don't care what your storm you're going through. You need to start telling your storm who your God is. &gt;&gt; You need to start telling your circumstance who your God is. &gt;&gt; You need to start not telling God what your circumstance is. Tell your circumstance who your God is. &gt;&gt; Tell him who your God is. &gt;&gt; As greater is he that's in us than he that's of the world. as [snorts] we get to it. Uh, I'll try to get through it. But brother Bram says that this quote, he says, "Today, while the harvest is on, it don't say, "Let's sit down and gather sheav and sit in the house." &gt;&gt; It says, "Let's go about gathering the sheav everywhere, wherever God gives you to do, you're a little housewife. Testify." He said, "Testify to the neighbors or something." He said, "Do something. and bring somebody with you when you come. He said, "I must carry home to a heaven on a flower bed of ease while others fight to win the prize." Oh, and sail through the bloody seas. He said, "No, I must fight. I must I must reign. Increase my courage, Lord." He said, "That's my prayer." Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Tell tell me not in mournal moral numbers, mortal numbers, life is just an empty dream." He is quoting this little uh psalm or song. He says, "And the soul is dead that slumbers and things are not what they seem." Yeah. Life is real and life is earnest. And the grave is not its goal. Dust thou earth to dust to returnest was not speakest to the soul. He said that's right. He said lives of great men all remind us and we have make our lives sublime with partings behi left leave behind us footprints on the sands of time. He said foot pits to perhaps another selling over life solemn. He said for a four-long and shipwreck brother sin shall take heart again. [snorts] He goes on to say, he says, in the power of decision, if a man once anchors, listen to this, if a one if a man once anchors his heart against the heart of Calvary, all devils in hell will never shake him no more. &gt;&gt; He said he's there. He said, notice, he said, for he that cannot stand chastisement is an illegitimate child. He said he claims God to be his father when he's not. He's just tossed about by every wind of doctrine, not stable. Don't you think that's the day we live in? And don't know where he's going. He's doubleminded and a lot of times double tonged and don't know where he's standing or what you're talking about. He goes on to say, "Then a man that's born again of the spirit OF GOD KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE HE'S AT." &gt;&gt; He said, "That's right. there. Nothing phases him because something on the inside of him has already witnessed somebody outside the cloud yonder. &gt;&gt; He said, "And by faith, he sees him." Do you see him tonight? Maybe you don't see him spiritually, but on the heart, you should feel that theophony pulling you to a higher place. You should be like, I don't know WHY THE GRAVITY IS holding me here, but I'm here to tell you this BODY IS NOT MADE. I belong to that body. &gt;&gt; I like that song my wife sings. I think it goes they'll we'll speed up and they'll slow down. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for that day. I'm waiting for my mother to walk through that door between that sixth and nine hour &gt;&gt; and say, "Son, everything you preached about, everything you talked about, everything you stroll about, all the miles YOU DROVE WERE NOT IN VAIN. &gt;&gt; All the times you came to church, all the times you pray, all the times you READ YOUR BIBLE WAS NOT IN VAIN." &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; You could put all your time here. YOU PUT ALL YOUR TIME HERE. Where's your time spent? &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Whether the planes are rocking, whether the lightnings are flashing, whether the spies has gun on me, whether it is, it doesn't matter. I'm going to press. I'm going to sit down in the battle. I'm going to press the battle by the grace OF GOD WHILE I PREACH THE GOSPEL to every creature and every person that I can. &gt;&gt; Persuading them. He said persuading them to he said to do to to that beautiful land yonder. I'm here to persuade you today. You don't want to miss it for the world. &gt;&gt; You can miss ball game. You could be late for dinner. You could be missed every single appointment. But don't miss this one appointment. &gt;&gt; Don't miss the appointment that the ark door is closing. &gt;&gt; I went here to tell you venture to say when he built the ark for 120 years. You don't think he got criticism? &gt;&gt; He's like, "Well, well, why?" Well, you think about the message believers today or people that come and get the message. Well, Noah, I just got a question. Wouldn't you build the the boat near the water? Why would you just pick a big boat that we've had no rain and you're going to put it out in the over here and no? Well, cuz I'm going to show you how big my God is &gt;&gt; for 120 years. Yes, he probably went through a lot and a lot and a lot of hatreds, name calling or brandites or whatever they want to call you. But I'm here to tell you, one day they're GOING TO CALL YOU GONE. &gt;&gt; That's the day you should be striving for. &gt;&gt; That's why I drive millions and hundreds of miles or whatever it is JUST FOR SEE ONE MORE soul get the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; He says whether it's not matter. He says persuading them to go look at the land you're under. I [snorts] like what Galatians 6:9 says. We're talking about uh it's not in vain. It says let us not be weary and welloing. There's nothing in here that says sit down. &gt;&gt; There's nothing in my Bible that tells you to go sit down and hang out and just relax cuz you got all the truth. &gt;&gt; It says let us be not be weary and welloing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not. &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. Hebrews 6:10 uh 6:10. For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of what? Love which you have showed toward his name. It says in in that you have ministered to saints and do minister. Isaiah, I'm just reminding you Isaiah 55:11. So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void. But it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the things where I see it. Psalms 126. We'd be here all night showing you stuff that's not in vain. [snorts] Psalms 126 5-6. They that sow in tears reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheav with him. The prophet of God says, he goes on to say, he said, but it's accepting the person in Christ Jesus. And these other things that come right on in and they fit together. He said, "Let every member in this body this morning, let this little group of people," he said, "if you could pull the curtain down." Listen, if you could pull the curtains down along each side, every person in here to receive the person in Christ Jesus, there would never be a fuss. There would never be an argument. Oh my. He said, "I just be perfect. It would just be perfect love. Yeah, you'd still believe this and believe that, but I I He said, I just be so full of love. He said, now Jesus said, by your fruit you shall know them. &gt;&gt; And the fruit of the spirit is what? Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, meekness, gentleness. goes on to say, he says, 'Now, he said, 'I give you my estimation of what I think that the closest thing to an evidence that a man is a Christian than anything I know of. You know what it is? It's a travail of a soul. A person that's always so hungering, he didn't say sit back and not eat. He says, he said always hungering and thirsting of God. He said, 'Th that's just simply the day and night. They just can't stand it. They've got to do something for God. [snorts] &gt;&gt; They're full of love and they just their soul travails. They're travail almost. The Bible said, "He that goeth forth so to tears would doubtless return again rejoicing bringing him with precious sheav." So in other words, get to work. In other words, as my grandfather would say, put the pedal to the metal. &gt;&gt; Don't sit back and relax. It's not a time to sit back and relax. It's a time to press on. It's the time, you know, when he went behind the uh when when they brought his when he went over to the uh he pulled his way in the other dimension and he was sitting on the bed and his his hands around him and he went to the other dimension, he didn't want to get back in that body and he came back and he said, "You don't want to miss it for the world. &gt;&gt; You don't want to miss it." He couldn't even describe how beautiful it was. He did a little bit, but he couldn't even You couldn't even taste how heaven's going to be. But I'm here to tell you, give it all you got for Jesus. Young people, sell out to God. Don't sell out to drugs, alcohol, lust, everything of this world. Give your life to Jesus now. &gt;&gt; Give it to Christ. As first Corinthians says set three [snorts] verse 7-9 so that he neither then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that waterth but God that giveth what? The increase. You don't have to worry about the increase. You just you just bring it to God and let him do the increase. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he that planteth, he that waterth are one, and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. Verse nine, for we are what? Laborers together. I say us together with God. Ye are God's husbander and ye are God's building. Oh, I love that. I just got a lot of scriptures I'm finishing. Philippians 2:16, holding forth the world of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain. Can you imagine on that day people singing in his name, people traveling the world in his name, big artist, big fame, Michael Jordan, all these people making millions and billions of dollars, &gt;&gt; but they don't have one thing that you got. Can you imagine on that day when they get there, that money ain't going to matter anymore. &gt;&gt; Because we all go if we we go by the grave, we all go by that six-foot hole. &gt;&gt; But when we meet Jesus Christ, he said every knee shall bow, every tongue will confess that day. Even the atheists will have to confess. They will have to even bow to that name, &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But you should the happiest people tonight. &gt;&gt; You really should. We should. We should not wake up all dreary and down and out every day and get up and go, "Well, I'm just going to barely MAKE IT." NO, YOU'VE ALREADY MADE IT. &gt;&gt; God has opened the book. HE'S GAVE IT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; It's you. You got to accept it. &gt;&gt; That the door, if I walked IN THAT DOOR, GOD IS KNOCKING AT that door tonight. Maybe he's taking that door tonight. And maybe, I don't know, this ain't in my notes, but maybe he's standing at the door knocking tonight. &gt;&gt; Do you hear that? Tonight, God might be knocking at your door tonight saying, "Let me in." &gt;&gt; Because guess what? You're on the inside of that door and you have to open it. Our God is a gentleman. Jesus Christ is a gentleman. And he wants you to open the door. And not just your living room, not just your kitchen, but your master bedroom, your bedroom, all the doors of own doors. &gt;&gt; And maybe you should go home and just clean out some stuff tonight. Kick stuff out. I don't know what it is, but I'm here to tell you, maybe it's a house cleaning time, sir. &gt;&gt; Maybe you do this. maybe do that. I always tell my boys, yeah, my boys had the phone the other day. I said, "You control this. It doesn't control you." &gt;&gt; And let Jesus get on the inside and let him control you. Let him be your power. &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. I'm telling you, when you get there on that day, we'll say, "Brother Chris, well, you remember that service we had? Praise God. It was not in vain. Brother Joe, I'm tell you what, I'm gonna be dancing. Whatever y'all want to do, I'm gonna be dancing. Whatever. I'm tell you what, I I'll be dancing like David danced. Maybe you'll be crying. Maybe you'll be shouting. Whatever it is, &gt;&gt; but I tell you what, I take you all to a ball game tonight. I bet you wouldn't sit just &gt;&gt; It's the fourth quarter. We got 236 races. Say we We're on the We're on the second race. where we got we done went 300 laps in NASCAR. I've been there when I was in the world. [snorts] Not saying nothing against it. I'm just telling you my dad took me and I sat there and I'll never forget we watched your brother Joe. We were down to like 300. He said, "Hey, you want to beat the crowd?" I'm like, "Dad, we got 15 laps left. Are you crazy?" Like, I want to watch this. But how is that our life, guys? Don't I don't think we got but five laps left. &gt;&gt; It's dark out there. &gt;&gt; We're down to the last five laps. Don't give up. We're down. It's like dad's like, "All right, let's go. Let's beat him to the car." Here we are. We're rushing to the car and we parked like 100 miles away. I'm like, "If we're going to park A 100 MILES AWAY, WHY WHY DIDN'T WE WAIT THE LAST lap and then we leave? We get out there in 5 minutes." He said, "See, I bet you they waited three hours. I waited to see the end." I don't know about you, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING THROUGH TRIALS AND tribulations and and trolling through life and reading our Bible and praying for just not &gt;&gt; it's NOT IN VAIN. WE'RE LAST TO LAST LAP. WE'RE COMING AROUND the last corner. &gt;&gt; We're coming around the last corner. And I'm here to tell you to get in. &gt;&gt; If I got to provoke you to get, I got to pick you up and put you in. Let's go. &gt;&gt; It's time to go. &gt;&gt; We're about to take liftoff. &gt;&gt; It's about a count. It's a countdown time. &gt;&gt; We're living in a countdown day. And young people, I want to tell you to I tell you, sell out to Jesus. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I didn't do it. But I'm here to tell you, if I could do it all over, there's a lot of things I would change. And I'm still reaping what I sowed. &gt;&gt; But you sew the right seeds. &gt;&gt; Live for God. [snorts] Find a faithful. Find some If you date somebody, make sure they love God more than they love you. I didn't have that in my notes, but there it was. 1 Thessalonians 3:5. For this cause, when I could no longer be forebear, I sent to you to know your faith, least by some means the tempter have tempted you, and your labor is what? Not in vain. Your labor is not in vain. Matthew 6:6. But now, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, [snorts] and thou what has shut the door, pray, thy father, which is in secret, and thy father will seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. [snorts] Maybe it's sometime tonight, maybe just just lay down your bed and just get on your knees and say, "Lord, I just want to tell you I love you. &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to ask for anything. I just want to tell you I love you. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Maybe young people, you get at your your bed and just lift your hands and say, "Lord, I don't even know what to say to you. All I know to tell you is I love you. It will not be in vain." I thought about where we're talking about Noah. [snorts] The people mocked him. They ignored him. You know what also? They rejected his message for 120 years. They rejected his message. And the prophet of God brought his message in his day. and it was rejected. It was turned down from the US. But guess what? You've accepted it. You've accepted it. That should put something on the inside tonight. I know everybody's probably tired and weary and got full of mashed potatoes, but our God's still good. &gt;&gt; But think about his obedience. It was not in vain. God [snorts] kept his word. And guess what? The ark what? It floated through every trial. &gt;&gt; He built this ark for 120 years. And all them task masters were looking down at him. And brother Bram said he put one window in the ark where he could look up. And I'm here to tell you, if you don't have any other window in your life, look up and know where your blessings are coming from. Look up and say, "Lord, I'm thankful for all your benefits." If he doesn't do one more thing for you, he's still good. &gt;&gt; He's still worthy of our praise. He's still worthy of everything we got. If he don't do anything before you, if your power bill don't get paid, your lights get shut off. &gt;&gt; He's still good. &gt;&gt; His obedience preserved, Think about this. I wrote this down. His obedience preserved the future of humanity. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; I thought about Elijah. Let's turn there real quick. First Kings 18 Kings 18. &gt;&gt; Elijah on Mount Carmel. &gt;&gt; And I thought, look at Elijah was here with the prophets of Bal. 450 prophets grows 400 850 false prophets. Think about this. Israel doubted. The kings resisted him. Think about this. Some things I wrote down. God answered with fire. It was not in vain. Listen to this in verse 22 of 18. He says, "Then Elijah said unto the people, I remain a prophet of the Lord and but Baal's prophet are 450 men." He said, "Let them therefore give us two bollocks, and they choose one bo of themselves, and they [snorts] lay the wood, they put on the fire, and he called on the name of your gods. And I'll call on my name of what?" The Lord. &gt;&gt; They called on a bunch of gods. You don't need a bunch of gods. You just need one Lord. &gt;&gt; You need one experience with our Lord. You don't need a bunch of worldly gods. You don't need a bunch of this and that. You just need one experience with the Lord. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, he says, "But let him," he said, he answered in verse 24, he said, "And they called on the name of their gods, of your gods, and I'll call on the name of the Lord." And the God that answered by fire, let him be God. And [snorts] all the people of Ezra said, "It's well spoken." And Elijah said unto your prophets, "Choose you one bullet yourself, and dress it the first, for ye are many." And he called on the name of the gods on of your gods, but no fire under. And they that took the bulock were given to the dressed it, and called the name of Bale from the [snorts] morning until noon, saying, "Oh Bale, hear us." But here was no voice, no answer. And they leaped upon the altar which was made. And it came to pass at noon, verse 27. I'm showing you something that's not in vain. Elijah mocked them and said, "Cry aloud, for he is a god." Either he's talking or he's pursu pursuing or he's journey or or maybe he's asleep. &gt;&gt; Maybe your god is asleep. &gt;&gt; Maybe you need to wake him up. That's what he said. He must be awakened. He goes on to say, basically, I put in my notes, he's not responding. &gt;&gt; His gods are not responding. &gt;&gt; But let me show you something that's not in vain. And they cried aloud and they cut themselves and their manner which knives and and lassets until they blood gushed out of them. And it came to pass the midday pass that prophesied until the time offering and eating sacrifice. And there was neither voice nor any answer in any that regarding Elijah said unto all the people come near unto me. All the people came unto him and they repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. Elijah took 12 stones according to the number of tribes of Jacob. Let's [snorts] just skip down for time. Verse 33. And he put the wood in the order of the cut of the pieces of the boan pieces and laid them on the the wood. And he filled four barrels with water. He filled it with the burnt sacrifice on the wood and he said, "Do it a second time." He said, "Do it again." And he said, "Do it a third time." And they did it a third time. And the water ran about all through the altar and filled the trench also with water. That's how confidence he was in his God. &gt;&gt; Not just do it one time, but let me tell you, do it again. &gt;&gt; And do it again. and then fill the whole trench up with water. &gt;&gt; And [snorts] then he goes on to say, I'm just showing you, he knew his God was not in vain. And he said to him, "And it came to pass, verse 36, and the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, the legion of Elijah the prophet came near, and the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art a God of Israel, and thou am I thy servant. Thou have done all these things in thy word. Hear [snorts] me, oh God. Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me. I think some of us tonight could just say, "God, hear me, oh Lord." When's the last time you called on your Lord? And said, "I'm in this situation. I've told everybody about it. I've let all the Facebook know, but when have I let you know? When have I said, "Lord, here am I." He goes on to say he verse he says servant he said I've done all these things in the word he said hear me oh lord hear me that these people may know that they are lord our god I would say that tonight hear me oh lord that you hear that the ark door is closing then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and stones and dust not just the wood just the stones not just the dust. But I'm tell you how powerful our God is. He licked all the water that was in the trench. He even licked the dust off the ground. [snorts] THAT'S OUR GOD. THAT'S YOUR GOD TONIGHT. If he can do it for him, you can lift him up out of history and he can do it for you. &gt;&gt; He just took the dust. It took the stones, the dust, the wood. It looked up all the water in the trench. And all these people saw and fell on their faces and they said, "The Lord God, he is the God. The Lord, the Lord, he is the God." Aren't you thankful? We were in Israel when we went by the tomb. We have an empty tomb today. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go to Israel to see it. It should be in your heart. &gt;&gt; You should know that he's been risen and he lives on individuals, me and you, tonight. &gt;&gt; That you're not just here taking up air. Maybe maybe some of us are, but not all of us. &gt;&gt; And like I was saying, you could go to a ball game tonight. I remember I never forget, brother Joe, I went to a baseball game one time and I was screaming and yelling and my boy goes, "Daddy, I hope you do that on Sunday. He got me back." And on Sunday, I was bringing it &gt;&gt; cuz I said, "Lord, I'm not going to let that ball I'm not going to worship that ball more than I worship you." [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; And that's how we should be. I'm not saying be so legalism where you can't do this and you can't do this and you can't and you're just like a robot. Well, that's just a book of laws. No, you should be living on the inside. You should have a life and you should enjoy life and you should get out here and be the best Christian you can be. Wherever it's on the ball field or maybe it's on your job or wherever you're at, you can be the best Christian you can be. &gt;&gt; But too many times we take a message and we go, "Hey boys, it's a book. Let me beat you with it. &gt;&gt; Let me beat you with this Bible." And before you know it, they're way down the street somewhere and they don't want nothing what you got. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell my boys all the time, this is the best life you can have. You can be the fun. You can have the best life and have the funnest time as a Christian. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for the balance tonight. &gt;&gt; I tell you, get in the middle. Don't get too far to the left and so legalism to the right, but get in the middle of the road. Someone said, "Well, you're going to get hit." No, it's a one-way street &gt;&gt; and it's going to glory. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I thought about Ruth as we come down to a close and I just want to bring out something with Ruth tonight. I'll try to hurry where you don't fall asleep. But but I just thought three I thought about Ruth, if you turn to Ruth real quick, that she knew her God was not in vain. I thought I was just praising the Lord back there thinking about Ruth. You know what? That's your book. That's me and you today. That's our love letter to the bride tonight. That book was written for me and you to look back and you [snorts] know what? She was a Moabitete and I didn't even deserving to be in that lineage of Boaz. You were a gentile. You we were not me and you were not even in the lineage of of the Je of back to the Jews. But God by his grace and mercy turned from his own children to say, "Hey, here's some grace. Here's some light for our day." &gt;&gt; He blinded his own kid, his children to say, "Hey, there's more Gentiles." But I like what Ruth and I'll try to be quick with it, but he goes on to say about Ruth, how it was not in vain. And I like what it said. You know the book of Ruth. Most people probably know the book of Ruth. If you get a chance, it's only for it's only four. So if you can read it, it's wonderful. I just I read it all the time. I love it. But I just think about what a love story it is to us that here she is that Moab and Orpa. [snorts] Here she is going to Moab. And there were women of Moab and Orpa and Ruth. And you think about it, they had a choice to follow after her her sons died. Naomi, they asked Ruth, she said, "Ruth, entreat me not to leave thee or return." Verse six, and Ruth, verse uh chapter 1, it says, "After thee, for whether thou goest or whether thou lodest, I'll lodge. Let my people be thy people and and and thy God be my God. I tell you, I think that's where a place we got to get in our life where I I want I want to see Jesus Christ. And she goes on to say, he goes, [snorts] she goes, verse 18 says, when she saw that that she was steadfast, listen, when Ruth was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her. She tried to convince her, hey, you don't need to go. I can't have more kids. I don't know who you're looking for. No, I'm just following the God that's inside of you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In verse [snorts] chapter two, I like it. This is what I want to go on to. It's not in vain. And Naomi has a kinsman of her husbands and a mighty man in chapter 2. Verse one, a mighty man of wealth and family, Amalecch, and his name was Boaz. Do you know you have a mighty man of wealth? &gt;&gt; He owns a cattle on a thousand hills. He [snorts] has everything in the palm of his hands &gt;&gt; and that's your Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Put [snorts] your name there tonight. And Ruth the Moabitete said unto Naomi, "Let me now go into the field and glean ears of ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace." And she said unto her, "Go, go, my daughter." And she [snorts] went, and she came and gleaned into the field after the reapers. and he and her and and Hap was the light a part of part of the field belonging to Mo Boaz. Ain't that awesome? She steps into the field that was already prepared for her. Think about it tonight. God has put a field out before you tonight to step into. &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Don't reap in any other field. Don't go to any denominations. You're reaping straight from the word of God. You're reaping straight from heaven tonight. &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't go in any other field belong." He said, "The field belong to Boaz who has the kingdom of Amalecch." Did you know your field tonight is from Amalecch, from Jesus Christ? You're reaping from him. And it came, listen to this verse uh let's just get down to verse six. And the servant was set over reapers answered and said, "Is it a Moabit Moabish woman dam damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab?" And she said, "I" and he said, and she said, I pray, let me glean and gather all the reapers among the sheavs. So she came and hath continued even from the morning until now. Then she terried a little in the house. Do you know she had work to do? She didn't just sit back and relax. She gleaned. She worked in the field. You have work to do. Don't stop. Goes on to say verse 8, as the musicians come, then said Boaz and to Ruth, "Hearest thou thou not, my daughter, go not to glean in another field." And I will here to tell you tonight, don't go to any other denominational field and glean in. There's not another field, church. There's not another field, saints, to glean in. You've been given the best field to glean in. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour has came in your day, and you are gleaning in God's field. &gt;&gt; And I'll finish this. And it says, "Let thine eyes be on the field, and thy do after them. I have not charged the young men. You shall not touch thee." Not only that, you go clean glean in my field and I'll put a shield of protection around you. &gt;&gt; Did you know when you driving down that road, angels are probably in between them lines? That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Because God, when until he's done with you and pulls your card, he says the devil can't do nothing to you. He said the devil can't even do nothing to you unless God permits it. &gt;&gt; And it goes on to say, you shall touch them not. you shall not touch thee. And when thou art, he says, when thy vessels and they drink, verse nine, thou which are young men have drawn. Verse 10, then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him, why have I found grace in thine eyes? I think tonight you can look to me, look to the field, you can look to Jesus Christ, not to me, but you can look to Jesus Christ and fall on your face and say, "How have I found grace in thy sight? How have you gave me the entire book and it's been opened? The entire seals, all the book has been revealed. You are gleaning in heavenly places &gt;&gt; and you should fall on your face tonight and say, Lord, I'm not worthy, &gt;&gt; but you made me worthy. &gt;&gt; As I play something softly, I like verse 11. And it says, "And Boaz answered and said unto her, it hath fully been showed to me all thy and thy mother-in-law and death of thine husband." But listen to this verse 12 and we'll close. The Lord replic rep repreants [music] thy work and what? A full reward. He's gave you a full reward tonight. He's gave you his son that died on the cross, shed his blood and it's not [music] in vain. It's not in vain when you come to church. It's not in vain when you worship God. It's not in vain when you're in your car and you're praising God. It's not in vain when you listen to the tapes. It's not in vain when you pray in your clothes or you pray by yourself or pray in your car or you sing in your car. It's not in vain. &gt;&gt; You're entertaining angels unaware. You could be singing in your car. You could be in the worst mood and all of a sudden the presence of God drop in. Maybe some of you just need to let go and just let your hair down and say, "God, I don't care who looks [music] at my left. I don't care who looks at my right tonight. I just want to praise you. I want to tell you I love you. I want to tell you what you done for me, what you where you brought me from and where I'm going today. Where I could have been and where you are. Look at what God might look at your past, but look what he's doing for you today. Don't focus on the rearview mirror of life. Look what he's doing for you today. Look where he's brought you from, young ones. And if you haven't experienced that, I tell you to get to Jesus. Get to Jesus. It will not be in vain. I pray this stits in your in your life so hard that you realize that it's not in vain. This message is not in vain. The prophet of God didn't iron his suits in his car. He didn't have no money. He brought a message for me and you. And we're reaping what he put in the field. He put the field out. He's plowed the fields. And we're reaping what he's plowed. He's put it all out there. You get into the message. You get into these tapes cuz it will not be in vain. [music] All heads bowed. All heads bowed tonight. Just Just talk to him tonight. Just Just tell him how much you love him. [snorts] Think about where he's brought you from. Think about how he's blessed you. Maybe with a with a with a family, maybe with a be with a lovely home, a wife that loves you, whatever it may be. Just maybe it's just [music] a kid tonight. Maybe maybe you whatever situation you are, there there'll be something that you can thank God about. Just the breath in your body you have tonight. You can go home tonight [music] to a warm home. No matter the size, think about it just for a minute. You get to walk out to a car and put your heater on. Maybe you got heated seats. I'm telling you, church, we live in luxury. We have all the luxuries of this world. But don't forget Jesus. Don't forget the one. Even brother Brandham had to have Jesus. We all had to have Jesus. We've all have to have the one innocent one tonight. And it will not be in vain tonight. Whatever you have need of, we'll pray with you. Whatever it is, you lift your hands up. Pray. Pray how you want to pray. Just speak to him for a few minutes. Oh, as they sing a song tonight, you worship him however you feel. [music] is real for I can feel you in my soul. My God.
