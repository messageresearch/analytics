[42:26] amen amen if you will turn the bibles to
[42:29] revelations
[42:34] take a familiar topic tonight and
[42:36] perhaps
[42:38] approach it just a little bit of a
[42:40] different angle
[42:42] revelations three
[42:56] the leader age verse 14 and unto the
[42:59] angel of the church of the laodiceans
[43:02] right these things saith the amen
[43:05] the faithful and true witness beginning
[43:08] of the creation of god
[43:10] i know thy works that thou art neither
[43:12] hot cold nor hot
[43:14] i would that word cold or hot
[43:17] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[43:19] neither cold or hot i will spew the out
[43:22] of
[43:22] my mouth because thou says i am rich and
[43:25] increase with goods and have need of
[43:26] nothing
[43:27] and know us not that thou are wretched
[43:29] and miserable and poor and blind
[43:31] naked i counsel thee to buy of
[43:35] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[43:37] mayest be rich
[43:38] in white raiment that thou mayest be
[43:40] clothed and that the shame of thy
[43:42] nakedness do not appear
[43:44] and anoint the eyes with isaiah of that
[43:45] thou mayest see
[43:47] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[43:50] besel us therefore
[43:52] and repent behold i stand at the door
[43:55] and knock if any man hear my voice
[43:57] and open the door i will come in to him
[43:59] and will sup with him
[44:01] and he with me to him that overcometh
[44:04] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[44:06] even though
[44:07] as i also overcame and am set down
[44:10] in my father's throne he didn't have an
[44:12] ear let him hear
[44:14] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[44:16] may god had his blessings to the reading
[44:18] of the word
[44:19] you can be seated i want to just talk
[44:22] about
[44:23] overcoming tonight overcoming
[44:28] amen and i hadn't really
[44:32] intended to talk too much on some of
[44:34] this but
[44:35] as i was reading it it just kind of
[44:37] caught my attention
[44:39] amen and so um
[44:42] but i want to say first perhaps before
[44:44] we say mention a few things here is
[44:47] you know when i begin to meditate when i
[44:49] begin to think about
[44:51] overcoming it amen
[44:54] my thought went to
[44:58] first john the first chapter
[45:02] in verse 5. it says now this is the
[45:06] message
[45:06] we have heard of him and declare unto
[45:10] you that god is light
[45:11] in him and in him is
[45:14] no darkness at all
[45:18] amen amen and if we say we have
[45:21] fellowship with him
[45:23] and walk in darkness we lie
[45:27] and do not the truth but if we walk in
[45:30] the light
[45:30] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[45:33] one with another and the blood of jesus
[45:35] christ god's son cleanses us from all
[45:38] sin i got to thinking about how that
[45:41] jesus overcame
[45:44] all darkness amen
[45:49] jesus overcame all
[45:52] darkness everything that is
[45:55] of darkness amen such as
[45:58] temptations such as lust such as
[46:01] greed the lust of the eye the lust of
[46:04] the flesh the pride of life
[46:06] right he overcame all of that and
[46:09] it says that in him was no darkness at
[46:12] all
[46:13] so jesus christ displayed perfect light
[46:18] and we know that jesus christ was really
[46:21] the only one that ever could perfectly
[46:26] overcome
[46:29] he never was overcome by evil in any
[46:31] form or fashion
[46:33] that right he overcame perfectly
[46:36] and i'm not gonna go into it too much
[46:39] but i
[46:39] i really like how brother branham when
[46:42] he talked about jesus christ being the
[46:44] mighty conqueror
[46:46] is that right honey believes that jesus
[46:48] truly was the mighty conqueror
[46:50] he truly was the overcomer of all
[46:53] overcomers
[46:55] there was none like him nobody ever did
[46:58] but abraham talked about napoleon and
[47:00] how did he
[47:01] conquered i guess all the known world
[47:03] how he was such a mighty
[47:05] mighty warrior led such a mighty army
[47:10] but finally he came to his demise not
[47:13] only that but from what i understand he
[47:15] died as he drunk
[47:16] that right and so at 33 he dried as a
[47:20] drunk and so forth but
[47:22] then he said you know with jesus christ
[47:24] he overcame everything that there was to
[47:26] overcome
[47:28] and he died at 33 but he didn't die but
[47:31] he also rose again
[47:34] and then but y'all remember brother bam
[47:36] talking about the illustrating how that
[47:38] when he came forth you know on the third
[47:40] day resurrecting and so forth and
[47:42] amen he conquered death hell in the
[47:44] grave he conquered
[47:46] uh went down there and took the keys
[47:48] from the devil and come up you know and
[47:50] brought the old testament saints
[47:52] with him and he talked about going past
[47:55] the moon and the stars and went up to
[47:56] the pearly gates you know and
[47:58] the saints set open up ye everlasting
[48:01] gates
[48:02] let the king of glory come in you know
[48:04] and somebody on the inside
[48:06] shouting who is this king of glory amen
[48:09] he's the king he's mighty in battle amen
[48:13] the king of glory mighty in battle amen
[48:16] he had just
[48:17] did the greatest battle that you could
[48:19] ever have imagined
[48:21] amen i think of the song that says oh
[48:24] behold the mighty conqueror
[48:26] behold him in plain view for he is the
[48:30] mighty
[48:31] conqueror since he read the veil in two
[48:35] amen i think somebody's got to have a
[48:38] revelation to write a song
[48:39] about the mighty conqueror renting the
[48:42] veil
[48:43] in two well now that may seem shallow
[48:46] might
[48:47] sound insignificant or you might say
[48:49] well what in the world does the veil
[48:51] renting into have to do it with it
[48:54] but when you get to think about it you
[48:56] know i mean how many knows that that is
[48:57] what
[48:58] separated man and god
[49:02] amen a man couldn't go back behind that
[49:04] veil you couldn't approach the presence
[49:06] of god before
[49:07] but now since calvary and since the
[49:09] death of christ
[49:11] god rent it so that
[49:14] man could come back to almighty god
[49:18] so it was a really big deal it was a
[49:20] great thing when he
[49:21] the mighty conquer rent the veil in two
[49:24] amen it brought us back into fellowship
[49:26] with almighty god
[49:28] amen tonight i want to talk to you with
[49:29] the help of the lord a little bit we
[49:31] want to talk about
[49:32] amen you know how that we're overcoming
[49:34] darkness
[49:35] and our hearts desire is to be able to
[49:38] say
[49:38] like the scripture talks about jesus
[49:41] that
[49:42] in him wasn't any darkness at
[49:45] all it was all light
[49:49] and that's your heart's desire no doubt
[49:51] my heart desire
[49:52] is to get all the darkness out
[49:56] to overcome all darkness
[50:03] amen because i think if every one of us
[50:06] look at ourselves we still find
[50:08] a little darkness we still find places
[50:11] in our lives where we still need to
[50:13] overcome
[50:15] amen hopefully tonight you know no doubt
[50:18] every one of us sitting here probably
[50:19] don't have to think or search our hearts
[50:21] too long to know
[50:22] what area of our life it is that we need
[50:25] to overcome we might be able to say well
[50:26] i'll overcome that overcome this uh
[50:28] but yet you look at what you still need
[50:30] to overcome
[50:32] i got to thinking of how jesus hunted he
[50:34] conquered
[50:36] every darkness
[50:39] all the works of darkness you overcome
[50:42] it
[50:43] and over in romans i believe it is i
[50:45] want to go to over in romans
[50:47] i just ran across this
[50:51] paul said in the 13th chapter in verse
[50:53] 11 he says you know love or 10
[50:55] love worketh no ill to his neighbor
[50:57] therefore love is the fulfilling of the
[50:58] law
[51:00] and that knowing the time that now it is
[51:03] high time to awake out of the sleep
[51:06] for now is our salvation nearer than
[51:08] when we believed
[51:09] the night is far spent the day is at
[51:13] hand
[51:14] let us therefore cast
[51:17] off the works of darkness
[51:21] amen and let us put on
[51:24] the armor of light
[51:28] amen let us walk honestly as in the day
[51:31] not in writing and in drunkenness not in
[51:34] chamber and in wantingness
[51:36] not in strife and envying
[51:40] somebody knows that's just a few things
[51:43] that paul mentions
[51:45] that we're to overcome
[51:48] amen they were put aside they were put
[51:50] down and then we could go through many
[51:52] things we won't take the time
[51:53] because i want to talk to you about some
[51:56] other aspects
[51:57] but he talks about you know scripture
[51:59] talks about therefore
[52:00] lay aside all lying and let all lay
[52:02] aside this list alright let us put on
[52:04] the new man and take
[52:06] good rid of the old man is that right
[52:08] over in galatians say i believe it is
[52:10] amen and all of that is of course part
[52:12] of that darkness
[52:13] but i want to just start with this amen
[52:17] we're talking about how that we as human
[52:20] beings you know that
[52:21] in him was no darkness at all
[52:25] amen it's all life when we were born how
[52:27] many knows that we were born
[52:29] in darkness we're born in sin
[52:34] amen and we there's so much
[52:38] for us to overcome and i got to thinking
[52:42] of how
[52:43] how that god has allowed we has put us
[52:45] into this
[52:47] and causes us like brother branham says
[52:49] one place it just comes to mind
[52:51] he says you know uh you know if god just
[52:54] takes you and pushes you through
[52:56] something
[52:57] you know it's that's not really
[52:58] overcoming is that right
[53:00] amen and but he has to actually allow to
[53:03] go through it
[53:04] battle with it overcome and that's truly
[53:07] overcoming
[53:09] something that you struggle with
[53:11] something that you have to do
[53:12] battle with amen so we were certainly
[53:16] born
[53:16] amen on a and and i got to thinking
[53:18] about this course because
[53:20] we know that one thing about overcoming
[53:23] now
[53:23] now overcoming the the the very word
[53:27] overcoming
[53:28] the word very word overcome and we of
[53:30] course we know that's to be
[53:31] victorious over something they have the
[53:34] victory of something
[53:35] or uh to get the better of something
[53:39] is that right uh to have it
[53:43] under your feet to where once it was
[53:45] dominating you
[53:46] now here you are dominating it
[53:50] you have become stronger than what that
[53:52] is
[53:53] it is under your feet amen you aren't
[53:56] controlled by that anymore
[53:59] that's truly overcoming
[54:02] amen you know overcoming is something
[54:05] that
[54:07] is so much more than just a word
[54:11] it's kind of like love well yeah we've
[54:13] heard the lord love
[54:15] you know but how many knows that when
[54:17] you have love in your heart
[54:19] it's more to you than just a word it's
[54:22] god
[54:23] it's a presence it's something and it's
[54:25] the same way with overcoming you can
[54:26] talk about overcoming but
[54:28] amen if you are in the state of being
[54:30] heaven overcome that's
[54:31] a whole different story amen so
[54:34] overcoming
[54:36] now and i got to thinking about it
[54:40] you know and i thought well you know
[54:43] god has put us in this what i would call
[54:46] an obstacle course
[54:48] huh haven't we said many times that life
[54:52] uh this is a testing ground
[54:56] this world is a place of testing it's a
[54:59] testing ground
[55:00] and you know i think nowadays they have
[55:02] shows where they put people out in the
[55:04] wilderness
[55:05] drop them off with just the bare
[55:08] essentials and see if they can survive
[55:10] or not
[55:11] huh and that's kind of what we're in i
[55:14] mean we've been put out there
[55:15] we've been given essential tools to be
[55:19] able to survive now if you don't have
[55:22] those essential tools you'll never make
[55:23] it out
[55:24] you'll never make it back home huh
[55:27] but god certainly didn't put us in this
[55:30] without giving us the tools that we need
[55:33] to make it amen
[55:37] i was reading a quote by the brandon
[55:38] back there he was talking about he says
[55:39] you know
[55:40] he says what what riches what what would
[55:43] you ever
[55:44] trade for this for god and for salvation
[55:48] what what treasure is there out there
[55:50] that could ever compare
[55:52] to what we have tonight i mean there's
[55:56] he said there's absolutely nothing out
[55:58] there that compares to what we have
[56:02] amen isn't that saying a big old
[56:03] mouthful that's in a big old mouthful
[56:05] that there's absolutely nothing in the
[56:07] world that even comes close
[56:10] to having god and to have salvation and
[56:12] to know what it's like to be a son of
[56:14] god
[56:15] amen praise the lord nothing to compare
[56:20] amen so in this obstacle course what i
[56:23] would call
[56:23] obstacle course god puts loudest
[56:27] of course to come and to be in this
[56:29] world of darkness and
[56:30] to come into this world unsaved isn't
[56:33] that right
[56:34] to come as a sinner come into this dark
[56:37] world
[56:39] amen and let me just say this
[56:42] that we know that the overcomer
[56:46] now let me just say this while it comes
[56:48] to my mind we realize and i've said it
[56:49] before i want to say it again
[56:51] that we realize that in every church age
[56:55] god always said to him that overcometh
[56:57] will i grant this
[56:59] so there's always a reward for those
[57:02] that overcome
[57:04] and we realize that god is only going to
[57:08] share
[57:09] his throne with overcomers
[57:13] it's the only class of people that he's
[57:16] going to share his throne with
[57:18] his overcomers
[57:21] that's the only kind you have to be an
[57:26] overcomer
[57:28] amen
[57:31] [Music]
[57:35] i'll perhaps pick up on revelations
[57:37] there because
[57:38] as i was reading there uh it begins to
[57:42] tell you
[57:43] the things that you have to overcome
[57:45] didn't it lukewarmness
[57:47] i want you to be hot or cold you know to
[57:51] him it overcometh will i grant to sit
[57:52] with me so
[57:53] you know if you're cold or lukewarm not
[57:56] going to be there
[57:57] only if you're hot if you're going to be
[57:59] there and that right because he said i
[58:00] want you to overcome all that
[58:01] and on down and on down but i want to
[58:04] talk to you about paul
[58:06] because how many knows that paul said uh
[58:09] and let me see here
[58:13] in acts 20 we want to look at
[58:17] life as a
[58:20] obstacle course or a
[58:23] race all right paul looked at it
[58:26] as a race they were running isn't that
[58:29] right
[58:31] and one receives the prize
[58:36] amen there's a prize
[58:40] and as you know in every acts 20 and
[58:43] i'll go to the very
[58:45] scripture here in a minute no matter
[58:48] what it is
[58:53] there's always a prize you know and
[58:56] i don't know i guess it's great i guess
[58:59] it's great to get some kind of a trophy
[59:02] you know they go to the super bowl and
[59:03] they win the super bowl and they got
[59:04] this trophy
[59:06] you know what is it a big piece of metal
[59:07] wonderful all that work for a big piece
[59:09] of metal
[59:10] you know they really worked hard for
[59:12] that but we realized it's probably not
[59:14] so much about the metal as it is about
[59:17] being the top being the best having
[59:20] beat everybody i think that's a whole
[59:22] lot more than the actual prize they get
[59:24] because
[59:24] in my book it's not just too much maybe
[59:28] some ring
[59:28] you know ring on your finger i don't
[59:31] know maybe it's worth
[59:32] more than i think but to me it's just
[59:34] i'm not just to impress
[59:36] but there's always a prize for
[59:38] everything there's a prize isn't that
[59:39] right
[59:40] well the prize for overcoming for us
[59:43] is going to be to sit with him in the
[59:45] throne
[59:46] that's right and uh sometimes you know i
[59:49] don't know which is what what
[59:52] you know i guess in a i don't know where
[59:55] they what kind of
[59:56] perhaps only beauty contests or
[59:58] somewhere like that they would actually
[1:00:00] give you a crown
[1:00:01] that right in some places they actually
[1:00:03] give you a crown well she's
[1:00:04] the queen she's got the crown or
[1:00:06] whatever you know you know but in that
[1:00:08] case maybe the crown but you know
[1:00:10] we're looking for a crown right and our
[1:00:15] our reward for uh being overcomers
[1:00:18] couldn't also be a crown
[1:00:21] and paul paul talking here he was coming
[1:00:24] to the end
[1:00:25] of his life all right and y'all remember
[1:00:29] and i won't go to
[1:00:30] corinthians there where he talks about
[1:00:32] you know
[1:00:33] how the bible talks about how that you
[1:00:35] know you know that how that there's
[1:00:37] many that run in a race but one win is
[1:00:40] the prize you know
[1:00:41] therefore you know i keep under my body
[1:00:43] you know so that i wouldn't be cast away
[1:00:45] and so forth he
[1:00:46] kind of typed with running a race paul
[1:00:48] for some reason had that in his mind
[1:00:51] and so when he came close to coming to
[1:00:53] the end of his life in chapter 20 of
[1:00:55] acts
[1:00:56] he says and now behold i go bound in the
[1:00:59] spirit
[1:01:00] unto jerusalem not knowing the things
[1:01:03] that shall befall me there
[1:01:05] say that the holy spirit witnesses that
[1:01:08] in every city
[1:01:09] saying that bonds and afflictions abide
[1:01:13] me yeah so he realized that he's going
[1:01:16] to be bad when he gets there
[1:01:18] it isn't going to be easy bonds and
[1:01:22] affliction everybody was prophesying
[1:01:24] that you know it's not going to be good
[1:01:26] for you when you go there
[1:01:28] bonds afflictions and so forth but
[1:01:32] paul said but none of these things move
[1:01:35] me
[1:01:36] amen neither count i
[1:01:40] my life dear unto myself so that i might
[1:01:44] finish my course amen
[1:01:48] so he said that it's a course like that
[1:01:50] you're running
[1:01:51] and i'm going to finish this course
[1:01:54] all right with joy and the ministry
[1:01:58] which i have received the lord jesus
[1:02:00] to testify the gospel of the grace of
[1:02:03] god
[1:02:05] now let's go to second timothy he once
[1:02:06] and against mentions this
[1:02:08] in second timothy as he wants to go and
[1:02:11] talks about
[1:02:12] the prize that he's getting and also
[1:02:17] you and i the prize that waits for us to
[1:02:20] finish this course
[1:02:23] to run this race to go through this
[1:02:27] obstacle course to overcome everything
[1:02:30] that we must overcome
[1:02:33] ii timothy 4 and
[1:02:36] verse 5 but watch down in all things
[1:02:42] endure afflictions do the work
[1:02:45] of an evangelist make full proof
[1:02:49] of thy ministry for i am now ready to be
[1:02:52] offered in the time of my departure is
[1:02:54] at hand
[1:02:56] i have fought a good fight
[1:03:00] i have finished the course
[1:03:04] i have finished my course
[1:03:07] i have kept the faith
[1:03:10] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[1:03:14] crown huh
[1:03:17] of righteousness amen
[1:03:21] now how many has heard that you'll
[1:03:23] receive
[1:03:24] a crown of
[1:03:28] huh life
[1:03:33] i mean it's hurting the crown of life
[1:03:35] that's right because i don't know
[1:03:37] for folks that you're actually going to
[1:03:39] have a crown all right
[1:03:41] there's a crown of righteousness and
[1:03:43] then there's the crown
[1:03:45] of life eternal amen
[1:03:49] eternal life is your crown that's what
[1:03:52] he's giving you that is your reward is
[1:03:55] eternal life the crown of life
[1:03:58] praise the lord all right
[1:04:02] a crown of righteousness which the lord
[1:04:04] the righteous
[1:04:05] judge shall give me at that day
[1:04:09] and not to me only but thank you paul i
[1:04:12] sure appreciate that
[1:04:14] huh that he had 100 confidence
[1:04:17] that he's going to finish his course
[1:04:19] he's going to overcome
[1:04:22] he's even overcoming death
[1:04:25] all of that it doesn't matter all right
[1:04:28] and he had confidence that he had
[1:04:29] finished it he had fought the good fight
[1:04:32] amen he had come to the end and that god
[1:04:36] that's a big word how many knows paul
[1:04:38] was pretty confident
[1:04:40] that he was going to receive a crown of
[1:04:42] righteousness
[1:04:44] amen which the lord the righteous
[1:04:48] judge wow shall give me
[1:04:52] at that day and not
[1:04:55] to me only but unto all them also
[1:04:59] that are scared because don't talk about
[1:05:02] the coming of the lord it scares us to
[1:05:04] death
[1:05:05] [Music]
[1:05:06] you reckon that's the group that's going
[1:05:08] to be getting the crown alive
[1:05:09] remember brother brown says brother
[1:05:11] brandon you gotta quit talking about the
[1:05:12] common law that scares people
[1:05:14] they've been like what what what
[1:05:18] scares people no he's in it out in this
[1:05:22] area why because you're looking for
[1:05:24] you're expecting him
[1:05:26] if it scares you there's something wrong
[1:05:28] somewhere in it right
[1:05:30] i dare say tonight but he said
[1:05:33] but unto all them also that
[1:05:37] love his appearing
[1:05:40] amen hallelujah
[1:05:43] praise the lord he's finally coming
[1:05:47] those who love his appearing praise be
[1:05:50] the lord
[1:05:52] so you see folks how that he talks about
[1:05:54] being a a course like
[1:05:57] something that you got to go through
[1:05:59] trials
[1:06:00] tribulation god has never promised us a
[1:06:04] flowery bed of ease
[1:06:06] amen no he certainly hasn't amen
[1:06:10] so i want to begin going down now
[1:06:14] talking about first of all how did we
[1:06:17] were born
[1:06:18] in darkness we were born with lots of
[1:06:22] darkness in us such as
[1:06:23] hate right
[1:06:26] such as emulation emulation wrath
[1:06:30] strife but the main thing the first of
[1:06:33] all the thing that i want to
[1:06:34] mention is that we were born condemned
[1:06:39] or damned is that right
[1:06:43] because those that believe not shall be
[1:06:45] damned
[1:06:46] so we were born in a damn condition it
[1:06:49] born
[1:06:49] born in a in a state of condemnation
[1:06:53] now you know that you cannot have
[1:06:55] confidence
[1:06:57] with condemnation
[1:07:00] because adam after he received that
[1:07:03] condemnation
[1:07:04] he went and hid in the bushes he
[1:07:06] couldn't face god anymore i'm scared
[1:07:09] fear come in so that's part of the
[1:07:13] things that you and i have to overcome
[1:07:15] is
[1:07:15] condemnation
[1:07:19] huh
[1:07:22] where is it over there in saint john i
[1:07:24] believe it is talks about he says
[1:07:27] if a heart condemn us not then we have
[1:07:29] confidence towards god
[1:07:32] you can't have confidence towards god
[1:07:34] you die you're not gonna be a confident
[1:07:36] person under condemnation
[1:07:40] you can't have real confidence under
[1:07:42] condemnation
[1:07:44] so the first thing we got to do is get
[1:07:46] rid of the condemnation
[1:07:49] the damnation the sin
[1:07:52] the guilt how i mean it's all darkness
[1:07:56] it's all things that he made us this
[1:07:58] this obstacle of course that he's given
[1:08:00] us that you got to overcome you're going
[1:08:01] to have to overcome guilt
[1:08:07] and condemnation amen
[1:08:11] and you know people in the old testament
[1:08:14] never could overcome it
[1:08:16] they could never overcome it why because
[1:08:19] jesus hadn't died yet
[1:08:21] the bulls and ghosts that just covered
[1:08:24] their sin it did not change their nature
[1:08:26] at all
[1:08:27] it did not change their desires at all
[1:08:30] they went right back out there
[1:08:34] amen and did the same things again
[1:08:37] because they had you know you one thing
[1:08:39] you can't fight is your nature
[1:08:42] god has to change our nation
[1:08:45] amen oh praise the lord
[1:08:49] [Applause]
[1:08:50] so
[1:08:52] we realize let me see here first god had
[1:08:56] to give us
[1:08:57] a weapon he had to give us something
[1:09:00] that would cause us not to be condemned
[1:09:04] anymore
[1:09:06] amen how many knows that come through
[1:09:08] forgiveness
[1:09:10] through jesus christ amen
[1:09:14] i want to look at
[1:09:18] um first john
[1:09:30] 5. first john 5 and we'll read a few
[1:09:34] scriptures here
[1:09:39] so here's the avenue here's our first
[1:09:41] weapon
[1:09:42] here's our first way of overcoming
[1:09:47] amen
[1:09:50] whosoever believeth that jesus is born
[1:09:53] is the christ
[1:09:55] is born of god
[1:09:58] oh wow you know how many people
[1:10:02] believe or i'm going to say it this way
[1:10:08] you know how many people say they
[1:10:10] believe
[1:10:11] that jesus was the son of god
[1:10:15] and another place to justify this
[1:10:18] brother brahm talk about how did
[1:10:20] no man speaking can't call jesus the
[1:10:22] christ
[1:10:24] but by the holy ghost in other words you
[1:10:27] don't know
[1:10:29] jesus unless you've got him in here
[1:10:33] you just know him by knowledge that's
[1:10:35] not knowing him
[1:10:37] you can't jesus call jesus to christ but
[1:10:39] by the holy ghost
[1:10:40] so whosoever believeth i mean
[1:10:44] truly believeth right truly believe it
[1:10:47] with your heart
[1:10:48] the bible says that you're born of god
[1:10:51] amen and everyone that loveth him
[1:10:54] that begat loveth him also that is
[1:10:56] begotten of him
[1:10:58] okay because paul was talking about
[1:11:00] haunted you can't say you love god and
[1:11:02] hate your brother
[1:11:04] now you're a liar if you say that you
[1:11:06] love god and hate your brother you are
[1:11:08] still
[1:11:09] in darkness and the light isn't in there
[1:11:14] amen how many knows that when you truly
[1:11:18] get
[1:11:18] baptized and have the holy ghost it
[1:11:21] makes you
[1:11:22] love everybody
[1:11:25] makes you love everybody it does does do
[1:11:28] it
[1:11:29] amen i don't care if they take you out
[1:11:31] there and hang you on a tree
[1:11:33] it'll still make you love them and say
[1:11:35] father forgive them
[1:11:37] that's just the spirit of god
[1:11:40] and then listen even and especially the
[1:11:43] household of god
[1:11:45] because he many times said he that talks
[1:11:48] about if he that loveth is
[1:11:49] hateth his brother right those that are
[1:11:52] others that are in christ
[1:11:54] right part of the church of god and you
[1:11:57] hate them
[1:11:58] that are begotten and that's what he was
[1:12:00] saying
[1:12:02] everyone that loveth him that begat or
[1:12:05] is begotten
[1:12:06] also loveth him that is begotten of him
[1:12:08] in other words if god
[1:12:09] saved me in that right you're gonna it's
[1:12:12] gonna cause you to love those that are
[1:12:14] begotten also of god
[1:12:18] by this we know that we love the
[1:12:20] children of god when we love god
[1:12:22] and keep his commandments for this is
[1:12:24] the love of god that we keep his
[1:12:25] commandments and his commandments are
[1:12:27] not
[1:12:27] grievous for whatsoever is born of god
[1:12:30] whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[1:12:34] the world and this is the victory that
[1:12:38] overcometh the world even our
[1:12:41] faith now who is he that overcometh
[1:12:45] the world but he that believeth that
[1:12:48] jesus is
[1:12:49] the son of god so how many knows there
[1:12:52] is absolutely no way in the world
[1:12:55] no buddha no hindu no no nobody out
[1:12:59] there there is
[1:13:00] nothing out there huh
[1:13:03] nowhere on the internet tonight if
[1:13:04] anybody was a listen listen you're going
[1:13:06] to hear it
[1:13:06] that there is absolutely no salvation in
[1:13:09] any other name
[1:13:10] there is no uh how does that say it now
[1:13:16] there is no name given under heaven
[1:13:19] whereby there is not another there we go
[1:13:21] acts
[1:13:21] there is not another name given under
[1:13:24] heaven whereby
[1:13:25] you must be saved you can try it
[1:13:29] you can try every other one that you can
[1:13:32] but it'll never happen
[1:13:35] jesus says i am the way to truth in the
[1:13:37] life and no man comes to the father
[1:13:40] but by me the only way you'll ever
[1:13:44] overcome is through jesus christ
[1:13:48] not by joining church not by turning a
[1:13:50] new page not by anything else
[1:13:52] only through christ are you ever going
[1:13:55] to overcome
[1:13:56] anything amen tommy is glad for that
[1:14:01] only by being in christ only it's the
[1:14:03] only hope that you have is jesus christ
[1:14:06] amen let's talk for a minute
[1:14:10] about overcoming genetics
[1:14:13] all right overcoming
[1:14:17] is a genetics thing right
[1:14:21] it's a genetic thing
[1:14:24] and i thought about a story and i think
[1:14:26] i remember brother brad one of his
[1:14:28] first messages that i remember him
[1:14:31] preaching about
[1:14:32] was something about a horse and racing
[1:14:36] a long time ago i remember i don't know
[1:14:37] just whatever he said but i know what it
[1:14:39] probably had to do a little bit about
[1:14:41] genetics but
[1:14:44] i thought about just making my own story
[1:14:47] up tonight
[1:14:48] and that is let's just take there's a
[1:14:50] horse
[1:14:52] person that loves horses and
[1:14:55] he loves racing horses but all he's got
[1:14:58] is a bunch of poor quality horses that
[1:15:00] won't bring but about
[1:15:02] two thousand dollars three thousand
[1:15:04] dollars you know and
[1:15:06] one time one time you know it happens to
[1:15:08] be that one of these horses
[1:15:11] he knows when it's born it's special i
[1:15:14] mean this
[1:15:15] horse is extra big but yet it's sleek
[1:15:19] and when it runs it goes like lightning
[1:15:22] and he trains and he works on this horse
[1:15:25] like he wouldn't believe
[1:15:27] all right and somebody comes and perhaps
[1:15:31] wants to buy a horse and say i'll give
[1:15:32] you 3
[1:15:33] 000 for that horse no i'm about to take
[1:15:35] him to the kentucky derby and try him
[1:15:37] out and
[1:15:38] he goes to kentucky derby he can't try
[1:15:39] it out he makes it try outs or whatever
[1:15:41] sure enough and this horse
[1:15:45] in the real race blows everybody else
[1:15:49] away
[1:15:50] all right and that horse goes from a
[1:15:52] worth of about
[1:15:53] three thousand dollars four thousand
[1:15:55] dollars to about two million dollars
[1:15:58] how many knows after the win it jumps
[1:16:03] majorly right
[1:16:06] they offer him a million dollars
[1:16:10] two million whatever no he goes back
[1:16:12] home
[1:16:13] takes the same stallion same bear breeds
[1:16:16] more
[1:16:17] uses that one and breeds more and that
[1:16:19] right
[1:16:20] and now not no more his horse is worth
[1:16:24] about two or three that people come and
[1:16:25] offer him
[1:16:26] just for the babies i'll give you half a
[1:16:28] million
[1:16:30] why because they know that he's going to
[1:16:32] make millions they want the genetics of
[1:16:34] that horse
[1:16:36] because that's what really makes the
[1:16:39] difference is because
[1:16:40] that horse beat everybody he was fasting
[1:16:43] and then they went to genetics
[1:16:46] all right muhammad beefs that's the way
[1:16:49] it is with you and i you and i
[1:16:52] were so to speak as brother branham
[1:16:55] would have put it
[1:16:56] when we were in the world when we were
[1:16:58] born in sin it says we were
[1:17:00] dead in sins and trespasses
[1:17:03] not fit for a 25-cent bullet it would
[1:17:06] take to shoot us
[1:17:13] well isn't that what the public of god
[1:17:14] said some people are
[1:17:17] didn't he some folks they're so low they
[1:17:20] fit the clean bullet would take to shoot
[1:17:22] him with
[1:17:25] that's pretty low but
[1:17:28] you take that person and get them
[1:17:30] salvation that right
[1:17:32] you get them salvation you connect them
[1:17:35] with god and all of a sudden they become
[1:17:37] a son
[1:17:38] or a daughter of god and now they're
[1:17:41] worth
[1:17:41] ten thousand worlds
[1:17:44] what makes the difference the difference
[1:17:47] is that you truly weren't
[1:17:49] fit to live not fit to kill
[1:17:53] is that right going to hell gonna be
[1:17:55] destroyed no good whatsoever
[1:17:58] but now that you're a part of god
[1:18:01] you become worth ten thousand worlds
[1:18:04] that's the way that it's a believer
[1:18:07] because why because there's something
[1:18:10] that's
[1:18:10] in him now i want to tell you something
[1:18:15] i truly believe this that if you are
[1:18:18] ever
[1:18:19] going to be an overcomer it'll have to
[1:18:21] be
[1:18:22] in your genetics
[1:18:26] not your genetics of biler huh
[1:18:30] but in your genetics of where you truly
[1:18:32] come from
[1:18:33] i mean knows that but about that we are
[1:18:35] a seed gene
[1:18:37] of almighty god for you to ever be with
[1:18:40] god or to be a part of god
[1:18:42] you had to be with god or in god before
[1:18:44] the first stardust was ever created
[1:18:46] god had to think of you you had to be a
[1:18:49] part of god
[1:18:51] isn't that right and when the inner
[1:18:54] genetics pulls out when when that comes
[1:18:57] because that woman at the well she then
[1:18:59] had five husbands
[1:19:02] now we know that brother brown says that
[1:19:04] if a woman goes out and marries another
[1:19:06] man after being divorced you know right
[1:19:08] she forfeits her rights to heaven i
[1:19:11] don't understand it all but he said five
[1:19:13] times you've had five husbands
[1:19:15] huh and here what happened
[1:19:19] but abram said there was a gene seed
[1:19:21] down the inside
[1:19:23] there was a gene seed down on the inside
[1:19:25] and she recognized the word of god and
[1:19:27] it come forth
[1:19:28] and she was not just a low-life
[1:19:30] prostitute anymore
[1:19:32] she was a daughter of god that you're
[1:19:33] going to get to see when you get over
[1:19:35] there i believe
[1:19:36] huh worth ten thousand worlds
[1:19:40] but it had to be in there to begin with
[1:19:44] can i give you a scripture i'll give you
[1:19:47] a scripture
[1:19:50] confirmation because everything has to
[1:19:52] be backed up by scripture
[1:19:54] how many believes that i'm going to go
[1:19:56] all the way
[1:19:57] to genesis all the way to genesis
[1:20:00] to prove that overcoming comes
[1:20:05] by genetics spiritual
[1:20:08] genetics
[1:20:12] genesis 22 and verse 15 and the angel of
[1:20:14] the lord called unto abraham out of
[1:20:16] heaven the second time
[1:20:18] and said i myself
[1:20:21] have i sworn saith the lord
[1:20:24] for because the thou has done this thing
[1:20:27] remember how he
[1:20:28] was fixing to kill his son and he was
[1:20:31] going to kill him even though he didn't
[1:20:32] understand why but he just had faith god
[1:20:35] said it didn't do it
[1:20:36] because of what he did the lord said
[1:20:39] because god has done this thing and has
[1:20:40] not withheld thy son thy only son
[1:20:43] that in blessing i will bless thee
[1:20:47] amen and in multiplying i will multiply
[1:20:52] thy seed as the stars of heaven
[1:20:55] and as the sand which is by the seashore
[1:20:58] and thy seed
[1:21:02] shall possess the gates of the enemy
[1:21:07] brother branham came back and he says
[1:21:09] every son that is
[1:21:10] born of god every seed of abraham
[1:21:14] that is your promise that you're
[1:21:17] going to be a winner
[1:21:20] you are going to be an overcomer
[1:21:27] most people give up i mean oh job was
[1:21:30] one of them
[1:21:31] and he got down way low until his
[1:21:35] wife just thought man you are so
[1:21:37] miserable
[1:21:38] i don't want to see you so miserable
[1:21:40] just curse god
[1:21:42] and die and get it over with
[1:21:45] his own wife
[1:21:48] yeah he was so miserable she didn't want
[1:21:50] to see him suffer like that
[1:21:52] he said thou speak is like a foolish
[1:21:55] woman
[1:21:56] what was that that was that tea down on
[1:21:59] the inside
[1:22:00] is that right brother branham after god
[1:22:03] took his wife
[1:22:04] after god took his child for him
[1:22:05] disobeying
[1:22:07] he was down there at the hospital god
[1:22:09] put a black sheep in front of him
[1:22:11] wouldn't hear his prayer
[1:22:12] absolutely blocked him off
[1:22:15] huh give him the cold shoulder and the
[1:22:18] devil tried to tell you he don't love
[1:22:20] you
[1:22:21] that's what he tried to tell me there's
[1:22:22] a god but he don't love you
[1:22:24] hear you just asking please not my
[1:22:27] shared rose
[1:22:29] not my little baby
[1:22:33] ripping his heart out and god just
[1:22:36] put a black seat and refuse it
[1:22:39] and the devil came to him tried to tell
[1:22:42] him see he don't love you
[1:22:43] [Music]
[1:22:45] you know and he said he was just about
[1:22:46] to say if that's how that's god's going
[1:22:49] to be
[1:22:52] that's how god's gonna be huh
[1:22:56] he's just about and he says you know
[1:23:00] the genetics kicked in and they're right
[1:23:04] and he says the lord gave him to me
[1:23:07] the lord has taken away blessed be the
[1:23:10] name of the lord
[1:23:12] did you know sometimes that is exactly
[1:23:15] that's
[1:23:15] actually brother bannon worship the lord
[1:23:18] the brother branham was worshiping the
[1:23:19] lord right there
[1:23:22] because if you go back and read job it
[1:23:24] says and
[1:23:25] job worshipped the lord saying
[1:23:28] the lord has taken the lord is
[1:23:32] given and the lord is taken away blessed
[1:23:34] be the name of the lord that's how you
[1:23:36] worship the lord
[1:23:37] by giving god the glory anyway amen
[1:23:41] how many believes that's the way it is
[1:23:43] with every son and daughter of god
[1:23:45] when you come down to that place huh
[1:23:48] didn't brother braham say every son of
[1:23:50] god comes to that place
[1:23:52] and i believe he was territed well or
[1:23:54] one of them wrote the songs and he talks
[1:23:56] about how that every son comes down to
[1:23:57] that place
[1:23:59] amen we all come to that place god
[1:24:00] brings us all to that place
[1:24:02] in our christian walk sometime
[1:24:06] during our christian walk he brings us
[1:24:08] all the way
[1:24:11] to the bottom
[1:24:14] to find out what we're made of to see
[1:24:16] whether we're overcomer
[1:24:18] or whether we'll walk away whether we're
[1:24:21] one of god's children or whether we're
[1:24:22] really not
[1:24:24] so i say this evening i believe that it
[1:24:27] has to be
[1:24:28] in our genetics to overcome
[1:24:32] it has to be god because listen how many
[1:24:34] knows
[1:24:35] he talks about that seed and and
[1:24:37] galatians talks about who
[1:24:39] who a child of abraham is amen
[1:24:42] now we are all children of abraham by
[1:24:45] having the faith that abraham
[1:24:47] had how many believes you got the same
[1:24:49] faith abraham had
[1:24:50] we got the same faith that abraham had
[1:24:54] amen did i ever finish that
[1:24:58] i don't think i finished that
[1:25:07] i may have but we're going to read it
[1:25:08] again
[1:25:10] first john 5
[1:25:13] yeah we read it again listen
[1:25:17] whatsoever is born of god verse 4
[1:25:21] overcometh the world amen
[1:25:25] so that's another absolute scripture
[1:25:28] that tells you that
[1:25:29] if you're born of god you're going to
[1:25:31] overcome the world
[1:25:32] the only way you're going to overcome
[1:25:33] the world is if you're born of god
[1:25:36] for whatever is born of god overcometh
[1:25:38] the world and this is the victory
[1:25:41] that overcomes the world even
[1:25:44] our faith amen
[1:25:49] amen we were telling elena and emeline
[1:25:52] yesterday was it this morning
[1:25:54] we were having devotions we were reading
[1:25:56] and we're talking about the wisdom of
[1:25:58] god and
[1:25:59] you know what the true wisdom is how did
[1:26:02] solomon talk about wisdom and so forth
[1:26:04] and then we talked about how the talmud
[1:26:06] says you know the fear of the lord
[1:26:08] is the beginning of wisdom
[1:26:11] because when solomon talked about wisdom
[1:26:13] he talked about it'll deck you with gold
[1:26:15] it'll do this it'll do that
[1:26:16] wisdom if you're just smart man it'll
[1:26:18] get you a long way
[1:26:20] you you're right and over generally
[1:26:22] speaking knowledge and wisdom
[1:26:25] truly gets you a long way but at the end
[1:26:28] of it all he says you know the
[1:26:29] fear of the lord is the beginning of the
[1:26:31] wisdom because
[1:26:32] if you don't fear god you really don't
[1:26:35] have
[1:26:36] any kind of a foundation for your life
[1:26:39] there's really no foundation if people
[1:26:41] don't believe in god
[1:26:42] why do you think people are just going
[1:26:45] there
[1:26:47] they're like a piece of cloth that is
[1:26:50] unfolding just falling all to pieces
[1:26:53] societies falling to pieces people
[1:26:56] painting their face and
[1:26:57] doing all kinds of crazy things they all
[1:27:00] falling apart because they have no
[1:27:02] foundation
[1:27:04] because they don't have any faith in god
[1:27:07] truly how many truly can say like the
[1:27:09] bible says
[1:27:10] our victory is our faith our faith is
[1:27:14] our victory
[1:27:15] because having faith in god it's what
[1:27:17] begins to help you
[1:27:18] it's what causes you to be able to come
[1:27:21] is to believe on the lord jesus christ
[1:27:25] oh how simple if the world could just
[1:27:27] realize that that's your answer
[1:27:30] amen isn't that something anybody ask
[1:27:34] any question hey i've got a problem i've
[1:27:36] got a problem i got a problem
[1:27:38] hey guess what christ is the answer
[1:27:42] amen and we certainly were born with
[1:27:45] problems
[1:27:47] god allowed us in this obstacle course
[1:27:50] to have
[1:27:50] problems i mean any obstacle course
[1:27:54] that's supposed to be hard to do people
[1:27:55] can't do it this that or the other
[1:27:57] i mean those they'll make these obstacle
[1:27:59] course where you got to walk on a little
[1:28:01] board
[1:28:01] you got to jump on one balloon to the
[1:28:03] other and the other
[1:28:04] and you've got to do all this stuff you
[1:28:06] got to go to be a sanity saturday
[1:28:08] well that's about what life's all about
[1:28:09] man you got to do all kinds of stuff
[1:28:11] to try to make it through folks you
[1:28:14] gotta
[1:28:15] you gotta deal with betrayal you gotta
[1:28:16] deal with depression you gotta
[1:28:18] deal with hate and fear and all kinds of
[1:28:21] things that you gotta deal with
[1:28:24] all kinds of hard things that you gotta
[1:28:26] deal with
[1:28:28] amen one of the first things you've got
[1:28:31] to go through and that is to get rid of
[1:28:33] condemnation and guilt through jesus
[1:28:35] christ i may believe that he's willing
[1:28:37] to forgive us of our sins
[1:28:39] he is faithful and just to forgive us of
[1:28:41] our sins if we ask for it
[1:28:44] he's more willing to forgive us of our
[1:28:46] sins than we
[1:28:47] are willing to forgive each other
[1:28:49] because i guarantee you any one of us
[1:28:51] would have a hard time
[1:28:52] forgiving each other 490 times in a day
[1:28:57] we'd have a hard time with that we have
[1:28:59] a problem with that
[1:29:01] but yet that's what jesus said a person
[1:29:04] comes and genuinely pray repent
[1:29:07] guess how many times we're supposed to
[1:29:08] forgive each other
[1:29:10] amen and so god is very gracious he
[1:29:12] takes that away
[1:29:14] so now notice instead of condemnation
[1:29:16] amen light comes into our soul
[1:29:19] and we begin to have confidence
[1:29:22] it begins to give us structure amen
[1:29:27] and because of this condemnation that we
[1:29:29] have
[1:29:30] sorrow and fear also came in isn't that
[1:29:34] right
[1:29:36] you know people you might say well all
[1:29:37] right tell you what brother i don't have
[1:29:39] any darkness
[1:29:40] i'm full of light i have i'm i'm a
[1:29:42] complete overcomer and you're still
[1:29:45] complete sorrow and in fear
[1:29:48] huh the bible says that perfect love
[1:29:51] casts
[1:29:52] out fear
[1:29:56] huh i mean sometimes we get through
[1:29:58] anxiety
[1:29:59] overcome anxiety anxiety nervousness and
[1:30:03] all kinds of things that can come upon
[1:30:04] us
[1:30:06] only jesus christ can take you through
[1:30:08] that
[1:30:09] only christ can help you through these
[1:30:12] things
[1:30:16] i'm going to mention my brother-in-law
[1:30:17] david
[1:30:19] you know he always thought about these
[1:30:20] people that get all nervous and have
[1:30:21] these nerve problems you know they're
[1:30:23] just a little bit there's something
[1:30:24] wrong with him
[1:30:26] david was a tough guy he's one of us
[1:30:27] old-timers i believe you got to be tough
[1:30:31] you know you got to be tough work hard
[1:30:37] you know but come to find out later in
[1:30:40] his life he got so nervous
[1:30:42] he was struggling with nerve so bad he
[1:30:44] was making deals walking up and down the
[1:30:46] road couldn't hardly function
[1:30:49] maybe you say lord jesus don't you ever
[1:30:52] let me not have compassion for somebody
[1:30:55] that's going through
[1:30:56] a nervous spell or something like that
[1:30:58] he said that stuff's real
[1:31:01] nothing to play with don't let me not
[1:31:03] have compassion for people
[1:31:05] spirits that get on people things that
[1:31:07] cause people to get that way
[1:31:09] isn't that right but yet
[1:31:12] your only hope sometimes is to overcome
[1:31:15] fear
[1:31:16] sorrow disappointment how many knows
[1:31:19] that in life
[1:31:20] you're gonna face disappointing things
[1:31:23] very disappointing things things that
[1:31:26] can absolutely
[1:31:28] deflate you amen
[1:31:31] feel like there is no hope
[1:31:34] because how many knows the opposite of
[1:31:36] disappointment so forth is hope
[1:31:39] that's right discouragement
[1:31:43] but we're filled with hope instead
[1:31:46] brother bam said you know this world is
[1:31:48] full of dissatisfied
[1:31:51] people the hospitals are full of this
[1:31:55] side
[1:31:55] there's so many people that are
[1:31:58] dissatisfied
[1:32:00] people are not happy
[1:32:03] huh but if you've overcome that
[1:32:07] then what are you
[1:32:11] i'm satisfied
[1:32:14] with just a cottage pillow a little
[1:32:17] silver
[1:32:18] into little gold how many is happy
[1:32:23] no matter what you have be happy
[1:32:26] i mean look if you know am i people are
[1:32:28] not happy
[1:32:29] how many believes that that's something
[1:32:30] we need to overcome
[1:32:33] our droopy faces we need to overcome our
[1:32:36] droopy faces what is it preachers tell
[1:32:38] us all the time well if you have so much
[1:32:41] joy
[1:32:42] how about notifying my face
[1:32:48] that's right it just comes from the
[1:32:49] inside out you know right
[1:32:52] i mean needs more joy right more peace
[1:32:56] more satisfaction folks
[1:32:59] it's easy to deal with somebody that's
[1:33:01] satisfied
[1:33:04] it's hard to deal somebody it's not
[1:33:06] satisfied
[1:33:11] amen
[1:33:16] overcome bitterness and hatred
[1:33:21] how many knows it's easy to be bitter
[1:33:24] poor bitterness wants to grab you
[1:33:26] if you've been done wrong it's so easy
[1:33:29] to let bitterness
[1:33:31] get in your heart and from bitterness
[1:33:34] spawns
[1:33:35] the evil spirits of hatred and from the
[1:33:39] evil spirits of hatred spawns
[1:33:43] the wicked spirit of murder
[1:33:47] that's right remember it just started
[1:33:50] out with jealousy with cain
[1:33:52] and it ended up with murder
[1:33:55] all right how many please it's all
[1:33:59] things we have to overcome
[1:34:03] in this obstacle course overcoming
[1:34:06] because only those are overcomers will
[1:34:09] grant to sit with me
[1:34:11] or do you reckon you're going to sit by
[1:34:12] jesus there and say brother i'll tell
[1:34:14] you what
[1:34:15] but i hate that guy over there you let's
[1:34:17] get into heaven
[1:34:20] i really don't like that other person
[1:34:22] over there you let come on that no he's
[1:34:23] not gonna have around people that are
[1:34:25] bitter
[1:34:26] amen no
[1:34:32] so guess what we have to overcome
[1:34:33] bitterness because of issues
[1:34:35] things that we face a lot of times it's
[1:34:39] people huh
[1:34:42] how we're different we're different
[1:34:45] sometimes
[1:34:46] just because of that don't get me
[1:34:48] started
[1:34:50] i was talking to jonathan at uh
[1:34:54] golden rule was just witnessing a little
[1:34:56] bit
[1:34:58] and we was talking about how that i told
[1:35:01] him i said you know
[1:35:03] people's dissatisfied and it's people
[1:35:05] never want to give a
[1:35:06] take account for their self but the
[1:35:09] hardest thing
[1:35:10] the hardest thing i told him for me and
[1:35:13] i'm sure it's for you
[1:35:15] it's to actually see your own fault it's
[1:35:18] so easy
[1:35:19] to see everybody else's fault but so
[1:35:22] many times we don't see our own fault
[1:35:24] i don't know about you but my hands are
[1:35:26] up i have to say lord
[1:35:29] show me where i'm too loud mouth show me
[1:35:32] where i'm
[1:35:32] too unconscious un inconsiderate
[1:35:35] i'm too rude show me where
[1:35:39] you know and galore begin to show you
[1:35:40] hey you know you're a pretty rough cut
[1:35:42] guy you need to have a little bit more
[1:35:43] gentleness about you
[1:35:45] when you preach and tear people up make
[1:35:47] sure you do it in love
[1:35:49] not out of anger or whatever you know
[1:35:52] and just
[1:35:53] all kinds of things he'll show you about
[1:35:56] yourself if you'll
[1:35:57] take notice otherwise i'm right and
[1:36:00] you're wrong that's just how it is
[1:36:02] that's total blindness to your own fault
[1:36:05] that's how you think when you're totally
[1:36:06] blind
[1:36:07] it ain't never your fault it's always
[1:36:11] somebody else's fault
[1:36:13] amen but the holy spirit will say
[1:36:16] well maybe he reacted that way because
[1:36:19] of what i did
[1:36:20] wow what a revelation
[1:36:24] what a good thought now you're ready to
[1:36:27] get somewhere
[1:36:28] amen praise the lord let me
[1:36:32] just jump right to the end would that be
[1:36:34] all right
[1:36:37] with two more thoughts and all right
[1:36:41] one of them is overcoming as a church
[1:36:45] all right how many of those that we'll
[1:36:47] just put it in there where
[1:36:49] where it says i would that that were
[1:36:50] cold or hot isn't that right
[1:36:52] brother bam says sometimes you go into
[1:36:54] churches and it feels like it's
[1:36:56] 20 below zero
[1:36:59] that's cold because i don't know about
[1:37:00] you but this morning 22 was gold
[1:37:03] 20 below zero
[1:37:07] how many knows when you get into the
[1:37:08] house of god you like to feel a little
[1:37:11] warmth
[1:37:12] and what is that warmth that one that
[1:37:15] warmth is
[1:37:16] amen when you go after service and you
[1:37:19] shake people's hands and you're friendly
[1:37:22] or you just ignore everybody and go on a
[1:37:24] street be
[1:37:25] lying right out to your car you ain't
[1:37:27] talking to nobody
[1:37:29] that's not real warm right there right
[1:37:34] you come in here it can be in the way
[1:37:36] that the people saying
[1:37:38] huh it's in the people's attitude
[1:37:42] it's in the holy spirit am i right
[1:37:46] the holy spirit you can sense it you can
[1:37:49] feel it
[1:37:51] amen you can hear it in the amens
[1:37:55] you can hear it in the hallelujah that's
[1:37:57] right you can see it in the smiles
[1:38:01] the warmth we have to overcome
[1:38:06] lukewarmness as a church
[1:38:09] we have to overcome things that will
[1:38:11] drag you down
[1:38:13] that'll cause the spirit not to really
[1:38:14] freely move
[1:38:16] amen and then the last one
[1:38:20] is going to be a pretty good one are you
[1:38:22] ready for this
[1:38:23] we're going to bring in politics for
[1:38:25] just a second
[1:38:29] have you ever heard people make this
[1:38:31] mark something about when they go low
[1:38:33] we go high have you ever heard that
[1:38:37] how many heard that one one person
[1:38:42] boy congratulations y'all don't look at
[1:38:43] the news very much do you
[1:38:45] you probably better off for it but some
[1:38:48] politicians they're talking about well
[1:38:50] when they go and they just talk trash
[1:38:52] about somebody not knock some people
[1:38:54] down and stuff
[1:38:54] we're gonna go high you know we're gonna
[1:38:56] be above all that
[1:39:01] yeah that's right out there i ain't seen
[1:39:04] a lot of going high folks
[1:39:07] i ain't seen no going high but nobody
[1:39:10] that's not picking any kind of party but
[1:39:12] there ain't nobody out there i know of
[1:39:14] lately that has gone high
[1:39:16] now they've all gone low they haven't
[1:39:19] overcome
[1:39:20] they haven't been better than the other
[1:39:22] person and this is found in romans let
[1:39:25] me preach to the world for a minute
[1:39:26] let's go to
[1:39:27] romans let's talk about going high
[1:39:36] what does going high mean well it means
[1:39:38] overcoming
[1:39:39] going low that's what it means
[1:39:43] all right it's all about overcoming
[1:39:49] and perhaps doing the opposite of what
[1:39:51] the other person is doing
[1:39:53] right do the opposite of what the other
[1:39:55] person is here
[1:39:57] should we uh let's go to the punch line
[1:40:01] first
[1:40:02] so that we will know what we're talking
[1:40:04] about read romans 12
[1:40:06] and 21 with me
[1:40:09] be not overcome
[1:40:13] of evil but overcome
[1:40:16] evil with good
[1:40:20] that's what it's supposed to mean about
[1:40:22] going high
[1:40:26] and they all ought to practice it be a
[1:40:28] better world
[1:40:30] amen so let's find out what this
[1:40:34] not being overcome by evil but
[1:40:35] overcoming evil is going high
[1:40:38] all right let's start with uh
[1:40:43] verse 16. start somewhere be of the same
[1:40:47] mind one towards another mind not high
[1:40:49] things but condescend
[1:40:51] to men of lowest they be not wise in
[1:40:54] your own conceits
[1:40:55] now recompense no man
[1:40:58] evil for evil huh
[1:41:02] they say something bad about you what
[1:41:04] are you supposed to do
[1:41:06] say something good about them
[1:41:09] whoo what the world that would be huh
[1:41:14] provide things honest in the sight of
[1:41:16] all men
[1:41:17] if it be possible as much as life in you
[1:41:20] live peaceably with all amen
[1:41:25] dearly beloved avenge not yourselves
[1:41:29] well i'll get that person amen
[1:41:32] but rather give place unto wrath for it
[1:41:35] is written vengeance
[1:41:37] is mine i will repay
[1:41:40] saith the lord therefore if the
[1:41:43] enemy hunger feed him
[1:41:47] i may believe this is truly overcoming
[1:41:52] somebody smacks you on the jeep jesus
[1:41:53] said turn the other one also
[1:41:57] huh what is that that's overcoming
[1:42:01] evil don't be
[1:42:05] uh overcome by evil but overcome evil
[1:42:09] with doing good
[1:42:12] when your enemy hungers feed him when he
[1:42:15] thirsts
[1:42:16] give him drink for in doing so thou
[1:42:19] shalt heap coals of fire
[1:42:21] upon his head be not overcome by evil
[1:42:24] but overcome
[1:42:26] evil with good
[1:42:30] amen praise the lord
[1:42:35] god bless you
[1:42:40] in closing stand with me musicians will
[1:42:42] come i want to read you
[1:42:44] one more scripture as you're doing that
[1:42:48] and i want to talk to you about the
[1:42:50] final
[1:42:51] enemy that we're going to overcome how
[1:42:54] many believes that
[1:42:56] there is perhaps the greatest
[1:42:59] fight the greatest battle
[1:43:06] is still ahead of all of us
[1:43:11] and that is facing death itself
[1:43:15] how many believes that when you come
[1:43:16] down to the door of death it's going to
[1:43:18] be a big battle
[1:43:20] of whether you overcome that
[1:43:25] i remember brother joe hendrickson
[1:43:29] i remember him on his deathbed being
[1:43:32] there
[1:43:33] and sometimes he said he says brother
[1:43:35] byler
[1:43:37] fear wants to grip me
[1:43:40] he wants to be scared of what lays ahead
[1:43:44] but he says he just commits it to the
[1:43:46] lord no
[1:43:47] he don't have to be afraid why he knew
[1:43:51] where he was going he was ready to go he
[1:43:53] had to overcome
[1:43:55] even the fear of death itself
[1:44:00] paul said in first corinthians
[1:44:03] 15 and verse 54
[1:44:07] so when this corruptable shall have put
[1:44:09] on incorruption and this mortal shall
[1:44:11] have put on immortality
[1:44:13] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:44:16] that is written
[1:44:17] death is swallowed up
[1:44:20] in victory oh death paul says
[1:44:24] where is thy sting oh grave
[1:44:28] where is your victory how many believes
[1:44:32] that
[1:44:32] the for the longest time everybody that
[1:44:35] would come down to that door of death
[1:44:37] had to be scared they were
[1:44:38] they were fearful it was a scary thing
[1:44:42] but not so with paul not so with eva's
[1:44:44] fault for us not so with many many
[1:44:46] people
[1:44:47] and even brother braham said after
[1:44:48] seeing the other side he's no more
[1:44:50] scared of death
[1:44:51] than nothing is that right
[1:44:54] why because calvary jesus christ took
[1:44:57] this thing
[1:44:58] of death out and even paul
[1:45:02] said o grave where is your victory
[1:45:06] how many believes death and the grave
[1:45:08] has been robbed of its victory
[1:45:11] that's right we have the victory now the
[1:45:14] sting of death is sin and the strength
[1:45:16] of sin is the law but thanks be to god
[1:45:18] which giveth
[1:45:19] us the victory through our lord jesus
[1:45:22] christ
[1:45:24] therefore my beloved brethren listen
[1:45:27] everybody
[1:45:28] be steadfast unbelievable
[1:45:35] always abounding in the work of the lord
[1:45:38] for as much as you know that your labor
[1:45:42] is not in vain we're not doing this
[1:45:46] folks
[1:45:46] for nothing amen with our heads bowed
[1:45:50] eyes closed how many in here would say
[1:45:53] brother byler
[1:45:54] i still believe that i have some
[1:45:56] darkness that i want to see out of my
[1:45:58] life
[1:45:58] i need more victories in my life
[1:46:02] think of that obstacle that's in front
[1:46:04] of you think of whatever it is that you
[1:46:06] want to overcome
[1:46:07] raise your hand to the lord jesus christ
[1:46:09] and say lord you know what i'm thinking
[1:46:11] you know what i have need of and you
