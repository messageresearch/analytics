[50:15] appreciative Lord of your word where it

[50:20] have need of before we even ask but so
[50:24] we know that you are watching ing over

[50:45] we'll go into uh The Book of
[50:48] Matthew The Book of
[50:54] Matthew
[50:57] I'm going to have to get a different
[50:59] book believe it or not I'm been doing
[51:01] this 30 years and I think I'm getting it
[51:03] down a little bit better on how to write
[51:06] my notes down a little bit and even this
[51:08] book I just I you know I always saved
[51:10] all those yellow papers you know save

[51:16] just there they all are you see not that
[51:19] I use him again
[51:21] amen uh but anyway so now I figured out
[51:26] that I need one that has a has one that
[51:29] pops open so I'll you'll probably see me
[51:31] here one that pops open because I'll
[51:34] I'll go about two pages or so and that
[51:37] maybe three pages and I'm like no
[51:38] there's something else that I want to

[52:03] 7 Matthew 7 and like I said I have a lot
[52:06] of scriptures I want to read so amen we
[52:08] want to uh expound a little bit more on
[52:12] the Rock would that be okay uh perhaps
[52:16] before we even expound on that we want
[52:17] to go back a little further amen and we
[52:20] want to talk about a little bit more
[52:21] about what it means Amen to have uh an
[52:25] experience on the back side of the
[52:26] desert we're still not done with the
[52:28] back side of the desert Believe It or
[52:30] Not amen so we want to we want to pick
[52:33] up just a few thoughts there because

[53:04] therefore whosoever heareth these
[53:07] sayings of mine and doeth them I will
[53:09] liken him unto a wise man which built
[53:11] his house upon a Rock Amen the rains
[53:15] descended and the floods came and the
[53:17] winds blew and beat upon that house amen
[53:21] and it fell not for it was founded upon
[53:23] a Rock Amen now how many know knows am
[53:26] mean what the real rock is the rock of
[53:28] Revelation is that right amen that's the
[53:30] only rock that you can be built on that
[53:32] am mean all the Prevail against it no
[53:36] matter how many winds come is that right
[53:39] no matter how many floods come amen
[53:43] praise the Lord the the rock this that
[53:44] house will stand and everyone that
[53:47] heareth these sayings of mine and doeth
[53:49] them not shall be likened unto a foolish
[53:51] man which built his house upon the sand
[53:53] the rains descended in the floods came
[53:55] the winds blew and beat upon the house
[53:57] and it fell and great was the fall of it
[54:00] may God add His blessings to the reading
[54:01] of the word you can SE
[54:04] it praise the Lord so this evening we
[54:07] want to speak with the help of the lord
[54:09] we want to talk about amen that rock we
[54:12] want to talk about that anchor we want
[54:14] to talk also about amen rest amen we
[54:18] want to try to carry it over into a rest
[54:21] and amen basically I want to come off of
[54:24] this one quote where amen that we
[54:26] started with is this okay amen now I'm
[54:30] bring that out but I won't mention that
[54:33] um I won't read it because I don't have
[54:34] this quote with me but where brother
[54:36] bham talked to where we started off at
[54:38] where he says you know I just don't know
[54:40] what anybody what I would do if it
[54:43] wasn't for me to be a Christian I don't
[54:45] understand how anybody can go through
[54:46] this life without being a Christian I
[54:49] don't understand it amen praise the Lord
[54:51] and then of course as we know brother
[54:53] bam of course was about 12:00 or 11:00 I
[54:56] think he said in bed and so forth and no
[54:58] doubt brother bam was thinking about the
[55:00] Lord and so forth and he got a
[55:01] revelation and he begin to talk to his
[55:04] wife and she raised up he says you know
[55:06] and listened to him for a while and she
[55:08] went to preach and he says it this way
[55:10] and I said the Christian Base the
[55:12] Christian faith now remember this is
[55:14] part three of Amen uh looking about the
[55:17] Christian about the Christian Christian
[55:19] faith is based solidly upon rest
[55:26] amen that's right a Christian is not
[55:29] tossed about amen we covered some of
[55:32] that I believe it was Sunday talking
[55:33] about you know our emotions amen how
[55:35] that people live so much by their
[55:38] emotions amen up and down and in and out
[55:42] Bo if you you're on a roller coaster is
[55:44] that right see taste feel hear smell
[55:47] conscious read imagination and all those
[55:49] things then if you're on that and you're
[55:51] going by that you're certainly going to
[55:53] be tossed about
[55:56] memory boy each one of those takes so
[55:58] much time to think about it amen the a
[56:01] Christian doesn't run from place to
[56:03] place he says a Christian doesn't
[56:06] fuss amen and
[56:08] fume and worry about things a Christian
[56:13] rests amen it's all over it's all
[56:17] finished for the believer at Calvary
[56:20] amen now the last song you sing Oh
[56:23] sickness may come this appointments but
[56:25] the Christians at rest knowing this that
[56:28] God is able to keep that which he has
[56:30] performed or promised isn't that right
[56:32] knowing that no matter what the thing is
[56:34] or how it looks there's not sickness
[56:37] there's no sorrow there's no death
[56:39] there's no starvation or anything that
[56:41] can separate us from the love of
[56:44] [Music]
[56:45] God praise be to God Amen there's not
[56:48] salvation or anything that can separate
[56:51] us from the love of of God I like that
[56:57] don't you amen this is where we kind of
[56:59] left off and U uh I believe uh 2
[57:03] Corinthians 4 amen uh you know we left
[57:07] off talking about you know how that the
[57:09] Christian amen once you're on the
[57:10] backside of that desert and you have got
[57:12] that anchor amen and you've got got your
[57:15] anchor gripped upon the solid rock of
[57:18] Jesus Christ and I want you to
[57:19] understand that as I study this and as I
[57:21] look at this I realize that there is I
[57:25] haven't even touched I really haven't
[57:26] even touched a whole lot of the what it
[57:29] means that backside of the desert that
[57:31] backside of the desert experience it
[57:33] means a lot amen and all the things that
[57:36] it types and and the the shadows of it
[57:39] amen talking about coming to the death
[57:41] of yourself or you know the back side of
[57:43] the desert hey Moses had to learn that
[57:44] it's not about you Moses didn't brother
[57:46] bam say that God took had take Moses on
[57:49] the back side of the desert amen and
[57:51] working him for 40 years to him to died
[57:55] to himself a't that right took him 4
[57:57] years to get all of that education and
[57:59] that knowledge and all that his own
[58:01] abilities and everything out of
[58:04] him amen and and finally he man he did
[58:07] you know and and from that he became a
[58:09] mighty man of God God is taking amen and
[58:12] and breaking us down now
[58:17] uh like I said let me just uh it's also
[58:20] type another type I want to just touch
[58:23] this before we go further on on
[58:25] and how How firm that we are gripped
[58:27] upon the rock but you know in that
[58:29] backside of the desert experience here
[58:32] we are upon the rock there's another an
[58:34] example of it I believe it is I mean you
[58:37] can take the eagle story isn't that
[58:38] right take the eagle story of how that
[58:40] egg is hatched amen amen it may have
[58:42] looked like a chicken and acted like a
[58:44] chicken but it wasn't no chicken is that
[58:46] right something has transformed
[58:48] something
[58:50] changed oh my praise the Lord I like
[58:53] what he said oh I want you to get this
[58:55] don't you never let this pass from you
[58:56] if a man's ever stood in that sacred
[58:58] sands on the back side of the desert
[59:00] when he meets God face to face there's
[59:02] not enough devils and all of Hell could
[59:04] ever take that away from him we've
[59:07] covered that he knows that he's met God
[59:09] he knows that he's had an experience he
[59:11] talked to God regardless of what the
[59:15] opposition is he can say from that time
[59:21] something changed me how many know that
[59:24] a caterpillar a worm like that amen
[59:26] before they go through a metaphor
[59:28] morphos I believe it's called amen they
[59:30] go into this cocoon and Cocoon so to
[59:32] speak hangs there become liquefied and
[59:34] everything else amen but when that
[59:36] cocoon comes out it comes out not a
[59:38] wiggly old worm that you would brush off
[59:40] of yourself but a wonderful butterfly
[59:42] that you would enjoy having on your hand
[59:44] and that's about the way that a Believer
[59:46] is you get in the presence of God and
[59:47] let God change you amen and you won't
[59:50] have a wolf nature anymore amen God will
[59:53] take you and change you from a
[59:56] wolf I could tear that person to PES how
[1:00:00] you doing my brother how are you I just
[1:00:02] love you brother
[1:00:05] huh he'll change your nature from a wolf
[1:00:09] to a Sheep amen even it's better B
[1:00:12] another illustration of the back side
[1:00:13] talking about a watermelon you take the
[1:00:15] life of or not just a watermelon but the
[1:00:17] life of anything and transported and
[1:00:19] that's what happens on the back side God
[1:00:21] takes your life out and he puts his life
[1:00:23] in he takes a Dage or gunfight or
[1:00:27] whatever amen that out of
[1:00:31] him and he puts a different spirit in so
[1:00:35] many different illustrations of that
[1:00:36] backside of the desert of what God does
[1:00:40] it's
[1:00:42] amazing how many know that backside of
[1:00:44] desert's experience is amazing
[1:00:47] grace we'll be talking about that
[1:00:49] backside of desert through all of
[1:00:51] eternity all you can talk about the
[1:00:53] Mysteries and deep things of God but I
[1:00:55] one my Prophet he'll be singing
[1:00:59] amaz sing

[1:01:08] Sound you'll hear me way down in

[1:01:31] holler
[1:01:33] GL I was was lost but now I'm found I
[1:01:38] was bind but now I
[1:01:41] see that's what it
[1:01:44] means to be changed from one thing to
[1:01:49] another
[1:01:50] Hallelujah to be anchored from being on
[1:01:54] in sand to on a solid
[1:01:58] rock you realize that everything about
[1:02:01] your own life is all sinking sand this
[1:02:04] world is sinking sand nations are
[1:02:06] sinking sand time is sinking sand your
[1:02:09] body sinking
[1:02:12] sand I didn't even realize it but I
[1:02:14] thought about an hourglass with all of
[1:02:16] that sand I said you know our lives are
[1:02:18] like that sand going down through there
[1:02:21] and then later I remembered there's a
[1:02:24] Ryme or something that says as the hours
[1:02:27] through the S uh as the Sands through
[1:02:30] the hour is that right so are the days
[1:02:33] of our lives
[1:02:36] huh every time that sand drips down
[1:02:38] there goes another one of your days
[1:02:40] there goes another day there goes
[1:02:41] another day it's getting emptier down
[1:02:42] here up here Fuller down there amen when
[1:02:46] that last sand goes
[1:02:48] through
[1:02:49] amen that's it for this life but aren't

[1:02:54] that doesn't mean it's the end of it

[1:03:02] flipping over we'll be flipping for an
[1:03:04] eternity we'll never die how many glad
[1:03:08] that you have been brought from the dead
[1:03:10] to
[1:03:11] [Music]
[1:03:13] life
[1:03:18] amen amen I was thinking about another
[1:03:21] illustration of what happened on the
[1:03:24] back
[1:03:26] side what happened on the back side and
[1:03:30] I
[1:03:31] thought there's the scripture says
[1:03:33] somewhere of something about as those
[1:03:35] from the
[1:03:36] dead I went to looking for it something
[1:03:40] about raising from the dead I know we've
[1:03:42] been quickened we we who were once dead
[1:03:44] in sins and trespasses but I thought
[1:03:46] there was a more sure scripture amen
[1:03:49] about us raising from the dead
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:56] so let me just say
[1:03:58] this you and I are like
[1:04:04] Lazarus you're like Lazarus in the
[1:04:08] grave huh you can say I know what it's
[1:04:11] like to be like Lazarus in the
[1:04:15] grave and to have him here and to hear
[1:04:18] him call my
[1:04:20] name how many knows those who he
[1:04:24] predestinated he
[1:04:25] called how many believ God calls
[1:04:29] you amen I thought boy you better have
[1:04:32] scripture for this but you don't want to
[1:04:34] be going off somewhere huh so I looked
[1:04:37] and I found something over in in in in
[1:04:40] Romans 8 7 I believe it was in verse
[1:04:45] four wherefore my brethren ye also are
[1:04:48] become dead to the law by the body of
[1:04:50] Christ that you should be married to
[1:04:51] another even
[1:04:55] to him who is raised from the dead and I
[1:04:58] saidwell that's not talking about me
[1:05:00] that's Christ that's the wrong scripture
[1:05:03] you know and I was looking for the
[1:05:04] scripture and now God knows if I found
[1:05:06] it but I looked over across here and
[1:05:09] there's something in pink over here all
[1:05:11] right that says what and I look and it
[1:05:13] says because it's something about us
[1:05:14] raising from the
[1:05:16] dead and it says in verse 11 no let's
[1:05:18] just go to that one because I want to
[1:05:20] come back and pick that other one
[1:05:22] up well let's just read it
[1:05:26] likewise if I go back I'll be turkey
[1:05:29] hunting I'll lose all my stuff so we're
[1:05:31] going to lose if I don't pick it up
[1:05:33] right here re likewise reckon ye
[1:05:35] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
[1:05:39] but unto God through Jesus Christ Our
[1:05:42] Lord let sin therefore not let not sin
[1:05:46] therefore rain in your moral body that
[1:05:48] you should obey it in the lust thereof
[1:05:50] neither yield ye your members as
[1:05:52] instruments of righteousness unto sin
[1:05:56] but yield yourselves unto God as those
[1:06:00] that are alive from the
[1:06:03] [Music]
[1:06:05] dead wo act like you have risen from the
[1:06:10] [Music]
[1:06:11] dead how many knows on the back side of
[1:06:14] that desert oh brother B he had to
[1:06:16] preach amen different message but how
[1:06:18] that we are to die to ourselves not just
[1:06:20] to die but to rot to ourselves that's he
[1:06:23] asked to completely die I want you
[1:06:26] understand tonight I hope tonight after
[1:06:27] tonight we realize maybe we get a
[1:06:29] picture of whether we are really dead or
[1:06:35] not huh I want to make let's see how
[1:06:39] just really how dead we
[1:06:42] are because we can never get the rest
[1:06:45] never get the rest until you're
[1:06:49] dead oh

[1:06:57] of people of God is't that

[1:07:04] example of somebody that was
[1:07:07] anchored ain't that right he knew what

[1:07:21] dead I like that he could tell you you
[1:07:24] better be dead he says that we are not
[1:07:27] to serve sin but we're going to act amen
[1:07:29] as though we have been risen from the
[1:07:32] dead cuz that's exactly what we we were
[1:07:34] dead how many believe we were dead in
[1:07:35] sins and trespass and God quickened you

[1:10:06] back side of the desert my just just
[1:10:08] what it's all about everything from that
[1:10:11] CAD
[1:10:12] pillar to that eagle story Amen to that
[1:10:16] little creature brother brand talk about
[1:10:18] but B talked about you know the
[1:10:19] difference between a man or or somebody
[1:10:21] that's saved perhaps or even you can
[1:10:23] type with somebody going to heaven and
[1:10:25] and and what this Earth is like it's
[1:10:26] like that one time that we was down in
[1:10:30] the depth of the sea he said there's
[1:10:31] creatures down there from what to
[1:10:33] understand he says don't even have eyes
[1:10:35] all they have is sensors it's so dark
[1:10:37] down there they don't need eyes all they
[1:10:40] have is feelers they have little feelers
[1:10:42] out there oh oh there's something there
[1:10:45] huh is that right so deep down they
[1:10:49] can't see nothing they just have a
[1:10:51] feeler I thought that's the way a lot of
[1:10:52] people are they only way they can live
[1:10:54] by their
[1:10:55] feelings Lord have mercy it's a terrible
[1:10:57] way to live cuz I don't want to brush up
[1:10:59] against a big old shark would you or
[1:11:01] something that would eat me before I
[1:11:02] finally figured out hey you better swim
[1:11:04] as fast as you can jig Jag and zigzag
[1:11:06] and get out of
[1:11:09] here
[1:11:11] amen but he says you take that little
[1:11:13] old fish amen and you bring him up and
[1:11:15] all of a sudden you make him a human
[1:11:16] being and he would say I I don't ever
[1:11:19] want to be down in that Darkness
[1:11:21] again I don't ever want be with all guys
[1:11:24] again I want to see the beauty of the
[1:11:26] creation of almighty God don't you
[1:11:29] realize that unless you a man unless he
[1:11:31] is born again he cannot even see the
[1:11:34] kingdom of God you are
[1:11:36] Lind to the kingdom of God unless you
[1:11:39] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:11:41] think you can see but you can't really
[1:11:43] see

[1:11:47] lemonade oh I got the lemonade I got the
[1:11:50] lemonade that don't do nothing for you
[1:11:53] not until you drink the
[1:11:55] lemonade oh taste and see that the Lord
[1:11:58] is good amen it don't do no good there

[1:12:02] it's got to be somewhere beside just in
[1:12:04] the
[1:12:06] mind that's another type of What It's
[1:12:09] Like on the backside of the desert
[1:12:11] experience being transformed from that
[1:12:14] fish into a human
[1:12:16] being and I'll tell you what that's you
[1:12:20] was a vile wretched sinner lost and dead

[1:14:46] big preachers big
[1:14:48] preachers brother brandom never tried to
[1:14:51] make himself a big preacher never never

[1:19:15] murmurers
[1:19:18] complainers their own lusts and their
[1:19:21] mouth speaking great in words having men
[1:19:24] persons and admiration because of
[1:19:26] unbelief who are these murmurs and
[1:19:28] complainers spots in your Feast of CH
[1:19:31] when they Feast with you feeding
[1:19:32] themselves without fear they clouds that
[1:19:35] are without water carried about of winds
[1:19:37] trees whose fruit wither without fruit
[1:19:41] chist dead plucked up by the

[1:34:25] wonder how D how far David was from
[1:34:28] Goliath
[1:34:31] huh have you ever read in the Old
[1:34:34] Testament how that so many Stone
[1:34:37] throwers could hit a rock or something
[1:34:39] so many Paces long way off they could
[1:34:42] hit it they were good
[1:34:44] amen but I believe it was the prophet
[1:34:46] God had said and I believe you and I
[1:34:48] know that it wasn't the accuracy of
[1:34:49] David's ability
[1:34:52] he might have been good but I've often
[1:34:54] said I don't care if it slipped out
[1:34:56] whenever he was slinging about the third

[1:34:59] way go the wrong way it to come around
[1:35:03] and it sck right in that Giant's head
[1:35:06] cuz that's God for you it wouldn't have
[1:35:09] mattered because it's not David's power

[1:35:14] that he was resting
[1:35:15] in amen I'm sure it didn't go that way

[1:37:36] something to live for
[1:37:39] amen take a prisoner that's Happy in
[1:37:41] prison he'll sit there and rot but if

[1:37:45] escaping he'll figure out how as long as
[1:37:48] he's got a little bit of Hope let me
[1:37:49] tell you B says that hope that we have
[1:37:52] in Christ is the anchor of our soul amen
[1:37:55] Paul said faith that if hope that is
[1:37:57] seen is not hope anymore because why
[1:38:00] would you hope for something that you
[1:38:01] see but if you don't see it then you
[1:38:03] have to hope for it
[1:38:06] amen praise the Lord you love
[1:38:09] him oh

[1:38:14] uh let's go just a little bit here amen
[1:38:19] we've got 10 more minutes let's go recap
[1:38:22] on this one scripture here in Romans in
[1:38:28] Romans let me see what we got left
[1:38:39] here Romans it's the scripture we read
[1:38:43] already likewise reckon yourselves to be
[1:38:47] dead unto sin but alive unto God through
[1:38:51] Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin
[1:38:54] therefore reign in your mortal body that
[1:38:57] you should obey it in the
[1:39:00] lust
[1:39:02] thereof amen but yield your members as
[1:39:06] instruments of right don't don't neither
[1:39:09] yield ye your members as instruments of
[1:39:11] unrighteousness Unto sin but yield
[1:39:13] yourselves unto God as those that are
[1:39:15] alive from the dead and your members as
[1:39:18] instruments of righteousness
[1:39:22] unto God
[1:39:24] Amen
[1:39:27] Galatians 6 gal 6 is where we'll go
[1:39:32] next
[1:39:39] amen once you get to Galatians 6 go back
[1:39:43] to Hebrews
[1:39:46] 3 Hebrews
[1:39:48] 3 because in order to explain that one
[1:39:52] we need to have Hebrews
[1:40:02] here and I'm going to I'm going to skip
[1:40:05] a lot there but we're going to go down
[1:40:06] to
[1:40:10] verse six
[1:40:13] okay seeing therefore it REM remain that
[1:40:16] some must enter therein and they to whom
[1:40:19] it was first preached enter not in
[1:40:21] because of unbelief again he limited a
[1:40:24] certain day saying in David today after
[1:40:27] so long a
[1:40:30] time after so long a
[1:40:33] time as it is said today if you will
[1:40:36] hear his voice Harden not your hearts
[1:40:38] for if Jesus had given them rest then
[1:40:41] would he not afterwards have spoken of
[1:40:43] another day there remain therefore a
[1:40:46] rest to the people of God now remember
[1:40:49] where we coming from brother Bram says
[1:40:52] the whole Christian faith is based upon
[1:40:54] rest isin that right our faith our life
[1:40:58] the Christian Life is based upon
[1:41:02] rest and we're going to kind of look at
[1:41:04] how we get there because we got to labor
[1:41:06] to get there
[1:41:09] amen there remaineth therefore a rest of
[1:41:12] the people of God for he that is entered
[1:41:14] into his rest he also has ceased from
[1:41:19] his own works as God did from
[1:41:24] his Amen Let Us labor therefore to enter
[1:41:27] into rest least any
[1:41:30] man fall after the same example of
[1:41:34] unbelief now we're going to go back a
[1:41:38] page in chapter 3 verse
[1:41:43] 11 verse 10 wherefore I was grieved with
[1:41:46] that generation said they do always eror
[1:41:48] in their heart and they have not known
[1:41:51] my
[1:41:53] ways man excuse me in verse 8 it says
[1:41:57] Harden not your hearts as in the Prov
[1:42:00] Prov provocation in the day of
[1:42:02] Temptation in the wilderness amen he
[1:42:05] remember he speaks about hearing his
[1:42:07] voice Now understand that coming to rest
[1:42:10] is about hearing God's voice you
[1:42:13] understand hearing his
[1:42:16] voice because you will not have rest
[1:42:19] without faith ain't that right
[1:42:21] there's no rest without faith why do you
[1:42:23] think there is no rest for the people in
[1:42:25] the world out there you're doing two
[1:42:27] things you're either resting or
[1:42:30] running you're in
[1:42:33] weary
[1:42:34] oppressed or whatever in allo things or
[1:42:37] you're resting when your fathers tempted
[1:42:39] me proved me saw my Works 40 years
[1:42:41] wherefore I was grieved with that
[1:42:42] generation said they always Ro error in
[1:42:45] their heart they have not known my ways
[1:42:46] so I swear in my wrath that they shall
[1:42:48] not enter into my rest take heed bre
[1:42:51] least there be any of you in any of you
[1:42:53] an evil heart of unbelief in departing
[1:42:57] from the Living God but exhort one
[1:42:59] another daily while it is called today
[1:43:01] least any of you be hardened through the
[1:43:03] deceitfulness of sin amen now we go back
[1:43:06] all the way across we're going to skip
[1:43:08] all these other but if you'll notice
[1:43:10] there he says that when you hear his
[1:43:12] voice amen heed amen because there is a
[1:43:16] rest for the people of God labor
[1:43:19] therefore he says to enter into that
[1:43:21] rest and the point that I want to make
[1:43:23] with all of this is that if you have
[1:43:25] entered into his rest it means that you
[1:43:29] like God haveed from your own
[1:43:34] Works Galatians let's look at our works
[1:43:37] for a few minutes would that be okay I
[1:43:39] hope everybody doesn't have to get to
[1:43:41] work too early we won't go too
[1:43:44] long Galatians 5 and verse 16 amen
[1:43:51] actually let's go down to the verse 19
[1:43:53] we'll skip a little for you now the
[1:43:55] works of the flesh are manifest which
[1:43:58] are these what is at the top of the
[1:44:02] list adultery what did Brother Bram says

[1:44:07] weapon ill-dressed woman wrong dressed
[1:44:10] woman more people will go to hell

[1:44:17] beer joints in the
[1:44:19] country a and fornication to top of the
[1:44:22] list and I looked up the lasciviousness
[1:44:25] because I didn't know what it was he
