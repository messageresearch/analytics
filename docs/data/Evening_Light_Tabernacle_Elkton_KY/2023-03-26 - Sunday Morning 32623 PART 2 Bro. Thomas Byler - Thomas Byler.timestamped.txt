[0:00] hey man it's been so long why the whole
[0:03] holy spirit will just search
[0:06] throughout the whole thing
[0:08] amen and I got to thinking because this
[0:10] the thing of looking has you know you
[0:12] can see this in different ways you know
[0:15] because if the Bible talks about seek
[0:17] the Lord while he might be found amen
[0:20] and it says without faith it's possible
[0:22] to please God Amen for they that come to
[0:24] God
[0:25] I must believe he is and that he is a
[0:28] rewarder of them that what diligently
[0:30] looked for him or seek Him for someone
[0:33] you're looking for seeking something or
[0:35] look
[0:37] for something because guys
[0:40] think you're in there
[0:42] now we know the prophet said that no man
[0:45] seeks after God and so forth because God
[0:47] has to put that Seeker in there and when
[0:49] he puts that seeking ability in there
[0:51] amen Pentecost and Azusa Street happen
[0:55] when people would pray eight hours a day
[0:57] seeking his faith God honored
[1:01] they're seeking how many God honors
[1:04] their prayers you know in just this
[1:05] little bit you know that I know that
[1:07] we've got a little bit of a
[1:09] um a prayer Club going on right a little
[1:12] prayer Club going on and as soon as
[1:14] these issues come up and everybody
[1:16] got the friend look at what happened
[1:18] look at the different ones that were
[1:20] raised up and things that happened you
[1:22] know that Beyond science beyond what the
[1:24] dog
[1:25] just said
[1:28] um
[1:30] who was it uh Rebecca Hefner I guess she
[1:33] lost the leg but something like that you
[1:36] know the others had caught it and she
[1:39] got they died
[1:40] you know and so you think about whenever
[1:42] it's expired it's God's got to be God
[1:44] and spare somebody like that you know
[1:46] but I want you my focus this morning is
[1:48] when you see God and when you pray you
[1:51] know it works amen God hears that God
[1:54] Honors that and we ought to do that more
[1:57] are you with me this morning
[1:59] amen so you know there's a different
[2:01] different things they don't really seek
[2:03] after him amen amen blessed are they
[2:07] that hungerth thirsts after
[2:09] righteousness no be filled seek and ye
[2:13] shall find aren't you glad that you can
[2:16] look for God and you can see him and you
[2:19] can find him you want more God you can
[2:22] find it
[2:24] you want a deeper walk with God it's
[2:26] there
[2:27] but boy you got to overcome every
[2:29] thought the devil puts in your mind
[2:34] every distraction that he tries to
[2:36] distract you with you got to start
[2:37] blocking that stuff out
[2:39] amen how many believe that because we've
[2:41] got a lot of junk flying around
[2:43] there's a whole lot of junk that wants
[2:45] to come into your mind I'll tell you
[2:46] responsibilities and worldly cares and
[2:49] problems and everything else
[2:52] and you gotta say God I don't want to
[2:54] hear all of that I don't want to see all
[2:55] of that all I want to see is you
[2:58] because I want you to know something
[3:00] that oh whether it was in Ephesians
[3:03] whether it was Paul or whether it was
[3:04] John it's us and without in the
[3:07] beginning was the word the word was with
[3:08] God and the Word was God it was made
[3:10] flesh him and dwell Among Us
[3:13] he says in the beginning he says God
[3:14] created All Things by Jesus Christ he
[3:17] made everything and evil without him
[3:18] there was not anything made that was
[3:20] made when you look again the look of God
[3:22] you begin to look into him as the
[3:24] creator of all things
[3:26] Apollo address it in Jesus he says we're
[3:29] talking about the God that made
[3:30] everything because begin to look at the
[3:33] Great Mighty God one other place he says
[3:35] look unto the heels from where your
[3:37] strength comes from amen maybe not too
[3:39] much in the Hills but the god that made
[3:41] the Hills
[3:43] ah
[3:46] when you begin to look at creation it
[3:49] can do a lot for you
[3:50] isn't that right brother Brandon people
[3:52] preach to sell a message called
[3:55] the paradox
[3:56] you talked about the sun moon to
[3:58] creation and it's a paradox it's all a
[4:00] miracle isn't that something how God can
[4:02] be everywhere he made everything amen
[4:04] things that science can't explain how
[4:06] everything works together and people
[4:08] still can't see God
[4:11] I've come to the conclusion wrote it in
[4:13] my notes here he says you know the demon
[4:15] Jesus said he says they have eyes but
[4:17] they see not
[4:18] amen they think you see but they don't
[4:20] see
[4:21] because why because you've got to see
[4:23] with the eyes of your understanding
[4:29] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[4:36] so let me tell you it's amazing grace
[4:39] How Sweet the Sound
[4:42] if you can see anything
[4:44] if you can see grace if you can see
[4:46] salvation if you can turn alive it'll
[4:48] because God opens your understanding
[4:51] opens your mind opens your thoughts
[4:54] I'm determined that we don't need it
[4:55] just for salvation you have to have
[4:57] grace Amazing Grace that has to Open the
[4:58] Eyes of your understanding isn't that
[5:00] right to be able to see him
[5:02] and that's my focus and why do you want
[5:04] to preach on look well when I
[5:06] when look come into mind and it's that's
[5:09] exactly what we're doing isn't it we are
[5:11] looking at him
[5:13] we're looking at what he's worthy of
[5:15] we're looking at what he's worthy to
[5:17] receive
[5:18] amen
[5:19] Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus and look fully
[5:22] in the wonderful face and the things of
[5:24] this Earth will grow strangely dim
[5:26] you know how many things other things
[5:28] everybody is looking at you know how
[5:30] easy it is to look at other things other
[5:32] than Jesus Christ it's real easy to do
[5:34] and the world is certainly doing it
[5:37] but I believe we've got to keep our eyes
[5:40] on Jesus
[5:42] we need to get our eyes on him
[5:46] amen praise the Lord
[5:48] oh my we have to have the understanding
[5:51] let me just say this and that is you
[5:53] know I truly believe that every thought
[5:55] that comes to your mind when somebody
[5:57] talks to you about something you know
[5:59] it's important that person understands
[6:01] what you're talking about
[6:04] huh
[6:05] isn't that right sometimes it's a little
[6:07] hard but let me say it this way and
[6:09] you'll say it wait and then you say oh I
[6:11] see yeah
[6:12] what you mean now
[6:14] amen because it starts the comments and
[6:17] so forth and it's the same way let me
[6:18] say this with our everyday life without
[6:21] everything that we think all the
[6:23] problems no matter what comes up in your
[6:24] life you need God to open up your
[6:27] thoughts in your mind and your eyes to
[6:29] be able to see
[6:31] direction to go
[6:33] what to do
[6:35] are you with me
[6:37] well I'll need God's Direction
[6:39] we need him to open our eyes to see how
[6:42] to walk because if you aren't careful
[6:44] you will think they're all thought
[6:46] and if you don't catch God's thought and
[6:48] God's mind on it you'll do the wrong
[6:50] thing you'll mess up
[6:53] [Applause]
[6:56] yeah we all are we're all a witness that
[7:00] whenever you do the wrong thing if you
[7:01] think the wrong thing don't have the
[7:03] right answer huh
[7:05] buddy I've done it way too many times
[7:10] uh-huh
[7:12] glory to God
[7:14] and I also want to I want to you know
[7:17] I also want to speak and bring into
[7:20] this morning the eagle story the story
[7:24] of the eagle
[7:25] amen
[7:28] but I wanna before we do I want to talk
[7:30] about how that job just talked about job
[7:33] for just a minute
[7:35] it might seem like we're jumping or
[7:37] jumping around
[7:39] but I may know that job was a blessed
[7:41] man
[7:42] he had sheep and oxen and children and
[7:45] houses and lands and he was blessed by
[7:47] God
[7:48] beyond what you can imagine
[7:51] huh that received riches and power and
[7:54] glory and strength
[7:56] yet all those things
[7:58] he had wealth richest
[8:03] and
[8:05] God took it all away
[8:09] he lost his children a lot his ox and
[8:12] look us everything lost all of it
[8:17] you know and he says the Bible says in
[8:20] job and then job arose and rents his
[8:23] mantle shaved his head and fell down on
[8:24] the ground and worshiped and sat naked
[8:27] came out of my mother's womb and naked
[8:31] shall I return feather the lord gave and
[8:33] the Lord taken away blessed be the name
[8:36] of the Lord
[8:41] oh my can you imagine
[8:44] this man had his roots planted
[8:51] huh
[8:52] his roots were so deep that the great
[8:55] storms that come his way
[8:58] could not blow him over
[9:01] how many seen trees blown over lately
[9:04] these straight winds that have come
[9:06] through anything that could be blown
[9:08] over was blown over
[9:10] they Blaze that if you're not grounded
[9:13] in Christ in this hour the first little
[9:15] storm that comes over amen they're gonna
[9:17] blow you over
[9:20] huh
[9:22] but not Joe
[9:24] and notice here how that job says I like
[9:27] it he says
[9:30] God
[9:31] gave
[9:33] how many knows anything you have
[9:35] God gave you
[9:44] what's God gave me that
[9:49] God gave me that the Lord can take it
[9:52] away
[9:54] anytime he wants
[9:57] job says he could give me riches he'd
[9:59] give me all this why for one thing since
[10:02] he made without him there was not
[10:04] anything was made there was absolutely
[10:06] nothing that was nothing but God by
[10:09] himself so whatever comes forth from
[10:11] that is
[10:12] tears it belongs to him
[10:16] let me believe that
[10:18] everything you have
[10:21] all your riches it don't matter what it
[10:23] is it belongs to God
[10:25] oh my and it God can take it away from
[10:28] you in a day's time
[10:32] he gave it he's got a right to take it
[10:34] away if he chooses to
[10:36] his
[10:38] our strength our youth
[10:41] anything you have God gave it to you
[10:44] that's why I want to praise God with
[10:45] what a God whatever God give me
[10:48] [Music]
[10:50] I wonder why the weapon with everything
[10:52] I got
[10:54] it it was everything you got cause he's
[10:57] the one that gives it then it belongs to
[10:59] him
[11:01] whoa
[11:03] Hallelujah
[11:06] foreign
[11:13] idea didn't he
[11:15] he knew where he'd come from
[11:18] he is worthy to receive it
[11:21] 'll be taking it away bless it be the
[11:24] name of the Lord
[11:26] Hallelujah
[11:28] amen
[11:31] Glory
[11:33] it all my point is
[11:35] It All Belongs to him even
[11:39] your breath
[11:41] your health
[11:44] um
[11:45] thank you
[11:47] what Good's going to do if you gain the
[11:49] whole world and you find out you have
[11:51] terminal cancer you're going to die
[11:53] all the things in the world isn't going
[11:55] to matter to you anymore you're going to
[11:56] think about what your future holds where
[11:58] you're here
[12:00] amen
[12:02] praise the Lord how many knows none of
[12:04] these things can come upon us unless
[12:06] it's permitted of almighty God
[12:09] Hallelujah I actually glance that
[12:11] because then you can have faith hey if
[12:13] God allotted it
[12:15] he
[12:16] cannot also take it away
[12:19] he can take care of it he'll take care
[12:21] of it amen
[12:23] so this morning we want to focus amen
[12:26] looking at God's power all right it
[12:28] belongs to him
[12:31] and the reason part of that I wanted to
[12:32] go to the eagle story and look take a
[12:34] look at the Eagle story was because when
[12:37] I thought about power two things come to
[12:39] mind one of them was in Romans 9 and
[12:41] verse 17 it says for this scripture
[12:43] sayeth unto Pharaoh even for this same
[12:46] purpose have I raised thee up that I
[12:48] might show my power in you
[12:53] hey man I didn't have time to uh uh pull
[12:56] it up and so forth and pull a bunch of
[12:58] quotes on but you'll know what I'm
[12:59] talking about how did one brother Bannon
[13:01] was talking about that mother eat mother
[13:02] Eagle flopping her Wing isn't that right
[13:05] how did she like to show those little
[13:07] eaglets her power
[13:09] even brother Brown says God loves to
[13:11] show his power
[13:15] he wants you to understand that he is a
[13:19] powerful he wants you to see his power
[13:25] the lamb was worthy of power
[13:28] oh we brag about so many different
[13:30] things the world and many fantasizes
[13:33] itself and glorifies I don't care
[13:35] whether it's tractor pulls or whatever
[13:37] and the power to share power
[13:44] oh my I'll tell you what would you think
[13:46] about God's power and how to make
[13:47] Shivers run up your back Oh Glory think
[13:50] about that
[13:52] he said I raised you up Pharaoh so that
[13:54] I could show my power in you
[13:57] amen
[13:59] amen and that my name might be declared
[14:01] throughout all the Earth
[14:05] I have no so a little thought
[14:08] that is
[14:10] anybody probably puts it this way I
[14:14] think that anybody that ever amounted to
[14:16] a hill of beans
[14:18] but I'll put it this way anybody that's
[14:21] notable in history
[14:23] that we talk about that's worth talking
[14:25] about has been people who has put their
[14:28] confidence and their faith in almighty
[14:30] God that has looked to God that's why
[14:32] amen when Brother Brad was talking about
[14:34] David oh can you know all the time that
[14:37] David said God if my refuge is my shield
[14:40] here's my butler here's my defense and I
[14:44] thought he's also my offense
[14:46] he's not just my defense but he's my
[14:48] offense he's everything he's a strong
[14:51] power the righteous run into it that are
[14:53] safe
[14:54] that's why David was so great because he
[14:57] relied on almighty God and the power of
[14:59] almighty God I believe it was tall and
[15:01] said I don't come to you with enticing
[15:02] words of man's Wisdom but I come to you
[15:05] in the power of the spirits of your
[15:06] faith but not rest and the wisdom of man
[15:08] but it would rise to the power of God
[15:13] all right
[15:15] hey man how many believe that
[15:22] amen
[15:23] into power
[15:26] of almighty God that's what we're going
[15:28] to rest our faith now
[15:31] power and strength to me or same thing
[15:34] amen
[15:36] is that right power and strength
[15:39] something that's strong or powerful
[15:41] amen
[15:44] it's glory
[15:46] that's what God it's his
[15:50] foreign I couldn't do that if it wasn't
[15:53] for God
[15:54] huh
[15:56] you would have no power you would have
[15:58] no strength
[15:59] if it wasn't for God
[16:04] we certainly wouldn't have any spiritual
[16:06] strength
[16:08] amen
[16:10] not by might nor by power but by my
[16:13] spirit saith the Lord how many believe
[16:14] you ain't got power you ain't got
[16:16] nothing unless you got that spirit it's
[16:18] by God's spirit and God is allowed you
[16:20] to have his holy ghost
[16:24] is what gives you power you shall
[16:27] receive power or authority after that
[16:30] the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[16:35] all right that's further down
[16:38] Lord help us
[16:40] open my eyes Lord to see your salvation
[16:43] open my eyes Lord to see your great
[16:47] wonderful works that you've
[16:49] made in your creation oh Lord my God
[16:51] when I an awesome Wonder consider all
[16:53] the worlds the hands I've made
[16:55] I see the stars I hear The Rolling
[16:58] Thunder thy power throughout the
[17:00] Universe displayed that sings My I saw
[17:05] my savior God to thee How Great Thou Art
[17:09] How Great Thou Art
[17:13] [Music]
[17:16] you can have a Revival folks if you'll
[17:18] just open up your mind
[17:19] open up your heart
[17:21] begin to look at God and to see God
[17:24] amen all right
[17:29] how about another one is before we get
[17:31] into our thoughts
[17:33] let's talk about the brass serpent
[17:35] isn't that right
[17:37] now I believe it is also
[17:42] Isaiah 44
[17:46] nope that's not the one
[17:48] we'll try Isaiah 45
[17:50] verse 22
[17:53] it says look unto me and be ye saved all
[17:57] the ends of the Earth for I am God and
[17:59] there is none else
[18:01] look
[18:03] unto me
[18:04] just look this direction
[18:07] just look at him
[18:10] when Israel had sinned and they murmured
[18:13] and complained
[18:14] remember
[18:16] fiery serpents beat him
[18:20] I can imagine there were snakes in their
[18:22] beds under their sheets
[18:24] they couldn't get away from these
[18:26] serpents and these snakes
[18:28] and I think anybody that's a murmur and
[18:30] a complainer is a little bit snake bit
[18:33] huh
[18:34] God don't like murmurs complainers you
[18:36] don't have much for them he loves to put
[18:39] you in a real bind and see if you'll
[18:42] murmur and complain
[18:44] in a real pinch see if your murmur and
[18:46] compete at Israel let the Red Sea did he
[18:48] didn't feed him you know he let him get
[18:50] good and hungry
[18:53] then they'd let him get good and thirsty
[18:56] they complained every time
[18:59] huh Lord how many of those we have no
[19:02] room for complaining
[19:04] amen
[19:07] though he slayed me yeah I'll trust him
[19:10] fiery serpents and so Moses put up a
[19:13] brass surfing on a pole I guess they
[19:15] still have it on the Avenue says don't
[19:17] they a sign of healing
[19:19] and all they had to do oh boy but can
[19:22] you imagine that the the penalty and for
[19:24] I mean
[19:26] the the
[19:30] hmm
[19:31] the condition the condition to live was
[19:35] to look
[19:36] in other words if you want to live just
[19:38] look
[19:40] look and live look and live look to
[19:43] Jesus Christ and live it's recorded in
[19:46] God's word
[19:47] hallelujah it's only that we look and
[19:51] live
[19:54] amen I'm at least it was a symbol of
[19:56] what Christ would do on Jesus on the
[19:58] cross
[19:59] all you gotta do is look the coward if
[20:01] you want to live
[20:02] look and live
[20:04] amen what power amen
[20:08] oh look look
[20:10] now we want to pick up Luke in the
[20:13] middle of my story again let's start
[20:15] with the eagle story of a little bit
[20:16] shall we
[20:18] amen
[20:19] as the eagle Sears or nest if you want
[20:22] to read it and listen to it it's great
[20:24] for the brand and watched Eagles I don't
[20:25] know much about them I just go by what
[20:27] the prophet do about eagles
[20:29] how that he would take them in the clefs
[20:31] of The Rock and he would take him way up
[20:32] out of danger no coyotes and all of that
[20:35] wouldn't get to him in there right and
[20:36] kick him way up there and take sheepskin
[20:39] and so forth kill a sheep and take that
[20:41] good wool and put it bad down in there
[20:43] lay the eggs and hatch them things and
[20:45] they come out and it'd be all nice and
[20:48] cozy and soft
[20:50] oh they'd be happy mama would feed them
[20:53] food feed them food
[20:54] oh man that's just like a person born
[20:56] again
[20:58] huh amen come into the message of the
[21:01] hour I believe God sent a prophet oh God
[21:03] doesn't work amen you believe what Jesus
[21:05] did on Calvary amen something happens oh
[21:07] man you just love everybody and you
[21:09] think everybody loves you

[42:14] that
[42:17] because God changes mine
[42:19] did he mess up the now when God gives
[42:21] you something I believe he gives you
[42:23] that amen but sometimes we get to
[42:25] thinking well this is what he wants me
[42:26] to do and so forth
[42:28] amen but then we'll feel like no
[42:30] this is really what I feel like he's
[42:32] wanting to do and I'm saying like
[42:34] that's the direction I go amen
[42:37] so anyway just a thought she probably
[42:39] hadn't heard that before but a little
[42:41] something I felt like the Lord showed me
[42:43] amen not dedicated can't change his mind
[42:46] I guess but he's not very much very apt
[42:49] to do that is he
[42:50] all right praise the Lord Old Testament
[42:52] New Testament power wings and so forth I
[42:56] want you to understand I mean those that
[42:59] when he can if he needs to defeat all
[43:01] armies he'll do it
[43:04] oh brother bad I love that he says oh a
[43:06] host should Rise Against Me I shall not
[43:08] fear
[43:09] amen he is our Shield how many believes
[43:11] he's our shield and The Shield is not is
[43:13] not a sword a shield protects you
[43:16] hey man David knew what he was like for
[43:19] God to protect you
[43:22] I'm 62 years old almost I always say the
[43:26] next number because he's coming right up
[43:28] but I want you to understand that I got
[43:30] into this old because God has shielded
[43:32] me he has protected me he is my shield
[43:35] he knows how old I'm gonna get he knows
[43:38] how many years I am I'm shooting for 90.
[43:42] we don't know what he'll what it'll be
[43:44] of course after 78 80 90 years old years
[43:48] old I'll tell you what
[43:50] sometimes I understand why people want
[43:52] to go
[43:55] foreign
[43:57] not really in my age but a little bit I
[43:59] can get a little titch touch because
[44:01] it's nice to be able to get around how
[44:03] many enjoys getting around
[44:04] having strength yet but if you couldn't
[44:07] huh the condition in the living was just
[44:10] so bad amen be a Christian and be ready
[44:14] to go when God calls you
[44:16] amen how many is with me let's just be
[44:19] that doesn't matter if you're young or
[44:21] old always be ready to go whenever God
[44:23] calls you he's my strength Giver he is
[44:26] my all he is my all in all
[44:29] Oh What A Savior
[44:32] Oh What A Savior and when he believed
[44:35] that what a God what a mighty God we
[44:38] serve
[44:42] I can walk on water
[44:46] he raised the dead is that right not
[44:49] only that but I shed my blood on ovary I
[44:52] paid the price and there's power in
[44:56] the blood
[44:58] how many knows that boy I'll tell you
[45:00] what look at the last few thousand years
[45:02] and look at the power that Christ
[45:04] displayed is shedding up his blood Amen
[45:06] to give it to his children amen freedom
[45:09] from their sin
[45:10] forgiveness Grace
[45:13] it's all the power of God
[45:16] amen
[45:18] the power to overcome yourself I mean
[45:23] that's your biggest enemy
[45:26] true power
[45:28] this just comes to mind don't have it in
[45:30] my notes
[45:31] but Abraham I believe preached on a
[45:33] message called humble thyself
[45:34] he says you know if you can humble
[45:36] yourself and submit yourself to God
[45:39] he says you've got more power than the
[45:41] guy that can run all over the building
[45:43] shout and speak in tongues and
[45:45] everything else
[45:46] which I'm sure he's talking about
[45:48] somebody that does that but still
[45:50] doesn't have power over themselves amen
[45:52] because there's nothing in doing wrong
[45:54] with doing all of that but there's a lot
[45:55] of people that run scream shout and
[45:57] holler but they have never conquered
[45:59] yourself but if you humble yourself
[46:01] before almighty God and surrender
[46:02] yourself then he says you got more power
[46:04] than just the building God it gets all
[46:06] happy like and running all over the
[46:08] building and so forth
[46:10] how many knows it takes the power of
[46:12] Jesus Christ for you to be able to
[46:13] submit yourself to almighty God and to
[46:16] change your desires
[46:19] there we go there we go how many knows
[46:22] that's what we need
[46:24] well he's gonna try to quit this and try
[46:26] to quit that why don't you try to get
[46:28] rid of the desire to want to do it
[46:31] how many believes you'd quit then it'd
[46:32] be all done with
[46:34] people just go don't go far enough
[46:36] that's why I said a few weeks ago I said
[46:38] a halfway life is the most miserable
[46:39] life there is because you don't go all
[46:41] the way to possessing it you don't quite
[46:44] make it
[46:45] you're on that fence so to speak and
[46:47] don't make it far enough to get the
[46:49] power to overcome the desire for sin and
[46:52] that's what Jesus came to do he came to
[46:53] uh
[46:55] give you power over the desire for sin
[46:59] now we understand we understand that as
[47:01] long as you're in this flesh it will
[47:03] always want to raise up and it is a
[47:05] daily battle that you got to do amen
[47:09] but you can't overcome it amen
[47:14] with almighty God
[47:16] amen praise be to God
[47:19] I like that don't do the same how
[47:22] manybody's a believer
[47:24] is to have the same Faith Of God that
[47:26] God had when he spoke the world into
[47:28] existence
[47:30] yeah
[47:32] this is this I'm talking about to a
[47:34] veteran
[47:36] group of people I'm talking to a mature
[47:39] group of people so when I say the faith
[47:42] of God you already know that when I talk
[47:45] about you've got the very
[47:47] love that God had for the whole world
[47:49] when he gave his life on Calvary he
[47:52] believes a Believer has that same love
[47:55] in their heart
[47:58] that's right a real Christian has that
[48:00] same love
[48:04] and when it's hard to put up with people
[48:06] for a pair with people
[48:10] you have the long suffering of God
[48:12] how many believes the believer has a
[48:14] long suffering of God in their heart
[48:16] you're made out of the same material
[48:18] that little Eagle is made
[48:20] that it is Fame genetics as Jehovah is
[48:23] that great Mama eagle
[48:25] amen how many is glad for that
[48:27] how many would say this morning help me
[48:29] Lord because I I imagine and brother bam
[48:32] talked about flopping flopping in front
[48:33] of them but I imagine that this eagle
[48:36] on a perhaps kind of a windy day is out
[48:39] there in front of that nest and it is
[48:42] moving its tail back there a little
[48:43] flapping up back and forth a little bit
[48:45] if you ever watch the birds up in the
[48:46] air right did you ever notice how their
[48:47] back tail goes you know almost like an
[48:50] airplane they have to adjust that
[48:51] backtail right they'll adjust that back
[48:53] tail in the front feathers just a little
[48:54] bit but mostly the back and then
[48:57] there he is and he's looking over at
[48:59] them and he's just sitting right there
[49:01] in midair see and a little wind gusts
[49:05] come back he goes back and then turns
[49:07] and all of a sudden he goes another ten
[49:08] foot eye she looks see she
[49:12] amen God is teaching you and I when
[49:14] wind's coming your way just learn to set
[49:16] your swings of faith in that wind and
[49:19] cry amen and it'll lift you up a little
[49:21] above that trial above that thing that
[49:23] comes along see that's what you do
[49:27] God
[49:29] then you can say like job though he slay
[49:32] me and I'll trust him
[49:35] Lord have mercy we ain't never had that
[49:37] much so as much happen to us as job did
[49:40] him
[49:42] yet he could worship God by saying

[49:49] given the Lord has taken away blessed be
