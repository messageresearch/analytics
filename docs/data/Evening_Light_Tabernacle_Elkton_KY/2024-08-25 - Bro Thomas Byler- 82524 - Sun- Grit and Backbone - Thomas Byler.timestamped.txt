[8:00] God bless you may be seated brother
[8:16] Brian morning brothers and sisters like
[8:20] what brother Joy was saying if you look
[8:22] down the course of your life how many
[8:25] times do you see where God's hand is
[8:28] moving you and guiding you in the years
[8:32] that follow and the years P you
[8:36] know you know I'm a old I was raised on
[8:40] the Long Island Sound in the North Shore
[8:43] of Long Island and where am I am this
[8:45] morning at 65 I'm in Elon Kentucky this
[8:49] morning God moves us all along Our Lives
[8:51] to get us to a place where he wants us
[8:54] this morning if you would
[8:57] uh turn with you know I I guess that
[9:00] happens to you when you get older you
[9:01] want you wind up thinking about your I
[9:04] guess your childhood a little bit more
[9:05] than what you used to when you're in
[9:07] your middle age and sometimes I find
[9:10] myself thinking about you know just
[9:12] being a young man like some of these
[9:14] living on the North Shore of Long Island
[9:16] and all the things I used to do as a kid
[9:18] on the NorthShore and you know that's
[9:20] but God brought me somewhere else uh if
[9:23] you would turn with me to Philippians
[9:25] the 3D chapter
[9:32] little hint here I used to be able as a
[9:35] kid to get on my bike and I could fish
[9:37] for bass and
[9:39] crappie in a pond or in a in a lake and
[9:42] then get on my same bike and drive to
[9:46] the to the NorthShore and be able to
[9:48] fish in salt water I mean you know it's
[9:51] things you remember as a kid but I was
[9:53] reading this chapter I was talking about
[9:55] it um last uh Sunday I was
[10:01] thinking and I was talking to a person
[10:04] earlier this week about this and I I'll
[10:09] I'll read the word of God itself because
[10:11] it speaks for itself but uh this is what
[10:15] Paul had to say finally my brethren
[10:17] rejoice in the Lord to write the same
[10:19] things to you to me indeed is not
[10:22] Grievous but for you it is
[10:25] safe and Paul warns us here and this is
[10:29] thousands of year beware of dogs and
[10:31] beware of evil
[10:33] workers and uh Beware of
[10:37] concision and it goes on to say for we
[10:41] are the circumcision with worship God in
[10:43] the spirit rejoicing Christ Jesus and
[10:46] have no confidence in the flesh and
[10:49] that's where we're at this morning
[10:51] there's no there's you can't put your
[10:53] trust in the flesh in the in that you
[10:56] have to put your trust in the Lord this
[10:58] morning and he goes on to sayther I
[11:01] might also have confidence in the flesh
[11:03] if any other man thinketh that he hath
[11:06] where he might Trust In the Flesh I'm
[11:08] more and he he goes into saying who he
[11:11] is who he was actually before God got a
[11:14] hold of him circumcised The Eighth Day
[11:17] of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of
[11:19] Benjamin a Hebrew of Hebrews has touched
[11:22] in the law a Pharisee so he's
[11:24] identifying who he was before Jesus
[11:27] Christ saved him and brought him into
[11:29] position
[11:30] that he was here concerning Zeal
[11:32] persecuting the church touching the
[11:34] righteousness whichin the law blameless
[11:37] so he's identifying according to the law
[11:40] he lived blameless but it didn't mean
[11:42] anything even for him and he goes on to
[11:44] say but what things were gained to me I
[11:47] count it loss for Christ so he's willing
[11:49] to throw all that aside once God got a
[11:52] hold of him and revealed to him the word
[11:55] for his hour he was ready to throw it
[11:57] all aside this morning and he he goes on
[12:00] he doubtless I count all things but a
[12:02] loss for the Excellency of the knowledge
[12:04] of Christ Jesus my Lord from whom I have
[12:07] suffered the loss of all things and to
[12:10] count them but D that I might win Christ
[12:14] so he didn't look at his losses is
[12:16] something important he didn't look back
[12:18] he wasn't looking back to what he was he
[12:21] was looking forward to who he is today
[12:24] and that's the way we need to be as
[12:25] Christians not not looking back there's
[12:28] good things you that happened to you in
[12:29] your life that aren't aren't a problem
[12:32] looking back to but the person that we
[12:34] were the unrepented sinner that we were
[12:36] back in those days no time in our life
[12:40] should we be looking back to that person
[12:42] and Paul goes on to say and be found in
[12:46] him not having my own righteousness
[12:48] which is is of the law but that which is
[12:51] through the Faith of Christ the
[12:52] righteousness which is by God by faith
[12:55] so everything we are is by faith in
[12:57] Jesus Christ that I may know him and the
[13:00] power of his resurrection and the
[13:03] fellowship of his suffering be made
[13:05] conformable onto his death that's all
[13:07] our desire this morning that scripture
[13:10] speaks for itself but these last couple
[13:12] of verses is what I was talking about
[13:14] last weekend uh Sunday and kind of goes
[13:18] to it says if by any means I might
[13:20] attain unto the resurrection of the Dead
[13:24] not as though I had or already attained
[13:27] either was already perfect so he wasn't
[13:30] perfect before this but I follow after
[13:33] that which I may apprehend apprehend for
[13:36] that which I am apprehended of Jesus
[13:38] Christ so God got a hold of him not
[13:41] himself but God got a hold of Paul that
[13:44] day on the on the road to Damascus
[13:47] Brethren I count myself not to have
[13:49] happended but this one thing do I do
[13:52] forgetting those things which are behind
[13:55] and reaching forth onto those things
[13:57] which are before so his his whole mind
[14:00] his whole body everything was on the
[14:02] cross and he was looking forward to
[14:05] everything that he was doing in his life
[14:07] and he goes I press toward the mark of
[14:10] the prize of the high calling in Christ
[14:13] Jesus and I said Here let us therefore
[14:16] as many as be perfect be thus minded and
[14:19] if in anything you be otherwise minded
[14:22] God shall reveal even this onto you and
[14:25] then this is what I was thinking about
[14:26] and saying last weekend never less where
[14:29] to we have already attained let us walk
[14:32] by the same rules let us mind the same
[14:35] things and then this is Paul's telling
[14:39] this is kind of like what I was saying
[14:41] last weekend Paul saying says this
[14:43] Brethren be followers together of me and
[14:47] mark them which walk as you have have of
[14:51] us for an example so he's telling them
[14:54] if you have a Godly example follow that
[14:56] Godly example and he goes on to say say
[14:59] and we had that example in our age and
[15:01] these Believers had the example in their
[15:04] age in Paul and he goes on for many walk
[15:07] of whom I have told you often and now
[15:10] tell you even weeping that they are
[15:12] enemies of the Cross of Christ so Paul
[15:15] is saying that there are some out there
[15:17] already and he's before he even goes off
[15:19] the scene there are people perverting
[15:21] the Gospel of Jesus Christ already and I
[15:24] lost my place but whose end is
[15:28] destruction who got God is their belly
[15:30] and whose glory is their shame who mind
[15:33] Earthly things for our conversation is
[15:36] in heaven from whence also we look for
[15:39] the Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ who
[15:42] shall change our vile body that it may
[15:44] be fashion like unto the Glorious body
[15:47] is according to the work and whereby he
[15:50] is able even to subdue all things unto
[15:52] himself and I was thinking of another
[15:54] chapter in the Bible that kind of
[15:57] seconds this
[16:01] if you'll go with me to I was about to
[16:04] say I'm not if you go with me to Peter
[16:06] the thir
[16:09] chapter so we have an example you
[16:11] shouldn't be afraid to talk to people
[16:14] about the example who you have today the
[16:17] message that we follow there's nothing
[16:19] wrong in the message there's nothing to
[16:21] be afraid of there's nothing to be
[16:23] embarrassed about as long as you're
[16:25] leading people to Jesus Christ it'll all
[16:27] work out in the end and but um I don't
[16:32] want to read successive chapters but I
[16:34] always found in my life if I just read
[16:36] the word of God it's more than enough to
[16:38] keep you on the right path
[16:41] um he's Peter talks in this chapter
[16:44] about the new heavens and the new Earth
[16:47] and then starting at the about the 12th
[16:50] verse it says looking for the hastening
[16:52] onto the coming day of God wherein the
[16:54] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[16:57] and the elements shall put melt
[16:59] with fervent
[17:01] heat but then he he changes in the end
[17:04] in starting at this 13th verse
[17:06] nevertheless we according to his promise
[17:09] look for the new heavens and a new Earth
[17:11] wherein we dwell wherein dwelleth
[17:13] righteousness and we all know from the
[17:15] message of the hour that we follow from
[17:18] the word of God the only thing that's
[17:20] going to be on there that day is
[17:24] righteousness those that have given it
[17:26] all away and only
[17:29] Embrace Jesus Christ we're going to be
[17:31] there on that day and he goes on to say
[17:33] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[17:36] for such things be D be diligent that
[17:39] you may be found of him in peace without
[17:42] spot and blamus and account that
[17:45] longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation
[17:48] even as our beloved brother Paul also
[17:51] according to the wisdom given onto him
[17:53] have written onto you so Peter's
[17:55] identifying right here who Paul is
[17:58] saying what Paul Paul has
[18:00] written excuse me so he's identifying
[18:02] pet Peter Paul Peter is identifying Paul
[18:05] in the gospel here this morning and he
[18:08] goes on to say and also in his Epistles
[18:11] speaking in in them of these things in
[18:14] which are are some things hard to
[18:16] understand which they that are unlearned
[18:19] and unstable rest and that's really
[18:21] important for us the more this morning
[18:23] is to be stable in the word of God and
[18:27] and there's a lot of things that you can
[18:29] worry about but the word of God will
[18:31] settle it all and he goes on to say I
[18:34] lost my place again I say that a lot
[18:37] same thing hard to understand which they
[18:39] that are learned an unstable rest as
[18:42] they do also the other scriptures unto
[18:44] their own destructure and we don't have
[18:46] that problem in this day and age as long
[18:49] as you use the word of God and the
[18:50] message of the hour and don't put
[18:52] anything behind it or before it you'll
[18:55] be fine and he goes on to say here
[18:59] you therefore beloved seeing you know
[19:01] these things before be aware at least
[19:04] you being led away with the error of the
[19:06] wick Wicked fall from your own
[19:09] steadfastness but grow in Grace and in
[19:11] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[19:14] Christ to him be the glory forever and
[19:17] ever amen so I was listened to several
[19:20] messages yesterday and this morning and
[19:23] I was just thinking as we the world I'm
[19:26] I'm not even going to say the world is
[19:28] just a crazy place this morning so you
[19:30] can't worry about the world all you got
[19:32] to do is worry about yourself and your
[19:33] family that's the only thing that you
[19:35] really need to worry about and you
[19:37] shouldn't be worrying if you're in Jesus
[19:39] Christ this morning I know I teach a lot
[19:43] about it but if you have true Eternal
[19:45] hope this morning through the word of
[19:47] God you know it's settled already God
[19:50] has settled that for you already so
[19:52] there's nothing for you to worry about
[19:54] in the days that come ahead as long as
[19:57] you hold on to Jesus Christ this morning
[20:00] everything else will work its way out
[20:02] this morning brother
[20:10] David amen you love the Lord this
[20:13] morning amen let's stand if we could
[20:16] this morning sing that little

[51:31] kind of a cont I don't know I don't even
[51:33] know for sure what contemporary means
[51:35] but maybe a kind of contemporary title
[51:37] because usually you'll take a scripture
[51:38] or whatever but am me we want to talk
[51:40] about um amen grit with the help of the
[51:44] Lord this morning brother bam mentions
[51:46] grit eight times and so we have amen
[51:50] that we want to use Amen in speaking on
[51:52] this and so once again as always when I
[51:56] just take one simple scripture when the
[51:58] holy spirit opens it up amen if you
[52:01] would go down every Avenue that the Holy
[52:03] Spirit want wants you to go well we
[52:04] would be here a while but amen we'll

[52:24] amen turn your bibles if you will to
[52:26] Hebrew Hebrews the 12th chapter Hebrews
[52:33] 12 thank you brother Glenn for that song
[52:36] that was very
[52:51] good wherefore seeing we also are
[52:54] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[52:55] witnesses
[52:57] let us lay aside every weight and the
[52:58] sin which thus easily so easily beset us
[53:01] and let us run with patience the race
[53:03] that set it before us looking unto Jesus
[53:06] the author and the finisher of our faith
[53:08] who for the joy that was sit down before
[53:11] him endureed the cross despising the
[53:13] shame and is sit down at the right hand
[53:16] of the Throne of God for consider him
[53:18] that endured such contradiction of
[53:21] Sinners against himself least you be
[53:23] wearied and faint in your minds for he
[53:25] have not yet resisted unto blood
[53:28] striving against sin may God add His
[53:30] blessings to the reading of the word you
[53:32] can be seated this morning amen now in
[53:36] this I want to uh basically speak on I
[53:40] begin to think about this and let me
[53:42] just read the quote here before I pull
[53:43] pull some of this other up because one
[53:45] want to use a lot of different words to
[53:47] try to tie it into this brother brenon
[53:49] makes a statement he says you know
[53:50] anything that I hate to see is a
[53:53] spineless person call themselves a
[53:55] Christian my God wants somebody with
[53:58] grit and
[54:00] backbone so I titled it grit and
[54:03] backbone amen amen I like old buddy
[54:07] Robinson said Lord give me backbone the
[54:09] size of a saw log and plenty of
[54:12] knowledge in the Gable end of my soul
[54:15] and let me fight the devil as long as I
[54:17] got one tooth and then gum him till I
[54:22] die amen that's right I like that amen
[54:27] he got down in the corn field and said
[54:29] Lord if you don't give me the baptism of
[54:31] the Holy Ghost when you come back to
[54:33] earth you're going to find a pile of
[54:35] bones laying right here God give him and
[54:38] God give him the Holy Ghost see you got
[54:40] to get determined that's right get ready
[54:43] take over God said so let's go take over
[54:46] amen all right I'm going to I'm going to
[54:49] stop right there and pick up again here
[54:51] but uh the words that we want to some of
[54:52] the words that we want to look at as we
[54:54] talk about what causes you to have grit
[54:57] amen one of those words would be of
[54:59] course the one of the first things I
[55:01] begin to think about it would be
[55:04] perseverance ain't that right
[55:07] perseverance it takes perseverance is
[55:10] grit in another form ain't that right
[55:16] persistence amen
[55:19] persistence amen that's another word
[55:22] patience would be another one how many
[55:24] knows that you got to those uh those who
[55:27] through patience isin that right
[55:29] obtained the
[55:31] promises patience is also a form of grit
[55:35] because it's sometimes hard to be
[55:37] patient isn't it no it's hard but you
[55:40] just got to be patient you got to make
[55:43] yourself be
[55:45] patient
[55:48] amen amen another one is
[55:51] courage courage gives you
[55:54] grit amen
[55:57] I looked up what grit meant and it put
[56:00] it this way he
[56:01] said
[56:03] um it says
[56:05] courage and
[56:08] resolve strength of
[56:15] character how many know we're living in
[56:18] an age that has no
[56:21] grit we're living in an hour when people
[56:24] have no backb
[56:27] I think it was brother bam says give me
[56:29] a John Henry a Patrick Henry and and a
[56:32] Abraham Lincoln give me a George
[56:33] Washington give me somebody that has
[56:35] some
[56:36] backbone politicians is like he said you
[56:39] know what we'll just give the people
[56:40] whatever they want give me somebody
[56:42] that'll stand for something somebody
[56:45] that'll have principes somebody that has
[56:48] character those folks aren't asham to
[56:51] tell you what they think about their
[56:55] absolute terrible ideas and terrible
[56:58] thoughts and yet sometime we're afraid
[57:01] to say anything wrong but they been by
[57:04] grit and backbone tells you no I think
[57:07] that you are
[57:11] wrong hello that's right to to tell the
[57:15] truth takes
[57:17] grit
[57:19] amen strength we think of it a lot of
[57:22] times am mean as strength grit strong or

[1:46:08] Bible scriptures amen of people who were
[1:46:12] persistent who were
[1:46:15] perseverant amen so we see in Hebrews
[1:46:18] 11:6 it says that you've got to he
[1:46:21] reward he's a rewarder of those those
[1:46:23] that
[1:46:24] diligently seek Him isn't that right
[1:46:27] Amen in Luke
[1:46:29] 18 Luke 18 1-8 and he spake a parable
[1:46:33] unto them to this
[1:46:36] end he says that men ought always to
[1:46:40] pray and not faint how many believes in
[1:46:44] prayer oh yeah I believe it saying there
[1:46:49] was a in a city a judge which feared not
[1:46:52] God neither regarded man and there was a
[1:46:55] widow in that City and she came unto him
[1:46:58] saying avenge me of mine adversaries and
[1:47:00] he would not for a while but afterwards
[1:47:02] he said within himself do I fear not God
[1:47:05] nor regard man yet because this W woman
[1:47:08] Widow troubleth me I will avenge her at
[1:47:11] least by her
[1:47:13] continual coming she weary me and the
[1:47:17] Lord said hear what the unjust judge
[1:47:20] said and shall not God avenge his own
[1:47:23] elect which cry day and night unto him
[1:47:26] though he bear long with them I tell you
[1:47:28] that he will avenge them speedily
[1:47:31] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:47:33] shall he find faith on the earth what
[1:47:36] was it this was an example of
[1:47:39] perseverance with that woman she would
[1:47:41] not leave him
[1:47:43] alone and he said teach him to pray amen
[1:47:46] and keep praying amen if you don't get
[1:47:48] it keep praying believing keep knocking
[1:47:50] until God says you know what I really
[1:47:53] believe he believes yes God says you
[1:47:55] know that unjust judge he gave it to her
[1:47:58] isn't God much more going to give you
[1:48:00] what you asked
[1:48:02] for amen but have a little per
[1:48:05] perseverance about you Matthew
[1:48:09] 15 Matthew
[1:48:15] 1521 then Jesus went then and departed
[1:48:18] into the coast of Ty and siden and
[1:48:20] behold a woman of Canaan came out
[1:48:23] of the same coast and Cried unto
[1:48:27] him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou
[1:48:31] son of David my daughter is grievously
[1:48:33] vexed with the devil but he answered her
[1:48:36] not a word and his disciples came and
[1:48:38] besought him saying send her away for
[1:48:41] she crith after
[1:48:43] us ain't that something here a woman ask
[1:48:47] something of him ask mercy and he didn't
[1:48:49] even talk to her brother Braham says man
[1:48:52] many
[1:48:55] Pentecostals would have really got an
[1:48:59] attitude he know doesn't he know I have
[1:49:01] a PhD who does he think he
[1:49:04] is and I'm just going to say this
[1:49:06] because it comes to my mind I believe
[1:49:08] that was the attitude a lot of those
[1:49:12] Pentecostal Pentecostals had to's
[1:49:15] brother brandom well who's
[1:49:18] he who's he to tell us that if we have a
[1:49:20] PhD it just means that we're that far
[1:49:23] much further away from God who is he huh
[1:49:27] when he corrects him and so forth when
[1:49:28] he does all that they thought they were
[1:49:30] you know because their attitude TS the
[1:49:33] prophet was towards Christ amen because
[1:49:35] God was with him chres after but he
[1:49:38] answered and listened but he answered
[1:49:40] and said I am not sent unto the lost but
[1:49:43] the lost sheep of the House of Israel
[1:49:45] then came she and worshiped him and
[1:49:47] saying Lord help me and he answered and
[1:49:50] said it is not meat to take the
[1:49:52] children's bread and to cast it to
[1:49:58] dogs call me a
[1:50:03] dog cuz Gentiles were considered dogs
[1:50:05] isn't that
[1:50:06] right and she said that's the truth
[1:50:10] that's right this is where brother bam
[1:50:13] always said you know he says any anybody
[1:50:15] that's got the right spirit always
[1:50:16] acknowledged that what Jesus said is the
[1:50:18] truth she acknowledged that's the truth
[1:50:21] Lord
[1:50:23] yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall
[1:50:26] from the master's
[1:50:28] table amen and Jesus answered and said
[1:50:32] unto her oh woman great is thy faith be
[1:50:35] it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her
[1:50:39] daughter was made whole from that very
[1:50:43] houren
[1:50:47] [Applause]
[1:50:57] amen praise the
[1:51:00] Lord I don't see my scripture down on
[1:51:02] the other one so I'll just
[1:51:05] re refer to her the woman with the blood
[1:51:09] issue ain't that right and there was a
[1:51:12] lot of people around her and there was a
[1:51:15] big press what they call and she had a
[1:51:17] blood issue couldn't get healed no
[1:51:20] doctors could help her spent all money
[1:51:23] to try to get
[1:51:24] better woo how many know when you get to
[1:51:26] your Wit's End that's a good time to
[1:51:28] come to the Lord see Here I Am Lord and
[1:51:33] this woman did Jesus didn't touch her
[1:51:36] hello he didn't do like with this woman
[1:51:38] this woman come up there and she said in
[1:51:40] her heart if I can just touch the ham of
[1:51:44] His Garment and she pushed her way
[1:51:46] through kind of like that Mexican woman
[1:51:48] had a dead baby Amen brother bam says
[1:51:50] the deacons man they couldn't keep her
[1:51:52] out she would climb over him she'd try
[1:51:54] to get under him but she was going to
[1:51:56] get to the
[1:51:57] prophet cuz she knew that God was with
[1:51:59] him I like saying that don't you God was
[1:52:03] with our
[1:52:04] Prophet everywhere he
[1:52:06] went and she made her way through
[1:52:09] finally brother bam says to us you one
[1:52:11] of y'all go down there and pray for her
[1:52:13] she doesn't know who I am just go pray
[1:52:14] for her whatever you know and and and
[1:52:16] they were about to go pray for whatever
[1:52:18] and all of a sudden he got the vision
[1:52:20] Vision broke that that baby was alive
[1:52:22] and never right they said Hold on hold
[1:52:24] on Brothers bring her here prayed for
[1:52:26] her and that baby come out of come from
[1:52:28] the dead rose up again they went back
[1:52:31] back to the doctor the next day and got
[1:52:32] a statement from the doctor doctor had
[1:52:35] wrote up a death certificate he had
[1:52:37] absolutely declared it dead brought that
[1:52:40] baby back and said he was alive but she
[1:52:43] was determined just like this woman I'm
[1:52:45] going to Touch the Hem of His Garment

[1:52:48] matter if you really need to touch him

[1:52:53] the ham of His Garment and you'll be
[1:52:55] healed of whatever you have need
[1:52:57] of it's just important to get into his
[1:53:00] presence if I could just Touch the Hem
[1:53:03] of His Garment
[1:53:05] amen praise the Lord I believe that's
[1:53:08] what we're doing this
[1:53:10] morning from glory to glory he's
[1:53:12] changing me his likeness and image to
[1:53:15] perfecting
[1:53:17] me much on faith and what it does but
[1:53:21] let's conclude this morning with talking
[1:53:23] about the aspect of love and theg grit
[1:53:28] that comes with having the love of God
[1:53:31] in your
[1:53:33] heart Nothing Compares
[1:53:38] nothing because we know that Jesus was
[1:53:42] the master of
[1:53:46] grit brother BR well not brother BR but
[1:53:49] the Bible says you know that when Jesus
[1:53:51] spoke he spoke as one with
[1:53:54] authority how many knows he had
[1:53:55] Authority he knew where he stood he
[1:53:58] would look at those phes and scribes
[1:54:01] right in the face and tell them the
[1:54:04] truth huh would you tell a lgp person
[1:54:08] the truth would you tell your somebody
[1:54:11] that you know the truth if they you know
[1:54:13] they were way off in left
[1:54:15] field huh or would you just kind of keep
[1:54:18] quiet sometimes butam even talked about
[1:54:21] it he says sometimes we even as
[1:54:22] preachers you got to be careful well I
[1:54:24] better hold back to don't you Hold Back
[1:54:26] didn't he say if a preacher will hold
[1:54:28] back on anybody because the tithe they
[1:54:30] pay or this that or the other he says he
[1:54:32] ain't fit to be up
[1:54:34] there got to preach what the Holy Ghost
[1:54:37] tells you to
[1:54:39] preach amen Jesus was the
[1:54:45] master we all know the Garden of
[1:54:47] Gethsemane was his biggest battle
[1:54:50] biggest battle to have to go to Calvary
[1:54:53] to be mocked to be spit on to be
[1:54:56] crucified so when he was being mocked
[1:54:59] when he went up there to captured
[1:55:01] him spit on him beat on him plucked his
[1:55:05] beard false accused
[1:55:08] him and he opened n his
[1:55:11] mouth he had more grit than anybody ever
[1:55:13] will
[1:55:15] have not only that but falsely accused
[1:55:17] buddy I'm telling you what if somebody
[1:55:19] falsely accuses you to your face and
[1:55:22] think think about Jesus knowing he had
[1:55:23] the power to change the whole
[1:55:26] thing what if you was falsely accused
[1:55:29] what if you was done that way and yet
[1:55:31] you had the power to completely change
[1:55:33] it most likely we
[1:55:39] might you'd have to have a lot of grit
[1:55:42] not
[1:55:43] to you'd have to have a lot of
[1:55:48] self-control Amen to follow the leading
[1:55:50] of the spirit on it somebody claps you
[1:55:52] upside the head does you wrong to be
[1:55:54] able to go pray for him takes
[1:55:57] grit that's much harder to do a lot of
[1:55:59] times than it is Amen to get revenge
[1:56:02] revenge is
[1:56:04] easy but to commit it to God that's hard
[1:56:07] false accused and then go out there and
[1:56:09] be crucified and to
[1:56:12] die is that right that took a lot for
[1:56:16] God to do but he had so much love for
[1:56:19] you you and you You
[1:56:23] Caroline you Zoe Elena all of you he has
[1:56:27] so much love for
[1:56:32] you he said there ain't no way I'm
[1:56:35] calling for seven Legions of angels and
[1:56:39] changing
[1:56:40] this no
[1:56:42] way even when they said if you're Christ
[1:56:45] you say you God come down off the cross
[1:56:49] and we'll believe you
[1:56:52] he had grit you know what he said
[1:56:55] Woody you have never told me what to do
[1:56:58] and you're not going to start now
[1:57:00] telling me what to
[1:57:02] do that right didn't even the devil when
[1:57:05] he tempted he said says if you be God
[1:57:07] turned his uh swn into bread if you're
[1:57:10] going to one jump off the temple the
[1:57:13] angels will bear thee up get thee behind
[1:57:16] me you're not my master I don't clown
[1:57:19] for you
[1:57:23] amen why he had
[1:57:25] grit he wasn't going to give in to their
[1:57:31] wishes that would have been exactly what
[1:57:33] the devil would have wanted for him to
[1:57:35] come down off the cross and not die for
[1:57:38] us but Jesus knew I'll tell you what
[1:57:41] I'll do I like this I'll tell you what
[1:57:44] I'll do I'm gonna go ahead and be
[1:57:47] crucified I'm going to die on the cross
[1:57:50] and I'm going to release my
[1:57:52] and it ain't going to be just me anymore
[1:57:56] it's going to be thousands and millions
[1:57:59] of men defeating
[1:58:05] you lry stand to your feet this morning
[1:58:08] give him praise thank you Jesus for
[1:58:10] dying for me thank you for
[1:58:13] Calvary thank you Lord Jesus to Heaven
[1:58:16] grit and not coming off the cross for
[1:58:19] loving me thank you Lord for loving me
[1:58:22] like that woman baby safire was her
[1:58:25] house was on fire there was a baby
[1:58:27] upstairs the fire department would not
[1:58:29] go
[1:58:30] in in their clothes and in their
[1:58:32] protection she grabbed the blanket and
[1:58:35] ran up the stairs grabbed that baby
[1:58:38] wrapped it in that blanket and got burnt
[1:58:40] all the way down and said I got my

[2:05:45] promise is still the same amen we're so

[2:06:28] thanking you Lord for pricking our
[2:06:31] sister's Heart Lord and giving her
[2:06:34] courage and saying in her heart I want
[2:06:37] to serve you Lord above everything Lord
[2:06:40] you are first in my life before anything
[2:06:43] or anybody else and Lord I pray God that
[2:06:46] you will grant her her heart's desire of

[2:06:51] Jesus
[2:06:52] and communion with you Lord and that

[2:06:57] that she'll be a good example for those
[2:06:59] around her Lord Jesus of what a
[2:07:01] Christian is Lord father forgive her of
[2:07:04] all of her sins Lord Jesus as she
[2:07:06] repents and as she's baptized in the
[2:07:08] name of Jesus Christ we believe that the
[2:07:11] promise is as good today as it ever was
[2:07:13] until that last one comes in and your
[2:07:16] Prophet taught us that when that last
[2:07:18] one is baptized Mercy will be over and
[2:07:22] the Rapture would take place father and
[2:07:24] I believe God that if she is Lord what
[2:07:26] an exciting moment it would be for all
[2:07:28] of us Lord Lord and we just pray God
[2:07:31] that as we baptize her in Jesus name
[2:07:33] that you'll fill her completely full
[2:07:35] with the Holy Spirit in Jesus name
[2:07:38] Caroline I now baptize you in the name
[2:07:40] of Jesus Christ
