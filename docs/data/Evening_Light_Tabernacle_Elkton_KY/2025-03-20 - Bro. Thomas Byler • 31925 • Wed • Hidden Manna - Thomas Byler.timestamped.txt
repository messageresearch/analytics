[12:21] evening. Oh, crossing the calm sea with
[12:27] Jesus when the disciples were getting
[12:31] concerned.
[12:34] The wind started violently
[12:39] blowing, but he was asleep in the
[12:45] stern. Oh, does he not care that we
[12:51] perish? Well, we're helpless and we're
[12:55] so
[12:57] afraid. And Jesus arose when they called
[13:03] him and said to them, "Where is your
[13:08] faith? Because you
[13:12] prayed
[13:15] on. Because you held on with all of your
[13:20] might. Child, your
[13:24] cries have awoken.
[13:28] the

[13:44] rejoice and child. Your
[13:48] cry have
[13:51] awoken the master.
[13:57] Oh, and it hit you without any
[14:03] warning. The storm of your life had
[14:08] begun and seen no hope in the
[14:14] distance. You're frightened and nowhere
[14:18] to
[14:20] run. And by now your best soul is
[14:26] failing. And you're thinking that you'll
[14:30] surely
[14:32] drown. And you've cried out for help
[14:36] from the
[14:38] Savior. And you know you can't give up
[14:43] now because you
[14:47] prayed all night. Cuz you held on with
[14:53] all of your might. And child, your
[14:59] cry have
[15:02] awoken. The
[15:05] [Music]
[15:06] master for he
[15:10] knows your
[15:13] voice. Lift your hands. It's time to
[15:17] rejoice.
[15:18] [Music]
[15:23] Oh, have
[15:25] awoken the master because you prayed all
[15:29] night. Oh, because you
[15:33] [Music]
[15:34] prayed all
[15:36] night. Cuz you held on with all of your
[15:42] might.
[15:43] Child, your
[15:46] cries have
[15:49] awoken to the
[15:54] master. Oh, he
[15:57] knows your
[16:00] voice. Lift your hands. It's time to
[16:05] rejoice, child. Your
[16:09] cries have
[16:12] awoken the master. Child, your cries. Oh
[16:18] child, your
[16:21] cries have
[16:24] awoken the
[16:26] [Laughter]
[16:29] master. Amen. How many seen him come on
[16:32] the scene? Amen. Let's just claim it

[29:25] ago and it looks
[29:28] like there's a little bit of a storm
[29:30] coming through but hopefully it won't be
[29:32] anything major. So, if you hear thunder
[29:34] and lightning real bad, don't get too
[29:36] scared. Amen. Praise the Lord. I know
[29:39] they've got some warnings out and stuff,
[29:40] but Amen. The Lord is our protector.
[29:42] Ain't that right? Amen. So, it's good to
[29:45] be in the house of the Lord. We just

[30:23] heads. Kind heavenly father, we're so
[30:25] grateful, Lord Jesus, that we have a
[30:27] great God like you that we can come
[30:28] before you, Lord. Father, knowing Lord
[30:31] Jesus that it's the precious blood of
[30:33] Jesus Christ, God, our faith in you,
[30:35] Lord Jesus, that you are able to hear
[30:37] our voice, Lord, answer prayers, Lord
[30:40] Jesus, and you said, "Ask anything in
[30:42] your name, you would do it, Lord. And
[30:44] we're all calling before you, Lord
[30:46] Jesus, for Laura's mom, Lord, as she's
[30:48] having this surgery done tomorrow. We
[30:50] ask, God, that you would just touch her
[30:52] in a special way, Lord. Father, we just
[30:54] ask Lord come now Lord Jesus and com
[30:56] bring comfort and be with each and every
[30:59] one of the physicians and so forth,
[31:00] Lord. And Father, we just ask God also
[31:03] for Sister Parish tonight, Lord. First,
[31:05] we want to thank you, Lord, that she's
[31:07] doing a little better, God. And the
[31:09] medicine they've given her has caused
[31:11] her to be a little better, Father. And
[31:12] we're always looking for every little
[31:13] sign, thanking you for every little
[31:16] healing, Lord, that you give to our
[31:17] body. And same way with Sister Janet,
[31:20] God, having got up a little bit, Lord
[31:22] Jesus, and trying to get up and get
[31:24] around, Lord, we thank you for your
[31:25] healing power. Thank you for your word,
[31:28] Lord Jesus, that you have given us the
[31:30] assurance that we can have faith in what
[31:32] you have said, Lord. And now tonight,
[31:34] Father, as we commit this Wednesday
[31:36] night service to you, Lord, no doubt,
[31:38] but many are maybe tired, Lord Jesus,
[31:41] different things going around, Lord.
[31:43] But, Father, in it all, we come to the
[31:45] house of God to show you that we love
[31:47] you, to bring respects to you, Lord
[31:49] Jesus. That's why we prepare ourselves
[31:52] and come out, Lord, to hear what you
[31:54] have to say to us, Lord Jesus, tonight,
[31:56] God. Get me out of the way, Lord. Then
[31:59] just speak through your spirit, Father,
[32:00] the things that you once said tonight
[32:02] now. and we just commit this service to
[32:04] you. May it bring honor and glory to
[32:06] your name in Jesus' name. Amen. And
[32:10] amen. Amen. Just want to say, brother
[32:12] Brad, he came to me the other day and he
[32:14] uh kind of had a project that he had on
[32:16] his heart that he wanted me to pray
[32:17] about and think about maybe doing. Amen.
[32:21] And I think maybe I don't know if y'all
[32:23] have heard uh but we're talking about
[32:26] Amen. perhaps building a gymnasium out
[32:28] here. Amen.
[32:30] So I said he wasn't going to remodel
[32:32] this that or the other. He when he asks,
[32:34] he asks speak. So Amen. That's all
[32:36] right. Right. So anyway, but I just
[32:39] prayed about it and at first I was, you
[32:41] know, of course, you know, kind of
[32:42] reluctant and so forth, but I feel good
[32:44] about it. Amen. However, I uh want to
[32:47] have a meeting Sunday after service and
[32:49] I want all the heads of every house if
[32:51] you would, Amen. to meet us at the
[32:54] fellowship hall. Amen. And brother Brad
[32:56] will speak a little bit and I'll say a
[32:57] few words and we'll try to get the
[32:59] feeling of the people. Remember brother
[33:00] Bham said when they were trying to you
[33:02] whenever they would try to do something
[33:04] they try to get the feeling of the
[33:05] people you know right see how everybody
[33:07] feels about it and of course pray about
[33:09] it and see what the Lord what he wants.
[33:11] Amen. But it certainly would be nice to
[33:14] have something like that out there that
[33:15] way. Amen. That facility out there and
[33:18] that area out there could actually be
[33:20] used in the wintertime or no matter what
[33:22] the weather would be. Brother John
[33:23] wouldn't have to get the Tinton gym
[33:25] anymore. Amen. Which I know that you
[33:27] know, but we'll we'll go over some of
[33:29] the details. I know he's talking about
[33:30] putting a kitchen maybe in it and some
[33:31] bathrooms and things like that. So, um
[33:35] anyway, so there it is. Everybody knows
[33:37] and so uh but we want to talk to
[33:39] everybody, see what everybody's feeling
[33:41] is in is in it and most of all the
[33:43] direction of the Lord and and then go
[33:45] from there. Would that be all right? So,
[33:47] that's after service Sunday.
[33:49] Amen. Amen. Well, praise the Lord.
[33:54] Amen. You got plenty of
[33:56] time. Amen. All right. We won't try to
[33:59] keep you too long, but we just have a
[34:01] little thought on our heart. Basically,
[34:02] it's back to back to the same message we
[34:05] preached on Amen. on talking about eagle
[34:09] food. A eagle food. Amen. We want to go
[34:11] back to our basically where we started
[34:13] off at because it seems like the Lord's
[34:15] just given me a few more thoughts in
[34:17] that direction. And so, Amen. We'll just
[34:20] um let's just see what the Lord will
[34:22] have for us this evening. Amen. And see
[34:24] what see what uh God's great eagle has
[34:28] to say to us. Amen. Amen. What God's
[34:30] word has to speak to us because I
[34:32] certainly don't have anything worthwhile
[34:35] saying. Amen. But God does. His word
[34:38] does. And that's what we come to hear.
[34:40] Isn't that right? Amen. So, if you will
[34:44] Amen. We've prayed. Let's just open our
[34:46] Bibles and we'll read um kind of our
[34:50] foundation scripture. Amen. Or our
[34:53] storyline that we want to begin with in
[34:56] second or first kings. First
[35:00] Kings. We want to preach out of a
[35:02] message called Jezebel religion and also
[35:08] um spiritual food in due season because
[35:12] brother Brandham in both of those
[35:13] messages talked about how that America
[35:17] typed Israel. Okay. How many remembers
[35:20] him saying that different times that how
[35:22] that we drove back the inhabitants of
[35:24] the land and come for peace, you know,
[35:25] and to be able to serve God and all the
[35:28] things that God did and God did great
[35:29] miracles until an Ahab, ain't that
[35:32] right, rose up on a Jezebel rose up.
[35:34] Amen. all the way up to where uh you
[35:37] know he preached you know to Ahab and
[35:41] and and I'll just I'll just read the
[35:44] quote on what he said about it and what
[35:45] happened afterwards and how that we are
[35:48] typed in that. Amen. And then I would
[35:51] just want to speak Amen. First let me
[35:54] read the scriptures and then I'll give
[35:55] you my title. Amen. In first kings
[35:58] [Music]
[35:59] 17, and Elijah the Tishbite, who was of
[36:02] the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto
[36:05] Ahab, "As the Lord God of Israel liveth,
[36:08] before whom I stand, there shall not be
[36:11] due nor rain these years, but according
[36:14] to my word." And the word of the Lord
[36:16] came unto him, saying, Get thee hence,
[36:19] and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself
[36:22] in the brook Cherith, that is before
[36:25] Jordan. Now remember that scripture
[36:27] because it'll be one of the points that
[36:29] I want to get to this evening. Hide
[36:32] thyself by that brook. And it shall come
[36:35] to pass that thou shalt drink of the
[36:36] brook and for I have commanded the
[36:38] ravens to feed thee there. So he went
[36:41] and did according to the word of the
[36:42] Lord. For he went and dwelt by the brook
[36:44] the brook Cherth that is before Jordan.
[36:48] And the ravens brought him bread and
[36:49] flesh in the morning and bread and flesh
[36:52] in the evening. And he drank of the
[36:54] brook. And it came to pass after a while
[36:57] that the book brook dried up because
[37:00] there had been no rain in the land. And
[37:03] the word of the Lord came to him saying,
[37:05] "Get rise, get ye to uh Sarapath, which
[37:09] belongth to Zidon, and dwell there.
[37:11] Behold, I have commanded a widow woman."
[37:13] And also remember this widow woman
[37:15] because brother Brandham types the bride
[37:17] with this widow woman also. Amen. Amen.
[37:21] I always like to stay with the types and
[37:23] shadows that the prophet gave. Amen.
[37:25] Because I've got confidence in that.
[37:27] Amen. He also typed a little bit that we
[37:29] also Amen. go along with this uh uh I
[37:33] Elijah Amen. to this brook. Amen. This
[37:36] place where we have plenty to drink and
[37:38] plenty to eat. Amen. Arise get thee.
[37:41] Okay. Now command commanded a widow
[37:43] woman to sustain thee. And she arose and
[37:45] went to Saraph. And when he came to the
[37:49] gate of the city, behold, the widow
[37:51] woman was there gathering of sticks. And
[37:54] he called to her and said, "Fetch me, I
[37:56] pray thee, a little water in the vessel
[37:58] that I may drink." And as she was going
[38:00] to fetch it, he called to her and said,
[38:02] "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of
[38:04] bread in thine hand." And she said, "As
[38:06] the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a
[38:09] cake, but a handful of a meal in a
[38:11] barrel, and a little oil in a cruise.
[38:14] And behold, I am gathering two sticks
[38:17] that I may go in and dress it for my for
[38:20] me and my son, that we may eat it and
[38:23] die. And Elijah said unto her, "Fear
[38:26] not. Go do as thou has said, but make me
[38:29] therefore a little cake
[38:34] first." I don't know. I don't know if
[38:36] Brother Brandon caught this or if you
[38:38] caught this, but from what I understand
[38:40] here, he says, "Yeah, I want you to do
[38:42] that." In other words, I want you to
[38:43] make yourself a cake and your son. Ain't
[38:46] that right? But make me one
[38:49] first. So there must have be there's
[38:52] going to be some left over, right? Amen.
[38:54] So yeah, do that. But bring me one
[38:57] first. All right. After that, thou can
[38:59] make it for thee and thy son. For thus
[39:01] sayaith the Lord thy God of Israel, the
[39:03] barrel shall not waste, neither shall
[39:05] the cruise of oil fail until the day
[39:07] that the Lord sendeth rain upon the
[39:08] earth. Amen. May God his blessings to
[39:10] the reading of the word. We won't keep
[39:12] you seated. We won't keep you seated. We
[39:14] won't keep you standing. My Lord, now
[39:17] you see how I if I ever mess up. Now you
[39:20] know
[39:20] why. Amen. Praise the Lord. I will keep
[39:24] you seated. Praise be the Lord. Amen.
[39:29] Hallelujah. Praise the
[39:31] Lord.
[39:34] Amen. Over in the book of Revelations.
[39:38] And let me see here. Maybe I should open
[39:49] my
[39:52] Revelations
[39:53] 2 and verse 17 says, "And he
[39:57] saith, he that hath an ear, let him hear
[40:00] what the
[40:01] spirit saith unto the churches. To him
[40:03] that overcomemeth will I give to eat of
[40:06] the hidden mana and will give him a
[40:10] white stone and in the stone a new name
[40:13] written which no man knoweth saving he
[40:15] that receiveth it. Notice he said there
[40:18] that they will receive I believe brother
[40:20] Brandham said in the church age book
[40:21] that hidden revelation. Amen. Another
[40:25] scripture says in Revelations uh 10 uh
[40:29] and verse 8 after of course we read all
[40:31] of that about the ve of the voice of the
[40:33] seventh angel when he began to sound.
[40:35] Amen. The mystery of God should be
[40:37] finished as he has declared to his
[40:39] servants the prophets. And the voice
[40:41] which I heard from heaven spake to me
[40:43] again and said go and take the little
[40:44] book which is open in the hand of the
[40:47] angel which standeth upon the sea and
[40:49] upon the earth. And I went unto the
[40:51] angel. Remember John typing the bride
[40:53] now. and said unto him, "Give me the
[40:56] little book." And he said unto me, "Take
[40:59] it and eat it up.
[41:03] Take it and eat it up. It shall make thy
[41:07] bitter, thy belly bitter, and it shall
[41:10] be in thy mouth sweet as honey." And he
[41:12] took the book out of the angel's hand
[41:15] and ate it up as it was in my mouth
[41:18] sweet as honey. And as soon as I eaten
[41:20] it, my uh belly belly was bitter.
[41:24] Amen. And he said unto me, "Thou must
[41:26] prophesy
[41:27] again before many peoples and nations
[41:31] and tongues and kings." I believe
[41:33] Brother Bam said long after he's gone,
[41:35] these tapes will still live on. Amen.
[41:38] How many believes they have gone around
[41:40] the world probably many more many more
[41:42] times than when he was here upon the
[41:45] earth. Still keeping on going. Keeping
[41:47] on going and it just keeps on going.
[41:51] Amen.
[41:59] Brother Brandon makes a statement. He
[42:01] said, "Now, you remember what that dream
[42:03] that I got, the interpretation was."
[42:06] Amen. Because he had a dream. Now,
[42:08] notice here, let me see. Uh, let me go
[42:10] back just a little bit. Brother Bannon
[42:13] was trying to get some of his brothers
[42:15] in that dream to go back. Stay back.
[42:16] Don't come across that water with those
[42:18] boats. You won't make it. And so forth.
[42:21] He had that vision. and so forth and and
[42:23] but he was he was saying right now I'm
[42:25] just punching right away and if if the
[42:27] shell don't fire I'll just throw another
[42:29] one in and and and try again. Okay, I'll
[42:34] hit the object that I'm shooting at. You
[42:36] know what I mean? Uh he says there's
[42:38] something somewhere I'm leaving for
[42:40] these meetings just plunging out yonder.
[42:44] So, it sounds like brother Brandham
[42:46] didn't know just for sure exactly which
[42:47] way direction to go and what to do, but
[42:50] he was just just just doing the best he
[42:52] could. But he says, "But I don't aim to
[42:55] teach these great things that I teach
[42:58] you
[42:59] people."
[43:01] Amen. All right. You remember that
[43:03] dream? He says, "Go back and store up
[43:07] food." Go back and store up food. Now,
[43:10] where was the storehouse, the
[43:12] tabernacle?
[43:14] Where where is there anything like it in
[43:16] the country around here anywhere that
[43:19] would compare with the message that we
[43:22] have?
[43:24] Amen. Ain't that the truth? What would
[43:27] compare? Where in the world would you go
[43:30] and compare with the food that you are
[43:33] eating
[43:35] with the message that we have
[43:38] tonight? I want to just take a my feeble
[43:40] efforts, my feeble self to think about
[43:43] taking this message because as we talk
[43:45] about eagle food where the carcass is
[43:47] there, the eagles will be gathered
[43:49] together. Amen. And I thought this some
[43:51] of the things that's going to be maybe
[43:53] seem kind of scattered, but um I want to
[43:56] speak about like when you take a can a
[43:59] can of food. Amen. Especially if you're
[44:02] a diabetic or if you're have high
[44:04] cholesterol or you don't want too much
[44:06] sodium or all of that stuff and you turn
[44:09] that thing around. Ain't that right?
[44:11] Most of us probably look at the
[44:13] ingredients. We want to see how much
[44:15] cholesterol is in it. We want to see how
[44:17] much sodium's in it. We sure want to
[44:19] know how much sugar is in it, how many
[44:21] grams of sugar that you have. And and of
[44:24] course, you want if you're sight
[44:25] diabetic, you would definitely want to
[44:26] look at how many added sugars there is.
[44:30] Amen. And how much saturated fat? How
[44:33] much fat? But they got all kinds of
[44:35] stuff up in there. Ain't that right? You
[44:38] know, and that's the way kind of this
[44:40] message is. Amen. When we talk about
[44:43] eagle food tonight, we want to look a
[44:44] little bit about the look at the
[44:46] ingredients. We can't just say we got
[44:48] eagle food. Well, that's just kind of a
[44:50] broad statement. I like to go in there
[44:52] and dig into it a little bit and find
[44:53] out just what what really what is eagle
[44:56] food.
[44:59] Amen.
[45:00] Amen. So, Amen. It's it's it's
[45:04] it's more than what I can really
[45:07] express. It's greater than what I can
[45:09] express, but we'll try our best to give
[45:10] you just a glimpse of it. Would that be
[45:12] okay? But for one thing, we know that
[45:15] God had told Brother Bam to store up the
[45:18] food. Ain't that right? Store up the
[45:21] food. Somehow, he knew that we wouldn't
[45:24] need it.
[45:25] Amen. And we'll find out why. Where's
[45:28] there anything to compare with the
[45:30] message that we have? He says, "Where
[45:32] would you go to find show me its
[45:36] comparison
[45:41] anywhere?"
[45:43] Amen. Show me its comparison anywhere.
[45:47] You'll go right back into denominational
[45:49] creeds and you'll have to go right out.
[45:51] Amen. And back in away from the Lord.
[45:54] Amen. He says, "Well, one message that I
[45:57] preached here to you not long ago." He
[45:58] says to y'all, "Look, I've been
[46:00] preaching from one hour to six hours on
[46:03] one message." I mean, know the spoken
[46:06] word is the original seed. Amen. He took
[46:09] a many took about six hours on that
[46:12] message. Wow. And he says if I would
[46:16] have used one of those message, it take
[46:18] a week to take it just a little bit here
[46:20] and a little bit there. See, because
[46:23] it's been stored up here. How many
[46:26] thankful for stored up food? You and I
[46:30] have stored up food. It's on tapes.
[46:33] It'll go worldwide on the tapes where
[46:36] people in their houses. Them tapes will
[46:38] fall right into the hands of the
[46:41] predestinated of God.
[46:44] Amen. Praise the Lord. How many believe
[46:46] that he can direct that word?
[46:51] Amen. He'll direct anything just exactly
[46:54] to its course. And that's the reason
[46:56] that he sent me back to do this to star
[46:59] up food here. And he forbid me to go
[47:03] overseas. Thank you, Jesus, for starring
[47:05] up food.
[47:07] Amen. Because he knew that we wouldn't
[47:09] need it.
[47:13] Amen. Praise the
[47:15] Lord.
[47:18] Amen. Amen.
[47:20] How many knows we're living in quite a
[47:23] day at quite an hour and not
[47:27] just into 2001 and 2025 or 20? I guess
[47:33] we're in 25 now.
[47:35] Unbelievable. Ain't that right?
[47:38] 2025. How many remembers, man, everybody
[47:40] panicking the computers are going to
[47:42] shut down, man. At the year 2000 when it
[47:44] rolls out, they they won't be able to
[47:46] figure out how to put that extra zero in
[47:48] there. and you know 2020 or you know or
[47:53] 2000 even actually was about so many
[47:55] zeros man it's just going to mess
[47:57] everything up better fill that freezer
[48:01] up better get that
[48:04] generator amen but think about it 25
[48:07] years ago almost but when I want want to
[48:09] talk about first think about it in the
[48:12] early 1900s around the early 19 round
[48:16] the turn of the 19th century
[48:19] God begin to do
[48:21] something. Amen. It was going to be the
[48:24] beginning of the end. Ain't that right?
[48:28] Cuz all down through we had
[48:30] reformers. Brother Bam called Martin
[48:32] Luther, John Wesley, all them reformers.
[48:35] Not prophets, but
[48:38] reformers. Amen. And they would just
[48:40] reform, reform, reform. That's when I'm
[48:43] my you just would not believe when I
[48:45] talk to my cousin of all the different
[48:47] splits the Mish have and the Menanites
[48:49] have and all they reform a little bit
[48:51] more and they can have a gravel driveway
[48:53] they can't have a gravel driveway they
[48:54] can have lights on there the other hello
[48:57] all kinds of reforming that goes
[49:00] on there were the hour reforms around
[49:04] the turn of the 19th century when I look
[49:06] at it in my philosophy or my way of
[49:10] thinking it we have
[49:12] progressed in science in 120 years more
[49:17] than they did in 2000.
[49:22] Much more progression in a hundred years
[49:25] than in 2,000 years to my
[49:30] opinion. Isn't that right? Did you see
[49:33] him get away from the horse and buggy in
[49:34] 2000? I didn't. Did you see him build
[49:37] cars? You know, did you see him flying
[49:39] to the moon and jets and rockets? Did
[49:42] you see him with cell phones? Did you
[49:43] hear the entire almost the entire
[49:48] knowledge of the world is in your
[49:51] hands. Isn't that right? I mean, if you
[49:54] want to know anything, just Google it.
[49:56] Just right there it
[49:59] is. That's why I make that statement.
[50:01] The way that I see it, it has progressed
[50:04] drastically.
[50:06] Brother Abraham talked about the
[50:07] progression of
[50:08] it. Amen. He talked about his dad, what
[50:12] he drove and now what his son will
[50:14] drive, you know, and and on down what
[50:16] those people before us and how did even
[50:18] in uh uh science and everything, how did
[50:21] it's progressed, how did it's changed.
[50:25] Amen. the women and the men and how they
[50:28] dress. And man, they used to, you know,
[50:30] they that they let the devil come in by
[50:33] just uh letting one song get by, they
[50:36] used to monitor or restrict certain
[50:40] songs. They wouldn't let you play just
[50:41] any song.
[50:43] But when they let that one slip through
[50:45] and look at where it is today, ain't
[50:48] that right? Look at where it is
[50:51] today. That's why brother Bennett makes
[50:53] the state statement. He says, "The lid
[50:55] has come off of hell."
[50:59] The lid has come off of hell. Why?
[51:02] Because people opened themselves up to
[51:05] it. Why do you think people tattoo
[51:07] themselves? Why is there no end to what
[51:10] people will do? They'll eye color their
[51:12] eyes. They look like a hideous demon.
[51:15] There's no end to how far people will
[51:17] go.
[51:19] Amen.
[51:23] was going to do something and he was
[51:24] going to do something different. He's
[51:26] going to do something great. He's going
[51:27] to do some a finality, a grand
[51:31] finale, so to speak.
[51:36] And that thing that we're talking about
[51:38] that he was going to do goes back to a
[51:41] very simple
[51:47] scripture and it
[51:50] hinges on Malachi
[51:52] 4. Malachi 4 is what God was going to
[51:55] do.
[51:57] Behold, the day cometh that shall burn
[51:59] as an oven, and all the proud, and all
[52:01] that do wickedly shall be stubble at the
[52:04] day that cometh that shall burn them up,
[52:06] sayeth the Lord of hosts. It shall leave
[52:09] them neither root nor
[52:12] branch. Amen. But I love them
[52:16] butts, don't you? But unto you that fear
[52:20] my name, shall a son of righteousness
[52:22] arise with healing in his wings.
[52:26] How many of man I'm here to tell
[52:31] you I would almost say that the healing
[52:34] campaigns were of a biblical proportion.
[52:37] However, I can't really say that they
[52:40] were more than biblical
[52:43] proportions. Didn't brother Bam say he
[52:45] had more success in my ministry than he
[52:47] did in his
[52:49] own. Why? Because he just had a few
[52:51] years. What? Three and a half years.
[52:53] Brother Brandham had 15 to 18 years, if
[52:56] not more than that. Well, it was more
[52:58] than that because we only have the tapes
[53:00] from 48 to 65, but he was preaching long
[53:03] before that. Ain't that right? More
[53:07] success, greater healing
[53:09] campaigns,
[53:12] 500,000 at a time, 30,000 healings and
[53:16] so forth or conversions. And oh my look
[53:20] at the mass that it
[53:25] was.
[53:27] Amen. You'd have Yeah. rise with uh he
[53:31] leing his wing and ye shall grow go
[53:33] forth and grow up as calves of the
[53:36] stall. You shall tread down the wicked
[53:39] for the day that shall they shall be
[53:41] ashes under the souls of your feet. And
[53:43] the day that I shall do this, sayith the
[53:45] Lord. Verse five. Behold, I will send
[53:48] you Elijah to prophet before the coming
[53:50] of the great and dreadful day of the
[53:52] Lord. And he shall turn the hearts of
[53:54] the fathers to the children, and the
[53:56] hearts of the children to the fathers,
[53:57] least I come and smite the earth with a
[54:01] curse. What was the first curse that God
[54:04] put upon Adam? That thou shalt surely
[54:07] die. You're going to die. Death. He
[54:09] brought death upon
[54:11] humanity. The final curse that's to be
[54:13] lifted is death. Death will be gone.
[54:18] Amen. But he wouldn't come and he'd
[54:20] smite the earth with a curse if it
[54:23] wasn't for Malachi 4. So how many
[54:25] believe that if you're not in Malachi 4,
[54:28] you'll be under that curse?
[54:31] My very very
[54:33] important. That's a that's what God was
[54:36] going to do. That was God's secret
[54:38] weapon that he was going to
[54:40] bring. And I talked about the reformers
[54:43] because this here is not going to be
[54:45] reformer. This prophet did not come to
[54:48] just bring another
[54:50] form. No, this prophet came to restore
[54:54] to take us back to the original.
[54:58] That's why he preached the spoken word.
[55:00] It was so important to brother Bam. The
[55:02] spoken word is the original
[55:06] seed. Amen. The original seed will bring
[55:09] forth another Acts 2:38 church.
[55:13] It has to be back to book of Acts, back
[55:16] to the faith of the fathers, back to
[55:18] what they had. He was going to bring
[55:21] restoration,
[55:23] not reformation.
[55:29] Glory.
[55:31] Amen. Now, how many knows that those
[55:34] tapes, those books, this message is
[55:38] eagle food?
[55:43] You are feeding on eagle
[55:46] food, not feeding on man-made. You're
[55:48] feeding on the body word of the son of
[55:51] man. Make sure that you have properly
[55:53] eaten of this food. To give you strength
[55:56] to fly above the denominational says to
[55:59] fly above it all, you have to eat this
[56:02] food.
[56:08] Boy, I feel like staying all night right
[56:10] about now.
[56:13] Because we sure could.
[56:16] We sure
[56:17] could. Amen. Praise the
[56:24] Lord. Praise the Lord. Not reformers
[56:28] anymore, but now it's restoration.
[56:34] back to what we were supposed to
[56:37] have.
[56:39] Amen. All right, let's see where we want
[56:42] to
[56:43] go. I want to
[56:46] start I think I'll start with
[56:49] uh brother
[56:51] Brandham when he preached on Jezebel
[56:54] religion. He was talking about how that
[56:57] Elijah went and attacked the White
[56:58] House, so to speak. Isn't that right? He
[57:01] attacked Ahab. Said, "Not even, not even
[57:04] Dude's going to fall from heaven. This
[57:06] place is cursed. Not even dude's going
[57:08] to fall until I call for it." He
[57:10] condemned Jezebel, condemned
[57:13] Ahab. And he said before this, brother
[57:16] Bam said that this story of first kings
[57:20] 17 is a type of America and you and I.
[57:25] He put us in that scenario that this
[57:28] Elijah of this day and he was attacking
[57:31] Jezebel. He was talking about the black
[57:33] people and how they voted Democrat when
[57:35] the blood of Abraham Lincoln was a
[57:37] republic. Oh, he condemned him for it.
[57:41] Isn't that right? Said Abraham being a
[57:43] Republican. Amen. He died for you. And
[57:45] yet you go to the other side. You inv
[57:47] you you invite you you you uh voted for
[57:50] Kennedy and you sold your birth rights
[57:53] as an
[57:54] American. Isn't that
[57:56] right? And he attacked him. He of course
[57:59] not just that but brother Ben knows he
[58:00] come and he corrected whenever when this
[58:03] prophet come on the scene. He be to
[58:05] straighten things up. He began to Amen.
[58:07] give us some real food that we could
[58:10] eat cuz we was that eagle in the chicken
[58:13] yard and that food just didn't taste
[58:16] right. It just doesn't seem right. Then
[58:19] all you got to do is put your name on
[58:20] the book. Well, just be a good boy and
[58:23] follow and do what the church says.
[58:25] There's got to be something more.
[58:28] But that final attack that he did,
[58:30] Brother Bam says he made a final attack
[58:33] on Amen. on the White
[58:37] House. Amen. John the Baptist, remember,
[58:39] he had went up there to the king and
[58:41] said, "It's not right for her to have
[58:43] for you to have her." And he caused him
[58:45] his head and so forth.
[58:49] Amen. So then he says, "Then what
[58:51] happened after that?" He says, "Listen,
[58:53] after that attack, his voice became
[58:55] quiet. Nobody heard of him no more. God
[58:58] called him off the sea,
[59:01] said, "Elijah, you've done made your
[59:03] message known to all of Israel. Now come
[59:05] up here to the wilderness. Get away from
[59:07] them. Separate yourself cuz I'm going to
[59:09] do
[59:10] something. I'm going to show them what
[59:12] it is to turn my message down." And what
[59:15] said in war, famine, and
[59:20] starvation. Amen. So we find after the
[59:23] brother Brandham after the message of
[59:24] this hour when he preached those
[59:26] denominations and they rejected him in
[59:29] 1963 ain't that right didn't even have a
[59:32] place to preach
[59:33] anymore I'll read you a quote what he
[59:36] said about him declared them
[59:39] dead
[59:41] amen see until
[59:43] then they still had life in them God
[59:46] still deal with them but when they
[59:47] reject Christ uh God don't bless that
[59:50] anymore Four, what set in? Death.
[59:53] Spiritual death set in.
[59:56] Amen. And people went into a
[59:59] famine. Brother Bam said, "What is that
[1:00:02] famine? It's not a natural food. Not a
[1:00:03] famine for natural food, but it's a
[1:00:05] famine for hearing thus sayeth the Lord
[1:00:07] or hearing the word of the Lord."
[1:00:11] Amen. What is it you and I feast upon? I
[1:00:13] don't know about you, but I don't feast
[1:00:15] on, well, you better be good and go to
[1:00:16] church. I feast on thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:00:20] That's what my food is. It's thus sayith
[1:00:22] the Lord or I keep
[1:00:24] [Applause]
[1:00:27] still.
[1:00:31] Amen. Praise be to
[1:00:35] God.
[1:00:37] Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm getting the
[1:00:39] hang of this, Brother Brad. Even learn
[1:00:41] how to now. Praise the Lord. All right.
[1:00:46] God called him off the scene. They turn
[1:00:48] my message and look what happened.
[1:00:51] Famine. A famine set
[1:00:54] in. Hallelujah. Now notice, watch what's
[1:00:58] going to follow. There was a famine. And
[1:00:59] there will be a sam famine. Not for
[1:01:01] bread, but for hearing the word of the
[1:01:03] Lord. Amen. All the churches will
[1:01:05] socialize and go right into it. Notice
[1:01:08] what did Elijah do? He found him a
[1:01:10] hidden spring way up in the mountain
[1:01:11] where he got some water of life, divine
[1:01:14] revelations from God. As he's sitting
[1:01:16] there under the power of God, the
[1:01:19] revelations begin and uh being a little
[1:01:22] hidden spring while all the rest of
[1:01:25] them, let me see if I've got this on the
[1:01:27] next
[1:01:33] one. While all the rest of them was
[1:01:36] famishing, he was eating good.
[1:01:42] How many glad to be eating good?
[1:01:45] That's right. There's no reason for you
[1:01:47] and I to be famished.
[1:01:52] No reason for you and I to be hungry.
[1:01:59] Praise the Lord. My my eagle food. See,
[1:02:03] when God sends forth a message and tells
[1:02:05] the people and they don't receive it,
[1:02:08] then he withdraws his servants and send
[1:02:10] sends them plagues and famine and
[1:02:12] deaths. Spiritually speaking now you
[1:02:15] watch for a depression brother. You
[1:02:17] think you see something, you just wait a
[1:02:19] minute and you just wait a while. You
[1:02:21] haven't seen
[1:02:24] nothing. Amen. How about a spiritual
[1:02:26] depression? He did talk about a natural
[1:02:29] depression, but a spiritual death. Women
[1:02:32] up here in the pulpit with short hair,
[1:02:34] big old lips bulging out and look like a
[1:02:36] Jezebel preaching the word. Now that's
[1:02:39] some real famishing right there.
[1:02:43] That's exactly right. That's a pitiful
[1:02:46] shape. Spiritual death that set in and
[1:02:50] people fall for that.
[1:02:53] But how many knows whenever the church
[1:02:55] world, Amen, when they rejected the
[1:02:57] message of the hour, God pulled him
[1:02:59] away. And I'm here to tell you, if you
[1:03:02] ever truly hear the word of God, they
[1:03:04] won't want you in their church.
[1:03:08] No, you'll have to be put out somewhere,
[1:03:10] too. You'll have to go and have God feed
[1:03:12] you. How many glad for that?
[1:03:16] Amen.
[1:03:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:21] You haven't seen nothing. You think
[1:03:22] you're dying for a good spiritual
[1:03:24] revival. You wait till after a bit. You
[1:03:26] just wait. You'll long and cry to hear
[1:03:28] the word of the Lord. There'll be a
[1:03:31] famine in the last days, said the
[1:03:32] prophet. Not for bread and water alone,
[1:03:34] but for the hearing of the word of God.
[1:03:36] But that voice will be quiet in the
[1:03:38] wilderness, hid away somewhere. Praise
[1:03:40] the
[1:03:41] Lord.
[1:03:43] Listen. Then he was there and he was
[1:03:45] sustained. But after that one day, God
[1:03:49] called him out again. He said, "Listen
[1:03:50] now close. Don't get angry with me. I am
[1:03:53] say he says, thus sayith the Lord." When
[1:03:55] he came out, what did he do? He went to
[1:03:58] he sent him to a widow woman. Isn't that
[1:04:02] right? She once had a man power over her
[1:04:06] head, but it took death to set her free
[1:04:09] so she could believe the prophet's word.
[1:04:12] Do you notice
[1:04:14] that? Amen. How many believes that
[1:04:17] that's the way it was with you and
[1:04:20] I? Let me see if I can find it.
[1:04:28] invisible union. I believe in 1965 and
[1:04:30] 11, just about a month before he went
[1:04:32] off the scene. He says it this way.
[1:04:36] Notice the anointed word of this day,
[1:04:38] his day of which you are part of by
[1:04:41] predestination. You immediately knew
[1:04:44] when you heard that, you knew right
[1:04:46] quick he was an eagle. You realized that
[1:04:48] you wasn't a denominational chicken to
[1:04:50] begin with. You know there was something
[1:04:52] wrong there. Something wrong. Amen. How
[1:04:56] many know that most of the time people
[1:04:58] coming out of churches that's what they
[1:04:59] realize. Hey, there's something wrong
[1:05:01] about this. There's something not right
[1:05:03] about this.
[1:05:05] And why? If you're ego, you're not
[1:05:07] comfortable being in a place where
[1:05:09] something just isn't right.
[1:05:14] Amen. There was something
[1:05:17] wrong. Amen. Listen. Your first husband
[1:05:21] that you were married to the world.
[1:05:27] Amen. Is that even the scripture I'm
[1:05:29] really looking for? I think it
[1:05:33] is. But he was talking about that you've
[1:05:35] got to be dead. How many remembers you
[1:05:36] got to be said? You got to be dead to
[1:05:38] that first husband. Now, the anointed
[1:05:40] bridegroom when we ordained you, he
[1:05:42] washed you by the washing of the word.
[1:05:44] He says, brother Bram says by the
[1:05:45] church. No, that don't sound right. You
[1:05:47] might find that in the almanac, but not
[1:05:49] in God's Bible. By the washing of the
[1:05:51] water, by the word, you are standing
[1:05:53] completely justified as though you never
[1:05:55] did it at the beginning. So, we see here
[1:05:58] that in order for you to be first, you
[1:06:02] have to become a widow. In other words,
[1:06:05] put out. That husband, that old church
[1:06:08] has to be dead. You've got to die to
[1:06:11] that thing. It just comes to mind,
[1:06:13] Brother Bapt says, you can't belong to a
[1:06:15] man-made denominational system and be
[1:06:17] the bride of Jesus Christ at the same
[1:06:19] time. If you do, you shall be called an
[1:06:22] adulteress.
[1:06:23] That's exactly right. Amen. So, you got
[1:06:26] to come out of that thing.
[1:06:28] He believes that there's a coming out.
[1:06:30] I'm glad I came out. Amen. Because you
[1:06:32] can't you can't those denominations
[1:06:35] can't eat this thing. They can't feed on
[1:06:37] what you're feeding on. They can't
[1:06:39] receive what you're receiving. Amen.
[1:06:45] Amen.
[1:06:48] Praise the Lord. Now, we're going to
[1:06:50] come to that point again in a minute.
[1:06:52] But if you'll notice, she turned and she
[1:06:55] said, "As the Lord liveth, I don't have
[1:06:56] nothing but just
[1:06:59] enough." And when she was willing to
[1:07:01] give, many I've heard many preachers
[1:07:03] preach on this. It's a very good point.
[1:07:05] when she was willing to give what she
[1:07:07] did have to the support of the word,
[1:07:10] then God fed
[1:07:12] her. Remember, when you're down to your
[1:07:14] last meal or you feel like you can't go
[1:07:16] any further or you're worthless, just
[1:07:19] about dead. Well, just give the little
[1:07:21] bit of strength that you have to believe
[1:07:24] the word and God will lift you up. God
[1:07:26] will sustain you.
[1:07:29] That's where she was committed to
[1:07:32] completely to God. And guess what? God
[1:07:35] will sustain you, but you got to give it
[1:07:38] to
[1:07:39] him. You got to give your to
[1:07:43] him. So he says it this way, support of
[1:07:46] the word God fed her. And if you're
[1:07:48] willing to give what spirit you do have,
[1:07:51] what spirit did God has given you to
[1:07:52] support the word, then God will keep you
[1:07:54] alive. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Do
[1:07:56] you see that, church? Don't think I'm
[1:07:58] beside myself. I'm not. But what have
[1:08:00] you got? What little you do believe in
[1:08:03] God? with a little faith that you do
[1:08:04] have, place it in the
[1:08:07] word. When the rest of the world was
[1:08:10] languishing and dying in hunger, her and
[1:08:14] her children and her household all ate
[1:08:18] three good meals a day. Divine
[1:08:21] revelation on the word. Oh, I hope you
[1:08:24] see it,
[1:08:25] friends. Hallelujah. What went on? He
[1:08:27] stayed there until the famine was over,
[1:08:29] leaving with this woman, the church that
[1:08:32] received him and believed his
[1:08:34] word. Amen. How many believe that?
[1:08:37] That's exactly right. As long as we stay
[1:08:39] with the message of the hour, you will
[1:08:42] stay
[1:08:43] alive until this famine is
[1:08:47] over. Until this drought is
[1:08:51] over, you can hop and skip and jump.
[1:08:53] Amen. Because I'm here to tell you, a
[1:08:55] skinny, dried up, weak person that
[1:08:58] hadn't ate, they ain't going to be too
[1:09:00] happy. But you can be so full of the
[1:09:02] vitamins of
[1:09:03] God. You You can have joy unspeakable
[1:09:06] and full of
[1:09:09] glory. Everybody out on the streets is
[1:09:12] starving to death. They got tattoos and
[1:09:14] ear wings. Amen. Spiritually, if you
[1:09:16] would see them, they would just be a
[1:09:18] little old skeleton walking around like
[1:09:20] this. Rings in their nose and ears and
[1:09:23] everything. But here you are. You come
[1:09:24] out. Amen. And you're Hallelujah. Glory
[1:09:27] to God. You've got full of meat. Amen.
[1:09:29] You got full of bone. You got plenty of
[1:09:31] strength. That's what you look like.
[1:09:34] Why? Because you've been eating on eagle
[1:09:37] food. You've been eating on the right
[1:09:38] food on the hidden mana.
[1:09:48] Amen.
[1:09:52] Amen. Notice he says Elijah during this
[1:09:56] time had a secret place that God had
[1:09:58] ordained for him to go
[1:10:00] to. Notice God provided a secret place
[1:10:04] for Elijah to be fed all the time during
[1:10:06] the drought where his food was provided
[1:10:10] day by day.
[1:10:14] Amen. This supply I like this. He didn't
[1:10:17] need to wonder if God if he's going to
[1:10:19] have anything
[1:10:20] tomorrow. Amen.
[1:10:22] Wonder if the supply is going to run
[1:10:26] out. I've been preaching for to y'all
[1:10:29] for 33
[1:10:31] years over and over again
[1:10:34] sometimes. Hello. And sometimes I think,
[1:10:37] what am I going to preach on next,
[1:10:39] Brother Brett? What am I going to preach
[1:10:41] next? Where are we going to go? But you
[1:10:44] know, I find day by day, you ain't got
[1:10:48] to worry about it running out.
[1:10:50] You ain't got to worry about the supply
[1:10:52] rolling out. Why? Because we're drinking
[1:10:54] from an inexhaustable fountain.
[1:10:59] How many believe it? You ain't never got
[1:11:01] to worry about the supply running out.
[1:11:04] Amen. Now God gives me fresh revelation
[1:11:06] after fresh revelation. That's why I
[1:11:08] come back for this. I says, "Oh, I never
[1:11:10] seen that before. Lord, that's good.
[1:11:13] Have some more of that." That's why you
[1:11:15] come to church on a Wednesday night to
[1:11:17] get some spiritual revelation to feed on
[1:11:20] the word to give you strength
[1:11:24] in this time of drought.
[1:11:27] People so starving hungry they don't
[1:11:29] even can't make it to church.
[1:11:33] So weak they can't make it to church.
[1:11:37] Amen. Because you've got the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:39] You can't wait for them doors to open.
[1:11:42] Amen. believe that. Why? I don't care if
[1:11:46] all you get is a slice of bread.
[1:11:48] Amen.
[1:11:50] Praise the Lord. Now look. So he says a
[1:11:54] secret
[1:11:56] place. Amen. Now notice what he says
[1:11:58] here. God said it'll never run out. God
[1:12:01] has commanded the ravens that he'll feed
[1:12:03] you. What a wonderful thing. A type of
[1:12:07] our secret place in
[1:12:10] Christ. Oh, hallelujah. I want you to
[1:12:13] understand something. That's not just
[1:12:14] necessarily in this building at all.
[1:12:16] That's when you are in the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:19] That's that secret
[1:12:20] place, that hiding place, that hidden
[1:12:24] place. They don't know anything about
[1:12:26] what you know.
[1:12:28] No, all they know is church creeds this,
[1:12:30] that, and the other. But you know what
[1:12:31] it's like to walk with God.
[1:12:36] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:40] All right. And I like that because he
[1:12:42] said it's a type of your secret
[1:12:46] place. Just stay by the fountain, the
[1:12:50] spring. Just stay by the spring and
[1:12:52] you'll have water. It'll be fresh
[1:12:57] water. How many glad that you're hit
[1:13:00] away by a spring? A spring that's
[1:13:02] bubbling up. Amen. The God said, "Amen.
[1:13:05] The water that I give you, it'll be in
[1:13:07] you. a spring of water bubbling up, so
[1:13:10] to speak, into everlasting life. Keeps
[1:13:12] on bubbling. Keeps on bubbling.
[1:13:15] If you don't get fresh revelation every
[1:13:18] week, maybe every day, you pray to God,
[1:13:21] say, "God, I need some fresh revelation.
[1:13:24] It ain't no wonder I'm so starved." No
[1:13:26] wonder. Because why? You can't just go
[1:13:28] by your food of yesterday. You need
[1:13:30] fresh revelation.
[1:13:32] Eagles feed feed on fresh mana, fresh
[1:13:37] kill.
[1:13:40] Amen. Notice that's why today that they
[1:13:43] do not believe in doing the works of God
[1:13:44] because they do not accept the message
[1:13:46] of God. How many knows they don't accept
[1:13:49] the message? How can they ever fly into
[1:13:51] the
[1:13:51] heavenlies? How can they ever believe
[1:13:54] that all things are possible to them
[1:13:55] that believe?
[1:13:58] How many knows this message take us
[1:14:00] higher than we've ever gone? This
[1:14:02] message has to produce a rapture
[1:14:07] or you're doomed.
[1:14:10] That's why I believe the message there.
[1:14:12] Brother B said rapturing faith in the
[1:14:14] earth. Even the rapture is in you
[1:14:18] when you get the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:20] Ghost. I like that kind of food. That's
[1:14:23] the kind of food that I need.
[1:14:27] That's the kind of ingredients that we
[1:14:29] have. Oh, wait till we get to the We
[1:14:30] ain't even gotten to the ingredient.
[1:14:35] Oh my. Praise the Lord. But just think,
[1:14:39] you've got to believe it. You first have
[1:14:40] to accept it because we know that the
[1:14:43] the the womb to the soul is the mind.
[1:14:46] Every word that you take into here, you
[1:14:48] become what you eat. Every t word that
[1:14:50] you take in here is what you become.
[1:14:54] You become what you eat.
[1:14:56] Amen.
[1:14:59] Oh, I'm just not a very good Christian.
[1:15:02] I don't think God will ever give me the
[1:15:03] Holy Ghost. You'll never get it that
[1:15:04] way.
[1:15:06] Huh? You can't think those. You can't
[1:15:08] feed on negative thoughts. You have to
[1:15:10] believe on what God said. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:14] You have to believe what God said. Amen.
[1:15:18] Praise the Lord. But listen, they don't
[1:15:20] believe the message. But those who
[1:15:23] believe God's hour that we're living in,
[1:15:26] these things are hidden food.
[1:15:31] Hidden
[1:15:32] food. You're eating on hidden food.
[1:15:39] Oh, I was wondering if it was even in
[1:15:41] here if I was on the right quote, but I
[1:15:43] am. He says, "Listen, hidden food, just
[1:15:46] thing God has so hid it from the eyes of
[1:15:50] the wise and prudent, right? And
[1:15:52] revealed it to babes such as learned, so
[1:15:54] hid it that they look right at it and
[1:15:57] don't see it."
[1:15:59] You know, when somebody's blind and God
[1:16:01] has them to open their eyes, you can try
[1:16:03] to tell them the message. You can try to
[1:16:05] tell them the word of God, but they just
[1:16:07] can't see it.
[1:16:09] They can look right at it and still not
[1:16:11] see it.
[1:16:13] Aren't you glad that you can see it?
[1:16:15] Blessed are your eyes because they see
[1:16:19] and because they see they have liberated
[1:16:21] you. They set you free.
[1:16:28] Everything is hinged on believing the
[1:16:32] word of God, believing God's prophet.
[1:16:36] God was going to do something he ain't
[1:16:38] never done before.
[1:16:40] He was going to take a
[1:16:43] selfie. God was going to take a selfie.
[1:16:46] I thought about this
[1:16:48] today. And there it is with with his
[1:16:52] prophet.
[1:16:53] God took a
[1:16:55] [Applause]
[1:16:57] selfie. Hey, he took a lot of other
[1:16:59] pictures. God says, "I'll only develop
[1:17:02] that one." Amen. And the angel let that
[1:17:04] go through. He says, "That's my picture.
[1:17:07] That's a picture of me with my prophet.
[1:17:11] Amen. Even George J. Lacip says that you
[1:17:13] know it's a supernatural lens. I mean it
[1:17:16] struck the lens. It was absolutely
[1:17:18] supernatural,
[1:17:20] the pillar of fire.
[1:17:24] Aren't you glad that you don't have to
[1:17:26] feed on man-made dogmas? You're feeding
[1:17:28] on thus saith the Lord. We're feeding on
[1:17:31] God's Bible. Taking it back to the
[1:17:34] original. The word that you eat turns
[1:17:37] you back to original again.
[1:17:41] Brother Brandham even in the message
[1:17:42] said God's word is breeding out that
[1:17:44] hybrid breeding out until it's
[1:17:46] completely bred out. I mean we want to
[1:17:49] be completely bred out and nothing but
[1:17:52] original. When you look at you when you
[1:17:54] look at each other you're looking at us
[1:17:56] original Christians.
[1:18:03] That's right. I'm screaming, shouting,
[1:18:05] blabbering, tongue speaking,
[1:18:06] Pentecostal, baby.
[1:18:10] Not Pentecostal in denomination, but
[1:18:12] Pentecost by experience.
[1:18:22] That's what we're feeding on. When I
[1:18:25] start to thinking about what we're
[1:18:26] feeding on, what is really in this food?
[1:18:29] What is in this food? Isn't that what we
[1:18:32] all like to ask when we eat something,
[1:18:34] what is in
[1:18:45] this? Let's look at what's in it, shall
[1:18:47] we? Let's look some
[1:18:54] more. Where'd it go? There it is. All
[1:18:58] right.
[1:18:59] That's the hidden
[1:19:02] food. Just think, God has so hid it that
[1:19:06] they can look right at it and don't see
[1:19:07] it. The same way that Elijah blinded the
[1:19:09] Syrian army. The same way God blinds the
[1:19:12] unbeliever from the true genuine food of
[1:19:16] the child, the believer. Amen. How many
[1:19:19] knows that even healing is the
[1:19:22] children's bread?
[1:19:25] Even healing, that's your bread.
[1:19:29] not meat to give the children's bread to
[1:19:31] dogs. He said, "Amen." Notice there was
[1:19:35] meal in the barrel. Every time she went
[1:19:38] after the meal, there was meal in the
[1:19:41] barrel.
[1:19:43] Ain't that what we like to come to
[1:19:45] church for? When I come to church, I
[1:19:47] like to have some church. I like to have
[1:19:49] a meal when I come to church. That's why
[1:19:52] we come because every time we want the
[1:19:54] preacher to preach.
[1:19:57] We want to hear what the word of God
[1:19:59] says. We're hungry. Oh Lord, I'm hungry
[1:20:00] and I want to be fed. Oh Lord, I'm
[1:20:02] hungry and if I'm want to be fed.
[1:20:10] Amen. So I slobber a little bit. What
[1:20:13] the brother says. Slobbering like a
[1:20:15] horse eating alalfa. Having a good time.
[1:20:19] Amen. Thankfully the front rows back far
[1:20:21] enough. We're trying not to slobber on
[1:20:24] you.
[1:20:26] Amen. Think about it. Listen. So does
[1:20:29] every time she went for it. Why meal
[1:20:32] represented Christ in the meal offering?
[1:20:34] The burrs had to be set when he in those
[1:20:38] the sticks that ground them. The burrs
[1:20:40] had to be just set right to grind every
[1:20:42] one of them. Every burr of this meal
[1:20:45] exactly the same. Showing that he is the
[1:20:47] same yesterday, today, and forever. That
[1:20:50] was the word. That's the bread of life
[1:20:52] that follows the message. Amen. That
[1:20:55] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:20:58] forever. That's what we want to eat cuz
[1:21:01] it makes him a reality to us. Amen. This
[1:21:04] is not some stale bread from Mother Day
[1:21:07] going by. This is not denominational
[1:21:09] bread of Martin Luther John Wesley.
[1:21:11] We're eating fresh bread.
[1:21:18] How many likes to eat moldy bread?
[1:21:22] I'll tell you what, when I find a loaf
[1:21:25] of bread and first two pieces is moldy,
[1:21:29] I don't go back and look for all the
[1:21:30] rest. I said, "This bag's going in the
[1:21:34] garbage. I'm not sick. I don't need
[1:21:37] penicellin."
[1:21:42] Amen. Praise the
[1:21:45] Lord. I forgot to I forgot to set this
[1:21:48] thing not to go off. Amen. So there's
[1:21:51] something I learned. All right, here we
[1:21:53] go. That's right. That he's the same
[1:21:55] yesterday, today, and forever to
[1:21:57] vindicate it the word. Amen. So is it
[1:22:00] today,
[1:22:03] friends, that the bread of life that the
[1:22:06] children eat on follows the
[1:22:10] message. Amen.
[1:22:12] Now notice he says we notice here again
[1:22:16] that the word in us if the word is in us
[1:22:21] and has come in us as it did Elijah in
[1:22:25] that day it'll do the same thing that he
[1:22:28] did he would feed on the secret things
[1:22:30] of God which is hid from the
[1:22:34] world. Amen. The spiritual food is ready
[1:22:38] and it's in season now. How many leaves?
[1:22:42] Malachi 4 food is in season now.
[1:22:48] [Applause]
[1:22:50] It's ready for you.
[1:22:53] Push play.
[1:22:55] Feed on the word.
[1:22:58] See if it doesn't change you. If you've
[1:23:00] got your heart right, your spirit right,
[1:23:02] it'll change you.
[1:23:07] All right. It'll do things for you.
[1:23:10] I wish I had time to tell you what it'll
[1:23:12] do, but we'll do as much as we can
[1:23:14] tonight. Maybe take it up Sunday again.
[1:23:17] Now, notice and each one of you have
[1:23:20] this food if you wish to have it. If you
[1:23:23] are willing to steal away from all of
[1:23:25] your unbelief at this hour, if you are
[1:23:27] ready to come into Christ, come into his
[1:23:31] promise. Hello. In other words, you're
[1:23:34] going to feed on this. If this is what
[1:23:36] you're going to feed on, remember his
[1:23:38] promises.
[1:23:39] Malachi 4. I mean, believe we're feeding
[1:23:42] on Malachi 4. Restoration. Every one of
[1:23:46] those messages, we're feeding on
[1:23:49] it. Luke 17:30, St. John 12, many more
[1:23:54] scriptures. Joel 2:28, all the palmer
[1:23:57] worms left and so forth. I will
[1:23:59] restore. Amen. And what he would do in
[1:24:01] these last days and how the prophet said
[1:24:04] there'd be light in this last days.
[1:24:08] Amen. How many knows when the world is
[1:24:11] famishing, when the world is dying, the
[1:24:14] bride in Isaiah 60, he took us to Isaiah
[1:24:18] 60. He said, "Arise and shine, for thy
[1:24:22] light is come, and the glory of the Lord
[1:24:25] is risen upon thee. For behold, the
[1:24:28] darkness covers the earth, and gross
[1:24:31] darkness the people, but the Lord shall
[1:24:34] rise upon they, and his glory shall be
[1:24:37] seen upon thee.
[1:24:41] Woo! Aren't you glad that you're part of
[1:24:43] that second part? You're not out there
[1:24:45] in gross darkness. You're not out there
[1:24:47] in death. You're not out there in
[1:24:49] starvation. Why? Because you're eating
[1:24:51] Malachi 4. You're eating what God is
[1:24:55] bringing.
[1:24:56] And the light your eyes are open. It's
[1:24:59] bright light. When everything's dark,
[1:25:00] it's brighter to you. You see it plainer
[1:25:03] than ever before. Everything from the
[1:25:05] very mind of God before the foundation
[1:25:07] of the world
[1:25:10] all the way to the end. You see it
[1:25:12] clearly. You understand it clearly.
[1:25:19] Amen. Praise be to God. That's what he
[1:25:22] said. That's one of the references that
[1:25:24] he made. Just one of many.
[1:25:27] Amen. That's right. And his glory shall
[1:25:31] be seen
[1:25:33] upon
[1:25:35] thee.
[1:25:40] Amen. Now
[1:25:43] notice what he would do, how that it
[1:25:46] would work, what it would do. All these
[1:25:49] scriptures pointing to these last days.
[1:25:53] And that is Christ. If you can hide away
[1:25:57] in that. Now, I mean, how many believe
[1:26:00] that's where we're hiding away? Oh, them
[1:26:02] bunch of crazy people over there at
[1:26:04] Trees Shop at Evening Life Tabernacle.
[1:26:06] They believe that God sent a prophet.
[1:26:09] You know, the women are all oldfashioned
[1:26:11] and the men, you know, and this, that,
[1:26:12] and the other. And ain't no telling what
[1:26:14] people are say. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:16] Huh? But what is it? We're hid away.
[1:26:20] They might not understand us. They might
[1:26:21] not think about us. Amen. Abraham says,
[1:26:24] you know, it was like it's like he was
[1:26:25] in the days of Noah. Amen. They called
[1:26:27] him a bunch of fanatic. He called him a
[1:26:29] fanatic. But the word of the fanatic
[1:26:32] that saved him and destroyed the others.
[1:26:36] And the word that you're following, it's
[1:26:38] going to save
[1:26:39] you. How many believe it's going to
[1:26:41] rapture you out of here?
[1:26:45] The very God that they claim to serve,
[1:26:47] brothers, would destroy
[1:26:50] them.
[1:26:53] Pretty strong, ain't
[1:26:56] it? Amen. But this bunch of what they
[1:27:00] call
[1:27:01] crazy is actually our salvation, isn't
[1:27:04] it?
[1:27:05] Amen. All right. I don't know if I'll
[1:27:07] get to these here or not.
[1:27:22] All
[1:27:24] right. That's right. Now,
[1:27:28] notice he
[1:27:30] says all these scriptures of the last
[1:27:32] day and that is Christ. You can hide
[1:27:35] away in that now in that secret place.
[1:27:38] You can eat and see the goodness and
[1:27:41] mercy of God.
[1:27:45] Amen. You can eat and see the goodness
[1:27:48] of God. If you're sick, there's healing
[1:27:50] there. Amen. How many knows if you need
[1:27:54] deliverance, there's deliverance there.
[1:27:56] If you need joy, there's joy there.
[1:28:01] If you need forgiveness, there's
[1:28:02] forgiveness there.
[1:28:05] [Applause]
[1:28:07] Hallelujah. I want to read the rest of
[1:28:09] this. Remember he was talking about how
[1:28:11] many know that when he got to talking
[1:28:14] about the invisible union of Christ and
[1:28:15] the bride and he talks about if you're
[1:28:17] believing this if you're believing every
[1:28:20] word I've said this a couple times in
[1:28:22] the last few weeks but I want to say it
[1:28:24] again because in Ephesians he says he's
[1:28:26] going to have a sp a church without spot
[1:28:28] or without blemish without any such
[1:28:31] things. Peter said the same thing. He
[1:28:33] says be be careful that you be found of
[1:28:35] him without spot and blameless.
[1:28:38] Amen. And how many believe that there's
[1:28:40] blamelessness, there's spotlessness in
[1:28:43] this message
[1:28:45] when you eat that. I believe it when you
[1:28:47] accept it. Oh, hallelujah. This is my
[1:28:51] message to the church this morning as we
[1:28:53] go off the air. Amen. You are standing.
[1:28:55] If you're standing on God's word and
[1:28:57] with God's word, every Amen. Every jot,
[1:29:00] every tenn where are you
[1:29:02] standing? Oh, aren't you glad for eyes
[1:29:04] have to be able to see? That's right.
[1:29:07] Where you are standing. I'm trying to
[1:29:09] tell you, pull away from them shucks out
[1:29:10] there. Here where where you can get
[1:29:12] right where you can get right before the
[1:29:14] sun. I hear the coming of the combine.
[1:29:17] You're standing completely justified as
[1:29:19] though you never did it in the first
[1:29:21] place. You are the pure, virtuous,
[1:29:23] sinulous son, bride of the son of the
[1:29:26] living God. Every man and every woman
[1:29:28] that's born of the spirit, washed in the
[1:29:30] blood of Jesus Christ, believes every
[1:29:32] word of God, stands as though you never
[1:29:34] sinned in the first place. That's the
[1:29:36] kind of food that you and I are
[1:29:41] eating. You and I are eating. Amen. The
[1:29:44] fornowledge of our God. Amen. Brother
[1:29:46] Bam said predestination to the
[1:29:48] Pentecostals was a bad
[1:29:51] word. Ain't that right? But it isn't to
[1:29:54] you and I. Amen. I've got to lock this
[1:29:57] thing open. I've got one here. A good
[1:29:59] one I think for you yet that will go
[1:30:01] along with what I right here. It is.
[1:30:03] See, it's not their food. It's not for
[1:30:06] the church so-called food. It's bride
[1:30:09] food. It's spiritual food in due season.
[1:30:13] It would make them sick to their
[1:30:15] stomach. It's too rich for
[1:30:18] them. Amen. It ain't too rich for you
[1:30:21] and I. Tell me that my name was put on
[1:30:23] the lamb book of life from the
[1:30:25] foundation of the world. That ain't too
[1:30:27] rich for me. Tell me I was part of his
[1:30:30] thinking before he ever created the
[1:30:32] sardust, the first one. That's not too
[1:30:34] rich for me. It's too rich for an Amish
[1:30:36] person. It's too rich for a Menanite.
[1:30:38] It's too rich for a lot of people cuz
[1:30:40] they want to believe that, hey, I choose
[1:30:42] today that I'm going to serve God and
[1:30:43] that he's got to put my name in the
[1:30:44] book. They want to think that they've
[1:30:46] got a choice in the matter. Sure, you
[1:30:48] will make a choice, but God knew what
[1:30:50] choice you'd make before you ever made
[1:30:51] it.
[1:30:55] Hallelujah. They can't re they can't
[1:30:57] take the richness of it,
[1:31:01] the depth of it. It's too rich for them.
[1:31:06] But it's not too rich for you and I.
[1:31:10] Amen.
[1:31:13] See, they can't do it. But for the
[1:31:15] children, it's bread. It's life. It's
[1:31:18] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:31:21] and forever.
[1:31:25] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let me tell you
[1:31:28] just a couple other things, brother.
[1:31:32] Different ones have been ministering.
[1:31:34] I've ministered on it. Brother Andrew
[1:31:37] Glover come and spoke on it. I said God
[1:31:39] is the all things are possible with
[1:31:43] God. I like that
[1:31:46] quote that all things are possible with
[1:31:49] God. But I will say I have another one
[1:31:54] that I almost like
[1:31:57] better.
[1:32:01] Want me want to see me dig out of this
[1:32:03] one, brother Red?
[1:32:12] All right. Good. If I can find a
[1:32:15] scripture
[1:32:17] here. Um, I've got it wrote
[1:32:20] down. Matthew
[1:32:23] 17. One that you like better than that.
[1:32:26] All things are possible with God.
[1:32:30] What can be more greater than
[1:32:31] that?
[1:32:33] Well, see, he said in chapter 17 of
[1:32:37] Matthew, then the disciples came to
[1:32:39] Jesus apart and said, "Why could we not
[1:32:41] cast him out?" And Jesus said unto them,
[1:32:42] "Because of your unbelief? For verily I
[1:32:44] say unto you, if you have faith, this is
[1:32:46] the grain of the mustard seed, ye shall
[1:32:47] say to this mountain, remove hence to
[1:32:50] yonder place, and it shall
[1:32:53] remove, for nothing shall be impossible
[1:32:56] unto you.
[1:33:01] Brother Abraham says, I was going to
[1:33:03] choke on it, but I'm going to say it
[1:33:05] anyway. Man is
[1:33:10] omnipotent. That's right. You don't
[1:33:12] believe that? He uses a different
[1:33:14] scriptures than I use. But a man that's
[1:33:16] fully surrendered to God is omnipotent.
[1:33:20] Mark 11:12 says, "Whatsoever things you
[1:33:23] say, if you don't doubt, Amen, it shall
[1:33:25] be done." That is not only is it
[1:33:27] impossible with God, but all things are
[1:33:29] possible with you.
[1:33:33] I know God can do anything, but when he
[1:33:35] tells me you can do anything, too.
[1:33:37] Anything that God lays on your heart, I
[1:33:40] don't care. I believe it. You know why I
[1:33:41] believe it? Cuz Joshua pointed his
[1:33:44] finger to the sun and said, "Son, stand
[1:33:46] still. Universe, stand still."
[1:33:54] Then we've got our problem with our
[1:33:55] headache and our teache, right? Huh? Our
[1:33:58] little things. Come on, people. How many
[1:34:01] believe we need to have more faith?
[1:34:03] That's right. We need to have more
[1:34:04] faith. Nothing shall be impossible. A
[1:34:08] lot of people can't climb there. Most
[1:34:10] churches say, "Well, God don't do
[1:34:12] anything this morning." You're right.
[1:34:14] He's not supposed to. You're the one
[1:34:15] that he's supposed to be doing it
[1:34:16] through. You're supposed to be doing it.
[1:34:19] God in this season is in church. The
[1:34:20] works that I do shall you do now. You're
[1:34:23] supposed to be doing these things, you
[1:34:25] unbeliever.
[1:34:28] Took an eagle, took Malaphor, Mak took
[1:34:32] that Malachi 4 to come in there and
[1:34:33] straighten it out and tell them these
[1:34:35] churches are wrong. Their teachings are
[1:34:37] wrong. Bible don't teach that. You got
[1:34:40] to go to instruction class. The Bible
[1:34:41] don't teach it. You got to put your name
[1:34:42] on the book to become a member of the
[1:34:44] church. There's only one membership. The
[1:34:46] prophet of God said, "By one spirit, are
[1:34:48] we all baptized into one?" In one body
[1:34:50] and our members in
[1:34:56] particular. All right. I better quit or
[1:34:59] I'll be a
[1:35:02] glutton. Is it okay to be a glutton
[1:35:04] spiritually?
[1:35:14] Amen. Just when you think it's gone, the
[1:35:15] devil tries to poke it. But I want to
[1:35:17] thank the Lord for his healing. Amen. I
[1:35:19] slept good the last few nights. And I'm
[1:35:22] here to tell you, well, I'm kind of a
[1:35:24] pinched nerve muscles this, that, or the
[1:35:26] other. But God is our healer. You go
[1:35:30] on them th 20 30 lb weights and just
[1:35:33] lift a little. Say, "Get out of here,
[1:35:35] devil.
[1:35:37] That's
[1:35:38] right. Praise the
[1:35:41] Lord. Oh
[1:35:44] my.
[1:35:47] Well, I'll just stop with one more
[1:35:49] little thought. Maybe we'll take it up
[1:35:52] Sunday. We'll
[1:35:56] see. Not thought, but quote. How about a
[1:35:59] quote? How many likes quotes? Amen. It's
[1:36:02] not my word, it's his word. Amen.
[1:36:06] Listen, the devil can't stand when you
[1:36:08] get a revelation from God. When you
[1:36:10] really get your soul fed, he knows that
[1:36:12] if the people get a true revelation of
[1:36:14] the true church, what she is and what
[1:36:16] she stands for, that she can do the
[1:36:18] greater works. If she'll get a
[1:36:20] revelation that she can do the greater
[1:36:22] works, she will be an invincible army.
[1:36:27] How many believes that? That's why in
[1:36:30] this message, in this word stands an
[1:36:32] invincible army. Unstoppable army.
[1:36:38] Evening night tabernacle church. Amen.
[1:36:40] Saint you are an invincible army. You
[1:36:43] cannot be stopped.
[1:36:47] Why? Because you know because of greater
[1:36:49] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:36:51] the world. That's why. Give him a hand.
[1:36:53] Thank you
[1:36:54] Jesus. Cuz he's greater than he that is
[1:36:57] in the
[1:36:59] world. Hallelujah.
[1:37:02] with true revelation in our lives. The
[1:37:04] gates of hell cannot prevail against us,
[1:37:06] but we will prevail. This kind of food
[1:37:08] gives you prevailing power over the
[1:37:11] devil, over evil, over doubt, over the
[1:37:15] wy wousy woos and the blues, over
[1:37:19] depression,
[1:37:21] over fear of death, over fear of hell,
[1:37:23] over fear of judgment. All fear can be
[1:37:26] gone.
[1:37:43] Amen. It is revelation of God that will
[1:37:47] give you
[1:37:49] authority over the
[1:37:52] devil. This message I said one more. I'm
[1:37:56] sorry. Here's my one more.
[1:38:00] I'm glad that a man can live so close to
[1:38:02] God that the devil don't know what to do
[1:38:05] with him. Hello. How many believes
[1:38:07] that's in the message? That's in this
[1:38:09] food. Give me some of that food. I want
[1:38:10] some more of that. That the devil don't
[1:38:13] know what to do with you because you
[1:38:15] live so completely to God. And if you'll
[1:38:17] notice before, Brother Brandham said
[1:38:19] that that a man is
[1:38:21] omnipotent. He said a fully surrendered
[1:38:24] man. Amen. When you're like Jesus, how
[1:38:27] many wants to be like Jesus? How many
[1:38:30] like to do the works Jesus did? If you
[1:38:32] do, then do this. Do what he says when
[1:38:36] he came back. Amen. And they were
[1:38:39] bringing food back. Remember, he says,
[1:38:41] did he get some meat? He says, he says,
[1:38:43] "My meat is the dude of will of the
[1:38:46] father." More than your food, more more
[1:38:49] than eating. You have a greater desire.
[1:38:52] Every four hours, we get pretty hungry.
[1:38:54] But a greater his true desire was to do
[1:38:57] the father's will. You walk like that
[1:39:01] and you watch God work through you.
[1:39:03] Amen. Let's
[1:39:09] stand. Amen. Lord, help us. Lord, help
[1:39:13] us to come to the fullness of this.
[1:39:18] Amen. Praise be to God.
[1:39:33] here's my cup,
[1:39:36] Lord. Here's my
[1:39:39] cup,
[1:39:41] Lord. I lift it
[1:39:45] up, Lord.
[1:39:47] [Music]
[1:39:49] Come and
[1:39:52] quench the
[1:39:54] thirsting of my
[1:40:00] soul. Bread of
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:05] heaven. Feed me till I want no
[1:40:13] more. Here's my cup.
[1:40:17] Fill it up and make me
[1:40:22] whole. One more time. Oh, fill my
[1:40:28] cup, Lord.
[1:40:31] I lift it up,
[1:40:37] Lord, and come and
[1:40:42] quench this
[1:40:44] thirsting of my soul.
[1:40:48] [Music]
[1:40:51] Bread of
[1:40:55] heaven, feed me till I
[1:40:59] want no
[1:41:03] more. Here's my
[1:41:06] cup. Fill it
[1:41:08] up and make me
[1:41:14] whole. You're shut in with God in a
[1:41:17] secret place.
[1:41:19] Shut
[1:41:20] in with
[1:41:23] God in a
[1:41:27] secret place.
[1:41:31] There in the
[1:41:34] spirit
[1:41:36] beholding his
[1:41:39] face and
[1:41:41] gaining new
[1:41:44] power to run in the race.
[1:41:50] My
[1:41:52] love, do we shut in with
[1:41:59] God? Oh, shut
[1:42:02] in with
[1:42:04] God in a
[1:42:08] secret place.
[1:42:12] There in the
[1:42:15] spirit
[1:42:17] beholding his
[1:42:20] face and
[1:42:22] gaining new
[1:42:25] power to run in the
[1:42:30] race. I
[1:42:33] long to be shot in with
[1:42:39] God. Amen. Were you blessed this
[1:42:42] evening? Amen. Brother Steve, I wonder
[1:42:44] if you'd just dismiss us in prayer this
[1:43:06] evening. Amen. Let's just sing that
[1:43:08] chorus. The windows of heaven are open
[1:43:10] as we're dismissed this
[1:43:12] [Music]
[1:43:14] evening. Windows of heaven are
[1:43:19] open. The blessings are falling
[1:43:24] tonight. There's joy. Enjoy.
