[32:44] got me
[32:46] married in october amen
[32:49] i know brother brad i think you're in
[32:51] november i think it was opening day i
[32:52] won't forget that so
[32:54] amen i always remember that there's only
[32:55] a few i think brother willie or who else
[32:57] was it in here got it
[32:58] somebody else did it on opening day and
[33:00] so amen that's a good
[33:02] good way to do it right there all right
[33:04] uh anybody else in october
[33:07] no no all right
[33:10] praise the lord god bless you it's good
[33:12] to be in the house of the lord
[33:13] amen it's just good the amen i'll tell
[33:16] you how far the lord is certainly good
[33:18] and
[33:18] and certainly has been nice thank you
[33:21] musicians appreciate it
[33:24] amen if you will stand with me amen the
[33:28] lord has
[33:29] um the last few weeks had a little bit
[33:32] different
[33:32] type of messages i guess i think it was
[33:35] lord laid on my heart to speak about
[33:37] how the lord is never in a hurry amen
[33:40] amen and so we took the little quote
[33:42] where brother bam talked about his
[33:44] little trip with that indian guide you
[33:46] know
[33:46] and he was going too fast right and he
[33:49] just slowed down and slowed down and
[33:51] slowed down and he didn't know what kind
[33:53] of a gear he'd have to go into
[33:55] amen but anyway so you know we just have
[33:58] to be patient
[33:59] and not go so fast amen because brother
[34:03] bam said it causes all kinds of
[34:05] things that happened blow ups and
[34:06] whatnot else and then the other one was
[34:08] i think the chain is only
[34:10] strongest at its weakest link amen and
[34:13] we use that with the help of the lord
[34:14] just to take a message from there this
[34:16] morning
[34:17] amen i want to take a thought out of
[34:19] hebrews 12
[34:20] if you will go to hebrews 12.
[34:27] trust everybody is doing well
[34:30] at this point unless
[34:34] a lot of you really want to have the
[34:35] fall festival
[34:37] uh we probably won't do it just yet if
[34:39] that's all right with you i mean
[34:42] if we still like i really would rather
[34:44] have our sunday school back and things
[34:46] like that you know
[34:47] if we're gonna do that and i don't think
[34:49] the community might be too happy and
[34:51] when with us riding around and
[34:53] everything to being that close together
[34:55] and all and having
[34:56] fellowshipped in and now i'd like to do
[34:58] it but i know the governor still let's
[35:00] ask us to
[35:01] do social distancing as much as possible
[35:04] so i think we ought to honor that as
[35:06] much as possible for a little while yet
[35:08] because we do know it's going around yet
[35:10] isn't that right it's still pretty
[35:11] strong
[35:13] i would have liked for it to have uh
[35:15] subsided a whole lot more than what it
[35:17] has
[35:18] but it's still going strong as you know
[35:20] the president and his wife got it and so
[35:23] you know if they can get it anybody can
[35:24] get it but i know i
[35:26] i guess trump that's why we like him
[35:29] is because he don't stop you know he
[35:32] keeps on going and that's
[35:33] the way a lot of us think and that right
[35:35] we can't stop because of it
[35:36] got to keep going but anyway we do
[35:39] appreciate being able to have services
[35:41] amen
[35:42] and so if that's okay with everybody so
[35:44] all right
[35:45] let's just bow our heads and go before
[35:46] the lord in prayer before we read this
[35:48] word lord jesus we certainly want to
[35:50] approach you first god
[35:51] before reading your word lord jesus and
[35:54] we just want to
[35:55] realize lord jesus as your prophet
[35:57] taught us that anybody
[35:58] can open the bible and read the read
[36:01] but lord it truly does take you to bring
[36:04] out the understanding and place it into
[36:06] our hearts
[36:07] so that we'll be able to receive it lord
[36:08] jesus and truly understand it father
[36:11] so this morning we asked lord jesus for
[36:13] a true understanding
[36:14] father of your word lord jesus and a
[36:16] closer walk with you lord
[36:18] we ask god that you'll just bless this
[36:20] thought i feel once again that you've
[36:22] laid upon my heart to speak lord
[36:24] may you help it lord to bless the people
[36:27] lord and edify the body of christ for
[36:29] that's
[36:29] truly what you have called your fifo
[36:31] ministry to do
[36:33] you have called them to be for the
[36:34] edification of the body of christ lord
[36:37] and we ask god that you would just edify
[36:39] your body this morning lord jesus bless
[36:41] your people as we have gathered
[36:43] and grateful to be able to do so
[36:44] thanking you lord jesus that you've
[36:46] protected lord
[36:47] us from that virus and the way that you
[36:49] have lord we ask god you continue to do
[36:51] so
[36:52] and lord we pray for those that are
[36:53] infected lord and those have received it
[36:55] that you'd
[36:56] heal them lord jesus and touch them in a
[36:58] special way lord

[37:07] now lord to you and we close our hearts
[37:09] and our mind to the cares of life
[37:11] to the worries of life and the things
[37:12] lord that it's just
[37:14] the cares of life we just want to block
[37:16] it out now and
[37:17] ask and you would just take our hearts
[37:19] and thoughts lord and speak lord through
[37:20] my lips lord jesus
[37:22] words as you once spoken in jesus
[37:24] christ's name
[37:25] amen and amen turn if you will to
[37:27] hebrews the 12th chapter i guess that
[37:29] i'd told you that
[37:30] amen hebrews 12 and we'll repeat
[37:34] read the first eight verses then i will
[37:38] speak to you amen and i want you to
[37:40] notice perhaps while we
[37:43] while we go through this i want you to
[37:46] notice two words because those are the
[37:48] two words that
[37:49] i want to speak on one of them is
[37:52] endurance
[37:52] and the other one is patience endurance
[37:55] and patience amen
[37:56] so that'll be our thoughts on this
[37:58] morning we're foreseeing
[38:00] we are also compassed about with so
[38:03] great a cloud of witnesses
[38:05] let us lay aside every weight and the
[38:07] sin which does so easily beset us
[38:09] and let us run with patience the race
[38:12] that is set
[38:13] before us looking unto jesus the author
[38:17] and finisher of our faith
[38:20] who for the joy that was set before him
[38:23] endured
[38:24] the cross despising the shame and he sat
[38:27] down at the right hand of the throne of
[38:28] god
[38:29] for consider him that endured such
[38:32] contradiction of sinners against himself
[38:34] least ye be weary and faint in your
[38:37] minds
[38:38] ye have not yet resisted unto blood
[38:42] striving against sin
[38:44] and ye have forgotten the exhortation
[38:46] which speaketh unto you as
[38:48] unto children my son despised thou not
[38:52] the chastening of the lord for when
[38:54] nor faint when thou art rebuked of him
[38:57] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[38:59] and scourges
[39:01] every son whom he receiveth and if ye
[39:04] endure chastening god dealth with you
[39:07] as with sons for what son is he whom the
[39:10] father chasteneth not
[39:12] but if he be without chastisement we're
[39:14] off all are partakers
[39:16] then are you bastards and not sons
[39:19] may god it is blessings to reading words
[39:21] you can be seated this morning
[39:24] praise the lord amen i like what the
[39:26] prophet of god said you know if i just
[39:28] came up here and i just spoke to you and
[39:29] spoke to you and spoke to you and
[39:31] said all kinds of things you know he
[39:33] says but no service is complete
[39:35] without the reading of the scriptures
[39:38] amen because man can say anything
[39:40] in that right but the only way you know
[39:42] that it's really right
[39:43] if it's according to the word of god
[39:46] and so if you do have the reading of the
[39:49] scriptures then i believe that your
[39:50] service is complete in that right
[39:52] because amen that is truly what makes
[39:55] the service
[39:56] it's the word of god amen i have quite a
[39:59] few scriptures i'd like to go to
[40:01] amen and so you just pray for me and
[40:04] also
[40:04] just been a little bit weak the last few
[40:06] days so bear with me i feel fine but
[40:09] just been a little bit weak for some
[40:11] reason
[40:12] amen so now in the 12th chapter of
[40:14] hebrews down here and talks about
[40:17] how that we are to lay aside every
[40:19] weight and the sin that does so easily
[40:20] beset us
[40:21] and for some reason paul if you'll
[40:23] notice paul always was talking about
[40:26] amen he liked to use this journey
[40:29] that we're on amen uh he always used to
[40:33] like this as a race
[40:34] in that right he always talked about
[40:36] running a race and so forth over in
[40:39] first corinthians 10 and verse 24
[40:43] paul says you know he said ye
[40:46] know ye not that they which run in a
[40:48] race run all
[40:50] but one receiveth the prize so run that
[40:53] you may obtain
[40:54] and every man that striveth for the
[40:56] mastery is temperate
[40:58] in all things now they do it to obtain a
[41:00] corruptable crown
[41:02] but we an incorruptable amen so
[41:06] paula they're talking about comparing
[41:08] this life to a race that we're running
[41:10] amen and so we want to talk about that
[41:13] with the help of the lord and we want to
[41:14] talk about endurance
[41:16] and patience something we're all
[41:17] familiar with but you know we are
[41:20] we are now at the end of the race
[41:23] somebody believes we're kind of
[41:24] coming down to finishing this race amen
[41:28] i mean the race of the whole thing you
[41:30] know and i believe it was brother
[41:32] branham that one place he talked about
[41:34] over in hebrew seed i believe the
[41:36] scripture talked about david without us
[41:37] cannot be made perfect and he says that
[41:40] we
[41:41] they all the saints of the ages past us
[41:44] are waiting on us i mean they were
[41:46] patiently waiting on us
[41:48] to come to the place that we're supposed
[41:50] to be amen
[41:51] amen and then we'll go and and we'll
[41:55] uh you know gain the prize basically
[41:59] because there's a prize that comes with
[42:00] this race that we're running
[42:02] amen but you know i like that first part
[42:04] of that scripture where it says you know
[42:06] looking unto the author and the finisher
[42:09] of our faith
[42:11] amen and so i you know born again son of
[42:13] god of god you know it's not so much
[42:15] that we're
[42:16] afraid of not finishing the race but we
[42:18] know when uh we want to know how to run
[42:21] this race we want to
[42:22] know what it's going to take to finish
[42:24] it because ultimately it isn't uh
[42:28] it isn't about how far you run or how
[42:30] much you run but it's
[42:31] actually it's it's all about getting to
[42:34] the end of the race
[42:35] and what is at the end of that race um
[42:38] and enduring and it takes in a real
[42:41] endurance
[42:42] amen to be able to finish a race i
[42:45] believe it was um
[42:47] jesus mentioned a time or two uh he was
[42:50] talking about a seed that falls in the
[42:52] ground and
[42:53] you know some people receive the word
[42:55] and
[42:56] and boy they just they're so happy about
[42:58] it and they
[42:59] uh with joy you know uh they rejoice in
[43:02] the lord for a while but
[43:04] by and by they're offended you know and
[43:06] and they just go so far
[43:08] and then and then they fall by the
[43:10] wayside and so forth and even jesus
[43:12] talked about
[43:13] basically what we're talking about this
[43:14] morning how that you know
[43:16] you know it's not about that it's about
[43:18] bringing forth a hundred fold or
[43:20] or getting all the way to the end of the
[43:22] race and and finishing
[43:24] and seeing what's on the end of the at
[43:26] the end for the prize and i have a
[43:28] little
[43:28] perhaps a little drama here at the end
[43:30] that i want to bring to you with the
[43:32] help
[43:33] of the lord about what it's going to be
[43:35] like
[43:36] when we uh receive the prize amen
[43:39] now it says looking unto jesus now here
[43:42] and there's another place we also want
[43:44] to talk about job because bible talks
[43:46] about job
[43:47] amen when he talks about the patience of
[43:49] job but it says
[43:50] let us run with patience the race that
[43:52] set before us
[43:54] looking unto jesus the author and the
[43:56] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[43:58] that was set down before him
[44:00] endured the cross despising the shame
[44:04] and he sat down at the right hand of the
[44:06] throne of god
[44:07] for consider him that endured he talked
[44:10] about
[44:11] endured such contradiction of sinners
[44:13] against himself
[44:14] at least you be weary and faint in your
[44:16] minds
[44:18] amen amen we see in our day we've seen a
[44:21] lot of people that are actually fainting
[44:24] you know right people are are they're
[44:27] actually passing out they're
[44:28] they're just they can't run the race
[44:30] anymore they just stop running the race
[44:34] and that right some so we see a lot of
[44:36] it but here it says you know and
[44:38] how many knows that if everything is
[44:41] going easy and everything's going good
[44:43] and
[44:44] and you know there's no endurance
[44:48] to that right there's no endurance and
[44:51] there's neither neither is there any
[44:53] patience with that
[44:54] how many knows when you're going down
[44:56] the road and there's no vehicles in
[44:57] front of you and you can just
[44:58] keep your cruise set on 55 and you can
[45:00] keep scrolling keep right on going
[45:02] but when you're heading to clarksville i
[45:03] did several i did this yesterday and you
[45:05] know
[45:06] um it was kind of funny but i would you
[45:08] know you meet these tractors and they'll
[45:10] go a lot slower you know and
[45:11] hey there's curves and you know and
[45:13] anytime i get behind this low person i'm
[45:15] saying lord
[45:16] all right thank you lord i must be i
[45:18] must be needing some patience here you
[45:20] know
[45:21] and uh meeting the trucker big old truck
[45:23] driver he was
[45:24] behind a few cars you know and i kind of
[45:26] pulled over to see how far it is before
[45:29] you know there would be a straight
[45:30] stretch where you could legally pass
[45:32] i pulled on that big old truck he pulled
[45:34] over like you ain't passing you know
[45:36] and uh i said oh honey it is fun to hear
[45:39] you know so all of a sudden i pulled
[45:40] over again
[45:41] he pulls up i was laughing but he was
[45:44] probably not so happy but causing road
[45:46] rage here
[45:47] but you know it's it's the times when
[45:49] there's stress when they're stressed
[45:51] that's when you have to have patience
[45:53] isn't that right amen and that's also
[45:55] where you have to have endurance
[45:57] and i'll tell you what how many believes
[45:59] that we're certainly living in a very
[46:01] stressful age
[46:03] amen and patience people's people
[46:06] do not have patience now my sons will
[46:08] tell you that
[46:09] my shortcoming is when i uh in my
[46:12] shortcoming and my my
[46:13] my most lack of patience is when i'm
[46:15] working
[46:17] all right and i'll tell the boys
[46:18] sometimes hey do this and before they
[46:20] ever get to do it i go do it
[46:22] i'm getting paid i want to get it done
[46:24] now and yesterday already you know and
[46:26] i'd be better off just go do it myself
[46:28] you know because i can't just say go do
[46:29] this and then
[46:30] you know i'm just and i have to pull
[46:32] back and say well just slow down
[46:34] how do you have to do that to yourself
[46:36] say just slow down a little bit more
[46:38] amen so when i preach on slowing down a
[46:41] lot that goes for me 150
[46:44] amen but you know just to have patience
[46:46] and let me tell you something
[46:47] in order to obtain because the bible
[46:49] talks about obtaining promises through
[46:51] patience
[46:52] amen we have to be paid this is an hour
[46:54] when people are
[46:55] have no patience they don't want to wait
[46:58] on each other in line
[46:59] and there's road rage and all kinds of
[47:01] things you know they just people don't
[47:03] like to wait
[47:06] but how many knows that all the saints
[47:07] of all the ages are actually waiting on
[47:09] us
[47:10] amen it takes patience so look at jesus
[47:13] he says
[47:14] that look at the contradiction of
[47:16] sinners and he talks about how that
[47:18] you know jesus for the sake of reaching
[47:22] his goal
[47:23] he allowed people to false accuse him
[47:26] amen he was spit upon he was called the
[47:29] beelzebub
[47:30] he was rejected and even his disciples
[47:33] left him
[47:34] and he had jesus went through suffering
[47:37] like we could never imagine and notice
[47:40] it wasn't so much just the spear in his
[47:42] side because i probably thought
[47:44] that jesus didn't die from the spirit in
[47:46] his side he was dead before then right
[47:49] amen because he died of a broken heart
[47:51] because the whole world had completely
[47:53] rejected him
[47:57] because people would not receive him and
[47:59] because he was despised and rejected
[48:01] of man he was actually died of a broken
[48:03] heart amen because
[48:05] amen here he displayed all this love and
[48:08] at the very end and he knew he would
[48:09] but the very his own very disciples left
[48:12] him
[48:14] even the last 12 that was with him they
[48:16] all forsook him
[48:17] they all went their ways you know there
[48:19] he was by himself
[48:20] amen but he endured the cross he endured
[48:25] he meant being despised he endured and
[48:28] man being spit upon him
[48:30] it was a it was oh at the garden of
[48:32] gethsemane he prayed
[48:34] and he even if you think about it that
[48:36] even jesus had to pray to the spirit
[48:39] for strength and for overcoming power
[48:42] against his
[48:43] own will and saying not my will but
[48:45] thine be done
[48:46] father it was endurance
[48:49] because if jesus would have not endured
[48:52] he'd just spoke
[48:54] and 12 legions of angels would have come
[48:56] and delivered him
[48:58] and that right he could have done it but
[49:00] he knew that that was not the purpose
[49:02] of god amen he was being being god in
[49:05] flesh he was never going to be overcome
[49:07] by his own
[49:08] by by the flesh part where he says not
[49:10] my will but thine be done if it be
[49:12] possible let this come from
[49:13] it was endurance it was a hard struggle
[49:18] and here if after that if you'll notice
[49:20] so so jesus actually went to the cross
[49:23] he endured
[49:24] amen being false accused lied about
[49:27] amen and receiving capital punishment by
[49:30] the hands of
[49:31] sinners so that's what the bible is
[49:35] telling us here look at jesus look at
[49:37] what he went through
[49:38] amen look at his endurance for the joy
[49:41] amen that was to be able to sit at the
[49:44] right hand of god
[49:45] amen amen of the throne of god so
[49:47] consider him that endured such a
[49:49] contradiction of sinners
[49:50] against himself at least he be weary and
[49:53] faith in your own minds
[49:55] or you haven't went to the cross how
[49:57] many knows we haven't nobody's punched
[49:59] you in the face
[50:00] nobody's cut you nobody spit on you
[50:03] nobody's
[50:04] put you on the cross we haven't actually
[50:07] bled or spilled blood striving against
[50:10] sin but yet jesus lost his very life
[50:13] striving against sin amen and he endured
[50:18] that's what paul said look at him look
[50:20] at what he did striving against sin and
[50:23] look at the endurance that he had
[50:25] so if you know what want to know what
[50:26] kind of endurance that you're
[50:28] supposed to have jesus is your example
[50:32] how many believe that this morning jesus
[50:33] is our example when it comes to
[50:35] endurance and even jesus one place that
[50:38] he that endureth
[50:40] unto the end shall be saved
[50:43] i want to talk to you a little bit about
[50:44] what actually gives us that
[50:46] ability to endure because how many knows
[50:49] it's just not a self-will
[50:51] there has to be something in here that
[50:53] gives you the ability
[50:55] to endure amen
[50:59] and then he kind of goes on in a second
[51:01] part here that we'll just pick up for a
[51:03] minute because it talks about the
[51:04] chastening of the lord and being rebuked
[51:07] of the lord now over in revelations i
[51:09] don't have the scriptures pulled out and
[51:11] so forth but we realize that
[51:13] jesus said there in the third chapter of
[51:15] revelations as many as
[51:17] i love i rebuke and chasten
[51:20] so how many knows rebuking being rebuked
[51:23] of the lord
[51:24] and being chastised or corrected by the
[51:27] lord
[51:28] amen it takes endurance to go through
[51:31] that
[51:33] because if you can't take the correction
[51:35] of the lord
[51:36] remember you're not his son and if you
[51:39] are a son of god you are going to
[51:42] receive
[51:43] chastisement you are going to receive
[51:45] correction
[51:46] you're going to get rebuked because
[51:50] i love you amen because he just doesn't
[51:53] simply
[51:54] allow you to come into heaven with all
[51:56] of your wrong
[51:57] and believe me we have plenty of wrong
[52:00] our first birth was wrong
[52:01] our first nature was wrong amen the
[52:05] fruit of the flesh the bible talks about
[52:06] is
[52:07] witchcraft idolatry and invariance
[52:09] immolation wrath strife
[52:11] these all these things it's the fruit of
[52:13] the flesh
[52:14] amen and that has to be purged that has
[52:17] to be
[52:18] cleaned is that right we have to put on
[52:21] a new nature
[52:22] but it's given us by the holy ghost amen
[52:24] and then you have
[52:26] righteousness peace joy long suffering
[52:29] gentleness
[52:30] meekness and and temperance and patience
[52:33] and godliness all of these things over
[52:35] here
[52:36] virtue strength all of these come from
[52:38] us that's what god wants you to have
[52:40] and so all those other things have to be
[52:42] taken out of you
[52:44] if they are in you remember god he's
[52:46] going to come at you he's going to
[52:47] come keep coming at you look this has to
[52:50] be dealt with i got to deal with this on
[52:52] you
[52:52] and that right and sometimes it hurts
[52:54] i'll tell you what i don't think any kid
[52:57] loves to get a woman no
[53:00] it hurts not just not just
[53:04] uh the whooping hurts but the
[53:06] humiliation of having to need a woman
[53:09] and being talked to
[53:10] what's wrong with you son don't you know
[53:12] any better and
[53:13] being humiliated a little bit
[53:16] you know and then a whooping on top of
[53:18] it well i'll tell you what i mean
[53:20] they have a real way of getting the
[53:22] frowns going down
[53:26] why because it goes against the flesh
[53:28] it's hard on the flesh
[53:30] but even the bible says the next verse
[53:32] didn't our fathers according to the
[53:33] flesh you know correctness
[53:36] you know and they did it for the
[53:37] pleasure of the father but it says that
[53:40] this god does it to us for our
[53:43] own good
[53:46] amen when god corrects us it's usually
[53:50] pretty strong it's usually pretty hard
[53:52] amen and it takes a real son of god a
[53:55] real daughter of god
[53:56] to be able to take that rebuke to take
[53:59] that chastisement
[54:00] it takes both patience and endurance
[54:04] you must endure the correction of god if
[54:08] you're gonna be his child
[54:10] if you aren't going to take his
[54:11] correction you remember you're none of
[54:12] his
[54:14] you're a bastard child the bible calls
[54:15] you amen
[54:19] so we look at that and then i'm going to
[54:21] look at another one over in
[54:23] james
[54:27] turn with me to james if you would
[54:31] to james
[54:47] let's go to james 1 and then we'll go to
[54:51] i'm going to
[54:56] james 1 my brethren
[55:00] verse 2 count it all joy when you fall
[55:03] into diverse temptations knowing this
[55:06] that the trying
[55:08] of your faith worketh patience
[55:13] wow so whenever you have a trial it's
[55:17] not just to test your
[55:18] faith is that right but it's to bring
[55:22] another something else into your life
[55:24] that's patience
[55:27] amen
[55:30] so the trying of your faith it works
[55:33] patience
[55:34] and then it says and let
[55:38] patience have her perfect work
[55:41] that you may be in that you may be
[55:43] perfect
[55:44] and entire wanting nothing hallelujah
[55:49] this just comes to mind i trust it'll be
[55:51] a blessing but you know whenever you're
[55:53] going through something
[55:55] and and you're being tried and and
[55:58] and that product of patience is coming
[56:01] forth
[56:02] most of the time listen most of the time
[56:06] where we fail is during that trial
[56:10] [Music]
[56:12] during the test of our trial we fail
[56:16] because why we lack patience to go
[56:19] through that trial
[56:20] trusting god
[56:25] amen and then guess what that means you
[56:27] never
[56:28] learn patience but let me say this let's
[56:32] say that you go through this trial
[56:34] of your faith amen and you patiently
[56:37] wait isn't it right
[56:38] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[56:42] their strength
[56:43] isn't that right they shall renew their
[56:45] strength and by
[56:46] and then what if you can make it and
[56:48] patiently make it through a trial
[56:50] next trial a comeback guess what you'll
[56:52] patiently and
[56:53] you'll that you'll be the product that
[56:55] god is looking for to live with him
[56:58] let it have its perfect work that you
[57:02] might be entire
[57:04] lacking nothing because if you fail in
[57:06] the middle of the trial
[57:07] you didn't pass the test you got to take
[57:10] it over and that right so if you didn't
[57:12] bring what it's supposed to do
[57:14] the tests and the trials count it all
[57:16] joy when you fall into
[57:18] diverse temptations and trial boy oh boy
[57:21] as our human nature says brother i
[57:23] cannot
[57:24] say that i enjoy that isn't that right
[57:27] how many can say boy i'll tell you
[57:28] i counted all joy when i had real trials
[57:31] and deaths come my way
[57:36] huh but what did james say
[57:40] counted all joy in that acts
[57:43] i just read let me just read you let me
[57:46] just read you something
[57:48] real quick like acts 14
[57:51] i didn't write the uh
[57:56] i didn't write it down
[58:00] okay i had quite a few yeah here it is
[58:03] didn't write it down but i found it
[58:05] confirming the souls
[58:06] of the disciples and exhorting them to
[58:09] continue
[58:10] in faith all right and that we must
[58:13] through much tribulation enter
[58:17] the kingdom amen
[58:20] let me tell you something tribulation
[58:23] it's just a natural part of a believer
[58:27] and we don't understand it here in
[58:29] laodicea like they did with
[58:31] paul in them paul and them and the early
[58:33] disciples they knew what it was like
[58:35] until they
[58:36] even put it in the bible that look
[58:38] you're going to have to
[58:39] go through much tribulation to enter the
[58:42] kingdom
[58:43] much trials more tests a whole lot of
[58:46] that it's going to take for you to
[58:47] actually enter into the kingdom james
[58:49] said count it all joy when you fall into
[58:51] a diverse temptation
[58:53] knowing this trying of your faith
[58:54] workers patience let it
[58:57] have a perfect work that you may be
[58:58] entire amen
[59:00] lacking nothing praise the lord
[59:04] so i just thought of that i thought lord
[59:06] help us amen let it have its perfect
[59:09] work because
[59:10] amen we're going to have to be patient
[59:11] in this
[59:13] now most of us know that we've actually
[59:15] we have been looking for the coming of
[59:17] the lord
[59:18] amen and we most message people have
[59:20] expected we're expecting at least
[59:23] very much before uh 1977 my
[59:26] father-in-law
[59:27] promised my my wife that if that the
[59:30] lord don't come before 77
[59:32] i'll buy you lowers all right she'll go
[59:34] get a horse out of the deal if god
[59:36] didn't come in 77.
[59:38] yeah that's how much they were relying
[59:40] on they believed because of what brother
[59:42] bannon said he thought that the ushering
[59:44] in of the millennium
[59:45] what happened by 1977.
[59:49] and here we are 2 000 and what 20.
[59:53] amen so i'll tell you what how many
[59:54] knows it's taken a lot of patience it
[59:57] takes patience
[59:59] it takes endurance amen
[1:00:04] praise the lord and it takes being able
[1:00:07] to go through things
[1:00:09] to let the lord work on us to give us
[1:00:13] patience
[1:00:14] how many this morning you know that you
[1:00:15] need more patience i know i do lord
[1:00:18] help me to have more patience because
[1:00:20] i'll
[1:00:21] maybe this just comes to my mind better
[1:00:23] john if you have
[1:00:25] patience you have endurance
[1:00:29] because you can't have patience without
[1:00:31] having endurance because patience is
[1:00:32] enduring things
[1:00:34] and that right
[1:00:37] amen all right let's go to another one
[1:00:43] now we'll go to james five
[1:00:47] james five a lot of scripture about
[1:00:49] endurance and patience
[1:01:00] james 5 and we'll begin with verse 7.
[1:01:04] be patient therefore brethren
[1:01:08] unto the coming of the lord and i want
[1:01:11] to
[1:01:11] i'm going to touch the end of the
[1:01:12] service perhaps try to come back to this
[1:01:14] seventh verse but
[1:01:17] and dwell on that a little bit be
[1:01:20] patient therefore brethren unto the
[1:01:21] coming of the lord behold the husband
[1:01:23] husbandman waiteth for the precious
[1:01:25] fruit of the earth
[1:01:27] and had long patience for it
[1:01:31] until he received the early and latter
[1:01:34] rain be also so he's saying
[1:01:38] god is patient am i right how many is
[1:01:41] god's patient
[1:01:42] now he says next verse be also
[1:01:46] patient establish
[1:01:50] your for the coming of the lord
[1:01:53] draweth nigh hallelujah
[1:01:57] now how many knows paul peter all of
[1:02:00] those brothers they
[1:02:01] expected the coming of the lord to be
[1:02:03] anytime even in their
[1:02:04] age and here we are 2 000 years later
[1:02:11] talk about patience isn't that right
[1:02:14] that's right for the coming of the lord
[1:02:16] throughout the night grudge not on
[1:02:18] against another brother at least ye be
[1:02:19] condemned behold the judge standeth
[1:02:21] before the door
[1:02:23] take my brethren the prophets who have
[1:02:25] spoken
[1:02:26] in the name of the lord for an example
[1:02:30] of suffering affliction and
[1:02:33] of patience
[1:02:36] how many knows that we're really living
[1:02:38] an hour where people
[1:02:39] cannot take very much
[1:02:43] people cannot take very much they can't
[1:02:45] handle very much
[1:02:49] amen
[1:02:52] oh my so now notice verse 11
[1:02:56] take them for an example of suffering
[1:02:58] affliction patience behold
[1:03:00] we kill them happy which endure
[1:03:06] you have heard of the patience of job
[1:03:09] all right
[1:03:10] now that's all it says that's all it
[1:03:12] says about job but i want to talk a
[1:03:14] little bit more about him but i'm going
[1:03:15] to talk about the second half of the
[1:03:16] scripture also
[1:03:18] and have seen the end
[1:03:21] of the lord right it goes right back to
[1:03:24] what
[1:03:24] paul said in hebrews about look at what
[1:03:26] the lord went through
[1:03:28] you have seen the end of the lord and
[1:03:30] the things he endured
[1:03:32] the patience that he had right the lord
[1:03:35] is very pitiful and of tender mercy
[1:03:38] and he goes to talk about something else
[1:03:39] but let's talk about this other part
[1:03:42] he said you have heard of the patience
[1:03:45] of job
[1:03:46] now notice james said amen counted all
[1:03:49] joy when you for a fall in diverse
[1:03:51] temptations
[1:03:52] amen whom the lord lord loveth he
[1:03:54] scourges
[1:03:56] he rebukes he chastens with long
[1:03:59] suffering and gentleness
[1:04:01] how many knows that was exactly what god
[1:04:03] allowed
[1:04:04] job to go through job allowed i mean god
[1:04:08] allowed
[1:04:09] job to suffer
[1:04:13] look at what job went through he lost
[1:04:15] his children
[1:04:16] he lost his stock he lost his farm he
[1:04:20] lost his
[1:04:20] animals you know the animals and all
[1:04:25] that's one thing but all of his children
[1:04:27] in the house and they all collapsed down
[1:04:30] now how many would say that's it that
[1:04:32] i'm done god
[1:04:34] huh my religion must be wrong you're
[1:04:38] you know you're not a great god huh how
[1:04:40] many knows that that's what the
[1:04:42] temptation that brother branham had
[1:04:43] amen when god took his wife and his
[1:04:45] child he devil couldn't tell him there
[1:04:48] ain't no god he knew there was a god but
[1:04:49] he said
[1:04:50] he don't love you in other words he's a
[1:04:53] mean god
[1:04:56] you know what and brother branham that
[1:04:58] is in himself he felt that coming down
[1:05:01] if that's how god's going to be huh
[1:05:04] but he didn't never say it he says the
[1:05:06] lord gave the lord taken away
[1:05:08] blessed be the name of the lord how many
[1:05:12] know
[1:05:12] that took patience that took
[1:05:15] endurance and he had to have something
[1:05:19] out of here
[1:05:20] to be able to endure
[1:05:24] amen and job
[1:05:28] he had to endure he was an endurance
[1:05:33] how many of his wife didn't really pass
[1:05:35] the test did she
[1:05:37] his wife didn't really pass the test she
[1:05:38] says that's it joe
[1:05:40] just curse god and die just get it over
[1:05:43] with this is enough
[1:05:44] i ain't got no more patience
[1:05:47] she didn't have any more patience
[1:05:49] encouraged him
[1:05:51] but job had long patience
[1:05:56] i mean is when somebody smacks you on
[1:05:57] the cheek it takes patience
[1:06:00] somebody does you wrong it takes
[1:06:02] patience
[1:06:03] because if you don't have patience
[1:06:04] you're going to lose it you're right
[1:06:07] never going to work if you don't have
[1:06:08] patience
[1:06:10] amen that's right that's why he says you
[1:06:14] know if somebody takes you to court and
[1:06:15] give by choose you for your coat give
[1:06:18] him your own coat overcoat also
[1:06:20] that if you go on some of these go go
[1:06:22] for mile go with me from
[1:06:23] go with him two miles have extra
[1:06:27] patience
[1:06:28] you got to have patience to be a
[1:06:30] christians you got to have endurance
[1:06:33] if you're going to make it amen
[1:06:35] endurance
[1:06:38] praise the lord endurance
[1:06:41] of joke the patience of job the end of
[1:06:43] the lord amen now
[1:06:47] let's go to the next one
[1:06:52] found over in romans 5
[1:06:56] romans 5 basically just bears this same
[1:06:59] thing out
[1:07:02] it says pretty much the same thing
[1:07:12] therefore being justified by faith we
[1:07:15] have peace with god through our lord
[1:07:16] jesus christ
[1:07:18] by whom also we have access by faith
[1:07:20] into disgrace wherein we stand
[1:07:22] and rejoice in hope of the glory of god
[1:07:26] and not only so hello
[1:07:30] but we also glory in tribulation also
[1:07:35] let me just say what comes to my mind is
[1:07:37] that all right
[1:07:38] maybe we'll be where we're supposed to
[1:07:41] be
[1:07:42] when something bad comes that we can
[1:07:44] actually say thank you lord
[1:07:47] huh thank you lord because i know you
[1:07:50] got this
[1:07:52] i know this is for my good because
[1:07:54] remember this
[1:07:55] nothing is allowed to come into your
[1:07:57] life nothing is allowed to happen to you
[1:07:59] without permission from god first people
[1:08:02] can't do nothing to you
[1:08:03] unless you've got permission so if
[1:08:06] something comes your way
[1:08:07] if we say lord i know you must give
[1:08:10] permission for this to happen to me
[1:08:12] whatever it might be sickness
[1:08:15] disease neighbors yelling at well i
[1:08:18] don't care
[1:08:19] just anything right anything comes your
[1:08:22] way it's allowed
[1:08:24] and when you get to the place to say
[1:08:26] thank you lord
[1:08:27] i know you must have seen that i could
[1:08:29] take this
[1:08:30] thank you jesus man
[1:08:34] we glory we we oh my
[1:08:38] being justified by faith we have peace
[1:08:40] with god by whom we also have
[1:08:41] access into this grace we're in
[1:08:43] restoring and rejoice
[1:08:45] which rejoice in this hope see this
[1:08:47] morning's message is
[1:08:49] a lot of things can be said i've
[1:08:50] preached many a message that'll make you
[1:08:51] feel good it'll
[1:08:52] make you shout it'll make you run up and
[1:08:54] down the aisle and everything else but
[1:08:55] this morning it's geared against
[1:08:57] about endurance and patience it's not
[1:08:59] really that type of service
[1:09:01] huh because when you talk about
[1:09:05] the place that job went the place that
[1:09:07] brother branham went the place said
[1:09:08] brother branham said god takes all of
[1:09:10] his children down to that place to where
[1:09:13] you're either going to serve god or
[1:09:14] you're not we all come to that place
[1:09:16] sooner or later in our life
[1:09:18] we come down to that nitty gritty to
[1:09:20] where look we're either going to say
[1:09:23] boys that ain't right i can't do this or
[1:09:25] we're going to say
[1:09:26] the lord gives the lord takes away
[1:09:28] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:09:30] he brings us all to that testing testing
[1:09:33] ground
[1:09:35] but paul here again he says the same
[1:09:37] thing james really did
[1:09:39] he says we don't just rejoice in the
[1:09:41] hope of the glory of god but not only
[1:09:43] that but we also
[1:09:44] we glory in tribulation also
[1:09:48] knowing that tribulation worketh
[1:09:52] patience huh the trial of your faith
[1:09:56] works patience paul says here that
[1:09:59] tribulation
[1:10:00] works patience
[1:10:03] i'll tell you this right now i i believe
[1:10:05] that it's i believe it's definitely
[1:10:08] something that we should see
[1:10:10] in older people patients
[1:10:14] they've went through it they've seen it
[1:10:16] time and again
[1:10:18] tribulation and and things coming their
[1:10:21] way doesn't shake them anymore it
[1:10:23] doesn't rock them
[1:10:25] amen like it used to
[1:10:29] and i think i can look at faces on here
[1:10:31] everywhere i think most of us can say
[1:10:33] that about ourselves
[1:10:34] you know those problems that we used to
[1:10:36] face that used to shake us
[1:10:37] to the very core they don't shake us
[1:10:39] like they used to anymore
[1:10:41] because we have learned to trust god in
[1:10:43] it
[1:10:44] i mean we have learned to be patient in
[1:10:46] it
[1:10:48] amen somebody else amen gets riled up we
[1:10:51] don't get riled up
[1:10:52] yeah we learned that because we used to
[1:10:55] get it riled up wouldn't take much
[1:10:56] dwellers up
[1:10:57] now it takes a whole lot more
[1:11:01] amen because i know i you know
[1:11:04] i wish i'll say hey there ain't nothing
[1:11:06] that'll ever rile me
[1:11:08] wouldn't that be nice to say that but
[1:11:10] unless you have went through some
[1:11:11] extreme things and kept you cool all the
[1:11:13] way through
[1:11:14] can't really say that because we're
[1:11:16] limited
[1:11:17] and if we aren't really strong in the
[1:11:19] lord we're limited but now we should be
[1:11:21] limited
[1:11:22] amen not we should be unlimited should i
[1:11:25] say we should be there no matter what it
[1:11:27] is
[1:11:27] we just stay steady right in it
[1:11:30] amen that's i believe why paul said this
[1:11:34] about tribulation that we are the glory
[1:11:36] and tribulation because it
[1:11:37] teaches to be patient just keep patience
[1:11:42] now now and then most of the time you
[1:11:43] read this it talks about
[1:11:45] faith and patience because you're
[1:11:47] without faith it's hard to be patient
[1:11:49] you got to have faith and then be
[1:11:51] patient and then watch god work
[1:11:54] amen just like the three hebrew children
[1:11:56] how many knows they had patience
[1:12:02] you know they that weighed on the lord
[1:12:04] those that are patiently waiting on the
[1:12:06] lord
[1:12:07] the lord didn't come until they went
[1:12:09] down over the edge
[1:12:11] no that's not true that is not true
[1:12:15] right because those
[1:12:18] soldiers that were taken up to the edge
[1:12:21] it was so hot that it killed them
[1:12:24] so i would say that at the beginning of
[1:12:28] the temperature change from the natural
[1:12:31] air
[1:12:32] to where it started to get hot that's
[1:12:34] where the lord came
[1:12:36] because they didn't get burnt walking up
[1:12:37] to it they didn't even get a cinched
[1:12:39] hair
[1:12:39] going all the way up to there so the
[1:12:41] lord was there ready
[1:12:43] he was there at that temperature he was
[1:12:45] there and when they went all the way in
[1:12:47] and thrown in
[1:12:50] man i wonder how they landed brother man
[1:12:53] how did they land
[1:12:56] did the lord how deep was it
[1:12:59] how deep was the pit how far down
[1:13:01] because you know they could have landed
[1:13:02] on their head
[1:13:03] anyway but i don't think so maya i tend
[1:13:05] to believe that they had a nice soft
[1:13:07] landing
[1:13:08] the lord bore him up just set him down
[1:13:10] there
[1:13:12] huh and that big old white hot
[1:13:16] flames flame shooting out the big big
[1:13:19] uh uh stove whatever was huge
[1:13:22] pit whatever it was you know and it says
[1:13:25] that guess what
[1:13:26] they were having like me and my wife
[1:13:28] last few days had a little fire there by
[1:13:30] the
[1:13:30] get some logs you know just hit by the
[1:13:32] fire they was walking around all of them
[1:13:34] hot fired
[1:13:35] he says i see the fourth man walking
[1:13:38] around
[1:13:39] they were all just walking around
[1:13:40] enjoying the breeze
[1:13:42] it's all just fine huh
[1:13:45] they had patience they waited on the
[1:13:47] lord and he may not have come to the
[1:13:49] last minute but he came right on time
[1:13:52] same way with daniel he had patience on
[1:13:55] god
[1:13:56] amen how many believes you've got to be
[1:13:59] patient
[1:14:00] on god amen
[1:14:03] be patient be that weight on the lord
[1:14:05] shall renew their strength
[1:14:07] they shall mount up with wings as eagles
[1:14:09] they shall run
[1:14:10] and not be weary they shall walk and not
[1:14:13] faint
[1:14:15] amen praise the lord endurance
[1:14:19] and haitians all right
[1:14:24] so it says knowing that tribulation
[1:14:26] workers patience
[1:14:28] and patience experience
[1:14:36] hallelujah i like that word
[1:14:41] experience since
[1:14:44] venom talked about going to the hospital
[1:14:47] and having your
[1:14:49] maybe a kidney removed or a liver
[1:14:52] operation something really
[1:14:54] big and a young guy comes in there
[1:14:59] looks at me about 25 years old right
[1:15:02] and you ask him well how many times have
[1:15:04] you done this
[1:15:06] he says it's my first time
[1:15:09] i think i can do this
[1:15:13] no experience right you know maybe he's
[1:15:16] watched it
[1:15:16] many times but he's never had to cut it
[1:15:18] himself the man says there's an older
[1:15:21] guy
[1:15:21] that's standard hundreds of times that's
[1:15:23] the one i want to do
[1:15:25] that's the one i want to say all right
[1:15:27] you cut on me
[1:15:29] why because he's got experience
[1:15:32] amen that's a whole lot like preachers
[1:15:36] and when we were young we cut that knife
[1:15:38] and man we stabbed and cut
[1:15:42] we don't do so well but as you get older
[1:15:44] you learn to cut a little easier
[1:15:46] am i right and with christians as a
[1:15:48] general how many knows you
[1:15:49] you know you get somebody up come go to
[1:15:52] somebody in one console from them or
[1:15:53] whatever it is and
[1:15:54] and you know what do you think about
[1:15:55] this that or the other and they can tell
[1:15:57] you well this is what my experience is
[1:15:59] huh and it'll be good and it's good to
[1:16:02] get
[1:16:02] get counsel from father somebody that's
[1:16:05] got experience
[1:16:06] and that's what paul said that
[1:16:09] tribulation work of patience
[1:16:11] and patience gives you experience
[1:16:15] amen a little more comes on that
[1:16:18] talk about david how many knows that
[1:16:20] david he had an experience on the back
[1:16:22] side of the desert so when he came to
[1:16:24] saul
[1:16:25] amen he says this is my experience amen
[1:16:28] i've had an experience with the lord and
[1:16:30] i know that he'll deliver that guy
[1:16:32] you know and he could tell him of a
[1:16:34] previous thing that he happened
[1:16:36] amen with the lion and the bear and then
[1:16:38] you could have confidence hey this guy
[1:16:39] knows what he's talking about
[1:16:40] because he went through the experience
[1:16:43] how many knows we need that we as
[1:16:45] christians
[1:16:46] every one of us this morning need that
[1:16:48] if you're ever going to
[1:16:49] lead somebody to the lord if you're ever
[1:16:51] going to be a witness for christ you
[1:16:53] have to have experience
[1:16:55] amen we only get that as the lord allows
[1:16:57] things to come our way
[1:16:59] praise the lord all right now one more
[1:17:03] thing so
[1:17:03] patient works experience and experience
[1:17:08] hope amen
[1:17:11] i actually like the work faith a little
[1:17:13] better but paul used the word hope
[1:17:16] because i'll tell you what we know is
[1:17:17] that when david had the experience of
[1:17:20] the lion and the bear
[1:17:22] he had hoped that god would also deliver
[1:17:24] him
[1:17:25] or faith that god would also deliver him
[1:17:27] from the giant
[1:17:28] amen so he it worked hope
[1:17:32] it gives you you just know that god is
[1:17:35] there
[1:17:36] praise the lord you like that all right
[1:17:40] that's romans 4. romans 5 i mean sorry

[1:17:56] ok this is about approving ourselves
[1:18:01] approving ourselves and or should i say
[1:18:05] being approved
[1:18:12] how many knows the devil got impatient
[1:18:13] in heaven he didn't like it there
[1:18:14] anymore
[1:18:15] he wasn't happy with the situation he
[1:18:18] got impatient
[1:18:20] he had no patience he wanted something
[1:18:22] different
[1:18:23] i don't know about you but i believe god
[1:18:25] wants to live with people
[1:18:26] that have patience all right
[1:18:32] i wonder i have one here

[1:19:08] god the god of patience
[1:19:12] he's the god of patience all right

[1:19:16] for whatsoever things were written
[1:19:18] before time
[1:19:20] were written for our learning
[1:19:23] that we through patience
[1:19:26] right and comfort of the scriptures
[1:19:29] might have amen so how many knows do we
[1:19:32] read these scriptures we read the bibles
[1:19:34] like we
[1:19:35] mentioned this morning and we bring it
[1:19:37] brings us comfort
[1:19:38] in the scriptures as we look at these
[1:19:41] people who through
[1:19:42] patience obtained the promises now might
[1:19:46] have hope
[1:19:46] now verse 5 now the god of patience
[1:19:50] and consolation grant you to be
[1:19:53] like-minded one towards another
[1:19:55] according
[1:19:56] to christ jesus amen
[1:20:00] so he calls him the god of patience may
[1:20:02] con give you consolation
[1:20:04] now let's go to second corinthians
[1:20:20] second corinthians 6.
[1:20:32] we'll begin with verse 4. but on all
[1:20:35] things
[1:20:36] approving ourselves as the ministers of
[1:20:39] god
[1:20:40] in much patience
[1:20:43] i mean with paul he really had to have a
[1:20:45] lot of patience didn't he
[1:20:47] oh my all right approving ourselves
[1:20:52] notice in much patience in afflictions
[1:20:55] we prove ourselves in afflictions in
[1:20:58] necessities
[1:20:59] he knew what it's like to need things i
[1:21:01] mean a lot of times that's when we get
[1:21:03] impatient when
[1:21:04] we don't get what we want when we don't
[1:21:06] have something that we want
[1:21:08] in distresses amen
[1:21:11] in stripes in imprisonments
[1:21:16] in in tumults labors
[1:21:20] watchings in fastings
[1:21:24] by pureness by knowledge by long
[1:21:26] suffering by kindness
[1:21:28] by the holy ghost by love on frame
[1:21:32] by the word of truth by the power of god
[1:21:36] by the armor of righteousness on the
[1:21:38] right hand on the left
[1:21:40] by honor and dishonor
[1:21:43] by evil report and good report in other
[1:21:46] words if definitely say
[1:21:47] something good about you or bad about
[1:21:49] you amen
[1:21:51] as deceivers and yet true
[1:21:55] as unknown and yet well known
[1:21:58] as dying and behold we live
[1:22:02] as chastened and not killed
[1:22:06] as sorrowful yet always rejoicing
[1:22:10] as poor but yet making many rich
[1:22:13] as having nothing and yet possessing all
[1:22:17] things
[1:22:18] oh ye corinthians our mouth is open unto
[1:22:20] you our heart is
[1:22:21] enlarged so you see paul here saying
[1:22:24] that
[1:22:25] we are approved by pray by patience and
[1:22:28] tribulation necessities
[1:22:32] god just didn't promise the believer a
[1:22:34] flowery bit of ease
[1:22:36] he promised that he would give you
[1:22:38] things that you have to endure
[1:22:40] and right now folks how many knows that
[1:22:42] we're enduring unto the end
[1:22:45] amen because there's one thing that
[1:22:47] we're looking for
[1:22:50] a world where we never get old
[1:22:54] a world where we never die a world where
[1:22:56] we never have gray hair
[1:22:58] a world where we'll never have sickness
[1:23:00] or death
[1:23:02] amen eternal life let me believe this
[1:23:04] surprise
[1:23:06] is eternal life that's what we're
[1:23:08] looking for
[1:23:09] and one of these days we're going to see
[1:23:12] it
[1:23:13] in closing i actually have one more
[1:23:16] scripture and then we'll go back to the
[1:23:18] closing scripture
[1:23:20] it's found in hebrews 10.
[1:23:23] hebrews 10.
[1:23:29] paul says that ye have need
[1:23:32] of patience amen
[1:23:36] there's another one i think it talks
[1:23:38] about how that
[1:23:39] we're to follow those who through
[1:23:41] patience obtained the promises
[1:23:43] how many of those that's how you get
[1:23:44] things by being patient
[1:23:46] you reach your goal you reach your goal
[1:23:50] by being patient if you're going to
[1:23:51] florida it's a long haul i don't like
[1:23:53] that long haul
[1:23:54] all the way to florida but guess what if
[1:23:56] i stop in macon
[1:23:57] i'm never going to get there i get to
[1:24:00] make it oh is it just too far i can't do
[1:24:02] it huh
[1:24:03] no that's the way it is at this
[1:24:04] christian walk oh it's just too far too
[1:24:06] hard no
[1:24:07] i can't make it no you gotta go all the
[1:24:10] way
[1:24:11] let me just say this that this is one of
[1:24:12] the things that i did want to say
[1:24:14] you know what makes it to where you can
[1:24:16] endure
[1:24:17] what makes it that you can endure is if
[1:24:21] it is what you are amen
[1:24:24] the pharisees they acted like something
[1:24:26] they weren't you know right
[1:24:28] but if christianity and the love of god
[1:24:30] is in your heart
[1:24:31] you love it he's more than life to you
[1:24:34] amen but if somebody doesn't really love
[1:24:37] the lord isn't really born again guess
[1:24:39] what
[1:24:39] you're gonna not gonna be able to endure
[1:24:42] because the love of it isn't in there
[1:24:44] it has to be in here amen okay so
[1:24:47] hebrews 10
[1:24:50] and verse
[1:24:54] 35 it says cast not away therefore your
[1:24:57] confidence which have great recompense
[1:24:59] of reward
[1:25:01] for ye have need of patience that
[1:25:04] after you have done the will of god you
[1:25:06] might receive the promise
[1:25:08] isn't that the way it's going to work
[1:25:10] after you've been patient
[1:25:11] waiting on the coming of the lord amen
[1:25:15] that you might receive the promise for
[1:25:17] yet a little while and he that shall
[1:25:19] come
[1:25:20] will come amen
[1:25:23] oh people want to say there ain't no god
[1:25:25] he ain't coming i'm here to tell you
[1:25:27] he's going to come he's going to arrive
[1:25:30] like that woman that little girl
[1:25:32] amen that was out west and waiting on
[1:25:34] that young man to come and pick her up
[1:25:36] they might have said ah he ain't coming
[1:25:38] to get you he ain't coming to get you
[1:25:40] she was there at the gate
[1:25:41] at that day at 12 o'clock and she was
[1:25:43] waiting for him
[1:25:45] that's what you and i are doing
[1:25:46] patiently waiting on the coming of the
[1:25:47] lord
[1:25:48] yet a little while he that shall come
[1:25:50] will come and will not tarry
[1:25:52] now the just shall live by faith but if
[1:25:55] any man draw back
[1:25:56] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[1:25:59] but we are not of them that draw back
[1:26:00] unto partition but
[1:26:02] of them that believing to the saving of
[1:26:05] the soul
[1:26:07] amen let's go to james back to james one
[1:26:11] james 5 i believe it is where i was
[1:26:13] reading that i wanted to
[1:26:15] close with james 5.
[1:26:27] and verse 7 be patient therefore
[1:26:31] brethren unto the coming of the lord
[1:26:34] amen so how many beliefs that's what
[1:26:35] we're going to have to do
[1:26:37] just keep steady keep planting your
[1:26:39] potatoes keep doing what you're doing
[1:26:40] serving the lord
[1:26:41] be patient unto the coming of the lord
[1:26:45] behold the husbandman wadeth for the
[1:26:47] precious
[1:26:48] fruit of the earth and have long
[1:26:51] patience
[1:26:51] for it until he received the earlier
[1:26:53] latter rain
[1:26:54] so i wanted to talk about that for just
[1:26:56] a few minutes
[1:26:58] the lord can you imagine how patient god
[1:27:01] is
[1:27:03] huh
[1:27:07] because brother branham help me note
[1:27:08] that the saints of this age
[1:27:10] when you die you go into a certain place
[1:27:13] about 20 feet up
[1:27:15] the ramp says when he was in his bed
[1:27:16] he's seen all of those people they were
[1:27:18] about to he got he was caught up
[1:27:19] about 20 feet up into another dimension
[1:27:22] and there were
[1:27:23] all the people of this age there but yet
[1:27:26] he wanted to see the lord
[1:27:29] and he uh the angel says you can't see
[1:27:31] him
[1:27:32] how many knows they don't get to see him
[1:27:34] until we get to see him
[1:27:37] because he's up a little higher he's in
[1:27:39] a in another dimension
[1:27:42] higher amen on the mercy seat isn't that
[1:27:45] right he's on that mercy
[1:27:46] seat interceding for the saints
[1:27:49] and as long as he's on that inner
[1:27:51] interceding chair
[1:27:52] amen uh there's still mercy to be had
[1:27:55] the last one hasn't come in yet
[1:27:58] and now how many knows that not just the
[1:28:00] last 2 000 years but
[1:28:02] what jesus went to calvary for what he
[1:28:05] endured the cross for
[1:28:06] amen he's interceding amen and he's
[1:28:09] working in every one of our lives how
[1:28:12] many knows it's the lord
[1:28:14] working in every one of our lives and he
[1:28:16] is redeeming us back to himself
[1:28:19] giving us the holy ghost giving of his
[1:28:21] spirit
[1:28:23] but he doesn't actually get to come
[1:28:26] and physically be with us until the
[1:28:29] rapture happens
[1:28:31] now let me ask you something god having
[1:28:34] before there was one star out there
[1:28:37] before the first moon or the sun before
[1:28:39] anything was created
[1:28:40] god had a plan in his mind all right
[1:28:44] and here we are at the almost at the
[1:28:46] very
[1:28:47] end of the whole plan
[1:28:51] as far as this universe is concerned
[1:28:55] because we know god's plan isn't
[1:28:56] finished we know that there's going to
[1:28:57] be
[1:28:58] amen the whole earth is going to fur be
[1:29:00] burnt with fervent heat all the wick and
[1:29:02] then it's going to burn up
[1:29:03] going to be ashes under the soles of
[1:29:05] your feet there's going to be a
[1:29:06] millennium we're going to have a
[1:29:07] millennium title
[1:29:09] it's not the end of the plan but it's
[1:29:11] the end of the plan for humanity as we
[1:29:14] know it
[1:29:15] it meant for the realm of testing and
[1:29:18] the realm of
[1:29:19] molding and shaping us in the image of
[1:29:21] christ and getting us ready to meet the
[1:29:23] lord and
[1:29:24] making us fit to live and rule with him
[1:29:26] for a thousand years
[1:29:28] we're almost at the end of that plan
[1:29:31] right
[1:29:31] but he has been waiting can we say for 6
[1:29:35] 000 years
[1:29:36] the lord has been waiting to what
[1:29:40] to reap the harvest and to be with
[1:29:44] you and me hey we want to be with the
[1:29:47] lord
[1:29:48] but he wants to be with us can you
[1:29:51] imagine how much
[1:29:52] more even so perhaps he wants to be with
[1:29:54] us because he went and shed his blood
[1:29:56] for us he
[1:29:56] paid for the price of our sins to be
[1:29:58] covered in sins
[1:30:00] and put in the sea of his forgetfulness
[1:30:02] and he says he has much
[1:30:04] patience waiting for that harvest time
[1:30:07] but
[1:30:07] he is waiting also to be with you and me
[1:30:10] he's being real patient that's a lot of
[1:30:12] patience and i thought when i was
[1:30:14] writing this i thought how anxious
[1:30:18] and i know that god ain't anxious but
[1:30:20] it's the best word i know of to use to
[1:30:21] try to describe
[1:30:23] how the lord must feel about wanting to
[1:30:25] be with us
[1:30:27] the one that he purchased one that he
[1:30:28] paid for the one that he's got
[1:30:30] all of his life
[1:30:34] i don't know how to describe it other
[1:30:35] than that little girl that was out west
[1:30:37] if you remember and the boy
[1:30:39] had asked her to marry him isn't that
[1:30:41] right and then he went and built her a
[1:30:43] home isn't that right
[1:30:44] he went build her a home and he didn't
[1:30:46] see her for here for a whole year
[1:30:48] can you imagine how anxious he was when
[1:30:50] those
[1:30:52] horse hooves finally got were hurt
[1:30:54] coming up over the hills and down
[1:30:55] through the valleys
[1:30:56] and they were just coming off that jeep
[1:30:58] i bet he had them horses on full speed
[1:31:01] he wanted to go get his wife he wanted
[1:31:04] to be live with his wife he wanted his
[1:31:06] wife with him
[1:31:06] and that's the way god is with us god is
[1:31:09] looking forward to having us
[1:31:11] with him and he has certainly been
[1:31:15] a patient god he is the god of all
[1:31:18] patients
[1:31:19] amen and he's looking forward to being
[1:31:22] with you
[1:31:23] and me amen how many in your heart say
[1:31:25] lord help me to be patient until you're
[1:31:27] coming
[1:31:28] don't let me get impatient lord and help
[1:31:31] me to display this patience
[1:31:33] in my life and in every area of our my
[1:31:35] life amen
[1:31:37] how many would say that every area of my
[1:31:38] life help me lord to display patience
[1:31:41] be able to go through things and have
[1:31:43] experience and show
[1:31:44] experience and have the hope of god
[1:31:46] resting in my heart
[1:31:47] god bless you stand with you with me if
[1:31:50] you will this morning musicians if
[1:31:51] you'll come
[1:31:58] god is good isn't he homie just loves
[1:32:01] him with all your heart
[1:32:03] amen he certainly is good let's bow our
[1:32:06] heads
[1:32:07] talk to him once again lord jesus as we
[1:32:11] have
[1:32:11] looked at your precious word lord and we
[1:32:13] have seen lord in the scriptures where
[1:32:15] you have pain
[1:32:17] patience father for waiting for the
[1:32:20] earlier and the latter rain god and we
[1:32:22] know that that latter rain has already
[1:32:24] come

[1:32:26] watered lord jesus and it's bringing
[1:32:28] forth
[1:32:29] dear children once more lord lord
[1:32:31] redeeming us to you lord and on that day
[1:32:34] lord jesus we just wonder lord and we
[1:32:36] just imagine father how
[1:32:37] glorious it is going to be lord to be
[1:32:40] able to see you face to
[1:32:42] face and to talk to you personally lord
[1:32:45] and no doubt but we'll have so many
[1:32:46] times that we'll be saying
