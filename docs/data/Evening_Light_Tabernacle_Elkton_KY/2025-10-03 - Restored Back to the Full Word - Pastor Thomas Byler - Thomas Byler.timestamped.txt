[0:00] And he shall turn the hearts of the
[0:02] fathers to the children.
[0:05] Period.
[0:08] 2,000 years go by in this verse.
[0:14] Is that right?
[0:17] And the heart of the children, which is
[0:19] us, the fathers was the Israelites.
[0:23] They were the fathers supposed to come
[0:25] to the children.
[0:27] Yeah. Now we're come to a place where
[0:30] Amen. the children's hearts have to be
[0:32] turned back to the fathers. Woo.
[0:38] Amen. They just say, "Well, God done it.
[0:41] He did it. That's right. I'm a part of
[0:44] the fulfillment of this scripture.
[0:48] That's why he sent Elijah. That's why
[0:50] the prophet came to make you and to
[0:52] bring your heart, to bring your faith,
[0:54] to bring your life, to bring everything
[0:56] about you back the way they were back on
[1:00] the day of Pentecost,
[1:03] completely restored,
[1:06] back to the fullness of the word. I
[1:08] mean, it's a restoration message. If
[1:11] there's a prophecy that all that the
[1:13] canker worm is eating, all the
[1:15] caterpillar and all the locust, but he
[1:17] said, "I will restore," sayaith the
[1:20] Lord.
[1:22] Hallelujah.
[1:25] Amen. Not some day going by, what's
[1:27] going on? What's the matter with them
[1:29] people? I'll tell you what's the matter
[1:31] with me. I've been restored.
[1:36] [Music]
[1:37] That's why we believe in there's one
[1:39] Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God
[1:42] and Father who is above all and in you
[1:44] all and all through you all. Like Paul
[1:47] said, there by one spirit are we all
[1:49] baptized into one body.
[1:54] Restored back to what the Paul said, the
[1:57] way that Paul taught it.
