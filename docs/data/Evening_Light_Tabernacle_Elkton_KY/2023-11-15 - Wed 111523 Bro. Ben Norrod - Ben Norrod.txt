now I'm not a teenager anymore and I I looking looking back behind me and there's so many good things that God has done for me to give up on Christ now wouldn't make sense not at all all the blessings he's ever laid in our laps and all the things that he does for us on a daily basis he does things for us daily that we we don't even know sometimes I think the things that God does for us it just goes right Beyond us and in the secret parts of our life God is working all the time and Jesus is making sure that we are absolutely taken care of and why in the world why in the world why in the world anybody want to quit right now I don't know now's the sweet time this is the good time when all the good stuff is coming our way amen so we love the Lord um one more if it's okay I'm going to try I'm

into the preach word of the Lord ain't he good to us can't even walk without him holding my hand so grateful the Lord holds our hand aren't you amen certainly uh appreciate the Lord tonight and I want to say quickly thank you to brother berer for allowing us to come by we uh we've been trying to put together some time together and then it just had my schedule and his schedule haven't been able to cooperate so if you haven't seen me for a while it ain't because anybody's mad at anybody or anything's negative was having just busy people for the Lord and uh but I'm thrilled when I got the text to say hey would you could be able to come by and I was able to I was just thrilled about it and uh I I guess you all know how I feel about you I love every one of you and I enjoy getting to come here and preach the word of the Lord to you now I want to try if God will help me I've got several places that I'm going to try to go and I'm going to be very mindful at that time I'm I'm I'm bad about a clock and I don't mean to be but I am sometimes but um I I want to see if we can't maybe talk tonight a little bit about how we can obtain the favor of the Lord how do I know that I've got God favor and so if you have your Bible let's start in Isaiah chapter 64 verse 6 I'll read just one verse there and then we're going to skip over momentarily over to um uh go backwards to the Book of Genesis for just a bit my the Lord is so good to us is it good to be in church on a Wednesday I love Wednesday church one of my favorites it's one of the people you know you really make an effort and you really have to kind of work at it to get to church you know that and uh Wednesdays are they're they're a special time I really feel like the Lord speaks to the people lot almost more personally in some ways on Wednesdays than he does a Sunday get a lot of other people in you know maybe they're not is committed or dedicated and they used to say that the Wednesday night crowd that's the real crowd of the church you know what I'm talking about that's the real committed ones amen so maybe that's true maybe that's true all right Isaiah 64 verse 6 and then uh uh you know maybe I'll just quote Genesis to you we we I won't make you read that much Isaiah 646 but we are all as an unclean thing and all of our righteousnesses look at that in the plural are as filthy rags and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away now the word he uses here for unclean in the original Hebrew is to be unclean or impure both ethically and religiously and what that means when you say ethically means your morals the kind of person you are your behaviors of Life patterns of life so in everything that a person does no matter how they was raised no matter who their parents were no matter what kind of home they come from everything in their life is unclean in the eyes of God so you could be raised in a message home be raised in a message Church be raised around the truth and the eyes of God still unclean why it takes the new birth to fix that but then you flip that little coin over and on the other side you've got the religious side of it now whether we realize this or not people religion can absolutely make you unclean in the presence of the Lord wrong religion false religion false Doctrine things that are doctrines of devils we would say those things can absolutely make you unclean before the presence of the Lord because remember doctrines of devils come in a religious form come through religious organizations and those things but greater than that spirits that motivate those things can also make us Sun clean as well and those kind of spirits are the very things that show up around the ranks of the truth we believe so just because we're not Methodist Baptist Presbyterian over the door like that doesn't mean we can't be unclean and it doesn't mean we don't need to be delivered of even religious hpe Spirits let's let's pray over the word can we heavenly father thank you so much for the opportunity to come back into your house Lord It's just so nice to be back here with the people in Elton and I just pray that you'll come and take your word this evening Lord and that you'll just so speak to us God that we'll be able to just kind of for this little moment of time that you give us just to be able to set aside all the weights and the things of the day that Lord would weigh on us father May the Holy Spirit I pray just come into this little church tonight not only anoint your word to our hearts to be able to speak it that that we might be a conduit if you would uh Channel Lord Jesus even but father that you would open up every heart Lord don't let us just sit here and hear but let us be able to receive it I pray and then Lord may you anoint that deep within our spirits that it'll bring change to us change positive change that'll make us more like you for Lord we are so very thankful for the grace you show to us and Lord I'm humbled tonight to be able to stand before this great body of people Lord you know I love these people so very much and I pray that you'll bless them in a great way be brother sister b as they travel in the different ones and the needs of the body and help us now in the word as we commit this to you now Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen all of the Saints said am amen you may be seated may the Lord bless you amen we certainly thank the Lord for uh the reading of the Bible I like the Bible don't you I like it it's a beautiful beautiful written body of God and the work that the Lord put into making this accessible to us you know it's hard for some people to understand why that people would appreciate is this but the Revelation thereof that comes from the Bible just gives us all of the answers that we have need of in this last time to know where we come from who we are and where we're headed to in a little while and I think every answer that we have need of is laying right in the word of God whatever question you might have or whatever thought you might have about something in the word of God there there's always a Bible answer if there's a Bible question brother B said it there has to be a Bible answer somewhere because God's word don't return back to us void and you know I I I I look at this in Isaiah 64 and I I see many many many many different things that I'm confronted with as I travel and believe me what I tell you I could stand here the entire night and just tell one story after another about churches and the conditions they get into and people and their mindsets and on and on and on and and and quite honestly it would be nice to hear it but it doesn't really answer the question that we need to ask tonight and I I don't want to use this as a platform tonight to just basically you know pin us down that we are unclean people and that you know we need the Holy Ghost I I think you know I've preached to you long enough the last 20 years brother B brother Brad and these different men of God have preached to you long enough that I'm pretty sure you know already kind of where you stand there but what I want to do is I want to use this scripture as a uh kind of a a springboard if you will into answering this question about how do I obtain the favor of God and so let me go ahead and answer it early now if this was a big Evangelistic meeting I'd make you wait three days before I answer this question but I figured that I'd be nice to you you're tired you've worked all day I'll go ahead and answer it ahead of time the answer is you cannot obtain the favor of God it's impossible within yourself there's no way that you could be living close enough or whatever it might be to God would show favor to you in the way of yourself because this scripture this Bible verse tells us that all of us are in an unclean situation so then then we have to ask the question to follow that okay then how could God show favor to me how does the Lord give his favor to me how do I become a child that is favorable his eyes now when I went back and I did a little study on this uh word favor I you know sometimes as a minister you'll Chase maybe a an idea of something down through the Bible or through the message and you know a lot of times you see repetitive things that you know and you've read it a thousand times and oh yes I know that I know that's right and so forth but I was surprised when I got to looking at this word favor that 156 times in the New Testament everywhere you would find favor Grace would be right there by it and when I saw that it's like the light bulbs come on and everything lit up around me and I understood this is the answer to the question tonight about the favor of God it all comes to the grace that God has given to all of us before the foundation of the world before we could become Sinners before our family lme family tree and all of that he gave us Grace to be the kind of people that we need to be now saying all of that you know a Believer I know that it kindly puts us in a bit of a spot because you know you hear so much preaching on the legalistic side of it or on the work side of it that you got to live right and live clean and live holy and you and I both I think we've been acquainted enough with each other through the years that we both know where we stand there that the Holy Spirit wants you to live right and live clean and be a Christian but that within itself does not get God's attention nor obtain his favor someone that knows how to dress right could absolutely know know how to dress right and be absolutely a sinner and still in their heart somebody that knows how to do all the talking and the terminology and have all the doctrines figured out they could do all of that and even Paul said I could have all of that figured out and still not have the love of God inside my heart so there are elements of living right that's true and we believe in that and we want to live right we want to be Christians in that way but when it comes to obtaining the favor of God there is nothing that you and I can do within ourselves because of this scripture right here to ever obtain that within ourselves being born off the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil immediately and absolutely puts us in a position where we are not able to match that part of God's holiness there's no way our birth our natural first birth takes us out of that category altogether which is why Jesus had to come be virgin born so that he could take upon himself the ability to bridge that Chasm between man and God so then we see that when the Holy Spirit then would say to us that we would have his favor he's saying to us that you have my grace and my grace is my favor to you I'm so glad about that I don't even know how to explain how it makes me feel that God's favor is the favor of God or the grace of God that not only keeps me living right but every time I would decide or think you know maybe I I would go this way or that way or choose this road or that road the favor of God the grace of God is what keeps me right smack in the middle of the will of God aren't you glad for that friends because without that where would you be without God's grace and favor upon you what decision would you have made even this week perhaps that would have taken you completely away from your walk with God from the presence of the Lord or whatever it might be the Lord Jesus is determined to make sure that the people of God have the ability to serve him no matter what's going on around them no matter what is inside of them no matter what family battles they might have personal battles they might have mental battles they might have Jesus is determined that you and I will be able to serve him at full capacity he wants us to be able to express oursel as true believers in the Holy Ghost his favor is what brings us there because your Works cannot keep you there your Works may put you in a place where I'm doing pretty good this week but your Works cannot keep you there Hallelujah and praise the Lord I haven't been gone so long from you You' forgotten how to say Amen have you aha okay all right all right just checking just making sure checking the water the temperature you know because this is something that really kind of gets next to some people because they think well to get God's favor and to Lord for him to show favor to me for healing or some other thing like that I've got to live to such a place to where God's just going to oh my he's is going to look at me and think what a boy what a girl you might achieve that this week by next week it's gone you may achieve it and within five minutes completely fail it so God's favor is based upon that we're all in trouble so God cannot base his favor upon those things now if you're reading from The Book of Genesis I'll just give you the scripture just to kind of highlight the scripture for you and you can write this down Genesis 18:3 when God is when Abraham is speaking back to God he said now my Lord if I have found favor in thy sight he said pass not away if I found favor in thy sight so in other words Abraham making this very simple statement that if I have found favor in your sight now now now think about this for just a moment the father of our faith I'm about Father Abraham the foundation and the basis of Christianity the the Covenant that God made with this man was not based upon him as a human being because not only would Abraham lie the first time around but after his name would be changed he'd lie the second time he would have all kinds of little fears and things that would be accompanied with the the the whole scene of this you know body change and Isaac coming along and then here he is nice and strong and healthy and all this going on and Sarah says uh take Hagar and he says okay yeah sure no problem now you I looking at that we think what's the matter with this man doesn't doesn't he have any idea how God has talked to him all along about Isaac and yet here this wild man is being produced oh you're going to be in hard trouble there legalist if you kind of hold to those works it's going to put you in a bad spot because then here you got God coming along not not long after we see the establishment of Abraham in his faith say I could swear by no greater so therefore I swore by the only one I could me God said I swore by myself we know already that he cannot trust our fair weather Behavior woo preach to me somebody we already know that he can't put confidence in our ups and our Downs cuz whether we're born again or not that do not really the part of it we we live in this outer realm holy ghost or not every human being lives in this outer realm whether it's sunny days and rainy days and windy days and we go through all of that every person on this Earth has trials tribulations and problems and ups and down everybody you talk to has got an issue everybody you meet in the store out on your job or something like that everybody you meet has got a problem somewhere but the difference between them and us is we have an anchor beyond the veils and that's what holds us which is different than everybody else amen hallelujah which is what puts us in the condition of having God's favor not just when everything is going well but when everything is going bad too and the church said amen right now let's look at something for just a moment now in a message called works that I do brother R says that if I had Divine love and Fa favor of God that the Lord would give gifts into the person I want you to think about this in in in the way of gifted people a lot of times s when you see gifts in operation folks have a tendency to kind of almost view somebody that is gifted as though that they are special in the eyes of the Lord in comparison to somebody else they view brother Bram a lot this way that brother Brown was a special Christian that had special things that nobody else had and somehow brother Brown must have had a different Holy Ghost than you and I had or a different New Birth than you and I had his new birth was special ours is just kind of the hand-me-down version that we get just barely to make it through the way that they exalt this prophet and place him way up so high on this pestal like this it goes to prove that their idea of God's favor is a respective person's type favor amen you'll see a lot of that in churches certain families you know that the Lord they blessed them or gift them or something like that if folks are not careful friends and practice the proper kind of humility that a Christian needs to practice they can intimidate other people in the church to make them feel like that they do not have favor with God the same as they do so gifts have to be understood you have to understand that A Gifted person or a gifted family or a gifted life that is not a sign that God's favor is greater in them than it is greater in you God's favor or his grace May provide the ability for them to uh exercise or demonstrate a gift or do something for the Lord but that is not the same kind of Grace that is applied when it comes to their soul because Grace a gift a person pardon me could send themselves to hell with the Divine gift of God they could absolutely send themselves to hell with a Divine gift gifted people don't mean save people praise the Lord gifted people don't always mean spiritual people I'm waiting on you now now think about it we look at so many gifted people and we say oh my they must have some special relationship with God do you realize that all of the experiences that brother Ram had it might have been different but it wasn't greater the experiences I've had with the Lord are just as precious to me as every experience he ever had with God and just because he saw visions and talked to angels that doesn't make it greater or better than when the Lord Jesus met me as a sinner boy and filled me with the Holy Ghost and the multiple times that he has talked to me and led me and showed me things that succumb it means just as much to me as it did to brother Brandon even though the experiences may be a little different here or there not one is greater than the other now in terms of office Behavior now you're getting into a different thing you're leaving this idea of God's favor and now you're talking about God's adoption adoption is based upon your behavior you want God to trust you you got to show them you can that's right but you can be saved even if you're not behaving well how many Sinners do you know that got the Holy Ghost they wasn't behaving like they should still had a lot of things to fix probably didn't know what the right Behavior was about nothing and yet the Lord filled him with the Holy Ghost anyways that has nothing to do with salvation forgive me it's not of works that any man can boast amen but if I want to show God that I can be placed as a son but it can trust me put now I got to behave right I got to repent keep things out of my heart sure brother office was higher than mine his office was higher than yours but his holy ghost wasn't amen same Holy Ghost Paul Peter Donn James all them same Holy Ghost James was a Pastor Peter was an evangelist an apostle Paul was the messenger of the age all same Holy Ghost different offices offices does not mean that you are better or less than somebody else uhuh oh don't don't don't get in a hurry now I'm not going to rush this one I want this to sink in good we will look at ourselves well I'm just a little old house wife that doesn't mean you have less of God's favor uhhuh doesn't mean that God looks at you differently excuse me he doesn't God does not look at you differently as a housewife or a painter or a factory worker or a preacher or a prophet amen you're all the same to him there's one body of Christ that members in particular he even went on and said that there's not even male or female in the body of Christ come on don't get quiet on me when it comes to my office I have a position that a a role if you will that I have to play a part that God gives me but that has nothing to do with his Divine favor toward me as his son uhuh oh but you say brother BNA but as Christians aren't we supposed to you know be these powerful people yeah are we supposed to have third pool spoken word power yeah I supposed to have all that too what about the ability to be able to restore missing limbs all of that comes through obedience to Christ in a daily walk listen close but if someone walked up here right now missing a limb and 10 or 15 of us got together through prayer spoke the word of God and a limb was restored right here in front of us that has nothing to do with the condition of my soul I could be a hypocrite and God honor Faith are you say where you get this from and the only ones at the end time B tells us over and over again in the last day that's the deception that people can fulfill offices but not be spiritual people themselves that's right my behavior determines whether I'm truly predestinated but not all of my behavior says whether I'm predestinated right or not cuz there going to be times that I'm not always going to do it right times I'm going to have to repent times I'm going to have to learn grow develop what y'all look at me like that for y'all don't know what I'm talking about that's going to be times that we're going to have to expand our thinking to know the greater revelation of what's going on in our life and we're going to have to cry we're going to have to fast we're going to have to work and labor to understand that Revelation deeper in our heart but that has nothing to do with God's favor his favor is placed on us before we ever even make a move so it's important to separate offices and gifts from the favor of God let's think about it friends when those Millions will come before him at the white Throne judgment there'll be preachers stand there and say I preached all over the world I cast out Devils I done Great Mighty things and he looks right down and says but I I didn't even know you right all the things You' done it might have been great to you might have been great for somebody else but to me I didn't even know you that attitude in itself is why we will take gifted people or people with a good behavior well they must have better favor from God and Faith changes based on color of skin amount of money in the bank what faith is Faith no matter where it comes from it's faith and God's favor is given to us in spite of our own behavior now whether he's going to trust us with more that depends on whether we want to live right and we to apply oursel to the things of God but the condition of my soul has nothing to do with my behavior you say that ain't true it is true Paul said Grace is a free gift not of works that any man can boast amen now if you say Amen to that we can get to this next part pretty easy now if you're struggling with that part that just means you got no legalistic thing still stuck up in here and you need to get that out of your heart and mind because your Works has nothing to do with salvation if you could it defeats the very purpose brother Joe defeats the purpose of Calvary for us to place ourself into the mode of Salvation how can I ever do anything to be saved myself you read the scripture yourself with me all of our righteousnesses PL are as filthy rags in the eyes of God well I've been raised in the message don't care my daddy was a preacher doesn't matter well I was a Deacon's kid it absolutely matters not what matters is did you accept that free gift into your heart and did you get saved amen and if you did then the Holy Ghost can take you from there and then guess what folks it's up to him to determine what our behavior is supposed to be like and if you're supposed to be a Christian Living Like a Christian and you're behaving badly daddy will take take care of that you don't ignore his kids he ain't one of these absentee fathers that's breaking bubbles on his telephone in the corner somewhere he pays attention to his boys and girls he don't let us just get away with anything that's the consolation I've got when it comes to living right Within Myself I know I can't do it but you said it sounds like we shouldn't even try of course we should try but we should also understand the limitation of that I can do my best but it will not be absolute I can put forth my best foot but that doesn't mean I'm always going to Champion the cause and win and overcome and many times I might try and end up failing down the road right amen but what keeps me grace of God Amen favor of God praise the Lord now listen to this life story I'd rather have favor with God than anything I know of in the world and if I've got favor with God I can serve his people right so having favor with the Lord gives me the ability somehow to show Grace to somebody else remember the parable Jesus used about the man that was forgiven of a great debt and then he turns around and grabs another that he owes the debt grabs him by the throat you know what Jesus said he said that all of those original creditors all them debts were called when that man turned around and done that to the other one because if Grace has been given to you then you should be able to pay it for it you got to be able to show it to somebody else friends let's just get it through our head some of the most unforgiving people in the world of church people they old grudges worse than anybody wo praise the Lord right supposed to be righteous religious holy forgiving loving just all of that and yet we are the most stubborn arrogant hard-hearted people on the planet religious people are boy when somebody offends us they've offended God hallelujah and if something happens to them you know they sit in the silence ah I knew it I knew when they looked at me fun in church the other day going to get cancer first of all big guy you ain't that important you're not as big in your mind as you think you are and it ain't God's business to go around smiting down every little kid that looks at you Crossways Hallelujah forgiveness and mercy is a much greater animal to to to to to to lean towards a greater experience that God would want to give us is the ability to forgive so deeply from our heart that it would be like Christ would forgive the church himself and if I've got his favor in my heart right if I understand this correctly then I can show favor to somebody else I could show Grace to them amen I had an experience just last weekend a certain thing had taken place and in my mind I thought th this is a almost a point of no return kind of thing and I was uh the little church I was preaching in Indianapolis last week in Indiana their piano player wasn't wasn't there and they asked me at the end of the service if I'd or during the service if I'd help them play and so I finished up the meeting and we were singing and things got to the very end of the service I slipped over to the piano and the brother that started leading singing was singing Grace Grace God's grace in my mind I was thinking about this individual in this situation and I thought that's too far gone and do you know that while I was sitting there on that piano the holy spirit said to me who puts you in charge of how much I'm able to forgive that's right sometimes when you get rebuked like that it wakes you up a little bit because you know we get Arrogant with this message we know all these things brother BR said about living right living holy and Living Clean on and on on we get Arrogant with it and the first little thing that happens in our home parents you know when it comes their kids do do a stupid kid things you know we call their hand on it we always throw about five quotes in there to make sure we punctuate it just right glory to God the prophet said but who forgives you when you do stupid parent things or stupid big person things or stupid Grandpa things or stupid Aunt things or Uncle things or hello right same Grace That Forgives them same Grace That Forgives us and if I hold it in my heart right then I can pay pay that Grace forward every time God gives it to me I can just share that much grace over with somebody [Applause] else Hallelujah you say is it important sure it is Jesus said if you don't forgive you can't be forgiven and brother Brenham said faith and forgiveness the relationship together that you cannot have true Faith unless you're willing to forgive from your heart things that other people have done to you even in the Lord's Prayer give us this day day by day our daily bread and for for give us of our debts as we forgive our debtors and our trespasses as we forgive our trespassers mercy and Grace that's the thing the Pharisees forgot about Jesus said they left off the weightier matters of the law forgiveness and love and mercy hey man now listen to this in me in the message from that time he says you'll never be able to get anything from God or have favor with God my brother sister ever who you are until we fully obey the word of God he said see you just make yourself miserable half heart he says now in order to put this quote in the right perspective we have to think of that term fully obeying the word and we have a problem if we try to put this you know in the context of saying okay full obedience to the word means I can never ever break it within myself that's impossible it's impossible to so live to a place to where you never do anything wrong now I don't believe that Christians lay in habitual sins and plan out evil things and you know live under the the umbrella of a bunch of Filth all the time but the prophet used it this way in questions and answers when they asked him about minor things he said I think that's the key to really focus on when it comes to a Christian Life and little bobles and mistakes he said it's the minor things you don't want to do you know like for example sitting a red light and somebody don't go too fast and you all instantly get mad and if you'd had a gun you might have shot at him get out of there go what's you waiting on ahead or the dog you know you get mad and kick the dog or kick the cat or some kind of a thing minor things I'm trying to be careful with that one because in this day and age kicking a dog and cat is not minded to a lot of people but but the point is true the idea becomes it's the little minor thing that these things are what we gauge many times whether we have God's favor in our life or not it has nothing to do with his favor but these little minor behavioral things are the very things that we say full obedience to the word but listen the Lord Jesus Hebrews 4:12 sees not only the action of it but the intention of it thank God he is the word that is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and you know why that he can reward people with the token with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fill them with the very life of God because he can see what their intention is hallelujah it ain't always what we do but it's what we intend to do glory to God that's what makes a bigger difference sometimes in whether God is going to reward us with Grace in an area or if he's going to correct us what was your intention I I you've heard me say it before when brother R went through that complex the Lord showed him a vision of him in a trash dump he was revealing to brother bradam this is where your intention will lead [Music] you he said what you intend to do Billy won't stay with you said your wife will leave you his intention was going to get him in a lot of trouble what God could see brother Ram's intention and all of that would be created can he also see the intention of a person's heart Lord I want to serve you with everything I got in me I want to be an obedient Christian I don't want to be a a slacker or hitchhiker or halfway in or halfway out half-hearted I want to serve you with all of my heart can he not also see that glory and reward that intention as well I say he can praise the Lord now here's another aspect of the favor of God Victory Day brother says remember when God has counted you worthy he said I don't fail to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows you have found favor with God and God believes listen to this God believes that you'll stand the test amen lord it's not even what I believe you ask me sometimes if I'm in the middle of something how do you think you'll fair not too good if you ask my opinion matter of fact I may not even make it through this thing you know how some people are when you ask them how life is oh everything's a misery oh you know the one positive light that this nation has had in some of the people's attitude is they saw a poll the other day that Trump has finally Battleground States and now they're happy you go into a Walmart and they've reduced the price of egg no more EG flation now they're happy everything is based on some carnal reacted thing out here in the world some kind of reactionary thing in the world and they believe the nation will do good as long as they got their man in in power people like that at their jobs you know certain people in certain jobs ah the job's going to be great we have so much respect resp of persons when it comes to little matters of life because to us we gauge successes and victories and things like that based on what we believe something will be and there's many times you might believe that you're going to be a conqueror you believe you're going to whip the trial and you believe you're going to come out smelling like a rose and that'll be the very time that God puts the thing before you that you can't conquer you can't Whip and there ain't no roses within 100 miles of you that's right because Jesus I believe is determined to show this bride before we get out of here there's not one part of you that can be contributed into this [Applause] Rapture it's got to be completely surrendered but if you ask somebody's opinion about how today is going if they're looking at the stock market maybe they're having a good day in the NASDAQ so everything's going well what a flighty way to live live not spec of stability and that kind of stuff but when God believes something it ain't based on the numbers of the NASDAQ or who's winning the Battleground States or who's working that certain job or who's in command or what the inflation numbers are God don't look at none of that foolishness like that oh you I know that really okay so then apply it to you then if he's not affected by politics or the world economy or the cosmos around him what makes you think he's affected by that negative attitude you got or how low you think about yourself or how low down you think you really are or how you put yourself down in your own opinion wo preach brother Ben none of that affects him he looks down at you and he says that's my boy that's my girl I trust them to come through on the other side amen and if God believes it no matter what you believe about yourself it'll come out just that way that God said friends you know how it is sometimes if I was to base everything I did off how I felt about it there'd be a lot of things I'd never try to tackle but his faith is what gets us there his faith that's how we're saved his faith I'm not saved by by my faith I'm saved by his faith amen now Psalm 5:12 can I go a bit further thank you Psalm 512 for thou [Applause] Lord will bless the righteous with favor will thou Compass him as with a shield so now the favor of God is described to us as a shield you know the beautiful thing about a shield is it's two-sided kind of like the Holy Ghost the Seal of the Holy Ghost is a seal on the inside and it also shows on the outside the Seal of the Holy Ghost keeps the devil out but it also keeps you in oh now I know here's where the chair of them show up well now Brother pin I've never been tempted to go out I've never been tempted to tell a lie neither have you no I've never been tempted to quit aha don't lie in church it ain't a good look on you don't do it don't do it we're all tempted to go am we're all tempted to sway amen you say well I'm not you get discouraged enough let circumstances fall in a certain way and you'll have all them kind of thoughts flood through your mind why don't I just quit why don't I just give up what's the point what's the use okay so why don't you do it why are you still sitting here why after many years even are you still sitting here there is a shield Brother David God places this shield around us and this Shield is different than the shield of the spirit you see when Paul dresses us up we take the shield of the spirit for our protection we take that upon ourself but this Shield is even greater than our own because this is something that God does for us not us doing it for ourselves Hallelujah he places that great shield around us in protection and not only can the devil sometimes not even get to you but when you feel like well I'll just give up I'm going to go I'm going to do and you start walking and all of a sudden you when you start budding up against that Shield you find out quickly that the Lord ain't going to let you go no further then what he wants you to go amen so his Mercy his favor his grace is like a great shield around me why do some people just quit and succeed when they make that decision why do they succeed why do they quit and become the best quitter you've ever seen some of them are better quitters than they were church goers praise the Lord when they go to the world they go big time man they don't go halfway would to God they show that kind of spirit or initiative in church right but they don't they leave the message they leave the church they just go wild hog wow my granny used to say why don't you do that cuz there's a shield around you his favor is compassing you about like this and every time you start to make too much of a step boom you start hitting that side boom get the side over here you back up there it is oh Hallelujah now if the Lord allows the devil to hit you with something that's all right he's in control of that little trial and if he gives you that trial and he allows the devil to get into you a little bit that's all right God believes you'll stand the test or he wouldn't allowed her in the first place his favor allows you to go through that thing his favor allows that thing to settle into your life that's why God put it there was for your character development what more amen he ain't worried he ain't fearful because he's got this shield around you glory how could I quit how can I give up how can I walk away when his protection is over my life you said what what what does that do for me brother Ben it should take all the fear away from you it should place you in a position to where there is no failure and fear of going too far and fear you you know I hear so-called professed Christians saying things like I'm just afraid I'll blashe I'm afraid I'll be a Judas you can't if God has placed this Shield around your life it's impossible to become what you're afraid of cuz the Lord is not going to allow it friends what are we going to come to the the realization what are we going to identify in our lives that the Holy Spirit we are bought with a price we are not our own come on somebody you can't make decisions for yourself you got a boss you answer to so his Shield protects us bless the righteous with favor will Compass him as with a shield all right Psalm 30:5 now Psalm chapter 30:5 praise be to God the favor of the Lord excuse me Psalm 30 and5 now here's a an angle or a a a view into a part of God that quite frankly I think some of us are a little afraid to talk about sometimes and that's the anger of the Lord and his displeasure now what I want to show you here in this verse if the Lord will help me is I want to show you how that no matter how angry he might get or how displeased he could be at some of our Behavior that his favor will not let it remain that way verse 5 tells us now for his anger endureth but for [Music] a moment I got three girls at home I got two stupid teenage girls and I got one little eight-year-old she's brilliant she's intelligent because she's not she's not a teenager yet when they become teenagers they become stupid teenage kids I don't know where the stupid comes from it just kicks sin somehow and them two girls I love them but as they're learning and growing and developing they can do some of the goofiest stuff I've ever seen in my life I I told my middle daughter the other day I said Annie was you thinking before such a thing did you think did you use your brain that thing between your ears called a brain did you use it well I said that's all I needed to know right there there's the answer sometimes the father I get so mad at them I said what is the matter with you stupid girls I don't sit there're like you ain't never done what I'm talking about it's all in love but sometimes my anger oh I've taught these girl I taught you better than that but you see no matter how mad I might be at him now or for whatever moment that my anger has shown up all of that settles down all that dust settles brother Joe they're my blood they're me they're an expression of who I am Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone so to speak I I am their father and those are my kids so no matter how angry I might get at them or how I might say that's the stupidest thing I've ever seen you do my anger only endures for a moment why that already have my favor because I'm their father and they're my my daughters Hallelujah so my anger is not a reflection of anything to do with my favor at all but my favor kind of kicks in if you will after all of the yelling and the screaming and the what in the world were you doing and why did you do that I can't believe you said that when all of that settles it comes back to the fact they already have favor with me in the beginning therefore what do I do get him by the hand say all right let's dust off and try again so my anger might be kindled against them but my favor is what keeps it from being permanent when we walk in a place to where the Lord you know the prophet said in in perp my perfect weakness that God sometimes gets a he feels like kicking us oh y'all didn't know he said that huh 11 1961 just go back and look at it God gets a mad us he feels like kicking us sometimes he gives us his power his a nipus gives us the word gives us all these great things and what do we do act like a bunch of stupid teenage kids forgive me Teenagers I'm trying to make a point here and all of those things that we would do and God would get so mad as think why did you do that dumb thing like that but yet because I have his favor already his anger endureth but a moment and in his favor is life weeping may endure for the night but joy comes in the morning his favor brings about his instruction his support his teaching his guidance and his Mercy glory to God Amen I drop down two verses verse 7 Psalm 30 and then verse 7 chapter 30 verse 7 David says Lord by thy favor thou Hast made my Mountain to stand strong listen to this thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled so here David's even reflecting that God would sometimes hide his face from him you ever had the Lord do that to you certain time period of your life and you're waiting on the Lord just to speak it out Heavens are brass everything is quiet and still doesn't seem like there's anything spiritual moving in your life whatsoever doesn't seem that way it is but it doesn't seem that way but it's in that moment that David said he made my mountain stand strong now in the Bible a mountain symbolizes several things first of all it can symbolize divine inspiration talked about they said that's where all the great Inspirations are come and get way up high into the mountain and said sit up there and think about the Lord and meditate on the Lord and great Inspirations would come to him the city of God New Jerusalem is a mountain it's a symbol universal symbol of nearness to God people think about climbing to the top of a mountain there's something about that that represents God a closeness to God but a mountain also symbolizes A New Beginning because just like the song I sang to you no matter how many valleys or mountains that you might cross through in your lifetime and you might be going through a valley right at this very moment you might be going through something so hard you don't know how to overcome it but as you're walking through this Valley eventually you're going to come to the foot or the base of another Mountain God made that mountain to stand strong to symbolize A New Beginning what no matter what it might have been yesterday remember yesterday ended last night and God gives all of us a new beginning his favor is what does that meaning that you cannot mess up to the point of no return whenever you go so far and you see things going on and trouble's happening he gives you a new beginning all of this trial now behind you what Paul say about it forget it forget about all of that behind you and start pressing to the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus he made my Mountain to stand strong he will not allow my new beginnings to disappear right you've heard me say it before but remember Christians are the only people on this Earth that can redeem the time Paul told us to redeem it because the days were evil we are a people of redemption we have the abil the ability to apply Redemption to every area of our life even our time years that might have been lost moments that might have been lost opportunities that might have been lost you can redeem it as a Believer glory to God why because his favor provides for me A New Beginning right praise the Lord now watch this at Easter seal brother says I'd hate to try to go to heaven on my preaching that amazing everybody else is trying to get there on it that's right he said I'd hate to try to go to heaven on my visions and yet people are trying to go to heaven on those I'm not going to heaven because of that he said I'm going because I hold his grace in my heart do you realize that not even the blood of Christ not even the blood of Jesus if you had a charger of the natural blood of Jesus Christ you realize not that blood couldn't do not one thing for you that's right amen you realize that all of this Bible and all this message and all this preaching and all these visions and all these things from Brother Bram not one bit of that is going to get you ready to get out of here and go in the Rapture [Applause] faith in the preaching faith in the Visions faith in the blood of Christ faith in the word is what brings you into those places like that righten not the natural articles communion foot washing those things don't save nobody but we do that because our faith toward God we believe there's healing in the communion we believe that baptism is an outward show of what's happened on the inside faith is what anchors all of those things glor to God so his favor isn't shown to me because I've got a piece of brother brandom sleeping back or I've got a piece of a preacher's tie some prayer cloth I'm holding on to my faith in God that's what makes the difference faith is not appropriated because you sat on this church pew in here or because of what preacher preaches from this platform over you faith in your heart toward what is accomplished and what is done that's what brings you into those things and how can you have faith faith in God if he doesn't show his favor to You Luke 1 verse 30 little bit further doing good so far okay hang in there with me after preaching like this you're probably thinking I'm glad you ain't been around for a while your hide got a little bit thin I guess I had to come toughen you up evidently oh I'm just teasing settle down Luke 1:30 watch now the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God so question was she a different kind of marriage something about her name different was she a different caliber of Virgin did they feed her better put her in better quarters what what made this Mary here of all of the thousands was on the earth at the time what made that one so special you see you can't have faith in anything unless God makes the first move on you you could look in the Bible and you could say a virgin shall conceive but you have no faith to appropriate to it until God reveals to you you the virgin that's right and do you know this was such a surprise to this girl that the Bible said when the angel of the Lord spoke to her she stopped and said what manner of salutation is this you know kind of like some of y'all do in church when the Holy Ghost tells you well how forgiving you are and how wonderful you are and how powerful you are as the bride and what a conquer you when the Holy Ghost preaches that way to us sometimes we just sit and think what is he talking about me you know that's a good thing to have that kind of attitude at least you got some humility with it not thank yourself more than you ought but when God speaks this to this girl right here she done nothing within herself it wasn't that she was a better type of person raised in a better family it was the fact that God God had her in mind as being the incubator for the body of God hallelujah and when he looked upon this woman his favor was shown to her when it wasn't shown to any other virgin or any other Mary or any other person in all of Israel God showed his favor to that girl right there she was the one that received it and here's what people will say well that's not fair God's the one makes the decision on what's fair and ain't Fair right I'm just glad that I'm a part of whatever he wants me to be a part of Amen listen to this the Hebrew series you see friends what you do is not accepted is what he done your own righteousness won't be accepted so put this in perspective we raise our families come and preach and we tell people all our lives live right and walk right and and dress right and don't do this and stay away from that we we we put so much emphasis on those things which is okay if you keep those things in their right place all of that is wonderful and praise God for people that are holy living but that is not a means of Salvation and you know where we've really missed the mark in this message so many years because we have so pushed the doctrines and the Mysteries and behaviors and how we live and what we do and what we don't do that we have forgotten all together to preach a gospel message to people s in the pews that don't know that they're Sinners and they need to get saved and so they come to the church they learn all the behaviors they learn how to dress and talk and what to believe and they've never been saved how in the [Applause] world could I ever bring myself into a place to where I could say to him now Lord be like Mary kind of saying to Jesus uh now or saying to to to the father of Jesus to God the Father not in the trinitarian way but God who is the father the Holy Spirit it' be like Mary saying now uh I've got a few good chromosomes you can borrow if you need them got a few good cells I come from a pretty good pedigree so I've got a few Joseph's got a few on his side that if you'd like to borrow a few you realize in order for him to bring this body of God into creation like it was that not one self from either one of them could have been Incorporated that's right Jesus had nothing to do in the physical way there was absolutely not one Speck of Mary not one Speck of Joseph in that kid that's right when God created that body it was total blood creation by almighty God hallelujah that's why the B said a Virg would conceive she couldn't add nothing to it and produce it all of those things in their proper place praise the Lord and Hallelujah for him but in order for me to know if I've got God's favor looking at okay I listened to seven tapes this week and I read my Bible three times and I went to church and pay TI this week evidently I've got God's favor greatly in my life that favor doesn't change if you didn't listen to any tapes didn't read your Bible forgot to pay your ties and have been an absolute Rascal all week two eye blinks three head nods the rest of you just sitting there you don't want to reveal yourself I guess come on now doesn't change God's favor for you he still loves you and has confidence in you no matter how you pave sure oh no don't mean you won't get it it you he Daddy's belt loops from Heaven sometimes but you've got to separate in your mind because how many times do you sit and feel so discouraged over things that you fail at and then somehow in our mind we translate that to mean that God doesn't like us as much this week Romans chapter 10:3 I grab just a couple scriptures I'm I'll let you home 838 I'm not doing too bad let's wrap this up for they being ignorant of God's righteousness going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted thems under the righteousness of God and Paul's saying that these these men of the day these people of the day would not submit themselves to God's righteousness but they established or created their own thing rules regulations laws why did they do that because to them taste not touch not handle not that's how you got God's attention that's how you got God's favor and what's Paul trying to teach these people that when you submit yourself to the righteousness of God it has nothing to do with what you do or you don't do in yourself now that doesn't mean you don't live right don't mean you don't tribe but you cannot use that as your absolute for whether God is going to put his favor on you or not that's right just like gifts where those tongues they'll fail prophecy they'll fail where you act where you do you'll fail somewhere but we're not washed up and gone no his righteousness is there to kick in and take over Philippians 3:9 Paul said being found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ amen the righteousness which is of god by how by faith and then finally Romans chap 5: 10 and 11 he says for if we when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement and this word atonement it means the restoration of the favor of God so at one time I might have been his enemy to the word at one time I might have been an absolute I might have been a beast of a problem but once he saved me through faith am I saved with joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ once I came to that spot to where he saw my intention was to live right and he gave back to me the baptism of the Holy Ghost then in doing so he restores back to me the favor that Adam lost all them years ago into the Garden of Eden because you see it was God's favor that kept them wholly veiled and as long as they stayed underneath the umbrella of God's favor Satan couldn't touch them and it wasn't until they came out from underneath that that they got in trouble in the first place same thing with you and I the only time we ever get in trouble is when we step out from behind that word my brother sister that's the point of the message I'm making tonight thank God that the moment we step out from over behind the word and we start getting oursel in trouble there's another Shield of RA righteousness and Grace that stands right there to keep us from going too far and no matter how many times you've messed up or how many valleys you've went through he's there to give you a new beginning rise and try again yes he might have been angry with you but his anger only endures for a moment Joy comes in the morning stand with me tonight praise the Lord musicians come tonight let's bow our heads together oh Jesus thank you for your word thank you for what's been [Music] preached Lord I I I just trust you let it just be a revelation deep in our hearts may it just be something that settles deep within us Lord I pray and help us to see it in the right view of seeing it because Lord how easy it is for us to look at these things in a in a in a much different way leaning more on that work side of trying to accomplish something within oursel but Lord seeing in your word tonight how your favor is there Upon Our Lives that we as human beings cannot earn that or win that or live close enough to get it he lord it's it's amazing at the beginning of the message when I answered the question to say we can't obtain God's favor you could almost feel like a disappointment hanging people because Lord that's man's nature he's always trying to do something to get your attention or to get you to look our Direction Lord if I was going to point to that there's a lot of more people around this world that can do a whole lot better at life at this game of life they play the game a whole lot better Better Than I Do Lord I want to be thankful for the fact that no matter where I'm matter or who I am one day you just sent the angel down my pathway hail you have found favor with God Amen I like it better that way anyways Lord because then we can't boast and brag about what we've done or what we've learned or how long we've been in the message you get all the glory for such things and so we thank you for it Lord help us now to be able to receive it protect us and speed us on our way Grant to us your mercy in all things in Jesus name I pray amen amen and amen how many glad you got God's favor in your life amen Lord hallelujah I uh appreciate your patience 8:44 I crammed a three-hour sermon in about an hour and 10 minutes right there so the Lord bless you you did well you hung in there with me I love you friends listen to me as we go on a time you're going to find out that the one thing that's going to discourage you more than anything else is not going to be the devil it ain't going to be church people it ain't going to be Politics the one thing that's going to discourage you more than anything else is this right here you and getting overcoming ability overcoming power to whip out that Real Enemy which is you yourself amen that right there is what's going to help us get ready to get out of here and make the Rapture that's why I preach stuff like this not not because oh you know they say when a man preaches a lot about something that he's guilty or some kind of thing I'm certainly not saying what I'm saying tonight because I'm hiding secret sin I'm not preaching this way about making mistakes to give us a license to do anything we want to do but brother at the end of the day we're going to have to know how to fight this thing right here that's right we need to know how it uppercuts and how it how it swings and how it steps back in the boxing ring we need to know how it fights if we want to get overcoming power over it amen so I preach these things so we can go a little further in Christ and every time we have these moments where we've been a little short of the glory of God maybe from today on instead of you going to that place in your mind thinking oh man well I've messed up with the Lord I want to have to really earn it back after tonight maybe you'll be able to stop and say I don't have to earn it Lord I just have to say I'm sorry amen and let you give me a new beginning that I can try again and even if you're angry with me Jesus I know your anger won't endure I'm sorry forgive me help me raise up and try again show me how to win and overcome that thing I think if you put it in that perspective it's going to make you a stronger Christian when you see it in that line amen so God bless you love you appreciate you see you again soon the Lord willing
