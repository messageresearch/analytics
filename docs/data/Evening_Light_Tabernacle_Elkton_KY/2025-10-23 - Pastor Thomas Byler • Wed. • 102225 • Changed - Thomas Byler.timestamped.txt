[12:52] My boat of life
[12:56] sails on a troubled sea.
[13:01] Ever there's a wind in my s
[13:08] [Music]
[13:10] But I have a friend
[13:14] who watches over me
[13:19] when the breeze turns into
[13:23] a gale.
[13:24] [Music]
[13:28] I know the master of the wind.
[13:37] I know the maker of the rain
[13:45] and he can calm the storm and make the
[13:49] sun to shine again.
[13:52] [Applause]
[13:55] I know the master of the wind.
[14:04] Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the
[14:09] sky.
[14:12] Among the peaks my soul can be found.
[14:20] But an unexpected
[14:22] storm
[14:24] may drive me from the heights.
[14:29] It may bring me low, but it can never
[14:32] bring me down.
[14:37] For I know
[14:40] the master of the wind.
[14:45] I know the maker
[14:48] [Music]
[14:50] of the rain.
[14:55] And he can calm the storm and make the
[14:59] sun to shine again.
[15:03] [Music]
[15:04] I know the master of the wind. Sometimes
[15:09] I soar.
[15:13] Sometimes I soar like an eagle in the

[15:29] Oh, but an unexpected
[15:31] storm. It may drive me from the heights.
[15:38] It may bring me low, but it'll never
[15:41] bring me down.
[15:47] I know the master of the wind.
[15:53] I know the maker
[15:57] [Music]
[15:58] of the rain.
[16:03] And he can calm the storm and make the
[16:08] sun to shine again.
[16:13] I know the master of the wind. He can
[16:17] calm the storm.
[16:19] Oh, and he can calm the storm and make
[16:24] the sun to shine again.

[38:52] um we'll begin with verse
[38:56] 14. For as many as are led by the spirit
[38:58] of God, they are the sons of God. For ye
[39:01] have not received the spirit of bondage
[39:03] again to fear, but ye have received the
[39:07] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
[39:09] Abba, Father. For the spirit itself
[39:12] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[39:14] are the children of God. And if
[39:16] children, then hes. Amen. Heirs of God
[39:19] and joint hes with Christ. Amen. If so
[39:22] be that we suffer with him, that we may
[39:25] also be glorified together. Amen. For I
[39:30] reckon that the sufferings of this
[39:31] present time are not worthy to be
[39:33] compared with the glory that shall be
[39:35] revealed in us. For the earnest
[39:38] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[39:40] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[39:43] For the creature was made subject to
[39:44] vanity, not willingly, but by reason of
[39:46] him who hath subjected the same in hope.
[39:50] because the creature itself also shall
[39:52] be delivered from the bondage of
[39:54] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[39:57] the children of God. For we know that
[40:00] the whole creation g uh groanth and
[40:02] travaleth in pain together until now.
[40:06] And not only they, but ourselves also
[40:08] which have the first fruits of the
[40:10] spirit. We even we ourselves grown
[40:14] within ourselves waiting for the
[40:15] adoption to wit the redemption of our
[40:19] body. Amen. May God add his blessings to
[40:22] the reading the word. You can be seated
[40:24] this morning. This evening this morning.
[40:28] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[40:30] So the way that this came to me and I
[40:33] was just meditating on the Lord and I
[40:36] was you know I don't know I won't say
[40:39] that it was the Lord but in my mind
[40:41] something asked me what is important
[40:44] what we would be important to minister
[40:46] now. Amen. Amen. We've we've talked
[40:49] about how that God has given all us all
[40:51] things to enjoy. Amen. And how that
[40:54] we're joint hes with God. Amen. And and
[40:58] so forth. But I thought about what's
[41:01] important because I believe we're coming
[41:02] down close to the end, don't you?
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Close to the end. And I thought
[41:09] about uh how that really that's it's
[41:12] truly what's important is that we're
[41:16] ready. Amen. To be ready. That we have
[41:21] what it's going to take when we get
[41:23] there. Amen. So tonight we want to talk
[41:26] about we're going to go to a perfect
[41:28] body. Amen. How many believes that?
[41:30] Amen. And and uh you know that inside
[41:34] man that God is working on in each and
[41:37] one of us. Amen. That inside man has to
[41:40] match the outside. Amen. Praise the
[41:44] Lord. Good to see y'all. Good. Glad glad
[41:46] brother Glenn is back. Amen. And sister
[41:49] Sherry. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[41:51] Sister Patty. Amen. And so we're just
[41:53] glad to have them back. Amen. We missed
[41:54] you, brother. I'm glad you're feeling
[41:56] better.
[41:58] All of you. Amen. I thought about
[42:00] putting you on the list there, you know,
[42:02] but I I thought about telling you, you
[42:04] don't qualify, but you qualify anytime.
[42:06] You can come watch. You can come and and
[42:09] instruct or whatever you want to do.
[42:11] Amen. Praise the Lord. We appreciate,
[42:14] brother Glenn.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. So, I got to
[42:18] thinking, you know, how that, you know,
[42:20] and I got to thinking about what really
[42:22] what it is that we're going to take with
[42:24] us. Ain't that right? How many knows and
[42:26] it's something that I've preached many
[42:27] times and sometimes I hesitate, but you
[42:30] know, maybe there'll be people out there
[42:31] that listen to it that that hear it and
[42:34] maybe people right here this evening,
[42:36] you know, that just need to hear it
[42:37] again. Isn't that right? But we know
[42:40] that when we take when we go and when we
[42:42] leave this place there's only one thing
[42:43] that we take with us and that is our
[42:47] character.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; That is our character. I thought where
[42:51] brother Bham had said you know that
[42:53] death doesn't change us. Is that right?
[42:56] And I thought well if death doesn't
[42:57] change us then when we go in the rapture
[43:00] and our body is changed it would not
[43:03] change your character and the way that
[43:05] you are. So there has to be a a change.
[43:10] Amen. That takes place and that is
[43:14] taking place in our lives.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe as we have as you're led
[43:20] by the spirit of God, as you're filled
[43:22] with the Holy Ghost, you see your own
[43:25] faults. How many does that?
[43:27] &gt;&gt; You see where you're still short because
[43:30] the Holy Spirit shows you that. Amen.
[43:32] Whether it's just by revelation or it's
[43:35] by tests and trials and things that God
[43:37] allows to come your way.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; And you know, we're going to get over
[43:43] there one of these days. How many
[43:44] believe we're going to get over there
[43:46] one of these days?
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we get over there, I heard
[43:50] brother Bram say that you know the
[43:52] angels when we go get over there and we
[43:54] sing amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[43:57] that save the wretch like me. Amen. And
[44:00] we talked about all the wondrous love of
[44:02] God. When we talk about these things,
[44:04] the angels will stand back and listen
[44:06] cuz they won't know what we're talking
[44:08] about.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; When we get over there, I'm here to tell
[44:14] you that they're going to look upon us
[44:16] and realize and know that we have come
[44:20] through a terrible, terrible ordeal.
[44:25] Amen.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:28] that it'll be have in very very heart.
[44:32] I thought about it as I was studying
[44:34] this that I want to go to one of the
[44:35] angels and tell them that boy I'm here
[44:37] to tell you I'm here to tell you that we
[44:40] have faced some deep dark valleys.
[44:44] We have had some real battles. We have
[44:46] had some real struggles.
[44:49] And that angel will say, "Well, I don't
[44:51] know what you're talking about."
[44:54] Why? Because they don't know. They don't
[44:56] experience what we experience.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we talk about and and and you
[45:03] know, and it'll be true that that they
[45:05] won't know just what we went through.
[45:13] But we'll say, you know, but it didn't
[45:16] matter how much the valley was. It
[45:18] doesn't matter how long the trial was.
[45:20] Doesn't matter how dark it was,
[45:24] how horrible it was.
[45:27] We'll say that God gets all the glory
[45:29] because he brought us through that.
[45:32] Amen.
[45:33] God gets all the glory because he
[45:37] brought us through that. First thing I
[45:39] want to just mention is before we really
[45:42] get started, first the first quote I
[45:43] want to mention is brother Bam says, he
[45:45] says, "I think of the layout I see a
[45:47] church h in its condition." He said, 'As
[45:50] far as I know, I don't see anything to
[45:52] hinder at this time the coming of the
[45:54] Lord outside of the readiness of the
[45:58] church.
[46:00] Amen. Outside of the Can't Can't we say
[46:03] that tonight? We've seen all these other
[46:05] scriptures being fulfilled.
[46:08] all these scriptures that's being
[46:09] fulfilled
[46:12] and we can say that we don't really see
[46:14] anything that would hinder him from
[46:16] coming tomorrow morning between 7 and 9.
[46:22] Ain't that right?
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just the readiness
[46:28] of the church.
[46:31] Amen.
[46:37] This is something else I'm a little
[46:39] concerned before I get started. I'm a
[46:42] little concerned
[46:45] about us.
[46:49] And I don't know if this will apply to
[46:50] you or not, but maybe.
[46:54] But Abraham talks about some time ago a
[46:58] man on his road to the seaside. He was
[47:00] going for a little rest. He wanted to
[47:02] refresh himself. Ain't that right? Y'all
[47:04] remember the sword? He wanted to refresh
[47:06] himself and hear the seagulls and all
[47:08] these things, you know. He wanted to go
[47:10] down and relax and really enjoy the blue
[47:12] sky that reflects the water. And on his
[47:14] road to the seashore, he met a man with
[47:16] his old this old salt, the old sailor of
[47:18] the sea. He says, where goest thou? He
[47:20] said, I go down to the seashore to enjoy
[47:23] the goodness of the sea. The old Saul
[47:26] said, you know, I don't see nothing
[47:28] strange about it. The waters are just
[47:29] water. Sky just sky. The gull is just
[47:32] another bird. You see, he had seen so
[47:35] much until it became common to him.
[47:41] It wasn't thrilling to him anymore.
[47:45] How many knows that you got to be
[47:46] careful going to church, hearing the
[47:49] gospel, hearing the preacher? It just
[47:52] becomes common to you.
[47:56] Brother Bram said that commonness is is
[47:59] leisier. It's lukewarmness.
[48:02] Is
[48:03] &gt;&gt; that right?
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't thrilling to him. And
[48:09] that's what's the matter with you
[48:10] people. Brother Bam says, you've seen
[48:12] the goodness, the miracles, the divine
[48:15] things of God moving and working until
[48:17] it just becomes common.
[48:22] We hear preachers under the inspiration
[48:25] fireball and Amen. We used to amen
[48:28] preach it. We used the pull.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Brother M. Brother Michael sits under
[48:35] brother Donnie Reagan. Hello.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; But it can become common if you aren't
[48:40] careful. Just Well, there's Brother
[48:43] Donnie again. We're listening. Well,
[48:44] there's Brother Ber. Whoever it might
[48:46] be, we sit here, cross our hands, just
[48:49] become common.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing to let it become
[48:56] common. And it's easy to do. You would
[48:58] think that the love of God, the goodness
[49:00] of God, the, you know, the Holy Spirit
[49:02] moving in the atmosphere,
[49:05] amen, would would never get dullled,
[49:07] never get dim, never gets stale. But it
[49:10] can if you aren't careful.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I don't believe if
[49:14] somebody really stays on fire that they
[49:16] will get away from that and they they
[49:18] will let it become common. But it's when
[49:20] you get away from God a little bit and
[49:22] you let the world come in a little bit
[49:24] too much. you pay too much attention to
[49:26] YouTube or whatever it might be and you
[49:29] don't pray like you ought to and all of
[49:31] a sudden you go away from it.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; I mean, you got to be careful, church.
[49:36] Let's be careful. Evening light
[49:37] tabernacle.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That we don't let
[49:44] the preacher, the music, whatever it is,
[49:47] become common to where it's just another
[49:50] service. It's just another sermon. He's
[49:53] just doing what he's supposed to do.
[49:55] Lord, help us.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; I heard brother Brandham saying many
[49:59] time and I like to apply it to myself.
[50:01] He says, I don't come here just to
[50:03] preach a sermon or just to say something
[50:05] to the people. When I come up here, I
[50:07] want to say something that will benefit
[50:11] that will be a blessing and that God
[50:12] once said that God once done. And I
[50:15] believe we ought to receive it as that,
[50:16] don't you?
[50:17] &gt;&gt; We ought to be there receiving and say,
[50:19] "God, don't let me become common. Don't
[50:22] let the Holy Ghost become common. Can
[50:24] you imagine the Holy Ghost become
[50:26] common? The thrill of a Amen. a good
[50:29] sermon in the atmosphere of the Holy
[50:31] Ghost. But listen to what brother Bam
[50:33] says here. We've seen the goodness, the
[50:36] miracles, divine things moving until it
[50:39] became common, until it becomes common
[50:42] to you and you don't really notice it
[50:44] more. In my meetings, I've noticed where
[50:46] the Lord under discernment will speak
[50:48] right in on the audience like he did at
[50:50] the doors of Galilee. Amen. Just like he
[50:54] said and promised that he would do in
[50:55] the first time they say, "Oh man, was
[50:57] that ever." Woo! Huh, man. That was
[51:01] good.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, that's got to be of the
[51:06] Lord." And the next time, well, I guess
[51:09] it's all right.
[51:12] Huh?
[51:13] Can you imagine?
[51:15] This is what brother Bam says about it.
[51:17] He says it's common. It's passed over
[51:19] and you don't notice it. Your eyes of
[51:21] your understanding, your heart has
[51:23] closed up. And my he says it should
[51:26] shake your faith till you open up every
[51:28] door of faith and everything else and
[51:30] say, "Lord Jesus, take full possession
[51:33] of me now." Amen. Take me into your car
[51:36] and come into my heart. Take my
[51:38] selfishness away. Take my
[51:39] misunderstandings away. Take my doubts
[51:42] away. open my eyes.
[51:44] But you see this man the salt had seen
[51:47] so much and enjoyed
[51:50] like we've been preaching
[51:52] enjoyed so much.
[51:56] Amen.
[51:58] You realize sometimes too much enjoyment
[52:01] isn't good for us.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's right. We want to enjoy
[52:08] things, but man, be careful that it
[52:10] doesn't become common.
[52:13] He saw so much and enjoyed it so much
[52:15] until it just become common to him.
[52:18] That's what you Americans have done with
[52:19] Christ. He's been so good to you. You
[52:23] seen me open the eyes of the blind. Now,
[52:26] some of them wouldn't walk across the
[52:27] sea, the the street to see it again.
[52:30] See, see him heal the sick, perform
[52:34] miracles, and all this. And then it's
[52:37] become common. It's not a thrill
[52:40] anymore.
[52:42] Be careful that preaching and everything
[52:44] on Wednesday night, whatever.
[52:46] [Music]
[52:49] Don't have that kind of a spirit. When
[52:52] you come, you sing with a really heart
[52:54] of praise.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Worship.
[53:00] Amen.
[53:02] Oh, I thought, how can it how can a real
[53:04] fire that's burning on the inside get
[53:07] cold? Amen. I don't want it to get cold.
[53:10] I don't want it to burn out. I don't
[53:11] want us the evening light tabernacle to
[53:13] simmer down.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we have a tendency to do
[53:20] that if we have it too nice.
[53:25] Now, how many know that character, Amen,
[53:28] that it's molded through sufferings and
[53:30] through trials,
[53:32] I want you to understand that first 22
[53:35] years of your life from about five to
[53:38] 22. And that's including about four
[53:40] years of college, all you do, amen, is
[53:44] go to school and take test after test
[53:46] after test, exam after exam after exam.
[53:50] How many know God is here and he is
[53:52] examining you? He is testing you. He is
[53:55] trying you.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you learn and learn and learn
[54:02] and learn to become so that you can
[54:05] actually function in this world. Let me
[54:07] tell you something. God is putting you
[54:08] and I test after test after test, trial
[54:11] after trial,
[54:14] so that we will be able to function and
[54:16] do the way that God wants us to do.
[54:18] Because I'm here to tell you that this
[54:20] bunch of people that's coming up in the
[54:21] rapture that's going up into the sky,
[54:23] Paul's group, Irene's group, when we
[54:25] take to the sky, can only imagine the
[54:27] way brother Brandon preached it.
[54:30] One after the other, we're going up
[54:32] there, millions and millions of people
[54:34] to meet the Lord in the air.
[54:39] You talk about a people that has come
[54:41] out of suffering and so forth.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. there. Let me tell you something.
[54:48] What is brother What is God doing? How
[54:50] many knows that God so orchestrated it?
[54:53] God has so set it up.
[54:56] He didn't just give us a flowery bed of
[55:00] amen. If I was talking to the angel, he
[55:03] might ask, "How was it down there?" I'd
[55:05] say, "It sure wasn't no flower bed."
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Life is full of disappointment. Life is
[55:13] full of trials, tests, hardship,
[55:16] suffering, disease.
[55:22] Something else I wrote down that I
[55:23] wanted to say to the church.
[55:27] What I see in the church, what I see at
[55:30] evening like tabernacle, what I see
[55:32] here. Amen.
[55:39] Strange things.
[55:41] Strange things, Amen, that I go through.
[55:46] Strange things that I feel. Amen.
[55:52] But I see
[55:54] a group of warriors, soldiers,
[55:58] people that love the Lord, people that
[55:59] stand for the Lord.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? We're like a uh God's
[56:05] little army here in this community.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Now, how many know the devil? He's like
[56:10] a roaring lion going about seeking whom
[56:12] we may devour.
[56:14] But you've got your shield of faith up.
[56:16] You've got your sword out. We're like an
[56:19] army. Amen. That's cuddled together.
[56:23] Ain't that right? Cuddled together.
[56:25] Amen. And keeping all the fiery darts of
[56:28] the wicked one off of us.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; But the devil is there and he's trying
[56:34] to get in somewhere.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's trying to penetrate
[56:40] that impenetrable wall of shield. But
[56:44] you got to watch. We got to watch
[56:46] because the devil, he'll try to look for
[56:48] a hurt feeling somewhere.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; A little bit of backslittingness,
[56:56] a little bit of bitterness. He'll look
[56:58] for every little channel that he can
[57:00] possibly get to get into us. Are you
[57:03] with me? And we have to guard against
[57:05] that weakness because if he can get in
[57:07] there, he will.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; If he can get your feelings hurt from
[57:13] somebody or somehow, be careful. The
[57:16] devil will come in there and he'll try
[57:18] to route the army. So, let's keep our
[57:20] shields up. Keep your feelings in check.
[57:23] Keep your hurts. Keep your whatever it
[57:25] might be.
[57:28] Cuz he don't like a smooth running
[57:30] church. He don't like me to be under the
[57:32] anointing of the Holy Spirit and preach
[57:34] the gospel. He tries his best to attack
[57:36] me any way that he can.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Last week, I've went through a battle.
[57:48] Amen. Big battle.
[57:52] One of the biggest battles in a while. A
[57:55] matter of fact, I preached last Sunday
[57:57] under that battle. Tried not to show. I
[57:59] don't know if you noticed or not. I
[58:01] remember Brother Ivan,
[58:04] I'll tell you what, if I ever went
[58:05] through a a battle or whatever and then
[58:07] I'd preach, Brother Ivan one time says,
[58:09] "I don't know what what happened with
[58:11] him, but something happened, you know,
[58:14] because you can kind of pick it out." I
[58:16] don't know if y'all picked it out, but
[58:18] anyway, but by God's grace, I want to
[58:20] tell you this that by God's grace, I
[58:23] passed the test.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; I passed the test.
[58:28] Thank you, Lord.
[58:32] Tell you what, it wasn't easy. It wasn't
[58:33] easy at all, but I thank God. Amen. He
[58:37] helped. He helped me.
[58:39] Amen. And that's as much as I'm saying.
[58:43] Amen. You love him.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Think about it now. My brother
[58:49] Bram said when Constantine came over and
[58:52] liberated the Christians from Roman
[58:54] persecution,
[58:55] he said, you know, uh what when he did
[58:58] the church lost more grounds in 10 years
[59:00] that he had gained through the whole
[59:02] persecution. If there's anything that
[59:05] makes a Christian lazy, it's when they
[59:07] get a flowery bed of ease.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't like this quote, but it's
[59:12] the truth. He says, "We don't have
[59:14] persecution enough.
[59:17] We don't have it hard enough.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; I like it nice and easy. I like it for
[59:24] it to smooth. I don't like hardness. Do
[59:26] you? But even Paul told Timothy, "Endure
[59:30] hardness.
[59:32] Endure grief." Hello.
[59:37] Amen.
[59:40] Praise the Lord.
[59:42] That's right. We don't have it hard
[59:44] enough. Always the chain is the
[59:46] strongest at the weakest link.
[59:50] How many knows that when we get born
[59:52] again,
[59:54] when you get the Holy Spirit
[59:59] and you say you're born again, you say
[1:00:00] you got the faith of God, every son that
[1:00:04] comes to God
[1:00:06] has to be tried, has to be tested.
[1:00:13] Amen.
[1:00:14] God's going to test whether you really
[1:00:16] have the faith or not. Really have the
[1:00:18] love of God, those fruits of the spirit
[1:00:21] that we talked about. God's going to see
[1:00:23] if you really have those or not.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; I can't help but believe that God's got
[1:00:34] our at least my mind, my heart set in
[1:00:37] the right direction. Amen.
[1:00:40] Because there's really only one thing
[1:00:42] that we're interested in and that's to
[1:00:45] be ready.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Listen to what he said.
[1:00:52] See, a man under pressure is what he is
[1:00:54] under pressure.
[1:00:57] Glory. His real true characteristics
[1:01:00] will show under pressure.
[1:01:06] The best will come out. The church shows
[1:01:08] its best under pressure.
[1:01:11] You know how fired up we were? You know
[1:01:13] how our faith grew when we heard about
[1:01:16] my wife and the cancer and everything?
[1:01:19] It shook us out of our laziness. There
[1:01:21] was no coming to church and just being
[1:01:24] lazy and not po. You heard us. We It did
[1:01:27] us good
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; spiritually.
[1:01:32] No, we don't like that type of thing.
[1:01:36] But yet it moved us up to a next level.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Picked us up. Picked our faith up. Our
[1:01:43] sincerity level.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:53] All right.
[1:01:57] Get him all riled up. Stir him up. Put
[1:02:01] something on him. See what you're made
[1:02:03] of. How many believes that what trials
[1:02:06] do? They see what you are made of.
[1:02:24] Now, I must pause there and go back.
[1:02:30] We'll come up back up here and finish
[1:02:34] this. We'll start right here. This is
[1:02:36] where I get scrubble up sometime. I'll
[1:02:37] learn how to preach one of these days.
[1:02:40] All right. So, listen to this. Romans 8.
[1:02:43] What we just read. The whole creation
[1:02:45] groanth and travaleth. Does that sound
[1:02:48] uh you know, it sounds like a struggle
[1:02:50] to me. And my subject tonight is
[1:02:53] changed.
[1:02:55] Changed.
[1:02:59] Amen.
[1:03:00] What is the whole creation groaning for?
[1:03:03] The manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:03:07] How many believe the whole creation
[1:03:10] is in pain?
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Groan. You don't think it's groaning?
[1:03:21] Think about all those crocodiles that
[1:03:23] grab them people. Grab a hold of them.
[1:03:26] drag them out there in the water and
[1:03:28] drown them and spin and bring them under
[1:03:30] there and the struggle. There is
[1:03:33] the horror
[1:03:36] animals coming up to the side and
[1:03:38] crocodiles grabbing them in their legs
[1:03:40] and bring them in and tearing them to
[1:03:42] pieces and shredding them.
[1:03:46] Amen.
[1:03:48] People killing each other,
[1:03:52] shooting Charlie Kirk in the head.
[1:03:56] struggle, pain,
[1:03:59] animals,
[1:04:02] getting hit on the road. It's a pain.
[1:04:04] It's groaning.
[1:04:06] Sickness everywhere.
[1:04:08] Hospitals everywhere. People grasping,
[1:04:12] trying to stay alive. It's all groaning.
[1:04:19] What? for that change, that day of sweet
[1:04:23] relief.
[1:04:25] Amen. I didn't tell you the other part
[1:04:28] of talking to angels. Amen. That angel,
[1:04:32] no doubt, will tell me, "Yeah, no doubt,
[1:04:35] but you have went through all of that."
[1:04:37] But we ain't got none of that up here.
[1:04:39] We ain't got no downness. We ain't got
[1:04:41] no valleys up here. We ain't got no
[1:04:44] sickness up here. We ain't got no blues
[1:04:47] up here. We ain't got no depression up
[1:04:49] here. How many's looking forward to that
[1:04:51] day?
[1:04:53] [Applause]
[1:04:55] Everything is good. Woo! We're going to
[1:04:59] holler.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; We're going to praise God.
[1:05:03] But here we are. We're not there yet.
[1:05:07] We're not home yet.
[1:05:13] Amen.
[1:05:15] The whole creation groanth and travaleth
[1:05:17] in pain together until now. And not only
[1:05:19] they, but we ourselves also which have
[1:05:21] the first fruits of the spirit. Hello.
[1:05:23] How many believe? Even though you're
[1:05:25] holy ghost filled.
[1:05:28] Amen. Even we ourselves grown within
[1:05:31] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:05:33] wit the redemption of our body. In other
[1:05:37] words, the change that's supposed to
[1:05:39] come.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; I mean he's looking for the change.
[1:05:44] I'm looking for the change. You're
[1:05:46] expecting the change. But God has to
[1:05:49] come in here and change you a little
[1:05:51] bit. He's got to change me. He's got to
[1:05:54] change the way that we are. He's got to
[1:05:56] take all our bad stuff out.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Everything that's unlike Christ, he has
[1:06:02] to take out. He will take out.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:16] Amen.
[1:06:20] See, brother Bam says right after that
[1:06:22] about we've got it too easy, too soft
[1:06:26] here. Not long ago during the
[1:06:28] depression, why it was easy to find
[1:06:29] people at prayer meeting on Wednesday
[1:06:31] night. On Wednesday night, I said, but
[1:06:33] prayer meeting. But now they can work in
[1:06:36] the defense plants and the union gives
[1:06:38] them much money and they hardly know
[1:06:40] what to do with. And you have to almost
[1:06:43] persuade them in the medium into the
[1:06:47] meeting medium. Amen. Think about it.
[1:06:52] How many knows if you're in a hardship,
[1:06:53] you're in a trial, you get desperate.
[1:06:55] You just have a tendency to Amen. seek
[1:06:58] God more. But when you've got it all
[1:06:59] easy and you got plenty of money,
[1:07:02] I believe Paul told Timothy, "No, man,
[1:07:05] that uh uh a good soldier doesn't
[1:07:08] entangle himself in the affairs of this
[1:07:10] life." I thought, man, how entangled do
[1:07:12] we get ourselves sometimes in the
[1:07:14] affairs of this life? But if you're
[1:07:16] going to fight and you're going to be a
[1:07:18] Christian, you ought to be. Don't get so
[1:07:19] tangled up in this life.
[1:07:24] You ain't got time for God. Ain't got
[1:07:26] time for church. You're too entangled in
[1:07:30] the things of this world.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:41] See, Peter said in first Peter 1, we're
[1:07:45] going to kind of skip over a bunch.
[1:07:49] who are kept by the power of God through
[1:07:51] faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:07:52] revealed in the last time wherein ye
[1:07:55] greatly rejoice though now for a season
[1:07:57] if need be ye are in heaviness through
[1:08:00] manifold trials or temptations
[1:08:04] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:08:07] more precious than of gold that perishes
[1:08:12] though it be tried with fire
[1:08:15] might be found unto praise and honor and
[1:08:17] glory at the appearing ing of Jesus
[1:08:20] Christ. How many knows God in the Leo
[1:08:24] age says, "I counsel thee to bow me gold
[1:08:28] tried in the trial, tried in the fiery
[1:08:32] trial."
[1:08:35] Amen. How many know that's where, Amen.
[1:08:37] God produces gold or deity in your
[1:08:42] heart? Gold represents deity. Those
[1:08:44] trials that come our way, those
[1:08:46] hardships that come our way, that
[1:08:48] suffering that comes our way produces
[1:08:51] gold of God,
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; it produces character.
[1:09:03] P Peter said again in chapter 4 1 Peter
[1:09:07] 4 and verse 11 or 12. Beloved, think it
[1:09:10] not strange concerning the fiery trial
[1:09:12] which is to try you as though some
[1:09:14] strange thing happened to you. In other
[1:09:17] words, my why does this got to happen to
[1:09:19] me? Why did this happen?
[1:09:23] Huh? This is weird. This is stren No,
[1:09:26] it's not.
[1:09:28] No, God is testing you.
[1:09:32] It's more precious. Your tests and
[1:09:34] trials of your faith are more precious
[1:09:36] than gold. How many believes that?
[1:09:40] Because Paul said, "I reckon that the
[1:09:41] sufferings of this world are not to be
[1:09:44] compared with the glory that is revealed
[1:09:48] that will be revealed
[1:09:50] from heaven."
[1:09:52] Amen.
[1:09:55] That's right. But rejoice in so much as
[1:09:58] ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings,
[1:10:03] that when his glory shall be revealed,
[1:10:05] ye may be glad with exceeding joy.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; See, be sober, be vigilant.
[1:10:16] For your adversary endeavor, as a
[1:10:18] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[1:10:20] devour he may devour, who resists
[1:10:22] steadfast in the faith, knowing that the
[1:10:24] same afflictions are accomplished in
[1:10:26] your brethren that are in the world. But
[1:10:28] the God of all grace who has called us
[1:10:30] by his eternal glory by Jesus Christ
[1:10:33] after you have went on a flowery bed of
[1:10:35] ease for a while.
[1:10:38] That don't sound right, does it?
[1:10:40] Everything has been going good for you.
[1:10:44] No. after you have suffered a while,
[1:10:47] make you perfect, establish, strengthen,
[1:10:51] and settle you. Brother B said that even
[1:10:54] Jesus was made perfect by sufferings.
[1:11:03] Amen.
[1:11:08] Amen.
[1:11:11] Here he was, no man that worth
[1:11:14] entangleth himself with the affairs of
[1:11:16] this life, that he may please him who
[1:11:18] hath chosen him to be a soldier.
[1:11:27] Remember that Jesus Christ, the seed of
[1:11:29] David, was raised from the dead
[1:11:30] according to my gospel, wherein I suffer
[1:11:33] trouble as an evildoer, even unto bonds,
[1:11:36] but the word of God is not bound.
[1:11:38] Therefore, I endure all things for the
[1:11:41] elect's sakes, that they may also obtain
[1:11:44] the salvation which is in Christ Jesus
[1:11:46] with eternal glory. This is a faithful
[1:11:48] saying, for if we be dead with him, we
[1:11:51] shall also live with him. And if we
[1:11:54] suffer, we shall also reign with him.
[1:12:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:05] Brother Brandham Church's book, Smyrna
[1:12:07] Church, says, you know, Peter said, is
[1:12:10] it strange that God wants us to develop
[1:12:12] a Christlike character that comes
[1:12:15] through suffering? That's not strange.
[1:12:17] No, sir. He says, "We all have trials.
[1:12:20] We have to be tried and chasened as
[1:12:23] sons." Boy, haven't a lot of us heard
[1:12:25] this a lot in our life. Maybe there's
[1:12:28] some younger folks that haven't heard
[1:12:29] this. I'm here to tell you, if you're
[1:12:32] expecting a flower bed of ease and no
[1:12:34] trials, well, you've come to the wrong
[1:12:36] place.
[1:12:40] Not a one but that goes through it, the
[1:12:43] church that is not suffering and is not
[1:12:46] being tried hasn't got it. It isn't of
[1:12:49] God.
[1:12:51] Woo.
[1:12:54] Not everything's going to keep going
[1:12:56] right all the time, is it?
[1:12:59] When do you really learn to get down on
[1:13:01] your knees?
[1:13:03] Amen. When you're suffering, going
[1:13:05] through hardships, going through trials.
[1:13:09] Amen. See who the Lord chasen us. He
[1:13:11] scorches every son that cometh and who
[1:13:13] he receiveth. And if you're without
[1:13:15] chastisement,
[1:13:19] whereof all are partakers, then are ye
[1:13:22] bastards and not son. Let me tell you
[1:13:24] something. If you will not take the
[1:13:26] correction of the Lord, you're not his
[1:13:28] son.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Chastisement, correction.
[1:13:35] Listen. He says, "This special condition
[1:13:37] in Simrna must be applied to every age.
[1:13:40] There's no age free from it. There is no
[1:13:42] true believer free from it. This is of
[1:13:45] God. This is the will of God. It is
[1:13:47] needful. We need the Lord teach us the
[1:13:49] truth that we are to suffer and be
[1:13:52] Christlike in doing it.
[1:13:57] Amen.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Blessed are you when men shall revile
[1:14:01] you and persecute you and say all manner
[1:14:02] of evil against you falsely for my sake.
[1:14:04] Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great
[1:14:06] is your reward in heaven. For so
[1:14:08] persecuted they the prophets that were
[1:14:10] before you. You see cloudy the cloudy
[1:14:13] skies and storms of life are no signs of
[1:14:15] God's disapproval.
[1:14:22] Well, look what he's going through. Look
[1:14:24] what she's going through. They must have
[1:14:26] some secrets in. They must not be right
[1:14:27] with God.
[1:14:29] Well, you're an ignorant person.
[1:14:32] Hello.
[1:14:35] You must have not gone through some
[1:14:37] yourself. Maybe God needs to send you
[1:14:38] through some that'll make you have
[1:14:39] sympathy for somebody that's suffering
[1:14:41] and going through a hard time. I can't
[1:14:44] think of anything. I can't think of
[1:14:46] anything that is less Christlike for
[1:14:48] somebody to be critical of you,
[1:14:51] criticize you when you're going through
[1:14:53] a hard time. Just get away from me.
[1:14:55] Don't tell me you're a Christian. You
[1:14:58] ain't.
[1:15:00] Why? Because you'll have pity and love
[1:15:02] for those that are suffering.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; A few amens.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:13] How many knows that most of the time the
[1:15:16] truth is most of us learn our lessons in
[1:15:18] the school of heart knocks
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; school of heart knocks
[1:15:25] you may end up in on your back in the
[1:15:27] hospital you may be on the streets see
[1:15:29] no telling where you'll be amen when you
[1:15:31] finally learn hey this isn't what I want
[1:15:35] amen
[1:15:37] neither are bright skies and still
[1:15:40] waters signs of his love and approval.
[1:15:42] Can you imagine? Too many Job's
[1:15:44] comforters around. Why? Cuz Job had
[1:15:47] everything. Boy, God is really with you,
[1:15:49] Job. Man, I'm telling you what, look at
[1:15:51] all your your children and all that you
[1:15:54] got. You're a rich man.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; But when he lost it all and all went
[1:16:00] south, he had some real comforters. You
[1:16:03] are a secret sinner, Job. Why don't you
[1:16:06] just confess it?
[1:16:09] Amen. And it wasn't good for them. Guys,
[1:16:11] now I'm here to tell you, all right, his
[1:16:15] listen.
[1:16:16] Neither are bright skies and still
[1:16:18] waters signs of his approval. How shall
[1:16:21] I prove my love to him? He proved it by
[1:16:23] electing you. How many believes that his
[1:16:26] love is elective love?
[1:16:30] Aren't you glad for that? Oh, it ain't
[1:16:33] always because God's all good to you and
[1:16:35] lets everything go good. No, don't look
[1:16:36] at that. But look, if he chasened who I
[1:16:39] love, I'd rebuke, I chasen. Be zealous,
[1:16:44] therefore, and repent.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; How shall I prove my love to him? by
[1:16:53] believing what he said and by conducting
[1:16:56] myself ami myself with joy amidst the
[1:16:59] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[1:17:03] come
[1:17:04] my
[1:17:06] way.
[1:17:08] Amen.
[1:17:13] How many knows it's easy to love those
[1:17:16] that love you?
[1:17:18] Amen.
[1:17:20] All right, let's talk about We've talked
[1:17:23] a little bit about uh Well, we're not
[1:17:26] done yet.
[1:17:28] Let's go to Peter. And I've got I don't
[1:17:30] have the rest of these. I don't think I
[1:17:32] have. Yeah, I've got one another one
[1:17:38] James.
[1:17:41] And we want to kind of turn a little
[1:17:43] corner here.
[1:17:45] It's not
[1:17:47] too much of a corner because it all ties
[1:17:49] together.
[1:17:53] Actually,
[1:17:55] I want to go to Peter first before I
[1:17:57] read that one.
[1:18:06] First Peter
[1:18:17] And I think brother Brandham might have
[1:18:19] mentioned this, but I'm going to read it
[1:18:20] again.
[1:18:23] First Peter 1
[1:18:26] and verse 6, wherein ye greatly rejoice,
[1:18:29] though now for a season if need be in
[1:18:30] heaviness and manifold temptation. Maybe
[1:18:32] I've read it already. The trial of your
[1:18:34] faith, yeah, I have be much more
[1:18:36] precious than the gold that f that
[1:18:38] perishes. There's another one in
[1:18:44] chapter 2 and verse 19 says it this way.
[1:18:47] This is thankw worthy if a man for
[1:18:50] conscience sake towards God endure grief
[1:18:55] suffering wrongfully.
[1:18:58] For what glory is it when you are
[1:19:00] buffeted for your faults? You take it
[1:19:01] patiently. But when you do well and
[1:19:03] suffer for it, you take it patiently.
[1:19:05] This is acceptable unto God.
[1:19:09] You know, I've learned that not just
[1:19:11] everybody believes in turning the other
[1:19:13] cheek.
[1:19:14] Not just everybody believes in being
[1:19:17] quiet like Jesus was when he was spit
[1:19:20] upon and all these things. But I want to
[1:19:22] say this in the whole manner because
[1:19:24] there is a time to be quiet and there's
[1:19:27] a time to speak up
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; because when Simon mistreated him and he
[1:19:31] suffered like that, Jesus did speak up.
[1:19:33] He wasn't so quiet. He says,"Simon, I
[1:19:35] got something to say to you." Amen. But
[1:19:39] there's other times where he would be
[1:19:40] quiet. Amen.
[1:19:43] But he says, listen, and that's how many
[1:19:47] knows that that's some of the that's
[1:19:49] some of the hardest tests that we'll go
[1:19:51] through. It's when you suffer or
[1:19:54] somebody says something about you that
[1:19:56] isn't true just to let it go.
[1:20:00] No, we going to get up all in his face
[1:20:02] and we we're going to say something,
[1:20:04] right? We're going to put them in their
[1:20:06] place. Yeah, go ahead. But you don't get
[1:20:08] no reward that way.
[1:20:10] See, when when somebody sins and does
[1:20:13] wrong like that,
[1:20:18] you bear his sin, you you you're you're
[1:20:20] bearing his sin.
[1:20:23] Isn't that right? And you do it because
[1:20:25] you love that person
[1:20:29] and you pray for that person. And the
[1:20:32] Bible teaches never to uh when you
[1:20:35] revile, don't revile back. Is that
[1:20:38] right?
[1:20:40] Don't act the way that they act.
[1:20:43] Because in chapter four, it says, "For
[1:20:44] as much then as Christ has suffered for
[1:20:46] us," how many knows that when we were
[1:20:48] unloly,
[1:20:49] he loved us anyway?
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. arm yourselves. Therefore,
[1:20:56] likewise, with the same mind, for he
[1:20:58] that suffered in the flesh has ceased
[1:21:00] from sin. Now notice, if you suffer,
[1:21:04] take it patiently. This is acceptable
[1:21:06] unto God. For even here unto were ye
[1:21:08] called, because Christ also suffered for
[1:21:11] us, leaving us an example that we should
[1:21:13] follow his steps. Who when he was
[1:21:15] reviled, reviled not again. When he
[1:21:17] suffered, he threatened not, but
[1:21:19] committed himself to him that judges
[1:21:21] rightfully. Amen.
[1:21:24] Notice I read that about think it not
[1:21:26] strange concerning the fiery trial
[1:21:28] that's to try it. But rejoice in so much
[1:21:30] that ye are partakers of Christ
[1:21:32] suffering and when his glory shall be
[1:21:35] revealed, ye may be glad with exceeding
[1:21:39] great joy. Peter once again says, "If
[1:21:42] any man suffer as a Christian, let him
[1:21:44] not be ashamed, but let him glorify God
[1:21:47] on this behalf."
[1:21:49] Now, back to our thought talking about
[1:21:53] trials and suffering and tests. James,
[1:21:57] he said it this way. James, a servant of
[1:21:59] the Lord Jesus Christ, to the 12 tribes
[1:22:02] which are scattered abroad. My brethren,
[1:22:04] count it all joy when you fall into
[1:22:07] diverse temptations
[1:22:11] or trials. Knowing this, that the trying
[1:22:14] of your faith workketh
[1:22:18] patience.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It works patience.
[1:22:30] Amen.
[1:22:36] But let patience have her perfect work,
[1:22:40] that ye may be perfect and entire,
[1:22:44] wanting nothing or lacking
[1:22:48] nothing.
[1:22:51] Now, how many knows that that's truly
[1:22:53] when you have to have patience? When
[1:22:55] you're going through a trial,
[1:22:58] when you're going through a test,
[1:23:03] that's right. You're going through a
[1:23:06] trial. Going through a test.
[1:23:12] Amen.
[1:23:15] Romans 5.
[1:23:20] Romans 5 verse one says, "Therefore,
[1:23:22] being justified by faith, we have peace
[1:23:24] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:23:26] By whom also we have access by faith
[1:23:28] into this grace wherein we stand and
[1:23:30] rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
[1:23:34] Now, here's the scripture we want to get
[1:23:35] to. And not only so, but we glory in
[1:23:40] tribulation.
[1:23:44] Whoa.
[1:23:47] in tribulations also knowing that
[1:23:50] tribulation
[1:23:51] workketh patience.
[1:23:54] Amen. So we find that not only do your
[1:23:56] hardships and your test, Amen, they try
[1:24:00] your faith,
[1:24:02] they try your patience, they create and
[1:24:06] make you be patient because the Bible
[1:24:08] says one place that uh like Abraham and
[1:24:11] them they were our example. how that
[1:24:13] they inherited the promises through
[1:24:18] patience.
[1:24:21] Patience.
[1:24:23] I thought of three people that needed
[1:24:26] patience.
[1:24:31] Noah,
[1:24:32] Abraham,
[1:24:35] and us.
[1:24:39] That's right. Noah was 120 years.
[1:24:43] 120 years.
[1:24:45] Can you imagine, brother Troy, him
[1:24:47] coming out after 110 years? Woo! Come
[1:24:50] on, people. I'm here to tell you, it's
[1:24:52] going to rain. He wasn't He didn't let
[1:24:54] it become common to him. It's going to
[1:24:56] rain.
[1:24:58] It's going to rain. And finally, it did.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; He had faith. He had patience.
[1:25:05] Abraham, he had 25 years of patience.
[1:25:09] Ain't that right? 25 years. The Bible
[1:25:12] says that his faith got stronger.
[1:25:16] I want to ask you something just right
[1:25:18] now. Is your faith stronger now than it
[1:25:20] was a year ago?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Is it stronger?
[1:25:26] I know mine is.
[1:25:29] Hey, my patience level is a little bit
[1:25:31] higher, too. How about yours?
[1:25:35] Everybody's patient level a little bit
[1:25:36] higher.
[1:25:38] got to be putting up with me.
[1:25:43] Amen.
[1:25:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:49] Cuz I'm here to tell you that how many
[1:25:50] knows that those trials and things that
[1:25:53] come your way, that is what changes you.
[1:25:58] How many believes that from glory to
[1:25:59] glory, God is changing us?
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:08] That's right. We're changed from glory
[1:26:11] to glory. All right, let me finish this.
[1:26:14] Rejoice in the hope of glory, not also,
[1:26:16] but glory and tribulations also knowing
[1:26:18] that tribulation works patience
[1:26:22] and patience
[1:26:24] experience.
[1:26:26] Amen. Hallelujah. How many knows that
[1:26:29] the one thing that everybody has to
[1:26:31] have, everybody needs
[1:26:35] is experience.
[1:26:39] Been there, done that.
[1:26:44] Amen.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; I know what you're talking about. I've
[1:26:47] experienced it. I've experienced those
[1:26:49] hard places that you couldn't get
[1:26:52] around, couldn't get over it.
[1:26:54] Only a person that's been there knows
[1:26:57] what it's like.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; It tries you to the utmost.
[1:27:06] You know what I've learned to do,
[1:27:07] brother John and Sister Alicia? When you
[1:27:09] get up against the wall and you can't go
[1:27:11] nowhere, I kick back and sit down.
[1:27:18] And I believe that's what brother
[1:27:19] Brandham said. He said, "Just stand back
[1:27:22] and have faith in God and watch God take
[1:27:26] you through.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Don't scratch and claw and make it try
[1:27:29] to make it." No, you can't. You tried.
[1:27:31] It didn't happen anyway. You couldn't do
[1:27:33] it. God has to bring us to those places
[1:27:36] you absolutely can't do nothing about
[1:27:38] it. Tommy knows a lot of us. How many
[1:27:41] knows? Yeah. What I'm talking about?
[1:27:43] Yeah. Just don't know. And you have to
[1:27:45] just sit back, so to speak, get on your
[1:27:48] knees, commit it to God, like brother B
[1:27:50] said, and watch God take you through.
[1:27:55] How many is with you? That's what we're
[1:27:57] counting on God to do for each and every
[1:27:59] one of us in this age. It may look hard.
[1:28:02] It may look impossible, but God is going
[1:28:04] to take it through. We're going to see a
[1:28:07] rapture.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; You might as well shout about it. You
[1:28:11] might as well be happy about it, cuz we
[1:28:13] serve a God. Amen. That has g put us
[1:28:15] through trials. Amen. Give us
[1:28:17] tribulation and it has worked experience
[1:28:20] and experience hope.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:27] My hope is in the Lord from this day on
[1:28:31] till forever more. My hope is in the
[1:28:35] Lord forever more. Forever ever more.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; How many is with me? Forever more. Our
[1:28:43] hope is in God.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. In my life, Lord, be glorified. Be
[1:28:53] glorified. Amen. From glory to glory.
[1:28:56] He's changing me. Changing me. Changing
[1:29:01] me. His likeness and image to perfect in
[1:29:04] me. The love of God shown to the world.
[1:29:08] For he's changing.
[1:29:16] to the heavenly
[1:29:19] his likeness and image to perfect in me.
[1:29:24] The love of God shown to the world.
[1:29:30] Hallelujah.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; How many feels better? I'm getting to
[1:29:34] feel better all the time. Amen.
[1:29:37] Hallelujah. That's right. God knew. God
[1:29:41] knew what it would take. When we get
[1:29:43] over there, Paul, when we get over
[1:29:44] there, he's not going to sit with
[1:29:46] somebody like the devil.
[1:29:50] You see, the devil was up there, his
[1:29:52] right-hand man, young people, right
[1:29:54] beside God. And you know what happened
[1:29:56] with the devil? He let it become common
[1:29:59] to him.
[1:30:01] He didn't enjoy the presence and the
[1:30:03] beauty of God, walking amongst the coals
[1:30:06] and just, oh my, he didn't. And he began
[1:30:08] to think, you know what? I'm not very
[1:30:11] happy with this situation. God's getting
[1:30:14] all the glory. Nobody's looking at me
[1:30:16] and and and giving me any glory. You
[1:30:20] know, I'm right his right-hand man, but
[1:30:22] they bypass me and pray and uh and
[1:30:25] worship him.
[1:30:27] I wouldn't mind being him, you know, may
[1:30:30] be like that. I want to be like the most
[1:30:32] high.
[1:30:33] Amen. I want to be above the stars of
[1:30:35] God. He wanted to be worshiped like God.
[1:30:39] M mm.
[1:30:42] That's why God hates discontentment.
[1:30:46] He hates murmuring.
[1:30:48] He don't like when you allow things to
[1:30:50] become common to you.
[1:30:53] Preaching to become common to you.
[1:30:55] Church to become common to you. Every
[1:30:57] time you sit in them pews, sit in there.
[1:30:59] Sit there. I'll sit with you. Say,
[1:31:02] "Preach, brother." Yeah, I like that.
[1:31:04] Boy, I'll tell you what. Did you hear
[1:31:06] what he just He I'll tell you what he
[1:31:08] just talked about justification or
[1:31:09] predestination. He It was all the word
[1:31:11] of God. Amen. That's right. I don't care
[1:31:14] if I'm there a million years. Amen. Look
[1:31:17] at this. Hey, Gideon. You know, it's
[1:31:19] amazing, isn't it? That grace of God is
[1:31:22] amazing.
[1:31:23] Amen. It ain't coming to me.
[1:31:27] No. Hallelujah. Praise be to God.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; We're going to sing and shout, dance
[1:31:33] about.
[1:31:34] We'll have us a time.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just over there, but here we
[1:31:38] are in the most depressing. You're
[1:31:40] living in the most depressing atmosphere
[1:31:42] that there is.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; I mean, you got to go to work tomorrow.
[1:31:46] Come on, people. I'd rather go through
[1:31:48] shouting through heaven. I don't know
[1:31:49] about you. Ain't that right? But you got
[1:31:51] to go to work. You got to I mean, you
[1:31:53] boys, you got you got worries. You got
[1:31:56] it nice right now. Mama, can you make me
[1:31:57] a sandwich? Mama, what do you got for
[1:31:59] dinner? But one day, you got to make
[1:32:00] your own sandwich. or you got to try to
[1:32:03] find a woman that'll make it for you.
[1:32:05] And when you do that, boy, I'll tell you
[1:32:07] what, everything that comes with it, you
[1:32:08] better be ready for it.
[1:32:11] Responsibility. You're going to have
[1:32:13] rent to pay. You're going to have a
[1:32:14] house bill. This, that, and the other.
[1:32:16] And man, you know,
[1:32:20] that's right.
[1:32:23] But God can take you through. That's why
[1:32:25] you need God in the midst of it all.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; But God's not back to our thought. God's
[1:32:29] not going to be with somebody like the
[1:32:31] devil. No, God's going to be with a
[1:32:33] bunch of people who have went through
[1:32:34] hard times, who have went through
[1:32:37] struggles, who have had to die to
[1:32:39] themselves. When you want to do
[1:32:40] something and say, "Devil, just know I
[1:32:42] don't want to do that. That's not what
[1:32:43] God wants me to do." You've battled it
[1:32:45] out with yourself and say, "God, I want
[1:32:47] you to lead me. I want your will to be
[1:32:49] done in my life."
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The biggest battle you'll have is
[1:32:52] with yourself. Not your mama, not your
[1:32:54] dad, not your church, not your neighbor.
[1:32:56] Your biggest battle is sitting with you.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's this skin right here.
[1:33:01] The greatest enemy you got is this right
[1:33:02] here.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this right here, Gideon. And
[1:33:05] this right here, Daniel. And this right
[1:33:07] here, Paul. Amen. This right here. Up in
[1:33:09] here. It'll try to talk to you and get
[1:33:11] you down.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; But this can also be a blessing.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; This can also be a blessing if you'll
[1:33:18] open it up to God.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let the word come down in
[1:33:23] there. Amen. The Holy Ghost saturate
[1:33:25] your soul by saying, "God, I want to do
[1:33:28] Acts 2:38. I want to be baptized in I
[1:33:31] want to give God my life. I want to give
[1:33:34] God my all. He'll come in here and he'll
[1:33:37] give you peace of mind, peace of heart.
[1:33:39] And I'm here to tell you, there ain't
[1:33:41] nothing like being a Christian. I've
[1:33:42] been doing it since 20 years old. About
[1:33:45] 21 and I get it gets sweeter, sweeter,
[1:33:48] sweeter, sweeter as the days go by,
[1:33:50] brother.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe it's like wine?
[1:33:53] It just gets better all the time.
[1:33:59] But he's going to have people that have
[1:34:01] been tried and tested. He's going to put
[1:34:03] your arms around you. Say, "Well done,
[1:34:06] my son.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Well done. You didn't let it become
[1:34:11] common down here. I know you won't let
[1:34:13] it become common up there. And after
[1:34:16] you've lived with us for a thousand
[1:34:18] years, and we got to go to Gog and
[1:34:19] Magog, and we face the devil again.
[1:34:22] Ain't that right? when he compasses
[1:34:24] about
[1:34:26] when he goes surrounds us again.
[1:34:29] Amen. What does it say? That all the
[1:34:32] armies of heaven follow him and we go
[1:34:35] out there. Amen. And out of his mouth
[1:34:37] goes what? A sharp two-edged sword. Why?
[1:34:40] You're not going to be afraid. I'm not
[1:34:42] going to be afraid. We'll just say speak
[1:34:44] the word. And I'm telling you what,
[1:34:46] we'll obliterate the whole thing and be
[1:34:49] done with it once and for all because
[1:34:51] our faith is in God. We know the true
[1:34:54] power.
[1:34:58] We know what the true power is where it
[1:35:00] truly lies. It's in the word of God. Not
[1:35:03] in gifts, not in shouting, not in
[1:35:05] jumping, but in faith in God's word.
[1:35:14] Amen.
[1:35:18] Well, we're ready to preach now.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; We done got loosened up.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see how long sometimes it
[1:35:28] can take to break through? Sure it does
[1:35:31] sometimes. Why? Because we've got cares.
[1:35:34] We've got things that bother us sometime
[1:35:36] and and so forth.
[1:35:41] I can't wait till I get my new body.
[1:35:44] Amen. Cuz we're we're we're groaning to
[1:35:48] be clothed upon. We're groaning for that
[1:35:51] body.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; That's perfect.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Don't you hate your faults?
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Don't you hate your wrong thoughts?
[1:35:58] Don't you hear everything wrong that you
[1:36:00] I just hate it. I can't wait till there
[1:36:02] be no resistance, no temptation, no
[1:36:04] nothing.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:09] Will have a body like unto his own
[1:36:11] glorious body. For now we see through a
[1:36:15] glass darkly, but then face to face.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Here we got to have faith, but then it's
[1:36:22] going to be face to face. We don't know
[1:36:24] yet what we will be, but we know that
[1:36:26] when we when he appears, we shall be
[1:36:28] like him. Amen.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Last quote
[1:36:36] about change.
[1:36:40] You asked and give permission to
[1:36:43] almighty God. A big thing when you say,
[1:36:48] "God, change my heart, oh God, make it
[1:36:52] ever true.
[1:36:54] Change my heart, oh God, may I be like
[1:36:58] you."
[1:37:01] Amen.
[1:37:02] Sometimes it takes the scruffy, scruffy,
[1:37:06] hard
[1:37:07] scrubbing for God to get things out of
[1:37:09] you. Amen. How many knows that? Real
[1:37:12] trials sometimes just to get things that
[1:37:14] you're not supposed to have or think or
[1:37:17] whatever it might be to get it out.
[1:37:21] Listen to this.
[1:37:26] Brother Brandon, when he went beyond the
[1:37:28] curtain of time,
[1:37:30] he said, "Them old boundary lines of
[1:37:32] nationality will be passed away. I see
[1:37:35] those women so pretty, long hair down to
[1:37:37] their back, long skirts way down. They
[1:37:40] was barefooted. See them men with shaggy
[1:37:42] hair
[1:37:44] down around their neck?" I was like,
[1:37:46] "Down around their neck? Mine ain't
[1:37:48] quite that long. So maybe it'll be a
[1:37:49] little longer. I don't know."
[1:37:53] Amen. I don't don't nobody go getting
[1:37:56] long hair here
[1:37:59] man. But when I read that I was like I
[1:38:01] know Jesus was down further. How many
[1:38:03] knows that our hair is different than
[1:38:05] what it was then?
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; I I believe I can say it like brother
[1:38:09] Bram said if you want to see what Jesus
[1:38:11] would have looked like, you know, in
[1:38:13] this hour he'd had a short haircut. He
[1:38:15] would have a suit. He'd have one the way
[1:38:17] that the prophet did because that's who
[1:38:18] he backed up. Ain't that right?
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. No bangs in your hair and your
[1:38:24] face and everything else like the
[1:38:26] Beatles and everything else and looking
[1:38:27] like a girl have to go.
[1:38:30] We don't want none of the head shaking
[1:38:32] or on the evening tabernacle. Hello. Get
[1:38:35] it cut or do something. Hello. That's
[1:38:38] right. I'd say different spirit. Amen.
[1:38:41] Shaggy hair around their neck. Red
[1:38:43] heads, blackheads, different colors. And
[1:38:45] they were throwing their arms around me.
[1:38:46] I could feel them. Their hands. God is
[1:38:48] my judge. This is a sacred book open. I
[1:38:50] could feel them just as I feel my hands
[1:38:52] in my face. They were throwing their
[1:38:54] arms around me. No sensation of women
[1:38:55] like you would have now. I don't know
[1:38:57] how holy I don't care how holy you are,
[1:38:59] who you are, what kind of a preacher you
[1:39:01] are, priest or whatever you might be.
[1:39:02] There's no man that could put his throw
[1:39:04] his arms around a woman around her
[1:39:06] without having human sensation. That's
[1:39:08] exactly the truth. But brother, when you
[1:39:09] pass beyond this here, it ain't that way
[1:39:12] there. Amen. How many believe that,
[1:39:15] brother? You can hug each other now and
[1:39:17] Amen. it all you want to, but you wait
[1:39:19] till you get over there for over for
[1:39:21] that. Amen. Praise the Lord. Listen,
[1:39:23] it's impossible. It's all love.
[1:39:25] Everything is real, brother, and
[1:39:26] everything is real, genuine, sister.
[1:39:28] There's no death, no sorrow, no
[1:39:30] jealousy. Nothing can enter there. And I
[1:39:32] said, Lord, that's what I'm here at the
[1:39:34] church for. Trying to set the church in
[1:39:36] order, telling you, brother, sister,
[1:39:39] there's only one thing that can enter
[1:39:41] that, and that's perfect love.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:46] How many knows that when you're
[1:39:48] suffering wrongfully and all these other
[1:39:49] things, it really tests whether you got
[1:39:51] perfect love or not. That's one of the
[1:39:53] harder things to do. Amen. To really
[1:39:55] have love if if you're done wrong. Not
[1:39:58] now listen, nothing else can enter
[1:40:00] there. Not because you're loyal to the
[1:40:01] brand tabernacle, Methodist church,
[1:40:03] Baptist church, or whatever it is. He
[1:40:05] says, not because you spoke with tongue,
[1:40:07] dancing in the spirit, because you cast
[1:40:08] out devils. Amen. Move mountains with
[1:40:11] faith. That's all right. Amen. But
[1:40:13] unless that something of real perfect
[1:40:15] love is there. Now notice he says then
[1:40:20] after that he says this way that's what
[1:40:22] bothers me though to preach to you
[1:40:24] people and I'm not saying that you know
[1:40:26] as far as us saying well you ain't right
[1:40:28] but brother Brandham was telling those
[1:40:30] folks I am telling preaching to you
[1:40:32] people. He says don't remain on the same
[1:40:34] condition that you've been going. How
[1:40:36] many of us would say Lord Lord if I'm
[1:40:39] not in the condition I should be father
[1:40:41] help me to change. Amen.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Change my heart. If
[1:40:46] this goes for here and people listening,
[1:40:48] if you're not the way you're supposed to
[1:40:50] be, you listen to your prophet what he
[1:40:53] says. Don't con continue the same
[1:40:56] condition that you've been going in,
[1:40:58] change now.
[1:41:01] Change now. Hear me as I say this. Thus
[1:41:04] sayaith the Lord. And then he says, I've
[1:41:07] you know, I've never called me this, but
[1:41:08] I've preached a millions and all these
[1:41:10] other things. I don't claim to be a
[1:41:12] prophet, but you listen to me. Again, he
[1:41:14] comes back to thus sayeth the Lord. Thus
[1:41:16] sayaith the Lord, it'll take perfect
[1:41:18] love to put you in that place because
[1:41:20] that's all there is there.
[1:41:25] I'm going to close with saying something
[1:41:26] I Well, no, I'm not quite done.
[1:41:30] For that's all there was there. No
[1:41:32] matter how many religious demonstrations
[1:41:35] or how good a deeds that you done or
[1:41:37] whatever it might have done, hello. It
[1:41:38] won't count nothing on that. It'll take
[1:41:40] perfect love. Amen. How many knows it
[1:41:43] doesn't matter how much we dance, shout,
[1:41:45] and all these other things. You know, we
[1:41:47] like that. We do that.
[1:41:50] But that's not where it's at. It's in
[1:41:52] heaven. That perfect love. Then he says,
[1:41:54] "So whatever you do, you lay aside
[1:41:58] everything else. Make other things less
[1:42:00] important." And I didn't begin this like
[1:42:01] I wanted to at the beginning, but I'm
[1:42:03] here to tell you that the things of this
[1:42:05] life, the devil will try to make us
[1:42:07] think that the things of this world are
[1:42:09] more important sometimes than God.
[1:42:11] They're not.
[1:42:13] How many believes the most important
[1:42:14] thing is to lay aside everything, every
[1:42:17] weight, everything that besets us. Amen.
[1:42:20] Everything else until you are just so
[1:42:21] filled with the love of God till you can
[1:42:23] love those who hate you.
[1:42:28] Amen. I think back to my thought and
[1:42:31] that is most of us know what it's like
[1:42:33] to have hurt feelings. We all know what
[1:42:35] it's like to have bitterness and we all
[1:42:38] know what it's like to sometimes go to
[1:42:40] funerals or to weddings or to get
[1:42:43] togethers and if you aren't careful.
[1:42:46] Amen. When those things are there,
[1:42:48] there's just some funny feelings around.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; How many knows that there's some funny
[1:42:54] feelings around? I don't like funny
[1:42:56] feelings. Let me tell you, when we get
[1:42:59] over there, there's not going to be any
[1:43:00] funny feelings.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; We're not going to have to avoid
[1:43:03] somebody or this, that, or the other
[1:43:04] because the feelings are funny.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; It's all perfect love. Everybody has
[1:43:09] everything cleared up.
[1:43:13] [Music]
[1:43:14] How many knows? Anybody that claims to
[1:43:16] be a message believer, anybody that has
[1:43:19] is claims to be a Christian, if you have
[1:43:21] ought against your brother or if there's
[1:43:23] any problem between you, Amen, you ought
[1:43:25] to be able to get him together and y'all
[1:43:27] should come to the altar and pray
[1:43:29] together and ask each other to forgive
[1:43:31] each other. Amen. Have love one for
[1:43:33] another. If you can't do that, you don't
[1:43:35] know the blood of Jesus Christ. You
[1:43:37] don't know how to get things out from
[1:43:39] Amen. Get it under the blood and get rid
[1:43:41] of those feelings.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:51] Going to have don't have to say over
[1:43:53] there. Oh, that was awkward.
[1:43:58] Oh, that was weird.
[1:44:00] No, none of that over there. How many
[1:44:02] glad for that?
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Press on, church. Keep pressing on.
[1:44:08] Don't let things become common to you.
[1:44:10] Don't let church become common to you.
[1:44:11] Don't let become got God become common
[1:44:13] to you. Amen.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got down to today. I got down
[1:44:19] on my knees and I've prayed longer than
[1:44:20] I had in a while. Lord, don't let it
[1:44:23] become common to me because if it
[1:44:25] becomes common to me, what are you going
[1:44:27] to do? Amen. Stand with me tonight.
[1:44:31] Amen.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Joe. Thank you for
[1:44:35] praying.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know how much I pray, Lord,
[1:44:39] direct my thoughts. Direct, Lord,
[1:44:42] because I want out of the picture. I
[1:44:44] want the Holy Ghost to speak. Don't you?
[1:44:46] I want God to speak to my heart.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Heads bowed, eyes closed.
[1:44:55] How many tonight would confess and say,
[1:44:57] you know, I let it become common. I've
[1:45:00] let God to become too much too common to
[1:45:02] me. Gotten too lukewarm, and I want to
[1:45:04] get back on fire. I want to be right
[1:45:06] there in tune with the Lord. God bless
[1:45:09] those hands, Lord Jesus. You see the
[1:45:10] hands up everywhere. We're living in an
[1:45:12] atmosphere that drags us down. We have
[1:45:15] living We're living in a world where so
[1:45:18] many things can attract our attention.
[1:45:20] Catch our eye. Take our time, Father.
[1:45:23] And we ask God you'll forgive us of
[1:45:25] where we have allowed it to, Lord. where
[1:45:27] we haven't had that prayer time with
[1:45:29] you, Lord, where we've let perhaps our
[1:45:31] phone take more time than what we spend
[1:45:33] with you, listening to your prophet,
[1:45:35] praying for this service and really
[1:45:37] coming with expectations, Lord, sitting
[1:45:39] at the edge of our seat and pulling on
[1:45:41] the gift of God that's before us, Lord.
[1:45:44] We don't have long, God. And I pray in
[1:45:45] the name of Jesus Christ that you'll
[1:45:47] bless these people with readiness and
[1:45:49] being ready for that hour, Lord Jesus,
[1:45:52] and help us, God, even as you send us
[1:45:54] and you you put us through things, God.
[1:45:56] You allow things come our way, Lord
[1:45:58] Jesus, to prove us, to try us, to make
[1:46:01] us stronger in you, Lord Jesus, to mold
[1:46:04] our character that it'll be fit to rule
[1:46:06] and reign with you, Lord. We'll sit
[1:46:08] there with you. The devil, he's cast
[1:46:11] out, and we'll take his place, so to
[1:46:13] speak. We'll be right there beside God.
[1:46:15] We'll be his bride. And you won't become
[1:46:18] common to us. We won't be unappreciative
[1:46:21] of you of what you've done, God. And I
[1:46:23] pray, Lord Jesus, that you'd have as
[1:46:24] each one here, Lord, and each one
[1:46:27] listening tonight, God, I pray that
[1:46:29] you'll prepare them, get them ready.
[1:46:31] Help them to lay aside every weight, the
[1:46:34] sin, that sin that does so easily beset
[1:46:36] them and the thing that distracts them
[1:46:38] from the real purpose of what you have
[1:46:40] us here for. Everything else is
[1:46:43] secondary. It's our walk with you that
[1:46:45] is first and foremost. And we ask God
[1:46:47] that you would strengthen that with
[1:46:49] great might, Lord Jesus. And we'll be
[1:46:51] careful, Father, to be on our prayer
[1:46:53] bones, Lord, seeking you every day, Lord
[1:46:56] Jesus, and saying, "Father, lead us and
[1:46:57] guide us by your spirit on a daily basis
[1:47:01] so that we could have the kind of walk
[1:47:02] that your prophet did, Lord, that we
[1:47:04] could hear the voice of God say, "Turn
[1:47:06] here and go down this street and go turn
[1:47:09] here or or do this or do that or or no
[1:47:12] matter how much the plane is about to
[1:47:14] take off and you think you're going to
[1:47:16] miss this, that or the other." Help us
[1:47:17] to override that and listen to your
[1:47:19] voice, God. in our lives, Lord Jesus,
[1:47:22] and follow your path, Lord Jesus, as I
[1:47:25] have learned even in the last week,
[1:47:27] Father. I thank you, Lord, for what you
[1:47:29] taught me, the lesson that you taught
[1:47:30] me, Lord Jesus, and the closeness that
[1:47:33] you have brought me through it all,
[1:47:34] Lord. I thank you, Father. And I ask,
[1:47:36] God, that you'll once again, Lord, just
[1:47:38] continue to pour out your spirit upon
[1:47:40] each member of this church here, Lord.
[1:47:42] May we pull together like never before,
[1:47:45] Father. May we be soldiers and keeping
[1:47:47] our guard up, Lord Jesus, and keeping
[1:47:50] our shields up, Father. Not letting the
[1:47:52] enemy come in in any way, Lord. I don't
[1:47:54] know why I felt like I have, Lord.
[1:47:57] Perhaps there's somebody I've thought
[1:47:59] perhaps there's somebody that's not
[1:48:01] where they ought to be. Somebody that's
[1:48:03] not okay.
[1:48:05] Maybe they're not saying it. I don't
[1:48:07] know just what it is, Lord, but I don't
[1:48:08] feel that way unless there's usually
[1:48:10] something going on. And I pray God, if
[1:48:12] there is someone like that, Lord, may
[1:48:14] they may they come out out of it, Lord
[1:48:17] Jesus, and know that if they need to
[1:48:19] talk, if they need to get it off their
[1:48:20] chest, that we're here for them. We're
[1:48:22] for them, Lord Jesus. And we ask, God,
[1:48:24] that you would, Lord, bring them out and
[1:48:27] help them to be okay, Lord Jesus.
[1:48:29] Father, for I bear the burden of each
[1:48:31] and every one, Lord. And I pray, God,
[1:48:33] that everybody's all right, Father.
[1:48:37] And if not, Lord, they'll get serious,
[1:48:39] Lord Jesus, and get right with you,
[1:48:42] Lord.
[1:48:43] We ask this in Jesus name. Amen. And
[1:48:47] amen. God bless you, church. Thank you
[1:48:49] for being a little patient. We went a
[1:48:51] little longer, but I think that was
[1:48:53] okay. Amen. Thank you, young people. We
[1:48:55] love y'all. Amen. Y'all ever need us any
[1:48:57] for anything, we're here. Amen. That
[1:49:00] goes for everybody. Amen. Anybody needs
[1:49:03] prayer? Amen. Janette, just play
[1:49:06] something soft.

[1:53:09] He speaks to me
[1:53:16] and I agree.

[1:53:29] I feel the poor.
