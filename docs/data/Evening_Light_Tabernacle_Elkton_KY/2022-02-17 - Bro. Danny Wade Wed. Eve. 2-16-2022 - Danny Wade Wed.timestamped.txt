[37:56] [Music]
[38:02] [Applause]
[38:06] [Music]
[38:10] um
[38:29] i didn't get to miss any fellowship or
[38:31] anything it just happened to me on the
[38:33] way back from the banquet to the place i
[38:35] was staying
[38:36] but um anyways um
[38:39] turn with me if you will to
[38:41] romans
[38:43] 12 and
[38:45] verse
[38:46] 1.
[39:13] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[39:15] mercies of god that you present your
[39:17] body is a living sacrifice holy
[39:19] acceptable to god which is your
[39:21] reasonable service and be not confirmed
[39:24] conformed to this world
[39:29] but be therefore transformed by the
[39:31] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[39:34] that what is
[39:35] that good and acceptable for perfect
[39:38] will of god
[39:40] who is he that overcometh the world
[39:44] oh that was just
[39:47] my title for the next verse anyways um
[39:50] so uh
[40:01] last time i was sick it took me a while
[40:03] to get back to exercising and working
[40:05] out sometimes we get spiritualistic
[40:08] spiritually sick and it takes time for
[40:11] us to get back to exercising our faith
[40:13] and working out
[40:15] our spiritual muscles by reading the
[40:17] word
[40:18] and praying
[40:21] now i was just um thinking for like a
[40:25] while about like
[40:27] um
[40:28] like
[40:29] overcoming the things of the world there
[40:31] there is two types of christians the
[40:34] christian
[40:35] who just wants to go to heaven and
[40:37] simply accept jesus as savior
[40:41] oh yeah you can be seated sorry
[40:44] um
[40:48] and
[40:50] um
[40:58] simply accept jesus as savior and and
[41:01] not as lord because they want to
[41:02] continue in sin and i'll justify it by
[41:05] saying
[41:06] we're all imperfect
[41:08] and and they'll say say that um
[41:11] you know
[41:13] i'll have sin the bible says all of sin
[41:15] and and then they go on living drinking
[41:18] and smoking cussing and everything else
[41:22] sure we we all make mistakes sometimes
[41:25] and and we sin sometimes
[41:27] but we're not supposed to do it
[41:29] willingly and every single day
[41:31] and and people live like that and i've
[41:34] actually met christians at
[41:37] at work
[41:38] that um
[41:41] at the place i used to work at
[41:43] um
[41:43] that said that oh i'm i'm a christian
[41:46] you know and and then i say and see the
[41:50] way that they live
[41:52] you can't tell that then um
[41:55] you can tell that she was a christian by
[41:57] the her actions because actions speak
[42:00] louder than words i didn't even know she
[42:03] she considered herself a christian and
[42:05] believed in in christ but but she had
[42:09] accepted jesus christ as
[42:12] her savior
[42:13] but not as lord see see
[42:16] we we all want to
[42:18] um go to to heaven but
[42:22] but not everyone and wants to to live
[42:24] every single day for for jesus christ
[42:28] not everyone wants to take up the cross
[42:30] and follow him because it's the hardest
[42:31] thing that anyone can do
[42:35] and
[42:37] so
[42:39] that's what we're supposed to take up
[42:41] our cross and follow christ
[42:43] deity not not live like everyone else
[42:46] and she obviously doesn't read her bible
[42:49] because i know her bible doesn't doesn't
[42:51] say to live like that
[42:54] proclaiming to be a christian but her
[42:56] life says otherwise
[43:00] don't think that you can't overcome a
[43:02] bad habit or repetitive sin we are meant
[43:06] to overcome sin through christ who gives
[43:09] it's not by our own power that that we
[43:12] overcome these things
[43:14] we we don't we cannot overcome anything
[43:17] by our own power
[43:19] if you if you did try to overcome sin
[43:23] and without the holy ghost it becomes
[43:26] a legalism
[43:28] religion it just becomes religion you
[43:31] can take on religion
[43:33] and and not have the holy ghost you can
[43:35] you can and do that too there there's
[43:38] uh this they say how that um
[43:41] religious people are so judgmental we we
[43:45] um
[43:49] the thing is you're either gonna be
[43:51] religious you're gonna you're gonna be
[43:54] a christian a follower of christ there's
[43:56] a difference between being religious and
[43:58] being a christian
[44:02] and
[44:02] [Music]
[44:05] so when you've been born again your
[44:07] desires will change and
[44:09] and with christ in you
[44:12] you cannot willingly sin it's it's
[44:14] impossible
[44:15] and unless
[44:17] um of course um
[44:22] well unless uh
[44:24] of course you can you can still
[44:26] backslide but but if you if you return
[44:29] and um back then and um
[44:35] you can you can be a um
[44:37] forgiven and redeemed um
[44:41] anyways
[44:42] uh
[44:43] i was thinking about like putting on on
[44:44] the whole armor of god um
[44:47] like ephesians 6 and stuff the bride is
[44:51] is uh dressed in the word that that is
[44:54] is her armor and she goes exactly with
[44:56] this word and does not does not go a
[44:59] step anyway outside of this word
[45:02] and she puts on this whole armor of god
[45:06] and
[45:07] and um
[45:10] does not
[45:11] stray away from the the word
[45:14] and
[45:25] you can't expect god to be your source
[45:27] of happiness when the world is your
[45:29] source of satisfaction
[45:32] there's where we go wrong when we start
[45:34] to compromise and allow worldly things
[45:36] into our homes and start to look at the
[45:37] things of the world rather than god we
[45:39] need
[45:40] we bring spiritual sickness upon us when
[45:42] we do that sometimes we need a good dose
[45:45] of spiritual medicine to get us back
[45:47] well again
[45:49] to be an overcomer of any type of
[45:51] disease
[45:56] any type of disease that can't be cured
[45:57] by
[45:58] traditional medicine
[46:00] when a doctor say they they can't help
[46:02] you and everything seems
[46:05] hopeless
[46:07] if if you go to be prayed for and you
[46:09] come with expectation and believe that
[46:12] god's going to heal you you're going to
[46:13] be healed but it takes faith
[46:18] the the battle is sick
[46:20] a sick person
[46:21] and once a miracle fights is a fight
[46:24] against doubt because that's what will
[46:26] prevent you from receiving your healing
[46:28] but once you've overcome that fear and
[46:30] doubt that says you're you're going to
[46:32] always stay the same and you rise above
[46:35] that and let faith take over and there's
[46:37] not devil in hell that can stop you from
[46:39] being healed
[46:55] now now uh this um
[46:58] in a 1 john
[47:00] um 5
[47:01] 3 to 6
[47:03] for this is the love of god that we keep
[47:05] his commandments and his commandments
[47:07] are not grievous
[47:09] for whatsoever
[47:11] is born of god overcometh the world and
[47:14] this is the victory that overcometh the
[47:17] world even our faith who is he that
[47:19] overcometh the world but he that
[47:21] believeth that jesus is a son of god so
[47:25] so i i say
[47:27] um
[47:27] if you are here in in this message today
[47:30] you are an overcomer because it is
[47:34] not by our own strength and um not by
[47:38] our own strength are we made overcomers
[47:40] but through christ we are made
[47:42] overcomers
[47:50] now i was reading um
[47:52] well i was watching this video a while
[47:54] ago
[47:55] it's about um eagles every eagle
[47:59] when the time comes for them to learn to
[48:01] fly the mother eagles remove the comfort
[48:05] layers from the nest so the eaglets get
[48:07] come uncomfortable and then she starts
[48:10] throwing the iglets out of the nest
[48:13] can you imagine being a little eagle and
[48:16] your mother is throwing out of the nest
[48:18] and in
[48:20] making you uncomfortable and stuff what
[48:23] kind of love is that
[48:25] now um
[48:28] she starts throwing eaglets out of the
[48:30] nest
[48:31] she does it daily and repeatedly until
[48:34] the eaglets learn to fly until the
[48:37] eaglets become
[48:39] fearless grow stronger and eventually
[48:41] they fly in the sky that's kind of like
[48:44] how how god is with us
[48:47] we might be put in uncomfortable
[48:49] situations we might be put in in places
[48:52] we don't want to be
[48:53] but but he's doing it for our own good
[48:56] that we might be able to to become
[48:58] stronger see when bad fit things come
[49:02] when
[49:03] when bad things come our way instead of
[49:07] crying out and
[49:08] wondering why
[49:10] why this is happening to us and stuff so
[49:13] sometimes you got got to
[49:16] grow with your environment grow stronger
[49:18] instead of instead of being
[49:22] thinking that that um
[49:24] [Music]
[49:26] see when
[49:28] usually when a um uh prisoner i was this
[49:31] just came to my mind when a prisoner
[49:33] gets thrown in prison a lot of them they
[49:35] will begin to start working out and get
[49:37] getting all muscular and strong
[49:41] so so in it
[49:43] maybe some of them have been wanting to
[49:46] work out all of a sudden they get thrown
[49:48] in prison now now they
[49:50] now they finally are starting to
[49:52] get get stronger
[49:55] so you have to learn how how to train
[49:58] hard in a word in
[50:00] in in prayer and push yourself outside
[50:03] of your comfort zone to fight against
[50:05] the enemy to keep fighting over and over
[50:07] again until eventually sore above all
[50:10] the things he throws at you soar above
[50:12] the fear above the doubt and become an
[50:14] overcomer
[50:18] uh now some people
[50:20] um
[50:21] we we begin to to think
[50:24] uh i was i i read this um
[50:28] this story
[50:30] a while ago
[50:31] well actually
[50:33] i uh
[50:34] seen this on
[50:37] yeah i've seen this on it on a um
[50:42] well this uh
[50:44] this is a story from a
[50:46] a little kid in the movie called the
[50:48] pursuit of happiness what he's it's a
[50:51] little kid he said one day a man was
[50:54] drowning in the water and a boat came by
[50:58] and said do you need any help and he
[51:00] said no thanks god will save me another
[51:03] boat came by and said do you need any
[51:05] help and he said no thank you god will
[51:07] save me
[51:09] that then he drowned and went to heaven
[51:11] and
[51:12] and said god why didn't you save me and
[51:14] god said i sent you two big boats you
[51:16] dummy
[51:18] so
[51:22] so so sometimes sometimes you think you
[51:25] you can be
[51:27] expecting something from god and then
[51:30] sometimes you're just supposed to climb
[51:32] up onto the boat but you said you expect
[51:34] something
[51:36] something greater god is going to pick
[51:37] you up and and bring you to the shore
[51:40] when he sends help sometimes we need to
[51:43] climb onto the boat
[51:45] and and not reject a help when when it
[51:48] comes our way
[51:54] now um
[51:57] doubt is is the believer's worst enemy
[52:01] and it's satan's biggest weapon we all
[52:03] experience doubt and it tries to take
[52:05] faith's place but it is
[52:07] our duty to overcome it and trust in god
[52:10] but
[52:11] but now
[52:13] faith is an overcomer
[52:15] and those with faith overcome it's that
[52:18] simple faith sees the situation and
[52:21] knows everything will be all right those
[52:23] with faith see past the doubt and
[52:25] confusion and learns to always trust in
[52:28] god faith itself is an overcomer so if
[52:32] we can bring ourselves to a place to
[52:34] always believe and have faith we will be
[52:38] overcomers and overcome everything that
[52:40] gets in our way
[52:42] see
[52:43] sometimes we think man
[52:47] things that aren't going the way that
[52:50] you planned it and and all of a sudden
[52:53] and things will
[52:55] try to
[52:57] to hinder you from getting in a closer
[53:00] walk with god and
[53:02] sometimes we need to
[53:04] um
[53:05] get on our knees to pray that god helps
[53:08] you overcome it because
[53:10] as he will help you overcome it and but
[53:13] you have to be able to to climb onto the
[53:16] boat though that he brings towards you
[53:19] and to help you overcome everything and
[53:22] to overcome those waters and not drown
[53:24] like this guy that avoided every single
[53:27] pose
[53:35] now um i remember when i had
[53:38] stage fright and i still do a little bit
[53:41] because you saw how nervous i was when i
[53:43] started again even though this is the
[53:45] third time i've been up here but
[53:48] i remember when i had stage fright and i
[53:50] couldn't hardly even talk
[53:52] to anyone because i was so shy i
[53:54] remember in sunday school one time i
[53:57] volunteered to dismiss the class in
[53:59] prayer because
[54:01] i would get rewarded points and so we
[54:04] all all about our heads and and then and
[54:08] i was supposed to pray and then all of a
[54:10] sudden my mind just went blank
[54:12] and i couldn't think of anything
[54:14] i i was just stuck in it
[54:18] and it was just a really awkward silence
[54:22] that was that was very embarrassing
[54:25] but
[54:27] but here i am now
[54:30] um up here preaching i i definitely have
[54:33] come a long way
[54:34] in overcoming that um
[54:38] overcoming that shyness and awkwardness
[54:44] come to think of it i've i've overcome a
[54:46] lot i'm not
[54:47] sure how
[54:49] but it was a long process sometimes
[54:51] sometimes it can take a long time to
[54:53] overcome some things so sometimes it
[54:56] might be
[54:57] something that
[54:58] could take weeks could take years to
[55:00] overcome it but
[55:02] but if i just keep pressing on and keep
[55:05] trusting god and you will overcome it
[55:08] just
[55:09] stick with with this word and every
[55:11] everything that that satan throws
[55:13] against you if you stay with this word
[55:15] if you if you you respond back
[55:18] with with um
[55:20] with scripture you'll always beat the
[55:23] devil every every single time
[55:28] so
[55:29] you know what i was i was thinking
[55:32] think of it like like this
[55:34] um
[55:36] satan and comes like like the the giant
[55:39] like um
[55:42] like like a giant like that let let's
[55:44] just say you're you're david and here
[55:46] comes um satan and the goliath but but
[55:50] god's given you you the authority to to
[55:54] take him out god so told you to take him
[55:56] out and and you you stand there where
[55:59] with with
[56:00] the word on your heart and satan and
[56:03] comes and says
[56:07] you come to me with
[56:08] with
[56:09] a
[56:11] a slingshot
[56:17] exactly here what he said but i'm pretty
[56:19] sure he didn't say it that way
[56:22] but
[56:22] um he
[56:24] think of
[56:25] i'm saying for example
[56:27] um
[56:31] here you are standing against this big
[56:33] giant and and the devil says you can't
[56:36] beat me you're a little a puny little
[56:38] guy how are you gonna defeat me and and
[56:42] you you say because
[56:44] thus saith the lord i heard
[56:47] god uh because of this word
[56:49] i i
[56:51] have overcome you
[56:53] and and you throw that those
[56:56] stones um
[56:58] you stand and firmly on that word and
[57:00] say say devil you've been defeated
[57:04] and and not not by
[57:06] your own strength but
[57:09] because god is with you
[57:25] now um
[57:27] when there's a storm chickens will run
[57:30] and hide all birds i
[57:32] all birds will go and hide in in the the
[57:35] trees or wherever they go and and hide
[57:38] from from the storm
[57:40] but eagles fly above the storm
[57:44] when a storm urm comes
[57:47] in your life
[57:49] you can choose to run it high like a
[57:51] chicken or you can fly above the
[57:53] stormlight like an eagle
[57:56] above the things of the world above all
[57:59] these other denominations and so forth
[58:01] earth and fly above uh sand fly above
[58:05] the
[58:06] devil because you have had the word and
[58:09] if you stand on on that word
[58:12] you cannot fail and and the storm will
[58:14] not harm you
[58:19] and an eagle has a lot of faith in its
[58:23] wings and never worries if its wings are
[58:26] going to be strong enough and the eagle
[58:28] always trusts its wings and nose its
[58:31] wings will be able to get the eagle
[58:34] above the storm
[58:35] amen
[58:37] regardless
[58:39] i mean uh
[58:41] we we need to always trust in god and
[58:44] know that he is always able to bring us
[58:46] above the storm
[58:48] regardless of the way we feel and what
[58:51] we are going through we can always trust
[58:54] in our wings the only way we could fly
[58:58] above all these
[59:00] these denominations and creeds and so
[59:02] forth is with our wings amen the holy
[59:05] spirit is our wings without it we would
[59:07] be lost we'd be like an eagle with no
[59:10] wings
[59:11] what that that eagle
[59:14] wouldn't be able to hunt for fresh meat
[59:17] it would it would eventually die of
[59:19] starvation it would eventually die of
[59:21] starvation yeah so
[59:26] we have the the wings
[59:29] of an eagle to fly above all these other
[59:31] things
[59:41] now i was
[59:42] we're listening to
[59:45] this um sermon by
[59:48] uh brother branham
[59:50] called
[59:52] how can i overcome
[59:54] now um it says here that's the one that
[59:57] that's in you is
[59:59] light and the one that is the wor that's
[1:00:03] in the world is
[1:00:04] darkness so the light has
[1:00:07] proved
[1:00:09] has proved to overcome the darkness and
[1:00:11] then the man that's in christ knows that
[1:00:14] he's
[1:00:15] overcome the things of the world amen it
[1:00:19] has no more ties to you all at all
[1:00:22] you're free walk in the light
[1:00:24] as he is in the light in the blood of
[1:00:28] jesus christ cleanses us from all sin
[1:00:31] and we have fellowship one with another
[1:00:34] there there you are
[1:00:37] he that's in you is greater than he that
[1:00:40] is in the world now if you look back
[1:00:43] you're condemned
[1:00:45] when
[1:00:46] then and you're still in the world but
[1:00:49] if you're living above that
[1:00:52] then he that is in you
[1:00:54] has led you above the darkness
[1:00:58] and then sometimes sometimes we we get
[1:01:02] um
[1:01:03] we get
[1:01:04] it's so so caught up in the moment
[1:01:08] i mean we we all do it we we stopped
[1:01:11] thinking about like the consequences of
[1:01:14] of what we're doing right in that moment
[1:01:17] and we just think about it in the
[1:01:18] in the carnal way of thinking
[1:01:21] you can get this like right now and
[1:01:24] that's how a lot of times um
[1:01:27] that will spark
[1:01:29] a
[1:01:31] a sin that that comes in your life
[1:01:33] because you're thinking about
[1:01:35] what what you're doing in that exact
[1:01:38] moment
[1:01:39] and and
[1:01:40] what you can get right now but
[1:01:42] but we need a um
[1:01:45] a mentality to think
[1:01:48] what
[1:01:49] what will what would jesus do in this
[1:01:52] moment you know because
[1:01:54] if we always think that every single
[1:01:56] time we probably it wouldn't do a lot of
[1:01:58] things that we do
[1:01:59] sometimes and
[1:02:12] in uh here romans 12
[1:02:15] 20 to 21
[1:02:19] therefore if thou an enemy hunger feed
[1:02:21] him if he thirst give him drink for in
[1:02:25] so doing thou shalt he holds a fire on
[1:02:28] his head be not overcome of evil but
[1:02:32] overcome evil with good so whenever
[1:02:36] evil comes your way
[1:02:39] overcome it with good do good to
[1:02:42] overcome
[1:02:44] evil all evil that that satan throws at
[1:02:47] yet that you or people in general will
[1:02:50] throw at you
[1:02:52] overcome it with good and and we all
[1:02:55] know that that the word is good and god
[1:02:58] is good so if we overcome it by the
[1:03:00] scripture will be all right
[1:03:16] amen how many love the lord
[1:03:26] sometimes god will send trials and
[1:03:28] tribulations our way and when he does
[1:03:32] we never like it because a lot of times
[1:03:34] it's just so painful and we we don't
[1:03:36] understand why why god does this to us
[1:03:38] but in reality is to make us stronger a
[1:03:40] soldier never gets
[1:03:42] better at fighting by city on a flowery
[1:03:44] bed of these
[1:03:46] a soldier
[1:03:47] get gets stronger by by experience and
[1:03:51] training sometimes we go through things
[1:03:53] that we can only get out of with faith
[1:03:57] in god that that means
[1:04:00] god is testing your faith and and this
[1:04:04] trial is meant to increase your faith so
[1:04:07] just trust in god sometimes we we get a
[1:04:10] sickness maybe to increase your faith
[1:04:13] and help you go closer to god for we
[1:04:17] know that god is a healer and it's
[1:04:19] up to you to believe and know that he is
[1:04:21] able to deliver you from the sickness
[1:04:24] and whatever everything you may have so
[1:04:29] so i also like like that um what i was
[1:04:32] saying about um
[1:04:34] that
[1:04:35] that person that was drowning in the
[1:04:37] water
[1:04:39] or the the boats came by
[1:04:42] but he had to accept the boat he had to
[1:04:45] accept it he he couldn't and just uh
[1:04:48] otherwise he would drown which he did
[1:04:50] because he didn't accept the the help he
[1:04:52] didn't accept it you have to accept it
[1:04:56] that if if you're sick you have to
[1:04:58] accept the healing
[1:04:59] and you've been healed already just like
[1:05:02] he would have been and saved already
[1:05:05] by the the two
[1:05:07] two boats that came along but but he
[1:05:10] rejected it
[1:05:12] if we we if we reject and
[1:05:15] if we reject god if we reject his help
[1:05:19] then how are we to be delivered how are
[1:05:21] we to be overcomers of these things if
[1:05:24] we don't accept
[1:05:26] the healing if we don't accept
[1:05:28] the the deliverance if we don't accept
[1:05:31] it how can we receive it
[1:05:36] and
[1:05:41] and it's
[1:05:44] it is it is hard sometimes to
[1:05:49] to be an overcomer but every every
[1:05:53] single
[1:05:54] um
[1:05:55] age there's always been being someone
[1:05:59] that god has to be an overcomer god's
[1:06:02] got a people that's overcomers
[1:06:05] i believe
[1:06:06] i believe this night that that um we are
[1:06:10] overcomers
[1:06:12] and we aren't overcomers by by our own
[1:06:15] own um
[1:06:16] works but we are overcomers because of
[1:06:20] christ
[1:06:22] and and because jesus christ has
[1:06:24] overcome
[1:06:26] the cross and has overcome the world
[1:06:31] so that we can be overcomers through
[1:06:33] christ and if you have christ in you
[1:06:36] then you are an overcomer because christ
[1:06:38] is an overcomer
[1:06:40] and and we shall overcome everything and
[1:06:44] we shall overcome the world we cannot
[1:06:46] live in sin if christ is in us we cannot
[1:06:49] live in sin if we are born again we
[1:06:52] won't have that those desires to do
[1:06:54] those things like the world we cannot do
[1:06:57] that
[1:06:58] many people think well
[1:07:00] you've been um born again if you just
[1:07:03] say a few words
[1:07:04] and and you just you just um
[1:07:08] that that's why i remember that they
[1:07:10] said um
[1:07:13] in uh
[1:07:14] vacation bible school i think it was at
[1:07:17] um
[1:07:18] when we were literally went to this uh
[1:07:21] baptist
[1:07:23] um
[1:07:24] vacation bible school and stuff and you
[1:07:26] know how how it is
[1:07:28] i didn't ever understand everything that
[1:07:30] they said how how you'd be um
[1:07:34] saved or born again or whatever if you
[1:07:36] just say a few words
[1:07:39] and um
[1:07:42] uh of course
[1:07:44] i would always i i would always think
[1:07:46] that
[1:07:48] um i could just
[1:07:50] um
[1:07:51] say a few words uh i thought repentance
[1:07:54] was simply um you know your pet and you
[1:07:57] don't do it ever again
[1:07:59] um
[1:08:01] i learned that the hard way that you
[1:08:02] also have the desires if you if you just
[1:08:05] simply say you repent and and not truly
[1:08:08] be born again you'll still have the same
[1:08:10] desires
[1:08:11] and
[1:08:13] and so we we've got to be born again to
[1:08:17] to overcome sin we cannot
[1:08:21] escape sin without being born again
[1:08:23] because even
[1:08:24] in
[1:08:25] trying to do religion and works and
[1:08:28] stuff to try to
[1:08:30] to overcome sin it's
[1:08:34] by our own strength it's it won't be
[1:08:37] sufficient it won't be enough that's
[1:08:40] that's trying to
[1:08:42] to do a legalistic way and
[1:08:45] i remember trying trying to
[1:08:47] to
[1:08:48] be
[1:08:49] a
[1:08:51] legalists trying to try well i was
[1:08:54] trying to
[1:08:55] be
[1:08:56] um get away from sin without being truly
[1:08:59] born again because
[1:09:00] it was only when i i got the baptism of
[1:09:03] the holy ghost
[1:09:04] was when i truly
[1:09:06] didn't desire
[1:09:08] to do any
[1:09:10] sin whatsoever and it is only then that
[1:09:13] that you can truly
[1:09:15] truly be an overcomer if you become born
[1:09:18] again and you have christ in you
[1:09:22] that which christ cannot sin
[1:09:26] and and so
[1:09:27] if you have christ in you you cannot sin
[1:09:30] either
[1:09:31] and and the bible says you cannot sin
[1:09:35] if you're in christ those are in christ
[1:09:37] and there's no condemnation to those
[1:09:38] that are in christ and all those that
[1:09:40] are
[1:09:41] that have sinned now now i i thought
[1:09:44] that you you get born again you cannot
[1:09:46] make any mistakes you cannot mess up of
[1:09:48] course you can
[1:09:50] because we're human beings
[1:09:52] and and all of sin and fallen short
[1:09:58] the
[1:09:59] glory of god i think he was
[1:10:02] fallen short
[1:10:04] and and have sinned
[1:10:06] but the bible doesn't say all
[1:10:08] continuance in and live in sin
[1:10:11] those that are in christ
[1:10:13] those that pick up the cross daily and
[1:10:15] follow him
[1:10:17] don't
[1:10:18] live in sin do they do not live in sin
[1:10:21] because
[1:10:23] because of that so
[1:10:25] um
[1:10:47] now here's some something um
[1:10:52] something to
[1:10:54] think about for a second
[1:10:56] satan fears us
[1:11:00] think about that for a second
[1:11:02] we we have have been given the power to
[1:11:06] overcome everything that satan throws at
[1:11:09] us
[1:11:11] that that's the reason that we've been
[1:11:12] attacked so much is because
[1:11:15] because
[1:11:16] satan is scared of us he he's always
[1:11:19] trying to fight against us and and um
[1:11:23] you might i think it's so hard to to
[1:11:26] overcome um everything that satan and
[1:11:28] throws at you but satan and he's always
[1:11:32] trying to attack us
[1:11:34] and
[1:11:36] and
[1:11:36] but if you think about it satan has
[1:11:38] asked god if he can do something to you
[1:11:42] he has to have permission before he can
[1:11:45] even touch you
[1:11:47] it shows how much more powerful our god
[1:11:49] is so don't ever think a wall is too
[1:11:53] hard to climb or that you can't overcome
[1:11:55] something
[1:11:56] we can do all things through christ
[1:11:59] who strengthens us
[1:12:01] that's when that's what the bible says
[1:12:04] so don't ever doubt
[1:12:06] we are more than conquerors to christ
[1:12:09] amen
[1:12:14] now
[1:12:15] you you can you can say that you're
[1:12:17] you're an overcomer in everything but if
[1:12:21] you don't ever
[1:12:23] have the the right kind of mindset then
[1:12:27] then um
[1:12:29] then you'll just be washed away like
[1:12:30] like
[1:12:31] um
[1:12:34] but uh here's it says in my notes if you
[1:12:38] if you always go around thinking man i'm
[1:12:40] never gonna overcome these things i'm
[1:12:42] i'm not gonna
[1:12:45] overcome these addictions or trials or
[1:12:47] whatever it might be
[1:12:48] if if you have that kind of mindset it
[1:12:51] needs to change because it's what kind
[1:12:53] of attitude you have that will create
[1:12:56] the outcome if you just concentrate on
[1:12:58] what christ did and who he is and
[1:13:00] develop a mindset that because of what
[1:13:03] he did i am i am an overcomer if if we
[1:13:07] get that mindset that we can overcome
[1:13:09] these things not by our own strength but
[1:13:13] through christ who gives us strength and
[1:13:16] and if we take him at his word we will
[1:13:18] overcome everything that tries to stand
[1:13:21] in our way because we can say it is
[1:13:23] written
[1:13:25] now i was i was um
[1:13:28] listening to that
[1:13:29] um
[1:13:31] tape that
[1:13:32] brother branham
[1:13:34] um
[1:13:36] said
[1:13:37] like he preached
[1:13:39] um and he
[1:13:40] he was preaching about
[1:13:42] um
[1:13:43] like
[1:13:45] um lot and his lot's wife
[1:13:49] lot's wife had overcome that um land and
[1:13:54] that she was in
[1:13:55] but it was still in her see sometimes we
[1:13:59] can
[1:14:00] think we can go on outside the city of
[1:14:03] sin and then and then
[1:14:06] if it's still in us
[1:14:08] if if it's still in us then then you
[1:14:11] turn around and she looked back and she
[1:14:13] turned to a pillar of salt because
[1:14:16] she still loved that place
[1:14:19] and it was in her to
[1:14:21] to um to look back to
[1:14:24] that that place was still in her see
[1:14:27] sometimes christians will
[1:14:30] say well i want to accept christ i want
[1:14:33] to to believe in
[1:14:35] in jesus christ i want to go to heaven
[1:14:38] that's always the first thing that comes
[1:14:40] to mind oh if you believe in jesus
[1:14:42] christ you're going to go to heaven you
[1:14:43] won't perish
[1:14:46] but
[1:14:47] if it's still in your heart to do sin
[1:14:50] and you kind of
[1:14:52] they they kind of just
[1:14:54] just um walk out of the the city they're
[1:14:57] like yes i i want to to go to heaven
[1:15:01] and then and then all of a sudden
[1:15:03] they'll start thinking
[1:15:05] man
[1:15:06] such a long road and such a long hard
[1:15:08] road on this road you know
[1:15:11] i love love the way it was before
[1:15:14] just like the the um
[1:15:18] the
[1:15:21] gods
[1:15:22] people
[1:15:23] in
[1:15:24] in egypt
[1:15:25] when they were like
[1:15:27] you know
[1:15:28] um
[1:15:29] yes we want to get out of this place
[1:15:31] it's it's horrible they we're slaves and
[1:15:33] then they want when they got in in the
[1:15:35] desert and they
[1:15:36] or when they um seen that uh river
[1:15:40] when they seen the river they're like
[1:15:45] now we're all gonna be killed
[1:15:48] i guess god god um
[1:15:51] god led us out here to die
[1:15:54] the army's after us to kill us why why
[1:15:57] have you brought
[1:15:58] us out here to die
[1:16:00] and and
[1:16:02] and then and then
[1:16:04] um
[1:16:06] well of course the
[1:16:08] god parted the water theirs and they
[1:16:10] went right through and then when they're
[1:16:11] in the desert they thought
[1:16:13] i want some
[1:16:15] uh water i need water i need food
[1:16:18] and then and they thought
[1:16:20] man it was so nice in egypt
[1:16:22] when
[1:16:23] uh
[1:16:25] when they were there they were like i
[1:16:26] get i would can't wait to get out of
[1:16:29] this place it's horrible and then and
[1:16:32] now now they still had egypt in their
[1:16:34] hearts and because they thought oh it's
[1:16:37] at least we had food and you know it's
[1:16:39] good and that now they're on a harder
[1:16:41] road than they were on before
[1:16:47] and
[1:16:48] and that's how
[1:16:50] we we begin in on this this journey with
[1:16:54] uh
[1:16:55] with god when um that's that's how i was
[1:16:59] when i started in this thing i was like
[1:17:02] you know
[1:17:03] it's
[1:17:04] you i i still had the the world in my
[1:17:07] heart and and that's how how um
[1:17:11] a lot of worldly um people are they
[1:17:14] they're like okay let's go to this
[1:17:15] promised land just like they were
[1:17:18] let's go to this promised land but but
[1:17:20] they don't understand that it's a it's a
[1:17:22] hard road to get to that promise thing
[1:17:24] you have to be able to to
[1:17:27] to endure through it all just that just
[1:17:30] like i was preaching last time
[1:17:32] it's it's a hard journey and you have to
[1:17:34] be able to not give up and keep going
[1:17:37] and and
[1:17:38] [Music]
[1:17:40] and
[1:17:40] and you know sometimes um
[1:17:44] we will
[1:17:46] we always
[1:17:47] have the world in our hearts until
[1:17:50] we become born again and then that's
[1:17:52] that's the old man that we put in it
[1:17:55] that we have to crucify every single day
[1:18:00] and
[1:18:04] and that's how it's gotta be we we have
[1:18:07] to
[1:18:08] to
[1:18:09] get out of the of that place that that
[1:18:12] we were in before or get that out of our
[1:18:15] hearts and we can't do that on our own
[1:18:17] we we have to accept the lord jesus
[1:18:20] christ and and become born again
[1:18:22] and according to the word
[1:18:24] and
[1:18:28] god god didn't choose a bunch of losers
[1:18:31] to be his bride he chose us because he
[1:18:34] knew we would overcome the things of the
[1:18:36] world and choose to serve him instead
[1:18:39] and the fact that you are here today is
[1:18:41] proof that you're an overcomer i'm not
[1:18:43] saying we're overcomers simply by our
[1:18:46] own works but through christ we are made
[1:18:48] overcomers
[1:18:56] and
[1:19:05] and we have to
[1:19:07] put on the whole armor of god to be be
[1:19:09] able to
[1:19:10] overcome these these things and
[1:19:14] and here um
[1:19:18] brother branham said
[1:19:20] what what was
[1:19:22] in there by god at the beginning it
[1:19:24] pressed its way through overcome it
[1:19:27] overcome the shell it overcome the mud
[1:19:30] it overcome the waters it overcome
[1:19:32] everything and what was an overcomer and
[1:19:35] reflected the beauty and glory of god
[1:19:39] that's the way every believer does
[1:19:42] that's the way know it that's the way
[1:19:44] lot did that's the the way look look
[1:19:46] what a mess he was in that that's the
[1:19:49] way moses did that's the way joshua did
[1:19:52] that's the way daniel did that's the way
[1:19:54] shadrach meshach did
[1:19:57] that's the way john the baptist did
[1:20:00] zacharias elizabeth
[1:20:02] that's what that's the way that
[1:20:04] simeon that's the the way that anna
[1:20:07] every one of them did they overcome the
[1:20:10] mud that that that there was around them
[1:20:13] and packed into them stuck their head
[1:20:16] above the thing and shine forth the
[1:20:18] glory of god that's what a real
[1:20:20] christian does
[1:20:23] and and that that's how how it is you
[1:20:26] get away from these other things and get
[1:20:29] away from them these
[1:20:32] uh get away from sodom and and gamora
[1:20:35] that's how how the world is like today
[1:20:37] it's it's getting worse and worse every
[1:20:39] single day and and we have to overcome
[1:20:42] the world and and we have to overcome
[1:20:45] the world and and
[1:20:47] we have to do it
[1:20:50] and
[1:20:51] like i said we cannot do it by our own
[1:20:54] strengths we have to do it and through
[1:20:57] jesus christ who gives us this strength
[1:20:59] and that's why we are overcomers because
[1:21:01] we have overcome the world we've gotten
[1:21:04] away from those things we have
[1:21:07] have taken on a new name
[1:21:10] and we we have
[1:21:12] have
[1:21:15] we have um
[1:21:17] accepted
[1:21:18] in jesus christ and we are
[1:21:24] we are
[1:21:26] uh
[1:21:30] we are are the bride and we we have to
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:34] overcome these things and and sometimes
[1:21:38] it might be
[1:21:39] something that that you're struggling
[1:21:41] with it might be something that that
[1:21:44] you you might still be dealing with
[1:21:47] because i i know that i didn't and
[1:21:49] overcome everything and
[1:21:52] just
[1:21:52] by um
[1:21:55] just in an instant
[1:21:56] i i had to overcome things
[1:21:59] gradually sometimes and you might be it
[1:22:02] might be a
[1:22:05] it might be a repetitive
[1:22:08] sin and it might be
[1:22:11] something that that we
[1:22:13] constantly are sending every single day
[1:22:15] how can i do this i was i've i've been
[1:22:18] there and and and it's it's a hard place
[1:22:21] and and you have to be able to just
[1:22:25] pick up your cross and follow him and
[1:22:27] it's it's the hardest thing that we can
[1:22:29] do if we if we a it can
[1:22:34] and we we can do that because jesus
[1:22:37] christ
[1:22:38] it took
[1:22:41] his cross and now we have to to
[1:22:44] follow him and that that is the the way
[1:22:47] to
[1:22:48] be
[1:22:49] to truly be an overcomer to
[1:22:52] overcome the world and an overcomer is
[1:22:56] one that has accepted jesus christ and
[1:22:59] has been born again
[1:23:01] we we cannot
[1:23:04] stay in in sin and claim to be a
[1:23:07] christian it's not going to work that
[1:23:09] way
[1:23:19] and here it says
[1:23:21] look he showed us how it's done
[1:23:23] how did he do it by the word that's how
[1:23:26] he done it
[1:23:28] for he was the word and jesus said if
[1:23:30] you bite in me and my words and you
[1:23:33] you're back to act two
[1:23:36] word again the the word of promise what
[1:23:39] is the word of promise to every
[1:23:42] christian greater is he that is in you
[1:23:44] than he that is in the world
[1:23:46] then how do i overcome
[1:23:49] not not me but the the word that's in me
[1:23:52] the word is
[1:23:54] god and i
[1:23:56] overcome the things of the world because
[1:23:59] it's the word in me if you bite in in my
[1:24:01] words in you then just ask what you will
[1:24:04] just keep pressing up you're
[1:24:07] coming to the top as sure as anything
[1:24:10] see you got to come to the top
[1:24:14] see we have to overcome the these these
[1:24:16] other other
[1:24:17] their things
[1:24:19] and we have to do it um
[1:24:21] with with jesus christ in prayer always
[1:24:24] is in prayer and and focusing on on god
[1:24:28] and and seeking him to do his perfect
[1:24:31] will and and we we can overcome
[1:24:34] everything that that satan tries in
[1:24:38] and throws at us
[1:24:52] stand if you will
[1:24:55] um
[1:25:00] so so the only way to over overcome
[1:25:04] sin is through jesus christ and we know
[1:25:06] this
[1:25:08] so
[1:25:11] so
[1:25:12] the the only way we can overcome the
[1:25:14] devil is if we put on the full armor of
[1:25:16] god just like here in ephesians
[1:25:19] 6 and
[1:25:21] verse
[1:25:22] 10 to 19.
[1:25:27] also musicians if you come
[1:25:30] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:25:32] lord and in in the power of his might
[1:25:34] put on the whole armor of god that you
[1:25:37] may be able to stand against the
[1:25:38] violence of the devil for we wrestle not
[1:25:40] against flesh and blood but against
[1:25:42] principalities against powers against
[1:25:44] the rulers of darkness
[1:25:46] of this world against spiritual witness
[1:25:49] wickedness in high places see it's
[1:25:54] it's it's always
[1:25:55] um
[1:25:57] satan's always trying to throw his his
[1:26:00] darts at us he's always trying to
[1:26:02] to
[1:26:04] to attack us and if if we
[1:26:08] stick right with that word then we will
[1:26:10] overcome everything we will overcome the
[1:26:13] and every single thing that the devil
[1:26:15] throws at us and
[1:26:18] and uh every every time that
[1:26:22] that
[1:26:22] that satan and tries to
[1:26:25] um distract us and tries to to get us
[1:26:29] away from his word and get us to
[1:26:32] to look to other things i mean he cannot
[1:26:36] pluck us from his hand but he'll he'll
[1:26:38] certainly try to make make our life
[1:26:42] a
[1:26:43] miserable
[1:26:44] and
[1:26:45] and we have to
[1:26:47] keep pressing on we have to keep keep
[1:26:50] keep going and
[1:26:52] and just
[1:26:53] trust in god through it all no matter
[1:26:56] what happens no matter what and what
[1:26:58] comes our way
[1:27:00] and always
[1:27:01] trust in him
[1:27:05] amen we're
[1:27:07] we are
[1:27:08] overcomers not not because we're
[1:27:11] something
[1:27:12] that how great we are but how great he
[1:27:15] is
[1:27:16] how great he is in us
[1:27:18] that that we might
[1:27:20] overcome
[1:27:21] everything
[1:27:23] that
[1:27:23] that's in this world and we are
[1:27:25] overcomers because
[1:27:27] as those
[1:27:29] that are are
[1:27:31] because greater is he that is in us that
[1:27:34] that than
[1:27:35] he that is in the world
[1:27:38] and
[1:27:44] and we we will
[1:27:47] we will
[1:27:48] make it out to the end we will
[1:27:51] be
[1:27:52] overcomers there's in the end we will
