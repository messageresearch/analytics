[38:57] You can be seated a minute. Amen. We
[38:59] have uh one at least one testimony that
[39:01] somebody wants to give tonight. So here,

[39:05] Brad, would you go give her that mic?
[39:07] Sister Janette, she's got a testimony
[39:10] she wants to give. So, Amen. Praise the
[39:12] Lord. Can't wait to hear this, sister
[39:14] Janette.
[39:18] Amen. Always like good news, right?
[39:20] Well, it's it's good and it's bad. Let's
[39:22] put it both ways. Good. To me, to me,
[39:23] it's good.
[39:24] Hold it up there close so we can all
[39:25] hear you.
[39:26] Well, about two years ago, you know, I
[39:28] went to the doctor and like Sister
[39:30] Donna, they told me, you know, go home
[39:32] and get things in order. And u you know,
[39:35] it's pulmonary fibrosis, which is uh
[39:38] thickness of the lungs. So, I've been
[39:42] hanging on, you know, for a year and a
[39:44] half with test and this and that. But
[39:46] then some doctors don't like that it's,
[39:50] you know, three to five years. So, they
[39:52] want to do more test, more test, more
[39:54] tests. But the deal is is they really
[39:57] can't tell me if it's pulmonary
[40:00] fibrosis. But they can tell me it's not
[40:03] asthma, it's not rheumatoid arthritis,
[40:06] it's not lupus. They can tell me what
[40:07] it's not. So, what was it again that
[40:10] they said? They can't tell you that it's
[40:12] not that, but they had said it was.
[40:14] Well, at first he said pulmonary
[40:16] fibrosis,
[40:17] right?
[40:17] And then the deal is as you progress,
[40:21] you're supposed to have honeycomb shapes
[40:23] show up in the lungs.
[40:25] Mine hasn't progressed that far yet.
[40:29] It's slow. It's very slow.
[40:31] Hold on.
[40:32] Yeah. And a lot of it's got to do with
[40:35] the diet and and my genetic makeup over
[40:38] the years.
[40:39] Yeah.
[40:40] And uh with talking to the doctor today,
[40:44] I mean, she took eight vials about four
[40:46] or five weeks ago and was testing me for
[40:49] everything under the sun. And the only
[40:51] thing it come back and showed and I'm
[40:54] like, "Sister Lord, there's inflammation
[40:56] in the body. There's only three stages.
[40:59] You've got the mild, moderate, and then
[41:01] very high. Mine's 5.5, which is
[41:04] moderate. But they tell me it's only
[41:07] going to go one way,
[41:09] which God has blessed me so much. Yeah.
[41:12] Because my symptoms are not what they
[41:15] think they should be. They think they
[41:17] should be so much worse. It's not funny.
[41:19] Praise the Lord. But in this last scan I
[41:22] had, the technician himself put it right
[41:26] there on the paper and said that
[41:28] pulmonary fibrosis is so rare.
[41:32] The chances are it wasn't that. But then
[41:35] the tests that come out show today and
[41:37] talking to the doctor said that's what
[41:39] everything's showing because nothing
[41:42] else is showing up.
[41:44] And my praise is I've got a great
[41:48] physician. It's the only thing I got
[41:50] because no other doctors can tell me
[41:52] anything in this world.
[41:53] That's right.
[41:54] And so my faith is in my position.
[41:57] That's right.
[41:57] And I I'm going to go the way he wants
[41:59] me to go. I can't say whether it's going
[42:02] to be good or go bad because it's in his
[42:04] hands.
[42:05] Yeah.
[42:05] And I've been that way since the day I
[42:08] was prognosed and talking to Sister
[42:10] Becky. And God did a change in my life
[42:12] that day. I can pinpoint that day
[42:15] because my soul changed that day. And
[42:20] and that's what it is. I'm I'm stable
[42:23] and saved and healed in my soul because
[42:26] the body is only given to us for so long
[42:28] on this earth anyway.
[42:30] And so I know where I'm going.
[42:32] Yeah.
[42:33] I have no doubt because I am the special
[42:36] one. I'm rare. What I've got's rare.
[42:38] Praise the Lord.
[42:39] And I praise God for it every day.
[42:42] Amen. Amen. Thank you, sister Jack.
[42:49] Amen. Let's stand once again.

[43:06] again, assembling ourselves together,

[43:12] Jesus says you'll come and speak to us.

[43:17] each and every one of us has need of. I
[43:20] don't but you do Lord. And so Father
[43:23] Lord that which I you've impressed upon
[43:25] my heart to speak Lord. We ask God that
[43:29] truly believe Father it's for someone
[43:31] here Lord Jesus. So may we all have an
[43:34] ear to hear what the spirit says to the
[43:36] church tonight Lord. And we ask God that
[43:39] you'd help me Lord to be surrendered
[43:41] Lord so that you could speak Father just
[43:43] what you once said Lord. Keep me from
[43:44] saying one word Lord Jesus out of the
[43:46] way or in myself Lord but let it all be
[43:49] done by the Holy Spirit Father tonight.
[43:52] Lord we thank you for the wonderful
[43:53] testimony to faith to confidence Lord
[43:56] Jesus that you've given our sister
[43:57] Janette Lord Jesus and for the work that
[43:59] you're doing Lord and we're believing
[44:01] for her healing Lord Jesus. We thank
[44:04] you, Father. And each and every one,
[44:06] Lord, Father, in here, God, that has
[44:09] anything that they're not supposed to
[44:10] have and the devil has put it on them.
[44:12] We renounce it in the name of Jesus
[44:14] Christ and believe for our healing,
[44:16] Lord. We ask, God, tonight that you'd
[44:18] help me, Lord Jesus, as I try to
[44:19] minister this thought, Father, that I
[44:21] feel you've laid upon my heart now.
[44:23] Bless it. Bless the reading of the word
[44:25] and each one, those also that are
[44:27] streaming, Father. May they be attentive
[44:30] and may they receive something in their
[44:31] hearts, Lord Jesus. also as all those

[44:35] and was able to come out Lord to your
[44:37] house. May your will be done father in
[44:40] Jesus name. Amen and amen. Praise the
[44:44] Lord. So we are here we are getting
[44:47] close to the middle of July. Told my
[44:49] wife I said I says you know just about
[44:52] almost six more weeks it'll be
[44:53] September. Can you imagine that? That's
[44:56] fast ain't it? you know, middle of July.
[44:59] At least if my math, my Amish math is
[45:02] right, that's about right. Amen. So,
[45:06] praise the Lord. Amen. Already looking
[45:09] forward to fall, aren't we?
[45:12] Not really. Now, I like springs better.
[45:14] I like these long days.
[45:16] Sun go down, gets dark about 9:00, you
[45:19] know, and Amen. So, praise the Lord.
[45:22] Looking forward to a good Saturday.
[45:23] Praying the Lord will hold the rain off
[45:24] and Amen. have good fellowship with
[45:27] everybody that can come. Amen. Turn your
[45:29] Bibles now if you will and we'll go to
[45:31] St. Mark 12 and 28. St. Mark 12 and 28.
[45:35] And I c called this part four of our
[45:37] little series, but it's not really a
[45:38] series. It's continuing on talking about
[45:42] Amen. how uh uh talking about the have
[45:46] loving loving God. Amen. And so this
[45:50] evening in Mark 12, we'll begin with
[45:53] verse
[45:56] 28.
[45:58] It says, "And one of the scribes came,
[46:00] having heard them reasoning together."
[46:02] I'm going to move this down a little
[46:03] bit. Reasoning together, perceiving that
[46:06] he had answered them, "Well, asked him,
[46:09] which is the first commandment of all."
[46:12] Amen. And Jesus answered him, "The first
[46:15] of all the commandments is here, O
[46:18] Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.
[46:21] And thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[46:24] with all thy heart, with all thy soul,
[46:27] and with all thy mind, and with all thy
[46:29] strength. This is the first commandment.
[46:32] And the second is like unto it, namely
[46:34] this. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[46:35] thyself. There is no other commandment
[46:38] greater than these. Amen. May God add
[46:41] his blessings to reading of the word.
[46:43] You can be comfortable.
[46:48] Amen. Amen.
[46:51] Hallelujah. So, amen.
[46:56] Amen. I believe over in I didn't go
[46:58] through here. Don't really want to go
[47:00] down this road too much, but in first
[47:02] John somewhere, it talks about how that
[47:04] if uh you know that the the commandment
[47:07] is that thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[47:08] thyself, and on this hang all the law
[47:11] and the prophets. So, this is the
[47:13] greatest commandment. Can you imagine a
[47:15] world tonight
[47:17] where everybody Well, how many knows
[47:19] first of all
[47:21] um that the Bible says in Ephesians that
[47:24] a man is to love his wife as himself?
[47:28] Is that right? He's supposed to love him
[47:30] his wife as much as he does himself,
[47:35] you know. And truly, if that's the case,
[47:37] how many knows uh you know, we really
[47:40] don't have a problem loving ourselves,
[47:42] do we, brother John?
[47:45] And no, we don't. Most of the time we're
[47:46] pretty selfish. Most of the time we like
[47:49] to make sure we're taken care of. Is
[47:52] that right?
[47:53] And if we would do that for our wife,
[47:55] you know, it' be a, you know, happy
[47:57] wife, happy life.
[48:00] Amen. And here God is telling us now
[48:04] back to my thought. Imagine a world
[48:07] where everybody would love their
[48:09] neighbor as themselves.
[48:18] Isn't that something?
[48:20] If everybody, not just your wife, but
[48:22] it' be that kind of love. Ain't that
[48:24] right? If you would care as much about
[48:27] the next guy as you do yourself,
[48:31] well,
[48:33] you wouldn't hardly need any more
[48:34] commandments.
[48:37] You wouldn't have to have a commandment,
[48:39] thou shalt not kill or hate, right? Or
[48:42] cheat or lie or covet. Instead of
[48:45] coveting, you'd be giving. You know,
[48:48] it'd be a a perfect world.
[48:52] I say that perfect world not lightly.
[48:54] That just comes to mind. But I believe
[48:55] that's the truth because how many knows
[48:58] when you get over there, but Abraham
[48:59] says you nothing but love. Perfect love
[49:01] enters there. And that's all there is
[49:03] there is that perfect love. Amen.
[49:05] There's no animosity. There's none of
[49:07] that anywhere. You won't find any of
[49:09] that anywhere.
[49:12] Amen. So, I don't want to focus on all
[49:16] these, but I want to focus on a few of
[49:17] these. So, if you'll notice the first
[49:20] commandment, the one commandment that's
[49:22] part of that first, he says, "Thou shalt
[49:24] love the Lord thy God with all thy
[49:26] heart."
[49:28] You know, if God's going to God's going
[49:30] to tell you how to love him, he's going
[49:32] to pick the biggest parts, the main
[49:34] parts of you, the most important parts
[49:38] of you. How many knows? The most
[49:40] important part would be your heart.
[49:43] Jesus said one place he says, "Where
[49:45] your treasure is, there will your heart
[49:48] be also."
[49:50] It's not hard to figure out what people
[49:53] love and where their heart is. Isn't
[49:56] that right? It's what they do. It's what
[49:59] they talk about all the time. It's what
[50:01] their mind is on all the time. Their
[50:03] actions speak louder than their words.
[50:09] Amen. So, whoever your treasure is, dare
[50:12] will your heart be also.
[50:14] Amen. And I'm just going to put this in
[50:17] because it comes to my mind. How many
[50:20] knows brother Brandham's treasure was
[50:22] over yonder?
[50:24] remember his the wife is the wife of his
[50:27] youth hope died and Sharon Rose died at
[50:30] a very young age and he promised that he
[50:32] would meet her and brother Bam says I'm
[50:35] on the battlefield and he says keep
[50:37] pressing the battle she had told him to
[50:38] go and press the battle and he said he's
[50:40] looking to finish the battle and go and
[50:42] keep that appointment that he had ain't
[50:44] that right so he had a treasure over
[50:47] there and he always looked for that time
[50:49] live for that time amen
[50:53] so with all of your heart,
[50:56] with all of your soul,
[51:00] with all of your mind,
[51:04] and with all what else is left and with
[51:07] all of your strength.
[51:11] Amen. Sometimes when we get happy and
[51:14] when we get to worshiping the Lord and
[51:16] we want to make a sacrifice to God and
[51:17] we get to dancing and shouting and
[51:20] jumping and everything else, you know, I
[51:22] thought, you know, as we get older, it
[51:24] gets harder to run. It gets harder to
[51:26] jump.
[51:28] You better jump. You better run while
[51:30] you can cuz one of these days it ain't
[51:32] going to be so easy. Oh, could you do a
[51:35] little bit of kick maybe or something?
[51:36] Who knows? Hello.
[51:40] But we might as well worship the Lord
[51:42] while you got strength.
[51:44] Give him praise while you got strength.
[51:46] So God demands your heart. He demands
[51:49] your soul. He demands your mind.
[51:53] He demands your strength. He wants you
[51:56] to love him with everything that you
[51:59] got.
[52:02] Amen.
[52:06] Praise the Lord.
[52:08] After all, how many how many believes
[52:11] that our heart where our heart is, our
[52:14] heart is looking for the Lord to come in
[52:17] the clouds of heaven.
[52:19] One of these mornings,
[52:20] he's going to come in the clouds of
[52:22] heaven.
[52:26] This is truly at where our heart is.
[52:29] That's where our mind is. You got to
[52:32] worship him and love him with all of
[52:34] your mind.
[52:35] And our mind is there looking at what's
[52:38] going on around the way the world is how
[52:41] it's I was just sitting down the other
[52:44] day. I was sitting down just the other
[52:45] day and I was thinking you know of how
[52:48] late how far down the road we really are
[52:50] and how that it doesn't matter how much
[52:53] longer it goes. The real genuine
[52:55] believer should be looking for him to
[52:58] come in the morning.
[53:00] You should be believing that it's just
[53:02] could happen any time.
[53:05] That's how you should live. I don't care
[53:06] if it goes another thousand years.
[53:08] Didn't brother say, you know, you know,
[53:10] I believe he'll come in my generation. I
[53:12] don't believe that I would live out my
[53:14] life, you know, be uh die of an old man
[53:16] before he would come. But if he I don't
[53:17] know, he says, I don't know. He could
[53:19] come another thousand. I don't know.
[53:21] Nobody knows.
[53:22] But he believed that he would come just
[53:24] before even 77.
[53:28] The
[53:29] prophet believe he would be here.
[53:32] I don't I don't know, brother Brad. Some
[53:34] people kind of, you know, ushering in of
[53:37] the millennium. No, I believe he meant
[53:39] that it'd be over with 77.
[53:41] That's the way I read it.
[53:44] What?
[53:45] They wouldn't go past that.
[53:47] And then we went 77, 87, 97, and when it
[53:51] come to 2000, we all popped their eyes
[53:54] open a little. Oh, what's going to
[53:56] happen 2000? This is the year 2000. All
[53:59] kinds of predictions and everything
[54:00] else.
[54:02] How many has heard, you know, great
[54:05] Socrates, not Socrates, but these great
[54:08] men that predict, hey, at a certain time
[54:10] he's going to come and it's going to,
[54:11] you know, and it hasn't happened.
[54:13] That's right.
[54:15] How do you know better? Cuz I'm still
[54:17] here.
[54:19] Cuz
[54:21] you see, it just so happens I believe
[54:24] I'm going to be one of them.
[54:27] I don't I don't question that one bit.
[54:29] Do you question that that you're going
[54:30] to be one of them?
[54:33] God take any shadow of a doubt out of my
[54:36] mind, out of your mind. You're going to
[54:37] be there.
[54:40] Amen.
[54:41] Didn't he say something about you'll go
[54:43] to a preacher's house and you won't be
[54:44] there?
[54:48] Woo. Oh, thank you, Lord. Even got a
[54:50] word for it.
[54:52] Now, if hopefully none of y'all's coming
[54:55] to see me.
[54:59] Hopefully, it'll be somebody else coming
[55:01] to see me cuz I want y'all to meet me in
[55:03] the air.
[55:04] Is that right? Not you get up there and
[55:08] do like that young man in uh down in uh
[55:12] Louisiana that thought the rapture took
[55:14] place, you know, and ended up running up
[55:16] the aisle in his pajamas making sure he
[55:18] don't want to miss the rapture.
[55:22] Amen. Praise the Lord. So that's our
[55:26] heart's desire, isn't it? That's where
[55:27] it should be. Let me How many knows that
[55:30] in order for you to run this race,
[55:32] right?
[55:33] In order for you to uh uh live this life
[55:37] the way that you ought to. Amen. It is
[55:39] like that story of that bicycle that
[55:41] brother Bam talked about. The reason he
[55:43] made it across that plank all the way
[55:45] and all of his no handlebar buddies that
[55:48] rode without hand, they all went off.
[55:50] They asked him, "How did you do it?"
[55:52] Well, I kept focused on the end. I
[55:55] didn't look at all this. I didn't look
[55:57] at my bank account. I didn't look at how
[56:00] much more land I'm going to get or how
[56:02] much richer I'm going to get or my
[56:04] retirement or whatever. I didn't look at
[56:06] the things right here. I was looking at
[56:09] the end. How many believes that? Amen.
[56:11] And that's what you and I are looking
[56:13] at. Amen. At that rapture, at the time
[56:15] when the Lord comes to takes us home.
[56:18] Amen.
[56:20] And we're preparing for that.
[56:22] Amen. And tonight's message is going to
[56:25] be centered around Amen. the mind. So,
[56:28] do we have that title? Amen. I want to
[56:31] talk about the power of the mind. I've
[56:34] preached this many times before, but I
[56:38] trust, you know, I I thought, well, you
[56:40] know, I preached it again, but it must
[56:42] be for somebody. Amen.
[56:45] You know, maybe it's for every one of
[56:46] you. Maybe it's just for a few of you.
[56:49] Maybe it's just for one of you.
[56:52] Amen.
[56:53] How many knows Jesus went many times
[56:55] among sick people, different ones, and
[56:56] they were all sick, a bunch of them, but
[56:58] he didn't heal them all. He came for
[57:00] that one person.
[57:01] Now, personally, I like it whenever it's
[57:03] for everybody. The whole crowd was
[57:06] healed. Everybody got healed. I like
[57:08] those, but it's not always that way.
[57:10] Now, how many knows that not even Jesus
[57:12] knew whether which way it was going to
[57:14] be because he would just follow the
[57:17] leading of the father, the spirit on the
[57:19] father on the inside, whatever he said
[57:21] he would do. And if it was just a man
[57:23] that was not even going to die from the
[57:26] disease. Amen. But he had faith and was
[57:29] led of the father. I do nothing but what
[57:31] my father shows me first. Amen. So, he
[57:34] had to see it of the father before he
[57:36] did anything. So we want to deal a
[57:38] little with the help of the Lord about I
[57:40] want to deal with that mind part the
[57:42] part of the mind.
[57:44] Amen.
[57:46] Amen.
[57:48] Now the one statement that brother Bram
[57:50] said about the mind he says the mind is
[57:52] the womb to the soul.
[57:55] Is that right? The mind is the womb to
[57:57] the soul. So it's something that t takes
[58:00] something in. Your mind takes it all in,
[58:03] don't it? It takes it in.
[58:06] And it's like feeding.
[58:09] It's like eating.
[58:11] Amen. And I just before I come out, I
[58:13] thought, you know, how do you even how
[58:15] do you even digest things in your mind?
[58:19] Well, first of all, you have to hear it.
[58:21] And faith comes by hearing. How many
[58:24] believe faith comes by hearing?
[58:26] And Jesus said,
[58:29] he said, "In them is fulfilled the
[58:31] prophecy of Isaiah, which says, "By
[58:33] hearing ye shall hear and shall not
[58:36] understand. In seeing you shall see and
[58:38] shall not perceive.
[58:40] For this people's heart is waxed gross.
[58:43] Their ears are dull hearing. Their eyes
[58:45] have they closed least at any time I
[58:47] should uh they should see with their
[58:49] eyes and hear with their ears and should
[58:52] understand with their heart." Amen.
[58:56] Amen. And should be converted, and I
[58:57] should heal them. But blessed are your
[58:59] eyes, for they see, and blessed are your
[59:03] ears, for they hear.
[59:08] I want you to know, we could have a
[59:09] whole Jericho march on that one right
[59:12] there.
[59:14] That's right. Because why? You could be
[59:17] anywhere in this world, folks. You could
[59:20] be into anything out there.
[59:22] Yes. But God has opened your ears.
[59:26] He has given you an ear to be able to
[59:29] hear.
[59:32] He has given you eyes to be able to
[59:35] understand. What an honor. What a That's
[59:38] why he said, "Blessed are you.
[59:41] He that has an ear to hear, let him hear
[59:44] what the spirit saith unto the
[59:46] churches."
[59:48] Is it okay if it comes to my mind that
[59:50] he was actually not talking to the ones
[59:52] that don't aren't able to hear?
[59:56] He didn't say to those who don't have an
[59:58] ear, listen.
[1:00:00] No, he said to those who have an ear to
[1:00:03] hear.
[1:00:05] You're not going to hear it unless
[1:00:07] you've been given an ability to be able
[1:00:10] to hear.
[1:00:11] And that's grace. That's God's sovereign
[1:00:14] grace to you.
[1:00:17] Amen. And I'm happy for that.
[1:00:21] Lord,
[1:00:22] he may have to put us in a hospital. He
[1:00:24] may have to put you in jail. He may have
[1:00:26] to put you this, that, and the other.
[1:00:28] But he's going to get you to the place
[1:00:30] to where you're listening because he
[1:00:32] knows you got a ear to hear
[1:00:35] and he'll catch your attention. Praise
[1:00:37] be to God. I don't care what God's got
[1:00:39] to do. Just get my, you know, get my
[1:00:42] attention.
[1:00:44] Help me to be able to hear what the
[1:00:46] spirit saith.
[1:00:51] Amen.
[1:00:54] We hear it said that the music that's
[1:00:58] played before church, you know, it's
[1:01:00] like going to war. Ain't that right?
[1:01:03] Like they play trumpets and man, they go
[1:01:06] in and they march and march and march
[1:01:07] and march before battle. And then when
[1:01:10] the preacher comes, when he open the
[1:01:11] word, when you begin to speak, how many
[1:01:15] know that's the battle? That's where the
[1:01:18] battle is because every word that comes
[1:01:21] out of my mouth, every word that's both
[1:01:23] going is coming into yours, you're
[1:01:25] hearing it, and then you're having to
[1:01:27] make a decision on what to do with it.
[1:01:30] It's a battle. It's the battleground.
[1:01:33] Before we get into that in the decor of
[1:01:35] it, I want to
[1:01:40] first of all say that the mind is where
[1:01:45] we receive things. That's where we it
[1:01:47] first comes into here. It's the womb
[1:01:50] to the soul.
[1:01:53] So, let's talk about eating for a
[1:01:56] minute. I was reading my Bible. I don't
[1:02:00] know when it was but there was somewhere
[1:02:03] in the old testament I come across
[1:02:05] something that I had seen in the new
[1:02:07] testament so when I begin to think about
[1:02:09] this
[1:02:12] thinking about the mind feeding the mind
[1:02:15] feeding what how many know is listening
[1:02:18] to the word your mind is always feeding
[1:02:22] you're always thinking thoughts amen
[1:02:25] thoughts or bad thoughts whatever it
[1:02:27] might be But so to my tonight tonight I
[1:02:31] want to I want to emphasize on our minds
[1:02:33] and the importance of our mind the power
[1:02:36] that is in the mind and what it does.
[1:02:39] Amen.
[1:02:41] But in Ezekiel
[1:02:43] 1 and we'll begin with no chapter 2
[1:02:47] verse 7. Now,
[1:02:50] God had actually talked to Ezekiel and
[1:02:53] he was going to talk to his people
[1:02:55] because they were backsliden and
[1:02:56] hard-headed and all these things. But he
[1:02:59] says, "And thou shalt speak my words
[1:03:00] unto them whether they will hear or
[1:03:03] whether they will forebear, for they
[1:03:05] must they are a most rebellious. But
[1:03:08] thou son of man, hear what I say unto
[1:03:11] thee.
[1:03:12] Be not thou rebellious like the
[1:03:14] rebellious house. Open thy mouth and eat
[1:03:18] that I give thee.
[1:03:21] And when I looked, behold, an hand was
[1:03:24] set upon me, and lo, a roll of a book
[1:03:27] was therein. Amen.
[1:03:31] And he spread it before me, and it was
[1:03:34] written within and without, and there
[1:03:37] was written therein lamentations and
[1:03:40] mourning, and woe. Moreover, chapter
[1:03:43] three. Moreover, he said unto me, son of
[1:03:45] man,
[1:03:47] eat that thou findest, eat this roll. In
[1:03:52] other words, eat this scroll, this word,
[1:03:54] right? Eat this word, and go speak unto
[1:04:00] the house of Israel. So I open my mouth,
[1:04:03] and he caused me to eat that robe.
[1:04:07] Amen.
[1:04:08] And he said unto me, son of man, cause
[1:04:11] thy belly to eat it, and fill thy bowels
[1:04:14] with this roll that I give thee. Then I
[1:04:18] then did I eat it, and it was in my
[1:04:21] mouth as honey for sweetness. Now the
[1:04:25] only difference between this and
[1:04:26] revelations is that in Revelations when
[1:04:29] it talks about it talks about in my
[1:04:31] belly, in my mouth it was sweet, but in
[1:04:34] my belly it was bitter.
[1:04:37] Now remember revelations 10:7. How many
[1:04:39] knows? Mighty angel comes and opens up
[1:04:41] the book and the thunders are their
[1:04:43] voices and everything. The seven seals
[1:04:45] become open. Are you with me?
[1:04:47] They come open. All right. And then in
[1:04:50] verse seven, it says, "But in the days
[1:04:52] of the voice of the seventh angel, when
[1:04:53] he shall begin to sound, the mystery of
[1:04:55] God should be finished as he has
[1:04:56] declared to his servants the prophets.
[1:04:58] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:05:00] spake unto me again." Now, now John was
[1:05:03] a type of the church, the bride, okay?
[1:05:05] and said, "Go, take the little book
[1:05:08] which is open in the hand of the angel,
[1:05:11] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:05:13] earth." And I went unto the angel, and
[1:05:16] said unto him, "Give me that little
[1:05:18] book." And he said unto me, "Take it,
[1:05:22] and eat it up, and it shall be it shall
[1:05:26] make thy betty belly bitter, but it
[1:05:28] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey."
[1:05:32] Amen. And I took the little book out of
[1:05:35] the angel's hand and ate it up. Amen.
[1:05:39] How many knows? What do we come to
[1:05:41] church for?
[1:05:42] What are we doing? Feeding the sheep.
[1:05:45] How many is eating tonight?
[1:05:47] That's right. We're all feeding. We're
[1:05:49] eating on the word of God.
[1:05:52] Eat it up.
[1:05:55] Amen.
[1:05:57] I like I like what he said. I went to
[1:05:59] the angel and I said unto him, "Give me
[1:06:01] the little book."
[1:06:04] How many would say, "Give me another
[1:06:05] book. Give me another tape. Let me have
[1:06:08] some more of that."
[1:06:10] Amen. I believe we'd be better off if we
[1:06:12] did more of that. Give me some more. I
[1:06:14] love that. I love Amen. Uh God's statue
[1:06:17] of a perfect man. Amen. I love all of
[1:06:20] these. The seals, the church ages.
[1:06:22] Amen. Give me that. Let me eat it up.
[1:06:28] Let me eat some of that.
[1:06:32] Sweet.
[1:06:33] Amen. All right. I ate it up.
[1:06:37] And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly
[1:06:41] was bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou
[1:06:43] must prophesy again before many peoples,
[1:06:45] nations, tongues, and kings." Isn't that
[1:06:48] exactly the truth? How many knows that
[1:06:50] as you you can talk to brother Biscll?
[1:06:53] heard him say it and and different ones,
[1:06:55] brother uh just different ones that at
[1:06:57] the time of brother Brandham when he was
[1:06:59] gone in 1965, there was not that much of
[1:07:02] distribution.
[1:07:04] But Africa exploded. The world exploded
[1:07:06] needing books and and revival and things
[1:07:09] things just went out. So this this
[1:07:11] message still needed to go to kings and
[1:07:13] nations. It still needs to go and it's
[1:07:15] going.
[1:07:17] Amen. So what are we eating? How many
[1:07:19] believes that it's important what we
[1:07:21] feed on? It's important what our minds
[1:07:24] feed on.
[1:07:26] Very very important
[1:07:28] and and uh
[1:07:36] because
[1:07:38] what we're going to do here in a minute
[1:07:39] hopefully we'll go back all the way back
[1:07:42] to Satan and his ambition. Isn't that
[1:07:45] right? and all the way back to heaven.
[1:07:49] And the angels, those angels that sided
[1:07:53] with the devil, ain't that right? The
[1:07:56] first thing that happened is they heard
[1:07:57] something
[1:07:59] and they believed it. Ain't that right?
[1:08:02] It went down into their hearts.
[1:08:04] They ate it. Hello. But the first thing
[1:08:07] that happened was it went from their
[1:08:09] ears to their mind.
[1:08:11] Their ears to the mind.
[1:08:14] And the same thing that happened with
[1:08:15] Eve. Is that right? God had told her a
[1:08:18] certain thing. The devil came and he
[1:08:20] told her and she heard something. She
[1:08:22] listened to it. Is that right? And she
[1:08:25] heard it and took it in her mind first.
[1:08:28] Amen. And as a result, Amen. The fall
[1:08:31] happened. And we'll get into that here
[1:08:32] in a minute. Let me lay a little
[1:08:34] foundation first.
[1:08:37] Believe this isn't spoken word. His
[1:08:39] original seed. I'm thinking out into the
[1:08:42] land where this message is going. From
[1:08:44] the east coast to the west, from
[1:08:46] California to New York, down into the
[1:08:48] south, up into the north, out into the
[1:08:51] missions, wherever it's going, and in
[1:08:54] this tabernacle.
[1:08:56] Now, I want you to know that this is
[1:08:58] sure.
[1:09:00] And you that listen to this tape or you
[1:09:04] preacher that preaches this, huh? You
[1:09:07] might have thought today. No, that
[1:09:09] wasn't wasn't the spoken word. The
[1:09:11] original seed. My my silly printer. He
[1:09:13] don't print I hit the wrong button. It
[1:09:15] don't print the title of which message,
[1:09:17] but I remember anointed ones in the end
[1:09:19] time is what I'm thinking it was. But
[1:09:21] listen, so he says, listen, you might
[1:09:24] have thought today I was trying to say
[1:09:25] that about myself being that I was
[1:09:28] packing the message.
[1:09:32] Huh? You think this message is brother
[1:09:34] Bam's message? You think we're following
[1:09:37] a man?
[1:09:38] No.
[1:09:40] About myself. I have no more to do with
[1:09:43] it than nothing.
[1:09:47] My
[1:09:49] no more than just a voice. It's just my
[1:09:53] voice.
[1:09:56] One time, this has come to me. His wife
[1:09:58] says, you know, they don't repent. They
[1:10:00] don't change. It doesn't do any good. It
[1:10:02] seems like why do you even preach it?
[1:10:04] But the man says, "Because there has to
[1:10:06] be a voice against it.
[1:10:09] There has to be something said against
[1:10:11] it.
[1:10:13] You can't just keep quiet."
[1:10:15] That's right.
[1:10:16] Has to be a voice. And my voice even
[1:10:19] against my better judgment. I want it to
[1:10:21] be a trapper. But it's the will of the
[1:10:25] father that I declare unto you.
[1:10:29] How many's glad to hear that? I'm glad
[1:10:32] that you're not just listening to what
[1:10:34] some man's idea was, but you're
[1:10:36] listening to the will of the father. The
[1:10:39] very god of heaven is the one that
[1:10:41] brought this message.
[1:10:45] The very one that created the stars and
[1:10:47] moon.
[1:10:48] It's his will. These messages, how many
[1:10:50] believes is God's will?
[1:10:52] You want to know what the god of will of
[1:10:53] God is? Here it is. How blessed a people
[1:10:56] we are.
[1:10:58] Amen. And I am determined to do. He
[1:11:01] said, "I wasn't the one that appeared
[1:11:03] down there on the river. I was only
[1:11:05] standing there when he appeared."
[1:11:09] Amen. We think a lot of Brother Benham.
[1:11:11] He was a real man of God. But he pointed
[1:11:13] us to Jesus.
[1:11:15] It was about God. It was about Christ.
[1:11:18] It's about the Holy Ghost tonight.
[1:11:20] That's what it's about. That's the one
[1:11:22] he wanted to lead us to. That's why in
[1:11:24] the picture, he has a picture of his
[1:11:26] finger showing pointing you to Christ.
[1:11:28] Any true servant will point you to
[1:11:31] Christ, not himself.
[1:11:34] Amen.
[1:11:37] Not yourself.
[1:11:39] Amen. When a man is always just pointing
[1:11:41] you to I I I I. The more a man says I,
[1:11:45] the sicker I get to my stomach.
[1:11:48] It's not about you.
[1:11:50] It's about God and what he is.
[1:11:53] Amen. All right. Now I know. So he says
[1:11:56] that's right. Appeared
[1:11:58] He says he's the one that performs these
[1:12:01] things and foretells these things that
[1:12:03] happens as perfect as they are. I'm only
[1:12:07] the near when he does it. How many
[1:12:10] believe that? He would come to the
[1:12:12] platform. He would use his eyes. He
[1:12:14] would show him the visions. He would
[1:12:16] forthtell things. That's not done by a
[1:12:19] man.
[1:12:21] That's done by God through a man.
[1:12:24] Amen. I was only a voice that he used to
[1:12:28] say it. It wasn't what I knew. It's what
[1:12:31] I just surrendered myself to. And he
[1:12:34] spoke through me. It isn't me. It wasn't
[1:12:37] the seventh angel. No, it was the
[1:12:39] manifestation
[1:12:41] of the son of man. How many believe
[1:12:43] that's what this dispensation was? As it
[1:12:46] was in the days of the Lot, so shall it
[1:12:48] be in the days of the son of man.
[1:12:52] On down. Now, let me just go a little
[1:12:54] bit further. He says, he says, "The
[1:12:56] angel was not the son of man. He was the
[1:12:59] messenger from the son of man. The son
[1:13:01] of man is Christ and he's the one that
[1:13:05] you are feeding on."
[1:13:09] You're not feeding on a man. A man's
[1:13:13] word, they'll fail. But you're feeding
[1:13:14] on the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:13:19] man.
[1:13:21] How many knows that you become what you
[1:13:23] eat?
[1:13:25] You are what you eat.
[1:13:27] And I want you to know, we've got the
[1:13:29] kind of vitamins, we've got the kind of
[1:13:31] food.
[1:13:35] Amen. That'll help us lose weight.
[1:13:40] That's right. I'm here to tell you,
[1:13:42] it'll lay aside every weight and the sin
[1:13:44] that does so easily be said to you.
[1:13:47] And it'll help you to run this race with
[1:13:50] patience. This race that's set before
[1:13:52] us.
[1:13:53] I like that kind of a diet. This kind of
[1:13:55] a diet gives you supernatural power. I'm
[1:13:59] here to tell you, you ain't even got to
[1:14:01] go to gym to get a little stronger. All
[1:14:04] you got to do is eat these vitamins.
[1:14:08] Amen. People go to Walmart and they'll
[1:14:10] get these big bottles of whey.
[1:14:13] Ain't that right? These big bottles of
[1:14:15] whey. They want protein. Oh, them
[1:14:18] muscles. Amen. What we need is a little
[1:14:20] why. We need to eat on a little. Why?
[1:14:23] Why? Why? Why are the people Amen. But
[1:14:26] he says, "Why do you go to the God of
[1:14:28] Echron?" Amen. Is there no bomb in
[1:14:31] Gillig? Is there no physician there?
[1:14:33] Then why are the daughter of my people
[1:14:36] not healed? But the Bible says God had
[1:14:39] pro made a complete provision. He has
[1:14:41] completely provided. Amen. Us everything
[1:14:43] that we have need of.
[1:14:47] Evening night tabernacle. Everybody
[1:14:48] hearing my voice, you ain't got no
[1:14:50] excuse. Not even one little excuse for
[1:14:53] not to be supernatural, superpowered.
[1:14:57] We ain't got no excuse.
[1:14:59] [Applause]
[1:15:00] It ain't God's fault. It ain't brother
[1:15:02] Bam's fault. It's your fault
[1:15:05] cuz you don't feed on it the way that
[1:15:07] you you don't think on it like you ought
[1:15:09] to.
[1:15:10] Cuz there's invincibility in this food.
[1:15:13] Oh my. There's omnipotence in this food.
[1:15:17] He says, "Man that's completely
[1:15:19] surrendered to God is omnipotent."
[1:15:27] We look at Hercules and go,
[1:15:30] "Hercules,
[1:15:32] that skinny little scrawy little thing,
[1:15:35] he ain't nothing compared to God's
[1:15:38] people.
[1:15:39] You ain't seen nothing." That's right.
[1:15:42] You look at old Goliath and say, "Wow,
[1:15:44] look at them big old muscles. Five times
[1:15:46] the size of David.
[1:15:49] I don't see him. He's big." You say,
[1:15:50] "You little shrimp, you better get out
[1:15:52] of the way cuz this man down here, he's
[1:15:55] twice your size." Why? Because he got
[1:15:58] God on his side and you're fixing to go
[1:16:00] down. And that's the way it is with
[1:16:02] every disease, every sickness in here.
[1:16:04] I'm here to tell you the devil, he's
[1:16:06] fixing to go down cuz God's people are
[1:16:09] stronger than any devil. There ain't
[1:16:12] enough devils in hell to ever topple
[1:16:14] you. Not enough devils in hell come out
[1:16:16] of there in streams of demons.
[1:16:25] I'm going to tell you. I might as well
[1:16:26] tell you again.
[1:16:29] Julie ain't heard it. There's nobody
[1:16:31] that I folks, I'm here to tell you. I've
[1:16:34] been at the place. I've been there
[1:16:39] to where I felt like there was so many
[1:16:41] demons, so much pressure. So much
[1:16:44] pressure. They're all over me. All over
[1:16:48] me, piling on me, just beating on me.
[1:16:52] But guess what? Somebody was praying and
[1:16:55] there was something down on the inside
[1:16:57] of the inside and they said, "Get up.
[1:17:00] Get out of here. Shake them all off. Get
[1:17:03] off me, devils. Knock them out.
[1:17:06] I ain't going down cuz God's on my side.
[1:17:15] God's on your side.
[1:17:17] God's on our side.
[1:17:20] That's right.
[1:17:22] been there. I know what it's like.
[1:17:28] If he can't get you down with two
[1:17:30] devils, he'll get three. He'll get four.
[1:17:34] He'll get five. He'll get six. He'll get
[1:17:38] a hundred.
[1:17:43] That man that's down there, he's a son
[1:17:46] of God.
[1:17:47] Makes a difference. Now
[1:17:49] he's down there. He's down and he's
[1:17:53] saying, "God, your prophet said, there's
[1:17:56] not enough devils in hell to ever make
[1:18:00] him count again. Get off of me."
[1:18:02] Hello. There's not enough of you. Look
[1:18:05] around. There ain't enough of you.
[1:18:08] You got anymore.
[1:18:15] Ain't that what David said?
[1:18:19] Chopped. chopped that giant head off.
[1:18:23] I probably had to take both hands in his
[1:18:25] air. Hope he didn't have any light to
[1:18:27] grab him up here.
[1:18:32] Hey,
[1:18:34] y'all want some more?
[1:18:40] Why do you think when my wife whenever
[1:18:42] somebody gets healed of cancer, Amen,
[1:18:44] when one kills a devil, Amen, it gives
[1:18:47] us the rest? The rest of Israel said,
[1:18:49] "We can do it, too." Amen. Let's go. And
[1:18:52] we're going to drive the enemy all the
[1:18:54] way out the land.
[1:19:11] Amen. We'll find it later.
[1:19:15] Somebody bring it to me, will you? Come
[1:19:17] on, Michael. Bring it to me. There you
[1:19:19] go. Don't just look at it.
[1:19:30] All right.
[1:19:32] See, and I won't be so bad listening at
[1:19:34] me.
[1:19:40] Amen.
[1:19:42] How many believes that we truly
[1:19:46] we have truly been given spiritual food
[1:19:52] in due season.
[1:19:55] It was due.
[1:19:57] It was overdue.
[1:20:00] Malachi 4 was due. The world was in all
[1:20:03] kinds of churchity and doctrines and
[1:20:06] everything else messed up. But he
[1:20:08] brought us spiritual food just in time.
[1:20:12] How many believe that God shows up just
[1:20:14] in time?
[1:20:16] Right when we didn't know which way to
[1:20:18] go. Right when I was in Pinecraft, Amen.
[1:20:20] and wondering which is right, what's
[1:20:22] right, which way do I go, who do I
[1:20:24] listen to? He had a couple brothers
[1:20:26] there that knew the message of the hour.
[1:20:29] Hello. He had a provision made
[1:20:33] in due season, spiritual food. How many
[1:20:36] believe that's what this message is?
[1:20:38] Spiritual food for you to feed on.
[1:20:44] Amen.
[1:20:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:51] Amen. You're feeding on the unfailing
[1:20:55] body word of the son of man. And if you
[1:20:58] haven't fed fully on the word of God to
[1:21:03] give yourself strength to fly above all
[1:21:06] these nations and things of the world,
[1:21:09] amen, will you do it at this time? Amen.
[1:21:12] We could rephrase that a little bit. If
[1:21:14] you haven't fed on the word of God to
[1:21:16] give you victory,
[1:21:19] to give you a little joy, maybe it's
[1:21:21] time that you do.
[1:21:23] Maybe it's time that we get this
[1:21:24] medicine that God has provided for us.
[1:21:30] and eat and take this medicine. Not be
[1:21:32] like brother Benham said. Amen. He's
[1:21:34] trying to those churches and he was
[1:21:36] trying to put their medicine in their
[1:21:37] mouth.
[1:21:41] This just comes. He tried to convince
[1:21:44] him that it's the truth. He said, "Now
[1:21:46] you know I can't do this. Now you know
[1:21:49] if he don't come, I can't do anything.
[1:21:51] But if he will come and do exactly like
[1:21:54] he did, you'll know what that it's him.
[1:21:57] Like when they broke bread and brother
[1:21:59] Brandon would say all those things all
[1:22:01] the time to make them realize, isn't
[1:22:02] that me? This is him doing the same
[1:22:05] thing.
[1:22:08] Amen. Tried and they still just wouldn't
[1:22:11] believe it. They just thought Brother
[1:22:13] Bam was another good preacher. He's
[1:22:15] another Billy Graham, another Oral
[1:22:17] Roberts, another good enemy with a gift.
[1:22:21] No, he was more than that.
[1:22:24] He was a mighty prophet of God.
[1:22:27] He was God's very prophet to this last
[1:22:29] age with thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:22:33] It wasn't his word. It was God's word.
[1:22:37] It's not his message. It's God's
[1:22:39] message.
[1:22:43] Amen.
[1:22:46] Brother Abraham says it's spoken word
[1:22:48] spiritual seed. All right. Now there has
[1:22:50] been three different kinds of seeds
[1:22:52] planted. He says I believe that the that
[1:22:55] we are near the harvest time. The seeds
[1:22:58] have been planted. Denominational seeds
[1:23:00] of the churches such as evangelical, the
[1:23:04] Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, and the
[1:23:08] Pentecostal seeds have been planted into
[1:23:10] the Pentecostal organizations. And great
[1:23:13] men like Oral Roberts, Tommy Hicks,
[1:23:17] Tommy Osborne, great men of God. See,
[1:23:19] and I believe, listen, and I believe
[1:23:22] that the word of God has been planted,
[1:23:25] unadulterated away from any of those
[1:23:28] organizations.
[1:23:29] How many believe we got the
[1:23:30] unadulterated,
[1:23:32] pure word of God? And a pure word will
[1:23:37] bring forth exactly like it did at
[1:23:39] first.
[1:23:40] If an archery, it's it's oh my make it
[1:23:44] quick.
[1:23:46] Amen. you. It's amazing how you can take
[1:23:48] a orange a lemon branch and graft it
[1:23:52] into a orange tree
[1:23:55] and and and and a tangerine and all
[1:23:57] these other ones. And brother Bam said
[1:23:58] to that man that did that, he says,
[1:24:00] "Now, next year they'll all be oranges."
[1:24:02] He says, "No, no, no, no, no, no."
[1:24:05] Huh? Isn't it amazing? No. They'll still
[1:24:08] be a peaches or whatever. Not peaches,
[1:24:10] but citrus. It'll still be a lemon.
[1:24:12] It'll still be this, that, or the other.
[1:24:15] Hello.
[1:24:16] And that's the way they they feed on
[1:24:18] that same citrus, but they still are
[1:24:20] what they are. But if it ever puts forth
[1:24:22] another original branch,
[1:24:25] how many I know, brother Brad, that we
[1:24:27] believe that we are part of that
[1:24:29] original branch. We are another branch
[1:24:31] that God's putting out. We're part of
[1:24:33] that last seed that has been sown. And
[1:24:36] God said, I have sown. My word will not
[1:24:39] come back to me, void. I will water it.
[1:24:41] I will tend to it. God will tend to you.
[1:24:44] Amen.
[1:24:45] He'll make sure that you make it.
[1:24:56] Aren't you glad for that?
[1:25:01] I hope this ain't a wrong statement,
[1:25:03] Brother Brad. Normally, you shouldn't
[1:25:05] make a statement you're not sure of.
[1:25:13] If you're one of his,
[1:25:17] you couldn't miss it if you tried.
[1:25:22] You couldn't miss it if you tried. Cuz
[1:25:25] you're not going to make void all that
[1:25:27] come to me. And no man can pluck them
[1:25:30] out of my hands.
[1:25:31] You won't pluck yourself out of his
[1:25:33] hands.
[1:25:34] He's going to lose none of them. Not a
[1:25:36] one that comes to him. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:41] To justify my statement, I bring to your
[1:25:44] mind and thoughts
[1:25:47] that brother Bram says, "If a son
[1:25:49] becomes rebellious
[1:25:51] as the one man did and preacher did and
[1:25:54] quit preaching, went out and got drunk,
[1:25:57] quit serving the Lord, couple days
[1:26:00] later, he died, but says God just took
[1:26:03] him home because he wouldn't be
[1:26:04] corrected."
[1:26:05] Hello.
[1:26:07] If you won't be corrected, God will take
[1:26:09] you home, but he won't lose you.
[1:26:12] Hello. That's right. God will lose in
[1:26:15] none of his. You love them for that.
[1:26:18] Praise be to God.
[1:26:21] Oh, I love this. I love this.
[1:26:24] It's sweet in my mouth.
[1:26:27] Amen.
[1:26:28] Praise the Lord. And I believe the word
[1:26:31] of God has been planted unadulterated
[1:26:33] away from any of those in organizations.
[1:26:36] See, the seed plant must have seed water
[1:26:39] before it can grow. It must have water
[1:26:42] to fall before the seed that's been
[1:26:44] planted can grow. Now, I'm going to
[1:26:47] finish the other quote that he said. He
[1:26:50] had three quotes, and I'm didn't link
[1:26:52] the middle one, but these are the two I
[1:26:54] wanted to get to, but he says about the
[1:26:56] same thing, but he says it again.
[1:26:59] So he says now he says all right now
[1:27:03] there has been three different kinds of
[1:27:04] seeds planted denominational Billy
[1:27:07] Graham he was the head planter or
[1:27:09] Roberts for the Pentecostals
[1:27:11] Pentecostal seeds been planted
[1:27:14] I'm talking about organization now and
[1:27:16] then the word has been planted
[1:27:22] how many knows that word where does it
[1:27:24] get planted at? Well, first it's spoken,
[1:27:28] but then it has to come into ground.
[1:27:31] Brother Bam says, you know, the word of
[1:27:32] God, but the Bible says Jesus said the
[1:27:34] word of God is a seed that a seeder
[1:27:37] sowed. And you, if you're ever going to
[1:27:40] see the manifestation, the power of God,
[1:27:42] you have to plant that word in your
[1:27:45] heart.
[1:27:46] Amen. You've got to plant it down in
[1:27:48] there.
[1:27:50] And you have to profess and confess that
[1:27:53] word. Sometimes our body wants to say
[1:27:55] no, I don't feel any better.
[1:27:59] Huh?
[1:28:01] Didn't even brother Bam says, "As long
[1:28:02] as you say, I'm not saved. I'm not a
[1:28:04] pretty good Christian." Then you're not
[1:28:05] going to be.
[1:28:07] I'm not worthy. You're never going to
[1:28:08] be.
[1:28:10] You got to say, "I believe I'm saved.
[1:28:12] I'm one of them. I'm one of God's
[1:28:13] people. I'm filled with the Holy Ghost."
[1:28:15] Amen. And your body will have to come
[1:28:18] subject to it.
[1:28:19] God will bring your body subject to it.
[1:28:22] Amen. And you got to plant it down
[1:28:24] there.
[1:28:27] Amen.
[1:28:30] Hallelujah.
[1:28:31] And the word has been planted. Amen.
[1:28:36] See, understand folks, I ain't saying
[1:28:38] this no more unless God tells me. Amen.
[1:28:41] And I want you to get it. Good and
[1:28:44] clear. Three seeds have been planted.
[1:28:50] That's the reason the planting's just
[1:28:52] about over. Amen. And others were trying
[1:28:55] to say that the rain has fallen already.
[1:28:57] Brother Brandham said there's going to
[1:28:59] be a ladder rain. There's going to be a
[1:29:01] rain that comes and falls on this seed.
[1:29:03] How many believes that there is going to
[1:29:06] be a spirit that comes and quickens the
[1:29:10] rapture that you believe everything that
[1:29:12] you put in your heart that that spirit
[1:29:14] will come and water that seed
[1:29:17] and bring it to harvest.
[1:29:19] Praise be to God. So, we're looking for
[1:29:21] that. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:25] Amen. Now, that's just my foundation. We
[1:29:29] got 10 more minutes.
[1:29:34] Like I said earlier,
[1:29:40] it happened in heaven first.
[1:29:43] The devil got into the minds of angels.
[1:29:48] He got in their minds.
[1:29:51] Your mind is a very unique thing.
[1:29:55] Amen.
[1:29:57] Let this mind, Paul said, be in you
[1:30:00] that was also in Christ Jesus.
[1:30:06] Amen. How many believes that?
[1:30:13] Amen. That was also in Christ Jesus.
[1:30:22] Yeah. Right. Philippians 2 and 5. Then
[1:30:24] he also said that we have we have the
[1:30:27] mind of Christ,
[1:30:30] the mind of God.
[1:30:32] Now I don't know about you, but
[1:30:33] sometimes the way that my mind goes and
[1:30:36] as impatient as I get sometime, I'm
[1:30:39] like, Lord, help me.
[1:30:41] Lord, help me. Let me have and think the
[1:30:45] way God thinks.
[1:30:46] How many believe that?
[1:30:48] Amen. And I have one more quote out of
[1:30:49] the church age book I wanted to read
[1:30:51] about that mind about our mind and about
[1:30:54] this word before I actually go on. This
[1:30:57] will tie in. And I like this and pick up
[1:31:00] your pen and write.
[1:31:02] But he wrote that letter. He says he
[1:31:04] talks about the first son Adam. He says
[1:31:07] he was the spoken word seed of God. He
[1:31:09] was given a bride to reproduce himself.
[1:31:12] He says and that bride uh fell by
[1:31:15] hybridization. Didn't she? The second
[1:31:18] Adam, the second Adam, Jesus also was a
[1:31:22] spoken word seed of God, given a bride
[1:31:24] like as Adam was, but before he could
[1:31:26] marry her, she had also fallen.
[1:31:30] Amen. How many know just before he could
[1:31:32] marry her, cuz the book of Acts was just
[1:31:35] the way it was supposed to be.
[1:31:38] And if you'll notice, the first church
[1:31:39] age don't start till 50 years after the
[1:31:42] death of Christ. 50 years
[1:31:44] is when she fell and went into the
[1:31:46] church ages.
[1:31:48] But listen to this.
[1:31:51] She fell and look how many knows down
[1:31:53] through the dark ages she went into
[1:31:54] complete apostasy.
[1:31:56] Complete darkness. It was very very dark
[1:31:58] and reformation came through Lucer and
[1:32:01] so forth.
[1:32:03] And I, oh my,
[1:32:07] when I think about brother Brandham
[1:32:09] saying that this little group, this
[1:32:11] bride is going to have to be in her ve
[1:32:13] his very image in order to be united
[1:32:15] with her. Right? Remember that? He says
[1:32:18] she's got to be in his very image in
[1:32:20] order to be united with her.
[1:32:23] And brother Bam talked about the
[1:32:24] ministry. The ministry of the bride is
[1:32:27] going to have to be so much like him
[1:32:28] until it's just like him. And I thought,
[1:32:31] well, maybe maybe I missed something
[1:32:32] here. Maybe I missed something here.
[1:32:34] Because the ministry that God did
[1:32:37] through Brother Brandon was so close
[1:32:39] like Jesus until people wanted to say,
[1:32:42] "Are you the Messiah? Are you Jesus?"
[1:32:45] How many knows it was just like it?
[1:32:48] That's right. And how many knows you and
[1:32:51] I are part of that ministry?
[1:32:53] That was so much like him. He brought
[1:32:55] the word. Amen. And if we eat that word
[1:32:57] and we become that word, hello, we're
[1:32:59] going to come into his image.
[1:33:08] That's right. So, we have growing to do.
[1:33:11] How many got growing to do?
[1:33:13] I do.
[1:33:15] Now, notice and here's a promise. Here's
[1:33:18] a promise talking about we're not
[1:33:21] feeding on some man. were feeding on the
[1:33:23] absolute unadulterated son of God.
[1:33:27] Listen, he says, "She doubted it. She
[1:33:29] left the word. She died. And from a
[1:33:31] little group of true seed of God, of the
[1:33:35] true seed of God, God will present
[1:33:37] Christ with a beloved bride. She is a
[1:33:40] virgin to his ver word. She is a virgin
[1:33:43] because she knows no man-made creeds or
[1:33:47] dogmas." Amen. I mean, no. That's why we
[1:33:51] are so strict here to say what he said.
[1:33:54] Stay with the word. Don't inject your
[1:33:56] own ideas. We don't need any of that.
[1:33:59] We've got the pure. Amen. You just can't
[1:34:01] digest it. We want dust, saith the Lord,
[1:34:04] and we keep still.
[1:34:07] Amen.
[1:34:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:11] And listen to what he says. by and
[1:34:14] through the members of the bride will be
[1:34:16] fulfilled all that was promised of God
[1:34:19] to be made manifest in the virgin. So we
[1:34:22] want to say that in and through you and
[1:34:24] I is going to be made manifest
[1:34:27] everything that he has promised in this
[1:34:30] hour
[1:34:32] that he's going to have a church without
[1:34:33] spot
[1:34:34] without wrinkle.
[1:34:36] How many believes tonight that you are
[1:34:38] called to a much higher calling than the
[1:34:41] Pentecostals? The Baptists are Luther
[1:34:43] with a pipe. No, we're way higher than
[1:34:46] that. Called to a higher calling than
[1:34:48] that. Amish Menonite, way above that.
[1:34:52] Past Pentecost. That's right. Cuz we are
[1:34:56] going to meet the Lord in the air.
[1:34:59] Amen.
[1:35:02] So,
[1:35:04] let's talk about what the mind really is
[1:35:06] all about.
[1:35:08] We know brother Bram says in the
[1:35:10] greatest battle ever fought. Amen. This
[1:35:13] is where it seems a little bit
[1:35:14] reputious.
[1:35:16] Ever fought begin in heaven with Michael
[1:35:18] and his angels fought against Lucerus
[1:35:21] and his angels. Amen. And I wrote up
[1:35:23] here the first battle was in the minds
[1:35:25] of the angels. Ain't that right? That's
[1:35:28] where the great battle was. How many
[1:35:30] knows the front line of the war right
[1:35:33] now? And I'll show you a quote where he
[1:35:34] said it. Whether it's right now or even
[1:35:37] back then, the great battle, the front
[1:35:39] line is right here.
[1:35:44] Okay. So, we are just laying the
[1:35:47] foundation. So, we know it didn't
[1:35:49] originate in the earth. It originated in
[1:35:51] heaven. Amen. Then it fell down, cast
[1:35:53] down to human beings. Amen. From angels
[1:35:56] battles. From the battle from angels
[1:35:58] became human battles. Amen. Now before
[1:36:01] any battle can be put away there has to
[1:36:03] be a place selected right but Abram
[1:36:07] called it a m mutual ground no man's
[1:36:09] land and they fight at this place they
[1:36:13] just don't fight over here and there
[1:36:14] there has to be a certain place they
[1:36:15] test their powers amen
[1:36:19] how many knows every day those thoughts
[1:36:21] that come your way
[1:36:23] your powers are being tested
[1:36:27] Satan is testing you trying you trying
[1:36:29] to give you the thought trying to give
[1:36:30] you that thought. Ain't that right?
[1:36:35] See, Paul, he said, "The weapons of our
[1:36:36] warfare are not carnal, but mighty
[1:36:38] through God to the pulling down of
[1:36:39] strongholds." See, we have to cast down
[1:36:42] imagination
[1:36:43] and every high thing that exalted itself
[1:36:46] against the knowledge of God and bring
[1:36:49] into captivity
[1:36:51] every thought,
[1:36:56] every thought to the obedience of
[1:36:58] Christ. I don't care if you've been a
[1:37:00] Christian 150 years.
[1:37:02] Amen.
[1:37:02] You'd probably be dead by now. But if
[1:37:04] you was, Amen. You would had this. This
[1:37:07] here is something that we all have to
[1:37:09] work on.
[1:37:11] To bring every thought
[1:37:13] captive.
[1:37:17] Well, I just don't feel like going
[1:37:19] tonight.
[1:37:21] Of course you don't. Who does?
[1:37:23] But in your spirit, devil, you ain't
[1:37:25] going to keep me at home.
[1:37:27] Huh? That's right.
[1:37:31] All kinds of all kinds of thoughts that
[1:37:34] you and I have. And remember this,
[1:37:37] you'll never be overcome by temptation.
[1:37:39] Temptation will never get you. Lust will
[1:37:42] never get you until first you open up
[1:37:45] the womb of your mind.
[1:37:47] Until you let that thought come on in.
[1:37:51] Amen.
[1:37:55] I'm probably going to get ahead of
[1:37:56] myself here, but I like what brother
[1:37:59] Brandham said. See, it must be accepted
[1:38:01] in the mind. And he says, listen, he
[1:38:05] says, what you want to do with this
[1:38:06] devil is you want to kill him at the
[1:38:08] beginning.
[1:38:11] Stop him dead in his tracks.
[1:38:16] That's the kind of church we want,
[1:38:18] right? believers that kill him where he
[1:38:21] is very beginning when the first thought
[1:38:24] comes first negative thought
[1:38:27] but the Bible says don't ever let a
[1:38:28] negative thought come into your mind if
[1:38:30] you possibly can help it
[1:38:33] ain't that right stop it stop it right
[1:38:35] there it's not about having a big long
[1:38:37] war
[1:38:39] I don't want no big old long drawn out
[1:38:41] war
[1:38:42] he tried to get in I said get behind me
[1:38:45] Satan war's over he's gone
[1:38:50] Stop him dead in his tracks. It ain't
[1:38:53] how long you can make the war linger.
[1:38:55] It's stop it right now.
[1:38:58] How many believe it's about time, Amen,
[1:39:00] that these words come off of the pages
[1:39:02] onto your heart into my heart that God
[1:39:05] will write his laws and his rules in our
[1:39:08] mind?
[1:39:10] That's what it's time for, folks. It's
[1:39:13] time for this bride to become what she's
[1:39:15] predestined to become.
[1:39:19] Amen.
[1:39:21] Stop him dead in his I like that. Amen.
[1:39:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:35] Stop him. Dead in his tracks.
[1:39:39] Now, so he says here,
[1:39:42] each one of those powers are testing
[1:39:44] their powers.
[1:39:49] I'm going to say this because it's come
[1:39:51] twice in my mind now.
[1:39:53] But one part of our mind is memory.
[1:39:57] Is that right? We remember things
[1:40:04] and your mind can be absolute torture.
[1:40:11] Your mind can torture you so much so
[1:40:15] that you want to blow your brains out.
[1:40:18] Just can't stand it.
[1:40:22] Or but God has not given us a spirit of
[1:40:26] fear
[1:40:27] but of peace and a sound mind.
[1:40:31] Is that right? Just a sound. I'm
[1:40:32] thankful for sound mind.
[1:40:38] I wanted to go down this road a little
[1:40:40] bit about the mind and maybe I will
[1:40:43] talking about choices.
[1:40:46] Always young people always make good
[1:40:48] choices.
[1:40:51] You'll make enough wrong
[1:40:54] but don't do it knowingly.
[1:40:57] Hello.
[1:40:59] Because the choices that we make
[1:41:03] go with us for our lifetime.
[1:41:06] The things that you do are part of you
[1:41:10] for a lifetime,
[1:41:12] whether good or whether bad.
[1:41:17] Amen.
[1:41:21] And I got wrote down that you can be
[1:41:23] forgiven for your bad. You can have them
[1:41:26] washed away and you don't have to worry
[1:41:28] about them. But one thing's sure, you'll
[1:41:31] never forget them.
[1:41:34] The devil will always bring them back
[1:41:36] up.
[1:41:37] Sometime or other you will think about
[1:41:39] them and there will be terrible
[1:41:42] thoughts. It'll be thoughts that you
[1:41:44] wish you wouldn't have.
[1:41:48] So that's why I said to young people,
[1:41:50] try to do always the right thing, the
[1:41:52] good thing. Stay close to God.
[1:41:54] Everything else you'll later on regret.
[1:42:01] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:04] But a man makes a statement, "A man
[1:42:06] can't even sin." Hallelujah. Here it is
[1:42:08] coming fresh. A man cannot even sin
[1:42:10] until he casts aside God's word. Amen.
[1:42:13] How many knows you can't even do wrong
[1:42:16] until you know that you disobey mom and
[1:42:17] dad? Isn't that right? You know to do
[1:42:20] better. That's why it's so important to
[1:42:22] have parents that teach the children.
[1:42:24] They form their minds from a young age.
[1:42:28] Can't even sin or disbelieve until first
[1:42:30] he gets rid of the word of God. He
[1:42:32] cannot. Eve could not sin until she
[1:42:35] first laid aside God's word, opening up
[1:42:37] the channel of her reasons to her soul
[1:42:40] to begin to reason. That's another
[1:42:43] thought I wanted to get into. But that's
[1:42:45] the one thing about our mind that you
[1:42:47] have to watch the most deadly thing
[1:42:50] about us is our power to reason
[1:42:55] because the devil will use that
[1:42:56] reasoning.
[1:42:58] Well, you don't feel any better. So and
[1:43:00] so tried it and they didn't get any
[1:43:02] better. They tried to believe and died.
[1:43:06] And boy, the devil will scream that loud
[1:43:08] at you. Yeah, they died.
[1:43:11] How who do you think you are? You think
[1:43:13] you got more faith than them and he
[1:43:17] tries to actually get you to doubt, not
[1:43:20] believe just because of that. Amen.
[1:43:23] That's how he works through reasoning.
[1:43:27] Amen. So to listen to this, test your
[1:43:30] powers. I I I'll try not to hold you
[1:43:33] past 22 till
[1:43:36] give or take
[1:43:39] that mutual ground. Listen now. Don't
[1:43:42] miss this. When this great battle
[1:43:45] started on earth, there had to be a
[1:43:46] mutual meeting meeting place. Amen.
[1:43:50] There had to be a place selected for
[1:43:51] that battle to begin for that battle to
[1:43:54] rage. And that battle began in the human
[1:43:57] mind. There's where the battle starts.
[1:43:59] The human mind was chosen for the place
[1:44:01] of battle
[1:44:04] where it is to begin. Amen. And that is
[1:44:08] because now I like this. This is
[1:44:10] bringing another whole thing in. And
[1:44:12] that is because that decisions are made
[1:44:16] in the mind. How many know that's why
[1:44:18] you go this way or you go that way?
[1:44:21] That's where you make your choice.
[1:44:24] Jesus said, you know, it's not what goes
[1:44:26] in a man that defiles him. It's what
[1:44:29] comes out of a man that defiles him.
[1:44:32] Adulteries and wickedness and thefts and
[1:44:34] murderers come from the heart. Ain't
[1:44:37] that right? That's what people's got in
[1:44:39] their heart. So you have what you what
[1:44:42] you have in your heart because of what
[1:44:44] comes into your mind.
[1:44:49] Amen.
[1:44:54] And that's not just about wickedness,
[1:44:56] evil. That's about this here.
[1:45:00] You become what you allow to come into
[1:45:02] your mind down into your heart. You
[1:45:03] become this
[1:45:06] makes me love everybody.
[1:45:09] I just hate that person. He hit me.
[1:45:12] Well, I just hate that person. And on
[1:45:14] the other hand, you didn't let that
[1:45:15] bother you. I forgive that person. He
[1:45:17] didn't mean to do that. Woo! Glory.
[1:45:19] Great big battle. Whole world of
[1:45:21] difference. That whole different world
[1:45:23] you're living on.
[1:45:24] Why? Because you fought the battle.
[1:45:28] That's where it's at.
[1:45:32] Amen. And we're going all the way back
[1:45:34] to where it started. Ain't that right?
[1:45:38] If Eve disbelieved one word, Brother Bam
[1:45:41] said, how are we going to get back
[1:45:42] unless we believe every word?
[1:45:46] Amen.
[1:45:48] That's right. And we got to start with
[1:45:52] our mind. How many knows when the gospel
[1:45:55] preached when Tommy goes out there and
[1:45:57] witness to the streets and they have to
[1:45:59] make their choice.
[1:46:01] They have they have to make a choice.
[1:46:04] Do they believe it? Ah, that's just fin.
[1:46:06] You just sin.
[1:46:10] Amen. You got to cast cast it away
[1:46:12] first.
[1:46:14] Amen. All right. Decisions are made from
[1:46:18] the mind, the head. Amen. He says,
[1:46:22] because that's the battlegrounds where
[1:46:24] you've got to meet your enemy is in the
[1:46:28] mind. You got to make your choice. It
[1:46:32] meets you.
[1:46:35] Amen. This little girl, little girl very
[1:46:38] sick. Be sure to listen to this real
[1:46:42] good. Now,
[1:46:45] aren't you glad for and and I may do
[1:46:48] this. We'll we'll see. This is kind of
[1:46:50] the way the direction that I kind of
[1:46:51] felt led when I started this series is
[1:46:53] going into some of these messages that
[1:46:55] Brother Brandon brought. Amen.
[1:46:59] And this is one of them. Knowing that
[1:47:00] it's spiritual food. How many believe
[1:47:02] this is spiritual food in due season?
[1:47:04] And when he gave us when he preached the
[1:47:07] greatest battle ever fought, he gave you
[1:47:10] he gave me the weaponry,
[1:47:14] the understanding, the knowledge by the
[1:47:18] power of the Holy Ghost to defeat the
[1:47:21] devil.
[1:47:22] How many believe that? So that you can
[1:47:25] continuously be full of joy, full of
[1:47:27] peace, how that you can kill him in his
[1:47:30] tracks.
[1:47:38] Amen.
[1:47:41] Oh my. I'm here to tell you when you've
[1:47:44] got that devil of depression down there
[1:47:47] and you're looking at him down there.
[1:47:48] Hey, devil of depression. You know, I
[1:47:52] was depressed. You had me all
[1:47:54] downhearted.
[1:47:56] I was all sad, blue, but I'm happy now
[1:47:59] because Jesus took me out of your cage.
[1:48:02] You're dead. Depression. I like you
[1:48:05] down. Stomp on me a little bit. You
[1:48:08] don't have to walk around depressed. No,
[1:48:11] you can have victory over that devil.
[1:48:14] It don't matter what it is. Why do you
[1:48:17] think brother man said we ought to be
[1:48:19] the happiest people in the planet?
[1:48:22] Amen. Why? because we have power over.
[1:48:24] We don't have to fear anything. We ain't
[1:48:26] got to fear death. We ain't got to fear
[1:48:28] cancer. We ain't got to fear nothing.
[1:48:32] Every devil is subject powerless.
[1:48:36] This food told us, brother Tommy, that
[1:48:38] the devil is powerless.
[1:48:40] He's nothing but a bluff
[1:48:43] to the believer.
[1:48:48] Amen.
[1:48:51] Nukes.
[1:48:55] Iran wants nukes.
[1:48:58] These evil people want nukes.
[1:49:02] How many thinks we're safe with Putin
[1:49:04] and his nukes?
[1:49:08] Is Putin a good guy or is he a bad guy?
[1:49:12] He's not a good guy.
[1:49:15] North Korea leader, he's a good guy.
[1:49:19] Amen.
[1:49:21] No.
[1:49:22] Like Trump says, you know, he says,
[1:49:24] "Y'all are all right except y'all look a
[1:49:26] little skinny over there, starving the
[1:49:29] people, you know."
[1:49:32] But they talk about nukes.
[1:49:35] How many believes that this word Now,
[1:49:39] let me just read this. Listen to this.
[1:49:44] I'll get to it here in the next quote.
[1:49:46] Listen. If one little iota
[1:49:49] of God's word was disbelieved
[1:49:52] caused all this trouble.
[1:50:00] Now he didn't say it, but I'm going to
[1:50:01] say something. Then total belief in the
[1:50:06] word of God is going to uncause all this
[1:50:09] trouble.
[1:50:13] Amen. caused people to be afraid, hide
[1:50:16] behind bushes. They were uh sinful.
[1:50:20] They were fearful. Their conscience was
[1:50:22] condemned and everything. But when you
[1:50:24] believe the word of God, it takes all
[1:50:26] that away.
[1:50:28] How many believes that?
[1:50:30] Think of the world that you can live in
[1:50:33] by believing the word of God
[1:50:35] since disbelief brought all this chaos.
[1:50:39] Believing it. That's right.
[1:50:42] So he says, "How are you going to get
[1:50:43] back disbelieving disbelieving the word?
[1:50:45] You can't do it. You got to shut off all
[1:50:48] these other things. Conscience, memory,
[1:50:49] reasonings, cast down reasonings. You
[1:50:53] don't reason about it at all. Not at
[1:50:56] all. You just accept the word upon the
[1:51:00] basis God said." So, amen. And it sets a
[1:51:04] stream between you and God. And every
[1:51:07] channel becomes open between you and
[1:51:09] God.
[1:51:11] How many's that for there? There's your
[1:51:13] babble. There's the very front line.
[1:51:19] Your mind tonight is the very front
[1:51:24] line. I mean, it was that's the
[1:51:28] deadliest place there is. It's right on
[1:51:31] the front line.
[1:51:33] Amen.
[1:51:45] I'm going to skip that one and come back
[1:51:46] to my thought that I was fixing to say
[1:51:48] about the nuke bomb. He says, "Listen,
[1:51:50] it can batter against you, but it can't
[1:51:53] get you until you accept it." When Satan
[1:51:56] walked up the eve and says, "You know
[1:51:58] the fruit's pleasant." She stopped for a
[1:52:00] minute.
[1:52:02] Oh, that's when she made her mistake.
[1:52:05] How many knows when you and I when you
[1:52:07] stop for a minute and think the wrong
[1:52:10] thoughts, that's where you make your
[1:52:12] mistakes.
[1:52:16] Don't stop for a minute. Nelly Sanders,
[1:52:18] y'all know the story. Got saved filled
[1:52:20] with the Holy Ghost. Woo! Walked by that
[1:52:23] dance hall,
[1:52:25] heard the music,
[1:52:27] just the walking.
[1:52:30] And she stopped. No.
[1:52:33] No,
[1:52:35] don't. She made the mistake when she
[1:52:37] quit walking.
[1:52:40] She stopped.
[1:52:42] That was her mistake.
[1:52:44] She yielded
[1:52:47] to the wrong voice.
[1:52:49] Oh, I remember when me and So, man, we'd
[1:52:52] get all the prizes of being the best
[1:52:54] dancers. And I remember this and I reme
[1:52:57] you talk about opening up the womb with
[1:52:58] the mind. Isn't that right?
[1:53:00] That's right. Before she even knew it,
[1:53:02] she was in there dancing again.
[1:53:05] Come to brother Brandham to get prayed
[1:53:07] for. Right. Amen. And his brother,
[1:53:10] Brother Brandham's brother was there. He
[1:53:12] had to go bring his drunk brother back,
[1:53:14] put him on some cot over there, and he
[1:53:16] was laying there. If if I got my story
[1:53:19] right, and Nelly comes in there, he
[1:53:20] prays for her. And all of a sudden, a
[1:53:22] great big old ugly looking bat creature
[1:53:25] comes. Don't nobody have nightmares. Not
[1:53:28] a night. Come flopping around. Isn't
[1:53:30] that right? And goes over his brother
[1:53:33] jumps up off the bed cuz he went in
[1:53:35] behind his bed. He's sobered up. That
[1:53:38] man was sober. I'll tell you what, a
[1:53:40] good ice bath will sober you up or some
[1:53:42] some devil flying behind you. That's a
[1:53:44] good another good remedy for sobering
[1:53:46] you up.
[1:53:51] But you see, we made light of that. But
[1:53:53] still, you realize that bat. Can you
[1:53:55] imagine by just her stopping,
[1:53:58] by when she stopped and she began to
[1:54:00] think that that devil came into there.
[1:54:03] Oh, it might have sounded like good
[1:54:05] music. But the way that she danced and
[1:54:07] twisted herself in there and everything
[1:54:09] else, it was a hideous bat demon that
[1:54:12] was on her. Hello. So, don't never think
[1:54:15] that all of that is glamorous. No, those
[1:54:17] are bat demons.
[1:54:19] Amen. But she stopped and listened for
[1:54:21] just a minute.
[1:54:25] That was her mistake. Dayan and Kora.
[1:54:28] Dayan, remember, he let the devil talk
[1:54:30] in his mind. He opened up for a minute
[1:54:33] and said, "You know, Mo Moses, you're
[1:54:35] not the only holy man. Who made you a
[1:54:37] ruler over?" I'm telling you who did.
[1:54:39] God did.
[1:54:42] What happened? The earth swallowed them
[1:54:44] up. Opened up. God wasn't too pleased
[1:54:47] with all of that. Why? The wrong
[1:54:48] thoughts. Same wrong thoughts that
[1:54:50] happened in heaven. How many believe the
[1:54:51] blood of Jesus Christ, we need to block.
[1:54:53] We need to guard church. If I don't say
[1:54:55] nothing else tonight, you guard against
[1:54:57] any thought that is contrary to this
[1:54:59] word.
[1:55:00] Amen. We've got Isaiah Isaiah 63. Why?
[1:55:04] The bomb of Gilead. How many knows?
[1:55:06] Amen. There's healing. Amen. Isaiah 53.
[1:55:08] If you're sick by his stripes, you are
[1:55:10] healed. You claim that with all of your
[1:55:13] heart, you sow it in there and you don't
[1:55:14] doubt it for a minute. Believe it with
[1:55:16] all your heart.
[1:55:19] All right. Well, it's 22.
[1:55:23] Praise the Lord. You love him.
[1:55:28] Amen.
[1:55:34] Don't stop for nothing. You've got the
[1:55:36] message. Jesus lives. He's a healer.
[1:55:38] That's the message. Don't stop for
[1:55:40] nothing. Amen. Listen to this. Now, I
[1:55:43] told you I was going to tell you that
[1:55:45] that battle's going on even now. Now,
[1:55:47] when you get into that, get the battle
[1:55:49] set in array. Now, the devil's sitting
[1:55:52] right at the heart of every person this
[1:55:54] morning. He's sitting at this little
[1:55:56] girl's heart. He's sitting at your
[1:55:59] heart. The devil.
[1:56:01] How many believes he's still sitting
[1:56:03] right there? That devil is right there.
[1:56:07] Sitting at your heart. He's sitting all
[1:56:09] around here saying, "Oh, I've tried it
[1:56:12] before. I've heard that before. I hope
[1:56:16] nobody had that thought." But by When
[1:56:18] are you going to quit preaching? I've
[1:56:20] heard all that.
[1:56:21] Sounds like the devil talking to you.
[1:56:24] Huh? I've heard that before. Don't let
[1:56:26] it. Because why? Every thought that
[1:56:28] comes through your mind is important.
[1:56:31] Amen. I like what he said earlier. He
[1:56:33] said, "If if everybody could get
[1:56:35] everything just in one accord and one
[1:56:37] mind, there would not be one thie among
[1:56:39] among us in the next five minutes."
[1:56:42] The point that he was making is that
[1:56:44] battle is so present that right now it
[1:56:46] doesn't matter what you have need of.
[1:56:48] How many believes he's still on the
[1:56:49] mercy seat?
[1:56:50] If you can open your open mind up and
[1:56:52] say, "Well, Brother Rer, I need this."
[1:56:56] Folks, I'm here to tell you I believe
[1:56:57] I'm a I'm a preacher that believes that
[1:57:00] the congregation is supposed to get it
[1:57:02] when the preacher's preaching it.
[1:57:05] That's right. When the word comes forth,
[1:57:07] you say, "I believe that." Amen,
[1:57:09] brother. That's mine. Yeah. Get it.
[1:57:12] Because when Peter was yet speaking
[1:57:14] these words, they believed and the Holy
[1:57:17] Ghost fell on them.
[1:57:20] How many believes you can get it right
[1:57:21] there in your seat wherever you are? The
[1:57:23] minute that you hear it, I don't care
[1:57:25] what it is. It's the heart. God will
[1:57:26] speak it to your heart.
[1:57:28] Nothing is powerful as the word being
[1:57:31] believed, being preached,
[1:57:33] and then being received by you.
[1:57:36] Amen.
[1:57:43] I think that's good note to you know on
[1:57:45] praise the Lord.
[1:57:49] Amen.
[1:57:50] Brothers to musicians if you'll come
[1:57:53] please
[1:57:58] stand with me. Get uncomfortable for a
[1:58:01] minute.
[1:58:06] sitting that long. It might be
[1:58:07] comfortable to stretch a little,
[1:58:08] wouldn't it? That's right,
[1:58:12] folks. I don't know about you, but I
[1:58:14] thank the Lord when I lay down. I thank
[1:58:17] him when I get up. I thank him for every
[1:58:19] breath.
[1:58:20] Amen. How many's just glad for the Lord
[1:58:22] and how good he is to us? Amen. Let's
[1:58:24] give the Lord a hand. Say, "Thank you,
[1:58:25] Lord Jesus."
[1:58:31] Amen. God bless you. I hope you got
[1:58:33] something. Amen.
[1:58:35] I hope you got something from the word
[1:58:36] tonight,
[1:58:37] young people. Everybody, every third
[1:58:39] thought that's contrary to the word of
[1:58:41] God, throw it out. Don't even entertain
[1:58:43] it for a minute. Amen. And birds fly
[1:58:45] over the head. Amen. Don't let him build
[1:58:47] a nest. Amen. God bless you. Amen,
[1:58:50] brother David.
[1:58:52] Talk to me about

[2:03:25] little testimony before we done the
[2:03:27] prayer request, but I went for my
[2:03:29] six-month checkup on my heart. Said,
[2:03:32] "I'm good." Believe it or not, I have a
[2:03:34] heart. He said I was good and my blood
[2:03:36] pressure, Brother Tommy right there. And
[2:03:40] uh and I just they were telling all the
[2:03:44] medicine I take and they said Leinipril
[2:03:46] and that's for high blood pressure. I
[2:03:47] said I don't take that. God help me. I
[2:03:50] don't take it. So he started telling all
[2:03:52] the medicine I take for diabetes. I said
[2:03:55] God's helping me with that. I'm not
[2:03:56] going to be taking that much longer
[2:03:58] either. So I mean I believe the victory

[2:04:12] pray one for another. And you know, we
[2:04:15] always thank the musicians. And but I'll
[2:04:18] tell you, I appreciate Brother Micah and
[2:04:20] brother Carson because brother Carson
[2:04:22] helps me out a lot cuz I have a horrible
[2:04:26] memory and he's always, as they say,
[2:04:28] Johnny on the spot. But appreciate
[2:04:31] brother Carson and brother Micah. And
[2:04:33] you know, let's give them a hand
[2:04:34] tonight. And Amen. And you know, Amen.
[2:04:39] And if anything goes wrong, everybody
[2:04:42] thinks they made a mistake, but they
[2:04:44] didn't. Brother Micah said the other
[2:04:45] night when the words went down, he said,
[2:04:47] "Our system just went down." You just
[2:04:50] pray for them. You know, I pray for our
[2:04:52] musicians. I pray for me, and I pray for
[2:04:54] them because the enemy, he don't want us
[2:04:56] to have what? The victory. God bless you
[2:04:58] as you go. Remember 10:30 Sunday
[2:05:01] morning. Well, victory,

[2:05:07] Oh, victory,
[2:05:10] victory shall be mine.
