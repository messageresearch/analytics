your ability to preach or sing or or whatever it might be you know those things are going to fail you but if your hope is in the Lord Jesus Christ he'll never leave you never forsake you but he'll be with you to the end of the world and I believe that's a promise that we all can grab a hold of and and anchor in our lives amen well you happy to be in the house of the Lord this evening amen I'm brother Josh Martin I don't know most of y'all don't know me I see a few familiar faces but I'm from PA Oklahoma my pastor is Brother wend Martin they and the Saints through New New Life Outreach they send their greetings and so um it's just good to be here tonight appreciate the opportunity to be ministering I'm just a simple preacher but I pray something can be said to help and to bless in some way but if you would have your Bibles let's open our scriptures to 2 Corinthians 4:15 I appreciate brother Austin and sister seren the opening up their house house to us I'm by myself this time my wife is normally with me but she's there in Ohio with her family um we we passed through the area quite a bit we stay with brother Austin and uh quite often and I was telling brother brother berer he's going to have to start charging us rent as many times as we stop in but we appreciate their friendship and their Hospitality I pray the Lord blesses them but 2 Corinthians 4:15 the Bible would say or 2 Corinthians 4:15 for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redown to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inborn man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh far for us more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory why we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal amen you thankful for that can we bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you Lord and we're thankful for your grace and your mercy God God thank you for what you've done for us Lord in this generation giving us this message God lord as we come into this portion of the service I ask that you would help me to get myself out of the way Lord you see the needs that are in the building tonight God lord only you can touch the hearts and meet the needs father Lord As I Lay myself aside I ask that you would speak tonight Lord Lord may you anoint the hearer as well father may they lay aside their thoughts God or what they may have done today Lord and receive what you have for them Lord God we lay the service into your hands in jesus' name amen and you may be seated tonight and if I had a subject it would be stabilized by the Unseen and these are just some things i' had been ministering on back at our our home church so hope it's okay if I just take my Liberty tonight but I I want want to start off by reading a quote brother Brandon would say because we got a prayer line coming up and many are standing the rooms and around the walls and so forth and I know you it's very hard on you and I stood a many time myself and I passed by a while ago bringing the wife down and I noticed the people around the doors and I thought who says the gospel still isn't the most attractive thing there is in the world sure it is it attracts those who are interested in it and I thought that was a powerful statement who says that the gospel still ain't the most attractive thing there is in the world and it attracts those who are interested in it and I believe that you're attracted to this message because you've realized there's something different about it you see brother Brandon would tell us that the uh the reason that the Rich Young Ruler would come to Jesus instead of the priests and ask for eternal life was because he knew they didn't have anything to offer but he realized that Jesus was something different so even though he couldn't accept what Jesus had he knew what he had was different and I believe the world can testify they might not be able to live what you've got but what you do have is something genuine it's an attraction that attracts those who are interested in it and I believe that this message has brought the Unseen into a reality where we're not just serving a god of the history books not just serving a god of of Noah or of Moses or or or just of Jesus but we're serving a god of today that can still still heal can still deliver can still encourage it's a god that is in the Unseen that has been brought into a reality and what what is so incredible is God has chose preachers to preach the realities of the Unseen and it's sort of incredible that God has chosen men with flaws to bring a Flawless message you know men that have heartaches and pains and aches and pains but as they get behind the the sacred desk and as they start to preach the word they're getting beyond what they think and letting you know this ain't a man's idea but this is God's word for you to bring a hope and an assurance and brother Brandon would tell us now God has chose preachers a God that could have chose the gospel to preach be preached by the son and by the moon and by the stars and by the wind or by nature but he chose men to preach the gospel and that's where the voice of God will come from and you can judge the voice according to the word it expresses then you can see what kind of voice you're listening to if it's contrary to the word don't listen to it but if it is the word then God is Duty bound to back that word up and vindicate it and make it the truth because he has promised to do it so we're living in a great day these words of Christ expressed and I thought that was powerful he would say we're living in a great day The Words of Christ expressed and so when a preacher gets up and he starts to minister he's bringing the word of Christ express to you where it's no longer no longer in a mystery form but we're bringing you you not a de letter but the realities of what is in the scripture that has been sealed up through all the church ages has been unveil to let you know that we're not serving a god of yesterday but a god of today and I left how brother Brandon would put it you can judge the voice according to the word it expresses he says if it's not expressing the word he says you don't have to listen to it but if it is the word then he says God's Duty bound to back it up and I say if you have a pastor here that is preaching the word of God you should get behind him you should get behind him with all of your might not just with your am man but support him because God has given you a voice that is lining up with the voice of God but I like how brother brownon would put it God is Duty bound to back up that word and that sort of takes the the pressure off of a Preacher whenever God's responsible for his word so it's not brother berer try to make you a good Christian brother berer trying to make you Rapture Ready all he is doing is coming under inspiration and preaching the word of God and as the word Falls in your heart then God comes and starts to Quicken it and make it live in your life you see Mark 16 and 20 would say and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with him confirming the sign confirming the word with signs following so all the disciples had to do was preach the gospel go El then God went with him confirming the word with signs falling so if you want to see a Revival preach the message if you want to see Miracles preach the message I believe the message has led us know the God is still a god of Miracles he's still the god that opens blinded eyes he's still the god that heals cancer he's still the god that can restore marriages all we got to do is point you to the Unseen and let you know that he is alive today not God of yesterday but he is a god of today oh we're bringing to you the word of God expressed and it's sort of incredible that whenever a preacher gets up and he starts to preach there's a boldness I I'm sure the ministers ministers can testify whenever you're there in the office you're nervous you know my my wife can can can testify every I I get butterflies in my stomach but as soon as you come under the anointing there's a confidence cuz you know that you're not preaching your yourself you're preaching the word of God and acts 2831 would say preaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence so as long as you're preaching the Lord Jesus Christ there's all confidence that's why the Apostle Paul would say I am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of God he realized what he had found and had anchored himself to was the power of God for this generation and that's why we're not ashamed of this message it is the supernatural that has been brought in this generation so a preacher don't get up and preach at dos and don'ts and condemnation sometimes it steps on your toes but he's not preaching condemnation he's preaching grace to you you see how would you know to fix things if you never knew you was wrong right so sometimes it hurts whenever the preacher steps on your toes but it is the grace of God letting you know if you continue going that that way you're going to end up in a failure end up in a wreck but the grace of God comes and says hey if you can change it this way you can see the realities in your life so a preacher Don't Preach dos and don'ts and condemnation but he's preaching grace to you and whenever you can't see victory for yourself a preacher sees victory for you and that's what's so incredible is I can testify of it when whenever I've had a hard day of work you know I'm sort of discouraged things ain't going the right way but I come to church even even though I'm discouraged and as the preacher begins to preach he's preaching Victory to me he's preaching over what I am going through and lifting me up that I can see what he's talking about you see a preacher preaches under inspiration that I I believe that that when he's studying even though he might have notes they're inspired as he's praying praying and as he's studying listening to tapes it's God inspiring him what direction to go so whenever you're sitting on the Pew and he's preaching he's preaching an inspired word over the conditions that you're setting in so when you're setting discouraged and all you see is your bad day all you see is your failures all that you can see are the mistakes you make and when the preacher begins to preach he's breaking a way where you can see into the Unseen realm that he's preaching by and when you can't see victory for yourself he's preaching Victory where when you come into the church discouraged you can leave the church encouraged you see it's not what the preacher can do he's preaching the Unseen which is breaking away for you to see it for yourself you see I believe this message ain't just a preacher's message it's a Young Person's message it's a mama and a daddy message you know so as we begin to preach the word there's something identifying with the word that is being brought to you you see brother Brandon he he would talk about the eagle and would say when Mama Eagle would would would go by that that barnyard you know we all know the story of the eagle of the the the farmer that would snatch the eagle egg and would put it under the chicken you know and so this little Eagle would grow up with the chickens and he wouldn't know any better all he knew was the Barnyard all he knew was to eat the scrap that the rest of the chickens were eating you know and brother brandom says whenever that eagle would fly by across that barnyard and would begin to scream but the brandom says it was Eagle to Eagle so all he had to do was respond to the voice that was calling kid name you see the chickens didn't have nothing to respond with they Ste there heard the same message they heard the same voice but there was no attraction there was no response then brother br says it's the word spoken to the word predestinated so when the word comes across your life it is word responding to word and you sit there and some might not understand it you know but the Brandon would tell us that there can be two sitting in the same sitting in the same congregation one would say hey he called me a buzzard the other says well he called me an eagle you see you can hear the same things but what are you attracted to and I can say I'm sure you're attracted to the m message of the hour because it is who you are you come from the mind of God so has this message this message came from the mind of God to let you know that you are my Invincible Army upon the Earth today that you can live in the Unseen realm even though your body is walking upon the Earth you know brother Brandon would tell us that Jesus would walk in another world with perfect Faith he would say that they're in the message perfect Faith he would say he would walk in this other the world and his garments had virtues flowing out of them ain't that incredible and he says whenever the the the woman with the issue of blood would touch that garment he said healing would come to that to that young lady because he was walking in another world and what's so incredible is he would not just leave that with Jesus then he would say every man that walks along with God walks in another world with God and he says then virtues are flowing out of you ain't that incredible that it was you if you look at it it was the very garments of Jesus that made him ordinary right he didn't come in in Royal apparel if he would came in Royal apparel I'm sure the priest might have listened to him you know because he maybe he he he looked like he was prestigious and things but it was his ordinary garments that turned them away from Jesus so it was his ordinary garments that God chose virtue to come out of and extraordinary skins that in this generation the virtues of healing and encouragement and strengthening for your brother and to your sister can come out of your ordinary garments what are you talking about brother Josh your ordinary dust you've got aches you've got pains you've got mind battles but when you're walking in this other world in the Unseen with God virtues are coming out of your Humanity when your brother is discouraged you can lift him up it's not what you can do you're living living in an unseen realm and the virtues of God are just being expressed oh you see I believe we're we're we're upon Earth to do more than just be a benchwarmer to do more than just to lift our hands and worship God we're on Earth to express the attributes of a living savior in this generation you know somebody's got to express the attributes but the Brandon would tell us that before the sun was created and before the moon was created God was God alone right and he says God is a god a an object of worship so he wasn't even God at this point he was El Elohim Elohim and he would say that there was no Angels there was nobody to worship Him and inside of this being was attributes he would say there was an attribute to be a Healer an attribute to be a deliverer a friend a savior but since he was God Alone there was nobody to express these things to and so he would create Angels brother the Brandon would tell us in the adoption series I believe part two I believe he says he created angels and then angels will come and worship him and so now the object of worship is being expressed but he still have these attributes to be a Healer a deliverer a friend a sustainer but there was nobody to express these attributes to and so when man fell in the beginning you know the the Satan thought he poured one on God but this made a way for God to express himself in a personal way way to you how would you know God could heal if you never was sick how could you know God could deliver if you never was bound and so now upon Earth today is some Fallen human beings in ordinary garments ordinary skins with Humanity that comes against your mind but in those skins the attributes of Christ are being expressed oh the same mind battles that has taken the ordinary The Ordinary World member to to the grave and in discouragement is not pulling you down because there's another attribute in the inside of you which is from God and it is just expressing itself oh Hallelujah you see we're we're living in the Unseen realm and I believe that I know that was sort of a rabbit Trail hope that was okay but brother Brandon was saying no Lord as I speak tonight of David with the little slingshot he was interested in the father's sheep and no matter how little he was he was ready to display and Conquer with what little he had to conquer with you was with him and I love this part of the quot this is in perseverance and he would say Lord I am coming after the Sheep tonight he says they've been sick I've obeyed your Commandments and and you showed your presence your willingness you've healed them with cards and without cards showing that you are here you never fail you're the omnipresent God and I'm coming to challenge the devil that would keep them behind the sound barrier of unbelief and now that I pray them through tonight and I catch this part he says I break the way with the word of God and set them free in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bring them back to Faith come out Satan ain't that powerful he would say that David would look at that little sheep whenever that little sheep was about to be conquered it did not matter how little of a weapon that David had he had the best the interest of that sheep in mind and that's encouraging as a preacher cuz sometimes you don't feel like you have much to bring but is whatever God has placed upon your heart to bring God could use that and interest somebody into coming into a full Victory and then brother Brandon would say I break away with the word of God ain't the powerful of brother Brown I'm is saying here that he's not breaking away by a vision he's not breaking Away by the first pull or the second pull laying hands on the sick you know but he's breaking away by the word of God to bring them out of doubt and into faith and that is what a minister does every time he's behind the pulpit he's preaching a faith that can lift you up and break away out of your discouragement break away out of your depression that you can see victory for yourself oh Hallelujah God just don't want preachers having Victory he wants the Ley having Victory you remember there in the Old Testament it was only the high priest that can go into the third Court remember the the the worshipper can go in those other courts but never could go into that third Court only the high priest could go into that third court and it was only about once a year but the Bible would tell us that whenever Christ was upon P the cross he would rent that Veil so it's no longer just the ministry having victory but it is whosoever will let him come unto me and I will give him a rest it's letting you know if you're attracted to the Unseen you can have a victory you can have a liberty you can have a joy not just on Sunday not just on Wednesday but every day of the life every day of the week when you're at school when you're at work when you're in the kitchen wherever you're at you can have Victory you're broken into an unseen realm where just you and God oh that's where we belong you know brother the Brandon would tell us that our position as a Believer is in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus he says that's the believer's position not in an nor realm but in a Heavenly place in Christ Jesus Oh Hallelujah so it's the word of God that breaks away that brings you back to Faith out of your discouragement and what is so incredible is Isaiah 61 And1 would say the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek and has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted and Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound what is doing all of these things the preaching of the Gospel oh and Jesus would pick that up there in Luke and would say this day the scripture is fulfilled and brother Brandon would tell us that if Jesus was upon the Earth today he would only do what he did back then and it's so Inc I'll just read it to you he says the only thing he could do now he might he might do like he did when he was on Earth because the Bible says he's the same yesterday today and forever he says is that right and when he was on the earth he didn't claim to be any great person he just preached the gospel so what what brought forth Liberty what opened the prison to them that are bound the preaching of the gospel and how did this take place in the life of Jesus for the Lord God hath anointed me to preach the gospel so whenever Jesus went off of the earth his Spirit came back right to the 120 that was in the upper room and they would come out and they would a the the multitudes would ask would ask the disciples what must we do to be saved repent be baptized what is it they started preaching the same gospel that Jesus started oh oh and I believe that the message of the hour the preaching of it did not go away when Jesus went off of the scene when brother Brandon went off for the scene but the same Angel of the Lord that accompanied brother Brandon in all of those prayer lines and all of those meetings is the same angel that is accompanying the preaching of the Gospel tonight oh I say whatever you have need of the spirit of the Lord God has anointed a preacher to let you know you can walk out of your walk out of your prison cell you can walk out of your cancer you can walk out of your discouragement you can walk out of whatever the devil is plaguing you tonight with you can walk out of it it's the preaching of the Gospel that lets you know there's victory for you even when you can't see it oh it's easy to get discouraged ain't it you know we we're in humanity it's easy to get discouraged you know Jesus would get would would get discouraged you know he would he would get so tired in his Humanity that he would fall asleep upon the boat but you notice he would not let his Humanity get the best of him Humanity would get tired and he would go to sleep Humanity would cry at the grave of Lazarus Humanity would have a headache Humanity would struggle with self-will In The Garden of Gethsemane and would say if it's possible let this cup pass from me the deity on the inside would stand upon on the power of the boat and say peace be still deity would square up his shoulders wipe away the tears and say Lazarus come forth deity would sit there in agonizing and would say not my will but thy will be done let it you know you might fight your Humanity but you can walk in another world you can walk in another world where your Humanity don't get the best of you oh what are you talking about brother Josh I'm saying that deity ain't A Million Miles Away deity is back in humanity Hallelujah you know but the Brandon would say that but the Brandon would say that it was once Badgers living in behind those Badger skins there in the Tabernacle you remember him talking about that in the unveiling of God he says but now it's the housing place for the sh glory of God and he says so can your skins be changed in to the housing place of the kind of presence of God what are you talking about brother Josh deity the Unseen has become materialized inside of some more Humanity Hallelujah that's why we're more than conquerors through Christ Jesus who loved us it ain't you fighting your battles it's God fighting your battles Hallelujah that's why we don't fear cancer it ain't us fighting it God's fighting the battle that's why we don't fear discouragement it ain't us fighting it's God fighting the battle Hallelujah but we got to let God fight the battle oh Hallelujah you God can't fight the battle if you're fighting the battle come on now if you're fighting bitterness you got to give up and let God fight it you know brother the brand I'm would talk about Jehoshaphat there and stand still and see the salvation of God he would say Jehoshaphat was is doing the to the best of his ability to serve the Lord and the nation of Judah and he says then the moabites come up against the nation of Judah and he says as long as they stayed together and prayed God fought the battles and I that that's that that's incredible brother brother berer is because they had to stay together and what the devil likes to do is he sends troubles to a church to divide oh I'm preaching now he sends bitterness to divide he sends complexes to divide he s he he he sends insecurities to divide but this ain't the time to be divided this is the time to come together oh the Apostle Paul would say prove all things and that it is good hold on to it hold on to the things that is good bitterness ain't good oh Hallelujah complexes ain't good prove all things and hold fast to them that are good oh Hallelujah huah you see bitterness ain't something of God it's something to cause a division but you got to prove it and prove all things then hold fast to that which is good oh Hallelujah and so we would see that God has called us for a greater purpose than just than just to be a benchwarmer but he has called you to be a be to be a Powerhouse upon the Earth today and brother Brandon would tell us that the the true Gospel Light the real light of God shows what a man's need is and so that's why we need the preaching of the gospel because it shows you what you need to achieve Victory you know it shows you what you need to get into this other realm with God and and brother Brandon would tell us that Noah would Point them to something when Noah begin to preach it's going to rain he didn't just get up and say it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain but he was pointing to something it's going to rain but there's an ark that can carry us away away from the judgments that are coming upon the Earth and so he did not just preach Doom and Gloom but he preached gloom and doom but there's Grace out of it oh Hallelujah so this a message ain't just gloom and doom you know that the world's going insane America's under judgment but a brought a Grace saying there's a transportation out of this and I'm showing you what you have need of to escape the judgments that are upon the Earth today you see complexes or judgments upon the Earth but it don't pertain to you right you remember whenever the the children of Israel was in Egypt the plagues that came in Egypt was not for the children of Israel it was for the Egyptians so even though they were among them they weren't they weren't partaking of them so whenever the death angel would go through the land they had an Avenue to escape the death angel oh Hallelujah so whenever they would hear the cries of the firstborn screaming this one losing their child this one's marriage is falling apart this one's child has going in a rebellious teenage year they will know that I'm under the transportation that God has given us and with America is under judgment but it does not pertain to you you don't got to lose your children to the world you don't got to lose your mind to complexes and insecurities and anxiety God has provided a way of Escape away from the from the the the judgments that are upon the Earth today oh Hallelujah I'm feeling good this evening you see but you got to look away you got to look to something you know but brother Brandon would tell us that that if you're driving and and the message look and brother Brandon would say if you're driving by something and you see a certain scene you say look and he says if you want somebody else to see it he says you say look to get their attention and I love how brother Brandon describes it he says then you go from saying look to describing what you see and I thought that was powerful because brother Brandon would say look there's a cactus there's a tree there's a mountain so it ain't just saying look but there's a purpose of changing your focus because there was a certain scene that we want you to see and brother Brandon would tell us that whenever Jesus would come to to uh John the Baptist in the Jordan River he would say Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world and the word behold means to look and so brother the Brandon would tell us that the attraction was John the Baptist he says but when Jesus came upon the scene the attraction would go from the prophet to the prophecy so John the Baptist would say look because there was a certain scene that was unfolding to take away the sins of the world oh Hallelujah and brother Brandon would say look look away to Jesus look unto Jesus look to the Unseen he was preaching these messages and not just to say look but he was describing to you that the Unseen has been made visible that the message is more than tapes and quotes and and doctrines and phrases and things that we say it's a it's not an ult but it is the realities that you can look at and achieve it oh hallah that you can look at and and grab for yourself you see if you can't experience a living God why serve him come on now that ain't the time to get quiet if you can't experience a living God why come to church if you can't experience a friend that Stith closer than a brother why serve him and you may say well that's off boat but it's true I believe we can all experience a living God but the brand going tell the story of the little boy he wanted to see God y youall remember the story and he would come up to his mama and would say mama can anybody see God and she would say son that's the Sunday school teacher he would come up to the Sunday school teacher Sunday school teacher can anybody see God and she would say no son nobody can see God and live and so he would go out of the class would go to the preacher and would say preacher can anybody see God and he would say no son nobody can see God and live why serve a God that you can't see right so he was discouraged and heartbroken and but the Brandon would tell us that he was walking down a down a path towards the lake and there was a rainbow and Y y'all know the story there was a rainbow and there was an old man sitting in a boat upon the lake and he was looking at that rainbow with tears coming down his face and the little boy would run and jump in that boat and would say Sir can anybody see God and he would say son that's all I have seen for the past 35 years has been God mama was looking up the same rainbow Daddy was looking at the same rainbow the Sunday school teacher the preacher was looking at the same rainbow but seen all they seen was clouds but this old man had been through some storms he had been through some discouragements and could see that that is more than a cloud that is a promise that is a covenant and if God has kept his promised to Noah all of these years he's not going to fail to keep his promise for you oh Hallelujah this boy went from hearing you can't see God to a man saying I've experienced God you can see him too I've experienced God you can see him too and I love that because he would say that's all I've seen you see so whenever you see God with an understanding you see him everywhere you look up the trees you see God and what's incredible is the same things that is turning the unbelievers away it's causing you to believe you remember whenever the the the uh the two ladies would go to the Tomb of Jesus the Bible says that they would come to the Tomb at the rising of the Sun and they found the body of Christ gone and that discouraged him the Bible says they were perplexed the word is confused or or discouraged and you would think that the tomb being empty was evidence he was alive right and since they since since they had since they hadn't experienced the realities of it there were looking at an empty tomb and saying what happened here and here in Angel and what I love about the story is the Angels started to talk to them and say why do you seek the living among the dead in other words you can't find the realities looking in a denominational system oh Hallelujah you got to change the way that you're looking at the word according to the priests and you got to look up the way the Christ brought it you see oh my if you're looking at the word in a way that some preacher was telling you to look at it you might look at it the wrong way but God has sent a message and Vindicated that message and say here Look Away to Jesus and you can see it and what's so incredible about that story is the Bible says that the Angels started to talk to them and started to started to remind them you remember how Jesus spoke to you how he said these things had to come to pass and the Bible says they remembered his words it was an angel that would Point them back to the very words of Jesus and the remembrance of Jesus words would bring a reality to their heart that he is not here but he is alive and I'm so glad we had an angel in this generation that says quit looking at it that way look at the word this way and you can see that he is alive hallelujah oh my brother Brandon would say this and looking in the Unseen he would say what where if you look at with your eyes you see now that are nation is shaking and tribling War clouds are flying everywhere every nation is distressed in a perplexity of time every sign that Jesus said would happen is happening there would be signs in the heavens above and in the earth below great things would be taking place like flying saucers and and Mystic things taking place and I love this part of the quote he says but he commanded he Church to lift up their heads in that day and to look up for the Unseen Christ will be appearing pretty soon I thought that was powerful cuz brother Brandon was saying Jesus would tell there there be distress of Nations this here is going to be happening this is going to be taking place and brother brandom says we see it taking place now but then he would go back to the words of Jesus and would say but he commanded the church to look up and lift up their eyes for the UN seen Christ will be appearing I thought that was powerful because he would say he commanded not suggested the church but commanded the church so sooner or later you got to look away from your problems and look to the Unseen oh Hallelujah sooner or later you got to look away from the bitterness you got to look away from from the a that the devil puts between you and your neighbor you got to look away from that and look to the Unseen and I left brother the Brandon would would would would would put it lift up up their heads and look up for the Unseen Christ will be appearing and brother Brandon would tell us that there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ you remember him talk telling us that and brother Brandon was say God has a provided way in that message now remember these two words before I leave you the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ is two different things Christ is now appearing in the fullness of his power so brother Brandon would would would would say look up and Christ would command the church look up for the Unseen Christ will be appearing pretty soon and what does that mean brother Josh Christ is appearing in the fullness of his power and so we need to look away from the problems and look to the fullness that God has given in this generation oh you got to look away you see if you're constantly looking at the negative side of something hope this is okay if you're looking up the negative side of something that's the perspective you're going to get right you know tonight was my first time meeting brother Bor and I know brother Austin really well so if he would have told me he had two wives you know he had had a crazy past has a kid with this woman a kid with that woman even though his character would speak for itself I would still have that question in the back of my mind right you know even though he says man those are crazy accusations none of that is true there's still going to be a question mark if I'm trying to listen to what he say right so if we're constantly looking up the negative s negative side of something we can hear the truth but there's always going to be the question in the back of our mind so if we're listening to what the naysayers are saying and whenever the preacher says the God can still heal but this one says the days of Miracles are passed the question mark is going to Blind you from the realities of it but brother brandom says he God commanded the church lift up their head look away from what going on in the world systems and look to the Unseen Christ for he is appearing pretty soon and I think he's not appearing pretty soon but he has appeared he is here now in the fullness of his power and we would see that brother Brandon would tell us that people look at the word literally and fail to see it spiritually he says you can look at it literally but he he would tell us that the the word of God cannot be learned like a newspaper right he said say you can't read it like a newspaper he says you got to get down look up and say God Give Me Faith to believe your word and so he would show us the very way we had to look at the word and it's so incredible cuz we needed somebody to show us how to look you know you you you remember Phillip and the and the Ethiopian the Bible would say that when philli came to the Ethiopian the Ethiopian was reading Isaiah 53 and he had many questions and what's so powerful is the Bible says Philip came to him and says do you understand what you read and what would he say how can I unless a man guides me unless a man chose me so he was sitting there in a confused State and the Very purpose of Philip being there was to show him how to look at it oh you remember cuz he was way away and God would bring him there right so the very purpose of him being there was to show that man how to look he was already looking out the scripture and he would ask he would ask philli what's who is he talking about is he talking about himself is he talking about about a prophet who's he talking about and what would the Bible says and and I love how the Bible would put it the Bible says Philip opened his mouth and preached Jesus Oh ain't that powerful he opened his mouth the Bible says that he opened his mouth and taught Jesus and I thought my goodness we had a messenger in this generation in human flesh but when he opened his mouth and brought a message he was preaching to you Jesus showing you how to look quit looking at it through a denominational mindset and look at it in the purity of the word of this generation and what would the Bible say uh but the Bible would say that they would go by a pool of water and that Ethiopian would stop and would say here's water what hindrance me to be baptized and what that is so incredible to me because he was stumped he was confused but once that messenger came by his way it put him into action and brother brandom says once you see the Living Word it put you into action so it wasn't it wasn't Philip saying hey here's some dos and don'ts don't do that don't do this you got to be baptized this certain way as soon as he would see Jesus of the Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new it put him into action oh Hallelujah and that takes the pressure off of the preacher we're not trying to make you a good Christian we're showing you Jesus and that put you into action Hallelujah that's putting you into action you know my my my dad has a saying that the the pastor ain't like a cowboy he ain't going around with the lasso you know trying to catch this one and trying to make you do good he says preachers and cowboys they're Shepherds they they're feeding you they're showing you these things and you're just following the shepherd oh Hallelujah oh my so we would have a message that would show us how to look not like a newspaper not and brother Brandon would tell us that it's going to take more than a student comparing verse with verse right he says it's a prophetic Insight it's a special class of people and it's going to take the leading of the spirit right and and I'm so glad we would have a prophet that would show us these things that it's more than just looking at it but what are you seeing and brother Brandon would would preach a message looking looking under Jesus and would say what do you see when you look he would tell us that you look with your eyes but you see with your heart oh my and he would say we have two men there's an outward man and an inward man he says the outward man is walking by sight walking by your flesh he says the inward man is walking by faith but not by not not walking by what you see but walking by what you believe and brother BR I'm going tell us that we live not by what we see but by what we believe you know and you remember Nicodemus would come to Jesus and Jesus would tell him you know unless you're born again you cannot see the kingdom of God but the Brandon would say that that word see means to understand so seeing for the believer might not be seeing with your eye but it's seeing with the heart it's understanding when you can't see a way out of a situation you understand that God has everything under control you know brother the Brandon would say the perfect Faith Masters all circumstances and he would say that that that what that means is whenever you can't see a way out of it you know God has everything under control and then he would say then we're coming to bride material ain't that powerful that the bride ain't walking by what they see they're walking by what they believe that's what separate you from the rest of the church world is they can't see the supernatural so they don't believe it so even when you don't see God in this church you believe that he's here oh come on now cuz sometimes we go through dry spells I've been there when you come to church man you don't feel nothing how many's ever been there when you go through dry spells you come to church you don't feel like singing you don't feel like lifting up your hands and if you're walking by by your emotions man you're backslid right if you're walking by your emotions man God ain't here but if you're walking by faith you know if the emotions ain't here as long as the word is being preached that's what that that that's what God accompanies is the word and brother Brandon would tell us that that he would say if you're walking by what you see he says your emotions are is what you is your control your emotions are your control and that really really spoke to me because if your emotions are your control sometimes you go to bed you feel great you wake up the next morning you don't feel so great how many's ever been there you go to bed man you feel like you're a good Christian you can overcome everything but you wake up on the wrong side of the bed you get out of bed you got a back aach you got a headache and then all of a sudden you don't feel like a mighty conqueror so if you're walking by your emotions where's your where's your stability at you know where's your stabilizer at but if you're walking by Revelation when your emotions are down you're still stabilized you see cuz brother Brandon would talk about Peter and would say Peter would walk upon substance and I thought that was so powerful there they're in perfect Faith he would say his substance would have led him straight to the feet of Jesus you know what whenever Jesus was walking upon the Water Peter would say if it is you bid me to come right Jesus would say come on and so brother brandom says he was walking upon substance and what I think is so powerful about that was Peter was not walking by his own will he was walking by the will of the father and I thought that is that that is so incredible that Peter would ask that if it is you bid me to come and I and that as I was studying go thing I could relate to him because if you was walking by your own will you wouldn't have confidence in yourself right if you was just wearing your skirts because you wanted to you know what if you're motion somebody come and says man you should wear pants you look like an old woman you're this and you're that if you're walking by you doing it you could be discouraged right but if you know it's the Commandment of God and there's a blessing in it that gives a courage that it's not me doing this because I want to it's because God has commissioned me to right so Peter would say if if it is you bid me to come so he was walking by the Commandment of God oh Hallelujah and brother Brandon would say he was walking on substance but you know what would happen brother brandom says what he believed happened but what he feared also happened he says he looked at the waves and became afraid and he says his fear took away his substance oh my so here he is walking upon the word of God the Commandments of God but he allowed the emotion of fear to lead him and that fear would take away his substance and many times that's what happens to us we're standing in the will of God we're believing for the miracles of god but then fear starts to creep up and if we let that lead us that's going to take away the very strength of our faith because the Bible would say faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen but the Brandon would say that Peter Still professed his faith but had no substance ain't that powerful that he still claimed to have it but did not have the evidence of it and that's where the devil once us many times is professing something without the evidence of it oh come on now and what happens when you lose the evidence of your faith you lose your strength right if you know I've given this example many places but you know say say me the Tom he got to got into an argument and it gets into a heated argument I think I'm right he thinks he's right and it gets physical and I don't think I can take him I'm going to back down right I don't want to get beat up by him so I'm going to back down and cow down to him and say that he is right because I don't have the strength to to face him and if the devil takes away your substance he takes away your strength so whenever spirits come against your home come against your family come against your mind if you don't got no substance no strength you're going to cow down to those Spirits right so if you if you can can cast out fear and walk by faith not by your emotion then use the strength whenever the spirits of the enemy comes against your mind you've got a strength to combat it with you remember the Brandon would talk about the preacher that would have the dream you remember and the devil would say boo and he would he would back down the devil got bigger he got smaller right the devil would say boo he back down got smaller he got bigger but what he had to do and I believe the story goes that he would grab a Bible and would say boo and he got bigger the devil got smaller so there's got to come a time that we get sick and tired of being plagued by fear sick and tired of the devil taking away your substance taking away your joy taking away your peace taking away our stability and say Boo devil you're not taking my joy you're not taking my peace but I'm I'm going to the enemy's camp and I'm taking everything that you stole from me there's a strength there's a strength when you're walking by faith oh Hallelujah there's a strength whenever you're stabilized because you remember brother brownon would would and and I won't hold you long tonight brother brownon would talk about Jonah and would say Jonah would would would win a city the size of St Louis and that's incredible to think about he he would say Nineveh was the size of St Louis and here Jonah would win the city to the Lord but what would happen after he wins the city to the Lord or to Jehovah he would go to a mountain and would say God take my life ain't that incredible that hear the Lord just anointed him performed the great miracle with shaking the the the kingdom of hell but now after the anointing wears off of him he's not stabilized you know why because the Holy Ghost wasn't there yet right the anointer could come upon him but it could not go to the soul you remember the Tabernacle I hope is okay tonight you remember the Tabernacle there was three courts right the the outer Court the inner court and the most holy place and if you go into the first Court where the brandom says the the the light in the first court was from the Sun and from the Moon right so if it was cloudy on the outside it was cloudy in that first court but if you would go into that second Court there there was a there was a roof over it and so that the sun did not dictate the dictate the light of it but the candles sticks with the light right and so who would light the candlesticks the priest right but if you go into the third Court there wasn't no priest with the Candlestick in there the light was the Shak of glory and so whenever it was cloudy on the outside it was still sunny on the inside if the priest was late and fell to light the candles it was still light on the inside and so here Jonah the anointing would come upon his flesh but it didn't go to the soul right but the Brandon would tell us we're a Triune being right we're body we're Soul we Spirit he would say there's five senses to the to the body and he would say it's taste it's smell it's hear it's feel and and it's seeing and then he would say you've got a spirit man and he says there's five senses right hope this is okay and he says that you got five senses to the spirit man imagination affection reasoning uh uh conscience and memory and he says then you've got us hold and he says there's two senses it's faith and it's doubt which is controlled by by self-will right and so the so the spirit of God would anoint Jonah's flesh he would fill God but what happened when the filling left him his soul wasn't stabilized so now he's upon the mountain saying God take my life you see that's why you can't walk by your emotions you got to walk by what your soul believes the message can't just come on your flesh or upon your spirit man it's got to go to the soul but the Brandon would say you can have the Holy Ghost every day of your life and go straight to hell right you can have the Holy Ghost upon your flesh and you can feel good you can dance you can have the Holy Ghost upon your spirit man you can speak in tongues but it's got to go to the soul it's not going to do no good till it go to the soul and this message can't just stay upon your flesh it can't just stay in your spirit man it's got to go to the soul and that's what stabilizes the believer is when it goes down to the soul and you know if I go through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil for thou art with me thou art with me what is it the Unseen has stabilized the soul Hallelujah that's what we're Believing by you don't believe by your mind you believe from the soul brother brandom says the mind H S but he says that the soul believes he he says hope is looking for something but he says faith claims it now and so the mind is hoping to see God but the fa The Faith from the soul is seeing God by a revelation you see this a message in a hope so it's a no so it's a revelation that the Unseen has guided me every step of the way you see not by emotions but by a faith oh I'm an emotional guy man I I love having a good time but you see what happens when the emotions wear off right we still got to be stabilized and you remember Elijah where the brand would talk about Elijah and here Elijah right after the mount carel Showdown what would happen he would go to a cave right and would say God take my life and what is so incredible is what would Elijah say to God he would say they have tore down your altars right they've killed all of your prophets and now I'm the only one that is left you remember Elijah saying that and what would God say I still got 7,000 that has not bow their knee to bail and that was really incredible to me because Elijah's em emotions was saying something contrary than what God was saying oh Hallelujah and if you're going by what you feel your emotions can lead you contrary to the way God looks at a situation oh Elijah was looking at a situation and says it's hopeless but God was looking at a situation and says you're not the only one left I still got 7,000 you see so whenever you feel like you're by yourself look to what God says about it whenever you feel like a situation is impossible what does God say about it well you remember Gideon the Bible says the angel would come to Gideon and would say you're a mighty man of Valor yall remember that and what would Gideon say he says I'm the least in my father's house and my family is poor and I looked up the word Valor one definition of the word Valor means wealthy here come an angel says you're a mighty man of wealth Gideon looks at him and says I am poor he had a change the way that the that change the way he was looking at his situation you've got to change the way you look at the situation and look at yourself the way God looks at you you see God don't look at you as a beggar God looks at you as his bride come on God don't look at you some Cast Away some wan to be you know some some may be so but God looks at you as it's redeemed I shed my blood for you not so that you can be a makeb believer but you can be an unbeliever you got to look at yourself the way God looks at you oh my but it's fear fear likes to take away the the Assurance of what God has given us in this generation you know if you're afraid to take God's word at something you're never going to act upon him you remember brother Brandon would tell the story about the preacher that that would that would take his congregation out front and get a log and would say do you think I could walk across this log and back they would say oh yes the Lord is with you he walk across come back he would get a whe barrel and would say do you think I can push this across come back oh yes the Lord is with you and then he would do it and say do you think I can push a person in this and they says oh yes the Lord is with you he said okay get in they said no and but the brand must say it's different when you're involved in it yourself you see fear makes it impersonal that the message is right but it's not for you that God can heal but he can't heal you that there's going to be a Rapture but it's not for you somebody's got to Cast Away the emotion of fear and see I don't care what you say my soul believes it my soul believes it it don't matter what my emotion says what my affection says what my reasoning says you know brother brandom says there's no reasoning in faith no reasoning in faith and what's so powerful is brother brandom says faith rescues you from your five senses so whenever your five senses don't see God don't feel God don't hear God can't imagine God you know then Faith rescues you and says God is here anyways oh Hallelujah God is here anyways oh my I'll bring this down to a close and brother Brandon would talk about Elisha and his servant Gesa and it's powerful because brother Brandon would say that that Elisha was looking at the Unseen all the time I I'll just read it to you and looking at the Unseen he says because Elijah was was used to walking by faith he was looking at the Unseen all the time he knew that God said in the Psalms the angels of God or aamp about those who fear Him get this that was enough for Elijah and if you look at the story of Elijah he's confident here come Gaza saying we're surround him Elijah Elisha would say there's more with us than with him how did he know that by the word you know you almost think that he's seeing the Angels but brother the Brandon was putting again he didn't see the Angels he knew they were there because he was looking at the Unseen all the time by a promise you see that's how we look at the Unseen you may never see God naturally and we love to feel him right we love to see his Spirit come and work among us but when you don't feel him you still got to be looking at the Unseen you know we've been we've been believing with y'all for our sister our church has been praying for you you say we love it when we're in church and we feel God you know our faith is up high but what about at the Midnight Hour right what about it when it's 2: in the morning and the devil's bombarding our minds what are we going to believe then you see we still got to look at the Unseen by a promise and what is so incredible is here stood a prophet he was already looking at the Unseen but he wasn't just happy with himself looking at it he wanted the young boy to look at it as well and he would say Lord open this boy's eyes and his eyes would come open and would see that there was Chariots of Fire surrounding the mountaintops and sister believe it there are Chariots of Fire every step of the way you ain't walking by yourself you're not fighting by yourself but there's an unseen realm that is surrounding you every step of the way when you don't feel like you can take another step there's an unseen real that is with you that is pressing for you Hallelujah and every one of you that is here tonight you might feel discouraged you might feel low but just know there are angels of fire that are surrounding the building tonight he to encourage here to strengthen you and to lift you up and say you can go on oh Hallelujah and what's incredible Psalms 34:7 the angel of the Lord encampeth around them that fear Him and they were there they were there to deliver oh he knew they weren't just there to watch him they were there to fight and the angels of God ain't just here to watch you suffer they're here to fight for you they're here to press for you they're here to say hey you got this be strengthened be encouraged oh my you remember whenever Elijah was beaten down and he was discouraged but the Brandon would dramatize it and would say hey I need the angel with the softest hands you remember that he would say my my servant down there he's tired he's discouraged I need you to go down there and stroke his brow massage his shoulders and you know the Bible says that when that angel came down he gave him meat to strengthen him and so this Angel would come down with the purpose to encourage him and to strengthen him oh the angels of God that are Camp about you are not just here watching but they're here to fight they're here to strengthen you they're here to encourage you you know remember whenever Daniel Prayed for 21 days right the Bible says that the angel came on the 21st day and says your prayer was answered the first day but I had a fight through the Prince of Persia and what what the Bible say Daniel says he was strengthened by his words so even when he was beat down and low for agonizing and travailing but when his answer broke through it strengthened him you see don't give up you might be travailing you might be pressing don't give up on your answer for when the answer comes it's going to strengthen you oh Hallelujah don't give up on your answered prayer it'll strengthen you it'll comfort you it'll uplift you oh Hallelujah that's what the voice of God does it strengthens you remember whenever Jesus went to jerius jus' house the Bible says he took out all the unbelief right everybody was laughing laughing at him scoffing him the Bible says he put them all out of the house right then he would go and say Maiden arise and what what he why would he say after that he would say give her meat to eat so wherever the voice of God is it's there to strengthen oh Hallelujah give her meat to eat oh my little musicians come tonight wherever the voice of God speaks it's not just it's just just not words it's a strengthening it's the coming strengthen and uplift you and I believe God works through a five-fold Ministry cuz what would Jesus would look to the parents and would said give her meat to eat it wasn't him going and finding meat but now they were working under a commission he's the one that brought her back to life and and we would know that brother that Jesus would say that she's not dead she's asleep she's sleeping right and brother Brandon would tell us that the bride there's an Awakening of the Bride right he would say that that everybody's looking for Revival where's the Revival where's the Revival and brother brandom says they missed the Awakening of the Bride right and so whenever this girl was awaken out of her sleep he would commission a parent and would say strengthen her oh my it was the voice of God that would ring you out of your Slumber out of the denominational Slumber now it's a five-fold Ministry that is strengthening you you remember Lazarus the Bible says that Jesus would come to the tomb of Lazarus and would say I love the Bible puts it he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and whenever Lazarus came out he was still bound hands and foot and what I love about it is the Bible specifies the mouth he was bound hands and foot and there was a napkin about his mouth then Jesus would look and would say loose him and let him go so the same voice the bride that brought him to life and he was asleep right he would say he's not dead he's asleep just like the Awakening of the Bride we wasn't dead he was asleep and then he would commission somebody else to loose him you see that's the power of the fivefold ministry it was the voice of God that brought the brought the bride back to life out of her Slumber but now it's a fivefold ministry under a commission from that same voice every time a message is being preached it's loosening him from a doubt that's loosening him from your unbelief that you can walk in the freedom he was bound hand and foot how could he Rejoice rejoice in his freedom if he was still bound right but he had to be loosed I I say we can be loosed from every complex from every doubt from every unbelief that we can worship God not out of emotion but out of Liberty you see there's a difference in emotional worship and a liberty worship the denominations can worship out of emotion we're worshiping out of Liberty that we once was bound but now we're free I was blind but now I see I was going to hell but now I'm set free it's a liberty that the voice of God has brought us and we're stabilized in it let's stand to our feet tonight and let's bow our heads dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you tonight Lord God thank you for giving us a message
