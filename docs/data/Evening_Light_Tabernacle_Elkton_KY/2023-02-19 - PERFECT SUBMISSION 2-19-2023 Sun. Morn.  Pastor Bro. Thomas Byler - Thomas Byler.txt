foreign [Music] foreign [Music] all right [Music] here the Lord is clean and during forever the judgments upright and I shall be in innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth of my heart accept me O Lord my strength and my redeemer God bless you may be seated brother Brian all right currently and if I'm going to be Ecclesiastes deception after I've tried to just going over some of us by now the courage principle around is fifteen thousand and six hundred dollars and it it's probably a little less than that but I'm asking based on the value and last year alone I've got to like you all do from your we have we paid 79 79 800. nineteen dollars worth principal off the church loan last year and uh right now and we only paid like thirty one hundred dollars worth of Interest last year um also going we're in this new year I was telling brother Steve uh we have about about 200 left on the prepay for the propane and we're probably down to about 35 so I'm gonna have to have them I'll have them refill and that'll be the last time for the for the year until next winter uh like I've told you before all the bills are paid off uh I've been a little bit late on getting I have to turn the paperwork in for see how much they're going to reimburse there's a thousand dollars I figured it out everything that was bought were just shy and having the trim redone right about in this week but going changing my side here you know brother Thomas food was preaching out of Romans 8 last week and what what he God is asking us to do in the age that we live in is to unpack to unpack the things that we've been carrying around our whole life and uh I was just thanking me I don't know if all you know that but we're 40 years 30 years you don't realize how much you accumulate when you go from bigger to smaller how much that God doesn't want holding on to things that we really shouldn't be holding on I really don't use the house as an example because that's a big thing but really you know it's the things you carry on you every day you know the your thoughts your ideas the grudges or the things you've left undone in your life those are the kind of things that you've got to unpack you don't want to be holding on to those as we go you know in a into this New Year well it ain't even a new year anymore but I'll go to a Ecclesiastes seven here and I'll give you all a chance to get there I know I'm quick on the and it says a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day one's birth and that's a principle brother Brown talked about it it's a really important principle you realize that your life is short and the only only thing you're going to carry by calling the grade with me and go to the other side with me there's a lot of things we carry around with us that aren't going to be there on that truth that you possess the character that you've developed that God's developed in you that's the only thing going on the other side everything else you're going to lead you're gonna know who you are I know who I am um just review these verses I already read the first one it is better to go to the house among and then to go to the house of feasting foreign or the man that knows he's got a short time will know that you have no continue we just need to let him go and it says sorrow is better than laughter for by sadness of the continents The Heart Is Made better you know it's a wonderful thing but it's in the valleys and he struggles and your heartaches that you become a better man or a better woman the heart of the lies is in the heart of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of Murphy it is better to hear the rebuke of the wives than for a man to hear the song of fools you know that's the thing you got to be careful of now everyone wants to hear people say nice things about them good things about them but it's better to have a friend that tells you the truth sometimes than it always tells you something that isn't the truth and it goes on for us the Practical and early oppression making the wise man mad and it and a gift destroys the heart better is the end of a thing than in the beginning thereof and the patient is in spirit is better than the proud and spirit be Hasty in thy Spirit to be excuse me I'm not reading be here say say nothing what is the course of the four days were better than these for thou excellently of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that spirit that brother Branham talked about they're talking it was the minute they manifested in three attributes but you don't believe in eternity it's like they're so I've got little feeling that you break something would call me a character you know they're just struck by that but I just it's the spirit of the age that when you either conform and also I was thinking and women actually doing the right thing people are being elected by 30. I'm not gonna I know I say I'm not gonna read a whole chapter I wanted to reading and he's the man's fake my pronunciations of these names is not good Ethel surely I'm more Brutus than amen and have not the understanding of a man and this is what I was thinking it's starting at the fifth or Texas chapter and when he when they mentioned that Shield is hard for us to believe but in their day if you were a footman or an infantry Soldier and you didn't have a good shield and you were in trouble like I remove fall from me vanity lies and that vanity there's things are going good in your life that you don't think anything can go wrong that's van control and well you can be on the hill so well so that's what he's talking about here take the name of God in vain and he's thinks that go and he says a huge night of servant onto his goes on there is a generation oh how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids from off the earth and the needy from among men and I was just thinking that's where it happens myself I know I say that a lot but we speak for myself I see my faults I see my weaknesses I see my strengths oh he sees who you are you know when you get nothing they can do against you it's ever going to change your mind if you're dealing like that with your heavenly father you know sometimes we just take things on Facebook but that's not how a Christian should be a Christian should prove everything they hear doesn't mean that you disrespect the spirit of what's being said you know you just got on that you've been carrying all these years even myself it won't matter all that good Lord with all your heart this morning hey man let's sing that old song if we could this morning oh how I love Jesus this morning if we could love him with all your heart I pray us hey my love to hear

Friday morning went to be with the Lord in his new body going and shaking people's hands everywhere this morning no doubt amen I'll tell you what I was just thinking of if God whatever is wouldn't it amen if we could just ever set transition of that angel being there that other body be in there and going into that new body and so forth amen but we know it's true amen it's just hard for us to conceive it amen but we know that there's a land beyond the river that we call a sweet forever amen and so we certainly miss him and on note at sister Parish uh most of all um this morning our hearts go out to her in a special way since that was her mate amen we know that that's a that's a special kind of pain for somebody to have to suffer amen and so I've heard many things about it and hope well I shouldn't say but hope that I'm I'm the one to go first I'll have to experience it but anyway it's just terrible amen from what I understand he lost his life it was a whole different story you know you don't know what it's really like until you go through it amen so our heart goes out the sister parishes but um we prayed everybody pray amen and if it had been the will of the Lord I believe you to raise him up don't you I really do and so we take it as a will of the Lord for him to have a brand new body this morning but we don't want to have a moment of silence for our brother amen and to remember him amen this morning so let's just buy our hits this morning amen and amen I know Sister parish is watching this morning I don't know how uh and you can be seated for a minute I don't know how well it'll transmit we are certainly looking forward to getting uh the uh fiber Amen to coming through here amen so that we can have really good reception because it is very nice to be able to tune in amen um you know and and to be able to watch uh but I just want to say on her behalf if she's listening amen this morning here amen I learned something from Sister Parish during the time amen having spent quite a few hours up there watching her and so forth the way that she cared about him all the little things she does for him and and I'd appreciate our mate more amen because I'll tell you when you come down to there amen you realize how precious they are to you amen and I believe they ought to be precious to his bad husband and her wife amen and I believe we ought to cherish one another don't you I mean I believe in Ephesians there where we might be reading this morning it says they've got to cherish our wife amen everybody loves him and cherishes it and that's what we ought to do amen I do want to I want to do something that I hadn't done before amen and that is to our election again and everything will remain as it is imprint everybody is happy I certainly believe the Holy Spirit these School teachers and musicians if you would come up at this time and come up front if you know and uh our Sunday school teachers amen this is where you stand up come up front please come up front if you would amen and we just wanna appreciate them this morning amen amen and so I know God has called me to be the pastor y'all have elected me to be the pastor the head amen and so so but we do have a lot of good help so God bless you we appreciate you it's not me man I wonder if everybody would stand up at this time and I want you to do one more and look at my wife back there how many knows she really yeah that's right back and we appreciate her I've been trying small in numbers we needed something if you've seen every one of y'all let me tell y'all I love each and every one of y'all um thank you I don't think there was any announcements or anything else this morning certainly a solemn assembly Lord Jesus where we come together it's sincerity father it is our God that you'll speak to our hearts Lord and that you will have the preeminence in the service keep us into the image God that we're supposed to Lord come and move in the congregation and may we not leave here the same as late upon my heart to speak father and have your way in every portion of it helped me not to get myself in the way or to be carnal in any manner Lord but just to be led by this father we asked these blessings and favors in the name of Jesus Christ amen it's what I have said one time today to speak on it once again amen and I don't know if you've seen it amen on the net we already posted it most of the time we don't get it posted until you're on your way so you probably don't see it but I mean I want to speak on perfect submission amen perfect submission that the prophet of God talked about amen because how many knows there is power in the word of God there's power in God that reads just haven't achieved yet good picture that came to me with all of this in other words you want more of it amen amen no matter how long you've been a Christian to God Amen but it steps on our toes also a little bit and we need that amen ity I know brother Jeremy Lord touched on this here when he was speaking on that Sunday night amen but we want to go down for the husband is the head of the wife even this Christ is the head of the church and is the savior of the body let the wives be to their own husbands in everything amen may God add His blessings you can be seated this morning amen so we it's like a Jose that it's just a little different than our natural relationship means us as headless and him as husband is the Arctic wife because you know a a perfect cousin a lot of times he becomes hard amen but you know the Bible we're going to touch on that everything this morning amen because that everything remember I'm not so much think it says but we're talking about Christ in the church isn't that right that's really where we're going with this is Christ in the church that we're submit to Christ in everything and I want to say this that it is a big battle it is a great every aspect amen now I want to give you if you got an ink pen this is had to listen to about three times and it's uh let me see the the unfailing realities of the Living God 1960 0626. if you want to listen to a message and brother Brandon gets standing is that right and because of that made strong statements and comments about it College I guess it is and and then from what I understand it is uh I haven't got it wrote down here um a descendant I don't know John Wesley one of descended a descendants forth and and more people coming from National Lord or our worldwide Revival again it's gone it's never gonna be what is it I don't know I don't know just what it is ah so I certainly won't make him judgment all of those and I want to read you what he said about him is that okay in perfect strength and perfect weakness he says it this way he says um from our own ability amen our own ability our own ways our own way of thinking and I want to get to it here in a minute we're going to look at what Jesus said about getting away from yourself and how strong Jesus made it and so forth but we'll get into that in a minute nobility I don't care whose it is will ever be usable in the seat you're doing a pretty good job but amen you're never going to be able to be use of God he says how many believe that's the way it is with us Christians and not even it's a fight that we fight every day it's a death we have to die every day foreign now a little bit later he says brother Ann says now forgive me if I get a little ridicul here but I've got to nail this down now notice so he says now it's worse than it was in the beginning it's worse off today than it ever was because that we have tried to do it within human ability they gathered together they gathered and they make long prayers they go out here amen the other day they had a hundred and fifty thousand now let me tell you that's much bigger than the crowds up there 150 000 people that would gather around or something like that gathered to grab both promises make some prayers and so forth he's this that might just as well not have gathered huh they might as well not even have gathered oh mom when you think about it now notice who this is this is God's right-hand man talking this is who God comes down after he preaches like that and backs It Up by zurning thoughts and intents of the heart he was yielded surrendered to God and he knew the truth of the matter didn't he he knew how people really are that whole world is religious huh if you have a Catholic gather and if the pope comes to United States it'll be a hundred and fifty thousand it'll be two hundred feet thousand oh boy that just seemed like Auburn it doesn't mean a thing except maybe they're following the Antichrist so you got to be careful he was talking about them Gathering like that he was talking about one it's not worth nothing instead of God now forgive me if I get critical you can drive the thing down to make it then they'll stick did it do he said nothing it'll never do anything until every person that professes to be a Christian or forget their own ability and heal himself that's why the world is full of today people that just want to go so far amen pretty strong but that's what he said stand God not that first is a killing amen a killing so we can mine you have to die before you can be born again he needs a killing of ourselves this Tabernacle needs a killing and me with it I'm gonna say that this morning this Tabernacle needs a dying and I need to be the one done first to yourself because how many knows that is a scoundrel that is the person it isn't your life it ain't your husband it ain't your enemy it ain't some other person that you fighting to have that gives you the most problems it is yourself that gives you the most problems that's who your greatest enemy is but I can't even make it to church I don't live too far from church but I can't make it on Wednesday night I'm hot I can't rendered to God wants to do the will I got more than anything in the world Jesus Christ was so surrendered to the Holy Spirit to the father until he did not but what his father showed them first and it did nothing but what his father's will was and his will is his word if you want to know what the will of God is read God's Bible it's obvious what the word God is but we want our way we want to do what we want to do but they still want to do what they want to do hey it is today that's exactly the same they want it it wanted to receive it on the level that God brings it that's the only way God has a brain in it and we cannot bring God down to our level of thinking we've got to rise ourselves up to his level of thinking and meet him on the grounds that he has provided for us to meet him on but folks how many who knows that's the way there's a lot of time people need this they want to live just the way they want to live they could be right on living the way that they've always lived yeah be very religious and go to a church and to be a member thereof oh man they're making all Sunday morning or whatever time it is and have about 15 minutes sermon from the pastor and we'll walk no then they'll walk away from there some kind of all right you got a Surrender Your term you got this surrender well our completely surrender surrender when we get in trouble we got technical still under their own way when God tell them they assume believe what they believe that's why the world's in the condition that it's in all right if you're not worried I'm not willing to submit ourselves get this how many knows remember both of the moment amen that she was fun to have a problem is you're so nervous so upset is because you cheated on your husband many years ago she says no you did do it against God you did it against God but that is living there I don't care how I'm gonna have to be there laughs if he ain't going nowhere as long as Sin Lays boards and trustee boards he say talk to a preacher and his deacons and says now look we have so much time he says and by that time you better be done he says I love the preacher the I'd love to preach them actually all day I wouldn't quit so to speak yeah I'd let him know big female talking about a church to dominate over God's preacher what he can't he can't do ain't the worst curse in the world why does the wife have to submit to her husband because whenever he's going to wrote down whenever you get two heads in the house there's some head button going on isn't that right I've never got oh boy until someone might fall over and submits all right only supposed to be one hit that's the way it is with the body of Christ how many beliefs we have a head that it is Christ amen my my when I think about it have a husband for a husband looks for a man she likes to get the most perfect one that you can find first of all don't want to be a Christian you know right Godly and so forth somebody can supply for but let me tell you something whenever you get married to Christ I said he shall supply all your needs according to his riches in Christ Jesus my God shall supply all your needs when you get married to Christ he's gonna take care of you from the right went through you ain't got a word you ain't even got to worry about taking your own thoughts huh oh my thinking thoughts because they're gonna be perfect oh my beautiful eyes had a husband that thought the perfect thing every time you say I mean you do to think okay I just enjoy be with you ever see a woman cuddle up to the man just cuddle all up to him why she's relying on him she loves him she submitted to him it's the way it's supposed to be amen oh my God all right can we go on that's right we got to die to ourselves hey man we need a killing what the world needs is a killing what people in the message need is to die in to their self I say if you're never gonna advice you're gonna have to die yourself and to your ways more it can't be your way and his way notice brother bam says in the same message when he comes in his power of his resurrection to make people live and act and to behave themselves to change their attitude to change their ways people don't want to change their ways you're gonna hear that you better do you need to change your ways because that's what God's going to have you to do that's what the resurrection powered us might come to church as you are and stayed as you are that is a lie Straight From the Bottom scraping the barrel of hell come on folks they've always lived and yet be very religious all right that now the holy spirit will not misbehave itself when one person another it'll make each person come into its character because it's a spirit that leads you it makes any Christian wants to try this your body completely submitted to God you will is out folks amen what we really need are young people you have got to follow Wednesday man this is me something to enjoy to do that you love to do you don't get that you're in trouble he loved to give up the things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in it cleanses you and it puts your desire how wonderful it is to be Christ and to be smitted is that you
