[0:14] and he said well I want you to
[0:16] think
[0:18] and he said I want everybody in the room
[0:20] to turn their backs nothing bad's gonna
[0:22] happen
[0:24] girl just a vampire and he said do you
[0:27] see that bracelet on that chandelier he
[0:28] said if you have faith make that
[0:31] bracelet go left and right and circle
[0:34] and stuff
[0:36] and she said that spirituality brother
[0:38] Brown that can't be done
[0:41] he said you don't have faith
[0:54] amen I want my faith to be built up I
[0:57] want to have more of that possible and
[0:59] attitude that positive faith that he
[1:01] says faith is positive so I gotta get
[1:04] all the negative out of my life
[1:07] and see positive results
[1:10] Glory
[1:12] Hercules sometimes phenomenal happen in
[1:15] my life and my sixth grade year
[1:20] I'm terrible at times the dates I'll do
[1:23] the best I can but something phenomenal
[1:26] matter this is when I first saw my wife
[1:31] all right
[1:37] I knew that would give a shot sorry and
[1:40] you're going to say this is
[1:42] we were at a ball game
[1:44] remember like it was yesterday
[1:48] I was in the staff she was on the court
[1:50] playing ball she was playing for
[1:51] Cleveland days I was a help to know we
[1:54] won't talk about the traveling violation
[1:56] that ones that hang from 50 Blue Jays at
[1:59] the end of the game
[2:05] but I was sitting there at the top of
[2:08] the bleachers I could go to the spot
[2:09] today saw her on the court my best
[2:12] friend was sitting beside me and I said
[2:14] I wonder who that is he said who I said
[2:16] that girl right there that's my cousin I
[2:20] said I'm being married
[2:22] sixth grade
[2:24] he's like well let's just
[2:25] puppy love and we see you know no no
[2:29] there was something that I really knew
[2:30] there was something I mean we had
[2:33] cancer whatever you know but now that
[2:35] was something I said I want to marry her
[2:38] from my uncle Billy
[2:41] [Applause]
[2:47] so time goes on never say her again
[2:50] until maybe a year or two later when the
[2:52] schools consolidate that like I said I
[2:54] think it was a year
[2:55] I walk in and I'll see you again
[2:58] there she is that's that's her
[3:03] that's the one I saw at the game
[3:08] so I couldn't listen
[3:10] you got six seven eight great boys are
[3:14] but I guess I got her attention
[3:16] and we started liking each other who
[3:18] started you know boyfriend girlfriend
[3:20] whatever
[3:20] [Music]
[3:26] but it was it was one of those things
[3:28] that it was a middle school thing you
[3:31] know
[3:32] we get out of school summer break
[3:34] whatever and we go on our own ways and
[3:36] and things are you know she does her
[3:38] thing and I think mine we're setting
[3:39] right away
[3:43] until about sophomore year
[3:47] we have class together another kind of
[3:49] connection there
[3:51] and I'm sitting there
[3:54] and I promise this is the way it went
[3:58] all right
[4:01] [Music]
[4:03] again
[4:05] [Music]
[4:23] it's gonna work out after all
[4:27] so we go along we go home and we go on
[4:30] this and we begin today you know the
[4:32] story it's the fairy tale right
[4:34] and
[4:37] things are going good about that time
[4:40] then I started coming to church here
[4:42] and so I started coming to church here
[4:44] and uh when I was 16
[4:47] I think it was really about
[4:49] five dollars per Seer here he's just
[4:52] been elected or selected him
[4:53] and to take the church and so I'm
[4:56] getting there and I start coming to
[4:57] church here and uh
[5:00] and I know this was something completely
[5:01] different than any Services I would have
[5:03] been to
[5:04] but I know it was something different
[5:05] that I liked
[5:07] I think there's something different that
[5:08] made it more more realistic to me
[5:13] [Music]
[5:15] kind of regardless and so I began to
[5:18] read my Bible and I began to go through
[5:20] it and Things become clearer
[5:22] first thing I can remember that stood
[5:24] out to me is like this is an operator
[5:28] because for years I've wondered about
[5:30] the
[5:31] what happened in the garden about an
[5:32] apple what does that have to do with any
[5:34] sin
[5:36] and then when I say in the services I'm
[5:38] like well this people might think this
[5:42] is crazy but an Apple's even more crazy
[5:45] baptism
[5:53] can't make sense
[5:55] father son I don't want to go it's a
[5:57] three year one father's title
[6:00] you know the story you know how it is
[6:02] that's how I began to say this is this
[6:05] is what I'm hoping for
[6:06] and so there are long about that time uh
[6:09] brother Daniel Williams comes in
[6:10] business
[6:12] precious preciousness
[6:15] a person
[6:16] and it makes you feel appreciative
[6:22] and the next thing you know I'm going to
[6:24] be re-baptized I was baptized in my
[6:26] Christian church but now I say
[6:31] baptized in Jesus name
[6:34] and so I keep between myself I need to
[6:36] be baptized
[6:37] so we pulled the tarp off and brother
[6:39] Brian sister genetics
[6:42] and they had to talk because it was cold
[6:46] brother Williams baptized me there
[6:51] and then as time went on there was a
[6:54] little move on my stuff so our little
[6:56] young group here
[6:57] brother Billy sister Nancy my
[6:59] mother-in-law father-in-law mother
[7:03] camps or churches and
[7:06] next thing you know let them bought a
[7:08] tour bus
[7:10] that belong to Confederate railroads
[7:18] and we
[7:19] got us John drove his little land
[7:22] Minefield and some army base about Lewis
[7:25] on the road two o'clock in the morning
[7:31] field
[7:34] we've been driving two of us and we've
[7:36] got these meetings and these meetings
[7:40] start to really impact my life I
[7:41] remember going to Dyersburg
[7:44] erase
[7:46] wrestling The Thrillers one of my
[7:48] favorite messages ever and I stepped out
[7:51] on the set somewhere other than a way to
[7:52] play them but I still got them on the
[7:54] set and I remember going to Louisiana
[7:58] Camp brother Bissell preacher ye shall
[8:01] see the resurrection
[8:03] now he preached that
[8:06] something would not let my feet in my
[8:09] middle space
[8:11] let's see
[8:13] I didn't care if Joyce went whoever was
[8:17] sorry it didn't matter I was going to
[8:20] the front of the church on the mission
[8:23] I had to get up there and and just go
[8:26] through that prayer line because enjoy
[8:28] your life people impacted people you
[8:30] know people you don't even think about
[8:32] and what they're doing at the time you
[8:34] realize how it impacts your life but I
[8:36] can remember at the time that we were
[8:38] dating
[8:40] when we were dating
[8:42] we'd be sitting in the living room
[8:44] nearly a man's a day third bedroom was
[8:46] right on the other side of the wall
[8:48] that's where they slept at the time
[8:55] and I thought wow
[8:57] crazy
[9:05] for me
[9:07] amen
[9:08] let everybody knows around huh
[9:16] you know but not least
[9:21] that atmosphere to God and saying God
[9:24] you take control of it yes that's right
[9:29] so along without 18
[9:36] so with love
[9:38] a good way to get married and we got
[9:41] engaged and got married at 19. just
[9:44] remember now I told you that I was
[9:46] taught that I could believe I believe
[9:47] that I could have anything I want to do
[9:49] so I decided if we're going to build a
[9:50] long house
[9:52] 18 years old
[9:54] doing something that nobody in the
[9:56] county had ever done the way we're doing
[9:58] it the banker told me that he said are
[9:59] you sure
[10:00] what about this
[10:02] yeah like a little bit
[10:05] so we sprayed the laws and we scraped
[10:07] the laws got the bark off of them her
[10:09] daddy song for us they said you gotta
[10:11] have a place to live
[10:12] so we did that
