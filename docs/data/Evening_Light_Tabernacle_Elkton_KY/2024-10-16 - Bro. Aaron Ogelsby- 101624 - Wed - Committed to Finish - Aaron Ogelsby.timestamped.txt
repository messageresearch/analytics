[0:37] amen good to be in the house of the Lord
[0:41] tonight looking at Mrs Jesus Christ
[0:43] you're a pretty sight amen so I just
[0:47] wanted to don't want to take much time
[0:48] we started a little early but don't want
[0:50] to take time from the preaching tonight
[0:52] and uh give brother Aaron plenty of time
[0:54] but I do want to give a quick update of
[0:56] where we're at this week and our efforts
[0:58] with uh with Word of Life church and
[1:01] being able to uh take goods and
[1:02] distribute up there so it's been a good
[1:05] week I tell you the Lord has just it
[1:07] never ceases to amaze me just the the
[1:10] power and and the good um and uh so then
[1:14] we we decided the Lord laid it on
[1:16] brother John's heart to uh kind of get a
[1:18] generator drive going because it's a
[1:20] it's a it's a life or death situation
[1:23] you might as well say that I heard that
[1:25] one uh perished last night because of
[1:27] the cold weather and that's just sister
[1:29] Becky had had told us that and through
[1:32] brother Barry coffee is that right so
[1:34] you know it's a it's a real situation up
[1:36] there the snow fell last night ice fell
[1:38] in the mountains they need electricity
[1:40] they need heat um so we prayed about it
[1:43] and you know I think when me and brother
[1:45] John got started and and uh we talked
[1:47] about it initially we were thinking well
[1:49] surely we can get 20 or 20 or 30 or
[1:51] something like that and that's kind of
[1:52] where we started wasn't it John and next
[1:55] thing you know he said well why don't we
[1:56] just say we'll get 40 well this week
[1:59] I'll tell you the Lord has given us 40
[2:07] generators but that's that he didn't
[2:10] stop there that was our goal he said I
[2:13] think you need 50 so he gave us
[2:17] 50
[2:18] yeah and he didn't stop there he said I
[2:22] think you need one to grow on ain't that
[2:23] right brother John we got 51 we bought
[2:26] 50 somebody 52 somebody donated to the
[2:30] church was able to get enough contacts
[2:32] and funds to get 50 so we're next week
[2:35] good Lord willing pray that they will
[2:37] all get ship to the location where we
[2:39] can pick them up in Bowling Green uh
[2:42] good Lord willing brother John is going
[2:43] to make arrangements to take them
