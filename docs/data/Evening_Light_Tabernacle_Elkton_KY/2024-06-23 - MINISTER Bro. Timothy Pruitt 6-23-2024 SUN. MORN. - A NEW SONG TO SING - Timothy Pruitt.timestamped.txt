[10:19] amen I've been been just thinking a
[10:22] little bit amen and I thought about how
[10:24] good it is to have friends amen you know
[10:29] I was sitting back there and I thought
[10:30] about brother brandom and how when he
[10:32] got up he'd always say good morning
[10:36] friends amen you know we just weren't
[10:39] made to be Hermits is that right we were
[10:42] made to be socialable people and to have
[10:44] brothers and sisters and to be around
[10:46] other people amen and I was just
[10:49] thinking how uh I'm not sure I was back
[10:52] there thinking of who said it I don't
[10:54] know we've had a minister here not so
[10:55] long ago and I know I had said it just
[10:57] before that but amen and what we have
[11:01] here is very special amen how many
[11:03] believe that having brothers and sisters
[11:06] having friends amen that love one
[11:09] another
[11:10] amen and cherish one another amen
[11:14] because there's so much so much things
[11:16] that can come between people ain't that
[11:19] right amen and so when you have things
[11:21] clear between people and you've got
[11:23] friends and amen and everything it's
[11:25] just very special so amen and I pray
[11:28] that today how many believes this is a
[11:29] special service this morning amen amen
[11:32] we come to church all the time go to
[11:34] church all the time brother Jeremy don't
[11:36] we but let's believe that this morning
[11:38] service is going to be a little bit
[11:40] different amen and and I was thinking of
[11:44] praying back there I said Lord Jesus I
[11:46] just want you to come in a special way
[11:48] today amen we want to especially invite
[11:52] him especially this morning amen you
[11:54] know we always invite him but just
[11:56] especially invite him amen and we're
[11:58] honored to have brother Timothy puit we
[12:00] deem him to be a great man amen and his
[12:03] wife sister Ruth with us this morning so
[12:05] we're honored to have them amen and we
[12:07] appreciate that you know but we
[12:09] certainly know that uh what makes the
[12:12] difference in the service is the holy
[12:14] spirit it's Jesus Christ Among Us amen
[12:18] is what really makes a difference and
[12:19] that's what we run a really pull so amen
[12:23] I just want to say that to try to get
[12:25] everybody to pull into the right gear
[12:28] amen the gear of pulling on Jesus amen
[12:31] and and welcoming him amen and so that
[12:35] the holy spirit will have Liberty this
[12:37] morning Amen to do what he always does
[12:40] ain't that right set the captives free
[12:43] forgive sins deliver sicknesses whatever
[12:47] it might be because God does so many
[12:49] things because he's such a wonderful God
[12:52] so we're looking for a good time in God
[12:54] today and the Lord Jesus amen and we
[12:56] certainly don't want to be in a hurry
[12:58] amen and we don't want to get weary no
[13:00] matter how long brother Tim would go

[13:05] don't know maybe 3:00 we'll be here yet

[13:09] know we just expect God to come in a
[13:11] special way don't we amen and so we just

[1:01:44] times cause us to move aside or cause us
[1:01:48] to get off the path but Lord we just

[1:02:30] and different ones amen amen God bless
[1:02:34] you today we're we're just glad to be in
[1:02:36] the same battle together on the same
[1:02:39] side amen fighting the same enemy I I
[1:02:42] think it's a it's a great Revelation
[1:02:44] when we realize our enemy is not our
[1:02:46] brother our enemy is the devil amen and
[1:02:49] even you can take it even further than
[1:02:51] that brother brandham said our greatest
[1:02:52] enemy is
[1:02:53] ourself amen and so he realiz realize
[1:02:56] that sometimes it'll help us along the
[1:02:57] way when we realize what is going on in
[1:03:00] our lives I I just had this thought on
[1:03:02] my heart and I couldn't get away from it
[1:03:04] uh preest that's here some time ago at
[1:03:07] home and a couple other places but it's
[1:03:10] something that's very dear to my heart
[1:03:12] because it's actually something the Lord
[1:03:13] would speak to me as I would sit there
[1:03:16] on the second row of the pew at my
[1:03:18] mother's um when she passed away at my
[1:03:21] mother's funeral her memorial service
[1:03:24] and he would speak these words to my
[1:03:26] heart because you know it was a time of
[1:03:27] grieving a time of of going through
[1:03:31] those say of losing your mom was not an
[1:03:32] easy thing to do and we thank you for
[1:03:34] every prayer that you prayed for that
[1:03:37] but you know uh as I was sitting there
[1:03:39] the Lord began to deal with my heart and
[1:03:41] he said you spoke these words to me that
[1:03:44] you won't always sing this song but I'm
[1:03:46] going to give you a new song to sing and
[1:03:49] I I got to thinking about actually wrote
[1:03:51] it down there as I as I was sitting
[1:03:53] there on the Pew because I just thought
[1:03:55] wow you know what does this mean and
[1:03:57] begin to study on a new song to sing and
[1:03:59] that's like that's what I'd like to
[1:04:01] preach preach to you today because you
[1:04:03] know we go through a lot of things in
[1:04:05] our lives and we go through a lot of
[1:04:07] difficulties and this life is full of
[1:04:09] difficulties someone said it like this
[1:04:11] he said if you're not in a trial you're
[1:04:13] either just come out of a trial or
[1:04:15] you're in a trial or you're about to go
[1:04:17] into another trial you know we that's
[1:04:19] just the world that we live in the
[1:04:21] things that we go through and we're all
[1:04:24] we're not any of us exempt from that
[1:04:26] every one of us has trials in our lives
[1:04:28] now I may go through things different
[1:04:30] than what you go through and you may go
[1:04:32] through and I may look at what you go
[1:04:34] through is not something very hard that
[1:04:35] would bother me but to you it's a great
[1:04:38] thing and vice versa but we all go
[1:04:40] through great things and you know it's
[1:04:42] in those moments of life that when
[1:04:44] testing where we really show who we
[1:04:47] really are that you know and I thought
[1:04:49] it was something as I was reading the
[1:04:51] scripture on Isaiah as he would begin to
[1:04:53] talk about give poting the them that
[1:04:56] mourn and Zion to giv them Beauty for
[1:04:58] Ashes and the oil of joy for mourning
[1:05:00] and the Garment of Praise for the spirit
[1:05:03] of heav I I thought that was something
[1:05:05] that he tied praise and a garment
[1:05:07] together that he would he would describe
[1:05:10] praise as a garment and I think about a
[1:05:12] garment now today when you came to
[1:05:14] church you chose to put on a certain
[1:05:16] garment you chose to put on a certain
[1:05:18] dress or a certain suit certain shirt it
[1:05:21] was a garment that you had to put on you
[1:05:23] didn't matter how much you would have
[1:05:25] begged or pleaded for it or whatever to
[1:05:27] come out of the closet you had to take
[1:05:29] it and take it and apply it to your life
[1:05:32] and I I and I think that's something
[1:05:33] that Praises also that way because it's
[1:05:36] in The Valleys of of hardships that you
[1:05:39] have to choose to praise God you don't
[1:05:41] always feel like she praising him we
[1:05:43] don't always feel like lifting our hands
[1:05:46] and lifting our voices and and praising
[1:05:48] God but amen we have to choose to put
[1:05:51] that Garment of Praise now it's easy
[1:05:53] when we're on top of the mountain you
[1:05:55] know to shout out the Praises of God and
[1:05:57] and glory to God hallelujah but it's
[1:05:59] down in those valleys that we get into
[1:06:01] many times that's when True Praise comes
[1:06:04] out that's when we can look beyond all
[1:06:07] of our hurts and all of the things
[1:06:08] that's went wrong and all the situations
[1:06:11] around us and lift up our hands and
[1:06:13] still praise the Lord you know I I I
[1:06:16] think that's something that we can learn
[1:06:17] from in the scriptures we would look to
[1:06:20] SEC or to Samuel 30 and verse one it
[1:06:23] talks about D when he came to zigg and
[1:06:26] you know and the malachit had invaded
[1:06:28] and zigg was smitten and burned with
[1:06:30] fire and they had taken the women capes
[1:06:32] and and they were you know there were
[1:06:34] not any left great or small the
[1:06:36] scripture says and David and his men
[1:06:38] came to the city and it was they found
[1:06:40] it in this condition they found their
[1:06:42] wives taken they found their sons taken
[1:06:44] they found their daughters taken and
[1:06:46] David and the people that were with him
[1:06:48] lifted up their voices and wept until
[1:06:51] they had no more power to weep amen how
[1:06:53] many's ever been to that place You' I
[1:06:55] don't have any tears cry I I've been
[1:06:58] through a lot in my life and and things
[1:07:00] are so bad and things are so down and
[1:07:02] you know David's wives were taken and
[1:07:04] the scripture says David was greatly
[1:07:07] distressed for people spake of stoning
[1:07:10] him his own people his own ones that
[1:07:13] supposed to be around him encourage him
[1:07:15] they begin to turn on him and begin to
[1:07:17] talk about stoning him and and and and
[1:07:19] and to try to kill him it wasn't it
[1:07:21] wasn't something of a you know Stone and
[1:07:23] wasn't a massage it was somebody trying
[1:07:25] to kill you amen and so they were trying
[1:07:28] to kill them every because the soul of
[1:07:30] all the people was grieved and so David
[1:07:33] had a choice and David's the scripture
[1:07:35] said David encouraged himself in the
[1:07:38] Lord his God Amen he encouraged himself
[1:07:41] in the Lord is God he said bring forth
[1:07:43] the ephod and he brought it forth and
[1:07:46] David inquired the Lord saying shall I
[1:07:49] pursue after this troop shall I overtake
[1:07:51] them and he answered pursue for Thou
[1:07:54] shalt surely over take them and without
[1:07:57] fail recover all Amen brother Bram talks
[1:07:59] about he said many are becoming
[1:08:01] discouraged he said you know when we
[1:08:03] become discouraged it takes our strength
[1:08:06] from us we we want to give up we Satan
[1:08:08] likes to pull us away and we begin to
[1:08:11] think nobody else cares and nobody else
[1:08:13] understands and you know and somebody
[1:08:15] breaks our trust and we feel like we
[1:08:17] can't trust anyone anymore but we need
[1:08:19] each other amen we need each one each
[1:08:22] one around us you need the one that's
[1:08:24] next to you
[1:08:26] we need our brothers and sisters he said
[1:08:28] but we need what we need brother is not
[1:08:31] be discouraged but take courage we need
[1:08:34] to be encouraged trials may come we were
[1:08:37] never promised to be immune from them
[1:08:39] but he will give us the grace to go
[1:08:41] through them he said if the mountain is
[1:08:43] too high or too valleys too deep or too
[1:08:46] wide he'll give you enough Grace to go
[1:08:49] through it amen just don't worry but
[1:08:52] keep your eyes on Christ for he's the
[1:08:54] only one that can take you through he's
[1:08:57] the only one but if you notice it's when
[1:08:59] you're discouraged that's when the devil
[1:09:01] tries to pour it on
[1:09:03] you amen that's when he tries to pour it
[1:09:05] on you when he gets you if you can come
[1:09:07] to church and say well I don't know I I
[1:09:09] don't know if I'll ever get better or
[1:09:11] not I I've been prayed for I don't know
[1:09:13] if I've got any friends I I don't know
[1:09:15] if anyone cares see the devil is trying
[1:09:18] to pour it on you but see he said God
[1:09:21] doesn't want you frowning he wants you
[1:09:23] to be happy
[1:09:26] thank you amen God doesn't want you
[1:09:30] frowning he wants you to be
[1:09:33] happy amen turn to your neighbor and say
[1:09:35] I'm happy all right amen he wants you to
[1:09:38] be happy the human heart was made to be
[1:09:42] happy worry will cause cancer is quotes
[1:09:46] worry will cause cancer temper will
[1:09:48] cause cancer don't ever be
[1:09:51] upset Mercy Jesus amen don't ever be
[1:09:55] upset said just walk in his love knowing
[1:09:57] that while you're walking with him
[1:10:00] nothing can harm
[1:10:02] you nothing can harm you everything is
[1:10:06] working for your
[1:10:08] good it doesn't look like it it doesn't
[1:10:11] feel like it it feels all hell is
[1:10:13] against me but everything is working for
[1:10:16] my good that's what the scripture says
[1:10:20] you know I I I'll say this I've told
[1:10:22] this story a lot and it's a good
[1:10:23] illustration because it it brings this
[1:10:26] point home I saw this cartoon one time
[1:10:28] of this dorky looking lamb you know
[1:10:30] walking on his back back legs and and
[1:10:32] he's he's uh you know holding holding
[1:10:35] Jesus's hand you know it's just a
[1:10:36] cartoon and over in the ditch is this
[1:10:38] old roaring line and he's he's coming
[1:10:40] out trying to act like he's going to do
[1:10:42] something the Sheep just looking at him
[1:10:43] with a kind of bewildered face like what
[1:10:45] are you doing dummy I'm with
[1:10:49] him
[1:10:51] amen amen it's time you let the devil
[1:10:54] know who you're with
[1:10:56] amen you're not in this battle alone
[1:10:58] you're not by yourself but if God be for
[1:11:01] you who can be against you God is on
[1:11:05] your
[1:11:08] side amen nothing can harm you there's
[1:11:11] neither Powers thing present things
[1:11:13] future that can separate you from him we
[1:11:16] are in him we never came by our own will
[1:11:19] but God chose you and he brought you to
[1:11:23] the place you are and if he brought you
[1:11:26] here it's his business to take care of
[1:11:30] you God Have Mercy In other words God
[1:11:33] has made you his business what he thinks
[1:11:38] about what he cares about what his his
[1:11:40] thoughts are upon and the scripture said
[1:11:42] his thoughts are higher than our
[1:11:44] thoughts his ways are greater than our
[1:11:46] ways amen when we think we got a away
[1:11:49] we're just messing up but if we can just
[1:11:51] get in God's way God's Will and God's
[1:11:54] thoughts and what he wants out of our
[1:11:56] lives and then God can come down and
[1:11:59] move Upon Our
[1:12:02] Lives so it's his business to take care
[1:12:05] of what he took to himself he said no
[1:12:08] man can pluck from me from my father's
[1:12:10] hand because he's the greatest of them
[1:12:12] all the father who takes care of you in
[1:12:15] other words who's got more power than
[1:12:17] God what kind of power have you got

[1:12:32] his place he's watching over you that's
[1:12:34] the kind of father we

[1:14:29] through and he's there for us in those
[1:14:31] moments I'm going just going to stop
[1:14:33] here for a moment because I I I I got to
[1:14:36] tell you a little testimony of mine I
[1:14:38] was actually at brother Ron Spencer
[1:14:40] ministering sometime ago and and U I
[1:14:43] actually was before my mother's passing
[1:14:45] right just month about a month before
[1:14:47] she passed and I I was looking for
[1:14:49] answers because you know I I preach I
[1:14:53] preach Faith until the day she died and
[1:14:56] I preached it since she's died cuz Faith
[1:14:59] took her to where her faith took her to
[1:15:01] where she's at amen God knows amen as
[1:15:05] brother Bram said he said if I prayed
[1:15:06] for a thousand today and a thousand of
[1:15:08] them died I'll pray for a thousand of
[1:15:10] them tomorrow cuz I know God's word
[1:15:12] still the same that does not change
[1:15:14] anything but you know I was looking for
[1:15:16] answers and wondering God how how are
[1:15:18] you going to work this out and I'm
[1:15:20] watching her go down and down and and
[1:15:22] I'm I'm I'm just looking for a Miracles
[1:15:24] what I was looking for and I was
[1:15:26] actually at brother Ron Spencer and I
[1:15:28] was preaching on a god a God who answers
[1:15:31] and brother Brown talks about that he
[1:15:32] says go God always answers he said many
[1:15:35] times it's in an unexpected way in
[1:15:37] unexpected place at an unexpected time
[1:15:39] but he always answered he said but the
[1:15:41] thing of it is you got to recognize it's
[1:15:43] God when he
[1:15:45] does cuz sometimes it don't come like we
[1:15:48] think God's going to answer you know we
[1:15:50] think it's going to go Bloom and
[1:15:52] Thunders are going to take for and all
[1:15:53] kind of voice Timothy my servant that
[1:15:56] ain't always God
[1:15:58] does he don't always work like that but
[1:16:02] sometimes he can use a
[1:16:04] donkey got Bible for it he can use all
[1:16:08] kinds of things but you got to recognize
[1:16:11] this is
[1:16:13] God and here I'm preaching on this and I
[1:16:16] I coming down to the end of it and I
[1:16:18] actually walk around in front of brother
[1:16:19] Ron's uh pull pit and my iPad I was
[1:16:22] using went black and and cuz it shut off
[1:16:24] because I'd been away from it for a
[1:16:26] while and and and I didn't have that
[1:16:28] time a watch that would operate it or
[1:16:30] anything like that and so here I am
[1:16:32] preaching and I began to talk about the
[1:16:33] three Hebrew children how they was
[1:16:35] coming to this fire and they was getting
[1:16:37] ready to be burned and they said go
[1:16:39] ahead King do whatever you want to do
[1:16:40] but we're not going to bend or we're not
[1:16:42] going to bow to your image and and he
[1:16:44] heated it up seven times hotter and I
[1:16:46] and I begin to talk about that and I
[1:16:48] said and I began to talk about brother
[1:16:49] brandom Illustrated about how God was in
[1:16:51] heaven and the angel said hey have you
[1:16:53] been watching what's going on on Earth
[1:16:55] he said yeah I've been watching and the
[1:16:57] wormwood said well let me go and I'll
[1:16:59] send a flood and this one said let me go
[1:17:01] and I'll take a sword I I'll destroy the
[1:17:03] kingdom he said no this ain't a job for
[1:17:05] you Angels but I'm going to go
[1:17:08] [Applause]
[1:17:09] [Music]
[1:17:11] myself and I said I said brother brand
[1:17:14] talked about how he grabbed a lightning
[1:17:15] and a zigzag of light and a roll and he
[1:17:17] went right down into the fire and he
[1:17:20] came down to where they
[1:17:23] was now this is the hon gospel truth
[1:17:25] brother Ron sitting behind he saw my
[1:17:28] iPad flash on he saw it go through the
[1:17:30] apps he saw it choose a tape and he saw
[1:17:33] it push
[1:17:34] play how it did it had to be had to be
[1:17:37] God's all I can tell you amen cuz I'm
[1:17:39] sure the devil didn't put the prophet's
[1:17:41] voice
[1:17:42] on all of a sudden I heard the prophet's
[1:17:45] voice and he began to speak about and he
[1:17:47] says that's the favorite of the hymns he
[1:17:49] said he said because it describes the
[1:17:53] extreme de to the Lord Jesus Jesus
[1:17:55] Christ especially in the day we live in
[1:17:57] he said everybody else wants to make him
[1:17:59] just a man but he was more than a man
[1:18:02] he's
[1:18:03] God and he got talking about booth cber
[1:18:06] and how he wrote and how was his
[1:18:08] favorite I didn't catch it in the moment
[1:18:11] it wasn't until I got to back to the
[1:18:12] office what had happened but you know
[1:18:14] what that song was it was down from his
[1:18:17] glory ever living story my God and
[1:18:21] savior came and Jesus was his name and
[1:18:24] right as I am talking about he has come
[1:18:26] down into the fire the voice of the
[1:18:28] Prophet begins to describe it
[1:18:34] exactly come on somebody now here's how
[1:18:38] I thought I thought when my mom was
[1:18:40] healed I thought it's over with I mean
[1:18:42] my God how can he do anything more
[1:18:44] Supernatural than that she's it's over
[1:18:46] with and I watched her go right down
[1:18:49] right down right down till we put her in
[1:18:50] a
[1:18:51] grave and I'm sitting there on that
[1:18:53] second pew
[1:18:56] and he says I'm going to give you a new
[1:18:58] song to
[1:18:59] sing and I said Lord well what about her
[1:19:03] you said you was going to be in the fire
[1:19:05] he said I didn't come down for her I
[1:19:08] come down for
[1:19:10] you he said she's
[1:19:13] okay he said but I come to show you that
[1:19:16] I'm in the fire with you
[1:19:27] let me tell you how real this was I
[1:19:29] would leave there and I would go home
[1:19:30] and she would go into the hospital and
[1:19:32] she wouldn't come out she would go next
[1:19:34] time next time she would come out we
[1:19:36] would put her in the grave but you know
[1:19:38] I would went to that hospital room she
[1:19:39] hadn't talked in about 17 18 hours
[1:19:42] brother Tom she hadn't said a word
[1:19:43] wouldn't talk to nobody and because she'
[1:19:46] had those brain aneurysms and things and
[1:19:47] it messed her her cognitive skills up
[1:19:50] and she couldn't she couldn't put words
[1:19:51] in her mouth she couldn't do anything
[1:19:53] seemed like she just sat there and me
[1:19:55] and my dad walked into the ICU room
[1:19:57] began to talk to her and we have about
[1:19:59] an hour drive to that hospital so he
[1:20:01] slipped after we talked to the doctor
[1:20:03] the doctor went out and dad said I need
[1:20:05] to slip into the restroom and I couldn't
[1:20:06] wait because at this time I'm thinking
[1:20:08] God's going to heal her and I I I really
[1:20:10] believe
[1:20:12] that but he didn't brother Timothy well
[1:20:14] I don't change nothing God's still a
[1:20:17] Healer I'm not telling you this because
[1:20:19] it caused me to disbelieve him anymore I
[1:20:22] believe him more today than I ever
[1:20:23] believed him
[1:20:26] but I I be I looked at her I said Mom I
[1:20:28] got to come I want to tell you something
[1:20:30] he's come down to be in the fire with us

[1:21:35] himself David returned to zigg and he
[1:21:38] find it all burnt
[1:21:40] discouraged is not enough not a good
[1:21:42] enough word to describe how he really
[1:21:45] felt Bible says as we said he wept
[1:21:48] bitter tear tears until they simply had
[1:21:50] no more power to weep for David you know
[1:21:54] it was worse he was the leader everybody
[1:21:56] looked at
[1:21:57] him and and they were consumed by grief
[1:22:00] and and there they begin to talk of
[1:22:03] stoning him and he was in
[1:22:06] distress it might have destroyed him
[1:22:08] completely except for
[1:22:11] this David encouraged himself in the
[1:22:14] Lord his
[1:22:16] God you won't ever encourage yourself in
[1:22:21] yourself you have to turn to something
[1:22:24] that's un
[1:22:26] unmovable cuz our feelings will always
[1:22:29] will always cause us more difficulties
[1:22:32] in our lives if we depend on our
[1:22:34] feelings because you don't always feel
[1:22:36] up here you don't always feel excited
[1:22:39] you don't always feel amen happy you
[1:22:41] don't always feel that we all have
[1:22:43] moments of
[1:22:44] discouragement some greater than others
[1:22:46] some longer than others some go through
[1:22:48] those valleys seem like for a long time
[1:22:50] but I'm telling you there is an end to
[1:22:52] that Valley but the end is is you turn
[1:22:55] away from what you see and you turn back
[1:22:57] to your
[1:23:00] God Amen he had a decision to make will
[1:23:03] he go deeper into the distress and
[1:23:05] deeper into the depression will he worry
[1:23:07] and allow it to make him more helpless
[1:23:10] or would he make a conscious decision
[1:23:12] I'm going to turn my eyes to the heels
[1:23:15] which cometh my help cuz my help does
[1:23:19] not come from me my Help Cometh From The
[1:23:21] Lord
[1:23:25] my help doesn't even come necessarily
[1:23:27] from those that are around me yes we
[1:23:29] need each other I'm not telling we need
[1:23:31] each other we need preachers we need
[1:23:33] people in the pews we need musicians we
[1:23:35] need
[1:23:37] everybody but our real Help Cometh From
[1:23:40] The
[1:23:45] Lord so David chose encouragement not
[1:23:48] only be encouraged but there was no one
[1:23:50] around who could or who would do that
[1:23:53] for him but he
[1:23:54] encouraged
[1:23:57] himself and I just tell you nobody cares
[1:23:59] what Jesus
[1:24:01] cares that's the first thing I want to
[1:24:03] ask people when they walk away from a
[1:24:05] church well this one hurt me that one
[1:24:06] hurt me this one did wrong well what did
[1:24:08] Jesus
[1:24:12] do we find out that our motives and
[1:24:14] objectives was really wrong for even
[1:24:16] coming to church it wasn't about Jesus
[1:24:18] anyhow was about our feelings about how
[1:24:20] we felt about if everything was perfect
[1:24:23] and right you know it
[1:24:25] help us Jesus how we get here but anyway
[1:24:27] we get in those
[1:24:31] places but the most important thing to
[1:24:33] notice is David did not encourage
[1:24:35] himself in himself but scripture said he
[1:24:38] encouraged himself in the Lord his God
[1:24:41] you see it was not about David for David
[1:24:43] had a covenant of God With God so this
[1:24:46] what David was going through that covant
[1:24:49] made it God's
[1:24:51] business and David's not the only one
[1:24:53] under a covenant but there's also
[1:24:55] another people in this day that are
[1:24:57] under a covenant with God so what you're
[1:25:00] going through is not just your problem
[1:25:02] it's also God's problem and God's
[1:25:05] looking on your behalf and willing to
[1:25:08] move for you if you'll turn back to
[1:25:10] where he
[1:25:14] is so
[1:25:16] David after after encourage himself
[1:25:19] David was able to move to the solution
[1:25:21] that God had provided you'll never get
[1:25:23] to the Sol solution of your problem
[1:25:26] unless you get your focus off your
[1:25:28] problem and get your focus on your God
[1:25:31] see discouragement does not come from
[1:25:33] the Lord it comes from our adversary the
[1:25:35] devil that's why David could encourage
[1:25:38] himself from the Lord because the Lord
[1:25:40] was the source of his solution not the
[1:25:43] source of his problem see anxiety and
[1:25:46] worry and fretting and discouragement it
[1:25:48] indicates we're walking by sight and not
[1:25:51] by faith
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:25:56] amen I you can go do a study on this is
[1:25:59] quite amazing but if you'll just punch
[1:26:01] in in the message search deep thinker or
[1:26:03] crossing Bridges Lord have mercy you
[1:26:06] want some hide burning go go do that for
[1:26:08] a minute especially if you're one of
[1:26:10] them let us he said let us say praise be
[1:26:12] to God it's a it's in discernment he
[1:26:14] said this is what we need this is it
[1:26:16] this is the time is this the patient how
[1:26:18] do it do sister you're an awful deep
[1:26:21] thinker aren't you sister got a weary

[1:26:32] which give you
[1:26:35] arthritis plus Lord now that's going to
[1:26:39] a doctor right
[1:26:42] there let's don't just give you
[1:26:44] something to cover up a symptom but
[1:26:46] let's go right down to the root of the
[1:26:51] issue I I hope it catch something right
[1:26:53] there it's going going to church is not
[1:26:55] about just covering up the symptom it's
[1:26:57] getting down to the
[1:26:59] issues in our lives and saying God come
[1:27:02] down and root out that root of
[1:27:04] bitterness or root out that hurt or root
[1:27:06] out that issue that I've allowed to lay
[1:27:09] there amen why cuz it's causing you to
[1:27:11] get acid in the
[1:27:15] blood and you get
[1:27:18] arthritis bring it over to the spiritual
[1:27:20] side you got arthritis and you can't
[1:27:23] hardly lift that hand no
[1:27:25] more can't hardly stomp that foot no
[1:27:28] more why cuz your hurts and your pain
[1:27:31] and your bitterness why because we've
[1:27:34] allowed to to stay up here so
[1:27:39] long come on somebody we allow it to
[1:27:42] stay right here and you know how it is I
[1:27:45] I know how it is you get something uh
[1:27:47] with a brother in the church or whoever
[1:27:48] and you got well I'm going to tell you
[1:27:50] what I'm going to go talk to that
[1:27:51] brother and you know what I'm going to
[1:27:52] tell him I'm going to tell him what I
[1:27:53] feel I'm going to say this and he going
[1:27:55] to say that he better not say that cuz
[1:27:58] if he says that I'm going to say this
[1:28:00] and we begin to think about this whole
[1:28:01] thing in our mind and we got it all
[1:28:03] planned out how it's going to be and we
[1:28:06] get over there and we begin to talk to
[1:28:07] the brother he don't even know what
[1:28:08] we're talking about most of the time
[1:28:10] it's our
[1:28:14] issues I told you the prophet of God
[1:28:17] said our worst enemy is ourself
[1:28:25] amen amen another one tons of these and
[1:28:28] ain't just women it's men too said but
[1:28:31] come lady you're a deep thinker you're
[1:28:33] sincere with all your heart but it's
[1:28:34] caused you to be a nervous person you're
[1:28:36] very nervous you're always taking other
[1:28:38] people's things thinking about that
[1:28:40] Crossing Bridges before you get to it
[1:28:43] building things that never happen and
[1:28:46] that's developed a stomach trouble for
[1:28:52] you yes that's kind how all that hits
[1:28:55] don't it
[1:28:57] just but Paul said we walk by faith and
[1:29:01] not by sight that's only two I just read
[1:29:03] you but there's tons of them go look at
[1:29:04] them about about deep thinkers or
[1:29:06] crossing Bridges it but it what was it
[1:29:09] that we walk Paul said we walk by faith
[1:29:11] not by sight and that was the source of
[1:29:14] his stability and strength when we walk
[1:29:16] by faith we're put in our confidence in
[1:29:20] God and in his
[1:29:22] word when we walk by sight we're putting
[1:29:25] our confidence in our senses amen our
[1:29:27] feelings and our understanding and then
[1:29:29] we fall prey to the devil's
[1:29:33] will that's right but when we find
[1:29:35] ourselves in discouragement we find
[1:29:38] where we've been placing our
[1:29:40] trust the answer is to put your trust
[1:29:43] back in the Lord Paul said faith comes
[1:29:46] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:29:47] God so when discouragement comes you
[1:29:49] find whether you've been walking by
[1:29:52] sight or by faith if you walk by faith
[1:29:55] you'll move right back to the
[1:29:58] scripture and let the promises of God
[1:30:01] build up the faith build up the strength
[1:30:04] listen God wants you to be encouraged
[1:30:06] therefore he gives you means to be
[1:30:08] encouraged by amen you must recognize
[1:30:11] that you don't have to stay
[1:30:16] discouraged you don't have to stay in
[1:30:18] your issues you don't have to stay in
[1:30:20] your problems it's like you brother man
[1:30:22] I'm talking about you you can't
[1:30:24] sometimes let help a bird flying over
[1:30:26] your head but you don't have to make him
[1:30:28] let him make a nest in your hair amen
[1:30:30] you you you you you can be encouraged in
[1:30:33] fact you can encourage
[1:30:35] yourself in the
[1:30:39] Lord amen you know uh I I've used this
[1:30:43] illustration before and I think I'm in a
[1:30:45] pretty safe place to use this but you
[1:30:47] know we had these barn swallows and
[1:30:49] they're I understand protected and stuff
[1:30:51] but listen they make a mess
[1:30:54] they get on the side of your house and
[1:30:56] they make all kinds of messes mud and
[1:30:59] their manure and everything dropping
[1:31:00] down and poor little bird no they're
[1:31:02] making a mess on my
[1:31:06] house you know what I
[1:31:11] do you take them out they can't come no
[1:31:13] more that's the way I look at
[1:31:15] it and I clean the mess off my house too
[1:31:19] many people allow the devil to just come
[1:31:21] in not but build
[1:31:24] [Applause]
[1:31:26] nest and next thing you know they got a
[1:31:28] hair to do about this tall I ain't
[1:31:30] talking about physically I'm talking
[1:31:31] about spiritually because they've
[1:31:33] allowed Nest to be built in their
[1:31:36] minds and all the mud and the manure and
[1:31:39] things they got to go through the
[1:31:41] devil's thinking and his wishes and what
[1:31:43] he wants and the destruction and all
[1:31:45] that stuff they're carrying it all with
[1:31:47] them but if they just grab a hold of the
[1:31:49] promises of
[1:31:50] [Applause]
[1:31:51] God I understand we got Old and New
[1:31:54] Testament here I understand it's a
[1:31:56] double barrel
[1:31:59] shotgun you heard this before ain't you
[1:32:01] brother Tommy he just that thing
[1:32:04] and knocked that devil out of the sky
[1:32:06] and say devil I'm not listening to you
[1:32:08] no more you don't belong here I never
[1:32:11] belong to you I belong to
[1:32:15] God my mind belongs to God my body
[1:32:18] belongs to God my thoughts are his I
[1:32:22] give myself to him
[1:32:24] [Applause]
[1:32:26] that's good amen you got to remember
[1:32:29] Jesus Christ has committed himself to
[1:32:32] take care of you in every
[1:32:36] situation
[1:32:37] than when the circumstances of Life
[1:32:40] pressed in on David David pressed into
[1:32:43] his
[1:32:44] benefits he gave an outline of them in
[1:32:47] Psalms 103 bless the Lord oh my soul who
[1:32:50] forget and forget not all his benefit he
[1:32:52] forgives all all our diseases he heals
[1:32:55] all our our iniquities he heals all our
[1:32:58] diseases he redeems your life from
[1:33:00] destruction he crowns you with loving
[1:33:02] kindness and Tender Mercies he satisfies
[1:33:05] your mouth with good things so that your
[1:33:07] youth is renewed like
[1:33:14] eagles I love that I I I've I've worked
[1:33:16] on that word a long time but I love it I
[1:33:18] can't get off of it when I see it who
[1:33:20] heals forgives all heals all
[1:33:24] three letters all and you put every
[1:33:28] devil in
[1:33:30] that you can put every sin you can put
[1:33:32] every sickness in three letters all I
[1:33:35] love how simple God makes it I heal all
[1:33:38] th diseases he don't give us no fine
[1:33:40] print said but this one this this one
[1:33:42] this one this one I can't do no all thy
[1:33:45] diseases all thy sins though you be
[1:33:48] though you be red carlet I can make you
[1:33:51] white as snow it doesn't matter what you
[1:33:54] been what you've been through God is
[1:34:00] all so the key is to stop giving voice
[1:34:03] to your discouragement and start giving
[1:34:06] voice to your
[1:34:08] encouragement amen stop repeating the
[1:34:11] lies of the devil and start speaking the
[1:34:13] word of
[1:34:14] God stop speaking out of fear and start
[1:34:18] speaking in faith stop talking about the
[1:34:21] problems and start talking about your
[1:34:23] God
[1:34:27] Heen brother Brandon we talk about this
[1:34:29] I think it look into the Unseen he said
[1:34:31] there's a talking to that guy that was
[1:34:32] selling TVs and come to find out the guy
[1:34:35] was talking about I don't know about all
[1:34:36] that stuff up there you know that
[1:34:38] William here you just talking to William
[1:34:40] brandom you know and he said he but he
[1:34:42] begin to tell him he said you know just
[1:34:44] like that TV he said there's we also
[1:34:46] have a sending station and a receiving
[1:34:48] station and he said well there's a
[1:34:50] throne of God that sends out a signal
[1:34:52] and he said down here hearts that can be
[1:34:54] tuned just right to receive something
[1:34:57] from that
[1:34:58] throne and that's why we come to the
[1:35:00] house of God because you know as it were
[1:35:02] back years ago some of you young people
[1:35:04] don't even know nothing about this but
[1:35:06] they used to have a radio that had a
[1:35:07] dial on it and you had to tune that baby
[1:35:09] just right to get the signal because if
[1:35:11] you didn't you got another station or
[1:35:13] you
[1:35:14] got kinds of stuff but you had to just
[1:35:16] sit there and just fiddle with it ain't
[1:35:19] like that no more you know it's push a
[1:35:20] button or whatever but then it was a
[1:35:23] little hard chip to listen to
[1:35:26] something but here this is what he's
[1:35:28] saying he said if you'll let God come
[1:35:30] into your heart and just tune it
[1:35:34] sometimes it just needs a little
[1:35:36] bit and all of a sudden the static of
[1:35:39] the world's tuned out not hearing the
[1:35:42] voices of Satan no more and his lies and
[1:35:45] he's been telling you that you ain't
[1:35:46] going to make it and the B messaging for
[1:35:48] you and it's a bunch of nonsense and
[1:35:49] brother Brand's a liar just let the
[1:35:51] voice of God the hand of God come into
[1:35:53] your your heart and just tune it just a
[1:35:55] little
[1:35:58] bit come on somebody I mean I wonder why
[1:36:01] he said if we can just tune our hearts
[1:36:03] to where everyone begins to think God is
[1:36:08] God go read that quote God is God he
[1:36:11] said every person in this building would
[1:36:13] be
[1:36:17] healed hello I don't believe that was
[1:36:20] just 50 or 60 years ago you got the
[1:36:23] wrong preacher if you believe if you
[1:36:25] think I believe that everything was 50
[1:36:27] or 60 years ago I believe he's still the
[1:36:29] same yesterday today and forever he
[1:36:32] still heals he still delivers he still
[1:36:36] saves he still moves he still fills with
[1:36:39] the Holy Ghost he still restores
[1:36:42] families he'll put Joy back in your
[1:36:44] heart like you never had
[1:36:48] before this ain't just a hope so or
[1:36:50] maybe so or somehow maybe someday down
[1:36:53] the Road either it is today we are Sons
[1:36:55] and Daughters of God today we are his
[1:36:58] children today we are his people today
[1:37:01] we are his bride woo Hallelujah today I
[1:37:05] belong to Jesus today I am his today he
[1:37:08] is mine and he is watching over me
[1:37:17] today but we give voice too many times
[1:37:20] to our doubts and our frustrations and
[1:37:23] our fear feelings
[1:37:24] and have mercy
[1:37:27] Jesus may not be that way here at this
[1:37:30] evening light but it is at the other
[1:37:31] evening
[1:37:36] life well you know I I tell you
[1:37:39] what if I was the pastor I'd do well if
[1:37:43] God wanted you to be the pastor you'd be
[1:37:44] the
[1:37:46] pastor you know just the way it is I I'm
[1:37:48] sorry well if I was the piano player if
[1:37:50] I was this listen if God wants you to be
[1:37:52] you'll be don't worry about
[1:37:54] it I get amazed you know people have
[1:37:57] told my my father that he kept them from
[1:37:59] having a Ministry I thought my how is
[1:38:01] man greater than God really they
[1:38:04] understand what they're saying that a
[1:38:05] man can keep something from happening
[1:38:07] that's ordained of God
[1:38:09] beloney if that's so God ain't
[1:38:12] God but if God be
[1:38:18] God now brother Tom didn't even ask me
[1:38:20] to do this and he didn't ask he didn't
[1:38:22] pay me extra
[1:38:25] you know I got to say this I'm at home I
[1:38:27] at even like Tabernacle okay my dad you
[1:38:31] know gets he gets funny sometimes he
[1:38:33] said you know a lot of people want to
[1:38:36] Discount because the word is still the
[1:38:40] discerner the word still the discern
[1:38:42] thoughts and intense of the heart yes
[1:38:45] the gift that was in brother Brian gift
[1:38:47] of a prophet is not here in that
[1:38:49] capacity no more but that word is still
[1:38:51] here and spirit that angel is still here
[1:38:55] it still discerns it still
[1:38:58] moves but
[1:39:00] many said we like well he G brother Tom
[1:39:03] told him that while he was out fishing
[1:39:05] with him I guarantee
[1:39:07] you my dad said well if you want to
[1:39:09] believe that you can believe I paid him
[1:39:11] $500 extra to say
[1:39:16] it but it becomes car Things become so
[1:39:20] carnal who's the greatest who's this
[1:39:22] who's that who's got this position who's
[1:39:25] listen it ain't about carnality and
[1:39:27] human thoughts and human I don't even
[1:39:28] know why I'm going here but this is
[1:39:30] where we
[1:39:31] at it ain't about our caral carnality
[1:39:35] it's about
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:40] Christ but this is a write up that
[1:39:42] somebody sent me that's been put out I
[1:39:45] don't really know about exactly who but
[1:39:46] they say being a pastor is listed
[1:39:49] amongst the four most difficult
[1:39:51] positions in the United States
[1:39:54] because a pastor must be a preacher an
[1:39:56] example a father a husband a counselor a
[1:39:59] conference caller planner Miss Minister
[1:40:02] Visionary director Mentor friend
[1:40:08] reconciliatory etc etc etc anybody want
[1:40:13] that
[1:40:15] job Keeper of the
[1:40:18] temple every Pastor constantly confronts
[1:40:21] many things such as the pastor doesn't
[1:40:23] visit me sermons are too long my music's
[1:40:25] too loud the building's too cold one of
[1:40:28] the most difficult things in the life of
[1:40:29] a pastor is to know at some point people
[1:40:32] they love will abandon and even betray
[1:40:34] them the pastor is often the loneliest
[1:40:37] person in the congregation you may see a
[1:40:39] pastor be surrounded by people but very
[1:40:41] rarely people that are interested that
[1:40:44] that very rarely are the people only
[1:40:46] interested in the pastor's problems but
[1:40:49] they're interested in their problems and
[1:40:51] their needs and their lives he said if
[1:40:53] we have a if you have a pastor as a
[1:40:55] friend take care of
[1:40:57] them pray for
[1:40:59] them connect with the vision that God
[1:41:02] gave them support them but above all
[1:41:06] love them remember they are human and in
[1:41:09] the same way they go through the same
[1:41:11] things as you do even if you don't
[1:41:13] believe it many of them have sacrificed
[1:41:15] Comforts rest personal plans and so many
[1:41:18] things including some of their own
[1:41:20] family's needs to ATT turn attend to
[1:41:22] God's Calla value the time a pastor puts
[1:41:25] into the work and prayers he makes for
[1:41:27] everyone the burden he voluntary carries
[1:41:30] for Ministry you don't no matter how
[1:41:32] much he he'd appreciate knowing that you
[1:41:34] do Jeremiah 3:15 I will give you
[1:41:37] Shepherds according to my own heart who
[1:41:39] shall lead them in knowledge and
[1:41:41] understanding for all pastors thank you
[1:41:43] for all that you
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:51] do hey
[1:41:55] well I tell you what you could have read
[1:41:56] that on pastor's appreciation week what
[1:41:58] I'm going to tell you brother brand said
[1:42:00] Mother's Day ought to be every day
[1:42:01] Father's Day ought to be I believe we
[1:42:02] ought to appreciate our pastor every
[1:42:05] day I appreciate I think we ought to
[1:42:07] appreciate each other every
[1:42:09] day listen Co showed a lot of people
[1:42:12] real quick what it was like not to be
[1:42:14] able to get together not to be have
[1:42:16] friends not to come over for get
[1:42:18] togethers and all kinds of things it
[1:42:19] showed what you don't have very quick
[1:42:22] yeah that's
[1:42:27] right but when you do have
[1:42:30] it appreciate it what you
[1:42:36] do see it's not about
[1:42:38] us it's about
[1:42:41] him let your meditation be about the
[1:42:44] Lord and about his love and his word and
[1:42:46] his promises his goodness his works his
[1:42:49] grace his Mercy his love as you do
[1:42:52] you'll better cast your cares on the
[1:42:54] Lord with a strong
[1:42:56] confidence that he cares about
[1:42:59] everything going on in your
[1:43:05] life you know there was a time in Israel
[1:43:07] when the ark was away and it was it was
[1:43:11] captured and it was taken into captivity
[1:43:14] and and and and and and the Philistines
[1:43:16] had it for some time lot of lot you can
[1:43:18] get into that but there was a time when
[1:43:20] it was being brought back and David was
[1:43:23] dancing before the Lord why why was he
[1:43:25] dancing because the word was being
[1:43:28] restored here it was coming back to his
[1:43:30] rightful place and he knew if the word
[1:43:33] was brought back to his rightful
[1:43:34] position then God's people could be
[1:43:37] blessed again and and and so he he he
[1:43:39] began to dance he got so over and here
[1:43:41] he is just praising God and and
[1:43:44] worshiping God and you know here here it
[1:43:46] was Michael's the this Michelle the S
[1:43:49] Saul's daughter she looked through a
[1:43:51] window and and she began to make fun and
[1:43:53] despise him in their
[1:43:55] heart and here they brought the Ark of
[1:43:58] the Lord and they set it in his place in
[1:44:00] the midst of the Tabernacle and David
[1:44:01] offered burnt offerings and peace
[1:44:04] offerings before the Lord and and as
[1:44:06] soon as David made a end of his offering
[1:44:08] burnt offering peace offering he blessed
[1:44:09] the people and he dealt to all the
[1:44:11] people among the multitude as well as
[1:44:14] the women and the men to everyone a cake
[1:44:15] of bread good peace of Flesh and a
[1:44:17] flagon of wine so all the people
[1:44:20] departed everyone to his house but then
[1:44:22] he returned to to bless his household
[1:44:24] and Michelle the daughter of Saul came
[1:44:27] out to meet him he said how glorious was
[1:44:29] the king of Israel today who uncovered
[1:44:30] himself today in the eyes of the hands
[1:44:33] made of his servant as one of the vain
[1:44:35] fellows shamelessly uncovers himself and
[1:44:37] David said unto Michelle it was before
[1:44:39] the Lord it was before the Lord which
[1:44:42] chose me before thy father before all
[1:44:45] his house to appoint me ruler of the
[1:44:47] people of the Lord of Israel therefore I
[1:44:49] pray before the Lord and I yet will yet
[1:44:52] be more V then thus and it'll be based
[1:44:54] in my own sight of that maid servants
[1:44:57] which I was spoken of of whom that I had
[1:44:59] honored therefore Michelle the daughter
[1:45:01] of Saul had no child under the day of
[1:45:04] her
[1:45:05] death now you can read on in the Bible
[1:45:08] and she actually somebody asked this
[1:45:10] question she actually had children but
[1:45:12] they was not the children of the king
[1:45:16] she was taken out of the lineage of the
[1:45:18] king and because of her her her her
[1:45:21] scorn and what d Avid was doing and he's
[1:45:24] like look look if you don't like that
[1:45:26] watch
[1:45:28] this I got a right to worship my God I I
[1:45:31] got a right to praise him I you know I
[1:45:33] got to thinking about that brother Tom
[1:45:35] we Face a lot of criticisms and things
[1:45:37] because people see our worship and see
[1:45:39] things that goes on in our churches a
[1:45:41] lot of times and they begin to wonder
[1:45:43] why does how could that be God how could
[1:45:45] that listen it ain't about you it's
[1:45:47] about me and Jesus I'm worshiping my God
[1:45:51] and I say to those people if you don't
[1:45:53] like that watch this there's going to be
[1:45:56] more healings more deliverances more
[1:45:59] prodical return more Holy Ghost more
[1:46:02] power more of the anointing more
[1:46:06] worship it's going to be more of
[1:46:09] Jesus there going to be more of God
[1:46:11] moving in our
[1:46:13] hearts why why are we like this word has
[1:46:17] returned to his
[1:46:20] position Hallelujah the word has been
[1:46:23] brought forth out of the Dark Ages of
[1:46:26] denominational system and been brought
[1:46:28] back into the hearts of men and women
[1:46:31] therefore we have a right to praise a
[1:46:33] God who set me free praise The God Who
[1:46:36] lifts me up praise The God Who broke
[1:46:39] depression off my life praise The God
[1:46:42] Who Health
[1:46:43] me I have a
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:49] right you have a right even like
[1:46:52] Tabernacle
[1:46:53] to praise the one has God been good to
[1:46:56] you has he healed you has he delivered
[1:46:59] you has he set you
[1:47:02] free has he moved your heart has he come
[1:47:06] down and saved your children then you
[1:47:08] have a right to worship
[1:47:12] him cuz the word has been brought back
[1:47:16] into his position and into his
[1:47:20] place Lord got to be careful when you
[1:47:23] get get in times like that that you
[1:47:24] don't get
[1:47:26] critical cuz you don't know you may not
[1:47:28] be criticizing brother for so and so or
[1:47:30] sister so and so you very well could be
[1:47:32] criticizing the Holy
[1:47:34] Ghost and I think we ought to take the
[1:47:36] prophet's attitude towards some of these
[1:47:38] things he said it he tells about it in
[1:47:40] in a sermon Christ tells about this
[1:47:43] several times but he talks about those
[1:47:45] sisters that got up begin to sing
[1:47:47] remember that song that story man now
[1:47:50] listen to what he says here I think
[1:47:51] there's something because you know a lot
[1:47:53] of us excuse me in my Folly for just a
[1:47:56] moment but a lot of us love the church
[1:47:58] order book and we want to but we only
[1:48:00] love certain parts of that we want right
[1:48:04] well he said 30 to 45 minutes preacher
[1:48:07] well let's just see what he
[1:48:08] done okay he said I was teaching on the
[1:48:12] second coming of Christ and I was
[1:48:14] drawing it out as best as I knew how
[1:48:17] would descend and may Ascend into glory
[1:48:20] and I was given a little intermission
[1:48:22] and they be to sing some songs while I
[1:48:23] was resting for I had about 4 and a half
[1:48:27] hours of teaching
[1:48:32] straight well anyway
[1:48:36] Hallelujah you don't ever hear anybody
[1:48:38] bringing up that
[1:48:40] quote and they were seeing I ain't going
[1:48:42] to keep Lord willing ain't going to keep
[1:48:44] you that long
[1:48:45] but they were singing a special and
[1:48:47] there was some people from Louisville
[1:48:49] some Full Gospel people and they had
[1:48:50] this special some young ladies wanted to
[1:48:52] beat some little tin cans and things and
[1:48:54] had a washboard and some Thimbles and
[1:48:56] some fingers and I played on this
[1:48:57] washboard and I guess you seen the
[1:48:59] hookup or heard it one of was going to
[1:49:01] play the piano and started playing that
[1:49:03] song there is going to be a meeting in
[1:49:05] the air the sweet sweet by and
[1:49:09] by and I said oh my little lady's turned
[1:49:12] real white around the mouth and begin to
[1:49:14] beat that piano he said I believe should
[1:49:17] have had three or four decks of keys
[1:49:18] should have played every one of them
[1:49:20] I've never seen such play in my life and
[1:49:22] the lady on the washboard hitting them
[1:49:24] Thimbles and this little blond-headed
[1:49:25] sister about so high jumped out on the
[1:49:27] floor and started dancing and I said oh
[1:49:30] my here it is why did they have to go
[1:49:33] and do that so I waited around at the
[1:49:36] people and they looked at me and I
[1:49:37] looked at them and I thought well I'm a
[1:49:39] fundamentalist you got to show me that
[1:49:41] in the Bible I thought my there's a
[1:49:43] whole lot of things us fundamentalist
[1:49:45] don't know that's in there that's
[1:49:47] all that's what he said so I looked
[1:49:50] around I thought well where did Dancing
[1:49:52] ever come from and I was sitting there
[1:49:53] in the seat of the scornful of course
[1:49:55] you know I'm quoting the prophet not
[1:49:58] saying nothing listen to this not saying
[1:50:01] nothing I was afraid to say anything cuz
[1:50:04] I was afraid they might be right and me
[1:50:13] wrong that'd be a good one to go by
[1:50:15] sometimes wouldn't it well I tell you I
[1:50:17] just ain't got no filter we'll get one
[1:50:21] [Applause]
[1:50:23] it's called a thinking man
[1:50:25] filter amen well he said I wouldn't say
[1:50:29] nothing cuz they might be right and I
[1:50:31] might be
[1:50:33] wrong what a revelation I so now isn't
[1:50:36] that terrible though right here in my
[1:50:37] Tabernacle now there's other times you
[1:50:39] can look he said they turn in the
[1:50:40] barroom a Tavern all kinds of things and
[1:50:43] he said this little lady out there just
[1:50:44] with her eyes closed just dancing first
[1:50:46] thing you know one got up to other
[1:50:48] another got up and start oh my so I
[1:50:51] begin to rehearse in my mind that in the
[1:50:52] Bible did they dance I thought when they
[1:50:55] dance what was it and dancing was spoke
[1:50:57] of pharaoh was pursuing Israel and all
[1:50:59] the enemy was drowned and Mar and picked
[1:51:01] up a tambourine and be to beat it began
[1:51:03] to dance and all the daughters of Israel
[1:51:05] followed her dancing I thought well
[1:51:08] there they had Victory and then I read
[1:51:09] where David and the Ark had been away so
[1:51:11] long and he saw it returning back and he
[1:51:13] got so happy he started dancing why he
[1:51:16] had Victory his sweetheart made fun of
[1:51:18] him laughed at him but well if you don't
[1:51:20] like that watch this and down around he
[1:51:22] went again I thought well he she sat up
[1:51:24] there and laughed him and God put a
[1:51:25] curse on her and said David thou art a
[1:51:28] man after my own heart and I thought the
[1:51:29] only thing is a matter with me I ain't
[1:51:32] got enough Victory
[1:51:42] maybe I know a lot of people say well
[1:51:44] that just ain't me well them same people
[1:51:46] get out to ball ball game and act a
[1:51:50] fool and you can read in the church age

[1:51:53] can do that at a ball game he said you
[1:51:55] ought to be able to do it at the house
[1:51:56] of God Amen if you can shout the Victory
[1:52:00] and and and push that's what we're doing

[1:52:07] the minister to push further go a little
[1:52:10] harder amen preaching a little more
[1:52:12] until that devil is driven out of our
[1:52:15] lives and we got enough Victory to
[1:52:17] praise God for

[1:52:20] it you say well I don't know why does
[1:52:23] brother Tommy act like he does well you
[1:52:25] just go where brother Tommy's been and
[1:52:27] see what God has done for him you'll
[1:52:29] know why he does what he
[1:52:33] does listen if my God had healed me from
[1:52:36] heart trouble like that I'd be waving a
[1:52:38] flag of Victory this morning cuz he's
[1:52:40] still God he's still the same yesterday
[1:52:43] today and

[1:53:06] yet I can tell you one thing when this

[1:53:27] more that feels pretty good but only
[1:53:30] last couple hours and I got up this

[1:53:35] body ain't going to be like
[1:53:38] that one day I'm going to take my final
[1:53:42] step and I'm going to step into a new
[1:53:45] body you think you've heard shouting

[1:54:08] over the
[1:54:09] devil well you let him get in a heal
[1:54:11] body one time and see what's going to
[1:54:16] happen

[1:54:20] with me I just ain't got enough victory
[1:54:23] maybe in a few minutes something
[1:54:28] happened now this might shock you that's
[1:54:32] what he said this might shock you one
[1:54:35] place he said he said I felt my
[1:54:36] Methodist foot start
[1:54:40] tapping he said when I came to myself I
[1:54:43] was out there with that little girl
[1:54:45] dancing on the
[1:54:47] floor well I don't know just the just
[1:54:51] the thing I thought I wouldn't do I did
[1:54:54] I was never on a dance floor in my life
[1:54:57] but I guess I did it all right I sure
[1:55:00] felt awful good I had a lot of Victory
[1:55:03] after that so that would be all right
[1:55:05] then I
[1:55:11] guess see God is in music God is in
[1:55:14] music he's in art he's in his Universe
[1:55:16] he's in creatures he's in church he's
[1:55:19] he's everywhere he's present right now
[1:55:21] God is what I just wonder sometimes if
[1:55:23] you just take the shades off off our
[1:55:25] eyes till our sight can be fast enough
[1:55:28] to catch his presence in the building
[1:55:30] right now you know there's all kind of
[1:55:32] things going through this building
[1:55:34] there's telephone signals there's radio
[1:55:37] messages there's television pictures
[1:55:39] going through but if our eyes can't pick
[1:55:40] it up but if we could be a magnet post
[1:55:43] for the Holy Ghost right now then God
[1:55:46] sends a message out of glory and we pick
[1:55:48] it up that's wonderful I want to be that
[1:55:51] kind of person
[1:55:54] [Applause]
[1:56:00] just for an illustration there's a dear
[1:56:02] friend of ours we called him Grandpa he
[1:56:04] wasn't our grandpa but brother Dan Dyer
[1:56:06] from Johnson City uh we call him Grandpa
[1:56:09] Grandpa and Grandma D and there was like
[1:56:12] that to us me and my sisters and our
[1:56:15] children and things my wife and brother
[1:56:18] brother Dan had quite a sense of humor
[1:56:20] he loved sweets grandma was always on
[1:56:22] him about sweets you know and so he'd
[1:56:24] sneak around and get
[1:56:25] sweets so one night she stayed home from
[1:56:28] church and he went to church and he said
[1:56:31] he said you know it's just just just for
[1:56:33] illustration he said I was sitting over
[1:56:34] there minding my own business listening
[1:56:36] to the word of God and he said you know
[1:56:38] from way over and over that corner came
[1:56:40] one of them blizzard
[1:56:43] Spirits he said would you know it landed
[1:56:46] right on top of
[1:56:47] me he said I got before I got home I had
[1:56:50] to get me one of them blizzards and he
[1:56:52] said I ate that thing said next thing I
[1:56:54] know I had it running all over me he
[1:56:56] said why cuz I picked the thing
[1:56:58] up God if a man can get a blizzard
[1:57:01] spirit in
[1:57:05] church come on I we we can tend to pick
[1:57:08] up all kinds of things out there in the
[1:57:10] world and attitudes and situations but
[1:57:12] listen I want to come to church and pick
[1:57:14] up on what the spirit is doing and how
[1:57:16] he's moving and if he's moving in a
[1:57:18] certain way I want to move in that
[1:57:20] way however he wants to move I want to
[1:57:23] move I understand it ain't always
[1:57:25] shouting and dancing and all that it's
[1:57:27] sometimes in those Quiet Moments and
[1:57:29] those but however God chooses to move I
[1:57:32] want to be flexible enough to say yes
[1:57:34] Lord yes Lord yes Lord however it is I
[1:57:39] want to move where he
[1:57:44] moves you know in south southern
[1:57:48] us probably here which I I consider
[1:57:50] y'all the South we have a saying that
[1:57:53] goes something like this I bet he's
[1:57:55] singing a different tune
[1:57:57] now right the context of this is someone
[1:58:00] has a radical event happened in his life
[1:58:03] and because of this he acts
[1:58:07] differently because of this life
[1:58:09] altering event he no longer sings the
[1:58:12] same song because the old song doesn't
[1:58:16] apply no
[1:58:19] more because this new song is a way of
[1:58:23] saying I have a lifechanging experience
[1:58:26] with the creator of the entire universe
[1:58:28] so therefore I cannot remain the same I
[1:58:32] now sing a new song because my desires

[2:01:58] us he won't the preacher wants to preach
[2:02:01] a prepared sermon for a prepared
[2:02:04] people because Jesus is to prepare place
[2:02:08] but it's going to be for a prepared
[2:02:10] people a people that's prepared to live
[2:02:17] there here they are right here right
[2:02:21] here at this and here going to see one
[2:02:23] of the greatest things ever witnessed
[2:02:25] the opening of this Red Sea and they
[2:02:26] don't even know in the next few minutes
[2:02:29] how God is going to work and they're
[2:02:30] complaining and they're fussing and
[2:02:33] they're upset and they're mad and
[2:02:35] they're thinking I'm just here to die
[2:02:37] and you know
[2:02:40] what you know what God Said first he
[2:02:42] moves and he goes between them and the
[2:02:44] Egyptians I love how he does that whole
[2:02:46] sermon and that stand our stand between
[2:02:49] all that but here he is and he tells
[2:02:51] Moses why don't you just lift
[2:02:54] rod and he begins speak and he said You
[2:02:57] shall hold your
[2:03:00] peace read the scriptures what it said
[2:03:02] You shall hold your peace now I I read
[2:03:04] that in good old southern langu Lang you
[2:03:05] need to shut your
[2:03:08] mouth because all you're doing is
[2:03:10] spewing doubt and unbelief and
[2:03:12] everything just shut your
[2:03:14] mouth if you're not going to speak and
[2:03:17] faith and speak the word of God just
[2:03:19] keep your mouth closed I'm talking about
[2:03:22] me too I ain't just talking about you
[2:03:23] matter of fact I'm talking about the
[2:03:24] egyp the Israelites I'm not talking
[2:03:27] about
[2:03:28] you keep your mouth
[2:03:30] shut unless there's something of the
[2:03:33] word that can come
[2:03:35] out and let God's word be spoke out of
[2:03:39] your lips and let it be a Word of
[2:03:43] Faith cuz he was about to take them and
[2:03:46] change their song and we can read about
[2:03:48] it they go through the they go through
[2:03:50] this and they go all the way through
[2:03:52] this Red Sea and I ain't got time but
[2:03:54] they go through on dry ground and just
[2:03:55] incredible things that took place and
[2:03:57] they get to the other side and they look
[2:04:00] back and the Egyptians said well we can
[2:04:02] do it too and here they
[2:04:03] come and the waters Clos now what I love
[2:04:07] about this is God said the Egyptians
[2:04:09] that you see today you'll see no more
[2:04:13] forever I love that because I read in my
[2:04:16] Bible that it says in the Bible that
[2:04:19] later they saw them floating in the sea
[2:04:22] well I thought they wern't going to see
[2:04:23] him no more forever as he said so it was
[2:04:27] the Egyptians that you see today they
[2:04:29] got life in their body they can still
[2:04:31] pick up a whip they can still make you a
[2:04:33] slave but today their power is
[2:04:37] ended when the next time you see them
[2:04:40] they will be dead they will be under
[2:04:42] your feet they will not have power over
[2:04:44] you but you shall have power over
[2:04:48] [Applause]
[2:04:49] them and he changed their song and we
[2:04:52] can read about it in Exodus 15:1 then
[2:04:55] sang Moses and the children of Israel
[2:04:57] this song unto the Lord and said I'll
[2:04:59] singing to the Lord for he has triumphed
[2:05:01] gloriously the horse and his rider has
[2:05:04] he thrown in the
[2:05:05] sea the Lord is my strength and song he
[2:05:08] has become my salvation he is my God and
[2:05:12] I will prepare oh prepared people I will
[2:05:16] prepare him a habitation my father's God
[2:05:19] and I will exalt him the Lord is a man
[2:05:21] of war the Lord is his name Pharaoh's
[2:05:24] chariots and his host as he cast into
[2:05:26] the sea his chosen Champions are drowned
[2:05:28] in the Red Sea The Depths have covered
[2:05:30] them they sank as the bottom of stone
[2:05:33] and their right hand oh Lord has become
[2:05:35] glorious and thy power thy right hand oh
[2:05:37] Lord is dashed in pieces the enemy in
[2:05:39] the greatness of thine Excellency thou
[2:05:41] has overthrown them that rose up against
[2:05:44] thee thou sendest forth thy wrath and
[2:05:46] consumed them as stubble with the blast
[2:05:48] of our nostrils the waters were gathered
[2:05:50] and the flood stood up as a heath and
[2:05:52] the depths were congealed in the heart
[2:05:54] of the Sea and the enemy said I will
[2:05:57] pursue and the enemy said I will prot
[2:05:59] overtake and the enemy said I will Defi
[2:06:02] and th spoil and my lust shall be
[2:06:04] satisfied over them and I will draw my
[2:06:06] sword and my hand shall destroy them but
[2:06:09] thou did blow with thy wind and the Sea
[2:06:12] covered them and they sank as lead in
[2:06:15] The Mighty
[2:06:18] Waters Hallelujah who is like unto the
[2:06:21] oh Lord among the gods who is like thee
[2:06:24] glorious and Holiness fearful and
[2:06:27] Praises doing wonders thou stretches out
[2:06:29] thy right hand and the Earth swallows
[2:06:32] him thou in thy mercy has led forth the
[2:06:35] people which thou has redeemed thou has
[2:06:37] guided them in thy strength into thy
[2:06:39] holy habitation the people shall hear
[2:06:41] and be afraid sorrow shall hold onto the
[2:06:44] inhabitants of palestinia and the Dukes
[2:06:47] of Adam shall be amazed the Mighty Men
[2:06:49] of Moab trembling shall take hold upon
[2:06:51] them fear and dread shall fall upon them
[2:06:53] all by the greatness of thine arm they
[2:06:56] shall be still as a stone till thy
[2:06:58] people pass over till thy people
[2:07:00] Passover which thou Hast purchased Thou
[2:07:04] shalt bring them in and plant them in
[2:07:06] the mountain of thine inheritance in the
[2:07:08] place oh Lord which I have made for thee
[2:07:10] to dwell in in the sanctuary oh Lord
[2:07:12] which thy hands have established the
[2:07:14] Lord shall reign forever and ever for
[2:07:17] the horse of pharaoh went in with his
[2:07:19] chariots and the Lord brought the the
[2:07:21] Waters of the sea upon them but the
[2:07:23] children of Israel went on dry land in
[2:07:26] the midst of the sea and about that time
[2:07:28] Mariam couldn't handle no more she
[2:07:30] grabbed a TR amberine and she be to
[2:07:33] dance begin to sing the Praises of the
[2:07:35] Lord for her God had triumphed over her
[2:07:41] enemy the Lord could you imagine brother

[2:17:04] said maram your enemy's
[2:17:13] dead she would go to the doctor the next
[2:17:16] day on Monday morning to get more pet
[2:17:19] scans and they look she's now about
[2:17:21] almost halfway through treatments and
[2:17:23] they looked and all the cancer was
[2:17:28] gone it confused the doctors they didn't
[2:17:31] know what to do they said we never seen
[2:17:33] this before she said it's my
[2:17:36] God my God moved on my behalf he touched
[2:17:40] my
[2:17:47] life she sang a new song what have I to
[2:17:51] dread what out I'm lean the arms of my
[2:18:00] beloved he's got
[2:18:02] me he won't let me fall he won't let me
[2:18:06] be ashamed and stumble and fall and
[2:18:09] crumble to Pieces but he has me in his
[2:18:17] hands I think about the scripture this
[2:18:20] is whole another the sermon but I just
[2:18:21] want to bring it in right here for a
[2:18:22] moment I'm trying to move through
[2:18:27] this but in the Bible David said my
[2:18:30] people will never be
[2:18:34] ashamed in other words you look into
[2:18:36] that you'll find that he means he won't
[2:18:38] leave you
[2:18:41] broken he won't leave you in a crumbled
[2:18:44] up place to where you're so pulled
[2:18:47] inward that you think nobody cares
[2:18:49] nobody but he's going to come
[2:18:51] and he's going to move on your behalf
[2:18:53] and he's going to touch you and he's
[2:18:55] going to minister to you and he's going
[2:18:57] to pick you
[2:18:59] up
[2:19:01] Hallelujah he's going to come on the
[2:19:03] scene and he's going to take what looks
[2:19:06] so broken and make it into something so
[2:19:09] beautiful I actually got the studying on
[2:19:12] this want to bring this part into it
[2:19:14] there's a process in Japan is
[2:19:17] called kugi kugi I think is how they
[2:19:19] pronounce it but it's where like if you
[2:19:22] was had your grandma's or
[2:19:23] great-grandmother's dish that had been
[2:19:25] passed down through generations favorite
[2:19:27] and You' picked it out for a certain
[2:19:29] celebration and you had brought it over
[2:19:31] to put it on the table and you ate gravy
[2:19:34] out of it or whatever you put in it went
[2:19:36] to take it and you went to put it back
[2:19:37] in the sink to wash it and on your way
[2:19:39] you stumbled and fell and it just
[2:19:41] shattered into pieces they actually take
[2:19:44] that they don't sweep it up and throw it
[2:19:45] all away but they got a process that
[2:19:48] they take that Potter and they gather
[2:19:49] all the pieces up and they put it all
[2:19:52] back together and you know I found where
[2:19:54] they take that you know what they put it
[2:19:56] together with brother Tom
[2:19:58] gold and they take and they say actually
[2:20:01] the value of the vessel is worth more
[2:20:05] after it's broken than before it's
[2:20:08] broken because of what they can do to it
[2:20:11] and and the gold that they place inside
[2:20:13] their life and I got to thinking about
[2:20:14] that that's exactly what God does with
[2:20:17] us he allows us to get in places where
[2:20:19] we feel so broken and we feel I'm
[2:20:22] worthless ain't no help I can be to
[2:20:23] anybody ain't nobody wants me but God
[2:20:26] does and he just patiently pick up all
[2:20:29] the pieces and starts putting it back
[2:20:31] together but in those places those
[2:20:32] cracks and those voids he's filling it
[2:20:34] with
[2:20:36] deity and I looked at I looked at some
[2:20:39] of these vessels and and I was just
[2:20:40] amazed and I I just got them here I'll
[2:20:42] just share them with you but I'm amazed
[2:20:44] at what they can look like after they
[2:20:46] take them and they're broken and they've
[2:20:49] been destroyed and look like ought to be
[2:20:50] throw in the garbage look like they
[2:20:52] ought to be worthless and worthless to
[2:20:54] anybody or everybody but a master can
[2:20:57] gather
[2:20:58] them and he can put them all back
[2:21:00] together using gold amen using gold to
[2:21:04] put it all back and the the the latter
[2:21:07] part of the vessel is worth more than
[2:21:09] the
[2:21:14] former Hallelujah when I think about my
[2:21:18] whole life and how I and how I was
[2:21:21] broken but thank God He Didn't Throw the
[2:21:24] Clay Away but he picked me up and he
[2:21:27] molded it back into his image and in
[2:21:29] those cracks and those crevices he just
[2:21:31] fills it with gold deity to where I'm in
[2:21:35] a unique vessel and there's one not one
[2:21:37] vessel the
[2:21:39] same cuz when we fall we don't all break
[2:21:43] in the same places we don't all break
[2:21:46] the same lines in the same way in the
[2:21:48] same manner but God wants is in an
[2:21:51] individual way to be made into his
[2:21:55] Beauty this is where he's at but it's
[2:21:59] all determined on where if you can put
[2:22:02] your hands in him if you can lay your
[2:22:04] life in him and rest say Lord I've tried
[2:22:08] on my
[2:22:09] own but I can't put myself back together
[2:22:13] I've tried but I can't make it I've
[2:22:16] tried to make this match up and that
[2:22:19] match up and I'm just making a jump
[2:22:20] humbled mess put yourself in his
[2:22:23] hands he knows why you're where you're
[2:22:26] at he knows what you're going through
[2:22:29] and he's not going to leave you
[2:22:32] ashamed because he said my people will
[2:22:34] never be
[2:22:36] ashamed but I think about as we begin to
[2:22:39] bring this down think about it one of my
[2:22:42] favorite stories in the Bible is Paul
[2:22:43] and
[2:22:45] Silas they had been in a church service
[2:22:48] and there was this damsel that was
[2:22:49] possessed with a Spirit of
[2:22:52] divination brought to her brought by her
[2:22:55] Masters to gain to for much gain by
[2:22:58] susay and and they followed Paul and she
[2:23:01] cried and you know Paul being grieved he
[2:23:04] turned and rebuked that spirit and
[2:23:05] commanded it to leave and they saw her
[2:23:08] delivered you know you think that they
[2:23:10] would love to see somebody delivered but
[2:23:12] they were making money off of this and
[2:23:14] so they they get angry and mad and they
[2:23:16] beat Paul and the scripture says they
[2:23:18] brought him before the magistrates and
[2:23:20] and the multitude rose up again against
[2:23:22] them and they laid many stripes upon
[2:23:24] them they cast them into prison and
[2:23:26] charged the Jailer to keep them safely
[2:23:29] who having such received such a charge
[2:23:31] put them in the inner prison other words
[2:23:33] maximum
[2:23:34] security in the inner prison charging
[2:23:37] and made the and made their feet fast in
[2:23:40] stalks now been real easy to stop a
[2:23:43] minute and say you know what Paul I
[2:23:46] didn't ask for this I mean I but I I I
[2:23:48] wanted to PR go see it and ended up like
[2:23:51] this I mean it's
[2:23:52] ridiculous I mean look at us we're real
[2:23:55] winners ain't we look here we really
[2:23:56] doing something ain't we that wasn't
[2:23:59] their idea that wasn't the way it
[2:24:00] happened I'm boy my Bible
[2:24:03] reads cursings in that prison and people
[2:24:06] screaming out I ain't done nothing wrong
[2:24:08] I ain't got no reason to be here but in
[2:24:10] the inner part of this prison Bible says
[2:24:12] at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and
[2:24:16] sang Praises unto
[2:24:19] God and the prisoners heard them they're
[2:24:22] in the innermost part of this prison and
[2:24:25] here they begin to sing and I I just
[2:24:27] want to put it in my own my own thoughts
[2:24:28] right now but I I just look as they're
[2:24:30] sitting there picture sitting there beat
[2:24:32] blood running down big old mushed up lip
[2:24:35] hair T up and P patches out they've been
[2:24:38] whipped and beat and blood everywhere
[2:24:39] and their feets in stalks and they're in
[2:24:41] bonds and they're and old Paul looks
[2:24:43] over Silas said you know what Silas
[2:24:46] what's that Paul I feel like praise and
[2:24:50] praise praising
[2:24:51] him well I feel like praising praising
[2:24:56] him well I praise him in the morning
[2:24:59] I'll praise him in the jail house I feel
[2:25:02] like praising praising
[2:25:06] him well let's all praise the Lord while
[2:25:09] we have this chance you don't know when
[2:25:12] it's going to be the last one let's all
[2:25:14] praise the Lord while we have this
[2:25:17] chance we praise him in the morning
[2:25:20] Praise Him in this church service let's
[2:25:22] all praise the Lord while we have this
[2:25:26] [Music]
[2:25:29] chance atmospheres begin to
[2:25:32] change things begin to take place now I
[2:25:35] actually begin to study on this and I I
[2:25:37] realized sing praises meant they
[2:25:39] actually begin to sing the Passover
[2:25:42] Psalms well what's the Passover Psalms
[2:25:44] well it's seven Psalms in the Bible
[2:25:47] seven chapters seven that's amazing to
[2:25:49] me because seven in church ages there's
[2:25:51] one for every Church
[2:25:53] age you know that's amazing to me I I
[2:25:56] just learned the other day as brother
[2:25:58] Matt Watkins had been over in Israel and
[2:25:59] he found he found in Israel that where
[2:26:02] there was two two instances of Jesus
[2:26:04] feeding 5,000 or one of feeding 5,000
[2:26:06] one feeding 4,000 you remember the story
[2:26:08] one tells about 12 baskets left over and
[2:26:11] five fish and two loaves of bread one
[2:26:13] talks about seven loaves one talks about
[2:26:17] seven baskets LIF if you actually study
[2:26:19] where those two places to one was he fed
[2:26:22] the Gentiles and one he fed the
[2:26:25] Jews and to the Gentiles it was seven
[2:26:27] Loaves and seven baskets left
[2:26:32] over my God he's
[2:26:36] perfect to the Jews there was 12 12
[2:26:39] tribes 12
[2:26:41] Apostles 12 Elders come on somebody
[2:26:50] so it said Passover Psalms it's Psalms
[2:26:52] 113 114 115 116 117 and 118 and
[2:26:59] 136 if you want to read them later I
[2:27:01] ain't going to read all of them because
[2:27:03] I ain't got time but I'm going to read
[2:27:04] the first one could you imagine this
[2:27:06] coming out of their mouth they got all
[2:27:07] these things upon them praise ye the
[2:27:12] Lord wait a minute Paul you lost your
[2:27:15] mind praise ye Servants of the Lord
[2:27:18] praise the name of the Lord Lord blessed
[2:27:21] be the name of the Lord from this time
[2:27:23] forth and forever more from the rising
[2:27:26] of the
[2:27:27] sun until the going down of the Saint
[2:27:30] the lord's name is to be
[2:27:34] praised hallelujah amen do you hear the
[2:27:37] word of God it he didn't tell you what's
[2:27:39] going to go on during that day what's
[2:27:41] going to transpire during that day
[2:27:43] whether you're going to end up in jail
[2:27:44] during that day whether you're going to
[2:27:46] be sick at the end of the day it does
[2:27:48] not matter when the rising of the
[2:27:50] till the going down of the same his name
[2:27:53] is to be
[2:27:55] praised for the Lord is high above all
[2:27:58] nations his glory above the heavens who
[2:28:01] is liken the Lord Our God who dwelleth
[2:28:03] on high who humble himself to behold the
[2:28:05] things are in heaven and the Earth he
[2:28:07] raises the poor Out of the Dust and
[2:28:09] lifts the needy out of the dong Hill
[2:28:11] that he may set him with princes even
[2:28:13] the princes of his people he maketh the
[2:28:15] barren woman to keep house and to be a
[2:28:18] joyful mother of children pray praise ye
[2:28:21] the
[2:28:24] Lord hallelujah now you can go on down
[2:28:27] you can go home and read those it's a
[2:28:29] good reading good study but you go and
[2:28:31] start reading down through those
[2:28:32] chapters you'll begin to be see that
[2:28:35] they begin to speak their
[2:28:39] Deliverance they begin to sing the song
[2:28:42] and now their song you can read it it's
[2:28:43] in the scripture in these Psalms thou
[2:28:46] has loosed my bonds amen thank you Lord
[2:28:50] in the next place it says tremble oh oh
[2:28:53] thou
[2:28:54] Earth they begin to worship God and to
[2:28:57] praise him and out of their praise begin
[2:29:00] to their
[2:29:02] Deliverance come on somebody that's why
[2:29:05] the devil wants to keep your praise
[2:29:07] bound up he wants to keep you down in
[2:29:10] the dirt and down in the frustration
[2:29:12] down in depression down and down and
[2:29:15] down and down but if you'll just throw
[2:29:16] up those hands and begin to worship God
[2:29:19] and begin to praise him with your mouth
[2:29:21] and begin to thank him for all that he's
[2:29:23] done you will begin to speak your
[2:29:29] deliverance Hallelujah I said you will
[2:29:32] begin to speak your in
[2:29:35] Deliverance Hallelujah and they begin to
[2:29:38] worship God and the atmosphere begin to
[2:29:40] change it didn't just affect where they
[2:29:42] said it didn't just affect their
[2:29:45] or their cell or where they was at but
[2:29:47] it affected the whole place
[2:29:51] Hallelujah that's why brother brandom
[2:29:53] said if I can give one or two people on
[2:29:56] fire for God it'll do more for a church
[2:29:58] than for the
[2:30:01] revivals woo brother Tom if we can get
[2:30:04] one or two people to start praising God
[2:30:07] to look beyond their doubts look beyond
[2:30:10] their fears look beyond their
[2:30:11] frustration and just lift up their hand
[2:30:15] anyhow say thank you Jesus thank you

[2:30:21] of bondage you brought me into this
[2:30:23] truth you brought me into Victory I am
[2:30:26] not a child of the devil I belong to
[2:30:29] [Applause]
[2:30:36] Jesus and they begin to sing and you can
[2:30:39] read it it's all down through the
[2:30:41] scriptures and all the way down to our
[2:30:44] generation our church age is

[2:34:12] I don't you start with
[2:34:14] you thank you
[2:34:18] Jesus help us Lord
[2:34:20] Lord amen I I think about a little girl
[2:34:23] about 16 years old at our church went on
[2:34:25] a Wednesday night and we had a prayer
[2:34:27] line just a random out of the blue
[2:34:30] prayer line form it went to midnight
[2:34:32] that night of God begin to deliver
[2:34:34] listen I saw so many miracles that night
[2:34:36] it was incredible I saw warts hundreds
[2:34:38] of warts over a body of a little boy
[2:34:41] they pray for and they're all
[2:34:44] gone I saw my mother who had just went
[2:34:47] through her first brain breed and she
[2:34:48] had been so down and so weak she
[2:34:50] couldn't even stand on her feet for very
[2:34:52] long and she wanted to come to that
[2:34:54] service and dad said sure you're coming
[2:34:55] said they brought people to the house of
[2:34:57] God when brother Brandon was in was here
[2:34:59] that you can sit in the office and he
[2:35:01] said when the time gets right I'm going
[2:35:02] to bring you out and God's going to show
[2:35:04] himself Among Us that was his attitude
[2:35:06] and about that time as it be to move and
[2:35:08] things begin to build he brought her out
[2:35:10] and God fell upon her so strongly she
[2:35:13] stood for two and 1 half hours with her
[2:35:15] hands up in the air praising God
[2:35:21] listen I know prayer I know praise works
[2:35:24] I know it works I seen it work I witness
[2:35:28] it to work I've seen it working my
[2:35:30] mother who was so weak she's sitting on
[2:35:32] the side of the bed depressed because
[2:35:34] she didn't thought her life was over and
[2:35:35] she thought it was finished she thought
[2:35:37] there ain't no way I can be a mother no
[2:35:38] more I can't be a grandmother no more I
[2:35:41] can't be a wife no more I'm here in a
[2:35:43] condition I can't hardly see out
[2:35:45] of my eyes Lord what am I going to do
[2:35:47] but all of a sudden her hands went up in
[2:35:49] the the air and she began to praise God
[2:35:52] and about that time my sister brought a
[2:35:53] little boy that was living with him at
