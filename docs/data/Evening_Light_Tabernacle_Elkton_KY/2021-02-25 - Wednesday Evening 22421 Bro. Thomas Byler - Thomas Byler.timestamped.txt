[25:27] let's bow our heads kind heavenly father
[25:29] we come before you once again lord jesus
[25:30] thankful lord to be able to assemble
[25:32] ourselves together
[25:34] lord jesus with like believers knowing
[25:36] god that here you are in our midst as
[25:38] your word has promised
[25:40] that you always would be with us even
[25:42] until the end
[25:43] and we pray father that as we speak on
[25:45] the subject we feel like you've laid
[25:47] upon our heart that you would just have
[25:49] your way in everything that is said and
[25:50] done
[25:51] may your name be glorified and magnified
[25:53] we also ask god for a special
[25:55] prayer for brother how god would just
[25:57] continue to raise him up lord jesus and
[25:59] lord give him strength in his body
[26:01] father and in his spirit and his soul
[26:03] lord jesus
[26:04] we commit ourselves to you lord ask god
[26:06] that you'd be with all of those that
[26:07] view over the internet and so forth
[26:10] bless every heart lord and speak to
[26:12] those out there as well as here
[26:14] we ask your blessing upon the service
[26:15] now as we committed to you in jesus name
[26:18] amen and amen
[26:21] amen i want to speak on something that's
[26:23] pretty familiar
[26:24] amen to us so if you will turn to
[26:27] revelations
[26:29] the first chapter revelations one
[26:44] amen i like that song david saying i am
[26:47] determined to hold out
[26:49] to the end amen i like that so now
[26:53] revelations the
[26:54] first chapter verse 7
[26:58] behold he cometh with clouds and every
[27:00] eye shall see him
[27:02] and they also which pierced him and all
[27:04] kindreds of the earth shall well
[27:07] because of him even so amen
[27:10] i am the alpha and omega the beginning
[27:14] and the ending amen hebrews 11.
[27:27] hebrews 11 verse 1.
[27:30] now faith is the substance of things
[27:32] hoped for the evidence of things not
[27:34] seen
[27:35] for by it the elders obtained a good
[27:37] report
[27:38] through faith we understand that the
[27:40] worlds were framed
[27:43] by the word of god so that things which
[27:45] are seen
[27:46] were not made of things which do appear
[27:49] amen may god is blessings to the reading
[27:51] of the word you can be seated tonight
[27:54] amen jesus said that he was the
[27:57] beginning
[27:59] and the ending amen so tonight
[28:02] i just want to take the thought of uh
[28:05] just to title it
[28:06] the end the end amen
[28:14] another scripture comes to me that i
[28:17] might go ahead and read
[28:19] just for a little foundation probably
[28:20] won't touch too much on it but
[28:22] over in matthew 13 verse 36 jesus
[28:26] sent the multitude away and went into
[28:29] the house house and the disciples came
[28:32] unto him saying declare us and
[28:34] declare unto us the parable of the tares
[28:36] of the field
[28:37] he answered and said unto them he that
[28:39] soweth the good seed is the son of man
[28:41] the field is the world the good seed are
[28:44] the children of the kingdom but the
[28:45] tares are the children of the wicked one
[28:48] the enemy that sowed them is the devil
[28:49] the harvest now notice the harvest is
[28:51] the end
[28:52] of the world and the reapers are the
[28:55] angels therefore as the tears are
[28:57] gathered
[28:58] together and burned in the fire so shall
[29:00] it be
[29:02] in the end of the world
[29:06] amen so that's what we're going to focus
[29:08] on is
[29:09] the end but we want to deal a little bit
[29:12] with the help of the lord on how about
[29:14] how that the end
[29:16] comes about and basically this subject
[29:19] tonight they want to speak for just a
[29:21] little while
[29:22] i mean it's going to have to do with how
[29:24] that
[29:26] the prophet of god preached a message he
[29:28] called it the world
[29:30] falling apart how the world was falling
[29:32] apart we realized that was way back in
[29:34] the 60s
[29:35] maybe this maybe even a time or two in
[29:37] the 50s that he mentioned it
[29:39] so long ago that he preached on
[29:41] something called the world that it's
[29:43] falling apart
[29:45] now one reason i re read that in hebrews
[29:48] we'll pick that up hebrews there
[29:49] it talks about how that uh how that
[29:53] the the that the worlds were framed
[29:56] by the word of god so that the things
[29:59] which are seen
[30:00] were not made of things which do appear
[30:03] amen
[30:04] you go back to genesis 1 you can find
[30:06] where it says you know in the beginning
[30:08] god
[30:09] created the heavens and the earth and we
[30:11] know that that
[30:12] he created it by speaking the word of
[30:15] god
[30:17] amen and so god's word
[30:21] amen just uh you know whether it's
[30:25] this body here whether it's what you're
[30:28] standing on whether you're sitting
[30:30] everything that you see that's material
[30:33] was at one time
[30:34] not material in other words it was
[30:37] gasses
[30:38] and right now right gases it went back
[30:40] to different things that's
[30:42] even invisible in other words he made
[30:44] things
[30:45] from things that were not seen and so it
[30:48] comes from the invisible and so forth
[30:50] and he speaks those all of those
[30:52] chemicals and the different things that
[30:54] actually
[30:55] create something and he made them things
[30:57] come together so we find out that
[30:59] whenever god says something it
[31:01] it begins to frame it begins to frame
[31:04] things together
[31:05] it begins to hold things together it
[31:07] begins to make things
[31:09] it molds things it shapes things it
[31:12] and it and it brings a structure to
[31:15] things
[31:16] everything about god's word brings
[31:18] structure now remember this
[31:20] that satan absolutely his whole
[31:23] objective
[31:24] is to destroy whatever god has created
[31:28] whatever god has made
[31:30] his business is to tear it apart
[31:33] to take that frame and tear it apart it
[31:36] doesn't matter what it is
[31:38] amen and the way i come to thinking
[31:40] about this i got to thinking about
[31:42] where we're at in the world we look at
[31:44] where we're at the world we realize that
[31:46] where we're at in the world is at the
[31:48] end
[31:49] right we're at the end how many times
[31:52] the prophecy we're at the end we're at
[31:53] the end
[31:53] is that right and so we know that we're
[31:55] living in the end time
[31:57] in other words we're in the time of
[32:01] the end doesn't matter what it is and
[32:03] and you know
[32:05] in this you know many stories many books
[32:07] and many different things
[32:08] uh you might have a good story you might
[32:11] have a good book that you read that has
[32:12] a happy ending
[32:14] and all right a good ending you know but
[32:16] we know but for this world
[32:18] for uh those who are left in this world
[32:21] the end is not going to be a happy
[32:23] ending
[32:25] ah there's going to be weeping and
[32:26] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[32:28] now now if you'll notice here i don't
[32:30] know if i even finished that scripture
[32:32] in matthew
[32:32] but he talked about how that you know
[32:34] the tares are to be gathered together
[32:37] and to be burned in the fire so shall
[32:39] the end of this world be
[32:41] so we know that the end of this world
[32:43] has got a fire
[32:45] amen that is waiting for them but now we
[32:48] know that for the believer
[32:49] amen for the christian that's not our
[32:52] story
[32:55] aren't you glad for it i'm glad that
[32:57] that's not our story because if we
[32:59] would look for amen if we were looking
[33:01] here amen just for what's going to
[33:03] happen here
[33:04] like in peter i believe it was i'll just
[33:07] go ahead and read that quick over and
[33:08] peter it talks about how that
[33:10] the heavens and the earth which are now
[33:12] let me go back a little bit because i
[33:13] want to pull one subtle thought here
[33:15] notice here um in verse
[33:18] [Music]
[33:19] 5 of chapter 3 ii peter it says and
[33:22] this they are willingly ignorant of that
[33:25] by the word of god the heavens
[33:27] were of old amen now i'm going to
[33:32] jump down before we read the rest of
[33:33] that verse verse 7 it says
[33:35] and but the heavens and the earth which
[33:38] are now
[33:39] by the same word are kept
[33:43] in store right so it talks about
[33:47] they're ignorant that by the word of god
[33:49] the heavens and the earth was of old in
[33:51] other words the very word
[33:53] that created the heavens and the earth
[33:55] in the first place
[33:57] that same word is still holding
[34:00] the present time world together but it's
[34:03] reserved unto fire i mean believes it's
[34:06] still held together
[34:08] the universe is saw everything is still
[34:10] held together
[34:11] by the word of god praise the lord
[34:15] and so it says the word of god the
[34:17] heavens were of old and the earth
[34:19] standing out of the water
[34:20] and into water whereby the world that
[34:22] then was being overflight with water
[34:24] perished
[34:25] but the heavens and the earth which are
[34:26] now by the same word are kept
[34:29] in store reserved until against the god
[34:32] a day of judgment and condition of
[34:34] ungodly men
[34:36] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[34:38] thing that one day is with the lord is a
[34:40] thousand years and a thousand years is
[34:42] one day
[34:43] the lord is not conscious is not slack
[34:46] concerning his promise
[34:48] as some men count slackness but his
[34:50] long-suffering to us
[34:51] word not willing that any should perish
[34:54] but that all should come to repentance
[34:56] but the day of the lord will come as a
[34:58] thief in the night when which the
[34:59] heavens shall pass away with a great
[35:01] noise
[35:02] amen and the elements shall melt with
[35:04] fervent heat the earth also
[35:06] and the works that are therein shall be
[35:08] burned up
[35:10] seeing that that all these things shall
[35:12] be dissolved what manner of persons
[35:14] ought to ought to be
[35:15] in all holy conversation and godliness
[35:18] amen looking looking for and hasting
[35:21] unto the coming of the
[35:22] day of god wherein the heavens being on
[35:25] fire shall be dissolved
[35:26] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[35:28] heat and i like this next part
[35:30] because what i was saying is this what i
[35:32] just now read
[35:34] is what the majority of the people of
[35:36] the world
[35:37] has to look forward to and this is what
[35:40] they are looking for
[35:42] and we also know that it is coming but
[35:44] this next verse i really like because
[35:46] nevertheless we amen
[35:49] and this is not our final destination
[35:52] this is not
[35:52] our goal it had to get burned up with
[35:56] uh unquenchable fire we're not part of
[35:59] the terrors that are being bundled
[36:00] together and burnt
[36:02] is that right but it says nevertheless
[36:05] we
[36:05] according to his promise look for what
[36:09] a new heavens and a new earth
[36:12] were indwelleth righteousness
[36:15] how many believes that when you get over
[36:17] there when we get over there in the new
[36:19] heavens and the new earth
[36:20] amen there's going to be birds flying
[36:22] through the air
[36:24] amen it's going to be beautiful there's
[36:26] going to be evergreen trees
[36:28] and man it's going to be a absolute
[36:30] paradise there'll be never
[36:32] never any feebleness of old age there's
[36:34] not going to be any
[36:35] pains no there's not going to be any
[36:38] kind of weakness whatsoever it'll be
[36:40] perfect
[36:41] and i got to thinking about when i read
[36:42] that scripture about him in the heavens
[36:44] and the earth that we're looking for
[36:46] because
[36:46] even in the last few days if y'all
[36:49] probably at your house also you probably
[36:51] found a lot of dead birds
[36:53] anybody find dead birds
[36:56] i would sit by my water trough and my
[36:58] feeding truffle for the animals and
[37:00] there'd be a dove and sitting there
[37:02] still alive and i just went right over
[37:04] there and just
[37:05] wrapped it picked it right up it was
[37:07] still alive took it in the house for
[37:08] about
[37:09] 20 minutes 30 minute well it was more
[37:11] than that i guess a couple hours
[37:12] kept it in there and warmed it up really
[37:14] good amen and then we
[37:16] let it go and it flew enough you know
[37:19] and then we found many of them and then
[37:21] if we let it fly and fly out under a
[37:23] trailer and
[37:24] before night i said well i better go get
[37:26] that bird i don't think it'll survive
[37:27] sure enough it didn't because i didn't
[37:28] go get it but
[37:30] anyway then days later we found a dead
[37:32] bird over here we'd find dead birds
[37:34] there
[37:35] just and i thought man you know it's not
[37:36] going to be any of that over there
[37:38] i'm glad that there's not going to be
[37:40] any death no pain no sorrow over there
[37:43] amen so we look for heavens and a new
[37:45] earth amen not just for the destruction
[37:47] of this world
[37:48] now let's get back on our subject what
[37:50] really brought me to this
[37:51] was thinking about how that you know the
[37:54] present time
[37:55] in our politics and i don't ever preach
[37:58] on politics trying to give anybody hope
[37:59] we know that's not the case
[38:01] but we can certainly look at our
[38:02] politics we can look at
[38:04] what's going with our politics in our
[38:06] world and see
[38:07] kind of you know it can kind of give us
[38:09] a a little sign of where we're at
[38:12] isn't that right to see just where we're
[38:14] at spiritually
[38:15] where the church is where we are in time
[38:18] and then i got to thinking about how
[38:20] that
[38:20] you know it's they're having a hard time
[38:23] getting the teachers to go back to
[38:24] school to open up even though the
[38:26] science
[38:26] is there finally said hey go open up
[38:28] it's okay
[38:29] you know right even though they have the
[38:31] okay they still really don't want to do
[38:33] it
[38:34] i thought about i thought about that i
[38:35] thought why won't people want to go back
[38:37] and i thought about what brother branham
[38:39] said he says you know education
[38:41] he says that even it is at its end
[38:45] and i got to thinking about the end this
[38:47] is how i come across my subject thinking
[38:49] about
[38:49] how that it's the end of these things
[38:52] the end of things
[38:54] all right so let me just read this quote
[38:56] brother ben he says listen
[38:58] education is at the end juvenile
[39:01] delinquency is at the end and so forth
[39:03] children he says there's no hopes for
[39:05] children anymore they're done going
[39:06] insane
[39:07] and you can't hardly have no education
[39:10] you can't hardly go down here at the
[39:12] school and have a kid to get with an
[39:13] education
[39:14] he said because he's twofold more a
[39:17] child of hell
[39:18] when he comes out then when he goes in
[39:21] think about when this was way back in 58
[39:24] i believe it was
[39:26] amen listen to what he says
[39:29] he says we lost about 2 000 teachers or
[39:31] 20 000 teachers last year i don't blame
[39:33] them
[39:34] i wouldn't want to do their job either
[39:35] so you teachers i'm sure you've got a
[39:37] rough job
[39:38] no notice he says and give him that we
[39:40] got signs of give college kids
[39:42] education sure they need it i mean those
[39:45] we give them a education we give them
[39:47] all the money for an education
[39:49] they got their education and now they're
[39:51] ready to start their life with a bill of
[39:53] 100 200 000.
[39:56] i don't know about you but i'd start out
[39:58] depressed when you
[40:01] i gotta go to mcdonald's you know and
[40:02] make i can't pay for this you know
[40:05] now we're talking about figure forgiving
[40:07] their debt and all this other stuff and
[40:08] what's real smart of us
[40:10] to get him in that kind of debt the
[40:11] first place and i wasn't
[40:13] but anyway that's besides the point but
[40:15] listen she talks about give them an
[40:17] education
[40:18] they need it but the devil's got him the
[40:20] devil's got our kids
[40:21] he says man it used to be that they just
[40:23] go out there and do something on
[40:24] halloween night this that or the other
[40:27] to be mean or whatever but now they've
[40:29] gone completely
[40:30] insane they'll shoot you they'll kill
[40:32] you
[40:33] how true that is today isn't that the
[40:35] truth of our you know because it's
[40:37] you know things are just coming to an
[40:39] end they're insane that's right
[40:41] oh my poison you are anything and
[40:43] brother bam says and that's the next
[40:45] generation
[40:46] he mentions politics he says boy it
[40:49] doesn't matter if it's republican
[40:50] democrat
[40:51] what it is he says it is rotten to the
[40:54] car
[40:55] it's at its end politics he says is at
[40:58] the end
[41:00] dictators is wrong politics is wrong
[41:03] oh my he says why didn't they stay with
[41:05] a godly king
[41:06] like god get like that god gave david or
[41:09] something you know
[41:10] the great lord of england said when this
[41:13] democracy was formed i guess america
[41:15] said it's all right now but it'll come
[41:19] time
[41:19] he said that it'll be nothing he says
[41:22] it'll be
[41:23] all sales and no anchor
[41:26] how many believes that's a prophecy that
[41:28] was not king of england
[41:29] he knew exactly what he was talking
[41:31] about that's brother man says that's
[41:32] exactly right and you and i are living
[41:34] in that hour
[41:36] where constitution don't mean anything
[41:38] it's just all
[41:39] sales this is go let's just go you know
[41:42] and no anchor
[41:44] amen so we're living in the end of
[41:46] politics the end of the world
[41:48] end of time any close to how many
[41:50] believers are getting close to
[41:52] where it says and even time shall be no
[41:54] more
[41:56] amen so we're living at the end of
[41:58] things
[41:59] you know and he says dictatorships and
[42:01] so forth
[42:02] listen to what he says now juvenile
[42:05] parents uh
[42:06] brother bam he says he mentioned
[42:08] everything in another internet
[42:09] um he says you know
[42:13] and we find out that there's not too
[42:14] much history that should
[42:16] gets even written because i don't think
[42:17] it'll ever be used
[42:19] both of these great events are running
[42:21] in a shallow water that's right
[42:23] we're running in a national crisis
[42:25] national security all of that is running
[42:27] into shallow waters our lord predicted
[42:30] such a time to come that there be unrest
[42:32] among nations perplex of time
[42:34] distress between the nations we've tried
[42:36] everything
[42:37] seemingly human battle to make it just a
[42:39] little bit longer but
[42:41] it is running out he says home life is
[42:45] running out
[42:47] marriages is running out you can't
[42:49] hardly have marriages
[42:51] anymore ain't nobody believes in
[42:53] sticking together until the end till
[42:55] death do you part
[42:56] it's until the next problem do you part
[43:00] now right just every little whim just
[43:02] little this out of the other
[43:04] but used to be dead have to work things
[43:06] out but now
[43:08] and they've got that then they don't
[43:10] even marry anymore people don't even
[43:11] marry anymore
[43:13] amen oh my but everything
[43:16] is at an end but the battle says child
[43:19] bearings at an end
[43:20] womanhood is at an end why they'll
[43:23] practice birth control and they don't
[43:24] want any kids
[43:26] they want little dogs the little dogs
[43:28] have taken their place
[43:30] amen how many of the dog business is
[43:32] good
[43:33] that's right people like people love
[43:35] dogs
[43:36] but they don't want to raise a child to
[43:38] the nur to god
[43:40] amen so just look at it i mean i'm wrong
[43:43] with having a dog but listen
[43:44] amen people don't want kids anymore
[43:47] people don't want to have a home anymore
[43:49] amen oh my so he also said you know that
[43:53] uh you know it used to be he can
[43:55] remember the time he says he ain't all
[43:57] that old
[43:57] yet but he says he remembers the time
[44:00] amen people used to have church when we
[44:02] have church
[44:03] my sisters and different ones people
[44:05] walk yeah
[44:06] praise the lord tears coming down their
[44:09] eyes
[44:10] you know and there was under such power
[44:12] the holy ghost
[44:13] amen they have an altar call and boy
[44:14] they get to pray and
[44:16] one of their children perhaps come up
[44:18] there and pray amen them sisters they
[44:20] come on day pray with that person until
[44:22] they come through and god some you don't
[44:23] see that anymore
[44:26] church entity he says even church is
[44:28] coming to an end he says
[44:29] the formal church is coming to an end
[44:31] because
[44:32] everything has come into it and i
[44:34] thought well that ain't nothing but the
[44:36] truth look at the church world out there
[44:38] how it's come all the way down to heaven
[44:40] homosexual preachers
[44:42] i mean you can't get in the word than
[44:43] that and it reminded me of this this is
[44:47] what i thought about when i
[44:48] began to think about the end and what
[44:50] brings about the end because
[44:51] you know if and that is it's going to be
[44:53] what we call a moral fabric
[44:56] and i think about a fabric a moral
[44:58] fabric and once people lose their
[44:59] morality
[45:01] amen they just about lose everything
[45:04] and if you remember brother bam talked
[45:05] about he says when they used to
[45:08] control what kind of songs that people
[45:10] would listen to
[45:11] and it wouldn't be nice to think about
[45:13] they used to control what kind of a song
[45:15] or the radio because that place they
[45:17] could say
[45:18] could play and he says that they come
[45:20] out
[45:22] something about an immoral uh song about
[45:24] the girls rolling down the little
[45:25] leagues or something just a little
[45:28] something don't seem much but that was
[45:30] the beginning of it
[45:32] they let that slip through and then all
[45:34] of a sudden it got worse and worse and
[45:36] worse and look where it is today
[45:39] and you know the way that things come to
[45:41] an end the way that things come apart
[45:44] amen amen it doesn't matter what it is
[45:47] and you don't realize
[45:48] that coming to church on this wednesday
[45:51] night
[45:52] is part of the structure that holds your
[45:55] life together god
[45:58] is what holds your life together the
[46:01] word of god is what holds your life
[46:03] together because get away from it for a
[46:04] minute
[46:05] and then get away from it a little bit
[46:07] to find out how much
[46:09] amen you begin to fall apart even jesus
[46:12] says abiding me and my word inviting you
[46:14] otherwise you're going to wither away is
[46:17] that right otherwise you're going to
[46:18] wither away
[46:19] think about all the people even around
[46:21] this message says i've absolutely just
[46:23] withered away
[46:25] even jesus said there become many come
[46:27] that fall by the wayside
[46:29] amen but it's got to be more there's got
[46:31] to be something that happens down on the
[46:33] inside here
[46:34] amen that causes you not to come apart
[46:38] amen i believe but the baby says that
[46:40] you can the church book i believe it was
[46:42] he talked about he says whether it's
[46:44] rome whether it was greece
[46:45] or whatever it was he says that he can
[46:48] take you back
[46:49] and he can show you that a woman was the
[46:51] cause of the fall of all of it
[46:53] of every nation a woman and when you
[46:57] think about what
[46:58] the pornography and the lust and the
[47:01] pollution that this nation allow
[47:02] think of how that it demoralizes our men
[47:05] it demoralizes our kids it demoralizes
[47:08] the whole world
[47:09] and then it absolutely kills them so to
[47:11] speak
[47:12] and then it's like you can see how it's
[47:14] a downfall how many know even eve was
[47:16] the downfall of the whole world
[47:18] it's an instrument that the devil uses
[47:21] amen but think about the morality
[47:23] everything that is
[47:24] has been torn down whether it's families
[47:28] amen family says it's torn down
[47:31] nation that it's been torn down all
[47:33] these different things
[47:34] that's come apart and then it reminded
[47:36] me that
[47:37] it used to be that this nation was a
[47:40] pretty good nation i mean because we had
[47:42] we still had morality you know right we
[47:45] still had
[47:46] even the sinners we still had so much of
[47:48] god
[47:49] but we weren't the sinners that we are
[47:51] now today
[47:54] because i know that even brother bam
[47:55] said that it was because
[47:57] that the churches didn't hold their
[47:59] standard
[48:01] that the floods came on in because if
[48:04] every church hello if every church would
[48:06] hold their standard
[48:08] it'd be a different story but they
[48:10] haven't
[48:12] but so we think about that we think
[48:13] about i think about a
[48:15] piece of cloth i don't know if anybody
[48:18] any of y'all have ever bought a new
[48:19] shirt
[48:20] or a new blouse or a new disc that or
[48:21] the other and you got a little pick in
[48:23] it
[48:25] you got a little something in it right
[48:27] and then you try to
[48:28] you know or you have a loose thread or
[48:30] something and you go to pull them on
[48:32] that
[48:33] and did you ever watch that thing just
[48:35] go right through all of that line just
[48:37] goes way down you're like ruined right
[48:41] it's all messed up just from that little
[48:45] pig
[48:47] and then when you have let's say you
[48:48] have like an along with a zipper or
[48:50] something like that your seam
[48:52] and then you get a thread that is loose
[48:54] and you go to pull on that thread out
[48:56] and all of a sudden just comes right
[48:58] apart well that's exactly what's
[49:00] happened
[49:01] with a nation that's what happened with
[49:03] church that's what happens with an
[49:05] individual when satan comes in there and
[49:07] he picks that thread apart
[49:09] that god has put together how many knows
[49:12] god had the whole world together
[49:13] he had adam and eve in a garden of eden
[49:16] in perfect life but satan come
[49:20] and got a little pick on eve he just
[49:23] messed one little thread up
[49:25] isn't that right he got one little place
[49:28] that he got in
[49:29] and it spiraled and messed the whole
[49:32] thing up
[49:33] all of creation went down with it amen
[49:36] and i'll tell you what you know
[49:37] every all of those is put together in
[49:38] such a way that you keep too many of
[49:40] those threads out
[49:41] and it's just a pile of junk and that's
[49:44] the way it is in our life that's the way
[49:46] it has been church life it's been in
[49:48] this nation
[49:49] amen a little pig a little threat and
[49:51] the fabric of society
[49:53] has absolutely completely come apart
[49:57] not by some great thing but just by one
[49:59] little thing
[50:01] how many knows for you to lose your
[50:03] relationship with the lord
[50:04] and for you to backslide and for you to
[50:07] get cold on god
[50:08] and for you to lose the holy ghost it
[50:10] just takes one little
[50:12] thing brother bam says
[50:15] perhaps a temper
[50:18] lose your temper one time
[50:23] how many kept the holy ghost even right
[50:25] after your temper
[50:26] don't raise your hand because i beg to
[50:28] differ with you
[50:30] amen the second that you choose to lose
[50:33] your
[50:33] temper huh you kind of have to choose
[50:36] that
[50:38] am i going to lose my temper i'm gonna
[50:39] keep my cool
[50:41] and it might it might just trigger quick
[50:43] it doesn't take much you know
[50:45] but the second you lose your temper the
[50:47] holy ghost is gone
[50:50] that's why the wrath of man the bible
[50:53] says never works the righteousness of
[50:55] god
[50:58] but the thing of it is and that begins
[51:00] what is it if you don't make that right
[51:02] it begins to unravel i mean there's a
[51:05] fuss between a husband and wife
[51:07] if you don't make that right it'll keep
[51:09] unraveling
[51:11] the devil loves to get between a husband
[51:13] and wife between
[51:14] a brother and a sister how many knows
[51:17] that's why we have so much family
[51:19] problems
[51:20] is because they get away from the word
[51:22] of god
[51:24] they get away from the love of god
[51:28] amen i mean believes that god is in a
[51:30] restoring business
[51:33] restoring families he doesn't want us to
[51:35] end up aiming our families for torn
[51:38] apart
[51:38] he don't want friendships tore apart he
[51:40] don't want a church tore apart
[51:42] he don't want all these things lost and
[51:44] frazzled and coming apart at the seams
[51:48] people can't come apart at the seams
[51:50] when they get away from
[51:51] prayer you don't realize how important
[51:53] prayer and reading your bible
[51:55] is i watched a little documentary on
[52:01] the welsh revival and the 1909 revival
[52:05] the azusa street revival
[52:07] and they got to talking about some of
[52:08] these men that became evangelists and so
[52:10] forth
[52:10] that they would pray for three hours a
[52:12] day and then they would really dedicate
[52:14] themselves to six to seven hours a day
[52:17] to pray
[52:20] hello and i thought wow what kind of
[52:23] christian am i where am i
[52:24] at i got 10 15 minutes
[52:28] they were four or fives how did they
[52:30] stay there that long
[52:32] just but they would and then he got to
[52:34] talking about he says you know you could
[52:36] tell
[52:36] you know it used to be on a wednesday
[52:38] night they said that man it wasn't hard
[52:40] for people to stand outside and
[52:43] man come together on a wednesday night
[52:45] even
[52:46] but if they ain't on too much fire he
[52:49] says
[52:49] it's hard to get people out on the
[52:50] wednesday night
[52:52] huh but the revival i'd like something
[52:55] else i said you know revival is not
[52:57] something you work up
[52:59] a revival is something that has to come
[53:01] down from above
[53:02] and i like what he said this is one of
[53:04] the things he said that i really like he
[53:05] says
[53:06] you know what brings it the only thing
[53:08] he can know
[53:09] that really brings it is somebody that's
[53:12] completely
[53:13] surrendered to god
[53:17] a complete surrender to god will bring a
[53:19] revival
[53:21] how many believes that you want a
[53:23] revival in your life
[53:25] completely surrender to god you just say
[53:28] well that's easy no not so much
[53:30] how about giving him seven eight hours a
[53:32] day surrender that much to him find out
[53:34] what happened
[53:36] that's right tell your boss hey can i
[53:37] have off tomorrow i would like to pray
[53:39] all day
[53:41] huh
[53:47] are you more worried about making money
[53:50] see
[53:51] now i asked myself how surrender am i
[53:53] really you look at how surrendered those
[53:55] folks were
[53:55] back there that really got a hold of god
[53:57] and god began to do something
[53:58] and did great miracles and all of these
[54:01] revivals a revival with the holy spirit
[54:03] the anointing
[54:04] when he comes down and that's what makes
[54:05] a difference amen amen he says they
[54:07] showed a whole picture of
[54:08] a whole isle of crutches where people
[54:10] were healed
[54:12] amen the power of god come down how many
[54:15] like to see that
[54:17] that's right but see god is in the
[54:19] business of keeping things together
[54:21] keeping the fabric of your life your
[54:24] very
[54:25] being together how many know that eve
[54:28] had to taste death adam had to taste
[54:31] death because they let that little
[54:34] fabric
[54:35] that nick and that pick in their life
[54:38] amen to completely ruin the picture
[54:41] amen just that little
[54:45] bit and it took them all the way to
[54:48] where they were
[54:51] and here we are at the end of the world
[54:53] not just this nation
[54:54] i mean knows that england is as bad as
[54:57] we are
[54:59] italy and france they had their revival
[55:01] way back
[55:02] right and they turned down their revival
[55:05] and they became wicked and
[55:07] it went from italy i believe it was
[55:09] landed in hollywood
[55:10] and from hollywood it spread all across
[55:12] our nation hello
[55:15] but nevertheless aren't you glad that in
[55:17] this evil age that we're living in it is
[55:19] time
[55:20] of the end of everything it's really not
[55:22] in other words it just
[55:23] can't go on much longer how many knows
[55:26] it just can't go on much longer
[55:30] there's only one thing to do and that is
[55:32] to be ready for the coming of the lord
[55:34] praise the lord that's what i'm looking
[55:37] for
[55:38] and we look first of all i got to
[55:40] thinking about this and it says well
[55:41] lord
[55:42] if truly if it's your word if it's god's
[55:45] word
[55:46] if it's god's presence that keeps your
[55:49] life together
[55:50] it keeps your marriage together it keeps
[55:53] you together as a person
[55:56] huh because you can't live in
[55:59] condemnation
[56:01] you can't live in sin and be complete
[56:04] you'll have all kinds of inferior
[56:06] complexes
[56:07] in other words you know you're not right
[56:09] you're not going to be happy
[56:12] somebody else don't treat you just right
[56:13] yeah you're going to really let them
[56:15] know
[56:17] huh and so you're going to be short with
[56:21] people
[56:22] you're going to have falling outs with
[56:23] people
[56:24] [Music]
[56:25] falling out with your wife your husband
[56:27] your neighbor your dog
[56:29] ain't no telling who you're gonna kick
[56:32] that's right because you get away from
[56:34] god
[56:35] amen your wife is gonna be make you
[56:38] happy anymore your husband's not good
[56:39] enough for you anymore
[56:42] amen the church ain't good enough god
[56:44] ain't good well you just get
[56:46] it gets way out of there is that right
[56:48] on and on
[56:51] but the sweetness of the holy spirit
[56:52] notice what what the prophet brought us
[56:55] notice what the bible gives us
[56:57] amen in first peter i believe it is the
[57:00] first chapter it talks about
[57:01] how that you're to add to your faith
[57:04] virtue and add to virtue knowledge
[57:07] in other words begin to allow those
[57:08] threads the only one that can bring them
[57:10] threads
[57:11] back together and fix that shirt fix
[57:14] that
[57:14] piece of cloth fix that fabric to bring
[57:17] those things back together is the holy
[57:19] spirit
[57:20] the only thing that brings family back
[57:22] together is the holy spirit
[57:24] the only thing that can bring a church
[57:26] back together is the holy spirit
[57:28] individuals back together it's the holy
[57:31] spirit
[57:31] it's god it's his word it holds it all
[57:35] together and you get away from that
[57:40] it all falls apart remember when jesus
[57:43] left mary's house
[57:46] trouble set in lazarus got sick
[57:49] and died and he brother brad amused the
[57:52] illustration he says when jesus leaves
[57:54] your house
[57:55] trouble sets in troubles
[57:58] on the road when you leave christ
[58:02] when he leaves your house amen
[58:07] and that's exactly what god has done
[58:09] with us as a nation
[58:12] because we couldn't have been i believe
[58:14] if i'm not wrong
[58:16] we were the greatest nation in one of
[58:19] the
[58:19] some of the history of the world
[58:22] huh of the history of the world one of
[58:25] the greatest nations
[58:27] parallel with israel that couldn't be
[58:29] defeated
[58:30] huh but we were
[58:33] in respect to god we honored god
[58:37] that right and when we begin to dishonor
[58:40] god
[58:41] get away from god god left us
[58:48] you know isn't it something how that
[58:50] we're supposed to have all these
[58:51] missiles
[58:52] we're supposed to have all this defense
[58:56] but it don't mean a thing they're going
[58:58] to get through
[59:00] they're going to get through and even
[59:01] brother bam says talking about war
[59:04] he says we used to take uh
[59:07] what did he how did he use it
[59:10] we used to beat one another over the
[59:12] head with stone axes he said
[59:14] stone axes which
[59:17] sharpen big old stones we tie it to a
[59:20] stick
[59:21] and we go to war huh that's how we used
[59:24] to do it
[59:25] he says and then they shot bows and
[59:27] arrows and then right
[59:30] then they got rifles then they got
[59:31] machine guns and they're 88's
[59:34] how many knows our tanks didn't stand a
[59:37] chance against their 88s
[59:39] they gave us a rough way to go that's
[59:41] right
[59:43] then they throwed hand grenades and
[59:44] poison gas
[59:46] but now they got a hydrogen bomb
[59:49] and now guess what you can't have war
[59:52] anymore
[59:53] how many knows how many times have we
[59:55] went to russia and fought with russia
[59:58] never in their home time was always over
[59:59] in some other country where they didn't
[1:00:01] have any
[1:00:02] nukes because you can't fight war when
[1:00:05] people
[1:00:07] people's got nukes because it's totally
[1:00:09] annihilation
[1:00:11] but says you can't have war anymore
[1:00:13] because now the whole thing would be
[1:00:15] blow to pieces
[1:00:16] and he says and it'll take just one
[1:00:18] trigger from one of those little nations
[1:00:20] that have it
[1:00:21] to start the whole thing and he said it
[1:00:23] could be all
[1:00:24] within three minutes or so he says if
[1:00:26] the whole world could end in just about
[1:00:28] that time it's
[1:00:29] all begun but aren't you glad to know
[1:00:32] the one that is the beginning
[1:00:33] and the end remember this when noah's
[1:00:36] world ended
[1:00:37] god had his hand in it when sodom and
[1:00:40] gomorrah when they ended
[1:00:42] god had his hand in it and i'll tell you
[1:00:44] this god's going to have his hand
[1:00:46] in the end of this world amen just when
[1:00:50] they mean they're not going to do it
[1:00:51] until
[1:00:52] god allows it to happen just how it'll
[1:00:54] be i don't know
[1:00:55] but i do know that it's going to burn
[1:00:57] with fervent heat
[1:00:59] but not for you and me from you and me i
[1:01:01] truly believe that god is not
[1:01:04] you know for us education uh
[1:01:07] you know family is not an end for us
[1:01:10] church is not an it's not an end for us
[1:01:13] why because we still love the lord the
[1:01:16] holy spirit is still here
[1:01:17] because i'll tell you this once the holy
[1:01:19] spirit leaves you're gone
[1:01:22] it's all over when the holy spirit
[1:01:23] leaves and for the world it's going to
[1:01:25] be all over with
[1:01:27] when the holy spirit because god's going
[1:01:28] to take that blood out from around the
[1:01:30] world he'll look at the sin
[1:01:32] and he'll say i gotta clean this up this
[1:01:33] is too dirty to be in my presence
[1:01:38] but you know look as god
[1:01:42] god is working on each other a bride in
[1:01:45] the end time
[1:01:46] he believes that we're a part of that
[1:01:48] he's framing
[1:01:49] a church together and body together the
[1:01:52] bible talks in ephesians he says
[1:01:54] every joint fitly framed together works
[1:01:58] and is built up for a habitation
[1:02:01] of god god builds you together i mean he
[1:02:04] gets rid of all that loose things he
[1:02:06] gets rid of the world he gets rid of sin
[1:02:08] he gets rid of unbelief he gets it all
[1:02:10] out of there and he makes you strong he
[1:02:12] gives you
[1:02:12] love for your your neighbor love for
[1:02:15] your
[1:02:16] uh makes you love everybody
[1:02:20] how many knows that the one thing that
[1:02:22] really brings us together
[1:02:24] and then frames things together and it
[1:02:26] doesn't call it cause it to fall apart
[1:02:28] because the world is falling apart
[1:02:30] everything's falling apart
[1:02:32] but not not everything the people of god
[1:02:34] are not falling apart
[1:02:35] and one of the one of the main things
[1:02:38] that you got to have even as a christian
[1:02:40] amen that binds it all together and if
[1:02:42] you go back and listen to the message
[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:45] uh the statue of a perfect man he talks
[1:02:47] about faith god wants you to have faith
[1:02:49] he wants to have strength he brings
[1:02:51] gives you strength
[1:02:52] amen inner strength virtue went from
[1:02:55] jesus strength went from jesus
[1:02:59] let me just say something here if you
[1:03:01] don't think that the holy spirit
[1:03:03] actually makes you stronger
[1:03:06] it makes you feel better it gives you
[1:03:08] strength
[1:03:09] not just physical but also spirituals it
[1:03:11] gives you strength
[1:03:12] because without that spirit you're just
[1:03:15] a bunch of muscle
[1:03:17] a bunch of meat it's all really yard
[1:03:20] just dead meat
[1:03:21] but he wants you to have virtue want you
[1:03:23] to have strength he builds
[1:03:25] knowledge in you in order to know what's
[1:03:27] right and what's wrong
[1:03:29] isn't that right right godly knowledge
[1:03:31] to know the difference between right and
[1:03:32] wrong
[1:03:33] temperance amid temperance we're to be
[1:03:36] tempered
[1:03:37] by the holy spirit and that patience of
[1:03:40] course
[1:03:41] amen that's something we all probably
[1:03:42] need more of
[1:03:44] patience to wait on the lord because
[1:03:46] god's never in a hurry
[1:03:48] we're always the ones in the hurry dave
[1:03:51] abraham had to wait 25 years for his
[1:03:53] promise if you ask for something
[1:03:55] just believe god's gonna do it wait amen
[1:03:59] and listen if you believe that many of
[1:04:02] you're ever going to get healed
[1:04:03] amen folks i'm telling you i've had
[1:04:05] these things hit me here in the knee
[1:04:07] and i thought man it ain't never going
[1:04:08] to go away and hurt for weeks and weeks
[1:04:10] and weeks
[1:04:10] but i believe by his stripes i heal and
[1:04:12] it went away
[1:04:14] i've had a lot of things come and just
[1:04:16] believe the lord
[1:04:18] and go act like it ain't even hurting no
[1:04:20] more
[1:04:21] it ain't even there brother man says
[1:04:22] just believe it and watch out
[1:04:24] god will take care of it but if you
[1:04:26] always say oh
[1:04:27] it didn't happen no you done lost it
[1:04:29] probably already you know
[1:04:30] no i still feel it now no go on as
[1:04:33] though it's done already
[1:04:35] and i be patient on the lord then
[1:04:38] godliness you're coming up and you're
[1:04:40] looking a whole lot like jesus did
[1:04:42] and that right and one of the last
[1:04:46] things that people forget to do and that
[1:04:48] is just to be friendly
[1:04:51] how many knows the holy ghost will make
[1:04:53] a gentleman out of you
[1:04:55] he'll make a real lady out of you
[1:04:57] because let's admit it
[1:05:00] how many remembers there's uh the
[1:05:02] hatfields and mccoys we're all
[1:05:04] we are all the hatfields and the mccoys
[1:05:06] oh yeah we're we're
[1:05:08] well i was so bad i was terrible i
[1:05:10] robbed banks you know on this side or
[1:05:12] the other and i was the sheriff that
[1:05:13] shot y'all you know and
[1:05:15] i was a bad white or everybody was bad
[1:05:17] you know but really when you was in your
[1:05:19] old flesh
[1:05:20] it wasn't worth much at all
[1:05:24] you were without god your life began to
[1:05:27] come
[1:05:28] together is when according to peter
[1:05:31] there he says
[1:05:32] we have been born not by the will of the
[1:05:35] flesh but
[1:05:36] by the word of god when you're born
[1:05:38] again
[1:05:39] then you become a man back then it was
[1:05:42] just terrible you
[1:05:43] i i acted terrible when i was in the
[1:05:45] world
[1:05:47] i didn't have more responsibility i
[1:05:49] would run my tags out and never pay
[1:05:51] hardly for a
[1:05:52] year i only got insurance because you'd
[1:05:55] go to jail almost if you didn't
[1:05:57] negligent i don't want to go on further
[1:05:59] i ain't going to tell you i am more of
[1:06:00] my fault but i
[1:06:01] you know it's terrible not until you
[1:06:03] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:06:05] did you begin to have more respect
[1:06:09] more more more more about you
[1:06:12] amen that's what god's doing how many
[1:06:14] believes that
[1:06:15] it'll make a man out of you it'll make
[1:06:17] you sweet and kind where you as terrible
[1:06:19] before
[1:06:21] and that's what god's doing folks
[1:06:24] building it together
[1:06:26] getting the threads of your family to
[1:06:28] getting the threads of your friendship
[1:06:30] friendships hello
[1:06:33] and brothers and sisters and love now
[1:06:36] what i'm getting to i'm still getting to
[1:06:37] some notice how it says the brotherly
[1:06:39] love
[1:06:41] brotherly kindness the holy spirit is in
[1:06:44] between but the capstone of
[1:06:46] it all and brother bam talked about how
[1:06:48] that the holy spirit and the love of god
[1:06:50] is what welds it all together
[1:06:54] how many believes that love covers a
[1:06:56] multitude of sin
[1:06:58] love welds it all
[1:07:01] together the devil has got that
[1:07:04] got this to where it's all fallen apart
[1:07:08] i completely demolished homes marriages
[1:07:11] churches nations
[1:07:12] individuals hate the devil just totally
[1:07:15] demolishes
[1:07:16] but god and the love of god amen it
[1:07:19] brings us together
[1:07:21] over new york they used to say man
[1:07:23] people will go down the street and
[1:07:24] there'll be
[1:07:25] somebody laying cars maybe going by and
[1:07:28] splash monitor over him
[1:07:30] you know he's just there you know
[1:07:31] nobody'll have the courtesy to drag that
[1:07:34] man up against the building away from
[1:07:36] the
[1:07:36] old messy road er people won't help each
[1:07:40] other up there huh
[1:07:43] i've heard that i've heard they don't
[1:07:44] help him brother brown i don't know if
[1:07:45] you come from there you could probably
[1:07:46] tell us a story or two
[1:07:47] but people don't have no compassion for
[1:07:49] each other anymore
[1:07:50] but what does love do love brings and it

[1:08:35] here to tell you
[1:08:36] even your mind will stray even your mind
[1:08:38] will will go
[1:08:39] this way and that way if you don't stay
[1:08:41] in the holy spirit
[1:08:43] amen you'll get too busy to think about
[1:08:45] the things of the world
[1:08:46] and the cares of this world do you
[1:08:48] realize the bible says all that did we
[1:08:50] live
[1:08:51] all the delicacies that the antichrist
[1:08:54] system men
[1:08:54] he says a whole world partook of the
[1:08:57] delicacies
[1:08:58] of the antichrist we're living the world
[1:09:00] all kinds of delicacies
[1:09:02] and people are taking a part of more of
[1:09:03] the delicacies than they are
[1:09:05] the word of god amen
[1:09:10] but i don't know about you but i just
[1:09:11] want my mind i want my heart on my soul
[1:09:13] i want god to bring everything together
[1:09:16] hold me together
[1:09:18] hold my family together hold my
[1:09:20] grandchildren together
[1:09:22] amen to keep it together not let it fall
[1:09:26] apart
[1:09:27] because if the whole world which it has
[1:09:29] already fallen apart
[1:09:30] and it's come to an end but there's a
[1:09:34] group of people
[1:09:35] that's getting ready amen getting ready
[1:09:38] to leave let me finish with the quote we
[1:09:39] won't keep you long
[1:09:42] i say this in closing there's one more
[1:09:45] remark i want to make
[1:09:47] he's just a real church has so much to
[1:09:51] live for
[1:09:51] now amen but it looks like there's just
[1:09:55] nothing to live for
[1:09:57] there isn't down here for the world
[1:10:01] this is their climax this is the climax
[1:10:03] for the world
[1:10:06] how many knows that a lot of states are
[1:10:08] talking about legalizing
[1:10:10] all drugs
[1:10:14] they went from whispering about
[1:10:15] legalizing marijuana right
[1:10:18] now all drugs all sales no anger
[1:10:22] no right why because satan's eating he
[1:10:25] wants to do whatever he wants
[1:10:29] whatever he wants that's what he wants
[1:10:31] to do and that's the world
[1:10:34] but listen while this is the climax this
[1:10:38] is the climax of satan's
[1:10:39] eden it's really the hardest time
[1:10:43] and the lowest time as far as you and i
[1:10:46] in this world because what we don't fit
[1:10:50] in here
[1:10:52] i believe we don't fit in here we don't
[1:10:55] belong here
[1:10:59] well aren't you glad there's not going
[1:11:00] to be all this perversion there's not
[1:11:02] going to be all this sin over on the
[1:11:04] other side
[1:11:05] all that will be gone no sickness no
[1:11:08] death no sin
[1:11:10] no unbelief all the unbelievers will be
[1:11:13] far away
[1:11:14] all the skeptics will be absent on that
[1:11:17] day
[1:11:20] for you and me
[1:11:23] it's the rising of the sun it's good
[1:11:26] morning
[1:11:27] shalom
[1:11:35] for you and me
[1:11:41] after these things i saw another angel
[1:11:45] come down from heaven heaven having
[1:11:48] great power
[1:11:52] and the earth was lightened with his
[1:11:56] glory
[1:11:58] i mean believes that happened in our day
[1:12:01] the whole earth
[1:12:02] india south africa america
[1:12:04] jeffersonville
[1:12:05] the whole earth was lightened with the
[1:12:08] glory
[1:12:09] and power of almighty god god used the
[1:12:12] prophet of god
[1:12:13] so much until those who were around him
[1:12:16] the things that happened in the
[1:12:17] supernatural that happened
[1:12:18] they can't quit talking about it
[1:12:21] phenomenal
[1:12:22] beyond imagination things happen here
[1:12:25] and there and god just did the
[1:12:27] supernatural
[1:12:28] unlike he has done for ages
[1:12:32] and that right
[1:12:36] how many truckloads of constant
[1:12:38] stretchers was it
[1:12:41] i forget how many truckloads all kinds
[1:12:43] of truck boats going through
[1:12:44] town right through downtown and they
[1:12:45] were all and the whole city
[1:12:47] 500 000 the whole city shut down and
[1:12:50] they were marching down things singing
[1:12:52] only believe only believe all things are
[1:12:54] possible
[1:12:55] the whole earth was lightened with the
[1:12:57] power and glory of a god
[1:13:00] just before the destruction before the
[1:13:02] end of all these things
[1:13:04] god came down and lightened the earth
[1:13:05] with his glory
[1:13:08] let him know let the whole world that
[1:13:10] know
[1:13:11] that yes god is real yes god
[1:13:14] is a life amen
[1:13:18] and he cried with a mighty and strong
[1:13:21] voice
[1:13:22] saying babylon the great is fallen is
[1:13:25] fallen
[1:13:26] and it's become the habitation of devils
[1:13:29] and
[1:13:29] hold of every foul spirit in the cage of
[1:13:33] every unclean
[1:13:34] and hateful bird
[1:13:37] amen that's right where things used to
[1:13:41] hold together now it's fallen
[1:13:45] apart amen so he says oh
[1:13:49] listen we got so much to live for now
[1:13:52] it should be such a jubilant time
[1:13:55] for the real church for the true church
[1:13:58] for the elected church for when you know
[1:14:01] in your heart
