us today yes Lord we do thank you yes Lord yes Jesus yes Lord yes Jesus foreign yes Lord amen and amen ABS will dismissed for Sunday school I think they may have already done that but anyway um just want to announce I think I'm going to Brad will be ministering this morning brother Danny Wade will be ministering this coming Wednesday night and then uh the following Sunday we'll have our Christmas play after the morning service amen I'll try to make it a short message and then we'll have a Christmas play next Sunday morning amen so we're looking forward to that God bless each and every one of you this morning open your bibles if you will let's turn to Psalms the 34th chapter and we'll begin with verse 9. down to the end of the chapter Psalms 34 verse 9 all begin o fear the lord ye his Saints no want to them that fear Him Amen Let me just stop there for a second I like everybody's kind of getting on the same no amen it's nice when everybody we have to learn as a group to do that right amen and it takes time A lot of reading together but that was good Come Ye children hearken unto me and I will teach you the fear of the Lord thank you keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry righteous cry and the Lord Hearth and delivereth them out of all their troubles many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth them him out of them all evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate the Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate may God bless you this morning brother David brother Brian I mean brothers and sisters I was actually going to go to Mark the 11th chapter but don't go somewhere else my memory isn't bad has everyone had a good week I asked you all pray for me I have to deal with the Leviathan this week I have to go see the VA again and it's not my for everything I want to do if you tell with me the Corinthians First Corinthians the 13th chapter just pray for Jeanette my better half she's I can tell from the assembly I had the common cold this week and she's suffering with it this morning uh I was just thinking this morning as brother Thomas was reading out of that psalm and I was reading in mark this morning in the in the gospel of Mark you know we have no you know the scripture says in Hebrews we seek a city to come and there is no I'm paraphrasing there's no continuing I'm paraphrasing there's no continuing City here and I hope isn't in the things of this world but in the things to come does it like brother Thomas and brother Branham and all the preachers say does it mean you don't do what you need to do every day to provide for your family and to take care of your children no you keep doing that but that's not our hope our hope is what's to come the thing that God said in his word that he'll provide for us on that day and it's a thing that should keep you stayed in the age and you read that some we just read our whole purpose is to keep away from Evil and just to seek good and do what God desires us to do in the day that we live right now and I was I'll just read this and sit down this 13th chapter and there's other chapters in Corinthians you can go back to chapter five also where uh but if this body be dissolved I have another one waiting it's the hope that lays in us this morning and I'll just read this this morning and I was also thinking you know we're a privileged people you know you hear ministers say that continually we're a privileged people but does it really seep down into your heart and into your life do you do you really believe you're a privileged person that God has asked me in this age that we're living has decided to speak to your heart this morning and speak to you as an individual and put you on a path that's going to take you to Eternity one day you know sometimes we forget who we really are you know like brother Thomas was saying the church is actually living really below its privileges this morning if it really knew who it was or what it was I got to raise my hand sometimes I'm that way too I forget who I am and what God has done for me too we're all human beings but if you could really lay hold of what God has in store for you and how God sees you this morning you would have a great whole brain in your heart and life this morning and let me just read this forgiven my uh nasal voice this morning but let's just read this this morning though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I've become the sounding brass or tank horn symbol you know no one gets out of here with Divine without Divine charity the love of God in your heart and though I gift of Prophecy though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing so Paul's saying here like any Minister would say I have all these great gifts I've done all these great things with God's help but they don't mean anything if I don't have the love of God in my heart it's no different for you and me this morning and goes on to say here although I bestow all my goods defeat the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profit me nothing you know that's a horrible thought you know to live your whole life believing a lie and thinking you're doing the right thing and it didn't matter that's a horrible thing and he goes on to say charity suffering long in His Kind charity Envy if not charity not itself and it's not puffed up so that's the difference between true love and you know just normal Earthly love you know you're always going to prefer people not to say that you're going to let all the time people walk over the top of you but the way you will deal with people will be in a way of love and not in the way of conflict and goes on to himself does not behave itself unseemly sick of not around it is not easily provoked thinking no evil and if you want other chapters that deal with this the first three chapters or Proverbs talk about this principle in this verse if you read those first three chapters and he goes on to say rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in the truth Earth all things believeth all things hope it's all things adoreth all things she already never faileth but whether he be whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there'll be knowledge it shall vanish away and we all it's the same for us all unless God raptures us we'll all have an appointment one day and we're not going to get away from it and it goes on to say for we know in part when we prophesy in our but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away and then this is really important when I was a child I speak as a child and I understood as a child and though as a child but when I became a man I put off childless things and that's you know people can say it but you really got to believe it you know people will say the days of playing church are over you have to be a mature Christian you but unless you believe it I mean it'll never take a hold of you in your life and it goes on to say for for now we see through a glass Darkly but face to face I know in part but then so I know even as I am known now abide by the faith hope charity but these three the greatest of these is charity and I know I talked last week about hope you know faith hope and charity those are the three principles we're all weigh on this morning and uh I was just simple to finish with that I thought No One's Gonna Get out of this life without Divine charity without the love of God in your heart and life this morning and that's a great hope that we have this morning that God has given us that ability excuse me to possess that vacuum their very Divine love of God can be in your heart and life this morning I'm not wanting to be repetitive but it's an awesome thought to think this morning that God cared about you enough that he's willing to put his spirit inside you and at the same time with the love of God abiding you so that you can be who he wants you to be in the age that we're living Brother David thank you ignore that this morning what you call short and sweet I mean I enjoyed that this morning very much and sitting back there thinking this brother Brian was speaking and I thought Lord help us to realize more and more every day Who We Are

tell you a little something I don't take much of your time but that last verse means a lot to me my mother died June the 6th this June will be 21 years about two weeks before my mom died my dad calls me on a Monday morning and he said Dad son he said your mom's going to die she was eat up with cancer and I said I know Dad she's gonna die he said no she's going to die today and I worked for myself and I had some things I had to do and I said well Dad she was going to be no he said she's gonna die today so I had to go take care of some business and they kept calling me all morning they kept telling me where are you at and I said what is going on they said your mom's gonna die I thought Lord of Mercy I said I'll be there as soon as I could and I was about an hour and 20 minutes away from home and they called me the last time my brother-in-law did and he said David where are you at I said I'm fixing to leave Jonesboro he said your mom's fixing to die so I called a friend of mine it's a state trooper and I said Wendell I said I told him when I was driving I said I'm not going to be crazy but I'm not going to be driving the speed limit either and I'm going to have my emergency flashers on I've got to get home so I drove home as fast as I could get there and when I got there my family from Tennessee was already in Arkansas I was the only one that wasn't there they had already come over because my mom was going to die so I come in there and it was hot and she'd give me a hug and she said where you been I said I had to work mama had something I had to take care of she said well you're all sweaty I said Mama I said they've been on me all morning what's the matter she said I'm fixing to go home and Mom was sleeping in a little single bed in a little room and there was a picture of an Angel up there as we began to curb pray and cry with her and sing with her she began to talk to people that was going over she began to talk about them well she didn't die the next morning I called her and I said Mama how you doing she said I'm doing great I went and seen her and I talked to her and I said you remember yesterday she said no what happened yesterday but the 6th of June about it was the following Thursday Two Thursdays after that Mama went home to be with the Lord and and that song that last course that last verse means a lot to me I'm gonna sing it again you can sing it with me well I was there The Day My Mama went to heaven I held her hands as she closed her eyes to sleep and I think the power up Ten Thousand Angels take her soul away to be crowned the Jesus feet I believe and I believe there's a place called heaven and I believe a place called Calvary oh I believe in a man whose name is Jesus and I believe that he gave his life for me oh and I believe that he gave his life before me Damon aren't you thankful for that this morning amen God bless you this morning and looking forward to what God has for us by the way of the word and amen just pray that God's presence will come and speak to our hearts we're going to ask Brother Brad to come and sing that little course of Amazing Grace that's why we're here this morning because God's Amazing Grace amen oh it's of me sing Grace oh how sweet [Music] like me [Music] it was Grace [Music] come on angry [Music] [Applause] [Music] through many dangers going through me me Days Grace [Music] [Music] [Music] the sun [Music] we've known last days amen [Music] could be in the house of the Lord this morning I'll tell you it's uh thank you for musicians we appreciate it certainly good song service and Brother David I just want to let you know Jesus is coming soon and you know we're one day sooner to his appearance and people can say well I've heard it all my life and like Brother David said he heard it since he was a young man I've heard it since I was come around and and the world's preaching it harder than it's ever been for each that Jesus is coming but he's coming and we're one day closer I'm looking forward to that day uh turn with me if you would into the book of Ephesians David called me out I try to be organized you know and and when he he called my name and I looked down my notes and it looked like somebody just shuffled them up and they were I don't know what happened back there they were out of order and so if if we if we get the cart in front of the horse just forgive me Ephesians chapter 6 we'll try not to keep you long maybe just have a little a little Evangelistic teaching if that's such a thing uh just to by way of remembrance but through the word to tell us who we are what we're called to do and and how we're to conduct ourselves as as Warriors and and soldiers of God so Ephesians chapter six very familiar scripture we've read it many times finally verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord I like it where it says that it's not saying be strong in yourself be strong in your pastor be strong in your wife or your husband be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God it's amazing that he says it twice right it must be pretty important that we're taking on this whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all of the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with a prayer with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints when it's talking about praying there and supplication it means supplication means to plead earnestly plead it's asking some somebody who has power for help there's nothing wrong for us as Christians to ask God I need help that does not mean that you're prideful that does not mean that you're weak that does not mean that you're arrogant it's just mainly mainly saying I can't do this on my own I need your help man I want to share a little thought with you this morning on wrestling with rulers let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your opportunity to be in your house this morning Lord and uh we're just thankful that we have the word the true word of this hour Lord to lead us and guide us and to show us so that we may be victorious so that we can be Overcomers so that we can stand against The Wiles of this devil that we face on a daily basis and Lord I pray this morning that as a minister the word that you've laid on My Heart Lord I just pray that you allow me to get out of the way that it won't be my words but it'll be your words through my voice to the people and to our hearts Lord to just strengthen us and encourage Us in this day we're living in we just want to tell you we love you and we appreciate you and thank you for all you do for us in Christ's name amen you can have your seats I want to share this thought with you and I tell you this uh this has been uh a thought of mine since I was 16 years old I guess 16 or 17 and uh we took a little trip I I guess it would have been brother both meetings church we loaded up that bus uh that my father-in-law had and we loaded up that bus and and we went down I guess it I guess it was brother Bo's wasn't it and and and I was just young and hadn't completely surrendered to the Lord and but but yet I was loving what I was hearing and I was you know I was I was excited and fired up and and we got down there and and brother Donnie Reagan was preaching the meetings and and he come out and he said I'm going to preach to you tonight and my message is wrestling with rulers and I've never forgot that message in all of my life and Lord knows I can't preach it like brother Donnie I'm not going to try to preach it like brother Donnie but uh I am going to preach through what the lord has laid on my heart and it has struck with me for years because it made me realize that there is a spiritual warfare going on and as a young Christian I didn't fully understand that I didn't understand I thought that you know once you said you come to Christ that everything was good and everything was pleasant and and it would be fine I didn't realize that that's where the battle started but that's where the Bible starts and we're going to look at that today and I want to speak to you about the spiritual warfare and these rulers that we face on a day-to-day basis because I believe we need to take this reality seriously it's not a fable it's not a fad it's not a fairy tale but it's reality it's reality and unless we understand the nature of this evil and unless we understand the reality of it and our relationship to it we will not be able to stand against it let alone overcome it so there is more that we have to look at because of Life on this Earth can be good life on this Earth can be wonderful there are many happy times and blessings around this world and this life we live we look and we have family we have friends we have a church family here that cares about one another we have children some of you have grandchildren and all these things we live successful lives and that's by the blessings and by the grace of God but in this all the success and all this blessings and all this goodness there's evil still present there with us and we have to recognize that this evil is there and never forget that the evil is present in this world because it's real good and evil are existing together in this universe whether we want to believe it or not we are facing evil and conflict on a day-to-day basis and this war as we've said in the past started out we know it started out in heaven with Lucifer tried to uprise he tried to come and overtake an overthrow God and His angels because he wanted something greater he wanted something better and this Rebellion where Lucifer comes in and Rebels against God it began to set things in motion for the very war that we fight today that's where it all began from it becomes from a rebellious attitude and we're going to talk about spirits a little bit and we're going to talk about some of these things that we that we battle and we Face some of our enemies that we face on a day-to-day basis and in the Garden of Eden when Eve said there she was in the Garden of Eden she was seduced into disbelieving the word of God the very word of God that she knew in her heart to be true did you hear how I said that she knew in her heart to be true and she was seduced into disobeying the word of God and entered into an act of pleasure with the serpent and betrayed her husband which has led to a lot of the chaos in the world today that same spirit is going today from home to home to home are you with me that Spirit didn't die back there in the Garden of Eden why are divorce rates out the roof why are marriages and broken homes happening around our corners it's because that spirit that was in the Garden of Eden is still here today you better learn how to fight it you better learn how to combat it you better learn how to stand against it and recognize it when that Spirit begins to move into your home it tears homes apart all over the world and the Bible clearly says that we are the children of God but that this world is under the control of the devil are you with me the prophet said understand this that the devil controls every nation under heaven the devil controls the United States he controls the government of the United States the government of Germany every nation under the heavens the devil controls them the Bible says he does he said read in Matthew chapter 4. I'll use this quote here while backing it pulled up again to me and I've got to look at it in a different way but he said Satan took Jesus up to the top of the mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and claimed them to be his Satan says this is all mine this is all mine and he said I'll give them to you if you worship me and that's where we were we were dwelling at on the time before we were sticking on worship but watch what the prophet said he says Jesus never looked at him and said you lied Satan he couldn't call Satan a liar because he knew Satan was telling the truth all the kingdoms of this world are governed by him Jesus knew that he could not say this is my kingdom into the millennium and so he looked and he had to agree with what he was saying are you with me don't stumble on that but there was there was Satan right there and he says this is all my world and you can have it and he said you never lied Satan and so evil abounding around us how we how do we win how do we win how do we fight this how do we overcome this battle brothers and sisters we must must start by understanding the reality of this evil and the world in this evil Place controlled by Satan none of us uh none of us sitting here this morning would like to think about things being evil we don't like to think of wickedness do we now now that's scary that's spooky we like to leave evil and spooky and wicked alone but let me tell you evil and wicked and spooky is all around us we never wake up in the morning and say you know what I I I'm Gonna Roll out of bed today and I'm gonna say man this is going to be a wicked evil day today no we don't do that but Paul tells us in the Book of Romans listen to the scripture here you've heard it many times he said I find then a law that I when I was the good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man so what is Paul saying here Paul is telling us that he's being honest with the people he says hey let me tell you about this law I've come to realize in my own life the Gentile the messenger to the Gentiles and they say let me tell you what I found out he said I found out to be true that no matter how hard I try how many of us how many of us try hard we try hard to be to be what God wants us to be hate our lives and we commit our lives and we come to church and we pray and we do all these things and Paul says no matter how hard I try no matter how good I am no matter how good I am no matter how hard I preach no matter how hard I teach no matter how much I encourage the Gentiles in this life the law of this world says that evil is standing right there beside me all right yeah the evil is standing right there beside him he couldn't get away from it no more than you and I can get away from it it's right there beside us I heard a message where Robert was talking about in the prayer line he said he was preaching he was calling people up for prayer and he said I felt the hairs of the devil rub against my arm while he is praying for the sick while God is healing the blind while God is opening the the ears of the death and he says I feel the hairs of the devil rub against my arm present with us there is a law there and we have to acknowledge and accept that that very same law exists in our day just like it did back there in Paul oh if we don't we're going to find ourselves defeated by the enemy we can't ignore it we can't ignore it even worse is when we accept it in the lifestyle we live and we become vulnerable to it we allow things to come in we don't stand against it brother Parish things we didn't used to do now we start doing things that we used to say was unacceptable for a Christian to do now it's all of a sudden it's okay and we become vulnerable because we accept it into the lifestyle we live and we've allowed Satan a little bitty crack in the door where he can slide right in around the corner I don't know about you brothers or sisters but I don't like the feeling of defeat there's something in me that competes I believe every Christian has it in them they're competitors they want to win they want to they want to fight they want to do what's right they want to go the extra mile to make things make sure things are done the way God wants it done I can try all I want to take it easy when I play a game with somebody I can't do it Adriana picks on me you're gonna win you're gonna try to win you better watch it he's gonna win I'm gonna try to win and I've seen it in you I've seen it in your children brother you got a granddaughter that's gonna win I watched her throw at frisbee like a rocket she was going to win that game she was serious there's something in us that competes because defeat is miserable nobody wants to be depressed do you like to be depressed or the Glen do you like depression do you like to be oppressed do you like the devil holding you down no nobody likes that nobody likes that kind of Lifestyle and it's under these walls that we find we're in a miserable place and when we look at these Wiles these walls are tricks and manipulations smoke and mirrors tricks and manipulations to get into your life they're designed to deceive you The Wiles of the devil are clever schemes and let me tell you he's so slick and he's so sneaky you may not even recognize them you may not even know what he comes knocking on your door it may be through friends well my friend would never mislead me really where's your friend living yeah uh it could come from vacillating church members oh it's all innocent well you know I I really enjoy going to church there and you know he does a good job preaching and they they do good but foreign Church splits over nothing um be careful be careful don't get mad at me [Applause] you can be misled by your husband you can be misled by your wife that's why it says to put on the whole armor you you as an individual put on the whole armor put on the whole armor of God and and these walls are used by Satan too and snare us through Temptations through threats through intimidation fear and deceit how many of us has ever had Satan use these on us before yeah if we're being honest with ourselves sure we all have that's why there's divorce that's why those Church splits that's why children are fighting against children that's why these things happen because Satan is out there working in this and Paul instructs us on how to prepare ourselves Paul gives a very clear plain instructions to prepare you and I in this evil day we live in do you realize it's an evil day he says put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the walls of the devil the whole armor of God brothers and sisters he's telling you don't go into this thing half-heartedly we can't live in a lukewarm condition we've been warned and warned and warned by the messenger in our day that God does not accept lukewarmness he will smear you out of his mouth and Paul is saying the same thing here don't go into this half-heartedly because you won't be able to stand against the walls of this Devil he's powerful he's given us a warning that you better be prepared you better be ready to fight that you better be ready to stand face to face with the devil on a one-on-one battle it's you and him mono and mono it's me and you devil are you ready for it are you sitting here today as a believer of Jesus Christ and a Believer the best power can you look the devil in the face and say look at me Deb I'm ready for you be honest with yourself we're growing today but young people listen to me this morning you can't defeat Satan young people because your mom was in church you've heard this before but I'm gonna tell it to you again because it's the truth and I want to bring it to you remember you've got to have your own experience young people you got to get down there and get serious before God and say God I'm a Christian whether Mama whether daddy whether brother where their sister is I'm going through that's what God is expecting that is what scares the devil husbands your wives experience on her knees and praying is not going to give you the experience you need to get through when you're out on the job site just because your wife was at home praying before you before you left the work and those Temptations come and those snares come you better have your own experience you better have your own set of armor brothers and sisters I'm thankful this morning and I praise the Lord that God has given a set of armor he given us a complete set of equipment and he sends us into battle with everything we need at our disposal to overthrow Satan there's no question about it he doesn't give you he doesn't he doesn't give you the the worst equipment he can find no no no he comes in here and he begins to give you the best he's got this Armor of God the armor of God did you hear what the Bible said of God it's not your armor it's his armor it's God's own armor and we fail some time to realize that and we think oh I've got on my armor I don't want my armor my armor fails but God's armor holds it's God's armor let me tell you this morning God is looking for warriors not wimps if you're not ready to stand and be a warrior before God you you're a coward that's strong that's hard to say but let me tell you God needs men and women and young men and young women and boys and girls he needs every one of us sitting here to put on this armor and be clothed in God's righteous armor this morning to stand The Wiles of the devil but for the world so that the world knows those people are real these Warriors know how to pray they know how to fast they know how to trust they know how to believe these are not cowards they don't just give up and surrender no they don't surrender their lives to the enemy there's nothing that makes me matter to hear than to hear somebody say well my daddy done it that way and my mama they she done and I guess I'll do that too well I got depression my daddy he suffered with it you know and anxiety mama had that so I guess I'm gonna have to take these pills all my life because I fight stand up and fight I'm not saying you don't need medicine don't mistake me but I'm just saying fight put on your armor and don't accept anything the devil throws at you many times we're led to believe that once we receive Christ and believe the truths of this glorious message that God Smooths out everything for us man it's smooth sailing all you got to do is come to the altar repent be baptized fill with the Holy Ghost life is good no that's a lie of the devil if somebody's told you that and somebody's LED you to believe that they've lied to you you've been lied to because that's just where where it gets started people think because they come and they kneel that that blood-covered cross that life is going to be so good no the prophet said he said I think I was linking this head in a time of peace prepare for war yeah that's right that's what he said he said that's a good statement and time of Peace prepared for war that would be a good thing to think about while everything is running smooth you better get ready you better get ready for Satan is going isn't going to let it run smooth for very long he said you're in a convention now and everything's good you know we love we we're good when we're in church and the hallelujahs are and the Praises are going forward everything is good Satan kind of sets back because he he kind of has to kind of watch what do these people do he said you're in a convention now and everything will pour along fine but you're going to leave here in a few days young people you go to these meetings I love these meetings I used to despise them can I be honest what did he just say they used to discourage me because many times I've seen people get worked up they got worked up in Emotion they got worked up in a feeling they got worked up in a tingle let me tell you I'm tingling right now but I know where I stand young people come up and they cry and they pray and they weep and they weep and they flood the altar with tears just to leave out to do the same thing over and over and over never got delivered I'm not saying it always happens that way I know there's been plenty but that's why I say now I begin to realize and as I've gotten older I begin to understand there is a reality of that and we need these meetings we need those kind of meetings for the for the young people because God is going to meet you sir Satan is going to meet you somewhere rather and the prophet said whatever he can say he's going to do it so be your best dressed all the time young people have a real experience your life may not change of 180. I think brother Parish testifies in his testimony when he was a young man he got filled with the Holy Ghost prayed for spoke in tongues rise up shouting spoke in tongues and he give up everything in one day right he gave up alcohol he gave up smoking I think I've heard his testimony before you've heard it but it may not happen that way for you but put on one piece of armor put on some kind of armor and if you've got a sin in your life if you've got two or three things you're gonna say God from this day forward I'm gonna stand here and I'm gonna throw the Devil head on and I won't do it again [Music] let me tell you the more the more you get into Christ the greater your battle becomes the more you know in the word the hotter the battle gets because Satan begins to look and he says hey this guy's getting somewhere this guy's becoming a threat to me when he gets up out of bed and puts his feet on the floor I don't know what to do with it anymore foreign he's looking at me and he's giving he's becoming a threat to me he's becoming more than I can handle and that's what God has wanted us to do he's want us to get up there and get ready Revelation and the moral revelation we get the more you're gonna have to swing your swords you might as well pull it out and get ready because as you learn get Revelation from God you're gonna have to cut through the Demons of hell it says for we wrestle for we wrestle not against flesh and blood what does that mean when you wrestle it it means you're grappling with somebody it means that you've you've locked up with an opponent sometimes we want to stay away from the Devil stay away from this guy he's ugly no that's not what he's saying we're gonna wrestle how many is ever with you with your kids or with your friends or somebody you've locked hands before and you locked hands and you try to see who can take who down who can turn each other's hands and just make them squeal I used to do that with my boys found out I better quit didn't want to hurt them but Paul is telling us you're going to Grapple with this demon you're going to Grapple with this enemy and wrestling brothers and sisters is a challenging sport wrestling takes strength we gotta have our strength in the Lord if you're relying Upon Your Own Strength you will not make it wrestling takes endurance it means being a man or a woman who wants you commit your life to God you're there through thick through thin through rain through sleet through snow it doesn't matter that you're going to go on with God how many times have you seen people they don't have the endurance they come and they sit down in the Pew man they get a good experience they they come to the cross and all of a sudden the next thing you know the first battle that comes along they tuck tail and they're gone they don't have the endurance but to be a child a God and a warrior of God you've got to have the endurance you've got to have that self-sacrifice that says no matter what I go through I'm going on and these guys they train and they work out for hours and hours I'm not talking about WWE okay I'm talking about Olympic and Collegiate wrestlers that lock up with their opponent and they train for hours and they stick to a strict diet they got to have just the right amount of protein just the right amount of carbohydrates because they got to show up to a weigh-in and see how they weigh up against their opponent are you with me we have to have a strict diet as well we've got a strict diet to follow this is our food this is the word of God this is where we get our energy this is where we get our strength this is where we get all that we have need of in this book the word of God that's our food that's our diet when you want to Grapple with the devil give him the word when Satan comes at you with depression give him the word another thing about this wrestling they're constantly trying to figure out how to break the opponent's Toe Hold and how like how to to break the opponent's stronghold and they're constantly looking and they're studying man how can I get out of this we've got a way out everything you have need of do you realize this war I'm talking about started in Genesis and it ends in Revelations and all those other 64 books in between those two there's a war going on so if you're battling sickness there's an answer for you if you're battling heartache there's an answer for you if you're battling a loss there's an answer for you if you don't know how you can get out of bed because you're so depressed and so anxious and so fearful let me tell you there's an answer for you find it in the word and live by the word you say you're putting a lot on us you're putting a lot of responsibility on us you know when those wrestlers step into that Circle and they step into that Circle and they lock hands or they lock arms they don't crawl to the corner and and tap somebody to come in and finish the fight for them no this is going to be you brothers and sisters it's going to be your fight it's going to be your battle Uncle John is going to be here it's not his battle your battle is not his and his it's not yours you may be brothers you may be close you may you may be in business ventures together you may be doing all these things you're both trying to serve the Lord but he don't fight what you fight my boys don't fight the same battles you young girls your sisters you don't fight the same battles and there's nobody to tap out to you can't pass the ball to somebody else there's no teammate it's you and him one-on-one one-on-one so when thoughts come into your mind speaking to all of us now not just young people you owe people you have thoughts come in your mind too when thoughts come into your mind it's you that has to overcome those thoughts it's easy when it's easy to tell a little white lie oh we wouldn't do that we're Christians oh come on now put those wings up sometimes it's just easier to tell just a little just a little feel that nobody will ever know and it don't hurt anybody it don't harm anybody but it's still not the truth and when it's easy to tell those little white lies it's you that's got to tell the truth when doubt Rises up it's you that has to have faith when you're feeling weak and tired and and weary it's you that has to have strength now I appreciate all the prayers and you should appreciate all the prayers of your brothers and sisters in the church and the pastor and the pastor's wife but it's you that's got to get up and go foreign the rulers of Darkness he says who ruled the world the devil certainly all these things going on all these ungodly things going on around here and the government and so forth It's all the devil he controls it all the United States Germany he controls every nation every Kingdom that ever was there ever will be until God sets up his kingdom is controlled by the devil so you know we you hear these uh oh I don't get political but you hear these liberals and these people say well after so and so wins I'm moving to Canada we'll just move on to Canada because you're going to face the same devil up there that you face down here he's everywhere listen he says I'm going to read some quotes to you now the greatest battle ever fought brother Brown was preaching on this message and he goes through and he lays it out about as simple as anybody could ever lay it out and as I'm reading this I do have some stuff that I'm going to put in here myself some thoughts that came to me and I'm going to inject them but most of this is right out of his message the greatest battle ever fought he says now listen All You Soldiers who's he talking to you all You Soldiers just before we start the prayer line take unto you the whole armor not part of it but the whole armor so that you can withstand this evil day he said and that's where we're living when you've done all to stand stand he said amen see he said all you can do is stand then stand don't move brothers and sisters if we could get it in our minds and root ourselves in the gospel and in the word of God that we're just like that tree planted by the water that we're just like that tree planted by the water and Satan say Satan I shall not be moved say it with I shall not be moved again Satan I shall not be moved if we can find ourselves in that place then we can stand and stand therefore and we can find ourselves in that place we stand in Grace we stand in the gospel We Stand encouraged we stand in strength and faith and Liberty and unity do you see what's happening God is building an arm man God has been in the army of Warriors and soldiers and they'll stand they'll stand in the Lord they'll stand perfect and complete in the will of God it means let me tell you it means you're going to be attacked if if you don't want to fight this battle maybe save you gas money gas is high right now but you gotta fight you gotta fight stand therefore having your loins gerd about with truth he says what is that what is that truth that's the word of God it's the word of truth and truth is symbolically laid right here around this part of our body have your loins gird about you with truth this is protecting the one of the most vital areas of our body and what it also does for the soldier is it gathers up their garments so that they can fight in battle we have to be prepared to fight in battle these soldiers when they would rest they would take that belt off and their clothes will be Loosely hanging about them but at the sound of that horn at the sound of that trumpet they would gird themselves around about pull up all those loose clothes and get themselves ready to fight in a battle prepared they don't want nothing hindering them nothing holding them nothing if the devil could snag don't let things in your life let the devil grab a hold of things in your life and snag you ah having the breastplate of righteousness he says what is that it's to do what's right that's simple it's simple just do what's right he said got the word of God in you doing what's right that's the breastplate of righteousness it's the protect these organs these very vital organs your heart we need to protect our heart against the wives of this devil let me tell you you're going to have thoughts you're going to have feelings you're going to have expressions of emotions but don't ever let them get down in here put on that breastplate of righteousness so that you know when you need to do right you'll do the right thing your feet shot in the preparation of the gospel of peace he said that means when you go anywhere any place anytime your feet are shot with the gospel foreign where I walk I bring good news where I walk Jesus Lives where I walk Jesus is portrayed can we all say that sometimes I don't just being honest I wish I could I I that's my hope that's my prayer that's my desire that's what we're here trying to do we're trying to get to that place but on a day-to-day basis we ought to be able to tell ourselves today Lord I'm going to shod my feet with the gospel when I get out of bed and my feet Hit the Floor praise God I'm going to represent you what is the what is that preparation uh the the feet the preparation it's the foundation the foundation of the soldier if he loses his footy you've got it when these two wrestlers are grappling you can watch them they'll wrestle and they'll twist and they'll turn and they'll spin but if one ever slips he's down you've got it and that's what we got to do we got to make sure our feet are shot with the gospel when the Roman soldiers put sandals on their feet they were so victorious in battle because they drove spikes and nails through the sandals so that they could grip the ground it was a it was a tactic of the Warfare and and this illustration is being given to us here don't lose your foot when Satan comes at you and he's pushed at you you dig your toes in you dig in and you push don't lose your footing above all take the shield of faith he says what is that that's the one that knocks the darts off the shield of faith it knocks the darts off that we're able to to able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked Paul was talking about a shield here that's used in battle you've probably seen movies the old Roman movies the old war movies where when the they would come up on a city get ready to overtake the city what did all the archers do dip their arrows in oil and Fire and thousands would at the same time at the soldiers coming right and so these guys would have these these soldiers that was coming to take the city they would have these shields and they would all come together and when they saw those fiery darts they would all throw their Shields up one right beside another and make a huge Shield what did that do it kept those fiery darts off of them it would hit those Shields and deflect off that way they wasn't burnt brothers and sisters we're the same way get your Shield of faith and build it up on that Shield of faith and we as believers when we come together we can build such a shield against Satan this Satan cannot Prevail against us take the helmet of salvation he said what is that that's your soul that's your mind that's your head that helmet of salvation covers your head he said it's your protection it's brass and it can't be it can't even be tempered it's harder than iron he said it's salvation it's knowing that your healing comes from God your salvation comes from God your experience matches his word it's your deliverance he says that's right he said take that helmet of salvation and go marching forward because that's what we're supposed to do the warrior of God marches into battle faces the battle head-on you've heard it said and preached many times there's no armor on my back there's nothing to protect me so when I face Satan and I turn and run I'm as good as gone I have to face Satan head on look at him straight in the eyes and say here I am look out devil here I come [Music] sometimes we're afraid to tell Satan that um he says but Satan's Army it brings diseases yeah do you see this Warfare we're in it hits you from all angles it can tear your home you can lose your job you can lose your marriage you get sick you get a terminal diagnosis do you turn and run or do you say no this is my god-given this is my god-given rights this is my god-given gift that God has given me I'll fight for my wife I'll fight for my children I'll fight for my job I'll fight for my life and I'll look Satan in the eyes and say my God is greater [Music] he said Satan brings all this sickness death and sorrow frustrations and worry how many has ever experienced any of those come on Church he said but God let me ask you if you've experienced any of this but God gives a life and faith and joy and peace and understanding and love and comfort and grace and mercy are you with me we serve a greater God than what the world serves in Satan he said but don't don't know he said take a little take heed here he says there's two great forces coming together right now I told you I made Satan mad there's two great forces coming together right now and he said they're battling they're battling right here in this building oh if we could just see the Unseen if we could just see how how Angels fight for us if we could just see how God's Guardians are about us and how Satan has to get knocked down and gets knocked down and gets knocked down by the word of God and the angels that encampus about us he says they're battling in this building right now he said they battled day by day every force with you he said get a good image of this he said Satan is like that great big kingly Priestly Goliath trying to scare the liver out of you ah so can you imagine as we walk day by day I got this buddy this knucklehead is on my back everywhere I go he's right here I can't make get away from it's like a shadow this big ugly Priestly kingly Goliath that is here to take me down is right here on my back you're no exception you got your Goliath too you've got your giant just like I've got my Giant and he said but with God Amen you're fortified with God you're fortified with the gospel with the word of Truth gird around your loin the helmet of salvation The Shield of Faith all these things fortify you with a sword in your hand waving Satan I'm coming to meet you come on Goliath are you willing to accept that challenge come on Goliath look out devil here I come he says he'll meet you in the name of science and I thought boy if that's not the truth how many times have people been told by the doctor you can't be healed front row right here you can't lift weights no more man you better not ever let your heart rate get above 120. I'm walking did Satan tell you that did you accept that no sir he put on his armor and he faced him head on listen doctors may tell you can't be healed they may tell you it's irreversible they make it but God says I'm a miracle working God and we can't forget that [Applause] he comes to you with culture and this is where he gets a lot of young people well the world says it's okay to drink the world says it's okay it's our culture everybody's doing it it's okay to live with a girl before you're married everybody does it do you hear me it's okay for two girls to like each other or two boys to like each other The Wiles of the devil this is how he comes at you with culture he'll meet you in all kinds of things this that the other whatever that's where he wants to meet you right there and if he could just interject just a little bit of doubt in your mind just a little bit of Doubt is all it took for Eve let me tell you young people stay true to the word you may not have the Holy Ghost but I pray that your parents have the Holy Ghost over here there's been many times I prayed my kids many of nights I've laid there and laid there and prayed the hands are protection upon them that they won't make a mistake that's irreversible because they're cats the kids they're young people I won't get into great death or detail here but how many of us skated through as a young person thanks for one honest hand brother Glenn but for the grace of God but for the grace of God where would I be but why is it when we see young people sometimes fall it's kind of like it was coming I saw it from a mile away how we pray Holy Ghost over them until they get it theirself that's what we do for our young people we pray over them Satan's Army brings diseases he said God's Army is commissioned to cast them out you know that's your commission that's your duty when a soldier goes in they have to take a swearing in am I right soldiers they put their hand up in the hand on the Bible and they swear that they'll protect this country they'll do this and this and this and they'll do everything that it says to do and brother Brown says right here when the diseases come God's Army is commissioned you should have to raise your hand and say I'm going to cast these out your commission Satan throws anything on you God's Army cast him out sometimes we lay back powerless and defeated we found to realize who we really are you know the prophet he said when she figures out who she is she'll be an invincible Army it's time we figure out who we are because God's method is cast out evil he said God God cast down reasoning God cast down Superstition cast out worry cast out disease cast out sin this is what God is doing he said you know he said when when you were there in Heavenly places God dwelling in you and he said when those evil things try to get into the kingdom what did he do cast them out he didn't say well Lucifer you're a good adversary so I'm going to let you I'm gonna let you have a bedroom over here he said Lucifer you get you and your one-third of angels and get out of here you have no place amongst the righteous you're evil you're Wicked I'm despise you you're full of grief and wickedness and Evil out in the Garden of Eden Eden out um his own out of my presence until I find a way that you can come back um so we understand as Christians we're going to be fighting in this battle and we're going to engage in this battle and we're going to put on our Spiritual armor we've come that far we got on our Spiritual armor and we know that our source from where our power and strength come is what prayer we've got all of this battle armor on we've got the word where do you get your power and your strength it's right here it's on these knees your power your strength your overcoming power comes right there when you're down there and you're praying you pray before God and you get strong in the Lord and the power of His might this spiritual battle brothers and sisters is not one where we strap on a 45. and we're looking for our enemies as we go down the road and just waiting to now that's not the kind of battle we're in our battles are won and lost with our prayer life and if I'm pointing at you I'm pointing a lot back at me I need more of a prayer life many times I wake up in the middle of night and I just lay in bed and I pray but I never feel like that's enough I I ordered put more time and more dedication and sometimes you wonder what is it what is it even worth it I woke up in the middle of night at a conference 3 A.M in the morning just a little bit ago November actually and a Brother come on my mind that I haven't spoke to I haven't heard of I haven't even thought about in months and months and months I couldn't go back to sleep I was so troubled that I just laid there in the bed for maybe an hour and I just said God I don't know what he's going through I don't even know why you woke me up I'm not that close to this guy why did you put him on my mind and I sat there and I began to pray and pray and pray and then I thought that's all I can do that's all I can do and I I woke up the next morning I said what do I do with that what do I do with that so I've got my phone looked his number up I had his number hit you've done that before huh trying to figure out the right words Take It All Away finally I said brother I don't know what's going on with you but last night about three in the morning God woke me up from a dead sleep and you were such a burden on my heart I began to pray for you I hope you're doing well and I hope by God's grace everything is good in your life never heard back from you so I hope it is but you know there's a side of me that says why didn't he just answer and say thanks brother I appreciate the prayers that's not for me to decide I did my part I pulled out my sword I got down on my knees I began to pray for him over and over and over for maybe like I said an hour and it may have just been that little prayer at that time that kept him from having a Widowmaker heart attack in his sleep it could have been a prayer right there that kept him from making a decision it could have aroused him in the middle of the night and said don't do what you're about to do it could have been that little prayer that changed the whole course of his life I don't know I'm not saying I'm special I'm not saying it means anything but for some reason we need to pray we can we can't advance in a spiritual battle if we're not empowered with prayer we have to have prayer we need prayer to protect us from this evil one we need to pray that God would guard our moral lives every one of us this world is morally and ethically Wicked and don't think it don't want you it wants you it's hunting you we need to pray that God protect our moral lives protect the people from moral failure pray God for more in our church pray for our pastor pray for his wife pray for our song leaders pray for the Bible School the Sunday School the little things a lot of times we're guilty of saying well he didn't say nothing well how much praying did you do for him hey I've I've been guilty and I can say that with an honest heart I'm ashamed of it but it's easy to do maybe you wasn't in tune maybe you what didn't get what maybe it wasn't for you and your critical side becomes going to say man he said nothing in three weeks well I'm sorry I'm the only one foreign but then I look back and I think how much time did I spend praying before that service because you know I found out the hard way I have found out that if you'll dedicate yourself before a service if you just give five minutes and say God I am weak I'm not worthy I don't deserve but God I need something from you today use my pastor use the Evangelist use somebody to speak or sing or say something that will encourage me today it changes the whole course of the service you know why because your expectation level went up and you're looking and you're listening and you're anticipating oh man what's he gonna say I know it's coming I've asked God he's going to bring me just what I need and you begin to get excited in the word of God and the next thing you know you don't care who's sitting around you you don't care who's singing you don't care who shouting into a place where God can speak to your heart and then there's those times when you pray and you pray and you pray some more and a little more and you keep praying and you think man I've got to I gotta I just it's not gonna happen my my needs are not going to be met my desire is not going to be fulfilled I prayed and I prayed and I prayed I've done this for two days in a row sometimes we find it hard to pray for ten minutes we want instant let me tell you God don't give microwave religion you just can't push 30 seconds and think all your troubles will vanish no sometimes God needs time to get to you sometimes God's angels are on their way and you're just not waiting you give up before they ever get there you know there was a man in the book about in the Bible called Daniel and Daniel when you read over in the chapter 10 Daniel is an old man at this time as you're reading in this chapter 10. he's all about 80 years old and he's seen some things in his time you know who Daniel is he's seen God move in Mighty ways and so here he is sitting there and he's looking now and he's trying to he said here and he's looking at the children of Israel the Jewish nation and he's discouraged in what he sees he's discouraged because they've had their freedom given to him but yet they're not building the Temple their their lackadaisical he don't know what's going to happen with the nation and he's worried and it's 21 days 20 I don't know how it's looking to you 21 days and Daniel is mourning it says and he says he ain't no Pleasant bread he didn't come and know wine to hit his mouth he didn't anoint himself for a whole three weeks I have a hard time fasting from 8 A.M to 12 A.M and Daniel said no Pleasant bread I'm not going to wash myself and bathe and anoint myself as custom says but I'm going to sit here and I'm going to pray and I'm going to pray and I'm going to pray then all of a sudden it says Behold a man stepped out clothed in fine linen and it said his loins were girded with fine gold his body was like barrel and his face the appearance of lightning and the lights of fire in his eyes and his voice was as the multitudes does this sound familiar you can find it in Revelations and his voice is like the voice of a multitude and it said Daniel alone saw this vision and the rest of the man with him they trembled they Quake because the earthquake and they hid themselves and here is Daniel sitting there looking at this and he's laying flat on the ground trembling at what he saw afraid to look sometimes if you pray long enough you'll get just what you're asking for God Almighty had moved on to the scene of Daniel's life and Daniel's sitting there trembling with his face down in the dirt and it said he come over and put his hand on him and he brought him up and he said he put him on his hands and his knees and that's as far as he could go because he didn't have strength to get up he's for what he was saying and Daniel on his hands and knees now trembling if they could hold my God who is this I I know who this is I've seen him before he's come and he said he said unto him fear not Daniel listen for from the first day that thou did set thine heart to understand listen Daniel don't worry because of the from the very first day that you begin to pray to me Daniel from the very first day that you want to understand what was going on with the people from that very first day I heard the words and now now Daniel I am come for thy words you ever been in a place where Daniel's at and you're wondering well Lord we're in the world have have you been think about a time in your life when things look bleak things look grim things look like you just couldn't get a over the hump and you prayed like I said and you prayed and then finally your answer come you think Lord why did it take so long the prince of the kingdom of Persia he withstood me for 20 and one days are you with me the the prince of the King of Persia the king of the Prince of Persia has withstood me for 21 days and lo Michael the chief Prince he had to come and he had to help me fight this battle let me tell you Daniel I've been trying to get to you I've been working I've been fighting I've been grappling with this ruler in Persia but he wouldn't let me through sometimes we think God don't hear us but we don't see what's going on we don't see the battle that's being fought between good and evil and the answer prayers that are coming your way and he says I have battled and I battled and he said and the Prince of Persia has held me back why did that Prince of Persia hold him back the Prince of Persia was wanting to protect the evil Kingdom he didn't want Daniel the man of God to know and to be able to prophesy the good things to come for Israel he didn't want him to know what was going to happen three 100 years down the road he didn't want him to know what was going to happen in the Book of Revelations and sometimes Satan battles our guardian angels and the word as it comes to us because sometimes Satan guards against your healing he guards against your overcoming he guards against our happiness and your joy and your satisfaction in the word and all the while this battle is happening and you're getting down on God he said that if he was delayed 21 days because of the evil of that land yeah what will it be in this day oh you talk about that endurance we talked about the wrestler has to have the endurance we have to have the endurance he says because on you have to have that undying faith and that hunger and the desire and the human heart that won't say no to God but that will hold on to God until he speaks he says you can't play with this listen to this and this I'm going to close with this two more pages and I'm closing I promise he said here some time ago he said there was a woman that come into the meeting and she was back there and he said the people back there and when when the woman come through and she come through the prayer line and she had a serious stomach trouble very serious stomach trouble couldn't eat hadn't eaten weeks and months and she was standing there on one of the rows during the prayer line and he said the the Lord spoke to her and said thus saith the Lord he said that wasn't me he said I wouldn't dares to do that but he spoke to her and said thus saith the Lord you're healed and he said there was a woman sitting behind her just the same just right behind her and he said that same thing was said to her another one said it to her thus saith the Lord you're healed she had a growth on her neck a hideous growth on her neck he said she went home and she tried to eat supper and she almost died he says he tried to eat supper she almost died and she got sick and days passed and she got sicker and sicker so you know what she did said she went back and she got them tapes and she began to Play It Again and she began to play it again and she wanted to hear him say thus saith the Lord you're healed she began to build upon her faith and build herself there he said and it was like the Holy Spirit spoke to her and several weeks passed six or eight weeks six or eight weeks passed by her husband laughed at her she said But I'm Healed her children laughed at her her neighbors laughed at her and she said what he they said to her said what did that man that preacher do to you down there and you know what her reply was it wasn't what he did to me it's what God did to me he healed me and her not eating for six to eight weeks and he said all of a sudden he said she was sitting there and sent the children off to school she was getting ready to do the dishes and she said man I'm hungry he said she hadn't done the dishes yet and there said a piece of toast one of the kids left on the plate and so she picked up that toast and she began to eat on that toast and she began to do dishes she said you know this used to make me sick I think I'll try some oatmeal says she grabbed her a bowl of oatmeal that was up there she began to eat the oatmeal and she said you know what this used to make me sick but it don't and so she said I'm gonna go out there and get extreme I'm going to get me a cup of coffee so she began to drink that cup of coffee and she began to drink that cup of coffee and she said you know what they ought to kill me but it don't I'm Healed God has moved on the scene and I'm Healed since she jumped up she run out to the door she went down through the neighborhood to her friend's house the woman who was sitting behind her with the growth she busted in her door and that woman was screaming and shouting and running and said what's wrong with you she said my growth is gone what was it he said it was God moving through the neighborhood he said listen God can't come to your rescue at every minute he said his angels can't come to your rescue at every minute but you have to wait you have to be there just like Daniel for 21 days and pray and prayed and prayed I thought when I was thinking on this I thought what would have happened if Daniel would have give up on day 20. would it have changed the course of history would it change the way the words were written but Daniel didn't have it in him he had to pray because he knew where he stood and brothers and sisters through it all we got to know where we stand and we've got to be able to pray before God and trust in God and I just want to say this morning in closing that no matter what you're going through God has called you to a special place you young people as you get older this may not make sense to you now but as you get older you'll realize that God has orchestrated every path every step of the path of your life for a reason it's not by chance that you said here it's not by chance that you hear this kind of preaching there's a lot easier preaching out there there's a lot easier to hear to maintain to follow there's a lot easier to follow word out there I say that with a little W because that's not his word but you will appreciate someday as you get down there and you say God through all these battles through all this hardship through all these things that you've put me through to all the things that that I have had to fight Satan for over and over and over I now see I'm a Victorious Warrior let's stand to our feet let's just go before the Lord in prayer I didn't mean to keep you this long but it's your fault Lord Heavenly Father we bow our hearts before you at the close of the service and we're trusting Lord that these words have encouraged the hearts of your people the pull of the people is tremendous today Lord your people are hungry they're pulling on the word we all sit here and we we're wanting to grow and we groan for that day that's coming and we want to be victorious in our lives as Christians we want to be example Believers of the word but it's not easy Lord we're just being honest with you this morning the battles we have to face in this evil day they're no surprise to you they don't shock you it's nothing new to you but Lord sometimes they catch us off guard sometimes Satan tries to slip in around the corner in a sneaky way that we can't quite put our finger on but he gets in there and the next thing you know we're in a place that we shouldn't be we're doing things we shouldn't do we're saying things we shouldn't say but Lord we stand before you this morning and we ask Lord that this whole armor of God your armor not something that I can come up with not by my might or my strength Jeremiah said in there it's not by not by might but it's by you lord it's by Your Word Lord It's that's the armor we're looking for that's the armor that we want to Shield ourselves with when the enemy shoots those fiery darts at us to discourage us to depress us to oppress us to tell us that we're not going to make it to tell us we're not worthy to tell us we're we're defeated it's those darts that we could throw of our Shield of faith and deflect those darts out Lord Jesus make us the Warriors of your army that you would have us to be it's our desire to be victorious help us Lord with our power and our strength through prayer help us Lord to be more obedient to the thoughts of Prayer Lord I know myself I fall short so many times whereas if I would just take it to you in prayer the situation would be overcome so much easier so much quicker so Lord I pray that you would put a desire of prayer into our lives and as we fight this battle in the days to come in the weeks to come or years to come however long we have on this Earth let us stand and stand therefore strong and soldiers and warriors of the world word Lord that's our desire this morning build our strength and build our faith we ask Lord in Jesus name amen yeah sister Becky let's just let's just sing that song if you're in the battle for the Lord in the right keep on the firing line oh if you're in the back of the Lord [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there are many dangers that we all must face [Music] even if I know oh you must fight be brave buckets [Music] and God will only use a soldier he can't trust or keep calming the cross shoes [Applause] [Music] great to be rewarded for your service [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]
