[16:49] morning brothers and
[16:51] sisters you'll just stand with me this
[16:56] morning maybe
[16:59] brother Brian will open us in prayer
[17:01] this
[17:26] morning speak
[17:34] amen if you'll go into the Proverbs with
[17:36] me and children can be dismissed for
[17:39] Sunday school we're going to go to
[17:40] Proverbs
[17:51] 15 in Proverbs 15 we'll start at verse
[17:53] one and we're going to read up to verse
[17:57] 16
[17:59] a soft answer turneth away wrath but
[18:01] Grievous words stir up
[18:10] anger the eyes of the Lord are in every
[18:12] place beholding the evil and the
[18:21] good who despises his father's
[18:24] instruction but he that regardeth Repro
[18:26] is prudent
[18:35] lips of the wise disperse knowledge but
[18:37] the heart of the foolish doeth not
[18:47] so may of the wicked is an Abomination
[18:50] unto the Lord but he loveth him that
[18:53] followeth after
[18:57] righteousness
[19:03] hell and destruction are before the Lord
[19:05] how much more than the hearts of the
[19:07] children of
[19:15] men merry heart maketh a cheerful
[19:17] continence but by sorrow of the heart
[19:20] the spirit is
[19:27] broken
[19:30] all the days of The Afflicted are evil
[19:32] but he that is a of a merry heart hath a
[19:36] continual Feast better is a little with
[19:39] the fear of the Lord than great treasure
[19:42] and trouble therewith God bless you may
[19:44] be seated brother
[19:56] Brian morning brothers and sisters I was
[19:59] just going to go back to this uh fourth
[20:01] verse here you know the scriptures says
[20:06] uh a lot of things but this scripture is
[20:08] really true a wholesome tongue a
[20:10] wholesome tongue to me would be a person
[20:12] that doesn't allow anything to come out
[20:14] of his mouth that can't be reason fre
[20:17] the filter of God's word that you won't
[20:20] speak evil of your brother and sister
[20:21] you won't speak evil of anything you try
[20:24] to hold yourself in in the word of God
[20:27] where you only the things and speak the
[20:29] things of God's word a wholesome tongue
[20:32] is a tray of life and perverseness
[20:34] therein is a breach in spirit and I know
[20:37] some know what this means because you
[20:39] get around them people in the world and
[20:41] there's no such thing as a wholesome
[20:43] tongue anymore they they just they just
[20:46] can't stop talking about evil and evil
[20:48] things I was thinking this
[20:54] morning brother bradam taught in that
[20:57] message the countdown
[20:58] that we're in the rocket age and we I
[21:02] I'm not saying adding to it I'm just
[21:04] saying we've gone from the rocket age to
[21:06] warp speed right now because everything
[21:09] that's going on in the world is just so
[21:12] accelerated it just moves so fast you
[21:15] kind of shake your head sometime the
[21:17] world is falling apart one day in one
[21:19] area then the W world is falling apart
[21:22] somewhere else in another day know it's
[21:24] only been about a month since the uh
[21:27] people decided that attacked the
[21:28] children of Israel and now the world's
[21:30] ready to move on to something else
[21:32] they're tired of that struggle they want
[21:34] another struggle somewhere else and I
[21:37] was just thinking this morning
[21:41] out if you don't have this word of God
[21:44] in your heart and life this morning it's
[21:46] a really deceptive age that we live in I
[21:49] mean it's a really dark age I know I say
[21:51] that a lot but it's the truth it is a
[21:54] Dark Age there is no light out there the
[21:56] only light that we have is through the
[21:58] word of God and the world out there as
[22:01] long as you keep this right
[22:03] here as long as you're experiences the
[22:07] word of God out here and not in your
[22:09] heart and in your life they're they're
[22:11] happy to be around you but the minute
[22:13] you put this in your heart and in your
[22:15] life this morning you the friends you
[22:18] used to have you'll find out that
[22:20] they're not they're not your friends
[22:21] anymore and they just go somewhere else
[22:23] not to say that they don't talk to you
[22:26] but they just think you're crazy anymore
[22:28] and I was thinking if you turn with me
[22:30] um to the sixth chapter of uh
[22:38] Mark I think a lot of it is as human
[22:41] beings we or as people we look at
[22:46] examples we look at other people we look
[22:48] at things and we just can't believe what
[22:52] we see sometimes and I'll just read this
[22:54] and this is something from last week um
[22:58] I'll read these this I'm not going to
[23:00] read this whole chapter it's a long
[23:02] chapter in Mark but I would read these
[23:04] first 10 verses first 11 verses here in
[23:07] Mark and U it really and then I'm going
[23:11] to go to uh second Peter third chapter
[23:14] maybe first John I might jump around a
[23:17] little bit and then I'll start reading
[23:19] here first verse in the sixth chapter of
[23:21] Mark I know I'm like a machine gun I get
[23:24] in a hurry I'll try to slow down and he
[23:27] went out from this and came into his own
[23:29] country and his disciples followed so he
[23:33] was in his own country you know around
[23:36] Nazareth and the places where he grew up
[23:39] and when the Sabbath day was come he
[23:40] began to teach in the synagogue many
[23:43] hearing him were astonished Shing from
[23:45] once haveth this man these things wisdom
[23:49] is this which he's given unto him that
[23:51] even such Mighty works are wrought by
[23:54] his hands so we're starting to see here
[23:56] in his own country that they couldn't
[23:58] see past his flesh they couldn't see
[24:01] past the person they knew as a child
[24:04] that they knew that learned a trade in
[24:06] his father's house they couldn't see
[24:08] past that and he goes on to say is this
[24:12] is in excuse me I'm stuttering him is
[24:16] this not this the carpenter comma so
[24:20] they thought he was just the Carpenter
[24:23] and then the next thing is not the son
[24:25] of Mary the brother of James and J's
[24:28] and of Judah and Simon are not his
[24:31] sisters here with us and they were
[24:34] offended at him you know that knocks the
[24:36] Catholic church right out there they
[24:38] tell you Mary never had any children
[24:40] other than Jesus himself that kind of
[24:42] knocks that theology right out but it
[24:45] goes on to say and Jesus said unto them
[24:48] a prophet is without honor without honor
[24:51] but in his own country and among his own
[24:54] kin and in his own house so they
[24:56] couldn't receive what God had for form
[24:58] in the form of a man because they just
[25:00] thought he was a man you know what he
[25:02] was saying was just what a man would
[25:04] tell him not that the very Living God
[25:06] was in his heart and life but now jump
[25:08] over
[25:10] here this is from uh November 5th this
[25:13] is last Sunday it comes comes out of
[25:17] Hebrews uh the fth chapter the verses 14
[25:20] to 18 and I was thinking you know that's
[25:24] the same thing we're in the world today
[25:27] sometimes we can't you know when a
[25:29] preacher comes to you or an evangelist
[25:31] comes to you or any man of God a lot of
[25:35] times your enemy is going to want to
[25:37] show you the faults of that man or that
[25:40] person and not have you listen to the
[25:42] word that's coming from that man and
[25:45] that's the whole that's that's what it
[25:47] all borrows down to and I'll just read
[25:49] what it says for as much as then as the
[25:51] children this is out of Hebrews the 2
[25:53] chapter 14 for8 for as much then as the
[25:56] children to are protect Akers of the
[25:58] Flesh and Blood he also himself also
[26:01] likewise took part of the same that
[26:04] through death he might destroy him that
[26:06] have power over to death amen that's
[26:08] where we're at this morning that is the
[26:11] devil and deliver them who through fear
[26:13] of death were all their lifetime subject
[26:16] to bondage and that's really true this
[26:18] morning if you're if God has taken
[26:21] control of your heart and your life this
[26:23] morning not to say that you don't H or
[26:26] you don't worry about things but there's
[26:29] no more death has no victory over you
[26:32] this morning you're not in bondage to
[26:34] death this morning anymore you have
[26:36] Victory through Jesus Christ and he goes
[26:39] this scripture goes on to say for verily
[26:42] he took not onto
[26:44] him him the nature of angels but he took
[26:47] on him the Seed of Abraham wherefore in
[26:49] all things it is behooved him that he be
[26:52] made like unto his Brethren so this goes
[26:54] back what I was reading in Mark 6 they
[26:57] couldn't see past the flesh they
[27:00] couldn't see past that even with all the
[27:02] signs and all the Miracles they just
[27:05] couldn't see p the flesh the seed of
[27:07] Abram wherefore in all things it
[27:10] behooved him to be made like onto his
[27:12] Brethren that he might be merciful and
[27:14] faithful high priest in the things
[27:16] pertaining to God to make reconciliation
[27:19] for the sins of the people for in him he
[27:23] himself ha suffered being tempted and is
[27:25] able to scour them that are temped so he
[27:28] he felt what you and I feel he knew our
[27:31] experience he knew what we would face in
[27:33] our life and he had enough love and
[27:35] compassion for us that he is willing to
[27:37] bear that all and go to the Cross this
[27:40] morning so us as Christians he he gave
[27:44] us the victory what do we have to worry
[27:46] about and I was just thinking the age
[27:47] that we're in this morning if you're not
[27:50] careful it is going so fast it'll leave
[27:53] you behind if you don't stay with the
[27:55] Lord and stay with Jesus Christ this
[27:57] morning morning if you don't stay in the
[27:58] spirit of Christ this age will take or
[28:01] just go right by you'll be left standing
[28:04] on the road and it'll just go right by
[28:06] you this morning this is what brother
[28:08] brandom had to say about it this
[28:10] morning and it's no different whether
[28:12] it's brother branam or it was Luke or
[28:16] Mark or any of these famous swindale I'm
[28:20] not swindale I mean all the F famous
[28:22] preachers of the 1800s Campbell and all
[28:25] these other people people sometimes
[28:27] couldn't see past the man that there
[28:31] I'll just read what it says Jesus was
[28:33] completely totally man he would cry like
[28:36] a man he would eat like a man he could
[28:39] become like a man he was completely
[28:41] totally a man in his physical beings and
[28:44] in his Spirit he was completely totally
[28:47] God so he made his flesh submissive to
[28:49] the spirit that was in him that's we're
[28:51] no different we're no better ourselves
[28:53] you have to make your flesh come into
[28:56] submission to the word of God we're no
[28:58] better ourselves you see he was tempted
[29:01] in all manners like we are he was a man
[29:05] not an angel he was a man he had desires
[29:07] and temptations like we do the Bible
[29:10] said he did he was a man not an angel
[29:13] above Temptations and then we go back to
[29:15] what I read in Hebrews Hebrews said he
[29:17] was made lower than the angels He was a
[29:20] man completely a man and God took a
[29:23] complete man to bring total Deliverance
[29:25] that he filled him with the whole his
[29:27] Spirit the holy ghost that was in him
[29:29] without measure and he was tempted like
[29:32] we were but we're a little bit different
[29:35] now that everything that he was God
[29:38] poured into his church this morning and
[29:40] it's through that that we have the hope
[29:42] this morning whatever that need is that
[29:44] you have this morning I hope I didn't
[29:46] lose my place
[29:47] here uh he was completely God he
[29:50] approved he raised the Dead when he
[29:51] stopped nature The Roaring Seas the
[29:53] mighty winds when he spoke to the trees
[29:55] and so forth they obeyed him
[29:58] and he was God inside and he could be
[30:00] that he could be man for he was man and
[30:02] he was totally completely delivered
[30:04] himself as a man into the hands of God
[30:07] for the service of God he is our example
[30:10] and I can't change that is totally true
[30:13] this morning Christ is your example this
[30:15] morning everything you need as a human
[30:17] being this morning is in the word of God
[30:19] and in Jesus Christ this morning anyone
[30:21] tells you anything different they're
[30:24] lying to you and or also Christians that
[30:27] he's our example um rereading he was
[30:30] totally man he's totally God but he
[30:32] surrenders his natural parts to his
[30:35] physical parts his own thinking his own
[30:37] doing his own cares and I only and he
[30:40] said I do only which pleases the father
[30:42] we're no different ourselves you got to
[30:44] surrender your thoughts your mind your
[30:46] body and everything to the word of God
[30:49] here said Rabbi so so they tried to
[30:51] bribe him into the affiliations and
[30:54] denominations but he was totally deriv
[30:57] because he trusted in God did not the
[31:00] psalmist say they will deliver him he
[31:02] was completely trusted in me and I will
[31:06] deliver my darling from the dogs because
[31:08] he trusted me so somehow when when we
[31:11] come to the end of this life's journey I
[31:13] want it for mine I know I want it for
[31:16] yours I want him to
[31:20] say I deliver him from the grave on the
[31:24] res Resurrection morning totally deliver
[31:26] him both soul body and spirit because he
[31:30] trusted
[31:31] me I'm just gonna jump over here and in
[31:36] uh I won't take a lot of time but over
[31:39] in um I was thinking sometimes when God
[31:42] sends people to us sometimes sometimes
[31:46] we we see the person more than we see
[31:48] the god in the person sometimes and
[31:51] there's only 18 verses here I'll finish
[31:53] with this is The Second Epistle of of
[31:56] Peter
[31:58] but Peter talks about other people in
[32:01] his I'll just read it and let it speak
[32:03] for itself and this is what Peter said
[32:05] this is The Second Epistle beloved now I
[32:08] write unto you in both which I stir up
[32:11] your pure Minds by the way of
[32:13] remembrance and that even goes back to
[32:15] that scripture that we read in Proverbs
[32:18] that you may be mindful of The Words
[32:20] which were spoken before by the holy
[32:22] prophets and of The Commandments of us
[32:25] the Apostles of the Lord Savior and any
[32:28] real man of God will always bring you
[32:30] back to the word of God not his own
[32:33] ideas not his own opinions but
[32:35] everything brings you back to the word
[32:36] of God knowing this first that there
[32:39] shall come in the last days scoffers
[32:42] walking after their own
[32:44] lust and saying where is the promise of
[32:46] his coming that's where we're at this
[32:48] morning everyone's falling away because
[32:50] they don't see the promise of his coming
[32:53] and he goes I lost my place there uh for
[32:57] since the fathers fell asleep all things
[32:59] continue as they were from the beginning
[33:01] of creation for this they willingly are
[33:04] ignorant of by the word of God that the
[33:07] heavens were of old and the Earth
[33:09] standing out of the water and in the
[33:11] water so he's he's saying it it keeps
[33:15] happening age after age after age they
[33:18] just refuse to hear the word of God and
[33:22] things happen to him judgment comes to
[33:25] him whereby the world that was them was
[33:27] being overflowed with water and purst it
[33:30] goes right back to the Genesis 6th
[33:32] chapter it it just keeps happening time
[33:34] and time again but you we're out of that
[33:38] cycle we don't keep going in that cycle
[33:40] of death anymore that the world is in
[33:42] you're outside of that cycle right now
[33:44] through Jesus Christ this morning
[33:47] beloved be not ignorant of this one
[33:49] thing I I miss the scripture there but
[33:52] the heavens and the Earth which are now
[33:53] by the same word are kept in store
[33:55] reserved on the Fire against the day of
[33:57] judgment and predition unto ungodly men
[34:01] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[34:05] thing as a the Lord is not sck
[34:08] concerning his promises some men count
[34:09] slackness but his longsuffering to us W
[34:12] not willing that any should perish but
[34:15] that all should come to repentance
[34:16] that's where we're at this morning
[34:17] There's Hope for any of us this morning
[34:19] if you put it in Jesus Christ but the
[34:22] day of the Lord will come as a thief in
[34:24] the night in which the heaven shall pass
[34:26] away with great noise and the elements
[34:28] shall melt with fervent Heat and the
[34:30] Earth also and The Works therein shall
[34:32] be burned up seeing then that all these
[34:35] things shall be dissolved what manner of
[34:38] person ought you to be in all holy
[34:40] conversation and godliness again that
[34:42] goes back to what we were reading in
[34:45] Proverbs this morning looking for the
[34:47] hastening and onto the coming of the day
[34:49] of God wherein the heavens being on fire
[34:52] shall be dissolved and the elements
[34:54] shall melt with fervent Heat
[34:57] nevertheless we according to his promise
[34:59] look for the new heavens and the new
[35:01] Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness I
[35:04] believe that's why everyone's here this
[35:06] morning you're looking for that day and
[35:08] he goes on to say nevertheless according
[35:11] to the promise or I already excuse me
[35:13] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[35:15] for such things be diligent that you may
[35:17] be found in him in peace and without
[35:19] spot blamus and that's why you're here
[35:21] this morning that through the word of
[35:23] God that you can be purified this
[35:25] morning and the that long suffering of
[35:28] the Lord is salvation even and this is
[35:31] what I was thinking about this morning
[35:32] this scripture it goes back
[35:34] to when we look at people bringing the
[35:38] word of God to us sometimes you got to
[35:39] look past the person and if that message
[35:42] actually hits your heart and hits your
[35:43] life don't see the person but see the
[35:46] spirit of Christ delivering that word to
[35:48] you whether it was brother brandham
[35:50] whether it was Paul whether it was Peter
[35:53] James John any any minister of God if
[35:56] they have the truth of God and something
[35:58] they say touches your heart and life
[36:01] don't look at the man but look at the
[36:03] word of it should bring bring you right
[36:05] back to the word of God this morning and
[36:07] make you want to change and count this
[36:10] long suff from the Lord I miss that uh
[36:13] I'm sorry if I keep rereading the
[36:15] account that the longsuffering of Our
[36:16] Lord is salvation even as our beloved
[36:19] brother Paul also according to wisdom G
[36:22] given to him hath written unto you so
[36:25] Peter's pointing back to Paul in all his
[36:28] Epistles and he goes on to say also in
[36:30] all his Epistles speaking in them of the

[55:43] they're watching my kidneys and uh the
[55:46] doctors have had me coming back every
[55:48] six months and I went in and and my

[56:11] know I said I believe God's A Healer me
[56:15] and I said you know I said I'm still
[56:18] taking my medicine for diabetes I said
[56:20] but I believe that God's healed me and
[56:23] uh just like last night I took my shot
[56:27] and uh my sugar I thought I'm not going
[56:29] to take my shot I really don't need it

[57:19] what I believe but then she encouraged
[57:21] me to even believe

[1:16:19] turn to Colossians we'll begin with the

[1:16:24] Colossians
[1:16:25] 1 as we begin to look at
[1:16:39] this amen I can't think of any other
[1:16:42] announcements so amen praise the
[1:16:46] Lord Colossians 1 and we'll begin with
[1:16:49] verse 13 WHO hath delivered us from the
[1:16:52] power of Darkness and has translated us
[1:16:55] into the kingdom of his dear son am me
[1:16:58] I'm going to move this down a little
[1:17:00] bit in whom we have Redemption through
[1:17:03] his blood even the Forgiveness of sins
[1:17:06] who is the IM image of the invisible God
[1:17:08] the firstborn of every creature remember
[1:17:11] he's talking about Jesus amen he was the
[1:17:14] very image of the invisible God the
[1:17:17] firstborn of every creature for by him
[1:17:20] were all things created that are in
[1:17:22] heaven
[1:17:23] and that are in Earth visible and
[1:17:26] invisible whether there be Thrones or
[1:17:29] dominions or principalities or Powers
[1:17:32] all things were created by Him and for
[1:17:36] him and he is before all things and by
[1:17:39] him all things consist and he is the
[1:17:41] head of the body the church who is the
[1:17:44] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[1:17:46] that in all things he might have the
[1:17:49] preeminence amen praise the Lord that's
[1:17:51] the first one and I want to go to First
[1:17:54] John not first John but St John let's go
[1:17:58] to St John if you
[1:18:05] will St John
[1:18:10] 1 St John 1 and 1 through3 in the
[1:18:15] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:18:18] God and the Word was God the same was in
[1:18:21] the beginning with God Amen now remember
[1:18:25] the Word was God Amen and it was With
[1:18:28] God all things were made by him and
[1:18:32] without him was not anything made that
[1:18:35] was
[1:18:36] made you know I had to think about this
[1:18:39] and you know how that the devil Satan he
[1:18:43] can't
[1:18:44] create anything there he can't make a
[1:18:47] boat all right he can't create anything
[1:18:51] if anything was ever made it was God
[1:18:53] that made it amen praise the Lord now
[1:18:57] turn with me over to Revelations
[1:18:59] 4 I have a couple more just to kind of
[1:19:02] lay a foundation if that's all right
[1:19:04] Revelations
[1:19:09] 4 amen I like that song Brother David
[1:19:12] saying let the Saints arise Amen Let
[1:19:15] Them worship Amen Let the worshipper
[1:19:17] arise is't that right I believe that
[1:19:19] we're living in an hour amen when God 's
[1:19:23] people especially are going to recognize
[1:19:25] amen the greatness of the god that we
[1:19:28] serve amen how great he really is amen
[1:19:32] and that he is worthy of Praise amen
[1:19:37] more so than what we can imagine but I
[1:19:39] hope that by God's grace and help just
[1:19:42] to convey to you this morning a little
[1:19:44] bit by God's help amen the praise and
[1:19:47] the honor that he's worthy of because if
[1:19:50] if you'll notice here in chapter 4 in
[1:19:53] verse 10 amen it talks about the let's
[1:19:57] go back to verse n and when those beasts
[1:20:00] give honor and glory and thanks to him
[1:20:04] that sat on the throne who liveth
[1:20:07] forever and ever the 4 and 20 Elders
[1:20:10] fall down before him that sat on the
[1:20:12] throne and worshiped amen it's a time of
[1:20:17] worship a time of Praise amen worship
[1:20:21] him that liveth forever and cast their
[1:20:23] crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art
[1:20:27] Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and
[1:20:31] honor and power for thou has created all
[1:20:36] things and for th pleasure they are and
[1:20:41] were created
[1:20:45] amen you want another one let's do one
[1:20:48] more shall we just one of many amen
[1:20:50] another one is in Revelations 5 and
[1:20:52] beginning with verse 11 and I beheld now
[1:20:55] notice how this was after amen he was uh
[1:20:58] under fifth chapter one sat on the
[1:21:00] throne so forth amen and nobody was
[1:21:02] worthy to take the book is't that right
[1:21:03] to loosen the seals thereof amen but the
[1:21:06] line of the tribe of Judah had prevailed
[1:21:08] and so forth on down and at the end of
[1:21:10] all this we find in verse amen 10 it
[1:21:13] says and has made us unto our God Kings
[1:21:15] and Priests and we shall rain on Earth
[1:21:17] and I beheld and a I heard the voice of
[1:21:20] many angels round about the throne and
[1:21:22] the Beast and the
[1:21:24] elders is that something how I talked
[1:21:26] about the elders and so forth over on
[1:21:28] this other chapter now it talks about
[1:21:30] the angels is't that right round about
[1:21:33] the throne and the Beast Sandy elders
[1:21:36] and the number of them was 10,000s times
[1:21:39] 10 thousands and thousands of
[1:21:41] thousands W how many believe there going
[1:21:44] to be some folks Over Yonder there going
[1:21:48] to be some people praising God Over
[1:21:51] Yonder but I ain't going to wait till I
[1:21:53] get over there are you we might as well
[1:21:55] start it
[1:21:57] now why because well who he
[1:22:01] is we ain't got a whole lot to brag
[1:22:03] about who we are because we were so low
[1:22:05] down and mean we had to die to oursel to
[1:22:08] ever Mount
[1:22:10] anything is't that right all right
[1:22:13] thousands of thousands sing with a loud
[1:22:16] voice oh I like that we got to be a
[1:22:19] little loud this morning is that okay
[1:22:21] not quiet
[1:22:23] he I guess he's
[1:22:26] worthy huh no no he said with a loud
[1:22:30] voice Worthy is a lamb that was
[1:22:35] slain Amen to receive power and riches
[1:22:40] and man is is all the stuff that we
[1:22:43] always want we want power we want riches
[1:22:47] we want wisdom we want strength is't
[1:22:49] that right but it says he's worthy of
[1:22:52] all these things because when you get to
[1:22:54] be an old man and your strength begin to
[1:22:56] fail you realize that any kind of
[1:22:58] strength and power that you have is
[1:23:00] power and strength that God gave to you
[1:23:02] in the first
[1:23:04] place
[1:23:07] amen all right so he says that's right
[1:23:09] to receive power and riches and wisdom
[1:23:11] and strength and honor and glory and
[1:23:14] blessing that's what he's worthy of and
[1:23:18] every creature which is in heaven and on
[1:23:19] Earth and under the Earth and such as
[1:23:22] our and to seea all that were all that
[1:23:25] are in them heard me S or I sing
[1:23:28] blessing John even got into it John be
[1:23:31] to say blessing and honor and glory and
[1:23:34] power how many know John's a type of the
[1:23:38] Bride so if that type of the Bride
[1:23:40] shouldn't be we be saying that blessing
[1:23:44] honor glory power be unto him that sth
[1:23:47] upon the throne and unto the lamb
[1:23:49] forever and ever and the for be said so
[1:23:54] be it amen and the 4 and 20 Elders fell
[1:23:58] down and worshiped him that liveth
[1:24:00] forever and ever God bless the reading
[1:24:03] of the word you can be
[1:24:09] seated amen first we want to start with
[1:24:12] saying that we realize through the
[1:24:14] prophet of God and that uh he brought to
[1:24:17] us the understanding that way back in
[1:24:20] Genesis 1 and I believe it was 126 when
[1:24:22] he God expressed himself as Lord God
[1:24:25] that he expressed him himself from the
[1:24:27] Greek speaking about being Elohim which
[1:24:29] means the self-existing
[1:24:31] one he was the self-existing one and God
[1:24:36] means in the English language it means a
[1:24:40] uh object of worship to have any kind of
[1:24:43] a God or whatever it means object of
[1:24:45] worship so God wasn't even God at one
[1:24:48] time because you have to be an object of
[1:24:51] worship and there was nobody to worship
[1:24:52] there was no angels He was all by
[1:24:55] himself this is where our find finite
[1:24:58] Minds can't
[1:25:00] comprehend amen
[1:25:02] God you know you don't start asking
[1:25:05] yourself questions like well how long
[1:25:07] was it before God ever made the first
[1:25:10] star don't even go there it a little
[1:25:13] blow your mind we don't know how long it
[1:25:15] was you know in our minds everything has
[1:25:18] a beginning everything has to start
[1:25:20] somewhere you know but God never never
[1:25:22] never did stop I'm just so glad that he
[1:25:26] came and proved himself alive today and
[1:25:28] that he's real the problem with people
[1:25:31] in their lives is that they don't have
[1:25:32] the reality that Jesus is real that God
[1:25:35] is real amen I'm glad to know that he's
[1:25:39] real my God is real he's real in my soul
[1:25:44] amen for he has washed that he's made me
[1:25:47] whole I'm not the man I used to be
[1:25:50] you're not the woman that you used to be
[1:25:52] amen God is coming he does something I
[1:25:54] want you to know that this whole thing
[1:25:56] is about God he is the alpha he's Omega
[1:26:00] he's the beginning of the he's the
[1:26:02] entire alphabet he's the beginning he's
[1:26:04] the end he wrote the end in Revelations
[1:26:07] he wrote about the thousand year reign
[1:26:09] the new heavens and the new Earth he's
[1:26:11] everything Bible talks about he is all
[1:26:13] and he is it all and it's all for
[1:26:17] him when you begin to think about him
[1:26:20] and what he is and who he is we realiz
[1:26:22] said amen in him in him in the
[1:26:25] self-existing one that he had attributes
[1:26:28] that he had something that he wanted to
[1:26:30] express
[1:26:32] himself just kind of like a person
[1:26:34] that's filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:35] you want to tell people about the gospel
[1:26:37] you want to give them the good news but
[1:26:39] people don't want to hear the good
[1:26:41] news I believe it if Isaiah said
[1:26:43] something about it's like a fire shut up
[1:26:45] in my
[1:26:46] bones how many believe that's the way it
[1:26:48] ought to be Christianity isn't just a
[1:26:51] big old wet rag amen the sour amen Sad
[1:26:54] and Blue Nights of fire that shut up in
[1:26:56] your bones and you got to somehow try to
[1:26:58] express it I get the honor and the
[1:27:01] privilege of expressing myself when I
[1:27:03] come up here when I live and whatever I
[1:27:04] do am but this be gamous say oh how
[1:27:08] greater God is Express and God wanted to
[1:27:11] express himself he had attributes in him
[1:27:15] what to be a lord in him was to be a
[1:27:19] father that father was shut up on the
[1:27:22] inside of him Amen to be a son to be the
[1:27:26] Holy Ghost to be the pillar of fire to
[1:27:29] be a redeemer to be a savior to be a
[1:27:34] deliverer he wanted to do all these
[1:27:37] things when he comes right down to it
[1:27:39] brothers and sisters we realize that the
[1:27:41] victory that is in your life it ain't
[1:27:43] your Victory it is the victory that he
[1:27:45] had in him and he expresses it to you
[1:27:48] and through you when you overcome that's
[1:27:50] he overcoming
[1:27:53] when brother Phil Wednesday when he was
[1:27:55] here and he was talking about it he said
[1:27:56] man you know don't be don't put Jesus
[1:27:58] over on the co-pilot he's not the pilot
[1:28:01] get out of the driver's seat sit over
[1:28:03] there let him do the driving he's the
[1:28:05] one that made you can the for thing form
[1:28:08] say to him that formed why Thou made me
[1:28:10] thus in Romans
[1:28:12] 7 no don't tell him say Well why have
[1:28:16] you made me this I'm glad he made you
[1:28:19] are you glad he made you
[1:28:23] amen that's
[1:28:24] him expressing God wanted to express and
[1:28:28] we are now at Easter many times we'll
[1:28:32] take messages preach on the Ben being
[1:28:34] beneficiaries of the
[1:28:36] Resurrection is that right tonight this
[1:28:38] morning for a little while we're going
[1:28:40] to just begin to talk about being
[1:28:42] beneficiaries of his attributes or of
[1:28:45] his
[1:28:47] expression on why because there's
[1:28:50] millions of people that have have not
[1:28:52] partaken that are not benefits that are
[1:28:55] not benefits of what he
[1:28:59] is
[1:29:01] amen but to be a part of what he
[1:29:04] is first of all oh my and like I said it
[1:29:08] could go a long ways because amen if you
[1:29:11] have the Holy Ghost there's only one
[1:29:13] form of eternal life and that's God's
[1:29:15] own life that right according as he has
[1:29:19] chosen Us in him before the found of the
[1:29:22] world you have to be a seed Gene you
[1:29:25] have to be an expression of the almighty
[1:29:27] God to be a Son of God if he he has
[1:29:31] called you he wrote the Bible says you
[1:29:32] know all whose names were not written in
[1:29:34] the Lamb of books a lamb Book of Life
[1:29:36] from the foundation of the world will be
[1:29:39] deceived before it oh boy this is a big
[1:29:42] word for most people but before it ever
[1:29:43] started God already knew how it would
[1:29:45] end he knew what everybody's choice
[1:29:48] would be he put Humanity on free moral
[1:29:50] agency I was thinking on the Church on
[1:29:52] the way to church here how simple it
[1:29:53] really is the accountability that got
[1:29:55] has put Humanity upon amen what's 2
[1:30:00] million time 3
[1:30:04] million what's 3 million time 2 million
[1:30:08] 6
[1:30:09] million time 3 * 2 2 * 3 6 million right
[1:30:14] or if you say 3 million plus two billion
[1:30:17] simple
[1:30:18] right what let's go big let's go one
[1:30:21] trillion time 20
[1:30:25] trillion is 20
[1:30:27] right but God Gave You reasoning he gave
[1:30:31] you understanding and guess what for
[1:30:33] that understanding he hold you
[1:30:36] accountable he made it to where you can
[1:30:38] judge what is right and what is wrong
[1:30:41] and he holds you accountable for
[1:30:43] [Applause]
[1:30:46] that put them on free moral agency
[1:30:49] amen all right well I don't want to go
[1:30:51] down that road too far but let's just
[1:30:52] look at
[1:30:53] him amen for just a minute oh my how we

[1:50:04] most of the known world he was a mighty
[1:50:06] conqueror feared is that right but he
[1:50:10] met his waterl he met his defeat isn't

[1:50:14] going down as he drunk and dying as he
[1:50:17] drunk the brother talks about how that
[1:50:19] Jesus that 33 he had conquered every
[1:50:23] devil oh he conquered him in Matthew 5 I
[1:50:26] believe it is amen when he was up on the
[1:50:27] mountain he conquered sickness he
[1:50:30] conquered epilepsy oh an epileptic child

[1:50:35] out when he
[1:50:37] came folks I'm here to tell you if Jesus
[1:50:40] couldn't have cast him out we'd have had
[1:50:41] a problem if there had been one devil
[1:50:43] that the devil got that Jesus couldn't
[1:50:45] overcome we' had a
[1:50:47] problem but there was nothing that he
[1:50:49] couldn't
[1:50:51] not a one that he did couldn't
[1:50:53] overcome Oh my he fought that great
[1:50:56] battle all the way up the calvary he me
[1:50:58] stretched his arms and maybe the devil

[1:51:02] biggest victory of all because with that
[1:51:04] blood that came out he bought you and me

[2:06:57] place for you I will come again and
[2:06:59] receive you unto myself that where I am
[2:07:02] there you may be also much could be said
[2:07:03] about Revelations and God will be with
[2:07:05] them wipe away all their tears from
[2:07:07] their eyes and he shall be their God and
[2:07:09] they shall be his son a't that right and
[2:07:12] whether not
[2:07:13] notice if I go I'll go prepare a place
[2:07:16] and I'll come back and get you again
[2:07:17] whether I and whether I go you know and
[2:07:19] the way you
[2:07:23] know Thomas saith unto
[2:07:26] him Lord we know not whether th goest
[2:07:30] how can we know the
[2:07:34] way isn't that something that Jesus
[2:07:36] would bring this up do you not reckon
[2:07:39] that he probably knew what Thomas was
[2:07:40] going to
[2:07:43] ask he wanted to get something across to
[2:07:45] us and Jesus said unto him
[2:07:49] I am the
[2:07:51] way the truth and the life no man cometh
[2:07:55] unto the father but by me amen Isn't it
[2:08:00] nice to know that Christianity in Christ
[2:08:02] is the only way to happen you can't get
[2:08:06] up you can't go you can't get there any
[2:08:08] other
[2:08:11] way I watched on YouTube somebody asking
[2:08:15] well what about all of these different
[2:08:16] religions the mention of all are you
[2:08:18] saying that they're not going to be
[2:08:19] saved he says that's exactly right he
[2:08:23] says cuz Jesus says I am the way no man
[2:08:25] comes unto the father but by me if his
[2:08:29] Bible true they're all
[2:08:30] false and it was a it was a sticky point
[2:08:33] because they meant to put him on Under
[2:08:34] Pressure are you saying that he was like
[2:08:37] yeah I'm saying
[2:08:39] that I am the way the truth and the life
[2:08:42] no man comes to the father but by me
[2:08:45] nobody else died Jesus the one that died
[2:08:48] there's no remissions of sins in any
[2:08:49] other name but in Jesus name don't oh my
[2:08:53] in St John now notice this is again
[2:08:56] talking about who he is right he is the
[2:08:59] way he is the truth he is the life amen
[2:09:02] in John 101 says verily verily I say
[2:09:04] unto you he that enter not in by the
[2:09:06] door unto the Sheep fall but
[2:09:17] climbthestacks verily I say unto you I
[2:09:21] am the door of the
[2:09:24] sheep
[2:09:26] he's you don't get into the Sheepfold
[2:09:29] any other way but through Jesus Christ
[2:09:32] amen amen and I won't get into the Good
[2:09:35] Shepherd there he talks about uh the
[2:09:37] being the Shepherd that Jesus Christ
[2:09:39] with the great
[2:09:40] Shepherd now we go to
[2:09:47] Matthew
[2:09:49] Matthew
[2:09:51] 28 then the
[2:09:53] 11 28 and we'll begin with verse 16 then
[2:09:56] the 11 disciples went away into Galilee
[2:09:58] into a mountain where Jesus had
[2:09:59] appointed them and when they saw him
[2:10:02] they worshiped him but some doubted and
[2:10:04] Jesus spake and said unto them saying
[2:10:06] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[2:10:11] earth amen all power amen go ye
[2:10:16] therefore and teach all All Nations
[2:10:19] baptizing them in the name of the father
[2:10:22] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[2:10:25] amen teaching them to observe all things
[2:10:28] whatsoever I have commanded you and L I
[2:10:30] Am With You Always even unto the end of
[2:10:35] the
[2:10:35] world Amen now we all know that there
[2:10:40] was never one person ever in the whole
[2:10:42] Bible will you ever find a person being
[2:10:46] baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost
[2:10:49] not one amen but in Luke let's go to
[2:10:53] Luke next chapter is
[2:10:56] Luke the end of
[2:10:58] Luke and verse 45 then opened he their
[2:11:02] understanding uhoh had to have a little
[2:11:05] open of opening of their understanding
[2:11:07] that they might understand the
[2:11:08] scriptures verse 45 and said unto them
[2:11:12] thus it is written and thus it behoove
[2:11:15] Christ to suffer and to rise from the
[2:11:17] dead the third day and that repentance
[2:11:21] and remissions of sins should be
[2:11:24] preached in his name among all nations
[2:11:29] beginning at Jerusalem
[2:11:33] amen but and you are witness of these
[2:11:36] things but T ye in the city of Jerusalem
[2:11:38] until you be endued with power from on
[2:11:40] high so he told them to go to Jerusalem
[2:11:42] didn't he to go to Jerusalem and wait
[2:11:45] until they are endued with power
[2:11:48] from on high amen now over in the book
[2:11:51] of
[2:11:54] Acts I have one in Acts let me
[2:11:58] see now they were in Jerusalem of course
[2:12:01] this is Acts 2 and after they got the
[2:12:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost they went out
[2:12:05] there and Peter preached on the day of
[2:12:06] Pentecost and he told them how that uh
[2:12:10] you
[2:12:10] know he said men and Brethren let me
[2:12:13] freely speak of you of the patriarch
[2:12:14] David and he basically preached the
[2:12:16] whole sermon down into verse 34 for
[2:12:19] David is not ascended into the heavens
[2:12:21] but he saith himself the Lord said unto
[2:12:23] my Lord sit down on my right hand until
[2:12:25] I make thy enemies thy foot stol
[2:12:28] therefore let all the house of Israel
[2:12:30] know assuredly that God ha made Jes this
[2:12:34] same Jesus whom you have crucified both
[2:12:38] Lord and Christ
[2:12:42] amen now how many knows the Lord I Am
[2:12:44] Lord there is no other God in the Old
[2:12:46] Testament he says I Am Lord there is no
[2:12:48] other God besides me now Jesus is this
[2:12:50] lord of the Old Testament Jehovah of the
[2:12:52] Old Testament come down into Jesus he
[2:12:55] says I have I been with you Thomas and
[2:12:58] Philip have I been with you so long and
[2:12:59] you still don't know me you still want
[2:13:01] to see the father it is the father that
[2:13:03] doth the I and my father are what the
[2:13:07] father dwell on the inside which was the
[2:13:09] spirit a't that right that's
[2:13:14] right amen now where we at
[2:13:20] he made him both Lord and Christ which
[2:13:23] Christ represents the Holy Ghost so he's
[2:13:25] got the father or Lord and he's the son
[2:13:28] which is Jesus right father son and the
[2:13:33] Christ or the Holy Ghost he says the
[2:13:35] names of the father no he said name of
[2:13:38] the father Son and the Holy Ghost which
[2:13:40] is Lord Jesus I'm a father not my name
[2:13:43] I'm a son not my name I have the Holy
[2:13:46] Ghost not his name the Holy Ghost name
[2:13:48] is Christ amen so he was asking for the
[2:13:51] it's something how that the Catholics in
[2:13:53] the 300 what was it around 300 ad I
[2:13:57] believe it was even they confessed that
[2:13:59] they used to baptize in the name of
[2:14:01] Jesus Christ and then they turned it and
[2:14:03] converted went back to the titles rather
[2:14:05] than a
[2:14:06] name and out of those titles they get a
[2:14:09] trinity that's where the three different
[2:14:11] gods comes from three gods and there
[2:14:13] anytime you have three Gods you're a
[2:14:15] heathen it's Heathen isn't to believe in
[2:14:17] any than one God there's one Lord One
[2:14:20] Faith one baptism only one God and that
[2:14:22] God is the Lord Jesus Christ all power
[2:14:24] is given to him
[2:14:26] amen all
[2:14:30] right now then when they heard this they
[2:14:32] were pricked in their hearts and said
[2:14:34] unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles
[2:14:36] men and Brethren what shall we do how
[2:14:38] many remembers Peter was given the keys
[2:14:40] to the kingdom then said Peter unto them
[2:14:42] repent repentance of sins and remissions
[2:14:45] of sins should be preached in his name
[2:14:46] beginning at Jerusalem right here we are
[2:14:48] in Jerusalem and he's doing exactly what
[2:14:50] Jesus told him to do there's a lot of
[2:14:53] people say well i' rather take what
[2:14:54] Jesus did than Peter did no Peter did
[2:14:56] exactly what Jesus said to do and if you
[2:14:59] do what Jesus said as far as just taking
[2:15:01] the titles you're not doing what Jesus
[2:15:03] said you're actually not doing what
[2:15:05] Jesus said because he said use the name
[2:15:08] but he put it in such a way isn't that
[2:15:10] something called a great doctrine that
[2:15:11] came out of it into false ranks
[2:15:14] amen what shall we do men and brethren
[2:15:18] Peter said unto them
[2:15:21] repent every and be baptized every one
[2:15:23] of you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:15:25] Christ in the name of Jesus Christ for
[2:15:27] the remission of your sins and you shall
[2:15:30] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[2:15:32] the promise is to you there's people
[2:15:34] that believe that the Holy Ghost was
[2:15:35] only for the apostles only for the 12 or
[2:15:37] this that or the other no they got it in
[2:15:39] the max 10 they got it you know 3,000 on
[2:15:41] the day of Pentecost and and all the way
[2:15:43] over in Acts 19 amen there was those
[2:15:45] that were following uh you know John the
[2:15:48] Baptist and they had to get Reb baptized
[2:15:50] let me tell you something if you ain't
[2:15:51] never been baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:15:52] Christ if by immersion you wasn't
[2:15:55] baptized right you
[2:15:57] need only one way there's only one true
[2:16:00] baptism this is right here nobody ever
[2:16:04] was baptized in titles always in the
[2:16:05] name I can take you to many places where
[2:16:07] he did amen for Mission and you shall
[2:16:10] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I
[2:16:12] like that for the promises to you to
[2:16:13] your children to them that are far off
[2:16:15] even as many as the Lord are call the
[2:16:17] last as one to come in if God's going to
[2:16:19] do any more calling your promis the
[2:16:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost which I
[2:16:24] believe they have I believe they have
[2:16:25] the Holy Ghost already amen even the
[2:16:28] house of Cornelius the Holy Ghost fell
[2:16:29] upon them is that right and then Peter
[2:16:32] commanded them to be baptized in the
[2:16:34] name of the Lord Jesus after they got
[2:16:37] the baptism the Holy Ghost don't put God
[2:16:38] In The Box he can give you be a baptism
[2:16:40] before after whatever it's when you
[2:16:42] truly believe is when the baptism is and
[2:16:45] how many knows that this is just an
[2:16:46] outward showing
[2:16:49] this doesn't baptize you with the Holy
[2:16:51] Ghost it just makes you amen a candidate
[2:16:53] for God to give you the Holy Ghost but
[2:16:55] it'll be based upon your faith there's
[2:16:57] many of people go down in this water
[2:16:59] come up and never get the baptism of the
[2:17:01] Holy Ghost folks it's your faith in God
[2:17:04] that God honors and gives you the
[2:17:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost but this is an
[2:17:08] outward showing amen because water don't
[2:17:11] save you the blood saves you amen the
[2:17:14] Holy Ghost saves you praise the Lord
[2:17:18] one more oh we're getting running late
[2:17:20] is that okay little little extra for the
[2:17:23] Lord would be all right right amen acts
[2:17:26] 4 and verse 7 and when they sat them in
[2:17:29] the midst and asked Deering them by what
[2:17:31] power or by what name have you done this
[2:17:34] amen when they laid hands on him you
[2:17:35] know and healed that man then Peter
[2:17:38] filled with the Holy Ghost said unto him
[2:17:39] ye rulers of the people of Elders and
[2:17:41] and Elders of Israel if we be be this
