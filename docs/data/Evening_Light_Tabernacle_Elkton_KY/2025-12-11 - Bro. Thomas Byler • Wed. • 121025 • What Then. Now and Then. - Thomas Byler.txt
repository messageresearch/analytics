And we have several prayer requests tonight we want to take to the Lord in prayer.

But we want to continue to remember Sister Peggy that God will just continue to help her, and also Sister Parish. And we also want to remember Sister McCagan and the the girls that God will just continue to move in their lives tonight. And I just really had them on my heart. and and I know God's going to do a miracle for him. He's already done a miracle for him. We're just trusting in him the rest of the way. And also, we want to remember sister Adriana, she's not feeling well tonight. And just pray that God will touch her body. And just pray that the Lord will heal her tonight. And also, some of the Wade family is sick. They didn't say which ones were, but we want to remember them tonight in prayer that God would just touch their bodies. And also I received a message before church that my uncle he's in his 90s he's fell again and and uh he's at that stage they're going to have to probably put him in assisted living and I know he's not going to be too happy with that but he's having some issues and and my aunt Brenda she's been in the hospital in Nashville they had overmedicated her and she's doing a lot better.

We've got a few want to give a testimony, so we'll just make it a press a testimony meeting next Wednesday. Amen. Next Wednesday night. And um can't think of any other announcements. Let's just bow our heads. Lord Jesus, we come before you, Lord. Grateful, Father, to be able to assemble ourselves together once again. Lord, in your name, Lord, listening to your spirit, believing, Father, that you'll come down and speak to our hearts, Lord, by your Holy Spirit tonight, Father, search our lives, search our hearts, help us to prepare for that great day that lays ahead, Lord. We ask, God, that you'll just help me to get out of the way, Lord Jesus, and open the ears of the of the hearers, Lord. For we know, Father, that having an ear to hear is real important, Lord. So we ask God that you'll help each one of our ears to be open. Father, the same way with those may be streaming tonight. We ask God that they would lay aside whatever they're doing and focus in Lord Jesus of what the Holy Spirit would have to say to the church tonight. And we just be careful to give you the praise, the honor, and the glory now in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Amen. Do feel like I've got a little message. Amen. Uh tonight. Amen. And so we'll just get right into it. Kind of different. Amen. But uh I just pray the Lord help me help me. Amen. Period. To bring it out in the way that kind of God brought it to me. And I'll just go to the scriptures basically that come to mind when I begin on this. And I think it's in u second Peter. Second Peter. And if you have bring the title up if you will. I'll give you my title. Kind of a different title. Amen. What then? Now and then. Amen. That's very different, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Very different. Amen. But that's the best way I knew to put it. &gt;&gt; All right. So, second Peter 3 and we'll begin with verse three. Knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers and walking after their own lusts and saying, "Where is the promise of his coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God, the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water, whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished. But the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men. But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing that the day of the Lord is as the day with the Lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise. Amen. I got to stop there just just for a second. Amen. Don't you believe that that's the way it's going to be when we get over there? One day is going to be like a thousand years and one day and a thousand years like one day. Amen. Can you imagine a thousand years being like one day? Can't imagine it. But the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness, but is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in a night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. The earth also, and the works thereof that are therein, shall be burnt up, seeing that all these things shall be dissolved. manner of persons ought to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for the hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless we according to the pro his promise look for a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that thee may be found of him in peace and without spot and blameless. May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. You can be seated. A that this really, really, really applies to you and to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. It really applies to you and to me. And I'm not talking about being here when the world burns. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about wherefore, beloved, seeing that you look for such things. Amen. Because what are we looking for? Verse 13. Nevertheless, we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. &gt;&gt; Why are we here tonight? Why do people listen tonight perhaps? Amen. It's because you've got faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. because you got faith. If you didn't have faith, you wouldn't probably not be here. You wouldn't listen. Because what is faith? Faith, brother Bam says, is a long range vision. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Faith looks to the future. &gt;&gt; It looks ahead, way ahead. If you don't have faith, then all you do is look right down here in front of us. It's like binoculars. Faith gives you binoculars to see what's way out there. But if you don't have faith, you're only paying attention to what's right in front of us. &gt;&gt; You're only paying attention to your body's needs. Amen. Your physical needs, the things of the earth, the things of the world. That's what most people are concerned about. They're not concerned about going to church on Wednesday night. They're not concerned about uh church or anything because they're con too concerned with things right in front of them. They don't have a vision. They don't have faith. But faith inspires us. Faith causes us to look in the future. Faith causes us to come together and to prepare ourselves for something, to get ready for something. It's nothing like being ready for whatever you plan to do. &gt;&gt; And it's terrible if you have to come to a place Amen. Amen. Perhaps. Amen. Uh, you know, you come to the end of the year and all of your taxes are due and you can't pay them and you're going to have to pay the January amount and it's going to be way bunch, you know, but it's nice when you come to the end there and and you've got things taken care of. &gt;&gt; And how many know the end of this world is coming? &gt;&gt; People are going to have to pay for their sin. They're going to have to pay their dues. They can they can live in pleasure. They can enjoy the pleasures of of sin for a season, but guess what? They're going to have to eventually pay. &gt;&gt; Amen. But how many's glad that we've got a prepaid going on? &gt;&gt; We have prepaid. We paid beforehand long before we ever come to judge. We already paid. That's why the uh judge is not going to ask, "Hey, you're going to have to pay." That's because he says, "You already paid." Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're not worried about the fire. &gt;&gt; Are you really not worried about the fire? &gt;&gt; Are you really not worried about the fire? &gt;&gt; If you really ain't worried about the fire, you could be a happy person. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz how many know as I study this and as I bring this out and teach you just what kind of fire this is going to be, it's going to be fire beyond your comprehension. It's going to be hotter than you can ever imagine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many knows we're living real close to the day of that fire? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me just warn you ahead of time. This is a Sunday morning service on a Wednesday night and I don't want to go too long, but I want to try to get out what the Lord wants out. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Okay. Malachi 4 says, "Behold, the day cometh." How many believe that he was going to send you Elijah to before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord? How many knows that Elijah has already come and gone for over 550 years almost? It's come and it's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, the day cometh that shall burn as a oven. This is what I call the then. Amen. There's the now and then there's the then. You can pay now or you can pay then. You choose now where you're going to spend your eternal destination. Amen. People never don't worry about the then. We do. &gt;&gt; Sure we do. And the now the now determines where you're going to be then. And we want to look in the past and see others who wish they could come from where they are. Amen. Have another now experience now and then. They would love to come back and have an experience of being able to have another chance. Amen. But their now is past. So now let me finish this. And all the proud that shall burn as an oven. All the proud, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up, sayaeth the Lord of hosts, and it shall leave them neither root nor branch. Amen. So, we see there's a fire coming, ain't it, right? Let me uh just kind of lay a little I like the way that brother Brandham said it, so I'm going to let him say it to us. that. Okay, I want you to go with me a little piece. Some of you people go back. Some of you elderly people sitting here up to 40 years old. Pass back with me for the next 20ish years back. And look how fast that progress has come. How much faster things are developing in the last 20 years than it did in the previous 20 years. Watch how much faster them 20 years did the second block of 20 than it did with the third block of 20. Amen. And did you know only about 150 years ago or less time that man was just almost as primitive as it was in the beginning 2,000 years ago. How many knows that was true? Think about the 1800s and so forth, the Civil War with their with their uh muzzle loaders. Didn't that what they fought with? Muzzle loaders. I don't know about you, but they had bullets flying at them and they had to get the stick out and pour the powder in and quickly get the book. Come on, get it in there. Here goes one. He didn't get his bullet in. It was terrible &gt;&gt; to have to reload. We would we laugh because we realize, hey man, that nowadays, can you imagine I want them gatling guns? You know how many know the Chinese one time I think brother Brian would know about it over in Korea and different places. They would China would send waves after wave of human. They thought that they could just absolutely overwhelm a smaller amount of people by just sending a bunch of humans. And Amen. If one died, he'd grab the other guy, grab the gun, and he'd go and and they couldn't do it. No matter how much they waved, them gatling guns and them machine guns just mowed them down like a bunch of grass. You can't just throw a bunch of humans. You got to be smarter than that. But that's what it's progressed. All right. All right. So he says just primitive 1800s just primitive way back you know what you can see some of them back then that they still had carry swords ain't that right carry swords can you imagine a day is Lord why my gracious I'm going to bring a sword to to me I'll tell you what I'm going to laugh I'm going to say if what in the world you bringing a gun to a gun I mean a knife to a gunfight for it'd be a joke wouldn't it better be real good and you better be very fast and very accurate and throwing a little blade or something cuz you know but how many think about it and brother Brandon brings a point out here that they were just as primitive as at the beginning 2,000 years ago did you notice how things are traveling so fast and I thought about today how many knows that right now things are moving so fast man it's just been you know just the other day and my phone will say hey you need to update you know you need to get an update another update that many changes and they got AI coming out and they got artificial intelligence and I don't I don't even know what hardly AI is but I think it's artificial intelligence right some kind of smart system that's supposed to do all kinds of crazy stuff and I don't even know what it is but it's un almost unimaginable the things that they're coming up with but at the same time the Bible said they would get smarter they get wiser but they'd get weaker their morality is gone. &gt;&gt; Sin is on the rampage. &gt;&gt; And just in a hundred years, and I'll just I'll I'll read this here. He says in the He's that here's the way time started at the first 6,000 years of life, we moved on like this, and we've never changed a bit until we come up now to the last hundred years, and we're just speeding like that. We got the same man with the same mental faculties. Every scientific thing that ever was on the earth was back there was back there. The same things they're making use of today. The same man with the same brain. He had the same brain that he's got now. But all at once something happened, didn't it? Oh, how we could say that this world, how can this world stand much longer? &gt;&gt; Amen. It reminds me of brother Baptist. He says, "Even wars have come to an end. You can't have war. Do you realize how easily Putin could end that war in Ukraine? He could end it in one day with his nukes, but he knows not to do that. Only God is keeping him from it. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Sure. Because as far as I know, Ukraine don't have any. If they do, boy, here we go. Right. But he's at wars at an end. National uh governments are at democracy's at an end. How many everything is at an end? &gt;&gt; We've come down to the end people. Morality is at an end. Look at just the last few month a week years. And it really sped up when our Supreme Court judge, you know, about marriage, you know, being between man and man if it wants to be from there. It just went worse. Amen. And we could talk about how schools used to be and and the punishment kids would get and this that or the other. And look at them now. Look what they're doing now. Going in there and shooting each other up. Killing a bunch of kids. Killing their teacher. It's terrible, isn't it? The morality is gone. I didn't get all the quotes, but you know how brother Bam says national life is at an end. Marriage is at an end. divorce, one out of two out of three or I don't know what it is anymore. It's very hard to keep a marriage together nowadays. Marriage is at an end. The world's at an end. We're at the end. &gt;&gt; And it's come to it. talk about they've got enough power now when they come up with the nuclear and everything, you know, enough power to burn it over many, many times over. Brother Bam says, you can't really even have a war without risking a nuclear war. And look at how Putin's threatening. Ain't that right? Threaten, threaten, threaten. &gt;&gt; He can't do it until I I'm gone. &gt;&gt; What did I say? He can't do it till Yeah. I wanted you to say I'm cuz I want you to be gone, too. &gt;&gt; Can't do it till I'm gone. &gt;&gt; How many's glad to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; How many glad to have the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; How many's glad that when all the other kingdoms come to an end, your kingdom has just started? &gt;&gt; Bible says this kingdom or his kingdom that shall never be no end. Russia, America, North Korea, all of them, they'll come to an end, but your kingdom will never come to an end. And that's worth shouting about. &gt;&gt; I receive the kingdom that cannot be shaken. Everything that can be shaken will be shaken. I hope you're so grounded until you can't be shook. &gt;&gt; Nothing can shake you. Why? Because the kingdom inside of you is God's kingdom. It can't be shaken. Trials can't shake it. Hardships can't shake it. Ain't nothing can shake it. Tribulation can't shake it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. Thing wants to hurt a little bit. Must be getting old. The old ticker wants to hurt. I'm going to have to calm down. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now notice he talks about this. All of a sudden something happened. We can never the world can never survive an atomic war. It can never survive a hydrogen bomb war. He says they talk about if you if they if one explodes, if one goes up and gets on that radar, guess what? The chain causes a chain reaction and it'll go into it. One will break here and one there. Amen. Then those chains of relay will get together and what will happen? The war will start. He says the other day, I heard on the radio the biggest scientists in the world give the world 10 years to total annihilation. Imagine that. Back then they thought it was 10 years. I want you to think about right now and the very possibility that within the next 10 years we'll be there. &gt;&gt; For one thing, that generation of Israel, they're getting old, so it can't be all that much longer. It's getting close. It's getting close. And guess what? How many is concerned this morning or this evening about the then? Where will you be then? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Total annihilation. That's not scripturally speaking. That's scientifically speaking. 10 years for total annihilation. And that wouldn't contradict the Bible. What the Bible said, the heavens and earth will be on fire. Just sweep over the deserts and everything. There'll be nothing left. Then he says, "And then where's your soul going to be at that time, men and women, 150, remember 500 years from tonight, your tombstone may blow over right here out in the desert somewhere, which is way out yonder." How many heard the howling winds today? That wind was howling, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; Just the howling. Butter Bam says, you know, 500 years howling winds blowing against it, your tombstone there, but where's your soul? I mean, know better has a tombstone. Amen. After tribulation period, when that when that great fire comes, perhaps his will be tilted over, brother Brandham. Amen. Where will your soul be? Tonight is a soularching message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Soul prison. Now he says now the souls now in prison. He says souls that are now in prison. Now the soul of man is not the body of man. It's the soul. Amen. And he goes into detail. So that's what we're dealing with. How many knows that that's what we're looking at tonight is our soul. Not this body. This body will perish. But yet that one on the inside is created in the image of God. It's spirit being. And guess what? How many knows that when you die, you don't die. Well, let me clear that up for you. When your body dies, you don't die. &gt;&gt; You are still somewhere. Yep. You're going to be awake. Yep. You're going to be conscious. &gt;&gt; You're going to be somewhere. That soul is going to be somewhere. And where that soul will be depends on what kind of choice you make now. &gt;&gt; Where that soul will be then depends on what choice you make now. People don't realize the opportunity, the privilege that we have. How many believe we're a privileged people right now? You be go beyond that curtain of time. You go beyond this life and you're not so privileged anymore. Where will your soul howling winds blowing itself your tombstone? Where is your Where will your soul be? Now is the time to think about things. Amen. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now is the time to think about things. I know. And we know that at the time that the time of is near at hand, we see the world in a quivering, shaking condition, knowing that the atoms will soon be burning. Listen to this. Do you know that when they set off the first atom bomb, they were scared? because everything is made out of atoms and they were afraid it was going to burn the whole earth earth up. It's going to cause a chain reaction and it's going to burn everything up. So they kind of hesitated, you know, it's like doing something for the first time, you know, is what is it going to do? Listen to what the prophet says. See the heavens and uh will be on fire as the apostle Peter said it will burn with fervent heat. Brother Bam says the atoms of the earth will catch fire because remember one place he talks about that the heavens and the earth is going to be dissolved and then he talks about that these that there's going to be a nuclear there's going to be a a nuclear war. How many believes that he taught that that man destroys himself. So the way I'm seeing it this morning, I mean this evening is that these bombs will set it off. That's right. Burn with fervent heat. The atoms of the earth will catch fire. Then there will be a relay and there'll not even be dust left of the people. I was uh hunting the other day and I was up on top of a mountain. I could see about 20 miles or so and I thought, "Wow, God is fixing to change this whole thing." How many knows he's going to &gt;&gt; the whole earth? It's hard to fathom, hard for us to imagine that not just the whole earth is going to be on fire, but the heavens will be on fire. &gt;&gt; How many know it's going to be hot? &gt;&gt; Amen. What are we saying tonight? We're saying the same thing. Preaching the same gospel. Preaching under the same anointing that Noah did when he said, "It's going to rain. It's going to rain for 120 years. Get ready. Prepare yourself." &gt;&gt; How many believe that we got to prepare ourselves for what lays ahead? &gt;&gt; We have to make preparations. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you made preparations to go there? &gt;&gt; Nothing else is going to matter. The things that we hold so dear aren't going to matter. &gt;&gt; How many believes we ought to focus on what matters. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. All right. Nothing. There won't even be dust left. And then what Lord again he says maybe at 500 years from now an old tombstone blow over yonder into howling winds burning blistering sun when it lays near the sun for its purification before the millennium. Maybe the name of some of the people here will be written on that. Where will their wondering soul be? May they not look to this modern world now, but they may look the way to Christ, listen to the message and to the messenger that's speaking to their hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, down here, he says it says it another one in investments. He says, "May we invest our time, our talent." How many believes &gt;&gt; when he preached on investments, he preached on that rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? When he had the opportunity, when the now time came, now is your day of salvation. How many believe that? Today you will hear his voice. Harden not your hearts as in the provocation. &gt;&gt; How many believe that's a message? That's God's gospel. But David said it all the way all the way back in uh Psalms. He says, "Oh, come let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel before the Lord our maker. For he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the sheep of his hand." Today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. I'm going to go back through time and I'm going way back to Sodom and Gomorrah. We're going back to Noah, all the way back to the angels, all the way back, all these different places of history where people had their chance. They had their now and they made the wrong choice. &gt;&gt; But we humans, we just don't seem to learn. We don't seem from learn from our mom and dad's mistakes. We don't learn from other people's mistakes. We just go barreling on through our lives making the same ones. God help us. See today if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts as in the provocation, as in the day of the temptation in the wilderness. How many know when Moses spoke, when God spoke, they hardened their hearts. They complained. They murmured. They would not believe. And you today, their souls are out there somewhere wishing they could just have another now time. How many knows Elvis Presley wishes he had another now time? Michael Jackson wishes he had another now time, a time to come back. That richer man, Amen, that lifted up his soul in hell. Oh, I said go warn my brother. How much he would have liked to had another chance. How many glad that we have a chance right now. Right now is your chance. World right now is your chance. Now you choose &gt;&gt; where you're going to be then. Amen. Harden not your hearts. Don't make excuses. Give God your all. &gt;&gt; Amen. As in the temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me, proved me saw my works. 40 years long was I grieved with this generation and said it is a people that do heir in their heart. Can we say that about this generation? This generation aired in their heart. Oh, the queen of the south shall rise up and condemn her generation because she came from the uttermost parts of the world to hear the wisdom and the discernment that Solomon had and a greater than Solomon was there. Those Pharisees didn't learn nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can say in this hour, God has come and the very same things and a hundred times more than he did when he was here on earth. But people still harden their hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. They refuse. They in their hearts. They have not known my ways. They don't know God in simplicity. They don't know God in humility. guy don't know God might just use a hillbilly out of Kentucky. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; With his hints and totes and fetches, but when he come up here, he wasn't by himself. Amen. He had somebody here represented him. Amen. He said, "If he don't come, you don't got to believe what I say." But he'd be there. He was there every time. &gt;&gt; The people go into the basement and say the sun's not shining when it is shining. Christ is here. &gt;&gt; But they refuse to believe it. And they're going to end up in the same place that the angels that kept not their first estate. The same place Israel did. Jesus said they're everyone dead. That's lost, gone in the regions of the lost. Wish they wouldn't have been complainers and murmurss. Wish they had believed the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. unto whom I swear in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest. Amen. Paul said the same thing in Hebrews 3 verse 7. Wherefore the Holy Spirit saith today, if you hear his voice, harden not your hearts as in the provocation the day of temptation in the wilderness. Amen. Oh, Stephen, he comes to my mind right now. Stephen, how many knows? He says, "Oh, you stiff neck and hard of heart, you always resist the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; They had such a hard heart until when he told them the truth, they got mad, nashed upon him with his their teeth, &gt;&gt; took him out and stoned him. Wonder where they are today. How many cares about where you going to be tomorrow? Where you going to be in another 500 years? &gt;&gt; Where will you be? &gt;&gt; Cuz if you set your goals right and you set your heart right, you'll get your priorities right. &gt;&gt; How many believes you got to keep your priorities right? &gt;&gt; It's easy to get a caught up in this lukewarm age. Get away from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll tell you what, it ain't no time you get away from God. Depression sets in. &gt;&gt; Amen. All kinds of things set in. Backslidness sets in. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Church isn't important anymore. &gt;&gt; Wednesday nights ain't important anymore. &gt;&gt; Our attendance dwindles. &gt;&gt; Why? What's more important? Sure, if you got your ox in it, you understand? But the Bible says if you love the world or the things of the world, the love of God ain't in you. &gt;&gt; See, if you love the world and the things of the world more than you love God, your priorities are wrong. &gt;&gt; Hello. How many knows it's important? Cuz when we get over there, we're going to we're glad that we've lived for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad I live for Jesus. &gt;&gt; It wasn't so bad on a dark Wednesday night to go, Amen. get in our car and go and worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I did it. I do it for Jesus. We do it for Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. See folks in Revelations 9 and verse 20 it says, "And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues, yet they repented not of their works of their hands, that they should not worship devils or idols of gold or silver or brass or stone or wood, uh, which neither see nor here walk." How many know people will worship anything almost? &gt;&gt; Whatever you put in front of God is your idol. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pretty strong. You love him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, let's look at this again. Brother Bam says, "To think of this world, Brother Bam had a picture of it." Amen. I'll never forget some of the loneliest loneliest times is to be in my bed in Amish house somewhere in the bed and the winter has set in. Amen. Brother Woody isn't here, but when we were taking his mom to the grave, as they were taking the casket from the road over to where they were going to bury her, the leaves, the wind came and just the leaves all come down. They were blowing down. I thought, "Yeah, that's right." How many knows in the fall of the year the leaves fall off the trees, you know, are the leaves represent old age, gray hair, losing strength. Amen. Losing their grip and just falling off. Amen. And she was falling off the earth, dropping down. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the cold winter comes. Like I said, we'd have that wind ha howl and the wind would be blowing sideways snow and somehow or other. I don't know if I can imitate it or not, but it would kind of kind of sound like this. It was spooky. How many knows that's what we about hear out there? The cold winds &gt;&gt; of sin and immorality blowing. It's scary. &gt;&gt; We're not at home here. &gt;&gt; We're looking for another place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We hear it howling. That's right. The winds howling blow across this world when it's blowed up with an atomic bomb laying out yonder in the sphere of the sun. Howling winds blowing across it. 150 or 500 years from that tonight. There'll be tombstone hitting that sign with maybe our names on them. Laying yonder whirling in a howling the winds the hot won't be cold but it'll be hot blistering heat from the sun. But where will your poor soul be? I had one more that I Let me see here. I had one more I wanted to read. Amen. I can't find it just now. Nope. Where will your soul be? Praise the Lord. Now, let's go back a little bit and think about this. Here it is. right here. I never finished the quote. Maybe when our tombstones will be floated up in the sands, when the howling winds are going, when this world, now notice, when this world is swept into the sun yonder, thrown out like it was at the end of the destruction. Instead of it being thrown from the sun, &gt;&gt; it'll be into the sun. Can you imagine? Brother Brand is paint painting a picture here that it'll be closer to the sun. Take it right up there close to the sun or whichever way it'll be. And you can imagine how hot it'll be. You talk about sweating 110 degrees. You get a little closer. You bring that thing closer, it will be very, very hot. Amen. No more water but fire this time. Amen. And the sands howl across the earth before the great millennium. Amen. And our tombstones come up. Dr. So and so, Bishop So and So, what good did it do when our souls are yonder somewhere in eternity? Amen. Somewhere in eternity. How many knows that all those lost souls are somewhere out there in eternity? That's right. Menite preacher made a statement. He says we when he was preaching the funeral to make something we just we haven't figured life out yet and we don't really know what's over there on the other side because we haven't went there. I thought I'm glad that we know a little bit about life &gt;&gt; and I'm glad what we know what life's all about &gt;&gt; and I'm glad that we had somebody because brother Brandon when he went to souls and preached the souls in prison maybe we'll get have time to read it yet but he said I've been in both places and he described what it was like going down in the regions of the lost and where they are &gt;&gt; how horrible it will be how horrible it would be how horrible it is amen. And listen to what he says. How many knows those souls that did not choose God, did not choose their message for their they are in the same place were in prison. Brother Brandon when he preached to souls in prison now you can listen to it but he talks about Jesus having had a three pulls and the third pull was actually going and preaching to the souls that were in prison. This is where I was fixing to go to into my scriptures in first Peter second Peter 2. We'll lay a foundation before we read brother Bam's message here. He says, "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment." Amen. How many knows? That's right. They're in chains of darkness. Reserved unto judgment. And he spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly. Amen. There he's talking about Noah's day, Noah's group, that whole world. &gt;&gt; My my my Don't you just wish that you could get people to believe? &gt;&gt; Get people to believe that God destroyed them. Everyone but eight. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's going to destroy everybody that is not in Christ in our generation. &gt;&gt; The fire's coming. &gt;&gt; The judgment's going to fall. But this is your chance. This is your hour. &gt;&gt; This is your now. Today is the day of salvation. &gt;&gt; Today, God is speaking. Today, God reaches out his hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even better said, you know, even Jesus said, he says, you know, he held his hand up, but they would not &gt;&gt; to Israel, he held his hand up, but they would not. Proverbs, I think in the second chapter, he says, "When your calamity cometh upon you in your desolation, your destruction, when I reached out my hand, you laughed. You made fun. You laughed." He says, "But when your calamity comes, I will laugh. I will laugh at your calamity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your desolation comes. You think Hollywood actors I read I heard seen something in the news the other day where some of them uh you know they die terribly. Those movie stars those rich people Elvis died terribly. His wife left him. He was with another woman on drugs. Couldn't get off the drugs. got fat and got finally fell over off the commode, I guess. Died alone there in a terrible way. How about Michael Jackson and all that? Think about it. What they would do to have a church service on a Wednesday night &gt;&gt; to have the preacher say, "Why don't you come and accept the Lord?" I wouldn't doubt, but they'd come up. &gt;&gt; Sure. But guess what? They had the chance, right? They made their choice just like we make our choice of how we're going to live our lives. Is it going to be for Christ or is it going to be for ourselves? &gt;&gt; Cuz Jesus said, "If you follow me," Amen. You got to be willing to forsake all to follow me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you get over there and you're over there, you're going to be glad that you for was willing to forsake all to follow Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He spared not the old world. Amen. Brought the flood in upon the ungodly, turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes and condemned them with an overflow, making them an example of those unto those that should afterward live ungodly. Amen. Even Sodom and Gomorrah. How many know they were given a chance? Two angels went down there. How many believes that that brother Bam typed that with the age you and I are living? &gt;&gt; Billy Graham, all Roberts preached a Pentecostal, preached to the Baptist, the Method, all of those. And they wearied themselves to find a door. They couldn't find a door. But brother Bam says there was another angel. The angel of the Lord was with Abraham up there discerning Sarah's thoughts and intents of her heart. &gt;&gt; We were not on in Sodom. And when the world is falling apart, aren't you glad that your life is not falling apart? Your world's not falling apart. Your family doesn't have to fall apart. No. God is restoring us. In the middle of everything else falling apart, there's a restoration that takes place. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you need to be restored, God wants to restore you. Maybe the joy of your salvation, &gt;&gt; maybe your first love, &gt;&gt; God is in the restoring business. &gt;&gt; He's going to have a bride without spot and without wrinkle. &gt;&gt; How many believes? And he's going to do it by the messenger that he send, the message that he send. Come out of her, my people. Amen. Have we got any of my people here tonight? &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm some of them my people that you receive take not for take not of her sins that you receive not of plagues. &gt;&gt; Woo. I don't know about that. I just love that little story of that wagon train going out west. Amen. And that little boy said to his sister, "Don't you worry, sis. We're standing where the fire has already been." How many believe that we've made reservations? We already have been through the fire. Amen. We're going to get some prepay here. We're praying here and say, "God, forgive me." We're repenting and getting it bleached in the blood of Jesus Christ. Washed in the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Praise the Lord. How many knows when Moses spoke that was the time for them? When Jesus spoke that was the time for them. He said unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins. &gt;&gt; They could not believe that who he was you are going to die in your sins. Amen. Jude says it this way. I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this. I that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that believed not. and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he had reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. Then he mentions again Jude does Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities like man are giving them over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. But notice he says, "The angels which kept not their estate, they have reserved an everlasting chains of darkness." Brother Brandon when he was describing his vision when he was shot, his buddy shot him when he was uh accidentally when they were hunting and he was almost dead. Doctor wanted to cut his both legs off right at the waist. He says, "Don't do that. Just cut me on off off of here." Brother Brand told the doctor. In other words, finish him off. Brother Brandon was a sinner cuz he's so shot up, meat hanging everywhere. It was so terrible. Isn't it something that God would allow his servant to go through something like that? Then sometimes we wonder, well, why God lets things happen to us? Look what he allowed to happen to him. How many knows brother Bannon couldn't die? &gt;&gt; Not even when he tried to shoot himself. &gt;&gt; No. So whenever those he said it was a shotgun shot in his legs, shot both of his legs. You can only imagine God allowing it but yet not allowing it to hit certain arteries that would have bled him out. Hello. He spared him and he said the doctor decided to operate on him and everything and he said I got great legs today. G brother Rand said great leg. That's God for you. How many believe God? &gt;&gt; How many glad God takes care of you? &gt;&gt; God. Aren't we glad tonight that we've got a God that cares about us? He watches out for us. He protects us. He started a good work in his brother Brad and he's going to finish it. He started this. My &gt;&gt; Amen. You get away from God. I hope God makes you so miserable that you just can't stand it. &gt;&gt; And you flee to the horns of the altar and say, "God, forgive me. I can't take this no more. I want to be right with you." &gt;&gt; That'll be a good sign that you're of God. But you keep barreling right on down the wrong road and you ignore that little clusk, that still small voice in your heart. God have mercy on your soul. If that's that little voice drowns out and it doesn't talk to you anymore, &gt;&gt; I hate where you end up at. &gt;&gt; A terrible place. You thank God for that still small voice. Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many tonight, how many tonight can say honestly, don't raise your hand if it ain't true, but that still small voice is getting louder and louder in your heart. &gt;&gt; One, two, three, four, &gt;&gt; five, six. &gt;&gt; Hello. It is in mine. I'm thankful for it &gt;&gt; because guess what? We're close, folks. I mean, as your pastor, I tell you, we're close &gt;&gt; and we need to search our hearts. You need to search your heart to see if you've got everything ready. &gt;&gt; Could happen any time. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Brother Bam says, "I was so weak. The vision struck me. I was so weak. I'd lost all that blood. I thought I was sinking into an endless eternity. Many of you has heard me say that before. Sinking into an endless eternity. He says, "And the first thing I was going like through clouds and then through darkness, sinking down, down, down, and the first thing you know, I got into the regions of the lost. I screamed and I looked and there was just everything. There was no foundation to it. I could never stop falling. You know, I I I I thought that I think in my own self I says, you know, there's nothing there. There's no floor for you to walk around on. It's a bottomless pit. Endless eternity. Brother Bapt says he was fallen and fallen and fallen. What a horrible feeling. Falling for an eternity. It looked like I was going to fall and there was no stopping nowhere. Amen. My and he says it this way and oh he says I saw the vision of both sides by the grace of God. I don't say that's sacriiggious and if it's wrong God forgive forgive me. I believe I've seen both places. I've been in both places. I don't know about you, but I really appreciate that God allowed brother Brandham to go beyond the regions of the blessed so that you and I in our mind have comfort about knowing where you're going. &gt;&gt; How many knows that's a big comfort? Not all churches, not all people can say that. We really don't know what's over there. We know that about 20 feet up in the air are all the redeemed of this age and they're happy. there in the splendor of their youth. They're as bright as they ever were. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm thankful. And we know that going the other way is terrible. &gt;&gt; It's a terrible place over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, notice I've seen the red. &gt;&gt; I've seen the lost and where they were at. That's why I stand as your brother today to warn you to flee from that downward path. Don't you never go down that road. &gt;&gt; You've got everything to live for that blessed upward way where the redeemed are in joy and peace. They can't sin. They can't be sorry. Almighty, they're perfect. I've seen both places. He says, I realize that's an awful statement to for a person to make, but God is my judge. I solemnly believed I've seen both places. Hello. There's a lot of people out there on YouTube and have seen a lot of different bunch of stuff. It might be and it might not be, but I'll stick to this right here. &gt;&gt; Oh, far be it from any person. &gt;&gt; If you are standing with hot wires bored through you, tormented every day, it not be that like that devil torment that that is in that place. There could be nothing. No human mind. The human mind couldn't comprehend what that regions of the lost is. There's no way to explain it. There's no way to explain what the regions of the blessed is. Amen. One is so horrible and the other is so great. So if anybody hears me, I'm getting to be an old man. I'm seven, eight years older than brother Brandon was. I'm getting to be an old man. I don't know how much longer I've got. Brother Bam says, I'll soon be 55 years old. I don't know. He says, but don't you never go down that to the regions of the lost. You can't picture hell being that bad. Whatever you do, oh my, don't you forget this that the regions of the blessed. I would say like St. Paul did, eye has not ear seen and ear has not heard how great it is over there. So listen to what brother Bram says. Stop. So stop. If you're listening to the tape, let me say this. If you're listening to my voice tonight, Amen. If you're listening, turn the machine off and repent. &gt;&gt; If you're not saved, get right with God. &gt;&gt; That's my message for Evening Light Tabernacle. And anybody listening, get right with God. This is your chime. This is God's voice telling you, "Now is your time to decide where you're going to be in a little bit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or then &gt;&gt; the angels, look where they are. Noah's group, look where they are. Look where the Sodom and Gomorrah are. Look where the Pharisees are. Look at where all those people are in the regions of the lost. Hello. &gt;&gt; But hallelujah. How many's glad there's another region? It's a region of the blessed &gt;&gt; the blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Joy unspeakable, full of glory. But he says, "Turn it off. Get saved." In other words, push stop. Butterb says, "Get right now. Don't wait. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; I am saying this by firsthand experience. Amen. That I've been there making that statement that I have been in both places. How many knows that Jesus final ministry after he died that his soul went to hell and preached to all of these that were in prison. &gt;&gt; The scripture says it. He went and preached to the souls that were in prison. Can you imagine that? Could not be saved. Brother man said couldn't be saved after Jesus had clearly came identified himself and prophesied that after the days of his prophecy through those spiritually scripturally identified the people rejected him. That's right. And he preached then after they rejected him here the ones that had a possibility to be saved. Remember when he was preaching there was a possibility for anyone to be saved. How many believe that's the truth? &gt;&gt; When the preaching's going forth there's a possibility for people to be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't know who they are. They're predestinated. But after the days of his preaching, his ministry continued on cuz the last group that he preached to was the souls that were in hell that could not be forgiven. Amen. Now, in this same message, Brother Bam says, "Don't believe that there's a burning hell right now because God doesn't actually judge. He does not punish somebody before first judging them. It'll be till after the judgment. But this hell, these regions of the loss. But Abraham said it's worse. It's worse than a burning hell to know that you're lost. Just that feeling just, oh, it's a terrible place. Amen. And I didn't stop finish my thought here after in a little while because remember I said that we were made in the image of God. And when our body dies, our soul does not die. It's still alive out there somewhere. How many knows where your soul dies? Jesus said, "Don't fear him that can destroy your body, but fear him that can boy both destroy your body and your soul in hell." Amen. The lake of fire according to Revelations 21 there, the lake of fire. This is the lake of fire. That is the second death. That's where your soul becomes annihilated. It'll take some kind of fire, some kind of some kind of horrible thing to think that you slowly your soul will slowly die and become extinct, annihilated, never to be. How many knows Jesus came to give his life and to give it to us more abundantly? &gt;&gt; How many wants more abundant life? &gt;&gt; Lord, help me to live my life to the fullest. And the only way that you can do that is to be surrendered to Jesus Christ, have your sins under the blood, to be right with God, to put him first daily. Die to yourself daily. &gt;&gt; How many believes it's a daily dying? &gt;&gt; That's right. Because it's so easy to backslide and get away from God. You must die to yourself daily. You must love him with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength. Above your job, above everything else, you've got to love him more than anything. family, even children, wives, anything, land, no matter. &gt;&gt; All right. So, he went and preached they That's right. He went to pre to preach to those that could not be forgiven. If you'll listen to brother Bram's message, he believed that this message here would also do the same thing. And when he preached this message and brought all these things out and he made an altar call, he says, "You should see the altar now. People just flocked to the altar. The altars were full. Everybody crying out, "God, don't let it be too late." Because he said, "If that ministry preach to the total lost, this ministry will preach to the total lost if it's going to be parallel." And brother Brandham uses a scripture that I want to close with and it's in Hebrews, Hebrews 3. It says, "For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted of the good word of God and the powers that are to come, if they should fall away to renew themselves again to repentance, seeing they crucified themselves the son of God aresh and put him to an open shame." So it is impossible. All right. But Abraham says, "Remember in Hebrews 6th chapter was the ones he made known the truth and they refused to walk in it. There's no repentance, no more repentance for them." When the truth is presented to a person for the last time and they refuse to receive it according to Hebrews, there's not even nothing in the world that can ever save them. &gt;&gt; They're finished. No repentance, no redemption. There's nothing left for them. They're eternally separated. Amen. Looking for a fearful fire and indignation which shall devour the adversary. Amen. Listen to this. You talk about people walking away from the message. And when the truth of God's gospel has been proven, thoroughly a vindicated, and then turn around and walk away from it, they're finished. &gt;&gt; They're finished. That's all. It's awful, but I have to tell it. Remember, even the angels that kept not their first estate, but left their habitation, they are in prison. A house, prison house of darkness. It's where the world is walking today in that same prison. And there's no repentance. See, brother Bam, he was a messenger of God. And he's seen how people would walk out and walk out and walk out. When God determines that those people walked out for the last time, they can come to a service and hear the message preached. But it'll be a message being preached to the total lost. Let me tell you something. It's scary. I'm a pastor here. I've seen a lot of people. I've heard a lot of evangelists come through here and preach the gospel. Preach the gospel. And people have walked away from it. Walked away from it. I'm here to tell you as a pastor, it's a scary thing, Brother Brad. I'm not the judge. I'm glad I'm not because Paul persecuted the very church of God for a while. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Blasphemed, so to speak. But the thing that Paul said he did is he did it in his ignorance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If people get up and walk out, my praise God, forgive them. Just let it be in their ignorance. &gt;&gt; Let it be in their ignorance. You don't wish that to nobody. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is the judge. But that's what brother Brandham was saying is that we're living in a world. Look at it. I'll say this, our balcony should be full. &gt;&gt; This place should be crowded. The chairs ought to be out. But people have failed to hear the voice of God. &gt;&gt; They hardened their hearts. Nah, they're just a false prophet. No, he's not a false prophet. It's a real prophet of God. And you're going to seal your destination &gt;&gt; by the attitude that you have towards those whom God has sent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Evening light tabernacle. It's not time to backslide. &gt;&gt; Not time to get cold on God. Ask yourselves what's important. What's first in your life? Brother Bam says, "In the seal of God, but one of these days, the last Holy Ghost anointed sermon will be preached." &gt;&gt; How many believes that? One of these days, me and Brother Brad, we're going to preach our last sermon here. Amen. &gt;&gt; The last gun will fire. One of these days the last last song will be sung. One of these days the last prayer will be prayed. One of these days the doors of the tabernacle will be closed for the last time. The Bible will be closed on the pulpit and you'll stand in the presence of God and give an account for what you've heard tonight. Hello. In other words, what you do with it now &gt;&gt; determines where you'll be then. &gt;&gt; Now and then. &gt;&gt; Very important words. Today is the day of salvation. Now is time to accept the pardon that God has given to you. &gt;&gt; Don't wait. You got all those examples. Why wouldn't you say, "Yeah, look at that. I don't want to end up like that. &gt;&gt; I want to serve God with all my heart. Amen. And you'll stand in the presence of God and give an account for tonight. Brother Bam says, "What then? What then? When the great book is opened, what then? When tonight comes on record, what then?" Then Brother Bam says, "Those tapes will meet this generation on judgment day." Cuz those were not brother Bam's words. That was Christ's word. &gt;&gt; He said God would not come and vindicate something that ain't right. &gt;&gt; But he did. Listen, he came and proved what was right. When the great book is a what then? Tonight on the records, what then? Oh, as the song says, what then? When the great book is opened, what then? When the ones that rejected the Savior today will be asked to give a reason. What then? Oh my. I believe that you could you could actually somehow inject a little bit of the fear of God into people if you just if they just realize that you can't just go on thinking that you don't have to give an account for yourself. But they've deceived our young people into thinking they've come from monkeys or they evolved and they'll die like rats or anything else. And so it doesn't really matter. And it doesn't if you really believe that. No wonder they shoot everybody up. No wonder they have no morals. No, we're all just going to die anyway. Get mad at somebody or whatever. You know, it's sad. That's what our leaders have taught our children. And then they wonder how many knows it is terrible. What about this in what is it Minnesota now? and that the the corruption of all of this money that uh they've gotten and borrowed is, you know, and and and just the corruption is really coming out. Like brother Bam says, the core will go plum to core. It's just really bad. Finishing up. Listen, when that great when that great book is open, he says when you'll be asked to give a reason, what then? Your job stood in your way. Your parents stood in your way. Your boyfriend stood in your way. Your girlfriend sitt in your way. Your church stood in your way. What then? What then? Now I wrote down here, maybe you stood in your own way. How many know it's cause you to take out to take up your own cross, die to your own self daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. No, no, no is the answer. I didn't let anything stand any more my way. We gave our all. How many wants to say, I give my all. &gt;&gt; I give you everything. I give you my all, both great and small. We're going to scream. We're going to shout and say, "God, I'm so thankful that you by your grace help me to whip myself." Because many times we are our own worst enemy. &gt;&gt; Our self is our own worst enemy. I want to do this. I'm going to do that. I get caught up too much in other things. I'm here to confess evening light tabernacle and to you listening. Amen. That I love to work. I love to build. I love to hunt. I like to fish. Amen. I like to do things and I'm too busy. I've been too busy for years. so busy that I have to make time that when I'm drinking my coffee, I'll get my iPad and push play and listen to scriptures four or five chapters and so forth. I'd gotten away from it. Hello. Time to get down on your knees and pray, study, think about your soul. &gt;&gt; But I want to say this most of all, make sure church that God is first. Put God first in everything. He won't have it any other way. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't, you'll easily fall into one of those categories of, "Well, this got in my way or that got in my way." Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't have it. &gt;&gt; As the pastor, I don't want you to have it. I want you to be close to God and be ready to go. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; I want to be ready to go. Lord, change my heart. &gt;&gt; Show me where I still have impurities in there. Let God search your heart. See where you still have impurities in there. &gt;&gt; He'll tell you. &gt;&gt; When we come back to church Sunday, we'll have a different atmosphere, a better one yet. I'm not making y'all sinners and so forth, but I know that we all are human. We have our errors and we have our shortcomings. We have our things in man that we need to deal with and say, "God, help me and make me stronger in it." Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; I believe the Holy Spirit has that much discernment to know because we've got to get ready to get out of here, people. We got to be ready for the If you're going in the rapture, you got to be ready for that rapture. &gt;&gt; You got to got to be able to say, "Brother B, I'm ready for the rapture. I'm ready to go." Amen. Why do you think brother Brandham in most of his sermons, Lord, forgive me of my wrong, forgive us of our debts, and forgive us where we have sinned against you, constantly making things right, making sure you're right, in tune. &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians, if you'll come. Think about your soul more than you think about your body. Amen. And you'll have your perspective right. Jesus said, "What does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose your soul?" How many is the most treasured thing that you've got is your soul? It's your life. That's the real treasure. &gt;&gt; That's what Christ came to save. Save our souls. Give us eternal life. How many's glad to have eternal life? &gt;&gt; Eternal life. 10,000 years and we'll just be started. &gt;&gt; Isn't that nice? We'll just be started. That's right. &gt;&gt; 10 million. That's just a little bit too much for me to comprehend. Uh a 100,000 years. That's a little more, you know. Imagine 10 million years will just be started. Oh my. Praise be to God. God is good, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Thank you all for praying for me. Will all you continue to pray? Lord, help the pastor to come up here, not just preach. And I I was funny that brother Brad said, "Not just another Wednesday night because I was going to say that thing when I come out here. We're not here just to have another service on a Wednesday night." But no, we come here to search our souls. We are here to have the Holy Spirit speak to us and tell us what we should do, where our focus ought to be, where we need to repent. How many needs to repent? &gt;&gt; Stand with me tonight, Lord Jesus. You see all of our hands up, Father, in the day and age that we're living in, Lord, the speed that everything's going and we get caught up in that speed, God, and we need to slow it down, Lord, to make time for you and realize, God, sometimes we just get too busy, Father, and we don't stay prayed up. We don't stay in tune like we ought to, Lord. you become secondary, third, fourth. Lord, forgive us. We ask God tonight that you'd renew our fellowship with you. Lord, if there's anybody in here that sinned, God, and they actually brought their hands up into the air, said, "I do need to repent. There's things I need to repent of." They're honest, God. And even as your prophetist said, if you're not right with God, stop the tape right now. Get right right now, Father. This is our time. Now is our time to say, "Lord Jesus, wash us white. Clean us of any iniquity. Sometimes we sin, Lord. And sometimes we do things we know we ought to do. No, but every one of us iniquity, we ask God, forgive us of iniquity, Lord. Wash us pure. Help us to go from here a better people than what we were when we came in those doors, Lord. closer to you, more on fire for you, Lord. Bless every heart, every hand now, Lord. Lord, as they repent and say, "God, forgive me, Father, of where I've gotten away from you, Lord. Forgive me. It's so easy to get caught up with jobs, to get caught up with work, to get up with caught up with pleasure, to get caught up with whatever it might be that we get caught up in, Lord. And you don't stay on the forefront, Father. This is no time to let up, God. Cuz we want to meet you in the air. When you say, "Come up." You said, "Lazarus, come forth." And one of these days a trumpet sound, and you're going to call your bride up, Lord. We want to hear our name called. We want to be a part of that great reunion in the sky to meet you in the air, Lord. And we're going to be at a great great wedding supper. We're going to be on that table gathered around while the earth is on fire. We'll be fellowshipping one with another and you'll be wiping the tears from our eyes. Amen. And it'll be eternal joy, Lord Jesus. While you're purging this earth, while you're burning this earth, and all that do wickedly, all the evil will be burned. So take all evil out of us Lord as we come this Wednesday night to prepare to get a little more ready Lord to meet you in the air. Father in Jesus name we ask it. Amen and amen. Brother David. Amen. Until then. Praise the Lord. You love him with all your heart tonight. Amen. Brother Thomas asked that we'd sing this song tonight. Until then. Amen. I ask him to get the words and we'll pull it up. And how many enjoyed the word tonight? And &gt;&gt; my you know I I listened to that message yesterday investments and then I listened to the prophet today convinced and concerned and and then then brother Chris preached Sunday and I brother Brandon was talking about that old man that got excited in the attic because he had a geography book. I said Lord that's my desire. I don't have to have a Bible, but I can see in everything around me that it's you living in me. That's my heart's desire. Amen. My heart can sing. When I pause to remember, a heartache here is but a stepping stone. That's winding. It's winding all ways upward. This trouble is not my final home. But until the end, my heart will go on singing. But until then, with joy I'll carry on. Until the day my eyes behold that city until the day God calls me home. The things of earth will dim and lose their value if we recall. They're borrowed for a while and things of earth that cause the heart to tremble. Remember there will only bring a smile. But until then they my heart will go on singing for until they with joy I'll carry on until the day. Behold that city until the day God calls me home. This weary world with all its toll and struggle may take its soul of misery and strive. The soul of man is like a waiting eagle. When it's released, it's destined for the sky. But until this, my heart will go on singing. But until this with joy I'll carry on until the day my eyes behold that city. until the day God calls me home. Amen. Are you looking forward to that tonight? And Amen. We had a prayer request come in late tonight and Amen. And it says, "Please have prayer for Sister Leah. She's been having numbness since yesterday to due to her shoulder being out of place. Pray for healing of her shoulder. We want to remember Sister Aaliyah tonight. And Amen. Before we go, let's just all just pray for Sister Ai. Let's all just pray tonight. Play something soft, Sister Becky. Let's pray. Heaven Thank you. Hallelujah. Remember the service Sunday morning at 10:30 and just come praying and expecting God to move in a special way. And let's sing that little song as we go. Well, soon and very soon. Oh, we are going to see the king. God bless you. Oh, soon and very soon. Oh, we are going to see the king. Oh, soon and very soon. Oh, we are going to see the king. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're going to see the king. Oh, and Paris soon.
