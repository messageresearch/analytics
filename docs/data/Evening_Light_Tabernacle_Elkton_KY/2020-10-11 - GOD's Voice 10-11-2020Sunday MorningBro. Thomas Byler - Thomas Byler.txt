========================================

all right come unto me all ye who are reary and heavy laden and i will give you rest now in saint john the fifth chapter in verse 24 the scripture says this verily verily truly truly or absolutely absolutely is this something how you would think well jesus wouldn't have to say that all you have to say do it but he says absolutely absolutely he wants to really make sure that people get it that people understand truly truly absolutely absolutely i say to you that he that heareth my word huh he that hears my voice my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life praise the lord how many is thankful for that john 4 john 5. so just to hear just to hear with your heart the voice of god can change you from death to life amen isn't that a tremendous statement just to be able to hear god's voice just to hear his word in your heart and he said verily verily amen he says have everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life you know what you're looking at this morning you're looking at a person that at the age of 20 years old into drugs van halen ac dc there is something down in here amen that said you know there's just more to life than partying sinning because you see folks young people listen don't you don't ever have to try that stuff it'll only do one thing sure it'll make a good feeling in your body it'll be a real good feeling but the next morning you will wake up and feel like a corpse just empty it's horrible i'm here to tell you it's a horrible feeling to be empty inside to have no spirit because i'm here to tell you folks listen no matter how long you've been a christian i mean it is this holy spirit that gives you strength it is god's spirit that gives you power gives you strength gives you energy that is truly the good feeling is the holy ghost all that others just empty you out amen and oh my you know that's why you see hollywood people that are super rich and they gotta have another tattoo they're just not happy they gotta have another ring they gotta have tattoo their eyelids and they gotta they're totally empty inside they're trying to get a satisfaction somehow and they're never satisfied that's why jesus says you know come unto me i'll give you a drink where you'll never thirst again hallelujah i'm so thankful the bible says blessed are they that have an ear to hear you realize how blessed you are this morning to have an ear to hear because the bible said that to him that hath to him shall be given but to him that hath not to him shall be taken even what he has so if there's something down in your soul you have something that searches for more blessed audited hunger and thirst for they shall be filled the most blessed thing that anybody young person anybody can have is the heart to desire more of god to desire to be filled with his spirit to desire to be a son of god you have something how many knows there's something that you have jesus talked about that something because the woman at the well that was ill-famed amen when jesus come and he began to talk to her ask for a drink and so forth isn't that right amen whenever he begin to say you know she said you know when the messiah comes we know when he comes he'll tell us these things is that right when the messiah comes he'll tell us these things you know but the pharisees see they say he deserved the thoughts and intents of the heart also the pharisees knew it isn't that right but they called him a mind reader a piazzi pub a fortune teller a chief of devils why because they had not they didn't have something in here amen and then that woman of the world man she went into the city said isn't this the very messiah she had something she had representation she was a daughter of god god i want to tell you this morning if you believe in your heart at all that you're a son and daughter of god you believe that with all your heart you've got to be the happiest person in the world just to believe that let alone leave it with all your heart and to know that god has done the work in your life he's made a change in you amen because you have passed from death unto life to know that you're son of god what an honor what a privilege it is amen i'm gonna jump around a little bit okay listen to this i'm just gonna read what i just preached for whosoever hath to him shall be given and to him that hath and he shall have more abundance but whosoever have not from him shall be taken even that which he had i mean those people will lose the very life that they do have but if you've got something down on the inside there amen you're going to have more of an i came to give you life that more abundantly jesus said therefore speak eye to them in parable because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not they heard the voice of god then they heard the voice of god whenever jesus would speak but yet they didn't hear it you i could go through it i won't go through it but you can go through where jesus was talking to them and they were saying don't we say well that thou art was born in fornication and has a devil and he would go on and try to convince him you know no i do the works that my father does and you believe me not is that right and he tried to convince him but they just couldn't hear that right they just didn't have something in there to hear with and shall not understand listen what he says it's because they're seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand you try to witness to some people and it doesn't matter how much you try to convince them and how much scripture you'll show them they just can't see it huh and you know i want to say most of the time it's because of their church's teaching all right their church is teaching in the way that they have been taught it's contrary to what they have been taught so they don't think it can be right that's exactly how the pharisees were it was contrary to what they thought therefore it couldn't be true amen god don't ask anybody how to do it where to do it who to do it through is that right but it's up to every soul to find out what god speaks who god speaks through and what god speaks amen and come and hear that and if you're a child of god this is the thing let me i've got a couple more good scriptures listen so he says here by hearing yeshua for in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which saith by hearing they shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see but shall not get it perceive it amen for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed at least at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart i mean believe that's truly where the understanding comes to it's in the heart that's where you got to understand from uh can i just speak what comes to mind it's like listening to a preacher brother right it's like listening to a preacher everybody as you hear the preacher something in your heart is either telling you whether that's really the truth or not right something's telling you you have to be able to learn you have to be able to understand that all right now look let's go on understand what they're and should be converted and i should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them praise be to god have not heard them all right give me a second here matthew 13. i have a lot of scriptures and i want to try to keep them all as much as straight as i can praise the lord let's go to revelations now actually before revelation so i'm going to i want to i wanna show you something else over in saint john a couple more scriptures let's actually go to 6 john 8 first go to saint john 8. and we'll begin with verse 39 they answered and said unto him abraham is our father and jesus said unto them if you were abraham's children ye would do the works of abraham but now ye seek to kill me a man that has told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham i want to stop there for just a second remember this one thing that if they cannot uh get get you to quit condemning people for not accepting god or so forth they'll actually try to kill your voice amen people will actually kill you rather than try to hear you tell them the truth people hate the truth people don't want the truth amen that's the way the pharisee they did not want to hear the truth remember stephen when he was preaching they closed their ears and ran upon him and gnashed him and took him out and killed him for telling them the truth the truth comes with a price let me tell you something not many churches not many preachers dare tell the truth anymore it's getting to where even here even me sometimes you almost think about what you want to say or don't want to say sometimes you talk about homosexuality you talk about black lives matter you talk about this side or the other and guess what look out you never know what's going to happen huh but a servant of god doesn't fear the truth gets told i don't care who it is because you're not going to get it up in the white house you're not going to get in congress amen i want to talk to you about the voice of politics here in a minute yet but listen so he says here uh let's go on you do the deeds of your father verse 41 they said unto him we be not born of fornication oh my how many knows your minds were completely somewhere else here god was speaking to them reaching out to them trying to get them to see but they just would not see we be not born of fornication we have one father even god huh that's let me tell you something that's what so many so-called people that claim to be christians well i believe god but i don't believe he'll send a prophet even though he was vindicated world around jesus came and did the very same things he did when he walked on the earth only many many more times more and people just throw that out man can't be no listen he says we have one father even god and jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me praise the lord for i proceeded forth and came from god neither i came up myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech why he was trying to convince him why don't you even because you cannot hear my word oh my isn't that where this sometimes when you get an argument with somebody you almost have to yell and it don't do no good either does it they still don't hear it doesn't no matter how loud no matter how much you say like can't you understand what i'm saying they still don't have them they just couldn't get it even because you cannot hear my word why do you think jesus says you're blessed if you can believe the truth you of your father the devil and the lusts of your father will you do very voice of god lord jesus help them god telling them that they are of their father the devil he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not into truth because there is no truth in him even when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his phone for he's a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth you believe me not let me tell you something anybody that won't believe the truth will gladly believe a lie anybody don't believe the truth they don't mind accepting a lie which of you convinces me of sin if i say the truth and you do not believe me why do you not believe me here's the point that i want to get to he that is of god heareth god's words there ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god how many believes that we're supposed to be the mouthpiece of god here at evening like tabernacle i don't care where you are any church any person any christian that claims to be a christian has should have the voice of god in their hearts fathers to your wife wife to your children you should be god's voice to those children amen over in first john 4 and we'll begin with verse four ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore they speak they of the world amen and the world heareth them in other words birds of a feather flock together isn't that right we are of god john was so confident that when he wrote these sentences we are a god and he that knoweth god hears us wow how many believes that this morning that if anybody out there is of god they'll hear you just as sure as jesus said my sheep hear and know my voice and a stranger's voice they will not follow now how many knows that the bleed of a sheep and the bleed of a goat is very very similar and it's very hard to tell i probably couldn't even tell the difference if i heard a goat bleeding i'd say there's a sheep very very similar so sometimes somebody knows that sometimes the voice of truth and the voice of error is really really close [Music] amen let me just tell you what comes to mind is that okay it reminds me that take a group of people like this take a church amen in the devil he is the absolute master at bringing to me i thank god there's no division no reason why i'm preaching this other than the holy spirit but listen he knows how to try to get people at odds try to cause a division try to cause problems in church somebody will say you know i'll tell you what there's something going on in the church somebody's doing and they ought to quit and we ought to straighten this out we ought to straighten that you know and this ought to be that way i want a better church i want to be right i want to do this in the name of righteousness we'll cause a stir in that right and brother baby says man he can tell you about so and so what they did and how evil they are he says it may sound so right but brother brown said remember it's the devil remember it sounds so right and so good but it's the devil he says nine times out of ten if you trace it down the person that's making the stir is the one that's not right amen so the devil's clever he is rude and let me tell you something it's a miracle for a church to be held together and to stay together amen because you take a lukewarm believer you take a make-believer and that is a prime subject a make-believer or whatever to for the devil to work in because those are the people that want to be holier you know they want to be more righteous and so we got to do this we got no you let god operate you let god deal with somebody comes and pass you let the pastor preach on it when god you know deals with it hello let the holy spirit like my wife man you know brother al not sitting here this morning but when his wife you know kept wearing pants after she proclaimed christianity and she said you just keep wearing until god tell you to huh it wasn't too awful long they were gone why the holy spirit convicted that's what we want we want god to operate on people amen and do the work amen because if you don't do it you can conform we can all be amish you better do it or else you're going to conform we don't do it that way we let the holy spirit deal amen it's a tremendous thing how many believes the holy spirit is to lead the church the holy spirit is to lead each and every one of us and we are all to have that voice of god let me say it before i don't but i'm going to tell you the most important voice that you'll ever listen to the most important voice that you'll ever follow and listen to is that still small voice in your heart that tells you what to do or what not to do and we anybody of us if that have had experience with it no when that voice tells you to do something and you don't do it you live to regret it and if he tells you not to do it you do it you live to regret it because that voice will always point you the wrong the right way it'll never point you the wrong way amen we lead ourselves wrong but the holy spirit never leads you wrong and i don't know about you but i believe every one of our hands could go up this morning and say lord i need to be able to heed to and hear that still small voice a lot better than what i do are you with me lord i need to hear that still small voice and it's a simple thought that comes into your heart telling you something showing you something but we have such an easy way of shrugging that off amen ignoring that and we absolutely lose our close walk with god when you shrug that little bitty voice that comes in your heart because us all it was when he came to evie was just one word misconstrued one more misinterpreted a little bit amen and sometimes we'll say well that's just me no i don't really think that that you know yeah that's god talking to you got scott trying to speak to you trying to tell you what to do amen let alone all any scriptures that we ever read any other part of the bible it's all god's voice but in your life and where you are and what you're doing you need that still small voice saying god lead me amen i look back and i can tell you right now that's the voice that i followed ever since i gave my life to god say god here i am i don't know what my job occupation gonna be i don't know what woman i'm gonna marry i don't know about my future i have no future lord here i am i'm yours do with me whatever you want i'm yours lord now i'm glad that that voice amen because listen to me amen so many times we think we look back and say well i decided to serve god but i looked back and i realized that it was not me calling god it was god drawing me god drawing you no man comes to the father but by me and no man can come unto me except my father draw him that's why i believe that if you've got that drawing how many y'all tell you what good to see the church this morning because there's a thirst in your heart amen to come to the house of god amen if you go to the races you're going to see a car win if you go to a ball game you look for somebody to win and you go to this side or the other but when you come to the house of god you want god to speak to your heart and you have to say lord here i am and you never know what the preacher might say how a detour from a thought that he might go or whatever but god can speak to your heart and i believe that when you're sitting there you should be awake and realizing god here i am what do you want to say to me amen just like wednesday i believe god spoke to our hearts telling us don't wait for a desperate situation to come to put you in desperation into into fervency with god amen be that way all the time say god here i am every day lord i need you more than ever lord i can't make it to this day without you huh rather than like i was just kind of getting relaxed and well everything's going good you know and you just kind of float along and no don't be like that amen stay fervent with god amen praise the lord lord bless you this morning amen all right can we go a little further all right so listen where are we at over in st john so he says that's that's right he that he that knoweth god heareth us and he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of air so basically the bible is telling if you are a son and daughter of god the one thing you're going to do is believe his word you're going to believe the bible you're going to believe everything that god tells you if you're a son and daughter of god if you're not you'll twist it up a little bit and that's where confusion comes in that's where that's folks let me tell you something that's why we have 900 different churches different denominations everybody believing it kind of the way that they want to believe it interpreting it the way that they want to interpret it that's why god had to send malachi forward to us to prove it to us listen to this let's go this is part three here ready we got about five six parts so this is part three but it's even over in uh galatians i believe it is i don't know if i've even got this marked down i don't think i do so we'll find it yeah yeah not too hard to figure out here galatians the first chapter so we see how many knows that jesus said if you can't hear my words you will die in your sins unless you believe that i am he is that right if you may fail to follow jesus he was going to miss eternal life and then let me just say this from the voice of god going in the body of jesus it was transferred over into the church body on the day of pentecost isn't that right but god never was going to be without a voice in the world god is not without a voice in the world today it may be kind of silent huh you almost have to wonder where's the voice of god at and let me just say this it comes to mind and i believe it's the truth i don't care if you're a message preacher doesn't mean you're necessarily the voice of god if you've compromised in some way or you're doing it in a denominational manner god ain't with you it ain't god speaking amen it has to be and listen to this also how many knows that just the halfway out of the will of god preacher god's not gonna use either or a christian that's halfway and out of the will of god god's not going to use that he's going to use somebody that's in the will of god serving god with all of their heart back to paul so paul if you know how many knows that paul was the voice of god even over peter peter had been given the keys and everything but paul was the messenger to the first church age he was the first church age messenger and he had the kind of authority okay he had the kind of authority that he could say in galatians 1 in verse 6 i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel now paul had problems with people perverting the word of god they were trying to teach circumcision again and this out of the other bringing in teachers having itching hears departing from the faith and all things were happening now i understand that even some of the churches that paul started threw him out and wouldn't have him back anymore can you imagine that they got so far away from the gospel that they wouldn't even let him mean some of the churches he started that's what i understand now notice called you to another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ now he goes to saying something but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you whoa what authority let him be accursed if he's an angel not just a preacher decided but if he's an angel from heaven and come and tell you something other than what he has brought that's how accurate the bible is and as we said before so say i again verily verily basically truly truly let me say it again paul says if any man preach any gospel unto you then that ye have received let him be accursed whoo think about that paul heaven so much the voice of god that if anybody comes and preach anything else that's why we believe absolutely that this is the infallible word of god if a prophet there is no prophet that is above the word of god there is no preacher above the word of god there is nothing above the word of god i am told that martin luther one time had an angel to appear to him and it was actually jesus jesus appeared to martin saint martin and he said to him he says i am jesus and he had a crown on his head just a glowing glistening huh just i am jesus he said i'm jesus how before me and martin begin to wonder and look and think he realizes that he don't get crowned until all the same he's crowned him to get better the word said something something's not quite right here you're not supposed to be crowned yet that according to the word of god the saints will crown christ and what did he say he said get be behind me satan huh you know he realized he was the devil and then it disappeared but the devil was trying to get him to bow before him and coming to him and get him the bow paul says if an angel comes to you and tells you something different than this here let him be accursed that's how accurate the voice of god is amen that's why brother branham said you know nowadays brother branham would preach against make up he preached against women the but the bible says a woman that wears a garment pertains to man is an abomination in the sight of god and god ain't changed his mind none paul said the woman is not to cut her hair and so forth it's her glory and it's a shame for her to cut it all these other things and some people say well it doesn't matter huh jesus said unless a man is born again he cannot enter the kingdom of giving yet people are sin just join church just shake the preacher's hand and you'll be all right no hello you can't water it down you can't do what the devil did it's just water it now it's got to be the pure unadulterated word of god just what paul said amen women preachers how many pentecost was the latest move of god and pentecost they used to have everything right and now the women pentecostals when women are up there and wearing pants and makeup and everything else and preaching the gospel women when paul says that it is a shame for her to speak in church let her keep silent if she has a question asked our husband at home it's not permitted for him to speak amen getting quiet now but isn't that the truth what would he say if god speaks in this world he would tear us up amen i truly believe he'd tell us the truth just like the prophet of god did he told the truth brother branham one place and mom either look at one of those message he got so anointed until that voice spoke to me and says this is god speaking i am just using uh brother branham's voice this is not him this is me speaking god spoke so much until he spoke that way he wouldn't have to already spoke when he tell you your name is so and so you're from so and so and you have cancer in the name of jesus christ you'll be thousands and hundreds of thousands of times all these things happen that's good enough for me the sign of the messiah big part about it is he's always pointed us right back to what paul said and when brother went beyond the curtain of time he seen millions of people there under the altar all happy and perfect perfection you couldn't even imagine what it was like and the angel told him he says these are your people you're gathered with your your people 20 twenty went to a vision twenty foot high out of the bed and so forth he's seen all that amen and then they says you know you're gonna be gathered with your people but before you do he says you're gonna have to be judged for what you preached you're gonna have to be judged for what you have preached and he said well will paul have to be judged or what he preached he says that's right paul will have to be praying to be judged but the man went praise be to god then everything will be all right because i just preached what paul preached i just said what paul said it's going to be all right amen no an angel comes with any other voice other than this if a voice comes to you contrary to this remember you got to be careful amen sheep be careful listen to only the voice of god praise the lord that's right now let's go to revelations a couple more places and then we'll close i still want to cover the voice of politics for just a minute and i believe we have the voice of the lord on that revelations one a little bit extensive reading and amen this is a nice cool beautiful day so let's just take our time and enjoy basking in the presence of god is that all right thank the lord thank you jesus for keeping everybody safe for helping us to not have to deal much at least with that coronavirus and so forth amen thank god for his goodness to us how many thankful to god we come here to thank the lord not just and was asking things but he god surely good to us isn't he amen verse 11 i am alpha and the omega i'm the first and the last and what thou seest write in the book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and to smyrna pergamus by tyra sardis philadelphia and laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and in the midst of the seven candlestick one like unto the son of man clothed with the garment bound to the foot and his dirt about the pabst with the golden girdle his head and his hair were like white like wool i don't guess we got that cloud picture here do we white like wool remember the hoffman said if christ formed out in arizona his hair was white like wool formed in the shape of hoffman's head of christ quite as wool and his eyes were as a flame of fire his feet likened to fine brass as if they burned in a fermented furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters i didn't pull that uh song up by the aunts brothers the voice of many waters y'all remember that song the ghost gospel preachers you know and brother bam said the sound of this many waters is the voice of his ministers that sounded through the last 2000 years thundering out judgment is that right it's thundering out the gospel of christ that there's mercy come to the fountain come to the fount come to the fountain and if you reject it there's nothing but condemnation isn't that right all of these voices going forth because that's truly the voice of god is amen go ye to all the world and preach the gospel he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned amen that's the voice of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his continence was like the sunshineness in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead amen how do you know that makes one god amen first the last was dead build i am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death write the things which i have seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which i saw us in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks are which thou sawest are the seven churches amen in the last church age if you go with me to chapter 3 now we know through a prophet of god in the voice of days of the voice of the seventh angel the bible says even when he shall begin the sound the mystery of christ should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets we know the last two thousand years from the time of christ we've had seven churches seven church ages seven messengers seven stars that god has had a voice and that's who god spoke through amen and each one of those messengers would have a certain word for that age no doubt that the first church aged paul and the different ones they would encourage the people to go right to death go into the lands and give you life sacrifice we must be willing to lay down our life for him that was probably more said than anything else we can think of in the catacombs and under the martyrology that was the voice say man be thou faithful unto death is what the voice was that was maybe that time and then loser came along i mean it's time to referee for reformation to just shall live by faith wesley came along sanctification and so forth you got to be clean and right pentecost come along and the gifts of the spirit all the way to the seventh church age when all of the mysteries were made known the voice of god through the seventh church h messenger has made all these mysteries known amen and then he says look at this age that we're standing now once again he stands he says and this is this is the only church age that he stood outside the door knocking behold i stand at the door and knock and we have absolutely seen all the churches put christ on the outside brother brahms who through the ministry of brother branham jesus christ would come he would discern the thoughts and intents of the heart do exactly what he did when he was walking on the earth amen in the church that said nah now he teaches against denominationalism he don't believe that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of the holy ghost for different reasons they put him out amen they wouldn't hear him what did the bible say about who god sends you don't hear him you actually reject god himself but there he is standing at the door notice he says and if any man hear my voice if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me brothers and sisters i am a witness amen because i let him in i heard his voice and we are now and if you can see if you can sympathize with me this morning you let him in and right now you are supposing with him he is supping with you you're having supper together you're feeding together you're eating together you're having fellowship together amen how many loves that fellowship amen i'm going to read you the last quote first if i can i say this then in closing and i'm going to read you the first part last the last part first excuse you excuse it i say this then in closing this one remark i want to make make the real church has no has so much to live for it should be such a jubilant time for the real church for the true church for the elected church when you know in your heart that you've passed from death to life when you look at yourself and watch your life and see that all the things of the world's passed away how many please god's working on us in that area amen causing the things of the world just not to mean much to you it's all gone that's why it's all gonna burn anyway real soon it's all gonna be gone amen we are absolutely right on the precipice folks right on the precipice of a major change amen it's already changed drastically but it's going to drastically change even more now i'll show you why in a minute for the elected church

my what can we do then what is next we're at the end of all things and that's the next paragraph was i say in closing the church has got so much to live for amen one more scripture if you'll turn with me to genesis and then we'll close what does god think about the condition the world's in he thinks that the world has gotten into the same condition that it has gotten before and he's got the same word for it in genesis 6. we have reached this place again genesis 6 verse 5 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he made man upon the earth and he grieved him at his heart amen how many knows that when god looks at all of this it's like look where man has got himself to he has completely gone wrong verse 7 and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and creepy things and fowls of the air and it repented me that i have made them i sure think that this ought to be read in our house and in our congress amen it's been next verse verse 12 and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth amen how many believes that's god's word for this generation they have gone as corrupt as they can get as far away from the word of god as they can go until they don't even know what a man is and what a woman is huh completely endorsed homosexuality same-sex marriages as corrupt as it can get god says it's time to destroy the whole thing god's about to do the same thing again because man has gotten that he has completely corrupted himself and think about this having been said way back in 1960 amen the end of it all is at hand but for the church we're not looking for a better life here we're looking for another life altogether amen god bless you this morning stand with me with our heads bowed look at your heart look at your fruit inspect yourself this morning there's no hope for this world our hope is not built on this anyway our hope is in the coming of the lord we do look for him to come in the clouds of heaven to take us home we're looking for him to bring about a rapture a change of these bodies to walk right from this dimension into the next dimension we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep but we'll be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen and we'll go to be with the lord are you seeing your life changed are you seeing the desires of the world pass away are you getting closer to god is that real burning in your heart for closer walk with god this morning if it is raise your hand say god i want a closer walk with you i'm not maybe right where i want to be but i'm here this morning saying god help me lord to get my eyes off of the things of the world and on to you lord for my desires my complete desire as dear prophet has said i hope make up my whole desire is christ and
