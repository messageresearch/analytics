[44:30] My
[44:31] soul cast
[44:34] down but
[44:37] mercy
[44:39] rerode my life. Let's just stand as we
[44:42] sing it again. Oh, it was
[44:47] mercy
[44:48] ruled my
[44:51] [Music]
[44:54] life.
[44:57] Mercy
[44:58] ruled my heart.
[45:04] Oh, I should have
[45:08] fallen my
[45:11] soul
[45:13] down, but
[45:16] mercy
[45:18] rerote
[45:21] my aren't you thankful God's in the
[45:23] rewriting business? Certainly been good
[45:25] to be in the house of the Lord today.
[45:27] Looking forward to tonight and what the
[45:29] Lord has in store for us. But we just we
[45:32] want to say that the heavens are
[45:33] rejoicing.
[45:35] You know what that means? The heavens
[45:37] are rejoicing. We've got a baptismal
[45:39] tonight. And so we're very thankful for
[45:41] that. That the Lord moved in a in a
[45:43] special way this morning. And Brother
[45:45] Weston wants to be rebaptized tonight.
[45:48] And and uh we're just thankful for that.
[45:52] thankful that the Lord still goes out
[45:54] and he he he
[45:56] he pricks
[45:58] hearts, you know, and so, you know,
[46:01] Weston was baptized at about 10 years
[46:03] old and and uh and then life happened
[46:07] and life goes on and but today as the
[46:10] word went forth, there was a prick in
[46:12] his heart and it's like brother Joe
[46:14] said, he's you want to know that he
[46:16] knows that he knows that he knows and
[46:19] from as we said Wednesday night, drive a
[46:21] take down and from this day forward,
[46:24] this day forward, we're going to keep
[46:26] marching on. So, God is certainly on the
[46:28] move and he's calling out to his bride.
[46:30] He's making a move. Brother Joe may
[46:32] share more with you, but uh he got a
[46:34] message today from Brother Andrew. Is
[46:36] this okay? Is this okay? From Brother
[46:39] Andrew. 19 people were baptized this
[46:42] morning at their church. The hour's
[46:44] getting late. God is calling his
[46:48] people. God is on the move.
[46:53] as brother Joe comes just to give him a
[46:55] liberty and the time that he needs and
[46:57] we're going to have the baptism. So the
[46:58] brothers after uh after brother Joe's
[47:01] finished if you'll remove the pull pit
[47:03] we'd appreciate it but we'll sing Mercy
[47:05] Rewrote my life as brother Joe comes
[47:07] tonight. Oh
[47:10] mercy
[47:11] rerro my
[47:15] [Music]
[47:17] heart
[47:19] [Music]
[47:27] mercy I should have fall in my
[47:33] soul has
[47:35] been God
[47:39] mercy
[47:40] rule my
[47:43] life. Aren't you thankful for his
[47:46] mercy? Amen. Let's just go to him in
[47:48] prayer. Father, what a great honor and a
[47:50] great privilege we have, Lord, today to
[47:53] to be called the sons of God. Lord, we
[47:56] look out in the world. We see a dying
[47:57] world, a dying generation. Lord, many
[48:00] that are so captivated by Lord who's who
[48:04] and wrongs and indifferences and a woke
[48:06] generation and entitlement society. But
[48:09] Lord, we as your people, we come with
[48:10] our cups lifted up. And we invite you to
[48:13] fill us a fresh and a new God. We thank
[48:16] you for the moving of the spirit, for
[48:17] the pricking of hearts today, Lord, not
[48:19] just here, but around the world, Lord,
[48:22] as your message goes forth. And we just
[48:24] trust, Father, that you'll come by our
[48:26] way once again this evening. speak to
[48:28] us. Break the bread of life, Lord. We'll
[48:31] be sure to grab our peace, Lord,
[48:33] tonight. May you feed us richly with
[48:35] your word. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[48:38] If you have your Bibles tonight, we're
[48:39] going to look
[48:40] here and
[48:42] uh look here in Romans 8 and verse 9.
[48:46] Romans 8 and verse 9. And again, we're
[48:48] going to speak to you on power restored
[48:49] to the church. And as a subtitle
[48:52] tonight, we'll call it, you hath he
[48:56] quickened. you had he quickened. So, I'm
[49:00] not sure how long I'm going to hold you
[49:01] this
[49:02] evening. I don't know about you, but I'm
[49:06] tired. Come on, church. I know y'all
[49:10] tired. You better get an amen out of you
[49:11] right now. Amen. Yeah, that food done
[49:13] got to another level, hadn't it?
[49:16] Amen. Amen. So, let's just look here.
[49:19] Says, "But you are not in the flesh, but
[49:22] in the spirit."
[49:24] I want you to write that down somewhere
[49:26] and you go home and put that on your
[49:28] refrigerator or in your bathroom mirror.
[49:30] But ye are not in the
[49:33] flesh, but in the spirit. Sometimes we
[49:36] need to be reminded of that who we
[49:39] really are. Not flesh, not our failures,
[49:41] not our mistakes, but we're in the
[49:44] spirit. If so be that the spirit of God
[49:46] dwell in you. Now, if any man hath not,
[49:49] listen to this next part. If any man
[49:51] have not the spirit of Christ, he is
[49:54] none of his. So it's
[49:57] paramount. It's important that you know
[50:00] that you know that you know that you
[50:02] know that the spirit of Christ is
[50:05] dwelling on the inside of you because
[50:06] that's a declaration that you belong to
[50:09] him.
[50:11] And if Christ be in you, the body is
[50:13] dead because of sin, but the spirit is
[50:15] life because of righteousness. But if
[50:17] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[50:19] from the dead dwell in you, he that
[50:20] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[50:23] also quicken your mortal bodies by the
[50:25] spirit that dwelleth in you. Let's look
[50:26] over here in Ephesians 2. We'll grab our
[50:29] subtitle tonight from
[50:33] this Ephesians 2 and verse one. And you
[50:36] hath he quickened who were dead in
[50:38] trespasses and sins where in times past
[50:41] you walked according to the course of
[50:43] this world. Brother Glenn, according to
[50:45] the prince of the power of the air, the
[50:47] spirit that now workketh in the children
[50:49] of disobedience, among whom we all have
[50:51] our conversations in time past, and the
[50:53] lust of the flesh. Brother John, this is
[50:55] some of us fulfilling the desires of the
[50:57] flesh and of the mind, and were by
[50:59] nature children of wrath, even as
[51:02] others. But God rich in mercy, for his
[51:05] great love wherewith he loved us. Come
[51:07] on now, everybody can put their name
[51:08] right there. But God who is rich in
[51:11] mercy for his great love wherewith he
[51:13] loved Joe Adams. He loved Brad Powell.
[51:16] He loved Jessica Adams. Come on, put
[51:18] your name there. Even when we were dead
[51:21] in sin, hath quickened us together with
[51:23] Christ. By grace you are saved. And he
[51:26] raised us up together, made us sit
[51:28] together in heavenly places or in
[51:30] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That in
[51:33] the ages to come he might show the
[51:35] exceeding riches of his grace and his
[51:37] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
[51:40] For by his grace are you saved through
[51:42] faith and not of yourselves. It is a
[51:44] gift of God, not of works, lest any man
[51:46] should boast. For we are his
[51:48] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[51:51] unto good works, which God has before
[51:53] ordained that we should walk in them.
[51:56] God bless you. You can have your seats
[51:57] this
[51:58] evening. As brother Brad said, I
[52:01] mentioned to brother Andrew uh of the
[52:04] service this morning that we're going to
[52:05] have a baptism. And he had text me back.
[52:07] He said, "Brother Joe, we baptized 19
[52:10] today." He said, "The move is on." Now,
[52:14] maybe I've told you last time or a time
[52:16] before, but uh a year ago, I was there
[52:18] at Brother Joe Green's church and
[52:20] preaching on a Sunday. And you know, we
[52:22] had a powerful service come and uh at
[52:25] the end of the service, we had a young
[52:27] girl who'd been to our youth camp. She
[52:28] wanted to give her heart to the Lord and
[52:30] be baptized and take on his name. And
[52:32] you know, with the promise of being
[52:34] filled with the Holy Spirit and she came
[52:36] up for prayer and you know, that evening
[52:38] service, uh the brothers there were
[52:40] preparing her to be baptized. when in
[52:42] between that service, Brother Nate
[52:44] Green's wife, uh, she wanted to be
[52:46] baptized. Sister Caitlyn, now she'd been
[52:47] baptized before, but you know, she just
[52:49] wanted to know that she know that she
[52:51] knew that she knew that she had what
[52:53] it's going to take. Didn't want anything
[52:54] become between her. So, she gets
[52:56] baptized and all of a sudden it started
[52:58] a chain reaction of baptism. We end up
[53:01] baptizing 28 people that night and then
[53:04] four more on Wednesday night following
[53:06] that Sunday service because they were
[53:08] streaming in. They wanted to make sure
[53:10] that their lives were where they needed
[53:11] to be. And I encourage you, we're going
[53:13] to have a baptism this evening after the
[53:15] service. But if you're here, you well, I
[53:17] don't have any clothes. Well, you sit in
[53:18] that parking lot long enough, you'll dry
[53:20] out. But I'm here to tell you, if you
[53:22] know that in some something inside of
[53:24] you right now, don't have that
[53:25] assurance. I don't care if you're 3
[53:27] years old, four years old, 5 years old,
[53:30] 80 years old. If you're crippled, if
[53:32] you're blind, if you're deaf, if you're
[53:33] dumb, if you don't have that assurance
[53:35] in your heart this evening, you come to
[53:37] that baptism pool and get rebaptized and
[53:40] take on the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:41] Christ, have a full genuine repentance.
[53:43] The promise is unto you and to your
[53:45] children, to them that are far off, even
[53:48] as many as the Lord our God shall call.
[53:51] That is a promise, Mom. That is a
[53:53] promise, Dad. That is a promised young
[53:55] person. It's a promise to us here this
[53:57] evening. That's not something we lay on
[53:59] the book on the shelf for 1960 and great
[54:02] churches and great men. That's for even
[54:04] us here tonight. That God is still a
[54:06] fulfiller of his word. He's here to
[54:08] quicken hearts. He's here to quicken
[54:10] lives. All that we have to do is just
[54:12] respond to it and know that we know that
[54:15] we know that we know that we know.
[54:18] Don't walk out of this building today
[54:20] and not knowing that you've received the
[54:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[54:25] Let's Oh, let me just stop there. Let me
[54:28] just let me preach. Second, let's go to
[54:30] Colossians 2 and verse 13. And you being
[54:33] dead in your
[54:34] sins and the uncircumcision of your
[54:38] flesh hath he quickened together with
[54:42] him. Notice I'm taking my time. You
[54:46] going to put that up there? Colossians
[54:49] 2:13. We're going to teach, preach this
[54:51] evening.
[54:53] Come on, church. Say amen. I I'm just as
[54:56] full as you
[54:57] are. Y'all sitting there smiling. At
[55:00] least
[55:01] amen. Notice now. And you being dead in
[55:05] your sins and the uncircumcision of your
[55:07] flesh, hath he quickened together with
[55:10] him, having forgiven you all trespasses.
[55:14] I say, "What about grace and mercy right
[55:17] there?" Blotting out the handwriting of
[55:20] ordinances that was against you which
[55:22] was contrary to us. And he took it out
[55:25] of the way and he nailed it to the
[55:27] cross. Every thought that you would ever
[55:29] have, every action, every evil deed,
[55:32] every mistake, every failure that you
[55:34] would ever commit, he nailed it to the
[55:36] cross. He blotted out the handwriting
[55:38] and ordinance that were against you.
[55:40] when Satan accused you of being a secret
[55:42] sinner, when he accused you of being,
[55:44] you know, belonging to him and being
[55:45] unrighteous and an unholy, but almighty
[55:48] God stepped in on your behalf and he
[55:51] came in and he erased the devil's
[55:52] question and he erased the accusations
[55:55] against you and he nailed it to the
[55:57] cross and now he's made you sons and
[55:59] daughters of God and you had he
[56:02] quickened that were dead in sins and
[56:04] trespasses. You're no longer dead to to
[56:07] to the spirit of God, but now you're
[56:09] dead to the things of the world. You're
[56:11] dead to the spirit or you're dead to the
[56:13] to the the the desires of the flesh. And
[56:16] God is calling out a people and he's
[56:18] separating a people and he's anointing a
[56:20] people and he's quickening the people
[56:22] for what? He's quickened a bride for a
[56:24] body change.
[56:28] And he's taken your sins and he's nailed
[56:30] them to the cross. And he spoiled
[56:32] principalities and powers. and he made a
[56:35] show of them openly, triumphing,
[56:38] triumphing over them. Notice now 1 Peter
[56:42] 4 and verse one as we build our subject
[56:44] tonight. For so much then as Christ has
[56:46] suffered for us in the flesh, arm
[56:48] yourselves likewise with the same mind.
[56:50] For he that suffered in the flesh has
[56:53] ceased from sin that he no longer should
[56:56] live the rest of his life or his time in
[56:58] the flesh to the lust of men, but to the
[57:01] will of God. Romans 8 and verse
[57:03] 28. And we know that all things work
[57:06] together for the good to them that love
[57:08] God.
[57:13] You know, that's hard to say that when
[57:14] you're in a trial.
[57:16] It's hard to say that when you're
[57:18] dealing with a a terminal
[57:20] illness. All
[57:23] things didn't say all things are are
[57:25] great. It just says all things work
[57:27] together for the good to them that that
[57:29] are called according to his purpose. For
[57:31] whom he did forno, notice that's for
[57:34] knowledge of God. He also did
[57:36] predestinate
[57:38] to be conformed to the image of his son
[57:41] that he might be the firstborn among
[57:44] many brethren. Now see, God has a
[57:47] desire. He's going to be the firstborn
[57:49] of a new race, a God race. Come on,
[57:53] church. the firstborn among many
[57:55] brethren. Moreover, whom he did
[57:57] predestinate them he called and to whom
[57:59] he called. Those he justified, though
[58:02] you've never done it in the first place.
[58:05] And some of us can say, "Glory to God.
[58:07] I'm glad I didn't do it in the first
[58:09] place." He's like, "Brother Joe, where
[58:11] was the first place?" The first place
[58:12] was in the mind of God. God never saw
[58:15] you in that sin. God never saw you with
[58:17] that thought. God never saw you in that
[58:19] action. God saw you perfect. God saw you
[58:22] spotless. God saw you the way that only
[58:25] God can see a man. And that's through
[58:27] the blood of Jesus Christ. Redeemed,
[58:29] quickened by the power of the Holy
[58:31] Spirit.
[58:33] And to those he justified, he also
[58:36] glorified. That means he changes his so
[58:39] earthly pest house and gives you a new
[58:41] body.
[58:43] Oh, ain't that right, brother Steve?
[58:45] That's Somebody can say amen to that. I
[58:47] need a new body. Yes. Amen. I mean, some
[58:51] of us look like melted ice cream
[58:54] cones. We need a new body.
[58:58] I see. I figure I'd get your attention
[59:00] with that one a little bit. Brother Josh
[59:02] like, "Don't you even talk to me about
[59:04] that." I saw a meme on Facebook. You had
[59:07] two skinny people before they got
[59:08] married. After they got married, they
[59:09] were two big people. Like they ate each
[59:13] other. I am just telling you, you're
[59:15] newly married, you better watch it.
[59:17] We got a couple newly marrieds over here
[59:19] be skinny one minute 10 years from now.
[59:21] Well, we just ain't going to say what
[59:22] they'd
[59:26] be. But we find here in Romans 8 and
[59:29] verse 12, therefore, brethren, we are
[59:30] debtors not to the flesh to live after
[59:32] the flesh. For if you live after the
[59:34] flesh, you shall die. But if through the
[59:36] spirit do mortify the deeds of the body,
[59:38] you shall live. For as many are led by
[59:41] the spirit of God, they are the sons of
[59:43] God. For you have not received the
[59:45] spirit of bondage again to fear, but you
[59:48] have received the spirit of adoption,
[59:49] whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." And the
[59:52] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[59:55] spirit. Notice the spirit itself bears
[59:58] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:00:00] children of God. Amen. And if children
[1:00:04] then
[1:00:06] hes of God and joint airs with Christ,
[1:00:09] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:00:11] may also be glorified together. Notice,
[1:00:14] but the spirit beareth witness with our
[1:00:17] spirit. It means it's the selfsame
[1:00:20] spirit. You're not going to have the
[1:00:22] spirit as brother Brandham would talk
[1:00:23] about of John Dillinger or some of these
[1:00:25] other characters out there. you have
[1:00:27] that spirit then you know if he said if
[1:00:29] I had the spirit of John John Dillinger
[1:00:31] you would think I would have you know
[1:00:32] guns on my side and be a bank robber and
[1:00:34] this that and the other but if the
[1:00:35] spirit of Christ is in you then you
[1:00:37] would do the things of Christ you would
[1:00:39] have the nature of Christ you would have
[1:00:40] the love of Christ therefore the spirit
[1:00:43] of Christ bears witness with the spirit
[1:00:45] that's within us
[1:00:48] but in Leviticus 23 and verse9 brother
[1:00:51] Carson if you'll put that up we're just
[1:00:53] kind of taking our time to build into
[1:00:56] this and I'm not going to hold you long
[1:00:57] this evening, but we look careus 23
[1:01:00] and:e 9. And the Lord spake unto Moses,
[1:01:02] saying, speak unto the children of
[1:01:04] Israel, and say unto them, when you come
[1:01:06] into the land which I give unto you, you
[1:01:09] shall reap the harvest thereof, then you
[1:01:12] shall bring a sheath of the first fruits
[1:01:14] of the harvest unto the priest, and he
[1:01:16] shall wave the sheath before you to be
[1:01:18] accepted for you on the tomorrow after
[1:01:21] the Sabbath. The priest shall wave it.
[1:01:23] Notice and he's talking about a a wave
[1:01:25] offering or the the first fruits. But
[1:01:28] remember now Jesus Christ as I just said
[1:01:30] he was going to be the first born or the
[1:01:32] first fruits of many brethren. So we
[1:01:35] find here in the message the rising of
[1:01:37] the sun. He said the sheep which was the
[1:01:40] first of the seed that you planted when
[1:01:42] it comes up and is ripe and you cut it
[1:01:44] down. This sheep and you take it to the
[1:01:46] priest and let him take it in and wave
[1:01:48] it before the Lord for your accept your
[1:01:50] acception and and that you've been
[1:01:52] accepted. you. And he goes, you have
[1:01:53] come now with your sheep and is to wave
[1:01:56] it before the Lord not on the Sabbath
[1:01:58] but the seventh day but on the first day
[1:02:00] which is we call it the Sunday s u n d-
[1:02:03] a y but he says it's no more s u n
[1:02:06] anymore. He said it's the s o n d a y
[1:02:09] the Sunday that the corner wheat God's
[1:02:12] first one that come up from the dead is
[1:02:14] to be waved over the congregation that
[1:02:16] we are his seed
[1:02:19] and that's the first of the seed of
[1:02:21] those that slept waved upon the first
[1:02:24] day of the week on a Sunday he raised up
[1:02:27] waved goodbye he ascended on high and
[1:02:29] the presence in in the presence of the
[1:02:31] people it was the first corn of God's
[1:02:34] wheat that had ripened raised from the
[1:02:36] had God's first corner. We by notice now
[1:02:39] by God's quickening power, God had
[1:02:41] quickened his life, raised him up from
[1:02:43] the dead, and he was the first fruits of
[1:02:45] those that slept, the first fruit. He
[1:02:48] was that sheath. That's why we had to
[1:02:50] have a wave sheath for the first one
[1:02:52] come to maturity. And it was waved as a
[1:02:55] memorial of thanksgiving to God,
[1:02:57] believing that the rest of them would
[1:02:59] come. It's a was a sign. And I'm here to
[1:03:01] tell you in this hour there's been a
[1:03:03] wave sheep again. Waved over the
[1:03:06] congregation, waved over the people that
[1:03:09] there's more to come. What we saw in the
[1:03:11] life of William Brandham. What we saw in
[1:03:13] the ministry of William Brandom wasn't
[1:03:16] all just that one. But what was he
[1:03:18] saying? He was waved over the people. He
[1:03:21] was waved over Africa. He was waved over
[1:03:23] India. He was waved over the United
[1:03:25] States. He's been waved around the world
[1:03:27] as a first fruit that there's more to
[1:03:30] come to maturity. What William Brandon
[1:03:32] reached, we're all going to reach to
[1:03:34] that same level of maturity of the word.
[1:03:38] Do you believe that church? He said he
[1:03:41] was the first son of God to come to full
[1:03:43] maturity to being God. He's speaking of
[1:03:46] Christ here. He was one plucked up from
[1:03:49] the earth and waved over the people by
[1:03:52] the quickening power.
[1:03:55] the first one. Now listen to what he
[1:03:57] says that he was waved over the promised
[1:04:00] seed that had promise of
[1:04:04] life. He was
[1:04:06] waved over the promised seed that had
[1:04:10] promise of life.
[1:04:12] Remember as I said this morning, he's
[1:04:14] only going to quicken those that he
[1:04:16] redeemed. And he only redeems those that
[1:04:19] he quickens.
[1:04:22] predestination,
[1:04:24] church. You have been predestinated to
[1:04:27] quickening power. And now that seed,
[1:04:30] that word has been waved over that
[1:04:33] predestinated seed. You wonder why
[1:04:35] there's people in our families that
[1:04:37] can't see it.
[1:04:39] people in our families that they just,
[1:04:41] you know, good people, maybe good
[1:04:43] Christians, but they they can't see the
[1:04:45] reality or the revelation of this
[1:04:48] message and what God is doing cuz it's
[1:04:50] only for those
[1:04:53] predestinated. It's only for that seed
[1:04:55] that laid there. But notice in the end
[1:04:57] time, he would bring forth a word again
[1:05:00] and wave it over the people. Wave. And
[1:05:02] that's what he's doing in this hour,
[1:05:04] church. As we just heard, 19 being
[1:05:06] baptized there at brother Ron's church.
[1:05:08] Well, it's a waving of the way sheep
[1:05:10] again. The word going forth again. Why?
[1:05:13] To catch that elected seed to collect to
[1:05:16] collect that that predestinated seed to
[1:05:20] germinate it and bring it to life. It's
[1:05:22] waved over the promised seed of God.
[1:05:27] The first time the sun su n rose in
[1:05:29] Genesis, it was the bringing of a
[1:05:31] message that there would be life upon
[1:05:33] the earth, mortal life. But this time
[1:05:35] when the su n rose, there was a dual sun
[1:05:38] rising. Another s o n rising. It was not
[1:05:42] only an su n rising, it was an s o n had
[1:05:45] to risen and bring eternal life to all
[1:05:47] God's promise. See that by that by
[1:05:50] fornowledge he had seen laying upon the
[1:05:52] earth. No more could it be the botney
[1:05:54] life just live back there at the
[1:05:55] beginning without the su to bring it to
[1:05:57] life. No more than today when sons of
[1:06:00] God is upon the earth. It takes the sen
[1:06:03] life to bring them to eternal life. His
[1:06:06] chosen ones that he knew before the
[1:06:08] foundation of the world that he had
[1:06:10] chosen them in himself before the
[1:06:13] foundation of the world. And if you're
[1:06:15] here this morning and you got the
[1:06:17] slightest desire to serve God, that goes
[1:06:19] to show you that you never belong to the
[1:06:22] enemy, that you are that predestinated
[1:06:25] CG of God. And no matter what you're
[1:06:27] going through, no matter what you face,
[1:06:29] no matter the heartache, no matter the
[1:06:31] sickness, no matter the trial, that
[1:06:33] there's nothing can destroy God's
[1:06:35] purpose for your life. Why? Because God
[1:06:37] is going to wave over that seed. God is
[1:06:40] going to quicken that seed and bring
[1:06:42] that seed to manifestation.
[1:06:46] It may sit dormant, Brother Brad. It may
[1:06:48] sit through a lot of rain. It may sit
[1:06:50] through a lot of heat. It may sit there
[1:06:52] in that field. But at the right time, at
[1:06:55] the right season, oh, that son of God
[1:06:57] can go a long time. That daughter of God
[1:06:59] can go a long time. That mama can go a
[1:07:01] long time. But at the right time, in the
[1:07:04] right season, then the right word, the
[1:07:06] right preacher, the right ministry come
[1:07:08] waving over that seed. and she can't
[1:07:10] help but to germmitize
[1:07:13] because it's God's word being waved over
[1:07:15] the seed that's promised to eternal life
[1:07:23] promised to eternal
[1:07:25] life. Oh my, what a confident it gives
[1:07:28] us as parents.
[1:07:31] What a confidence it gives us as
[1:07:33] believers to
[1:07:35] know there's a seed there and there's a
[1:07:39] word there and there's a message going
[1:07:43] forth and it's already been waved. We've
[1:07:45] already seen those that come to full
[1:07:48] maturity. And if that lays in our heart
[1:07:51] and we can see that that's full maturity
[1:07:54] and we're seed and we're in that same
[1:07:57] that same field then knowing that we may
[1:07:59] not be that full mature bride yet but
[1:08:02] knowing we're on our road there to
[1:08:05] knowing that in the presence of the sen
[1:08:08] son in the presence of the right
[1:08:10] atmosphere with the right worship and
[1:08:12] the right singing and the right praise
[1:08:14] and the right rejoicing and and us
[1:08:16] giving forth praise to God in the right
[1:08:18] atmosphere that seed begins to get
[1:08:20] closer and closer and further up the
[1:08:23] road in full maturity finally sets in.
[1:08:25] It's a declaration that we're not going
[1:08:28] to be just germatized seed and lay in
[1:08:30] the ground, but that little seed like
[1:08:32] that little lily is going to come up
[1:08:33] through the monk. She's going to come up
[1:08:35] and begin to rejoice and praise her God.
[1:08:38] Why? Because that seed oh it may sit
[1:08:40] there in the field of tears. She
[1:08:42] rejoices over the word.
[1:08:46] Think about this. If the tears and the
[1:08:49] and the wheat are in the same field and
[1:08:51] it's hot and it's a drought and the rain
[1:08:54] comes and the tears wave their hands,
[1:08:56] they rejoice.
[1:09:00] You telling me that the predestinated
[1:09:03] anointed elected wheat seed of God can't
[1:09:05] rejoice when the tears of the devil in
[1:09:09] the field, they don't even belong in the
[1:09:11] field, but they're in the field anyway.
[1:09:13] They can throw their hands up and
[1:09:14] rejoice. They can sing and they can
[1:09:16] shout and they can praise and they can
[1:09:18] run and we sit like a bunch of bump on
[1:09:20] the log. Bunch of dead people that don't
[1:09:22] have no experience. And I'm not calling
[1:09:24] you dead church this morning, but I'm
[1:09:25] just saying this that in around this
[1:09:27] message race, we let the Pentecostals,
[1:09:29] we let the apostolic, we let the
[1:09:32] charismatic out worship us when we're
[1:09:34] the full seed of God and we're moving at
[1:09:36] the full maturity of the word and we
[1:09:39] can't rejoice and we can't praise and we
[1:09:42] can't shout and we can't worship
[1:09:47] God. If they can rejoice over the rain
[1:09:49] that they get, what about the rain that
[1:09:51] we get? What about the waving of the
[1:09:53] word over that predestinated anointed
[1:09:56] seed?
[1:09:59] It's the sen
[1:10:01] rising. Hey, I thank God for the su.
[1:10:05] We've had so much rain in in Louisiana.
[1:10:07] I saw Noah last
[1:10:09] week, passed his boat right by my house
[1:10:13] said, "Hold on a little bit longer
[1:10:14] there. The sun is rising. It's the
[1:10:18] rising of the sun.
[1:10:24] See the su n
[1:10:25] rising then, but nay and now it was the
[1:10:28] s o n had risen to bring eternal life to
[1:10:31] all of God's promised seed that by
[1:10:34] fornowledge he had seen laying upon the
[1:10:37] earth. Why can't you not believe the
[1:10:41] message? Because you're predestinated to
[1:10:43] see it. You can't. And when you see it,
[1:10:47] brother Devin, you won't see nothing
[1:10:49] else but this message. You'll never go
[1:10:52] back to the Menite lifestyle, the Amish
[1:10:54] lifestyle, or whatever lifestyle, the
[1:10:56] Baptist, the Methodist, whatever you
[1:10:58] want to call it. When you see it, you
[1:11:00] can never unsee it. It's all that you
[1:11:03] see.
[1:11:07] Oh, it's a glorious thing when you see
[1:11:08] it. Amen. When that seed is quickened,
[1:11:12] that word's waved over it. Oh, you may
[1:11:14] have been a sinner. You may have done
[1:11:16] things. You may have looked at things.
[1:11:17] You may have thought things. But I'm
[1:11:18] going to tell you, when that seed is
[1:11:20] quickened by the power of
[1:11:22] God, all those things that you used to
[1:11:24] see, used to do, used to think begins to
[1:11:27] fall away. And then there's a a new
[1:11:29] nature on the inside. There's a new
[1:11:30] desire on the inside. He said, "I'll put
[1:11:32] my spirit within that spirit." What am I
[1:11:35] talking about? I'm talking about what we
[1:11:36] find in Deuteronomy. God talking about
[1:11:37] giving you a new heart and a new spirit
[1:11:39] and coming and placing his spirit right
[1:11:41] down inside of there so that you can be
[1:11:44] a genuine full mature word bride.
[1:11:49] There you go. Come on. Do we got any
[1:11:52] more witnesses in here?
[1:11:55] Any more witness? Have we become so so
[1:11:58] common to the messes? No, sir. Don't
[1:12:00] ever allow yourself to get complacent.
[1:12:02] recognize God had bring you through the
[1:12:04] drags of humanity and God has lifted you
[1:12:07] into a place when he's quickened that
[1:12:09] seed. You're the elected of God, the
[1:12:11] anointed of God, and the quickened of
[1:12:13] God. You hath he quickened.
[1:12:20] Ephesians 1 and:3 says, "Blessed be the
[1:12:22] God and father, father of our Lord Jesus
[1:12:24] Christ, who had blessed us with all
[1:12:26] spiritual blessings in heavenly places,
[1:12:29] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:12:31] before the foundation of the world, that
[1:12:34] we should be holy without blame before
[1:12:36] him in love." He said, "Before there was
[1:12:39] a world, you were in God's thoughts."
[1:12:42] Amen. But listen to how he phrases this.
[1:12:45] Before there was a world, you were in
[1:12:48] God's stance to give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:54] You was in God's stalks to give you not
[1:12:56] just to be here, not just to exist, not
[1:13:00] just to live, but it was in you in God's
[1:13:02] stalks to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:13:05] because notice what he says now. Because
[1:13:07] he knew that you'd be wanting it.
[1:13:12] He knew that some of you would be
[1:13:14] wanting the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:17] And so he predestinated by fornowledge
[1:13:20] knew that you'd be wanting that Holy
[1:13:22] Ghost. Therefore, he lay it on a man's
[1:13:25] heart to preach a certain way in a
[1:13:27] certain message at a certain time in a
[1:13:28] certain season to quicken that
[1:13:32] seed so that that seed can germatize and
[1:13:35] come to life. See, he chose you in
[1:13:38] himself because you desired. He chose
[1:13:40] you in Christ before you or Jesus or any
[1:13:44] of it was on earth. He chose you in
[1:13:46] Christ. And we find here in John 15:16,
[1:13:50] he says, "You have not chosen me, but I
[1:13:52] have chosen you and ordained you that
[1:13:55] you should go and bring forth fruit and
[1:13:58] that your fruit should remain and that
[1:14:00] whatsoever you shall ask the father in
[1:14:02] my name, he will give it to you." And we
[1:14:05] find here in Jehovah Gyra, brother Ram
[1:14:07] says, "You have not chosen me, but I
[1:14:08] have chose you. So, you're
[1:14:12] chosen chosen at all."
[1:14:17] Somebody needs to say, "Hey, amen."
[1:14:22] He just come to redeem that name. And
[1:14:26] all whose names are not on the lamb's
[1:14:29] book of life before the foundation world
[1:14:31] is the only ones that's going to be
[1:14:32] there anyhow. See, you were chosen in
[1:14:34] him before the foundation of the world.
[1:14:36] When the lamb was chosen, then you were
[1:14:38] chosen with him before the foundation of
[1:14:41] the world. He goes, "Oh, isn't that
[1:14:42] wonderful? He loved you. He loved you
[1:14:45] before there was a world. He knowed your
[1:14:47] nature.
[1:14:50] He knowed your weakness.
[1:14:52] He knowed your habits.
[1:14:55] He knowed all about you, what you was
[1:14:57] going to be, Gideon."
[1:15:00] And then when he looked over all the
[1:15:02] great universe as it was, he said, "I
[1:15:07] choose you."
[1:15:11] Church, think about that again. Don't
[1:15:13] let that just go over your head. He
[1:15:16] loved you before there was a world. He
[1:15:19] knows your nature. Some of you are
[1:15:22] passionate. Some of you are fiery. Some
[1:15:24] of you are meek. Some of you are deeer.
[1:15:27] Some of you are this. Some of us are
[1:15:28] that. And it takes all of that to make a
[1:15:30] nice bouquet, right? A nice flower
[1:15:32] arrangement.
[1:15:33] He knows your weaknesses.
[1:15:36] Come on, church. He knows your
[1:15:40] habits. Man, my habits. Yeah. He knows
[1:15:44] your habits.
[1:15:47] Listen. He knowed all about you, what
[1:15:50] you was going to be. And when he looked
[1:15:52] over all the great universe, Brother
[1:15:54] Devin, he said, "I choose you. I choose
[1:15:58] you from the Menite. I choose you from
[1:16:00] the Amish. I choose you from the
[1:16:02] Baptist. I'll choose you from the
[1:16:03] Methodist. I'll choose you from
[1:16:05] Pentecost. I chose you. I chose you from
[1:16:08] the bar. I chose you from the streets. I
[1:16:11] chose you from sin. I put my stamp of
[1:16:14] approval on you and I quickened you. You
[1:16:17] didn't choose me, but I chose you before
[1:16:20] the foundation of the world. And ain't
[1:16:22] no devil, can't no sick unchoose you,
[1:16:25] church.
[1:16:28] Let me tell you, God ain't fickle like
[1:16:30] we are.
[1:16:32] When I was a
[1:16:34] kid, I was
[1:16:36] fat,
[1:16:38] dumpy. Why y'all
[1:16:40] laughing? That hurt my feelings, Brother
[1:16:47] Glenn. Goody goody for
[1:16:50] you. Well, I wasn't. I was a little
[1:16:54] dumpy, short, fat kid.
[1:16:57] had a little rolls here. I look like the
[1:16:59] Pillsbury
[1:17:01] Doughboy. You know how he does that. He
[1:17:03] punchs me in the belly. About that tall,
[1:17:05] about that
[1:17:07] wide. You know, God don't choose the way
[1:17:10] we choose. We used to play kickball,
[1:17:12] believe it or not. That was a thing back
[1:17:14] in my day.
[1:17:17] Guess who got chose last?
[1:17:22] Hey, this is my sermon. Stay out of it.
[1:17:27] My goodness. I appreciate your
[1:17:29] participation. Only speak when you're
[1:17:31] called upon. No, I'm
[1:17:33] kidding. But I was a little short fat
[1:17:35] kid. They didn't choose short fat people
[1:17:38] first. Cuz in kickball, you got to run.
[1:17:43] You got to be able to at least make it
[1:17:44] to 60 feet, right? Or something like
[1:17:46] that. 90 ft. No. I got chose last. Cuz
[1:17:49] we know our humanity. What do we do? We
[1:17:51] chose. We choose based on size. based on
[1:17:55] muscle, based on
[1:17:56] appearance, based on physique, based on
[1:17:59] skill, based on intellect, based on
[1:18:01] gift. We choose based on fickle things.
[1:18:04] But God doesn't choose that way. God
[1:18:06] looked at your weaknesses. God looked at
[1:18:08] your habits. God looked at your
[1:18:10] failures. God looked at your mistakes.
[1:18:12] And yet God still says, "I choose you in
[1:18:15] this hour." When he looked around all
[1:18:17] the world and he could have chose
[1:18:18] anybody, he could have elected anybody.
[1:18:21] God said, "I choose you. I choose you to
[1:18:24] be a believer. I choose you to receive
[1:18:26] the Pentecostal spirit. I choose you to
[1:18:28] be born again. I choose you to be
[1:18:31] quickened by the power of God. God chose
[1:18:34] us for this. That's why you're here
[1:18:36] today. Because God chose you for the
[1:18:38] message. God chose you to be a believer.
[1:18:43] And when God chooses you, church, he can
[1:18:46] never unchoose you.
[1:18:52] There was times I got picked first. Oh,
[1:18:54] made a mistake. Get back to the end of
[1:18:55] the line, little
[1:18:58] fatty. But God don't work that way. God
[1:19:01] don't unchoose you. Come on,
[1:19:05] somebody. God don't unchoose what he's
[1:19:08] chosen. God don't unquicken what he's
[1:19:11] quickened. God don't unanoint what he's
[1:19:14] anointed. Oh, hallelujah, somebody. Come
[1:19:17] on.
[1:19:21] Notice John 1 John 5 and verse 10. He
[1:19:24] that believeth on the son of God hath
[1:19:26] the witness in himself. He that
[1:19:29] believeth not God hath had made him a
[1:19:31] liar because he believeth not the record
[1:19:34] that God gave his son. And this is the
[1:19:36] record that God has given us to eternal
[1:19:38] life. And this life is in his son. He
[1:19:41] that hath the son hath life.
[1:19:44] Notice, he that hath the son, the life,
[1:19:48] the quickening power, hath life. He that
[1:19:52] hath not the son hath not
[1:19:55] life. He's only going to rapture those
[1:19:59] that have life.
[1:20:04] Have life. Not a
[1:20:07] form, not an idea, not an
[1:20:11] intellect, not a dress code or a bunch
[1:20:14] of rules of dos and don'ts. This is what
[1:20:16] we do to measure
[1:20:18] up. But he that hath the son hath life.
[1:20:22] He that hath not the son hath not life.
[1:20:26] And it would go on to say in the church
[1:20:28] age, this is the record God had given to
[1:20:30] us, eternal life. And this life is in
[1:20:32] the son. And he that hath the son hath
[1:20:35] life eternal. He that hath not the son
[1:20:37] hath not life eternal. And those who
[1:20:40] have that life were in him before the
[1:20:42] foundation of the world. They were
[1:20:44] chosen in him before the foundation of
[1:20:46] the world. The great royal seed Jesus
[1:20:49] Christ was planted. He died and that
[1:20:51] life that was in him came up through the
[1:20:53] wheat plant and is reproducing itself in
[1:20:56] multitudes of wheat seeds having the
[1:20:58] same life in them and being like the
[1:21:01] original because by the spirit they are
[1:21:03] original.
[1:21:05] So let me ask you, when's the last time
[1:21:08] that you've been accused of being
[1:21:09] Pentecostal?
[1:21:14] Silence falls over the church. Come on.
[1:21:17] You mean to tell me ain't none of y'all
[1:21:19] been accused of being
[1:21:21] drunk? Ain't been accused of being
[1:21:24] Pentecostal? But listen what he says.
[1:21:27] Because by the spirit they are original.
[1:21:31] Well, when did the original seed get
[1:21:33] planted? When did original tree get
[1:21:36] planted? On the day of
[1:21:38] Pentecost. And what they were, we are.
[1:21:43] Don't be ashamed of your Pentecostal
[1:21:45] roots, church. I'm not saying you just
[1:21:48] jump up and shout and popcorn dance and
[1:21:50] all that, but I'm just saying don't be
[1:21:53] ashamed of where you come from. He says,
[1:21:56] "Now we can see why the redeemed bought
[1:21:59] back by the original owner bride, the
[1:22:01] redeemed bride. She was in him as Eve
[1:22:03] was in Adam cannot ever have their
[1:22:05] member names taken off the record. She
[1:22:07] is part of him. She is in the throne.
[1:22:10] She can never be judged. Everyone in the
[1:22:12] bride is a member of him and he loses
[1:22:15] none.
[1:22:18] Hallelujah. Revelations 3 and verse 5,
[1:22:20] the Bible says, "He that overcomemeth,
[1:22:22] the same shall be clothed in white
[1:22:24] raignment. I will not blot out his name
[1:22:26] out of the book of life, but I will
[1:22:28] confess his name before the father and
[1:22:30] before his angels." Revelations 13 and
[1:22:32] verse 8. And all that dwell upon the
[1:22:34] earth shall worship him whose names,
[1:22:36] notice now, who names are not written in
[1:22:38] the book of life of the lamb slain
[1:22:40] before the foundation of the world.
[1:22:42] Revelations 20 verse1 15. And whosoever
[1:22:45] was not found written in the book of
[1:22:46] life was cast into the lake of fire. I'm
[1:22:50] not trying to scare you. I'm just trying
[1:22:51] to show you the reality of where we
[1:22:54] are. You can't just be playing church.
[1:22:58] You can't just be going through the
[1:23:00] motions.
[1:23:01] You can't just say, "Well, I believe God
[1:23:03] sent a prophet and Brother Joe's my
[1:23:05] favorite preacher."
[1:23:10] There you go. I got a laugh out of you
[1:23:11] that way. It's not based on those
[1:23:14] things. You have to know that you hath
[1:23:17] he quickened.
[1:23:20] Once your desires were to the world,
[1:23:22] once your desires were to look at things
[1:23:24] on the internet, go to some of them
[1:23:25] dirty sites and some of this and some of
[1:23:27] that. But now your desires are turned
[1:23:32] heavenly.
[1:23:34] Now the things that you used to
[1:23:36] do, maybe gambling, maybe this, maybe
[1:23:40] that, maybe that, now God has taken that
[1:23:43] out of your heart.
[1:23:46] Now he's turned your heart heavenly.
[1:23:48] He's turned your mind, your heart back
[1:23:50] to the faith of the fathers.
[1:23:54] Notice he says here, this is in the mark
[1:23:57] of the beast. If he isn't infinite, then
[1:23:59] he isn't God. But if he is infinite, he
[1:24:02] knowed all things from the beginning.
[1:24:03] And so therefore, he could elect, not
[1:24:05] because he wanted to, but because of
[1:24:08] fornowledge, let him know who would and
[1:24:10] who would not be. And that's the reason
[1:24:12] the entire church, every person that'll
[1:24:15] ever be in the rapture. Their names were
[1:24:17] put on the lamb's book of life before
[1:24:19] the foundation of the world says the
[1:24:22] Bible. But before he can rapture a
[1:24:25] church, he has to come first to redeem
[1:24:28] the
[1:24:29] elect. And before he can redeem the
[1:24:32] elect, he has to quicken the seed.
[1:24:36] So after this bride, this seed comes to
[1:24:39] full maturity, then he will come and
[1:24:41] rapture her and she'll ever be with him
[1:24:44] at his side. See, the church was planted
[1:24:47] on the day of Pentecost. That was an
[1:24:48] infant church.
[1:24:51] He's not coming for an infant church.
[1:24:54] He's coming for a mature bride,
[1:24:57] mature, fully matured on the word in the
[1:25:00] word. And he says the new birth is
[1:25:02] Christ is a revelation. God has revealed
[1:25:04] to you this great mystery. Notice here
[1:25:07] and that's a new birth. Now, what are
[1:25:09] you going to do when you get all that
[1:25:11] grouped together where the revelation is
[1:25:13] perfectly in harmony and God is
[1:25:15] expressing it through the word by the
[1:25:16] same actions, the same things that he
[1:25:18] did making the word manifest. If the
[1:25:21] church only knew its position,
[1:25:25] listen, if the church only knew its
[1:25:29] position, it will one day, then the
[1:25:32] rapture will go when it knows what it
[1:25:35] is. Amen.
[1:25:37] So, you got to turn your mind heavenly.
[1:25:40] Quit giving into fear. Quit giving into
[1:25:42] depression. Quit giving into anxiety.
[1:25:44] Quit giving into your failures. Quit
[1:25:46] giving into your mistakes. And give
[1:25:48] yourself to the word. Because it's the
[1:25:50] word that quickens the seed. Realize
[1:25:54] where you came
[1:25:55] from. Realize where you're going. Amen.
[1:26:00] And if you have a question, well, I
[1:26:03] don't know. I don't know. I need the
[1:26:06] assurance. God is here. He's a dissolver
[1:26:08] of doubts.
[1:26:10] You don't have to have questions in your
[1:26:13] experience whether you have the Holy
[1:26:15] Ghost or not. You can absolutely know
[1:26:16] beyond a shadow of a doubt that you know
[1:26:19] that you know that you know that you
[1:26:21] know that you got it.
[1:26:24] I was telling a brother
[1:26:26] earlier when I came to the Lord, I had a
[1:26:29] bad habit. We we're not going to go into
[1:26:32] that right now, but I had a habit. It
[1:26:33] wasn't a good habit. was a bad habit and
[1:26:34] a habit kept me bound and kept me
[1:26:36] defeated. And you know, I knew it would
[1:26:38] take something greater than me to
[1:26:40] overcome this thing. I can lay it down,
[1:26:42] but I'd go back and pick it up, lay it
[1:26:43] down, go back and pick it up, lay it
[1:26:44] down, and go back and pick it up. But I
[1:26:46] got desperate before God, and I began to
[1:26:48] fast. And I went on a 30-day fast. I
[1:26:51] wanted to know that I knew that I knew
[1:26:53] that I knew. I wanted not only to be a
[1:26:55] good husband to my wife. I wanted to be
[1:26:57] a good father to my children. I wanted
[1:26:59] to be a good a good church member. I
[1:27:01] didn't want I didn't want to have any
[1:27:02] mistakes. I didn't want to have a failed
[1:27:04] marriage. I didn't want to have a, you
[1:27:05] know, be a pathetic father who couldn't
[1:27:07] provide for his family. But I needed to
[1:27:09] know beyond the shadow of a doubt that I
[1:27:12] had what it takes to be a real son of
[1:27:13] God. And I went on this fast for 30
[1:27:16] days. And on the 28th day, I was out
[1:27:18] strolling Lauren around. She was a
[1:27:20] little six, seven, eightmon baby at the
[1:27:22] time. And we were strolling. And I was
[1:27:24] just talking to God, just reminiscing
[1:27:26] and talking to him. Lord, I just really
[1:27:28] need to know this. I looked at this
[1:27:29] example and I saw failure. And I saw
[1:27:31] that failure. And I saw that failure and
[1:27:33] the Lord came and said, "Look at your
[1:27:35] life. Look at your desires. I have given
[1:27:38] you the Holy Ghost. The things that you
[1:27:40] used to do, you don't do them anymore.
[1:27:43] The desires that you used to have, you
[1:27:45] no longer have that desire. I've taken
[1:27:47] that from you. And I've given you the
[1:27:49] Holy Ghost. And can I tell you, church,
[1:27:51] I've never went back. I never looked
[1:27:53] back. I never gone back to that
[1:27:55] lifestyle, back to that trash pin." No.
[1:27:58] Why? Because quickening power came.
[1:28:02] quickening power of the Holy Ghost is
[1:28:04] sure is sure for you today. You don't
[1:28:06] have to question. You don't have to
[1:28:08] struggle with it. You can know beyond
[1:28:10] the shadow of a doubt that God is still
[1:28:12] the same. And he's quickening seeds of
[1:28:14] God.
[1:28:18] He said if the church only knew its
[1:28:21] position, it will one of these days.
[1:28:27] Then the rapture will go. Church, some
[1:28:29] of you he's waiting on
[1:28:33] Some of you, he's waiting for you to
[1:28:35] recognize that your bride. Satan has
[1:28:38] lied and lied and lied and lied and lied
[1:28:41] and lied and lied. But he's waiting on
[1:28:44] you to recognize I always was bride.
[1:28:49] I never belonged to the devil.
[1:28:54] Oh, he may have put you in the pawn
[1:28:57] shop. He may have put you in the prison.
[1:28:58] He may have put you in jail. But I'm
[1:29:00] here to tell you the price has been
[1:29:01] paid.
[1:29:04] The price has been paid, church. He was
[1:29:07] waved at the day of Pentecost. He says
[1:29:09] when there came a sound from heaven like
[1:29:11] waving of a mighty rushing wind, it was
[1:29:13] waved over the people, the Pentecostal
[1:29:15] people that was up there at Pentecost
[1:29:17] waiting for the blessings to come and to
[1:29:19] be waved again. And we realize at the
[1:29:22] last day according to Luke 17:30 in the
[1:29:24] Sunday sen day again in the day that the
[1:29:27] sen man will be revealed a waving again.
[1:29:31] Notice hallelujah church. Why did God
[1:29:33] send a message to waving again over the
[1:29:36] people that you never was out there in
[1:29:38] sin? You never belong to the devil but
[1:29:40] he's waving against you always was
[1:29:43] predestinated dermatized seed of God.
[1:29:46] You never was that but you was always
[1:29:48] mine. It's my field. It's my seed and
[1:29:51] it's my word quickening that seed to
[1:29:54] life. It was God the whole time and he
[1:29:57] waved the message, a great message of
[1:29:59] grace over your life.
[1:30:05] What was it declaring? There were all
[1:30:07] going to be little William Brandoms.
[1:30:12] Uhuh. That we're all going to mature in
[1:30:14] the
[1:30:15] revelation of William Brandom. Not of
[1:30:18] William Brandon but of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:23] Notice when did the evening time
[1:30:27] sacrifice? When was the token offered?
[1:30:31] In the evening time. So the token could
[1:30:34] only come in the evening time. And the
[1:30:36] prophet would say it's the evening time
[1:30:38] of my
[1:30:39] ministry. Oh, we had
[1:30:41] justification, Luther's message. We had
[1:30:44] sanctification, Wesley's message. We had
[1:30:46] the restoration of the gifts through
[1:30:49] Pentecost. But what about the quickening
[1:30:53] power, the token could only come into
[1:30:56] existence at the evening
[1:30:59] time? Oh church, it took those seven
[1:31:02] seals. He said it took quickening power
[1:31:05] to open those seven seals to us. What
[1:31:08] did your prophet say? If he hadn't come,
[1:31:12] I'd have made a horrible mistake. if he
[1:31:14] hadn't come. I'm just I'm reading the
[1:31:17] seals right now and everyone I go
[1:31:18] through he says and he showed up again
[1:31:20] or he came again and you know I was
[1:31:22] looking leaning this way but if he
[1:31:24] hadn't come see it's the quickening
[1:31:26] power because that word has to wave over
[1:31:28] the people so that that life can come in
[1:31:31] this life
[1:31:33] because it ain't the life of the church.
[1:31:35] It's not the life of a pastor. It's not
[1:31:36] the life of a movement. It's not the
[1:31:38] life of a denomination that's going to
[1:31:40] rapture you. But it's that life. that
[1:31:43] life. And if that life is living in this
[1:31:45] life, then you're sons and daughters of
[1:31:48] God.
[1:31:50] All right, let's bring this down. Start
[1:31:52] bringing this down to a
[1:31:54] close. I'm not closing. I'm saying I'm
[1:31:56] bringing it
[1:31:58] down. Boy, y'all a tough crowd this
[1:32:00] morning, this
[1:32:02] evening. He said the Christ was the
[1:32:04] first one to raise from all the prophets
[1:32:07] and so forth. Although typed in many
[1:32:10] places, he was the first fruits of those
[1:32:12] that slept in the bride coming of Christ
[1:32:15] coming out of the church. There they'll
[1:32:17] have a to be a sheath waved again for
[1:32:19] the last days. The waving of a sheath.
[1:32:22] What was a sheath? Their first one to
[1:32:23] come to maturity. Their first one that
[1:32:25] proved that it was wheat proved that it
[1:32:27] was sheath. He said, "In the first time
[1:32:29] there there that will come forth for the
[1:32:31] bride age, a resurrection out of dark
[1:32:34] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:32:37] will notice that the full maturity of
[1:32:39] the word has turned back again in its
[1:32:41] full power and being waved over to
[1:32:43] people by the same signs, the same
[1:32:45] wonders that it had back there. And
[1:32:47] today people look, we are the people
[1:32:49] that have come to full maturity of the
[1:32:51] word."
[1:32:54] I don't think you heard that. We are
[1:32:58] Come on, get your little handkerchief
[1:32:59] out and wave it right now. We are the
[1:33:02] people that have come to full maturity
[1:33:04] of the word. There's not another
[1:33:05] messenger coming. There's not another
[1:33:07] prophet coming. There's not another
[1:33:09] people coming. We are the people. We are
[1:33:12] the finality. We are the final voice to
[1:33:14] the final age. And the people under that
[1:33:17] messenger will be the final voice, the
[1:33:19] final power, the full revelation of all
[1:33:23] that the word declare according to a
[1:33:25] messenger. according to a bride. You are
[1:33:28] the fulfillment of it, church.
[1:33:31] And that seed has to be
[1:33:34] quickened. And I will say it like this,
[1:33:37] and you had he
[1:33:43] quickened. The Bible would tell
[1:33:46] us in Romans
[1:33:48] 8:19, "For the earnest expectation of
[1:33:51] the creature waiteth for the
[1:33:53] manifestation of sons of God. For the
[1:33:55] creature was made subject to vanity, not
[1:33:58] willingly, but by reason of him who who
[1:34:00] has subjected the same in hope. Because
[1:34:03] the creature itself also shall be
[1:34:04] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:34:06] in the glorious liberty of the children
[1:34:08] of God. For we know that the whole
[1:34:10] creation groanth and travaleth in pain
[1:34:13] together until
[1:34:15] now. And not only they, but we
[1:34:18] ourselves. How many you woke up this
[1:34:20] morning with an ache or a pain?
[1:34:24] groaning, ain't
[1:34:25] you? Come on. I can do
[1:34:28] y'all. Yeah, I'm groaning. Woke up back.
[1:34:32] I about fell
[1:34:34] over. Groaning for what? For a change.
[1:34:40] For a body change. Growning for what?
[1:34:43] For the
[1:34:44] manifestation of the sons of
[1:34:47] God. And can I tell you this? He's been
[1:34:50] waiting for you to come.
[1:34:54] He has been waiting for you to come to
[1:34:57] maturity
[1:34:59] to recognize your position in the body.
[1:35:03] He's been longing for a wife. Now, some
[1:35:07] of you here, maybe you're longing for a
[1:35:10] husband. Maybe you're longing for a
[1:35:13] wife. Don't raise your hand at once.
[1:35:17] When I told my I told people when I got
[1:35:19] married, I was predestinated for
[1:35:21] marriage. Single life was
[1:35:24] boring. Cook your own food, clean your
[1:35:27] own clothes, wash your own house. I
[1:35:29] mean, all that junk. Forget all that.
[1:35:31] Now, she's not my She is my wife, and
[1:35:33] she does do my clothes and all that, but
[1:35:35] ain't why I married her. Let me make
[1:35:38] sure that's right now.
[1:35:40] Yeah, she married me for my
[1:35:43] looks. But I lost him. She's stuck now.
[1:35:46] Brother Glenn, poor thing. Pray for
[1:35:50] her. You didn't have to agree so
[1:35:53] emphatically
[1:35:54] there. But we find the whole world is
[1:35:57] waiting for the manifestation of sons.
[1:35:59] He's longing for a wife. That's bone of
[1:36:02] his bone, flesh of his flesh, power of
[1:36:07] his power. Not one foot in the church
[1:36:10] and one out in the world. Not one in
[1:36:11] that's so steeped in, you know, a
[1:36:13] denominational background. They can't
[1:36:15] come subject to the word of God, but one
[1:36:17] that's been quickened by the
[1:36:20] word. So, we kind of come down here and
[1:36:22] brother Bam talked about, he said here
[1:36:25] in the message, this rising in the sun,
[1:36:26] we're going to come back. If we're going
[1:36:28] to go back to Tucson and we're going to
[1:36:29] get two two Cadillacs and he began to
[1:36:31] explain this and he said and all the
[1:36:33] seats, now let's look at this Cadillac
[1:36:35] for a minute. Both of them are identical
[1:36:37] Cadillacs. The seats were made out of
[1:36:39] doough skin, the softest of leather,
[1:36:41] soft and easy to sit in. And the
[1:36:43] floorboards were plush. And the steering
[1:36:45] wheel was nickelplated and had diamond
[1:36:47] studs all over it. And the engine was
[1:36:49] mechanically tested to be exactly the
[1:36:51] right engine. And the wheels, you know,
[1:36:53] the bearings all greased up. The tires
[1:36:55] were puncture proof and blowout free.
[1:36:57] All been scientifically tested. He goes,
[1:37:00] they pushed them off the assembly line.
[1:37:01] Both of them, both of them filled up
[1:37:03] with gasoline. That's the running power
[1:37:05] of the gasoline because it's in the
[1:37:07] octane. He says, "Now when when you're
[1:37:09] going to start them, although both of
[1:37:10] them look just alike,
[1:37:14] but there is one of them that don't have
[1:37:15] any spark, any firing power." You say,
[1:37:19] "The power is in the gasoline, brother
[1:37:21] B. I don't care how much power is in the
[1:37:23] gasoline." Unless there's a spark there
[1:37:26] to manifest that power, there's a
[1:37:28] there's a power there to confirm that
[1:37:30] it's gasoline. If it ju, he said, "It
[1:37:32] just might as well be water." If
[1:37:34] not, no matter how much theologians
[1:37:37] claim, how well you got your church set,
[1:37:40] how much education you got, how much
[1:37:42] like the Bible, until that way sheet
[1:37:44] until the Holy Spirit comes upon that
[1:37:46] person to quicken the word, the gasoline
[1:37:48] represents the word is the truth. But
[1:37:50] without the spirit, it won't move. He
[1:37:53] goes, we have to we put too much stress
[1:37:55] on the mechanics and nothing on the
[1:37:57] dynamics.
[1:38:00] It needs the dynamic power of God. the
[1:38:03] resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon
[1:38:05] the church to manifest to bring it to
[1:38:07] pass that it is gasoline. It might as
[1:38:09] well he says it might be gasoline in a
[1:38:11] can. It could be still be water but only
[1:38:13] proof is does it have life in
[1:38:17] it? And God's promise he's going to have
[1:38:20] a bride. But how do you know she's
[1:38:22] bride? Because she's got life in it.
[1:38:25] Amen. Amen. Her life measures up to his
[1:38:28] life. Cuz they can be two cars, two
[1:38:31] churches, sitting right here in the
[1:38:34] service right now, look just the same,
[1:38:37] long
[1:38:38] hair, you know, nice morally dressed,
[1:38:42] going through the motions. One has fire,
[1:38:45] one doesn't have fire. One has spark,
[1:38:48] the other one doesn't have spark. But
[1:38:50] notice, he's coming for an elect. He
[1:38:52] said, "It won't move until the dynamics
[1:38:55] come." I'm not trying to put focus on
[1:38:57] the dynamics to say that's all we got to
[1:38:58] have in a church. But we have the
[1:39:00] mechanics. We're preaching the unfailing
[1:39:03] word of God. We're preaching the message
[1:39:04] of the hour. The same message that Paul
[1:39:07] preaches being preached to you here from
[1:39:09] behind this pulpit day in and week in
[1:39:11] and week out. We're not preaching
[1:39:13] somebody else's uh doctrine, somebody
[1:39:15] else's message. We're preaching Paul's
[1:39:17] message. But Paul's message must come in
[1:39:20] manifestation of the people. There's got
[1:39:22] to be a people that live up and mature
[1:39:25] to that same level of experience that
[1:39:28] Paul had, that William Brandham had, and
[1:39:30] that many of our great ministers around
[1:39:32] the world. They're measuring up. And God
[1:39:33] is calling us to rise up to that same
[1:39:36] calling, that same anointing, that same
[1:39:39] quickening power.
[1:39:44] The predestinated one of course he says
[1:39:46] like the seed laid upon the earth and
[1:39:48] one that was laid in them. Many of them
[1:39:49] were dead. They were just rotten seed
[1:39:51] waters and things burn them out. He said
[1:39:53] but the seed was laying there. The
[1:39:54] predestinated ones are the first to be
[1:39:56] quickened by the Holy Spirit. Notice and
[1:39:58] he goes on to say this. He said there
[1:40:00] was a rock there and the rock will say
[1:40:02] well it's too hot. The dirt there the
[1:40:04] dirt will say it's too hot. But the seed
[1:40:06] that original seed the original seed
[1:40:09] would say this is exactly what I'm
[1:40:11] looking for. It takes that sun. It takes
[1:40:14] that heat. It takes that kind of service
[1:40:17] to quicken the seed. The sun was never
[1:40:19] sent to quicken the rock. It was never
[1:40:21] sent to quicken the dirt. It was only
[1:40:24] sent to quicken the seed. And that's why
[1:40:26] some people get up and walk out and walk
[1:40:29] out on the message cuz they never were
[1:40:31] seed. But that genuine seed of God, it
[1:40:34] will be quickened by the word of God.
[1:40:46] And I'm about to bring this to a close.
[1:40:48] Listen what he says here. This is in the
[1:40:50] Smyrna church age. As the eternal logos,
[1:40:53] God was manifest in the son. And in
[1:40:56] Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the
[1:40:58] godhead bodily, and that eternal one was
[1:41:00] the father manifest in the flesh, and
[1:41:03] thereby gain heed a title of son. Even
[1:41:05] so we eternal in the thoughts in our
[1:41:08] term became the many membered spoken
[1:41:11] word seed manifest in the flesh and
[1:41:14] those eternal thoughts now manifest in
[1:41:17] the flesh are the sons of God even as we
[1:41:20] are so called or even as we are
[1:41:23] so-called we did not become seed by the
[1:41:27] rebirth we were seed therefore we can re
[1:41:30] be reborn for only the elect can be
[1:41:33] reborn because we First seed is a reason
[1:41:36] we could be quickened. In nonseed,
[1:41:39] there's nothing to
[1:41:40] quicken. In non seed, there's nothing to
[1:41:45] quicken. Musicians, if you would
[1:41:48] come, I'm going to bring this down right
[1:41:51] here with this. Galatians 4 and verse
[1:41:55] one. Galatians 4 and verse one. Now I
[1:41:59] say that an heir as long as he is a
[1:42:01] child differ from a servant.
[1:42:04] though he be lord of all but is under
[1:42:06] tutors and governors until the time
[1:42:07] appointed of the father. Even so we when
[1:42:11] we were children we were in bondage
[1:42:12] under the elements of the world. But
[1:42:14] when the fullness of time had come forth
[1:42:17] his son made of a woman made under the
[1:42:18] law to redeem them that were under the
[1:42:21] law that we might receive the adoption
[1:42:23] of sons. And because you are sons, God
[1:42:27] has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:42:29] into your hearts crying aba father.
[1:42:31] Wherefore thou art no more a servant.
[1:42:34] Get this in your head today church.
[1:42:36] Let's matter of fact get it in your
[1:42:38] heart. Wherefore thou art no more a
[1:42:40] servant but a son. And if a son than an
[1:42:43] heir of God through Christ. But we look
[1:42:45] back here in verse five. And this is
[1:42:47] where I want to bring this and close out
[1:42:49] right here with this. Come to redeem
[1:42:52] them that were under the law that we
[1:42:54] might receive the adoption of sons. Now,
[1:42:58] in our present day adoption of sons, we
[1:43:02] understand that's the placing of sons,
[1:43:05] right? Did y'all go to sleep on
[1:43:08] me? It's the placing of sons. But in our
[1:43:12] modern times, do you know that a parent,
[1:43:15] as a parent, you can disown your son or
[1:43:18] you can disown your
[1:43:21] child? Some of y'all be like, man, if I
[1:43:23] have known that, I' done that a long
[1:43:24] time ago. But as a parent, you can
[1:43:27] disown a
[1:43:29] child. Disownment is a term used when a
[1:43:32] parent renounces or no longer accepts a
[1:43:34] child as part of the
[1:43:36] family. This can happen due to various
[1:43:38] reasons, including perceived negative
[1:43:40] actions or significant emotional
[1:43:44] distress. It's important to note that
[1:43:46] disownment is a social and interpersonal
[1:43:49] act distinct from abandoning a child or
[1:43:51] giving them up for
[1:43:53] adoption. and can and notice and can
[1:43:55] have s severe emotional consequences for
[1:43:58] the child. As a parent, you can disown
[1:44:02] your
[1:44:04] child. And this is where I want to bring
[1:44:06] this
[1:44:08] home. But as an adopted
[1:44:12] child, see, while the term disown is
[1:44:15] often used informally to describe
[1:44:18] severing ties with a child legally, you
[1:44:20] cannot disown an adopted child.
[1:44:25] Did y'all just hang up on me? I said,
[1:44:28] "You cannot disown an adopted child. You
[1:44:32] may disown your own, but you can't
[1:44:34] disown an adopted child." Why is that?
[1:44:36] Because the adopted child is he may be
[1:44:38] in the same way as a a regular child.
[1:44:41] The adoption creates a permanent legal
[1:44:44] parent child relationship. And once
[1:44:46] finalized, adoption grants adopted
[1:44:48] parents the same legal rights and
[1:44:51] responsibilities by as a biological
[1:44:53] parent and his relationship is intended
[1:44:56] to be permanent. You can't unadopt a
[1:44:58] child. There's no legal process to
[1:45:01] simply undo an adoption once it's been
[1:45:03] legally finalized. And what am I telling
[1:45:05] you? That God came in this hour. God
[1:45:07] came in this day. God sent a message to
[1:45:10] call you to adopt you as sons of God.
[1:45:13] And if God's ever adopt you, he went
[1:45:15] through the legal procession, hung on
[1:45:17] Calvar's cross. He can never unadopt
[1:45:20] you, church. You always was a son
[1:45:23] adopted as sons of God and joint hes
[1:45:25] with Christ. Quickened by the Holy
[1:45:27] Ghost, quickened by the power of God.
[1:45:30] Don't you worry, you're no longer
[1:45:31] service. You're sons of God. Beloved,
[1:45:34] behold, now we're the sons of
[1:45:38] God. Don't put it off till tomorrow.
[1:45:40] Don't put it off to the next service.
[1:45:42] right now in this service. We are the
[1:45:44] sons of God. We are the daughters of
[1:45:46] God. Recognize who you are. Recognize
[1:45:49] your position in the body. Recognize
[1:45:51] where you come from. Recognize where
[1:45:53] you're going. You don't belong to the
[1:45:55] devil. You belong to God. We're no
[1:45:59] longer servants. We're no longer slaves.
[1:46:01] We're no longer scavengers to the
[1:46:03] worldly things. We're adopted
[1:46:06] sons. And we can't be
[1:46:09] [Music]
[1:46:10] unadopted. Woo.
[1:46:13] Hallelujah. He chose you in him before
[1:46:15] the foundation of the world. And he's
[1:46:17] not going to unchoose
[1:46:20] you. Chosen in him, predestinated in
[1:46:24] him, quickened in him, for him, by him,
[1:46:28] the three-fold purpose of God, so that
[1:46:31] he can take a bride, have so much
[1:46:34] preeminence in that bride, and restore
[1:46:37] her back to a needing condition. Mama,
[1:46:40] that's me. That's where I'm going. I
[1:46:42] don't belong to this world. I don't
[1:46:44] belong to this pest house. One day I'm
[1:46:46] going to drop this old rags of humanity
[1:46:49] and I'm going to step into a new body.
[1:46:51] I'm going to step into a glorified body.
[1:46:53] Why? Because God had already seen me in
[1:46:55] that body. And he would tell Job, Job,
[1:46:57] where were you before the sons of God
[1:46:59] shouted. He saw Job on the other side
[1:47:02] rejoicing. What does he see in Evenite
[1:47:04] Tabernacle? He sees you rejoicing over
[1:47:06] the enemy. He sees you shouting over the
[1:47:08] sins of the world. He sees you as he's
[1:47:11] already saw you in heaven in eternity.
[1:47:14] Quickened sons and daughters of God.
[1:47:16] Quickened by the Holy Ghost, quickened
[1:47:17] by power, elected, predestinated,
[1:47:20] anointed, segene of God, rising above
[1:47:23] sin, rising above self, rising above
[1:47:26] fallen humanity and serving the living
[1:47:28] God. God bless you,
[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:47:32] church. Hallelujah.
[1:47:39] I'm a
[1:47:40] child of the
[1:47:43] king and his
[1:47:45] royal
[1:47:47] blood now flows through my
[1:47:52] veins and
[1:47:54] I who was
[1:47:56] wreted and
[1:47:59] found now can
[1:48:01] sing. Praise
[1:48:03] God. Praise God. I'm a child of the
[1:48:11] king. And once I was clothed in the
[1:48:17] wrath of my
[1:48:20] sin,
[1:48:22] wretched and poor, lost and
[1:48:27] lonely
[1:48:29] within, but with
[1:48:31] wonderous
[1:48:33] compassion, the
[1:48:35] King of all
[1:48:38] kings in pity
[1:48:41] and great love. He took me
[1:48:45] under his
[1:48:47] wings. Oh
[1:48:49] yes. Oh
[1:48:51] yes. I'm a
[1:48:54] child of the
[1:48:56] king and his
[1:48:59] royal
[1:49:01] blood now flows through my veins.
[1:49:06] And
[1:49:07] I who was
[1:49:10] wretched and
[1:49:12] vile now can sing. Oh, praise
[1:49:16] God. Praise God. I'm a child of the
[1:49:24] King. And now I'm a child with a
[1:49:31] heavenly home.
[1:49:34] My
[1:49:35] holy
[1:49:37] father has made in me his
[1:49:42] own. And I'm
[1:49:44] cleansed by his blood. And I'm
[1:49:48] clothed in his
[1:49:51] love. And someday I'm going to sing with
[1:49:56] all the
[1:49:58] angels
[1:49:59] above. Oh yes.
[1:50:03] Oh
[1:50:04] yes, I'm a
[1:50:06] child of the
[1:50:09] king. And his
[1:50:11] royal
[1:50:13] blood now flows through my
[1:50:18] veins and I who was
[1:50:22] wretched and
[1:50:24] vile now can see. Oh, praise
[1:50:29] God. Praise God.
[1:50:32] I'm a child of the
[1:50:37] king. He wasn't looking at
[1:50:40] me. He wasn't looking at
[1:50:45] me when he took me
[1:50:50] in. He wasn't looking at my
[1:50:55] heart that was black by sin.
[1:51:00] Oh, he was looking at the
[1:51:04] blood and flowing rich and
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:09] free, that precious
[1:51:12] [Music]
[1:51:13] blood that covers
[1:51:17] me. Oh, he wasn't looking at
[1:51:23] me when he took me in.
[1:51:28] He wasn't looking at my
[1:51:31] heart that was black by
[1:51:36] sin. He was looking at the
[1:51:40] blood flowing rich in
[1:51:45] green. That precious
[1:51:49] blood that covers me.
[1:51:53] [Music]
[1:52:00] Praise the Lord. If you could bring that
[1:52:01] scripture up, Carson, we appreciate
[1:52:04] it. Book of Acts, chapter
[1:52:08] 2. You know, they had come to Peter in
[1:52:11] the after the day of Pentecost, they
[1:52:12] come to Peter and they said, "What what
[1:52:14] shall we do? What shall we do?" And he
[1:52:18] said, 'Now when they had heard this,
[1:52:19] they were pricricked in their hearts and
[1:52:21] said unto Peter and the rest of the
[1:52:22] apostles, men and brethren, what shall
[1:52:24] we do? Then Peter said unto them, repent
[1:52:27] and be baptized, every one of you, in
[1:52:29] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:52:30] remission of sins. Now watch the
[1:52:33] promise. And ye shall receive the gift
[1:52:36] of the Holy Ghost. It wasn't you might
[1:52:38] or you may. There's a possibility, but
[1:52:40] it said you shall. For the promise is
[1:52:42] unto you and to your children, and to
[1:52:45] all that are far off, even as many as
[1:52:47] the Lord our God shall call. And with
[1:52:52] other words did he testify and exhort,
[1:52:54] saying, "Save yourselves from this
[1:52:57] untoward generation." And when they had
[1:52:59] gladly received the word, were baptized,
[1:53:02] and the same day they were added unto
[1:53:04] them about 3,000 souls. So, we're
[1:53:06] certainly thankful to be here today and
[1:53:08] and that Wesson has come forth and and
[1:53:11] just wanted to reaffirm and set set in
[1:53:14] stone exactly from this day forward,
[1:53:16] we're moving forward. And after we
[1:53:19] baptize him, if there's anybody else,
[1:53:21] there's still room in the water. Brother
[1:53:24] Joe, if you'll pray.
[1:53:26] Father, we just come to you today, Lord.
[1:53:28] You see our brother Weston, Father, his
[1:53:30] heart's been pricricked by the word.
[1:53:31] He's wanting the absolute assurance,
[1:53:33] Lord, in this hour, Lord, that he's a
[1:53:35] candidate for the Holy Spirit. And Lord,
[1:53:37] as we had talked earlier today, Lord,
[1:53:39] and we know that it takes a genuine
[1:53:41] repentance, Father, he has come with a
[1:53:43] heart that has repented, Lord, of all
[1:53:45] the wrongs that he's ever done, Lord,
[1:53:47] with the desire receiving the baptism of
[1:53:49] the Holy Spirit. So, Lord, Brother Brad
[1:53:51] and I are going to baptize him into
[1:53:53] water and Lord, to bring him up, Lord
[1:53:55] God, but it's going to take you to
[1:53:56] baptize him with the Holy Spirit and
[1:53:58] fire. So Lord, as we would baptize our
[1:54:00] brother today, Lord, we just ask that
[1:54:02] you would just baptize them where man
[1:54:03] can't. Lord, you'll just prick his heart
[1:54:05] even to a greater understanding of the
[1:54:07] truth, Lord God, and quicken him to
[1:54:09] eternal life. Father, we commit him to
[1:54:11] you today, Lord, for your honor, for
[1:54:13] your glory as a trophy, Lord God. Snatch
[1:54:16] from the fire, Lord God. Satan may have
[1:54:18] thought he had his claim on him, but
[1:54:19] Lord, he's always belonged to you, and
[1:54:21] now he's coming under submission to that
[1:54:22] word and say, Lord, make me a real son
[1:54:24] of God. Make me a real husband, a real
[1:54:26] father, a real son, a real believer.
[1:54:28] Lord, I pray you'd grant that today,
[1:54:30] Father, and fill him with the Holy
[1:54:32] Spirit. We ask in Jesus' name. Amen.
