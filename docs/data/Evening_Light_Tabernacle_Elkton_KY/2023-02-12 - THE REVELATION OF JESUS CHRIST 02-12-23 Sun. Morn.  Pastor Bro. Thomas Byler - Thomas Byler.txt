foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] what a beautiful day to serve the Lord amen let's stand if we could and that's brother Joe if he would open Us in us in a moment of Prayer foreign can be dismissed for Sunday School turn in your bibles if you would to Psalms 51 while you're turning I just want to share something that was on my heart and uh you know I didn't know I was going to be doing the Sunday School reading two weeks that the that the state of Kentucky is the Lord's favorite state and uh and you say well how could you say such well we have the prophet was born in the state of Kentucky uh we've had Abraham Lincoln's from the state of Kentucky um great revivals have happened in the state of Kentucky Peter Cartwright Revival is took place out of Logan County right next door some of the greatest revivals that ever swept the nation and now I don't know if you've kept up with it or you've known what's going on but and I'm getting emotional just because I'm thinking about the moving of the Lord the Asbury University in the state of Kentucky they're currently in a Revival and you say Revival what what are we doing according to the to the stories Wednesday they had their morning Chapel as any other day every student showed up 1500 students showed up for Chapel at Asbury University Asbury University for those don't know it's a non-nominational Christian University in the state of Kentucky that that's founded on Westland holiness uh principles and many many great ministers and preachers have come out of that University and but the morning there they the the message to the to the to the students at the University was a message of repentance and God's love and how you can repent and God's love will cover a multitude of sin and you know I find it ironic that this happens right after the news is saying that we're going to be in a war with with China by 25. there will be no war with China in 25 it'll be the end of the world when that happens we there's not going to be a war between the United States and China that's going to be fought on the back Battlefield it'll be somebody pushing buttons and now we see Asbury university has this revival this has been going on since Wednesday morning and it's continuing 24 7 peoples come from Louisville they've come from Lexington they've come from universities they've come from Virginia and it wasn't planned it was just they just stayed they just stayed and so they've been praising the Lord they've been singing they've been having testimony somebody will come and share the words somebody will come and and spend a a short uh minute uh preaching and it's I'll just find it amazing that the Lord is willing to still move and you say well we're not we're not at Asbury no you're not at Asbury but you're still you got an opportunity to have Revival right here this morning and this scripture come to my mind when I looked at it in Psalms 51 because here you're talking about a Revival here's David when Nathan the prophet comes to him after he had gone in with Bathsheba and here he here it is that the word of God is telling us what what what's happening so I just would like to see a Revival in my life and 24 7. continual I don't know how long it'll go at Asbury it would be neat to just be able to be there be in that presence I've seen the videos you can follow it live you can watch it's really amazing I do know I don't know how long it'll last there but I do know the teachers have already canceled class for next week so uh they're expecting this this to just keep going and going going so let's read this scripture and think about Revival in our own life psalm 51. have mercy upon me o God according to thy loving kindness according unto the multitude of thy Tender Mercies blot out my transgressions for I acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me behold I was shaping in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me urge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow hide thy face from my sin and blot out all my iniquities cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me foreign ERS thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee O Lord open thy thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth I praise foreign Spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh God thou Wilt not despise all together then shall thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness with a burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings then shall they offer Bullocks upon thine altar brother Troy God bless you foreign so true and Now's the Time to get on the boat uh we had maybe a little bit on the same thought uh thought but uh you can go with me let's see here I kind of but what I was thinking was I was listening to uh sermons morning and brother random was speaking about how in his day he was saying it was three minutes till midnight well now it's 90 seconds to midnight uh the Doomsday Clock they changed to 90 seconds they said mostly because of the the war in Ukraine where they said that both sides see that they can win it well I don't see that both sides can win it but that's what I guess they see and that's why they're in that war uh and my wife this morning she said it could how Brethren Brad was seen it would just be a start of a bunch of buttons and uh Russia or Putin had said that if one missile enters their airspace that 100 missiles would be in the air I think within a minute and he he said it's automatic and it would be automatic because everything's automatic these days so it wouldn't be a little thing it would be the end uh of everything and uh in the news then we we had the China uh the Spy balloon it went over the whole nation and then they shot it out of the air now they shot two more things out of the air but uh it just got me thinking my wife had said all it would take is one crazy person to get in there and uh maybe sneak in there I said well you know everything talking back and forth the crazy people are in charge you can't get no crazier than the people that are in charge so uh it could be but either way but we don't have the brightest group in charge of the situation but anyway the the theme that was just pretty much what I was going with I was just gonna go to Genesis chapter 6. in uh to verse five and then I got a couple of little scriptures here I don't know how far I'll get into this but Genesis chapter six and I'm starting just with verse five and it says and God saw the wickedness of man who was great in the earth and then every imagination of thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and he grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the man and Beast and creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that I have made them and this is where we want to be found in verse 8 but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord that's where we want to be found Grace in the eyes of the Lord and we have found Grace and eyes the Lord he sent us a message miracle that that we can see it because a lot of people don't see it and there's a lot of good people out there but they just can't see it and let me see here I was going to go over to Matthew 24 and this is Jesus the disciples come to him and they're asking okay Matthew uh 24. and uh Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the tampon Jesus said unto them c e not all these things rarely I say unto you there shall not be one they're shown not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he said upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall things be and what shall be the sign of the uh coming of the end of the world and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I'm Christ I sh and shall deceive many and you shall hear of Wars rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation chariz against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines pestilence and Earth diverse places they just had an earthquake a bad earthquake in Turkey I don't last I looked it was like I think 20 000 people were dead and these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated all of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many of the many uh be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold and that is hits the nail on the head for today but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved in this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come then ye therefore shall see the abomination of when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken by the Prophet Daniel stand in the Holy Place who's a readeth let him understand then let them which be it in Jerusalem Judea flee into the mountains let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house neither let him which is in the field or turn back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are a child and to them give second those days but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on Sabbath day for then shall the Great Tribulation such as for then shall be great tribulations such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and except those days should days should be shortened there should not have flesh be saved but for the elect sake those days shall be shortened and if any man shall say unto you Lo there here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ false prophets and she also show great signs and wonders in so much as if it were possible they shall they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth the holy is in the street Chambers secret Chambers believe it not for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shine it even onto the West social also the coming of the son of man be for whosoever so where for where so ever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened in the moon shall not give her light and the star shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory and he shall send his angel s with a great sound of a truck Trump and they shall gather together as elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other now learn the parable of the Fig Tree when his branch is yet tender and puteth forth leaves you know that summer is nice so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass to all these things be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall not Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of that day in our no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only but as in the days of Noah were so shall also be coming unless the son of man be for as in the days of Noah they were in for us in the days that were before the flood they were eating drinking marrying and grieving sorry marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left two women shall begin grinding in the at the meal and one shall be taken in the other left watch therefore for ye know not what your what hour your Lord doeth come and he gives good advice here watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up money for such an hour and it's not the son of man cometh who then is a faithful and wise serum as Lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meet in due season blessed is the servant whom his Lord when he come and shall find so doing rarely I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods but if but and if that evil servant shows in his heart my Lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to Smite his fellow servants to eat and drink with the drunken the Lord of that servant shall come in the day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth we're right on the verge of I believe the coming of the Lord and I had quote here this is just from the quote of the day just speaking of it's from why Christ here is the world in its condition there's a nation in its condition there's the women in the condition there's the men in the condition there's everything the elements the signs flying saucers and everything in the skies and all kinds of mysterious things and the Sea roaring tidal waves men's Hearts failing fear perplexed of time distress between nations the church falling away and the man of sin rising up who holds himself above all who is called God he that sitteth in the temple of God showing themselves oh my and has come to this nation and the church is organized and all of them gathered together and as harlots to the to everything exactly as the way though in the way of whoredom boredom is it what is it telling women they can cut their hair telling women they can wear shorts telling and do that and the preachers they do this in the social gospel and things don't let's see don't you see it it's committing adultery with the true can't get to the bottom of this one word I believe is what he said and gods has sent us his true word undenominational no strings tied to it and giving give us pill AR verify or the Holy Ghost that's been with us now for 30 years and we can say for more years than 30 years and everything that he has predicted said come to pass exactly the way he did it and the scripture was but the end of things this is but he therefore sober and watch under prayer I'm shared an article uh where they said the was it the FBI I think had found a loophole where they could uh make Christians or persecute Christians really I think they started with the Catholics so it's strange how it's all going to work out but it'll give I was thinking on the way to church how the how the second beast would give power to the first beast and I was thinking of our our government and what it's turned into and it that it is a beast and one day it will give all the power back to that bro and I was just gonna close with this let's see if I can get it this is just kind of where we are and brother Brandon speaking of it called nearing the shore [Music] police right here before us just stay stable and stay a

to be in the house of the Lord amen God bless you you can be seated we forgot the birthdays and anniversaries last week so we'll have them this year this week because everybody that has a birthday if you want to come up we want to sing for you amen folks we are only two and a half weeks away from March amen we're just about through here brother Luke was strange Amen to your it's good to see you

happy anniversary to you happy anniversary to you every day [Music] [Applause] happy anniversary praise the Lord amen amen do you remember brother Parish uh once again this morning Mr Marjorie asked just around his command once again remembering him he said man she's hanging on for him and so we'll believe with her amen amen and so praying for the Lord's perfect will to be done but yet if it's time not his time yet that he'll raise him up and make him like sister uh Parish keep saying I want him in good health and I want him to perish the way that he was amen that's how she expected so we just believe in with her amen and God will touch him still amen stand with me this morning we want to minister something that I've had on the Shelf so to speak for quite a while now maybe two months something like that and so yesterday just kind of waiting on the Lord and waiting for him to speak to me and and give me something you know and it didn't seem that it was going into any other direction other than that thought came back to my heart of something that's been on my heart to speak on and and that's begin to think on it you know the Lord just begin to multiply it and usually that's what I go by amen is if the Lord will just Inspire something on my heart and so I trust that it'll be a blessing to you it's certainly something that we've heard before but I hope perhaps with the help oh Lord bring it about perhaps in just a little bit different light if we can with the help of the Lord amen and so this is certainly a message you could take a while on but we'll just try to follow the leading of the spirit in which direction to go and what to say on it so let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you father realizing God when we look on the world on the condition of the world as the different ones are spoken already this morning Lord the eliteness of the hour father and where we're at and how Lord even yesterday and different times you begin to think about your country and the way that the condition of the world is it just weighs heavy on your heart and it makes you sad to think that it's gotten that bad and that it is where it is but we realize it has to get that way but Lord you are long-suffering father we realize that sometimes wonder why you haven't come yet but when we think about nine billion people perhaps lives hanging the balance and how patient you are and how long suffering you are not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repentance Lord and father you're going to change it Lord we know when you finally do something and when your day comes and when we're Mercy's over Lord that it's not going to be pleasant it's going to be very terrible it's going to be apocalyptic Lord Jesus and you're going to change both the heavens and the Earth Lord Jesus and you're going to turn it inside out so to speak in all the Sinners and all they'll be turned on turned under so to speak Lord and with the volcanoes and the fired as coming Lord but we're looking for a Heavenly Father that'll Lift us up Lord Jesus and change our mortal bodies Lord and take us out of this world father we're just feeling less at home and less at home here and Beulah Land is certainly calling our hearts this morning Father we ask God that you'll bless the meditation of our heart Lord Jesus bless the reading of the word come Lord and speak to the church father by your spirit the things that you once said today draw us closer to you now Lord we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen turn your bibles if you will we'll go right into our thought this morning amen and I want to speak and I'll just give you my title and I want to call this why a revelation is so important amen why Revelation is so important it seems certainly to have been a topic over the years around the message for amen for a very long time time and it's been said over and over but I I want to again this morning with the help of the Lord look at why it is so important so let's look and we'll just read perhaps a couple of scriptures that we'll start with let's go with the Book of Revelations first of all amen the book of Revelations the first chapter amen revelation of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord how many seed right there that is pretty important amen amen this is the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which must certainly come to pass and he sentence who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that is oh amen I like this next verse blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy amen and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen first I want to begin amen uh because you know I mean talking about and this revelation we know what Revelation means and Revelation means to uncover something that has been covered or hid Amen to reveal Something Real Simple English for us right just to make known something that isn't no amen and so be known God to the people I mean there's this whole thing all along it's been about God showing himself making himself known amen amen how many knows As He makes himself known I was reading somewhere and I'm not sure where it was but it's something somewhere he says God and said I'm going to do this amen uh how is the word anymore did he say say uh uh something that they would stand in awe so that you would be in awe amen God Wants You in awe of him because somebody knows the more you think about God and the more you know about God the more you truly are in awe of God amen now how many knows that God first of all he hides himself right he hides himself in humility and simplicity and as a prophet put it and he reveals himself in the same notice he hides himself in humility and simplicity and then he reveals himself in the in that same way and we know that he God he guides himself many times so simple does things so simple until people pass right over it and don't see it amen even to the point remember this that the Bible talks about it Prophet is not received amen except for in his own country among his own people many times people that know you have a harder time accepting things from you the only family members a lot of times it's harder to accept it from them because well I know him huh you know I know that person you know and if it's the same way with Jesus remember he could not do many works because they said well isn't this uh Joseph I mean Jesus the son of Joseph they didn't look at him right way other place is he can do a lot but not in his own country so God many times hides himself in his broken folks among the old amen and so you always have to be careful amen and so this morning of course we know we could go all the way back to God before he became manifested and then he manifested himself in the logos and came into the Philip fire and into word form and on down like that you know and I'm not good explaining all that but we take that the gut was all that God was revealing himself God was coming forth you know and you might think well he's got the pillar of fire Whirlwind sometimes in a pillar of fire but there's one thing we know and that is the Bible God is a consuming fire god is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship in spirit and truth you know if you're going to worship God this morning it has to be in the spirit amen another place Paul that you know man can call Jesus to Christ but by the Holy Ghost in other words you might say it from your left but you really don't know him until you've got the holy ghost man all right let's take it slow would that be all right amen so we see here that this whole thing is the Book of Revelations and it says that blessed is he are they that here and will focus on that a little after a while about being able to hear and being able to see comes along with that because we know that not very many people truly see God oh yeah amen so many people Miss God Amen when you don't see God and many people see God in a different perspective in a minute different way amen I think about Amish and where I come from well if you don't get put in the band or you're a good punished and so forth and we see you they kind of see God as a Punisher you know just to do an adult and punishing it amen you know what I had y'all judge me this morning and tell me if my thought wasn't uh was correct or not but I had a thought here either yesterday or this morning and thinking about how that you know that there's all these different churches out there and and whether it's Amish Mennonite on all these different churches right and and you think about it if they won't follow the truth then that actually makes them a cult because they call us a call or you're following a man you're following a false prophet and so forth right amen but if you don't follow the word of God and who God sends and you reject the truth you're actually Nicole and I'll tell you right right now when I think about Amish and so forth and at different churches you know you realize that's a lot of it's if it's not the truth it's truly brainwashing because I'm these folks I'll tell you they're we're raised so strict that well I'll tell you you believe that you got to be that way or you're going to be damned right and and so forth and and they truly believe that and look at no matter whether they're right or no matter how wrong they still have a great following look at the look at the group that's out there amen and you present that the truth to them and see what they do with it amen so you be the judge but it's a cult anything outside and you know I thought about this that actually it's it's not astounding people will follow all kinds of religions because if you won't follow the truth of God then you'll follow anything that satisfies you that's why you have the Amish and then you have the higher Amish and then you have people that have electricity and you have people that actually drive cars and you have you know on down on down on down you know on up all claiming to worship God they have all a perspective what Jesus is isn't that right they think that's how God is that's how Jesus is and how about the Pharisees and let me tell you something how many knows it's blindness blindness is what it is because uh uh anything outside of the truth truth is Blindness let me go to um Matthew Matthew 11 will begin with 11 and verse 25. and at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid thee things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes I mean notice that uh you know that unless God oh this is the other thing I thought about it this is all about what God does right and that's what your whole life is about it's about what God does in your life it's not so much about what you do it's about one either and when he reveals something to you just like he revealed to Peter right he said you know flesh and blood is not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven he has revealed this to you and what did he say the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it now I want to say this morning one of the reasons why revelation of God Amen is so important is because it's what the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against true Revelation amen true making no true making known of God now let's go a little bit back a little bit once again and think about it the Bible talks about the God's Eternal godhead I believe it's Romans 1 is understood by the things that are created so now we know that God manifested himself and shows himself in his creation all right Amen to us dog raisers we all know that one of the most amazing things is that when them little puppies come out when they come out of the bag God is absolutely giving them a instinct you don't have to help him there's nothing to have an instinct to go and find that teeth they will struggling person the first place they had for us that Mama T didn't know he got to get in there now you know that's just something that God has placed in there amen then you think about all of creation that God you can see God in all of creation tell you what you know like better man preacher Paradox and he talked about how that creation is and the Sun and the Moon and the and the tides that are held and everything about God's creation is a paradox it's all a miracle is that right I mean you know you can look at the animal kingdom and you realize we call the lion the king of the jungle I don't care if it's a giraffe them crazy Jokers will jump that giraffe if they get kicked to smithering they're just about afraid of nothing and they're called the king of the jungle that's why the Bible says that he's a lion of the tribe of Judah it was the type of his godhead that he is the supreme ruler amen when the lion roars every Beetle and Bug shuts up let me tell you how would you understand God is roared in this generation he has spoken and he has shut up every other voice God's voice the voice of God the word of God shuts every other voice oh my God that's why we're in the condition that we're in because people mix God's word up get their own ideas mixed up in the plan of God and it messes it up praise the Lord so you can you can just be amazed I'm gonna just go a little longer on that people love to go to the beach they love to go to the beach do you love to go to mountains and all of this and it's all it talk about uh I think I'll just read the scripture while I'm at it in other words they're enjoying God's creation they're enjoying God's glory because how many knows that's where God is God is in his creation amen that fisherman with a young boy that asked his teacher and Mom and Dad and pastor and can anybody see God but there's one fisherman he asked one time when tears were rolling can anybody see God my he says boy boy I'll tell you if that's all I have seen for the last 40 years is God amen when you see the Instinct of animals and all these things and the creation of these just see God like brother Brandon when he was out there and he heard the wolf calling to its mate the elf bugling to its mating all my evil Associates you I see you God I hear you God you're the one that made it all [Music] when I hear somebody worshiping saying praise be to God that was God made you that way he created us that way can you see God this morning can you hear God oh my God what a glorious thing now notice I was going to read this at the end but I'm gonna talk about uh you know God is gonna I know God is going to manifest himself God is going to reveal himself to the world one of these days you want to see how he's going to reveal it seeing it is a righteous this second Thessalonians 1 and verse 6. seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation on them that trouble you and to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed amen from heaven with his mighty angels inflaming fire taking Vengeance on them that know not God how many knows when the fire falls when this thing starts a cobble and wobble they're gonna know we got to come he's coming huh he's going to come in Vengeance taking Vengeance on them that no God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall be punished with Everlasting from the presence of the Lord number one and from the glory of his power huh so right now they're they're enjoying themselves in the glory of his power isn't that right all the pleasure to have on there all of that's going to be they're not going to be in any of the glory of God there'll be these uh they'll be suffering destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory the glory of his power when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints and to be admired in all them that believes he admired in all of them but on the other side he's going to make himself known he's going to remove himself to them from heaven with his mighty Angels taking fire amen I might as well say something else why it comes to mind talking about this you know how the world and how the the lefts so to speak and all of these people that are trying to have this green New Deal and green green energy and electric cars and save the ozone and you know don't destroy the world and so forth and don't pollute it we want to keep it all this way that way the other and folks how many knows in God's word says it's going to burn folks there ain't enough green deals ain't enough green energy or whatever that's ever going to stop this thing from completely burning to the ground huh God's word is already said it's going to happen to Heavens there's going to be on fire the elements shall melt with firm and heat I don't care how much we go to electric cars and don't try to put up in the film you're gonna burn anyway folks They Ain't Gonna Save nothing ah to God's word is already spoken it's going to happen and all the Sinners it's what's coming to destroy amen all my eyes that's right God they'll never stop the word of God will they okay praise the Lord so we want to start brother Madam says now he says we need in page 31 of church age but and I put a why there in front because that's what I want to speak on why we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world foreign why do we focus so much on that amen and then we'll get right down to the nitty-gritty after a while with the Lord we have accepted the Bible we have to accept that the great truths of it but still it is not real to most people I mean who knows that even though the Holy Spirit exists God exists amen Allah all the full power of God this is death but yet he's not real to most people right amen first of all so he says we need to pray for Revelation more than anything else in the world I want to talk about why that we do that now while he hides himself in simplicity and reveals himself in the same and so many people you know as the prophet of God says we are so smart we can create uh Cape Canaveral I guess down in Florida and we'll build these rockets that we takes the Geniuses to put together and we'll fly to the moon and we'll have the greatness step for mankind isn't that right and so forth the better man says you know we can fly what good is he gonna do when they get there they can do that but they can't tell you what makes a blade of grass grow oh can I say something they might be able to but they don't want to they don't want to say that it's God that makes that faith of God's law it is God that causes them trees to go down in the fall and brings them back in the winter I mean go down in the fall and come back in this Wednesday thank God but what is it it's God is great it's God that does it how many threatened God is all around he's around he's here he's there in your car when you drive he's everywhere God is there [Music] my all right let's see what Paul said about it Paul said about it in this situated and we're talking about the beginning of the creation and so forth we want to get into the world and things that has been hid and then made known because even in the Old Testament people didn't really understand God did they for eons of time people don't understand God I didn't I don't know about you but aren't you wanting to get to understand God more and more and more I do I want to get to understand him greater before I read this let's just go in the Old Testament would you take a little leap and we'll go back and forth but in the Old Testament he was what the father wasn't he he was the son in the New Testament and he was the Holy Ghost in the church dispensation in the Old Testament what did he say thou shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not and if you do you're gonna get punished if you disobeying media people are going to come and make slaves out of you and he boy he was a real father and no doubt but they looked at him as the great and terrible God that if he's touched foot on that mountain you've got to be struck that if you come in behind the Holy Soul you got me struck man you didn't know what a father and mother do a lot of times they say don't do this don't do that don't do this we got the big old paddler and then we had a we had one of them five gallon bucket paint sticks two of them taped together we wrote on their Soul Saver so every time the boys got a whooping they had a paddle on their backside that's so favorite amen oh boy Mike I mean Mike I guess kids won't have any kids but Mike is you know he gets here with me you've never treated us like that you'd have tore us up for that I'm like I'm a grand party they're girls they don't do anything wrong [Laughter] foreign that right the New Testament he came beside it was a different dispensation wasn't it he revealed himself now and he says I will have mercy go and study this as I will have mercy that's when he come he doesn't come to condemn the world he came to magnify the law he come and he had love for the world for God so loved the world begin to see the affection and the passion of almighty God and let me tell you something how many know did God Express himself perfectly in Jesus Christ if you want to know how God is and what he thinks like just going to marry she deserves to die but he said then I'll neither do I condemnity go and sin no more amen you could under understand we could see what he was like now but I'm going to ask how many notes of Pharisees could I see him no they couldn't really see him they were blinded and it's sad folks but even Paul said according to brother Branham when he read Darren Paul in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of those that believe not how many of us be able to see with your eyes but they can't see with their heart amen let me just go here and read this in Ephesians 3 Paul begins to explain how that things have been hit but now they're made open for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ to you for you gentiles if you have heard of the this compensation of grace of God which is given to me to you word how about by revelation by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery which I've wrote unto you in few words whereby when you read give me I understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is now revered amen that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partake because I mean his promise in Christ by the gospel well I made a minister according to the gift of grace of God given unto me by the effects of working of his power unto me who at least in the then who am less than the least huh that's down pretty far isn't it when you're less than the least Paul was humble wasn't he yeah he was the right reminder of the New Testament he really wasn't amen but he counted himself that because he persecuted the Church of God even not to death he was really really off he was wrong he was a rotten he said I'm the chief list of sinners amen laughs is this Grace given that I should preach among those Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ when you really think about how rich God was in Mercy For You and I when I think of the goodness of Jesus and all and for me then my soul Cries Out Hallelujah Glory when you think about how good God was we were Gentiles heathens we had no part but yet God brought us in if every race out there would realize that God has taken in all Races all colors amen oh everybody whomsoever will let him come he didn't say except this breed or this kind or discolor whosoever will let him come what Riches of his grace and what to make all come on and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the men history which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God another words he now makes known by the church the full wisdom of God how many that were closed God opened he and he gave us understand he said blessed is he that heareth the the writings of this book and so forth amen blessed are the people that understand what the Seven Stars were blessed are the people who understand what the seven golden candles things were who that man was in the midst of the seven colon candlesticks amen praise be to God how many knows it's been Christ through the church the whole way parinius Martin combo all of all the preachers down through all the ages that's cried out this message and here we are still 2023 preaching the same thing the same Grace the same love the same forgiveness the same marvelous unveiled God The Greatest Story Ever Told of Jesus Christ coming for you and me amen amen another scripture and Paul talked about this in different books but in Ephesians he seemed to describe it many more times Ephesians 1 and verse 15 it says where I also after I heard of your faith in Jesus Christ and love of all the saints cease not to give thanks for you make making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of glory be given to you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him and he believes that's what we need oh my oh no notice I want to say make this statement that you do not see with your eyes the Gospel of Jesus Christ you can't see Christ with your eyes it has to be the eyes Verse 18 the eyes of your understanding amen being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints amen seeing with the eyes of your understanding Matthew 13 and verse 13 it says therefore I speak unto them in Parables because they sing see not and hearing hear not amen remember Revelations is this blessed are they that hear the words of this prophecy let me tell you something you've got to send Malachi 4 to show and open that mystery when the Seven Angels Came Down in Arizona and said you go back to Jeffersonville because we're going to open up the revelation of the Seven Seals and when they say well you know we don't believe he's a prophet we don't believe he's a prophet huh how are you ever going to understand the things that are in there you're not going to get the blessedness of being able to hear what is in that book amen notice seeing is he not hearing here on neither do they under sand how many knows it's in understanding so many people are blind when you uh you know because the devil has blinds people people you know now you be careful watching the prophet watching watching following the man and so forth and uh you know it's a cult so when you go to telling them about brother Bannerman who got sent as a prophet and so forth automatically their eyes are already shut they oh boy this is what they told me to watch and they won't believe a word you say because they've already got the blinders on how many knows that it is only the grace of God that can open their eyes that can open anybody's eyes to the truth it takes God opening their eyes how many is glad to be able to see you you know it's about understanding thank you Lord Jesus for opening my eyes to be able to understand yes I understand I'm dealing with a person right now who has a prophet's message and different things like that but yet just can't see brother Benham as being a prophet and so forth I'm like well my question is you know if you'd have lived in the days of Noah would you have believed Noah's message if you'd have been the days of John the Baptist would you have gotten baptized under John it's baptism and believed that he was the Messiah that was not the Messiah but he was to introduce the first coming of Christ behold I send my message before my sure I believe I believe would you have been the follower of Paul when he said follow me as I followed by wrote the New Testament but if you can't believe when God sends a man today that it's equal if not more than any of them don't tell me you to believe them you wouldn't because the way you believe God today is how you to believe him back then I'm like you know but it takes God to Open the Eyes because it wasn't the problem that God could discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart and millions of times it's thus save the Lord folks I mean if we hadn't had thirsty of the Lord for many many years somebody could say that and that's not the saith brother Branham when he says that says the Lord It's thus saith the Lord but now if he says now this is just in my opinion this is the way I see it then that's just brother but I'm talking just like Paul he says this is my thought on it but here with thus saith the Lord and Jesus Christ coming into Discerning thoughts intents of the heart Time and Time and Time and Time and Time and Time Again and you can't see that that's the same thing remember Brother Band says God is identified by his characteristics in other words however he was yesterday that's if he does the same thing today you know that's God that's how you can see him but what did the Pentecost even the Pentecostals think about it couldn't see it there shouldn't be a Pentecostal message church out there this should all be message churches but they couldn't see it isn't it sad that's why the world is in the condition that it's in can I bring it down to a personal basis if you don't see Christ the way that you should you'll also also be in a bad place in a bad way if you don't see him the right way if you can't truly be hit but Paul says you're open now and we can say in our age now more than ever has it been made manifest and we know the duh a manifold wisdom of God we know the entire plan that he had how many knows that people people don't understand predestinate they don't understand even where Jesus said the world is a field you know and the children of the Wicked on Earth right and the children of God are the wheat he said that's enough of the devil eyes in The Prudent hit don't even show it to him but he has revealed it and to debate his children such as will learn amen I like that most most religions have a period behind what praise the Lord look at First Corinthians for a minute First Corinthians 2 and we'll read verse 6 on how be it we speak wisdom princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of God in the mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world oh unto our Glory amen how many knows he ordained this before the world ever began [Music] I'd like to just take a minute I just like the bask in that I just like a bask and the fact that God everything every job every till every blink of every person that will ever blink their eye to the last person all the way to the end of the world the Rapture the tribulation period a thousand years and over into the he knew everything before it ever started [Music] amen people that don't believe in predestination and the foreknowledge of God know this that he knew everything before it ever began [Applause] amen praise the Lord my my and then before I get excited let me tell you why I want to get excited and then when you see yourself and his on his side huh and you know that you are a child of God God is coming down to work in you what that does to you my makes me want to go under Evergreen for about a thousand years and raise my hand and think thank you Lord for saving my so thank you Lord for making my crazy mind whole thank you Lord for giving to me thy great salvation so rich and free amen you love him doesn't just make you love him more come to find out it's not just a god of Terror he's a god of love he has shed abroad his love in our hearts what a privileged people we are amen things are getting bad out there aren't they they're getting worse you know what I thought this morning I said to tell you talk to you tell y'all enjoy the good times that you have now because it's not going to get any better mother Troy read that about the persecution how that in the FBI have they've got it geared they're geared now to where they can make Christians criminals criminalize the Christians didn't brother bam say now there's a coming of persecution he said there's a comment of persecution on the Christians and uh I was thinking yesterday while I was doing my chores I thought you know the Bible says that it'll get such a persecution until you won't be able to buy or sell but you can't even go get gross they don't you won't even be able to get groceries or sell stuff you talk about overreach government overreach it's going to be serious government over they're going to tighten it all down so I'm I'm joined your enjoy your place enjoy everything you have because you don't know how long you're going to have it amen I'm telling you it's coming it's it's it's it's Brewing up the old ball is rolling and it's rolling fast because I was thinking you know Lord why are you taking so long and I thought I know why God's taking so long because it's going to be a big event when it does happen he gave Noah stays 120 years and I think of another two two years or so it'll be 120 years for us since 1909 since the prophet was born huh but God's long suffering he's not going to do it end it real quick because it's going to be catastrophic when he does it's going to be a terrible thing when he does and he's waiting on that last one to come in amen praise the Lord sobering isn't it to hear these things is sobering it's like wow I need a checkup and they need to make sure I'm ready to go here because they'll come after you hear amen they're weaponizing the government we know that all those things amen anyway that's cool on here for a few minutes praise God my revelation God revealing himself makes all the difference in the World to You and I a person can pray and pray and pray and repent and repent and repent but until God comes down and does the work in that life huh how many knows that we know him we he has revealed himself to you no doubt each one of us as a savior isn't that right to save you from your sins to forgive you of your sins we know him as your filler your uh filling you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost isn't it something that in our generation amen he took a prophet God to go back there amen and show us and reveal to us that the great God of all God the the great great God of all creation that in him was to be a father better in him was to be a savior in him was to be a deliverer in him was to be a guide in him was to be a warrior all these great things that God was and he wanted to express himself oh let me say this this morning what enthuses and what does something to you or does something to me is when God reveals himself to you on a daily basis how many knows that's why you pray that's why you seek God they that come to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him God puts that something in you to seek him and then he shows himself to you amen sister and I guess he's not in here but she says you know her knee is much better Glory now you know him as a Healer let me tell you I had Disney was hurting me so bad at the same time and I got prayed for and the next day it wasn't twice as bad at the day before what I got prayed for her it was always limping everywhere I thought you lying symptom you lie every everybody go ahead you lying symptom and today you know I'm Healed amen working this morning I know him as a Healer he shows himself as a Healer but he gets you through all your troubles and you come on the other side you know him as a deliverer but it was revealed to David when he slew that lion I don't imagine that he just said well you know it's kind of nice to see that lying dead I imagine he had a lion running around the line all right God delivered him into my hands he is my deliverer great big old bear comes big old teeth the claws you know and I don't know just how he killed him but he killed that bear and he had another Jubilee thank you God for delivering that bear into my hand he wasn't so hard for David to believe when he got that inspiration got down into the Philistines come to the Israel bringing his mother's dinners and then he looked up at that big old giant and says you know I even see defying the armies of the Living God and so forth something struck in David's heart why that measly little measly guy up there he don't look half as bad as the lion did he doesn't look as bad as that bear did these uncircumcised fallacy can you imagine today what's wrong with you guys little bitty little bitty fella huh you know what how can you let him Define it yeah it says I'll do it I'll take him on why because he had experience God had showed himself to him what makes you strong spiritually what gives you faith in God tribulation Works patience let patience have a perfect work that you may be entire lacking nothing when you are patient on God Amen they can't get over somebody can't go under can't go around and God take you to say that's God God shows me that he's my deliverer I don't care what your situation is trust God and say get on your knees and say God I need the Revelation for that she saw me trying to how wonderful how great you are all right don't you think that's exact ly exactly what they did on the brother man says under when the ears will come down to the Red Sea he says you know he will God wanted to show them how great he was huh and he still delivered them even though they were a bunch of wimps cry babies complainers all right he got tired of it though didn't he he got tired of it after a while they never would believe isn't that right how many knows that whenever they descend out the spies over there and they came back and gave a bad report that was the last talk Israel and Katie spania and God says that's it these tens have they've been have I tried them and proved them these 10 times they have not believed me they took them back into the Wilderness for 40 years till that generation died off and their children got to go in who wants the parents for once they said they wouldn't go in and so forth he got tired of it I wonder if God don't get tired of our complaining our mermaid think about it we're so prone to take things in our own hands isn't that right to deal with things in a carnal level now we need to give it to God oh I'm a preacher that has witnessed this and seen this that when you don't trust God don't give it to God you will be in chaos he'll never be blessed [Music] never give it to God folks you love the Lord tonight I'm so glad folks that we have a a deliverer who he understood we had that's why Revelation is so important people haven't had a revelation for why they say pray for Revelation Martin for God to reveal himself to show himself to you every one of us could raise her and that's what I want more of I want to I want God to show himself Mighty like he did with brother Benham when he was wandering in that woods and he but thought that he was a guy and he can find his way he can find his way hey man he was going round and round and round until he got on his knees he says I'm lost God I am no God I need you and God manifested himself revealed himself and opened up that fog and pushed it back so he could see the lifeline over there that took him right down to the cabin just grab all of that life while I'm going down that's what we did this morning I mean no matter where you are what you are amen grab a hold of that lifeline let it gentle lead you right into a body chain I don't know about you but I'm looking for God to be my body snatcher I want him to snatch me right hey man I'm Gonna Leave This World one of these days when I'm changing the moment and a twinkling of an eye believing God's gonna do that he's going to reveal yourself himself as our Rapture person the one that comes and steals us away I wanted me to reveal himself to me as the person amen the great God that he's gonna make me ready have me ready for that great Rapture that lays ahead just any Dina oh he's gonna come for people that are ready don't you want to be in that church that's without spots blameless that is coming without fall and blameless Peter's head get me ready Lord show yourself to me Lord reveal yourself to me more Lord in other words let me see you more in my Every Day Life why we need to pray for more revelation God reveal yourself more brother Branham got in that field that great big killer bull that had in that field because he had killed a black man and he was out in the middle of nowhere there was no trees that bull raised up stomped his feet blowed his nose and snored it I can imagine maybe on a wintery day the big old Billows of white smoke big mean looking thing and he come looked at him he put his head down and stopped here I come brother man says God help me to die don't let me be a coward if this is I'm supposed to go don't let me die a coward he says something come down over him that love God the Great deliver is that right he said he had no more fear than anything he says you go back lay down I'm going to pray for somebody else over here you're God's bull you're God's God's creation I need you to go back and lay down where you come from is that right he knew God as a deliverer the Hornets from a deliverer the maniac that come up isn't that right he didn't say hey policeman hey Deacon board hey y'all come on up here tackle this guy huh can you imagine a bunch of stout men in the church could probably tackled him but he says no he's just come up and he talked to him all right what did he do what did Brother Branham think now this is some mama's boy is that right this is some mama's boy that is loved by his family and so forth you know had compassion on him loved him and he said man I'll tell you what you know I'm Gonna Knock You Plum out into this out of the other and holy spirit says because you've challenged the spirit of God you're going to fall up my feet and he did he knew God as his deliverer he had done busted up some preachers jaws and puts put him in the hospital and everything else amen foreign that's when God comes young people don't you want to know God more you want to see God in your life trust him put your complete faith in him say Lord and pray say God reveal yourself to me show yourself to me Lord I want to see more I want to see more of you Lord I want to see less of me I mean he's with me I'll see less of me and I want to see more of him amen that's the true revelation foreign true revelation how am I remember that revelation the reality of Christ in your life is what gives you prevailing power over the enemy amen as I have already said This Book of Revelation is the consummation of the Scripture it is even placed exactly right into Canon of scripture at the end now you can know why it says that Anyone who reads it or even hears it is blessed it is the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil I mean please it's the reality of Christ in you is what gives you power over the devil you certainly aren't going to have power over the devil if you don't aren't Spirit-filled are you with me if you're not prayed out and filled with the Holy Ghost you're not going to have power over today amen you can see why they who would add or take away would be cursed it would have been have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy it's that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as revelation of the word of God that's what David trusted he absolutely relied on God's ability and for God to come and to guide his stone for the Goliath just like he did with the bear and just like he did with the lion us older folks should be settled in knowing that when you have problems that arise that you need to give it to the Lord that you need to trust God in it amen because time and time again I'm a witness time and time again God has delivered me I I trust others are time and time again he has showed himself as your great deliverer he has showed you as his healer still rejoicing because I can see you I gotta wear glasses to see you this morning y'all remember when I had to have 300 just to see y'all I couldn't decide which pair of glasses to put on it went way up and then it came back down I wore every number in Walmart [Laughter] oh my praise the Lord God is good how many knows he's gonna heal your body one of these days he's gonna change this body oh my we're here this morning letting him get us ready yielding I surrender all yielding to him you know I was thinking the other day on a message of surrender and the power of surrender what a wonderful a thing it is to be completely surrendered to Christ there's no better place to be than to be completely surrendered to Christ there's no safer place to be than completely surrendered to Christ Our Trouble Comes is when those areas are alive that's not surrendered yet how many knows that that's our problems right there how many want
