wasn't it amen from winter to spring thank you musicians amen praise the lord amen so this evening if you will open your bibles with me or get your bibles we'll have a word of prayer before we go into the word let's bow our heads kind heavenly father we come before you once again lord jesus thankful lord to be able to assemble ourselves together lord jesus with like believers knowing god that here you are in our midst as your word has promised that you always would be with us even until the end and we pray father that as we speak on the subject we feel like you've laid upon our heart that you would just have your way in everything that is said and done may your name be glorified and magnified we also ask god for a special prayer for brother how god would just continue to raise him up lord jesus and lord give him strength in his body father and in his spirit and his soul lord jesus we commit ourselves to you lord ask god that you'd be with all of those that view over the internet and so forth bless every heart lord and speak to those out there as well as here we ask your blessing upon the service now as we committed to you in jesus name amen and amen amen i want to speak on something that's pretty familiar amen to us so if you will turn to revelations the first chapter revelations one amen i like that song david saying i am determined to hold out to the end amen i like that so now revelations the first chapter verse 7 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall well because of him even so amen i am the alpha and omega the beginning and the ending amen hebrews 11. hebrews 11 verse 1. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen may god is blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated tonight amen jesus said that he was the beginning and the ending amen so tonight i just want to take the thought of uh just to title it the end the end amen another scripture comes to me that i might go ahead and read just for a little foundation probably won't touch too much on it but over in matthew 13 verse 36 jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house house and the disciples came unto him saying declare us and declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest now notice the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels therefore as the tears are gathered together and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of the world amen so that's what we're going to focus on is the end but we want to deal a little bit with the help of the lord on how about how that the end comes about and basically this subject tonight they want to speak for just a little while i mean it's going to have to do with how that the prophet of god preached a message he called it the world falling apart how the world was falling apart we realized that was way back in the 60s maybe this maybe even a time or two in the 50s that he mentioned it so long ago that he preached on something called the world that it's falling apart now one reason i re read that in hebrews we'll pick that up hebrews there it talks about how that uh how that the the that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear amen you go back to genesis 1 you can find where it says you know in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and we know that that he created it by speaking the word of god amen and so god's word amen just uh you know whether it's this body here whether it's what you're standing on whether you're sitting everything that you see that's material was at one time not material in other words it was gasses and right now right gases it went back to different things that's even invisible in other words he made things from things that were not seen and so it comes from the invisible and so forth and he speaks those all of those chemicals and the different things that actually create something and he made them things come together so we find out that whenever god says something it it begins to frame it begins to frame things together it begins to hold things together it begins to make things it molds things it shapes things it and it and it brings a structure to things everything about god's word brings structure now remember this that satan absolutely his whole objective is to destroy whatever god has created whatever god has made his business is to tear it apart to take that frame and tear it apart it doesn't matter what it is amen and the way i come to thinking about this i got to thinking about where we're at in the world we look at where we're at the world we realize that where we're at in the world is at the end right we're at the end how many times the prophecy we're at the end we're at the end is that right and so we know that we're living in the end time in other words we're in the time of the end doesn't matter what it is and and you know in this you know many stories many books and many different things uh you might have a good story you might have a good book that you read that has a happy ending and all right a good ending you know but we know but for this world for uh those who are left in this world the end is not going to be a happy ending ah there's going to be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth now now if you'll notice here i don't know if i even finished that scripture in matthew but he talked about how that you know the tares are to be gathered together and to be burned in the fire so shall the end of this world be so we know that the end of this world has got a fire amen that is waiting for them but now we know that for the believer amen for the christian that's not our story aren't you glad for it i'm glad that that's not our story because if we would look for amen if we were looking here amen just for what's going to happen here like in peter i believe it was i'll just go ahead and read that quick over and peter it talks about how that the heavens and the earth which are now let me go back a little bit because i want to pull one subtle thought here notice here um in verse [Music] 5 of chapter 3 ii peter it says and this they are willingly ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old amen now i'm going to jump down before we read the rest of that verse verse 7 it says and but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store right so it talks about they're ignorant that by the word of god the heavens and the earth was of old in other words the very word that created the heavens and the earth in the first place that same word is still holding the present time world together but it's reserved unto fire i mean believes it's still held together the universe is saw everything is still held together by the word of god praise the lord and so it says the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and into water whereby the world that then was being overflight with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved until against the god a day of judgment and condition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord is a thousand years and a thousand years is one day the lord is not conscious is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but his long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night when which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise amen and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing that that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought to ought to be in all holy conversation and godliness amen looking looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat and i like this next part because what i was saying is this what i just now read is what the majority of the people of the world has to look forward to and this is what they are looking for and we also know that it is coming but this next verse i really like because nevertheless we amen and this is not our final destination this is not our goal it had to get burned up with uh unquenchable fire we're not part of the terrors that are being bundled together and burnt is that right but it says nevertheless we according to his promise look for what a new heavens and a new earth were indwelleth righteousness how many believes that when you get over there when we get over there in the new heavens and the new earth amen there's going to be birds flying through the air amen it's going to be beautiful there's going to be evergreen trees and man it's going to be a absolute paradise there'll be never never any feebleness of old age there's not going to be any pains no there's not going to be any kind of weakness whatsoever it'll be perfect and i got to thinking about when i read that scripture about him in the heavens and the earth that we're looking for because even in the last few days if y'all probably at your house also you probably found a lot of dead birds anybody find dead birds i would sit by my water trough and my feeding truffle for the animals and there'd be a dove and sitting there still alive and i just went right over there and just wrapped it picked it right up it was still alive took it in the house for about 20 minutes 30 minute well it was more than that i guess a couple hours kept it in there and warmed it up really good amen and then we let it go and it flew enough you know and then we found many of them and then if we let it fly and fly out under a trailer and before night i said well i better go get that bird i don't think it'll survive sure enough it didn't because i didn't go get it but anyway then days later we found a dead bird over here we'd find dead birds there just and i thought man you know it's not going to be any of that over there i'm glad that there's not going to be any death no pain no sorrow over there amen so we look for heavens and a new earth amen not just for the destruction of this world now let's get back on our subject what really brought me to this was thinking about how that you know the present time in our politics and i don't ever preach on politics trying to give anybody hope we know that's not the case but we can certainly look at our politics we can look at what's going with our politics in our world and see kind of you know it can kind of give us a a little sign of where we're at isn't that right to see just where we're at spiritually where the church is where we are in time and then i got to thinking about how that you know it's they're having a hard time getting the teachers to go back to school to open up even though the science is there finally said hey go open up it's okay you know right even though they have the okay they still really don't want to do it i thought about i thought about that i thought why won't people want to go back and i thought about what brother branham said he says you know education he says that even it is at its end and i got to thinking about the end this is how i come across my subject thinking about how that it's the end of these things the end of things all right so let me just read this quote brother ben he says listen education is at the end juvenile delinquency is at the end and so forth children he says there's no hopes for children anymore they're done going insane and you can't hardly have no education you can't hardly go down here at the school and have a kid to get with an education he said because he's twofold more a child of hell when he comes out then when he goes in think about when this was way back in 58 i believe it was amen listen to what he says he says we lost about 2 000 teachers or 20 000 teachers last year i don't blame them i wouldn't want to do their job either so you teachers i'm sure you've got a rough job no notice he says and give him that we got signs of give college kids education sure they need it i mean those we give them a education we give them all the money for an education they got their education and now they're ready to start their life with a bill of 100 200 000. i don't know about you but i'd start out depressed when you i gotta go to mcdonald's you know and make i can't pay for this you know now we're talking about figure forgiving their debt and all this other stuff and what's real smart of us to get him in that kind of debt the first place and i wasn't but anyway that's besides the point but listen she talks about give them an education they need it but the devil's got him the devil's got our kids he says man it used to be that they just go out there and do something on halloween night this that or the other to be mean or whatever but now they've gone completely insane they'll shoot you they'll kill you how true that is today isn't that the truth of our you know because it's you know things are just coming to an end they're insane that's right oh my poison you are anything and brother bam says and that's the next generation he mentions politics he says boy it doesn't matter if it's republican democrat what it is he says it is rotten to the car it's at its end politics he says is at the end dictators is wrong politics is wrong oh my he says why didn't they stay with a godly king like god get like that god gave david or something you know the great lord of england said when this democracy was formed i guess america said it's all right now but it'll come time he said that it'll be nothing he says it'll be all sales and no anchor how many believes that's a prophecy that was not king of england he knew exactly what he was talking about that's brother man says that's exactly right and you and i are living in that hour where constitution don't mean anything it's just all sales this is go let's just go you know and no anchor amen so we're living in the end of politics the end of the world end of time any close to how many believers are getting close to where it says and even time shall be no more amen so we're living at the end of things you know and he says dictatorships and so forth listen to what he says now juvenile parents uh brother bam he says he mentioned everything in another internet um he says you know and we find out that there's not too much history that should gets even written because i don't think it'll ever be used both of these great events are running in a shallow water that's right we're running in a national crisis national security all of that is running into shallow waters our lord predicted such a time to come that there be unrest among nations perplex of time distress between the nations we've tried everything seemingly human battle to make it just a little bit longer but it is running out he says home life is running out marriages is running out you can't hardly have marriages anymore ain't nobody believes in sticking together until the end till death do you part it's until the next problem do you part now right just every little whim just little this out of the other but used to be dead have to work things out but now and they've got that then they don't even marry anymore people don't even marry anymore amen oh my but everything is at an end but the battle says child bearings at an end womanhood is at an end why they'll practice birth control and they don't want any kids they want little dogs the little dogs have taken their place amen how many of the dog business is good that's right people like people love dogs but they don't want to raise a child to the nur to god amen so just look at it i mean i'm wrong with having a dog but listen amen people don't want kids anymore people don't want to have a home anymore amen oh my so he also said you know that uh you know it used to be he can remember the time he says he ain't all that old yet but he says he remembers the time amen people used to have church when we have church my sisters and different ones people walk yeah praise the lord tears coming down their eyes you know and there was under such power the holy ghost amen they have an altar call and boy they get to pray and one of their children perhaps come up there and pray amen them sisters they come on day pray with that person until they come through and god some you don't see that anymore church entity he says even church is coming to an end he says the formal church is coming to an end because everything has come into it and i thought well that ain't nothing but the truth look at the church world out there how it's come all the way down to heaven homosexual preachers i mean you can't get in the word than that and it reminded me of this this is what i thought about when i began to think about the end and what brings about the end because you know if and that is it's going to be what we call a moral fabric and i think about a fabric a moral fabric and once people lose their morality amen they just about lose everything and if you remember brother bam talked about he says when they used to control what kind of songs that people would listen to and it wouldn't be nice to think about they used to control what kind of a song or the radio because that place they could say could play and he says that they come out something about an immoral uh song about the girls rolling down the little leagues or something just a little something don't seem much but that was the beginning of it they let that slip through and then all of a sudden it got worse and worse and worse and look where it is today and you know the way that things come to an end the way that things come apart amen amen it doesn't matter what it is and you don't realize that coming to church on this wednesday night is part of the structure that holds your life together god is what holds your life together the word of god is what holds your life together because get away from it for a minute and then get away from it a little bit to find out how much amen you begin to fall apart even jesus says abiding me and my word inviting you otherwise you're going to wither away is that right otherwise you're going to wither away think about all the people even around this message says i've absolutely just withered away even jesus said there become many come that fall by the wayside amen but it's got to be more there's got to be something that happens down on the inside here amen that causes you not to come apart amen i believe but the baby says that you can the church book i believe it was he talked about he says whether it's rome whether it was greece or whatever it was he says that he can take you back and he can show you that a woman was the cause of the fall of all of it of every nation a woman and when you think about what the pornography and the lust and the pollution that this nation allow think of how that it demoralizes our men it demoralizes our kids it demoralizes the whole world and then it absolutely kills them so to speak and then it's like you can see how it's a downfall how many know even eve was the downfall of the whole world it's an instrument that the devil uses amen but think about the morality everything that is has been torn down whether it's families amen family says it's torn down nation that it's been torn down all these different things that's come apart and then it reminded me that it used to be that this nation was a pretty good nation i mean because we had we still had morality you know right we still had even the sinners we still had so much of god but we weren't the sinners that we are now today because i know that even brother bam said that it was because that the churches didn't hold their standard that the floods came on in because if every church hello if every church would hold their standard it'd be a different story but they haven't but so we think about that we think about i think about a piece of cloth i don't know if anybody any of y'all have ever bought a new shirt or a new blouse or a new disc that or the other and you got a little pick in it you got a little something in it right and then you try to you know or you have a loose thread or something and you go to pull them on that and did you ever watch that thing just go right through all of that line just goes way down you're like ruined right it's all messed up just from that little pig and then when you have let's say you have like an along with a zipper or something like that your seam and then you get a thread that is loose and you go to pull on that thread out and all of a sudden just comes right apart well that's exactly what's happened with a nation that's what happened with church that's what happens with an individual when satan comes in there and he picks that thread apart that god has put together how many knows god had the whole world together he had adam and eve in a garden of eden in perfect life but satan come and got a little pick on eve he just messed one little thread up isn't that right he got one little place that he got in and it spiraled and messed the whole thing up all of creation went down with it amen and i'll tell you what you know every all of those is put together in such a way that you keep too many of those threads out and it's just a pile of junk and that's the way it is in our life that's the way it has been church life it's been in this nation amen a little pig a little threat and the fabric of society has absolutely completely come apart not by some great thing but just by one little thing how many knows for you to lose your relationship with the lord and for you to backslide and for you to get cold on god and for you to lose the holy ghost it just takes one little thing brother bam says perhaps a temper lose your temper one time how many kept the holy ghost even right after your temper don't raise your hand because i beg to differ with you amen the second that you choose to lose your temper huh you kind of have to choose that am i going to lose my temper i'm gonna keep my cool and it might it might just trigger quick it doesn't take much you know but the second you lose your temper the holy ghost is gone that's why the wrath of man the bible says never works the righteousness of god but the thing of it is and that begins what is it if you don't make that right it begins to unravel i mean there's a fuss between a husband and wife if you don't make that right it'll keep unraveling the devil loves to get between a husband and wife between a brother and a sister how many knows that's why we have so much family problems is because they get away from the word of god they get away from the love of god amen i mean believes that god is in a restoring business restoring families he doesn't want us to end up aiming our families for torn apart he don't want friendships tore apart he don't want a church tore apart he don't want all these things lost and frazzled and coming apart at the seams people can't come apart at the seams when they get away from prayer you don't realize how important prayer and reading your bible is i watched a little documentary on the welsh revival and the 1909 revival the azusa street revival and they got to talking about some of these men that became evangelists and so forth that they would pray for three hours a day and then they would really dedicate themselves to six to seven hours a day to pray hello and i thought wow what kind of christian am i where am i at i got 10 15 minutes they were four or fives how did they stay there that long just but they would and then he got to talking about he says you know you could tell you know it used to be on a wednesday night they said that man it wasn't hard for people to stand outside and man come together on a wednesday night even but if they ain't on too much fire he says it's hard to get people out on the wednesday night huh but the revival i'd like something else i said you know revival is not something you work up a revival is something that has to come down from above and i like what he said this is one of the things he said that i really like he says you know what brings it the only thing he can know that really brings it is somebody that's completely surrendered to god a complete surrender to god will bring a revival how many believes that you want a revival in your life completely surrender to god you just say well that's easy no not so much how about giving him seven eight hours a day surrender that much to him find out what happened that's right tell your boss hey can i have off tomorrow i would like to pray all day huh are you more worried about making money see now i asked myself how surrender am i really you look at how surrendered those folks were back there that really got a hold of god and god began to do something and did great miracles and all of these revivals a revival with the holy spirit the anointing when he comes down and that's what makes a difference amen amen he says they showed a whole picture of a whole isle of crutches where people were healed amen the power of god come down how many like to see that that's right but see god is in the business of keeping things together keeping the fabric of your life your very being together how many know that eve had to taste death adam had to taste death because they let that little fabric that nick and that pick in their life amen to completely ruin the picture amen just that little bit and it took them all the way to where they were and here we are at the end of the world not just this nation i mean knows that england is as bad as we are italy and france they had their revival way back right and they turned down their revival and they became wicked and it went from italy i believe it was landed in hollywood and from hollywood it spread all across our nation hello but nevertheless aren't you glad that in this evil age that we're living in it is time of the end of everything it's really not in other words it just can't go on much longer how many knows it just can't go on much longer there's only one thing to do and that is to be ready for the coming of the lord praise the lord that's what i'm looking for and we look first of all i got to thinking about this and it says well lord if truly if it's your word if it's god's word if it's god's presence that keeps your life together it keeps your marriage together it keeps you together as a person huh because you can't live in condemnation you can't live in sin and be complete you'll have all kinds of inferior complexes in other words you know you're not right you're not going to be happy somebody else don't treat you just right yeah you're going to really let them know huh and so you're going to be short with people you're going to have falling outs with people [Music] falling out with your wife your husband your neighbor your dog ain't no telling who you're gonna kick that's right because you get away from god amen your wife is gonna be make you happy anymore your husband's not good enough for you anymore amen the church ain't good enough god ain't good well you just get it gets way out of there is that right on and on but the sweetness of the holy spirit notice what what the prophet brought us notice what the bible gives us amen in first peter i believe it is the first chapter it talks about how that you're to add to your faith virtue and add to virtue knowledge in other words begin to allow those threads the only one that can bring them threads back together and fix that shirt fix that piece of cloth fix that fabric to bring those things back together is the holy spirit the only thing that brings family back together is the holy spirit the only thing that can bring a church back together is the holy spirit individuals back together it's the holy spirit it's god it's his word it holds it all together and you get away from that it all falls apart remember when jesus left mary's house trouble set in lazarus got sick and died and he brother brad amused the illustration he says when jesus leaves your house trouble sets in troubles on the road when you leave christ when he leaves your house amen and that's exactly what god has done with us as a nation because we couldn't have been i believe if i'm not wrong we were the greatest nation in one of the some of the history of the world huh of the history of the world one of the greatest nations parallel with israel that couldn't be defeated huh but we were in respect to god we honored god that right and when we begin to dishonor god get away from god god left us you know isn't it something how that we're supposed to have all these missiles we're supposed to have all this defense but it don't mean a thing they're going to get through they're going to get through and even brother bam says talking about war he says we used to take uh what did he how did he use it we used to beat one another over the head with stone axes he said stone axes which sharpen big old stones we tie it to a stick and we go to war huh that's how we used to do it he says and then they shot bows and arrows and then right then they got rifles then they got machine guns and they're 88's how many knows our tanks didn't stand a chance against their 88s they gave us a rough way to go that's right then they throwed hand grenades and poison gas but now they got a hydrogen bomb and now guess what you can't have war anymore how many knows how many times have we went to russia and fought with russia never in their home time was always over in some other country where they didn't have any nukes because you can't fight war when people people's got nukes because it's totally annihilation but says you can't have war anymore because now the whole thing would be blow to pieces and he says and it'll take just one trigger from one of those little nations that have it to start the whole thing and he said it could be all within three minutes or so he says if the whole world could end in just about that time it's all begun but aren't you glad to know the one that is the beginning and the end remember this when noah's world ended god had his hand in it when sodom and gomorrah when they ended god had his hand in it and i'll tell you this god's going to have his hand in the end of this world amen just when they mean they're not going to do it until god allows it to happen just how it'll be i don't know but i do know that it's going to burn with fervent heat but not for you and me from you and me i truly believe that god is not you know for us education uh you know family is not an end for us church is not an it's not an end for us why because we still love the lord the holy spirit is still here because i'll tell you this once the holy spirit leaves you're gone it's all over when the holy spirit leaves and for the world it's going to be all over with when the holy spirit because god's going to take that blood out from around the world he'll look at the sin and he'll say i gotta clean this up this is too dirty to be in my presence but you know look as god god is working on each other a bride in the end time he believes that we're a part of that he's framing a church together and body together the bible talks in ephesians he says every joint fitly framed together works and is built up for a habitation of god god builds you together i mean he gets rid of all that loose things he gets rid of the world he gets rid of sin he gets rid of unbelief he gets it all out of there and he makes you strong he gives you love for your your neighbor love for your uh makes you love everybody how many knows that the one thing that really brings us together and then frames things together and it doesn't call it cause it to fall apart because the world is falling apart everything's falling apart but not not everything the people of god are not falling apart and one of the one of the main things that you got to have even as a christian amen that binds it all together and if you go back and listen to the message amen uh the statue of a perfect man he talks about faith god wants you to have faith he wants to have strength he brings gives you strength amen inner strength virtue went from jesus strength went from jesus let me just say something here if you don't think that the holy spirit actually makes you stronger it makes you feel better it gives you strength not just physical but also spirituals it gives you strength because without that spirit you're just a bunch of muscle a bunch of meat it's all really yard just dead meat but he wants you to have virtue want you to have strength he builds knowledge in you in order to know what's right and what's wrong isn't that right right godly knowledge to know the difference between right and wrong temperance amid temperance we're to be tempered by the holy spirit and that patience of course amen that's something we all probably need more of patience to wait on the lord because god's never in a hurry we're always the ones in the hurry dave abraham had to wait 25 years for his promise if you ask for something just believe god's gonna do it wait amen and listen if you believe that many of you're ever going to get healed amen folks i'm telling you i've had these things hit me here in the knee and i thought man it ain't never going to go away and hurt for weeks and weeks and weeks but i believe by his stripes i heal and it went away i've had a lot of things come and just believe the lord and go act like it ain't even hurting no more it ain't even there brother man says just believe it and watch out god will take care of it but if you always say oh it didn't happen no you done lost it probably already you know no i still feel it now no go on as though it's done already and i be patient on the lord then godliness you're coming up and you're looking a whole lot like jesus did and that right and one of the last things that people forget to do and that is just to be friendly how many knows the holy ghost will make a gentleman out of you he'll make a real lady out of you because let's admit it how many remembers there's uh the hatfields and mccoys we're all we are all the hatfields and the mccoys oh yeah we're we're well i was so bad i was terrible i robbed banks you know on this side or the other and i was the sheriff that shot y'all you know and i was a bad white or everybody was bad you know but really when you was in your old flesh it wasn't worth much at all you were without god your life began to come together is when according to peter there he says we have been born not by the will of the flesh but by the word of god when you're born again then you become a man back then it was just terrible you i i acted terrible when i was in the world i didn't have more responsibility i would run my tags out and never pay hardly for a year i only got insurance because you'd go to jail almost if you didn't negligent i don't want to go on further i ain't going to tell you i am more of my fault but i you know it's terrible not until you received the baptism of the holy ghost did you begin to have more respect more more more more about you amen that's what god's doing how many believes that it'll make a man out of you it'll make you sweet and kind where you as terrible before and that's what god's doing folks building it together getting the threads of your family to getting the threads of your friendship friendships hello and brothers and sisters and love now what i'm getting to i'm still getting to some notice how it says the brotherly love brotherly kindness the holy spirit is in between but the capstone of it all and brother bam talked about how that the holy spirit and the love of god is what welds it all together how many believes that love covers a multitude of sin love welds it all together the devil has got that got this to where it's all fallen apart i completely demolished homes marriages churches nations individuals hate the devil just totally demolishes but god and the love of god amen it brings us together over new york they used to say man people will go down the street and there'll be somebody laying cars maybe going by and splash monitor over him you know he's just there you know nobody'll have the courtesy to drag that man up against the building away from the old messy road er people won't help each other up there huh i've heard that i've heard they don't help him brother brown i don't know if you come from there you could probably tell us a story or two but people don't have no compassion for each other anymore but what does love do love brings and it reaches out and brings people together it reaches out and helps one another it gives them a helping hand it does things for you it'll make you shake your brother's hand it'll make you love amen those who are unlovely it brings it together and it welds it together because that's what god does amen praise the lord how many needs more the love of god i don't know about you but i need more of that holy spirit i need more time i need more time with god it may just bask in that presence of god and allow it to mold and shape me and bring my life together because i'm here to tell you even your mind will stray even your mind will will go this way and that way if you don't stay in the holy spirit amen you'll get too busy to think about the things of the world and the cares of this world do you realize the bible says all that did we live all the delicacies that the antichrist system men he says a whole world partook of the delicacies of the antichrist we're living the world all kinds of delicacies and people are taking a part of more of the delicacies than they are the word of god amen but i don't know about you but i just want my mind i want my heart on my soul i want god to bring everything together hold me together hold my family together hold my grandchildren together amen to keep it together not let it fall apart because if the whole world which it has already fallen apart and it's come to an end but there's a group of people that's getting ready amen getting ready to leave let me finish with the quote we won't keep you long i say this in closing there's one more remark i want to make he's just a real church has so much to live for now amen but it looks like there's just nothing to live for there isn't down here for the world this is their climax this is the climax for the world how many knows that a lot of states are talking about legalizing all drugs they went from whispering about legalizing marijuana right now all drugs all sales no anger no right why because satan's eating he wants to do whatever he wants whatever he wants that's what he wants to do and that's the world but listen while this is the climax this is the climax of satan's eden it's really the hardest time and the lowest time as far as you and i in this world because what we don't fit in here i believe we don't fit in here we don't belong here well aren't you glad there's not going to be all this perversion there's not going to be all this sin over on the other side all that will be gone no sickness no death no sin no unbelief all the unbelievers will be far away all the skeptics will be absent on that day for you and me it's the rising of the sun it's good morning shalom for you and me after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory i mean believes that happened in our day the whole earth india south africa america jeffersonville the whole earth was lightened with the glory and power of almighty god god used the prophet of god so much until those who were around him the things that happened in the supernatural that happened they can't quit talking about it phenomenal beyond imagination things happen here and there and god just did the supernatural unlike he has done for ages and that right how many truckloads of constant stretchers was it i forget how many truckloads all kinds of truck boats going through town right through downtown and they were all and the whole city 500 000 the whole city shut down and they were marching down things singing only believe only believe all things are possible the whole earth was lightened with the power and glory of a god just before the destruction before the end of all these things god came down and lightened the earth with his glory let him know let the whole world that know that yes god is real yes god is a life amen and he cried with a mighty and strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and it's become the habitation of devils and hold of every foul spirit in the cage of every unclean and hateful bird amen that's right where things used to hold together now it's fallen apart amen so he says oh listen we got so much to live for now it should be such a jubilant time for the real church for the true church for the elected church for when you know in your heart you've passed from death unto life when you can look at yourself and see and watch your life and see that the things of the world has passed away and you become a new creature oh my listen close he says you know you've passed from death to life your life proves it for by their fruits you shall know them your whole objective is christ you're looking for him to come at any minute you walk in the spirit you love him you see him working through you nothing that you desire to do but he just does it himself what a time how many believes we are to grind most privileged people on earth to have the revelation that it's christ in you the hope of glory i trust everybody here tonight has jesus christ living in your heart and he is the one that's doing it whatever gets done he works through your life what a hope god bless you let's stand this evening musicians if you'll come let's bow our heads go before the lord i wonder tonight if there's

my husband's a christian and the husband should be able to look at the wife and say my wife's a christian lord jesus others should see it in us and our closest relations is the ones that look at us and see us the closest father i pray tonight lord if our brothers and our sisters they look at each other lord we are to be able to see christ in each other and our hearts desire tonight this
