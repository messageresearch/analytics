TRANSCRIPT
========================================
was made up here out of one out of a million I want an honor that is but outside of the second birth the first the first verse is nothing but of course it had really been better if it wasn't born the first time if you ain't born again the second time so when you think about what God has done for doing oh yes it's in your heart hey man you wanna love him and serve him and worship him and then he started something in there it causes you to bless the Lord amen I thought about titling this according to the song we want to sing at the end of service 10 000 reasons for my heart to sing ten thousand reasons to bless a lot my I wish I had that was just at the brains it's just to tell all of the all about ten thousands but I just mentioned a few things we Rejoice over those few things Zoe he choses you the first time he chose you the second time he gave me the new birth he gave me the desire of your heart he put something in there to want to serve him to want to love him that's Grace that's the God's blessing to you oh may I rebound that to almighty God say now let me bless you Lord let me praise you with my life let me praise you with everything I do let me praise you with my thoughts let me praise you with my life let me Praise You My Strength let me glorify you in everything everybody said and that your heart desire Lord help me to bless you and Praise You In Everything amen let everything that has breath praise the Lord he's worthy of praise and he's worthy of thanks I mean please he's worthy of Thanksgiving people don't thank God they're not thankful for God for what he has done or for what he has made but the Bride of Jesus Christ amen they cry out he's saying he's worthy of Thanksgiving remember there was ten lepers that were healed and only one came back and God Jesus said where's the other nine only one came back but glorify God and to praise him and to worship Him that's about how it is one out of a million that really come back and give God glory and praise the rest of them they say it's sad the rest of them even deny their creator they deny that God made him and you know I had to think sister Jeanette I thought you know if I made something that which I made would deny that I made it probably just burn it I destroyed you want to be that rebellious you want to say I didn't make you you don't deserve to exist know what God's going to do he's going to cause them to cease to exist he's going to destroy those who deny that he made him why God doesn't let me just said God does not get the respect that he deserves does he no he doesn't he doesn't get the respect that he deserves what a world we're living in what a bunch of human beings amen I was talking to that one man yesterday and I told him I said look at what we've done you know how far it's gone he says yeah that's right look at how far it's gone you know and I said look how evil it's gotten and I said said to him you know it's almost gotten to where the Lord probably God almost probably back at the place he was in the days of Noah that he repented him that he made man repented him that he made man whew in other words what did I do did I mess up huh well there's a lot that he you know has the question but there's a lot he don't he knew I mean he knows God knew who he would he he God is not the kind of God that starts something don't know what he's doing he knows exactly what he's doing but the thing about God is he wants everybody to be saved he wants everybody to come to him and he gives everybody that opportunity to come to him but the desire is not in their heart to do so because they're of the wrong lineage as you and I know amen Simon remember remembered Bible says he came to his own and his own received him not his own children were the ones that put him on the cross isn't that right his own called his own people put him on that cross away with him away with him crucifying crucifying after watching Lazarus come back from the dead the blinded eyes open and also for back then no that was in our generation Jesus would come and open the eyes of the Blind and discern the thoughts and intents of the heart those Pentecostal preachers would say if you go to their meetings we'll excommunicate you from our church one of them said you know I'll stop so and so was over on your platform now we're gonna have to take him off the book he won't make it to Heaven boy brother Adam hung up holding up on him you mean to tell me you're a minister of the gospel and you don't know any more about the God than that no wonder he says there's millions and billions of so-called Christians no more no more about God than a Hot and Hot knows about an Egyptian Knight claim to serve Jesus Christ but there he was doing the same thing they don't even know who he is that's the blindness isn't it oh folks let me tell you something I've dealt with a little bit of blindness in people and if you get a spirit on you and you get a wrong Spirit on you that spirit will make you believe that you are right 100 percent and you won't be wanting to give any you won't want to have no questions that I'm right or wrong huh and that's what real blindness comes in a real and that's the way it fares these were they didn't want to even hear that they were wrong if Dana just said maybe I'm wrong God could have maybe work with him amen but it's a spirit that blinds people and the God does not get treated the way that he should and amen we want to treat him right don't we amen the unwelcome Christ but the Bam's talking about that that Pharisee did not welcome him did not entertain him he says I wonder how much we entertain Christ how much we give back to him and glorify him and entertain him or do we do like the Pharisees we're so busy with the big shots and the highfalutinas and this that or the other or our work or our this that or the other we say Lord I need more of you I want you to come into my life and when he does you don't even recognize it folks When you pray God I need more of you you better watch out tomorrow somehow or other God's going to try to come and see you he'll come and visit you because he always goes where he's invited let me believe that Jesus he did with time and Simon hears this he says man we need to we fail to entertain him how many believes that I don't care what it is entertain him thank you Hallelujah you're worthy of Praise entertain the Lord I don't care what you do for Christ anything God recognizes he sees it amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah that's right entertain the Lord don't let him sit there with 30 feet unentertained amen oh my okay we got to two o'clock amen we always have a lot of a lot of spare time in between amen so we'll just take our time let's go on though I love that look at he began to talk about bless the Lord talk about Abraham and the blessing that came with Abraham now we want to go to Psalms 34 talk about David here Psalm 34. I Will Bless The Lord once in a while no at all times folks I want to say something we may not have the gifts of speaking in tongues we need men out of this out of the other but I'd like to see a whole congregation what's so important is that every one of us has the right attitude that right a positive attitude of praising the Lord that's the best thing we could have is a attitude of love in our hearts towards God Amen and that we would praise the Lord and bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in what I can do no my my soul shall make her both in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad oh magnify the Lord with me amen for he is worthy to be praised and let us exalt his name together David said that's where we get that song Amen I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all of my fears Glory aren't you glad that God delivers you it is God delivers you from all of your fear you can't deliver yourself why will I bless you how that's why I bless him because he delivered me oh Thomas finally you have no idea amen the fears and the facts that I am myself and went through been at the battle but God has delivered me out of all my feared I Will Bless Lord at all times amen how many believes that oh my they look unto him and were enlightened and their faces were not ashamed this small poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles oh has the Lord ever delivered you out of all your troubles this morning how many pleased and experts the angel of the Lord and Camp was round about you and I that fear Him to deliver them how many blades Deliverance is of the Lord salvation is of the Lord go back a little bit to the last Wednesday's service I guess it was amen preaching on salvation I didn't go into Nicodemus not Nicodemus but into soccer Zacchaeus up in the tree and he says he just today I'm going to your house today and Jackie has been a tax collector he said you know because he was probably a little crooked even on behalf of everything back that ever took a man up here all of it back and then Jesus turned says today salvation has come to your house how many believes today in this thing salvation came to this generation don't pass goodbye Hallelujah the angel of the Lord in Camp was wrong about them that fear Him to deliver them oh taste and seed at the Lord is good bless it is the man that trusts Us in him when you put your trust in him you are gonna be blessed I don't care what it is I don't care who it is young people if you don't taste not just taste because people just get a little taste and know that the Lord is good but something has to happen way down in here but one thing's for sure it is good to be a Christian if you don't find that it's the best thing in the world you need a real experience with God because something out there is going to look better and you're going to be this Gravely disappointed amen aren't you glad that you know oh fear the lord ye hear Saints for there is no want to them that fear Him amen remember a long time ago I've preached on Thou shalt not want that's applied everything that you ever have in this world or in the world to come when he gave to the Holy Ghost there's no want for them that fear Him amen oh you might think oh I need this that no he supplied it for you it's there if you just believe it amen the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing come your children hearken unto me and I will teach you to fear the lord amen what man now notice this goes over in the New Testament what man is he that desire of life and live loveth many days that he may see good keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking God that's in Peter I believe it is amen how many bees that oh my what's your tongue depart from Evil resist the devil and he'll flee from you depart from Evil and do good seek peace and pursue it very very quotations of the New Testament the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open to their cry come on people how many believe that God hears your cry God's ears are open to you he's not deaf to your Christ to your calls but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth amen the righteous cry and the Lord heareth and delivereth them out of all of their troubles amen how many believe that for Christians there's still much trouble that lays ahead we don't know what kind of trouble lays ahead huh but like sister shares this it doesn't matter we know the one that's going to deliver us and you know the one that's going to deliver us so you don't worry about the troubles we know the one that takes care of our troubles amen the Lord is not unto them that are of a broken heart and save as such that be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous hey man let me tell you something but the Lord delivers them out of them all amen we could read that for those who serve the devil many are the afflictions of sinners but the devil doesn't deliver them out of any you know right that's right he can't deliver he's not a delivery he keepeth his bones and none of them is broken talking about Christ amen praise the Lord turn to another one 103. Psalms 103. amen we got about three more to go Psalms 103 bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me amen bless His holy name sing it with me that's right how many believe that isn't that wonderful our very songs come from this bless my soul and forget not all that you want to have a doula Jubilee of being Christian oh my just go ahead and get your big old tablet like this right here amen like I did one count your blessings name them one by one get your big old tablet see how many things that are benefit a benefit of the Lord bless the Lord and forget not all of his benefits that's why we bless him is because he's given us all these benefits praise be to God amen the benefit of having a shield the benefit of having an angel camped around about you amen ain't no devil can touch you ain't nobody that can do nothing and nothing can touch you on Sudden has permission by almighty God oh on and on we could go but we're not preaching that this morning forgive us it is the man to whom God will not impute sin over in the New Testament I thought you know thank you Lord Glory let me bless your name for you have forgiven me all of my iniquities every one of us probably can say you know there's things I knew I shouldn't do but I did that was inequity but if you repent say God forgive me he has forgiven you of all your inequity bless His holy name amen Hallelujah aren't you glad for that who healeth all thy diseases how many of those he healing belongs to him you don't get no healing unless he gives it to you oh my one time somebody tried to say that uh you know the devil heals the devil can't heal nobody because of this scripture right here if you get healed in any form or fashion I don't care if it's just your body of healing itself that was God putting that in there he's the one that heals all your diseases Glory who redeemeth thy life from destruction amen who Crown a thief with loving kindness and Tender Mercies be kindly affectionate one to another be kind amen how many knows it's a whole like those that makes you kind because in this world it's easy to get really really mean huh that's right before you know it you'd have all kinds of road rage and all kinds of other rages if it wasn't for God but he crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies but this just comes to mind but Abraham says don't let me cry don't let the devil Crown my old age my life with being a grouchy old man or a grumpy old lady isn't that right that's right who satisfy at thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles [Applause] I'm really glad that you can feel young when you're old if you're a Christian you got the Holy Ghost you can feel young even though if you're old praise be Lord Hallelujah oh my just getting old it's depressing enough you need something to encourage you amen sorry the Lord is merciful first I missed one the Lord executed his righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed he made known his ways unto Moses his acts unto the children of Israel the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plentyth in Mercy he will not always child need to really keep his anger forever and here's what I like also I just want to pick this up he hath not dealt with us after our sins amen how many believes that how what if he actually dealt with you according to your sin you wouldn't be alive would you you would be dead no reward is according no rewarded us according to our iniquities amen all right where was it somewhere ironed where well let me go on I think it may be yeah here here's one here's a thought I was trying to think of a previous scripture where he talks about he don't hold our sins against us amen and I thought you know because if he did it would be like you know what it's like to hold something against somebody how you feel right you don't think of that person the same anymore you don't feel the right way towards that person because you hold something against that person amen and that's the way it would be with God and you if he held that against you well you just wouldn't have peace with God he wouldn't be you know it'd be in a bad way now notice for as the heaven is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy Towers them that fearium as far as the East is from the West so far hath he removed our transgressive from us how many square for that like as a father PDF his children so the Lord pityth them that fear Him for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust for as for man his days are as grass as the flower of the field so he flourishes isn't that what Peter said amen like the grass for the wind passes over it and it is gone and the place of shall know it no more but the mercy of the Lord is forever from Everlasting to Everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto his children's children verse 19 the Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth overall amen how many believes that you can apply that to your heart that you want God to rule all your heart Lord help me Lord help him to be the ruler of all of my heart bless the Lord ye his angels that excel in strength and do his Commandments hearken unto the voice of his word bless ye the Lord all ye his hosts ye Ministers of his that do his pleasure bless the Lord all his Works in all places of his Dominion bless the Lord oh

we get started Lord Jesus now as we come to this part of the service Lord and most sacred time father of us meditating on you and what you did for us on Calvary and how that you were the lamb that took away to work the sin of the world Lord and the lamb that was worthy to receive glory and honor and praise Lord and we come father humbly before you Lord Jesus thank you for what you have done Lord and we ask God that you'll just bless the communion service and each one that partakes of it Lord Lord and we trust each one it is a part of you father that we're all a part of you Lord we ask you to bless it now in Jesus name amen and amen First Corinthians 11 and verse 23. Paul says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed to read when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this through he as often as he drink it in remembrance of me for as often as he eat this bread and drink of this cup he do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall he give this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh and unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and for this cause many are weak and sickly among you from many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come we like to have a moment of silence so that you can examine yourself amen before you eat of that bread and drink of that cup amen amen all those that want to partake of the communion come over around this side the rest can be seated
