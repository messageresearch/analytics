our requests before you father in a harsh desire tonight Lord as father that you'd be with each and every one Lord of those prayer requests that's been mentioned earlier father we ask God you just be with him in a special way and we believe God that you'll do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think father Lord you'll meet with us tonight Lord that you'll speak through my lips Lord Jesus and use my heart mind father to speak to your children the things that you once said tonight to encourage us to strengthen us Lord that we might be closer to you might be you ready for the Rapture that lays ahead Lord and father as we come into your house we ask God that we just know that you're here father because you said you would be wherever two or three would be gathered you'd be in our midst we ask God that you just give us unction of the holy spirit for what to speak tonight in Jesus name amen and amen amen I feel like I have a new message amen tonight amen and so I always like new messages amen amen I was thinking earlier I says evangelist you know you could take some of these good messages at least it gets laid on your heart and you could just go all over the country and preach it amen amen and preach one sermon probably for a month or two you know but I mean when you're a pastor well you just can't preach the same message everything every sermon so you always digging a little deeper amen amen trying to get up some some fresh meat amen I always like fresh meat fresh amen when the Lord just lays something on something on your heart amen and once again it's a little simple thought but amen I trust it'll be a blessing to you amen if you will let's turn our Bibles in our scene is going to start amen at Calvary amen so I have um different stories I want to tell but I'm going to start with Luke 23 amen we'll go to Mount Calvary and look amen what the Lord will have for us amen and so but a jewel has booked the flight for the first of next month amen so he's going to be up here ministering for us the first of next month Lord willing him and so we look forward to seeing him amen amen so Let's uh go to Luke 23 and verse 39. and this is the thought that began in my mind Amen in my heart amen this is what started it and so then we go from there amen and one of the male factors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself verse 39 if you're still look at verse 23 verse 39 say thyself and US amen now notice how he says and us so he wanted to be saved didn't he amen but there's still something wrong with his repentance isn't it I mean there's something wrong with that because maybe he just wanted to come off the cross and maybe go do the same things he did before amen amen so but the other answering rebuked him saying thus not thou fear God seeing that thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed just before we receive the due reward of our Deeds but this man has done nothing amid and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou cometh into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise amen may God had his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen and at night I want to speak about so close yet so far so close yet so far amen so I was mentioning that to my wife and she says you know what what uh what is good what is close are almost good for it's the saying is close is no good except for there you go and the attitude that came along with it amen Christ will bring it to pass and this man had the right attitude and he said the right words can you imagine living all your life and and doing all of the things that he has done but yet because lots of nine words you're granted eternal life to have Jesus and see in Paradise can you imagine what a reply what a sweet sound that must have been yeah and isn't it something how that all he asked the Lord to do is to remember him just remember me is that right but you know something else that I got he said look man you are here and we're getting what we deserve but that man ain't done nothing [Music] the Bible say one place you know if you confess me I'll confess you if you stand for Christ Christ will stand for you and he was standing up for Christ we didn't hear him make big confessions about what he had to understand all he asked is remember me and Christ knew what was in his heart didn't he therefore he ex totally erased all of his sins and told him that you're going to be with me Paradise today that man I don't care how much pain he was in and out condition he had reason for rejoicing and being happy because he told him he's going to be in Paradise but you know this is a double this is a I want to use this for a this is a a doubling example tonight amen of of people that were right at the break and right at the edge come so close but yet didn't make it hear this man can you imagine if the other Thief would have had the same attitude he could have been granted eternal life by nine words all right so close nine words sometimes it's even less words than that that have been spoken people missed Heaven by just seven words some of them are some of these examples are only seven words nine words amen the difference between Heaven and Hell life or death amen but what a glorious thing it was for him and how many believe that when we get only get to meet this man right here you know I don't wanna just take a rabbit Trail but remember the story of those that atheist and the little girl coming home from Sunday school about what was it about that fish swallow and Jonah or whatever you don't really believe that or the man said young lady he says well he said you know and she says well when I get to heaven I'll I'll ask him is that right and well he said well if what if he ain't there and she said well then you'll have to ask him Maybe you talking about the babes right oh my God but think about it you know think about this here and I just really love it because just it's just so close I thought it was so close everybody talks about it would be so close the real thing it would deceive the very elected if it was possible it's just one decision away just one choice away had the right attitude if I just said the right thing in another story person was uh right close so close yet so far it's the story of the rich young man that came to Christ wanting eternal life remember and behold this is in chapter 19 of Matthew verse 16 19 and 16. and Bill what came and said unto him good Master what good things shall I do that I may have eternal life notice how he was Desiring eternal life and he said him why color stop me good there is none good but one and that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments he saith unto him which and Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear Falls with so the young man saith unto them all these things have I kept from my youth huh wow this guy was righteous huh to be able to look Jesus in the face and say I've committed kept all of these from my youth and Jesus never know you didn't never disputed it tell us how close he was it reminds me of the virgins remember the virgins ten merges five were foolish some were wise notice how they were virgins they were pure they were clean they lived totally lives let me tell you how many a lot of people that don't do a bunch of wrong things they live holy lives they live clean lives they just lack one thing and that's oil in their limbs how many knows when they go to Knocking on that door that's the only thing that didn't get them in was not having all in their life folk don't you can't just live a righteous and holy life and be clean and all you've got to be baptized with the Holy ghosts so this man asks oh that's the question I've done this from my youth what lack I yet can we definitely say Amen the boy was asking the right questions and that's a question that every one of us should ask tonight Lord where do I still lack because how many knows that you know uh let me think what's almost perfect how would you describe almost perfect I would say imperfect you're not perfect if you're not you're almost perfect but you're not so you're imperfect it's like being ready right looking for something a little bit different brother Glenn because you're almost there but just not how about the Rapture well I almost made the Rapture did you you know I didn't help you admit that you almost made it but I was almost ready [Music] how'd you notice that when the devil came almost right it was 99 and he's a white lie what is another description of a white lie it's just plain alive it's still alive and there's we say white lie because we're trying to do describe it as being right because you think white if it's a lie it's still black [Music] folks I want you to understand something the Bible says it in this last days people will live such a life the ones that's even the thing that's deceit leaving it's gonna be almost huh what was it that young man testified the other day amen I believe it was David he was talking about how that day we're talking about these two Jesus or Jesus and the father and they got talking about the father amen because if you come with that give come if you come up with two plus two equals something different than four hello and if you come up with Doctrine plus Doctrine and you've got more than one God you've got it wrong one baptism I am God besides me I know nothing is it your Redeemer Christ was Our Redeemer everything more than that you have got a problem of course it takes oh my let me night just comes to mind can I go on here before we finish this story but even the disciples how many knows that Jesus was with the disciples and they were so close to him but yet they didn't know him anybody said he said if I've been so long with you then you don't know who the father is yeah we're so close but they still didn't have it it's like arguing with somebody that is is absolutely set you gotta have ties in the titles out Matthew 28 go into all the one preaching gospel Every Creature baptizing them to find us on the Holy Ghost you still ain't got it it's so close but yet just like that thief on the cross he was right there all they had to do say you have her still on me he was right there Simon the fairest they send his servant out there I tell Jesus that invite him to dinner he says I wonder when that servant came to Jesus or he just gave him the note or just give him enough what's up want you to come to dinner tomorrow night and off you win confident many how they got in the presence of Jesus I don't want to fall down I am he had his chance he was right there so close but where is he today amen so close yet so far well we can certainly bring it down to our age Christ was so close he was so close to everybody he was Jesus himself was so close to all these churches those ministers in Chicago huh and yet all those places are hard not right there and one time brother man was preaching in my many many different times he was preaching it says and he would preach his sermon and he would say now how many ones does it come and give their hearts to the Lord when I come up front and give their hearts to the Lord would you discernment or anything like that and just a few of them would come and he said that hurt him what was brother Benham doing brother by Adam was trying to get people that you don't go by sight huh too many Thomases you got to see before you believe and then after what place I heard him he says after discernment then they would come and he says you've been deceived deceived yeah because you're just going by sight how many knows we don't go by sight whether you see it or not you know it's the word of God you know Christ is here say I want to give my heart to God I don't have to see anything amen my believe anyway it's more blessed to believe and not have Saul he told Thomas that have seen him believe amen oh my God so we see here what like I yet and Jesus said I didn't see him if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor just what Sydney but can we say come on let's go just like he did to Peter John come on follow me huh give him the invitation to come and follow him let me tell you something and he knew where that young man lacked he knew that he loved his treasures and he loved the things of the world huh that's why Jesus said uh Saint John's there it says love not the world or the things of the world of your man love the things of the world the love of God ain't in him can I say something it's not if you love the things of the world and it takes more of your time of God in your home heart huh these two she's come a different time do I have to you don't go to church I have a hard time believing that you're a Christian because if God's in your heart you can't wait for them doors that's where God say Amen amen amen all right so he says go and sell at thou house and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure and come and follow me and the young man heard to say he was away sorrowful for be a great possession sure it was a bunch of stuff sure was a lot he was a rich man foolish that is another Revelation today or this week hell is going to be full of wishful's thinking people are going to do a lot of wishing over there huh they'll wish they had done different that rich young man whoever he is let me tell you I'm sure he is one wish she had made the right choice he wished autonomy right there and I missed how do I know that about the wishing thing because remember Jesus said there was a man that fared well brother man said the young man and got richer and everything else but went to hell Lazarus he was went to heaven isn't that right and the rich man lifted up his eyes and hell and so forth and that's lives were just come give him some code water on his tongue and so forth and then he got them preaching to Abraham and descend louder my brother not come to this place he all of a sudden wished he had a chance to tell people not to come to this place you know you know I really think that that story ought to convert the whole world there's that story right there applies to everybody that ever hears that story he went to hell he would lift up he said oh God I want somebody to go back and I want you that they would believe him that Abraham says he got the law and the prophets and Abraham clearly told him he says you are wrong if they will not believe the law and the prophets neither will they have to leave until one raised from the dead how about in our day God raised 12 13 people from the dead and people still all believe foreign Nicodemus was another one that came close got the Jesus got to be born again Jesus said how can I be born in this Saturday with you listen and I mean it was it because Nicodemus told on them he says we know and you are a teacher sent from God because nobody can do these things let's see what is a god they knew he was of God gonna be a lot of preachers in this generation that knew that he was the prophet of God that he could have never done those things with the seventh grade education all his hates and totes and fetches and uh straw tick beds and hello all the things common hillbilly could have never went even so sad ended up doing it I hated huh I hope he did because if he couldn't have seen that hey God did fulfill his will is that right I don't know though I don't know though because he wanted to have brother Brandon ordain women preachers and brother Branham quit the church because so it looks a little bit questionable don't it but a man can repent so hopefully that's what he did but notice how close I mean it's a Pharisees well they were right there time and time again he's late in the grave his nose on forsaken it throws the stone away and breaks the man out everybody ought to fall on their knees cause I'm here so it's got to be today disappointed disappointed wishing in hell that they had made a different choice amen how many knows people can laugh and Mock and they can worship the devil openly they can do all of those things but know this God's going to have the last laugh amen the last laugh that's right I will laugh at your calamity when your distress comes on you huh all of a sudden you go from where a a devil outfit and into a saint you fall down you'll be laughing huh because God is Not mocked by the man sows that will he also reap amen just that one thing one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven and then come and follow me just a few words come and follow me in life as believer a Christian when God asks you to forsake all I'm all yours or not do that's what I'm here to do because that's what God demands how many believes that you're not willing to forsake all your own ideas your own previous teaching and everything to follow me I'm not the gonna well he wasn't quite right but I'm gonna go ahead and take him in they ain't gonna be that almost no almost with God amen and that Prophet says there's no black white bird no sinner saint you're either Saint or sinner how many knows that when you're filled with the Holy Ghost if God accepts your repentance and he washes you why the blood of the Lamb father God said you're the very righteousness of God you're as righteous as God is righteous but it's his righteousness in you and I now we don't go wrong saying I am so righteous we don't feel that way we don't we don't do that but we know that that's the truth that's the word of God amen yeah the very righteousness of God before coming out here you were worshiping and singing and let me tell you something no matter how common it seems to come to church no matter how much comedy seems to sing amazing right when we cut together like this we worship we're doing the greatest thing and be done I can't hear you we're doing the greatest thing can be done when we come to church worship God praise him and love him and hear his word there is no higher order days not he's not greater than that the preacher I'm the Holy Ghost give you the word of God and for you to receive it he that believeth shall be saved he doesn't even so close just one choice away one choice between hell in heaven one decision that right and you're defined by the decisions that you because we know when Pharisees wouldn't accept the Lord my word has no place in you if Abraham was your father is not Abraham but you are of your father the devil that's right you know bothered today that's why you don't believe me I would always choose what we do oh my I don't want to wish to you the wish for something is to almost get it maybe no you'll have to wish brother Danny I heard your sermon on don't try to have faith I was listening to the house do it believe I thought he must have been let's see that that's right don't just try do it praise be to God amen all right my my Israel Israel was so close how many weeks ago said two weeks two weeks Journey something like that from what they were to where they were supposed to go still wondering 40 years later there were shout clouds but because of the condition that they were in oh my when I think about it the Bible the word of God is so close it's right there Deliverance is right there the Holy Ghost is right there quit wandering you're complaining your negative attitude your unbelief this has been mentioned several times about brother Bannerman that's one man was I've been seeking the Holy Ghost Say he answered him correctly didn't he there must be doubt in there what are you doubting for cause the minute you genuinely believe so you genuinely believe God is obligated that he will fill you with the Holy Ghost it's only doubt that keeps you from your promises it's our greatest enemy is that doubt unbelief amen and they're lack of believing did you ever meet somebody that just absolutely has no self-control huh that's how Israel was whatever the flesh desired that's but they do and every time they felt like complaining they got hungry and oh man they dude thirst and left no Shout self-control I'll tell you what God don't like it I'm great about you amen I don't care if you got to repent of something every day you repent of it God will see that repentance you see you got great he mean it huh oh my but notice that's how Israel was they were weak except for a couple of them isn't that right because we all know that because oh my let me tell you I believe rapturing face in this message when we see what God has done into Miracles and all that and that's what brother Brandon refers to look at what God's done if that don't give you rapturing faith I don't know what will I'm not Almost Persuaded that this message is true of God I'm an almost persuaded that that killer fire that you see is the very God that let the children not in the wilderness with the pillar of fire it's a same Pillar of Fire I'm 100 can be 100 it's oh my and I want to pull up how many would see Jesus a bunch of times and he talked about those the Greeks that they came up to the disciples and so forth Jesus we would see Jesus and he kept they're saying look whatever Jesus did yesterday that's what he would do today and then he would do it at the end this every class would come and say not skip it's him if they wanted to see him you can see him I wonder where those Greeks are today did they really accept him did they receive him amen well what about this generation he certainly was here he was in front of everybody what do you think brother Brad a man when he would say now he is here I'm waiting on him now he's here that was him that was Christ that was Jesus in the form of the Holy Ghost in his body which is called the church doing what brother bam says he said Greater Works indeed shall you do we're more working you know right the body was going to do more Works than what Jesus himself did here on there and he certainly did ten times the size of Pentecost and what about the 500 000 or so an African different ones that through their Idols down under dust huh oh my that's right greater Christ did in the body but people see me knows people miss it it's sad that's why the world is in the con e God says if God do as well tables just do what your brother did and you'll be accepted just one little command just do your brother dead but he couldn't do it just couldn't get himself to do it the Rich Young Ruler he just couldn't get himself to do it I want to jump on top of this pulpit when you think about the fact that God put something in you [Music] [Applause] to help you with that they just can't cross that line they just can't make that decision they don't want it they might be like being so much so until he killed him then when God says well Hey where's your brother he says I don't know am I My Brother's Keeper lie to God right to his face what a horrible person huh foreign a woman is that five husbands just mired up people won't even come and drink the same time she does but when he comes out there when the light flashes it costs her death she accepts it man I'm here to tell you when the Son of God hears the truth he can't help themselves they're gonna accept What God Says [Applause] that's the difference oh the world don't want to hear it but it's the truth there's children of God in the Earth there is Children of the devil the children of the devil will never want it they won't accept it no matter how plain it is no matter how open it is deniable it is don't get me down in the message of people around this message hello huh comes right down to where people live amen okay praise the Lord you love him amen if it's not quite perfect it's imperfect it's perfect not almost perfect almost or just about amen you know I believe can I just say something comes to mind I believe that's why people don't get the Holy Ghost they try so hard but God knows there's still that they're not willing to turn loose of they're not letting go amen has to become the way that he wants you to come and when you do God will give you the baptism I'm so glad for that um all right let's go to another story a core story it's going to require a little bit of reading so go with me the book acts if you will I want to read this it's kind of false testimony and we want to get to the almost 26. ax okay let's go with number chapter 25 and then we'll go to verse then Agrippa said I'm too fast that he died oh shall hear him verse 26 then Agrippa said unto Paul permitted to speak for thyself then Paul stretched forth his hand and answered for himself think myself happy King Agrippa because that I shall answer for myself boy ball had confidence isn't it right remember Jesus said whenever you're brought before the Kings don't think about what you're going to say because the Holy Ghost will give you what you have to say and Paul certainly believed that and he certainly manifested that scripture I think myself happy King Agrippa because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews especially because I Know Thee to be expert in all Customs beseech you to hear me patiently my manner of life from my youth which was at the first among my old Nation at Jerusalem all the Jews they all know my manner and now I stand and I am judged for the hope of the promise made of God under our notice how he says God made the promise under our fathers and that's what I'm calling question about unto Rich a day and night hope to come for which hope say King Agrippa I'm accused of the Jews why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God should do many things contra pieces of Nazareth which thing I also did in Jerusalem and many of the Saints did I shut up in prison having received and when they were put to death I gave my voice against them and I punished it and being exceedingly mad against them upper execute them even and to these people how many knows he was missing the mark [Music] on as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests at midday okay I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me and when we were all Fallen to the earth I heard a boy speaking banging into you Bhutan Saul Saul I persecuted it is hard for thee to kick again the pricks and I said whom our thou Lord and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest but rise and stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee Minister and the witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things in which I will today delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I sent thee to open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sin faith that is in Me whereupon O King Agrippa I was not disobedient unto the Heavenly visioned now let's stop there for a minute Chicago one place brother banham begin to go and he was you know either a Minister's a breakfast or somewhere and he began to open up the services dead and he read these picture I was not a disobedient unto the heavenly vision and they knew that he was going to tell the story of how that voice spoke out of a tree don't smoke or just this is where the Lord came to him and so forth and until five preachers took off the back row and how they went okay you might hear none of that think about that foreign just saying look I'm gonna tell you is what I seen but God told me just like Paul did folks I'm here to tell you not going to be pleasant for them folks on that day is it okay whereupon all right I was not the master 's Jerusalem in other words he preached to him and throughout all the coasts of Judea and then to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God and do Works meet for repentance for these causes the Jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me having therefore obtained help from God I continued unto this day witnessing both the small and great saying none other thing than those things which the prophets and Moses did say should come in other words I'm just saying what they said this conch was good it would come he should be the flight unto the people and said with a loud voice Paul mad uh Festus had to cut it then yeah you're mad much learning has made me mad but he said I am not mad most noble Festus but speak truth speak forth the words of truth knoweth of these whom I also I speak freely for I am for this thing was not done in the corner King agriba believe it's thou the prophets I know about believist he knew this King Agrippa real well he says King Agrippa do you believe the prophets I know you believe the prophets is that right then Agrippa said unto Paul almost thou persuadeth me to be a Christian imagine wherever King Agrippa is now he's saying man I almost did I was that close I knew it was the truth huh but no doubt the devil told him what would come with it he wouldn't be king for long and all these other things you're gonna lose your king remember this church and you'll place them to brother about him says we know that's the truth but if I teach that they'll throw me out huh almost almost persuaded almost don't be almost persuaded ain't no clothes because he didn't and Paul said I would to God only now but also all that hear me this day were both almost and all together such as I am except these bonds tonight think about it don't you but accepted like you've exp you want everybody to Paul said man I would give my own salvation that's how much love he had in his heart and then that what because it's it's so close for the whole world it is so close for God so loved the world that he gave his only Scott and son that whosoever believes Glee genuinely believe he had believeth and he's baptized shall be saved not complicated it's just simple amen but he didn't believe it or not shall be damned it's so close very close how many knows Jesus is close Jesus came very close to this generation discerned thoughts and hints of the heart knows he is here how many believes he's here I believe the Holy Ghost is here to tonight and what's he doing fulfilling Revelations 3 20 I believe is behind I stand at the door and how many knows he's knocking at every door whosoever will not and then every note he's right there at the door and you only have to do one thing world you only have to do one thing one thing no no and I will come in that's the promise amen and he doesn't open up I like that to him but openness will I come in and I will accept with him whoa butter why do you get sick excited why why because I'm stepping with him every day I'm something about him and I got my mind the penny reveals these little snuggies to me and the guy that he's just talking to me he's shopping with me he's shopping with you you don't have that relationship begin to get that mind of yours on the Lord more it can change your whole day your whole you can make everything so much better all right but nobody's knocking off he's not just standing there quiet foreign open your heart see that's right the word of God Is Right that's the truth and let him in so close so close amen open at the Welsh she was far away from God she was far away that thief on the cross he was far away in his spiritual State he was a sinner condemned to judgment but yet he came to Christ same with the woman at the Welsh she was so far stupid in sin but yet when Christ come along aren't you glad that you're not like the Pharisees he said about the Pharisees he says these people drawn onto me with their lips but just a few inches in their heart is far from Monday they come close with their lips but their hearts sway somewhere else outwardly they appear righteous before that but in we're legit to live up and inside there's their heart is a sepulch it's a tomb and inside of that is nothing but dried old bones the outward says on their righteous and they're holding and they're alive in God but inside there are better than that and that's the way a lot of so-called Christians are foreign but it's the inside that has to be alive how many knows you can come to church to sing songs and all that but clear are you at here are you close to him in here is that alive in there or is it full of dead men's bones now I'm here to tell you there's that if you don't have Christ you're going to be dead because we were all dead in sin and trespasses at one time we really aren't alive until Christ comes in amen in closing Paul said in Ephesians 1 and verse 11 wherefore remember that ye being in times past Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcisioned by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made with hands that at that time ye were without covenants of the promise having no hope and without this word no so I'll tell you what if you're saved tonight you can look back you know the time you know the place when you were without hope without God in this world you are far away act from God we were Gentiles that the public God said we were clubs on our back but who loves you got a caveman and huh worshiping idols huh but notice without hope without God in this world but now in Jesus Christ he who were sometimes found oh our midnight by the blood of Christ amen that's right so close yet so far and so far yet so close I would yeah I would rather be so far and yet so close then I would be so close and yet so far they were close and now they're far far away amen I'm May believes you need to listen to that still small voice God wants to talk to you he wants to fellowship with you he wants to steal I've noticed his church here which is kind of a little bit maybe we're discouraged what it never did so we get that way but let me tell you encourage you tonight start stepping with him a little more have that personal relationship s a talk back with you may not have a tree to run her car whatever it is it don't matter when you get that Joy Bell's ringing folks when I begin the Lord begin the show one boy that nine words that he said he didn't go to hell he went to her death bed on his deathbed so to speak amen he was God's child and then Jesus said today you'll be with me and with me I like that in Paradise stand with me musicians who come Noah's day no doubt when the rains came they came knocking at the door don't you think they were just aboard away just aboard away I ever think that thing was isn't that right but they had turned it down too many times and the doors to get in but what this heart for me amen there will be weeping and wailing from that door let God show you where you still lack how many please God do what God does yep I truly believe that's what God does we were talking about multiplication Edition and so forth God says man if you're righteous and if you are a tree bringing you forth he prunes you so he's working on us amen it's our heads Christ knocking at your heart's door wanting a closer read on thee help us all to realize that shall we have to think about our jobs our works and our business and everything but in it all keep our mind my mind stayed on the Lord Jesus you see the hands father every one of us Lord we need a closer to walk God and right now we are opening the door of our heart and we say God show us our bad place show us Lord where we still lack God because we don't want to almost make it almost be right we want to be right we want to be ready father we want to be 100 the way that we're supposed to be because almost isn't good enough for our hands they're up and saying Lord forgive us of our sin and our failures our shortcomings where we're not what we should be Lord Jesus in with us up with us and we can sup with you father that's what we desire tonight is that tomorrow and from this Wednesday night on both here in the audience and those listening may we have a greater time of supping with you from this day on we raise our hands God we pledge ourselves that we want to sup with you in a greater way father because we know you're always at that door you're wanting more fellowship with us you're wanting more but we just don't give it Lord the way we should and we're right now saying God help me to realize where those areas are where I'm not suffering with you like I should forgive us Lord as Christians Lord and we open our hearts door tonight father we know father that your sheep know and hear your voice and in others they will not follow blessed now as we commit ourselves to you Lord and pledge ourselves a new God to listen to your voice to sup with you
