just stand this morning your brother Joe will take us to prayer this morning forever or if you want to control everything in here [Music] the preaching of the word or that we can leave here better than when we came to this point right at this point my neighbors on each one of us I'm worried about what's our situation did you help him self this week or whatever it is [Applause] or whatever [Music] amen the children can be dismissed for Sunday School we'll go in the scriptures we're gonna go to Proverbs the 13th chapter Proverbs the 13th chapter and I I think we'll read to 1 through 12 is what we're going to do proverbs 13. why son here at this father's instruction but a scorner hereth not rebuke he then keepeth his mouth keepeth his life but he that openeth wide is live shall have destruction righteous men hateth lying but a wicked man is loathsome and cometh to shame away there is that maketh there is that maketh himself Rich yet hath nothing there is that make themselves poor yet have great riches the light of the righteous rejoices but the lymph of the wicked shall be put out wealth gotten by Vanity shall be diminished but he that gaareth by labor shall increase hope deferred maketh the heart sick but when the desire cometh it is a tree of life God bless you may be seated brother Brian brothers and sisters I think I said why it's been several years ago but in in the Proverbs if you've read one problem of every day of every month you when you read the Proverbs you think of Solomon what program was four thousand years ago quite not quite but almost 4 000 years ago and the wisdom that he wrote four thousand years ago is the same wisdom for today you know you know brother Branham said to men don't change it they don't change as a man dies that spirit that ever possessed him just moves on to another man or another woman them Spirits have been here for that lascivious spirit they've been here for thousands of years and we all make a choice whether we're going to allow those spirits to possess our hearts and souls or we're going to allow the spirit of Christ to possess our heart and soul and that's that's basically the only difference you know men think there's getting smarter they're getting better but actually they're just getting worse you know I was I was uh reading numerous chapters this morning in my study and and I was reading in Ezekiel the I'm I'm up to almost 30th chapter of Zeke unit thinking how Ezekiel talked about um I already found my point this morning how Ezekiel was talking about the children of Israel and how profane they were and how lost they were but then you you also read where it says in their own minds before they were taken wouldn't he the voice of the Prophet for the day that they lived in and you think of our day and age you know the world that we live in this morning how far off the Mark is the world out there this morning how crazy have they gone you know I I won't even talk about the things they do anymore because it's not edifying to talk about the things you're doing out there in the world anymore but as you get older I know as a young man you would think you know this is what you've been seeing all your life as you get a little older you realize the things that you thought were normal when you were 19 now that you're almost seven you never thought that the world would be the way it is this morning but then brother Brown gave us a prophecy saying it ain't going to get any better it's only going to get worse however I prophecy this morning that you know what you see today on Sunday you know 9th of 2023 you can guarantee that of course it's not going to get better so it should let us know as Christians that are hoped this morning is not in the world or in the things that it supplies but in Jesus Christ this morning outside of that there's no hope and I was reading several several chapters this morning um I'll just I'll just go over I was going to read from Romans the first chapter but I'll jump over here if you return with me I read this chapter a lot in the Bible this morning I mean when things seem in your lives this morning sometimes this chapter really can lift you up in the day that we live this morning you have that hope this morning and I was um before I get started it's the fifth chapter of second Corinthians I I didn't tell you what chapter I was looking at but I was reading those things up there this morning that were posted there the quotes from Brother Branham you know and think about being a soldier but the one trait a soldier has to have of course he needs courage uh if you don't have courage you will not be a very good soldier you won't be a very good Christian if you don't have courage but you have to be steadfast if you're going to be a soldier of Christ you have to be steadfast you have to plant Your gran feeding in the ground firmly and not step back you're not going to go backward you're just going to keep pushing forward as God leads you to push forward if you're not steadfast in the age that we're living and you're going to get consumed by all the things that are out there this morning but um this chapter right here in the fifth chapter Corinthians already I say it but I won't say it I was about to say something but you know Paul was talking to the Corinthian Believers we know they were a backslid church they're no different than the church world today they couldn't keep themselves correctly Paul constantly how to correct the Corinthian Church they were constantly doing going in all kinds of excesses but I'll just read what Barbara Paul had to say this morning for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a billion of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens so that's a comforting thought it's not something we do but God's done it for us and this goes back to the 14th chapter of the Gospel of John and he says for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven so the very Christian Spirit should desire to be in your fun off well I'm not going to pronounce you're in your Heavenly Body I'll say it that way I was about to mispronounce that word if so be being clothed we shall not be found naked but we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that which we would be unclothed but close upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life and now he that hath were brought us for the self same thing as God who has given unto us the earnest of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are home in the body we are absent from the Lord and we all are that way this morning we're absent from the Lord in a physical sense but in a spiritual sense this morning you should not be absent that God should be in your heart this morning you should be a friend to him you should you should be communicating with him your your heart desires should be totally wrapped around him this morning and I lost my place there for we walk by faith and not by sight we are confident and I say living rather to be absent from the body to be present with the Lord wherefore we labor that whether present or or absent we may be accepted of him and I know that's my desire this morning okay on that day that I would be accepted by him and you know you have that isn't hard for you to know if if you've done what God told you to do and that spirit is backing back to you that he's accepted that sacrifice that you gave this morning you have that Eternal help hope this morning that God gives you through the grace in Jesus Christ this morning you shouldn't be questioning it every day of your life whether you're saved or not God wants to give you that experience this morning will you know that you know that God has finished the work in your heart in your life this morning you shouldn't you don't need to be wishy-washy in the age that we live in this morning we are confident I was saying winning rather to be absent from the body to be present with the war Lord wherefore we labor that whether president or absent we may be accepted to him by rereading it again for we must all be fair before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in this body the quoting do what he has done whether it be good or bad and brother Bradham talked about this a little bit you know Christians don't go to the white Throne judgment but Christians will be judged on their works by Christ himself and that's what you you can't work your way to heaven but every Christian should the desire to do things for the Lord every day and he goes knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men that we are made manifest on the garden I trust also are made manifest in your own consciousness for we command not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion the glory on our behalf that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory and appearance and not and are for whether we be beside ourselves it is of god or whether we be sober it is for your cause For the Love of Christ constrains us because we thus judge if one died for us all then we are all dead and then I'll just finish reading this and sit down this morning because I'm totally off my point but he goes on to say that he that died for all that which lives should not henceforth live onto themselves but unto him which died for them which rose again and that's a comforting thought you're not living for yourself but you're living for him this morning you know the way I am yeah I could write thousands of notes in my book and I know that when I come up here I won't stay on my notes so I'm one of those persons that comes up here I have a few things wrote down but I'm not one of those guys that can find follow notes therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things have become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ that have given us the ministry of reconciliation you know that's a comforting thought I mentioned that earlier a few minutes ago that's the whole purpose of it all that God wants to reconcile himself with you this morning no one here this morning has to be outside of the grace of God it's a free gift for everyone here this morning but you have to choose to reach out and take it this morning to with the God that was in Christ reconcile the world gone to himself not getting their trespasses on to them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors of Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ said that you be reconciled to God for he have made him to be sin for us for who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him and I was also thinking of some of them quotes talking about being the soldier like I said one of the most important traits of you got to have courage I mean God will give you the courage you need this morning I mean your brother can't give it your sister your parents can't give you courage that's something God Christian God it's not a natural type of but Christian Courage no matter what the world says about you what the world does to you you have courage you're just going to keep putting yourself forward and forward and forward no matter what people tell you not to say that you don't take advice but anything someone tells you about how you should be or what you should do you should take it back to the word of God and the message of the hour and then as you walk forward and be in steadfast in your walk this morning and the way you become steadfast is you learn the word of God and you apply it to your life this morning that's how you steadfast and I was thinking if they're talking about the swords the swords and weapons of war but I will tell you if you're using a sword or a Warhammer or a battle ax then you're in the thick of it this morning and when you're in the thick of it it's not time to question whether you have the ability to fight you just have to fight because if you don't fight you won't make it so as we move on in this year I hope that God blesses you all this morning Brother David love the Lord this morning amen I'm standing sing that little course I Love You Lord and I left my voice this morning amen oh I love you

lesson Amen brother Amen brother Brian mentioned amen some things that I certainly have on my uh in my message talking about how that the Lord uh God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself amen but you know right afterwards it says you know God has committed what now to us the ministry of reconciliation amen so God is still in business amen so God bless you good morning good to be in the house of the Lord amen it is a good day I told my wife on the way I love a nice drizzly cloudy day I said I think it's just a really good day to Worship the Lord amen praise the Lord good to have all our visitors with us tonight this morning praise the Lord Russell Russell and your family and friends amen praise the Lord and the Rivas also God bless you Andrew and y'all to see you good to see you all it's also very good to see almost all of our home folks here amen amen that's kind of rare amen but I mean it is good to see everybody amen this is a busy time of year lots of people aren't on vacation amen or meeting somewhere amen but it is good to see everybody this morning I want to minister on something that I've had on my heart amen for two or three weeks I guess I've had it I mean uh kind of on the back burner just brewing so to speak and waiting on the Lord amen to amen give me the auction to speak it amen and I felt that uh yesterday I felt to go in the direction that I want to go amen and I uh uh I'll probably title it something different but we'll call it supporting the local body amen praise the Lord so God bless you this morning if you will we'll just bow our heads and talk to the author of the book before we read his book lord Jesus we come before you now Lord and your Prophet is taught that any man can open these open the Bible but God it does take you to give us the interpretation to give us the inspiration from the understanding from it Lord we know that it has to be given by your spirit according to your word no man knows the things of man saved the spirit of man and neither does anybody know the things of God save the spirit of God and Lord we ask God that just bless their meditation of our heart the reading of the word are assembling together Lord and most of all we believe God that you'll come and do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think Lord Jesus and I ask also that you would just be with those streaming this morning for those who couldn't be here Lord for some reason Lord we ask God you bless them also as they listen this morning Father we love you Lord and we commit this service to you not ourself for your service in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord if you will amen I would like to open up our Bibles this morning and Amy and I uh have quite a few different things that aspects of this that I'd like to share and amen so if it's just a little long bear with me would you amen but I'm trust I know that it'll be a blessing to you amen because he certainly was to me in any time you read God's word it's always a blessing isn't that right amen so I think we'll turn to First Corinthians 11 or First Corinthians 12 and we'll start with just one word and then I want scripture and then we'll let you be seated as we try to try to put together amen with the help of the Lord amen the thoughts from this scripture First Corinthians and do want to announce that Lord willing I'll be going up to do more missionary work in Ohio Tuesday morning will be gone most of the week whether Danny will be ministering this coming Wednesday so pray for him amen amen and so pray for us up there we just want to go up there and see what the Lord will help help us to be able to do amen I remember I think it was brother Billy Laster a long time ago mentioned and said that brother Branham had said that you can never go wrong doing missionary work amen amen and so we should do missionary work wherever we are praise the Lord so First Corinthians will go with chapter 12 and verse 27. now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular may God that is blessings to the reading of the word you can be seed amen seated amen I want to talk about the body of Christ the body of Christ amen praise the Lord Hallelujah and when I get when I begin to think about this and you know this is just something I feel like the Lord's kind of quickened to me and that is you know the body of Christ you know of course is the body that he's living in now compared to when he was here on Earth we know that he was in a Corporal physical body isn't that right he had his own body and all of the fullness of God dwelled in Jesus amen so that was God's body at that time amen and so uh I think when I think of the body of Christ I think of the family I think it'll be family amen and how that in order to be part of that family amen uh you have to be your DNA has to match with your mom and dad isn't that right to be a part of the family you can't join it our Prophet taught us that you know we don't join the Church of God we don't join Christ amen no you have to be borned into it amen and that's the way it is with a family you've got to be born into a family a man you have and they can take DNA tests and they can find out that you know just who your father was your mama was and many times nowadays you know uh sad to say but a lot of times fathers will do or have a DNA test done on their child to find out whether that child is really his or not I mean he knows a lot of times they come to find out there's great disappointment when they find out hey that child does not have your DNA it's not your child and of course that would rip the heart of the bed out knowing perhaps that his woman and his wife or whatever amen was unfaithful isn't that right amen and praise the Lord aren't you glad that you and I have a way of taking a DNA test how many beliefs that we have to have with the help of God you've got to have and I've got to have a DNA test something that makes absolutely ties you in amen with your heavenly father amen that makes you a part of God in Romans 8 and verse 9 is our of course our DNA test to find out if you're really one of gods or if you're his son or if you're not amen it says it this way if I can just find it here 8 and verse 9 he says but ye are not in the flesh he says but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of God he is none of his amen so I may know that amen I believe over in uh Corinthians also there's another DNA test basically amen here uh another another way to test to see if you're really a part of God's program it says in chapter 12 and verse 13 it says four by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body amen so we know that it's not my handshake it's not by putting our name on the book isn't that right but it's by the baptism of the Holy Ghost not many knows that that's exactly amen a part of God it is God himself dwelling in you when that Holy Spirit comes into your soul praise the Lord and that's the only way that you could ever become part of the body of Christ is to have his spirit amen I like that don't you aren't you glad we had a Prophet come and straighten out how you joined Church how do you come apart to become part of Christ because every church and so forth amen has its own way it has its own math it has its own uh belief of how you come and be a part of the body or uh or a part of Christ amen and we do realize that there is a local body and then there's of course and that local body is supposed to be a body of Believers isn't that right now we're taught there's three kinds of Believers but that's the local Body of Christ amen in every church and every a community rather brand them of course just you know questions and answers he says a whole lot amen about the local body and how it's supposed to be set up and so forth amen but praise the Lord I got to thinking about the body of Christ amen and now he knows that uh you know we're a privileged people today to know that if we could have been in the days of Jesus and if we could have been a woman with that blood of the issue of blood and tried to you know all the Physicians and spend all she had but amen just to be able to come up and Touch the Hem of His Garment isn't that right when she just touched the Hem of His Garment she was made oh praise the Lord how many knows others later on come to find out people won't just get into shadow of Peter amen and be healed so how many believe there's power in the body of Christ amen amen and so there's a lot of different things I want to try to bring and one of them of course amen is how that we treat one another in that body and be a part of that body of Christ amen I believe in the 17th chapter of Saint John Jesus said now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come unto thee Holy Father keep through thy own name Those whom thou has given me that they now know what is talking about that they may be one as we are one amen so let me know if it was Christ's desire many times you talked about this as I was is that those that are in that body that they would be one amen Hallelujah Hallelujah and you know whenever you're born into a family whenever you're born into a family we know that uh it's it's the order of God it's God's order is to be to have families to have a father to have a mother to have a man and a woman to come together and holy matrimony and bring forth children into the world and amen and to raise them and we find that in those in those families many times every one of our families those children their flesh of your flesh their bone of your bone their blood of your blood amen and so uh you know that family is is uh you know we say that nothing runs sicker than blood amen some people who want to stick up for their family no matter what and this that or the other and you know we're supposed to love one another one another no matter what isn't that right now we never we never stick up for each other's wrong amen we never never do that if you do that well you love your family more than you love Christ amen but you know we we have to learn to love on one another and we find out there's one thing about children is that they are all different we call it diversity isn't that right there's some so much diversity in one family amen you'll have the rambunctious one amen you'll have the outspoken one you'll have to silent The Quiet One you know and you'll have the sensitive one and you'll have the in unsensitive one and and all different personalities comes in a family and that's the way it is in the body in the body of Christ and he believes it's a whole lot of diversity that goes on God didn't make us all the same he didn't make us to look the same according to the prophet redheads blonde hair and all these different things different characters amen and sometimes those characters even you got to watch it it takes a lot of the Holy Ghost sometimes for you me to meet up with the person whose personality you clash with amen you just thought you your personalities just to kind of clash and you got to have a whole lot of the Holy Ghost ain't meant to be able to overlook that and to look past that and realize that you are brothers and sisters amen and I you feel to say this but I want you to understand that you're becoming a member of the second family on earth a priest uh what do you call precedes or or trumps your first family amen that's right because that second family is your Eternal family your natural family that's just your temporal family amen praise the Lord and we appreciate our families we should always love one another but remember this that there's a second birth there's a second family that takes place through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen and I'll tell you what like the prophet says he was a Branham I'm a buyer I never had to join the bylers and I wouldn't care how much my family tried to disown me I'd still get up in their face and say look I still got bottle of blood running through me all right whether you like me or whether you don't or whatever it is Amanda you might try to dis only but you're still my brother you're still my sister all right I'll tell you what maybe I'm just anxious that's one you know but anyway you know I just said you know that's your family you know and I believe in family family I believe you ought to stick together no matter what praise the Lord amen and love one another praise the Lord but you know our the name of our second anybody know the name of the second family that you joined not joined but born into amen the Lord Jesus Christ Family I miss that to be part of the family of the Lord Jesus Christ amen because guess what when we all got baptized hopefully you got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you received his spirit first be to God bitten better man say that you are if you are a son and daughter of God you are a seed Gene of almighty God in other words you carry the genetics of the man and that made knows how many billion galaxies our brother was talking about you carry that Gene and you have a characteristic of that Gene and I'm here to tell you this morning that that's what we come to church for is to find out who we are what we are and they become better at what we are to understand who we are in the greater measure and to act like our heavenly father does praise be to God oh my praise be to God and you know I was just thinking you know God is all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was what was it I forget the in morphe or something like that our Prophet talked about who she needs to empty yourself out Amen to empty himself out God emptied himself into Christ amen he was the fullness of Christ and when Christ went up into Glory he went back to the spirit that he was before he became his son amen and then he did well unto them Pentecost got emptied emptied himself out into a how we would have like I said a while ago how we would have loved to Touch the Hem of His Garment how we would have liked to be then or do like John prepared to their head on this on his chest and just hug him just be up close to him amen but let me tell you God still has a body that he dwells in God has a body and that body is you that body is me foreign oh man aren't you glad for that oh my let's just go into a little bit different thought here now and it's found in verse 28 if you have your Bibles and want to follow me you can First Corinthians 12 and we'll begin with verse 12. for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that body that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether it be Bond or free whether we're black or white or red ah or yellow it don't matter yellow black blue and white they're all precious in this site I mean please all Races all it don't matter when you're in that body it makes you a brother it makes you a sister whether you're Bond whether you're free and haven't been all made to drink into drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many amen and if the foot shall say because on the other hand I'm not the body is it therefore none of the body amen now we're not going to go through all of this it I I don't have time to go through it all but if you know the eye and the hand and everything and in this body amen there's all different members praise be to God all right and so he talks about you could talk about our Natural Body you can bring in this Natural Body talking and type it in here because he talks about fingers he talks about hands he talks about the head amen it's just because you're not a trustee just because you're not the song leader just because you're not the preacher that doesn't mean you're not nobody Amen Let me just convey this real heavily there's no big eyes and little use amen because I'll tell you what right now Jesus said if you give a cup of cold water to the least of these little ones you will not lose your reward he cares about each and every person that is in Christ amen so where Paul is making a point he says you know amen everybody I'll tell you what every part of the body is important hey man let me just say this comes to mind because I wanted to say it as I brought it into the local body in the local body of course I'm the head amen under Christ I'm the head of the church here voted in by y'all as being the pastor amen and so whenever a member listen if a member if a church if if somebody quits church do you realize it feels like somebody just cut off your thumb just cut off a fear because if they're apart you're supposed to be a part of the member it ought to hurt every one of us when somebody quits Church amen where they at they're gone so you see how I passed or you know after a while you just kind of get numb from losing fingers and hands yeah yeah because I don't care what church it is people's coming going all the time it seems like you know but I'll tell you what if it's because of the devil it's not a good thing amen not a good thing when the devil takes people out amen we're a part of each other and I want to focus on that with the help of the Lord today we want to understand each other because I want you to understand that a local body of Believers like this with with our musicians with our specials and and the atmosphere of the Lord and and just you sitting together there being together and the devil don't like it he doesn't like it one bit just like the devil doesn't like families look what he's doing with them I mean if the devil doesn't like marriages look at what he's doing with them somehow or another let me tell you something if you have a marriage that's sticking together it's because you have overcome things isn't that you've overcome Temptations of splitting up you've overcome many hard things that you've went through to where you know you almost might don't know if you can do it anymore amen you have to realize hey I'm married I ain't going nowhere huh and you have to overcome and you got to work through it that's why you have marriages that's why so many of them don't because the devil gets in there and when you've got a local body any local church like this I mean it is a real blessing it's a real blessing to be able to come to church hear music be sues hear the word preaching of the word being fed spiritually amen strength in your relationship amen your personal relationship with God and then your marital relation be strengthened your family be strengthened your children be taught amen it's just a real blessing and the devil don't like another thing I noticed that I didn't bring out a while ago brings back to my mind Hey man is there's another DNA test that you can take he says now no chasing Seamus to be joyous and depressing but if we are without chastise but the Bible says then we are bastards and not Sons so if we go take remember if a person does not take correction from the pope but they're not sons of God just tried to straighten it out they wouldn't they bring it for the church remember if they will not take correction they're not gods DNA find out whether you really have gone whether you can be corrected the chastise chasing amen praise the Lord so we look at that amen let's go to Matthew 18 Matthew 18. foreign about something that Paul said and Jesus said over in uh and that is how that we treat one another how we treat people that are in the body okay the first step you're talking about how we treat one another I believe one place brother man says you know as we serve one another we serve God is that right now talk about offenses for just a minute Matthew 18 and verse 5 is this and whosoever shall receive such a little child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him than a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea I asked Siri how heavy a will Stone was and it said that a millstone varies anywhere from a hundred to a thousand pounds so let's just take about halfway there you are out in the middle of the ocean deepest part the depth of the sea amen and you got about a 500 pound Millstone imagine that you see they would hang that hang you by the neck and throw you overboard with that 500 Stone pound stone and you would be drowned into the depth of the sea that's what Jesus how he feels about somebody affect ending one of his children wow wow doesn't the Bible say another placement he says he says touch not mine and not anointed and do my prophets no harm God feels the same way about his littleness of his children that if you do if you do the wrong thing if you say the wrong thing don't defend one of my children be better for you to be drowned in the lips of sea so how many believes we ought to be careful we do Paul said for this for this reason many are sickly and sleep among you for we do not discern the Lord's body but the bad come and says you know people don't discern the body of the Lord and we mistreat one another we do things wrong and end up dead it's pretty serious thing isn't it how many believes it's important because how many knows that Jesus Christ wants his body one thinking is one together loving each other just like a dad does his family a mom does his family they do anything to try to keep that family together amen to keep them loving one another running in unity how wonderful that is amen and especially in the house of God God wants everybody together amen I believe it was Paul says you know I hear that there's a divisions among you and I can't hardly believe it is Christ divided and so forth amen because God fight himself or the devil there's nothing more than the devil likes is to set this unity in a group of people amen you got to have Unity you got to be one you're part of the body of Christ amen amen for this many are sickly in many sleep for we do not discern the Lord's body amen remember over in Matthew 25 when the Judgment the great the Judgment Day comes he says you'll separate the sheep from the goats amen he says now and every time he mentions he says as you have done unto the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me how many believes as you do to each other what you say about each other you say about Christ amen how many beliefs we need to oh my what's it going to be on that day amen well and it goes back to showing us so much that if you can't say something good you don't say anything at all amen why amen that's right Discerning the Lord's body a millstone were hung about your neck but if you know on the other hand if you give a cup of cold water to one of these you will not lose your reward that's why amongst Believers we do anything that we can for each other don't we anything we can do for each other we do now I know people like to do things for preachers easy preachers so do it again you ought to do that for every son and daughter of God each and every one of us ought to do what we can amen for each other because we're part of that body of Christ amen oh praise the Lord you know something else um and I wanted to bring prayer into this amen because there's things in amen that the devil wants to do and tries to do amen and you know and that is get us to be prickly so to speak remember where brother bam says when you're not around water not around the right kind of preacher whether in this morning listen this morning is going to be certainly a passionate type of preaching and it's going to be something that is to keep the church clean how many believe that we want to keep the church clean keep the devil out I think we preacher uh not so long ago talking about making the devil rendering him powerless by not allowing him to get into your mind your senses your reason your conscience but if you guard all of those places you'll make it where he can't touch you but he uses your senses your feelings your memory and all those things amen and try to get in it to have a place to enter in and you know and the one thing that Jesus says all men know that you're my disciples if you have loved one for another he said one place he says a new commandment I give you that you love one another oh my I I'm getting a little mixed up because I really wanted to get into where talks about our diversities he says you know he gave that body helps and miracles and and all of these things all of these things he gives us he gives us gifts to benefit the church how many believe that he gives us everybody he gives everybody something you're something you do something for the body of Christ God didn't just he he didn't just save you to be no part you are part of the body if you're part of the body then you have something to do Amen to edify and to bless that body let me let me go down that road for a little pick up we'll pick up the love and the and the prayers in a minute amen but I want to go to if you will go to Ephesians with me the book of Ephesians Ephesians 4 and we're going to take our time here on this one Paul's saying I therefore chapter four of Ephesians I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that what that you are worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another putting up with each other in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace praise be to God for there is one body amen and one spirit I'm gonna stop right there folks I'm here to tell you the reason you have divisions is because there's two spirits right if you've got the same Spirit you all know that you can get along with somebody got the same Spirit again birds of a feather flocked together amen but if it's a wrong spirit amen there's one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling there's one Lord One Faith one baptism how many just one body one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but until every one of us give is giving Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he says when he ascended up on high he let captivity captive and gave gifts unto man now notice verse 11 he gave some Apostles and Prophets and evangelists pastors teachers now we know that he also over in uh we haven't read it but over in Corinthians the 12th chapter he talks about this diversity of gifts isn't that right he said some in the church prophets teachers miracle workers uh Gifts of healing helps government diversity of thongs and so forth are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers our old workers of Miracles basically what he's saying is no right he said are they all is everybody one thing no no not everybody's one thing amen have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues huh like the Pentecostal said everybody got Talking Tom no at all speaking tongues it just depends you all interpret and so forth so you see how this is also not just Apostles and Prophets and so forth but all these other things for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ praise be to God aren't you glad that that's what it does oh my how many has eaten without hands can you imagine if you didn't have hands to feed yourself you'd have to go eat out of a bowl no arms no hands you have to go down there and eat but thank me to God every you have a part Amen in every part of that body edifies or feeds or makes so that you're healthy if I forth God we've never said but you get carpal tunnel one time and now you'll still thank God for good good hands huh uh get get tennis elbow one time you'll be glad when you can go like that again huh but edit for every part it's the edify the body of Christ how many beliefs that's what we're here for and this morning I just want to say I'll tell you in a minute I want to say I'll tell you in a minute hopefully I won't forget now notice for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ to all should we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ praise the Lord that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fraud cared about with every window darkened by the slide of man and coming craft in this bar whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ how many beliefs that we have ahead that head is Christ now I want to dwell on this next verse and I'm going to try to tell you what I wasn't going to tell you a minute ago from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint and then I like that Paul when he's talking about the body he even talks about your joints hey man aren't you glad for joints I'd hate to think that I can't do anything I do not have elbows all right everything says right here no album I want to grab that I want to grab that you know praise God not only that but you got joined you got wrists look at that God Made You versatile when he made you I mean that for that oh my let me tell you something that's like Kevin drums that's the Kevin guitars that's like having uh uh deacons and trustees and everybody's place I can leave tomorrow I can just tell Sick Bay I'm gonna be gone and I ain't gonna say another word everything will be taken care of everybody does your job everybody that's awesome Amen and when we have this you know okay oh my you got Drums you got piano you got your organ you've got uh people singing you got people clapping their head or doing something for the body I mean every joint has a special place praise be to God and it does something to edify the body of Christ listen every joint supplier a Sunday school a lot of times we just don't never appreciate things do we I don't oh my God you know we're living in a selfish age aren't we we're living in a selfish age and I don't know about you but it wants to rub off on me I have to work at not being selfish huh do you have to work at not being selfish if you don't think you're selfish take a little harder look take a little harder look because it's hard to see how selfish we are but we're living in the age of self how many knows that then I say men will be lovers of themselves everybody when he comes right doing time most of the time we just think about ourselves that's the truth that's another thought I felt like the Lord wanted me to put in there not so much about the body or everybody around us amen but Lord help us to have the Holy Ghost to think about everybody around us the eternal life is living for others not yourself amen according to the effects of working in the measure of every part how many believe that what was it even our I'm not sure if it's Brian or Brother David talking about everybody that does something amen I think it was Brother David mentioning everybody that does something it makes it all come together it makes it all work praise be to God oh my every major of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love praise be to God I appreciate this morning I thank God for every part amen you know sometimes people don't come to church stay home they come don't come to church listen if we're looking for a body of Christ and half the body's gone well the arm's gone huh maybe I am in corner is gone foreign I thought about this and thinking about this you know I come from the Amish and I'll tell you what whenever you've got about four horses and you're riding on that riding plow I mean those Forest horses pulling brother John they just have to do a certain amount they don't have to do all that much money can go further that's why they use mortgage morning but when you got three like we did well you just see them back ham hocks remember my name you see them Moses muscles bulging a little bit more because they got to work harder at it now right if you've got two well they're just gonna really struggle them that's kind of how it is in our services a lot of time when you just got a few guess what the ones that are there they gotta really pull did you ever notice now big connections with everybody hey man hallelujah boy it's easy for the preacher to preach I still gotta figure a way for you to substitute a good old-fashioned pulling of a amen oh it's a boy I appreciate people supported with their ties their offering but you know you are also support it with your presence and you ought to support it with your Amen brother bam said if you want them they're sick him you gotta say amen mean second it means go get him it didn't mean raise your hands sometimes I gotta have a discernment to find out whether you're really getting what you're getting or not the Holy Ghost punctuated it's really not that hard folks they're pretty teach yourself to say Amen not out of line at all you didn't say say grin I don't think about it I don't I don't know what you're going to substitute an amen with how are you going to pull without a amen as a matter of fact can I preach it don't matter to me a bit whenever somebody yeah that's what preaching brother it don't bother me but it just gets me going Morehead but that does bother man it does bother I do believe that it hinders despair when you sit there with your arm folded like I'm not on a log no reaction at all I heard better man said the other day sometimes he'll go out here and he'll start preaching and he'll get the feel of how the people are reacting to what he says as to what he says no that's the first one I've heard him preach about many different things but get the feel of the people amen and see what it is where they're at and then go from there is that okay this morning we got a pool I may believe we need to pour together Sunday nights especially on our first Sunday of the month I like kind of so I felt that it was our Lord's will for us to have a first Sunday in a month and so forth but you know and I'll tell you what it's the hardest time Brother David we all know it's the hardest time aiming to have churches after you eat a big old meal that everybody's cooked that's so good with all of them good desserts and stuff I picked a different picture that's got to preach I don't say that I can't come up here if everybody's as quiet as a mouse even if I'm under the anointing God does it but I'm telling you it helps a lot more if you got amens and hallelujahs and people pulling how many believe me oh that's Paul amen everybody not just one not just the other one Scott Burt and dick that was the name of all horses at home now I'll tell you what if one black behind we had a whip whack everybody pull even Hallelujah I believe that's what we need to do let's not put it because it lost a lot of times while we do hey man will be pulling back and the other one is for a second going in that way but when everybody's pulling at the same time it makes for a good service the Holy Spirit the common that amen do what he does need to do praise the Lord all right can I read you a quote we're just getting started now notice you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you got tapes on the discipline of the church how to behave ourselves in church when we come together to sit together in Heavenly places he says don't stay home I've got wrote down here you know except for our elderly perhaps I can't make it out or perhaps a sick person that can't make it out and also the backslid [Music] that's right if you're streaming this morning and you could be in church you're backslid cause you can't pull out there I can't hear you and I can't feel you oh my is that okay praise the Lord now notice don't stay home and stream so I'm gonna put that in there all right when you can't be in the house of God if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open up out yonder engine for you to get in here to fellowship with your brothers another place he says man if you ain't got so much of the love of God in your heart amen until you almost weak when you leave out though sir when you leave one another by weeping a man can hardly leave one another we love each other so much that's what he says man you can't hardly wait if you've got God in your heart let's become blessed for us maybe God ain't there well you might say it is but if you had a reminder if you had a little bit a little bit more of the Holy Ghost it'll give you enough power to get in the shower to get dressed get in your car turn the key on and drive a few miles come to church say Amen pray the Lord's support to God and Paul and fight this devil that we're fighting get on the front line and be a lawyer quit pulling back don't go back don't sit down don't sit out I want to be right in the front line how we appreciate these people do hey man I appreciate brother Joe's prayer when it comes to church amen to sincerity Praise Him by the taught me what he's done I'm technical I ain't got no criticism of somebody trying to do something for God do something you're called to do something but it's important that you find what God wants you to do don't try to take somebody else's place and if God says have something for you to believe me he'll get you on the job if you'll open your heart up and find out what it is that God wants you to do because this is what makes all the difference this is the front line This is where we all pull this is what we all support isn't that right with everything we got because this is where families are made this is where Sinners are saved we don't need to be sitting here the doctors don't need to be sick when to sit coming here they should be able to be recovered but when we come in here and we're sick well then it's just not a whole lot of fun is it oh Hallelujah oh my that's right now listen to fellowship with your brothers and if you don't feel that way I'm telling you you better go to France why because you when you get on your knees I'll tell you them old thorns and them Briars and then that stickiness and that backslitting us and look up by the wayside I can't encourage you enough that in the local body it's important to have prayer Warrior people who pray if you know where you ought to be with God why don't you pray a little bit more it'll put the love of God in your heart it'll take the Spurs and the stickers and the complaining in the Marvel illegal by the wayside and it'll bring a floor a nice wonderful sauce rose with fragrance and people who want to be around you 40. and you'll want to be around people but when you get her when you get back sled you don't want to go to church you don't want to be around people because you're miserable you don't feel like it you know you get right with God you want to share your life hug somebody oh give me that old time Legend it makes me love everybody [Music] amen Lord help us there ought to be shouts in the house of God there ought to be amens in the house of God amen then you better get to pray because we're in the last days the Bible exalted us that we ought to come together so much some more as we see that they're approaching to love one another with Christian love divine love to our assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places and to love one another time but this all men know that you're my disciples if you've got love one for another all the gifts the different things we do that's all fine but Paul said I'll show you a better way amen you up need charity you determine charity amongst yourself because charity is the bond of the purpose of a group or a family it's the bond that ties them together it's the clue that glues them together laughs you lose your love find out how quickly you flake off a church lose your love for God that's why you need to go to pray it amen praise the Lord Brother Branham typed it when he was preaching on Ephesians Parish parallels Joshua and he was talking about Joshua when he went into the land took Jericho and dropped the walls of Jericho isn't that right amen without losing all they had to do was March and sing and grow trumpets right listen he says in that sort of church is failing today on that wall do you know that even your behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You Believers can cause this check to bitterly fail and on the day of judgment you'll read me Municipal foreign with the right heart you need to cut your sins confess you need to be clean when you come whoo he talks about dwighted those innocent men die because one man stepped out of line you see the reason this needs to be taught the church lining up with the word of God lining up with God and lining up with each other how maybe we got to be left up with each other as the body of Christ when your body everything needs to be in order amen when one finger hurts the whole body hurts amen the robotic focuses on that isn't that right Brother Band says don't never let a little ISM or a little something another a little bad feeling rise up among you not even a bad feeling needs to be among you get it out quick right now oh my it's a little foxes that's fals Divine keep it out of the way those little funny feelings why have half a church when you can have a whole church why is that the substitute when the skies are full of the real oh my we don't want that you have a little funny feeling ever comes up among new members one to another God or that person and so forth amen now unless he says Satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished on Earth I mean when you've got a glocal group and you've got a bite I need to cry the devil will never stop trying he will always try until you finish on Earth just remember that you'll never have a time but what you're punching a punching is going on all the time cause you're in a bottle did you come to Christ and be on the picnic no we're the battlefield brother amen this isn't the picnic it's a Battlefield praise be to God oh my just one listen to this that's right stay right together Christ is the mystery of Christ revealed if a brother or sister is a little wrong or a sister let me just say this this is the way I thought about it sometimes we say things we ought to say somebody makes a statement that says something they shouldn't and it takes us off or we don't like it hello sometimes us sometimes we do things that sin sometimes we do things that's wrong [Music] but we do we write that family member off because of a dude with free condemnation oh they ain't got a deal I think no good no don't do that cause I'll tell you what if they did that for you and for me we'd be gonna run it no you're praying for that person say God help us I'm praying for you brother I'm praying for you sister no you don't condone the wrong and you want the wrong life but don't never build up a complex isn't that right oh my they're a little wrong don't never let me have a root of bitterness spring up oh my never how many knows I've been in US hey man it is a root of bitterness that is oh it'll take Christ listen it'll take Christ right out of my life it'll affect that person that poison eyes the acids of malice and jealousy and hatred it'll just take the Holy Spirit right away from you how many of the second you allow yourself to get bitter amen the Holy Spirit leaves the second you allowed bitterness to take a hold of your heart the Holy Spirit left that's why we need prayer because prayer sweetens it changes you when you come from the presence of the prayer you can't come back out and have thought and bitterness against people or you never went deep enough in your prayer oh my listen it'll just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it'll run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God and drive him away from here oh my moms and dad y'all know when there's fussing and fuming going amongst the kids boy it sure brings a damper on the whole thing don't it you try to get that brother that sister to get right when they're playing together and have fun together then Mom and Dad smiling amen that's right Unity don't let her let a root of bitterness don't ever let it even come in it'll drive this spirit away from here you'll wonder why we ain't got Revival that's why we ain't got Revival one person can affect the whole church and guess what better band says you'll answer for it on the day of judgment for your attitude how many believes that the Holy Spirit brings the right attitude it brings a gentle sweet atmosphere amen and bitterness and hatred it brings the wrong spirit causes people not to get what they need when they come to church hey man why are you saying this brother bottle I'm not saying because we were in that state I'm saying heads up he'll never stop trying so everyone one of us got to have our guards up Lord if we want to have a good judge if we will have a powerful judge if we want to have a real judge we got to keep the Devils out we gotta get the attitude right local church with everything you got best chance we have of defeating the devil amen Hallelujah oh yeah now notice it'll kill the spirit of God and drive it from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything don't do that you just wax that much closer together and then I preached a couple weeks ago that God wants more preparing more fruit now we want to last closer together how many we need to walk closer together love one another they're more than what we do oh brother Donnie Reagan and some of that sad stuff probably all up in there great big church but when you got a small group it affects a whole lot more because it don't take long and half of them is affected amen it can affect 50 100 people in the big churches and you'll never even know it ah but I know he preaches this and I know he tries to get that out of there too hey man ain't nobody wants all of that up in there praise your God amen all right now notice are you ready all right wax that much closer together grow up amen praise him get it up a little talk a little closer together tighten tighten up move right up close one to another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless how many dollars that whenever Joshua man they were so plastic defeated Derek on the walls came down because they were all in harmony but when Aiken stepped out of line when he stepped out of line and did that's in 36 men lost their lives on a little bitty battle amen praise the Lord amen all right last quote how many beliefs forgiveness is important in a home in the family in the body it is absolutely vital that you have forgiveness and it takes prayer how many believes it takes care of prayer and the Holy Ghost to have that forgiveness one for another because we will do things wrong we're human as long as we're here we'll make mistakes but it's how we deal with those mistakes and things amen and we need prayer to softness I come to The Garden Alone while the deer are still on the Roses amen and he walks with me and talks with me amen and he tells me I am his own when we come from there it's just a whole different atmosphere prayer brings love amen praise be to God now listen brother bam says shortly after all these years on the field and around the world I'm seeing different people I know a little bit about what get to internet if you want to get somewhere with God don't live in it an arrogant Spirit ever come around you that no let No Malice come in no matter what anybody's done if they're wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person amen you be sweet and kind remember God loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of God's in you you love the other person when he is in the wrong amen remember the scripture said what place he says you know uh if somebody's done you wrong even if Christ has forgiven you forgive them laughs but again I have come to the conclusion a long time ago that I can afford I can afford a lot of forgiveness I can afford it why can I afford it because a lot was forgiven me I'm gonna tell you right now there was more forgiveness given me than I'll ever forgive amen isn't that right that's right when you think about how much God forgives you forgives you every day isn't that right how many how many with me oh he begins me all the time hey man so you can afford to forgive others things that you think that God wouldn't hardly even give you for he forgive you you grieved him away from you so many times and he forgave you came right back in you built up internet Soul folks can I say something that just comes to mind if you have bitterness in your heart and you overcome it God will allow that he'll heal loud another bitterness to come your way to see whether you can really conquer that or not until you learned hey I ain't gonna let that bitterness come on in Hale keeps strengthening and strengthening and the strengthening amen and you yeah I can't test you on bitterness outside of somebody doing you wrong or saying something about you that you don't like wouldn't it be nice for the John if we had a mouth that always said the perfect thing every time never said anything to you that would be so nice no not Thomas Byler in his rum bunches they don't call me rhombus for nothing rather than Martin I don't know why God ever wanted me to be a pastor brother but here I am two rumbas two two rough too rough cut Amish come from up the north some of them both Northern people they ain't got very soon much sensitive I don't know how you all put up with me I have no idea but anyway we try we just want to serve God right my hearts are desires Lord show me where I'm a little tumor on this yet take that away Lord Jesus and help me to stay sweet and kind no matter what what comes or what goes I let me see yeah I'm coming down to something I want to say here amen be sweet and kind remember God loved you but I like this this is like I put in highlights above everything Church above everything love God and love one another above everything I mean it was rather than having all the gifts of Miracles and healings and all these other things that's all important it's all your apartment above everything Paul even said make sure that you have fervent charity amongst yourselves how many could use a little bit more of that love I need I need to one I need to love God more are you with me how many of these love God more because then I can love my brother more man it would be a failure wouldn't the brother Brad to try to love my brother more when I don't love God the way I should I don't think he would even do it amen but if you love God even when the more you love God I thought of that song and I want to sing it amen makes me love everybody give me that old-time religion give me the old time Holy Spirit oh my I don't feel the devil anywhere close to me right now nowhere close to me at all it's just somewhere else right because the devil walked on there when you got the Holy Ghost he can't even come close I don't feel no Spirit of defensive I don't feel sad I don't feel any of that why because I got the Holy Ghost the devil cake on there the reason people say it and that's good enough for me so give me that all-time Holy Spirit amen praise the Lord how many we need more of it more of that Holy Ghost amen let's support our church amen support each other amen love one another praise be to God like I said there's no big eyes and little use I don't care if it's the pastor if it's me or if his sister Mary Jane amen amen those that clean amen every one of you how we appreciate you we appreciate you amen God will bless you for picking up some of that dirt and that dust that we get on our feet and everything else amen others have a feeling of leading on doing or whatever it is we're all part of the body of Christ we all want to do our part maybe maybe you never get mentioned maybe I don't mention you this morning but I want to mention you if this is you maybe you're that prayer Warrior I mean I know brother Glenn he says I pray for you all the time brother amen we need those prayer warriors because Prayer Changes Things somebody please Prayer Changes Things yesterday I don't know why you know my emotions and my feelings I was just kind of down and I just said Lord I just don't feel like I'm as close as to you as I'm I'm not happy about it Lord help me help me to get closer to you again Lord I you know I haven't done anything I don't know but I'm just kind of you know don't feel like I am on it and I'll tell you what last night and this morning God begin to answer that prayer and he got me all fired up hey man they're feeling good again amen I don't know if you ever get that way brother Russell or not you just kind of feel lonely and and kind of town-hearted or whatever just you know you just don't feel like you you know feel God Like You should well if you don't give an idea just come down and you need to take out how I'm feeling by the time he knows get away from God a little bit you get on your knees and say God I want to feel you more I want to I Wanna I wanna I Wanna Be On Fire for you Lord I don't want to be feeling like this God will answer it hey man I I had that on my heart about Lynn about the body of Christ and I had just a few thought little thoughts and I said well that's awful shallow I sure'd like to have something deeper Lord if you take me deeper Lord take me take me into more and then all of this is poured on me amen I said well there's not just about the local body and appreciating everybody we do appreciate everybody from from but it doesn't matter who it is what you're doing you're appreciate it and God will bless you for those things amen but then thinking about how that we got to keep ourselves clean keep all bitterness out all malice out keep the wrong thoughts out keep the right attitude are you with me now notice above everything love God and love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless it it's hard telling what he'll do comment is with me this morning I'd sure like to see God do more you see God in a greater way coming with me say almost say loving say in the spirit again he says Christ miss you love one another above everything no matter what the devil tries to do or say you're one great big sweet group but remember my warning the devil won't write you stay that way no sir foreign like you should he hates that he hates his church he hates you [Music] and I'm so glad I'm so glad he hates us because I sure wouldn't want to have to say he loves me no I I left I I Rejoice because when I say I'm glad it's because I'm thinking of another part and that is that God loves me God loves you and if God loves you you can be against you that's the important part is that God loves you well praise be to God amen but God loves you and if he loves you and you love him we love one another we are a body we're a family how many of these are our family I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God a lot of your family members aren't sitting here I don't know why but how many knows Holy Ghost people love the Holy Ghost people birds of a feather flock together amen I wish everyone in my family was right here with me I sure would amen praise be to God we'll try to wrap it up no matter what the devil trusts now notice you say right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved to a woman whoever the devil tries to use pray for them and just stick one with another and stay with your pastor stay with your pastor see now I don't really I don't read this this part very often see he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through cause he's ordained of God to do so I thought brother by of all the bad thing of all the poor pastors that I have thought that I have been when I read that something quicker to me and I said you know look at what's happened over the last 30 years huh we made it through every hurdle didn't we amen because the pastor and it's ordained of God will take you through whatever comes he'll take you through amen and we can say amen God has helped us to make it through many things isn't that right how many beliefs if he's ordained of God he's ordained to take you through not just amen because there's so many things that can topple a person isn't that right but if amen that's all I just I just thought Lord thank you for taking us through but Lord bless your name Lord Jesus just comes to mind I'm gonna say well how many believes that I'm looking for is to take us to the skies one of these days I'm looking for a Rapture I'm looking for a party change but before that body change Comes This flash has to come into obedience it's got to come subject to the word before it to be subject to the skies and that's what we're working on that's why we come to church that's why you listen to Somebody ball you out a little bit about this I don't know once in a while we need correction I need correction amen amen how many believe we ought to pull together after today let's pull together that much more amen and pull harder amen now do you remember that the very next thing after that quote he says now remember that the enemy will come but what he does just cling that much closer together amen amen praise the Lord oh Mike praise the Lord God bless you this morning amen praise the Lord musicians if you will stand with me tonight this morning thank everybody amen this morning for being a part of that body for everything that you do may God bless you and reward you and with an eternal reward amen let's keep pressing this battle together amen let's keep pressing together Let's Stay Together we are together I can say this morning we are together but let's just wax that much closer together amen and keep the devil out amen keep the devil out what was it there was one thing uh amen I wanted to read Joshua called whenever those 16 men died he called for Asylum assembly he said there's something wrong God made the promise there's something wrong he knew after those men God did something wrong isn't that right he says when we bring the sick up before us and they fail to get be healed we need to call for a solemn assembly fast call and assembly something wrong somewhere God made the promise God's got to stick to his promise but I thought that was good if people fail to get healed I mean if you fail to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost then let's say God wants his what's hindering amen what's hindering it's a good question to ask amen Lord show me would everybody say that this morning with My Heart Lord if I'm a hindrance show me Lord I do not want to be a hindrance I don't want to I don't want to cause a hindrance to the Church of the Living God for the body of Christ amen praise the Lord because whenever you get Corporal tunnel well I'll tell you that finger can't go down all the way it hurts amen that thing needs to be healed I mean please it needs to be fixed amen so they can properly do what it's supposed to do and that's the way it is that you know we're not worried where we should be we pray God take that thing and take care of it so it can operate the way we should Lord Jesus this morning we come without heads father this morning with the Grateful hearts Lord Jesus just to believe and to know that God that Lord your Prophet Paul said that you know uh your spirit Bears record with our spirit Lord that when we have your Holy Spirit Bears record that we are the children of God enlarged in thinking to believe and to know that we are part of your body God that you're working through that you're living through manifesting yourself through God and that you're finishing this final race through this group of people that's here this morning Lord we raise our hands and say God help me to yield more greatly to you Lord help me to love my brothers my sisters for a woman I love them I Love You Lord and why the way I treat other people other believers God that's the way we treat you Lord and we ask God this morning you would ever cause us to wax so much closer and stronger to you father Lord so that when the Seeker prayed for they would be healed there would be nothing between my soul and my savior Lord that day we could see the manifestation of your power Lord in this church into this group of people this local body God that you have ordained to be here Lord we ask in Jesus Christ's Name Lord that you use us father that we just be Lord the the vine Lord or the the branches and you're the vine Lord Jesus may we bury I'm not where I ought to be Lord father where I slack off Lord Jesus in my prayer life and where I don't have as much love as what I should father I should love my brothers and sisters in a greater way Lord and I need to love you first more father forgive us this morning Lord and completely help us Lord this morning Jesus rendered to you you see the hands and the hearts just now as we give ourselves commit ourselves to you in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen can I sing a song with you amen number 63 it's the old-time Holy Spirit [Music]
