[0:00] but i'll jump around
[0:02] but this is paul in first corinthians
[0:04] talking about
[0:06] his experience with jesus christ
[0:09] and you know in churches all over the
[0:11] world they'll be reading from
[0:13] from john they'll be reading from luke
[0:16] you know and even mark or and reading
[0:18] from isaiah 53 but i just thought i'd
[0:22] read out of uh corinthians just like
[0:24] brother branham was prophet to us in
[0:26] this last age paul was the prophet to
[0:29] the gentile
[0:30] church that we all are a part of this
[0:33] morning
[0:35] i'll try to jump around you'll have to
[0:36] forgive me if i don't and paul said here
[0:38] in the first verse of the 15th chapter
[0:40] of corinthians
[0:42] i'm all over brethren i declare unto you
[0:44] the gospel which i preach unto you which
[0:47] you also have received and wherein you
[0:49] stand but by which also you are saved if
[0:52] you keep in memory what i have preached
[0:54] on to you unless you have believed in
[0:57] vain you know
[0:58] you know preach
[1:00] teachers could take that very verse and
[1:02] talk about the message every hour that
[1:04] we're holding to a truth that's been
[1:05] revealed to us in the age that we're in
[1:07] for i delivered unto you first of all
[1:09] which i also received how christ died
[1:12] for our sins according to the scriptures
[1:14] and that's the whole purpose of easter
[1:17] this morning and he goes on to say that
[1:20] he was buried and he rose again the
[1:23] third day according to the scriptures
[1:25] and that he was seen of cepis and the
[1:27] twelve
[1:28] and after he was seen above 500 brother
[1:30] and
[1:31] of one
[1:33] of whom the greater part remain unto us
[1:36] present but some have fallen asleep so
[1:38] paul is talking about how he's
[1:41] some of them people are still alive
[1:43] today
[1:44] and that that he was seen of james and
[1:45] all the apostles
[1:47] the last he was all seen
[1:49] at last of all he was seen of me also
[1:51] was one born out of due time for i am
[1:54] the last of the apostles
[1:56] i am not me to be called an apostle
[1:58] because i have persecuted the church of
[2:00] god and that goes back to what i was
[2:02] saying paul's experience with jesus
[2:04] christ this morning was by revelation
[2:06] where god reveals himself to paul and we
[2:09] all know you can go back to acts in
[2:11] ninth chapter and you can read how jesus
[2:14] christ revealed himself to paul are we
[2:16] all like paul you know we all have our
[2:18] own relationship with jesus christ this
[2:20] morning he reaches people in different
[2:23] ways and different walks of life but
[2:25] it's still the same really it has to be
[2:28] the same where god comes into the heart
[2:30] of that individual he goes on to say
[2:32] here but
[2:34] by the grace of god i am what i am and
[2:37] his grace which he was bestowed upon me
[2:39] was not in vain but i labored more
[2:42] abundantly than they all yet not i but
[2:45] the grace of god which was with me and
[2:47] everyone here this morning we all stand
[2:50] very simply
[2:51] in the grace of god this morning none of
[2:53] us can live without god's grace this
[2:56] morning and he goes on therefore whether
[2:58] or not
[2:59] where i or they as we preach so you
[3:02] believed now if christ be preached that
[3:05] he rose from the dead house well i'll
[3:07] stop there he's i'll jump over here
[3:11] to about the 20 about the 19th verse
[3:14] here
[3:15] if in his life only we have hope incred
[3:18] in this life
[3:20] only we have hope in christ we are all
[3:22] men most miserable but now is christ
[3:24] risen from the dead and become the first
[3:26] fruits of them that sleep
[3:28] from since by mankind death by man also
[3:31] man also came the resurrection of dead
[3:34] for
[3:35] as in adam all died even so in christ
[3:38] all shall be made alive
[3:40] but every man is in his own order christ
[3:42] the first fruits afterwards they that
[3:44] are christ after is coming
[3:46] you know i'll stop there i don't want to
[3:49] take a lot of time this morning but i
[3:51] was just thinking this morning this
[3:53] easter morning
[3:55] that god has all given us a great gift
[3:57] this morning and that's himself
[3:59] and uh if you've got that gift that god
[4:02] has revealed himself in your heart this
[4:04] morning and in your life you can count
[4:06] yourself one of the blessed this morning
[4:08] that god has thought enough of you in
[4:10] this age to reveal himself to you and to
[4:13] show you a path that you need to walk
[4:15] this morning

[44:51] in those doors lord and we just ask god
[44:53] you'd help me just to get out of the way
[44:55] lord that you might speak to your people
[44:57] once again so that we could say the same
[44:59] as they did on the road of emmaus lord
[45:01] did not our hearts burn within us as he
[45:03] spoke to us along the way because we
[45:05] believe you're the same yesterday today
[45:08] and forever
[45:09] in jesus christ's name amen and amen
[45:13] amen turn your bibles if you will
[45:16] amen we will go to the book of mark i
[45:18] want to read two scriptures to begin
[45:20] with and it's kind of a different type
[45:23] of thought i guess but we do want to
[45:25] uh speak on what east really means is
[45:29] that okay
[45:30] amen and i want to title this i believe
[45:33] i believe
[45:35] amen
[45:36] amen how many believers this morning
[45:39] i believe amen
[45:41] praise be to god amen because if you
[45:44] didn't
[45:45] you'd be damned
[45:47] you'd be doomed amen it'd be a sad day
[45:50] if you didn't believe
[45:52] and that's grace i believe that's grace
[45:56] amen
[45:58] it was grace that taught my heart to
[45:59] fear amen
[46:01] amen in mark and we'll begin with
[46:05] we'll skip on down a little bit right to
[46:08] verse
[46:09] 9.
[46:12] write to verse 9
[46:15] chapter 16 of mark
[46:17] now
[46:18] when jesus was risen
[46:20] early the first day of the week he
[46:22] appeared first to mary magdalene
[46:25] out of whom he had cast seven devils
[46:28] and she went and told them that had been
[46:30] with him as they mourned
[46:33] and wept
[46:34] and they when they had heard that he was
[46:36] alive and had been seen of her
[46:39] believe not
[46:41] after that he appeared in another form
[46:44] unto the two of them as they walked and
[46:45] went into the country
[46:48] and they went and told it to the residue
[46:50] neither believed they them
[46:53] afterwards he appeared unto the eleven
[46:55] as they sat at me and afraid them with
[46:58] their unbelief
[47:00] and hardness of heart because they
[47:01] believed not them which had seen him
[47:04] after he was risen amen
[47:08] let me just say this can you imagine
[47:11] that was for that they think about how
[47:13] that jesus came and proved himself
[47:16] that he's alive in this generation
[47:20] and the people still don't believe it
[47:22] the world church world wouldn't believe
[47:24] it even though he proved it
[47:27] and you say thomas was bad thomas wasn't
[47:30] bad he believed when he's all people can
[47:33] see it they still don't believe
[47:37] and i want to say this that's why the
[47:39] world's in the shape it is is because
[47:40] the church world
[47:42] amen
[47:43] the ocean came in
[47:45] eve the waves came in they let it in
[47:48] amen they chose a barabbas
[47:51] rather than jesus
[47:53] my my my
[47:54] and he said unto them go into all the
[47:57] world and preach the gospel every
[47:58] creature he that believeth and is
[47:59] baptized shall be saved and he that
[48:02] believeth not shall be damned then these
[48:04] signs shall follow them that believe in
[48:05] my name they shall cast out devils they
[48:08] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[48:09] take up serpents and if they drink any
[48:12] deadly thing it shall not harm hurt them
[48:14] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[48:16] they shall recover
[48:18] suddenly after the lord had spoken unto
[48:20] them he was received up into heaven and
[48:22] sat at the right hand of god
[48:24] and they went forth and preached
[48:25] everywhere the lord working with them
[48:27] and confirming the word with signs
[48:29] following
[48:30] amen of course we see this happening
[48:33] amen after the book of acts amen
[48:38] in mark 9
[48:41] mark 9 i believe it is
[48:48] verse 17 mark 9 and 17.
[48:55] and one of the multitude
[48:57] answered and said master i have brought
[48:59] unto thee my son which hath a dumb
[49:02] spirit and who wheresoever he taketh him
[49:06] he teareth him he foameth and gnashes
[49:09] with his teeth and pineth away and i
[49:11] spake to thy disciples that they should
[49:13] cast him out and they could not and he
[49:15] answered him and said o faithless
[49:18] generation how long shall i be with you
[49:20] how long shall i suffer you bring him
[49:23] unto me
[49:25] and they brought him unto him
[49:26] [Music]
[49:28] and when he saw him straight with his
[49:30] spirit tear him and he fell on the
[49:31] ground and wallowed foaming and he asked
[49:34] his father how long is it since this
[49:36] came on him upon him and he said of a
[49:39] child and oftentimes it has cast him
[49:42] into the fire and into the waters to
[49:44] destroy him but if thou canst do
[49:46] anything he have compassion on us
[49:49] and help us
[49:50] and jesus said unto him if thou canst
[49:52] believe all things are possible to him
[49:55] that
[49:56] believeth amen
[49:58] praise the lord that we're going to
[50:00] focus on that word believe this morning
[50:02] is that okay
[50:04] amen because it's a very important word
[50:07] and straightway the father of the child
[50:09] cried out and said with tears
[50:13] lord
[50:14] this is my title i believe
[50:18] i believe
[50:20] amen help thou
[50:23] mind unbelief
[50:24] and when jesus saw the people came
[50:26] running together he rebuked the foul
[50:28] spirit saying
[50:30] thou diamond death spirit i charge she
[50:32] come out of him and after and enter no
[50:35] more into him and the spirit cried and
[50:37] read him sore and came out of him and he
[50:40] was as one dead in as much as the man he
[50:42] said he is dead
[50:43] but just jesus took him by the hand and
[50:45] he lifted him up and he arose amen may
[50:49] god add his blessings to the reading of
[50:50] the word you can be seated this morning
[50:53] amen god bless you this morning first
[50:57] i'd like to say this morning that we're
[50:58] grateful and i want to talk a little bit
[51:00] before we get perhaps a little bit more
[51:02] about in the in the in the area of i
[51:05] believe
[51:06] amen we want to first talk about what
[51:09] easter
[51:10] means it does not mean amen uh you know
[51:13] that we just go out there and have a
[51:16] easter bunny and a or a egg hunt and
[51:19] things like that you know the prophet of
[51:20] god called all of that foolishness isn't
[51:22] that right because ain't no rabbit or no
[51:24] chicken got nothing to do with no easter
[51:26] amen no resurrection but people have
[51:29] taken and making something else about it
[51:32] but we realized that easter and what
[51:34] easter was all about was god coming down
[51:36] isn't that right amen this morning the
[51:38] very resurrection friday night i guess
[51:40] it had been friday he was uh he was
[51:43] killed and he was he was uh
[51:46] crucified and killed and so forth and
[51:48] put in a tomb and there he lay for about
[51:51] you know
[51:52] until the third day friday saturday and
[51:55] within those 72 hours or within the
[51:58] three days we know that he rose again
[52:02] but you know he was doing something and
[52:04] he one place he said thomas or or to
[52:07] this disciples he says you know because
[52:08] they didn't want him to leave
[52:10] i mean they wanted jesus to stay they
[52:13] wanted him to be the king and and all
[52:15] the and i can't imagine i don't know
[52:17] just what in the world it was that the
[52:19] disciples had in their mind
[52:22] that was going to happen with the
[52:23] ministry of jesus right
[52:26] and where are they going to go with this
[52:28] right what's going to happen with this
[52:30] because he talked about going away he
[52:32] talked about being crucified amen and
[52:34] thomas says you know not thomas but
[52:36] peter says no that's never going to
[52:38] happen you know
[52:39] you know we don't want that to happen we
[52:40] want to be
[52:41] you know betrayed in the sinful hands of
[52:43] into the sinful hands of man and so
[52:45] forth and you know but even jesus
[52:47] rebuked him for that and he says you
[52:48] know it's expedient
[52:50] [Music]
[52:51] it is necessary
[52:54] that i go away
[52:56] because if i don't go away the comfort
[52:59] can't come
[53:01] amen
[53:04] praise the lord when i thought about
[53:05] that not just a comforter but salvation
[53:07] couldn't come forgiveness couldn't come
[53:10] peace couldn't come
[53:12] grace couldn't come
[53:15] if he doesn't go away he doesn't pay the
[53:18] price
[53:19] amen
[53:21] praise the lord i want to read the
[53:22] scripture this morning
[53:24] amen not a scripture but a quote that
[53:26] the prophet of god made that
[53:29] you know kind of took me off of
[53:32] on my message that i
[53:34] thought about listen so he says here now
[53:36] he says i've often thought the prophet
[53:38] says i've often thought what would i do
[53:41] if i had two drops of the blood of your
[53:44] son in a glass or a charger in my hand
[53:47] the literal drops of the blood from
[53:49] calvary how my tears would run down my
[53:52] cheeks as i held it knowing that i had
[53:54] in my hands the blood of jesus christ
[53:58] any charger
[54:01] amen
[54:03] i'm because what is it you think about
[54:05] that because i know it was the blood i
[54:07] know it was the blood amen amen christ
[54:10] our redeemers died on the cross amen we
[54:13] know that everything that blood had
[54:15] forgiveness power that healing power
[54:18] it was god's own blood
[54:20] and he thought there would be such a
[54:22] treasure to have it
[54:24] he says but listen in a charger but
[54:26] tonight in thy sight according to the
[54:29] scripture i believe that it's greater
[54:32] for i hold the purchase
[54:34] of your blood your children
[54:38] amen so how many know that it was more
[54:41] what he had bought what he bought with
[54:43] what he did
[54:45] was greater to him
[54:47] than what he had had to spend to get it
[54:50] so you think about this morning i just
[54:52] want to focus on that thinking about
[54:54] what we have what that blood part
[54:59] how many believe that when he shed that
[55:01] blood when they put that spear in his
[55:03] side and that blood came out
[55:06] that was the purchasing power that was
[55:09] the buying power
[55:11] god was buying something
[55:14] he was paying for something
[55:17] he used his blood to pay for something
[55:21] how many know we were all adam the first
[55:23] adam sold us all into the devil's pawn
[55:26] shop and the devil had rights on you
[55:33] he had rights on you
[55:35] in other words and he had we had uh uh
[55:38] you know we had coming to a nature by
[55:39] our first birth and so forth amen that
[55:42] we could never get away from that nature
[55:44] he had a right on your nature that's why
[55:46] all through the old testament they could
[55:48] kill all the lambs and the sheep and the
[55:50] goats they could kill all they wanted to
[55:52] it would never change their nature
[55:56] and when he paid that price it was
[55:58] exceeding it was necessary that he goes
[56:01] because if he didn't go you could never
[56:03] have a nature church
[56:05] [Applause]
[56:10] think about it and the devil would
[56:11] always have rights you would go out the
[56:13] next day and do the same thing again
[56:18] no matter how much you believed
[56:20] how much you tried they would have to
[56:23] come back the next year make another
[56:25] sacrifice for the same things over and
[56:27] over
[56:28] again but when he paid that remember he
[56:31] paid for sin he paid for unbelief he
[56:34] paid for the price so that you could be
[56:36] free from it
[56:40] you could have a divine nature this
[56:43] morning
[56:45] and the devil doesn't have any rights
[56:47] with you anymore
[56:52] it was necessary that it goes away
[56:56] he paid for your fellowship he paid for
[56:59] your redemption remember in the book of
[57:00] revelations the fifth chapter he was the
[57:03] redeemer and islam was the redeemer
[57:06] to bring us back to god again
[57:09] back to what fellowship with god how
[57:11] many faithful to have fellowship with
[57:14] god
[57:18] what a privilege
[57:19] and not have to be in the devil's pawn
[57:21] shop anymore
[57:24] oh he purchased our salvation on
[57:27] calvary's tree he bought it
[57:29] how many knows when he's dropped when
[57:31] his blood dropped on the earth he paid
[57:34] for this very earth again
[57:40] is his
[57:41] your earth is his your body's his
[57:45] he paid for it all
[57:47] he just hasn't claimed it yet
[57:50] i'm he's looking for that claim i'm
[57:52] waiting for that claim to be made
[57:55] now in our spirits and in our souls we
[57:57] have already been redeemed to god but
[57:59] these bodies they're still carnal
[58:03] we're groaning we're still waiting for
[58:05] this to be redeemed
[58:08] oh but he hated
[58:09] one thing he did that's what easter
[58:11] means
[58:13] it means he pawned us
[58:15] brought us back out of the pawn shop he
[58:17] took away the devil's power to hold you
[58:20] i was listening yesterday he says jesus
[58:22] went down on saturday night he went down
[58:25] to the pit
[58:26] of hell and the devil's doorstep and he
[58:29] come in there and the devil says you
[58:30] know he says i finally got you i
[58:32] couldn't get you in abel i couldn't get
[58:34] you in all the prophets i killed but i
[58:35] finally got he says i want you to know
[58:37] my blood is fresh on calvary i'm the
[58:40] urgent born son of god and i have paid
[58:42] the price and you give me the keys of
[58:44] hell and you give me the keys of death
[58:47] so to speak he went up there and grabbed
[58:49] him by the neck and pushed him up
[58:50] against the wall grabbed the excuse off
[58:52] the side all right they belong to me now
[58:55] isn't that right and he grabbed him and
[58:57] gave him a good kick into the jail cell
[58:59] and slammed the door he let kept him and
[59:02] he got them
[59:04] glory aren't you glad for that that he
[59:06] let captivity captive and he gave gifts
[59:08] to you and i
[59:11] and now we don't have to fear death hell
[59:13] the grave
[59:17] you gotta fear no more
[59:20] you don't have to fear dying
[59:24] you don't have to fear any
[59:28] of that death
[59:30] people go gladly people go with a smile
[59:32] on their face now
[59:34] paul
[59:35] he says you know death where is your
[59:37] sting oh grave where is your victory
[59:40] amen
[59:42] praise be to god aren't you glad for
[59:44] that
[59:45] took the keys off of him locked him up
[59:48] took the key to come back up in the come
[59:50] up and he's got that now we know the
[59:52] keys of the kingdom were given to peter
[59:54] isn't that right
[59:55] he unlocked the keys that the kingdom of
[59:57] heaven on
[59:58] and on the day of pentecost
[1:00:00] in the book of acts repent every one of
[1:00:02] you
[1:00:04] praise be to god
[1:00:06] another thing he did another thing he
[1:00:07] was doing while he was here
[1:00:10] as the prophet of god said you know that
[1:00:13] every great disease that
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:17] we have
[1:00:19] you know many different diseases that
[1:00:20] we've had that people and uh just this
[1:00:24] last one just to talk about covet and
[1:00:26] and so forth
[1:00:29] and how that they would work at what was
[1:00:31] it called speed to try to come up with
[1:00:32] an antidote
[1:00:37] anyway it was trump's call this
[1:00:39] lightning speed let's get it up let's
[1:00:40] find one quick right
[1:00:42] well maybe they should have taken more
[1:00:44] time because i ain't got a whole lot of
[1:00:45] confidence in what's going on here
[1:00:48] right
[1:00:50] but anyway you know it's but anyways
[1:00:52] just penicillin we know that penicillin
[1:00:55] and those diseases before different
[1:00:56] diseases that they actually amen got an
[1:00:59] antidote for
[1:01:00] and before they would try it on on a
[1:01:02] human they tried on a guinea pig they
[1:01:05] tried on animals and if it worked on
[1:01:06] them then have a human trial and guess
[1:01:09] what if it worked on a human it was good
[1:01:11] to go
[1:01:13] that's what christ was doing he was
[1:01:14] coming and giving us an antidote to the
[1:01:17] sickness of unbelief that we had the
[1:01:20] sickness of our nature
[1:01:24] huh
[1:01:26] all of that he come and he come and he
[1:01:27] tried it and he proved it you know right
[1:01:31] and he took that medicine
[1:01:34] amen and he went to the grave
[1:01:37] destroyed his temple and in three days
[1:01:39] i'll raise it up again
[1:01:42] now we've got something that we know
[1:01:43] that when we take this
[1:01:45] it's guaranteed to raise you up again
[1:01:49] aren't you glad
[1:01:51] what is what is the recipe what is the
[1:01:53] ingredient jesus said to mary she he
[1:01:56] said i am the resurrection
[1:02:00] i am the life
[1:02:03] you know right so if you've got christ
[1:02:06] this morning what have you got
[1:02:08] you've got the resurrection
[1:02:10] you already have the resurrection on the
[1:02:12] inside of you that's the pride of
[1:02:14] prophet
[1:02:15] and god said don't let them throw god
[1:02:17] dirty in your face not my way of
[1:02:19] pertinent don't you let don't you go
[1:02:21] down in the grave don't you go in the
[1:02:23] grave without the holy ghost
[1:02:25] or you ain't got no guarantee of coming
[1:02:27] up but as sure as you go down with the
[1:02:29] holy ghost and he's guaranteed to raise
[1:02:31] you up again
[1:02:32] you will come forth
[1:02:35] if the same spirit that was in christ
[1:02:37] that raised christ from the dead well in
[1:02:39] your mortal body it'll also quicken your
[1:02:41] moral body
[1:02:44] praise be to god aren't you thankful for
[1:02:45] that i'm thankful for easter folks
[1:02:48] means a lot to us
[1:02:52] and in the world that we're living in
[1:02:57] think about it how many knows this world
[1:02:59] is truly falling apart
[1:03:02] and you and i are feeling the pressure
[1:03:03] of it
[1:03:05] amen probably god says you can feel that
[1:03:07] darkness coming down he said that in 65
[1:03:11] i wonder if he wasn't
[1:03:12] prophesying of today
[1:03:14] of how that you can just feel that
[1:03:16] pressure coming i'm feeling it i feel
[1:03:19] that pressure of darkness coming down
[1:03:24] can i say something
[1:03:25] it's making people do what they don't
[1:03:27] normally would
[1:03:28] want to do
[1:03:30] it's making them do things they don't
[1:03:32] even really want to do
[1:03:35] i mean that's why it's so important to
[1:03:37] have the holy ghost that's the only
[1:03:40] thing that will give you power
[1:03:42] over not doing things that you do your
[1:03:44] flesh desires to do
[1:03:46] it's the power of the holy ghost we
[1:03:49] can't never say enough amen that the
[1:03:51] necessity of having the baptism in the
[1:03:53] holy ghost
[1:03:55] because it's the only thing and that's
[1:03:57] what he christ died for amen because he
[1:03:59] said if i don't go away the comforter we
[1:04:02] know that's what the holy ghost
[1:04:04] he can't come if i don't go and i pay
[1:04:06] this price
[1:04:08] it's very expedient that it happens
[1:04:11] praise the lord
[1:04:14] oh my what was he doing on easter
[1:04:17] he had was becoming us wasn't he
[1:04:20] he became us he became a mortal man the
[1:04:22] bible says he became sin
[1:04:25] he became sin
[1:04:28] so that you could become god's
[1:04:30] righteousness
[1:04:32] so that you could be as righteous as god
[1:04:35] is right 40 i'm telling you what that's
[1:04:37] a big statement
[1:04:39] huh isn't that a big statement that you
[1:04:41] and i could be as righteous as god is
[1:04:44] righteous
[1:04:45] because if you try to present yourself
[1:04:47] to god in any of your own righteousness
[1:04:49] it's a bunch of dirty rags
[1:04:52] but you got to come and say god i
[1:04:54] present you amen i come to not claim
[1:04:56] your righteousness
[1:04:59] the righteousness that is in christ
[1:05:01] jesus
[1:05:03] amen
[1:05:04] through the through the cross
[1:05:06] they didn't they captured jesus
[1:05:09] they caught jesus and took him to the
[1:05:11] courts and so forth he became a captive
[1:05:16] so that you could be free
[1:05:18] [Applause]
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:19] how many free people do we have
[1:05:23] think about it
[1:05:24] truly free
[1:05:27] free from unbeliefs free from sin
[1:05:32] that's what he come to do
[1:05:36] he became poor
[1:05:38] didn't even have a lay place to lay his
[1:05:40] head
[1:05:42] so that you could become one rich in god
[1:05:46] [Applause]
[1:05:48] amen you could have the very faith
[1:05:51] that god had to create the earth with
[1:05:55] genesis 1 and god created heavens and
[1:05:58] earth
[1:05:59] we know by faith we understand the world
[1:06:04] it was framed by god's old faith he said
[1:06:07] let it be done and he wellness that's
[1:06:08] the kind of faith you have
[1:06:10] when you have a need when you desire
[1:06:12] something don't just beg the devil to
[1:06:14] give it to you no you say i believe it
[1:06:15] it's mine
[1:06:18] huh
[1:06:19] have god's faith
[1:06:21] the riches of his faith the riches of
[1:06:23] his love
[1:06:25] [Music]
[1:06:29] oh my
[1:06:32] so he died
[1:06:35] so that you might live
[1:06:37] how many is alive
[1:06:39] remember he says we who were once dead
[1:06:43] in sins and trespasses i'll have been
[1:06:45] quickened by the power of god
[1:06:50] amen so look alive
[1:06:52] don't look dead
[1:06:54] look alive let's look alive
[1:06:56] [Applause]
[1:06:58] amen aren't you glad to live
[1:07:01] amen praise the lord
[1:07:03] he was weary
[1:07:05] he was tired
[1:07:08] so why so that you could rest
[1:07:12] am right
[1:07:13] he became weary so that you could rest
[1:07:17] amen
[1:07:18] another thing we're to be rich with how
[1:07:21] many knows that there is absolutely not
[1:07:23] enough money or anything you could ever
[1:07:25] do to merit forgiveness of your sins
[1:07:30] i don't care how many cobbles on streets
[1:07:32] they crawl i don't care how many
[1:07:33] lashes they put on their back or how far
[1:07:36] they crawl or what kind of
[1:07:37] pain they inflict upon themselves they
[1:07:40] could never buy but even enough for one
[1:07:43] of their sins to be forgiven
[1:07:46] but the true riches was in being able to
[1:07:48] be forgiven
[1:07:50] when you make a mistake yesterday after
[1:07:52] that year you have the ability to go to
[1:07:54] god and be forgiven
[1:07:57] that's invaluable
[1:08:02] because without forgiveness you have no
[1:08:06] faith you have no peace
[1:08:08] there is no peace outside of forgiveness
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:15] praise be to god
[1:08:17] so you think about that
[1:08:21] and
[1:08:23] think about it
[1:08:25] there's only one way
[1:08:27] there's only one thing
[1:08:28] there's only two worlds that you can
[1:08:30] live on
[1:08:31] only two worlds
[1:08:33] two atmospheres
[1:08:36] and think about this and this is why my
[1:08:38] heart
[1:08:40] is sad for the world today
[1:08:43] because
[1:08:45] i was thinking about this i thought
[1:08:46] because let's just put it this way
[1:08:49] god made a mistake
[1:08:52] let's just put a god god made a mistake
[1:08:55] and he put into contract
[1:08:59] and he said
[1:09:01] he didn't say just a certain group
[1:09:04] a certain nation a certain race
[1:09:07] but he put it in there and he says
[1:09:08] whosoever will
[1:09:11] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[1:09:13] perish
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:16] oops
[1:09:18] huh we know that it wasn't a
[1:09:21] mistake but
[1:09:22] that's awful big
[1:09:24] i mean that is really big
[1:09:28] i wish the world could hear that is so
[1:09:30] big until everybody that comes to
[1:09:33] judgment is going to have to face john 3
[1:09:36] 16.
[1:09:39] god so loved the world that he gave his
[1:09:41] only begotten son
[1:09:42] whosoever believeth in him
[1:09:47] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:09:50] right i didn't put race i didn't put
[1:09:52] creative color in there i gave it to
[1:09:54] everybody
[1:09:56] what would this world be like if
[1:09:58] everybody would truly believe
[1:10:03] huh
[1:10:06] truly
[1:10:07] believe
[1:10:12] it would be a different world
[1:10:19] how do you know brother brother
[1:10:21] better perish because my whole world was
[1:10:23] changed
[1:10:26] drinking and crowsing and dope and
[1:10:29] adultery and everything else in the book
[1:10:30] all went by the wayside folks
[1:10:33] waking up of a morning completely empty
[1:10:35] and miserable
[1:10:37] on the inside yeah you cater to the
[1:10:40] flesh and the lust of the flesh you can
[1:10:41] do that and that'll give you pleasure
[1:10:44] but i'm here to tell you it doesn't do
[1:10:45] anything for your spirit or your soul
[1:10:48] it completely will leave you empty and
[1:10:51] dry
[1:10:52] not even wanting to live
[1:10:58] it really doesn't pay
[1:10:59] [Applause]
[1:11:00] can i say something it's really not
[1:11:02] worth it
[1:11:05] it's really not worth it
[1:11:08] to believe
[1:11:10] oh that man he had he had a lunatic son
[1:11:12] and he wanted him healed and
[1:11:15] god says if you believe
[1:11:18] if you'll believe
[1:11:20] anything is possible
[1:11:24] evening light tab black like i'm here to
[1:11:26] tell you something
[1:11:28] then if you can believe
[1:11:31] anything is possible
[1:11:33] [Applause]
[1:11:36] all things are possible to them that
[1:11:37] believe
[1:11:39] the book of matthew when it tells the
[1:11:41] story you know and when they ask why
[1:11:43] they why they couldn't
[1:11:44] uh heal him and so forth he says you
[1:11:47] know it was because of your lack of
[1:11:48] faith that you could this couldn't
[1:11:50] happen because he said if you had the
[1:11:52] faith of a grain of monster cheat you
[1:11:54] would say to this mountain be moved and
[1:11:56] plucked into the sea and it would
[1:11:59] happen
[1:12:03] and then if i remember right he said
[1:12:05] after that he says for
[1:12:07] he said with you all things are possible
[1:12:10] nothing shall be impossible
[1:12:14] if you can believe
[1:12:18] i'm so glad that god changed my heart he
[1:12:20] changed my soul he saved my soul
[1:12:23] because there was something down in
[1:12:25] there to believe
[1:12:33] how many knows that's
[1:12:35] what's great
[1:12:36] and god about being happy
[1:12:38] about is the fact that god
[1:12:41] placed that something in your heart to
[1:12:43] believe with
[1:12:50] it ought to make us happy to know that
[1:12:52] you got a believer in there
[1:12:56] to him that hath
[1:12:58] to him shall be
[1:13:00] given to him that hath not from him
[1:13:01] shall be taken even what he does has be
[1:13:04] glad yes you're in the category of him
[1:13:06] that hath
[1:13:07] i do in the category this morning unto
[1:13:09] him that hath shall be given more
[1:13:15] he became sorrowful so that you could
[1:13:17] have joy unspeakable he
[1:13:21] sat on the hill and wept
[1:13:23] so that you could have joy unspeakable
[1:13:25] and full of glory
[1:13:27] that's what easter is all
[1:13:30] about amen
[1:13:33] paul said if you believe with all of
[1:13:34] your heart that christ died and that he
[1:13:37] rose again if thou shall believe with
[1:13:38] all thy heart thou shalt be saved
[1:13:45] how many believes that
[1:13:47] we believe the story of easter
[1:13:51] now there's a big difference
[1:13:53] between you saying you believe
[1:13:56] and you believe it
[1:13:58] because there's a lot
[1:14:00] that say they believe easter
[1:14:02] a lot of people say they believe the
[1:14:04] resurrection of christ
[1:14:06] but do they really
[1:14:08] do they really no they
[1:14:10] don't really
[1:14:12] because if you really believe
[1:14:14] it's going to happen
[1:14:17] if you come the right way to god and you
[1:14:19] believe in him he is going to forgive
[1:14:21] you for your sins
[1:14:26] the bible says their ears have been
[1:14:27] closed their hearts have their clothes
[1:14:29] and so forth they won't hear
[1:14:31] he says because if they did god would
[1:14:33] have to heal him
[1:14:35] he would have to heal him if they truly
[1:14:36] believed
[1:14:37] but they closed their eyes
[1:14:43] the whole world it all lays within and
[1:14:45] that's the problem this is what my
[1:14:46] message is this morning
[1:14:48] easter is the greatest thing ever
[1:14:51] but it doesn't do one bit of good
[1:14:53] to the multitude of the people out there
[1:14:56] not one benefit that they reap from it
[1:15:00] why
[1:15:01] [Music]
[1:15:02] because they believe not
[1:15:04] [Music]
[1:15:05] how many knows that is the sin that'll
[1:15:08] send them to hell
[1:15:10] all the adultery all the smoke and
[1:15:12] drinking all of that that's not what god
[1:15:14] sent them to help
[1:15:16] nope it's going to be because they
[1:15:18] believe not
[1:15:20] but god said what god did
[1:15:23] boy oh boy so to speak for a lack of a
[1:15:26] better word
[1:15:27] when you think about this generation
[1:15:29] of churanity
[1:15:31] that's seen the power of god even that
[1:15:34] god himself had taken his picture with
[1:15:35] this prophet
[1:15:37] they can look at it and they still don't
[1:15:39] please
[1:15:43] i dare i dare you i dare tell you you're
[1:15:46] out of two tarts that could determine
[1:15:47] your eternal validation
[1:15:49] because if that truly was god you say i
[1:15:50] don't believe that you're just believing
[1:15:52] god
[1:15:53] sure if it was fake you wouldn't have to
[1:15:54] worry about it but that's not fake
[1:15:58] when he would discern the thoughts and
[1:16:00] intent to the people's heart jesus would
[1:16:02] come back and do the very same things
[1:16:03] that he did
[1:16:06] remember brother troy read that where he
[1:16:08] says you know they came and they walked
[1:16:10] with cleophys and and so forth on the
[1:16:12] road to emmaus
[1:16:14] and they went in they invited him in and
[1:16:16] he did something
[1:16:17] that he had done before the resident
[1:16:20] before he had died that they recognized
[1:16:22] and they knew him
[1:16:24] and he vanished out of this height
[1:16:26] the prophet come and preached many a
[1:16:28] message and says you know if you'll come
[1:16:30] and do something that he did before the
[1:16:32] resurrection will you believe it meaning
[1:16:34] people would not believe him
[1:16:36] i guarantee you this church should be
[1:16:37] full of the dead
[1:16:38] the baptist church over there would be
[1:16:40] empty the methodist church would be
[1:16:41] empty
[1:16:42] all in churches be empty
[1:16:45] if they believe what jesus did today
[1:16:49] unbelief is a terrible thing folks
[1:16:53] all of this ivy all of that sin that
[1:16:55] waved in the wave of sin that came in
[1:16:57] was because the church world chose
[1:16:59] barabbas
[1:17:01] they chose some a murderer
[1:17:04] over jesus christ
[1:17:07] they did not accept jesus christ the
[1:17:08] religious order that they did
[1:17:11] neither did the religious order of today
[1:17:14] accept jesus christ
[1:17:19] i believe
[1:17:20] that god said i will restore we have
[1:17:22] gotten this we have gotten this whole
[1:17:24] church world and this bible in a mix
[1:17:28] we adopt this methodist amish mennonite
[1:17:30] beachy amish men and i know olbermann
[1:17:32] and all kinds of different ones
[1:17:34] [Music]
[1:17:36] church of christ pentecostal first
[1:17:37] church of christ second church of christ
[1:17:39] so far church of christ how many
[1:17:41] churches of christ hello
[1:17:44] we had gotten things in the mess but god
[1:17:46] said i will restore
[1:17:48] saith the lord all of those years and
[1:17:50] all that mess up i'm going to come and
[1:17:51] i'm going to show you that i am alive
[1:17:54] and well
[1:17:55] and i'll tell you what if you truly
[1:17:56] believe that jesus is alive and well and
[1:17:58] he's coming back for you and me
[1:18:01] it does something to you
[1:18:04] it'll make you live different it'll make
[1:18:06] you focus differently it'll get you to
[1:18:08] looking on things involving non things
[1:18:09] below
[1:18:13] it'll make you not care about the cares
[1:18:15] of life as much
[1:18:17] and it'll make you shake the kingdom of
[1:18:18] god more
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:23] huh
[1:18:24] that's what it will do
[1:18:29] oh how many beliefs is how many
[1:18:30] believers
[1:18:31] they call us message believers
[1:18:34] we believe god's message
[1:18:36] i'll send you elijah the prophet before
[1:18:38] the great
[1:18:41] they are the lord and he's gonna prove
[1:18:43] to you
[1:18:44] that he raised two thousand years ago
[1:18:46] but we couldn't know for sure there for
[1:18:47] a while we didn't know what church he
[1:18:49] was in
[1:18:51] we didn't know what to believe but he
[1:18:53] gave us an absolute precise
[1:18:57] amen
[1:18:59] if you remember
[1:19:01] the prophet when he was about seven
[1:19:02] years old had a whirlwind come into a
[1:19:04] tree
[1:19:05] they're right and he said don't you ever
[1:19:06] drink don't ever smoke or defile your
[1:19:08] body in any way for i have a work for
[1:19:10] you to do
[1:19:12] i'm a believer
[1:19:13] i believe god said that to him
[1:19:16] because he had to work and he did the
[1:19:18] work
[1:19:22] i'm part of that work
[1:19:24] i'm part of the restoration process
[1:19:29] oh
[1:19:30] my
[1:19:31] amen aren't you glad this morning
[1:19:34] that you're a part of that process
[1:19:37] he promised he would do it and he did it
[1:19:42] people one time in the bible ask him how
[1:19:44] can i work the works of god
[1:19:48] what did jesus say and
[1:19:51] believe on him whom he had sent
[1:19:54] is correct
[1:20:00] oh my not just jesus
[1:20:03] that's who he believed to be saved but
[1:20:05] he also said paul
[1:20:07] paul said if anybody come and preach
[1:20:08] anything other than what i've told you
[1:20:09] let me name you from heaven let it be a
[1:20:11] curse any spiritual
[1:20:14] or prophet let him acknowledge him but
[1:20:15] we write to you
[1:20:18] are the commandments of the lord
[1:20:21] iranians martin luther klump is all of
[1:20:23] those
[1:20:24] all the way down to brother bannon
[1:20:26] that one is the one that is hardest for
[1:20:28] people to accept
[1:20:30] because he was born right here in
[1:20:31] kentucky
[1:20:34] praise be to god
[1:20:36] god saw fit to bring the last greatest
[1:20:38] prophet right out of our kentucky state
[1:20:42] glory
[1:20:44] doesn't make kentucky all that special
[1:20:45] but it does just a little bit
[1:20:48] huh
[1:20:49] praise the lord
[1:20:51] i mean he's glad
[1:20:52] [Applause]

[1:21:02] and by faith i'll make it through
[1:21:04] my whole world is so different i believe

[1:21:09] takes you into forgiveness into grace it
[1:21:12] gives you the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:21:15] if thou cans believe all things are
[1:21:18] possible

[1:27:10] if you truly
[1:27:12] you'll get your sights set right
[1:27:16] set your affections
[1:27:19] on things above
[1:27:21] i was driving down the road been driving
[1:27:23] down the road on vacation different
[1:27:24] places
[1:27:26] there's one thing i hate
[1:27:28] is to see dead animals along the road
[1:27:32] dead animals
[1:27:33] get slaughtered some of them were spread
[1:27:36] out there by themselves it's horrible
[1:27:38] like that's terrible
[1:27:40] that's terrible
[1:27:42] and i thought you know
[1:27:44] i thought about saying this and in my
[1:27:45] mind
[1:27:47] i go
[1:27:48] and i pray for them little animals that
[1:27:50] little
[1:27:51] that little dog and that little dog
[1:27:52] raises back up
[1:27:54] raise that back up
[1:27:56] raise that deer back up
[1:27:59] huh
[1:28:01] wouldn't it be something
[1:28:02] just raise them all up
[1:28:05] and then in my mind
[1:28:09] i thought you know
[1:28:10] but if that dog could talk in his funny
[1:28:12] little mouth and snout and he talked to
[1:28:14] me you know
[1:28:16] he'd say why don't you do that for
[1:28:20] what you do that for

[1:28:24] that was terrible
[1:28:26] that death was terrible
[1:28:29] and now i'm gonna have to do it again
[1:28:31] thanks to you
[1:28:36] crazy thoughts i think right
[1:28:39] but that's what i thought i thought

[1:28:43] because we're mortal yet
[1:28:45] and i'm gonna have to die and somehow it
[1:28:47] ain't no fun

[1:32:04] the whole creation the bible says is

[1:32:11] amen and i love the peace i've got to
[1:32:12] love that you all got i love all that

[1:32:47] what a resurrection
[1:32:49] i want to honor before i go on perhaps
[1:32:51] in the conclusion of that
[1:32:53] let's go back and pick up
[1:32:55] in this generation i want you to
[1:32:56] understand something and that is that in
[1:32:58] this generation we had another
[1:33:00] crucifixion of the lord
[1:33:04] and we had another resurrection of the
[1:33:06] lord
[1:33:07] a resurrection out of deep dark
[1:33:09] denominations
[1:33:11] denominational ages
[1:33:13] and they crucified him
[1:33:16] brother ben's message called there they
[1:33:18] crucified him
[1:33:20] and he says i invite this generation for
[1:33:23] the second crucifixion of jesus christ
[1:33:26] just like jesus did with those pharisees
[1:33:28] you by your traditions have made the
[1:33:31] word of god of not affecting the people
[1:33:35] we can say those churches made god's
[1:33:37] word what god did in degeneration of not
[1:33:40] affecting their people
[1:33:43] when he comes right down they chose your
[1:33:45] own ideas just like the pharisees over
[1:33:47] the proven vindicated word of god
[1:33:50] thereby crucifying the facts
[1:33:52] of the word
[1:33:57] but how many believes he's resurrected
[1:33:58] in the people he's directed into people
[1:34:01] that believes him
[1:34:03] just like peter
[1:34:06] he was resurrected in those that
[1:34:07] believed him not those that crucified
[1:34:09] him
[1:34:10] and they could just go in a shadow of
[1:34:12] peter
[1:34:12] and be healed
[1:34:14] isn't that right
[1:34:18] to think that jesus christ come in this
[1:34:20] generation
[1:34:21] millions of healings
[1:34:24] and
[1:34:24] to preach the word of god
[1:34:26] but started out with the healing that
[1:34:28] drew everybody but when it comes down to
[1:34:30] preaching to the word they didn't want
[1:34:32] to hear him just like with jesus
[1:34:35] they chose barabbas something that would
[1:34:37] kill him
[1:34:39] over somebody that would save them
[1:34:41] because that's what this message does it
[1:34:43] saves you it is christ
[1:34:46] it's what christ done
[1:34:48] not some man
[1:34:51] so i believe the story
[1:34:53] i believe the story when he said don't
[1:34:56] drink or smoke or defy your body in any
[1:34:58] way forever work for you to do
[1:35:00] and then brother bannon belonged to
[1:35:01] baptist church going to church and
[1:35:03] everything and and he seemed they were
[1:35:04] fixing the ordained women preachers
[1:35:10] was it
[1:35:11] what was his that pastor's name again
[1:35:14] brother roy davis
[1:35:17] roy davis
[1:35:18] he said no you're going to dedicate him
[1:35:20] you belong to this church well i get
[1:35:22] none that's against the scriptures
[1:35:25] huh
[1:35:26] and a little bit later an angel came to
[1:35:28] brother man and says you know you're
[1:35:29] going to pray for monarchs and kings and
[1:35:32] potentiates you're going to have a
[1:35:33] worldwide ministry
[1:35:35] and brother i'm told his pastor and he
[1:35:37] says angel said that this is what i'm
[1:35:39] going to do you with a seventh grade
[1:35:41] education what kind of dream did you
[1:35:42] have
[1:35:44] huh
[1:35:45] he didn't believe it but says if that's
[1:35:47] the attitude that you have i'm gonna
[1:35:49] give you my resignation i'm gonna give
[1:35:50] you my fellowship card
[1:35:52] no don't do that don't do that he says
[1:35:54] yes i might as well now because it's
[1:35:56] going to happen later anyway that's
[1:35:57] exactly what's going to happen you
[1:35:59] embrace the message at this hour
[1:36:01] churches will kick you out
[1:36:05] that's right
[1:36:06] and anyway listen he did that and and
[1:36:09] well do i believe yeah i believe it
[1:36:11] because he did
[1:36:12] i mean he knows the proof is in the
[1:36:14] pudding
[1:36:15] he went kings and told all kinds of
[1:36:18] people that he prayed for and me that
[1:36:19] were healed
[1:36:22] people around the world that were saved
[1:36:26] huh
[1:36:28] thirty thousand went one time he says
[1:36:30] that's ten times pentecost that christ
[1:36:33] did
[1:36:37] [Music]
[1:36:39] he says you know i anybody can preach
[1:36:42] he said anybody can preach
[1:36:44] but when god comes and he vindicates it
[1:36:46] and proves it
[1:36:47] then it's sin for you to disbelieve
[1:36:53] and think about it that's exactly what
[1:36:54] they did people even though they could
[1:36:56] see it with their eyes they could hear
[1:36:58] it
[1:36:59] you're not from so-and-so that wasn't
[1:37:01] the prophet speaking he would jesus
[1:37:03] christ the holy spirit would take
[1:37:05] brother banham's body over and he'd do
[1:37:07] the talk how many believes that he would
[1:37:08] do the talking
[1:37:10] that's why
[1:37:11] that's why
[1:37:13] he challenged anybody anywhere to come
[1:37:15] and point to him where that discernment
[1:37:17] was ever
[1:37:19] wrong
[1:37:20] i mean it was never wrong
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:27] and you know what
[1:37:29] because he said if it had been wrong
[1:37:31] then god would have been wrong
[1:37:33] isn't that right and god can't be wrong
[1:37:35] god's not wrong
[1:37:40] i gotta read this story again but i
[1:37:42] gotta hear it again but this one lady
[1:37:43] says they were friends and he told her
[1:37:46] where she lived out and her friend after
[1:37:47] services you don't live there
[1:37:50] he was wrong about that she said no i
[1:37:52] moved here today
[1:37:57] he was exactly right
[1:37:59] i dare say this i dare say this that if
[1:38:03] it was ever wrong
[1:38:04] it wasn't discernment and it was just
[1:38:06] brother brandon getting in the way
[1:38:08] because god ain't never wrong
[1:38:11] but when it came to that discernment
[1:38:12] brother benham knew not to play
[1:38:14] he wouldn't just he wouldn't just say
[1:38:19] or he wouldn't just
[1:38:20] he says i'm wait for him to
[1:38:23] come i can't tell you not until he tells
[1:38:24] me
[1:38:25] because he knew better than the good
[1:38:26] presumptuously
[1:38:28] he waited until the angel said and then
[1:38:30] he would have thus saith the lord and
[1:38:31] it's going to happen
[1:38:33] amen
[1:38:34] people don't want to believe that when
[1:38:36] he went over and beyond the curtain of
[1:38:37] time
[1:38:38] isn't that right
[1:38:40] see i believe i believe what he said how
[1:38:42] many believes how many believe it when
[1:38:44] he went beyond the curtain of time and
[1:38:45] he come back and he told the church the
[1:38:47] story of how he's over there he was in
[1:38:49] his bed one morning he had his hands
[1:38:50] over his back there and he thought boy
[1:38:52] 52 years old i better get to doing
[1:38:54] something to the lord if i better do
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:38:56] it and directly he was caught up and he
[1:38:59] looked back there was his body and there
[1:39:01] he was up there and he began to see
[1:39:03] millions of people
[1:39:05] women with long hair beautiful blackened
[1:39:07] hair whatever color they were robes on a
[1:39:09] man and also
[1:39:11] in the prime of youth and coming up and
[1:39:13] hugging him and so forth and all these
[1:39:14] things that happened
[1:39:16] now if i'm not wrong he also has seen
[1:39:18] his dog in his horse
[1:39:20] now right his horse come up over his
[1:39:22] shoulder knickers just like his old
[1:39:23] horse did
[1:39:25] and fritz i believe it was the one that
[1:39:26] the neighbors poisoned
[1:39:29] you know and somebody got unbelieving
[1:39:32] said brother brandon i like your story
[1:39:34] until you had your dog or your heart you
[1:39:35] haven't got no no heaven isn't for
[1:39:37] horses
[1:39:42] let me tell you something you better
[1:39:43] watch off right
[1:39:45] he says i appreciate your criticism and
[1:39:47] so forth but while the body lights his
[1:39:49] horses that came down in
[1:39:51] the chariots that took him up what about
[1:39:54] in revelations 19 he comes back from the
[1:39:56] heavens of heavens and all the hosts of
[1:39:58] heaven and he come on why don't you
[1:40:00] where they're all at
[1:40:01] [Music]
