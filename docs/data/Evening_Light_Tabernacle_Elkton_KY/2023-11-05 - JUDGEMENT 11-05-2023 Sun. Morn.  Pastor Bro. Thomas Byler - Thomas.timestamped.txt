[0:00] that it shall be more tolerable for the
[0:01] land of Sodom the day of judgment than
[0:04] for thee may God add His blessings to
[0:06] the reading of the word you can be
[0:08] seated
[0:11] amen amen I want to review just a little
[0:14] bit if I could would that be all right
[0:16] recap amen for the believer amen we know
[0:20] that uh we've been teaching what the
[0:22] believer is and and the rock that he has
[0:25] and and no matter what Trials Come
[0:28] tribulation come distress yes amen and
[0:31] there was something else maybe even a
[0:33] little bit more than I thought about
[0:34] that I wanted to bring and that was amen
[0:37] but but over in uh Romans 8 I believe it
[0:41] was he says shall tribulation shall
[0:43] persecution a Believer has such a grip
[0:46] amen amen that he's unmovable amen amen
[0:50] that's a real believer and how many
[0:52] knows that uh according to the Bible
[0:54] it's talks about straight is the gate
[0:56] and narrow is the way amen uh but in few
[1:00] there would be that would find it and he
[1:03] said broad is the way that leads to
[1:05] destruction and many there be that go in
[1:09] there at so what we want to talk about
[1:11] basically this morning with the help of
[1:12] the Lord is the many the
[1:16] many amen I wanted to pull that up but
[1:20] brother Brandon one place he said he
[1:21] said you know uh when it comes to the
[1:23] make believer he says that there will be
[1:26] millions and billions of mimics of
[1:32] Christianity amen millions and billions
[1:35] of so-called Christians that say they're
[1:38] Believers they're actually make
[1:39] Believers amen how many know outside of
[1:41] a real genuine Born Again experience of
[1:45] the Holy Ghost in your soul amen you're
[1:47] just a mimic amen I remember I was
[1:50] listening to brother brah he said the
[1:52] other day he says you know if God hasn't
[1:54] come and change your nature and your
[1:56] desires from amen for sinful nature he
[1:59] says your
[2:00] deceived amen because a lot of people
[2:02] can get it on the on the spirit they can
[2:05] get it on the flesh amen and it's a very
[2:08] deceptive time is't that right because
[2:11] the devil is not amen even one place I
[2:13] believe brother Braham said that even
[2:15] Cain was a Believer the devil's a
[2:17] Believer the Bible says the devil
[2:19] believes and he
[2:20] trembles amen he perhaps the Devil
[2:24] Himself believes more than what a lot of
[2:26] Christians do is that right amen because
[2:29] if you know a lot of times when Jesus
[2:30] would come he says have you have you
[2:32] come to torment us and so forth you know
[2:34] but the scribes the Pharisees they were
[2:36] so blind amen that they uh amen they
[2:39] claimed to be Believers but they weren't
[2:40] really
[2:42] Believers amen the same way with Cain he
[2:44] wasn't really a Believer even though we
[2:46] would class him a Believer he was a
[2:47] churchgoer he was a relig very religious
[2:50] unbeliever amen remember the uh the man
[2:54] that said to brother bam he says you
[2:55] know uh you know I don't care if you if
[2:57] if I seen a miracle you know what this
[2:59] out I still wouldn't believe it he says
[3:01] of course not you're an unbeliever but
[3:03] yet he was a
[3:05] preacher amen and the whole world is
[3:09] full of them and Paul talked about how
[3:11] that a mean and we want to go there
[3:13] perhaps yet with in 1 Corinthians 10
[3:15] where he talked about Israel and how
[3:17] that they were amen uh under the cloud
[3:19] and all these other things and they were
[3:21] examples amen for us they have been
[3:24] given they were our example the example
[3:27] of the believer let me just say this
[3:29] while it's into my mind amen a make
[3:31] believer amen he'll say well I'm as good
[3:34] as anybody in that church or I'm as good
[3:36] as that guy in the church maybe that
[3:38] person that he's talking about is a
[3:40] hypocrite amen and so he's not really
[3:42] saying anything amen but a make believer
[3:45] will be happy with where he's at a real
[3:48] believer will take heed amen if you
[3:51] think you stand Paul said take heat
[3:54] least you fall a real believer wants to
[3:57] make sure that he's sure and we're
[3:59] living an hour
[4:01] folks where they're at the
[4:04] Judgment it's not going to be the
[4:06] unbeliever The Sinner the Harlot The
[4:09] Prostitute that's going to be
[4:10] disappointed they expect their sentence
[4:12] but said but it's going to be the make
[4:14] believer in that right they're the ones
[4:17] that going to be disappointed at the
[4:19] Judgment amen how many know that we need
[4:21] to examine ourselves according to Paul
[4:24] amen examine yourself see whether you're
[4:27] in the faith or not how many beli amen
[4:29] seek out your own salvation the Bible
[4:32] say with fear and trembling in other
[4:34] words make sure that you're sure how
[4:37] sure should we make a mean how should we
[4:39] be should we try to be because we're
[4:41] living in that final watch my
[4:44] friend you got to be sure that you're
[4:47] sure and that takes
[4:51] examination amen how many believer even
[4:53] this morning he says you know let a man
[4:55] examine himself and so let him take of
[4:57] that bread and drink of that wine when
[5:00] we have that moment of silence and so
[5:01] forth you examine yourself see if you're
[5:04] worthy or if you need to repent of
[5:06] things before you take it amen because
[5:09] you've got to find you got to examine
[5:11] yourself Paul said don't you know
[5:13] yourself how that Christ is in you
[5:15] unless you're a reprobate everybody
[5:17] knows if you're that's the problem with
[5:19] people is they don't examine themselves
[5:21] how many believe that a Christian has to
[5:23] have a
[5:25] self-examination you know exactly how
[5:27] you've lived you know exactly how you
[5:29] are you know how you think and what
[5:31] you've done amen so we have to examine
[5:34] ourselves amen I believe it's the hour
[5:36] of examination brother bam said we need
[5:39] to not just check up every month or
[5:41] every week every hour of every minute of
[5:44] every day every day you want to check up
[5:47] because you're living in the hour let me
[5:49] tell you how many believe we're living
[5:50] in that hour and in that watch where
[5:52] Jesus said you know if the thief would
[5:54] have known and what watched out you know
[5:56] not the thief if the owner of the house
[5:58] would have want known in which watch in
[6:00] what watch the thief would have come he
[6:02] would have watched and then been
[6:03] prepared and you and I living in that
[6:05] watch how many believes we're living in
[6:06] this generation shall not pass until all
[6:08] these things be fulfilled and what we
[6:10] see in Israel just at any time God could
[6:12] be done with
[6:15] this let me tell you something there's
[6:18] time people are backsliding people
[6:20] getting cold on God you need to look at
[6:22] yourself and see where you're at amen
[6:25] because there's no hour from backsliding
[6:27] no hour from getting away from God
[6:29] because that's what the make believer
[6:31] does make believer he don't much care
[6:34] amen he doesn't believe like he should
[6:37] amen you know it's quite something and I
[6:39] thought about this and talking about
[6:40] just a little bit of review talking
[6:42] about how thankful that you and I can
[6:45] can be to know what really is the truth
[6:49] remember Wednesday we talked about
[6:50] brother bam was talking about he says
[6:52] you know why do people drink why do
[6:53] people commit adultery why do people do
[6:55] this and all of these other things is
[6:57] because they haven't drank of the water
[7:00] that truly satisfies how many knows the
[7:02] whole world our our our college system
[7:05] our government system everything is
[7:08] because they have rejected the way of
[7:10] life they have rejected the truth and
[7:13] that's why and I'm so aren't you glad
[7:15] you can understand exactly why they're
[7:18] in the condition that they're
[7:20] in oh Hallelujah aren't you glad that
[7:22] you don't have to be in that condition
[7:24] this morning you don't have to have
[7:27] another tattoo you ain't got to have no
[7:29] nose ring Hallelujah you don't have to
[7:31] get through to go through the pain of
[7:32] painting yourself up you're perfectly
[7:34] content with how you
[7:37] are why because you are a Believer and
[7:40] you have so churched your soul amen and
[7:42] you've been filled with that Fountain of
[7:45] Life amen there's a River of Life in The
[7:47] Believer amen and they're so
[7:51] empty and going out into darkness
[7:55] because they have refused the way how
[7:58] many know God has
[7:59] all of Humanity on a one this is what we
[8:02] know to be the
[8:03] truth that God has put each and everyone
[8:07] every person is responsible for their
[8:09] actions and for whether they believe or
[8:11] whether they don't and God comes and he
[8:14] does such great things as he did in our
[8:17] generation I mean as he came and he made
[8:19] himself so obvious and he was put it you
[8:21] know that that just that scripture is
[8:24] enough to either save you or condemn you
[8:26] but then brother baham says you know
[8:27] just the word of God should be enough
[8:29] but then he sends gifts he sends
[8:31] prophets he does all kinds of Miracles
[8:33] to try to persuade people to
[8:36] come
[8:38] amen oh my and when you reject all of
[8:41] that and
[8:44] disbelief you deserve hell and God will
[8:48] judge you you will be judged and guess
[8:51] what that's why we call it judgment this
[8:53] morning because when you turn down that
[8:55] kind of grace and mercy that God shows
[9:00] a fountain filled with blood drawn from
[9:02] Emmanuel's vein and sinners plunge
[9:04] beneath that flood lose all their gain
[9:06] guilty stain a chance to have all of
[9:08] your sins gone and not have to have to
[9:10] give account for all of it amen why
[9:13] because you've come to the house of
[9:15] judgment and your sins I read I was
[9:18] reading where better says preachers will
[9:20] am me have people come to the Altar and
[9:22] and judge yourselves amen and your sins
[9:23] go up beforeand amen they get taken care
[9:26] of you ain't got to worry about this
[9:29] amen the Judgment but if you don't get
[9:31] them taken care of they will have to be
[9:33] dealt
[9:34] with people don't mind the cons people
[9:36] are so all prising so to speak amen and
[9:39] so blind the devil so blinds people but
[9:43] listen to what he says here he begin to
[9:45] upgrade the cities I think that's
[9:47] sometimes what the Holy Ghost will do
[9:49] Amen in the prophet even in his message
[9:51] you remember when he was preaching the
[9:52] choosing of a bride when he was in
[9:54] California he says oh don't what a
[9:56] solemn warning we don't know what time
[9:58] we don't know what time but this city
[9:59] one day is going to be laying here at
[10:01] the bottom of this ocean
[10:05] amen amen remember Jesus said oh
[10:07] capernium which are exalted into heaven
[10:10] shall be brought down to Hell if the
[10:12] mighty Works had been done in you that
[10:14] were done in the amen that were done in
[10:17] Sodom it would have remained until this
[10:19] day then brother bam says oh capernium
[10:22] said Jesus D exalted in heaven will be
[10:24] brought and if the mighty Works had been
[10:26] done in Sodom and gor oh my it' been
[10:29] standing till this
[10:32] day oh doesn't it want to just make you
[10:34] scream look at what God has done in our
[10:38] generation oh
[10:40] my my my my if he could say that about
[10:44] Sodom and
[10:46] Gora huh a bunch of
[10:51] homosexuals so filled with homosexuality
[10:54] until they were trying to come into the
[10:56] break down Lots door and everything else
[10:58] and Bible says they would
[10:59] repented if the signs were done there's
[11:02] a price how many know I wish this whole
[11:06] world could just hear this this morning
[11:08] and it's always easy to believe a Jesus
[11:10] that died on Calvary it's always be easy
[11:13] to believe a god of the past but if you
[11:15] don't recognize the god of now you're
[11:20] lost amen because oh it's so easy cuz
[11:23] it's back
[11:24] there you know but now when he comes and
[11:27] he talks to you and he proves it to you
[11:29] what will you do with this Jesus that's
[11:31] called the Christ what are you going to
[11:33] do with the resurrected Christ not the
[11:35] dead Christ but the resurrected Christ
[11:37] that's here and living among
[11:39] us come and showing signs and wonders
[11:42] like never before around the world for
[11:44] 30 some odd years doing signs and
[11:46] wonders that he
[11:47] did I heard brother bam said man he was
[11:50] praying and doing a discernment he say
[11:53] if that sign would have been done in
[11:54] Africa there's been thousands upon
[11:56] thousands receive the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:58] and people people oh I guess that's all
[12:01] right folks how many knows that signs
[12:04] and those wonders and that discernment
[12:06] that was a precious thing that would God
[12:07] give us in this hour amen don't take it
[12:11] for granted don't ever let it become
[12:12] lukewarm to you amen notice
[12:15] now that's right and solom and Gomorrah
[12:18] lays at the bottom of the Dead Sea

[12:29] country come here to pick up the filth
[12:31] to send it back and you f churches and

[18:52] Solomon is here let's look at a couple
[18:55] more things shall we let's go to uh uh
[18:58] Luke
[19:03] 14 Luke 14 there's all kinds of
[19:06] different categories of where the Bible
[19:08] talks about people who make excuses
[19:11] people who uh uh you know
[19:14] even even talking about the foolish
[19:16] virtues we'll read here in a little bit
[19:18] now
[19:22] notice let's start with verse um 15
[19:27] chapter 14 14:1 15 of St Luke and when
[19:31] one of them that sat at meat with him
[19:33] heard these things he said unto him
[19:35] blessed is he that shall eat bread in
[19:36] the kingdom of God then said he unto
[19:39] them a certain man made a great supper
[19:41] and bade many and sent his servants at
[19:44] supper time to say unto them that were

[22:52] think that well you must have reached it
[22:55] you must be in perfect walk with God and
[22:57] never fail and on fire for God
[22:59] witnessing to your neighbors to your
[23:00] milk man and just all of those things
[23:02] like you're supposed to be doing amen
[23:06] but I'm here to tell you I heard even
[23:07] even brother brandom I was reading the
[23:09] other day and he was talking about
[23:10] himself and how that he hasn't went and
[23:12] that as much as he should and says I'm
[23:14] like a I feel like a jellyfish jellyfish
[23:16] he called
[23:17] himself it because I haven't done I
[23:19] haven't witnessed I haven't just went
[23:21] out there like I should I've always
[23:22] waited on things I said Lord if he could
[23:25] feel himself to be a jellyfish cuz he
[23:27] ain't doing enough for God what should
[23:28] we
[23:29] do not doing enough for God that's right
[23:33] you don't have much time to do much more
[23:34] for God it's about closing time people
[23:37] it's about going up time straight is the
[23:39] gate and narrow is the way and few there
[23:42] be that find it it's going to be few
[23:44] people it's going to be
[23:46] few real genuine Believers and I'll tell
[23:49] you right now the way of the hypocrisy
[23:51] the way of make Believers is
[23:55] many oh my my my let's not be there how
[23:58] many know say Lord examine me let's
[24:01] check ourselves out make sure we're not
[24:03] in that category of people
[24:06] amen now on down listen there's still
[24:09] room Hedges oh my and then yet there's
[24:11] room and the Lord said unto the servant
[24:13] go into the highways and the edges and
[24:17] compel them to come
[24:19] in oh I believe that's what the Holy
[24:22] Ghost is doing man if you're not what
[24:23] you ought to be come God is compelling
[24:25] come on in come on in
[24:29] come into Christ get into Christ flee
[24:32] from this wrath that is fixing to happen
[24:35] here amen but God beg God persuades so
[24:39] to speak compels people to come
[24:44] in only the True Believers really
[24:48] do
[24:50] huh make believer I heard that
[24:55] before aren't you glad you've got
[24:57] something down in
[25:00] there something down in there makes you
[25:02] want to go further makes you want to go
[25:06] deeper makes you want to walk straighter
[25:09] makes you want to love more makes you
[25:11] want to drink more makes you want to
[25:14] feed more what makes you want to be like
[25:16] Christ more because if you're
[25:18] predestinated according to Romans 8 he
[25:21] predestinated you to be conformed to the
[25:23] image of his son and I believe that word
[25:26] comes out in your heart to God that's
[25:28] what I want I want to be conformed to
[25:30] the image of his son but says tell you
[25:33] what now all of your good deeds all of
[25:35] this out of the other people doing
[25:37] helping a widow woman helping this one
[25:39] and helping your neighbor all of that
[25:40] don't count one thing there's only one
[25:42] thing that's going to be accepted and
[25:44] that is if the literal life of Jesus
[25:46] Christ is in you you're not going in
[25:49] rupture unless Christ's life is living
[25:52] out through
[25:53] you that's the only thing that'll
[25:55] satisfy the wrath of almighty God
[25:58] that's the only thing that'll have you
[25:59] ready for a Rapture is when you're not
[26:01] doing it your way remember when Jesus
[26:04] talked about the man that came in there
[26:05] with the
[26:06] robe to the wedding is that right he
[26:09] says man how did you get in
[26:12] here and the man was speechless I'll
[26:14] tell you how he got in there in John 101
[26:17] it says you know the Sea comes not but
[26:19] he comes up some other way to kill and
[26:22] steal and destroy if you don't come by
[26:24] the way of the door come up some other
[26:25] way you're thief and a robber
[26:28] and mean that's the way Cain thought he
[26:29] could do I can do it my
[26:31] way people want to have a Christian walk
[26:34] like they want their way if you want it
[26:36] your way you remember you're descending
[26:38] the
[26:39] Kain a Believer wants God's
[26:45] way and I'm here to tell
[26:47] you Millions will come on that day and
[26:52] be
[26:56] disappointed disa
[26:58] appointed complete
[27:01] disappointment for the unbeliever and
[27:03] the makeb believer especially the make
[27:06] believer

[34:25] right
[34:27] it's a sad
[34:29] hour for the whole world had
[34:31] rejected something they should have put
[34:34] in the White
[34:36] House remember solom had a gift and they
[34:39] made him
[34:40] King is that right they made him
[34:44] King and what was it that I'm not sure
[34:47] if it was Elijah or one of them you know
[34:50] the I believe it was the Philistines
[34:52] were saying how do do we have a do we
[34:54] have a spy amongst
[34:55] us Prophet said and somebody says he
[34:58] they says no it is that prophet he tells
[35:01] he knows what goes on in your bed
[35:03] Chambers he knows what kind of pajamas
[35:05] you put
[35:08] on he knows he you know oh my brother I
[35:12] got to think about this last night man
[35:13] we should have made brother Brandon
[35:15] president he should have been
[35:17] president we had all nations and I oh my
[35:21] what would have been done didn't even
[35:23] brother B say why didn't this generation
[35:25] if we accept God's Gift the way to they
[35:27] did we'd had another days of Solomon
[35:29] again all the nations would have feared
[35:31] us we wouldn't have needed all we
[35:33] wouldn't have needed a spy plane with
[35:36] all the technology and go down there and
[35:37] look where they're b a little BM no we
[35:40] would have need all that cuz of God
[35:41] would have showed him right there hey
[35:43] y'all get out of that little mountain
[35:45] back there and quit making some nukes we
[35:46] know what you're doing
[35:48] okay as a matter of fact you have about
[35:50] 24 hours to evacu will blow that place
[35:54] up huh that's kind of that's kind of
[35:57] world we what kind of world would we
[35:59] have live lived in if all the churches
[36:01] would have accepted Jesus Christ in this
[36:05] hour I'll tell you what kind of a world
[36:07] we'd have lived in brother BR there
[36:08] wouldn't have been any Baptists and
[36:09] Methodist and Presbyterian and old
[36:10] Lutheran we'd all been message Believers
[36:12] we believe God send us a message we are
[36:14] believers of God's message that he has
[36:18] sent my we've all been
[36:21] unified there'd be no
[36:23] divisions the churches wouldn't have
[36:25] went off and divided
[36:27] themselves anymore because he's coming
[36:28] on a white horse or on a cloud they
[36:31] doctrinal difference they laid all of
[36:33] those things aside and not been such
[36:35] children
[36:36] anymore huh but they couldn't even do
[36:39] that they couldn't even believe and
[36:41] recognize what Jesus that Jesus was what
[36:43] was he was doing and mean didn't the
[36:46] Pharisees didn't those make Believers
[36:48] don't make Believers said you know that
[36:50] you have a devil you're Bey but you cast
[36:52] out Devils by the devil Jesus but B come
[36:55] along he says you know what do they call
[36:57] this mental telepathy mind reading
[37:00] that's what the church World tried to
[37:01] call this and he says that's calling it
[37:04] a
[37:06] devil which for which according to the
[37:09] scripture and the prophet of God he says
[37:11] when the Holy Spirit is coming you seek
[37:13] one word against it it won't be forgiven
[37:15] you in this world or in the world to
[37:19] come to call it but they did didn't they
[37:23] we find such a parallel today don't we
[37:26] of make Believers The Same Spirit that
[37:27] was in the Pharisees is in the churches
[37:29] today it can be done right in front of
[37:32] them right right out in the open right
[37:35] there it is and they reject
[37:40] it that's right when the hot flames of
[37:42] hell is burning their tongues and
[37:44] burning their bodies and they're in
[37:46] complete torment they'll think about
[37:47] that they'll think about the fact that
[37:49] hey they actually just turned their eye
[37:51] I didn't want to do it I want it my way
[37:55] am me like Kane he wanted his way way of
[37:56] worship God doesn't accept your way of
[37:59] worship no you come his way or you don't
[38:02] come amen that's the world that we're
[38:05] living in folks that's why the world is
[38:07] in the condition that it's
[38:08] in is that boy if you could just have
[38:11] that in every media outlet that there is
[38:13] out there the reason the world is in the
[38:16] condition is is because they rejected
[38:18] the remedy for it not to be that way
[38:21] that's why the young people that's why
[38:22] our colleges that's why our presidents
[38:24] that's why it's all going Amen to hell
[38:26] so to speak in a hand basket ain't that
[38:28] right because they rejected Jesus Christ
[38:32] just as an individual how many knows you
[38:33] as an individual you get away from God
[38:35] and you watch you watch what happens you
[38:37] get further and further and further away
[38:39] from God and you once away you w wake up
[38:41] and say man how did I get so far amen my
[38:46] but the Bride of Jesus Christ and it's
[38:48] man's how many knows it's man's it's
[38:50] man's ways it's kind of built in US Amen
[38:53] to get away from God the cycle of death
[38:56] and Revival always repeated itself
[38:58] always go oh my but aren't you glad that
[39:01] there was a word spoken in this message
[39:04] that said that's not going to happen in

[42:27] do have to be careful even Paul warned
[42:29] us Amen in chapter 10 and we'll go a few
[42:33] more minutes that all right chapter 10
[42:34] of Corinthians he says more moreover
[42:36] Breen I would have not have you ignorant
[42:38] how that all of our fathers were under
[42:40] the cloud and all pass through the sea
[42:42] and all were baptized unto Moses in the
[42:44] cloud and in the sea and they all eat
[42:47] the same spiritual meat and they all
[42:49] drank the same spiritual drink for they
[42:51] drank of that spiritual Rock they
[42:53] followed them then that rock was Christ
[42:56] how many believe that's what we preached
[42:57] on Wednesday amen that that spring that
[43:00] flows up that rock that we can drink out
[43:02] of just speak to the Rock anything you
[43:04] need but there's a lot of people that
[43:06] eat and drink come to church
[43:11] amen I'm telling you telling you of
[43:14] people that have backlit and gotten away
[43:16] from God and you thought they never
[43:18] would it's almost scary ain't it like
[43:21] what in the
[43:23] world it makes you say God yeah God help
[43:26] me that right Lord you know let me take
[43:30] the warning that Paul said let him that
[43:33] thinketh he standeth take heed least he
[43:35] fall amen stay humble before Mighty God
[43:39] Amen they were all under the cloud they
[43:41] all were baptized unto Moses amen let me
[43:44] say a lot of them were baptized those
[43:46] Pentecostals were baptized any merss in
[43:49] the name of Jesus Christ that's why many
[43:51] of them spoke in tongues and all these
[43:53] other things but where are they today
[43:56] amen they all drank the same spiritual
[43:59] meat and so forth but with many of them
[44:02] God was not well pleased for they were
[44:04] overthrown in the
[44:06] wilderness oh my let's not be overthrown
[44:09] now these things were our example to the
[44:11] intent that we should not lust after
[44:13] evil things as they also lusted but does
[44:16] the Bible say every man is tempted when
[44:18] he's drawn away of his own rust and it
[44:19] TI and when you go that way it ends up
[44:23] in sin and sin brings you into death
[44:26] that's what happened to Israel they were
[44:29] overthrown talking about scary people uh
[44:32] you know to think that two people out of
[44:36] two
[44:38] million Joshua and Caleb out of the
[44:40] original Bunch after they came out of
[44:43] Egypt they had children a't that right
[44:45] they had children and so forth but after
[44:48] kades
[44:49] Bia when they would not believe the
[44:51] spies and so forth when they came back
[44:53] went back it was a judgment brother said
[44:56] called a judgment they went back into
[44:58] the Wilderness none of one of them Jesus
[45:01] said every one of them died in the
[45:03] wilderness and then Joshua and Caleb
[45:05] took their children in sure their
[45:08] children went in but those million those
[45:09] two million didn't why because they were
[45:12] overthrown they were make Believers like
[45:14] I said a make believer is
[45:19] tossed first trial that comes along they
[45:22] seen all the signs they seen all the
[45:24] Wonders
[45:26] oh I don't know about you but I'm not
[45:28] just seen signs and wonders through the
[45:29] prophets and message I believe that but
[45:31] when you see God working in your own
[45:33] life and then something else comes up
[45:35] and you murmur and complain about it
[45:38] huh don't let that unbelief what did
[45:40] Paul say you know be be careful at least
[45:43] there be among you one that is with an
[45:46] evil heart of
[45:47] unbelief amen be careful make
[45:51] sure now these things are example amen
[45:53] neither be idolators or some of them
[45:55] were
[45:58] now can I just read put my own scripture
[46:00] in here a little bit they put something
[46:03] else before
[46:05] God anything you put before God is an
[46:08] idol that's right God ain't first in
[46:10] your life how many believes that's why
[46:12] you got to be careful that every
[46:14] day every day keep God first every day
[46:18] examine if God is first or if whatever
[46:20] else you're doing is the firsted don't
[46:23] be an
[46:24] idolater
[46:26] verse 8 let us not commit fornication
[46:28] some of them committed and fell in one
[46:30] day three and 20,000 neither let us
[46:33] tempt Christ as some of them also
[46:35] tempted and were destroyed of serpents
[46:37] neither murmur ye as some of them also
[46:40] murmured and were destroyed of Destroyer
[46:43] now all these things happened unto them
[46:45] for an samples and they were written for
[46:47] our admission upon whom the ends of the
[46:48] Earth or the world are
[46:50] come Lord help me don't let me be an
[46:54] idolator don't let me be a Fric these
[46:57] are example don't let be a bur be a
[46:59] murmur don't let me complain don't let
[47:03] me disbelieve you

[47:09] knowing that whatever problem comes up
[47:12] next if God took care of your last
[47:14] problem if he delivered you from your
[47:16] last trial he'll deliver you from the
[47:18] next trial he'll deliver you from the
[47:20] next
