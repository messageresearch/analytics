[1:31:52] it's priceless so praise be to god this
[1:31:55] morning we want to talk about when the
[1:31:56] word drops from our head
[1:31:58] to our heart amen the difference between
[1:32:01] head religion
[1:32:02] and heart religion amen would that be
[1:32:04] okay
[1:32:06] and i want to speak about the rock
[1:32:08] little phrase
[1:32:10] uh if i might that little phrase that
[1:32:14] you've heard people
[1:32:15] make perhaps in a relationship or
[1:32:18] whatever it might be
[1:32:19] people will say well it's complicated
[1:32:23] amen so we're going to talk about is
[1:32:26] complicated for a while this morning
[1:32:28] also
[1:32:31] usually i come up here and say it's
[1:32:32] simple you know it's just simple
[1:32:35] you know but this morning we're going to
[1:32:36] talk about the complicated part is that
[1:32:38] okay
[1:32:39] amen praise be to god amen god bless you
[1:32:43] if you will open your bibles this
[1:32:45] morning
[1:32:46] amen and we'll just get into the word
[1:32:50] let god have his way amen
[1:32:53] i'll tell you what you know when
[1:32:56] wednesday night service when the lord
[1:32:58] just showed me how that
[1:33:00] you know that it's on our lap and how
[1:33:02] that really it's
[1:33:04] up to us to open up our hearts and our
[1:33:06] minds
[1:33:07] except what god has done already amen
[1:33:10] amen and so
[1:33:11] but it does have to go further than just
[1:33:13] our head how many knows that is
[1:33:15] much further than just our head
[1:33:16] knowledge or accept it again to our mind
[1:33:19] it also has to drop
[1:33:20] down into your heart otherwise
[1:33:24] it will never do you what it's supposed
[1:33:25] to do amen and so
[1:33:28] we'll start out with complication part
[1:33:30] amen and that is in matthew
[1:33:32] the 13th
[1:33:35] amen matthew 13
[1:33:39] amen and the kingdom of heaven now how
[1:33:41] many knows that when jesus mentioned to
[1:33:43] kingdom of heaven i didn't really
[1:33:45] uh go into it but i see another
[1:33:48] scripture here here's another one here
[1:33:51] uh you know i just look at this matthew
[1:33:54] here and we're going to be dealing
[1:33:55] dealing with matthew quite a bit but
[1:33:58] let's just go
[1:33:59] uh you know to um verse 44 of chapter
[1:34:05] 13.
[1:34:08] i see another one here i'm just going to
[1:34:10] read those four to
[1:34:11] because we want to talk about the
[1:34:13] likening how did jesus
[1:34:15] christ likened the kingdom of heaven to
[1:34:18] many different things somebody knows
[1:34:19] that
[1:34:20] not just one but many different things
[1:34:21] one of them is in verse 44.
[1:34:23] the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
[1:34:25] treasure hid in the field
[1:34:28] all right down in verse 31 he says he
[1:34:30] put a pup put forth a parable
[1:34:33] for saying the kingdom of heaven is
[1:34:35] liking a grain of mustard seed
[1:34:37] which you man took and sowed over in
[1:34:39] verse 24 if you're chapter 13.
[1:34:42] now you got to kind of follow me here
[1:34:44] but here again he talks about the
[1:34:45] kingdom of heaven in verse 24.
[1:34:48] and he put it forth another parable
[1:34:49] saying the kingdom of heaven is like and
[1:34:50] unto a man
[1:34:51] which sowed good seed in his field amen
[1:34:55] and of course we know that's just a few
[1:34:56] of them what i want to deal with
[1:34:58] this morning with the help of the lord
[1:34:59] is found in chapter
[1:35:01] 13 and verse 47. same chapter down in
[1:35:04] verse 7
[1:35:05] 47 and we want to start there and just
[1:35:07] read a couple of verses there and we'll
[1:35:09] go from there again the kingdom of
[1:35:13] heaven is likened unto
[1:35:14] a net that was thrown
[1:35:17] into the sea and gathered of
[1:35:21] every kind
[1:35:24] how many know this is where it gets
[1:35:26] complicated
[1:35:28] not just one kind or two kinds
[1:35:31] how many knows there's more than just
[1:35:32] one kind or two kinds
[1:35:35] and then there's more kinds than just
[1:35:37] that but of every kind
[1:35:40] all right
[1:35:44] and was cast until all right
[1:35:48] and gather the very kind verse 48 which
[1:35:51] when it was full they drew to shore
[1:35:55] and sat down and gathered the good
[1:35:58] into vessels but cast the bad way
[1:36:02] and so shall it be at the end of the
[1:36:04] world the angels will come forth
[1:36:06] and sever the wicked from among the just
[1:36:08] may god had his blessings to the reagan
[1:36:10] word
[1:36:11] you can be seated this morning amen
[1:36:15] so here we look at first of all we look
[1:36:17] at this we see that there's
[1:36:19] a lot of different kinds amen that is
[1:36:22] caught
[1:36:23] in the net of the gospel
[1:36:28] amen it just comes to mind that whenever
[1:36:31] jesus preached and
[1:36:34] it talks about the multitudes followed
[1:36:36] him
[1:36:37] isn't that right multitudes followed
[1:36:40] jesus
[1:36:41] and then they they followed him and they
[1:36:44] got him out there and
[1:36:45] in the wilderness so to speak or out you
[1:36:47] know where they didn't have
[1:36:48] you know a nice restaurant to take
[1:36:50] everybody or whatever
[1:36:52] and they got in a pickle
[1:36:55] jesus got his congregation in a pickle
[1:36:59] all right they didn't have any food
[1:37:02] isn't that right and they said jesus we
[1:37:04] got a problem here
[1:37:06] we ain't got nothing to feed the people
[1:37:10] [Laughter]
[1:37:12] amen are you with me this morning how
[1:37:15] many knows you can't get jesus in a
[1:37:17] pickle
[1:37:19] ah he always comes out of it right amen
[1:37:22] whenever you're following jesus you
[1:37:24] ain't got to worry about
[1:37:25] getting in a bind oh you'll get in a
[1:37:28] bind no doubt
[1:37:30] but you've got one that'll get you out
[1:37:32] of the vine
[1:37:34] that's the good thing about following
[1:37:37] christ
[1:37:38] and there's a whole difference between
[1:37:40] amen the believer and the unbeliever
[1:37:42] amen because the believer
[1:37:44] has the same troubles that the
[1:37:46] unbeliever has
[1:37:48] but the believer has somebody that'll
[1:37:50] get him out of trouble
[1:37:53] that's so good isn't it that's what
[1:37:55] gives us joy
[1:37:57] amen i don't care i don't care what it
[1:38:00] is that's right
[1:38:02] all right no matter where whether it's
[1:38:05] financial spiritual whatever it is
[1:38:07] god always can get you out now
[1:38:11] you know you know you you know it's
[1:38:13] complicated but you got to understand
[1:38:15] god's ways
[1:38:17] that sometimes it don't seem like he
[1:38:19] gets you out of it
[1:38:22] like he don't answer your prayers like
[1:38:25] you pray and pray and pray and pray and
[1:38:27] pray
[1:38:27] he just don't answer it seems like
[1:38:29] brother bram said isn't that right
[1:38:30] you know and he is that's when he's
[1:38:33] testing your faith
[1:38:35] to see whether you really believe it or
[1:38:37] not
[1:38:39] in that right because that's truly when
[1:38:41] we find out whether you believe it or
[1:38:42] not
[1:38:42] if he tests you like that so he got him
[1:38:45] in the mind so to speak and
[1:38:48] and of course you know that's when the
[1:38:50] great miracle was done
[1:38:52] amen about the little boy with the
[1:38:54] fishes and the loaves and how that
[1:38:56] took many many baskets up after he was
[1:39:00] done with
[1:39:01] amen and then if you'll notice if you're
[1:39:03] reading the scriptures you'll find that
[1:39:05] jesus went somewhere else and a lot of
[1:39:08] different ones
[1:39:09] followed him to where he was at even
[1:39:11] over there
[1:39:12] isn't that right and jesus was a little
[1:39:15] mean
[1:39:17] jesus got a little mean
[1:39:21] and what did he say he says he didn't
[1:39:23] follow me because of the miracles but
[1:39:25] you followed me because of the loaves
[1:39:27] and the fishes
[1:39:30] sting huh that's right he said you're
[1:39:33] just after you're just coming after
[1:39:35] because of the loaves and the fishes and
[1:39:37] so forth
[1:39:37] and so unfortunately that's why some
[1:39:40] people follow him
[1:39:42] it's just the blessing of it not really
[1:39:45] dedicated because whenever he begin to
[1:39:47] say
[1:39:48] unless you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:39:50] blood you have no life
[1:39:51] in you from that point all of those
[1:39:55] folks begin to
[1:39:56] wander away begin to drift away
[1:40:00] amen and so that was like that net that
[1:40:02] he was talking about
[1:40:04] it catches all kinds of people
[1:40:08] it catches all kinds of people that's
[1:40:10] right we know there's three different
[1:40:12] kinds of believers there's believers
[1:40:14] there's make believers and there's
[1:40:16] unbelievers
[1:40:18] and we know that there's another
[1:40:20] category of
[1:40:22] uh the make believers that they're also
[1:40:24] hypocrites
[1:40:27] and that right pharisees and so forth
[1:40:29] they're hypocrites
[1:40:31] there's the class of being wolves
[1:40:35] in sheep's clothes
[1:40:39] amen is it complicated yeah
[1:40:42] it's kind of complicated you have to
[1:40:44] watch it because
[1:40:45] i'll tell you this right now as you amen
[1:40:48] get caught with the gospel
[1:40:50] net and you come into amen to the saving
[1:40:52] grace of almighty god you're gonna find
[1:40:55] that uh it's not just everybody that
[1:40:58] names the name of jesus
[1:41:00] is really a christian
[1:41:04] i'll tell you what right now if
[1:41:05] hypocrites and so-called believers can
[1:41:08] throw you off
[1:41:09] you're fixing to get thrown off
[1:41:10] [Music]
[1:41:12] because there's plenty of them around
[1:41:15] amen but you know the one thing i will
[1:41:18] say about this
[1:41:19] is i even begin to get into it that
[1:41:21] sooner or later
[1:41:22] you show what you are by the fruit that
[1:41:25] you bear
[1:41:26] your folly sooner or later is made
[1:41:30] manifest
[1:41:33] it'll be made manifest just as janus and
[1:41:36] jamboree's folly was made manifest so
[1:41:38] all make believers and unbelievers and
[1:41:40] so forth sooner or later do you manifest
[1:41:43] what you are
[1:41:46] praise the lord and that's what it's all
[1:41:48] about it's about what you
[1:41:49] read out in here to him that have
[1:41:53] for him shall be given unto him that
[1:41:55] hath not from him shall be taken even
[1:41:58] that
[1:41:58] which he does have you've got to have
[1:42:01] something down
[1:42:02] in here
[1:42:05] amen it's got to be down here not just
[1:42:07] up here because so many have it up here
[1:42:12] people have it intellectually they
[1:42:15] understand that they can quote you the
[1:42:17] quotes
[1:42:17] but it's not down here and it doesn't
[1:42:20] matter how much they try
[1:42:22] it doesn't matter what they do they end
[1:42:23] up not being able to live it
[1:42:29] amen because you're going to live what's
[1:42:30] down in here you're going to follow that
[1:42:33] nature
[1:42:36] amen and we realize that this next
[1:42:39] gospel net
[1:42:41] amen we could say that it was the gospel
[1:42:43] of this message
[1:42:45] amen sister angie god bless you it's
[1:42:47] good to see you this morning
[1:42:48] amen we're praying for adam amen
[1:42:52] in this gospel net amen this message and
[1:42:56] it catches
[1:42:57] every kind
[1:43:00] amen and me my wife was talking we were
[1:43:02] thinking about how that there's so many
[1:43:05] amen that can absolutely listen to the
[1:43:08] tapes and they can hear
[1:43:10] jesus come down and to discern the
[1:43:12] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:43:14] amen knowing that that is god almighty
[1:43:17] doing that and they can be raised in
[1:43:22] that and have their mom and dad teach
[1:43:24] them all the jews and adults and
[1:43:26] everything about the word of god
[1:43:27] they can teach all of that but never get
[1:43:30] it down here
[1:43:32] and i can name you names of people that
[1:43:34] even came to this church that went out
[1:43:36] there and became
[1:43:37] lesbians that's right
[1:43:40] attended this church for a long time
[1:43:44] folks you might think oh that's way out
[1:43:46] there folks you don't realize
[1:43:48] that if you get it just in here and it
[1:43:51] don't come down here
[1:43:53] ain't nothing going to hold you it's not
[1:43:55] enough
[1:43:56] even the prophet talked about moses his
[1:43:59] mama
[1:44:00] had taught him and taught him and taught
[1:44:01] him and taught him and he tried to go
[1:44:03] upon what his mama taught him and he
[1:44:06] killed that egyptian
[1:44:08] and he ended up a complete and total
[1:44:10] failure
[1:44:12] why because he was head knowledge and
[1:44:14] not a
[1:44:15] personal experience with almighty god
[1:44:19] how many know god don't have
[1:44:20] grandchildren amen you can't go by
[1:44:23] somebody else's experience you can't go
[1:44:25] by what the preacher says
[1:44:28] it has to be your revelation a personal
[1:44:31] experience to you your mom and daddy
[1:44:33] they teach you and that's good they
[1:44:35] should
[1:44:35] amen but i'm here to tell you if it
[1:44:37] doesn't something happen
[1:44:39] somewhere in your teenage life you get a
[1:44:41] backside of the desert
[1:44:43] and you meet god amen and he changes
[1:44:45] your nature
[1:44:46] he changes your desires amen he baptizes
[1:44:49] you with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:44:52] there ain't a thing in the world that'll
[1:44:54] hold you
[1:44:56] amen you'll wiggle back out into the
[1:45:00] ocean
[1:45:01] amen
[1:45:06] it's complicated so you see folks
[1:45:09] there's all kinds
[1:45:11] even jesus said when he said about the
[1:45:13] sower that went forth the soul
[1:45:15] the word of god is that right it was
[1:45:18] complicated some fell
[1:45:20] on stony places some did this some did
[1:45:22] that some did did some did that
[1:45:25] not always so simple amen he said it
[1:45:28] this way
[1:45:29] hear you the parable of the sower when
[1:45:32] one hear
[1:45:32] the word of god of the kingdom he
[1:45:34] understandeth it not
[1:45:36] now notice how many knows that
[1:45:37] understand is something that you do with
[1:45:40] your heart
[1:45:42] not just your head amen
[1:45:46] then cometh the wicked one and catches
[1:45:49] away that which was sown in his heart
[1:45:51] and this is he which receives seed by
[1:45:54] the wayside
[1:45:56] but he that receiveth heat on stony
[1:45:58] places the same is he that
[1:46:00] heareth the word and annoy with joy
[1:46:03] receiveth it
[1:46:06] i don't know i've seen it i'm lived long
[1:46:09] enough now to have seen
[1:46:11] where people can rejoice and shout and
[1:46:13] witness and
[1:46:14] testify oh my
[1:46:19] and die and before they die
[1:46:23] they have strayed so far out into the
[1:46:25] world again
[1:46:28] that they say there is no such thing as
[1:46:30] a christian
[1:46:31] amen
[1:46:36] folks it may be that there's just a few
[1:46:38] real christians
[1:46:40] but i believe there's christians amen
[1:46:44] and if you're looking for a perfect
[1:46:45] christian never make a mistake well
[1:46:47] guess what
[1:46:48] your eyes are going to get real sore
[1:46:50] looking
[1:46:52] because we all make mistakes don't we
[1:46:55] amen we're mistakes but we hate our
[1:46:57] mistakes we repent of our mistakes isn't
[1:46:59] that right
[1:47:00] but we do make them amen and so you got
[1:47:02] to be careful what you look at
[1:47:04] because you think it's not so simple
[1:47:07] mean he that per that person was no
[1:47:08] doubt not perfect
[1:47:09] but with another man somebody that would
[1:47:12] reach out and oh just try to share the
[1:47:14] message
[1:47:14] try to get people to christ is that
[1:47:17] right
[1:47:18] then eventually go off way off into the
[1:47:20] field
[1:47:22] amen and have to die such a terrible
[1:47:25] thing
[1:47:27] i think the believer has to make sure
[1:47:30] that he understands
[1:47:31] these complicated things
[1:47:35] a christian has to understand these
[1:47:37] complications
[1:47:39] amen a complication like
[1:47:43] matthew 4 24 24
[1:47:46] all right it's complicated for there
[1:47:49] shall arise
[1:47:50] false christs and false prophets
[1:47:55] and shall show great signs and wonders
[1:47:58] in so much that
[1:47:59] if it were possible it would deceive the
[1:48:02] very elect
[1:48:05] come on folks now we understand through
[1:48:08] the prophet of god that that christ
[1:48:10] is the holy spirit so false anointed
[1:48:14] ones
[1:48:15] isn't that right people can get anointed
[1:48:18] on the flesh
[1:48:19] they can get anointed on the spirit they
[1:48:22] can shout
[1:48:23] they can speak in tongues they can
[1:48:25] prophesy
[1:48:26] they can even do miracles things like
[1:48:29] that when they get over there
[1:48:30] the bible says that heaven we have cast
[1:48:32] out devils and then
[1:48:34] your name and done many mighty works he
[1:48:36] don't deny that they did it
[1:48:38] and they're right he don't deny that
[1:48:41] because he was perhaps just on their
[1:48:43] flesh or in their spirit
[1:48:45] but it's got to get deeper than that
[1:48:50] you know right yeah it's complicated
[1:48:52] people you think oh he's a real
[1:48:54] spiritual person
[1:48:56] that person's real spiritual person
[1:49:00] amen and we like to see that in each
[1:49:02] other
[1:49:04] i believe a real christian will be a
[1:49:06] spiritual person
[1:49:08] but see folks how many knows that it's
[1:49:10] an endurance contest
[1:49:12] he that endureth unto the end
[1:49:15] it's about getting a hold of something
[1:49:17] in our age young people listen
[1:49:20] i got a hold of it or god it got a hold
[1:49:22] of me
[1:49:23] i like to put it that way
[1:49:26] let something get ahold of you because
[1:49:29] when that something gets ahold of you
[1:49:31] it will seal you until the day of your
[1:49:35] redemption
[1:49:36] amen it might look like no there's no
[1:49:38] such a thing as eternal security there's
[1:49:41] no such thing
[1:49:42] as salvation once once saved always
[1:49:45] saved
[1:49:47] huh jesus said when all that the father
[1:49:50] has given me
[1:49:51] will come and i will lose none of them
[1:49:55] he didn't say i'm gonna lose a few huh
[1:49:58] if he is gonna lose a few he's gonna let
[1:50:00] you know
[1:50:03] huh he says haven't i chosen you twelve
[1:50:06] and one of you is the devil and you're
[1:50:07] gonna betray me
[1:50:09] yeah you're going to be gone but he
[1:50:10] already knows that
[1:50:13] and he came up to the place of
[1:50:14] justification come up to the place of
[1:50:16] sanctification
[1:50:17] but never went on to the baptism in the
[1:50:19] holy ghost he couldn't go on
[1:50:21] amen so you got to make sure that it's
[1:50:24] not just on your flesh
[1:50:25] a good sunday morning hallelujah dance
[1:50:28] in the spirit kind of service
[1:50:30] not just something that cleans you out
[1:50:32] and gets his eyes of the world away and
[1:50:34] makes you a new person
[1:50:36] but you've got to make sure that that
[1:50:38] gets filled with the holy ghost
[1:50:40] down in your soul down in your nature
[1:50:45] though you would want to walk away from
[1:50:47] it god won't
[1:50:48] let you walk away
[1:50:52] amen you might want to fall but god
[1:50:54] won't let you fall
[1:50:57] praise be to god what did brother brown
[1:50:58] say after he lost his wife and his child
[1:51:01] and god put a black blanket and
[1:51:03] refused to hear his prayer and the devil
[1:51:05] said you know god doesn't really love
[1:51:07] you
[1:51:07] and he was about to think amen if that's
[1:51:10] how god's gonna be
[1:51:11] but he didn't say it he says god you
[1:51:13] gave you taken away blessed be the name
[1:51:15] of the lord
[1:51:16] his doctor friend says hey did you keep
[1:51:19] your religion brother
[1:51:20] adam he says no but it helped me

[1:53:25] you what
[1:53:26] people need god this guy needs god
[1:53:29] and it was i thought why does he work

[1:53:34] but he went by and i said sir i don't
[1:53:37] know you might not think i should have
[1:53:38] but

[1:53:50] shifting sands
[1:53:53] look at that and caleb done seen it

[1:54:15] and this isn't suicide we go down here
[1:54:18] by
[1:54:18] elkton and two girls walking down the
[1:54:20] street holding hands in our little town
[1:54:23] folks this place is certainly corrupt
[1:54:26] it's getting worse and worse isn't it
[1:54:29] but lord we don't look at that and i
[1:54:30] look at that man and i think that's some
[1:54:33] mom's boy that's some
[1:54:36] mom's boy that needs the lord jesus
[1:54:39] christ
[1:54:40] that needs to know what real joy is
[1:54:45] huh think about it he's a soul
[1:54:48] amen and i you know outside of the
[1:54:50] blasphemy of the holy ghost
[1:54:52] you wouldn't what if you were your son
[1:54:54] got in that condition
[1:54:55] you think about even around the message
[1:54:57] folks you know becoming lesbian
[1:54:59] different things
[1:55:00] you know you just feel so bad you're
[1:55:01] like why why
[1:55:03] and it's only one reason that's because
[1:55:05] of the grace of god
[1:55:06] that is in your heart that you aren't
[1:55:08] looking like that
[1:55:10] that we aren't acting like that it's
[1:55:12] only the mercy and grace of god
[1:55:14] i'm saying god thank you lord jesus
[1:55:17] and help these poor people as the
[1:55:19] prophet said they're objects of pity you
[1:55:21] pity them
[1:55:23] they try to have some kind of joy and
[1:55:25] they can't find it it's not out there
[1:55:27] amen but there's all kinds listen all
[1:55:30] kinds and even jesus said
[1:55:32] and i don't think i finished let me can
[1:55:33] i read this but here
[1:55:35] uh so we find matthew 24 there of course
[1:55:39] that's where he says you know that it
[1:55:40] would if it was possible
[1:55:42] it would deceive the very elected amen
[1:55:47] back to the seed but he that receiveth
[1:55:49] the seed in stony places the same is he
[1:55:51] that heareth the word
[1:55:52] and anoint with joy receiveth it
[1:55:55] yet hath not root in himself
[1:56:00] i mean please that's where it's at it's
[1:56:02] about what's down in there
[1:56:05] way down what kind of roots that you
[1:56:07] have
[1:56:09] you see people and you want to say why
[1:56:12] why can't they see it why
[1:56:14] can't why can't people just know that
[1:56:16] surrendering to the lord jesus christ
[1:56:18] it's the best thing you'll ever do get
[1:56:20] baptized in his name
[1:56:22] give your heart to god and i'll tell you
[1:56:24] what
[1:56:25] life is gonna be good
[1:56:28] oh i don't care if it's troubles trials
[1:56:31] i don't care what comes along
[1:56:32] it's still good but you have god in your
[1:56:35] heart
[1:56:36] to know that there's something that
[1:56:38] holds you
[1:56:40] an anchor that holds you
[1:56:45] when we talk about what that anchor is
[1:56:46] how many knows what that anchor is
[1:56:49] amen all right now notice
[1:56:52] and he had earth for a while
[1:56:58] for when tribulation and persecution
[1:57:00] arises because of the word
[1:57:02] by and by he is offended
[1:57:06] so jesus talking about this net in
[1:57:08] heaven the gospel net that catches every
[1:57:11] kind
[1:57:15] amen by and by he is offended by and by
[1:57:19] he wiggles back out
[1:57:21] and he also which received seed among
[1:57:23] the thorns
[1:57:25] is he which heareth the word
[1:57:29] and the care of this world
[1:57:32] and the deceitfulness of riches
[1:57:36] choked the word and he becometh
[1:57:40] unfruitful
[1:57:43] you know as a christian as a christian i
[1:57:46] think your worst worry is
[1:57:48] that you just have no fruit in claiming
[1:57:50] that you're christian amen
[1:57:54] i have a scripture that just comes to
[1:57:56] mind
[1:57:58] i don't have this wrote down but i'm
[1:58:01] going to go to it if i can just for a
[1:58:02] minute is that okay
[1:58:08] in second peter in verse chapter 1
[1:58:13] in verse 8 for if these things be in you
[1:58:17] and abound they make you that you shall
[1:58:20] neither be
[1:58:22] barren nor unfruitful
[1:58:26] in the knowledge of the lord jesus
[1:58:28] christ
[1:58:29] amen but he that lacketh thee things
[1:58:33] is blind and cannot see afar off and has
[1:58:36] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:58:38] old sins
[1:58:40] amen so he says there that we make sure
[1:58:43] if these things be in you they make you
[1:58:44] that you are bound and that you're not
[1:58:46] unfruitful in the knowledge of the lord
[1:58:49] jesus christ
[1:58:50] amen moses i want to use moses as an
[1:58:54] example for just a minute
[1:58:56] there was two parts to moses one of them
[1:58:59] was
[1:58:59] and i heard about the man said he says
[1:59:01] you know moses he tried to do things
[1:59:04] just
[1:59:04] upon what his mom had told him
[1:59:08] what he knew mentally what his mom told
[1:59:11] him
[1:59:12] no doubt but his mom told him now son
[1:59:15] because i'm gonna know is that he got to
[1:59:17] be raised by his own mother
[1:59:20] pharaoh's daughter and he know that she
[1:59:22] told him that you were born a proper
[1:59:24] child there was something special
[1:59:26] at your birth that took place and we
[1:59:29] knew that
[1:59:30] god had a purpose for you and god
[1:59:32] revealed to us that we're to put you in
[1:59:34] this little basket and then we'll put
[1:59:36] you in the nile river among the
[1:59:38] crocodiles
[1:59:39] amen if we trusted god he's going to
[1:59:41] take care of you amen and sure enough
[1:59:43] you floated right down by the palace
[1:59:45] amen and the current took you in in one
[1:59:48] of the little backwashes perhaps
[1:59:50] and uh pharaoh's daughter wanted a
[1:59:52] little boy wanted a child and she seen
[1:59:54] that little baby
[1:59:55] and she went out there and grabbed that
[1:59:56] little baby and it was you
[1:59:58] and they went to israel and they began
[2:00:00] to ask and for a wet mother
[2:00:02] amen and i volunteered and i got to
[2:00:04] raise yours and i want you to know
[2:00:06] god has a plan for you
[2:00:09] oh he knew all of this that he was
[2:00:11] called and he believed that he was
[2:00:13] supposed to be the deliverer
[2:00:15] and he did it with his own carnal self
[2:00:17] now how many know
[2:00:18] the complication of amen even the gospel
[2:00:21] is
[2:00:21] is there's always a spiritual believer
[2:00:24] and there's always a carnal believer
[2:00:27] amen by the bible says every revival
[2:00:30] produces
[2:00:31] twins oh my wife
[2:00:34] it gets complicated every revival
[2:00:37] produces twins
[2:00:38] there's always a person that just
[2:00:40] understands it naturally
[2:00:42] and that there's a person that has it
[2:00:43] down in their heart and
[2:00:45] in their soul
[2:00:49] amen oh my and every revival
[2:00:54] moses naturally understood it amen and
[2:00:57] he became a complete failure
[2:00:59] he completely failed amen by his natural
[2:01:02] senses and by his
[2:01:03] own ability his own thoughts how many
[2:01:06] thankful for the grace of all
[2:01:09] almighty god because if you know him on
[2:01:11] a spiritual level on a spiritual basis
[2:01:14] it's not something amen that flesh and
[2:01:16] blood has revealed to you
[2:01:18] but it's something that you've had a
[2:01:19] personal experience with almighty god
[2:01:25] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[2:01:28] i mean that's a rock that every
[2:01:30] individual we as
[2:01:32] christians have to make sure that our
[2:01:34] soul has been anchored to
[2:01:38] everything's shifting there's all kinds
[2:01:40] there's all different things
[2:01:42] but there's also a rock that our souls
[2:01:45] can anchor to
[2:01:47] if it ever anchors are you are
[2:01:50] looking at a living testimony
[2:01:53] of when a soul that is anchored in
[2:01:56] christ
[2:01:58] that anchor holds
[2:02:01] it's that anchor holding it's not you
[2:02:04] holding it's
[2:02:05] him holding amen
[2:02:09] how many is thankful for that
[2:02:12] we're going to talk about moses other
[2:02:14] side here in a minute
[2:02:19] but in matthew 16 a familiar very
[2:02:21] familiar scripture for us
[2:02:23] 16 and verse 13 jesus came to the coast
[2:02:26] of caesarea
[2:02:27] philippi he asked his disciples saying
[2:02:29] who men who do men say that i the son of
[2:02:31] man
[2:02:32] am and they said some of them say that
[2:02:34] thou art john the baptist
[2:02:35] some elias others jeremiah or one of the
[2:02:38] prophets
[2:02:40] amen he saith them with whom do ye say
[2:02:43] that i
[2:02:43] am amen and simon peter answered and
[2:02:47] said thou art the christ the son of the
[2:02:49] living god
[2:02:51] remember peter had a revelation of who
[2:02:54] jesus was and when all those two
[2:02:56] all those other disciples left him 70 of
[2:02:59] them and he says are you all gonna go
[2:03:01] away too
[2:03:04] he had a revelation to whom shall we go
[2:03:09] is that right he had something that held
[2:03:11] him in there right
[2:03:12] held him in that time amen
[2:03:15] all right he said peter said thou art
[2:03:17] the christ the son of the living god and
[2:03:19] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[2:03:21] art thou
[2:03:21] simon barjona for flesh and blood has
[2:03:24] not
[2:03:25] revealed this to you
[2:03:29] but my father which is in heaven amen
[2:03:32] how many knows that was
[2:03:33] listen and he says and i say unto you
[2:03:35] that thou art peter
[2:03:37] and upon this rock i will build my
[2:03:40] church and the gates of hell shall not
[2:03:42] prevail against it
[2:03:43] now the catholics say that peter was the
[2:03:45] rock
[2:03:47] it took a prophet of god in this
[2:03:49] generation saying that
[2:03:51] peter was no rock he forsook him and
[2:03:54] denied him three times that's not a
[2:03:55] whole lot of a rock
[2:03:57] and they're right he had the keys to the
[2:04:00] kingdom sure he did
[2:04:02] but it wasn't this at all it took his
[2:04:04] profit to pull out the fact
[2:04:06] that flesh and blood had not revealed
[2:04:08] this to him
[2:04:09] amen it was the revelation of who jesus
[2:04:13] christ was
[2:04:15] and how many knows that anybody ever
[2:04:17] come in contact with jesus
[2:04:19] you can never be the same again
[2:04:23] you'll either be worse and i don't mean
[2:04:26] just a little bird worse but you'll be a
[2:04:28] lot worse
[2:04:29] because you reject him like the rich man
[2:04:31] did
[2:04:32] or you accept him into your heart and he
[2:04:35] changes you
[2:04:36] forever amen and when you get a
[2:04:40] revelation a revelation
[2:04:42] is when god makes himself known to you
[2:04:45] personally what did that prophet teach
[2:04:49] us that the bible
[2:04:50] amen and salvation and god deals with
[2:04:53] the gentiles
[2:04:54] as a what
[2:04:57] individual as an individual he deals
[2:05:00] with even though we're a group of here
[2:05:02] and there's certain laws certain things
[2:05:04] that affects everybody and so forth but
[2:05:05] when it comes to dealing with people
[2:05:07] god deals with every one of us
[2:05:10] individually
[2:05:12] that's why you can have a service and
[2:05:13] you're bored stiff
[2:05:17] but the next person will come and say
[2:05:19] that's the best best message i ever
[2:05:21] heard
[2:05:22] it just spoke right to my heart thank
[2:05:23] you brother huh
[2:05:25] you know and it can be that way because
[2:05:27] it just depends who god is dealing with
[2:05:30] because god deals with each one each one
[2:05:33] of us is
[2:05:33] as an individual and i want you to know
[2:05:36] that you can't be on geek
[2:05:38] god don't have any grandchildren
[2:05:41] that's a second hand experience it don't
[2:05:45] do
[2:05:46] it won't work you can't go by a
[2:05:49] second-hand experience
[2:05:50] and listen how many knows that we need a
[2:05:53] daily
[2:05:54] experience with god
[2:05:58] daily experience
[2:06:04] yes some people well tell me what the
[2:06:07] lord's done for you
[2:06:09] well i tell you what 20 years ago
[2:06:12] 15 years ago he did this
[2:06:15] he healed me he healed my uncle a man or
[2:06:18] whatever it is
[2:06:18] you know 20 years ago that's wonderful
[2:06:22] but tell me something yesterday he spoke
[2:06:25] to me
[2:06:25] and said this or he showed me this
[2:06:29] or he showed me that i want you to know
[2:06:33] that yesterday's experience is no good
[2:06:35] for today
[2:06:36] amen how many knows you know we go well
[2:06:39] when's the last time you pray well two
[2:06:41] weeks ago
[2:06:43] i thought that i prayed lord i'm praying
[2:06:45] here now amen and i'm going to make this
[2:06:47] good for the month
[2:06:49] does it work that way no every day you
[2:06:52] pray every day you have that
[2:06:53] relationship
[2:06:54] it has to be a personal experience
[2:06:57] praise be to god
[2:06:58] flesh and blood so revelation how many
[2:07:00] knows we all know what the prophet said
[2:07:02] about revelation
[2:07:03] amen that can never be over emphasized
[2:07:05] we need
[2:07:06] revelation in our lives we know the
[2:07:09] truth of the word we know i
[2:07:11] understand the word but in the reality
[2:07:14] of it
[2:07:15] isn't real to people i don't know about
[2:07:17] you but i believe that one of these days
[2:07:19] when our bodies change when we begin to
[2:07:21] see our loved ones and
[2:07:22] loved ones up here and so forth i want
[2:07:24] to be in tune to be able to see them
[2:07:27] i want that to be revealed to me so that
[2:07:29] i can take a body change
[2:07:31] i want that body change to be a
[2:07:33] revelation amen even faith is a
[2:07:35] revelation
[2:07:36] something that god reveals to you a
[2:07:38] personal experience with god
[2:07:39] and i believe that this is the this is
[2:07:41] the uh
[2:07:43] kind of the hardcore of it that is
[2:07:46] that it is divinely given
[2:07:50] amen how many knows it's divinely given
[2:07:55] i'll show you how many members brother
[2:07:57] bam saying he says that the man
[2:07:59] told him that uh he said you know well i
[2:08:01] don't accept revelation
[2:08:05] he said then there ain't no way god
[2:08:07] forever to deal with you
[2:08:10] because that's the only way that god
[2:08:11] deals with you is by revelation
[2:08:13] by revealing himself to you
[2:08:17] amen in matthew chapter 11 and verse 25
[2:08:22] at that time jesus answered and said i
[2:08:24] thank thee father
[2:08:26] lord of heaven and earth because thou
[2:08:27] hast hid thee things from the wise
[2:08:30] and the prudent amen so how many knows
[2:08:33] if you're
[2:08:34] resting upon your wisdom or your
[2:08:36] prudence you're probably resting on the
[2:08:38] wrong thing
[2:08:41] now you're resting on what god shows you
[2:08:44] and has revealed them unto babes even so
[2:08:47] father for it seemed
[2:08:48] good in thy sight all things are
[2:08:52] delivered unto me of my father and no
[2:08:54] man
[2:08:55] knoweth the son but the father
[2:08:58] i believe he also says you can't even
[2:09:00] know god then there's no way for you to
[2:09:02] know god
[2:09:03] if you don't believe in revelation no
[2:09:06] man knoweth the son but the father
[2:09:08] needed knoweth any man the father
[2:09:11] saved the son and he to whom the son
[2:09:14] will reveal him amen
[2:09:19] somebody knows you can't really know
[2:09:21] nobody it can't
[2:09:22] be called a called uh call jesus a curse
[2:09:25] so far speaking by the holy ghost
[2:09:27] and no man can call to jesus to christ
[2:09:29] but
[2:09:30] by the holy ghost you might say i know
[2:09:32] him
[2:09:33] folks if you don't have that done in
[2:09:35] your heart you don't know him at all
[2:09:37] you know him by this down in here amen
[2:09:40] so he says you know
[2:09:41] he hid him from the eyes of the wise and
[2:09:43] prudent and revealed them unto babes
[2:09:45] such
[2:09:46] as would learn isn't it something how
[2:09:50] that
[2:09:50] jesus in his time could heal the sick
[2:09:53] raise the dead
[2:09:55] and i just listened to it yesterday
[2:09:57] listening to the bible where
[2:09:58] that young man came and told them
[2:10:00] pharisees you know here's a man that
[2:10:02] opened my eyes my blind eye
[2:10:04] and you're the spiritual leaders and you
[2:10:06] don't know from where he is
[2:10:08] in other words you don't sound like
[2:10:10] you're doing your job
[2:10:13] you're supposed to understand where he's
[2:10:15] from because they would
[2:10:17] boldly set him we don't know where he's
[2:10:19] from he says well isn't this a marvelous
[2:10:20] thing
[2:10:21] you don't know where he's from so people
[2:10:24] amen unless god
[2:10:25] showed him and revealed it to him they
[2:10:26] couldn't see him
[2:10:28] amen let's talk about another kind of
[2:10:31] people for just a minute
[2:10:32] let's talk about the uh we know the
[2:10:34] unbelievers is just like what i showed
[2:10:36] you
[2:10:37] just nothing about god just pure evil
[2:10:40] just
[2:10:41] serving the devil unbelievers right but
[2:10:44] you know there's a kind that's a
[2:10:45] make-believer
[2:10:47] now a make-believer that's where it gets
[2:10:49] complicated
[2:10:51] that's where you know sometimes you boys
[2:10:53] sure looks like they're a believer
[2:10:55] they kind of act like a believer they
[2:10:57] dress like a believer
[2:10:59] but what's way down in here
[2:11:02] amen oh when i think about this
[2:11:08] about how that a real genuine believer
[2:11:11] needs to be able to be able to detect
[2:11:14] and see what's coming at him because if
[2:11:16] you aren't
[2:11:17] you're going to be deceived and you're
[2:11:19] going to be deceived you have to
[2:11:21] that's why that's why you want to you
[2:11:23] want to how many knows you want a
[2:11:24] preacher
[2:11:25] huh you'll be able to tell if i preach
[2:11:28] the truth or not
[2:11:30] you'll know whether it's a bride
[2:11:32] material whether it's
[2:11:34] the truth or not amen but you look at
[2:11:38] the pharisees and how that they were
[2:11:40] and they were make believers and they
[2:11:43] loved
[2:11:44] they loved to be a hypocrite
[2:11:47] they didn't it didn't bother them being
[2:11:49] a hypocrite
[2:11:51] how many in here know that there's some
[2:11:53] things in your life that's hypocritical
[2:11:57] that's right and what does it do to you
[2:11:59] it
[2:12:00] bothers you it makes you get on your
[2:12:02] knees and say god take this away from me
[2:12:05] if i live like this it's going to be a
[2:12:06] bad reflection on you
[2:12:08] lord forgive me take it away that's what
[2:12:10] you and i do
[2:12:12] with our faults our failures and so
[2:12:14] forth
[2:12:16] but these guys they were completely
[2:12:18] content
[2:12:19] being a hypocrite and the outside of
[2:12:22] these guys and then jesus say
[2:12:24] be careful amen beware of
[2:12:28] people that come to you in wolves that
[2:12:30] are wolves
[2:12:31] coming to you in sheep's clothes and so
[2:12:32] forth be careful
[2:12:35] because in this world how many knows
[2:12:37] there's wolves there's sheep
[2:12:39] and then there's wolves and sheep's
[2:12:42] closed
[2:12:43] that's where it gets complicated amen
[2:12:47] because you realize hey you know it
[2:12:48] looks like a sheep
[2:12:50] huh for us turkey hunters we know what
[2:12:53] it's like to take a turkey tail up in
[2:12:55] front of our face
[2:12:57] it never worked for me i put that turkey
[2:12:59] tail up there and they right tail it
[2:13:04] the thing i can do is hide behind a
[2:13:06] fence in some bushes
[2:13:08] but anyway you know they put that in
[2:13:10] front of them these people have no
[2:13:12] problem putting on his sheep clothes
[2:13:14] amen and the beaver jesus said look on
[2:13:16] the outside you guys look good
[2:13:19] you enlarge the borders of your garment
[2:13:20] you look holy
[2:13:22] huh on the outside
[2:13:26] but on the inside it's a different story
[2:13:31] it's complicated they're full of and
[2:13:33] then what he's typing with he says
[2:13:34] you're like a sepulcher
[2:13:36] where on the outside it appears
[2:13:37] beautiful now i don't know i guess this
[2:13:39] upper curve would be the graveyard or
[2:13:41] grave whatever
[2:13:42] but for me it would be your casket
[2:13:46] how many knows that whenever y'all put
[2:13:48] when we put people in the car i ain't
[2:13:50] going to say when y'all put me in there
[2:13:51] i don't want to be in there
[2:13:54] but when you put people in there you can
[2:13:56] stripe it with gold and put flowers and
[2:14:00] eyes so beautiful that is a beautiful
[2:14:02] casket such a beautiful casket
[2:14:06] such a nice casket yeah but he got
[2:14:08] nothing but a dead man in it and he said
[2:14:12] that's what the pharisees were
[2:14:14] on the outside they appeared holy and
[2:14:16] righteous and oh my
[2:14:18] they said long prayers and prayers and
[2:14:21] mind it just
[2:14:22] you know appeared so holy
[2:14:25] but he says inside you're a different
[2:14:28] story
[2:14:30] you're not what you claim to be amen
[2:14:34] you're full of dead men's bones another
[2:14:37] place he said
[2:14:38] full of extortion and hypocrisy and so
[2:14:40] forth
[2:14:41] extortion and evil and wicked hello
[2:14:45] we can come into the house of god and
[2:14:47] praise be to god
[2:14:48] and so forth it's complicated the crow
[2:14:51] can come into church and
[2:14:52] amen preacher and go out there and feed
[2:14:56] on a carrion
[2:14:57] get out there in the things of the world
[2:14:59] and they're right they can eat it in
[2:15:00] both
[2:15:00] but the dove comes in here says praise
[2:15:02] the lord preach it motherbowler
[2:15:04] huh but when it goes out there it can't
[2:15:07] feed on the dead things
[2:15:09] it has to have seed to feed on
[2:15:12] praise the lord oh my
[2:15:15] when you think about that amen because
[2:15:18] why
[2:15:19] it is a something on the inside here
[2:15:23] that takes place we're
[2:15:26] taught that there's three different
[2:15:28] anointings one's flesh one spirit
[2:15:30] one soul amen and i believe it is in
[2:15:33] souls in prison now but the ban
[2:15:35] brought it out how that and it's very
[2:15:37] it's almost hard to believe brother ken
[2:15:39] but
[2:15:39] people can actually do miracles they can
[2:15:42] actually do miracles in the spirit
[2:15:44] even the bible says isn't that right men
[2:15:47] done many
[2:15:48] wonderful works but yet down on the
[2:15:51] inside they were false
[2:15:53] christ false anointed ones
[2:16:02] amen
[2:16:04] but how is their folly made manifest how
[2:16:06] do you know
[2:16:08] give it some time how many usually
[2:16:11] time will tell just just be patient
[2:16:15] just wait just wait wait
[2:16:19] wait be patient
[2:16:25] because a crow cannot follow an eagle
[2:16:29] is that right a hawk cannot follow where
[2:16:32] eagle goes they go so far up what did
[2:16:35] the prophet say that they would do if
[2:16:36] they go that high
[2:16:38] disintegrate that's exactly right they
[2:16:40] would disintegrate
[2:16:41] amen if they went there i say
[2:16:44] that if they try to follow a believer
[2:16:46] they will fail
[2:16:49] they will fail to be able to because you
[2:16:52] try to be a christian
[2:16:53] amen and i'll tell you what when
[2:16:55] somebody smites you on the cheek
[2:16:57] we'll find out if you can turn the other
[2:17:01] we'll see if you can go the extra mile
[2:17:04] well see if you can pers i mean pray for
[2:17:06] them that despitefully use you
[2:17:09] and persecute you i'm here to tell you
[2:17:11] if you make believer if you're a
[2:17:13] hypocrite you'll be doing the
[2:17:14] persecuting
[2:17:15] of the real spiritual believer you'll do
[2:17:18] everything in your power
[2:17:19] to destroy the believer it's in your
[2:17:22] nature
[2:17:23] you can't help it
[2:17:26] that's what a meek believer will do
[2:17:28] that's what a hypocrite will do
[2:17:30] try to destroy you he'll come and try to
[2:17:33] discourage you
[2:17:36] he'll try to do things that stumble you
[2:17:40] amen remember in israel it was always
[2:17:44] that kind it meant always the kind of a
[2:17:46] spiritual side and then there was this
[2:17:48] natural side amen so a believer
[2:17:52] climbs high a make-believer can only go
[2:17:55] so far
[2:17:56] and his folly is made manifest
[2:18:00] lord help us how many beliefs we need to
[2:18:03] still be looking at our fruit see what
[2:18:04] kind of fruit we're bearing
[2:18:06] because it tells us who we are praise be
[2:18:10] to god
[2:18:12] i believe it was pharaoh right fellow
[2:18:15] pharaoh it says how does it say it i
[2:18:18] can't say it exactly but
[2:18:19] a saying to go and do as the israelites
[2:18:22] did going through the
[2:18:23] red sea how many nose was destroyed
[2:18:27] he thought hey they're spiritual they
[2:18:29] can go through these well i can too
[2:18:33] that was his mistake no that water was
[2:18:36] parted not for the
[2:18:37] egyptians it was parted for israel
[2:18:41] and when they thought they could do the
[2:18:43] same thing
[2:18:45] isn't that right that's where janice and
[2:18:47] jamboree's that's where their folly was
[2:18:49] made manifest when they begin to
[2:18:51] make snakes also and they're right sure
[2:18:54] they did
[2:18:55] but what happened to him there's got to
[2:18:57] eat no
[2:18:59] [Laughter]
[2:19:02] oh if pharaoh would have been smart
[2:19:05] right
[2:19:07] what should pharaoh have done after he's
[2:19:09] seen them other guys as snakes get eaten
[2:19:12] i'll tell you what he should have done
[2:19:13] he said yeah you're right moses
[2:19:16] you win i better let him go
[2:19:20] but he didn't did he and he cost him his
[2:19:23] army
[2:19:24] all washed away cost him all that
[2:19:27] because of that
[2:19:29] i mean it was the seven sons of sea but
[2:19:31] they also tried to follow somebody a
[2:19:33] real believer
[2:19:34] they seen paul cast out devils to do all
[2:19:36] these things and
[2:19:38] they come up into somebody's house they
[2:19:40] were going to kick out some devils
[2:19:42] i cast you out in the name of jesus
[2:19:44] christ whom paul preaches
[2:19:46] even use jesus name i believe
[2:19:49] whom paul preaches a second hand
[2:19:52] experience
[2:19:54] young people all of us a second hand
[2:19:56] experience isn't going to do you any
[2:19:58] good
[2:19:58] it's not going to work for you what
[2:20:00] happened to them they've got all tore up
[2:20:03] bloody bleeding stripped of their
[2:20:05] clothes them devils got out there and
[2:20:06] said hey you know what
[2:20:07] i need to go back to the altar and i
[2:20:09] need to get a personal experience with
[2:20:11] my god
[2:20:12] amen a personal anchor amen in an anchor
[2:20:16] or god comes into your heart he changes
[2:20:18] you and you're never the same again
[2:20:24] and then you go out and say the name of
[2:20:26] jesus christ
[2:20:27] not stop what somebody else says amen
[2:20:32] oh my how many believes we just need a
[2:20:34] closer walk
[2:20:36] we need to amen listen to that still
[2:20:38] small
[2:20:39] voice that's on the inside and have a
[2:20:41] personal relationship i
[2:20:43] truly believe this that god is looking
[2:20:45] for us to amen to have
[2:20:46] a daily i want to say this a daily
[2:20:50] revelation because there's nothing that
[2:20:53] will make you any stronger
[2:20:55] that'll give you more strength than when
[2:20:57] god is personally
[2:21:00] showing himself and revealing himself to
[2:21:02] you
[2:21:03] on a daily basis how many knows that
[2:21:06] when you go to looking for a wife or a
[2:21:08] husband
[2:21:09] it has to be something that got
[2:21:11] absolutely reveals to you and that you
[2:21:13] know
[2:21:13] that it's absolutely god yeah you want
[2:21:16] to know
[2:21:18] the same way with the church how many
[2:21:19] folks let me tell you something when you
[2:21:21] choose a church that you want to go to
[2:21:22] i believe it needs to be a revelation
[2:21:24] hey i believe that this church is of god
[2:21:26] this is where he wants me
[2:21:27] there's lots of churches that's of god
[2:21:29] and they're right but where
[2:21:31] does god want you that way you can sit
[2:21:33] there and you can know
[2:21:34] no matter what comes or what goes you
[2:21:37] are where you need to be
[2:21:39] amen and then there's nothing that can
[2:21:41] move you what is it it's
[2:21:42] not me telling you not your parents
[2:21:45] telling not somebody else pulling you
[2:21:46] but something that you know
[2:21:48] something that god tells you because i
[2:21:51] truly believe this morning
[2:21:53] this will be my final final comments and
[2:21:56] that is that god
[2:21:57] is wanting to have a deeper relationship
[2:21:59] with each and every one of us
[2:22:01] he wants to speak to us daily
[2:22:06] i believe he has a desire to have
[2:22:08] fellowship with every one of us
[2:22:10] but if we aren't careful we can't hear
[2:22:13] that still small
[2:22:16] voice folks i have learned
[2:22:19] that in searching for a message and so
[2:22:22] forth
[2:22:22] amen i'm not looking for a great
[2:22:24] thunderclap
[2:22:26] no but i find that what god gives me
[2:22:28] most of the time is during the week
[2:22:30] but i've been meditating meditating upon
[2:22:33] him
[2:22:33] amen it'll be that still small voice
[2:22:35] it's that little something that he
[2:22:37] touches you and tells you and shows you
[2:22:40] amen and then i pray about that and if
[2:22:42] god wants to speak me to speak on that
[2:22:44] amen he'll begin to pour it out and pour
[2:22:46] it out and pour it out
[2:22:47] not it just goes nowhere i've had many
[2:22:50] of them that was
[2:22:51] dead shut up but others where god begins
[2:22:53] to say yes that's what i want you to
[2:22:54] speak on
[2:22:55] amen but i have to learn to listen to
[2:22:58] that still small voice
[2:23:00] amen how many knows that how to get
[2:23:03] revelation
[2:23:04] revelation comes by getting in the
[2:23:05] spirit
[2:23:07] i believe that god we would hear god's
[2:23:09] voice to us in
[2:23:10] every this is real personal now in every
[2:23:12] one of our lives if we would
[2:23:14] be in the spirit more we would pray more
[2:23:17] like brother bob says you got to pray
[2:23:18] you got to read find it upon your bed
[2:23:21] post the bible says when you go to bed
[2:23:23] at night be listening to it when you get
[2:23:25] up in the morning and during the day
[2:23:26] wherever you are always have god on your
[2:23:28] mind
[2:23:29] all right and god in that time frame
[2:23:32] he'll speak to you he'll talk to you
[2:23:34] amen and you'll understand better and
[2:23:36] everything that you need to do
[2:23:39] and you'll need to you'll know how to do
[2:23:40] it a lot better amen
[2:23:42] because god will lead you and guide you
[2:23:45] with that still
[2:23:46] small voice and it'll give you anchor
[2:23:49] how many thankful for that anchor
[2:23:53] i said the last thing but think about
[2:23:55] moses afterwards
[2:23:57] how many knows when moses had that
[2:23:58] experience on the back side of the
[2:24:00] desert
[2:24:01] that right when he met that burning bush
[2:24:04] when he met god
[2:24:05] and brother-in-law says thomas byler
[2:24:08] does not have any right but the brad
[2:24:09] powell
[2:24:10] doesn't have any right behind this
[2:24:12] pulpit and left
[2:24:13] and met that god on the back side of the
[2:24:16] desert
[2:24:18] no not not literally
[2:24:21] all right because there's no desert
[2:24:22] around here but we all understand that
[2:24:25] somewhere in your life
[2:24:26] you come in contact with god amen and
[2:24:29] there isn't a man that convinces you
[2:24:31] different men can't talk you out of it
[2:24:34] they can't persuade you out of it they
[2:24:36] can't persecute you out of it
[2:24:38] you know that you met god and there
[2:24:40] isn't enough devils in hell
[2:24:42] that will ever shake you from that young
[2:24:46] people you need that more than anything
[2:24:47] in this world
[2:24:48] it's for god to have a you've got to
[2:24:50] come and give you an experience with him
[2:24:53] that it's going to be the rock upon that
[2:24:55] the whole church is built and it says
[2:24:58] the gates of hell
[2:24:59] all of hell will be against you but they
[2:25:02] will what
[2:25:04] not prevail against you without that
[2:25:08] revelation
