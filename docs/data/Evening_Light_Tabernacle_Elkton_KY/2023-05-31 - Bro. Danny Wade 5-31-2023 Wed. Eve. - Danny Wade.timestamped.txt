[59:46] [Music]
[1:00:26] so I just uh I just recently
[1:00:30] um heard this song and uh it really
[1:00:34] it really showed a lot with it and
[1:00:38] um it's all about when the devil just
[1:00:40] completely tries to make you feel so
[1:00:42] down about yourself and you start
[1:00:44] overthinking and you feel like nobody's
[1:00:48] there when truly his when God is there
[1:00:52] for you and
[1:00:54] um I uh I found a scripture before I
[1:00:57] started
[1:00:58] um before I got up here and I it's from
[1:01:01] Luke 15 18 to 24 and the 24th versus for
[1:01:06] my son was dead and is alive again he
[1:01:09] was lost and is found and they began to
[1:01:12] be married and it just shows just how
[1:01:15] merciful god truly is and this song kind
[1:01:19] of reminded me of that

[1:02:04] to let the lonely feeling wash away
[1:02:11] maybe there's a reason to believe you'll
[1:02:16] be okay cause when you don't feel strong

[1:08:28] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[1:08:31] Lord tonight
[1:08:33] hope everyone's doing all right
[1:08:35] I counted a
[1:08:37] in honor and privilege to be here
[1:08:39] tonight
[1:08:42] and tonight what I want to speak on is
[1:08:46] the Battle of surrender
[1:08:50] see because because
[1:08:52] um the world wants you to conform to it
[1:08:55] World once II
[1:08:58] to have our surrender the devil wants us
[1:09:00] to Bow before him a one
[1:09:02] once he has the the world and in the in
[1:09:07] his his grasp through everything and
[1:09:10] right now uh we we're seeing
[1:09:13] literal devil worship uh everywhere in
[1:09:18] in Brazil that remember when on the news
[1:09:21] we've seen how they were
[1:09:23] how that maybe it was on the news but I
[1:09:25] seen that that they were all worshiping
[1:09:28] the devil and they were they were
[1:09:30] blaspheming the name of Lord Jesus
[1:09:32] Christ they they had this whole devil
[1:09:36] festival and then the very next day they
[1:09:39] had the wrath of God come on them and
[1:09:41] they had a bunch of uh floods I believe
[1:09:43] in that and it was in that very next day
[1:09:47] but the devil wants us
[1:09:50] to surrender to him that's why he also
[1:09:52] asked Jesus he told Jesus I would give
[1:09:55] you all of this
[1:09:58] if you would just bow before me
[1:10:00] surrender to me
[1:10:02] because there's a battle going on in the
[1:10:05] spiritual realm of a battle of surrender
[1:10:09] because uh as the Lord wants us to
[1:10:12] surrender into him but the devil also
[1:10:15] wants our surrender
[1:10:18] and every time we choose the things of
[1:10:20] the world over God we're surrendering
[1:10:22] into the devil
[1:10:25] when we
[1:10:28] when we surrender to God when that's
[1:10:30] obedience to God's word when we obey
[1:10:32] God's word we focus on God we choose to
[1:10:35] do that instead of going out into the
[1:10:36] world instead of instead of looking to
[1:10:38] these other things that that the devil
[1:10:40] wants us to surrender to we surrender it
[1:10:43] to God
[1:10:45] powerful things can happen
[1:10:48] man let's turn to
[1:10:50] Romans 12 in and verse 1.
[1:10:58] Romans 12.
[1:11:08] it says I beseech you therefore Brethren
[1:11:12] by the mercies of God that ye present
[1:11:14] your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:11:19] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:11:21] reasonable service
[1:11:24] and and
[1:11:25] um I have another scripture to turn to
[1:11:27] turn to uh Rome's I mean excuse me
[1:11:32] Rome I don't know I said that but James
[1:11:36] for
[1:11:37] James 4 and
[1:11:40] we'll start with verse seven
[1:11:45] I don't know where I got Rome's from
[1:11:48] anyways
[1:11:50] I'm sounding like Joe Biden my therapist
[1:11:52] for a second anyways
[1:11:56] James 4 verse 7 submit yourselves
[1:11:59] therefore to God resist the devil and he
[1:12:02] will flee from you
[1:12:05] draw nigh to God and He will draw an eye
[1:12:08] to you clean cleanse your hands you
[1:12:12] Sinners and purify your hearts ye
[1:12:14] double-minded and go go to verse 10
[1:12:17] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[1:12:20] Lord and He Shall lift you up may God
[1:12:24] well actually let's pray
[1:12:26] let's pray
[1:12:29] Lord God
[1:12:31] we can't um humbly before you Lord
[1:12:35] with with with our hearts Wide Open Lord
[1:12:38] to surrender unto you to to surrender to
[1:12:40] your will Lord
[1:12:41] I I just pray tonight Lord that you come
[1:12:45] and take control of our hearts so let us
[1:12:46] not
[1:12:47] surrender to the things of the world let
[1:12:49] let us not conform to this world but but
[1:12:52] seek you to seek you to seek your will
[1:12:55] for our lives Lord to not be so caught
[1:12:57] up with the things of this world the
[1:12:59] things that are going on
[1:13:00] but but to focus on you above everything
[1:13:03] else to put you first Lord tonight I
[1:13:06] pray that you'll come in a powerful way
[1:13:07] tonight Lord
[1:13:08] and speak to a heart sword help us Lord

[1:13:12] our desire Lord that we may be closer to

[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:22] Lord help us to be as close as we can to
[1:13:25] that place we didn't know it and we
[1:13:27] can't exactly get to the place of
[1:13:28] perfection but Lord help us to grow
[1:13:30] closer to perfection closer to to
[1:13:33] becoming Your Perfect Bride your perfect
[1:13:35] spotless bride that you have called us

[1:13:51] little bit more tonight Lord

[1:13:56] might be of Our Lives Lord surrender
[1:13:58] everything to you Lord not just a part
[1:14:00] of our Lives not just the this part and
[1:14:02] this part and this part but everything
[1:14:04] Lord help us to surrender everything to
[1:14:06] you Lord tonight I pray in Jesus name
[1:14:08] amen
[1:14:11] amen surrendering excuse me you can be
[1:14:14] seated surrendering all is laying
[1:14:16] everything down at the feet of Jesus and
[1:14:19] committing everything to him it's giving
[1:14:23] up and letting him take control
[1:14:27] surrendering it to him is that is the
[1:14:29] best way to overcome anything regardless
[1:14:31] of what it is that we're going through
[1:14:33] if we're if we're going through
[1:14:35] different issues different problems in
[1:14:37] our lives and and we're worrying about
[1:14:40] it stressing over it and thinking how
[1:14:43] can I overcome this how can I I overcome
[1:14:45] it if we can just get to the place where
[1:14:48] we lay it before Christ and we say God
[1:14:51] I'm committing this to you I'm putting
[1:14:53] this at your feet I'm surrendering it to
[1:14:55] you now Lord
[1:14:57] and not not just the place where you say
[1:15:00] I surrender it and then you end the rest
[1:15:02] of the day you're thinking about and
[1:15:04] worrying about it and and being doubtful
[1:15:07] about it and thinking well maybe you
[1:15:09] might not maybe he might but if we get
[1:15:11] to the place where we're at peace and
[1:15:13] and we can just say God's in control I'm
[1:15:16] not going to worry about it I'm just
[1:15:18] gonna put in his hands he's going to
[1:15:21] take care of it he's going to come
[1:15:22] through
[1:15:24] because innocent that's the way we can
[1:15:27] tap into that spiritual sense of faith
[1:15:30] is surrendering to God
[1:15:37] you've got to surrender soul body you
[1:15:41] gotta surrender soul body Spirit
[1:15:44] strength everything you are to the will
[1:15:46] of God becoming a prisoner to him you're
[1:15:49] going to be somebody's prison and you
[1:15:51] don't belong to yourself you are are
[1:15:54] somebody's prisoner you're either a
[1:15:56] prisoner of the devil knowing this truth
[1:15:58] and won't surrender to it or a prisoner
[1:16:01] to the world and Sur and surrender
[1:16:04] surrender to God one or the other you're
[1:16:07] either the devil's prisoner to sin or
[1:16:10] Europe God's prisoner to righteousness
[1:16:11] you're one or the other
[1:16:16] amen and he says as uh here in um a
[1:16:21] super sense this is a good one
[1:16:23] but but that same sense God spoke when
[1:16:28] there was nothing what is that sense
[1:16:30] that super sense is God the faith of God
[1:16:33] in you the part of God
[1:16:35] that that comes unto you who
[1:16:39] gives you the super sense by that same
[1:16:42] super sense God frame the world together
[1:16:45] with things which was not and did not
[1:16:48] appear he spoke his word and believed
[1:16:51] his word and in a world shook into into
[1:16:55] existence
[1:16:57] The Sixth Sense the the super sense oh
[1:17:00] oh God pouring it out on me give it to
[1:17:03] me and everyone who needs it poor thy
[1:17:06] Sixth Sense and and to me Lord I am
[1:17:09] willing to surrender these five my own
[1:17:12] knowledge thoughts casting down all
[1:17:14] reasonings or let Thy word be true and
[1:17:17] every man's a lie every reasoning every
[1:17:21] doubt be Cast Away and let me walk in
[1:17:24] the super sense the sense of the Holy
[1:17:27] Spirit
[1:17:30] he says don't you want that that's the
[1:17:32] thing that we want God God bless you
[1:17:34] friends that's what you need that super
[1:17:37] sense will I will ask for something and
[1:17:41] it knows that he will give it it's
[1:17:43] persuaded for for he that cometh the God
[1:17:47] must believe that he is in a rewarder of
[1:17:50] those that diligently seek him if the
[1:17:53] sixth sense says God keeps his word I
[1:17:55] give myself to him I surrender all I got
[1:17:58] to
[1:17:59] I got to to him my my sense says that
[1:18:04] and this will bring it to pass my faith
[1:18:08] and God's word then then call anything
[1:18:11] else contrary to it as though it wasn't
[1:18:15] Abraham met God
[1:18:17] and God said you're going to have a baby
[1:18:19] by Sarah and him 20 75 not 25 and his
[1:18:25] and her 65 Abraham and called everything
[1:18:29] that wasn't
[1:18:31] that was contrary to that as though it
[1:18:34] wasn't he walked as if he seen God and
[1:18:37] he believed
[1:18:41] amen and this kind of Faith the Abraham
[1:18:45] surrendered his own doubts is it of
[1:18:49] course Abraham had doubts of course
[1:18:51] Abraham had had fears in thinking what
[1:18:54] and how can this be hey how how is it
[1:18:57] possible but he surrendered it to God he
[1:19:00] didn't he didn't and feed the aid that I
[1:19:03] think if that thing that those thoughts
[1:19:05] that went in his mind which we all have
[1:19:07] them he let them go away he said I don't
[1:19:09] care God said it that sells it I believe
[1:19:12] it I don't care what anybody else says I
[1:19:14] don't care what my own wife says I'm
[1:19:16] gonna believe it
[1:19:18] I'm going to trust that that God's gonna
[1:19:20] take care of it no matter what because I
[1:19:22] am surrendering it to God I'm saying
[1:19:24] surrendering it to him and I know that
[1:19:27] he's going to take care of it because
[1:19:28] why he said so and I'm gonna believe it
[1:19:32] Abraham a man who who waited patiently
[1:19:35] for the Fulfillment uh this is if he
[1:19:38] waited patiently for his son Isaac
[1:19:43] God told
[1:19:44] Abraham to sacrifice his only son
[1:19:49] Isaac
[1:19:51] his only son and he went up the mountain
[1:19:55] and and and and and and and I and uh his
[1:19:59] son asked him
[1:20:01] why are you taking me
[1:20:03] here where's the why are you taking me
[1:20:06] up here without a sacrifice and Abraham
[1:20:10] known that God what God had told him and
[1:20:12] had responded with
[1:20:15] God's going to provide the sacrifice
[1:20:18] I don't I don't care how absurd this
[1:20:21] sounds to everybody else I'm not even I
[1:20:23] didn't he didn't even tell his own wife
[1:20:24] he didn't tell his own wife because he
[1:20:26] knew what her reaction would be you're
[1:20:29] taking my only son to be sacrificed
[1:20:33] there's no way God told you to do that
[1:20:36] he wouldn't do that and we would all
[1:20:38] think the same thing if God ever told
[1:20:39] someone to do this in his life in these
[1:20:41] days especially
[1:20:43] God telling God promised you a son
[1:20:47] and God's going to take him up there and
[1:20:49] sacrifice your only son kill your own
[1:20:51] you're gonna kill your only son upon
[1:20:54] that mountain
[1:20:56] and he said I don't care God told me to
[1:20:58] do it I'm gonna go up there and do
[1:21:00] exactly what he said and I believe that
[1:21:02] that because he said he and he was going
[1:21:05] to uh he was going to to um give me a
[1:21:11] so many a um children by him
[1:21:16] so so many grandchildren grandchildren
[1:21:19] grandchildren and it had to be through
[1:21:21] him God's Gonna raise him back to life
[1:21:23] or he's going to do something and I'm
[1:21:25] going to trust him no matter what even
[1:21:27] when I don't understand it
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:30] even when I don't understand I'm going
[1:21:32] to trust in God I'm gonna I'm I'm gonna
[1:21:34] do exactly what he told me to do
[1:21:36] regardless of what anybody says about it
[1:21:39] I don't care what anybody else thinks
[1:21:42] how crazy it looks and and his own son
[1:21:47] knew to trust in his father he went with
[1:21:51] it he didn't try to run away
[1:21:53] he didn't try this essay hey oh but but
[1:21:56] let's go back let's go get a lamb just
[1:21:58] in case maybe he he was going to bring a
[1:22:02] lamb along with it and I was going to
[1:22:03] sacrifice no he trusted his father and
[1:22:07] Abraham trusted his heavenly father that
[1:22:10] everything was gonna uh work out for the
[1:22:13] good because God always comes through
[1:22:15] and even in this time he's going to come
[1:22:17] through
[1:22:21] amen he didn't have to worry he didn't
[1:22:23] have to he didn't have to
[1:22:25] he didn't have to
[1:22:28] think about about how and what is God
[1:22:32] gonna do this he didn't and try to
[1:22:34] explain it to himself he just trusted
[1:22:35] God completely because he was fully
[1:22:37] surrendered to God he fully surrendered
[1:22:40] his will not my will but your will be
[1:22:42] done
[1:22:43] I'm gonna do exactly what he and called
[1:22:45] me to do and and as they started
[1:22:48] climbing up this mountain
[1:22:49] and and and I can imagine him am scared
[1:22:53] both of them both of them scared for
[1:22:55] aired because they both knew that that
[1:22:57] they might not see each other again and
[1:23:00] because uh because he was going to do
[1:23:02] exactly what God told him to do he
[1:23:04] didn't he didn't care about his own
[1:23:07] thoughts his own feelings how he
[1:23:10] he felt about it he was he was going up
[1:23:13] there practically mourning in his own
[1:23:16] son because because he knew what was
[1:23:18] going to happen he knew what he had to
[1:23:19] do
[1:23:22] but he had to still keep going he had to
[1:23:24] push past those feelings
[1:23:26] because we can't rely on our own
[1:23:29] feelings and our flesh when we have to
[1:23:32] rely on on what where God is leading us
[1:23:35] not how our feelings are leading us
[1:23:37] because our feelings can go over the
[1:23:39] place and if he simply went by his
[1:23:41] feelings he would have not followed
[1:23:43] through with God what God had called him
[1:23:45] to do
[1:23:51] to the top of the mountain and and his
[1:23:54] son's looking at him and and he told him
[1:23:56] get get on upon that that rock he now
[1:23:59] that this will make you just bolted away
[1:24:01] ran away I'm not gonna do that I'm not
[1:24:03] gonna get on there we've gone too far
[1:24:06] where's the sacrifice at where is it I
[1:24:08] don't see any sacrifice
[1:24:12] but he he he I believe he just calmly
[1:24:14] went and my dad said to do this I'm
[1:24:16] going to follow through exactly what he
[1:24:18] said to do I'm gonna Trust
[1:24:20] question him I'm gonna trust in God God
[1:24:22] knows what he's doing
[1:24:24] I'm gonna get upon this altar I'm gonna
[1:24:27] sacrifice myself
[1:24:29] now I don't think that that Abraham had
[1:24:32] to tie him down
[1:24:34] does it say he had the time down I don't
[1:24:36] think it does because if if we we have I
[1:24:39] don't have this scripture I don't think
[1:24:41] he had to tie him down I don't remember
[1:24:43] remember reading once that he had to tie
[1:24:45] his own son down he gladly got up there
[1:24:48] upon upon that altar with all the wood
[1:24:51] and everything around it go up on that
[1:24:53] altar as his as sacrifice because he
[1:24:56] trusted it in in his father and and
[1:25:01] he's interested in his heavenly father
[1:25:03] as well because he knew that his father
[1:25:05] was following God's commands because he
[1:25:07] knew that that God had called his father
[1:25:10] or to be who he is and called him to go
[1:25:13] up there upon that rock to be a
[1:25:15] sacrifice and so he was sacrificing
[1:25:18] himself thinking I'm gonna I'm on this
[1:25:20] altar as a sacrifice to God
[1:25:23] I'm not up here because my father
[1:25:25] decided it it to be crazy one day
[1:25:29] he didn't and I think he didn't see his
[1:25:32] father as going insane because that's
[1:25:34] how everyone putty would have looked at
[1:25:36] it you're insane Abraham why are you
[1:25:38] doing this you seem like some kind of
[1:25:40] crazy hey
[1:25:43] mentally ill person you could have
[1:25:45] imagined anybody that would have knew
[1:25:47] about what he was doing people watching
[1:25:49] him go along without without a sacrifice
[1:25:51] what where's the sacrifice that Abraham
[1:25:53] God's Gonna provide it going up there in
[1:25:56] there God's Gonna provide the sacrifice
[1:25:59] and and he's up there he's uh he's on
[1:26:02] that altar he's saying taking within
[1:26:04] himself
[1:26:06] I'm I'm about to die but this is a
[1:26:08] worldly cause this is a sacrifice as he
[1:26:10] watched the knife go over him thinking
[1:26:12] and here it is that's it I'm a sacrifice
[1:26:15] to God I I'm sacrificing myself to God
[1:26:19] because that's what God told my father
[1:26:21] to do and I'm gonna trust him I'm gonna
[1:26:25] even though I'm gonna die right now he
[1:26:27] fell in his heart because it was way too
[1:26:30] close for him to question whether he was
[1:26:31] going to die or not with a knife over
[1:26:33] him
[1:26:34] and without him even being tied down
[1:26:37] you're even pulling that up brother
[1:26:39] piler you can't find it where it says he
[1:26:42] they didn't tie him down did he
[1:26:46] I see pictures of him uh on a book of
[1:26:50] him being tied down I don't think he was
[1:26:52] tied down though
[1:26:54] all right but but he offered himself
[1:26:58] because he see he could have still ran
[1:27:00] away I don't think he was they also show
[1:27:02] him on pictures of him being tied with
[1:27:04] his hands
[1:27:08] like this uh himself he was trusting
[1:27:14] yeah okay
[1:27:18] I I don't ever remember reading that he
[1:27:20] was tied up though I believe he he
[1:27:22] offered himself as that sacrifice as
[1:27:23] well because he trusted and and and just
[1:27:27] as he was about to to kill him just as
[1:27:30] he was about to sacrifice his son
[1:27:33] and then the angel of the Lord Eric came
[1:27:36] and spoke and said said don't kill your
[1:27:39] son I the Lord has provided a sacrifice
[1:27:46] amen but this was an example of what God
[1:27:49] was going to do
[1:27:52] thousands of years I believe and later
[1:27:54] that that Jesus Christ was going to die
[1:27:56] upon that cross but this time it was
[1:27:58] gonna he was gonna fall through with it
[1:27:59] completely and and the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:03] offered himself as a sacrifice for our
[1:28:06] sins upon that cross
[1:28:09] as a Living Sacrifice willingly and and
[1:28:12] and he he said he said and uh not my
[1:28:17] will Lord but yours be done not my way
[1:28:20] uh Lord God but yeah yours be done he
[1:28:24] surrendered himself before the almighty
[1:28:28] that was that was as God manifested In
[1:28:31] the Flesh but we we know that that
[1:28:34] according to what brother Branham said
[1:28:35] he was a tabernacle and and that flesh
[1:28:39] didn't want to die upon that cross that
[1:28:42] flesh didn't want to die upon the cross
[1:28:43] because he had to suffer
[1:28:45] he had he had to suffer so
[1:28:49] um so much on that cross as as the The
[1:28:52] Living Sacrifice as an example to it to
[1:28:55] us all that we we should pick up our
[1:28:58] crosses and follow him and surrender
[1:29:01] ourselves before him
[1:29:03] that we may be a Living Sacrifice before
[1:29:05] the Lord Jesus Christ that we might
[1:29:08] follow him and follow his way and his
[1:29:12] guidance just like that rich
[1:29:14] the Rich Young Ruler
[1:29:16] Jesus asked him to surrender everything
[1:29:20] get rid of everything sell everything
[1:29:23] you have and come unto me and pick up
[1:29:27] your cross and follow me
[1:29:30] and the burden was too hard to Bear he
[1:29:33] couldn't surrender himself even though
[1:29:34] the the Lord loved that Mandela and
[1:29:39] Jesus said yes love love that man and he
[1:29:43] loved his sincerity asking how can I
[1:29:46] enter into the Kingdom of Heaven because
[1:29:49] he knew he lacked something he knew
[1:29:51] there was something that was missing and
[1:29:53] that was that that sacrifice that
[1:29:56] commitment and and following Christ
[1:29:58] that's what what he was missing he he
[1:30:01] had to not just follow them with the all
[1:30:03] the Commandments and everything he had
[1:30:05] to become a Living Sacrifice and follow
[1:30:09] the lord Jesus Christ and take up his
[1:30:11] cross and follow him
[1:30:17] says this
[1:30:20] and didn't you ever see see a man that
[1:30:22] had been stricken by an evil spirit like
[1:30:25] that he is several times his strength
[1:30:27] this is what it means to surrender to an
[1:30:31] evil spirit
[1:30:33] several times his strength how I have
[1:30:36] noticed them in the meetings when groups
[1:30:39] of police couldn't even hold them they
[1:30:42] they would tear them and then police the
[1:30:44] pieces and throw them aside and and
[1:30:49] throw them inside and get in and get
[1:30:51] them out and and and and just create
[1:30:54] chaos and everything around around the
[1:30:56] entire building because they were had an
[1:30:59] evil spirit
[1:31:01] but brother Branham says how much more
[1:31:05] so we have if we surrender until Lord
[1:31:08] Jesus Christ how much more power we can
[1:31:11] get if we surrender unto God because
[1:31:14] because that is just that those are
[1:31:17] Fallen Angels how much more or can the
[1:31:20] power of God come on upon a person that
[1:31:24] is fully surrendered unto God how much
[1:31:26] more can they have how much more power
[1:31:30] that God will give us over them the evil
[1:31:32] spirits and that they have the
[1:31:34] Superhuman strength that can then
[1:31:36] probably lift this Pulpit out I remember
[1:31:40] um just to explain how heavy this Pulpit
[1:31:42] is remember when we moved in when there
[1:31:44] was a baptism it's so heavy you can't
[1:31:45] hardly lift it
[1:31:48] and and they could just lift it up
[1:31:51] probably over their head and toss it
[1:31:52] across the room like that so much power
[1:31:55] strength but we can and just say a few
[1:31:59] words
[1:32:00] and they have so much fear of the
[1:32:03] believer so much fear of of those that
[1:32:07] are surrendered unto God is so much fear
[1:32:09] of us that yet they are so powerful
[1:32:12] the the power of God is stronger than
[1:32:15] that every every single oh devil has to
[1:32:19] Bow before that a son or daughter of God
[1:32:23] they have to bow before us
[1:32:25] and they have to to surrender into us
[1:32:28] all of our our enemies will bow before
[1:32:31] us that that's
[1:32:34] my
[1:32:35] they have to they have to say
[1:32:37] surrendered to us is because those evil
[1:32:41] spirits how much more
[1:32:43] can the believer have when he surrenders
[1:32:45] unto God
[1:32:47] foreign
[1:32:55] surrendered to the evil one it took
[1:32:57] possession of him and he had not his own
[1:33:00] understanding he only did what the evil
[1:33:03] spirit put in him to do that's what
[1:33:05] what's fully surrendering to that evil
[1:33:07] spirit is doing that's what they they're
[1:33:10] they do and right now there's a lot of
[1:33:12] people in the insane asylum there's a
[1:33:14] lot of people out on the streets that
[1:33:15] are demon-possessed but they haven't
[1:33:18] fully surrendered to that because when
[1:33:20] they do that it takes over and it
[1:33:21] controls and they and and you you'll
[1:33:23] sometimes see that happen when you make
[1:33:25] one one of them angry you know they'll
[1:33:28] start to allow that that able Spirit to
[1:33:30] come upon them more and they'll they'll
[1:33:33] some sometimes attack you sometimes
[1:33:35] sometimes they'll they'll restrain
[1:33:38] themselves and just yell at you or
[1:33:40] scream out I've seen in videos of them
[1:33:43] just screaming on the streets they just
[1:33:45] screed super loud and and you seem
[1:33:48] loan to them well wouldn't they said
[1:33:51] when Donald Trump got in a bunch of them
[1:33:53] started screaming
[1:33:56] on the street started is crying out like
[1:33:58] crazy and said the the leftists and and
[1:34:01] all that that I won't go to too deep
[1:34:03] into that is evil spirits
[1:34:05] in them that's making them do that as
[1:34:07] evil spirits in in them that's making
[1:34:09] them them act the way they are they they
[1:34:12] call it Mental Illness but really it's
[1:34:14] just a demonic spirit that gets upon
[1:34:16] them
[1:34:19] now now he continues then then I thought
[1:34:22] with a complete surrender to the devil
[1:34:24] can give a man maybe five times his
[1:34:27] strength what would a complete surrender
[1:34:30] to God do to a man what would it do to
[1:34:33] it
[1:34:35] to a that's a weak and body and
[1:34:38] can't walk or something if we could just
[1:34:41] completely yield to the Holy Ghost give
[1:34:44] us super strength to rise in the in the
[1:34:47] name because greater is he that is in
[1:34:49] you than he that is in the world see you
[1:34:52] the strength of God that's in you is
[1:34:54] greater than any Affliction that can
[1:34:56] come upon you there is nothing can
[1:34:58] overtake take you you can suit it that
[1:35:02] can supersede you because you are full
[1:35:06] of super
[1:35:07] power and that superpowers the holy
[1:35:10] spirit that dominates your life if you
[1:35:12] are a Christian
[1:35:15] amen fully surrender if we can fully
[1:35:18] surrender into God on his power will
[1:35:20] come down in our lives like neg we've
[1:35:22] never seen before if we can fully
[1:35:24] surrender into into unto God
[1:35:29] and then and all only then can the power
[1:35:33] of God be manifest within us if we can
[1:35:35] surrender and yield ourselves unto God
[1:35:37] that that's what what a preacher is
[1:35:40] supposed to do when he gets up here to
[1:35:42] yield himself off to God to surrender
[1:35:45] himself to God that God might come down
[1:35:48] and speak through him
[1:35:50] and every demon every devil has to leave
[1:35:53] in Jesus name because there's no demon
[1:35:57] no darkness and and hell can't stand
[1:35:59] against it nothing in hell can stand
[1:36:02] against the the believer that's been
[1:36:04] surrendered unto God because God is
[1:36:07] living within that manifested in the in
[1:36:10] the flesh and the form of the Holy
[1:36:12] Spirit and it'll become begin to
[1:36:15] manifest in your life and your actions
[1:36:17] and the things that you're doing and if
[1:36:19] we can sometimes we get to the place
[1:36:21] where even us that are baptized with the
[1:36:25] Holy Ghost can get to a place where
[1:36:27] where where sometimes where we
[1:36:30] we get so full of ourselves where we're
[1:36:32] we're we're going on it and and we we
[1:36:35] begin to have a few things that aren't
[1:36:38] completely surrendered unto God a few
[1:36:40] things here a few things there and we
[1:36:42] begin to to get overcome with the the
[1:36:44] things going on the the in our lives the
[1:36:47] things that are happening
[1:36:49] that can get can just slowly creep in
[1:36:52] that the devil's always sneaky he always
[1:36:55] tries to If he if he can't if he can't
[1:36:57] get us to surrender her to him he's
[1:37:00] gonna get us to surrender to different
[1:37:02] things so that makes him innocent he'll
[1:37:05] try to he'll try to get our attention
[1:37:08] diverted because the devil is always
[1:37:10] roaring about like a like a roaring lion
[1:37:13] not or not a roaring lion he's not a
[1:37:15] wrong line he's just a bluff
[1:37:17] an acting like a roaring lion but really
[1:37:20] he's he's just a bluff he's not as big
[1:37:22] as a lion he's he's not a lion but he
[1:37:26] Roars like one he roams about roaring
[1:37:29] like a lion because he's angry and he's
[1:37:31] tired of of seeing us Believers acting
[1:37:35] upon what God has told us to do and and
[1:37:38] following in God's footsteps he's tired
[1:37:41] of seeing the power of God being
[1:37:43] manifested and the Believers because
[1:37:45] when when the power of God comes down
[1:37:48] and manifests
[1:37:49] himself within us if we surrender
[1:37:51] ourselves fully unto God that that power
[1:37:54] May flow through Satan sees everything
[1:37:56] we're doing and he wants to distract us
[1:37:58] he'll he'll smell he'll snap something
[1:38:00] in our lives you'll put something in our
[1:38:02] lives that'll distract us get our minds
[1:38:04] off of that
[1:38:06] he'll get our minds off of that and on
[1:38:09] to that thing that problem that pops up
[1:38:11] this part the devil's always trying to
[1:38:13] put sickness and illnesses whatever it
[1:38:15] is and he'll pop it up in our lives and
[1:38:17] and we and we'll be oh no how am I going
[1:38:19] to deal with this I don't know how how
[1:38:20] am I gonna do this but God cause us to
[1:38:23] surrender it to him
[1:38:25] God called us to surrender to him that
[1:38:27] he may use us because sometimes we we
[1:38:30] get up in our own selves and we we we
[1:38:33] get so so so much so particular in in
[1:38:36] our own ways in doing our own way and
[1:38:39] doing our own things that we forget to
[1:38:42] surrender to God surrender it to him
[1:38:45] that he made it come in a powerful way
[1:38:50] and heal us and bring us to the place
[1:38:52] where he wants us to be to his perfect
[1:38:54] will and use us in a powerful way that
[1:38:56] his power May flow through us
[1:39:00] and cast every every devil out and
[1:39:03] that's where where this first comes on
[1:39:06] it comes into to my play
[1:39:10] they shall cast out demons they they
[1:39:13] shall heal the sick they shall
[1:39:17] do all these things in my name but
[1:39:20] what's the first thing thing that God
[1:39:22] calls us to do surrender to him
[1:39:25] he wants us to take up our cross and
[1:39:28] follow him that's the only way these
[1:39:30] these things can come into manifest into
[1:39:32] our lives is if we can surrender those
[1:39:35] things to him
[1:39:39] and think things will still come up and
[1:39:42] things will still try to get your
[1:39:44] attention diver your attention the most
[1:39:46] distracting thing is this phone
[1:39:49] um the most or or your TV or or it could
[1:39:53] just be someone uh you know the times
[1:39:56] when when you're praying and a
[1:39:58] notification pops up and the phone
[1:39:59] starts ringing and because the devil
[1:40:02] don't like it when you get on your knees
[1:40:04] and pray the devil don't like it when
[1:40:06] you're when you're on your knees
[1:40:07] surrendering everything to God the devil
[1:40:10] don't like it
[1:40:11] so we're gonna do it more
[1:40:14] amen and we get we gotta keep that devil
[1:40:18] full angry as long as the devil's angry
[1:40:20] at us and throwing everything and we
[1:40:21] resist the devil we we he will flee you
[1:40:25] say I rebuke that devil in Jesus name
[1:40:27] I'm going to keep on focusing on God I'm
[1:40:29] going to keep on surrendering to God I
[1:40:31] don't care what's popping up I don't
[1:40:32] care what's going on I'm just going to
[1:40:35] surrender it to God and you'll get that
[1:40:38] that peace that passes understanding
[1:40:42] and and you'll have have the power of
[1:40:44] God moving in your life if you are
[1:40:46] surrendered unto God
[1:40:53] amen if we could fully surrender
[1:40:55] ourselves to God he can he could use us
[1:40:58] in a in powerful ways but we get so into
[1:41:01] our own way of doing things that we
[1:41:03] forget to go to God for guidance we
[1:41:06] forget to surrender to God and sometimes
[1:41:08] we we go to God and say hey we surrender
[1:41:11] but we don't fully mean it because we
[1:41:13] worry and we think about it and so much
[1:41:16] instead of just committing it to God and
[1:41:18] trusting in Him
[1:41:20] and man I don't I don't think there's
[1:41:22] one of us that's not guilty of that
[1:41:25] we're all guilty of that we we say God I
[1:41:28] surrender to you
[1:41:30] well maybe it's not supposed to work out
[1:41:32] the way I thought it was gonna
[1:41:34] maybe it was it's going to be a little
[1:41:37] bit different than than I thought it was
[1:41:40] going to be I don't I don't know I don't
[1:41:43] know it's what can I do to to to make
[1:41:46] this different what can I do and where
[1:41:48] and where we're out here trying to
[1:41:50] trying to do God's work trying to try
[1:41:52] trying to to stop it from whatever it is
[1:41:57] we always try and try our very best
[1:42:00] to to be in control of everything and
[1:42:04] when we get to the place where we don't
[1:42:06] surrender it to God and commit it to him
[1:42:08] and we we go around uh running around
[1:42:11] and trying to trying to work everything
[1:42:13] out ourselves and trying to fix that and
[1:42:14] trying to fix that and and then and then
[1:42:18] and um
[1:42:20] and God just tells us to
[1:42:22] Just Surrender it to me I'll take care
[1:42:24] of it
[1:42:26] just just commit it to me
[1:42:29] those things that we're not in control
[1:42:31] of
[1:42:33] God wants us to surrender it to him
[1:42:35] because we can't control everything
[1:42:37] we're human beings we try to control
[1:42:39] everything we try to say
[1:42:42] I want to do it this way I want to do it
[1:42:44] that way
[1:42:47] and and then we forget to go to God and
[1:42:49] surrender it to him and say God I commit
[1:42:52] this to you uh I'm not going to worry
[1:42:54] about God help me not to worry about
[1:42:55] because we're human beings we worry
[1:42:57] about things
[1:42:58] help me to surrender it to you
[1:43:06] if we could just surrender it to him
[1:43:09] tonight surrender everything he'll do it
[1:43:11] all for you maybe maybe not when or how
[1:43:14] we imagined or or wanted it but uh but
[1:43:17] we'll see breakthroughs we didn't even
[1:43:19] know could happen we'll see healings
[1:43:21] that we were told that were impossible
[1:43:23] we'll see chains break that we thought
[1:43:25] couldn't be broken
[1:43:27] if we could just surrender again let God
[1:43:31] take control of it surrender to God it's
[1:43:33] it's we can't just say I surrendered to
[1:43:36] God and and and and not say that's end
[1:43:39] of story We it's a daily thing surrender
[1:43:42] to God every single day crucify the
[1:43:44] flesh commit it to God and say God I
[1:43:46] surrender to you every single day it's
[1:43:49] not just one day I surrender all to you
[1:43:50] and the next day and everything's good
[1:43:52] the next day everything's good every
[1:43:55] single day it takes surrender
[1:43:57] we have to surrender every single day if
[1:43:59] we don't we're gonna be all over the
[1:44:01] place our day is gonna
[1:44:03] be so bad and it's gonna go downhill and
[1:44:05] things are not gonna work out the way we
[1:44:07] want it to and things are and things
[1:44:09] will crash down in our faces and when
[1:44:13] we're trying to go about and try to fix
[1:44:14] it ourselves and try to do it ourselves
[1:44:17] When God Says stand still and know that
[1:44:20] I am God I will make it happen
[1:44:24] laughs
[1:44:25] now Moses standing before the burning
[1:44:28] bush encountered the very presence of
[1:44:30] God he heard the voice of the Lord
[1:44:32] commanding him to to go to pharaoh and
[1:44:34] deliver the Israelites from their
[1:44:36] bondage from Moses and his humanness was
[1:44:39] filled with doubts and spheres he
[1:44:41] questioned his own abilities and
[1:44:42] hesitated to embrace the Monumental task
[1:44:44] before him yet in that moment of
[1:44:47] uncertainty Moses made a decision that
[1:44:51] changed the course of history he showed
[1:44:53] surrender over cell phone Reliance he
[1:44:56] surrendered his doubts his insecurities
[1:44:58] his limitations and to the
[1:45:00] all-sufficient god Moses understood that
[1:45:02] surrendering to God's will meant
[1:45:04] acknowledging his own insufficiency
[1:45:08] and embracing the power and authority of
[1:45:11] the Almighty I mean we don't uh we don't
[1:45:16] always admit to our own insufficiency we
[1:45:20] don't admit to God I'm not able to do it
[1:45:22] we don't like admitting to that because
[1:45:24] it is us as human and things we we like
[1:45:29] to think we can do it all we like to
[1:45:31] think well I can make this happen I I
[1:45:33] I'm I'm confident in myself I can do it
[1:45:37] I can make this as happen
[1:45:39] when in reality we can't and the only
[1:45:43] way we can surrender to God is we can
[1:45:45] say God I can't do this God I can't do
[1:45:48] this by myself I need your help I need
[1:45:51] yeah you to do it for Me Lord
[1:45:54] it's not I'm not saying that that we
[1:45:58] don't do any work out of course no it's
[1:46:00] not we we uh God uses us as human beings
[1:46:02] to do his work for him but but I'm
[1:46:05] talking about those things that we can't
[1:46:06] control those things that we think maybe
[1:46:09] we can James this and we're trying our
[1:46:11] best maybe we can change it maybe we can
[1:46:14] fix this
[1:46:17] but in in reality if you're continuously
[1:46:20] thinking I yes I can fix it I can fix I
[1:46:22] can fix it instead of looking at God you
[1:46:25] can fix it lord I can't I I and
[1:46:27] sometimes we'll get to the place where
[1:46:29] where we're trying so hard trying so
[1:46:32] hard in our own abilities that that we
[1:46:36] realize we've failed and and then we go
[1:46:39] to God and say say hey God I I couldn't
[1:46:42] do it can you turn this hole around
[1:46:44] because I just made a whole mess of
[1:46:46] everything God I Surrender it to you I
[1:46:49] give it all to you because I can't do it
[1:46:53] surrender is committing everything to
[1:46:56] God and and in your ability in your
[1:46:58] flesh it's denying yourself saying
[1:47:01] that's that that's it right there
[1:47:03] denying yourself because you have to
[1:47:06] deny yourself in order to surrender to
[1:47:10] God
[1:47:11] say say this flesh is not able to do it
[1:47:14] I am not able to do it no one else is
[1:47:17] able to do it
[1:47:19] the doctor said I can't do it I can't
[1:47:22] get better the doctor said it's not it's
[1:47:25] not possible
[1:47:29] but uh instead if we that's the thing we
[1:47:32] we say well the doctor said the doctor
[1:47:34] said this doctor said that but but if
[1:47:37] the doctor is not able to do it
[1:47:39] sometimes we have to have his head to
[1:47:41] where to where the doctor said and
[1:47:43] you're that's it end of story that's it
[1:47:47] this end it's about to be the end of
[1:47:49] your story and then we say say now I
[1:47:51] know the doctor can't do it
[1:47:54] now I know it's not not possible uh
[1:47:57] during other times we just string along
[1:47:59] it's uh well the doctor said this it's
[1:48:01] gonna get better sometime it's gonna get
[1:48:03] better
[1:48:04] then then you're having some faith in
[1:48:06] the doctors
[1:48:08] but but it's when the doctor says we
[1:48:11] can't
[1:48:12] and then you walk away and you get to
[1:48:14] you're thinking to yourself
[1:48:15] I can't do it the doctor can't do it
[1:48:19] it's when you look at and say you can't
[1:48:22] when you can't when I can't when the
[1:48:24] doctor can't
[1:48:27] it's when it's when you take away the
[1:48:32] the cross
[1:48:34] when you take that cross and you carry
[1:48:37] it away from the can't and you turn it
[1:48:40] into a can because with that cross
[1:48:44] you can but it takes it taking that
[1:48:48] cross away from that can't
[1:48:50] taking it away and that you can when
[1:48:53] you're carrying your cross and you say I
[1:48:55] can't the doctor can't they can't when
[1:48:58] you're singing on you're hoping that the
[1:49:00] doctor can that's that that is an
[1:49:03] example of Faith you're praying and God
[1:49:05] I hope it happens quicker God I hope it
[1:49:08] everything continues the way that you
[1:49:10] said it was gonna and that the doctor
[1:49:12] said it was going to happen but when the
[1:49:14] doctor says you can't that's when a real
[1:49:16] faith kicks in when they're real for
[1:49:18] when when you're that spiritual sense of
[1:49:21] faith has to kick in because there's no
[1:49:23] other option when when there's no other
[1:49:25] option that that's when desperation
[1:49:27] comes into play when desperation comes
[1:49:30] into play and then it has to be it has
[1:49:33] to be that God's power has to come down
[1:49:35] and and heal you and that's when God uh
[1:49:38] has to make a move that's when he he
[1:49:40] does when you know that God has to do it
[1:49:42] or things ain't gonna change or thing
[1:49:45] because the doctor has no hope left for
[1:49:47] you
[1:49:48] because if there's hope outside of
[1:49:50] Christ then you're not hoping in God
[1:49:52] you're hoping in the doctor you're
[1:49:53] hoping in somewhere else it's when the
[1:49:56] hope
[1:49:58] crumbles down and there's no longer a
[1:50:00] hope of anything else and all you can do
[1:50:02] is look to God that's when he'll
[1:50:05] come down and move when you have to
[1:50:08] surrender to God surrendering is denying
[1:50:11] yourself is denying
[1:50:20] I don't know where that came from that
[1:50:22] was just God speaking through me right
[1:50:24] there because I I didn't think of that
[1:50:25] on my own
[1:50:29] surrendering to God means letting go of
[1:50:32] our own agendas our own desires and our
[1:50:35] own understanding it means placing our
[1:50:37] trust fully in the one who knows the
[1:50:41] beginning from the end the one who
[1:50:44] who holds the universe in his hands when
[1:50:46] we surrender
[1:50:48] we exchange our weakness we exchange our
[1:50:51] weakness we say we're not strong enough
[1:50:53] we say we can't do it we're not able
[1:50:56] God take control for his strength
[1:51:01] and we surrender our doubts
[1:51:04] and we surrender all these things in
[1:51:08] exchange for his faithfulness
[1:51:10] and we surrender our fears for for his
[1:51:14] perfect love the only and the only time
[1:51:16] we aim God can can move is when we
[1:51:18] surrender those things surrender our
[1:51:20] fears surrender our doubts say because
[1:51:23] faith cannot work in doubt
[1:51:28] foreign
[1:51:29] Moses surrendered his past his
[1:51:32] insecurities and his comfort in in order
[1:51:35] to step into the calling of God what
[1:51:37] happened next God displayed his mighty
[1:51:40] power through the plagues the party of
[1:51:42] the Red Sea and the miraculous provision
[1:51:44] in the wilderness Moses became a vessel
[1:51:48] of God's
[1:51:49] because he surrendered himself
[1:51:51] completely to the place and purposes of
[1:51:54] God he surrendered to God he even though
[1:51:58] at the time he was doubtful he was
[1:52:00] saying God I can't speak God I can't
[1:52:02] stand speak very good I I'm not the
[1:52:04] eloquent speech and I can't do this by
[1:52:08] myself
[1:52:09] I can't do what you have told me to do
[1:52:12] but here's the thing when it comes to
[1:52:15] that confidence
[1:52:19] is is
[1:52:23] called you to do it I told you to do
[1:52:26] this
[1:52:28] but uh but uh when we're walking outside
[1:52:30] of God's will
[1:52:32] when we're walking outside of God's Will
[1:52:34] and we try to do things
[1:52:36] how and we have confidence in ourself
[1:52:39] instead of him that's when things can go
[1:52:41] down and downhill and and not in the
[1:52:45] right way that that God wants it to be
[1:52:47] because God tells us to do something
[1:52:49] differently and we're we're trying to go
[1:52:50] our own way and say I can do it I can do
[1:52:52] it I can do it
[1:52:54] when it's not what God told us to do but
[1:52:55] when God tells us to do it then we can
[1:52:57] have faith and know that we can do it we
[1:53:00] are able to do it because God has told
[1:53:03] us to do he's called us to do it
[1:53:08] today God is calling us to surrender
[1:53:12] he is calling us to lay down our burdens
[1:53:15] are lay down our burdens our worries and
[1:53:18] Ambitions our Ambitions at the foot of
[1:53:20] the cross he is calling us
[1:53:23] to her and to relinquish control and
[1:53:26] allow him to guide our steps in in our
[1:53:29] surrender God will make a way where
[1:53:32] there seems to be no way
[1:53:34] he will lead us through the Wilderness
[1:53:36] and into the promised land of His
[1:53:39] blessings
[1:53:42] Galatians 2 and verse 20 says I am
[1:53:47] crucified with Christ
[1:53:50] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[1:53:54] liveth in me and the life which I now
[1:53:58] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[1:54:02] God of the Son of God who loved me and
[1:54:05] gave himself for me amen God calls us to
[1:54:08] die to ourselves to surrender who we are
[1:54:11] to take up the cross take up our cross
[1:54:15] and follow him as a Living Sacrifice
[1:54:18] surrender to our ways surrender to our
[1:54:21] ideas surrender to what we think we can
[1:54:23] do and what we and what our ability is
[1:54:26] to do and and surrendering our uh not
[1:54:30] just that but surrendering
[1:54:33] our faith in the doctors the answer and
[1:54:35] surrounding that and putting that faith
[1:54:37] in God and knowing that God is going to
[1:54:39] make a way through this not the doctor
[1:54:41] not anybody else because when we're
[1:54:43] having when we have
[1:54:45] Faith somewhere else in somebody else
[1:54:47] we're not having faith in God and we're
[1:54:49] relying on something else
[1:54:50] [Music]
[1:54:51] but when we have faith in God when we
[1:54:53] when we they surrender everything to God
[1:54:56] surrender it whatever it is to God
[1:55:03] he'll he'll come and he'll take control
[1:55:06] of it and he and he'll
[1:55:08] when we when we rely on him sometimes
[1:55:12] when we have no choice but to rely on
[1:55:14] him
[1:55:15] and that's when when he'll move not
[1:55:18] other times
[1:55:19] when we think we can and control it
[1:55:23] now to to be able to say not my will
[1:55:28] Lord
[1:55:28] but yours
[1:55:30] sacrificing who we are there to be it to
[1:55:35] be what he wants us to be
[1:55:37] and so hard sometimes to say God you
[1:55:39] take control of the situation you take
[1:55:41] control of what I'm going through I
[1:55:42] commit it to you
[1:55:44] why why because we must let go of our
[1:55:48] worries and doubts and take on faith the
[1:55:51] only way we can take on faith is by
[1:55:53] letting go of worries in doubt
[1:55:56] take on faith and trusting in God that
[1:56:00] it's in his hands now
[1:56:06] let's see I don't got to how much time
[1:56:09] do I got what
[1:56:11] excuse me
[1:56:13] let's say r820 I
[1:56:15] time time sure flies when when you're
[1:56:20] yeah when you're having a good time
[1:56:24] Joe
[1:56:26] now we all know the story of Job
[1:56:29] what he went through there and and
[1:56:32] everything that the suffering that that
[1:56:35] God put him through it allowed him to go
[1:56:37] through
[1:56:40] excuse me allowed him to go and go
[1:56:43] through everything that that he had had
[1:56:46] dealt with he could he could have just
[1:56:48] gave it all up and committed suicide or
[1:56:51] or whatever he could have just said that
[1:56:53] I've had enough of this
[1:56:55] uh why is God punishing me all the
[1:56:58] religious leaders gather around him
[1:56:59] saying look at you what have you done
[1:57:01] wrong to deserve this you're going
[1:57:03] You're
[1:57:05] Going Through Hell so to speak
[1:57:08] why is God punishing you like this
[1:57:11] there must be some reason there must be
[1:57:13] something and we would have thought the
[1:57:15] same same thing if if there was a joke
[1:57:18] in this day God tuck your family God
[1:57:21] took your wife well now your wife
[1:57:23] everything but your wife the god Tucker
[1:57:25] in your house God tuck your your
[1:57:30] the things you own God took all your
[1:57:34] animals everything why don't you just
[1:57:37] Curse God and die
[1:57:39] that's what that's why I told him
[1:57:43] but he's in but he instead of doing that
[1:57:45] he said he he said I'll speak is like a
[1:57:48] foolish woman
[1:57:51] and and and he said said the Lord gives
[1:57:54] and the Lord takes away blessed be the
[1:57:57] name of the Lord he surrendered to God
[1:57:59] regardless of what was happening he
[1:58:00] surrendered to God he said said I don't
[1:58:02] care if if all hell's against me I don't
[1:58:06] care if if everything thing is crashing
[1:58:08] down in my eye life and I I and God took
[1:58:11] his health god well allowed the devil to
[1:58:14] do all this to him
[1:58:16] because God God doesn't put that on upon
[1:58:18] his believer says the devil he allows
[1:58:21] that to happen to us
[1:58:23] right it's the devil that that that does
[1:58:25] that to us because Brandon said that
[1:58:29] God cannot or will not rather
[1:58:34] or inflict sickness illness upon on his
[1:58:37] people he will not inflict us with and
[1:58:40] we say why God why you letting me suffer
[1:58:42] the through this he's allowing
[1:58:45] us to to go through that he's allowing
[1:58:47] those things to come upon us but he's
[1:58:48] not inflicting upon us he's not putting
[1:58:51] upon us that's what brother Branham said
[1:58:54] but but job was suffering so much so
[1:58:57] much sober so badly and yet
[1:59:01] he he surrendered it to God he said I
[1:59:04] don't care what happens now I don't care
[1:59:06] what I have nothing to lose he had
[1:59:09] nothing to lose
[1:59:10] but he he trusted and God he he
[1:59:13] surrendered to God and God gave him
[1:59:15] everything back because he surrendered
[1:59:17] it to God because he said and regardless
[1:59:20] of the situation regardless of what's
[1:59:22] going on regardless of what God is
[1:59:24] allowing me to go through I'm going to
[1:59:26] trust in God and I'm not going to allow
[1:59:28] my wife to talk me out of out of my
[1:59:31] faith in my in my father I'm not gonna
[1:59:35] let anything talk me out of this because
[1:59:37] God
[1:59:38] is in control I trust that God is in
[1:59:41] control and I don't know what I've done
[1:59:43] wrong but I'm not gonna going to uh I'm
[1:59:47] not going to give up I'm uh because God
[1:59:50] gave me all that it gave me everything
[1:59:52] he gave me my health it gave me it gave
[1:59:55] me my my house it gave me my family it
[1:59:57] gave me my children
[1:59:59] he can take it away if he wants to and
[2:00:01] I'm not gonna do anything about that I'm
[2:00:03] just gonna surrender my life to him
[2:00:06] regardless of what happened
[2:00:12] ourselves dead and alive to Christ but
[2:00:15] when he made the way that when we allow
[2:00:18] we we could sacrifice ourselves to to
[2:00:20] his service to follow him if we followed
[2:00:23] him
[2:00:25] we lead the life that that he lived
[2:00:28] that's wonderful
[2:00:32] amen and I won't be too much longer in
[2:00:35] in Luke 9 and verse 23
[2:00:38] it says
[2:00:39] um
[2:00:40] and he said to them if any man will come
[2:00:43] after me let him deny himself and take
[2:00:46] up his cross daily and follow me for
[2:00:49] whosoever will save his life
[2:00:51] will lose it but whosoever will lose his
[2:00:54] life for my sake the same shall save it
[2:00:57] for what is a man Advantage if he gained
[2:01:00] the whole world and lose himself and be
[2:01:03] Cast Away Lucy's own in other words lose
[2:01:06] his own soul and and be Cast Away into
[2:01:09] hell what would it matter if you become
[2:01:12] president you become all these things
[2:01:16] if you just lose it all
[2:01:18] if you and be cast into into hell now
[2:01:25] it says here brother Brandon said come
[2:01:28] follow me take up your cross deny
[2:01:30] yourself come after me I'll break the
[2:01:32] chains
[2:01:33] I'll break the ranks of the enemy uh
[2:01:36] break the ranks of sin I'll break the
[2:01:38] ranks of sickness and and you follow me
[2:01:41] and fight as the best you can for I'll
[2:01:44] make a hole through it and your homes
[2:01:47] will be preserved
[2:01:49] unto eternal life
[2:01:51] amen please stand if you will musicians
[2:01:53] if you'll come
[2:01:57] amen God says if we want to follow him
[2:01:59] we must deny ourselves
[2:02:02] deny means to refuse
[2:02:05] to refuse to give or Grant
[2:02:08] or in other words in this context refuse
[2:02:12] to to allow our flesh to have control of
[2:02:15] our life and refuse the choice of
[2:02:19] following our flesh following what what
[2:02:22] this flesh wants and commit it to him we
[2:02:26] we must refuse the desires of this flesh
[2:02:28] every day surrender to to Jesus give him
[2:02:31] all of our attention and seek Him above
[2:02:34] everything else give him everything we
[2:02:37] are
[2:02:38] and where and will be till we get to the
[2:02:41] place where we can say
[2:02:43] I am his and his alone I I don't want
[2:02:48] any part of this world all I want to do
[2:02:51] is serve him the old man is dead I am a
[2:02:54] new creation in Christ
[2:02:57] when we can say I am his and his alone
[2:02:59] not none of these things in this world
[2:03:01] can dead take that away from me none
[2:03:04] nothing in the world
[2:03:07] will I surrender to but him nothing in
[2:03:11] this world I am I only belong to him I
[2:03:13] am and I don't follow the things in my
[2:03:16] flesh I am crucified daily following him
[2:03:18] on a closer walk with him every single
[2:03:21] day and I don't care what anybody else
[2:03:23] says I don't care what pops up I don't
[2:03:25] care what no phone calls also happen and
[2:03:28] and things while I'm praying I don't
[2:03:30] care what things come up just forget it
[2:03:33] put that phone on silent and go back to
[2:03:35] praying forget it and and surrender
[2:03:38] everything to him surrender your time
[2:03:40] that's one thing that that is the
[2:03:41] hardest one of the hardest things to do
[2:03:43] as a Believer is surrendering your time
[2:03:46] because you're as when you're
[2:03:47] surrendering your time you're
[2:03:48] surrendering your life people will say I
[2:03:52] would die for Christ but would you live
[2:03:54] for him
[2:03:56] would you live for him and what does
[2:03:58] that mean and to live for him it means
[2:04:01] everything a thing you do is for him
[2:04:04] everything you are is for him
[2:04:08] amen if you would sing uh I surrender
[2:04:11] all Softly
[2:04:15] because that's what it takes in this
[2:04:18] world it takes surrendering everything
[2:04:20] into to him it takes committing
[2:04:24] everything to you to him
[2:04:27] [Music]
[2:04:28] because the Lord Jesus Christ wants our
[2:04:32] surrender he surrendered himself upon
[2:04:34] the cross
[2:04:39] to Die For Us on that cross for an
[2:04:42] example that we may take up our cross to
[2:04:44] follow him
[2:04:45] [Music]
[2:04:47] every headband
[2:04:51] does anyone here tonight that has things
[2:04:54] unsurrendered while you left your hands
[2:04:57] to him tonight
[2:04:59] uh surrendered all to him surrendered
[2:05:05] to surrender there are those things that
[2:05:07] come up in our in our lives and things
[2:05:10] that are trying to detect us from
[2:05:13] being
[2:05:16] to surrender
[2:05:18] everything to him because
[2:05:22] [Music]
[2:05:23] there's things
[2:05:33] the surrender of our time
[2:05:35] [Music]
[2:05:40] a hard time in him our time and effort
[2:05:43] is surrender to the devil oh
[2:05:47] dude
[2:05:50] [Applause]
[2:05:52] us to give our everything to him
[2:05:55] there's a story that says
[2:06:06] you'll understand when I say this is
[2:06:08] chicken in this this pig that asked and
[2:06:13] all that this chicken said hey let's
[2:06:15] let's go in
[2:06:17] and give
[2:06:18] and then well there's a this shop that
[2:06:20] says eggs and and ham and eggs and bacon
[2:06:24] and desperately wanted
[2:06:26] and
[2:06:29] and the chicken said why don't we give
[2:06:32] this to the demand let's give this a
[2:06:34] demand and then the pig said you're
[2:06:37] crazy I have to give up everything that
[2:06:39] I am
[2:06:41] I have to to give up myself you might be
[2:06:43] laughing at that but but but
[2:06:47] that the chicken and it has only has to
[2:06:51] lay eggs
[2:06:52] for them but the the what we don't want
[2:06:55] to do is we don't want to give ourselves
[2:06:57] completely we want to say this egg here
[2:06:59] this egg here like that that chicken
[2:07:01] this egg here
[2:07:03] when God uh desires there's to have a
[2:07:08] bacon pork every
[2:07:10] everything but God's desires are
[2:07:14] surrendered not just a little here not
[2:07:15] just a little there but God wants us to
[2:07:18] fully surrender to it to him not just a
[2:07:21] part of our life not a little bit not
[2:07:23] just
[2:07:24] that's what we're we so willingly want
[2:07:27] to do is to give it a little here little
[2:07:29] there but but when it comes to
[2:07:31] surrendering our whole selves as a
[2:07:33] Living Sacrifice into him nothing left
[2:07:36] in me nothing of me left to him
[2:07:40] to give him
[2:07:43] if we can just surrender everything to
[2:07:45] him not that there's nothing left of us
[2:07:47] in our flesh but only Christ that people
[2:07:51] might see Christ in US
