lord we're glad that it all turned out for the good praise god so amen all right so all right well back to the spare tire huh amen after that preaching i thought well my gracious that was awfully good wasn't it amen i'm very thankful that brother luke really put his all in it and the lord really used him to speak to our hearts amen and so if you will i'll just want to speak a little while on something i feel like the lord's laid on my heart amen and donna in case you're wondering what the title is going to be it's the two kingdoms the two kingdoms god's kingdom and satan's kingdom amen that there's only two how many believe there's only two kingdoms amen and you're either one in part of the one or you're part of the other only two kingdoms two powers in the world that is covering us amen so let's bow our heads before we read his word we come before you lord jesus once again thank the lord jesus that father even though the really wonderful time that we got to spend with everybody lord jesus it's over with father we know that lord jesus we have you and father we still have the peace that joy and we never have to leave that because you said you would never leave us nor forsake us and we're so grateful lord jesus that we can go from here and say lord what will you have us to do next lord jesus just continue to lead us guide us lord by your spirit father we're so grateful lord jesus to go through this dark valley and this dark world to know that we have one that's lighting and delighting the way lord jesus giving us a light father to know how to walk and where to walk lord we just want to take this little thought i feel you've laid upon my heart to speak on tonight speak to the people may you bless your word tonight anoint us lord to minister now in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen so i got to thinking of thinking about carnality and spirituality amen you can also call it natural naturality and spirituality everything that's natural everything that we see everything that's around us versus that which we cannot see amen and we know that everything that we can't see amen is spiritual that everything that we do see is only temporal and passes away and that right you can be seated well wait a minute i haven't read the scriptures yet see what i told you all right let's go to uh genesis i think we'll start back in genesis amen genesis the fourth chapter genesis 4. and of course this is the the scene opens up this evening after fall after cain had brought a offering to god and abel had brought an offering to god and abel's was accepted and came that's the cain and abel and keynes was not accepted amen and so he was driven of course from the presence of the lord in verse 16 of chapter four that god set a mark upon cain in verse 16 cain went out from the presence of god and dwelt in the land of nod and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear enoch and he built a day city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch and then we go on down to verse 21 because it's talked about a lot about the lineage and his brother's name was jubal and he was the father of all such as handled the harp and the organ and sila she also bear tubal kane an instructor of every artifice artificial in brass and iron the sister of tubal kane was haman amen and then verse 25 it says and adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord amen may god had his blessings to reading in words you can be seated amen we know that everything that began began in genesis amen and we know that cain according to i think it's first john 3 12 somewhere in there it talks about that not a murderer like cain who was of the wicked one right so we know that cain was of the wicked one so the lineage of satan's children of course is cain amen and so we see that that line descendants of cain coming up amen in the kingdom of satan actually beginning here amen and also it talks about how that the children of cain and how that they begin whenever they started out and their descendants how did they build cities you know right they built cities amen and uh also were inventors and instructors and inventors i think probably god said they were professionals they were scientific they were science people of science and so forth amen and we know that uh they mean science civilization so forth we all realize that those things come from the devil now we realize that uh we as human beings were always this is something that we always that's almost in every christian because as we talk about science as we talk about progress amen there's very few little very few times that i would say that that we would not desire to progress amen but remember the message of the devil is also progression it's about progress about going further about going deeper and more and more and more and more unfortunately i mean i think a lot of times we as christians have the same mentality and we're not actually satisfied with the perfection that god has given us already now how many knows faith is perfect you never have to add the faith you never had to have to say god's the way that god does something whenever you have something that's perfect it doesn't have to be improved upon it doesn't have to progress to something greater amen because it's perfect already i mean you take the three hebrew children take daniel take moses with faith conquering the whole nation take samson takes all of the fellows and for that faith that was perfect amen it is when they try to add to that or make it a little better so to speak it's where to get in trouble now how many knows that's exactly what eve did all right and the thing the very message to very tactic that the devil used to bring us into the condition that we're in he offered eve a little bit more knowledge right and so we know that knowledge amen that's what probably gets that's in the god of deceival age a message called the god of this evil age is a good one to listen to about all of that but listen and he began to preach to her you know if you know god knows that if you partake of this that you're gonna be wise right you're gonna know both good and evil in other words so it is one that it is a tree to make one wise in other words make it smarter amen and so he offered this to eve to begin his kingdom and you know when i begin to think about how that how that christians how how that the power that we rely upon i mean it's not our own power but it's god's power and how the devil and what he uses he doesn't really have any supernatural power now we know there's spirits of lust and different things and and difference of different kind of spirits out there that's that is evil and wicked but you know mostly the devil will use politics he'll take deceit he'll operate under lies isn't that right he greatly uses look at our politics i think our politics is a prime example of what the devil and how he operates to try to get his agenda over you know it gives us new meaning to the phrase lie like the devil right i mean they lie like the devil that's the truth they lie left and right amen and they try to do that you know to try to get over what they're trying to get over amen everything whether it's deceit and lies and manipulation and politics even finances right financial pressure you look at the financial pressure the different ones the boycott even our grocery is uh let's take uh perhaps chick-fil-a or whatever you know the boycott because they are religious or or this that you know and they'll all boycott it that's all that's how the devil has the word the devil works in his kingdom he works under uh you take a whether it's a home or a family or church amen and he doesn't amen he doesn't go to pray about things and when he tries to accomplish something he'll use gossip he'll use uh you know whisperings or sowing little seeds in people's minds get them against each other already he'll use those type of things but it's mostly under lies and that's what exactly what uh you know you know because we know that satan is a murderer he's a liar he's the father of the light of lies the father of murdered father the father of hatred and that's what he used to try to get where he wants to go so we see here that seth of course his lineage we realize that when he began to come it meant it was completely different even they began to call on the name of the lord amen now we're living in age brothers and sisters of course and this is some of the things when i began to think about it it picked up where brother luke talked about be less living in satan's eden how many knows that's what we're doing living in the height of satan's power all right and his eden amen and what he uses and so forth now i want to take and i want you to look at something plumb over in revelation plumb over revelations we're going to look at what's it actually comes down to what the devil uses and the things that the devil uses but uh let me just say this brother bam says no notice it's noteworthy to notice at the beginning seth and his children never went to the scientific way amen then he goes we're going to talk about science for a few minutes now seth's children never went by the scientific route they were humble herdsmen farmers and so forth but cain's children did what they were inspired by their daddy the devil inspired by daddy the devil amen and and listen he says watch the seed of god come down through every age and what there where it's heading up to today christians genuine christians are not at all about scientific research and stuff amen nah he says listen cain did after his nature the devil and worldly knowledge beauty science because if you remember say uh as cain made a beautiful altar brought beautiful fruits and beautiful flowers about all of that to god but that's not what god was looking for let me know that satan is the god of beauty satan is the god of fancy things amen jesus when he come he was born in on over a manure pile in a stable everything about him was humble it was simple it wasn't glamorous not scientific and so forth but all of that we realized from saint king's kingdom and all that amen we know that at one point for the man says science civilization and education all of that is of the devil if you don't think so look at what they're doing and teaching in our schools right now they know that by teaching these things it ain't half right the diamond theory it was never right it was absolutely of the devil they should have kept the spanking spoon in skirts and not in church but in school they should have kept the bible in school they should have had prayer in school but they didn't just kick that out did they no they kicked it out of our courthouse it's the ten commandments now what are they doing tearing down our monuments and everything else of our our great leaders they're gonna tear it all down right just goes to show satan don't like anything that has to do with god amen his kingdom is against god's kingdom and those two forces are at power today amen oh my so we think about it christians are not about scientific research when we think about science how many knows that we're living in a very an age where people have absolutely discovered things they have invented things right and just about everything that you can imagine is out there i mean i go into a hardware store you go over here to fairview perhaps or especially the fairview hardware that's a pretty great place now i mean they've got so much stuff huh every little gizmo how many knows there's a you know oh my sometimes i say look why didn't they just make one screw with one head and stay with it i'm you know i've got a whole bit box with all of the different bits and every time i go to do something i got to pick a different bit because it's made different style and so forth they've invented so many things until it's almost confusing how many my wife today said hey why don't you stop at the store and i said do you need anything from the store while i'm in town and she said yes i need some cornmeal well i says i'll probably get the wrong one so she said i'll send you a picture of what it looks like because you look at cornmeal or whatever there's so many different brands so many different kinds it's rising non-rising i don't know you're just all kinds of stuff we're living in an age i mean we're living in an age of just so much there's so many things they were in daniel i believe it was that it was prophesied that this antichrist and so forth that it would actually cause craft to prosper brother talked about how that how did he would cause craft to prosper the antichrist and so what and he said that craft to prosper means that manufacturing we're living in a the bible even talks about this manufacturing age amen there is there is so much so many different things and then over in revelations i want to read after a bit talks about how that the whole world satan's people amen they long and they love those things amen now i don't know about you but i've read this quote many times out of the church age book where a better man says this is the way he says but in this age of plenty and opportunity and everybody has so much and there is so much more to be had when with all the inventions to do our work and all these many things to give us pleasure now right when you think about all the inventions you think about our washers our dryers our microwave you think about our cars our vehicles our air conditioners well we have an issue if our air conditioner goes on we do not want to put a fan in the window and have to do that are you with me tonight we want that air you know we want the heat or we want air and so forth and this is that myth that even all of these things that give us pleasure ah and remember in the layout of the asia in second timothy three it says that people will actually become lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god so many things that give us pleasure so many things to make it nice yet the things that whenever you have it soft whenever you have it nice all your life you're bound not to have a whole other character your parents might spoil you up till you're 18 20 years old but when you get married you find out that life ain't so pretty after all when you got to fix that flat you got to pay that insurance bill you got to pay this bill you got that bill and you got to get up every morning and you got to be there and life becomes a little more of a grind amen and on top of that if you have friends and while they backstab you and talk bad about you this goes bad and that goes bad amen you gotta learn to deal with all of that amen and a lot of times those good things all of the easiness in our life it isn't what gives us character but it just brings a lot of time that gives us carrot and molds of character we look at the scientific age that we're living in science progress we're living let me see this we're living in the peak of science and progress amen and now look out back a hundred years ago 150 years ago look back at our civil war when we're driving horse and buggy look at the character people had i forget just who it was but i remember after the war the civil war was over and when one person found out that their friend from the other side had died amen and and and so he went was gonna go to the funeral and it was raining and everything and for some reason they told him don't go people have pneumonia people it's it's going around and so forth he says he didn't care he went anyway it got pneumonia died himself why because he had that type of respect for one another people that respect people had character look at the character people had when we had no now we've got everything we've got everything and look at where we are with our character it's terrible isn't it so do all this progress all design and it really didn't do his end again and i heard even the prophet saying that he says all of these inventions all of that hasn't helped us about it and that's no good it's nice to have but you better have the holy ghost in it all because otherwise you'll be spoiled rotten yeah you will be no good if you aren't careful because of all this people get so swallowed up let me say this people get so carried up they get so carried away with getting more stuff they put god last when that's your case your god is the god of this world the things of this world huh and that's where the world's gotten to everybody's about being rich the bible says that they're only in time revelations 3 he says they'll be rich and increase with goods i think they have need of nothing and don't know that they're wretched miserable poor blind naked tattooed earrings men don't know who they are women can we go on it's a terrible shape don't know that you're wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked why because the spiritual person we do not look at the things of this world we don't look at all of it we look to the unseen the bible says we don't look to the scenes because the things that they're seeing are temporal they're like a vapor that come and the vapor that goes look at me i'm looking at you oh you know what i'm looking at i'm looking at a vapor just a vapor you look up here and you're just seeing a vapor a mist it comes and after a while it'll be gone brother leo he was here for a while remember remember now he's gone just a vapor very temporal not eternal amen only one thing's eternal how many knows that that's the things that's not seen the things that you can't touch with your hand but how many know they're real they are real joy is real the holy ghost is real god is real salvation is real but you can't see it you can only see the attributes of it of zenith but everything about the devil is and his kingdom is about the things that you can see amen and the things of this world so even the cities look at the cities of the world amen oh my so now notice christians are not about scientific research here we go back to here we're not about science and all this plenty all of our inventions to do our work make things better for us wouldn't it be nice if because of the fact you just have to push that dryer hit or that washer head wash turn it praise the lord now i can go read more and i can pray more huh because how many knows the only thing that's really important is to be rich in god how many wants to be rich in god tonight how many wants to be richer in god amen i want to be richer that's my whole thought tonight is lord make me richer in you i'm not going to say poor in the natural things huh maybe he'll make you make you poorer amen but let me never let that take away from me being rich in god amen because i don't care if you have things abraham was rich moses was rich many of those people were rich but they all had god first they were richer in god that's what we need to be amen praise the lord not about the scientifics and so forth we're not about the cell phone and all of that other stuff that's not our god amen that's not first it's god that's first it's prayer i mean please there's no substitution if you want to get rich you know how to do it to prayer get on your knees a man is not measured by the size of his bicep or how strong he is but what is he measured by the bags in his knees where he's been followed over in the presence of his maker and has a relationship talks with him amen that's right cain what did he do he was after worldly knowledge now we know one of them know more about the word of god don't we but satan's knowledge is well god didn't really mean that well that business you don't have to really worry about that that's satan's knowledge to add something to what god has said or done already to change it a little bit amen but says cain's children were scientific they were educated there was players of musical instruments like a modern elvis presley or some of this stuff huh how many know some of the most catching music there is in the world is that rock and roll out there i mean i'm talking about christian rock and roll they call it christian rock and roll don't worry about running with the devil and being on the highway to hell you ain't got to be deceived about that it's about that other stuff that talks about christ and and breathe breaking chains and everything else but it's got rock and roll with it be careful of that that's right it may sound good but that don't mean it is all right praise be to god brother bob says knowledge and civilization and true christianity has nothing in common sometimes i think we'd be better off walking down along the road huh but says you know sometimes the church looks to be looking like our churches very fine very nice and everybody gets so settled down you can't hear amen nobody prays enough to say hallelujah be people ain't rich enough to smile not enough christ not enough of the holy ghost i want to tell you what the kingdom of god is here in a minute let's get finished with the kingdom of the devil first amen it's the kingdom of god the devil is to get you caught up in his goodies he's got a lot of goodies vanity fair that's where we're at vanity fair oh my look at these flashing blue lights look at these red oh we're having a sail over here yeah that's right your home broke with things you didn't really need that's how it is spiritually folks oh this may look good oh you find out it didn't it was what it paid out to be amen praise be to god right listen the world today is dedicating themselves to the knowledge which came by satan how many believes that man's day is glorified not by the word of god but by the knowledge oh let this sink in if you get to this part of the place tape stop it and play it and think a while his works the devil's works are exalted above god's word and manifested works the wisdom of satan which he give to eve at the beginning don't miss this the wisdom of satan is exalted to the throne of worship in man above the vindicated word of the hour do you know why the world is in the condition that it's in it's because the church world rejected christ and accepted that wisdom that he gave to eve they begin by saying well there's no more miracles the days of miracles his path do you realize how hard the prophet of god had to fight that during his time everywhere the holy ghost was only for the apostles only for the 12 disciples and a man came to brother bam talking that and he said we speak where the bible speaks we're the bible silent boy they got caught that time because they met a man that knew the maker and the writer writer of the word more than what he knew the writing of the word he knew the author better than he knew the book he said i may not know the book but i know the author real well but he knew the book enough to say well what about the 120 that came out of the upper room what about cornelius what about the 19th chapter of acts where paul ladies and they got the holy ghost blew him all out of the water tried to say only the 12th god and there the bible says in every word hey i got it amen she shall receive the holy ghost that promises to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the lord like god shall call don't shut god's blessings up but they took the knowledge of the devil over the vindicated and proven word of god brother man says and they absolutely exalted the devil to the place that he desired in isaiah the 14th chapter when he said i will exalt my throne above the messengers of god the stars of god i will exalt my throne above those stars whatever they say i will exalt my throne above those amen when came in our generation with the vindication to prove the word they took the barabbas a murderer a lie of the devil over god's vindicated word and threw the whole creation into what spiritual death now now those is satan's kingdom have church they have preachers but the woman's up here preaching she's up here preaching now you know and then boy i tell you what how would you like to have a woman come up in you you better straighten up because sometimes i'll get after you like that that might be easier taking it from a man but from a woman uh-huh whoa you better repent you better get it right whatever you sound like come on folks what in pants short hair mind makeup everything contrary to the word of god say it it's okay to wear sharks and bikinis and everything else they claim to be worshipping god brother ramsay but they're worshipping the devil and brotherhood said the devil absolutely deceived the church world just like he deceived eve and now they are worshiping what they think is god but it's actually the devil they're deceived because that's what it is it's a deceiving age oh my and he's got almost the whole world wrapped up in it amen even to the point of not just women preachers and some cut hair and makeup but now having to take votes of whether they're going to let homosexuals be remember the church even preachers can i say something that's a real bad place that's far gone way out there you've been dead for a very long time if you're at that place amen you let a preacher come into this church and talk about well we should be we should accept homosexuals and stuff this place would empty out so fast i'd be preaching the four walls no i wouldn't be here i'd be right behind you i sure ain't gonna preach nothing like that huh that preacher would be preaching the four walls around here amen but anyway for whoever they needed that that's the truth amen there's a fire waiting how many knows that amen but to dedicate himself to the knowledge that come from satan how many knows oh my the bible says the brown said that the women and all those that belong love the devil for it he lets me do whatever i want to do huh god don't like i said i heard just a few weeks ago people even my phone family trying to say well god just accepts you like you are you can come to him as you are but you won't go away as you are no no no no no when you come to me the very first thing you got to do is repent right don't even bother coming if you're not willing to repent turn around amen repent from all of your wrongs amen but they allow them to do all that wrong and still think that they're serving god boy they're in for a surprise though i mean those it'll it'll it'll show up all right let's turn to revelations a little bit and look at these deities let's look at what really belongs to the devil and what people really thirst and hunger after is that right what people long for revelations 18 now understand that this has happened revelations 18 another angel came down from heaven had mean great power and the earth was lightened with his glory you and i saw that lightning that glory and he cried with a strong voice saying babylon is fall the great has fallen has fallen and has become the habitation of devils but says the churches have become habitations of devils they have become the habitation of devils and the hold of every fowl spirit that's exactly the truth and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird they hate you for telling the truth amen it's reached a point to where people will actually attack people's buildings and everything else if they don't like what you're preaching oh boy somebody i ain't hurt nobody yet but some preachers one of these days he's going to preach on woke on woke amen i believe there's a strong spiritual significance i'll tell you what i believe it's the devils are waking up they didn't care before now they're waking up their anger is all get out they're mean nasty they're murderers [Music] unmerciful that's what woke is i'm mercy it's horrible devilish that comes from the pits of hell that's exactly right amen for all nations that drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings have committed of the earth have committed fornications with her the merchants of the earth are waxed rich to the abundance of her delicacies amen all of these delicacies where do you reckon they come from huh the devil all comes from the devil and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people we literally heard that voice come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and god has rewarded remembered her iniquities reward her even as she awarded you and double under her according to her works in the cup which she has filled fill her double how much she has glorified herself and lived deliciously isn't that exactly what the world tries to do live deliciously just have a wonderful soft life everything's tainting everything's nice amen when the christian is persecuted amen and so much more torment and sorrow give her for she has said in her heart i see the queen and i am no widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death mourning famine and shall be utterly burnt with fire for strong as the lord who judgeth her brother bam says there's a nuclear bomb waiting for rome in one hour she's gonna be blown up one day completely obliterated from what i understand it's russia that's gonna do it the kings of the earth have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they see the smoke of her burning standing the fire for fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city babylon that great city for in one hour is thy judgment come and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise anymore the merchandise of gold silver precious stones pearls fine linen amen how many knows whatever you put before god is your god all of these things become gods to people they love merchandise people love merchandise more than love god amen silk scarlet fine wood all manner of vessels of ivory vessels of precious wood brass iron marbles cinnamon odors ointments frankincense wine oil flowers wheat bees sheep horses chariots amen i was in oh my sick horses chariots and slaves and souls of men how many knows that secretly they're doing all kinds of searches finding out there's people being sold for sex slaves and everything else human trafficking i think they call it right it's more relevant what you realize all of that's going on selling humans you wouldn't think that in our modern age but it is amen the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee amen how many knows all of this is going to come crashing down amen one place it talks about once this jesus comes it'll be that stone that's chewed out of the mountain that'll crush the nation's the fine powder another place it talks about there's an earthquakes where all the cities of the earth fell all the skyscrapers all those yeah they're all coming down no mercy how many knows those people will die there will be no mercy when the wrath of god gets poured out folks it's going to be unlike anybody could ever imagine you can't even imagine it but it'll be terrible because the bible says the great and terrible day of the lord that cometh to destroy the kingdom of the devil they shall find them no more and the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand far off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing amen we know that in revelation i'ma stop right there talk about your riches coming or not but in revelations i believe it's 13. remember that the antichrist the final goal during the tribulation period in about half of half halfway through the tribulation period i believe it is that rome makes a pact with israel all the rich merchants they'll get the gold and the bonds together and the catholics will control all the wealth of the world the pope is going to be the anti he is the antichrist and will become the beast after the bride leaves but they're going to have some complete i've got the quote right here where he says they'll be the ones that have complete control of all the finances and if you don't think that's coming now how many does all these things are coming down close what was it the other day the other day just the other day i was told that now apple and so forth they're going they have permission to go into your phones if they want to look at all your pictures and your texts and everything else then another day i heard that now that they're making all of the banks report your money or they can come and look at your bank account anytime they want to uh what's all that coming down to oh yeah it's a financial squeeze isn't it i don't believe that when it's completely completely enacted i don't think we'll be here but i believe that will feel the pressure of it but the ban says there'll be a squeeze they may shut it down i don't know just where it'll be but you may even shut the church down it'll be right there at that edge right on that brink from what i understand that god will take to take us home amen but even all these things is that's what i'm looking for sometimes you don't understand what all these things are about but i try to look at it from the scripture i try to look at it and what's actually happened because i do know that at the end the very thing is going to be a financial squeeze you won't be able to buy yourself according to revelations 13 and verse 6 he says and he causes all both small sixteen yeah small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads you know how uh what they call the left today how that if you see things different think different what they do they hate you very bad they think you should die you know what they actually come out and say yeah that person should die he should be dead that's the that's the the very spirit core of the spirit of it amen and so this this is the way this spirit's gonna be if you don't agree with him right he's gonna force if you get to take that mark to become part of it to have fellowship with it to receive your mark in their right hand or in their foreheads you better think like they do and that no man might buy ourselves save he that has a mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom he didn't have understanding let him count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six amen i don't think we ever understood it before but the prophet of god he says on the crown of the pope is vicarious feely d instead of the son of god and you take all those roman numerals v5 or whatever it is take all of them and add them up it comes up to 666 666 the pope huh but if you do not i mean so right there we see that financial squeeze he ultimately takes just like manipulation through lies through financial you know people try to bribe you i mean bribery all of that is of the devil i'll give you this or you do this out or the other and here it is anybody that doesn't receive that mark they'll have they'll have control of it i know a lot of people even nowadays they're a little bit funny i i may be a little earlier yet for that but there's a lot of people will have nothing to do with the bag everything's cash but you see how that it'll no doubt probably go to a cashless society to where you can't cash won't mean much anymore let's take about 10 minutes let's talk about the kingdom of god for a minute shall we because we know what's going to happen whenever whenever satan is at the pinnacle of his in his uh kingdom christ will come and do what crush it and grind it to powder right now the children of god don't mean much we're cast out we're sheep amongst wolves is that right don't worry about them if they kill you jesus said that's all they can do is kill you it sounds bad but that's what jesus said all they can do is kill you and then they can't do anymore huh but you know and i don't know i'm not saying that about this age hopefully we won't have to go through any of that but we're going to rapture but look at down through the dark ages the 68 million that they slaughtered they killed amen satan's a ruthless guy let's turn to romans just a few minutes and we'll let you go romans let's look at the kingdom of god and what it is i mean he believes that if you're born again you come into the kingdom of god right jesus has a kingdom right now on earth and he's ruling in that kingdom but it's not like peter said it's a peter thought hey he's going to be our king our king has come let me grab my sword i'm ready to fight ain't nobody going to take my king cut his ear off but jesus says no no no no no this cause is going to go a little different he's going to go a little different here because i'm going to give my life for the sins of the whole world we're going to do some cleansing we're going to do get some people ready on the inside we're going to bring back my sons and daughters in this kingdom and paul was talking about in 14 to 14th chapter he was talking about not putting something in another brother or sister's place to where he caused them to stumble and if you eat meat if certain meats perhaps causes thy brother to stumble well don't eat that meat then when you're with him you know you don't want to cause nobody to stumble all right verse 15 of chapter 14 but if thy brother be of grief with my meat now walk us down not charitably destroy not him with thy me for whom christ died let not then your good be evil spoken spoke of for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink let me just say that it's not all the deities it's not all the good things of this world all the that's not what the kingdom of god is it's got nothing to do with us amen sure we have to eat we have to drink but even jesus said don't worry about what you eat or drink or clothes you know your life is more than god knows all about that amen but what is the kingdom of god it is righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost i like that we're not going to go through great detail but how many knows that the kingdom of god is his forgiveness his grace his mercy the blood of jesus christ that washes you white make you righteous before almighty god it's what's in here i mean it's kingdom of god it's about being right with god that's what the kingdom is all about being right with god and what does that bring it brings peace therefore being justified by faith paul said in romans i think third fourth chapter does therefore justified by faith we have peace with god i don't know about you but i really enjoy that peace how many enjoys that peace that peace that passes understanding he brings you to peace with god and that peace also brings joy in what natural things no in the holy ghost amen because in the world in closing with all the inventions and everything listen he says all he thinks god will give them pleasure it ought to give them joy but it don't does it no we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about about but yet look at the condition of the world today are they happy no they're not at not ever they're not near as happy as what they ever wore when they didn't have as much as what they do why because they're looking for it in a different way but i don't know about you but i just say god help me i want to be rich in god and we only get that one way and that is on our knees and say god i need more of you more of you by reading his word by praying amen by and making time for god amen not let the devil take all of our time let me say this and close don't let the devil take all your time make sure that you give god plenty of time in prayer and in reading and searching your soul looking in the mirror saying god see if there's any wicked way in me because the true kingdom of god is about god making you right with him bringing you with peace and joy in the holy ghost god bless you stand with me tonight musicians if let's bow our heads just think about that over there in revelations think about all of those things that the bible says all those things that thy soul lusted after they all perished i think we should all be careful that our soul doesn't lust after all of those things that's out there but that our soul longs after more of god more of the righteousness of god the peace of god looking for him to come in the clouds of heaven not being tied down to the things of this world bolted down so to speak but to be ready to leave at any time to meet the lord in the air how many want to just raise their hand and say god help me not to be tied to this world but to be rich in you lord make me richer in you tonight lord our hands are all up because that's the desire of our heart father we so we see where all these delicacies is going we see where that's going to end up lord that's going nowhere even all the things that we possess god we realize one day we'll mean nothing our farms our nice houses we don't know whether they'll be taken from us perhaps god we can't put our whole effort and our whole life and our ambitions and our time and everything into him lord we just do what we have to do to get by lord jesus we ask god that you'd help us father that every day we'd seek to get richer in you lord father we ask god that you'd help us to look to your kingdom look to the things that are not seen such as peace and righteousness and joy it's just something that we can have in our hearts know that we have it because you've given it to us lord lord if there's anybody in here that don't really have it father just knows they don't really have it i pray god before sunday that somehow they would find a place and talk to you talk it over with you lord and seek you with all their heart until they find it and they have that righteousness that peace and their joy in the holy ghost we ask it in jesus name amen and amen
