[32:32] honor thy father amen and thy mother
[32:38] which is the first prom commandment with
[32:41] promise that it may be well with thee
[32:44] and that thou mayest live long on the

[32:52] obedient to your parents and you honor
[32:54] them amen God promises you a long life
[32:57] amen amen so praise the Lord and ye

[33:08] my wife I said what can I say about
[33:10] fathers this morning and of course she
[33:12] just had a whole lot she she could say

[33:16] was the responsibility that of us
[33:18] fathers isn't that right amen you're
[33:21] responsible for your wife she's not
[33:23] responsible for you you're responsible
[33:26] for your children you're responsible for
[33:28] every aspect of that home is that right
[33:31] you're responsible for the atmosphere in
[33:34] your home ain't that right amen and so
[33:39] it's just a great great responsibility
[33:42] that husbands and fathers have amen amen
[33:47] and so may God bless each and every one
[33:49] of you with wisdom to be able to have a

[36:28] this morning I think it's on now we're
[36:31] going to go to Psalms 127 we're going to
[36:34] they're just it's a little short Psalms
[36:35] 127 and
[36:38] 128 it is a privilege to have good
[36:41] Fathers thinking this
[36:44] morning well oh dismissed for Sunday
[36:46] school yeah
[36:50] gotcha it's such a privilege to have
[36:52] good Fathers we're talking this morning
[36:53] how you know life takes different people
[36:55] different ways and uh
[36:58] some people some fathers and mothers
[36:59] they don't seem to make it it's a
[37:01] privilege to be in a house uh for for
[37:04] the kids to be in a house where their
[37:06] fathers and mothers are still
[37:08] together and uh to have good Fathers and
[37:11] good Mothers and I was thinking you know
[37:14] what a privilege to have our heavenly
[37:16] father if it wasn't for him none of us
[37:18] would be here this morning so honor and
[37:21] a privilege so we'll start here in
[37:22] Psalms 127 and it's just a short one so
[37:25] we're going to do 127 and 128 this
[37:27] morning
[37:28] morning except the Lord build the house
[37:31] they labor in vain that build it except
[37:34] the Lord keep the city The Watchman
[37:36] waketh but in
[37:46] vain Lo children are inheritage of the
[37:50] Lord and the fruit of the womb is his
[37:52] reward
[37:59] happy is the man that hath his quiver
[38:01] full of them they shall not be ashamed
[38:03] but they shall speak with the enemies in
[38:06] the
[38:12] gate for Thou shalt eat the labor of
[38:15] thine hands happy shalt thou be and it
[38:18] shall be well with thee
[38:30] behold that thus shall the man be
[38:32] blessed that fearth the
[38:40] Lord this one together yay Thou shalt
[38:43] see thy children children in peace upon
[38:47] Israel God bless you may be seated
[38:49] brother Brian
[39:07] Lord bless you
[39:09] all and all your fathers I was thinking
[39:11] about what brother Thomas just said
[39:14] about that 18yearold that wants to get
[39:16] out of his father house and I'd have to
[39:18] raise my hand I was one of those many
[39:20] years ago I come from one of them
[39:23] families where your father tells you
[39:24] when you're 16 years old Brian what are
[39:27] you going to do when you get out of high
[39:29] school well it's not going to be here so
[39:32] I was just thinking about that we all
[39:34] are ra different we all have different
[39:36] fathers not that he was a he wasn't a
[39:38] bad father he was a good father but he
[39:40] was serious about what you're going to
[39:42] do in your life and he would to let you
[39:44] know at 16 15 years old you're not going
[39:47] to do it around here I was just thinking
[39:49] about that you know he's gone now but I
[39:51] was just thinking that really came to my
[39:53] thought there and not to say that that's
[39:55] how you should raise your family but
[39:57] we're all raised different we all come
[39:59] from different families that have
[40:00] different ways we do things doesn't mean
[40:02] one way is better than the other just
[40:04] means some just funny when I was thought
[40:07] but I was that uh scripture we were
[40:09] reading the first one there except the
[40:12] Lord build the house they labor in vain
[40:14] I mean you could spend hours just
[40:16] talking about that one little sentence
[40:18] right there unless God built your house
[40:21] and it's built on the foundation of
[40:23] Jesus Christ it's all vanity it won't
[40:25] mean anything on that day it won't carry
[40:28] you over like I was saying the other
[40:31] week where I'm reading in Ezekiel you
[40:34] know it's with the devotional you know
[40:37] you could do all your righteousness all
[40:39] your life and it wouldn't mean anything
[40:42] on that day if you let it go and that's
[40:45] as I get older I realize as you fight
[40:47] your life every day as you struggle in
[40:49] things you just don't want to let it go
[40:52] you want to keep going forward in Christ
[40:54] this morning but before I get carried
[40:56] away here I was um I haven't done this
[40:59] in a
[41:00] while um I'm not getting any younger so
[41:04] so I went ahead and put all the bills of
[41:06] the church other than the propane bill
[41:08] on autopay you know we don't have no
[41:11] continuing City here you know so you
[41:13] never know when you're going to be or
[41:15] not so all the church's bills I put on
[41:18] so the internet and the power and the
[41:20] water bill I put them on auto pay and
[41:23] they're not big enough amounts that not
[41:25] being on auto pay is going to affect the
[41:28] overall general fund the thing about the
[41:31] propane being on autofill I'd have to
[41:33] work out work it out with the propane
[41:35] company where they come every month and
[41:38] check the tank that way you don't wind
[41:40] up with a $4,000 propane bill in the
[41:44] middle of the year so I I hadn't talked
[41:46] to them about and that's something the
[41:48] pastor and the trustees I need to talk
[41:50] to before I do something like that and
[41:53] right now on the building fund we use
[41:55] the building fund to pay for the cameras
[41:59] and everything that they did a couple of
[42:01] weeks ago and that's down I put money in
[42:04] the building fund so we would have that
[42:08] to pay that and we're down to about
[42:10] $1,500 in the building fund and then in
[42:13] the general fund we're about $112,000
[42:16] give or take a few change I've been
[42:18] paying the water bill and the electric
[42:20] bill in cash for the last several months
[42:24] so that I don't write a lot of checks CU
[42:26] they C cost money too so right now if
[42:30] everything on auto pay it should go
[42:32] pretty good I don't see any major
[42:35] expense expenses through the summer
[42:38] other than what they still want to do in
[42:39] the church with the back and the cameras
[42:42] and stuff I know brother Micah told me
[42:45] that he's got to get a few more things
[42:47] to fix what went wrong so I hadn't got
[42:49] the bills for that so that's where we're
[42:52] at with the finances right now like I I
[42:56] don't I don't know if I'm the scary
[42:58] person to talk to or not but I always
[43:00] tell you don't be afraid to ask to me
[43:02] about how I do the finances or how I do
[43:05] it I'm more than able to talk the only
[43:07] thing I won't ever say since I've been
[43:10] what I've probably been the church's
[43:12] treasurer
[43:14] for what's 2000 probably 20 21 years now
[43:18] so that's been a long time but if we'll
[43:21] go back to uh Psalms um 26
[43:27] I was listening to a message this
[43:29] morning but and then I'm going to jump
[43:32] up to I'll just read it's not a long
[43:34] Psalm either and I was just thinking as
[43:37] I get older I'm as I read I'll give you
[43:40] a chance to turn there Psalm 26 really
[43:44] has us examining ourselves as as people
[43:48] but I'll just read it Judge Me Oh Lord
[43:51] for I have walked in my integrity and I
[43:53] have trusted also in the Lord therefore
[43:56] I shall not slide so David saying
[43:59] everything that he's done he's his
[44:02] Integrity is based on being in the lord
[44:04] it's not his own personal Integrity
[44:06] which we all have all of us have our own
[44:09] personal but this Integrity is the
[44:12] Integrity that God gives you to fulfill
[44:14] his word and he goes on to say examine
[44:17] me oh
[44:18] Lord and prove me try my Reigns in my
[44:21] heart so David is continually asking if
[44:24] you go through all the Psalms David is
[44:27] continually asking the Lord to try him
[44:29] to prove him to make sure that he's on a
[44:32] stable ground in what he's believing and
[44:35] what he's doing and he goes on to say
[44:37] for thy love and kindness is before mine
[44:39] eyes and I have walked in thy truth I
[44:42] have not sat with vain persons neither
[44:44] will I go with dissemblers and when I
[44:47] read a scripture like this fourth
[44:49] scripture here you can bring it in into
[44:51] our day and age whether you are an old
[44:54] man a young man whatever a young woman
[44:57] woman an old woman with all the
[44:59] technology out there you can take a that
[45:01] fourth scripture right there and apply
[45:03] it to your life right now this morning
[45:06] are you do you find yourself drifting in
[45:08] things online or drifting in things in
[45:11] the world that you shouldn't be drifting
[45:13] into and that's what and you know
[45:16] especially online it's if you're not
[45:18] careful there's all kind of vain people
[45:21] online this morning so you got to be
[45:23] careful about that it goes on I have
[45:26] hated the congregation of the evildoers
[45:28] and it will not sit with the wicked I
[45:31] will wash my hands in iny so I will
[45:33] Compass thine altar oh Lord that I may
[45:37] publish with the voice of Thanksgiving
[45:39] and tell all the one tell all the
[45:41] wondrous work you know that's the thing
[45:43] about a Christian Christian isn't going
[45:45] to live in the negative he's always
[45:46] going to live in the positive doesn't
[45:48] mean that things don't happen to you
[45:50] where you have a bad bad thoughts or bad
[45:53] ideas but you're always going to live in
[45:54] the positive not in the negative and he
[45:57] goes on to say Lord I have loved thy
[45:59] habitations of thy house and the places
[46:01] where thy honor dwelleth and not
[46:04] bringing it into our day and age that's
[46:05] you this morning God chose you to dwell
[46:08] in this morning you're that habitation
[46:10] that he wants to have in the world that
[46:12] we live in this morning he through you
[46:14] he wants to show the world who he is
[46:17] this morning and he goes on gather not
[46:19] my soul with the Sinners nor my life
[46:22] with the bloody men whose hands is
[46:24] mischief and their right hand is full of
[46:26] bribes
[46:27] that's the world we live in this morning
[46:29] it hasn't changed in 4,000 years People
[46:32] Are People they're going to be just the
[46:34] technology to have that's the only thing
[46:36] that's changed people are people I I I
[46:39] thing I say a lot but as for me I will
[46:41] walk in my Integrity Redeem Me be
[46:43] merciful unto me my foot standeth in an
[46:47] even place in the congregation will I
[46:49] bless the Lord I like that word evening
[46:51] every evening Place everything that
[46:53] David did was in a balance everything
[46:56] everything in his life was in a balance
[46:58] with the word of God nothing was more
[47:00] one way or the other and then if you
[47:02] would jump with me if I haven't lost my
[47:04] place here uh to I probably have knowing
[47:09] myself the 13th chapter of 2 Corinthians
[47:12] this is where Paul's talking to the
[47:15] Corinthian church this
[47:21] morning I know I get in a hurry I
[47:23] apologize for that but you know thing I
[47:27] was thinking about being Father's Day
[47:32] you know to be a good father a father
[47:34] was just the leader he's he's the
[47:36] leadership for that family he's who
[47:39] God's chosen to be the leader for that
[47:41] family and I always I know I I've
[47:44] probably said this before there's two
[47:45] things about being a good leader two
[47:47] things that are really important I know
[47:50] Integrity is important all those virtues
[47:52] are important but there's two things
[47:55] that people have to know about you you
[47:57] to be a good leader one thing is they
[47:59] always have to know your mind and I say
[48:01] that a lot what I mean by your mind they
[48:03] know no matter what happens in the in
[48:07] life whatever
[48:09] circumstances come especially being a
[48:11] good father whatever happens they know
[48:13] that you're going to do the right thing
[48:15] no matter what happens you're always
[48:17] going to do the right thing no ma how
[48:19] much it hurts your hide how much it's
[48:21] going to put you off odds you're always
[48:24] going to do the right thing that's one
[48:26] of the most important things and the
[48:29] next important thing is you're going to
[48:31] be empathetic and you're going to care
[48:33] for the people around you and if they
[48:36] bite your fingers off you're still going
[48:37] to do it because again goes back to that
[48:39] first thing it's the right thing to do
[48:42] and then that another thing to be a good
[48:43] leader or be a good father you always
[48:45] have to train the people that you're
[48:48] around you whether they want to be
[48:49] trained or not whether your son or your
[48:52] daughter want to be instructed you're
[48:53] always going to go out of your way to
[48:56] make sure instructed in the things of
[48:58] life so they're successful and you
[49:00] always train people you whether it's
[49:03] look at your family you're always going
[49:04] to train your sons and daughters so that
[49:06] if you're not here that day that they've
[49:09] had an example and they've been given
[49:11] the word Al life and the truth and no
[49:13] matter whether you're here or not
[49:15] they'll be able to be successful in
[49:17] their life in whatever they endeav to do
[49:20] and that's a good between a good leader
[49:22] and a bad leader a bad leader is going
[49:24] to hold power he's not going to share
[49:27] power with people and he won't
[49:29] disseminate and give it out that's the
[49:31] difference and if you're Christians are
[49:33] not that way they always go out of their
[49:35] way to help people whether it's going to
[49:37] hurt them or not they're just going to
[49:39] do the right thing and let me get back
[49:41] to this 13th chapter here and this is
[49:44] the third time I've come to you in the
[49:47] mouth of two or three witness shall
[49:49] every word be
[49:50] established I've told you
[49:53] before excuse me I've foretold you as
[49:56] was present second time being absent now
[49:59] I write to them which henceforth have
[50:00] sinned and to all the others that if I
[50:03] come again I will not spare since you
[50:06] seek proof of Christ speaking in me and
[50:09] you can bring this back to our day and
[50:11] age you have proof that God has spoke to
[50:13] us in this age speaking in me which to
[50:16] you word is not weak but is mighty in
[50:18] you for though he was crucified through
[50:21] weakness yet he lived by the power of
[50:23] God for we are also weak in him but we
[50:26] shall live with him by the power of God
[50:29] toward you and I was just thinking about
[50:31] this fifth goes back to the psalm I read
[50:34] earlier and Paul says here examine
[50:36] yourself whether you be in the faith
[50:39] prove your own selves know you not that
[50:41] your own selves how Jesus Christ is in
[50:44] you except you be
[50:46] reprobates but I trust that you shall
[50:48] know that we are not reprobates now I
[50:51] pray God that you do know we that's what
[50:54] I like about old brother Paul he always
[50:56] is encouraging to the people now I pray
[50:59] to God that you do know evil not that we
[51:02] should appear approved but that you
[51:05] should do that which is
[51:07] honest but we be as reprobates so no
[51:10] matter what was going on in their lives
[51:12] he was always telling them to do the
[51:15] right thing and I I wrote this this I
[51:17] was listening to that message this
[51:20] morning and it it really struck me what
[51:23] he he I'm paraphrasing this is not
[51:27] exactly if you have a lot of problems in
[51:30] your life are you listening to that
[51:32] small voice and this is what if you're
[51:34] listening to anything other than that
[51:36] still Small Voice in your life anything
[51:39] else other than that which is the
[51:41] presence of the Holy Ghost and Christ
[51:43] through you speaking to your
[51:44] circumstances in your life which brings
[51:47] you your strength he goes this is what
[51:50] brother Brown
[51:52] had he said then you need to go back to
[51:55] that cave you need to go back to where
[51:56] it all started again and start over
[51:59] again and then he wrote he he in that
[52:02] message he said you need to get back to
[52:04] that cave always remember that the voice
[52:06] is always centered in the Bible and in
[52:09] his word so that voice when you see that
[52:11] voice speaks to you this morning it's
[52:14] always going to be centered in the word
[52:15] of God the message of the hour in the
[52:18] Bible if that voice is having you do
[52:20] things other than this this morning then
[52:22] it ain't God's voice speaking to
[52:25] you Brother David

[1:36:00] name we pray amen amen I want to read
[1:36:04] you a little quote to get started here
[1:36:06] and I want you to think about this and
[1:36:08] brother Brandon's preaching and he says
[1:36:10] he says God is trying to get man to look
[1:36:13] to that innocent substitute for a way
[1:36:17] back and man wants to look at it in his
[1:36:20] own way there's where we get in trouble
[1:36:23] and he said he don't want to see what
[1:36:26] God is trying to show him in this
[1:36:28] innocent
[1:36:29] substitute therefore that's what caused
[1:36:32] the trouble he said then man what he
[1:36:34] does he picks up the glasses to view off
[1:36:37] in a long distance to see what God's
[1:36:40] trying to show him and he fails to focus
[1:36:43] his glasses
[1:36:46] right yep yeah turn with me to Daniel 10
[1:36:50] and we'll read there for several verses
[1:36:52] one of my favorite scriptures and
[1:36:54] lessons in the Bible and just how God
[1:36:57] moves and I just appreciate it so Daniel
[1:36:59] 10 and verse
[1:37:00] one in the third year of Cyrus King of
[1:37:04] Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel
[1:37:07] whose name was called belto jesar and
[1:37:09] the thing was true but the time
[1:37:11] appointed was long and he understood the
[1:37:13] thing and had understanding of the
[1:37:15] vision in those days I Daniel was
[1:37:19] mourning three full weeks what a place
[1:37:21] to be in that you're mourning for for
[1:37:23] three full weeks I ate no Pleasant bread
[1:37:27] neither came flesh nor wine to my mouth
[1:37:30] neither did I anoint myself at all till
[1:37:32] three whole weeks were fulfilled and in
[1:37:35] the fourth and 20th day of the first
[1:37:37] month as I was by the side of the Great
[1:37:39] River which is ekiel then I lifted up my
[1:37:42] eyes and looked and behold a certain man
[1:37:45] clothed in linen whose loins were girded
[1:37:48] with fine gold of eaz his body was also
[1:37:51] like Barrel his face as the appearance
[1:37:54] of lightning and his eyes as lamps of
[1:37:57] fire his arms and his feet like the
[1:38:00] color to Polished brass and the voice of
[1:38:04] his words like the voice of a multitude
[1:38:07] and I Daniel alone saw the vision for
[1:38:10] the men that were there with me saw not
[1:38:13] the vision but a great quaking fell upon
[1:38:15] them so that they fled to hide
[1:38:17] themselves so can you imagine here's
[1:38:19] Daniel seeing this man come down from
[1:38:22] God and it's such a such an appearance
[1:38:24] such an Awakening and the the the Earth
[1:38:27] began to quake and the men couldn't see
[1:38:29] this man but just the very anointing and
[1:38:31] the presence of God moving on the scene
[1:38:34] shook these men to
[1:38:36] flee woo therefore I was left alone and
[1:38:40] I saw this great vision and there
[1:38:43] remained no strength in me for my
[1:38:46] comeliness was turned unto uh in me into
[1:38:49] corruption and I regain retained no
[1:38:51] strength yet I heard the voice of his
[1:38:54] words and when he heard the voice of
[1:38:56] when I heard the voice of his words then
[1:38:59] I was in a deep sleep fell up on my face
[1:39:02] and my face toward the ground and behold
[1:39:05] a hand touched me which set me upon my
[1:39:09] knees and on the palms of my hands so
[1:39:12] now here's
[1:39:14] Daniel has fallen down to his hands and
[1:39:16] knees at the very presence of this being
[1:39:19] that's standing before him the anointing
[1:39:21] has made the others flee and now here
[1:39:23] Daniel is on his hands and knees at the
[1:39:25] entity of of God before him and he said
[1:39:28] he spake unto me and said oh Daniel a
[1:39:30] man greatly
[1:39:32] beloved is't that the way you want to be
[1:39:34] approached by
[1:39:36] God understand the words that I speak
[1:39:38] unto thee and stand upright for now I
[1:39:41] For unto thee am I now sent and when he
[1:39:45] had spoken this word unto me I stood
[1:39:48] trembling then said he unto me fear not
[1:39:51] Daniel for from the first day for from
[1:39:56] the first
[1:39:57] day wow thou that thou didst set thine
[1:40:02] heart to understand and to chasen
[1:40:04] thyself before God thy words were heard
[1:40:07] and I come for thy words from the first
[1:40:11] day from the first time from the first
[1:40:14] words from the first desire from the
[1:40:16] first need from the first
[1:40:21] situation I heard you and I come I'm
[1:40:24] come for your words but watch what
[1:40:29] happens but the prince of the kingdom of
[1:40:32] Persia so now here's the enemy and Satan
[1:40:35] now has has this being that's come into
[1:40:38] into into this this uh between the the
[1:40:41] conversation between God and and between
[1:40:43] Daniel and what he's asking from God and
[1:40:46] so now Satan has now put this demon
[1:40:48] power in there this evil anointing to
[1:40:50] come down there to interrupt to destroy
[1:40:53] destroy to dispute to dishearten to
[1:40:57] discourage how many times have we prayed
[1:40:59] and been
[1:41:00] discouraged sure we have what's
[1:41:03] happening behind the scenes is Satan has
[1:41:06] put a prince of an entire Kingdom to
[1:41:10] come and interrupt what we have need of
[1:41:12] from
[1:41:16] God the kingdom of the Prince of Persia
[1:41:19] withstood me one in 20 days 21 days
[1:41:25] and but low Michael one of the chief
[1:41:27] princes thank God that there's a higher
[1:41:33] power he came to help me and I remained
[1:41:36] there with the kings of Persia but now I
[1:41:38] am come to make thee uh understand what
[1:41:41] shall befall thy people in the latter
[1:41:44] days for yet the vision is for many days
[1:41:46] and when he had spoken such words unto
[1:41:48] me I set my face toward the ground and I
[1:41:51] became dumb do we have first the
[1:41:55] Thessalonians can you bring up first
[1:41:58] Thessalonians you can look at it on the
[1:42:00] screen save you some page
[1:42:02] turning 1 Thessalonians 5:1
[1:42:05] 17 says pray without
[1:42:08] ceasing let's all say that together pray
[1:42:12] without
[1:42:13] ceasing you can have your seats may the
[1:42:15] Lord add His blessings to the reading of
[1:42:17] the
[1:42:17] word sometimes I think that maybe where
[1:42:20] we fall a little short first
[1:42:22] Thessalonians
[1:42:26] 5 brother brandham tells a story and he
[1:42:29] tells a story of a young girl that was
[1:42:32] in love with a young
[1:42:34] man and this young man ended up marrying
[1:42:36] another
[1:42:38] woman and it broke this young girl's
[1:42:40] heart and she was at a place in her life
[1:42:43] where she couldn't get over it and she
[1:42:45] kept making excuses and and trying to
[1:42:47] figure out this situation and and and so
[1:42:50] things were going going a little bit of
[1:42:51] R in her life and but brother brandham
[1:42:54] looks at it and he said' but she had a
[1:42:55] different kind of heart trouble it was a
[1:42:57] spiritual heart trouble he said yes her
[1:43:00] lover had run off and married some other
[1:43:02] woman and yet she was still in love and
[1:43:05] she thought this boy still loved her and
[1:43:07] she's blaming on the father from what I
[1:43:08] can gather from the story he's BL she's
[1:43:10] blaming it on the father and trying to
[1:43:12] explain all this to brother brandom
[1:43:14] what's going on and why she's in the
[1:43:15] place that she's in and brother Brandon
[1:43:17] looks at her and he says oh
[1:43:21] nonsense you talking about some playing
[1:43:23] Kentucky English oh nonsense he said he
[1:43:27] didn't have to go and marry that other
[1:43:29] girl he did it because he failed to have
[1:43:31] the right kind of love for you he says
[1:43:34] that's exactly he said but see you're
[1:43:36] all wound up into that he said this girl
[1:43:39] sitting there in such a stoop
[1:43:41] like she's letting this situation
[1:43:44] control completely control her life
[1:43:46] she's sitting there in a stoop like and
[1:43:47] she's saying oh I know Johnny loves me I
[1:43:50] know he does and he says there that
[1:43:53] that's all she could
[1:43:54] see all she could see was that she
[1:43:57] thought Johnny loved her and he says
[1:44:00] that's all she could see she lived in
[1:44:02] that one little world by herself until
[1:44:05] she had formed herself in
[1:44:08] there and he said and I took a hold of
[1:44:10] her hand and I said listen to me he said
[1:44:13] the Lord showed me a vision he said and
[1:44:16] she knew that I didn't know about a
[1:44:18] situation that transaction that had
[1:44:20] happened between them and he said and
[1:44:22] when I said that it snapped her right
[1:44:24] out real quick he said and I said now
[1:44:27] while you're out of there look to
[1:44:29] Calvary while you're out of that little
[1:44:31] mully grubs while you're out of that
[1:44:33] little world that you built around
[1:44:35] yourself while you're in out of that
[1:44:37] world of depression and anxiety look to
[1:44:40] Calvary he says look to Calvary he said
[1:44:44] you're going out there and you've tried
[1:44:46] to start drinking he said you're a
[1:44:49] Minister's daughter a Pentecostal
[1:44:50] Minister's daughter doing the things
[1:44:52] that you're doing and you're all you're
[1:44:54] trying to do is drown out your Sorrows
[1:44:57] he said that man somebody that don't
[1:44:59] care the snap of your fingers for you he
[1:45:02] said I said look to Calvary girl that's
[1:45:04] the way
[1:45:06] back and he says we got to get ourselves
[1:45:10] focused now he's talking to the
[1:45:13] congregation we got to get ourselves
[1:45:15] focused we got to get ourselves focused
[1:45:17] to whether we live or die or sink or
[1:45:20] drown it's Calvary that's where we look
[1:45:23] to it's Calvary no matter what happens
[1:45:25] in our life he says that's the thing
[1:45:27] that God wants us to come back
[1:45:30] to you see brothers and sisters a lot of
[1:45:33] times in Christ we can find all the
[1:45:36] answers to our
[1:45:37] problems but we fail to tap in to the
[1:45:41] resources of that
[1:45:44] power everything we have need of God
[1:45:47] lays before us and we fail to use it and
[1:45:50] utilize it there's a a story a true
[1:45:54] story about a woman in Wales this Welsh
[1:45:56] woman she lived out in a remote Valley
[1:45:59] somewhere and for years she saved her
[1:46:01] money and saved all of her her savings
[1:46:04] and and worked hard and went through a
[1:46:05] lot of trouble and expense and she
[1:46:07] wanted to have the electrical company
[1:46:09] come and put Power in her home so for
[1:46:12] years she saved up and got all this done
[1:46:14] so they come and the electrical company
[1:46:16] comes and they they run the electricity
[1:46:18] down there and they hook up the line and
[1:46:20] and they go about their way and they say
[1:46:21] there you go you've got to electricity
[1:46:24] use it as you want it just use all you
[1:46:26] need we've got all we need use it
[1:46:29] all time goes on and Electrical Company
[1:46:31] notices after a couple of months that
[1:46:34] there's not any electricity much being
[1:46:36] used just a minute amount of electricity
[1:46:39] is being used and they thought well
[1:46:40] maybe something's wrong with the hookup
[1:46:43] so they send out a technician to go out
[1:46:45] there they send out a meter reader and
[1:46:47] the meter reader and the technician go
[1:46:48] and they look and they begin to check
[1:46:50] everything out and they knock on her
[1:46:51] door and they say ma'am
[1:46:53] we notice you're not using much
[1:46:55] electricity but we we can't find that
[1:46:57] there's any
[1:46:58] problem and and she says oh no yeah
[1:47:01] there's no there's no problem we're
[1:47:03] quite
[1:47:05] satisfied and they she said we turn on
[1:47:07] the electric lights every night so we
[1:47:10] can see how to light our lamps and then
[1:47:12] we turn them back
[1:47:16] off true
[1:47:18] story and we laugh and we chuckle but
[1:47:22] let's let's app this and let look at
[1:47:24] this why was it why didn't this woman
[1:47:26] make more use of her electricity she
[1:47:28] said because I am
[1:47:33] satisfied how many times are we sitting
[1:47:35] here satisfied with where we're at
[1:47:38] murmuring complaining Molly
[1:47:41] grubbing not getting all that God has in
[1:47:44] store for us and we're quite
[1:47:50] satisfied let me tell you she beli
[1:47:52] believed in that
[1:47:54] electricity she believed in the
[1:47:56] electricity she believed that that that
[1:47:58] that that that everything she had need
[1:48:00] of was right there she believed in the
[1:48:04] promises she believed in the promises
[1:48:07] the electric company told her that she
[1:48:08] could have all
[1:48:15] things we're letting that sink in just a
[1:48:18] little bit she went to a great deal of
[1:48:20] trouble to get these wires run into her
[1:48:23] house but what she didn't understand is
[1:48:25] she didn't understand the potential of
[1:48:27] the electricity in her
[1:48:29] home are you with me she could have
[1:48:32] cooked on an electric stove she didn't
[1:48:35] have to go build a fire in an oven
[1:48:37] anymore and toll over that and sweat
[1:48:38] over that she didn't have to she didn't
[1:48:41] have to go out there and wash clothes on
[1:48:43] a old washboard anymore no she could
[1:48:45] have had an electric
[1:48:47] washer she didn't have to set in the SM
[1:48:49] smelter in heat like can you imagine
[1:48:52] today without air conditioning I hope
[1:48:53] all of us have air conditioning thank
[1:48:55] God for air
[1:48:56] conditioning she could have had air
[1:49:00] conditioning but she failed to
[1:49:03] realize the power that laid within her
[1:49:08] very
[1:49:12] house where's the power that lays within
[1:49:16] our house where is the power what do we
[1:49:18] do with the power are we using it
[1:49:21] sparingly are we using the power that
[1:49:23] God has given us
[1:49:25] sparingly I believe that's a reason that
[1:49:28] sometimes things happen like that for at
[1:49:30] least for some Christians because they
[1:49:31] don't understand exactly how prayer
[1:49:33] works you know sometimes I believe
[1:49:36] people uh they they get to a place that
[1:49:38] they and they think well it really
[1:49:39] doesn't matter if I pray or
[1:49:44] not yeah it really doesn't matter if I
[1:49:47] pray or not or are they believe well
[1:49:49] God's going to do what God's going to do
[1:49:51] so what does it matter why I bother
[1:49:54] I tell you Prayer Changes
[1:49:57] Things I said Prayer Changes Things
[1:50:00] prayer will remove tumors Prayer Will
[1:50:03] Fix heart valves prayer will give you
[1:50:06] Deliverance of anything you have need of
[1:50:08] prayer is a deliverer it's a
[1:50:11] redeemer prayer will take a prodical
[1:50:13] child and turn them around in the middle
[1:50:15] of the road and send them back home
[1:50:17] that's what prayer does that's right
[1:50:23] but sometimes we look at prayer we we we
[1:50:26] we think oh I I'll pray when all else
[1:50:28] fails when the bank don't give me alone
[1:50:30] I'll
[1:50:33] pray when the doctors say they can't do
[1:50:35] nothing we'll pray it's not when the
[1:50:37] doctors say they can't do nothing it's
[1:50:40] when the when the problem starts we
[1:50:42] begin to pray because when you pray God
[1:50:45] begins to move on the
[1:50:48] scene but yeah we sometimes look at it
[1:50:50] like a hell marry pass in a football
[1:50:53] game yeah yeah there's there's
[1:50:56] Christians that do that they just throw
[1:50:58] up a prayer in hopes that some way
[1:51:00] somehow God will hear
[1:51:08] them but in their hearts they don't view
[1:51:12] prayer as making an impact in their
[1:51:15] lives I'm going to tell you brothers and
[1:51:17] sisters on a day-to-day life day-to-day
[1:51:20] business day-to-day your life prayer
[1:51:23] makes a difference and prayer needs to
[1:51:26] be a big major part of the first thing
[1:51:28] you do in the morning God Lead Me Guide
[1:51:31] Me take me where I need to go God make
[1:51:33] me say what I need to
[1:51:38] say let me tell you how important it is
[1:51:40] Daniel Prayed three times every day and
[1:51:44] theologians think that he had an actual
[1:51:46] prayer chamber built with the windows
[1:51:48] permanently open facing Jerusalem so
[1:51:52] that no nobody could shut him
[1:51:54] out nobody was going to stop Daniel from
[1:51:56] making contact with God so he prayed and
[1:51:59] he prayed for three days what was he
[1:52:02] doing for three times a day he prayed in
[1:52:04] the Lion's
[1:52:05] Den he prayed for for wisdom he prayed
[1:52:09] for guidance he prayed that God would
[1:52:11] forgive the people of Israel and turn
[1:52:13] them around back to their homes that's
[1:52:15] what Daniel was doing he was a prayer
[1:52:19] Warrior and Daniel now struggling for
[1:52:22] and prayer for 21
[1:52:25] days 21
[1:52:29] days how many of us Christians please
[1:52:31] don't raise your hands with struggle to
[1:52:33] pray 21 days for one
[1:52:36] thing oh I can tell by your I can tell
[1:52:38] by your by your looks you don't have to
[1:52:41] raise your
[1:52:45] hands some of us struggle to pray for
[1:52:47] two
[1:52:49] days let's just be let's just just get
[1:52:51] to the reality of it sometimes we
[1:52:53] struggle to even get anything before God
[1:52:56] because we live in such a fast-paced uh
[1:52:59] hectic world that man sometimes we even
[1:53:01] forget what our even needs are what is
[1:53:02] most desire in our life to even take to
[1:53:06] God but 21
[1:53:08] days Daniel looked here Daniel stayed
[1:53:12] here and Daniel knew that if I'm going
[1:53:14] to have victory in my life I've got to
[1:53:17] stay before God
[1:53:22] yeah brothers and sisters he didn't rely
[1:53:24] on his he didn't rely on his knowledge
[1:53:27] he didn't rely on maybe well maybe if
[1:53:30] this happens that that things will get
[1:53:32] better for Israel he didn't he didn't
[1:53:34] sit there and rely upon wishful
[1:53:36] thinking how many times we do that I
[1:53:40] hope I hope this situation turns around
[1:53:44] I hope my child comes back to God why
[1:53:47] are you hoping Why not start believing
[1:53:49] Why not start praying day after day
[1:53:52] after after day after day until you get
[1:53:54] the victory just like
[1:53:56] Daniel the victory is
[1:54:03] yours because he knew with God I'll find
[1:54:06] my answers he knew with God I can find
[1:54:09] my answers with God I'll find
[1:54:11] Deliverance in this Lion's Den can you
[1:54:14] imagine those Fierce lons you think they
[1:54:16] wasn't hungry and starving and wanting
[1:54:18] some some fresh warm blood and flesh in
[1:54:21] their mouth
[1:54:24] you'd go to praying
[1:54:26] too if you never prayed you'd start
[1:54:29] praying but he knew that if he could
[1:54:31] just get before God there would be
[1:54:33] Deliverance in the Lion's Den he knew
[1:54:35] that if he would find it the that with
[1:54:37] God he could find direction in his life
[1:54:39] and he knew with God he could find the
[1:54:41] answers of his way and he knew with God
[1:54:44] he could have
[1:54:46] Victory think about those three hrew
[1:54:49] children when they stand there and are
[1:54:51] going before a furnace has been heated
[1:54:53] over and over and over and over and over
[1:54:56] time by time by time hotter than
[1:55:00] standard you think they didn't know that
[1:55:03] they had to start
[1:55:05] praying they needed a God to move on the
[1:55:08] scene or they was going to be crispy
[1:55:12] Critters and so they begin to pray and
[1:55:14] they found out that With God all things
[1:55:17] are
[1:55:20] possible and if we want the victory in
[1:55:22] our lives brothers and sisters we this
[1:55:24] morning we got to call God on the scene
[1:55:26] to our battles to where we don't give up
[1:55:30] to where we don't give in just keep
[1:55:32] calling and let God know that the answer
[1:55:35] is on the way be
[1:55:38] persistent persistent prayer will get
[1:55:40] you
[1:55:42] results I didn't say
[1:55:46] Prosperity we better not get on those
[1:55:48] guys
[1:55:55] yeah Paul
[1:55:58] Harvey you know the rest of the story
[1:56:01] right he tells a story about a
[1:56:03] three-year-old boy him and his mom are
[1:56:06] gone to the grocery store and they enter
[1:56:09] into the grocery store right before they
[1:56:12] get in she said now son let me tell you
[1:56:16] no chocolate chip cookies today don't
[1:56:19] even ask
[1:56:22] she puts him in the buggy in the seat
[1:56:24] and the what y'all laughing you like
[1:56:26] chocolate chip
[1:56:29] cookies and she puts them in a basket in
[1:56:31] the little seat you know the little
[1:56:32] thing with in the front of the buggy and
[1:56:35] so they begin to go down through the
[1:56:36] aisles there and she's going back and
[1:56:38] forth and willing through the aisles and
[1:56:39] everything's going good until they come
[1:56:41] up to the cookie
[1:56:43] aisle and that little boy looks at he
[1:56:45] says mom can I have some chocolate chip
[1:56:47] cookies she said I told you you're not
[1:56:49] getting any cookies today sit down down
[1:56:52] and be quiet how many of you Mama's ever
[1:56:55] done that
[1:56:57] yep so they go on and they're going
[1:56:59] through the store well it searching for
[1:57:02] items for the house the it brings them
[1:57:04] back through the cookie aisle one more
[1:57:06] time they come through the cookie aisle
[1:57:08] and he's sitting there and he's thinking
[1:57:10] man I I shouldn't but I got to I
[1:57:12] shouldn't but I got to mom please let me
[1:57:14] have some chocolate chip cookies
[1:57:17] please I told you no cookies now sit
[1:57:21] down and be quiet if I have to tell you
[1:57:25] again how many's heard
[1:57:29] that if I have to tell you again so he's
[1:57:33] sitting there and they're going through
[1:57:34] the store and it's time to get to the
[1:57:36] checkout AIS they get get ready to go up
[1:57:37] to the counter and the mom's going
[1:57:39] through there and what do you think's at
[1:57:41] the checkout
[1:57:43] counter chips a Hoy soft
[1:57:49] batch and he's thinking if I'm ever
[1:57:52] going to get these
[1:57:55] cookies it's now or never if I'm if I'm
[1:57:59] ever going to have a chance to get one
[1:58:01] of these cookies in my mouth it's now or
[1:58:05] never so he stands up in the cart as
[1:58:08] she's getting ready to enter and he
[1:58:09] shouts with his loudest voice in the
[1:58:12] name of Jesus can I have some chocolate
[1:58:14] chip
[1:58:18] cookies he took home 23 bags of
[1:58:21] chocolate chip cookies
[1:58:23] because all the people in the store
[1:58:25] thought it was the cutest
[1:58:30] thing you get what you ask
[1:58:34] for you can ask me for something and I
[1:58:37] can say no you can ask brother Bor for
[1:58:39] something he can say no you can ask your
[1:58:41] mama your daddy you can ask of your kids
[1:58:43] they can say no but you ask of Jesus
[1:58:46] watch for things to start happening
[1:58:49] accept your cookies this morning
[1:58:58] so we look at Daniel here and it tells
[1:59:01] us on the first
[1:59:03] day it says since the first day that you
[1:59:06] set your mind to gain understanding and
[1:59:08] humble yourself before God your words
[1:59:11] were
[1:59:12] heard now that's important to know that
[1:59:14] this wasn't the first time that Daniel
[1:59:15] had ever heard from God it says in
[1:59:17] Daniel
[1:59:18] 923 and Daniel calls upon the Lord and
[1:59:21] and it says as soon as you begin to pray
[1:59:22] the answer was given which I come to
[1:59:24] tell you you're highly
[1:59:27] esteemed So Daniel no doubt had heard
[1:59:29] from the Lord before I hope all of us
[1:59:31] have heard from the Lord before and so
[1:59:35] when we think about this it's important
[1:59:37] to know that every time that you and I
[1:59:40] pray that God gladly hears our
[1:59:46] prayers not only does he gladly hear our
[1:59:49] prayers but at the very instant that our
[1:59:51] word goes before God
[1:59:53] angels are sent before
[1:59:56] us angels are get sent before us to
[2:00:00] start carrying out the ministry you say
[2:00:02] man I don't know about that did we did
[2:00:04] we read our
[2:00:07] scripture there was there was an angel
[2:00:09] there was a spiritual battle that began
[2:00:10] to take place as soon as Daniel word
[2:00:14] made it to the throne of
[2:00:17] God so from the very first day Daniel
[2:00:19] Prayed his prayer this angels were begin
[2:00:22] to get sent and we look here and we see
[2:00:25] that this is this is one of those rare
[2:00:27] times that we get to kind of see behind
[2:00:28] the
[2:00:29] curtains you know you some of you I'm
[2:00:31] sure all of us have been to a play at
[2:00:33] some point in time and you go to the
[2:00:35] play and in between the scenes they shut
[2:00:37] the curtains right and you don't know
[2:00:40] what's going on but in the background
[2:00:42] they're moving chairs they're moving the
[2:00:43] drums they're moving all this stuff
[2:00:45] they're changing the way the scenes
[2:00:46] happening well this in the Bible right
[2:00:49] here this has given us a little portion
[2:00:51] that we can be see and peek right
[2:00:53] through the
[2:00:54] curtains maybe the curtains hadn't
[2:00:56] completely shut on this scene and so God
[2:00:59] is showing us here what is happening
[2:01:01] behind the scenes that these demonic
[2:01:03] forces are rising up and this Angelic
[2:01:06] Warfare breaks
[2:01:08] out upon the upon the request of
[2:01:11] Daniel's
[2:01:12] prayer do you realize that demonic
[2:01:15] forces break out when you pray to God so
[2:01:19] this means that when you pray you turn
[2:01:21] loose Powers every Power from Heaven is
[2:01:25] turned loose in your
[2:01:29] defense this means that when you pray
[2:01:31] that angels are willing to
[2:01:33] fight for
[2:01:35] you at the word of
[2:01:38] God how many times have we read and
[2:01:41] heard the prophet say that when the when
[2:01:43] Moses and this is coming now when Moses
[2:01:45] was going through that little basket
[2:01:47] basket as a baby through them crocodiles
[2:01:50] and he said there there they set the
[2:01:51] Angel up on the very bow of the
[2:01:55] ship and he said he called wormwood said
[2:01:58] let me go down there he said no this is
[2:02:01] mine this is my
[2:02:04] battle so the angels are give out there
[2:02:06] Hebrews tells us that angels are
[2:02:08] ministering Spirits sent to minister to
[2:02:10] those who are Heirs of
[2:02:13] Salvation how many of us are Heirs of
[2:02:16] Salvation so you think God don't send
[2:02:18] you ministering Angels when you have a
[2:02:20] need in your life
[2:02:22] these angels begin to come and move on
[2:02:24] the scene and here so the angels I want
[2:02:27] you to know that the angels are at your
[2:02:29] back and
[2:02:34] call what kind of people are
[2:02:37] we what kind of people are we yeah that
[2:02:41] God cares so much that he would take
[2:02:43] something from the set and worshiping
[2:02:46] him and idolizing him and praising him
[2:02:49] and say Hey you go down there to brother
[2:02:54] Glenn he's laying up there in that
[2:02:56] hospital he needs something done to his
[2:02:59] blood yes my
[2:03:03] Lord 21
[2:03:06] days and the angel was sent on the first
[2:03:11] day but 21 days
[2:03:13] later the angel
[2:03:19] arrives was God hard to hear
[2:03:23] was he
[2:03:25] unconcerned was he deliberate and and
[2:03:28] holding back for his
[2:03:30] child no but the wickedness of the world
[2:03:35] said we don't want Israel to get what
[2:03:37] they got
[2:03:39] coming we don't want the wickedness of
[2:03:41] the world says we don't want those
[2:03:43] children of
[2:03:45] God to have what God wants them to have
[2:03:48] we don't want them to overcome in this
[2:03:51] hour
[2:03:52] we don't want them to give up cigarettes
[2:03:54] and drinking and
[2:03:56] pornography we don't want them to give
[2:03:58] up the the filthiness around the lives
[2:04:00] that they
[2:04:03] live we don't want them to have their
[2:04:05] children back we don't want them to have
[2:04:08] Financial
[2:04:12] Freedom are you seeing behind the
[2:04:14] curtains
[2:04:15] now so now these angels are going in
[2:04:17] there and they're getting in there and
[2:04:19] so God begins to listen he hear hears
[2:04:21] your word and as soon as you're praying
[2:04:24] for somebody maybe as somebody you want
[2:04:27] to become a
[2:04:28] Christian maybe it's somebody in your
[2:04:30] family that's that's got away from God I
[2:04:32] want you to know that every prayer you
[2:04:34] pray puts more and more and more
[2:04:37] pressure for that person to listen to
[2:04:44] God let me tell you what the difference
[2:04:47] is the difference is this
[2:04:52] you see you have somebody in your life a
[2:04:53] family member a friend you want them to
[2:04:55] come to the Lord and you begin to
[2:04:58] pressure you begin to talk to them you
[2:05:01] begin to get down there and well if you
[2:05:03] don't do this I tell you what time's at
[2:05:06] hand I tell you what we're getting close
[2:05:08] you better be
[2:05:09] ready you just watch them turn and walk
[2:05:13] away that's not going to work I said
[2:05:16] that's not going to work but if you'll
[2:05:18] take and get down on your hands and
[2:05:20] knees before God
[2:05:22] and say God this is my child you gave me
[2:05:26] this child you gave me this loved one
[2:05:29] I'll come before you now and I ask that
[2:05:31] you send ministering spirits to them
[2:05:34] that you would work on their lives that
[2:05:36] you would change their hearts that you
[2:05:38] would change their desires and watch and
[2:05:41] see if that person don't gradually begin
[2:05:44] to ease into church and he's a little
[2:05:46] closer into church and before you know
[2:05:48] it they're sitting on the back row
[2:05:50] before you know it they're on the the
[2:05:51] middle of the church before you know it
[2:05:53] they're shouting and screaming and
[2:05:54] dancing why because God done the
[2:05:57] delivering not you not me but
[2:06:00] [Applause]
[2:06:06] God every prayer we
[2:06:11] pray sends power to
[2:06:17] God I want you to know prayer is not a
[2:06:20] passive Act
[2:06:22] you know passive is setting back and
[2:06:24] just kind of going with the
[2:06:26] flow that's not what prayer
[2:06:28] is prayer is an aggressive act of
[2:06:33] ministry prayer is you putting your
[2:06:35] shoulder to the
[2:06:37] wheel and say if they don't believe for
[2:06:40] you God I'll believe for them if they
[2:06:42] don't believe they can be healed I'm
[2:06:44] going to believe for
[2:06:45] them if they don't love you Lord I'm
[2:06:48] going to love for you for them
[2:06:52] one man I was reading one illustration
[2:06:55] said they were asking him he was a man
[2:06:57] of prayer and they were asking him about
[2:06:58] his prayer life and he said when I pray
[2:07:01] I
[2:07:03] push I thought what in the world did I
[2:07:05] read that
[2:07:06] wrong but he said when everything seems
[2:07:09] to go wrong I
[2:07:11] push he said whenever everything on the
[2:07:13] job gets me down I push he said when
[2:07:17] people don't react the way I think they
[2:07:18] should I push he said when when money
[2:07:22] looks funny and bills are
[2:07:24] due I
[2:07:26] push he said when I when I want to get
[2:07:29] get at people and get angry at people
[2:07:31] for the way they treat me I push he said
[2:07:35] and when people just don't understand me
[2:07:37] I
[2:07:38] push he said push stands for pray until
[2:07:42] something
[2:07:47] happens let that stick in your mind pray
[2:07:51] until until something
[2:07:54] happens don't settle for the situation
[2:07:57] don't settle for being a temper ridden
[2:07:59] person don't settle for that but pray
[2:08:02] until God moves on the
[2:08:08] scene we had a situation yesterday and I
[2:08:11] I I shouldn't probably bring this up but
[2:08:13] I'm going to we had a situation on the
[2:08:16] golf course
[2:08:19] yesterday some of these younger kids
[2:08:21] that can hit at a
[2:08:23] mile didn't see the people in front of
[2:08:25] us they hit their golf balls into these
[2:08:29] people we were in a tournament so lo and
[2:08:32] behold Here Comes this guy barreling
[2:08:34] back at us on a golf cart and he's about
[2:08:37] as red as I don't know
[2:08:40] what he got thankfully thank the Lord he
[2:08:44] went to the cart the other people that
[2:08:46] was with
[2:08:47] me and he's over there and he's waving
[2:08:50] and he's cussing and he's he's mad and
[2:08:52] he's and I thought to myself I thought
[2:08:54] what would I have done if he'd come to
[2:08:55] me and I thought I would have just said
[2:08:57] sorry buddy I we didn't see
[2:09:00] you and I thought Lord thank you for
[2:09:03] giving me that kind of
[2:09:06] attitude because it would have been easy
[2:09:08] to say you don't talk to me that way I'm
[2:09:11] gonna shut your
[2:09:17] mouth we're human right they don't give
[2:09:20] us an
[2:09:22] excuse but I'm glad that I was able to
[2:09:24] think ahead and think what would I have
[2:09:26] done and then put myself in that
[2:09:29] situation because I can tell you that
[2:09:31] when you pray and you pray for your day
[2:09:33] to go right and you pray that you have
[2:09:35] the right

[2:15:23] was picking my teeth up going home with
[2:15:26] black
[2:15:28] eyes I may not consider myself much of a
[2:15:32] boxer and that's the way it is with
[2:15:34] these people that call themselves

[2:16:36] defeated why do we fear when we have the
[2:16:40] power of An Almighty God that hears
[2:16:42] every word we

[2:16:49] you this morning that there is a day if

[2:16:55] day there was a day when you got to
[2:16:57] declare to Satan today's the last day
[2:16:59] you pushed me
[2:17:01] anymore that was your day of Declaration
[2:17:03] that you started a
[2:17:05] battle let me tell you you won't plague
[2:17:07] me no more Satan and you're going to
[2:17:10] fight that
[2:17:11] battle and you're going to fight that
[2:17:13] battle over and over and
[2:17:16] over but there's going to come a day
[2:17:18] when you say
[2:17:21] that trouble that I used to have that
[2:17:23] once plagued
[2:17:25] me I have no trouble at
[2:17:28] all because God has Set Me
[2:17:32] Free and God I have the
[2:17:36] victory today is my V day we need a V
[2:17:42] Day Moses had to have a V Day Moses come
[2:17:45] up to the Red Sea Pharaoh all about him
[2:17:47] a half a million troubles are surrounded
[2:17:50] him yeah
[2:17:51] but he went to God and the word says the
[2:17:53] prophet said he focused his eyes on God
[2:17:56] he wasn't focused in looking at a half a
[2:17:59] million troubles around him he was
[2:18:01] focused on the victory on the other side
[2:18:04] that's how Miriam picked up that
[2:18:07] tambourine and she began to wave and she
[2:18:09] began to dance and she be to shout why
[2:18:12] because they had
[2:18:15] Victory Joshua come into a place he come
[2:18:18] up to that River we've been preaching on
[2:18:19] these things for the last year here
[2:18:21] Joshua come up to that River and the
[2:18:23] prophet said he come right there and he
[2:18:25] looked there he seen them walls but he
[2:18:27] didn't focus on those
[2:18:29] walls he didn't look at how tall they
[2:18:32] was he didn't look at how wide they
[2:18:34] was he looked on the other side and see
[2:18:37] crumbled ruins of a fallen enemy yeah
[2:18:42] quit looking around your surroundings
[2:18:44] and all your problems and start looking
[2:18:47] to the one who solves your problems
[2:18:53] the prophet said God lets
[2:18:54] disappointments
[2:18:57] happen
[2:18:59] why to show your
[2:19:04] Victory now he ain't talking to that
[2:19:06] halfway
[2:19:07] guy no that's not who he's talking
[2:19:10] to he's talking to that dedicated prayer
[2:19:13] Warrior the one who knows what it's like
[2:19:15] to talk to God lip to ear and hear and
[2:19:18] he hears you and answers back and begins
[2:19:20] to send those
[2:19:21] those ministering Angels down that's the
[2:19:23] one he's talking to he lets those
[2:19:25] disappointments happen to show your
[2:19:30] Victory we think about
[2:19:33] job we think about Job in the
[2:19:38] Bible man you talking about a
[2:19:41] test you talking about a
[2:19:43] trial you talking about somebody that no
[2:19:45] doubt was doing some
[2:19:47] praying Satan said let me have
[2:19:52] job let me have
[2:19:55] him he's a perfect
[2:19:58] servant let me have
[2:20:00] him oh you can do anything you want to
[2:20:03] to
[2:20:04] him I talk to him all the time I know
[2:20:06] where he
[2:20:08] stands you know sometimes I wonder if
[2:20:10] God knows where we stand because if we
[2:20:12] even talk to
[2:20:15] him but I know where job stands you can
[2:20:18] do anything you want to him you poke and
[2:20:21] you PR and you make him sick you do
[2:20:23] everything but the one thing you can't
[2:20:25] do is take his
[2:20:28] life do you think job sat there and
[2:20:31] cried over his
[2:20:33] bulls do you think job sat there and
[2:20:35] said man look at this I got these balls
[2:20:38] all over me I can't I can't stand a look
[2:20:40] at this look at all these bulls look at
[2:20:42] all my possessions leaving look at all
[2:20:44] my cattle look at all my sheep and all
[2:20:46] my goats and all of my possessions look
[2:20:48] at all of that he never even once looked
[2:20:50] looked at
[2:20:51] that he didn't he didn't look and focus
[2:20:54] on what was going around but he looked
[2:20:56] and he set his eyes and he focused on a
[2:20:58] god of
[2:21:00] restoration it wasn't about what was
[2:21:02] happening at that time it was about what
[2:21:04] God was going to give back to
[2:21:09] [Music]
[2:21:10] him God is
[2:21:15] good I'm trying to close up here he says
[2:21:18] that's what the devil is so after us us
[2:21:20] about you want to know why the devil SE
[2:21:22] after us here I'm fixing to tell you he

[2:22:43] 1944 and he tells the account when the
[2:22:46] ship pulled up and the gate let down and
[2:22:48] he had to step out well he fell he fell
[2:22:52] off the ramp and he fell off the ramp of
[2:22:55] that landing craft and he went into an
[2:22:57] underwater shell hole and he went under
[2:23:00] this hole and he said I nearly went
[2:23:02] under he said I was loaded with all this
[2:23:03] equipment and hand grenades in my
[2:23:06] pockets and magazines in my pouches and
[2:23:08] everything else I could
[2:23:13] carry sometimes we we got all this
[2:23:18] ammunition and we got the grenad ad with
[2:23:20] the devil's name on it we got M we got
[2:23:24] bullets that say Satan and enemy and
[2:23:27] hate and envy we got all the ammunition
[2:23:30] we need to take it out but we slip and
[2:23:33] fall and he said I thought I was gone he
[2:23:37] said I thought I was going down he said
[2:23:39] the sea around him was red with
[2:23:42] blood he said it was quite a
[2:23:45] mess but I just had to keep going
[2:23:54] I think about this
[2:23:56] war they tried to recreate a scene in
[2:23:58] the movie Saving Private Ry and they
[2:24:01] show just a small portion of the
[2:24:05] beach and just in order to try to
[2:24:07] portray it as accurate as possible they
[2:24:10] put over
[2:24:11] 2,200 gallons of artificial blood into
[2:24:14] the
[2:24:17] sea it's a
[2:24:19] mess war is a
[2:24:22] mess battle is a
[2:24:27] mess can you imagine 50 miles of that
[2:24:30] beach
[2:24:32] front covered in
[2:24:34] blood and he said I just kept treading
[2:24:36] through it and I managed to surface to
[2:24:39] get to that beach we were under Fire and
[2:24:42] I scrambled up the dunes and and found a
[2:24:44] shell crater to shelter in he said I was
[2:24:47] so
[2:24:48] hungry and this was a first this was
[2:24:50] after the first few
[2:24:52] days he was
[2:24:54] wounded in his leg by shrapnel taken
[2:24:58] prisoner by the Germans nearly all the
[2:25:01] troops in his company were
[2:25:04] dead sometimes we get in those positions
[2:25:06] in those places we fight we battle we we
[2:25:10] get in there we we're fist to fist nose
[2:25:12] to nose with
[2:25:13] Satan sometimes he gets a few licks in
[2:25:16] on
[2:25:16] us sometimes he gets a few punches in
[2:25:19] maybe you might had a bloody nose once a
[2:25:22] black
[2:25:23] eye but he said I just kept saying to
[2:25:27] myself you're going back
[2:25:30] home brothers and sisters we're going
[2:25:33] back
[2:25:34] home we're going back home there's a
[2:25:38] restoration taking place and the Bride
[2:25:41] of Jesus Christ is going back home let's
[2:25:44] stand to our
[2:25:47] feet the musicians would come
[2:25:55] I read that first uh first
[2:25:58] quote brother Brandon was talking about
[2:26:02] keeping your eyes on the innocent
[2:26:04] substitute what made him bring that up
[2:26:07] as he was talking he said here not long
[2:26:08] ago he said I had a pair of field
[2:26:10] glasses he's talking about
[2:26:12] binoculars he said I was trying to watch
[2:26:15] some antalope over in a field or an
[2:26:17] antalope he said he said my son was
[2:26:20] trying to show me and he's quite a bit
[2:26:22] younger so he said take them glasses
[2:26:24] daddy there stands the antalope right
[2:26:27] there and I said I can see it with my
[2:26:29] natural eye he said but take these
[2:26:30] glasses he said when I looked I seen
[2:26:33] about 10
[2:26:35] antelopes he said but the glasses was
[2:26:38] out of
[2:26:40] focus sometimes we see 10
[2:26:43] problems sometimes we see 10
[2:26:46] obstacles sometimes we see all these
[2:26:49] negative things that's happening around
[2:26:51] our
[2:26:52] lives but he said when I got those
[2:26:54] glasses and he said when I went to focus
[2:26:57] on in there was
[2:27:00] one no matter how many problems you see
[2:27:03] through your natural eyes if we could
[2:27:05] just focus in on the one who can answer
[2:27:10] the problems the one who can fix the
[2:27:14] problems you love the Lord let's just
[2:27:16] bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank
[2:27:19] you Lord for this day you given us for
[2:27:22] the love you've shown it this morning

[2:27:28] trust others as well and what a what an
[2:27:31] encouragement it was just to just to be
[2:27:33] able to study this and to preach this
[2:27:35] and thank you for it Lord I trust Lord
[2:27:38] that we're able to take these words in
[2:27:39] the week to come and know that we are a
[2:27:42] special group of people that when we
[2:27:44] pray before you Lord every single word
[2:27:47] every breath we utter makes it to your
