how many knows that singing and worship it just gets you in the atmosphere and softening your heart real up real good and when the word comes down into that soft ground it'll take root so amen i was trying to think uh what to say about brother ted because we know he's a great man and we could call him the legendary brother ted or whatever but anything good amen we just really appreciate him man so we've been it's a great honor to have him tonight we just want him to take his liberty amen and so praise god how many will pull from the gift how many will not sleep on him amen amen stay awake and just really pull from the gift of god because i'm pretty sure he's ready to amen let the lord have his way and speak through him so let's sing amazing grace as our brother ted comes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] sing the rest of that later it's a bit good to be in the house of the lord god bless you open your bibles i'm on to read the scripture and get right going here i do uh thank brother thomas for inviting me i actually i don't invite myself but i do call ahead sometimes so i think that's okay people do that to for us all the time they call say i'm gonna be in the area and uh if you feel led and i believe brother thomas uh even if he didn't feel it he'd invite me anyway but because we just love each other so much i love you all too and i'm happy to be here and thanks for all your hospitality i've been eating some good meals and had some nice times in the woods and uh and some and some good good memories that we've taken back every time we we get together with god's people we have good things to say about it and good things happen amen so we do appreciate the goodness of our lord jesus christ and thank you all believing leaving tomorrow heading back and any whichever one of you touch the lord for my wife i thank you uh if you're praying for her and uh she's feeling better i don't know that everybody's saying well sister bernie coming with i don't know i guess we gotta turn young before that will happen so she doesn't like to travel anymore so and i don't love it anymore but i do it so uh happy to have been here you just it'll be glorious when we can travel like a thought won't it it'll just be easy and it won't cost you three bucks a gallon and uh all that i walked in today i bought some gas and i said boy this cheap gas here in russellville she said that's cheap 309 we're paying almost 360 something up there in arizona california went over top tipped over five dollars a gallon that's crazy world plenty of oil they're trying to shut us down aren't they amen trying to lock us down that's communism no traveling no going there no going there but we're going to go anyway in fact we're going to travel out of this place pretty soon whether they like it or not amen so we thank god for that so in the book of second peter 1 we'll get right going in the scriptures second peter 1 19 we have also a more sure word of prophecy where do where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts these are all beautiful words aren't they and it's but it it's so simple as what happens it's just god makes himself real to you that's what's talking about right now if you agree with me at any point in time during the service i give you 100 permission to say amen and you don't have to say it silently you can say it out loud okay how do you feel about that feel good all right so uh we go on knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost shall we pray father bless your people bless your word act of it in our life tonight help us by faith to make it live father for your word is a living it's a seed it's planted in the right ground watered lord by prayer by faith by praise it must bring forth of its kind and we thank you for it we ask it in jesus name amen you may take your seats make yourself comfortable for about 20 minutes i got one mint in my mouth or i had it i don't know where it went and so uh and then after 20 minutes i hope you'll really be in the spirit you won't have to make yourself come to blah blah ben but uh anyway uh we don't have to make disclaimers we just you know preachers do get carried away sometimes so don't don't make me get carried away okay be real quiet just sit there and just kind of snooze a little bit and then i won't get carried away but if you want to get something out of the service don't do that don't do that but then if you get to saying amen brother thomas don't do that because uh because i'm here this my last time here and i'm gonna i'm gonna make it my best day here although sunday i don't know how it could be topped what we had sunday service over there in russellville it was a beautiful service so we had a great time anytime the holy spirit comes down it's a great time and we thank god for that we don't have to uh uh bring him down he's already here we just have to bring ourself down where we can recognize what he wants to do in our life amen humble ourself in the sight of god and he'll lift us up right amen so we thank god for his mercy so more sure word of prophecy i've been looking at this and thinking about it that you know what could be more sure than god's word it's not that it's any different but what it is it's changing from a dormant prophecy into an active prophecy so we're talking about the power of active prophecy and what happens is every word of god will come to pass but when it comes to pass is no longer just laying there it is actually working its magic its wonders its power its beauty its glory and and actually that's what a christian is is what we were before it was dormant in us but what we are now it's active in us and that same lord jesus christ that was born in us when we were born there was a gift born in you every one of you brother brian and every one of you brother austin everyone every single one of us brother caleb everyone had a gift laying in them when we were born and god put that in there and it was a promise of something good to unfold in our life and listen to me if you're alive tonight and how many are then god watched over you to turn that promise that he laid in you when you were born into active prophecy and there's where the power is and that's why there's churches that are powerless people that are powerless preachers that are powerless because they're looking for something to come when they don't have the faith to make it live now god sent us a prophet to show us that you can take god's word and make it live right now in fact the bible says now faith is the substance not future faith not past faith but now faith amen am i doing all right well don't get me started now please for a prophecy came not in the old time by the will of man it's god's will that he placed something within us listen you're the reason you're alive tonight is because it's god's will you wouldn't be here if it wasn't god's will you wouldn't be here not chasing personalities you're not chasing legends you're not chasing a good man all those words don't apply to me i don't know who he was talking about must've been my twin brother but i'm telling you what listen i haven't got good yet but i'm getting better all the time so we're going to get there one of these days amen one of these days i'm going to hear him say it was well done you good and faithful servant that's when i'll know i got there amen bless it be the name of the lord until then we just keep pressing on with the help of the lord changing what's laying dormant inside of us into active prophecy that becomes power amen i believe that don't you so we thank god for that so we know prophecy from the holy spirit it's always been the spirit the spirit of god wrote the bible men just penned it spirit of god wrote the bible that's why people say i can't trust the bible because men wrote that well they just you god just used their hands in their quill but it was the holy spirit that wrote the word is that true same with the message amen praise the name of the lord like somebody was talking to brother branham said i disagree with you when you're talking about what baptism in the name lord jesus christ he said brother and william branham i like you but that's just one man's opinion brother branham said yeah but that one man is god or himself so if it's almighty god's opinion you can be sure it's going to come to pass blessed be the name of the lord am i going too fast too slow just right well boy that's the first time in my whole life i've ever done that so we thank the lord so great things are happening right here in kentucky amen until we thank god for that so see prophecy is god's foreknowledge of events and then he lays it into people he lays it into nations he lays it into kings he lays it into situations and he lays all that prophecy there waiting for the time when the actual person that that's describing is uh on the scene and then when that person is on the scene that person has the ability right sister johnny that person have the ability to turn that that what laid there waiting waiting waiting waiting to have the power within them to believe god to where they turn that into an act of prophecy then it becomes powerful just like you lay there sick god gave you a promise of healing that that'll just lay there until you activate it by believing when you believe when you're sick the bible said call the elders of the church ain't gotten the elders call the youngers call somebody that got the holy ghost in them to pray over you prayer of faith we'll pray will he will save the sick and god will raise him up and all of a sudden you can say praise the lord i once was sick but that prophecy that god gave me is not dormant anymore amen dormant prophecy cannot bring joy it cannot bring victory dormant prophecy can only be spoken it cannot be lived it has to be lived when it's activated when activated it lives itself it's not you living the christian life it's god's word living the christian life in you amen thank god for that so we see that see the spoken word actually steers and controls everything that's going on prophecy controls everything that's going on the earth today everything in the earth that's happening everything in america that's happening listen the pope is a dormant prophecy coming to active now our president this communist movement in our country is a dormant prophecy coming active prophet of god said it'll come back and it'll come right into this country he said it it'll have to happen just like he said it amen pressure will come on squeeze on it's dormant now it's happening oh my brother that's why peter said we have a more sure word of prophecy what does that mean it's an active prophecy this isn't just something that can be disputed now it's out there showing itself anybody that has eyes can see it now amen so we thank the lord praise the name of the lord jesus christ just like on the day of pentecost they were waiting and it was a dormant prophecy and jesus said go up there in the upper room and said when that happens now then when it happened it turned from dormant active and actually brother they couldn't hold themselves in the upper room anymore jesus never did say come down out of the peru jesus never told him to come down out of the upper room he said go up into the upper room the knowing that in the laying in that prophecy they were supposed to be hiding in that upper room forever but they were waiting for that thing to become active in it when it became active you know a lot of people say oh well just do say what the prophet said but every word he said has an active prophecy within that which is lay dormant for years and when it actually springs to life it's a lot different than the way people interpret it that's why the prophet said don't interpret nothing don't put a period on any promise of god just let god have his way and bring it to pass blessed be the name of the lord we all have a different opinion about how the rapture is gonna be how the resurrection is gonna happen how many days we'll be here where we'll get together what we'll say what we'll do all these different things what will be eaten at the wooden supper all these different questions but now that when it comes to pass all those opinions pass away it'll be different than what any of us thought amen blessed be the name of the lord praise the lord of the lord say brother ted you're excited no i'm an act of prophecy so are you my brother we're active prophecies tonight blessed be the name let's get up and go then amen let me let me get done i'll let you go you go out and live your prophecy amen thanks be to god so we thank the lord for them so it become upon them to empower them see they couldn't even preach while they had government prophecy says yo jesus said go up in the upper room wait for it to happen but until it happened until that prophecy became active they couldn't even preach that's why a lot of times preachers you know they're just it's a male ticket for them or something they might be well educated they can quote quotes and they can say things but rather it can't be active prophecy unless they got the holy ghost the holy ghost got to come down and burn out the sin out of our life how many love the lord tonight the prophecy was transitioning they couldn't preach they're in the upper room they couldn't come down jesus never did say come down he said go up there and wait oh my brother but when it became active they came down rather when it becomes active you do things you never thought you could do amen and rather it'll give you power to where nobody can stop you from it either you're going to press the way no devil can stop you no discouragement no depression no sickness no nothing can stop you say well i know people are sick and they're leading up so yeah but i'll tell you what i know the same people who led the nurse and the doctor to jesus christ i know the ones that stood there singing and laying in there in the midst of their suffering they had to grace the same faces to god created an atmosphere and somebody in the next room jumped up and was healed i'm telling you what you can't stop the promise of god who what was in that mint you pointed me to my brother david he offered me a 20-minute mint and i'm telling you what it's really working i got about 12 minutes left thank the lord dormant prophecy could not empower them neither it can it us but brother it's dormant in us our faith changes it our faith without faith it's impossible to please god well i studied and studied and studied but do you believe oh yeah i believe brother brandon said you can say that but sit down in here you don't he said not this man it's not this man it's this man and when you have this man has it this man can say it that man can know it then it's active because it comes from here amen thank the lord for that see i lived almost 70 years to learn this i'm going to tell you everything i know this is it that i come to the place now to where a life that's playing dormant doing nothing a so-called legend a so-called good man it turns different when it becomes active in him it's no longer just a story it's no longer just a fable it's a living reality amen my brother i never do that too much make a noise like that but i just did i think something's happening i'm out i just came back from africa and i'll tell you what i turned african dancing i shattered now and i jumped and everything in the preaching and they said all right now it's time for the living legend to come up and speak and i didn't have to hardly preach i preached about five minutes the presence of the lord came down i said brother brown said he walked into places he said where people were expecting god to move he said they were so expectant he said that before he ever came out to the platform every sick one in there out of hundreds of and thousands and thousands of people every sick person in there was healed already just because they were under such expectation of turning a prophecy from dormant into active prophecy then brother ben said i've seen it happen many times i could show you the quote and brother branham said if we could come into that same level of expectation we could see the same things happening god would be duty-bound to see that happen for us amen blessed be the name of the lord who's we that's me brother that's you we are the ones do you believe that amen like john you know he couldn't just read the book he couldn't just study the book he had to make that book active so he had to eat the book same with this message until you eat this message talk about it discuss it have divorce you can have all seminars you can learn it at bible school learn everything about this message have a good bible teacher teach you the message i teach you the word teach you the scriptures amen but until you eat it do you drink drink it till you draw it into the inside of you when it becomes active in you everything you thought you knew you don't know anymore but it's just living in you now amen you don't go around saying i i know better than you do i'm just discussing arguing and everything else you don't do that anymore just for humble simple active prophecy walking around on two feet and if you only have one foot you're walking around on one foot in a crutch active prophecy on wheels going around the wheelchair active prophecy amen you're going to have battle scars we're going to have little wounded places hands missing maybe an igon or something after the battle but the act of prophecy everybody say oh the war the fighting the wars glorious the greatness if somebody come out of the out of the out of the battle come out of the battle all battle scarred not maybe outside but inside traumatized and ptsd and all this they never knew anything about back in my but i'm telling you trauma and and and destruction to the spirit of man but i'm telling you what god rich in mercy that battle scarred veteran comes out there and say i was there i know what it was like amen tell you what we're not going to get we're not going to cut our hand on a sardine can and be commended for being a grave soldier we're going to be the ones have been in the heat of battle that i was there amen blessed be the name of the lord like like you've heard it said many times it just pops mine i have to say it you know everybody's going to be commending the ones who went through the martyrdom and stuff when they get on the other side sir how did you do it you went through the martyrdom everything else was grace god just kept and then the ones down through the dark ages and the ones down through all the ages and the persecution and the late as lately those who lived under the communist regime over there in the extermination and the genocides over there in china and all through the cambodia of a recent and all those different ones who who suffered and went through and then when we arrived they're going to say what age did you come out of we're going to say laodicea they're going to say oh my everybody come here come here come here this brother this brother made it through laodicea how did you do it brother grace of god grace from god because we had a promise we had a prophecy given to us and by grace it turned active in us and that's what keeps us going i always sing the song you know it's a holy ghost and fire they're keeping me alive and i turn i put another verse to it it's the message of the hour and it's keeping me alive it's the prophecy that's keeping me going amen amen hallelujah we've got gospels you read the bible you get gospels that's the best meds you can get now we got profit pills amen absolutely right prophesied the life of god into us amen thank the lord and we appreciate god for his mercy amen the message is right now transitioning in you the third pull that the prophet said in perfect faith is in him is now in us he gave us a perfect faith message how many are in a message how many are doubting don't lie to me we all doubt we all doubt but i see you've got to doubt your doubts i'm going to tell you tonight be active doubt your doubts actively doubt you're down so ted you're lying to yourself ted you're fooling yourself preach yourself bible says speak to yourself in psalms hymns spiritual songs you might look crazy to everybody else talking to yourself all the time but you're giving yourself a good little whooping give yourself a good little whooping keep yourself honest keep yourself true because listen god's prophecy can't fail it won't fail amen i believe that don't you we thank the lord just having faith well faith how can i have faith faith is so simple brother ben always taught us it's so simple once you get it you don't even know you have it but it's just something that works in you right amen so here's what brother madam said he said when the word has been spoken for a certain generation this is what shall i do jesus calling christ he said god is going to rise somebody on the scene who's going to fulfill that word now are we talking about another prophet coming or something with another message no sir that was never spoken but brother what are we talking about people who believe that prophet the shaped and created through that mouth of that ministry amen and that when it comes he said and that is the vindication of the prophecy he said as jesus met every qualification so will there be people today who meet that qualification my brother my sister you meet that qualification amen blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah brother babs said don't get scared in the days of noah he said god had an ark that typed christ and he said in arkan 55 he said don't get scared he said god is driving the winds you say all the winds are horrible god's driving them don't get scared god is driving the winds do you believe that god is driving the winds amen god is driving the ark he has all things provided i know you're trying to keep me short so but if you want to say amen you can get one more word out of me i'm going to shut down here soon the space i'm going i can't hold it up very long only about four hours so amen because i'm turning younger by the second now you don't want me to get too young i'll tell you that so not on a wednesday night let's do that on a weekend meeting blessed be the name of the lord listen to this now he said you think look at you if noah would have not had any victories he said if there wouldn't have been storms and trials he said if we're just putting a little safe tunnel and we just run through safe and he said there's no joy he said the storms of life is what makes us have joy how joyful are you how many storms have you got it's depending on how many storms you're going through is how much joy you can have how many can anybody here want to say i can have a lot of joy brother i guess i'm the only one who say that i can have a lot of joy been through a lot of storms we never know what daylight is unless we've had some dark he said you're never gonna know good health unless you've had some sickness you never know how to enjoy salvation unless you was once a sinner if you're not enjoying your salvation now maybe you never did repent maybe you never did get converted maybe you just joined church maybe you just got baptized maybe some good preacher blessed you and gave you gave you his blessing but that that doesn't joy only comes when you know what you were now you know what you are amen and it's activated what was in you is you were born to be that you were born to be a christian amen you were born with that prophecy in you how many believe that that's so true look at simeon when he held jesus he said my been waiting for the consolation of israel been waiting for all those promises of prophets had spoken for hundreds hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years and simeon had been praying and said lord oh man lord when is that going to come when is hard is that when is that consolation of israel going to come thank god for some old old prayer warriors around the church amen i tell you what you young people need to learn how to do that too you need to learn how to do that too you say well what makes a what makes a young person a good old a good old prayer warrior getting old does that going through life getting beaten or beat around and all the ego built beat out of you and trials and tests amen put you on your knees and that's when god did you get the quote of the day from lifeline i'm telling you what trials was given to draw you closer to god and to make you have a deeper experience with god and you say amen instead of blaming god for situations and getting all victimized you're all victimized and everybody's going to get back i tell you what i'll tell you what you humble yourself and give your heart to christ completely and surrender and let god activate his prophecy god will get back at the devil through you amen you'll beat the devil down on a daily basis hey man you'll box his ears something fierce hey amen amen and there's 200 million of them so you better you know start doing that now brother because you're going to beat the whole horns of hell you better start right now i want to get active don't you i don't want to lay around i never did want to lay around i want to get active in the service of the lord i want to be a good soldier i want i want to go to active duty i want to i want to fight for the kingdom i want to fight the good fight of faith amen blessed be the name oh i'm tired of sitting around and you know just mumbling rumbling and saying all the things look at joshua and caleb they didn't mumble and grumble they didn't mumble and grumble well that that went over there seeing them seen those big guys too but listen they said they said hey wait a minute what i just heard you said you uh you said you went over the promised land too i went there too you said i seen giants over there and brother and joshua and then caleb said and joshua said giants giants what giants we didn't see no giants we seen grasshoppers over there absolutely amen oh blessed be the name of caleb did you see any giants i didn't see no giants there was no giants there there was plenty of grasshoppers but we're more than a metro or maybe we'll march in there and take them over do you love the lord that's when prophecy changes from dormant to active so if you're not living victorious you've got to prophecy dormant still in your life you still got it dormant is there a piece of kleenex here somewhere i didn't bring anything i didn't think i'd get so oh yes sir amen just give me the whole box somebody might get me going here not my plan but that that meant been gone a long time so we're talking about that's what makes joy see the voice of god when god called abram you know it was down in er how many ever heard about all the great things abram did he was the seed of god down in her right he was a royal seed he was the seed of god he was the man the father of faith while he was down in earth he was but it was dormant in him it was dormant in him you know did god make a mistake when he came to abraham he came to the right guy he came to the one who that that promise was in and he called him did and did did he make a mistake when he called abraham no don't get me started get me started please say that now i'm getting nervous and then we find out that did he make a mistake when he came to you did god make the mistakes that come to the wrong person or no prophecy laying in him god didn't make a mistake god knows there's something laying in you dormant fair and you have to turn it into active prophecy i believe that by believing it that's true arrows are in er how many read all the great things that abram did when he was down in er in the bible i didn't i didn't see it there because it was dormant it was laying in him but once it started activating then you saw it then it could be described then it could be written amen oh god wrote our name in lamb's book of life he wasn't talking about dormant prophecy he was talking about active life in us he was what he was seeing what we were doing he saw what you were doing that you would repent and that's how he wrote your name the lamb's book of life said the pre-day wrote and predestinated you to come in because he saw you saying lord i want to be on your side oh i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired i'm sick and tired of being a sinner i'm sitting there tired of laying around selfish i want to live for you amen he said here i am when you said that didn't take him long to get there did it god will come down instantaneously even on a wednesday night he'll come down instantaneous and help you to turn your dormant prophecy into active prophecy do you love the lord tonight amen praise the name of the lord even job you know going through the testing how many did you ever write in the bible all the great things that job did before the trap the trial and test all you see is he was a perfect man just man perfect man but where's all the great things he did where's all the people's lives he changed where the touch and everything and people come from aisles around to hear about from jokes you don't read that in there because it's laying dormant in his life but brother when the trouble came and the hell of you came down watching over him amen god is sitting right next to you listen elihu was dormant laying dormant elihu was sitting there watching job in the midst of his trial sometimes god will sit right there but listen if the right man is sitting by you he's holding on to your hand he's keeping you amen god was keeping job he was sitting right there he was sitting right there thinking oh lord give me grace give me grace give him grace in grace it was jesus by the man who said the elohim was jesus the lord himself is me his name means the lord himself just like in the scripture in first thessalonians 4 13 13-16 said the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout this message his helium the lord himself the mighty god come down how many believe that and he sits there because you're dormant waiting for you to act upon your promise and then he begins to activate it did you notice job never did have the total restoration until elihu began to talk and then the pillar fired new whirlwind came down god said job all right you're not a baby no more stand up like a man gird your loins up i'm going to give you some adoption here i'm going to give you some real meat for your soul now amen how many love the lord tonight amen see god was identifying himself with job he was staking his reputation on job god said if job fails then i have failed but god knew that he couldn't fail neither could job fail amen if job curses me that i have failed my job i have made a false prophecy but job never cursed god amen he cursed his birthday he you know he cursed all the pain but rather he never cursed god never cursed his wife amen amen didn't curse his his uh wow watch out when you get one of these tablets you don't even have to touch it and it starts growing i think my dormant tablet is coming active here now whoo man just got to do the right thing so i'm winding down with a couple of little thoughts i've got this too i don't like even here i hear myself breathing i can even hear my heart beat here getting active now that's pretty sick the sound in heart but that's the best i can do amen you know brother ben said oneness with god is having god's spirit in you agreeing with the word oh we all want to be one with god brother when he preached that message that's we we always hear that at least once a year all of us message please i'm sure that message once oneness with god more often would be better but and then he said oneness with god is having god's spirit in you agreeing with the word correct me if i'm wrong but he said agreeing with the word all the word the whole word okay you say well praise the lord i do that ain't done enough yet it's still dormant watch and to make it manifested in power you've got to turn it active again you've got to turn it active brother jesus said uh very very i say unto you in john 14 12 the words that i do you do also and greater than this you you do prophet of god said in the message that day on calvary said greater works he said was to have the power in the church how many believe that we have a church that has that power have a power in that church not only to heal the sick by prayer right not only anybody ever been healed by sick but by prayer in the church here so say amen not only to heal the sick by prayer not only to cast out devils by prayer he said but he said to impart eternal life to believers by telling them about the holy ghost and when they reach the holy ghost they have eternal life because that's the greater works that the church has amen and amen to impart eternal life you can change somebody's life oh it to be we could change our own children but sometimes god will let you have more effect outside because a prophet's not without honor except in his own house among his own people amen but someday they'll see it someday they'll see it blessed be the name of the lord just keep it active keep it humble always got to be in humility never enforced you can't force an amnesiac to remember who they are the minute you try to force them they go into trauma sometimes they they go into complete bewilderment sometimes they even take their life as a result as a result of being forced you know somebody who's forgot who they were by a blow on the head you nobody can be cured by force brother they have those people has got to be cured by just little by little seeing something that brings them back seeing something that they remember isn't it true this is a little something to say rings true to them and makes them reminds them of home or maybe smelling a smell that reminds my mama and her cooking the dumplings on the on the cook on the cook stove in the boil boiling there or whatever it was and they takes them back oh my no no i'm remembering i'm remembering what i was born for what a who i am amen and it's coming to us little by little but force will never we can't start using force now right brother thomas you know it's always been grace it's always been grace grace is great that grace that taught my heart to fear it's grace that keeps helping me it's grace that takes away my fears amen goes on all the way until a rapturing grace changes me and i go home amen but it's all it's all prophecy turning active little by little in our life amen means that's true i agree it's right and so forth like that so i hope i hope don't say brother ted come to us on a wednesday night preach real powerful buddy it wasn't any of it any good i hope you don't say that like you say at least one word of it was good when he said i'm closing and he kept his promise that was the best part i've been doing that lately i'm going to surprise you people i say it and then i do it i surprised myself i did it one time this might be number two and i'm on a roll look at the look at the widow woman in the days of life in elijah she turned her prophecy that god had sent elijah down there and said i've commanded a widow woman down there this one this woman was commanded to to break bread with elijah and housing because the brook dried up and and ravens wasn't beating him anymore so he had to go down there amen ravens couldn't find no sandwiches or anything nowhere nothing they couldn't steal or bring down to uh amen amen so there was nothing for him so god said i'll talk about take care of you my son there was prophecy unfolding elijah nothing couldn't kill him isn't that true nothing can't kill you amen because there's prophecy unfolding there blessed be the name of the lord nothing to stop you no depression listen depression you saw you preaching because you don't know anything about depression i become one one time try preaching sometime i'll tell you what you got depressed all the time biggest depression is how when you when you see yourself and you preach yourself under conviction every time that wow i'm not even living up to that whatever you know but god can anoint you to say something but become active in somebody else but brother i want it active inside of this guy right here this man right here there's a there's a prophecy laying inside of here too even if it has to be that uh that i'll wake up to my own preaching sometime i hear someone else say the very same thing that i was saying let's see man that's the truth and i believed it all the time but it was laying there dormant but i want to see god activate it don't you and i have to do it but i have to make it happen by believing look at the widow woman when he came to her and he said i commanded that woman brother listen sister you've been commanded to go in a rapture you've been commanded by almighty god that you're going to make it through you've been commanded you're going to overcome devils are going to fall down in front of you amen you've been commanded to stay true to the end blessed be the name of the lord whether you know it or not you are under divine commandment and mandate you've been chosen and you've got a prophecy in you but you have to bring it out into power in your life amen so she did by obeying and then the prophet said okay said what are you doing said i'm out here picking up sticks you see i got two sticks here and i got back home i got a empty barrel i took out the last little scoop of it of the meal and said i got a spoonful of oil said i'm gonna make me one little uh biscuit and i'm gonna i'm gonna uh i'm gonna take that thing and i'm gonna i'm gonna get break in half i'm gonna give half to my son and myself and we're gonna eat it and we're gonna die and here the prophet says well thus saith the lord make me one first then amen and inside that prophecy was laying three years of it's brother three years of this laying inside that one simple word because when he said first there's got to be a second there's got to be a continuation amen my brother thanks me to god the woman of the blood issue turned her prophecy you know and they said that he he's got healing in his wings and all she could keep her eyes on was the i think i preached this here before didn't i brother thomas but i preached this to different places that i love these stories about turning the scripture into active power in our life and she a promise was laying there there's healing in his wings and so she's got her eyes on the hems of his garment well got her eyes on the hems of his garment jordan look at his face she wasn't sizing him up saying well does he look like a prophet does he walk like a prophet all she had her eyes on because the scripture prophecy was laying in here she could just touch the hem of his garment if she could just touch the hand of his garment she was going to be all right no more doctor no more meds no more of this number nothing just he was going to be all right amen rather than she turned that prophecy into active prophecy brother and it was living in her and it drew the virtue out of the lord jesus christ you were born to have virtue you were born the people draw sometimes they'll draw so hard you ain't got nothing left but you were born to get a refilling you were born to get a recharging you were born to know how listen if you buy one of these electric cars you got nowhere to plug it in brother you're coming to christ god has a little station space places for you to plug in amen bless it be the name of the lord hallelujah thanks be to god for his love and mercy now at this rate i'm going to be done before some of you even get in on it so don't miss out please amen the blind man let's sit in there then he's born blind you know brother ben said time and sight it's a worse two enemies to divine healing because the longer it goes the harder it is for you to believe harder it is for you to believe that it's god's will to heal you the longer you've been sick and then sight what you see i don't see no change well for one day two days three days anybody can hold out three days five days seven days nine days a little bit tougher five years 10 years 12 years a little bit harder but look at abraham held out 25 years could see nothing but all he was looking at was the promise he was not considering his own body neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb wasn't considering that was impossible all he was saying was oh praise the lord sarah it's going to be more of a miracle when it does happen amen you talk about prophecy coming active brother amen that's exactly true so that blind man with no eyes he's sitting there jesus outside of david and jesus came by and jesus stood there and he's spitting on the ground he's picking up his eyeballs because the dirt that was supposed to be in his eye sockets never came in he'd missed the carrots or whatever was growing there that he didn't get in a womb but god in the disciples even asked jesus why was this man born right who sinned and jesus said this is the sin issue this was done this this man was born without eye because he didn't eat the carrots it was going to put the put the put the uh minerals in his body that was gonna make his eyeballs and in the womb god kept his eyeballs out of the baby he was born without eyes and brother instead was born without eyes just empty sockets and here he was but thank god god had led him to be sitting begging at the very spot where the dirt was that was supposed to make up his eyeballs rather when we come in the resurrection if you relate part of you is laying over there over yonder somewhere else brother god will bring it all together and make uh make you in the resurrection how many believe that can't take you down brother god has given you a prophecy inside of you amen and so his eyeballs jesus made him up with him in his hand brother jesus make up your miracle right in his hand right now he's a master chef he's a master craftsman he just takes his hand he takes what coming out of his mouth he was spitting on the ground what comes out of the mouth out of his mouth comes the word of god out of the word come the word and the word made the eyeballs and he put him in there and he said now you go and wash and he goes down there and washing guess what the first thing he saw when he when he washed his eyes out in the mud out of his eyes he saw himself in the reflection in the pool and the next thing he wanted to see was jesus amen something about it when he touches you you want to see him you want to get to him and thank him for it amen bless it be the name of the lord does it sound like i'm winding down have i said i'm going to close okay i'm just keeping you sharp here or you're keeping me sharp look at jesus when he came on the scene dormant prophecy was was laying there for hundreds of years durham of prophecy was laying in jesus 12 year old boy he wasn't ready to redeem he wasn't ready to die he had to come to maturity he had to fulfill all the promises of the scripture had to grow to that age he had to be growing up before him like a tender plant and everything like a root out of a dry ground he had to fulfill all the prophecies and he had to fulfill the sufferings of all the people he had to have all the sickness he had to bear everything that you've ever born and i and every one of us by the millions throughout the ages he had to bear our griefs and carry our sorrows and he absolutely did and then takes death for every man oh praise be to the name of the lord but in that that dormant prophecy came powerful and became active amen see that's why we know it's not a fable brother david was saying how do you know it's true because look what it did look what it did it is an imagination is your salvation imagination anybody no it ain't imagine how do you know because it's doing something because it's active in me it's actively dealing with me i'm not what i should be but i it's making me press on amen make you come to church when you don't feel like it make you be nice when you want to slap somebody upside the head it makes you speak clean words when you want to use the the the modern uh culture words which is so filthy make a sh make a sailor a marine blush the way these nine nine-year-old girls and boys talking to schools now it's it's disgusting but see that's prophecy brother of what's going to happen in this world that has become active and all we can talk about now is how it's all becoming active over there on that side taxes going up inflation like never before a country that's in chaos and wickedness and on every hand and dictatorship just around the corner amen and running us off into little caves and there are places to have our meetings closing down the doors of these beautiful places that god's blessed us with taking it away from us all those were prophecies that laid dormant but brother they're happening now they're active and we're talking about it we should be talking more about what's active in us what's active in us is we believe god's on the scene god's going to help us god's not going to leave us alone amen blessed be the name of the lord look at how you're right how she activated the promise of malachi 4. celery was talking about the squirrels and she said well i didn't know squirrel but that can surely work on me amen and she said to him and that's nothing but the truth brother branham and brother and said it said like the roof come off the building so like a super anointing came down on the hill use the word if you want to search the quote super anointing he said never felt it before he said he came down on me and he said i looked here and i said hattie because you said that he said god told me to give you anything you want all of a sudden her dormant prophecy because her name was supposed to be in the message books her name was supposed to be in the message books her name was already in the lamb's book of life and it was supposed to be in the message books amen and and so god had to bring it from dormant into active before it could get in the book can you say amen when you move from bible to message roof and just prophecy laying dormant to prophecy become active you become the book you become the word you're the living book of jesus christ amen thanks be to god for his mercy brother not the high not the high and mighty but the little humble housewife couldn't even sign her name no not the theologian but a little simple humble said brother man that's nothing but the truth you say you've got to do so i've got to do something really big for to catch god's attention brother ted i'm not catching his attention i need to do something really really outstanding no you don't you could do something something that nobody else would ever think twice about but you do it at the right time and in the right place and in the right way and that super annoying come down your way too how many believe that you think about chad be lying to you i could be lying if i'm just telling you what the prophet said what the bible said i didn't just come up with this this came from the word my brother blessed be the name of the lord when you surrender to your promise it becomes active in you it becomes the i am instead of i hope so because a lot of us in this message are the biggest hopers you ever saw is hope hope and just hope it was just hope i'm doing it right hope i'm in doing the right thing when it changes from hope so to know so yeah you're on your way my brother so you're running brother and said you're running high speed up the king's highway with the sword drawn and no devil can't stop you he can't even get on the highway the unclean can't even get on that highway you're running on you've been made clean by the blood of the lamb through the blood of the lamb you've been made free through the blood of the lamb you've been activated brother hallelujah and a lot of times we get so wore out because we're we're like slaves you know an assault line we're slaves to the our boss to our job to try to make a living in this crazy world or used to take 50 bucks a month you know to live we could live on 50 a month the old days we buy a house down here in kentucky remember in those old days for seven eight thousand dollars them days are gone now you need seven hundred and eighty thousand dollars and pretty nice now that what we're paying for automobiles now is what people could buy a house in a farm for that's gone insane brother you say well that's just the time yeah because that was dormant prophecy laying there waiting to happen but watch this in our closing to catch it these things happening out there was waiting for you to come along because in you was the power to display jesus christ in the midst of satan's biggest boast he's making his biggest move in his biggest play for the entire earth right now but all throughout the globe god's got humble little children who was born with a prophecy in them laying dormant waiting for situations to arise where god's light could come down and say this is that and you believe it and now you have a more sure word of prophecy shall we bow our heads heavenly father i thank you for loving your mercy thank you for the privilege of preaching here once again evening light fellowship tabernacle here in elkton i spent many good times here in elkton and just drove by the old you know uh milliken or whatever that building is there this city building over there where we had that meeting one time tried to introduce the message of the hour brother perry green different ones came down the mendel gates and different ones i think my brother billy was here billy andrews but lord those were good times we tried to reach out here but the time wasn't right yet for establishing a good solid church but later as time went on the prophecy was laying coming out of florida a tennessee in different places and you brought things together and you brought this little assembly here which is a a beacon a light on the hill uh on hillside and uh thank you father for that and we just ask you to know that while we're going through stuff like we do so hard and discouragements and torture and horrible things is because there's prophecy laying in us uh waiting to come become active and best i know how to bring it active is just to keep believing and keep trusting lord and keep praising you and just keep on keeping on keep on doing what we know is right and it'll activate every promise in us father and so we thank you lord and we know that that rapture is in us right now and we if we even if we die go to the grave and our bodies turn back to the elements the rapture is in our in the dust that we leave behind and that will come up again lord and we'll be changed and pass out of here because his prophecy that has laid dormant but when it activates there'll be no disputing it there'll be no arguing it there'll be no fusses about it because it became active and it became demonstrated so help us lord to be that kind of christian that we are active as we walk around this earth carrying a good spirit with us carrying the life of christ on display because that's the token if it's just hidden that isn't the token it must be on display so bless every one of us tonight father and i ask in jesus name now i'm going to ask anybody that wants a prayer just want to slip your little hand up and say lord i wasn't planning on getting this serious on a wednesday night but i'm real serious right now maybe you're activating something in my life maybe this is the time and i i'm here if that's what you want to do maybe there'd be somebody slip their hand up now brother said little brother ted will look at you and pray for you young person here god bless you not brother there and a sister there and another size no one knows i know your names i won't call them anyone else god bless you on the back god bless you and i know your names i know you uh well i don't know you like he knows i don't know like brother thomas knows you but i know you i know that he knows exactly what's on your heart and i know that he knew how to speak to you tonight and i believe that he did that wasn't me that was him he was in my mouth and my experiences what he put on my heart and it wouldn't work unless i was able to get out of the way and let him do it so i want to give him praise that must have been that i was able to get out of the way that was wonderful i want to do it more and i want you to do it too and i want god to help you get out of the way and let your promise become active we're our biggest problem we hinder it too much we try to make it happen the way we want it to lord don't let us do that there's no time for doing that anymore down here tonight lord and take take every one of these precious people who raise their hand and take them by the hand and see i'm glad you did that now because you did that i'm going to take you by the hand and i'm going to show you how to do it i won't leave you alone oh lord don't leave them alone be with them be near to them and help him father let it be more sweeter than it's ever been and may be more powerful because that's what i was preaching to them tonight lord the power of active prophecy so help him jesus name i pray for the glory of god bless our pastor as he comes back up here and service closes and as we go home to our little beds keep us active in your service lord let us go onward and upward don't let us fall back but if we do fall back let us wake up real quick and remember from whence we are fallen and get back to it lord father we pray for the love and name of the lord jesus christ and your glory we thank you amen god bless you god's good god is good all all the time he you sing that here puts a song of praise in this heart sorry that's probably too fast of a song with tears in your eyes and a little bit of a i'll sing one like mercy rewrote my life and that i think i'll go over better story of my life picking the wrong song at the right time mercy rewrote my life mercy that's my story boy rewrote my you want to know what my life story is [Music] you get the key and i'll follow you i should have fallen in my soul come brother i'm done but david
