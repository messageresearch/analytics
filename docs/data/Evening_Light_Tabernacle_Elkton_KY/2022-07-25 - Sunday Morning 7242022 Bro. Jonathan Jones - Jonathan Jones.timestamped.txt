[4:03] praise he the lord
[4:05] praise o you servants of the lord praise
[4:08] the name of the lord
[4:15] from the rising of the sun

[4:50] barren women to keep house and to be
[4:52] joyful mother of children praise ye the
[4:55] lord for the brine you may be
[5:08] seated good morning brothers and sisters
[5:12] if you would uh turn with me to
[5:14] galatians the fifth chapter but
[5:17] there's a scripture in there on that
[5:19] psalm we were reading
[5:21] this morning
[5:23] it says who has like unto the lord our
[5:25] god who dwelleth on high
[5:27] will humble himself to behold the things
[5:29] that are in the heaven and in the earth
[5:31] you know
[5:33] but you know the thing i was thinking
[5:34] about
[5:35] what people don't believe in the day
[5:36] that we live in is that god that's in
[5:39] heaven right now is in the hearts of his
[5:41] people
[5:42] and when they see the things you're
[5:43] doing for him
[5:45] they can't believe that it's god
[5:46] manifested to him what they're seeing
[5:49] they can't believe that
[5:50] they when they think of god they think
[5:52] of up here they don't ever think of them
[5:55] down here on the heart
[5:57] and a lot of times they give you
[5:59] struggles they give you they fuss with
[6:00] you they just can't believe that god can
[6:02] take over the
[6:04] desires take over the heart of a man or
[6:07] woman and lead them and be his
[6:10] representative on the face of the earth
[6:13] i i was also going to mention
[6:15] some of you are already starting to
[6:17] notice
[6:19] that uh our electric company has raised
[6:22] their rate
[6:23] so
[6:25] it's been a long time since i've had a
[6:27] 500 dollar plus electric bill
[6:30] since i
[6:32] put mostly leds in the church it's been
[6:34] a long time since the bill's been that
[6:36] high in the summertime
[6:38] i think it was like 530 540
[6:42] so
[6:44] um
[6:45] we should be alright if we get through
[6:47] this month it's supposed to cool off
[6:49] we'll be back down to the normal you
[6:51] know most of the year if the electric
[6:54] bill has never been a
[6:55] dollars a month it kind of surprised me
[6:58] there being that high hadn't been that
[6:59] way even last summer when it was a
[7:01] little warm it never got that hot
[7:05] i was gonna go to this message this
[7:09] morning i hope i marked my spot
[7:13] you know i was thinking
[7:15] also you know we live in a weak age
[7:18] i mean people i don't take this
[7:20] personally but people are just weak
[7:23] the things that
[7:24] 60 years ago a hundred years ago people
[7:27] used to suffer and endure and not
[7:29] complain and just put their head down
[7:31] and that they knew it was part of life
[7:33] they're not that way anymore
[7:35] this day and age they complain about
[7:36] everything whether it's air conditioning
[7:39] whether it's heat whether it's too warm
[7:42] it's too cold people can't be happy
[7:44] i mean christians should be the happiest
[7:46] people around the world but it just
[7:47] seems strange
[7:49] she said people just don't have peace
[7:51] they're just not happy in the state that
[7:53] they're at you know it could be worse
[7:55] i always say that to him it could be
[7:57] worse but uh i'm going to start here at
[8:00] um
[8:02] at about the
[8:04] about the 13th verse here i know i read
[8:06] this chapter in
[8:08] galatians a lot
[8:11] but i was thinking this morning
[8:14] a lot of times in as christians god is
[8:17] just simply asking us to be who he made
[8:19] us to be simply be
[8:22] the manner or woman that god made you to
[8:24] be
[8:25] just be sweet
[8:26] just be loving just be caring in
[8:28] everything you do and let christ
[8:30] manifest himself
[8:32] through your heart and life and
[8:33] everything that you do
[8:35] and if you'll just let go and let god
[8:38] have his way
[8:39] that's what he'll do in your heart and
[8:41] in your life let me just read this this
[8:44] morning
[8:45] you know i was sitting in my office for
[8:47] a couple hours this morning and it was
[8:48] just blank you know after a busy week
[8:51] but you know you can get so busy in the
[8:53] personal things that you forget to do
[8:55] the things of god but uh let me start at
[8:58] this uh
[9:00] i'm trying to figure out a good place to
[9:01] start here
[9:03] at the 12th of so i would have you even
[9:05] cut off that which trouble you for
[9:08] brethren you have been called
[9:10] undeliberally only use not your liberty
[9:13] for occasion to the flesh
[9:15] but by love serve one another
[9:18] for all the law is fulfilled
[9:20] one word even this the thou shall love
[9:22] thy neighbor as thyself
[9:25] and sometimes i i know that can be hard
[9:27] to do but that's the simple truth there
[9:29] do you love people like you love
[9:31] yourself or
[9:32] everyone knows who you are i was i wrote
[9:34] some notes down here i was just thinking
[9:37] uh especially for young men and young
[9:39] women you know you're
[9:41] you're born with
[9:43] with morality you're born with knowing
[9:45] right from wrong and as you move further
[9:47] on in life as you get older and older
[9:49] and older
[9:51] you
[9:51] your enemy is going to make you want to
[9:53] compromise that integrity and that
[9:55] honesty that you're born with as you get
[9:58] older and older and older and you'll get
[10:00] to a position in your life where you're
[10:01] going to have to choose to walk the
[10:03] right path to walk the wrong path and it
[10:06] can be so easily that he just tries to
[10:09] convince you you know the way i was
[10:10] thinking this morning it's like who you
[10:12] work with i don't everyone has different
[10:14] jobs
[10:15] but when you work with people there's
[10:18] always that person that's trying to get
[10:19] you to compromise your integrity and
[10:22] your honesty he's always trying to get
[10:24] you to do something that you know that
[10:26] is wrong that you shouldn't do and he's
[10:29] gonna push you and push you and push you
[10:31] until you either say no
[10:33] or you surrender and that's just like
[10:35] your enemy this morning in the things
[10:37] that you do in the in your life he's
[10:39] going to push you and push you and push
[10:41] you and push you
[10:45] so he realizes you're going to stand
[10:47] firm in what god taught you and what you
[10:49] know that is right and they're they're
[10:52] watching you
[10:53] both in a physical and a spiritual sense
[10:56] watching you to see you make that first
[10:58] mistake and after you make that first
[11:00] mistake
[11:01] when then they're going to push you to
[11:02] make the second mistake and then make
[11:04] the third mistake and before you know it
[11:06] they're bringing all your mistakes up to
[11:08] you and it's and that's why you want to
[11:10] be in a position where you don't make i
[11:12] know we all make mistakes but you don't
[11:14] want to make that first mistake you want
[11:16] to stay true to your lord but let me
[11:18] i'm all over the place this morning but
[11:20] the law fulfilled in one word even this
[11:22] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[11:25] but if you bite and devour one another
[11:27] take heed at least you be consumed one
[11:29] another that's really true for the day
[11:31] that we live and you get around people
[11:33] you don't understand how they live
[11:34] sometimes all they do is fuss and talk
[11:37] bad about other people
[11:39] never looking at their own lives i mean
[11:41] that's just the state of the age that we
[11:43] live in
[11:44] but and he goes on this i say then
[11:47] walk in the spirit that you shall not
[11:49] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[11:51] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[11:54] and the spirit against the flesh these
[11:56] are contrary one to another so that you
[11:58] cannot do the things that you would but
[12:01] be led of the spirit
[12:03] and you are not under the law
[12:05] now the works of the flesh are manifest
[12:07] which are these and i'm not going to
[12:09] read them all you can read them yourself
[12:11] there's a lot of things
[12:13] that you see there that are wrong
[12:15] but if you're in christ
[12:17] you'll flee these things all these
[12:19] things that you see going on in the
[12:21] world and as you drop down he says here
[12:25] which i have told you before and as i've
[12:27] told you in the time past
[12:29] them that which do such things shall not
[12:32] inherit the kingdom of god and it hasn't
[12:34] changed for 2022.
[12:38] if you're doing such things
[12:41] you're
[12:42] not going to inherit the kingdom of god
[12:44] no matter what your enemy is telling you
[12:46] it's just truth but this is what we all
[12:48] want to represent in our hearts and
[12:50] lives and it says but the fruit of the
[12:51] spirit
[12:52] is love joy peace long suffering
[12:54] gentleness goodness faith
[12:56] meekness temperance and such there's no
[12:59] law if they that are in that they that
[13:02] are christ have crucified the flesh
[13:04] which the affections and lust
[13:06] but if you live in the spirit let us
[13:08] also walk in the spirit and let us not
[13:10] be desirous of vainglory provoking one
[13:13] another to envy and i was gonna
[13:16] i hope i didn't take this out here
[13:21] but god simply wants us to be christians
[13:24] in the day that we live
[13:26] it might be a hard thing to be in the
[13:28] day that we live but it he that's all he
[13:30] wants you to do is just be who you are
[13:32] in christ
[13:33] not something that you're not supposed
[13:35] to be
[13:36] but i was going to read this here
[13:40] you know
[13:41] you all probably know this brother
[13:43] branham taught it a lot god hates a
[13:45] manufacturer he hates a person that
[13:48] isn't when you see him he's not the real
[13:50] person that he really is
[13:52] that you know
[13:53] if you're manufacturing something that
[13:55] you're not that's not what god wants you
[13:57] to be this morning he wants to be what
[13:59] he's leading you to be if you have to
[14:01] manufacture your christianity or you you
[14:04] have to manufacture this or manufacture
[14:07] that and everything that you do in life
[14:09] you're you don't have no foundation you
[14:11] just naturally become what god wants you
[14:14] to be you can't manufacture it after a
[14:16] while people will start realizing that
[14:18] you're manufacturing and uh
[14:22] i'll start this is in this uh the day on
[14:24] calvary i'll just read a few quotes here
[14:27] and then sit down before i go off on
[14:29] another tangent here
[14:32] uh i was reading this this morning
[14:36] yeah this is what brother brown i was
[14:38] just thinking
[14:39] in the age that we're living everyone
[14:41] wants to be everyone wants a trophy
[14:44] everyone wants to be tapped on the back
[14:46] saying they're doing a good job to a
[14:48] point out where
[14:49] it's a crazy thing in the age that we
[14:51] live you know a lot of i was always
[14:53] raised i can't speak for anyone else
[14:56] just doing a good job and doing the
[14:58] right thing should have been enough i
[15:00] was always taught from my own father
[15:03] that just doing the right thing at the
[15:05] right time was enough you didn't have to
[15:07] have someone telling you that what you
[15:09] did was okay you just know in your heart
[15:11] that doing a good job and doing the
[15:12] right thing at the right time was its
[15:15] own reward but that's not how people are
[15:17] today but i'll just read what he has to
[15:19] say here
[15:20] now say you know
[15:22] i'll start here
[15:24] he was talking about this widow how he
[15:26] would had given cole cole to her but
[15:29] i'll start at this last part of this
[15:30] hundred and second paragraph says bless
[15:33] god i'm a christian all mine you selfish
[15:35] poor miserable person you're a hypocrite
[15:38] so basically saying if you're telling
[15:40] everyone else what you're doing for
[15:41] other people then you're a hypocrite you
[15:44] should not let your right hand know what
[15:45] your left hand is doing
[15:48] and this is what he says here don't let
[15:50] your right hand know what your left hand
[15:52] is doing and the left know what the
[15:54] right is doing
[15:55] just so i automatically dead and cries
[15:58] till you do it and that's what i'm
[15:59] trying to say if you're dead in christ
[16:01] you're just going to do the right thing
[16:02] because it's the right thing to do
[16:05] do it now anywhere your life's nature
[16:07] it's your makeup you do it anyhow it's
[16:09] just the life that lives in you you're
[16:11] completely yielded to the spirit and you
[16:14] just live it lives itself in you or you
[16:17] feel that blessed spirit not life not me
[16:20] that liveth said paul but christ that
[16:22] live within me just so automatic it goes
[16:24] back to what i said earlier you can't
[16:26] manufacture it you just got to live it
[16:28] and believe it and it'll show itself
[16:30] through you if you just let go and he
[16:33] goes on to say well i tell you brother
[16:35] brown and we are christians here we help
[16:37] these people we help them people oh my
[16:39] shame oh you that's not christianity
[16:42] christianity you automatically got it
[16:44] got you
[16:46] it's to be done and you just
[16:48] you just forget about it all about it
[16:50] ain't go do it christ was completely
[16:53] surrendered to his life to god he gave
[16:56] himself a
[16:57] public servant to the people he gave his
[16:59] life freely
[17:01] he didn't have to do it
[17:02] he didn't regurgitally do it
[17:05] he didn't say now brethren you ought to
[17:07] think a whole lot of me because i'm come
[17:10] to die for you he never said a word
[17:12] about it he died anyhow because it was
[17:14] god in him
[17:15] and if god's in you and if god's in me
[17:17] he'll make us look at others
[17:20] sheep on one side and one of them will
[17:22] say lord well i did this and lord i did
[17:24] that he'll say depart from me you work
[17:26] as of nebuti
[17:28] i never knew you if the church can ever
[17:30] come to these fundamental facts that
[17:33] it's not something you try to do or you
[17:35] work up yourself to do it's something
[17:37] that you're born
[17:39] born in you and that's what i'm trying
[17:40] to say
[17:41] we just got to be what god wants us to
[17:43] be this morning whatever that is whether
[17:46] it's a preacher a teacher whatever god's
[17:49] chosen you
[17:50] chosen for you to be
[17:52] like brother bradham said whatever that
[17:54] is
[17:55] that's what you need to do and you just
[17:57] need to move forward and do it the best
[17:59] way you can
[18:01] you know and the day we live that's not
[18:02] what the way they teach you anymore but
[18:04] you should be the best at anything that
[18:06] you do you shouldn't be satisfied being
[18:09] mediocre whether it's a christian
[18:11] whatever it is you know you never get
[18:13] ahead being mediocre in anything and he
[18:16] goes on to say
[18:18] depart from me you worked as an iniquity
[18:19] i never knew you if the church can ever
[18:21] come to these fundamental facts
[18:24] and it's not something
[18:25] you try to do you work yourself up to do
[18:28] it's something that's born in
[18:30] born in
[18:32] you
[18:33] well i could keep on reading and not
[18:35] stop but i was just simply thinking this
[18:37] morning i was telling jeanette i was as
[18:40] i was trying i'm not trying to be funny

[18:44] the workers were out in the tobacco
[18:46] fields yesterday and what was it 100 and
[18:48] 510 high ball temperature they're out
[18:50] there oiling that tobacco i'm not saying

[19:04] just thinking thursday and friday i'm
[19:05] working around people that are in the
[19:08] air-conditioned room at 78 degrees
[19:11] and are complaining that it's too hot
[19:12] that my point being is no matter what
[19:15] circumstances you find yourself in you
[19:17] just got to relax and let god have his
[19:19] way in it whether it's too hot or it's
[19:21] too cold whether it's not the way you
[19:24] want it to be that's that's not our lot
[19:26] in life our lot in life is to be what
[19:28] god wants us to be and just walk in that

[48:05] and he's truly been good to us
[48:07] the message god's chosen place of
[48:09] worship in
[48:10] 25
[48:11] brother brennan makes his comment he
[48:12] says now notice
[48:14] god has promised to meet his worshipers
[48:17] in these in this and only this one place
[48:20] and that is
[48:22] of his choosing
[48:23] not of our choosing not of our thinking
[48:26] but of his thinking
[48:28] his choosing and said it would be a
[48:30] place where he put his name
[48:32] where he chose so we find out where he
[48:35] put his name and where he chose and it's
[48:37] by his own choosing
[48:39] now that we have found the place he put
[48:41] his name
[48:42] that is in christ jesus
[48:46] let me be a jesus man
[48:49] he said there is no other place there is
[48:51] no other name
[48:53] are you satisfied with that and the
[48:54] congregation says i mean he says now the
[48:56] thing of it is is if we find where that
[48:58] place is the worship place
[49:00] is nowhere now we are accepted only in
[49:04] christ it is in the name of jesus it is
[49:07] in his name that's all i want he said
[49:09] you go all of these directions but it
[49:11] all comes back to the name of jesus
[49:14] jesus
[49:15] amen in proverbs
[49:16] 18 verse 10
[49:18] very very very common scripture
[49:21] but it says
[49:24] the name
[49:25] of the lord is a strong tower
[49:28] and the righteous run into it
[49:31] and it's safe
[49:33] the name of the lord is a strong tower
[49:36] and the righteous run into it in his
[49:38] faith
[49:39] heavenly father lord we truly love you
[49:42] this morning lord we appreciate you lord

[50:16] promise
[50:17] and thy lovely name we pray
[50:19] amen and amen and you'll be seated this
[50:22] morning and we'll just go right into the
[50:25] thought on my head and you know it's uh
[50:28] sometimes you know i come down the road
[50:30] and i ask my kids and tabitha come with
[50:32] me my middle daughter's got a kidney
[50:34] stone she's in a lot of pain and so i
[50:37] told my wife to stay back but i asked
[50:38] her i said tell me what to preach and
[50:40] she goes i'm not god
[50:42] i said well give me a hand she goes no
[50:45] so i can't get no help from nobody but
[50:47] we try to follow the will of him but
[50:49] this morning if i titled it i would
[50:50] title it the impossible
[50:52] by jesus christ
[50:54] the impossible by jesus christ in
[50:57] philippians 2 we'll read a little bit of
[50:58] scripture try to set a little foundation
[51:00] philippians 2 we find paul speaking to
[51:03] the philippians here and he's beginning
[51:05] to tell them the importance of jesus
[51:06] christ and he says let this mind be in
[51:09] you which also is in christ jesus
[51:12] who being the form of god thought it not
[51:15] robbery to be equal with god but made
[51:17] himself of no reputation and took upon
[51:20] him the form of a servant who was made
[51:23] in the likeness of men and i think this
[51:25] morning as i heard the brother do his
[51:27] little uh uh excerpt this morning of a
[51:30] sermon and really deal with the day that
[51:32] we're living in the scriptures and
[51:33] galatians that he was reading we was
[51:35] going through the service and i'm
[51:37] looking at my notes and i'm thinking god
[51:39] you know every situation you know
[51:41] everything that is upon us and lord we
[51:44] could be miles away and you could drive
[51:46] our minds to think the same way and
[51:48] we're living in a day of of such a
[51:50] turmoil of men and women around the land
[51:53] but yet god gave us his word and he
[51:56] placed it in his son and in that we have
[51:58] a bride that believes that and believes
[52:01] that you know what he never made a
[52:02] reputation of himself but you have so
[52:05] many people that wants to make it about
[52:06] i make it about me but yet god wants us
[52:09] to make it about him and this whole book
[52:12] and this whole story and i'm not a
[52:14] writer because if i'd mess it all up but
[52:17] i begin to look from the beginning to
[52:19] the end to the day we live in this is
[52:21] the greatest story that's ever been
[52:23] written and it's the story by jesus
[52:25] christ and jesus was jehovah in the old
[52:28] testament but it was still the same
[52:30] anointing in the same spirit that moved
[52:32] upon men and and i got this uh it's on
[52:34] my facebook page and i've always loved
[52:37] it but it makes a comment it says god
[52:39] has a habit of taking nobodies and
[52:41] making them somebodies and i began to
[52:44] look and i said that's the way god
[52:46] writes his stories he he looks for a
[52:48] servant that is
[52:49] humble whether it's a man a woman a
[52:51] child whatever it may be he looks for
[52:54] someone willing to be humble before his
[52:57] word and he can make somebody out of
[52:59] them he took a david in a day that
[53:02] didn't want nothing to do with the
[53:03] military he didn't want nothing to do
[53:05] with the war but there was something in
[53:07] him that he wanted to be for god and
[53:09] whatever god wanted him to do and i
[53:12] believe that as david would come down
[53:14] from the farms and visit his brothers
[53:15] look david wasn't going to be a member
[53:18] of the military he wasn't going to be a
[53:21] soldier he was bringing food to his
[53:23] brothers to help encourage them but when
[53:26] he got down there david was a humble
[53:29] servant before god and god said i can
[53:31] use this humility i can use this nobody
[53:35] with no training and no warfare no
[53:37] experience and i can make him an
[53:40] overcomer with me inside of him and i
[53:42] believe if we look down and we see
[53:45] that's what makes us overcomers in this
[53:47] day we're overcomers because we are the
[53:50] greatest story that god has ever written
[53:52] he has written the story ye are the
[53:55] impossible
[53:56] written by jesus christ and and paul and
[53:59] paul in philippians here is trying to
[54:01] tell them this is not me that does these
[54:04] things but i have yielded myself to the
[54:07] spirit of god i have yielded my vessel
[54:10] to this god i've heard it my thoughts to
[54:13] the mind of christ and if you want to be
[54:15] like this then let this mind be in you
[54:19] let you become this this is and being
[54:21] found in fashion as men he humbled
[54:24] himself and became obedient even to
[54:26] death even to the death of the cross you
[54:29] know the hardest thing to do is to be
[54:31] obedient to the word of god when the
[54:33] word tells us something you know what we
[54:35] don't want to do it we want to do it our
[54:37] way
[54:38] but a humble servant of god would say
[54:41] god not my will but vine will be done
[54:46] even unto death isn't that what jesus
[54:48] did
[54:49] he stood there in the garden he didn't
[54:51] want to die he didn't want to hang on
[54:53] the cross he didn't want to take the
[54:55] stripes for our healing as much as he
[54:57] loved us he didn't want to go through
[54:59] that but he stood there and he said but
[55:01] god if it be thy will i will do this for
[55:05] my children i will do this because
[55:07] you've asked me to do it god let me be
[55:09] more like christ
[55:12] let me be able to a situation and look
[55:14] around and say god i really don't want
[55:16] to go through this sorrow i don't want
[55:18] to go through this sickness i don't want
[55:20] to go through this faith but if it be
[55:22] thy will lord let me oh be obedient to
[55:25] your word let me be that one that can
[55:27] overcome
[55:29] wherefore god has also
[55:31] have highly exalted him
[55:34] and given him a name which is above
[55:36] every name
[55:38] that name of all the jihad the name of
[55:40] jesus every knee shall bow and the
[55:43] things of heaven and things of earth
[55:45] these things that are other than he says
[55:47] and every tongue should confess that
[55:49] jesus christ is lord to the glory of god
[55:52] the father what is it it's coming to a
[55:55] place that even when the world is turned
[55:57] against the christians even when the
[55:59] world is turned against god they go
[56:01] totally insane they still have to admit
[56:04] they still have to confess there's
[56:06] something about you there's something
[56:08] about your life why because you're an
[56:11] overcomer in this age
[56:13] the people in david's day they had to
[56:15] look at david and see there was
[56:17] something different about him there was
[56:20] something unique about him when
[56:22] everybody else was scared he wasn't
[56:24] scared when everybody else was falling
[56:26] apart he wasn't falling apart when
[56:28] anybody else was nervous he wasn't
[56:30] nervous why he knew where he stood with
[56:33] the word of god and children of god
[56:36] that's the way we are today that's why
[56:38] it may seem impossible it may seem
[56:40] unlikely but there's a bride today that
[56:43] she knows who she is and she realizes
[56:45] what the word says and she is an
[56:47] overcomer in this day
[56:50] and the world has to admit it's
[56:53] that fulfilling scripture you as every
[56:56] good deed every bad deed every person in
[56:58] this world is fulfilling scripture
[57:01] every every sinner on the street is
[57:04] fulfilling scripture they're fulfilling
[57:07] exactly what god said he said well how
[57:09] will i give you an example
[57:10] you know what when joseph was thrown
[57:12] into the pit joseph was tucked into
[57:14] egypt everywhere joseph went it was a
[57:17] blessing
[57:19] look he was like their golden child
[57:20] that's what brother branham referred to
[57:22] at one time everything that he touched
[57:24] turned to gold he was blessed wife
[57:28] he was a servant of god
[57:30] look i worked at a place and the guy
[57:32] actually used the words not a believer
[57:34] not a christian just an old rough old
[57:37] man that's a boss he looks at me and he
[57:39] says jonathan you're my golden nugget it
[57:42] don't matter where i put you i prosper
[57:45] what he's testifying of the mercies of
[57:48] god he's testifying of the truth of the
[57:50] word of god he's testifying this very
[57:53] scripture
[57:54] every tongue shall confess that jesus
[57:58] christ is the lord of all why because it
[58:00] is his book it is his play it is his
[58:03] example he's using each and every one of
[58:05] us in the way to prepare us and to put a
[58:08] place
[58:09] what is it
[58:11] listen to this once we sing this song
[58:13] with john as he brought me out with that
[58:15] song in the acts of the holy spirit in
[58:17] 1954
[58:19] said another lady said it's talking to
[58:20] brother brennam said another lady says
[58:23] where do you go to church
[58:25] called her up and i heard this
[58:27] said where do you go to church did i go
[58:29] to the brenham tabernacle and she says
[58:31] you mean you there with that kind of
[58:33] doctrine and getting under such as that
[58:36] see people says well they didn't
[58:37] criticize
[58:39] every devil in hell has criticized the
[58:40] word of god since the beginning of time
[58:43] it hadn't changed today it hasn't it
[58:45] hasn't come to four like today it's
[58:47] always been that way they tried to kill
[58:51] david because they thought david was
[58:52] trying to become king but god said he
[58:54] would become king but yet they was
[58:56] coming against the word for their day
[58:58] they tried to mock noah they didn't try
[59:00] they mocked noah they threw nature was
[59:02] at it they called him every name they
[59:04] was coming against the word for their
[59:06] day and it's the same today
[59:09] says you
[59:10] can you go up there that kind of
[59:12] doctrine be sitting under such a sad and
[59:14] she said what kind of doctrine
[59:16] says well they brag too much on jesus
[59:18] lord i'd like somebody to say i brag too
[59:21] much on jesus
[59:22] come on the world's out to the place
[59:24] they don't want to recognize
[59:26] us he is the master he is the savior he
[59:29] is the all in all he is everything that
[59:31] was everything that will be he is my
[59:34] overcoming power
[59:36] so how do you stay happy by jesus christ
[59:39] how do you be healed by jesus christ how
[59:42] do you be saved by jesus christ how do
[59:44] you live in this state by jesus christ
[59:47] he is everything to me
[59:49] he said oh they brag too much about
[59:51] jesus
[59:52] well maybe we need to brag more about it
[59:54] but let's just be honest
[59:56] sometimes in message churches we brag
[59:58] more about brother branham than we do
[59:59] about jesus
[1:00:00] come on close to home it don't feel so
[1:00:02] good but let's think about it let's brag
[1:00:05] about jesus son let's know the same god
[1:00:08] that lived in the days before the earth
[1:00:09] was formed is the same god that lived in
[1:00:12] the days of our prophet is the same god
[1:00:14] that is living in you and i today
[1:00:17] so they brag too much about jesus
[1:00:20] about baptizing
[1:00:22] using his name in baptism using his name
[1:00:25] and everything else that's what i want
[1:00:26] to do i want to use his name in
[1:00:29] everything that i do because it isn't my
[1:00:31] story it's his story i'm just an
[1:00:35] actor in his book i'm just playing out
[1:00:37] my part i'm just doing what he's asked
[1:00:40] me to do
[1:00:41] why can you do it
[1:00:43] why can you overcome the impossible
[1:00:45] by jesus
[1:00:47] by jesus
[1:00:48] for the bible said my brethren there is
[1:00:50] no other way unto heaven given among men
[1:00:54] no other name above heaven
[1:00:56] given to men
[1:00:57] whereby you might be saved certainly he
[1:01:00] said brother says i tell you brother i'm
[1:01:02] not a fusser but i'd like to see any man
[1:01:05] anywhere anytime by the bible prove that
[1:01:08] isn't right
[1:01:09] come on that's right no matter what they
[1:01:11] say you're crazy and everything else it
[1:01:13] doesn't make a difference all power was
[1:01:16] given under that name of jesus christ
[1:01:20] what
[1:01:21] is it we're living in a day we want to
[1:01:23] take our eyes off the end
[1:01:25] look we don't want we don't want to go
[1:01:27] through trouble we don't want to go
[1:01:28] through everybody wants the government
[1:01:30] to pay everything to have do everything
[1:01:32] they do and they just want to send it
[1:01:33] home and do nothing
[1:01:34] nobody wants to work for nothing but
[1:01:36] god's called a group of people that's
[1:01:38] willing to fight the fighter that's
[1:01:40] looking at this day that we're living in
[1:01:42] this layout of the sea and age all the
[1:01:44] spirits has come against you there's a
[1:01:45] bride that's going to create and make
[1:01:47] the impossible be real
[1:01:49] what is it we look can we find so many
[1:01:52] places in the scripture we find david
[1:01:54] and goliath that we talked about look
[1:01:56] david couldn't overcome goliath on his
[1:01:58] own we and you you know become the
[1:02:00] spirit so
[1:02:01] but yet god took an impossible situation
[1:02:04] a situation that there was no way out of
[1:02:07] and he says but i would perform this in
[1:02:09] you david and david
[1:02:11] let me be yours lord
[1:02:13] look when he went down to the creek and
[1:02:14] he picked stones up i don't believe he
[1:02:16] was doing it with an arrogant saying i'm
[1:02:18] going to throw this and i believe you
[1:02:19] said god what are you doing
[1:02:21] god what are you doing in this battle
[1:02:23] god you know i can't overcome him but
[1:02:25] there was something inside of him saying
[1:02:27] but the god of the impossible
[1:02:29] he's in control of this story he
[1:02:32] knows how the end's gonna play out and
[1:02:35] his word will not be turned forward and
[1:02:37] he told me to enter this fight
[1:02:40] look children of god the day they were
[1:02:41] living in he brought us up in this day
[1:02:44] he didn't make an accident and have you
[1:02:46] birthed in a different generation i joke
[1:02:48] about it sometimes myself but there's
[1:02:50] not no truth in that god chose you and
[1:02:53] me for this day god shows us he knew the
[1:02:57] covert outbreak how it would be he knew
[1:02:59] the sicknesses look the scripture tells
[1:03:02] us there's coming a day of plagues and
[1:03:04] famines in the land we're living in that
[1:03:06] day
[1:03:08] but yet he didn't say that his bride
[1:03:09] would be humbled down in defeat walking
[1:03:11] around with no she said she would be an
[1:03:12] overcoming bride that she would be the
[1:03:15] god of the impossible and they say that
[1:03:17] she would hold her head back she would
[1:03:19] be without spot or without blemish what
[1:03:23] is it he knew what you could do
[1:03:27] i think about the three hebrew children
[1:03:29] always i always talk about my hebrew
[1:03:31] children i just love them so much
[1:03:33] because you know what i think they're so
[1:03:34] real to us
[1:03:35] in the fact that you know what that
[1:03:37] prophet had gone off the scene
[1:03:39] but yet they remembered what he heard
[1:03:41] they remembered what he had said and
[1:03:43] they knew what they were supposed to do
[1:03:45] children of god were living in a day of
[1:03:47] impossibilities but yet we already have
[1:03:50] a word for this day god sent a prophet
[1:03:52] in our day he sent a prophet to come in
[1:03:56] this day to preach to us in a way to
[1:03:58] prepare us for what we have made of to
[1:04:01] prepare us for the battles that we're
[1:04:02] going to face to prepare us for the
[1:04:04] things that we're fighting in 2022 we
[1:04:07] already have the answer
[1:04:10] why do we look to the world why don't we
[1:04:12] look to negativity look this world's
[1:04:14] become the most negative place in the
[1:04:16] world
[1:04:18] this world if it ain't negative it don't
[1:04:20] make the news
[1:04:22] come on let's just be honest
[1:04:24] you don't ever see good stories in the
[1:04:26] newspaper on tv anymore
[1:04:28] it's about this guy did this and this
[1:04:29] crook did this and this guy did this
[1:04:31] this guy did that but nobody wants to
[1:04:33] talk about the positive things
[1:04:35] why is it because it's run by the devil
[1:04:38] the devil's running politics the devil's
[1:04:40] running the news media the devil's
[1:04:42] running the world why our prophet said
[1:04:44] this is satan's eden
[1:04:46] satan is on the throne of man's heart
[1:04:49] satan is on the throne of this country's
[1:04:51] heart and he knows if he could ever get
[1:04:54] your attention on the negative that
[1:04:56] you'll never see the real you you'll
[1:04:59] never see what god's called you to do
[1:05:01] think about david if that went down
[1:05:03] there to battle goliath and all he could
[1:05:05] think about was how big goliath was
[1:05:08] come on
[1:05:10] everybody looks at these stories and i
[1:05:11] think sometimes we forget that
[1:05:14] these are real young people
[1:05:16] this was real people in the bible it
[1:05:18] isn't just a story written to make us
[1:05:20] happy
[1:05:21] he went through trials he went through
[1:05:23] tribulations he went through those but
[1:05:25] when he walked out on that battlefield
[1:05:27] he quit looking at the human side of
[1:05:29] things and he began to look at the
[1:05:31] impossible by jesus christ and he says
[1:05:33] but god you can do this
[1:05:36] if he would have walked up they're
[1:05:37] slinging that sling on this ain't going
[1:05:39] to work what would have happened
[1:05:42] not a thing
[1:05:44] as your heart thinketh so is it
[1:05:46] come on referring to scripture
[1:05:49] if you go into a battle and you go i'm
[1:05:51] going to get sick well praise god you're
[1:05:53] going to get sick
[1:05:54] you just went ahead and confessed what
[1:05:56] you're going to do
[1:05:57] well i'm going to lose this better well
[1:05:58] i guess i'll see you on the other side
[1:06:00] as a loser but if we start going into
[1:06:02] things like these people did in the
[1:06:04] bible and go you know what i can't do
[1:06:06] this
[1:06:08] the other hebrew children
[1:06:10] they would say we know how god can
[1:06:12] deliver us
[1:06:14] but if we don't we ain't going to serve
[1:06:16] anyone devil
[1:06:17] what if we've got some members of this
[1:06:18] proud members of this church that are
[1:06:20] standing up and say you know what devil
[1:06:22] i don't care if i lose i don't care if i
[1:06:24] win but i ain't going to serve you i'm
[1:06:26] not going to come to your level i'm not
[1:06:28] going to talk negativity no more i'm
[1:06:30] going to preach the truth i'm gonna talk
[1:06:32] to the positive things i'm gonna talk
[1:06:34] how great my god is
[1:06:39] i can come out there
[1:06:41] and tell one person
[1:06:43] a negative thought
[1:06:45] two weeks from now everybody in the
[1:06:46] church
[1:06:47] knows this
[1:06:49] i could come out there and tell 50
[1:06:51] people a positive thought and nobody'll
[1:06:53] share it
[1:06:55] come on let's just be honest
[1:06:57] let's be honest
[1:06:59] what does the word say you're an
[1:07:00] overcomer by the
[1:07:03] word of your testimony
[1:07:05] when's the last time a good testament to
[1:07:07] tell somebody
[1:07:08] when's the last time we felt comfortable
[1:07:10] enough to say hey let me tell you what
[1:07:12] god did because the devil's in the back
[1:07:14] of your mind going oh you know did he
[1:07:16] really do no let me tell you what god
[1:07:18] did for me let me tell you instead of
[1:07:21] let me tell you what the devil did to me
[1:07:23] instead of letting me tell you what he
[1:07:25] tripped me and stumbled into let me tell
[1:07:27] you god did for me
[1:07:29] he took me from the pits of hell he took
[1:07:31] me from the bottom of my sin he split me
[1:07:33] on a rock and he gave me what i had of
[1:07:37] amen
[1:07:39] saying never said you wouldn't go
[1:07:40] through it i quote in proving his word
[1:07:43] brother brendan speaking on the three
[1:07:45] hebrew children i love how he's high
[1:07:47] love how he words it
[1:07:49] proving his word now d64 he says now
[1:07:52] look
[1:07:53] he took the heat
[1:07:55] right out of the blaze of the fiery
[1:07:57] furnace
[1:07:58] to prove his word was so that he could
[1:08:01] deliver from the fire
[1:08:03] he didn't take the fire away
[1:08:08] the fire killed the other men that was
[1:08:09] unbelievers but he took the heat out of
[1:08:12] fire from the children of god look he
[1:08:15] ain't taking your trolls away he ain't
[1:08:16] taking your sickness away he ain't
[1:08:18] making life a comfort of ease for you on
[1:08:21] a pillow with nothing to go wrong but
[1:08:22] he's taking the pain of it away he's
[1:08:25] taking the negativity of it away he's
[1:08:27] taking all of the pad away and saying
[1:08:29] but my children are overcomers in this
[1:08:31] day when they face the impossibility
[1:08:34] they will
[1:08:36] overcome they will
[1:08:39] because he says right amongst those
[1:08:41] places there was children thrown in
[1:08:43] there stayed in there a long time and
[1:08:45] many of the men that throw them in the
[1:08:47] intense heat of that fiery furnace
[1:08:49] killed the great soldiers that was
[1:08:51] leading them up there and god let the
[1:08:54] fire burn right on
[1:08:56] but he took the heat out of it
[1:08:58] he proves if you stand for him he'll
[1:09:01] stand for you
[1:09:03] king will take your trial away because
[1:09:06] then he wouldn't be the god of the
[1:09:07] impossible
[1:09:09] you realize everything that he did and
[1:09:11] as simple as a thought as it may be
[1:09:13] every example he gave everything that he
[1:09:15] did everything that he said it has to be
[1:09:18] it has to come to pass
[1:09:20] it has to have but his words shall not
[1:09:22] be turned forward he said that there
[1:09:24] would be a bride in this day he said
[1:09:26] that bride
[1:09:28] would recognize who she was he said that
[1:09:31] bride would get behind the word of god
[1:09:33] and would stand on the word of god and
[1:09:35] she would be an overcomer in this day
[1:09:38] then you're going to do it
[1:09:40] it doesn't matter how hard he has to
[1:09:41] walk you it no matter how hard he's got
[1:09:43] to pull you it no matter how hard you
[1:09:45] gotta drag and kick and scratched and
[1:09:47] fingernails dug into the blood god's
[1:09:50] gonna get you to an altar god's gonna
[1:09:52] get you to a place that he can make the
[1:09:54] impossible when you come to life
[1:09:58] i'm in control of my life
[1:10:00] no you're not god's in control of your
[1:10:03] life
[1:10:04] you can't happen you can't there's
[1:10:06] nothing you can control when you leave
[1:10:08] and hit this road this scene
[1:10:10] you have no control
[1:10:12] so i have control of my car no you know
[1:10:14] where's the steering arm breaks what are
[1:10:16] you going to do
[1:10:17] you lost control
[1:10:19] what if a drunk driver comes across and
[1:10:20] hits your head on what are you going to
[1:10:22] do
[1:10:23] you're here by the mercies and the grace
[1:10:25] of god
[1:10:26] god is in control of every situation he
[1:10:28] knows what you're going to go there look
[1:10:30] we've heard the story time and time
[1:10:32] again but the devil couldn't take job to
[1:10:34] the point of the ash sheep until he got
[1:10:36] approval from god
[1:10:38] god knew what job could handle god knows
[1:10:41] what you can handle and god is making
[1:10:43] the impossible inside of you this
[1:10:45] morning
[1:10:46] every situation you know what most
[1:10:48] churches just don't even want to have
[1:10:49] church anymore because they're afraid
[1:10:51] somebody might be around somebody you
[1:10:53] know what my god is a healer i believe
[1:10:56] in being wise i believe in being smart
[1:11:00] if you're sick and you've got a fever
[1:11:02] you should stay home
[1:11:05] but if you ain't to miss walmart you
[1:11:07] ain't sick enough from this church
[1:11:09] come on church
[1:11:11] we're living in a day that the devil's
[1:11:12] trying to put so many negative ups in
[1:11:14] you that you can go to walmart you can
[1:11:16] go to work you can go to the birthday
[1:11:18] party you can go to the graduation but
[1:11:20] i'm too sick to go to church
[1:11:24] that was free
[1:11:31] he's able to deliver us from the fiery
[1:11:33] furnace
[1:11:34] but nevertheless we're not buying to any
[1:11:36] image
[1:11:37] because we're standing
[1:11:39] on the word
[1:11:40] how does god make the impossible
[1:11:43] by having someone
[1:11:45] willing to stand on his word
[1:11:47] by having someone living in this day to
[1:11:49] turn around and say
[1:11:51] god i don't know how it's
[1:11:52] going gonna happen but
[1:11:54] i believe your word
[1:11:56] i believe you sent a prophet in our day
[1:11:59] i believe you sinned as something what
[1:12:00] is it jesus you're everything to me
[1:12:03] jesus you're more to me than my job
[1:12:06] jesus you're more to me than my family
[1:12:09] jesus you're more to me than the very
[1:12:11] heir that i believe jesus you're more to
[1:12:14] me than all that i have i want you
[1:12:16] to be number one
[1:12:18] in my life
[1:12:21] look everybody's got a number one in
[1:12:23] their life i just pray that it's him
[1:12:25] we all got something that will drop
[1:12:27] forward no matter what and we should we
[1:12:29] should respect our pastor we should
[1:12:30] respect our church we should respect our
[1:12:32] family we all should work and provide
[1:12:36] for
[1:12:37] our
[1:12:38] family but
[1:12:40] david had a job to do
[1:12:42] feed his brothers
[1:12:43] but when he got on the scene everybody
[1:12:44] else was cowards
[1:12:46] everybody else was looking at all the
[1:12:47] negativity and god brought him up
[1:12:50] and created the impossible
[1:12:53] in him
[1:12:54] daniel and the lions then i thought of a
[1:12:56] thought and i probably read it somewhere
[1:12:58] it ain't
[1:12:59] anything i think it's not not not uh
[1:13:01] original because i've probably read it
[1:13:03] or seen it but
[1:13:04] you know what
[1:13:05] i thought daniel
[1:13:07] did exactly what god told him to do
[1:13:10] you know what is coming to a day in our
[1:13:11] time that they're going to start wanting
[1:13:13] to close that church door they're going
[1:13:15] to start wanting to tell you you can't
[1:13:16] worship in the name of jesus no more
[1:13:18] they're going to want to tell you that
[1:13:20] there ain't no other way that you've got
[1:13:21] to join the mother church and join the
[1:13:23] church yourself as what but yet daniel
[1:13:25] was in that same boat and then he says
[1:13:27] no my god told me to be in face
[1:13:30] jerusalem
[1:13:31] and i'm gonna keep doing what god and
[1:13:33] you know what it cost him what everybody
[1:13:35] else thought it cost him his life
[1:13:37] because the punishment was the lines
[1:13:39] then
[1:13:40] look at what they throw him in the lines
[1:13:41] then you know what happened
[1:13:43] it didn't wasn't the lion's den no more
[1:13:45] it was daniel's den
[1:13:46] the lions were just there
[1:13:48] daniel took control of the situation
[1:13:52] they throwed him into the deepest pit
[1:13:54] they throw him into the lion's den they
[1:13:55] were so hungry they would have naughty
[1:13:57] within seconds to nothing but yet when
[1:14:00] daniel a servant of god the god of jesus
[1:14:03] christ the jesus christ that makes
[1:14:05] things impossible become possible
[1:14:08] stepped on the scene now it's daniel's
[1:14:10] then
[1:14:11] and now all the lines was there for it
[1:14:12] was just for company
[1:14:14] yo daniel would have been lonely if you
[1:14:15] didn't nobody talked to you all night
[1:14:18] look he had to have somebody on that
[1:14:19] hill maybe he petted his mind and said
[1:14:21] yo boy
[1:14:23] come on
[1:14:25] you know what there was no fear in
[1:14:26] daniel because god that daniel was
[1:14:29] serving the god of the impossible
[1:14:31] and there's no fear in the bride of
[1:14:33] christ today because we're serving that
[1:14:36] same god the god of the impossible and
[1:14:39] so when he throws us into a pit we take
[1:14:41] control of the situation
[1:14:43] because every demon shall bow at the
[1:14:46] name of jesus because every spirit shall
[1:14:49] bow at the name of jesus why he's
[1:14:51] already conquered death hell in the
[1:14:53] grave and there's nothing standing
[1:14:55] before him and if that same god is now
[1:14:58] living in a bride and she and he is then
[1:15:01] she has no fear of this world
[1:15:04] look when you walk into a situation you
[1:15:06] shouldn't drop your head and shrug and
[1:15:07] walk off defeated
[1:15:09] you should stand up and be proud of who
[1:15:11] you are
[1:15:12] you stand up you don't want to happen
[1:15:14] they'll start respecting you like the
[1:15:15] scripture we read says
[1:15:17] they'll start confessing their language
[1:15:19] will start changing you stand for god
[1:15:22] you act for god you live for god you let
[1:15:25] your life betray christ and those that
[1:15:27] are around you will begin to change and
[1:15:30] to testify that there's something about
[1:15:33] this name
[1:15:34] their language starts changing
[1:15:36] the jokes they tell begin to change
[1:15:38] what is i'm not saying they've become
[1:15:40] christians and getting good good to two
[1:15:42] shoes but you know what there's a change
[1:15:44] in that atmosphere why because you take
[1:15:47] control
[1:15:48] of that situation
[1:15:49] because you step in and realize the
[1:15:51] power that you have you still didn't
[1:15:53] realize the authority that you have as
[1:15:55] the bride of christ that you take
[1:15:57] everything on new subjects and you say
[1:15:59] this is now
[1:16:01] mighty
[1:16:02] this is now my city this is now my room
[1:16:05] this is now my job play
[1:16:08] now we're going to come to my level
[1:16:12] what was it the impossible
[1:16:15] but jesus christ you say oh that's
[1:16:16] impossible that's why we can't do it
[1:16:19] but he can do it
[1:16:21] but he can do it and he uses you to do
[1:16:23] it so many times we want to humble down
[1:16:26] and just act like look look we need to
[1:16:27] understand the real definition of humble
[1:16:30] humble ain't cowarding down and walking
[1:16:31] out on the devil
[1:16:34] humble is realizing i can't do it
[1:16:36] but greater is he that's in me
[1:16:38] than he that's in the world and that one
[1:16:41] by the name of jesus christ he can do it
[1:16:44] when i don't have words i look at
[1:16:45] description the scripture says think not
[1:16:48] of what to say
[1:16:49] i'll speak for you
[1:16:51] when i don't know what to do i'll think
[1:16:52] you know what i don't know what to do
[1:16:54] but god what do you want me to do do you
[1:16:56] want me to sing if you do you want me to
[1:16:58] worship you do you want me just to sit
[1:17:00] there and bow humbly and pray before you
[1:17:03] god you lead my life
[1:17:06] see that's why each and every one of
[1:17:07] these examples
[1:17:10] had an overcoming end
[1:17:13] the three hebrew children wasn't worried
[1:17:14] about how great they was going to be
[1:17:17] they was worried about how great their
[1:17:18] god was going to look
[1:17:21] david wasn't worried about how great
[1:17:22] david didn't even want to be king he was
[1:17:24] anointed king but he didn't want to be
[1:17:26] king
[1:17:27] but yet he knew that if he yielded
[1:17:29] himself god could do something with him
[1:17:32] church tonight this morning if the bride
[1:17:35] of christ can never come to full
[1:17:36] realization that if we yield ourselves
[1:17:40] look we're full of native thoughts we're
[1:17:42] humans
[1:17:43] look you take a hammer and smash your
[1:17:45] nail you ain't happy about it
[1:17:47] you're driving down the road and
[1:17:48] somebody cuts you off and you have slim
[1:17:49] on your brakes you ain't happy about it
[1:17:51] we got negative thoughts
[1:17:53] but yeah there's something inside of us
[1:17:55] that should rise up and say but all
[1:17:57] things work together
[1:17:58] for them that love the lord jesus
[1:18:01] i'm just here i'm just an example i'm
[1:18:03] just an example in his story of one that
[1:18:06] could come joseph in the pit genesis 33
[1:18:09] we know the story so well but joseph is
[1:18:11] thrown into a pit and having it it is
[1:18:14] nothing of his own doing
[1:18:16] you know what's wrong with the church
[1:18:17] today every time we see somebody
[1:18:19] backslide we think they did something
[1:18:20] wrong
[1:18:21] we said somebody's sick we think they
[1:18:23] did something wrong god's punishing them
[1:18:25] no god's probably just using them to be
[1:18:27] the next story in his book the
[1:18:29] impossible by jesus christ
[1:18:32] we looked and said oh they must have
[1:18:34] missed god because you know what they
[1:18:36] lost their job no
[1:18:37] ain't got nothing to do with that they
[1:18:39] may be doing exactly what god called
[1:18:41] them to do they may be standing on the
[1:18:43] exact tree and the devil says i can take
[1:18:45] him and god says you can't touch them
[1:18:47] and he allows things to happen what was
[1:18:50] it joseph was chosen of god joseph was
[1:18:53] blessed of god joseph could interpret
[1:18:55] dreams joseph could see things and give
[1:18:57] visions and he was just doing what god
[1:19:00] taught him to do and it brought by
[1:19:01] hatred in his brothers come on church
[1:19:04] look at our own lives how many times has
[1:19:06] it hatred up in our families
[1:19:10] just because we do what god tells us to
[1:19:13] do
[1:19:13] they said we don't understand why you
[1:19:15] have to worship like that we don't
[1:19:16] understand why you have to feel like
[1:19:18] you've got to go to church no matter
[1:19:19] what's going on why because there's
[1:19:21] something inside of me that wants to
[1:19:23] worship him there's something inside of
[1:19:25] me that wants to give my life to him it
[1:19:27] makes those around us angry
[1:19:33] i laugh
[1:19:34] sometimes my own family sometimes
[1:19:37] they know sunday morning i'm going to be
[1:19:39] in church and they'll schedule something
[1:19:41] at 11 o'clock on sunday morning
[1:19:44] well i'm not going to be there
[1:19:46] i mean it's that simple i'm going to be
[1:19:48] at church you know i'm going to be
[1:19:49] church so the way i view it is you must
[1:19:52] really not want me there
[1:19:54] come on
[1:19:56] because that's where my life is
[1:19:58] my number one is jesus christ my number
[1:20:01] one is serving him my number one is
[1:20:04] letting me be humble enough that he can
[1:20:06] use me as a witness to my family as a
[1:20:09] witness to the world that there is a
[1:20:11] living jesus christ in our lives today
[1:20:15] could you imagine david
[1:20:17] if his wife were to come to him and says
[1:20:18] hey instead of going to church tonight
[1:20:20] we're going to go play hockey
[1:20:22] come on
[1:20:25] david would have laughed at her
[1:20:26] because david had a heart after god
[1:20:30] and he knew he wanted to be like god
[1:20:32] knew everything's tried around him but
[1:20:34] what are some of our excuses come on
[1:20:36] church
[1:20:36] come on don't leave me now come on what
[1:20:39] is someone very well my family's in for
[1:20:41] the weekend well they come church with
[1:20:42] me i don't care we got pews extra bring
[1:20:45] the church with you
[1:20:46] maybe they're the last one maybe there's
[1:20:48] somebody there that needs to hear the
[1:20:50] word of god maybe there's somebody there
[1:20:52] that needs to feel the spirit move
[1:20:56] but when we coward down to them
[1:20:58] we look like the loser
[1:21:01] and we lose our testimony
[1:21:03] come up church
[1:21:04] we're living in a day
[1:21:06] god needs real men and daughters son and
[1:21:08] daughters of god to stand up and stand
[1:21:10] on his word
[1:21:12] to say you know what there's nothing
[1:21:14] more important to me
[1:21:16] than hearing from my king
[1:21:18] there's nothing of greater importance
[1:21:20] than hearing look look we got all week
[1:21:22] to do everything we want to do i don't
[1:21:23] know why we got on that maybe somebody's
[1:21:25] struggling with it
[1:21:27] we got all week to do what we need to do
[1:21:30] we got church which means we don't say
[1:21:31] anymore
[1:21:33] if we can't give that to him we need
[1:21:35] help
[1:21:37] look back when i was a kid we used to
[1:21:38] have week-long meetings
[1:21:40] and you know what people took off of
[1:21:42] work all week
[1:21:43] so that they could make sure the grass
[1:21:45] was cut they could make sure the tent
[1:21:47] pose was tight they could make sure that
[1:21:49] the platform was clean they could make
[1:21:51] sure the trash was took out they could
[1:21:52] make sure that they could come before
[1:21:54] two hours early and pray and get the
[1:21:56] spirit right for service that night
[1:21:58] i do not see revivals no more because we
[1:22:00] don't have time for revivals
[1:22:03] but god is the elect he is the god of
[1:22:06] the impossible in this day when the day
[1:22:08] when the world don't want nothing new
[1:22:10] with it there's still a bride that wants
[1:22:12] more of him there's still a bride that
[1:22:14] wants to hear
[1:22:16] more important than anything
[1:22:18] but see joseph found himself in that pit
[1:22:21] of nothing of his own doing
[1:22:24] his brothers got mad and threw him in a
[1:22:26] pit look a lot of times our families get
[1:22:28] mad
[1:22:29] and throw us in a pit
[1:22:31] it may not be a pit of a whale or a pit
[1:22:33] of a stone but they push us outside and
[1:22:35] we're the black sheep of the family
[1:22:36] because we won't do this and we won't
[1:22:38] partake in this and we're becoming a pit
[1:22:40] in our lives and the devil attacks our
[1:22:42] minds and he attacks our spirits he says
[1:22:45] see if you would just give in a little
[1:22:47] bit you could be more loved
[1:22:49] i don't want to be loved to this world i
[1:22:51] want to be loved of jesus christ
[1:22:54] when he rounded himself in that pit he
[1:22:56] didn't start thinking what could i have
[1:22:57] done different he began to think oh god
[1:22:59] here i am lord what do you want me to do
[1:23:01] here
[1:23:02] come on children of god it was the act
[1:23:05] of the impossible becoming
[1:23:07] impossible by our lord
[1:23:10] jesus christ and he's the same one today
[1:23:12] as he was in that day when you get in
[1:23:14] your pit he's looking to make that pit
[1:23:17] his platform so the world can see there
[1:23:20] is a living god today
[1:23:23] took him out of that pit
[1:23:24] taking egypt
[1:23:27] and he wound up in a jail cell
[1:23:30] not of his own doing again
[1:23:33] come on children of god
[1:23:34] we end up in a lot of places not of our
[1:23:37] own doings
[1:23:38] we wind up in a lot of places not
[1:23:40] because we did something wrong not
[1:23:42] because we're a failure in god's side
[1:23:44] but because the world hates us
[1:23:46] look joseph was important for us how
[1:23:48] joseph was there and he was making
[1:23:50] everything perfect
[1:23:53] and they was jealous
[1:23:56] as follows his wife says
[1:23:58] i'm going to take him down
[1:24:00] she tried to take him down and all she
[1:24:03] did was make him greater
[1:24:05] come on that's what happens to us every
[1:24:07] time the devil tries to take you down
[1:24:09] all he does is make your testimony
[1:24:11] greater every time he tries to put you
[1:24:13] in a jail put you in a pit put you in a
[1:24:15] backsliding condition all he's doing is
[1:24:18] making your testimony greater because
[1:24:21] there's an exit to that jail cell
[1:24:23] because god had already ordained
[1:24:25] american to have a dream and need a
[1:24:27] dream interpreter and he had daniel
[1:24:30] sitting in that jail still waiting to
[1:24:32] interpret that dream but what kind of
[1:24:34] influence was he in that jail
[1:24:37] look we know the scripture right
[1:24:39] it was a man that was in jail with him
[1:24:42] that topham hall
[1:24:44] i know a man
[1:24:46] how did he know him because he watched
[1:24:47] his life
[1:24:48] he saw him in the jail cell every day
[1:24:50] bound with chains
[1:24:52] and he didn't drop his head in the fence
[1:24:54] he got up every morning and he prayed to
[1:24:56] his god
[1:24:57] he got up on his seat and he throwed his
[1:24:58] hands up as high as he could and began
[1:25:00] to worship god and that man seemed for
[1:25:02] something different than joseph than all
[1:25:05] the other males
[1:25:06] they began to see there's something in
[1:25:08] him why because the god of the
[1:25:10] impossible was in life
[1:25:13] and he took him out and put him on a
[1:25:14] high place and you know the story what
[1:25:16] was it every pit that he went in became
[1:25:19] a platform for him to stand now it
[1:25:21] became a witness and an evidence it
[1:25:23] became something to the world to see the
[1:25:25] god of elijah the god of jesus jesus
[1:25:28] himself is living in a vessel now and
[1:25:30] it's the same for you and i everything
[1:25:33] that we go through every fight that we
[1:25:35] go through every trial that we go
[1:25:37] through is nothing more than us climbing
[1:25:39] the ladder getting closer to his
[1:25:41] likeness
[1:25:42] come on
[1:25:44] what is it
[1:25:46] even as they set him off and they sold
[1:25:48] him
[1:25:49] he began to boss for his life again
[1:25:51] you ever noticed every time the world
[1:25:52] kicks you down god gives you something a
[1:25:55] little extra
[1:25:56] you know why because it's in his word
[1:25:58] he says when the enemy comes in like a
[1:26:00] high tide he'll raise a standard
[1:26:03] against that
[1:26:04] every time you don't think you can go
[1:26:06] home and situation looks impossible he
[1:26:08] brings a standard
[1:26:10] a little higher
[1:26:11] he runs away me and it just picks you
[1:26:13] right on up
[1:26:14] is she a little closer to him what he's
[1:26:16] looking
[1:26:17] what is he to you this morning
[1:26:20] you know i jotted down several things
[1:26:21] here
[1:26:23] what is it to you brother brown hit
[1:26:25] several of these and and i just took
[1:26:27] them and added to them
[1:26:29] he says he is the rock
[1:26:31] of my salvation
[1:26:33] acts 4 and 12
[1:26:35] is that he's the rock of my salvation
[1:26:38] look jesus is the rock of my salvation
[1:26:41] not the cloud not the bridge
[1:26:44] you know why so many people fall away
[1:26:45] from the messages just they've never
[1:26:47] been the rock
[1:26:48] their rock was the cloud
[1:26:50] and when people come against the cloud
[1:26:51] they didn't have nothing to fall back on
[1:26:54] their rock was the bridge
[1:26:55] and when they started coming against the
[1:26:57] bridge they didn't have nothing to fall
[1:26:58] back on
[1:26:59] but there's the bride of christ that the
[1:27:01] rock of her salvation is jesus christ
[1:27:04] they can't do nothing with him they've
[1:27:06] tried for two thousand plus years and
[1:27:08] they can't no fault in him he was the
[1:27:11] perfect one he didn't have no
[1:27:12] misjudgments he didn't have no
[1:27:14] wrongdoing and if your rock is in him
[1:27:16] then you cannot fail
[1:27:19] what is it he's my healer you're sick
[1:27:21] this morning he's your healer he took
[1:27:23] your strides for your healing he's going
[1:27:25] to give it to you if you're accepted
[1:27:26] this morning he's my burden i mean he's
[1:27:29] had burdens before i've got burdens now
[1:27:32] there's things in this life that weighs
[1:27:33] us down but he's my burden bearer the
[1:27:36] god of the impossible is here amongst us
[1:27:38] today what is it he is my freedom
[1:27:41] do you hear the sister sing this song
[1:27:43] i know what freedom is now you know what
[1:27:46] i never really knew about freedom i
[1:27:47] thought freedom was serving the devil i
[1:27:49] thought freedom was drink it all i
[1:27:51] wanted to drink smoking all the dope
[1:27:53] that i wanted to smoke i thought
[1:27:54] freedom's doing what i wanted to do but
[1:27:57] i was nothing but a chain addict to the
[1:27:59] devil but i know what freedom is now why
[1:28:02] because jesus christ gave me freedom he
[1:28:05] is my freedom
[1:28:07] and whom believeth on him he shall set
[1:28:10] free
[1:28:11] he is my god he come to me in psalms 48
[1:28:14] he says
[1:28:15] david speaking he says for this god is
[1:28:17] our god forever and ever
[1:28:20] and he will be our god even unto death
[1:28:24] even unto death you know what if the
[1:28:27] doctor say covet takes you god will
[1:28:28] steal your god even unto death if god's
[1:28:31] again the doctor said cancer takes you
[1:28:33] cancer didn't take it over didn't take
[1:28:35] it god took you because god is in
[1:28:37] control of your life god knows when it's
[1:28:40] your time and you cannot go until it's
[1:28:42] your time
[1:28:44] god is in control
[1:28:45] under my death god is still my god he is
[1:28:48] my life
[1:28:49] john 14 19 says yet in a little while
[1:28:51] the world sees me no more but ye see me
[1:28:55] because i live you also shall live
[1:28:58] and what jesus seen this day approaching
[1:29:01] he seen a day approaching that they
[1:29:02] would look away from jesus christ they
[1:29:05] would look away from the word of god
[1:29:07] that they would look to their traditions
[1:29:08] they would look
[1:29:10] to their creeps they would even talk
[1:29:12] about look there's more christians
[1:29:14] professed in the world today than
[1:29:16] there's ever been but there's less
[1:29:18] church members than there's ever been
[1:29:20] how does that work out
[1:29:22] i had a brother tell me here the other
[1:29:23] day that was raised in this message same
[1:29:26] as me went to the same church believe
[1:29:28] the way i believe and he says i am the
[1:29:29] church i don't have to go to church no
[1:29:31] more
[1:29:32] where does that nonsense come from
[1:29:36] i told one sister she told me she said
[1:29:38] she said just because you go to church
[1:29:39] don't make me a christian
[1:29:41] because that's true
[1:29:43] i said i'm a mechanic by trade
[1:29:45] just because you have a mechanics
[1:29:47] toolbox don't make you a mechanic
[1:29:49] she goes yeah that's my point and i go
[1:29:51] well let me tell you something
[1:29:53] every good mechanic's got a mechanics
[1:29:54] toolbox
[1:29:55] and every good church goes to church
[1:29:59] come on
[1:30:01] if you're a good christian you're going
[1:30:02] to go to church why because brother
[1:30:04] brenda said it's according to david he
[1:30:06] comes he says let us rejoice to know
[1:30:09] that we've been in the presence of the
[1:30:11] lord how do you come to the prison you
[1:30:13] can't wait to come to church when the
[1:30:14] church door is open there comes
[1:30:16] something inside of you you don't care
[1:30:18] how many non-believers are there you
[1:30:19] don't care how many make believers there
[1:30:21] but you know you're a real believer and
[1:30:23] you're going to be in the house of god
[1:30:25] to worship this morning
[1:30:27] what is it he's my savior
[1:30:29] for whosoever my name shall be saved
[1:30:32] what he should be all in all he should
[1:30:34] be everything us god uses every example
[1:30:37] we got so many examples we can use but
[1:30:39] he got so many examples of the
[1:30:41] impossible situation
[1:30:46] and he takes control he moves in their
[1:30:49] life
[1:30:50] what is our commission
[1:30:51] mark 16
[1:30:53] we know the scripture
[1:30:55] and he said unto them go into all the
[1:30:56] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:30:58] creature
[1:30:59] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:31:01] be saved
[1:31:03] and he that believeth not shall be
[1:31:04] downed and these shine shall follow them
[1:31:07] that believe in my name shall they cast
[1:31:10] out devils they shall speak with new
[1:31:12] tongues they shall take up servants
[1:31:14] serpents shall drink any anything it
[1:31:16] shall not hurt them
[1:31:18] they shall lay the hands on the sick
[1:31:20] and they shall
[1:31:22] recall
[1:31:23] in 2022 he's still the same god
[1:31:26] of the impossible
[1:31:28] look i don't care what you're going
[1:31:30] through this morning i don't care what
[1:31:31] sickness you may have i don't care what
[1:31:33] situation you may be in i don't care
[1:31:35] what fights you may be in with the devil
[1:31:37] with your family with whoever god is in
[1:31:39] control
[1:31:41] of every situation
[1:31:43] god's seen what tomorrow holds before
[1:31:45] you ever wake up in the morning
[1:31:48] he knows what you're going through and
[1:31:50] he cares about you
[1:31:53] but do we care about him
[1:31:56] god scripture signs at the time 1964
[1:31:58] brother brennan says say for instance
[1:32:00] there's a policeman you've heard this
[1:32:02] story
[1:32:03] there's a policeman standing out there
[1:32:05] in the street and he weighs 110 pounds
[1:32:08] and he comes in a whole row of traffic
[1:32:10] 80 miles an hour 300 horsepower engines
[1:32:13] in them and there was buzzing down that
[1:32:14] street 300 horsepower engines why that
[1:32:17] little fella doesn't stand a chance
[1:32:19] he doesn't have the power to stop one of
[1:32:22] them
[1:32:23] but just let that bad shine and he
[1:32:25] raised his hand and listened to all the
[1:32:27] brake squeal and watched him slide
[1:32:28] sideways it isn't the power that stops
[1:32:31] him it's the authority in that batch
[1:32:33] come on children of god
[1:32:35] you can't do it on your own but
[1:32:38] when you
[1:32:39] step into it again when daniel stepped
[1:32:42] into that dean of lions that authority
[1:32:44] that he had took control of the
[1:32:46] situation when you step into that
[1:32:48] situation you take control because of
[1:32:51] what is inside of you not because of
[1:32:53] your frail body not because of your
[1:32:55] mistakes not because of all your
[1:32:56] misdoing but because that bad honor that
[1:33:00] badge of the holy spirit that you have
[1:33:02] living in your life it takes control of
[1:33:04] every situation
[1:33:06] he said and the church has an authority
[1:33:08] from jesus christ in my name they should
[1:33:10] cast out devils they just speak with
[1:33:13] tongues they shall take up serpents they
[1:33:15] should drink of any deadly things it is
[1:33:17] not harming them he said if they lay
[1:33:18] their hands on the sick they will
[1:33:20] recover
[1:33:22] you believe that this morning
[1:33:24] then you know what why do we stop doing
[1:33:26] it
[1:33:27] if you're sick they that lay hands upon
[1:33:29] them they shall recover
[1:33:31] why because we lose confidence in him
[1:33:34] we look at ourselves we look at the
[1:33:35] negativity we look at our friends what
[1:33:38] if david would have looked at all of his
[1:33:39] mistakes
[1:33:41] and not looked at the promise
[1:33:43] come on david a man after god's own
[1:33:44] heart but yet he made a mistake after
[1:33:47] saying kept a mistake after mistake come
[1:33:49] on what about samsung i've been using
[1:33:51] simpson a lot here lately because you
[1:33:52] know what i see simpson in the day look
[1:33:55] i'm not going to throw off on youth
[1:33:56] meetings i'm a believer in youth
[1:33:58] meetings but i'll see sent some
[1:34:00] parallery to the day that we're living
[1:34:02] in they get to a good emotion they get
[1:34:04] to a good feeling but then they go right
[1:34:06] back home and go right back to the thing
[1:34:07] that the devil's dragging them away from
[1:34:10] we need a true salvation in a young
[1:34:12] person's heart not any emotional feeling
[1:34:15] but we need something to root in and
[1:34:17] take that old man out and let a new man
[1:34:20] be born in them
[1:34:22] samson's problem was simpson kept going
[1:34:24] back to the lie why because his flesh
[1:34:27] kept lusting after delilah and he would
[1:34:29] get an experience what do you mean he
[1:34:31] would get up and he would break up the
[1:34:33] pillars and the gates and he'd walk him
[1:34:35] up on the hill with the power of god all
[1:34:37] over him
[1:34:39] but then he would turn and go right back
[1:34:40] to that sin
[1:34:42] come on
[1:34:43] if we're not careful we do the same
[1:34:44] thing today we get to a good church
[1:34:47] service we get to a good youth meeting
[1:34:48] we get to a good revival we get an
[1:34:50] emotional breakthrough but then we turn
[1:34:52] and we go right back to that sin
[1:34:55] come on we don't need that repetition in
[1:34:57] the love today we need soul saving power
[1:35:00] from the name of jesus christ we need
[1:35:02] the old man to die
[1:35:06] the god of the impossible
[1:35:09] he said
[1:35:10] he can't do it in young people today
[1:35:11] that's a lie
[1:35:13] because i've got a i've got more young
[1:35:15] people than i can name
[1:35:16] that's got a true feeling of the holy
[1:35:18] spirit
[1:35:19] you know are they perfect no but i'm not
[1:35:21] perfect so who am i to judge come on
[1:35:24] come on i know that's hard
[1:35:26] i know it's hard and it gets on our toes
[1:35:28] whenever because you know what we want
[1:35:30] to sit back and go
[1:35:32] i've been in the message 30 years i
[1:35:33] could tell you if you got the holy ghost
[1:35:34] no you can't
[1:35:36] the only person knows if they got the
[1:35:37] holy ghost is you
[1:35:39] is you
[1:35:40] you knowing yourself whether you got it
[1:35:42] or not there are no other man alive can
[1:35:43] tell you you haven't already got it
[1:35:45] if they try to they're speaking like the
[1:35:47] devil
[1:35:48] get away from them
[1:35:51] come on
[1:35:53] because we're living in a day of such
[1:35:54] deception
[1:35:56] we're living in a day where men's trying
[1:35:58] to make themselves god but it isn't men
[1:36:00] it's jesus
[1:36:02] christ
[1:36:04] he is the one i worship
[1:36:06] he is the one i see
[1:36:08] he said oh now the church has that
[1:36:09] authority
[1:36:10] he said what is it he said now he said
[1:36:13] it's the same little polishman if he's
[1:36:15] afraid to raise his hand and step out in
[1:36:18] traffic
[1:36:20] come on
[1:36:21] he knows what that badge represents but
[1:36:24] what if he's afraid to step out and go
[1:36:26] stop
[1:36:28] they ain't worth wearing the badge
[1:36:31] they're not going to keep him on four
[1:36:33] slots probably gonna put him in dispatch
[1:36:35] because when the heat gets good he can
[1:36:37] take it
[1:36:39] what's his brother say he goes and he
[1:36:40] says now look he says
[1:36:42] he says the same little opponent is
[1:36:44] afraid to raise his hand and step out in
[1:36:46] traffic he'd better take off the uniform
[1:36:49] present the badge back because he'll
[1:36:51] never make a polishman
[1:36:53] he says neither will we ever make a
[1:36:56] believer as long as we're afraid to
[1:36:59] exercise that authority
[1:37:01] he said that's been given to us by jesus
[1:37:04] christ we have the victory we don't have
[1:37:07] any other we don't have any fight for
[1:37:08] the victory we already have the victory
[1:37:11] he conquered it for us not us but he
[1:37:14] conquered it first we're not the mighty
[1:37:16] conqueror he's a mighty conqueror when i
[1:37:20] step into a situation if i don't have
[1:37:22] the gumption if i don't have the faith
[1:37:25] to step out and say he that is within me
[1:37:28] is greater than your devil
[1:37:31] makes me a pretty weak believer
[1:37:33] but god's looking for stern soldiers
[1:37:36] he's looking for those that we read of
[1:37:38] in the bible that we look in the example
[1:37:40] he looking for him in 2022 for young
[1:37:42] people for old people for middle-aged
[1:37:44] people he's looking for saints daughters
[1:37:46] sons of god to step out and say devil
[1:37:48] you're not coming this way
[1:37:51] devil this is my family i'm putting the
[1:37:53] token on my house i'm putting the token
[1:37:56] over my kids i'm putting the token over
[1:37:58] my loved ones i'm believing in the name
[1:38:00] of jesus christ the god of the
[1:38:02] impossible that all things but you don't
[1:38:05] know how far my kids this way i don't
[1:38:07] care how far they sway you put them
[1:38:09] under the blood of jesus christ and he
[1:38:11] can make the impossible seem real
[1:38:15] he can make the impossible will
[1:38:20] joshua 10.
[1:38:23] look
[1:38:26] moses done gone off the scene
[1:38:28] i bet you joshua was a man just like
[1:38:30] many of us are
[1:38:31] he had thoughts
[1:38:33] prophet's gone
[1:38:35] come on children of god
[1:38:36] we gotta i mean look
[1:38:38] years ago we had to dig for a book but
[1:38:40] now we got every book in this church of
[1:38:42] every message every preached
[1:38:44] most of us has got it on our phones and
[1:38:46] ipads of every word that the prophet
[1:38:48] said at our fingertips
[1:38:50] right
[1:38:51] we what he said we have access to every
[1:38:54] bit of it
[1:38:56] but yet he's not on the scene
[1:38:59] and so it's easy
[1:39:00] to wonder what's he going to do
[1:39:03] verse 8 he says and the lord said unto
[1:39:05] joshua
[1:39:06] fear them not
[1:39:08] for i have delivered them into thy hand
[1:39:11] children of god this morning
[1:39:13] don't feel the enemy this morning
[1:39:15] the god of the impossible is with you
[1:39:18] the god of impossible
[1:39:21] is with you this morning
[1:39:23] he's standing there by your side
[1:39:25] waiting for you to realize
[1:39:27] you can't do it
[1:39:30] he's waiting for you to say god i can't
[1:39:32] do this
[1:39:34] moving my life
[1:39:36] god i can't handle this stress anymore
[1:39:38] moving my life i can't handle this
[1:39:41] sickness anymore
[1:39:42] in my life
[1:39:43] but as long as we try to be our own gods
[1:39:45] he's just sitting there
[1:39:47] waiting
[1:39:49] on you and i
[1:39:50] just say god
[1:39:52] was brother stephen sister gayle carroll
[1:39:55] sung this song for years and years
[1:39:57] little david said
[1:39:59] lord this battle is not mine
[1:40:01] i give it to them
[1:40:03] for it's yours lord
[1:40:05] because you are the god of the
[1:40:07] impossible i'm not
[1:40:10] look i can go through my life and i
[1:40:11] failed miserably
[1:40:13] but one day i realized
[1:40:16] god
[1:40:17] this ain't my fight
[1:40:19] this is your fight
[1:40:21] i've delivered them into my hand there
[1:40:23] are not a man of them stand before thee
[1:40:28] then joshua's faith then just speak
[1:40:29] joshua to the lord in that day in the
[1:40:31] lord delivered up the immorats before
[1:40:33] the children of israel
[1:40:34] and he said unto the side of israel's
[1:40:36] son
[1:40:38] stand still
[1:40:39] what happened
[1:40:41] joshua wasn't powerful enough to make
[1:40:43] that son stand still
[1:40:45] but the one in him
[1:40:47] the same jesus christ
[1:40:49] had power over everything look i'm
[1:40:51] coming to a close
[1:40:53] what is it
[1:40:54] today god fights our battles
[1:40:57] it's his book it's his story we are the
[1:40:59] actors playing the part
[1:41:02] the impossible by jesus christ what is
[1:41:04] it 1950 who is god brother said joshua
[1:41:07] stop the son is that true
[1:41:10] somebody said all things are possible
[1:41:12] with god nothing impossible he said but
[1:41:15] all things are possible to you also
[1:41:18] nothing impossible to them that believe
[1:41:21] all things are possible brought right
[1:41:22] down and made you if you just know who
[1:41:26] god is
[1:41:27] he said well i'm afraid that the church
[1:41:29] doesn't know the authority i'm afraid
[1:41:30] that the holy ghost when men doesn't
[1:41:32] realize their authority here or the
[1:41:34] authority that god has permitted to his
[1:41:36] church he says i give thee the kings of
[1:41:39] the kingdom whether you bind or whatever
[1:41:41] you bind on earth will be bound in
[1:41:43] heaven whatever you loose on earth shall
[1:41:44] be loosed i give you the power of
[1:41:47] servants over all kinds of ages over
[1:41:49] everything nothing shall harm you
[1:41:51] exercise your faith this morning let
[1:41:54] loose
[1:41:55] god have his wife he'll grant you that
[1:41:57] victory
[1:41:59] we sing victory is mine victory is mine
[1:42:02] you can't have a victory without a fight
[1:42:04] and the only way you're going to get
[1:42:05] that victory is exercise your faith
[1:42:10] look i preached a message he'll walk
[1:42:12] back at home and i titled it activate
[1:42:14] your faith
[1:42:15] you know how i got it is because it's
[1:42:18] simple things that create thoughts you
[1:42:19] know brother brennan preached thank you
[1:42:21] man's field for out of a pack of
[1:42:22] cigarettes
[1:42:23] okay so so don't criticize me because i
[1:42:25] think that's pretty good you know but uh
[1:42:28] we work on cummins engines and and then
[1:42:31] to to
[1:42:32] diag a cummins engine you need the
[1:42:34] proper software
[1:42:36] but once you have the proper software
[1:42:38] you have to have an activation code to
[1:42:40] activate it
[1:42:41] you can have all the software laptop but
[1:42:43] if you don't activate it it won't do you
[1:42:45] no good
[1:42:46] if you don't pay for that activation
[1:42:48] code and put that activation code it
[1:42:50] looks pretty it's got the pretty little
[1:42:52] c with comments written through
[1:42:54] it don't do you no good
[1:42:57] until you activate it
[1:42:59] we have the power
[1:43:01] of jesus christ inside of every one of
[1:43:03] us
[1:43:05] but if you don't activate it
[1:43:07] it does no good
[1:43:08] if you try to fight your own battles it
[1:43:10] does you no good
[1:43:12] you're going to fail
[1:43:13] you're going to get beaten you're going
[1:43:15] to get drugged through the muck through
[1:43:16] the mire of this day but if you're
[1:43:18] activated
[1:43:19] if you're exercising and just step out
[1:43:21] look that policeman that brother but i'm
[1:43:23] talking about when he steps out there he
[1:43:25] knows that he can't stop that drug
[1:43:29] but he knows that authority that's
[1:43:30] behind him too
[1:43:32] look when the devil takes you up against
[1:43:34] a wall you know you can't do nothing
[1:43:36] with him
[1:43:37] but you know who the real you is too
[1:43:38] come on
[1:43:40] john 14 says believe us there now that i
[1:43:43] am the father and the father in me
[1:43:46] and the words that i speak unto you i
[1:43:48] speak not of myself but the father that
[1:43:51] dwelleth in me he does the works
[1:43:54] he does the works
[1:43:55] believe me that i am the father and the
[1:43:57] father in me or else believe me for the
[1:43:59] work's sake verily verily i say unto
[1:44:02] thee he that believeth on me the work
[1:44:05] shall i do he shall also in greater work
[1:44:08] than these that he should do because i
[1:44:10] go into my father and whosoever you
[1:44:12] shall whatever you shall ask in my name
[1:44:15] that will i do in the
[1:44:18] fight
[1:44:20] and if you sure asked of anything in my
[1:44:22] name
[1:44:23] i would do it
[1:44:25] so
[1:44:25] that's so i've heard it a million times
[1:44:27] where are we going to start doing it
[1:44:29] let's build our faith morning let's
[1:44:31] encourage ourselves this morning to know
[1:44:33] the god of the impossible
[1:44:36] is still living in our midst today
[1:44:38] 61 paradox but brother says jesus did
[1:44:41] the works of his father because the
[1:44:43] father
[1:44:43] was in him
[1:44:45] that is why the works was done is
[1:44:47] because the father was in the sun do you
[1:44:50] believe that
[1:44:51] that in him he was he was the incarnated
[1:44:55] god do you believe that
[1:44:56] that the god of the father that which is
[1:44:58] the father of jesus christ the great
[1:45:00] spirit dwelleth in the fullness of his
[1:45:02] power in jesus christ which was the
[1:45:04] tabernacle of god made flesh dwelt on
[1:45:07] the earth presenting the word jesus was
[1:45:10] the word amen
[1:45:12] and the bible said in saint john chapter
[1:45:14] one first chapter he says in the in it
[1:45:16] was invisible now
[1:45:18] the word invisible until it became flesh
[1:45:21] and then the word become visible and
[1:45:23] through his sanctified death at calvary
[1:45:24] his resurrection possibly placed his
[1:45:27] church in that realm that same invisible
[1:45:30] god because
[1:45:32] come into the individual and make the
[1:45:34] word visible
[1:45:36] what is it we're getting to a higher
[1:45:38] level it's more than just coming to
[1:45:40] church it's more than just exercising
[1:45:42] our faith it's coming to the realization
[1:45:45] the same god that walked with christ on
[1:45:48] the sea of galilee the same god that
[1:45:50] walked with him when he healed the sick
[1:45:52] and he rose the dead is the same god
[1:45:55] that is now visible in a bride in her
[1:45:58] words not because she's doing it because
[1:46:00] he's doing it in her it's visible to the
[1:46:03] world and they shall confess every knee
[1:46:06] shall vow every tongue shall confess
[1:46:09] that jesus christ is lord white because
[1:46:12] of what you're doing
[1:46:14] because of what we're doing as the bride
[1:46:16] not because we're sitting there doing
[1:46:18] nothing not because we just jumped down
[1:46:20] because we got our heads held high we
[1:46:22] throw our hands up and we should go we
[1:46:24] always go to church we always praise the
[1:46:27] name we always got a good word to say
[1:46:29] somebody we always are willing to
[1:46:31] testify of the greatness and the
[1:46:32] goodness of god
[1:46:35] because he's become
[1:46:37] visible
[1:46:38] and you and i
[1:46:40] we've become one with him
[1:46:42] living in a day now that it's more than
[1:46:45] just saying you believe the bible
[1:46:48] it's more than just saying you believe
[1:46:50] there was a prophet sitting this day and
[1:46:51] i believe that's the prophet they were
[1:46:53] sent to us
[1:46:55] but it's now manifesting what that
[1:46:58] prophet said
[1:46:59] you can quote it all day long but if you
[1:47:01] can't live it something's not right
[1:47:05] you could say well brendon said this
[1:47:07] amen
[1:47:10] can you manifest it
[1:47:12] well i'm still struggling well praise
[1:47:13] god you're still struggling because that
[1:47:14] means you're trying
[1:47:16] but we're coming today to the fullness
[1:47:19] of him that we are the living image
[1:47:23] of god to the world
[1:47:25] more than just a story
[1:47:27] more than just some book written with
[1:47:29] fancy handwriting but we are
[1:47:31] that story
[1:47:34] amen musicians want to come i'll find a
[1:47:37] place to close
[1:47:40] 1960 the ever-present water from the
[1:47:43] rock
[1:47:44] he says that when you are saved
[1:47:46] god gives you faith to rise from the
[1:47:49] mark of the earth
[1:47:50] your faith overcomes the things of the
[1:47:52] world what is your faith
[1:47:55] your faith in the act that god has did
[1:47:57] in you to make you a son of god
[1:48:00] you quit your lying you quit your
[1:48:02] stealing you quit your drinking because
[1:48:04] your faith rises you above it amen
[1:48:08] he says and if you don't do it you don't
[1:48:10] have any faith
[1:48:11] and by the faith you are saved and
[1:48:13] through grace brother says as much as
[1:48:15] your faith will be relieved as much as
[1:48:18] your faith will be released that's how
[1:48:20] much power you have
[1:48:24] that's the level you're living on
[1:48:27] if you're comfortable just not drinking
[1:48:29] anymore
[1:48:30] then there's nothing else in there to
[1:48:32] take you higher
[1:48:34] but there's something in the bride that
[1:48:36] wants to be like him
[1:48:37] he said because you have in you dwells
[1:48:39] the power to make heavens and earth god
[1:48:41] dwells in you and you are sons and
[1:48:44] daughters god amen he said there you are
[1:48:46] but it's your faith jesus said according
[1:48:49] to your faith being unto you that

[1:49:25] path they began to lust for the
[1:49:27] fleshpots if they had stayed with the
[1:49:29] faith and believing god was pouring them
