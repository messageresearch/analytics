[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] please [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] this right morning uh [Music] psalms 39. almost 39. all the way [Music] is every man is is sure foreign you really think you are sometimes not according to the word of god you see that a lot of two men and women that put their all open their riches or the things they know how to do and don't put their hopes in anything else and you see them one day and they're everything time and yesterday their whole life falling apart put their trust trusted the wrong thing if you would turn with me to you uh john first john the fourth chapter i was thanking you you know there's a lot going on in our world but there's a lot of noise out there a lot of bad information you know i guess what you can see out there in the world in the natural sense there's so much this information out there in the world you know but i think of it this way if all the lying that has been done to us the last few years had been done 20 years ago you wouldn't have any other place to go to other than the source of all sources of information you had 30 years ago so you wouldn't know what the truth is or you wouldn't be able to find because there would have been no internet let's say or whatever we used to get our information so information about whether it's coded or anything else going on in the world you know we shouldn't be that way but the church has gone through the same thing essentially jesus wanted the same thing but all the different government scriptures on this fourth chapter believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets have gone out into the world and hereby we know the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is coming the flesh of god and you know that real revelation right there that's a true interpretation of the whole bible that you know who jesus christ is and what he means to you or to the world and then he goes on and says i never swear that confesses not to jesus christ has come into the flesh not of god and that is of antichrist wherever they have occurred that should come even now it's already in this in the world and here excuse me you're a year of god and little children and have overcome him i'll just read the first ten verses and you know there came a man of god out of jesus by the word of the lord on the battle jeroboam he made us he did a brainstem in at that time because he told his people to go worship here at this place when it was supposed to worship he goes on to burn inside and he cried against the altar in the word of iran and said oh although and he gave a sign the same day saying this spoke to hope the altar shall be read and the actual farmer shall be poured out it came to pass from king carabao and he heard the sayings of the men up the prophet told them that this was no good you know they burnt the offer and they consumed it they destroyed it but i'll jump down this is when the father was told not to go any other way and then another problem came from instead was he that god told you to do something he was just as important as moses was and he caused people to sin uh nathan was the same way there were numerous examples where people were given were given false information out for the people of god and it was as wrong but what i was thinking this morning the most important thing is that you do the right thing i i have a i think brad read this last week but if you go into your classroom this morning and it says it says keep you risen with christ this is the third shot for washington i mean i have numerous examples he chose to believe the false information knowing that elijah had told him that justice was coming to him because maybe he the word of the lord in the days of elijah the things they chose to believe that lie in scripture they told him what and that's really important that everything we are dependent upon having a relationship with jesus of jesus christ and it's reflecting now to the world when josiah is saying when christ who is our life shall appear and then shall you also appear with me in love and glory mortify therefore in your members which are upon the earth and it says our fornication and uncleanness and northern affection evil forgive my pronunciation commonness and covetousness which is a daughter for which say the wrath of god comes on the children and the thing i was thinking this morning you know everything out there in the world you know everything you'll see out there in the world will even [Music] this is what needs to be in the heart like the message of the hour of our bible because just by your saying this is the true word of god and if this is abiding in the heart meaning the life when you see all those things that are conquered by jesus christ this morning amen i'm standing in that little course all my hope is in jesus this morning if we could amend is in jesus oh thank god my yesterday's gone and all my sins are forgiven [Music] oh i've been washed by the blood once again this morning and all my hope is it jesus oh thank god my yesterday's gone and all my sins are forgiven [Music] amen you're glad you've been washed in the blood this morning well when i tossed on my scene [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] cause you've got one more [Music] and you've got one one more tear [Music] and one more curve [Music] amen oh don't let see your tears learn to smile through your fears hold your head up bye and give the world a smile oh just be faithful all the way oh it'll be worth it all someday cause it's all gonna be over after a while because [Music] and you got one more trial on your team [Music] well you can lay down your heavy load when you get home sing that last verse again oh don't let satan see your tears learn to smile through your ears hold your head up and give the world a smile oh just be faithful all the way oh it'll be worth it

i'm looking forward to spring i'm looking for looking forward that you know i can deal with 28 and above but you know below that i don't much care for it but amen we're going to have 50 30 so it's

but we always miss him everybody says good to have you amen amen praise the lord how's it going pretty good yeah all right well praise the lord amen that's good shall we bow our heads kind heavenly father we come before you lord jesus and we just want to thank you lord for this opportunity the privilege and the right to be able to gather together like this lord father we know that the devil doesn't like us being able to even have the rights to do this lord but we thank you father for it to be able to bring our leaks of fire together and to speak of you and to glorify you and as they sang that song just to glorify you lord jesus to magnify you lord that's what our hearts purpose is lord that's what our desire is lord to see you lifted up high and lifted up lord jesus lord to bring to say hey all hail king jesus all hail emmanuel king of kings and lord of lords biting morning star you're mean everything to us lord you're our breath you are sunshine you're our life your hope you're our strength your future lord your everything to us we ask god that you'll bless the reading of the word the meditation of our heart father bless the scripture as we read it lord we trust god that we'll just be right in line with what you want us to speak on this morning say what you once said lord come and do what you want to do father lord we welcome you just here this morning in our hearts and in our lives and we do thank you lord jesus for the covert seemingly kind of being over with amen and kind of seems to be in the background so lord we do thank you father for that thank you for everybody that's feeling well touch those that don't feel too good this morning ask god for healing bless the reading of the word now and lord as we try to expound father which i feel lord you've laid upon our heart to minister to your people this morning we asked lord jesus that you had opened my mouth lord to say the things that they need to hear and may the word father find a good ground may that seed find good ground lord jesus and bring forth a hundredfold we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and amen if you will turn your bibles if you will to the uh book of we'll go to the book of corinthians i think it's first corinthians amen with what's going on in the world today i just feel that to kind of go this direction and then we know that the world is certainly un it's kind of on edge isn't it it's just being shaken amen even the nato and the different countries all put together they really there's not too much they can do because everything's so interlocked that if they do something to russia they end up hurting themselves so they don't want to hurt themselves so they're not going to do anything you know and so it's had a real pickle so to speak you know and so anyway we i mean we just know that uh the world may be all shook up we but we don't have to be amen because we know that uh we we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken everything that can be shaken will be shaken amen but we receive his kingdom by god's grace that can't be shaken so first corinthians 11. verse 25 after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sub saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this two years after she drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and do drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many who are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world may god had his blessings to reading the words you can be seated this morning amen so we find this morning and amen it just it goes to show you that you know something i really love that the prophet has told us and that is that you know the word of god is just eternal and it all ties together isn't that right it all ties together and you can take well i'll take with a thought from this this morning and just see what the lord will have for us but just to show you that amen god is god is eternal and so is his word i want to take my thought out of the 28th verse this morning let a man but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup now down in verse 31 also it says for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged amen and i want to talk about examination examining ourselves that okay you can say amen it's all right it's not going to hurt my feelings amen that's how it works right you got to crank me up now amen praise the lord but examining ourself i like that not only examining ourselves but judging ourselves hey man you know what i i just maybe for a little sense of humor this morning the only thing i remember about you know taking an examination and you know you know most of time when you have an examination deal doctor i have wanted like a stethoscope right and then i had to tell my ass my wife this morning now a stethoscope is that but they listen to your heart with right yeah that's what that is okay so we got a stethoscope you know and then i remembered that the only time i remember ever buying a stethoscope is when i was uh i was i played a doctor for just a little while all right and i bought a static scope and all these other things and me and my wife when we were young and a little bit crazy we just had to have our kid at home we're gonna have a child at home forget about doctors right and so i bought this you know they taught me like i knew about the heartbeat i guess i wanted to hear the baby's heartbeat or something you know but anyway you know baby was fine and so forth and and you know it ended up i was you know i delivered the baby right well i'll tell you what let me tell you something no man never know deliver no baby she delivered baby i would just there would come right amen but anyway so i thought well you know it's just something else but listen and then what what's the second thing that happens another thing that a doctor do is you'll put this thing around your arm right and he'll check your blood pressure because how many knows that life stream it has to do with your life stream tommy i mean that the live stream is very very important and that's what we want to deal with and dwell on a little bit is that live stream i'm talking about the blood we know that the life is what in the blood now even your blood pressure doesn't tell you everything but if they really want to know what what what is wrong with you what do they do they will draw blood right because in that blood you'll find almost anything that's wrong with you or that you need or that you like it's all in that blood it depends on what's in that blood but now so you notice and i want to get into that for just a little bit because uh this is first of all i just want to kind of start out here with this thing about examination we know that we should examine ourselves and that that's what we come to church for isn't that right i believe it was in job that in job's time it says that israel and so forth that god to present themselves before the lord amen and so when we come to the house of god amen we come and we so to speak look in the mirror right this is god smear for us we look at ourselves and see what we look like see what we're like because this is our when i believe that it's very important that we examine ourself it's what we call my checking up time brother joe i may believe that it's checking up time and i thought about this scripture here it's the second scripture i thought about but uh you know i thought this is this is uh timely because even the prophet said that each month you know when we take this every time that we take the communion it is a time that you got to examine yourself we take it once a month so uh let me put this down a little bit micah so once a month we get to really search our heart you as we bow our heads and as we close our eyes and we begin to think about whether we're worthy to take of that cup whether we have lived a life worthy of drinking from that cup and drinking of that bread because if we drink unworthily we drink damnation to ourselves and it's a time that we take a good look at ourselves now let me just say this i truly believe that you know in all the faults that we have because even the prophet of god said every day we fall short every day we sin and if you just think about beginning to look at your faults it's a scary thing sometimes right you begin you could if you really get serious you just take a good look at what you really like right who you really are and what your life really brings and sometimes it can be scary you know because simply because perhaps you're not witnessing like you should or you're not on fire like you should and and so forth not that you're just suing outright sin but you're still falling short of really reaching out to souls and and doing what a lot of the gospel asks us to do amen and i like i'm i'm thankful for this that when you do look at yourself amen and you see your own faults and you see where you might the devil would try to tell you well you ain't no christian huh or you're not really worthy to go in the rapture you're not really raptured material and you're not really fit to live in heaven or or whatever whatever it might be the devil will give you all kinds of thoughts right but then you gotta take and you gotta begin to look and you gotta see where your lord brought you from you got to have an experience i mean you're going to have to have a place like a place where you drove down that stake and you made that commitment to god and god come and he changed your life he changed your desires amen now i don't know if everybody can do that but i can take you to the time and i can take you to the place where the lord saved me by his wonderful grace and i see how god has brought me through and has always carried me through how he's always been there and always in miracle after miracle i look at that and i realize lord i'm not what i want to be huh you know what our testimony would be this morning you can say amen are you not where you want to be you're not what you want to be you're not what you should be but thank god you're not what you are amen aren't you glad that you're not not what you was and that's what's happening and listen so let me just say this not just once a month we shouldn't just examine ourselves once the month what if you only took a shower once a month you just think like some of those folks that don't and you'd be like take a shower right and that's for our lives too isn't that right we can't stand stench on our life if you really do have something down here that wrong in you irritates you that wrong in you bothers you if it doesn't you're in a lot of trouble that means that you really aren't in a place to even examine yourself people don't like to examine themselves we are awesome we are 20 20 envisioners and examiners of others oh my let me just say this the devil will give you 20 20 vision when it comes to taking that some kind of a microscope and seeing everybody else's fault and it's only after the holy ghost comes that that fault of everybody else's blurs [Music] you can't really see everybody else's faults and all of a sudden your own faults get really big really magnified the holy ghost will show you your fault where you're not what you ought to be amen and then you realize brother glenn huh what's happening here huh how many fingers are pointing at you how many find that me you got it yeah it's these others i got three there's only one knowing that that's about the truth too you find out that there's a lot more pointing at you than what there is that the other person that's what god will do for you that's what all the holy ghosts will do for you amen let me talk about the time for just a little bit let me just read you a quote here like i wanted to brother baby makes a statement he says you remember church that you're living in the best day that you will ever live in right now until jesus comes it will gradually not gradually but rapidly get worse and worse folks haven't we seen that in the last eight years or so we've things you think go rapidly worse and worse huh think about it communism isn't over in russia it's our in our congress they want communism is what they want they want to let all our wicked prisoners out murderers they want them on the streets they don't want you to arrest nobody they want to let everybody go again don't take all the police away they don't want no police what what is that that is desiring destruction of that civilization huh where is all our other congressmen and so forth up there being a man like brother benham says stick up for something don't just be wishy-washy well if i say this about this person you know this this will happen no say what you need to say say what needs to be said amen but look this is the word we're living in and it'll rapidly get worse and worse this was in 57 the coming of the lord when russia goes down there to get that oil look out amen now i don't know if this is what this is i have no idea whether this is what this is all about but we know russia's on the move right and putin's mad right he's furious can you imagine uh atheistic nation as the prophet of god said a bunch of sinners your destination and a nuclear war is in their hands huh oh my look at the uncertainty look out that's all she needs that's what the prophet said it'll do we're really in for it then amen we're really in for it then so it's so much changing who knows what this will evolve into right we don't know amen aren't you glad though that brother bam says you have that if those missiles are coming up and they get up into the air huh but i've never said that you would be gone before those missiles would be launched he said they would you would be gone before they would crack he uses the words before they'll break open hallelujah how many sad for that amen and as you know everybody's getting edgy everybody's getting trigger happy you know what happens before a fight is they begin to threaten each other huh when you begin to threaten look out oh my and so we're just on the verge how we made it this far how we got to 20 and 22 is it i don't know all i know is there must be another name written that has to get redeemed i mean somebody else has to come in because when that last one comes in the rapture is going to take place christ is going to come remember this folks there is absolutely no hope for the financial world there ain't no hope for nothing down here amen that's why i like the sunday school brother brian talking about amen set your affections on things above not on things below because there is no hope for this there's only one hope only one goal that you and i have how many know that there's only one goal and that is just watch the skies part and christ to come back and to receive us to himself and i don't believe that that's going to be seen at all by the world out there you will receive a body change and you'll see him on a glorified cloud because she gets caught away and snatched away like a thief in the night we have to get changed to see him amen but there will come a time when everybody is going to see him but he's going to take us out that's our goal how many knows it that's our goal so it's checking up time and i got to think about how this is shaking up time and i really wanted to speak on what really began to lead me into a direction i wanted to go was want to talk about that which is real and that which is a substitute right amen because the devil offers all kinds of substitutes and things amen but let me just say this how many know so we're looking we don't know exactly everything but we know that the coming of the lord draws close it's getting close so he says right after that we're ready for it then so church get ready to meet christ get ready to be christ he's sending great revivals and meetings stirring the full gospel people signs and wonders appearing everywhere gave great wanderers to draw his people together and one day he will come praise the lord one day he will come now turn will with me again to second corinthians if you will we'll try to just take our time in the lord this morning is that all right beautiful sunshine nice and warm and i just like the warmth of the holy spirit this is the best time of your whole week isn't it when we get together and worship the lord in spirit and truth okay let me see here second corinthians 13 13-5 paul says examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves amen no you're not your own selves and i like that i got to think about that examine ourselves you know there's really nobody that knows you better than you right because sometimes we hide things right you would probably never tell even your wife or your husband sometimes the thoughts that go through your mind i got some nods here yeah some people honest because i'm telling you what you let this ghost just a little bit you just let it go a little bit and buddy it'll go think thoughts that you should have never thought whether it's uh uh uh against somebody or somebody did you wrong and man man if i had the chance what you would do to him and you have to bring that thought now what in the world you want to think like that for get right how many's got to do that to yourself that's right you have thoughts and know it's just all kinds of things you know and the world we live in all kinds it has to bring be brought captive and you have to examine you know yourself in every aspect of your life you should know what you like isn't that something that paul both times says examine yourself i may not see it you may not see it i may not see it in you you may not see it in me but you know it in yourself that's why you gotta examine yourself prove your own self right prove yourself i will say this many will come to him in that day now right and say haven't we done this and haven't we prophesied in your name all right and done many mighty works in your name right have we cast out devils in thy name done many wonderful works ma can we say that they call him lord lord haven't we prophesied spoke in tongues haven't we prophesy how many knows brother manhattan talked about matthew 24 and how there'll be many false christs rise and false prophets and do great signs and wonders and so much and so much that if it was possible it would receive the very elect and he pointed to the prophet pointed to the pentecostal church because they could prophesy and it would come to pass and all these things and speak in tongues and they say that's the evidence that you got it huh the prophet says look i've seen witch doctors speaking unknown tanks have pen writing tongues and everything else just because you can speak in tongues don't mean you got it so don't rely on gifts as we begin to examine ourselves this morning we don't rely on what you've done don't rely on on the gifts that you have thomas paula can't rely on the fact that he's giving him a gift to preach that's got nothing to do with me that's i gotta examine way down in here i gotta dig deeper than that that don't make me right that don't make me a christian just because i've got the ability to preach huh just because somebody can prophesy and speak it down that don't mean it because even doing many mighty works even having faith to do things because remember it'll be very very deceiving people will deceive themselves because they know closely examine themselves [Music] and it's sad that they have to wait until on the day of judgment to be told you missed it you didn't have it huh there's only one interest that i have that is to be ready only one thing goal that i have in 22 as a pastor and that is to have you ready i want you ready and if you're not going to be ready it's not going to be on me because that's my job it's a minister for the edification of the body of christ to bring us to the unity of the faith to the stature of the fullness of christ all right that's my job god help me to do my job that's my goal is to be ready because he's going to come when people are not looking for it he's going to come at an unexpected time but not for those that are watching because jesus said blessed are those that watch and they keep their garment that that they will not come to you as he thinks oh i don't know about you but i want to live every day the prophet of god when he spoke on souls in prison now he talked about man maybe it's already passed maybe we're already preaching to the total lot he was on the complete expectation for christ to come anytime and listen you might say well look how long this went it don't matter how long until it goes you should be ready and expecting him every day [Music] right how many believe that not once a month not once a year every day you should say i'm expecting him to come i am living today like he's gonna burst through those cards for me anytime because when he does i am not going to be disappointed i'm going to be there ready and waiting for him because jesus said blessed are those that are found watching blessed are those that are ready when he comes watch therefore jesus said how many believes that watch oh therefore for you know now what hour the lord does come amen listen therefore be also ready for him such an hour as you think not the same man cometh who then is he wise and faithful servant whom his lord shall make him ruler over all his house to get them meet in due season blessed is that servant amen aren't you glad for that oh my praise be to god i'm thankful for that jesus um spoke more he brought the prophet to bring this to light amen but the jesus christ when he was fixing to go to calvary sure he told him told his children he says uh that you know the son of man must be betrayed fall into the hands of sinful men and so forth and to rise from the third day but look at all these chapters in matthew 24 and all these different things that learn the parable when the fig trees and all these other perils we spoke more about that second come because that's what's so important so after the opponent was made after amen he went to calvary and everything now the focal point is going to be that second coming i i i can't i can't hardly fathom how god does but it seems that god hides himself to the world he hides himself in such simplicity he hides himself in such humility that everybody's looking some great fantastic thing when god is in humility and simplicity right i mean folks he could how many know god could have the whole world on their knees he could create it in such a way or show himself in such a way until everybody just spend it all fall in their knees and say yeah your god but he don't want to do it that way he wants you to believe him though you can't see him but then on the other hand if they wanted to see him all they had to look at what he did in this generation world over seven times did miracle after miracle after miracle sign after sign to get the people to know that god really is real if this message doesn't make christ and god more real in your heart from day to day then it ain't the message fall it's not christ's fault it's your fault this ought to be a real reality to us amen folks i'm building an addition trying to finish the edition on the house and so forth i've got earthly goals and things that i said that i want to do but i want to just testify when i turn my eyes on jesus look full in his wonderful faith then the thing that this earth did just grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace when i think about this house it'll probably be taken from me they'll probably you know do something like that you don't have no guarantee of keeping your property nah he got no hopes down here but when you think about what you got over there the less you think about this world and the more you think about what christ has in store for us the happier you'll be the less we focus on the things of this world the less i focus on the things to do more i feel because on the things of god the more joy you'll have we're not a downcast depressed sad forsaken doomed no that's not the believer that's the unbeliever they're sad they're glued they have no hope they have no control of it they have no joy they have no peace amen amen another place just comes to mind the prophet says you know you just watch it get worse and worse and worse you watch sin get worse and worse until the skies catch on fire amen no hope for this world praise be to god amen so we find brothers and sisters and i want to let's talk about this over here matthew 25 we find another oil talking about oil i like talking about oil not the oil that russia wants or that the world wants but that the bride wants matthew 25 after he talks about cutting the hip or quick with the portion of the hypocrites they'll be weeping and washing of teeth then shall the kingdom of heaven be like unto ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil in them [Music] but the wise took oil in their vessels now notice it doesn't really talk about having it lit it just talked about they got that oil right and while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slipped and at midnight there was a crime made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to me him i can't help but believe that there's a parallel between that and revelations where it says come out of her my people that you receive not of her plagues partake not of her sins come out of her come out come out to meet him remember the screaming of the prophet when he said that come out amen get out of there get out of that lukewarm church i never finished my story comes back to me but brother bam talked about the pentecostals i guess i did finish but talk about the pentecost and how deceiving it was it looked like the real thing it looked like that's what it was but the very people speaking in tongues and interpretation tongues and all the power to do what they did rejected christ and put him outside the door that's exactly right you go to brother branham's meetings and you watch christ discern the thoughts and the tense of the heart just like the messiah did with the woman at the well and we'll excommunicate you do you think that's going to go unpunished no what kind of bed are they going to get thrown in they're going to get throwed in a bed of death a bit of tribulation i will kill her with death they're dead oh my at midnight there was a crimea behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins rose and trim their lamps how many believe that's what it's time for trim your lamps in other words let the light burn a little brighter how many with me this morning lord help me to let my light burn a little brighter [Music] make sure all the dross is out of my life amen don't ask me why i'm preaching this ask the lord we must need it right i believe the lord speaks to us he brings us to these things for a purpose he does me amen all right so he says and they trim their lamps and the fully said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answer saying not so least there be not enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready hey man are you with me this morning those that were not getting ready they were ready [Music] oh yeah are you ready should the master call today you don't make it home this afternoon are you ready yes amen and then that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterwards also came the virgins saying lord lord open unto us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not huh let me see here isn't that the same word that he used over here yeah back in chapter 7 after they said i prophesied in your name and all these then will i profess unto them i never knew you over here it says i know you not they did not have an everyday intimate relationship with jesus christ now let me ask you what happened here what happened here 15 8-9 i'll tell you what happened here what happened here was john 10. john 10 he happened here and matthew 22 all right verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climb it up some other way the same is a thief and a robber how many knots they had to try some other way in other words a substitutional way a way that they thought they could get in how many knows we got to watch that because the devil offers substitutes he's the one that is a copier he's an impersonator amen he looks like it but he isn't oh my remember not all that say lord lord shall come in and shall enter in so he climbed up some other way now i believe it's in matthew 22 this is also them matthew 22 11-13 go into the highways and hedges verse 9. good therefore into the highways in as many as you shall find bid to the marriage so those servants went out into the highways and gathered as many as they found both bad and good and wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came in to the guests he saw there a man which had not a wedding garment and he said unto them friend how came us down in hither not having a wedding garment oh my think about it trying to get some other way without having the dress of christ what's the dress of christ it's the blood of jesus christ washed in his blood amen having on the robe of his right but i'm here to tell you the church world today they think they can come some of their way they can wear their clothes they can be robed the way that they want to be robed and come in god says that's not going to happen he's going to be thrown out let's examine ourselves remember how many knows they don't think they have to come by way of malachi 4. luke 17 3 they don't come god says behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the wickedly and all the power there shall be stubble under the soles of your feet but behold i send you lied to the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord what's he going to do turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers but they don't accept that way no we ain't got to do that go ahead and try it go ahead and try you're going to be disappointed [Music] amen some other way some substitutionary way amen this is what the prophet says what's the matter with people today what makes people drink and lying steal commit adultery and do they act the way they do it's not because they haven't got something to satisfy huh it's because that take a substitute instead of the real thing people don't want the real they don't want the truth even jesus says you know he says they love darkness rather than the world's got a love from people got a love problem like i said wednesday night love not the world nor the things of the world because if you love the world and the things of the world the love of god is not even in you and what is the love of the world what is the world the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life if you love when you satisfy and you let your flesh do what it wants you remember you're not in love with god oh my how many believes that god ain't god ain't in your heart if you don't if you love the flesh or the things of the flesh amen god help us this morning oh my what i just it just gets all over me i love it lord help us i'm here to tell you your flesh is your biggest enemy it is your enemy the holy spirit is your friend amen listen to this if i can find it this morning on the way to church oops here we go i had this thought and i said i gotta just this is wonderful i like this machine you're gonna when i i usually have to have my wife get a pen out of the drawer and write this down i finally got smart and says just get the voice thing on your phone is my goodness how many pleasers perfect solutions [Music] this flesh that's one of our greatest battles you examine yourself ask yourself how much you serve your flesh instead of the spirit amen oh my our lord help us this morning this is a serious thing lust of the flesh what is the thing if you this if you love the things that just love this flesh loves then guess what bob says the love of god isn't even in you oh my or the lust of the eye oh my or the pride of life i know i said it wednesday but i won't say it again this morning that's the prestige well i like a good home i love a good home i like a nice truck guys car all these nice things the flash loves all that but it's all to pass away listen all of these fleshy things of the flesh all of everything is uh the devil offers a substitute joy he offers a substitute piece why don't why do you think uh forget the name of the street in philadelphia have you ever ever seen youtube and seen philadelphia in the streets and the bombs and and the drug addicts that are on there brother troy have you ever seen it on youtube i'm here to tell you people die by the dozens and they're just all over the street and they have drug stations where you can do drugs and then throw your needles in and everything else america has come nothing but a drug drug addict huh how many how about hearing that we are tax dollars going for crack pipes y'all heard about that think about it and they think drugs they will from what understand deal with and i used to smoke marijuana don't never do it it'll make you sit in the house and be paranoid it's a paranoia yeah you can't go out no i don't want to be seen out it's not all that good but it'll make you think you got peace you know you'll think you feel good i'll make you think you feel good but it's just that it's oh my riches are the same way how about consciousness but brian read he says work and also overcoming covetousness which is idolatry if you have more if you want things more than you want god it's idolatry just to become a justice is a dollar wow oh my i don't i i shouldn't say i don't mean to be hard i'm just going to let the holy spirit have his way is that all right because i know i need it now i'm here to tell you we better get ready to get out of here amen because he could come anytime he should have come i want to say i believe he should have come already what is it maybe somebody up here maybe some of us aren't just ready yet not quite ready [Music] amen praise be to god another one and we'll start our message this morning luke 15 luke 15. he says either white woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece does not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she has found it she called her friends and her neighbors together and reached saying rejoice with me for i have found the peace which i had lost now i didn't know the true meaning of this but i have a lot of confidence in our prophet don't you and brother branham reads this very scripture about having this woman with 10 pieces of silver he says now it may seem like an odd strange scripture for the second coming of christ it's speaking of his second coming and this great subject that we have here before us is the one of the most vital subject of the entire holy writ there's nothing more important as the coming of the lord jesus how do you believe that well by the way you preach i'm taking up and all so much yeah we all preach it every sunday why because it's shaking up time not just every hour the prophet said but every minute of every hour it's checking up time every minute you should be asking yourself am i ready am i ready am i ready am i ready am i ready you should ask how many please you gotta ask ourselves that question a lot you wouldn't have to worry about the pastor getting on to you you come to church and say that's right protobot that's what i've been doing praise be to god hallelujah instead of hold me boy i better straighten up huh i like that you're nodding the that's nice amen because that's the truth isn't it vital subject oh my listen in the old testament there was many more scriptures in the old testament pertaining to the second coming of christ even then there is in the first coming everything the human race now after atonement was made rest solemnly upon the second coming of christ now talking about this woman the way he puts it he says in those days they didn't have wedding rings they had a tablet and they put that on their head all right and it had ten coins and then it went around her head and that was a sign that they were a married woman and no man was a fool with them no boys wants to flirt with them they were married hallelujah how many believe that's what you are to christ this morning you're married to christ [Music] and christ doesn't want you flirting with the world he don't want you to flirt with anything else but him he wants you to have your love to no other man and no other thing but him i believe that's what he's telling us this morning amen praise the lord and each coin meant a certain virtue for that woman the first meeting her love for her husband love second pledge to virtue and live clean for him the third and the fourth and the fifth and so forth he didn't go through all of them if you want to look it up in galatians 5 you'll find that that woman represented the church the churches and his spouse wife to christ and the tablet that the church is supposed to wear is found in galatians 5 which is joy and peace long serving goodness meekness gentle pain that is the tablet that's supposed to be worn by the church by the love kindness and fellowship and this woman it must have been along about dark and she realized that she had lost one of these coins and oh if there was ever a time the church ought to take inventory to find out if you've got all the cards on how many bleeds i believe this morning it's time to look huh time to check make sure that you've got all the fruits of the spirit [Music] amen you see before jesus said that about many will come to me and say in that day haven't we done this out of the other he says a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a trump tree bring forth eat good fruit every tree that bringeth forth thy good fruit is tuned down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits you shall know them i want to rephrase it and give it another scripture by your fruits you will know yourself that's why jesus paul said judge yourselves because if you would judge yourselves you would not be judged why why would you not be judged because you would judge yourself you would repent make it right before god and god wouldn't have to look the tire out of you to get your attention to let you know you're doing wrong but if you don't judge yourself at you he says that's good because to be good just of god to be punished or chastised he said but god is good because at least that way you are coming with the world oh how many smarties in the interested in not being condemned in the tribulation period with the world i'm interested lord don't condemn me with the world don't judge me with the world that's why i come to church this morning not to have pitchfork religion and see how everybody else copes up with the word but to see how i look compared to the word of god how do i look are you with me look at yourself amen look at yourself oh preacher's using the phone now that's going way too far in it sometimes some things you're worthy of looking at aren't they just sometimes y'all remember there's a little something here that donna read to me on facebook i guess and uh i thought it was good and i thought well i'll use that this morning all right william booth was an english methodist preacher who along with his wife catherine founded the salvation army and became its first general william booth the christian movement with a quasi-military structure and government founded in 1865 has spread from london england to many parts of the world and is known for being one of the largest distributors of humanitarian aid in 2002 booth was named among 100 greatest britons in a british poll and he makes the statement i consider that the chief danger which confront the coming century will be religion without the holy ghost huh is that right people will accept the substitute of the holy ghost by works by this side or the other something else they'll take a handshake become a member of the church and they'll have religion but they won't have the holy ghost how many knows it's real bad didn't say there'll be millions and billions of mimics and copycats of christianity they claim christianity but they won't have christ huh why examine yourself religion without the holy ghost christianity without christ i like this one forgiveness lord forgive me lord forgive me without repentance well you ain't never got to quit what you do you just gotta ask god to forgive you you know the religion of today women want to wear their pants you want to cut their hair well god doesn't mean he does mike even preaching the pulpit let you women be silent in the churches it is forbidden for them to speak and even if you've got a question wait till you get home to ask your husband the bible said not me paul said pretty strong huh well brother byler aren't you being just a little hard not really it was you that brought this whole world into the condition that it is it was your kind he was the female that was weak she's weaker than the man she can be deceived a lot easier than the man and paul said don't speak be quiet because of the fall because every sod heal every funeral possession every ambulance every sickness came through the woman huh he says because it is you be quiet but she comes up here and she's permitted to speak i said to johnny's can i say it i've heard of a preacher that was confronted with his daughter was preaching and he was confronted hey what about bible says he says i know what the bible says but it's my daughter and i'm going to stick stand behind my daughter yeah that was one of the local churches folks y'all want to go over there what does that tell you tells you right off the go get that he loves his family father mother daughter more than he loves god and he's not fit to follow christ not worthy to follow me you gotta love christ the word more than you love your family are you not fit to follow it he won't even have you following him let me tell you something a preacher that'll let a woman go in the pulpit and preach it to be the preacher that's right amen you ought to quit go get you a job at mcdonald's you'd be better off can i quit all right i said my peace listen isn't that right religion forgiveness without repentance on salvation without regeneration and heaven without hell politics without god and heaven without hell well yeah god loves to gaze god loves homosexuals sure he loved the homosexuals but he hates homosexuality and if homosexuality is in that person he's going to burn it huh because he loves the whole world but there's sin he don't like just like homosexual or if sin is in your life he loves you but he hates what you're doing are you with me and if you keep doing that if you're going down that road you will be condemned amen burnt just like sodom and gomorrah was what did the prophet say god loves the sinner but he hates sin amen lord help us this morning check where your desires are i'm not going to go forever but we could start with love amen how many knows that the first church age love that lost their first love for god remember from where you are fall and then repent i like that repent quickly oh my i think we ought to examine ourselves and see if we are in love as much as we were in times past with christ are you with me this morning are you as in love with christ now and more so than what you have been or have you drifted away and you don't have the love that you had for god you don't have the passion to know him you don't have the passion to read his bible you don't have the passion to go to church amen folks the only reason you should be in church is sickness or the ox being in the ditch huh let me say this i appreciate our wednesday night coming up i appreciate those who are making an f i appreciate our sunday morning services and so forth amen people that come i appreciate all of you but i feel bad for the people that are getting cold huh for the people that are just drifting away [Music] don't care if they come to church or not oh my you know what it says about you oh my let me let me find my quote if i can well is there one more underneath there there it is lord didn't want me to speak it didn't he ministers today are having such a hard time getting people out for friends tonight prayer meeting amen they love television programs they love amusements they're too busy to come to church i don't want to come they don't want to come to church on sunday many of them they tell me the ministers and the church pews are empty let me get a some kind of a quartet even in the gospel quartet or anything entertaining and the locals and people fill this place up probably wouldn't they but you preach the gospel and you get people examining themselves and having to look at themselves and they're not going to come they don't want to do that listen the world offers them so much other things tensile things of the world and people fall for that that shows that at the beginning you didn't have nothing to start with thank you better joe think about it that's the truth people don't have no desire for it anymore there's something wrong to start with i'm a preacher and i have pack slit and i've gotten cold on god i have fallen short next time that i didn't really want to go to church but it was because i was backslid but the one thing for sure is i can't stay that way if you have something to start with you will not stay that way you will repent you'll be so miserable you'll want that sweet heart that wonderful feeling of peace and joy so bad you don't care if you're going to climb the roof or the church to get it you'll get somewhere and you'll get a hold of god and you'll get right with god because there ain't nothing like it the public tell that you ever get born again amen there nothing else will ever satisfy you nothing else will ever comfort you like a holy ghost very nothing is fun that's coming to church and dancing around and giving glorifying god and magnifying god nothing will make you feel better people want to feel good come to church that's why you're getting to feel good [Music] oh i'm sorry if i get a little carried away but give me a booze or two and i'll tell you what now i'm gonna get carried away and i'm just gonna act all kinds of funny i ain't gonna care what nobody thinks and what somebody says about me huh how about getting a little bit of the holy ghost not caring what people think about you
