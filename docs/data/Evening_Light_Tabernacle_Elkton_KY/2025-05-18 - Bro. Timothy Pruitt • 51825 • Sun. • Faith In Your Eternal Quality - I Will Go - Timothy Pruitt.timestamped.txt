[1:10:20] Isaiah 53 says, "But he was wounded for
[1:10:22] our transgressions. He was bruised for
[1:10:24] our iniquities. The chastisement of our
[1:10:26] peace was upon him. And with his stripes
[1:10:29] we are healed. All we like sheep have
[1:10:31] gone astray and have turned one to his
[1:10:34] own way. And the Lord hath laid the
[1:10:37] iniquity laid. The Lord hath laid on him
[1:10:40] the iniquity of us all. And I just had a

[1:11:45] fears of
[1:11:50] tomorrow. And I'm

[1:11:56] of my past.

[1:12:44] I met

[1:13:07] fears of tomorrow.

[1:19:33] but, you know, we moved into, uh, being
[1:19:35] a grandpa. And so, that's pretty good. I
[1:19:37] I enjoy that. And so, Amen. We're
[1:19:40] looking to be more grandpa, more of a
[1:19:42] grandpa, more more grandchild. That's
[1:19:43] what I told him. I said, "If I'm going
[1:19:45] to let you get married, there has to be
[1:19:46] a reward for this, right?" Amen. And so,
[1:19:50] we're we're enjoying that. But, um,
[1:19:52] Amen. We do bring you greetings from our
[1:19:54] home church, from our pastor, Brother
[1:19:56] Tim.

[1:19:59] last time, but I forgot, but I didn't
[1:20:00] realize again till this weekend. Our
[1:20:03] churches have the same name, Evening
[1:20:05] Light Tabernacle. And And I believe
[1:20:07] that's wonderful that we can Amen. just
[1:20:09] be kindred hearts and spirits. And Amen.
[1:20:12] Uh because we serve the same God. And I
[1:20:14] I don't you may have a different name
[1:20:16] tonight or this morning, a different
[1:20:18] church you came from, but we're all the
[1:20:19] same. Amen. We come from every tribe,
[1:20:22] every nation, every tongue, every
[1:20:24] people. Amen. to live for him and to
[1:20:26] glorify his name. And amen. So God bless
[1:20:29] you today. Ephesians 1 and verse three.
[1:20:33] Amen. As we turn to the Lord, let's just
[1:20:35] bow our hearts for a moment in prayer
[1:20:37] and just go to the author of the word
[1:20:40] for a moment. Father, we just come to
[1:20:42] your day in this Lord, this closing
[1:20:44] service of this weekend of meetings,
[1:20:47] Lord. And God, we can truly say our
[1:20:49] hearts have been blessed. And Lord,
[1:20:52] we're so thankful for you coming by
[1:20:54] service after service. And the word
[1:20:57] that's been brought, Lord, and we're so
[1:20:59] thankful, Lord, that it's quickened our
[1:21:01] hearts that we can hear. And thank you,
[1:21:03] Lord, for giving us a ear to hear what
[1:21:05] the spirit is saying in this generation,
[1:21:08] Lord. And we just ask as we close these
[1:21:10] services, Lord, and that you'll just
[1:21:12] come once again and speak, Lord, with uh
[1:21:15] Lord, with your power and authority,
[1:21:18] Lord.
[1:21:18] Let let the word be the discerner of the
[1:21:20] thoughts and intents of the heart. We
[1:21:22] pray and God if there be any needs here
[1:21:25] Lord that you'll continue to touch and
[1:21:26] minister Lord as only you can do Lord we
[1:21:30] give this to you. We ask Lord that you

[1:21:37] Lord, the deacons, trustees, the
[1:21:39] musicians, every heart that's
[1:21:41] represented, Lord, but not not only this
[1:21:43] church, but every church represented.
[1:21:45] May they go from this place, Lord, and
[1:21:47] Lord, just continue to walk in the grace
[1:21:49] of almighty God and the power of God be
[1:21:52] revealed in their assembly as well. We
[1:21:54] pray in Jesus name. Amen. Ephesians 1
[1:21:59] and verse three.
[1:22:00] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[1:22:02] the Lord.
[1:22:05] Amen.
[1:22:07] Bless, blessed be the God and Father of
[1:22:09] our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
[1:22:12] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:22:15] heavenly places in Christ, according as
[1:22:19] he has chosen us in him before the
[1:22:21] foundation of the world, that we should
[1:22:23] be holy and without blame before him in
[1:22:26] love, having predestinated us unto the
[1:22:29] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:22:31] himself, according to the good pleasure
[1:22:34] of his will, to the praise of of the
[1:22:36] glory of his grace, wherein he hath made
[1:22:38] us accepted in the beloved, and whom we
[1:22:42] have redemption through his blood, the
[1:22:44] forgiveness of sins, according to the
[1:22:46] riches of his grace, wherein he hath
[1:22:49] abounded towards us in all wisdom and
[1:22:51] prudence, having made known unto us the
[1:22:54] mystery of his will, according to his
[1:22:56] good pleasure, which he hath purposed in
[1:22:59] himself, that is the dispensation of the
[1:23:01] fullness of time, he might gather
[1:23:03] together in one all things in Christ,
[1:23:06] both which were in heaven and which are
[1:23:08] on earth, even in him, in whom also we
[1:23:10] have obtained an inheritance, being
[1:23:12] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:23:15] of him who workketh all things after the
[1:23:18] counsel of his own will, that we should
[1:23:21] be to the praise of his glory, who first
[1:23:23] trusted in Christ, and whom you also
[1:23:26] trusted, that after you heard the word
[1:23:28] of truth and the gospel of your
[1:23:30] salvation, and whom also after that you
[1:23:33] believed, you were sealed with that Holy
[1:23:36] Spirit of promise which is the earnest
[1:23:39] of our inheritance unto the redemption
[1:23:41] of the purchased possession unto the
[1:23:44] praise of his glory. Amen. It's all for
[1:23:47] his glory. Amen. God bless you. You can
[1:23:50] be seated today and
[1:23:53] Amen. Just like to um uh speak to you on
[1:23:57] faith in your eternal quality. Amen. But
[1:24:01] as a subtitle, I'd like to speak on I
[1:24:03] will go. Amen. I I I I I just love how
[1:24:08] Paul this Ephesians is a book that's
[1:24:12] speaking about us if you if you can
[1:24:14] realize that today. And and I I love how
[1:24:16] he says that we were chosen in Christ
[1:24:19] before the foundation of the world. He
[1:24:22] puts an eternal quality to the chosen.
[1:24:25] Amen. Because it wasn't you wasn't
[1:24:27] chosen when you gave your heart to God
[1:24:29] on an altar or when you were born here
[1:24:31] on earth, but you were actually chosen
[1:24:34] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:24:36] not only were you chosen, you were
[1:24:38] chosen that you would be holy and
[1:24:40] without blame. Amen. That's powerful
[1:24:43] right there when you can realize that I
[1:24:45] was chosen not only before the
[1:24:47] foundation of the world, but I was
[1:24:48] chosen to be holy and without blame.
[1:24:52] Even though I came into this world,
[1:24:53] Amen. a a born in sin, shaped in
[1:24:56] iniquity, came to this world speaking
[1:24:57] lies. I was still chosen to be holy and
[1:25:01] without blame and we were predestinated
[1:25:04] to the adoption of Jesus of the children
[1:25:06] by Jesus Christ. Now you know brother
[1:25:09] bring this. He said now he said he has
[1:25:11] chosen us in him Jesus before the
[1:25:14] foundation of the world. That means that
[1:25:16] you were right there with him in the
[1:25:18] mind and thoughts of God before the
[1:25:20] foundation of the world. So before you
[1:25:22] ever spoke the first lie, before you
[1:25:24] ever ever done the first sin, God had
[1:25:27] already chose you. Amen. He says,
[1:25:29] "Therefore, that gives an eternal
[1:25:32] quality to the elect." An eternal
[1:25:35] quality to the elect. You cannot get
[1:25:36] away from that. Now, you look at this
[1:25:38] word quality. It's a distinct attribute
[1:25:41] or a characteristic that's possessed by
[1:25:43] someone. In other words, we were all
[1:25:45] pre-planned by God.
[1:25:48] Amen. Nothing happens by chance to God.
[1:25:50] Amen. He knows all about it. It's all
[1:25:53] pre-planned. Planned for many
[1:25:54] generations back so that you could be
[1:25:56] here. Did you know that? Just think that
[1:25:58] you at one time, he said, I'll repeat
[1:26:00] this again. You at one time was in your
[1:26:02] father in the gene of your father. Now,
[1:26:04] he didn't know you that time. Neither
[1:26:07] did you know him. But you see, you were
[1:26:08] put in a bedding ground in the womb of
[1:26:11] the mother through the holy wedlock. And
[1:26:13] then you became a person expressed in
[1:26:15] the image like your father. Then you can
[1:26:18] have fellowship. Amen. That's what God
[1:26:20] desired there in the beginning. He
[1:26:22] desired fellowship. So he built the
[1:26:24] earth. Amen. That we could be born of
[1:26:26] the dirt. Amen. A seed could be planted
[1:26:28] there. Amen. And be rose up. Now, Satan
[1:26:31] would come and he would pervert that.
[1:26:32] And so those seeds that were ordained of
[1:26:35] God to come forth. Amen. They came forth
[1:26:37] in a perversion, in a perverted way.
[1:26:39] Amen. But God, amen, had that desire. So
[1:26:42] he he he said, "Well, I I Satan's done
[1:26:45] this, but I have a plan, and I want to
[1:26:47] be a savior. I I want to be a healer. I
[1:26:49] want to be a deliverer. And so he be to
[1:26:51] let his word work. And he began to let
[1:26:53] it to be expressed and and it expressed
[1:26:56] down through every one of the patriarchs
[1:26:58] that we could go through in the
[1:26:59] scripture. And and we can look at
[1:27:01] Abraham. We can look at Noah and we can
[1:27:03] look at Moses and we can look at David.
[1:27:05] But listen, God had more than that in
[1:27:07] his mind. Amen. He was looking all the
[1:27:09] way 6,000 years later that there would
[1:27:12] be a people that would be born in the
[1:27:14] darkest time there's ever been upon this
[1:27:17] earth. They would be born in the time of
[1:27:19] chaos, in the time that spiritual
[1:27:21] wickedness was upon the earth like never
[1:27:23] before. But there would be a seed that
[1:27:25] was placed on the inside of them that
[1:27:27] would rise above the muck and rise above
[1:27:30] the sin and rise above the unbelief. And
[1:27:33] in spite of all what the devil could do
[1:27:35] and all the devil would try to put upon
[1:27:37] your life, he would try to put sin. He
[1:27:39] would try to put drugs. He would try to
[1:27:41] put alcohol. whatever he would place
[1:27:43] upon your life in spite of that all all
[1:27:46] of that that seed that was placed in you
[1:27:48] before the foundation of the world it
[1:27:51] came up through all of that. Hallelujah.
[1:27:53] I I seen a picture one time of a little
[1:27:56] tree that was planted in the dirt and a
[1:27:58] rock come out somehow got on top of that
[1:28:00] seed but that was seed was ordained to
[1:28:02] life and that seed actually broke that
[1:28:05] rock open and came out and a tree grew
[1:28:07] out of the rock.
[1:28:09] Amen. Amen. I've seen concrete. You can
[1:28:12] you can put concrete on the ground four
[1:28:14] or five inches thick. Amen. But if
[1:28:15] there's a seed that's ordained to life,
[1:28:18] it will come to life. Amen. And I
[1:28:21] believe that the devil has tried. He's
[1:28:23] tried to put clamps. He's tried to put
[1:28:25] Amen. theologies. He's tried to put
[1:28:27] psychology. He's tried to put sin. He's
[1:28:30] tried to put everything upon your life.
[1:28:32] But in spite of it all, Amen. There's a
[1:28:34] seed on the inside and it will come to
[1:28:37] life.
[1:28:40] Amen. Your birth was no accident.
[1:28:44] Amen. Your life is not by chance. Amen.
[1:28:47] Your parents may not have planned for
[1:28:49] you to be born or you may have been
[1:28:51] given up for even adoption by your
[1:28:53] parents and they wasn't even in their
[1:28:55] mind or in their plan. But God planned
[1:28:57] for you. Amen. God planned that you
[1:29:00] would be here, that you would come in a
[1:29:02] certain time and a certain season. He
[1:29:05] could have put you back in another time,
[1:29:06] but he chose to put you in the place
[1:29:09] that he chose to put you in. And the
[1:29:11] devil can't do nothing about it.
[1:29:16] Amen. God was not surprised when you was
[1:29:18] born. He was expecting it.
[1:29:23] It is not a fate. It is not chance. It
[1:29:26] is not luck. It is not coincidence that
[1:29:29] you're breathing this very moment.
[1:29:31] You're alive because God created you.
[1:29:35] God put something on the inside. And not
[1:29:37] only that, he prescribed every single
[1:29:40] detail of your body.
[1:29:44] Oh yeah. He chose your race. He chose
[1:29:46] the color of your skin. He chose your
[1:29:49] hair. He chose every feature. He custom
[1:29:52] made your body just the way he wanted
[1:29:54] it. He also determined the talents you
[1:29:56] would have, the uniqueness of your
[1:29:58] personality.
[1:29:59] [Applause]
[1:30:02] God knows all about you this morning.
[1:30:04] You may think you're a forgotten. You
[1:30:06] may think that somebody does. Nobody
[1:30:08] cares. Nobody understands what I'm going
[1:30:10] through. But God is here to tell you
[1:30:12] this morning, I have not forgotten you.
[1:30:15] But you have been in my mind before the
[1:30:18] foundation of the
[1:30:22] world. Hallelujah. I want to drop
[1:30:24] something in right now that I tell you.
[1:30:27] Oh, I done messed myself up. I tell you,
[1:30:29] I I I uh I I can't hardly read this
[1:30:32] without weeping. So, if I get a little
[1:30:34] carried away this morning, just forgive
[1:30:36] me. Well, I tell you what, won't you
[1:30:38] just get carried away with me?
[1:30:41] I thank you, buddy. Amen. Get carried
[1:30:44] away with me. Psalms 139. Now, I'm going
[1:30:47] to read out of a different translation
[1:30:48] if that's all right. I'm going to read
[1:30:50] out of a translation. Amen. The Passion
[1:30:52] translation. But it says here in verse
[1:30:54] chapter 139, it says, "Lord, you know
[1:30:57] everything there is to know about me.
[1:30:59] You perceived every movement of my
[1:31:01] heart. You understand my every thought
[1:31:03] before it even enters my mind. You're so
[1:31:05] intimately aware of me, Lord. You have
[1:31:08] read my heart like an open book. You
[1:31:10] know all the words that I'm about to
[1:31:12] speak before I even say a sentence. You
[1:31:15] know every step I take before my journey
[1:31:18] even begins."
[1:31:20] Come on. We're talking about a God who
[1:31:21] knows your details.
[1:31:24] He knows your address. He knows what you
[1:31:27] did 5 minutes ago or or 5 years ago or
[1:31:30] 50 years ago. He knows what you're going
[1:31:32] to do.
[1:31:34] He showed it very clearly in our
[1:31:36] generation. Amen. He would bring a gift
[1:31:38] upon the earth that he could speak
[1:31:40] through and he could go back in your
[1:31:42] life 50 years or he could go ahead 50
[1:31:44] years. Amen. Time matters not to God.
[1:31:47] Amen. He says it right here. You have
[1:31:49] gone into my future to prepare the way.
[1:31:54] Woo. Hallelujah. And in kindness, you
[1:31:57] follow behind me to spare me from the
[1:31:59] harm of my past. I I don't know about
[1:32:02] you, but that's that's shouting grounds
[1:32:04] right there. God is not only in your
[1:32:06] future preparing your way. He's standing
[1:32:09] behind you to protect you from your
[1:32:12] past.
[1:32:16] The devil says, "I'm going to get you."
[1:32:18] The devil says, "I'm going to make you
[1:32:20] turn around." The devil says, "I'm going
[1:32:22] to stop you." You can't, devil, cuz
[1:32:24] there's an angel that's standing behind
[1:32:26] me. And there's an angel that's going
[1:32:28] before me.
[1:32:34] Hallelujah. This is so wonderful and
[1:32:37] deep and incomprehensible. You under
[1:32:39] your understanding of me brings wonder
[1:32:41] and strength. Where could I go from your
[1:32:44] spirit? Where could I run and hide from
[1:32:46] your face? Let me let me just let you in
[1:32:49] on something. If you're a seed of God,
[1:32:51] you can't get away from him.
[1:32:55] He has found them in a barroom.
[1:32:58] He has found them in in situations. He
[1:33:01] has found them in denominations. He has
[1:33:03] found them in all kind of places. If
[1:33:05] you're a seat of God, you cannot get
[1:33:07] away from hell.
[1:33:12] If I go up to heaven, you're there. If I
[1:33:14] go down the realms of the dead, you're
[1:33:16] there. If I fly with the wings of the
[1:33:17] shining dawn, you're there. If I fly in
[1:33:19] the radiant sunset, you're there.
[1:33:22] Wherever I go, your hand will guide me.
[1:33:24] Your strength will empower me. It's
[1:33:26] impossible to disappear from you or to
[1:33:29] ask the darkness to hide me. For your
[1:33:31] presence is everywhere, bringing light
[1:33:34] to my
[1:33:37] night. Woo! Hallelujah. I saw some this
[1:33:40] weekend that some light was brought to
[1:33:43] the darkness that was trying to shadow
[1:33:46] [Applause]
[1:33:49] them. I feel like I could walk on air
[1:33:51] right now. Amen. Amen. You formed my
[1:33:55] innermost being. You shaped the del
[1:33:57] delicate inside. You my intricate
[1:34:00] outside. You wo them all together in my
[1:34:02] mother's womb. I thank you, God, for
[1:34:04] making me so mysteriously complex.
[1:34:10] Everything you do is breathtaking.
[1:34:18] Hallelujah. It simply amazes me to think
[1:34:21] about it. How thoroughly you know me,
[1:34:23] Lord. You have formed every bone in my
[1:34:25] body. You have created me in the secret
[1:34:28] place skillfully. You shaped me from
[1:34:30] nothing into something. You saw who you
[1:34:33] created me to be before I became me.
[1:34:37] Amen.
[1:34:38] Before I even seen the light of day and
[1:34:41] the number of days you planned for me,
[1:34:43] they were already recorded in your book.
[1:34:47] Come on, somebody. That tells me right
[1:34:50] there, the devil can't minus one number.
[1:34:52] He can't take one number. They have all
[1:34:54] been recorded in his book. And if I'm
[1:34:56] ordained to live 80 years by the grace
[1:34:58] of God, then I'll live 80 years. If I'm
[1:35:01] ordained to live whatever time, Amen. 54
[1:35:04] years and 5 months and a 17 days and 3
[1:35:08] hours and 60 seconds. God knows exactly
[1:35:11] how long I am in the
[1:35:15] book. But let me ask in on something.
[1:35:18] He's not just talking about the life
[1:35:20] that you're living here upon this earth.
[1:35:24] I I I I have to drop this little nugget.
[1:35:27] Amen. We get so concerned about in the
[1:35:29] last days perilous time shall come.
[1:35:32] Are we here? Perilous times, right? A
[1:35:36] lot of nonsense going on out there. But
[1:35:38] I want you to understand, it ain't the
[1:35:40] last days for me.
[1:35:51] Come on, Sister Donna. It ain't your
[1:35:52] last
[1:35:54] days. Come on, church of the living God.
[1:35:56] It ain't your last days. But I can tell
[1:35:58] you whose last days it is. It's the last
[1:36:01] days for cancer. It's the last days for
[1:36:03] depression. It's the last days for
[1:36:07] [Applause]
[1:36:09] anxiety. But one day when all the cancer
[1:36:12] is gone and all the anxieties and the
[1:36:15] fears and the worry is all gone, I'll be
[1:36:18] shouting on the
[1:36:20] hill. It's not my last days.
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:29] I'm getting ready for the biggest party
[1:36:31] I've ever had.
[1:36:37] You think last night was something? You
[1:36:39] wait till I get over
[1:36:41] there and I ain't got no more tiredness.
[1:36:44] I ain't got no more weariness. I ain't
[1:36:46] got no more old age. But I'll be young
[1:36:49] forever more. I'm going to be shouting.
[1:36:51] I'm going to be glorifying God.
[1:36:56] But let me tell you saints. You ain't
[1:36:58] got to wait to get over there
[1:37:02] cuz I've already saw my name in the
[1:37:07] book. This is not my last
[1:37:10] [Applause]
[1:37:15] days. God made you for a reason.
[1:37:20] Somebody need to turn to your neighbor
[1:37:22] and say, "God made me for a reason.
[1:37:25] Now turn to your neighbor and say, "God
[1:37:26] made you for a reason."
[1:37:32] Amen. That reason wasn't to be a drug
[1:37:35] addict.
[1:37:37] That reason wasn't be to be a slave of
[1:37:39] Satan.
[1:37:41] That reason wasn't be it wasn't even to
[1:37:43] be a legalistic Christian.
[1:37:48] Some people are so legalistic in their
[1:37:50] Christianity, they ain't got enough joy
[1:37:52] in their life.
[1:37:55] Listen, if I if I had that Christianity,
[1:37:57] I'd just throw it in the
[1:37:59] trash cuz this word said it's joy
[1:38:03] unspeakable and full of
[1:38:05] glory. It's full of glory.
[1:38:09] [Applause]
[1:38:17] He planned your day in advance.
[1:38:20] [Music]
[1:38:24] He told the children of Israel, "I'm
[1:38:26] going to prepare a place." He said,
[1:38:28] "There's an angel that's going to go
[1:38:30] before you to prepare a place for you."
[1:38:36] Now, when they got over there, you know
[1:38:38] who accepted that prepared place? Those
[1:38:41] who were prepared.
[1:38:46] Cuz there was 10 spies that went and
[1:38:47] they weren't prepared. All right. All
[1:38:50] they could see was how big the walls was
[1:38:52] and how impossible it was. And God don't
[1:38:54] do that no more. And God,
[1:38:57] days of miracles are passed. And
[1:39:01] oh, I'm ashamed of that kind of worship.
[1:39:03] I'm ashamed of those kind of Amen. They
[1:39:05] saw all these walls. They saw these big
[1:39:08] old giants. They saw all kinds of things
[1:39:10] standing in their way. You know what
[1:39:12] Caleb saw? He saw a place to build his
[1:39:15] house.
[1:39:17] He said, "Come over here, Joshua. Come
[1:39:19] over here, Joshua. Come over here."
[1:39:21] Amen. See that place right there? Give
[1:39:24] me that
[1:39:26] mountain. Well, Caleb, there's giants
[1:39:29] there. There's all kind of giants there.
[1:39:31] It doesn't matter. My God gave it to me.
[1:39:34] And if my God gave it to
[1:39:38] me, Hallelujah. I'm telling you right
[1:39:40] now, why you acting like this? Cuz God
[1:39:43] gave it to me. Why you got joy? Cuz God
[1:39:46] gave it to me. Why you got peace? Cuz
[1:39:49] God gave it to me.
[1:39:53] I got a joy that the world didn't give
[1:39:56] and the world can't take away.
[1:39:58] [Applause]
[1:40:06] [Music]
[1:40:10] That was just a pre-ervice.
[1:40:12] [Applause]
[1:40:17] I kind of need to wor maybe read a
[1:40:19] warning label right now.
[1:40:26] Hallelujah. He planned the days of your
[1:40:28] life in advance. He chose the exact time
[1:40:31] of your birth and the exact moment
[1:40:33] you're going to leave here.
[1:40:36] And let me tell you, if you're ordained
[1:40:38] for a rapture, a body change, there
[1:40:40] ain't a demon of cancer that can take
[1:40:42] you
[1:40:43] [Applause]
[1:40:47] beforehand. If you ordained to be one of
[1:40:50] those that are alive and remain, they
[1:40:52] ain't nothing can take you out of here.
[1:40:58] He left no detail to chance. He planned
[1:41:01] it all for his purpose.
[1:41:04] This is what he said in Acts 17 26. He
[1:41:06] said me, he made from every man, every
[1:41:08] nation of mankind to live on the face of
[1:41:11] the earth, having determined their
[1:41:14] appointed times and boundaries of their
[1:41:16] lands and territories. This was so that
[1:41:20] they would seek God. Right? Now, I I
[1:41:24] love that because he planned where you
[1:41:26] would be born. He and where you would
[1:41:28] live for his purpose. Your race, your
[1:41:31] nationality were not by accident.
[1:41:35] Nothing in your life is by some random
[1:41:37] choice or some whim. It's all for purp
[1:41:40] for a purpose. Most amazingly, God
[1:41:43] decided how you would be born. You know,
[1:41:46] regardless of the circumstances of your
[1:41:48] birth and who your parents are, God had
[1:41:51] a plan.
[1:41:55] It doesn't matter if you come through a
[1:41:56] junkard, you come through a prostitute,
[1:42:00] Come on. Or let me just say it. Ill
[1:42:03] illegitimately born. That's right. Go
[1:42:06] read what brother Brandham said about
[1:42:08] that. He said it was asked the question.
[1:42:10] He starts looking at it and he starts,
[1:42:12] well, I don't know how it could be that
[1:42:13] somebody God would pre-ordain this. And
[1:42:15] he gets all the way down to it. He said,
[1:42:17] "But the blood, if it wasn't for the
[1:42:19] blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:42:22] cuz we're not under the blood of bulls
[1:42:24] and goats no more. Under the blood of go
[1:42:26] bulls and goats, they couldn't come in
[1:42:27] for 14 generations. But under the blood
[1:42:30] of a righteous
[1:42:33] lamb, there's enough blood that'll
[1:42:36] rewrite your past. It'll rewrite
[1:42:38] everything about
[1:42:42] you. You might have been born
[1:42:44] illegitimately. You listen, there ain't
[1:42:46] not one of us in our in this whole
[1:42:48] sitting right here can go back 14
[1:42:50] generations and prove we were perfect
[1:42:52] blood or we were righteous blood and
[1:42:54] that none of that was in our our geneal.
[1:42:56] Ain't none of us could.
[1:43:01] But the devil sure likes to hang that
[1:43:02] over somebody's head.
[1:43:06] Well, you're just an accident. God
[1:43:08] didn't plant. You are not an
[1:43:11] accident. That's what I'm trying to get
[1:43:13] to you this morning, young people. You
[1:43:15] are not an accident. Oh, folks. You are
[1:43:18] not an accident.
[1:43:21] Amen. No matter whether your parents
[1:43:23] were good, bad or indifferent, God knew
[1:43:25] that those two individuals expect
[1:43:28] possessed exactly the right genetic
[1:43:31] makeup to create the custom you he had
[1:43:34] in mind.
[1:43:36] So he they had the DNA God wanted to
[1:43:38] make you. God purpose took into account
[1:43:41] human error. It took into account even
[1:43:45] sin. God does not do anything
[1:43:48] accidentally. He never makes a mistake.
[1:43:53] Woo! Hey, that's some shouting ground
[1:43:56] right there. Cuz the devil's always
[1:43:58] trying to tell you, you was a mistake.
[1:44:00] You're a failure. You'll never amount to
[1:44:02] nothing. I've got you. You can't get
[1:44:05] loose. But let me tell you something,
[1:44:07] devil. There was something on the inside
[1:44:09] of
[1:44:10] me that in spite of all your threats, in
[1:44:13] spite of all your words, it rose up
[1:44:16] above it.
[1:44:20] Hallelujah.
[1:44:22] Of course, the only way, Amen. you're
[1:44:24] going to be a son or daughter, you have
[1:44:25] to have eternal life. There's only one
[1:44:28] form of eternal life, and that's God's
[1:44:30] life. That's only one form of eternal
[1:44:32] life. That was God. There there was to
[1:44:34] be a son of God, you had to be in him
[1:44:35] always. How was you in him? Just like
[1:44:37] you was in the gene of your father.
[1:44:40] A gene of your father. You was in his
[1:44:42] mind.
[1:44:44] Now, us as humans, we can don't have the
[1:44:46] abilities of God. I I couldn't see
[1:44:48] Adriana, my daughter, the first born,
[1:44:50] who what she was going to look like and
[1:44:52] what characteristics she was going to
[1:44:53] have. But I knew I had a longing for
[1:44:55] children.
[1:44:58] All right.
[1:45:00] I knew I had a longing for for for for
[1:45:03] something to be expressed from me. So
[1:45:06] God brought me to Sister Ruth that that
[1:45:08] there would be a bedding ground.
[1:45:11] Come on.
[1:45:13] Amen. So that these four children could
[1:45:15] be expressed. Amen. I didn't even know
[1:45:18] who who would be. I didn't know how it
[1:45:20] would be. But God in his mercy and
[1:45:22] grace, he knew.
[1:45:25] Now, God is not like us. He knows. He
[1:45:27] knows. I want a certain person a certain
[1:45:30] way. Listen, he made Joe Adams to be a
[1:45:32] certain way with a certain tick,
[1:45:36] right? I mean, were y'all laughing?
[1:45:39] Well, y'all got a certain tick, too.
[1:45:43] Every one of us do.
[1:45:46] Let me ask you, how boring would this
[1:45:48] world be if we was all Timothy Puitz or
[1:45:50] we was all Joe Adams or we was all Toms
[1:45:55] or we was all whoever here to this
[1:45:57] morning. Just want that same
[1:46:00] person. Listen, God makes people
[1:46:03] different.
[1:46:04] Different ticks.
[1:46:08] I ain't talking about those out in the
[1:46:10] woods.
[1:46:14] I'm talking about personalities.
[1:46:18] Come on. It'd either be a real boring
[1:46:21] service or it would be a shout and
[1:46:23] hallelujah kind of service.
[1:46:26] But listen, it ain't all about Amen. You
[1:46:28] know, people think, well, I I I I got to
[1:46:30] shout. I got to No, here's what you got
[1:46:32] to do. Okay, I just give you what you
[1:46:34] got to do. When God moves, you move with
[1:46:37] him 100%.
[1:46:38] [Applause]
[1:46:41] Now, your 100% might be just lifting
[1:46:43] your hands and tears coming down your
[1:46:45] face. Your 100% might be waving some
[1:46:47] hankies and dancing up and down the
[1:46:49] aisle. But whatever it is, you move
[1:46:52] 100%. When God moves, you
[1:46:57] move. Whatever it is, give way to the
[1:47:00] spirit of God. If it's nothing but
[1:47:02] lifting up your hands and a hallelujah
[1:47:04] come out, let it come out.
[1:47:10] That's good.
[1:47:13] You're nothing but the manifestation of
[1:47:16] the gene of life that was in God as a
[1:47:18] son of God. But now you're expressed
[1:47:20] after his word has come to you, the
[1:47:21] light of this age. We you're expressing
[1:47:24] God's life in you because you are son
[1:47:26] and daughter of God. You're sitting in
[1:47:28] this church because it's your duty to
[1:47:30] express God.
[1:47:36] Hallelujah. Anyhow,
[1:47:39] I'm not going to let the devil get me
[1:47:40] down.
[1:47:42] It's your duty to express God
[1:47:47] wherever you are. God knew that you
[1:47:49] would be here because you had to be one
[1:47:50] of his genes or his attributes. If you
[1:47:52] got eternal life, then it was always was
[1:47:55] eternal life. God before the foundation
[1:47:57] of the world knew you would be here.
[1:48:04] Hallelujah. Amen. We're all attributes
[1:48:06] of God. Not living by creeds, not living
[1:48:08] by denominationalism, but we're living
[1:48:10] by the word of God. Because the bride is
[1:48:13] part of the bridegroom. Like any wife is
[1:48:15] part of her husband. We must be that
[1:48:17] word bride, the manifestation of this
[1:48:20] hour.
[1:48:22] Come on. Amen. Moses wasn't called to be
[1:48:24] the manifestation of right here.
[1:48:28] Can I say it? Brother Brandon wasn't
[1:48:30] even called to be the manifestation of
[1:48:32] 2025. All right. What is a manif what is
[1:48:36] a manifestation? It's the word made
[1:48:38] flesh.
[1:48:41] All right. So, but there is somebody
[1:48:44] called to be the manifestation of this
[1:48:47] hour.
[1:48:51] Martin Luther could not express the
[1:48:53] attributes we express.
[1:48:56] No, he couldn't do it. Amen. If he would
[1:48:59] have expressed the attributes we
[1:49:00] expressed, he'd have went in the
[1:49:01] rapture. Yeah, that's right. Cuz that's
[1:49:04] the attributes that's on the inside of
[1:49:05] us. Come on, somebody. Amen. The Bible
[1:49:08] expresses it. We're moving into a place.
[1:49:11] He said the great church that was
[1:49:12] established on the day of Pentecost by
[1:49:14] sending the Holy Ghost had to suffer
[1:49:15] martyrdom and go into the dirt into the
[1:49:17] earth and come again and the dark age to
[1:49:20] bring forth the age of Luther and Wesley
[1:49:22] all the way down till back to where it's
[1:49:24] a full stature of the bride of Jesus
[1:49:26] Christ for this last day. Therefore, the
[1:49:30] bride in the rapture will come forth
[1:49:34] because it's pre-planned by God. It's
[1:49:37] all backed up. God in his great for
[1:49:39] knowledge knew it. He said, "Don't
[1:49:40] stumble at that word predestination."
[1:49:43] Don't stumble at it. You heard about
[1:49:45] stumbling last night. Don't stumble at
[1:49:49] that. Well, I don't know. You know, when
[1:49:51] people stumble at it, they say, "Well, I
[1:49:52] will be will be." So, what difference
[1:49:54] does it make? No. Yeah.
[1:49:56] God has predestinated by his
[1:49:58] fornowledge.
[1:50:00] Cuz he saw you at the end what that you
[1:50:03] would be the same that you were at the
[1:50:04] beginning.
[1:50:07] He knew what choice you would make. Now
[1:50:09] you're always we're all here on choice.
[1:50:11] You came to church this morning by
[1:50:13] choice.
[1:50:15] Come on. You got up this morning by
[1:50:18] choice. You dressed in what you dressed
[1:50:20] in by choice. Well, maybe some of you
[1:50:23] men didn't. I don't know. But by
[1:50:26] choice. Catch that tomorrow
[1:50:30] maybe. But you you're you're expressing
[1:50:33] something. There's something. Amen. You
[1:50:35] listen. You worship God by choice.
[1:50:39] That's right.
[1:50:42] Listen. Our our worship to God should
[1:50:44] not be dictated by what's around us and
[1:50:47] circumstances around us.
[1:50:53] We, you know, I know we got a wonderful
[1:50:55] atmosphere and there's a lot of
[1:50:57] believers here, but you're going to go
[1:50:58] back to to your church or wherever
[1:51:00] you're from or or this church will be
[1:51:02] here. But listen, you worship God by
[1:51:05] choice. It don't have to be a special
[1:51:07] meeting to worship God.
[1:51:10] It can be on a Wednesday
[1:51:13] night that you have fought through hell
[1:51:15] and you have fought through everything
[1:51:17] and you come to the house of God. Why do
[1:51:19] we do that? We fight and we fight to get
[1:51:21] here. Then we just sit down and we just
[1:51:23] go through the motions and we just go
[1:51:25] through it and we go back. No. If I'm
[1:51:27] going to fight to get here, I'm going to
[1:51:29] fight while I'm here.
[1:51:34] I'm going to give everything I have cuz
[1:51:37] he gave everything for me.
[1:51:44] [Applause]
[1:51:47] There's nothing like a praise when
[1:51:49] you're down in the valley.
[1:51:52] That's true praise. That's true
[1:51:54] adoration. That when you're down in the
[1:51:56] valley and and every demon is against
[1:51:58] you and Satan has attacked your body or
[1:52:01] attacked your mind in spite of it all,
[1:52:03] you'll still raise some hands up and
[1:52:05] you'll still give glory to God. And you
[1:52:07] when that rained against the fall,
[1:52:09] you'll still praise him.
[1:52:14] Hallelujah.
[1:52:17] Now, we know the rain falls on the just
[1:52:19] and the unjust.
[1:52:22] But there's nothing wrong with the rain.
[1:52:25] That doesn't make the rain wrong. If
[1:52:27] somebody that's unjust spray lifts their
[1:52:29] hands and praises. That's what he said
[1:52:31] in the Bible. He said when the rain
[1:52:32] comes, it falls on the tears and the
[1:52:34] wheat.
[1:52:36] And brother Bham had this question. He's
[1:52:38] like, why? Why is one can get up and and
[1:52:40] he can prophesy and be just exactly the
[1:52:43] truth. And you know the story there was
[1:52:45] a translation of tongues went forth. One
[1:52:47] gave this tongues and other translated.
[1:52:49] He shook both of them's hand. He said
[1:52:50] one of them was a Christian, one of them
[1:52:52] wasn't. And he had this question why how
[1:52:54] can this be that that that that can
[1:52:57] happen? And God showed in the scripture
[1:52:58] that the rain falls on the just and the
[1:53:01] unjust. Right.
[1:53:05] But somehow we get in our mind that, you
[1:53:08] know, we we we if we we get emotional or
[1:53:10] something like that, you know, listen, I
[1:53:12] think if we ought to if if you're
[1:53:14] nothing but a tear, you ought at least
[1:53:16] be a biblical
[1:53:18] tear. Raise your hands up and rejoice.
[1:53:24] But I'm not a tear.
[1:53:26] [Music]
[1:53:28] But I can say this. If a tear can
[1:53:30] rejoice,
[1:53:32] If a tear can praise God, if a tear can
[1:53:35] say hallelujah and think, what can a
[1:53:38] true
[1:53:39] witch has been born of the spirit of
[1:53:41] God, what can they
[1:53:44] [Applause]
[1:53:51] do?
[1:53:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In very plain
[1:53:56] language, the true bride of Christ was
[1:53:58] in the mind of God eternally, though not
[1:54:00] expressed until it came forth in his
[1:54:02] designated decreed season. So each
[1:54:05] member came forth to become expressed to
[1:54:08] look take his place in the body. Thus
[1:54:10] this bride is the literal spoken word
[1:54:12] seed bride.
[1:54:16] Is the sun the spoken word?
[1:54:19] Do you ever worry about it coming up in
[1:54:21] the morning? Come on. Go ahead. Is the
[1:54:24] moon the spoken word to stars earth?
[1:54:27] Well, you're also the spoken word.
[1:54:31] So why are you worrying about things
[1:54:32] when God's got the answer for it all? We
[1:54:34] heard it last night. We have the answer.
[1:54:37] He's got the answer for your situation.
[1:54:39] He's got the answer for your need.
[1:54:43] Come on, somebody. I know he does.
[1:54:47] He'll send the answer before while
[1:54:49] you're crying out about it and you're
[1:54:50] crying and lamenting before God
[1:54:52] sometimes will send the answer and it's
[1:54:53] already there. That's right.
[1:54:56] Can I tell you a little testimony? I
[1:54:58] just feel to do it right now. My wife's
[1:55:01] been going through a lot of health
[1:55:02] issues and have I have a lot of have had
[1:55:04] a lot of uh expenses and things from
[1:55:06] that and and and all kinds of other
[1:55:08] things were going on in our life a
[1:55:10] couple of years ago and and I I was just
[1:55:12] like, you know, trying to remodel some
[1:55:13] things in my house and couldn't never
[1:55:14] get ahead. You know how it is. Yeah.
[1:55:17] Well, some of you do. All right.
[1:55:21] Anyway, on a Friday, I was crying out to
[1:55:24] God. On a Saturday, Sunday, I got up and
[1:55:27] I led the singing. Did I feel like
[1:55:29] leading the singing?
[1:55:31] Nope. Did people know I didn't feel like
[1:55:33] leading the singing? Nope.
[1:55:38] That's a good lesson right there. You
[1:55:40] know, we we don't feel like coming to
[1:55:42] church, but we want to make sure when we
[1:55:43] get here and everybody knows we didn't
[1:55:45] feel like coming.
[1:55:47] Come on. That's one thing I appreciate
[1:55:50] about Brother Ron Spencer is he's been
[1:55:52] fighting a fight for 5 years, but
[1:55:54] there's a lot of people does not even
[1:55:55] have a clue
[1:55:58] because you ask him, you talk to him,
[1:55:59] there's a smile on his face. He might
[1:56:01] have been puking his guts up just a few
[1:56:03] minutes before, but there's a smile on
[1:56:05] his face.
[1:56:09] Hallelujah. Anyhow, come on, somebody.
[1:56:12] Amen. It get you say, "Well, I'm just a
[1:56:14] hypocrite." No, you're not a hypocrite.
[1:56:17] I don't want to be a hypocrite. I just
[1:56:18] We had a fuss on the way to church, and
[1:56:20] I want everybody to know I had a
[1:56:24] fuss. Listen, the church don't need to
[1:56:26] know about your Oh, I'm getting into
[1:56:27] some things right now. Help me. Is this
[1:56:29] okay, Brother Tom? We're here anyway.
[1:56:32] Lord, help me. Amen. And you know,
[1:56:34] church don't need to know about your
[1:56:35] fuss.
[1:56:37] What the church needs to see is hands
[1:56:39] lifted up and praises given to God.
[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:47] [Music]
[1:56:49] But I tell you, when I got through, I
[1:56:51] went to my back room, back office, and I
[1:56:53] fell on the floor, and I said, "God, I
[1:56:54] need you to move. I need some help. I
[1:56:57] need I I need to know that you have seen
[1:56:59] me, and you know what I'm going through.
[1:57:01] I I feel like I'm just I'm losing my
[1:57:03] grip.
[1:57:06] Next morning on a Monday morning, uh
[1:57:09] Sister Ruth would go and take a little
[1:57:11] walk with one of her daughter-in-laws
[1:57:12] and and and we had been away from the
[1:57:14] house and hadn't been even home till
[1:57:16] Saturday, I believe it was, and we
[1:57:17] failed to check the mail. Anyway, she
[1:57:19] walked by the mailbox and it was before
[1:57:21] the mailman run that morning and uh she
[1:57:24] opened the mailbox and there was a card
[1:57:26] in
[1:57:27] there and and and so she brings it in.
[1:57:30] I'm sitting on the couch and I'm going
[1:57:32] to be honest with you, I didn't feel
[1:57:33] real anointed. All right.
[1:57:36] I I didn't feel like it was a great
[1:57:38] Monday. I mean, you
[1:57:40] know, and she said, "Here, something for
[1:57:43] you." I said, "For me." And I open it up
[1:57:44] and there's a card giving thanksgiving
[1:57:46] for a life that was surrendered to
[1:57:48] Christ and how how you've touched many.
[1:57:50] And and I open it up and there's a check
[1:57:52] that's wrote out. And it's not just
[1:57:55] enough, it's more than enough.
[1:57:58] [Applause]
[1:58:10] And I got to realizing while I was
[1:58:12] crying, while I was calling out to God,
[1:58:15] God was looking at me and said, "Will
[1:58:17] you just go to the mailbox?
[1:58:20] I've already provided for your need
[1:58:22] before you ever got here. I've already
[1:58:25] got somebody that was sensitive to hear
[1:58:27] the spirit of God and write out a check
[1:58:30] and send it to you. Come on, somebody.
[1:58:32] This is what he's been telling you this
[1:58:34] whole weekend. Amen. I've already got a
[1:58:36] mailbox full of promises of God. All you
[1:58:39] got to do is
[1:58:41] go to the word. Go to the promises of
[1:58:45] God. God's got enough. He's not just
[1:58:47] enough. He's more than enough.
[1:58:56] [Applause]
[1:58:57] on the way to on the we read it the
[1:58:59] other night. I didn't tie it in, but
[1:59:01] I'll do it right now. On the road to
[1:59:02] Emmas, they're worried about things.
[1:59:04] They're wondering about things and how
[1:59:06] can these things be here? We thought
[1:59:07] he's going to be a prophet here. We
[1:59:09] thought he's going to be a deliverer.
[1:59:10] And look, they died and somebody said he
[1:59:11] rose, but we can't find his body. And we
[1:59:13] don't all kind of question. All of a
[1:59:15] sudden, while they're thinking about
[1:59:16] him, he steps out of the bushes.
[1:59:18] Hallelujah.
[1:59:20] Brother Bram said, you know, when you're
[1:59:21] talking about him, you're thinking about
[1:59:22] him. That's when he comes around and he
[1:59:24] steps out of the bushes and he begins to
[1:59:26] talk to him. Now, their eyes didn't see
[1:59:28] who they did. They say their eyes were
[1:59:30] veiled and they couldn't see him.
[1:59:32] Cuz he had a body change.
[1:59:35] Come on, somebody.
[1:59:38] Before Before the B before the cross,
[1:59:40] even the even the Pharisees were looking
[1:59:42] said, "You're not a man over 50." He
[1:59:44] wasn't even he was about 30 years old.
[1:59:46] He looking
[1:59:47] old. Brother Andrew, you know he's a
[1:59:50] young whippers snapper. Jump all over
[1:59:52] this place, shout and dance. I wish I
[1:59:54] could do that. He young. But even this
[1:59:57] morning, he said, "I feel like I'm about
[1:59:58] 80 years
[2:00:01] old." Yeah. What am I going to feel like
[2:00:03] when I get
[2:00:06] done? But here, he's had a body change.
[2:00:09] All right. He don't he don't look like
[2:00:12] he did at the cross. It's he's been
[2:00:14] glorified and their eyes were veiled to
[2:00:17] see who he was. But he began to explain
[2:00:19] to them and tell them about what he did
[2:00:21] all the way from Moses all the way
[2:00:23] down. And the scripture says he made as
[2:00:26] if he would go further
[2:00:28] and they constrained him. Said, "No, no,
[2:00:30] no, no, no. Uh-uh. You've been telling
[2:00:32] us some good things. Come on in here."
[2:00:36] Hallelujah. And the Bible says as they
[2:00:38] were sitting down to eat, he be to break
[2:00:40] bread. And when he broke the bread,
[2:00:43] their eyes came open.
[2:00:45] [Applause]
[2:00:46] Why was that? Why did their eyes come
[2:00:48] out? It wasn't a certain way that he
[2:00:50] held the bread or he tore the bread.
[2:00:52] When he tore the bread, there was
[2:00:54] another piece
[2:00:56] there. Hallelujah. Amen. He was still
[2:00:59] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:01:02] When he tore it, there was another piece
[2:01:04] there. When he tore it, that tells me
[2:01:06] he's got enough. And he's not just
[2:01:08] enough. He's more than enough. I'm here
[2:01:10] to tell you this morning, maybe you
[2:01:12] haven't got your peace yet, but he's got
[2:01:15] a peace for
[2:01:16] you. He's got some bread of life that he
[2:01:19] can give you even now,
[2:01:23] cuz he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:01:25] forever.
[2:01:29] He's a provider of your needs.
[2:01:33] Now, he said, Brother Brandon said, I I
[2:01:35] mentioned this the other night, but I I
[2:01:37] want to I I want to bring this down. He
[2:01:39] says, "We did not become seed. By the
[2:01:41] rebirth, we were seeds and therefore we
[2:01:43] could be reborn."
[2:01:45] For only the elect can be reborn because
[2:01:47] we were seed. That's the reason we could
[2:01:50] be quickened.
[2:01:52] Hallelujah. That's the reason why you
[2:01:54] could have been in some denominational
[2:01:55] system, but all of a sudden you heard a
[2:01:59] sound. Something quickened on the inside
[2:02:02] of you. Amen. I told about our brother
[2:02:04] in our church, Brother Elder Dale. Black
[2:02:06] brothers over in Mississippi. Amen. this
[2:02:08] young man come by his way and said and
[2:02:10] just be to talk to him said you know it
[2:02:11] wasn't the apple in the garden he said
[2:02:13] what
[2:02:15] what was it he began to explain to him
[2:02:18] serpent seed and brother it's something
[2:02:20] on the inside be to quicken he said I
[2:02:22] always knew I always questioned that
[2:02:24] always wondered how could it be an apple
[2:02:25] how could it be fruit and that caused
[2:02:27] all that we're going through I knew it
[2:02:29] had to be more than that and he told
[2:02:31] that brother he said when you he said I
[2:02:32] don't want you to be gone long now he
[2:02:34] said I want you to come on back and tell
[2:02:35] me some more
[2:02:37] and he got to hearing the word of God
[2:02:39] and he got to believe in the word of God
[2:02:41] and God came down and showed him who he
[2:02:43] was. That he wasn't hell of born in sin
[2:02:46] shaped in iniquity but he was a son of
[2:02:48] God before the foundation of the world.
[2:02:51] Amen. And all of a sudden it quickened
[2:02:53] his life to eternal life.
[2:02:57] Quicken that seed that was on the inside
[2:02:59] of him. Sometimes you wonder why didn't
[2:03:02] this get it? Why don't that one get it?
[2:03:04] Why don't that one get it? there. If
[2:03:06] they ain't got no seed, there ain't
[2:03:07] nothing to quicken.
[2:03:09] But if there's a seed on the inside,
[2:03:12] amen. When that light strikes that seed,
[2:03:14] it will come to life. That's thus sayeth
[2:03:17] the Lord.
[2:03:19] [Applause]
[2:03:23] He says, "No, nonseed there's nothing to
[2:03:26] quicken." He said, "Now let's take the
[2:03:27] next step. Redeem means to buy back. It
[2:03:30] restores back to the original owner by
[2:03:32] God by his death. the shed blood,
[2:03:34] brought back his own. He brought back
[2:03:36] the spoken word. See, bribe, my sheep
[2:03:38] hear my voice and they follow me. You
[2:03:40] always were a sheep.
[2:03:44] Come on. You never was a pig or a dog.
[2:03:49] Can I just say it in our language? You
[2:03:51] never was a Methodist or a Baptist or a
[2:03:54] Presbyterian or That wasn't who you was
[2:03:59] or Amish or Menite. That's not who you
[2:04:01] was.
[2:04:03] Amen. There was something on the inside.
[2:04:05] It's impossible for that is impossible
[2:04:08] for every kind of life produce the same
[2:04:10] kind. There's no change in species. So
[2:04:12] you never was a pig or a dog that was
[2:04:14] turned to a sheep.
[2:04:17] No. No. You was always a sheep.
[2:04:20] You was always a son. You were always a
[2:04:23] daughter. And if you always were, you
[2:04:25] always will be.
[2:04:31] Amen. A son of God though can go a long
[2:04:34] time before he recognizes he's a son.
[2:04:39] It's kind of like that story brother
[2:04:41] tells several times about that little
[2:04:42] baby eagle that was hatched out under a
[2:04:44] hen and he knew something was wrong. He
[2:04:46] said that eagle is a type of every true
[2:04:48] believer. The farmer had taken that egg
[2:04:50] of that from that eagle's nest and put
[2:04:52] it under a hen. In due time, all the
[2:04:54] eggs were hatched hatched hatched out on
[2:04:56] that hen. And baby chicks got along fine
[2:04:58] with the mother hen. But the little
[2:04:59] eagle could figure couldn't figure out
[2:05:01] what all this clucking and scratching
[2:05:02] for food in a manure pile was all about.
[2:05:05] He wasn't born for a chicken pin.
[2:05:09] He was born to eat chickens.
[2:05:13] [Applause]
[2:05:16] Come on,
[2:05:18] somebody. Hallelujah. I like that. Now
[2:05:21] come on, brother Juwel. Brother Juel for
[2:05:23] he'd like that real good, wouldn't he?
[2:05:25] He'd born to eat chicken. But one day
[2:05:27] from way up in the air, Amen. as he was
[2:05:30] pecking around trying to find a little
[2:05:32] food here and a little crumb there, it
[2:05:34] never would satisfy. Come on. You know
[2:05:35] what that was like. Some of y'all pecked
[2:05:37] around in denominational systems for
[2:05:39] years and years, but something would
[2:05:41] never satisfy. It was something on the
[2:05:43] inside. There's got to be more. There's
[2:05:45] got to be something more. I I can't just
[2:05:47] get enough out of this three head. Amen.
[2:05:49] Three God system. I can't get enough out
[2:05:51] of being baptized in the name of the
[2:05:53] father, son, and holy ghost.
[2:05:56] There's got to be more.
[2:05:59] And all of a sudden,
[2:06:03] there came a scream from a different
[2:06:05] dimension.
[2:06:07] It's eagle just a picking around and he
[2:06:09] hears a scream. He looks up. Now, when
[2:06:13] that scream happened, I can tell you
[2:06:14] what happened to all them chickens. They
[2:06:16] scattered.
[2:06:18] No, it ain't for me. Yes. Days of
[2:06:19] miracles are passed. Ain't no such a
[2:06:21] thing as a baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:06:22] Ain't run back to the roof. But that
[2:06:24] eagle on the
[2:06:27] inside.
[2:06:28] Woo. That's what I'm talking about.
[2:06:32] That's where I came from. That's who I
[2:06:35] really
[2:06:37] am. How can I get up there? How can I
[2:06:40] get up
[2:06:43] there? That scream come out. Why don't
[2:06:45] you just just jump on up to
[2:06:47] justification? Jump on up to
[2:06:49] sanctification. Get on up to the baptism
[2:06:51] of the Holy Ghost. Adopted sons and
[2:06:53] daughters of Jesus Christ. You were
[2:06:56] given two
[2:06:57] wings. Oh my. You didn't realize that
[2:07:01] while you was in that chicken yard, you
[2:07:02] were never a chicken. You was always an
[2:07:04] eagle. You always had an eagle beak. You
[2:07:07] always had an eagle nature. You always
[2:07:09] had eagle
[2:07:11] wings.
[2:07:13] Woo. Amen. No storms of life. Amen. A
[2:07:17] chicken can't fly in them, but an eagle
[2:07:19] is destined to fly. Amen. When the
[2:07:22] storms come, it don't do nothing but
[2:07:24] lift him up higher,
[2:07:27] cuz they were given wings to fly.
[2:07:33] But yet, this eagle in the chicken yard
[2:07:35] had a decision to make. Are you going to
[2:07:37] jump up? Are you going to get up?
[2:07:41] How long you going to sit there? How
[2:07:43] long you going to allow yourself to stay
[2:07:44] in that situation? All right. He had to
[2:07:48] come to recognize he wasn't made for a
[2:07:50] barnyard.
[2:07:54] Brother Brandham talks about this and he
[2:07:56] reads a scripture. He says, and this is
[2:07:58] where I want to tie this into, I will
[2:07:59] go. He said they called Rebecca and said
[2:08:02] to her, "Wil thou go with this man?" And
[2:08:04] she said, "I will go." He said, you
[2:08:06] know, you've been forced to make
[2:08:08] decisions. There's times we have come to
[2:08:10] a place where we got to say yes or no.
[2:08:15] That's human life. There's a time when
[2:08:18] we cannot stand neutral.
[2:08:23] Come on, somebody. There's a time you
[2:08:25] cannot no longer stand neutral about the
[2:08:27] moving of the spirit.
[2:08:30] You can't stand neutral about the
[2:08:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:08:37] Amen. We're not just puttering around in
[2:08:38] neutral. Listen, brother Brandon, when
[2:08:41] he left, he left a car that would drive.
[2:08:46] Remember what he talked about? He talked
[2:08:47] about the dynamics and the mechanics. He
[2:08:49] said, "Some people's got all the
[2:08:51] mechanics and they they can polish up
[2:08:52] the hubs and they got a beautiful car."
[2:08:54] He said, "But it ain't got a lick of
[2:08:55] spark on the inside. You can
[2:08:59] [Applause]
[2:09:01] rang and it won't crank up." He said,
[2:09:03] "Why?" Cuz they they put water in the
[2:09:05] tank. He said, "What? It needs some good
[2:09:07] gasoline.
[2:09:09] He said, "But not only does it need
[2:09:11] gasoline, it's also got to have a spark
[2:09:13] that'll spark it off."
[2:09:16] Come on. That's why he would tell us. He
[2:09:18] said, "We have spent too much time on
[2:09:20] the mechanics and not enough time on the
[2:09:24] dynamics." Come on. We have taught this
[2:09:27] and we have taught that and we have
[2:09:29] taught this and we have taught that.
[2:09:30] Amen. A lot of mechanics, but amen. The
[2:09:33] word of God is the dynamics.
[2:09:36] It's the spirit of God that'll bring a
[2:09:38] church, amen, a body to life again.
[2:09:44] We need both.
[2:09:50] You got to have two wings to fly.
[2:09:55] You know how we I was I've had a farm
[2:09:58] and we've had chickens. You know how you
[2:10:00] keep a chicken from getting out? Clip
[2:10:02] one of his wings.
[2:10:04] It'll flutter and carry on and it can't
[2:10:06] never get up above a fence about this
[2:10:08] high. That's what the devil has done.
[2:10:10] He's come through and clipped the wing.
[2:10:13] He's either took the word out or he's
[2:10:15] took the spirit out.
[2:10:18] Good right there. Come on, somebody. We
[2:10:20] got to have both to fly. We got to have
[2:10:23] the Old and the New Testament. We got to
[2:10:24] have spirit and truth.
[2:10:27] We got to have word and we got to have
[2:10:29] spirit
[2:10:31] because the spirit is what makes the
[2:10:32] word live. Amen. The spirit I mean the
[2:10:35] prophet Paul would say about it. He says
[2:10:37] the word the letter kleth but the spirit
[2:10:39] giveth life. Amen. You can have a bunch
[2:10:42] of word and let me tell you the word
[2:10:43] without spirit is nothing but a bunch of
[2:10:45] intellectual ideas and psychology and
[2:10:48] their own man's creeds and dogmas. But
[2:10:51] if you can get the spirit into the word,
[2:10:53] the spirit will carry the word to the
[2:10:55] people and then they can receive it.
[2:10:59] This is why we got to have the moving of
[2:11:01] the spirit. This is why we got to have
[2:11:03] the Holy Ghost to have freedom in our
[2:11:04] lives. He's been bound up long enough in
[2:11:08] creeds of denominational systems.
[2:11:13] Well, I ain't no denomination. Well, let
[2:11:14] me tell you, the message is also can
[2:11:16] denominationalize.
[2:11:19] [Music]
[2:11:20] Oh, you're saying, "No, I don't believe
[2:11:21] that the message." Well, let me tell
[2:11:22] you. Let me make a differential here.
[2:11:24] Amen. The word never will. The word
[2:11:27] didn't in Luther's day. The word didn't
[2:11:28] in uh Wesley's day.
[2:11:32] It moved right on. The people did. The
[2:11:35] movement did.
[2:11:38] And the cycle of revival and death has
[2:11:40] never failed. Let me tell you, this
[2:11:41] message as far as the movement is going
[2:11:43] to go down into death.
[2:11:46] I know that hurts a lot of people. Amen.
[2:11:49] Because the movement is going to die.
[2:11:50] It's never failed. But that word will
[2:11:53] not die.
[2:11:56] This word will not fail. This word is
[2:11:59] going to catch somebody and they're
[2:12:01] going to move beyond the shackles of
[2:12:03] denominations and beyond the shackles of
[2:12:05] some man's idea and beyond the shackles
[2:12:08] of human intellectual understanding and
[2:12:10] they're going to fly into the
[2:12:12] heavenlies.
[2:12:14] Oh, I pray that the winds of the Holy
[2:12:16] Spirit will move through this building
[2:12:18] and lift you up.
[2:12:22] [Music]
[2:12:25] That's what the devil wants to do. wants
[2:12:26] to come along our message movement and
[2:12:28] clip out a spirit or clip out the word.
[2:12:31] All right. We got to have both.
[2:12:36] He said, he said, "But the time came for
[2:12:38] Abraham to make a decision for his son
[2:12:41] Isaac." He said he had waited for him
[2:12:44] and received him as one from the dead.
[2:12:46] But the time came to make a decision who
[2:12:48] will be his helpmate. See, God don't
[2:12:50] make all of our decisions.
[2:12:53] I'm I'm bringing a balance. See, God
[2:12:54] doesn't bring make all of our decisions.
[2:12:57] There's many times that God doesn't even
[2:12:59] tell his prophet just what to do.
[2:13:03] Oh, that that hurt a lot of people's
[2:13:04] feelings right there. But that's what he
[2:13:05] said.
[2:13:08] He said, "If there's no decision we have
[2:13:10] to make, just wait on a move on God.
[2:13:11] Wait wait wait wait ever move on God,
[2:13:13] then there'll be and then we'd just wait
[2:13:15] for him to move every time. We didn't
[2:13:16] have to make no decision. There wouldn't
[2:13:18] be no overcoming on our part." And he
[2:13:20] said, "And sometimes we make the wrong
[2:13:23] decisions."
[2:13:25] He said, "Look, now this is what he
[2:13:27] said. God's anointed prophets make the
[2:13:30] wrong decisions."
[2:13:34] Uh-oh.
[2:13:36] Many times they are deceived. Right.
[2:13:40] What? Well, the Bible says Elijah was a
[2:13:43] man loved like passions.
[2:13:46] He was a
[2:13:47] man. And it's no different than the
[2:13:49] Elijah that came in this ministry. Amen.
[2:13:52] The spirit of Christ that came, but he
[2:13:53] used a man.
[2:13:57] I know some people want to make him lift
[2:13:58] him up and God gone. Everything on the
[2:14:00] tapes says, "Thus sayaith the Lord." No.
[2:14:01] Everything on the tapes is not thus
[2:14:02] sayeth the Lord. Brother Brandham even
[2:14:04] said it himself. He said, "You got to
[2:14:05] watch. Some of this is just William
[2:14:07] Brandom."
[2:14:12] Come on. But the message, the word is
[2:14:15] thus sayeth the Lord.
[2:14:20] Yes, sir. Amen. It is thus sayith the
[2:14:23] Lord.
[2:14:25] Thus sayith the Lord is on the text.
[2:14:28] That's right.
[2:14:31] I hope you understand what I'm trying to
[2:14:32] say there.
[2:14:34] He said, "See, even Elijah, the mighty
[2:14:36] man of God, when the Shounomite woman
[2:14:38] came rushing in weepingly, Elijah knew
[2:14:40] that she was troubled, but he said, "God
[2:14:42] has kept it from me." Yeah.
[2:14:45] So at the time being allotted every man
[2:14:46] to make a decision whether he's a
[2:14:48] preacher or a prophet or a church member
[2:14:49] whatever more he's got to make a
[2:14:51] decision the time came and Abraham was
[2:14:53] determined he did not want his son to
[2:14:54] marry an unbeliever that's a good good
[2:14:57] thing to follow that would be a good
[2:14:59] decision for Christians today who are
[2:15:00] sons and daughters of Abraham make the
[2:15:02] same decision about your children it
[2:15:05] didn't make any difference how pretty
[2:15:06] those unbelieving girls were how nice
[2:15:08] the women were but Abraham didn't want
[2:15:10] his son connected with that kind of
[2:15:11] stuff so he had to make a decision the
[2:15:13] time came and he made a decision. So, we
[2:15:16] learned a beautiful lesson. A type of
[2:15:17] God, the father hunting for a servant to
[2:15:20] go find a bride for his son. That's what
[2:15:22] the father's done today. He's looking
[2:15:24] over his group to see someone he can put
[2:15:26] trust in. And I can say he found it.
[2:15:31] Amen. The prophet that came in this
[2:15:33] generation, William Brandom, there was
[2:15:35] somebody God could put his trust in. Cuz
[2:15:37] if anybody else would have took it,
[2:15:38] they' have sold it for millions of
[2:15:40] dollars. They'd have sold it for fleets
[2:15:42] of Cadillac. But he put all of that
[2:15:44] aside.
[2:15:47] I mean, look what Billy Graham did with
[2:15:49] the gift he had in his life. Or or
[2:15:52] Roberts with a gift they had in their
[2:15:53] life.
[2:15:57] What could he done with that gift?
[2:16:00] People tried to, I'll write you a $2
[2:16:01] million check if you'll come pray, but
[2:16:03] if God told him not to, he wouldn't go.
[2:16:08] Just laying a few things here. We're
[2:16:09] going somewhere.
[2:16:11] He says many goes just for what money
[2:16:13] they can get out it. Other goes to make
[2:16:15] a great name for themselves. Other goes
[2:16:17] to be
[2:16:18] popular. He said but Abraham represents
[2:16:21] the model servant. And Eleazar
[2:16:24] represents a model servant. He said that
[2:16:26] he how he did not go until he was sent.
[2:16:32] Come on somebody. That's where a
[2:16:34] preacher needs to make sure they're
[2:16:35] sent.
[2:16:37] not by another man or even their own
[2:16:39] desires, but they're sent by God.
[2:16:45] I mean, I I I grew up as a preacher son,
[2:16:48] but you know what? My father wouldn't
[2:16:49] let anybody he wouldn't let anybody ever
[2:16:52] ask me if I was going to be a preacher.
[2:16:54] He said, "Because I know if he you put
[2:16:56] that in him and he begins to have that
[2:16:57] desire, Amen. because of some man said
[2:17:00] something or I said something," he said,
[2:17:01] "If if it's put in there by man's
[2:17:03] desire, man will have to take care of
[2:17:04] him." All right. But if it's a desire
[2:17:06] that God has put in there, a gift and a
[2:17:08] calling that God has placed there.
[2:17:11] He said, "Then God will take care of
[2:17:13] him." And listen, I had to battle it
[2:17:15] out. I battled it out for nights and
[2:17:17] days and months, even years. Amen. I
[2:17:19] would even get married. Sister Roo, she
[2:17:21] didn't even know she was going to marry
[2:17:22] a
[2:17:23] preacher. Pray for
[2:17:29] her. Amen. And here for years, I
[2:17:31] wouldn't even read I wouldn't even read
[2:17:33] the Bible. I wouldn't even pray because
[2:17:35] it was so strike me and I knew what it
[2:17:37] was and I was so scared of
[2:17:39] it cuz I knew what the calling was and I
[2:17:42] knew the responsibility and I knew it
[2:17:44] wasn't just something I can go out on a
[2:17:46] whim and say I don't want to work. I
[2:17:47] don't want to do that. I want to be a
[2:17:48] preacher. I don't know how anybody I
[2:17:50] don't even know why I'm here but we're
[2:17:51] here anyway. I don't know why anybody
[2:17:54] wants to be a preacher.
[2:17:57] I don't get it. If you want to be a
[2:17:58] preacher, it gives me a thought in my
[2:18:00] mind that you probably ain't one.
[2:18:02] Oh,
[2:18:04] what the prophet said, God called men.
[2:18:07] Go listen to it. He said, "We don't need
[2:18:09] just men. We need God called men."
[2:18:12] That's the reason why we got a lot of
[2:18:14] problems already in the message cuz men,
[2:18:16] they get this idea that this is what
[2:18:18] they are and who they are and they put
[2:18:20] their own intellectual ability to it and
[2:18:22] they're men called or man called or
[2:18:24] their own called. But God needs God
[2:18:27] called men.
[2:18:31] [Applause]
[2:18:33] You know why? Cuz God is looking for men
[2:18:36] today that'll move when the spirit
[2:18:38] moves.
[2:18:40] Direct quote. Anywhere that he may sin,
[2:18:42] that's a model servant. Not only that,
[2:18:44] but when he got to his place, the
[2:18:45] message was to be given. He never
[2:18:47] boasted on himself. He never spoke about
[2:18:49] how great he was or how great his
[2:18:50] meetings was or how anything about
[2:18:52] himself. He wasn't a boaster or proud.
[2:18:54] He only spoke of his master and his
[2:18:56] master's wealth. and that his master had
[2:18:58] a son that was going to fall heir to
[2:19:00] everything the master had. What a
[2:19:02] beautiful picture of a real servant of
[2:19:03] God. His whole attention was on the
[2:19:06] master
[2:19:08] telling the people not about himself but
[2:19:10] about the master
[2:19:12] and the master has a son and he's going
[2:19:14] to fall heir to it all.
[2:19:18] He said but Eleazar was confronted with
[2:19:20] a great problem like ministers are
[2:19:22] today. There's a whole lot of women we
[2:19:24] could choose
[2:19:25] from, but God has one ordained. All
[2:19:28] right.
[2:19:31] And here he
[2:19:33] is. Here he comes down to the well or
[2:19:37] before he goes, he says, "I I what he
[2:19:40] starts questioning. He said, "What if
[2:19:41] this woman won't come? What if I tell
[2:19:43] her these things? What if she doesn't
[2:19:44] come?" He had a decision. He's tore up
[2:19:46] about it. And Abraham says, "But the
[2:19:49] angel of God will go before you." Yeah.
[2:19:51] He said, "I like that so much cuz that
[2:19:53] fits my case right there. The angel of
[2:19:56] the Lord shall go before you. He'll
[2:19:58] persuade her." And God sent his angel
[2:19:59] with the messenger. That's the way he
[2:20:01] does. He sent it with Daniel. He sent it
[2:20:03] with Paul. He sent it with with so many
[2:20:05] down through the scriptures. Amen. He
[2:20:07] said, "But here he was." was he said he
[2:20:09] he he said he said he came down to that
[2:20:12] well and he's like Lord Lord I'm asking
[2:20:15] you now that that you come and you you
[2:20:17] you anoint the one that that's going to
[2:20:19] be Isaac's wife that she'll not only
[2:20:21] give me water but she'll also water the
[2:20:24] camels.
[2:20:26] Amen. And he and he said and he said
[2:20:29] brother Brandon brings it like this
[2:20:30] brings it so beautiful. Just give me
[2:20:31] just a moment. He said it was about the
[2:20:33] time Amen. Rebecca was sitting there and
[2:20:36] here she is maybe wondering what's her
[2:20:38] purpose and why she's here. Why was I
[2:20:40] born in this certain family? He said,
[2:20:41] "But all of a sudden something begin to
[2:20:43] stir on the inside of her." He said,
[2:20:45] "Why?" He said, "I believe the angel of
[2:20:47] the Lord beat Eleazar to the well by
[2:20:50] about a half an hour."
[2:20:53] Good lance. Do you know what's been here
[2:20:56] before you even got here? Do you know
[2:20:58] why the blessings have been flowing like
[2:20:59] they've been flowing? Cuz the angel was
[2:21:01] here before you got here.
[2:21:06] Hallelujah. He will send his angels
[2:21:08] before you and that will make the way
[2:21:11] clear.
[2:21:13] He said it must have been that angel
[2:21:15] that tapped on her Rebecca's heart and
[2:21:17] said go to the well.
[2:21:20] She don't know what's happened and she
[2:21:22] don't know why and she don't know where
[2:21:24] or what's going on. And here she comes.
[2:21:26] He said it's the church the same as the
[2:21:28] church. The evening lights are here.
[2:21:29] It's time for that angel of the Lord.
[2:21:31] The supernatural is revealing himself to
[2:21:33] a Rebecca again to go to Isaac. Somehow
[2:21:35] or another, she's moved to go to the
[2:21:37] waters of life. Oh my, my heart's
[2:21:39] rejoicing with praise. I can hardly
[2:21:41] preach when I think of it. The evening
[2:21:43] time has come. The angels of the Lord
[2:21:45] and the message goes forth and it's
[2:21:46] wooing a Rebecca to come to the waters
[2:21:48] of life moving of the supernatural.
[2:21:51] Amen. Elazer said, "Oh Lord God, I need
[2:21:54] something supernatural to happen. You've
[2:21:56] sent my angel before me. Now let him do
[2:21:58] something. He knows who's supposed to
[2:22:00] be. He knows the girl. Let the woman
[2:22:02] that comes and gives me a drink out of
[2:22:04] the picture, may she also water my
[2:22:06] camels without asking, let it be that
[2:22:08] one be the one. And no more, and he said
[2:22:10] it, Rebecca came to the
[2:22:14] well. God's right on time.
[2:22:18] He said, "No more than your heart will
[2:22:20] go to hunger and thirsting for God, some
[2:22:23] kind of Holy Ghost revival will break
[2:22:26] out."
[2:22:27] [Applause]
[2:22:29] You know why we're having these
[2:22:31] meetings? Cuz somebody was hungry.
[2:22:33] Somebody was thirsty. Somebody said, "I
[2:22:36] want a fresh drink at the water of
[2:22:40] life. Somebody was praying. Somebody was
[2:22:43] asking. Somebody was knocking. Somebody
[2:22:46] was seeking."
[2:22:53] Hallelujah. Why did Rebecca make that
[2:22:55] sudden move? Why did she go to the
[2:22:57] waters of life so quickly? Why could the
[2:23:00] angel speak to her? Oh
[2:23:03] my. Why would she do
[2:23:08] that? Oh, I got your attention right
[2:23:11] now. Cuz she was blood relation to
[2:23:14] Isaac.
[2:23:18] Hallelujah. Why would you move towards
[2:23:20] God? Why would you move into the
[2:23:22] supernatural realm? Why would you hunger
[2:23:24] and thirst? Why would you have that? Cuz
[2:23:27] you are blood relation to Jesus
[2:23:30] Christ. Hallelujah. The one that the
[2:23:33] angel can speak
[2:23:35] to. It's a blood relation. The blood.
[2:23:38] We're born in the body of Christ. I She
[2:23:41] was Isaac's cousin by both fathers. Both
[2:23:44] of them blood relation. God was showing
[2:23:46] a
[2:23:48] type. He's brought us nigh by the blood.
[2:23:52] Blood relationship. The bride of Jesus
[2:23:55] Christ is sanctified through the bl
[2:23:57] blood of Christ, an open vessel for the
[2:23:59] Holy Spirit to speak to. No wonder
[2:24:01] you'll come to the waters of life. He
[2:24:03] that heareth, let him come to the waters
[2:24:05] of life freely. The bride said,
[2:24:08] "Come. He that is thirst, let him come.
[2:24:11] Blessed are you that hunger and thirst
[2:24:13] for righteousness, for you shall be
[2:24:15] filled."
[2:24:17] She made her decision.
[2:24:19] Yes, sir. Now watch as she comes out.
[2:24:23] She walks down and he had said these
[2:24:25] words, "Let whoever waters me and the
[2:24:27] camels, let her be the one you chose."
[2:24:30] And Rebecca went and watered the camels
[2:24:33] and gave him a drink. And then she
[2:24:36] watered the
[2:24:39] animals. The Oh, God. Do you know how
[2:24:43] hard that was? That wasn't just one
[2:24:46] trip. Come on.
[2:24:49] Do you know that a thirsty camel can
[2:24:51] drink about 30 gallons at one time?
[2:24:55] If we do our math, 30 gallons times 10
[2:24:58] camels is 300 gallons.
[2:25:01] Assuming Rebecca was a strong woman,
[2:25:03] maybe she could carry five gallons of
[2:25:05] water one time. 300 gallons at 5 gallons
[2:25:08] is 60 trips. Come on, Rebecca.
[2:25:13] And we get tired after one service.
[2:25:15] Yeah, preach. We get tired after about
[2:25:18] 15 minutes.
[2:25:20] [Applause]
[2:25:22] Oh, help us, Lord Jesus. I I'll preach
[2:25:24] so I preach somewhere.
[2:25:27] The same people that get tired after 30
[2:25:29] minutes of preaching, the same people
[2:25:30] that can watch a 2-hour movie, sit at a
[2:25:33] three-hour ball game, not think nothing
[2:25:35] about
[2:25:36] [Applause]
[2:25:38] it. Come on. It's time we bring our
[2:25:41] flesh subject to the word of God. Amen.
[2:25:44] And she didn't just give him one little
[2:25:46] sip of water. She watered his camels.
[2:25:51] And listen what brother Brandham said.
[2:25:52] He said an animal represents a beast.
[2:25:54] And a beast is a beast of burden, which
[2:25:57] means power in the Bible. He said the
[2:25:59] very animal she was watering was the
[2:26:02] very animal that was going to pack her
[2:26:04] back to see her
[2:26:09] bridegroom. He said, "What is watering?
[2:26:12] What is watering?" The very power that
[2:26:15] you're watering now with praises and
[2:26:18] thanksgiving and glory and power and
[2:26:21] might is the very Holy Spirit.
[2:26:26] The very Holy Spirit that's going to
[2:26:29] pack you back to your bridegroom.
[2:26:32] [Applause]
[2:26:37] Well, you say, "Well, brother Timothy,
[2:26:38] I'm going tell you it's nothing but
[2:26:39] emotion. Just is all this is but what if
[2:26:42] you want to believe that? You believe
[2:26:43] that all you want to I can't I'm not
[2:26:46] here to even change your mind.
[2:26:50] Well, I got a lot of quotes about
[2:26:52] emotion, brother Timothy. I got a lot of
[2:26:53] quotes about bubble dancing. Let me tell
[2:26:55] you, those quotes were about word
[2:26:56] rejectors.
[2:27:00] If you read them for who he's talking
[2:27:01] about, he was talking to the Pentecostal
[2:27:03] church that was taking a tongue or
[2:27:05] taking a sign, taking a wonder, but they
[2:27:07] didn't want the word. They didn't want
[2:27:09] the word that could change their life
[2:27:11] and make them dress right, make them act
[2:27:13] right, make them look right, make them
[2:27:15] live right. They didn't want none of
[2:27:16] that. They rejected the word. But we are
[2:27:19] not
[2:27:21] [Applause]
[2:27:24] rewarders. We are not bubble
[2:27:31] dancers. Now, I'm going to get real real
[2:27:33] right now and real frank. I I didn't
[2:27:35] know what a bubble dancer was a while
[2:27:36] ago. That's where I hit that, brother. I
[2:27:38] I I said, "Man, what is in the world is
[2:27:40] he talking about a bubble dancer?" I
[2:27:41] looked it up. You know what Wikipedia
[2:27:42] said? It was a dance that was made
[2:27:44] popular in the 1930s. It was a dance
[2:27:47] performed by a nude or nearly nude woman
[2:27:49] with a balloon in front of her to make
[2:27:51] provocative moves. We are not that
[2:27:53] woman.
[2:27:55] That woman is of Leota. We are not
[2:27:58] wretched. We are not poor. We are not
[2:28:00] blind. We are not naked and don't know
[2:28:02] it. We are the woman that's found
[2:28:04] dressed in the word of God. We are the
[2:28:06] woman that's found robed in the robe of
[2:28:08] his
[2:28:11] righteousness. We are not that woman
[2:28:13] dancing to rock and roll. We are the one
[2:28:16] that's marching in step. Oh, we're
[2:28:18] Christian soldiers.
[2:28:23] Hallelujah. And let me tell you, I don't
[2:28:25] care. And while I'm marching, if a few
[2:28:27] devils get in my way, every devil is
[2:28:30] under my feet.
[2:28:33] I'm not a word rejector. I'm a son and
[2:28:36] daughter of almighty God. I have been
[2:28:39] born by both by the blood of Jesus
[2:28:41] Christ. Amen. He saved me. He sanctified
[2:28:45] me. He justified me as though I never
[2:28:48] done it. He filled me with the Holy
[2:28:50] Ghost. If anybody got a right to praise
[2:28:52] him, I got a right to praise him. If
[2:28:55] anybody got a right, amen, to walk over
[2:28:57] devils, I got a right to walk over
[2:29:03] If anybody's got a right to walk over
[2:29:06] cancer. Amen. Our sister has a right to
[2:29:09] walk over
[2:29:12] cancer. I'm not a bubble dancer. I am a
[2:29:16] dancer
[2:29:17] [Applause]
[2:29:20] though. Hallelujah. We have received the
[2:29:23] word. We have been healed by the word.
[2:29:26] We have been changed by the word.
[2:29:31] [Applause]
[2:29:33] And therefore, when the word comes, let
[2:29:35] me tell you, when you see the word and
[2:29:37] you see it manifested in your day,
[2:29:40] oh yeah, it'll bring some emotion.
[2:29:45] John saw it. He saw a lamb that was
[2:29:47] worthy. It' been asked, "Is there any
[2:29:49] man worthy?" And all heaven was
[2:29:51] searching. All heaven was looking
[2:29:53] around. But all of a sudden, a voice
[2:29:55] spoke and said, "There's a lamb."
[2:29:58] Woo! There's a lamb who's worthy to open
[2:30:01] the book and loose the seals
[2:30:08] thereof. And when that book came
[2:30:12] open, there was a voice of many angels
[2:30:15] be to shout. And the number 10,000
[2:30:18] times, 10,000 and thousands of thousand
[2:30:21] saying with a quiet voice, whispering,
[2:30:25] "With a loud voice,
[2:30:29] with a loud voice,
[2:30:32] worthy. Woo! Hallelujah. Anybody want to
[2:30:36] say that this morning? He's worthy.
[2:30:41] Worthy is a lamb that was slain to
[2:30:44] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[2:30:48] strength and honor and glory and
[2:30:51] blessing. And every creature which is in
[2:30:53] heaven and on earth and under the earth
[2:30:56] and such are in the sea and all that
[2:30:58] there in him heard I whispering.
[2:31:03] No. All them Christians heard him. All
[2:31:05] them preachers heard him. He went praise
[2:31:08] God. Hallelujah.
[2:31:13] When I saw my name,
[2:31:18] [Applause]
[2:31:22] come on. When I saw my name written in
[2:31:26] the lamb's book of
[2:31:29] life, and if it's been wrote there,
[2:31:32] there ain't a devil's got a big enough
[2:31:34] eraser to take it out.
[2:31:38] Brother Tommy drugs couldn't take it
[2:31:39] out. Amen. Felonies couldn't take it
[2:31:41] out. Nothing could take it out. There
[2:31:43] was a seed on the inside.
[2:31:46] [Applause]
[2:31:49] Well, what makes a seed grow? Water.
[2:31:53] Water. What makes the word of God grow?
[2:31:55] Praises of God.
[2:31:58] Hello.
[2:32:01] He said, "Let it settle in your heart. I
[2:32:02] don't care if you're in a wheelchair,
[2:32:04] you're in a cot, you got heart trouble,
[2:32:06] you got cancer, you're in radio land,
[2:32:08] and hospitals, wherever you be. If you
[2:32:10] can receive God's word in your heart and
[2:32:13] you can start praising God and thanking
[2:32:15] God for giving you, Amen, his healing
[2:32:17] power, it'll grow a
[2:32:23] tree. It'll grow a tree of healing.
[2:32:26] It'll grow a tree of deliverance. It'll
[2:32:28] grow a tree of salvation.
[2:32:34] But you got to drink and you got to
[2:32:36] water it and you got to drink. Then you
[2:32:38] might be in a wheelchair and you drink
[2:32:40] enough you'll come out.
[2:32:48] Hallelujah. You just go ahead and stand
[2:32:49] up. I ain't done but we can stand
[2:32:53] cuz we about to water this word.
[2:32:58] Come on. That's why worship is
[2:33:00] important. But let me tell you, worship
[2:33:02] before the word comes out is not no more
[2:33:05] important than worship after the word
[2:33:06] comes.
[2:33:08] Come on now.
[2:33:10] That ain't the time when the words
[2:33:12] preacher says, "Amen." You start
[2:33:13] thinking about mashed potatoes and gravy
[2:33:15] and all that. No, you need to start
[2:33:16] thanking God. You may not have seen the
[2:33:19] mountain move, but you need to start
[2:33:20] going ahead and say, "Thank you, God. I
[2:33:23] want to thank you that you save me. I
[2:33:26] want to thank you that you heal me. I
[2:33:28] want to thank you that you are the same
[2:33:30] yesterday, today, and
[2:33:37] forever.
[2:33:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You know, in the
[2:33:43] last year, in the last year, some of
[2:33:44] y'all, most of y'all probably know my
[2:33:46] bird, my wife's become a bird watcher.
[2:33:48] But let me let me tell you, I hit this
[2:33:49] quote this morning. I see why she
[2:33:50] watches them. You know, birds are happy.
[2:33:52] That's right. You know they're happy.
[2:33:55] You never seen one of them with a great
[2:33:56] drawn down look like you have sometimes.
[2:34:03] Well, brother Brother Juwel will call it
[2:34:05] the wy wowy woos. You y'all probably
[2:34:07] heard that. Nobody like me. Nobody
[2:34:11] preacher. He ain't never even come seen
[2:34:12] me.
[2:34:17] Hey, when I was saying stand up, I was
[2:34:19] talking about you in the balcony, too.
[2:34:20] Come on. We in this together.
[2:34:24] [Laughter]
[2:34:27] [Applause]
[2:34:34] [Music]
[2:34:38] You said, "You never saw one of them
[2:34:39] great with a great drawn up. Look,
[2:34:41] little bird gets up real early in the
[2:34:42] morning, just start singing." Let me
[2:34:43] tell you, that's the truth. At our our
[2:34:45] place we're staying, about
[2:34:48] 5:00 like I'm trying to sleep.
[2:34:54] Amen. What happened? He wants to glorify
[2:34:56] me by his
[2:34:58] maker. That's
[2:35:02] all. He talks about a night and gale who
[2:35:05] would keep his head looking up upwards.
[2:35:08] He would watch and he would see the
[2:35:09] signs in the heaven. And when he saw the
[2:35:11] sign, he would begin to sing. He would
[2:35:13] begin to shout. He would begin to praise
[2:35:15] God. He said, "That's what I think about
[2:35:17] a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost meeting
[2:35:19] when I can hear a good old hearty."
[2:35:22] Amen. Hallelujah. Somebody jump up and
[2:35:26] down and scream a little bit. Amen. I
[2:35:28] know the sun is shining
[2:35:33] somewhere. Come on now. You not can see
[2:35:36] nothing but clouds, but I can tell you
[2:35:38] right now, the sun is up.
[2:35:42] Maybe you come in and the clouds been
[2:35:44] over you. If you'll start singing the
[2:35:46] praises of Almighty God, all of a sudden
[2:35:48] it would break out and you could see the
[2:35:50] rays of the presence of God shining all
[2:35:53] around you.
[2:35:57] Hallelujah.
[2:35:59] Rebecca hardly knowing what she was
[2:36:01] doing, she began to water those camels,
[2:36:04] those beasts of burdens, and she would
[2:36:06] bring water, bucket after bucket, praise
[2:36:09] after praise, worship after worship,
[2:36:12] glory after glory, power after power.
[2:36:15] What was she doing? She was watering the
[2:36:18] same beast that was going to take her
[2:36:19] from this place she's in now
[2:36:23] to a new home.
[2:36:25] Hallelujah. Well, I'm going to wait till
[2:36:27] I see that home before I shout, you
[2:36:28] ain't never going to see it.
[2:36:31] Cuz all you're going to see is your
[2:36:33] clouds and your unbelief and your
[2:36:35] dolmans and your creeds. But if you can
[2:36:37] break out of that thing for a moment,
[2:36:38] well, that ain't my mold. That ain't who
[2:36:41] I am. Why don't you just break out of
[2:36:43] it?
[2:36:44] [Applause]
[2:36:48] How does a get out of an egg? Starts
[2:36:53] pecking at the decreed time. In the
[2:36:55] decreed season, God's gave it a little
[2:36:58] thing there, a little ability that if a
[2:37:00] shell is hardened around him, he can
[2:37:03] start just pecking cuz he knows I wasn't
[2:37:06] born for this atmosphere.
[2:37:10] There's an atmosphere out there that's
[2:37:11] calling me.
[2:37:14] And he said, "The only way you're going
[2:37:15] to get something is you just start
[2:37:16] pecking."
[2:37:18] Well, the prophet of God said, "Don't go
[2:37:20] read about it. P chicken's pecking. Just
[2:37:21] start pecking. Just start pipping is
[2:37:24] what he actually says. Pipping. Pipping
[2:37:26] at that edge. Just keep pipping. Maybe
[2:37:28] you can pimp enough just to get an arm
[2:37:30] out. All right.
[2:37:33] Got a little hole there. And all of a
[2:37:35] sudden, you just keep on pimping. You
[2:37:36] can get another arm out. And you just
[2:37:38] keep on pimping. And all of a sudden,
[2:37:40] you can stand up and you can let those
[2:37:42] arms begin to wave back and forth. And
[2:37:44] you just keep on pimping till you can
[2:37:45] just step out of that old shell and that
[2:37:47] old jail house the devil's trying to
[2:37:49] have you in. He's trying to keep you
[2:37:51] down with depression and fear and
[2:37:53] anxiety. Just keep on
[2:37:57] pimping. Hallelujah. Can we do that this
[2:38:00] morning? Why don't you lift your hands
[2:38:02] to heaven right now and you go praising
[2:38:05] God?
[2:38:08] Amen. They say we got to have music to
[2:38:10] work us up. We don't have to have music.
[2:38:12] I'm already worked up. I've already seen
[2:38:15] my name in the Lamb's Book of Life. I've
[2:38:18] already seen it. It's already done. It's
[2:38:21] already finished. It's over.
[2:38:25] Just go ahead, start praising God. Just
[2:38:28] go ahead and thank him right now. Thank
[2:38:30] you for my son coming home. Thank you
[2:38:32] for my daughter coming back. Thank you,
[2:38:34] Lord, that you put my family together.
[2:38:36] Thank you, Lord, you healed my body.
[2:38:38] Thank you, Lord, you saved my soul.
[2:38:40] Thank you didn't leave me where you
[2:38:41] found me, but you picked me up.
[2:38:46] [Applause]
[2:38:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:38:55] Oh, let a hallelujah come out. Let an
[2:38:58] amen to God come out. Let all the
[2:39:01] creatures hear you saying, "I saw my
[2:39:04] name. I saw my
[2:39:08] name." Go ahead, just water the Holy
[2:39:11] Ghost. Just water them. The spirit is
[2:39:13] here. Go ahead and just lift your hands
[2:39:14] up here. Say, "Thank you, Lord. Thank
[2:39:17] you Jesus.
[2:39:20] Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord.
[2:39:25] Thank you Lord.
[2:39:28] Thank you Jesus.
[2:39:31] Hallelujah.
[2:39:32] Hallelujah.
[2:39:34] You're watering the very thing that's
[2:39:36] going to take you out of here.
[2:39:39] [Applause]
[2:39:41] Hallelujah. You're watering the very
[2:39:43] power that's going to change your body.
[2:39:46] [Applause]
[2:39:49] Thank you, Lord. You're worthy of all
[2:39:51] praise. You're worthy of all glory.
[2:39:53] You're worthy of all honor.
[2:39:57] You're my God.
[2:40:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:40:02] Hallelujah.
[2:40:04] We bless your holy name, Lord. We thank
[2:40:07] you, Lord. You called us out of darkness
[2:40:08] into this marvelous light. Oh God, you
[2:40:11] didn't leave us where you found us.
[2:40:14] broken humanity, broken hearts, broken
[2:40:17] feelings, broken spirits. But Lord, you
[2:40:20] came down and you picked up that clay
[2:40:22] and I thank God you didn't throw it
[2:40:23] away, but you just begin to mold it
[2:40:25] again and make it. I want to thank you
[2:40:27] right now for every healing that's
[2:40:29] taking place in this building. I want to
[2:40:31] thank you right now for every prodal
[2:40:33] that's coming home. I want to thank you
[2:40:35] for every backslider that's going to
[2:40:36] come back to God. I want to thank you
[2:40:38] right now that you are the same
[2:40:40] yesterday, today, and forever. I think
[2:40:43] you are the well of life that I can come
[2:40:45] to and I can get a drink.
[2:40:48] [Music]
[2:40:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:40:55] Blessed be the name of the Oh, we love
[2:40:57] you, Lord. We praise you. We praise you.

[2:41:10] are. Brother Phillip, come help me with
[2:41:12] that. This joy that I have, the world

[2:41:19] King of Kings. Amen. If you just feel
[2:41:21] him moving, don't stop. If you feel him
[2:41:24] coming, don't stop. Keep pipping. Keep
[2:41:26] hitting at that shell. You're coming out
[2:41:28] of it.
[2:41:31] Oh my. There's somebody coming out of
[2:41:33] depression this
[2:41:34] morning. There's somebody that's coming
[2:41:36] out of anxieties and fears this morning.

[2:41:41] sin and backsliding
[2:41:45] conditions. There's somebody that's
