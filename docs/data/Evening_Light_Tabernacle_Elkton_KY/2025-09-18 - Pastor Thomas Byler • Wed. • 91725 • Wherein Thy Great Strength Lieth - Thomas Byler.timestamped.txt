[52:44] always there.
[52:45] And you know the funny thing now I laugh
[52:48] because I used to try to fit in. And you
[52:52] know what some people told me one day?
[52:53] They said, "You know, you're just
[52:54] weird." I thought, "You know what? I am
[52:57] because I don't this is not me. I just
[53:01] couldn't fit in. I tried to drink and I
[53:04] thought, Lord have mercy, that stuff is
[53:05] nasty.
[53:07] How do they get pleasure out of that?"
[53:10] But I, you know, I thought all my life
[53:13] he's guided me. He protected me, brother
[53:15] Glenn, and he's kept his hand upon me,
[53:18] and I love him for it tonight. I love
[53:21] your voice.
[53:24] Well, you have led me through the fire.
[53:30] In darkest night,
[53:33] you are close like no other.
[53:38] I've known you as a father.
[53:42] I've known you as a friend
[53:46] and I have lived in the goodness. Oh yes
[53:51] of God. Oh yes.
[53:55] And all my life you have been faithful.
[54:02] [Music]
[54:08] Oh good
[54:11] every breath that I am able
[54:17] I will sing
[54:19] of the goodness
[54:22] of God.
[54:25] Amen. Praise the Lord tonight. It's good
[54:27] to be in the house of the Lord.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Good to see everybody out tonight. And
[54:31] Amen. It's always good to be able to
[54:33] come into the house of God. Feel good.
[54:35] Amen. and uh see the different ones that
[54:38] the Lord has touched and healed. We're
[54:39] very thankful for. Amen. I think that'll
[54:42] be all for the music. Thank you'all very
[54:43] much. Amen.
[54:46] Praise the Lord. Let's just bow our
[54:47] heads, go before the Lord in prayer and
[54:49] we'll just get into the word.
[54:53] Precious Lord and Savior, we come before
[54:55] you once again, Lord. And so grateful to
[54:58] be called your children. So grateful to
[55:00] be able to call you our father, Lord
[55:03] Jesus. And we know that you care about
[55:05] us, every part of us and everything
[55:07] about us, Lord. And we do thank you,
[55:09] Lord, for all that you have supplied for
[55:12] us and the health that you have
[55:14] restored, Lord Jesus, to the different
[55:15] ones. We thank you, Lord. And Father, we
[55:18] just pray that you would just be among
[55:19] us now tonight in a special way as we
[55:21] invite you to come. We know that you
[55:23] always come where you're invited. We ask
[55:25] God you'd help me just to step aside,
[55:27] Lord Jesus, so that you might say what
[55:29] you once said tonight. Do what you want
[55:31] done, Lord Jesus. We just ask God that
[55:33] your divine will would be accomplished
[55:36] tonight. Father, we commit this service
[55:38] and the thoughts, the meditation of our
[55:39] heart to you now in Jesus Christ's name.
[55:42] Amen. And amen. If you will turn your
[55:45] Bibles and we're just going to go back
[55:46] to the same scripture that we read
[55:48] Sunday. Amen. And go a little bit
[55:51] further. Amen. With that. Amen. Go a
[55:54] little bit further with the thought.
[55:57] Amen. As I was studying, the thought
[56:00] came to me. Brother Bam said all you
[56:02] could take one scripture or one verse.
[56:07] He said that you could just take that
[56:08] and preach forever on it because it's
[56:12] all tied together. I thought, well,
[56:15] Lord, what do you want me to speak on as
[56:16] I begin to go with the scripture that I
[56:18] had and just the Lord begin to open
[56:20] things up and so, you know, because it
[56:22] truly does all tie together, don't it?
[56:25] &gt;&gt; All right. 2 Corinthians if you will. 2
[56:27] Corinthians uh chapter 4.
[56:36] Amen. Appreciate the song service. Amen.
[56:38] Preach. I mean couple of one song
[56:41] especially that's going to be um
[56:44] certainly go along with what we want to
[56:47] speak on talking about faith. Amen. And
[56:52] certainly he uh has been very good to
[56:55] each and every one of us, hasn't he?
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. Chapter 4 of 2 Corinthians
[57:02] and verse
[57:04] 18. While we look not at the things
[57:06] which are seen, but at the things which
[57:09] are not seen, for the things which are
[57:11] seen are temporal, but the things which
[57:13] are not seen are eternal. Amen. So Paul
[57:17] telling us that we don't look at the
[57:19] things that are seen. Amen. So our
[57:22] focus, our main focus in our life is not
[57:26] at the things that we see. It's looking
[57:28] into the spirit realm. How many knows
[57:31] that it would have to be in a different
[57:33] dimension? In a different world,
[57:35] basically in the spirit realm it would
[57:37] have to be. Now turn your Bibles if you
[57:40] will, and we're going to go to the book
[57:42] of Judges. And we want to read one more
[57:43] scripture in the book of Judges.
[57:51] And we'll get our title from here.
[57:54] Judges 16.
[58:01] Judges 16
[58:03] and I've got here 4-6.
[58:08] I think most of us understand the story
[58:10] of Samson quite a bit. Isn't that right?
[58:13] So we won't read the whole story, but
[58:15] we'll just read down to where we want to
[58:18] get our title from. Chapter 4 of 16
[58:21] says, "And it came to pass afterwards
[58:23] that he loved a woman in the valley of
[58:25] Sorak, whose name was Delilah. And the
[58:29] lords of the Philistines came up unto
[58:31] her, and said unto her, entice him, and
[58:33] see where in his great strength lith,
[58:36] and by what means we may prevail against
[58:39] him, that we may bind him to afflict
[58:41] him, and we will give thee, every one of
[58:44] us, 1100 pieces of silver. And Delilah
[58:48] said unto Samson, tell me, I pray thee,
[58:51] wherein thy great strength lith, and
[58:55] wherewith thou mightest be bound to
[58:58] afflict thee. Amen. May God add his
[59:00] blessings to the reading of the words.
[59:02] You can be seated. Amen. How many knows
[59:04] the rest of the story?
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. We find out that finally,
[59:10] Amen. Finally, he gave up his secret.
[59:13] And when he gave up his secret, he lost
[59:16] his power. Amen. Brother Brandham used
[59:19] his message quite a few different times.
[59:21] Amen. And I was listening to the U
[59:24] message called a deceived church by the
[59:27] world. Amen. And he he talked and used
[59:30] this scripture here and he was it was a
[59:32] very very powerful message and I'll have
[59:35] a few quotes out of that tonight. Amen.
[59:37] And he brought it right to his own
[59:39] tabernacle. Amen. the Brandham
[59:42] tabernacle. Amen. And how that
[59:44] worldliness had gotten into them and how
[59:46] that they were losing their secret, so
[59:48] to speak. Amen. And my title tonight is
[59:51] wherein thy great strength lith. Wherein
[59:56] thy great strength lies. Basically,
[59:59] where does your great strength lay?
[1:00:04] Where do we get our power from? Amen.
[1:00:07] Where do we get our power from? And how
[1:00:09] do we keep that power? How can we go
[1:00:11] away tonight? How how many would like to
[1:00:14] be able to leave church tonight having a
[1:00:17] little bit more of an understanding how
[1:00:19] that you can have more of the power of
[1:00:21] God?
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's the one objective
[1:00:26] that the devil has is to take what power
[1:00:29] that you do have. That's his that's his
[1:00:32] objective. Satan is like a roaring lion
[1:00:35] seeking uh roaming about seeking whom he
[1:00:38] may devour. Isn't it quite plain how
[1:00:42] that uh he they put it just plainly? He
[1:00:45] says, you know, how we may bind him and
[1:00:48] afflict him. Is that right? And we will
[1:00:51] give thee everyone so much money. Amen.
[1:00:53] And Delilah straight up asked and tell
[1:00:56] me, Amen. Where does your strength lie
[1:00:58] wherein we might afflict thee?
[1:01:03] I think it's time to quit dating the
[1:01:05] girls. Brother Tommy, I think it's time
[1:01:07] to quit dating this chick, so to speak.
[1:01:12] Ain't that right? I mean, she's trying
[1:01:14] to find out how in the world she can
[1:01:16] afflict you and make your life
[1:01:18] miserable.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; But no, not him. No, no, no.
[1:01:25] I'm going punch that Samson on the
[1:01:27] shoulder when we get over there. D man,
[1:01:29] what was wrong with you?
[1:01:32] Is that about what we would think? What
[1:01:34] was wrong with you, man? It was pretty
[1:01:36] obvious.
[1:01:38] It was quite obvious, but I guess he was
[1:01:41] love struck. Fell in love with this
[1:01:44] woman. It says that he loved her, right?
[1:01:46] Amen. What love won't do, I guess. Here
[1:01:49] we go. Just speak as we go. Love is
[1:01:52] blind. And he was pretty blind to what
[1:01:55] was going on. And finally when she
[1:01:58] really coaxed him, really coaxed him to
[1:02:00] hey, you know, if you really love me,
[1:02:02] you'll tell me and he pied her or
[1:02:04] whatever and told her and as a result
[1:02:08] Samson to me was an example of a
[1:02:10] backslider. Ain't that right? Who uh
[1:02:12] come back again. Amen. He come back
[1:02:15] again and in the end, Amen. ended up
[1:02:17] destroy I I put in here that he came
[1:02:20] back with a vengeance.
[1:02:22] Is that right? That's the way anybody
[1:02:24] ought to do when you backslide. When you
[1:02:26] get away from God, hello. And somehow
[1:02:29] Satan trips you up. You ought to come
[1:02:31] back with a vengeance. Say devil. Amen.
[1:02:34] I'm going to get you the best of you and
[1:02:35] I'm going to stomp you and I'm going to
[1:02:37] take my foot and I'm going to crush your
[1:02:38] head in the ground. Is that right? Kill
[1:02:42] with a vengeance. And so that's what
[1:02:44] Samson did, of course, in the end. Amen.
[1:02:47] But we want to look at the supernatural,
[1:02:49] the supernatural. Amen. The other
[1:02:51] dimension and see where we really get
[1:02:53] our strength from. Amen. And how that uh
[1:02:56] uh we know that God's the things where
[1:02:59] we get our strength from in the
[1:03:00] spiritual realm of course you know
[1:03:02] there's a Satan has also also his
[1:03:05] dimension is in the spiritual realm. How
[1:03:08] many believes that everything about the
[1:03:10] devil and everything about fighting the
[1:03:12] devil is in the other dimension. It's in
[1:03:16] the spirit realm.
[1:03:18] Amen.
[1:03:26] Because it says in 2 Corinthians 10 and
[1:03:30] uh let me see here. 2 Corinthians 10 and
[1:03:32] verse three says, "For though we walk in
[1:03:34] the flesh, we do not war after the
[1:03:38] flesh. For the weapons of our warfare
[1:03:40] are not carnal, but mighty through God
[1:03:42] to the pulling down of strongholds."
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; How many believe that every everybody
[1:03:48] every one of us has strongholds?
[1:03:51] Amen. in our lives.
[1:03:54] What are those strongholds? This just
[1:03:56] comes to me. I didn't write this down,
[1:03:58] but one of one of those strongholds is
[1:04:02] is just two two different powers,
[1:04:04] brother Brandham said, that there was in
[1:04:06] the world. God's power and Satan's
[1:04:08] power. And every person is powered or
[1:04:11] controlled or has strength from one of
[1:04:13] those powers.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And ultimately, the stronghold,
[1:04:17] the real battle comes in your soul. It's
[1:04:21] not in see, taste, feel, hear and smell.
[1:04:24] Not conscience, region, memory,
[1:04:26] imaginations and all that. That's not
[1:04:28] where the real the battle is. The real
[1:04:31] battle is where? In the soul.
[1:04:35] And that right. And that soul in that
[1:04:37] soul realm there's only two choices only
[1:04:41] two things that operates that. And that
[1:04:44] automat uh automatically uh ultimately
[1:04:48] automatically ultimately is the drive
[1:04:50] shaft of every person. All right. One of
[1:04:53] them is faith and one of them is doubt.
[1:04:56] You're either controlled by one or
[1:04:58] you're controlled by the other.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're pushed. You're powered by.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:10] And you think about it. How many know
[1:05:12] that in this spiritual realm, I want to
[1:05:15] talk about Satan's side for a minute.
[1:05:17] Would that be all right?
[1:05:19] You know, because we know that uh things
[1:05:22] like hatred
[1:05:25] is in the spirit realm. It's in the
[1:05:27] spirit realm. It's actually a demon.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; How many believes he's actually a demon?
[1:05:34] Bitterness is a demon.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Hatred,
[1:05:38] jealousy, a demon.
[1:05:41] all these things and it and it brings
[1:05:43] about misery.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe demons afflict
[1:05:49] you? Demons of affliction.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. How many knows that
[1:05:56] hatred
[1:05:58] is miserable?
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; It's miserable to have hatred.
[1:06:04] It's miserable to have bitterness.
[1:06:08] Amen. And we know that that's all demons
[1:06:11] that were cast out of heaven.
[1:06:14] How many believe that the devil is not
[1:06:17] comfortable? The devil is miserable.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you want to know how the devil
[1:06:24] feels, just think of how you felt when
[1:06:27] you was unsaved. You was miserable.
[1:06:30] Isn't it something how that God talked
[1:06:32] about the Leodysia age and called them
[1:06:35] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:06:38] blind and naked? They were in a
[1:06:40] miserable condition.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were governed by the
[1:06:45] Satan. They had a spirit of misery and
[1:06:49] also lukewarmness.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Lukewarmness or me being mediocre about
[1:06:57] things. That's also a place of misery.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; God wants you to be hot or he wants you
[1:07:04] to be cold.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You just, oh, I'm just humrum.
[1:07:10] You're miserable is what you are.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Yeah. You're either
[1:07:15] hot or you're cold.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; You either got the power of God in your
[1:07:19] heart or you don't. You either got the
[1:07:21] light in there or you don't.
[1:07:25] And if you got the power of God in your
[1:07:28] life, the devil don't like happy people.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; The devil don't like anybody that's got
[1:07:34] the real power of God in their life.
[1:07:36] They He wants to find your power. I
[1:07:38] believe it's the prophet of God said,
[1:07:40] you know, the devil has studied
[1:07:41] humanity. He studies you just to find
[1:07:43] out where your weakness is, how he can
[1:07:46] get to you. He is very exuberant about
[1:07:49] trying to make you miserable with him.
[1:07:52] Because misery loves company.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Why do you think those miserable people
[1:07:59] that don't a man have to go to the bars
[1:08:01] and drink and man they go up there and
[1:08:03] they have a Budweiser and they tell
[1:08:05] their buddy about all their hardships
[1:08:06] and the oh my all that you know there
[1:08:09] and they have they become buddies. Why?
[1:08:11] Because they're partners of misery.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Birds of a feather flock together.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know about you, but you
[1:08:22] know it it's we we just don't like to
[1:08:24] hear a whole lot of negativity, do we?
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; No. A really believer doesn't want to
[1:08:28] hear a whole lot of negativity. Why? Cuz
[1:08:31] we try to say good things and be
[1:08:33] positive even if we are a little
[1:08:35] miserable.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Stay positive about the whole thing. But
[1:08:38] all of those things like bitterness,
[1:08:41] those are in the spiritual realm,
[1:08:43] hatred, spiritual realm and murder in
[1:08:46] the spiritual realm. and Satan and I
[1:08:50] just read in the news and I don't know
[1:08:52] you know when you say you read in the
[1:08:53] news or heard in the news you always put
[1:08:55] your ear up but they said that the
[1:08:56] parents of this what's his name Tyler
[1:08:59] the guy that killed Charles Charlie K
[1:09:04] that he had just turned in that
[1:09:07] direction and within the last year amen
[1:09:10] that he had actually turned I thought
[1:09:12] man within a year that guy could keep
[1:09:14] pick up that kind of a spirit of hatred
[1:09:17] because how many knows he hated him
[1:09:19] conservatives. He hated Charlie. He
[1:09:21] hated what he said and he got political
[1:09:23] and got caught up all up in that.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And before you knew
[1:09:28] it, he had that evil spirit. And how
[1:09:31] many knows that murder is a spirit?
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. You've got to have some
[1:09:36] kind of a mean devil on you to actually
[1:09:39] kill somebody. You've got to absolutely
[1:09:41] have a devil on you to pull that
[1:09:43] trigger.
[1:09:48] And in just in that short span of time,
[1:09:50] the devil so captivated him.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:09:57] Until he actually killed somebody. Now
[1:09:59] where he's at.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's Satan. That's the power of
[1:10:03] Satan.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; How much better he had have been if he'
[1:10:07] just stay out of it.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:12] That's right. So there's no there's no
[1:10:14] comfort in that. Amen. No comfort in the
[1:10:19] left. No comfort in Amen. in being in
[1:10:22] that type of a situation where you have
[1:10:24] hatred and bitterness in your heart.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Unforgiveness.
[1:10:30] So what do we got to do? We got to be
[1:10:31] sober. We got to be vigilant because our
[1:10:34] adversary, the devil, goeth about
[1:10:36] seeking whom he may devour. He's not
[1:10:39] happy.
[1:10:41] He's not happy with a church that's on
[1:10:43] fire.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; He's not happy with y'all clapping your
[1:10:46] hands and being on fire for God. He's
[1:10:48] not. No, he's going to work on you out
[1:10:50] there.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. He's going to work. He's
[1:10:54] going to try. He wants to find out where
[1:10:58] your strength lies
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; and he wants to take th that strength
[1:11:04] from you. As a prophet of God, I think
[1:11:06] preach a message on where has thy
[1:11:08] strength gone, Samson? Where's it gone?
[1:11:11] Where is he at? Why? He was robbed of
[1:11:13] the devil. Amen.
[1:11:16] My my my
[1:11:18] praise the Lord.
[1:11:22] No. And so we want to look at the just a
[1:11:26] few things
[1:11:28] some of the things that where our
[1:11:29] strength lays and we have to guard that.
[1:11:34] We want to see it some of the things
[1:11:36] some of the ways that the devil amen can
[1:11:38] take our strength from us.
[1:11:43] Amen. The first thing is of course found
[1:11:46] I believe in Galatians. I don't know if
[1:11:49] I even put this down here.
[1:11:56] It's not Epha not Galatians. It's
[1:11:58] Ephesians 2. Amen.
[1:12:01] Ephesians 2:8 says, "For by grace are
[1:12:05] you saved through faith."
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; First, I want wanted to put in here that
[1:12:11] the one of our main weapons,
[1:12:14] our strength
[1:12:17] lays in faith in God.
[1:12:20] That's right.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham said, "Any man that's
[1:12:24] ever made a show at all in life has been
[1:12:28] men who has trusted God and took him at
[1:12:32] his word."
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Man that doesn't take him at his word
[1:12:35] never mounts to a hill of beans.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. We've had George
[1:12:42] Washington's Abraham Lincoln. What more?
[1:12:44] We've had Amen. Just ask uh Stonewall
[1:12:48] Jackson, why does it make why can you
[1:12:51] still stand there and have bullets and
[1:12:53] arrows whizzing by you? Isn't that
[1:12:55] right? He said, "I never take a drink of
[1:12:58] water, but I thank my master for it."
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; He had a relationship with God. He did
[1:13:03] not fear death. He must have known the
[1:13:05] master
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; and he had faith in God. So that's why
[1:13:10] Stonewall Jackson resounds even today.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Why? because of his bravery.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Because he was a man that believed in
[1:13:19] God. George Washington crossing to
[1:13:22] Delaware, praying all night before
[1:13:24] going.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Praying, talking to
[1:13:28] God.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; So any of you young people want to
[1:13:34] amount to a hill of beans, if you want
[1:13:36] to believe amount to anything, don't
[1:13:38] believe in this blue hair and this
[1:13:40] orange hair
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; in these modern ways. It ain't going to
[1:13:44] get you nowhere.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; No, it brings you in depression and
[1:13:48] everything else. Believe in God.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. I got to step back just one
[1:13:55] step back before that and and that is
[1:13:58] it's the grace of God.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's our power is the grace of
[1:14:04] God
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; because we're saved by what? Grace.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But through the instrumentality of
[1:14:11] faith. And I like the next verse because
[1:14:14] it says here, amen. He says, "Save
[1:14:17] through faith and that not of yourself.
[1:14:20] It is a gift of God."
[1:14:23] [Applause]
[1:14:25] How many's glad that God give you that
[1:14:28] gift? Because it's not something you do
[1:14:30] yourself, but it's God's faith in you.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; That's what gives you power. That's
[1:14:37] where your power lays.
[1:14:40] Yes.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; First John 4:54 says, "And whatsoever is
[1:14:44] born of God overcometh the world." And
[1:14:47] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:14:49] world, even our faith.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Did Brother Bam say faith,
[1:14:54] man, it beats down. It don't apologize
[1:14:58] to the devil. It's unapologetic. It
[1:15:00] beats the devil down. It conquers. It
[1:15:03] throws in prison.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; It takes control of the situation.
[1:15:08] That's what faith is.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. How many's glad for
[1:15:17] faith?
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; We're living by faith.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; We're living by faith, folks.
[1:15:24] Amen. We need plenty of it.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Ask David. David, where
[1:15:31] does your strength lie? Is it in your
[1:15:34] size? Is it in your biceps? Is it in
[1:15:36] your skill to
[1:15:38] throw a stone. No. When he come up there
[1:15:41] and that giant challenged him, I don't
[1:15:44] come to you in the she with a shield and
[1:15:46] a sword. I come to you in the name of
[1:15:49] Jesus Christ. Isn't that right? This the
[1:15:51] master. Amen. The Lord of hosts. That's
[1:15:55] who I come. And that's who he knew. That
[1:15:57] was his secret. And that Goliath come on
[1:16:00] down.
[1:16:07] Hebrews 11:1 says, "Now faith is the
[1:16:10] substance of things hoped for, the
[1:16:11] evidence of things not seen." So how
[1:16:15] many know that brother may went into
[1:16:17] great detail about this, but he says
[1:16:18] faith is actually a substance.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; I am glad that it's just not my thought
[1:16:26] in my brain.
[1:16:29] Faith is not just your thought in your
[1:16:31] brains, but it's a revelation that God
[1:16:33] has placed in there that the gates of
[1:16:36] hell themselves cannot prevail against.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Woo! What a powerful weapon.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. I like that. the
[1:16:50] substance. I was thinking, you know,
[1:16:53] there Israel was cowered down and they
[1:16:56] were hoping somehow that they could
[1:16:58] overcome that giant.
[1:17:00] Man, we're in our foxholes. Why? We hope
[1:17:03] to overcome this thing. We hope to
[1:17:04] overcome this thing. They were in uh
[1:17:08] Egypt. Boy, I sure hope one of these
[1:17:10] days God delivers us.
[1:17:13] I sure hope. I sure hope. But guess
[1:17:15] what? When faith come along, it was the
[1:17:18] substance of things hoped for. And I'm
[1:17:21] here to tell you, if you have a need
[1:17:22] tonight, whatever it is, you might be
[1:17:25] hoping for, but let faith come and it'll
[1:17:28] be the substance of the things that
[1:17:29] you've hoped for to bring it to a
[1:17:32] reality.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. When David went out there with
[1:17:35] that sling and that stone, I don't care
[1:17:38] how many doubters there was, he was
[1:17:39] going out there by faith. He had the
[1:17:42] substance of faith and he brought that
[1:17:44] giant down. What they had hoped for was
[1:17:47] manifested in faith in in uh David.
[1:17:53] Amen. Faith is the substance of things
[1:17:58] hoped for.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; In other words, Amen. For if you're
[1:18:02] hoping for something, you need more than
[1:18:04] hope.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith will make that hope happen.
[1:18:10] Praise the Lord. How many's glad for
[1:18:12] that?
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to ask Shamgar, what's
[1:18:16] the secret, Shamgar?
[1:18:18] How many knows what's what was Shamgar's
[1:18:22] secret?
[1:18:24] Faith. And also something else, a little
[1:18:27] bit of righteous indignation.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? His indignation rose
[1:18:35] up and he said, "I am a son of God. I'm
[1:18:38] a child. I'm an Israelite. I'm a
[1:18:40] circumcised. These uncircumcised
[1:18:42] Philistines, they're coming and taking
[1:18:44] me and robbing me all the time. I'm here
[1:18:47] to tell you sometimes you sometimes the
[1:18:49] devil God will allow you just to get so
[1:18:52] miserable until you're chicken tired of
[1:18:54] being miserable and you get up on your
[1:18:56] feet and have some faith in God and go
[1:18:58] and conquer that thing.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; But we're too lukewarm. Well, I guess
[1:19:03] that's just how it's going to be.
[1:19:05] I've heard brother Bam say you might
[1:19:07] come up in the line say well I'll go see
[1:19:09] if I get healed.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; He says no way. You're not getting it
[1:19:13] that way.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; You got to have a little more about you
[1:19:16] than that. A little more perseverance.
[1:19:18] You got to have a little more faith.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. More like I'm going up there and
[1:19:21] I'm not coming back until I got it.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:32] My my my Praise the Lord.
[1:19:36] Listen to that. It says, "By faith, the
[1:19:38] elders obtained a good report."
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; That's where you could see Brother Bram
[1:19:44] saying, "Nobody's ever really amounted
[1:19:45] to anything unless they've had been
[1:19:48] people who believed in God."
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did great things. Believed in God.
[1:19:56] Ask Moses, "Moses, where does your
[1:19:59] strength lie? Are you a eloquent
[1:20:02] speaker?
[1:20:04] Huh?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Sure. He was Can you imagine? Moses was
[1:20:08] an educated man. He taught the Egyptians
[1:20:11] and stuff. Isn't that right? He was
[1:20:13] smart, but he did have a speech
[1:20:15] impediment, I guess. And he tell God,
[1:20:18] "Can't you get somebody else? I can't
[1:20:20] talk." Right.
[1:20:22] I don't know if he stuttered or what,
[1:20:24] but he wasn't in that. No, it was on his
[1:20:28] in his experience at the burning bush.
[1:20:30] He had a revelation. He had faith. By
[1:20:33] faith, Moses, Amen, went down there and
[1:20:35] said, "God said, let my people go."
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? He got it out. He said
[1:20:45] it. And he had he better done it, too.
[1:20:50] Or he was in a lot of trouble. Was it in
[1:20:52] Moses? Was Moses going on his own? No.
[1:20:55] He'd have went the other way. He'd have
[1:20:57] ran from it.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; He didn't even want to do it.
[1:21:02] But when faith struck, it was a
[1:21:04] different story. That's where his
[1:21:06] strength laid was in faith.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:16] Substance.
[1:21:17] Praise the Lord. Can you imagine? Faith
[1:21:19] is the substance of things hoped for,
[1:21:21] the evidence of not things, things not
[1:21:22] seen. Moses come down there with faith
[1:21:25] and they may have hoped for 400 years to
[1:21:28] be released but by faith. Amen.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; God used no uh Moses and he pulled them
[1:21:36] all out of there.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; How many is glad for faith?
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Very glad for faith. Thank you,
[1:21:43] Jesus.
[1:21:46] Amen.
[1:21:49] But the devil doesn't like that. The
[1:21:51] devil doesn't like for us to stay on
[1:21:53] fire. He likes for us to try to uh he
[1:21:57] tries to try to get us strip us of our
[1:22:00] power, strip us of our glory, strip us
[1:22:04] of everything that God gives us.
[1:22:07] Amen.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:11] Amen.
[1:22:15] We know that Donna has sang the song
[1:22:17] before. Faith is the key.
[1:22:21] to to the door. Amen. Faith is the key
[1:22:26] that opens the door. Faith is the key to
[1:22:30] the blessings of the Lord. Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; It unlocks. And who is the door?
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; How many believes Jesus is the door?
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; When you come into the door of Jesus,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come into Christ because there are
[1:22:48] no other door. that gives you access. By
[1:22:52] faith, we have access. Amen.
[1:22:56] And then
[1:22:58] the Holy Spirit comes,
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; makes his abode in you.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; And then everything you have need of
[1:23:06] is in you. Then
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; let me ask you, how does it feel?
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Got one. Great.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; How's it feel? Amen.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; To know that you got everything that you
[1:23:23] ever have need of in your heart.
[1:23:28] [Applause]
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just for this journey, brother
[1:23:32] Brad, but for the world that is to come.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; You've got what you'll need at death's
[1:23:38] door if you was to go there and sickness
[1:23:40] door. Amen. It don't matter. He's
[1:23:42] supplied everything.
[1:23:45] Amen. And we like to let the devil know
[1:23:47] that he's not stripping us of our power
[1:23:50] like he did Samson.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; You're not going to take that from me.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; No. But the church world, Pentecostal
[1:24:02] world, they were losing their power.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; How many knows that?
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, he really railed on him. This is
[1:24:10] what he said. He says, "Where is our
[1:24:12] power? Where's our glory? What is it?"
[1:24:14] It's because we've went after the wisdom
[1:24:17] man instead of the power of God. Our
[1:24:20] preachers and things are so stiff and
[1:24:22] starchy till they've organized us. We're
[1:24:25] so starchy and stiff necked till people
[1:24:27] you never hear shout in the church
[1:24:29] anymore. You never hear anybody cry
[1:24:32] anymore. Where is your power gone? Where
[1:24:35] is the cry for God gone?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Where is it at?
[1:24:41] Woo. Where's that power gone? Once he
[1:24:43] was stripped of it. My
[1:24:48] praise the Lord.
[1:24:50] Never hear anybody cry.
[1:24:53] He said the mourner's bench is put in
[1:24:55] the basement. There's no more glory in
[1:24:58] the church.
[1:25:01] Amen. Satan has stripped the church of
[1:25:04] enthusiasm.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he says, "We're stiff as can
[1:25:10] be. We're not free. He said, "We're
[1:25:12] bound." The devil with his modernistic
[1:25:15] demons has bound the church of the
[1:25:17] living God. There's no power in the
[1:25:19] church. There's no freedom. The people
[1:25:21] are so starchy and stiff. Why? God can
[1:25:24] come down in the midst of Pentecostal
[1:25:26] people and show that he's God and prove
[1:25:28] his signs and his resurrection, it don't
[1:25:30] even shake them. Glory. Why?
[1:25:34] It's a disgrace. I walk across the
[1:25:37] country, God working, performing signs,
[1:25:40] and people sitting, well, I guess that's
[1:25:42] all right. I know it can be done. It
[1:25:45] doesn't move them. Why? They're bound by
[1:25:47] Delilah or the world. Hello. How many
[1:25:50] know better says, man, it used to be
[1:25:52] that the word of God fed people.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:01] Another one. Samson the Philistines is
[1:26:03] on thee. random tabernacle worldlyism is
[1:26:07] creeping in among you. What about it?
[1:26:09] Have you exposed your secret?
[1:26:13] Have you exposed that secret that God
[1:26:15] gave you when you were wallering in the
[1:26:17] sawdust a few years ago? Let me say
[1:26:19] this. Have you lost that dedication,
[1:26:23] that commitment to God, that zeal for
[1:26:26] God? Hello. Don't let the devil steal
[1:26:29] that from you.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That How many believe that prayer
[1:26:33] life? I mean, there's power in prayer.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. And not and not just when
[1:26:39] you're uh h praying in the church and
[1:26:42] everybody hears you and so forth. No,
[1:26:45] but when you're at home, when you go to
[1:26:47] your closet, your wife don't even hear
[1:26:49] you, your children don't even hear you,
[1:26:51] you have a fellowship with Almighty God.
[1:26:54] That's where your strength lays.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; The devil wants to make you so busy
[1:26:58] until you ain't got time to pray.
[1:27:04] ain't got time to meditate. God, the
[1:27:08] devil has robbed us. We've given him the
[1:27:10] secret of our time.
[1:27:13] We haven't got no time anymore to
[1:27:15] meditate. We've given him too much of
[1:27:16] our mind.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; What is it brother said? If you want to
[1:27:26] get closer to God, here's told you
[1:27:28] earlier. You want to go with more power
[1:27:29] closer to God. It's the same story
[1:27:31] again. I'm telling you again.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed is the man that walketh
[1:27:37] not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
[1:27:39] standeth in the way of the sinner. Ain't
[1:27:41] that right? Nor siteth in the seat of
[1:27:44] the scornful, but his delight is in the
[1:27:46] law of the Lord. And oh, and he has law.
[1:27:50] Does he meditate once in a while? No.
[1:27:53] But we're so busy thinking about our
[1:27:55] worldly stuff. That's what the problem
[1:27:57] is,
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; man. I was thinking the other day,
[1:28:02] Brother Bad, I would hate to be an Amish
[1:28:04] person. I'd hate to be a denominational
[1:28:06] preacher.
[1:28:08] Cuz those Amish people, they can't get
[1:28:09] no fresh revelation.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; They don't know what a fresh revelation
[1:28:14] is. Those preachers don't know what a
[1:28:15] fresh revelation is. It's always the
[1:28:18] same old story. Same old story. Same old
[1:28:21] story.
[1:28:23] Hello. I like to have some fresh stuff.
[1:28:25] I say, "God, help me. Help me. Give me
[1:28:28] some fresh stuff so I can give the
[1:28:30] people some fresh stuff." Amen. This
[1:28:32] fountain is a overflowing, a river of
[1:28:35] life bubbling up. It's inexhaustible.
[1:28:38] There's no end. Amen. We're going to
[1:28:40] have fresh stuff all the way till we get
[1:28:42] out of here, folks.
[1:28:46] You don't hear no more screaming
[1:28:47] anymore.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Time to let go, folks.
[1:28:54] He says, "They're bound. They're stiff."
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:29:02] Amen. That's right. Have you let it
[1:29:05] creep out with social formal worship?
[1:29:08] How many know that sometimes you just
[1:29:10] come to church, it's just a Wednesday
[1:29:13] tonight? You know, it's just going to be
[1:29:15] a Wednesday night.
[1:29:18] No,
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; no, that's just formal. I come here to
[1:29:23] worship God. I come here to praise God.
[1:29:26] I come here to preach the unadulterated
[1:29:28] truth. I didn't just come here for
[1:29:30] another servant. I come here to give God
[1:29:32] glory to his name.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you
[1:29:43] I don't remember. I don't remember
[1:29:49] even in Dixon, brother. We had some good
[1:29:52] service. We had a few outbreaks,
[1:29:55] but I believe that we're getting into a
[1:29:57] different
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; time zone.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; I believe we are.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:06] I believe
[1:30:10] that you don't got to go to Virginia.
[1:30:13] You don't got to go to Louisiana
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; or Vancouver
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; or anywhere else to have good services.
[1:30:21] No.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Nope. You ain't got to wait till some
[1:30:24] maybe maybe sometime. No. We can have it
[1:30:27] if we'll just not let the devil rob us
[1:30:30] of our power.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Not let the devil rob us of our thought
[1:30:34] pattern. Amen. Occupy our mind with the
[1:30:37] things of the world.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Starting meditating him on Wednesday.
[1:30:41] Amen. Day and night. He'll pour out
[1:30:43] revelation.
[1:30:45] We'll have a greater service. The things
[1:30:47] of the world won't mean nothing to you
[1:30:49] anymore. church will mean more to you.
[1:30:51] The word of God will mean more to you.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; That's the problem.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Rob does of our time, our secret prayer
[1:31:01] life.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. A meditation.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Remember Joshua, the same one. Write it
[1:31:07] upon the post of your door. Think about
[1:31:09] it day and night.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Day and night. Keep the Lord.
[1:31:12] Paul, David said, "Oh, David, the album
[1:31:15] asked David, David, where does your
[1:31:16] strength lie?" I'll tell you where my
[1:31:18] strength lies. Amen. Every time I didn't
[1:31:20] have to look for a bear or a or a lion
[1:31:22] in my sheep herd, I was meditating on
[1:31:24] God.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He had a meditation. He
[1:31:29] knew what meditation did.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Concentration. Meditation. That's where
[1:31:36] your power lies.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Your prayer.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Read your Bible more. Think about him
[1:31:41] more. Meditate on him more. You want
[1:31:43] more of God if you don't do those
[1:31:45] things.
[1:31:48] You want somebody to come and wave a
[1:31:51] magic wand over you? More of the power
[1:31:54] of God to you.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Not how it works.
[1:32:01] No, it works when you get to your
[1:32:03] closet. Amen. And you go to talking
[1:32:05] about the Lord a little more. Say,
[1:32:07] "Reveal yourself to me more. I need
[1:32:10] revelation more than anything else." It
[1:32:12] gives me power.
[1:32:15] It brings me joy.
[1:32:19] God, help us to tap into that unseen
[1:32:21] force, into that unseen world, and let's
[1:32:24] see some of that stuff come over here.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Give me some of that peace of joy. Amen.
[1:32:29] That makes you run around to church
[1:32:31] screaming and hollering say, "Man, I
[1:32:33] just feel good."
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; What's that stuff that you're taking?
[1:32:37] I'm taking a little bit of that Holy
[1:32:39] Ghost stuff.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; And it feels good.
[1:32:49] Hallelujah.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; I can see brother Bham running around
[1:32:55] here right now. Can you?
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; I believe he'd reprove.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; He didn't like that old stiff starchy
[1:33:01] stuff too much. Them icicles hanging
[1:33:03] from the chandeliers going into a church
[1:33:06] he said and it's 10 below zero.
[1:33:12] Some woman go
[1:33:15] everybody
[1:33:17] shimmer spine. No, just join in.
[1:33:21] Yeah, just join in.
[1:33:24] This is the hour that we worship God
[1:33:27] more than we ever had. We're getting
[1:33:29] ready. I believe this was saying a while
[1:33:31] ago. I believe that we're getting ready
[1:33:33] for the other side.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, can I just say what comes mind? I
[1:33:38] can't help but think that that dimension
[1:33:39] is getting closer to us and we're going
[1:33:41] to get closer to that dimension and one
[1:33:44] of these days we're going to take a body
[1:33:46] change in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:33:49] an eye.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; We'll speed up and they'll slow down
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; and we'll meet each other.
[1:34:13] Amen. Well, I wasn't expect that
[1:34:14] tonight, brother. I wouldn't either.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; But let go.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Let go and let God have his way.
[1:34:30] used to when the preaching of the word
[1:34:34] went forth. The old saints with tears in
[1:34:36] their eyes would raise to their feet and
[1:34:39] walk around, walk sobbing, maybe not
[1:34:43] saying a word, just walking around two
[1:34:46] or three times and sit down so filled
[1:34:48] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; The word fedom.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Are you being fed tonight?
[1:34:56] It's the word fatim.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone, but
[1:35:00] by every word
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; that proves teed is out of the mouth of
[1:35:03] God.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Philistines are on thee. Brandom
[1:35:06] tabernacle.
[1:35:07] Philistines are on you Pentecostals.
[1:35:10] Of course, the Philistines got the rest
[1:35:12] of you.
[1:35:14] Ain't that right? That's right.
[1:35:17] Philistines got the rest of them
[1:35:18] already.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:27] I wrote down here, I wonder what it
[1:35:30] would be like to have all prayer and all
[1:35:33] night prayer. Where's all night prayer
[1:35:34] meetings?
[1:35:37] Get my phone, would you, brother?
[1:35:42] I thought, you know, if I felt like I do
[1:35:45] when I pray half the time, I wouldn't
[1:35:47] last all night. I wouldn't feel like
[1:35:49] praying all night. It would be a chore.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:35:54] And I just happen to believe that if you
[1:35:56] go into that realm,
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; that it shouldn't be a chore.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; No, it's kind of like a good church
[1:36:03] service. It's before you know, Amen.
[1:36:06] Hours have passed.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Is that right? We've sat there and boy,
[1:36:11] you mean to tell me it's been two hours
[1:36:13] already. What would it be like for us to
[1:36:15] stay here till 12:00 like Paul and them
[1:36:18] did and preach all night,
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; pray all night? Can you imagine what
[1:36:24] kind of power you'd have? Everybody ask
[1:36:27] you, man, what church do you go to? What
[1:36:30] do you believe? What makes you so sweet,
[1:36:33] so kind, so gentle, so loving, so meek?
[1:36:37] Man, you're such a nice person.
[1:36:40] Hello. I say, I'll tell you why. Because
[1:36:43] I've got faith in God. Why are you so
[1:36:46] kind? Cuz I got faith in God. What makes
[1:36:48] your sister dress right? Amen. In skirts
[1:36:50] and not cutting your hair. Cuz I got
[1:36:52] God. I believe in God.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; I have faith in God.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; I was listening to a tape
[1:37:09] and I he says it this way.
[1:37:13] all things. Now, sincerely, sincerity,
[1:37:16] we don't have it. It seems to be such a
[1:37:20] small interest. It should be in a time
[1:37:22] of this jubilee right now after we know
[1:37:25] and are positive of these things. It
[1:37:28] should be that Shreveport would be
[1:37:30] buzzing like a buzz saw. The jail ought
[1:37:32] to be full of Christians. I put that
[1:37:35] Christians there because that's who he's
[1:37:37] talking about. Hanging out the windows
[1:37:40] preaching the gospel.
[1:37:42] Hello. The street corners ought to be
[1:37:45] full of men and women testifying of the
[1:37:47] power of God. 1962.
[1:37:51] We've lost our sincerity. We've lost
[1:37:54] that and the enthusiasm that it is to
[1:37:56] receive it. That's the truth. That's
[1:37:59] exactly right. Amen.
[1:38:07] Listen, we've lost our sincerity and
[1:38:10] enthusiasm to receive it. We will we'll
[1:38:13] never come back until we come down to
[1:38:15] that spot of appreciation of God making
[1:38:18] a way for us. How many believes that?
[1:38:21] And then calling us in it and
[1:38:23] vindicating it to us by the spirit and
[1:38:26] by his word, the assurance of it.
[1:38:31] Amen.
[1:38:32] Praise the Lord. Did I read you this
[1:38:34] whole thing?
[1:38:42] Yes, I did.
[1:38:44] But I was thinking, you know,
[1:38:47] Lord, help me.
[1:38:50] What would it be like if a lot of us
[1:38:51] went home tonight
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; and you didn't go to bed till 3:00 in
[1:38:56] the morning
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; because you got to praying
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; and praying and getting caught up in
[1:39:01] that spirit.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; I have 100% confidence the next day you
[1:39:07] wouldn't be all groggy.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; The Lord would give you strength.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Where is our all where's our meetings?
[1:39:14] Where is our street corner preaching? He
[1:39:16] says the street corners ought to be full
[1:39:18] of people testifying of the power of
[1:39:20] God. And folks, when I think about a
[1:39:23] lack of testifying and going and
[1:39:25] witnessing and doing what you know after
[1:39:28] what God has done,
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; I mean, we've got we've got it people.
[1:39:32] We've got what we can say. Look, this is
[1:39:34] it, folks. God vindicated this. This is
[1:39:37] proven. You know, listen to it. If you
[1:39:40] can't believe it, listen to it.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Play them the tape.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; I listen to you, brother. preacher or
[1:39:46] preaching here uh uh yesterday and he
[1:39:48] says, "I heard about a couple of people
[1:39:50] that were listening to the tapes. They
[1:39:52] were listening a couple messages." He
[1:39:54] says, "And they said they got saved."
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. You can get saved
[1:40:00] listening to the messages.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; It's got that kind of power.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:15] What did brother Ram say? He says the
[1:40:17] only power we got anymore, Amen. is and
[1:40:21] the only fire we have the world that is.
[1:40:24] I don't believe it's in our message main
[1:40:26] message ranks.
[1:40:28] I am I don't go evangelize,
[1:40:31] but I'm sure that you can go to some
[1:40:33] churches and you have a you've got a
[1:40:35] have a big old
[1:40:37] pry bar. Pry bar to get a amen out of
[1:40:40] folks.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah out of folks. Hello.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Some people are stiff and starchy is
[1:40:46] what brother Bam said.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; But God help us not to be that way.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, wake them up. Lord, help me wake
[1:40:53] up.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. realize, hey, this thing is
[1:40:56] something that we need to give our all
[1:40:57] to.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Let me uh before coming to my closing
[1:41:04] statement, I want to say one more thing.
[1:41:05] One more thing that chokes chokes
[1:41:09] Amen. and takes takes out the power out
[1:41:11] of our lives.
[1:41:15] And it's so simple.
[1:41:20] So simple,
[1:41:22] but it's the cares of life.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; The need to make ends meet.
[1:41:34] We need to make ends meet. You got to
[1:41:36] work for it.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:41:40] But sometimes we spend so much time,
[1:41:42] more time than what we should
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; to try to make ends meet.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; It that's just the cares of life.
[1:41:54] There's two scriptures I had. One was in
[1:41:58] Luke 8
[1:42:01] and 14. And that which fell among thorns
[1:42:04] are they which when they have heard go
[1:42:06] forth and are choked with the cares and
[1:42:10] riches and pleasures of life.
[1:42:15] the cares, the riches and pleasures
[1:42:20] can take the power of God out of your
[1:42:23] life.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; How many knows we got to be careful that
[1:42:26] that doesn't become more important to us
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; than God
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; reading prayer churchmen.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Because it has a tendency to take out
[1:42:38] the real power of God out of your life.
[1:42:40] One more scripture and then I want final
[1:42:42] quote and we'll close. 21 chapter of
[1:42:44] Luke, he says about the fig tree and all
[1:42:47] the trees when they go shoot forth. Ye
[1:42:50] see and know that of your own selves
[1:42:52] that summer is nigh at hand. So likewise
[1:42:55] ye when she shall see all these come to
[1:42:57] pass. Know that the kingdom of God is
[1:42:59] not at hand. Verily I say unto you, this
[1:43:01] generation shall not pass away till all
[1:43:03] be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall
[1:43:05] pass away, but my words shall not pass
[1:43:08] away. Now notice when he says when you
[1:43:11] get down to where this is where we are,
[1:43:13] isn't it? The fig tree putting forth his
[1:43:16] beds. This generation shall not pass.
[1:43:18] When he gets done with all of that, here
[1:43:20] is his warning. And take heed to
[1:43:23] yourself, least at any times your hearts
[1:43:26] be overcharged with surfetting.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I pulled that up about surfing.
[1:43:34] It said something about an excessive
[1:43:35] amount of something. an excessive amount
[1:43:38] of something. Amen. And drunkenness and
[1:43:42] cares of this life. So that that day
[1:43:45] come upon you unaware.
[1:43:47] So that was God. That was Jesus's own
[1:43:50] warning that you don't be overcharged
[1:43:52] with the cares of life. Amen.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; What does that have to do with where our
[1:43:58] minds are?
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Where our goals are. Amen.
[1:44:04] that it doesn't become more because
[1:44:07] because listen to what he says so that
[1:44:10] that take that day come upon you
[1:44:13] unawares
[1:44:15] for as a snare.
[1:44:18] Isn't it something that I think in other
[1:44:20] scriptures says as a thief in the night
[1:44:22] but here it says as a snare. What's a
[1:44:26] snare? Well, from what I understand,
[1:44:27] it's them snares that you put out in the
[1:44:29] field and right and something comes up
[1:44:30] and they don't see that wire, but all of
[1:44:33] a sudden they're in it and they can't
[1:44:34] get out of it and they're stuck.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; How many know that's what the
[1:44:38] tribulation's going to be? They're in
[1:44:40] it. They're stuck. They can't get out of
[1:44:42] it. They missed the rapture
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; as a snare.
[1:44:47] It will come upon all them that dwell
[1:44:49] upon the earth. Amen. So don't be
[1:44:54] letting the cares of this life,
[1:44:58] riches, cares, pleasures,
[1:45:01] whatever it is,
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; keep your focus on the Lord.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Between now and Sunday,
[1:45:11] don't do the same thing you did between
[1:45:13] last Sunday
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; and tonight.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; If you're not where you ought to be with
[1:45:18] God and you need more of God,
[1:45:21] Amen. Make more time to meditate on him.
[1:45:26] Make more time to pray because the devil
[1:45:29] knows if you're too busy to think about
[1:45:31] God and his word, it'll be it won't be
[1:45:33] long. And y'all know what I'm talking
[1:45:35] about before you're like, "Boy, I
[1:45:37] haven't really thought about God for a
[1:45:38] while." And you know, and and God and
[1:45:41] the church just doesn't mean as much as
[1:45:43] to me as it should. That's
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; right. Is that right? How many knows
[1:45:46] it's easy for that to happen?
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so busy in this. This is
[1:45:49] Wednesday, but I really want to get this
[1:45:51] done.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Huh? This is Sunday. I really want to
[1:45:54] get this uh you know, I I I I can't go.
[1:45:57] Watch those words. I can't go.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we love to have church,
[1:46:01] don't we?
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Now, listen to this. Brother Brandham,
[1:46:05] after scolding the Pentecostals and say,
[1:46:07] "Man, it's gotten to where if somebody
[1:46:09] screams, everybody turns their head like
[1:46:10] a goose and everything else and really
[1:46:12] chopping them." and also his own church
[1:46:14] preaching at his own church talking
[1:46:16] about uh uh watch out the Philistines
[1:46:19] are upon you. Amen. How many could say
[1:46:23] or should I say by the spirit speaking
[1:46:25] amen watch out lay out is on you.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; How many is after you? It wants you to
[1:46:30] make you lukewarm. It wants you to get
[1:46:33] backslid. It wants you miserable,
[1:46:35] wretched, poor like it is.
[1:46:38] Amen.
[1:46:40] Now, there's here's the only hope that I
[1:46:43] have this morning at the end of that
[1:46:45] message to wind up the message is this.
[1:46:49] While Samson was bound, a new shock of
[1:46:52] hair growed out.
[1:46:55] Amen. Amen. We might say while people
[1:46:58] around the message that are dying and
[1:47:00] falling away, getting lukewarm,
[1:47:04] hello,
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; there's a new shock of hair growing on.
[1:47:08] God sends us another church just before
[1:47:12] the end time that the power of the Holy
[1:47:15] Ghost can come into her
[1:47:18] in the denomin oh my in the
[1:47:20] denominations of the spirit he says in
[1:47:23] the demonstrations of the spirit and
[1:47:25] Mark 16 can follow that church Acts 2:4
[1:47:29] Acts 2:38 I will be following right
[1:47:32] along with that church signs and wonders
[1:47:35] accompanying the apostles great signs of
[1:47:37] his resurrection ction accompany on
[1:47:39] them. While we're in prison, surely
[1:47:42] God's growing a crop somewhere for the
[1:47:44] last great kill.
[1:47:48] That's right, brother Mam. You said it.
[1:47:51] We're here.
[1:47:53] Yes. Is the crop that is you talked
[1:47:55] about. Signs and wonders following the
[1:47:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; A church that's got the power in it. A
[1:48:04] church that's got the glory in it. Yes.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Can I just say what comes to mind?
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Our women have long hair.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; That is her glory.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; It's a glory for women to have long
[1:48:17] hair.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Oh boy. I thought I was going to quit.
[1:48:22] But what's happened?
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; What happened to the church? Brother
[1:48:25] BCified preachers.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That ain't got no
[1:48:30] backbone anymore.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:34] I wanted to say
[1:48:36] in the spirit to the church world out
[1:48:39] there, sisters, where has your hair
[1:48:43] gone?
[1:48:44] Where's your power gone? It's your
[1:48:46] power. It's your Nazerite now.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I'll tell you where it's gone. It
[1:48:56] left when the preacher got up there and
[1:48:57] said, "It don't really matter." That's
[1:48:59] where it went.
[1:49:03] What's the problem today in the
[1:49:05] Pentecost world? They're wearing pant
[1:49:08] now. They're not wearing skirts anymore.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:49:15] And not only that, it's worse yet. Guess
[1:49:18] what? The woman is up here preaching.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; She done got the man sat down. She done
[1:49:25] got the preacher sitting in the pews and
[1:49:28] she's up here telling them what to do.
[1:49:31] Isn't that the pathetic?
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they drifted away. Because
[1:49:37] they let Delilah woo them.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; How many would say, "I'm not going to
[1:49:43] let Delilah
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; woo me."
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. The things of the world is
[1:49:48] not going to entice me.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; No. Uh-uh.
[1:49:52] Lord, help us.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; It starts right up here, Brother Brad.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Starts with us.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:02] Amen.
[1:50:03] I'm glad that I ain't got to preach to
[1:50:07] that
[1:50:08] balcony up there.
[1:50:12] Huh? I thank God that people love to
[1:50:15] hear the truth.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; People come to church to hear the truth.
[1:50:19] Y'all love the truth. That's where you
[1:50:20] come. Amen.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that there's a group of
[1:50:23] people that God's got that loves his
[1:50:25] word
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; that won't let Elida, don't let the
[1:50:29] world, don't let the pleasures of life,
[1:50:30] don't let any of that rob you
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; of your power.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Listen, it's not about
[1:50:39] this is what it's about. It's about
[1:50:41] every one of us as an individual having
[1:50:44] our morning prayer, our noon prayer, our
[1:50:46] all day prayer, praying always, having a
[1:50:48] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:50:51] a relationship that in the spiritual
[1:50:53] realm I come to the garden alone while
[1:50:55] the dew is still on the roses. Ain't
[1:50:57] that right? Amen. And he walks with me
[1:50:59] and he talks with me. Amen. He tells me
[1:51:01] that I am his own. When we come forth
[1:51:03] from that garden, we're sweet. We're
[1:51:06] tender. We're meek. We're loving. People
[1:51:09] can tell when you've been praying. They
[1:51:11] can tell when you've been meditating on
[1:51:13] the Lord. You're dedicated to God.
[1:51:16] That's what it's all about.
[1:51:20] Amen.
[1:51:22] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Stand. Amen. That
[1:51:25] is my message tonight. I feel the Lord's
[1:51:26] laid on my heart to speak. Amen. Beware.
[1:51:30] Beware. Ain't that right? Don't let
[1:51:34] Delilah rob you. Don't let the devil
[1:51:37] steal your secret,
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; your faith, your prayer life. Amen. Your
[1:51:43] meditation of your heart. Of course,
[1:51:45] that's just a couple things, but that's
[1:51:47] one of the main lines right there. Faith
[1:51:49] in God. Amen. That'll give you power
[1:51:52] over the enemy. Keep that faith. Amen.
[1:51:55] God bless you. Let's have a word of
[1:51:57] prayer. Thank the Lord for coming. How
[1:51:59] many believe he came in a special way?
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. He really did. You know,
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; he really did. And I I just thank the
[1:52:05] Lord.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Thank him that he promised he would
[1:52:09] never leave us nor forsake us even to
[1:52:11] the end of the world.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; He's going to have a crop. How many
[1:52:14] believe there's going to be a crop from
[1:52:16] this seed that's been planted? And you
[1:52:18] and I are part of that crop.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be part of that crop. I
[1:52:23] could jump over this pulpit and do a
[1:52:25] double flip and land on my feet
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; only in my mind. But I done did it.
[1:52:29] Hello. That's how glad I am. Amen. To be
[1:52:32] a part of the crop of God.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:52:40] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Let's just raise
[1:52:43] our hands. Precious Lord and Savior, we
[1:52:45] want to thank you God for what you have
[1:52:48] done for sending down in our hearts that
[1:52:51] grace, amazing grace. How sweet this
[1:52:54] sound that saved a wretch like us, Lord.
[1:52:58] That give us the faith, Lord, to access
[1:53:00] this grace, Lord Jesus. You even give
[1:53:03] that to us, to have that faith, to
[1:53:05] receive that faith to believe in you,
[1:53:07] Lord. We could be like that Tyler who
[1:53:09] had let the devil take a hold of him and
[1:53:12] take hatred in his life and put murder
[1:53:14] in his life and cause him to go many
[1:53:17] miles just to shoot somebody. What a
[1:53:20] horrible devil. What a horrible
[1:53:22] miserable devil that he has had to have
[1:53:25] in his heart. God, I pray for him. I
[1:53:28] pray for mercy for him, Lord Jesus. And
[1:53:31] I ask tonight, Father, as we give you
[1:53:33] honor and glory and praise, Lord, for
[1:53:35] what you have done in our lives, Lord,
[1:53:36] help us, God, to go tomorrow,
[1:53:40] may every saint of Evening Night
[1:53:42] Tabernacle tomorrow be a stronger
[1:53:44] Christian than what they are today. May
[1:53:47] they call out the things that are
[1:53:49] causing them, Lord, to choke. The cares
[1:53:52] that are causing them to choke. those
[1:53:54] listening, streaming, if there's
[1:53:56] something in their life that's choking
[1:53:58] them, it's choking them. Lord, I pray
[1:54:01] God, let them cast that aside and say,
[1:54:04] "Devil, you're not going to bind me with
[1:54:05] this bind. No, I'm going to cut free
[1:54:08] from this thing that binds me and that
[1:54:11] keeps me from the power of God. Keep the
[1:54:13] love of God out of my life, causes me to
[1:54:15] become formal, cold, starchy,
[1:54:18] different." God, forgive me, Lord Jesus.
[1:54:21] Well, we have been starchy. where we
[1:54:23] have been stiff, Lord, and where we have
[1:54:25] gotten backslid. We ask God that you
[1:54:27] just bless each and every one now, Lord,
[1:54:30] and help us to reassign, reassess, Lord,
[1:54:34] our timeline, our calendar, Lord, and to
[1:54:37] redeem the time, Father, and bring it
[1:54:39] back to you, Lord, so we'd have more
[1:54:41] time for you, God. I thank you, Lord
[1:54:43] Jesus, that I was able, Lord, today just
[1:54:45] to take the whole day off, Lord, and
[1:54:47] just a massive meditate upon you, to
[1:54:49] rest and meditate and ask you, God. And
[1:54:52] I knew I had prayer warriors praying for
[1:54:54] me, Lord, when I sat down at that desk,
[1:54:56] Lord. And I begin to pray. So Lord, now
[1:54:58] bring it, Lord. Lord, and you did within
[1:55:00] a few minutes, Lord. And I thank God for
[1:55:02] a group of people, Lord, that prays and
[1:55:05] you, Father, you answer our prayer. Then
[1:55:07] you come here in a special way, Lord,
[1:55:09] and do exceedingly abundantly above all
[1:55:11] that we ask or think, Lord. Now, Lord,
[1:55:14] as we raise our hands to you and say, I
[1:55:15] surrender all to you, Lord, Father, so
[1:55:18] that you might use me, Father. Just use
[1:55:21] us Lord for your kingdom for your glory.
[1:55:23] Bless every young person Lord. May they
[1:55:25] rededicate themselves to you Lord to
[1:55:28] prayer to Lord listening to your voice
[1:55:31] to communion with you in prayer Lord and
[1:55:33] may you speak to their hearts and may
[1:55:36] they become Lord real pillars Father
[1:55:38] that can never be moved. Amen. So that
[1:55:41] they could sing that song I shall not be
[1:55:44] I shall not be moved. Amen. Just like a
[1:55:47] tree that's planted by the waters. We
[1:55:49] want young people to get stable, have a
[1:55:52] revelation, God, that'll hold them all
[1:55:55] through their life like you have done
[1:55:56] from my life, Lord Jesus, from the time
[1:55:59] of 20 to now, God, may they have that
[1:56:02] same experience of the new birth and a
[1:56:04] relationship with you. Each one in here,
[1:56:06] God, and those listening, Father, I
[1:56:08] pray, bring strength to your church
[1:56:11] again. Bring power to your church again,
[1:56:14] Lord, like never before. as we get ready
[1:56:16] to leave this place in Jesus name we
[1:56:19] pray. Amen and amen. God bless you
[1:56:22] church. We love y'all.

[1:56:31] with me. Bless you buddy. Love you.

[1:57:01] He speaks and the sound of his voice.
[1:57:08] Oh, it's so sweet.
[1:57:11] The birds hush their singing
[1:57:17] and the meloy
[1:57:21] that he gave to me.
[1:57:26] If
[1:57:28] my heart
[1:57:30] is singing
[1:57:36] and he walks with me and he talks
[1:57:44] with me
[1:57:46] and he tells me I am his own.

[1:58:13] I stayed in the garden with him.
[1:58:21] Though the night
[1:58:23] all around me is falling,
[1:58:29] but he bids me go
[1:58:34] through the voice
[1:58:36] of all.
[1:58:38] His voice to me
[1:58:42] is calling.
[1:58:47] [Music]
[1:58:48] And he walks with me. And he talks
[1:58:56] with me.
[1:58:58] And he tells
[1:59:00] me I am his own.
[1:59:04] [Music]
[1:59:07] And the joy
[1:59:09] we share
