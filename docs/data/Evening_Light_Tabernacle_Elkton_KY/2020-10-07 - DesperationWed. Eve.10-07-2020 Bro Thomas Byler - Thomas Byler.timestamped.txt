[30:07] we'll just turn to saint luke
[30:11] the 16th chapter saint luke 16
[30:15] i think about a week ago this thought
[30:17] came to me
[30:19] and i just something uh in me wanted to
[30:22] preach on it
[30:24] uh but then last sunday i preached on
[30:25] something a little different
[30:27] but i would like to take tonight with
[30:29] the help of the lord and speak on
[30:32] on what the holy spirit i felt like
[30:39] influenced on my heart to speak perhaps
[30:42] it'll be something that
[30:44] we have need of i believe it is so in
[30:47] hebrew
[30:48] not hebrews in saint luke
[30:52] the 16th chapter
[30:57] and verse 16.
[31:01] the law and the prophets were until john
[31:05] and since that time the kingdom of god
[31:07] is preached
[31:08] and every man presses into it
[31:13] amen praise the lord may god his
[31:15] blessings to reading words you can be
[31:17] seated
[31:18] amen can anybody tell me tonight
[31:21] what sermon brother brandon preached
[31:23] after reading that scripture
[31:27] amen well it was desperation
[31:32] desperation amen so i want to speak on
[31:35] that with
[31:35] the help of the lord for a little while
[31:37] and we're talking about
[31:39] desperation amen brother branham he
[31:42] makes this statement he says you know
[31:45] he says now desperations he says usually
[31:49] it takes a state of emergency to throw
[31:52] us into desperation
[31:56] amen see it's too bad
[31:59] that it has to do that amen
[32:03] but human beings are so thoughtful
[32:07] in their mind that it takes
[32:10] an emergency something has to arise
[32:14] and when it does it throws them
[32:17] into that desperation
[32:21] amen then he goes to talking about
[32:24] really in doing that
[32:25] in desperation he brings out the real
[32:27] thing that you are
[32:29] and it shows what you're made out of in
[32:31] a time
[32:32] of desperation it usually pulls out all
[32:36] the good things
[32:37] that's in you amen
[32:40] praise the lord so
[32:45] he says you know
[32:51] let me just read this down here he was
[32:54] talking about israel
[32:57] and when they were fixing to
[33:01] leave egypt and the passover now brother
[33:04] bannon had preached on the token just
[33:06] before this
[33:07] okay the token and how vital that the
[33:10] token was
[33:12] uh token and then he preached
[33:13] desperation after that
[33:15] and he talked about israel how that they
[33:18] were
[33:19] in a desperate place a place of
[33:22] desperation
[33:24] amen so he says because see they had
[33:27] seen the great hand of god
[33:29] they'd saw all of his miracles and then
[33:32] they come
[33:33] under the sign of the token and while
[33:36] they were
[33:36] under the sign of the token they'd taken
[33:39] the communion
[33:41] in desperation that night was a very
[33:44] desperate hour
[33:45] because they all knew that judgment was
[33:47] going to strike
[33:49] that right the new judgment was going to
[33:52] strike and it throwed them
[33:54] into desperation they had seen all the
[33:56] miracles that got it done
[33:58] here god was fixing to bring judgment
[34:00] down upon the world and upon egypt
[34:02] and it caused them to have basically a
[34:06] way of escape and we all know the story
[34:09] of how they were to post uh blood on the
[34:11] little of the door and so forth and
[34:12] everything they were supposed to do
[34:14] and to take communion amen to eat the
[34:16] lamb and so forth
[34:18] and they were taking communion and
[34:21] and they were taking the community in
[34:23] desperation for they knew
[34:26] at the time that god was fixing to
[34:29] strike
[34:30] with judgment it was a shaking time
[34:33] amen a shaking time it was a time where
[34:36] every man
[34:38] was examining himself amen
[34:44] it was a time of examining himself
[34:47] because the word of god or of the
[34:49] prophet had not failed
[34:51] one time now put on your as brother
[34:55] bannon would say that spear your
[34:57] spiritual thinking cap
[34:59] because how many knows that everything
[35:01] the prophets have said to us has come to
[35:03] pass and they're right
[35:04] all the signs all the wonders and so
[35:07] forth
[35:08] amen and it's fixing to god's fixing to
[35:11] bring
[35:11] judgment upon the world let me just read
[35:14] a little further
[35:16] he says now notice because the word of
[35:17] the prophet had not failed one time
[35:19] it had been proven to be true whatever
[35:22] he said it happened just exactly the way
[35:25] that he said it
[35:27] amen the pillar of fire was still there
[35:30] and then the prophet had announced that
[35:32] god would only pass over
[35:34] when he saw the token at the door it was
[35:38] a desperation i want to take
[35:42] just one moment here talk about the the
[35:45] theme or the
[35:47] uh the core perhaps of the message that
[35:50] we want to speak on tonight the core of
[35:52] it is
[35:53] it has to do with the type of character
[35:56] that god is going to live with the type
[35:59] of character
[36:00] that is going to be in the bride of
[36:02] jesus christ
[36:04] there's other words and i'll go to the
[36:06] scriptures other words that i want to
[36:07] use
[36:08] as a substitute of perhaps uh
[36:11] desperation
[36:12] all right couple of other words that i
[36:14] want to use but it's around
[36:16] around a talking about the character
[36:19] that we're supposed to have
[36:21] all right so first of all let me
[36:24] establish with what the prophet said
[36:26] about this desperation and and
[36:29] and where it should be and how it should
[36:31] be with us
[36:33] so he says um all right
[36:36] so he says god would only pass over when
[36:38] he saw the token at the door
[36:40] it was a desperation now i believe that
[36:43] we're living
[36:44] in the days or otherwise the days that
[36:47] we're living in
[36:48] it should cause the church to go
[36:51] completely into desperation
[36:58] i believe since the message this morning
[37:00] from god not me
[37:01] i believe it ought to throw this entire
[37:04] congregation
[37:06] into desperation
[37:10] amen that we have played
[37:14] church long enough
[37:19] we've went to church long enough he says
[37:22] we've got
[37:23] to do something amen so this desperation
[37:27] the prophet of god talked about he says
[37:30] this aspiration is to cause every member
[37:33] everybody at the tabernacle amen to
[37:37] examine themselves
[37:40] and to look to see whether you're
[37:42] playing church
[37:45] whether you're playing with this about
[37:47] christianity and
[37:49] the welfare of your soul or if you're
[37:51] really serious about it or if you're not
[37:53] serious about it
[37:57] because what is the opposite of
[37:58] desperation
[38:02] well many words could use it uh describe
[38:05] it
[38:05] what did you say hon i heard somebody
[38:12] all right that's right that's a good
[38:14] word one word would be just lacks
[38:17] or you know mediocre or something just
[38:21] just lukewarm right just not desperate
[38:27] you know as i was thinking about this
[38:29] message i was thinking about desperation
[38:32] you know brother branham clearly making
[38:34] a statement that they'd ought to throw
[38:36] everybody into desperation it ought to
[38:38] cause people to become
[38:39] very serious about god
[38:43] and about their welfare and i thought
[38:47] about this as i was saying
[38:48] you know uh you know i really want to
[38:51] read this other first before i say this
[38:52] but i'm gonna go ahead and say it i
[38:54] don't know i've
[38:54] got the cat out of the bag but everybody
[38:57] sooner or later everybody is going to
[39:01] fulfill this
[39:04] everybody in time will
[39:07] become very desperate
[39:11] it will the whole world is going to get
[39:14] throwed
[39:14] into desperation
[39:17] [Music]
[39:18] a couple weeks ago we went through the
[39:19] scriptures and talked about the wrath of
[39:21] god when it's poured out
[39:22] how did they'll run amen and then hide
[39:25] themselves in the dens and the caves of
[39:27] the earth and say hide it's from him
[39:29] huh and then into another place he talks
[39:32] about you know
[39:33] there'll be millions of people that'll
[39:34] come to church to come to the altar
[39:36] they'll seek god
[39:38] they'll scream god help us god help us
[39:40] they'll get desperate
[39:42] about wanting god but they're not going
[39:44] to have it
[39:47] huh you're not going to get it because
[39:49] when the call
[39:51] came out for the world to become
[39:52] desperate and to get serious about
[39:55] and quit playing when that call went out
[39:57] they were just like
[39:58] the days ago and they're right
[40:03] but everybody will you will the whole
[40:05] world will
[40:07] get into desperation but the bride of
[40:10] jesus christ should stay
[40:12] in desperation in vigilance
[40:16] in other words for desperation to me
[40:18] would be vigilant
[40:20] [Music]
[40:22] how many believes we need to be vigilant
[40:25] every day i believe the blood of jesus
[40:27] christ should be
[40:28] vigilant okay
[40:32] and i'm going to go on to a couple of
[40:33] these other thoughts
[40:35] and uh but peter first peter the last
[40:38] chapter which is five
[40:40] it says be sober be sober
[40:44] and be vigilant
[40:48] all right because your adversary the
[40:50] devil as a roaring lion
[40:52] walketh about seeking whom he may
[40:54] destroy
[40:58] amen so the bible tells us to be
[41:00] vigilant be desperate
[41:03] another another message brother bannon
[41:05] preached a lot i believe was perseverant
[41:08] and that right perseverance pressing
[41:11] into it
[41:13] pushing on trying a little
[41:17] huh because somebody knows if you're
[41:20] sitting here tonight you can probably
[41:21] amen
[41:22] the fact that we have a real strong
[41:25] tendency to relax
[41:35] become slothful and hey before you long
[41:38] you're sleeping
[41:40] some people the only preacher can be
[41:41] running up down the aisle some people
[41:43] sleep
[41:45] huh that's not vigilant right
[41:48] not desperation but we as human beings
[41:53] brother bam says he's you know we in our
[41:55] minds
[41:55] we tend to become that way amen
[41:59] we tend to lean towards being
[42:03] slothful in our mind
[42:07] amen we tend the whole world is that way
[42:09] very much very much now
[42:11] you're very slothful you're not
[42:13] desperate they're not vigilant they're
[42:15] not
[42:16] uh perseverant but like i said this has
[42:19] to do with the character
[42:20] that jesus is looking to have lived with
[42:23] and brother branham used this scripture
[42:24] that the bible talks about
[42:26] that even to enter into the kingdom of
[42:29] heaven it says that
[42:30] they have to press
[42:34] now i preach a lot about just having
[42:36] faith and just accepting it and
[42:38] believing it right
[42:39] i believe there is that side but there's
[42:42] another side i did god wants to know
[42:45] whether you're serious or not
[42:48] i mean god wants to know he likes to
[42:49] test you he wants to see how serious you
[42:52] really
[42:52] are you might think i've got the faith i
[42:55] got the faith to believe and god don't
[42:57] answer and boy
[42:59] i thought that i had faith to do this
[43:01] you know and you get taken back man
[43:03] maybe i didn't you know
[43:05] i guess that's nothing to that i'll just
[43:08] go off somewhere else do something else
[43:10] huh god knew he'd be that way before he
[43:12] ever give it to you probably why he
[43:14] didn't give it to you
[43:18] comes to mind y'all remember buddy
[43:20] robinson right his story
[43:22] man he wanted to get saved he want the
[43:24] holy ghost so bad
[43:25] huh he kept trying he was satisfied but
[43:28] he just never could overcome that
[43:29] problem that he had of biting the mule's
[43:32] ear and temper and everything else
[43:34] isn't that right and he you know hit him
[43:36] over the head and
[43:37] then apologized and he got desperate
[43:40] he got serious about it and got down and
[43:43] he got to
[43:43] between life and death it had to be that
[43:47] way
[43:47] and then god says that's how i wanted
[43:49] you son i wanted you to i wanted to know
[43:51] that you mean it
[43:54] amen press into it
[43:58] you got to press into it amen
[44:02] so we look at this
[44:05] all right so we've played
[44:09] you got to see if you're playing how
[44:11] many this is the time
[44:13] this is the time because we don't know
[44:16] how long we're going to have a church
[44:17] open
[44:19] we don't know how we don't have it
[44:22] wouldn't it wouldn't be something where
[44:23] they
[44:23] fixed the clothes at church and now oh
[44:25] i'm gonna i want i want to get my life
[44:27] right i want to get my
[44:28] why don't you wait so long we had all
[44:30] these times yet this wednesday night yet
[44:32] in between services you had sunday you
[44:34] had all this time to get ready
[44:36] now when the pressure comes you all of a
[44:38] sudden wanted to do this no
[44:39] that's not time to get desperate that's
[44:41] not time and listen from what i'm
[44:43] gathering here
[44:44] you judge you be the judge tonight but
[44:47] from what i'm gathering what from my
[44:48] blood the prophet of god says
[44:50] that he says that the believer ought to
[44:51] be in that state of desperation
[44:54] without the emergency
[44:58] in other words clear-minded you need to
[45:00] be serious-minded
[45:02] and serious minded as if the situation
[45:06] was right there already
[45:09] how many agrees that if you would
[45:11] actually be that desperate about things
[45:13] you'd get a whole lot further you'd be a
[45:15] lot better off if you would just have
[45:17] that desperation
[45:18] without the emergency
[45:22] you'd be a whole lot happier person
[45:28] this church would be in a whole lot
[45:30] better condition
[45:31] if we would all be in that state all the
[45:34] time without the death
[45:35] without the problem without the
[45:38] emergency
[45:40] amen i think that's why i laid on my
[45:42] heart
[45:44] because i felt like i was just like
[45:45] floating along like slothful or just
[45:47] like
[45:48] you know and i'm like you know i don't
[45:49] think it's supposed to be like this
[45:52] you know the lord victor says you know
[45:53] remember what i told you about
[45:54] desperation
[45:57] you know i told you to be desperate
[45:59] without the emergency if man could just
[46:01] be this way
[46:03] all right so
[46:08] he says now how is it that we can see
[46:11] other great signs and wonders done by
[46:14] others
[46:15] and what about us he says it should
[46:17] cause
[46:18] an estate of desperation
[46:24] that we are determined before god that
[46:26] the signs of
[46:28] his coming should bring this entire
[46:30] congregation
[46:31] amen when we read it from the word and
[46:34] the holy spirit has
[46:36] told us that all these things would
[46:38] happen
[46:39] so forth brother brandon was talking
[46:41] about the cloud coming down when i got
[46:43] it said everything that was gonna happen
[46:44] it all happened
[46:46] i mean he believes that when god says
[46:48] something in this message it has
[46:49] happened
[46:50] and it will happen and it ought to make
[46:52] us desperate
[46:54] we see it unfolding we see the world
[46:57] truly
[46:58] falling apart like he said it was back
[47:01] in 1965
[47:04] and we began to see that falling apart
[47:06] it ought to make us
[47:07] examine ourselves to see god am i
[47:10] where i should be right now
[47:14] or am i slow is my prayer life down
[47:19] [Music]
[47:21] oh my that's right
[47:26] again this was in paragraph 52 here's
[47:30] paragraph 61.
[47:33] desperations desperation signs of his
[47:36] coming
[47:37] should throw every member of christ
[47:40] into desperation now
[47:45] about our souls
[47:48] about our welfare for hereafter
[47:55] listen everybody
[47:58] the signs of his coming should throw
[48:00] every member of christ
[48:01] into desperation now about our souls
[48:05] our welfare for here
[48:09] after
[48:12] i like that that's why i said it twice
[48:15] if you noticed
[48:18] the welfare your welfare for the
[48:21] hereafter
[48:24] hey man because i'll tell you right now
[48:29] our bodies our minds everything around
[48:32] us it is about
[48:34] our existence here not necessarily about
[48:38] our existence in the hereafter
[48:44] where are you gonna be when the rapture
[48:47] comes what condition
[48:49] are you in now are you ready for the
[48:51] rapture or not
[48:53] if the law would come from the clouds
[48:56] from the skies and
[48:57] appear to those that are raising already
[49:00] amen would you be ready to go
[49:04] it's either yes or no right now
[49:11] right now you have to ask yourself is
[49:14] are you playing church
[49:16] are you are you really desperate about
[49:18] it because if you're not ready
[49:20] then you haven't been desperate like you
[49:22] should
[49:24] amen and that's this message is
[49:25] definitely for you
[49:27] you need to get desperate about your
[49:29] soul and about your hereafter
[49:31] because we know we don't have long to
[49:33] say
[49:34] it doesn't matter if another republican
[49:36] if trump's there another four years if
[49:38] the democrat doesn't made a bit of
[49:42] difference
[49:44] it doesn't make a bit of difference
[49:45] that's just a small thing being worried
[49:47] about that
[49:47] worried about the big thing and that is
[49:49] leaving this place
[49:51] because it's going to go down one way or
[49:53] the other it's going down
[49:59] she's going to sink amen
[50:03] all right so establishing once again
[50:07] talking about the desperations and the
[50:09] condition i believe the prophet of god
[50:11] said that the church ought to be in
[50:14] now i think of brother branham of
[50:17] whether he was desperate or not
[50:18] how blessed was brother branham how
[50:20] perseverant was brother branham
[50:22] huh preached perseverance amen he talked
[50:25] about
[50:26] amen being up and doing and amen and not
[50:28] being thoughtful
[50:31] and he he i believe in his life truly
[50:34] demonstrated
[50:35] desperation because you can listen to
[50:38] his messages all the way to 65
[50:41] and he only got hotter for the lord he
[50:44] wanted more people saved trying to get
[50:46] people to christ
[50:47] is that right all the way sacrificed his
[50:51] life with his family and his children
[50:53] to try to get people into the kingdom of
[50:56] god
[50:57] he lived a life of desperation it's time
[51:00] don't wait am i right he did
[51:05] i believe that ought to rub off on the
[51:06] bride that all of our life
[51:09] we are in desperation in a state of
[51:11] desperation
[51:12] in its state of vigilance in a state
[51:16] of perseverance sincerity
[51:21] amen it'll make all the difference in
[51:25] the world
[51:28] all right
[51:31] so the welfare
[51:35] of our selves hereafter
[51:38] he says well right after that what are
[51:41] we going to
[51:42] going to amount to if we gain the whole
[51:44] world
[51:46] but if we lose our soul
[51:49] huh
[51:53] you think about our
[51:56] most of our senators and a lot of these
[51:58] people that are
[51:59] worth 100 million dollars and 200
[52:01] million dollars and billionaires and
[52:04] all of that stuff you think well what is
[52:07] good
[52:07] is that going to do when it all falls
[52:10] apart
[52:11] not one bit it's only going to come down
[52:13] to one thing in it that is
[52:15] your soul what condition is your soul in
[52:20] you might gain the whole world but what
[52:22] good is that going to do you
[52:24] if you lose your soul amen
[52:28] brother baby says what are we living for
[52:32] what do you work for
[52:37] what does anybody make why do we work
[52:42] well we work so we can eat he says what
[52:43] are you eating for
[52:45] next question what are you eating for
[52:49] what are you struggling for is
[52:52] to live amen
[52:57] how many knows if you found out you had
[52:58] cancer
[53:01] there wasn't hard to be any other
[53:02] concern you would have other than
[53:04] trying to beat that cancer and live
[53:08] that would be your main concern you
[53:10] wouldn't be worried about your bank of
[53:12] cops your neighbors and what everybody
[53:13] else is doing in church wrong or right
[53:15] or whatever
[53:17] huh that's obvious everything else
[53:20] becomes second whole world becomes
[53:21] secondary you want to live
[53:23] what doctor can i find what medicine is
[53:25] there can they cut this thing out of me
[53:27] will i get healed with the lord can i
[53:29] get all touch him can i touch the hem of
[53:30] his garment
[53:31] all those questions would become
[53:33] relevant because you want to do what
[53:36] live hey how many is happy to be live
[53:40] are you glad to be alive ah that's
[53:43] pretty good i guess
[53:44] i don't know about you but i'm ecstatic
[53:46] about being alive
[53:48] i love it i'm glad to be alive
[53:53] that's what i'm struggling for that's
[53:54] what i'm working for
[53:56] huh to live amen
[54:00] and not just the natural life but that's
[54:03] what i'm struggling spiritually for
[54:05] i mean that's why i read my bible that's
[54:08] why i pray that's why i have a
[54:09] compelling with god
[54:11] so that i can live spiritually
[54:16] that's why i love desperation to talk
[54:18] and leadership
[54:20] amen to live
[54:26] and then are you ready for the other
[54:28] part
[54:29] i know some of y'all can answer this
[54:31] what are you living for
[54:34] what are you living for
[54:37] what's the answer according to brother
[54:38] branham
[54:46] what are you living for brother bam says
[54:52] nobody knew huh huh
[54:58] to die
[55:02] very good sister becky to die
[55:07] that's the exact words to die
[55:17] kind of a twist didn't expect that did
[55:20] you
[55:21] all right now notice what he says here
[55:23] you're living
[55:25] and you're living to die because that's
[55:27] what's going to happen
[55:29] if you stay in this world keep drawing
[55:31] breath eventually
[55:33] you're gonna die that's what you're
[55:35] living for is to die
[55:39] all right maybe somebody else has the
[55:41] next
[55:42] phrase in this is a well known by that
[55:44] scripture
[55:45] a quote
[55:52] all right
[55:55] let me see how i can phrase this
[56:01] well i don't know how to phrase this so
[56:03] i'll just read it to you is that right
[56:05] and you're not fit
[56:14] to
[56:16] live is right you're not fit to live
[56:20] until you're fit
[56:23] to die that's what he says you're not
[56:27] fit to live
[56:29] until you're fit to die what's he saying
[56:33] you're not fit to live your life unless
[56:36] you're right with god
[56:38] because you're not ready to die or fit
[56:40] to die unless you're right with god
[56:44] so he sums this whole thing up talking
[56:47] about
[56:48] what's it all about folks it's about
[56:52] being ready to die if you do and meet
[56:55] the lord
[56:55] because how many knows
[56:59] i believe brother bram talked about
[57:01] being burned up in a fire in a car
[57:05] tortured drove through with whatever
[57:08] he says but there's nothing as horrible
[57:10] as a man going out of this world
[57:13] without knowing christ
[57:16] nothing as horrible as somebody dying
[57:19] without god
[57:21] amen so he says
[57:25] last phrase it's true
[57:28] it's true amen
[57:35] now we come to the part where brother
[57:37] brahm tells us why
[57:39] we are not in desperation why
[57:42] people are so lacks
[57:46] thoughtful lacks a basical
[57:50] why i believe that the reason
[57:55] that we don't have desperation
[57:58] is because it's a lack of
[58:03] love
[58:06] the love of god
[58:11] i think that the love of god causes
[58:15] desperation amen
[58:19] if god is in you to token inside of you
[58:22] and you see the conditions of times and
[58:26] people waiting in sin
[58:28] the way that they are it'll throw you
[58:31] into
[58:34] desperation
[58:36] i can't help but believe that part of
[58:38] the reason that i've come to this
[58:39] is because i felt lacks i felt like i'm
[58:42] just a little lacks on the lord
[58:45] there should be a little more exuberance
[58:47] there'd be something more about
[58:49] me you know
[58:54] i did something that i hadn't done and i
[58:56] want to do it a bunch more
[58:58] but the other day upstairs after
[59:02] uh getting up i turned my speaker there
[59:06] by
[59:06] my computer and that i listened to
[59:10] brother branham the music or whatever i
[59:11] took my big speaker and i turned it over
[59:13] to the
[59:14] window opened the window a little bit it
[59:16] was kind of cold out but i was going to
[59:17] go out in the garage and work
[59:19] and i turned it out there and i put it
[59:21] out to the outside so i could hear it
[59:22] and i turned it on real loud
[59:24] and i think i started with psalms
[59:26] somewhere early in the psalms
[59:28] and i cranked up the bible and i played
[59:30] that for the biggest part of the day
[59:34] i was hearing the bible read huh
[59:38] i thought about the times that israel
[59:39] would go out and remember they would
[59:41] have bible reading
[59:42] and the priests would read the scrolls
[59:44] and so forth
[59:45] for about a half a day you all remember
[59:47] that they'd read all of it and they'd
[59:49] say the glory of god would come down
[59:52] huh and my how many times did people go
[59:55] to acting up when the glory of god comes
[59:57] down
[59:58] hello that's right but you know it was
[1:00:01] the presence of the word
[1:00:02] and then the god of the word coming down
[1:00:06] and doing something and boy they had a
[1:00:08] jubilee until it says that they couldn't
[1:00:10] even read it anymore because of the
[1:00:13] people's noise
[1:00:15] amen how many knows the holy ghost
[1:00:17] brings life
[1:00:19] wherever jesus is there's always a lot
[1:00:22] of noise
[1:00:23] it can be quiet but there's always noise
[1:00:25] wherever jesus there's life
[1:00:28] but you know i did that for the most
[1:00:30] part of the day
[1:00:31] and i went through there and i'd pick up
[1:00:33] things here and pick up things there
[1:00:35] in ecclesiastes songs of solomon you
[1:00:38] know and we went through quite a few
[1:00:39] different books in that day's time but i
[1:00:41] thought
[1:00:42] that is awesome to have my farm ringing
[1:00:44] with the word of god
[1:00:46] i hope the neighbors heard it huh
[1:00:49] sometimes we gotta listen to their boom
[1:00:51] boom let them listen to the word of god
[1:00:53] a little bit
[1:00:54] i don't the cop coming back there and
[1:00:56] say hey you gotta turn your
[1:00:57] preaching down that's better than your
[1:01:00] rock and roll right
[1:01:02] but anyway why because
[1:01:05] i like to hear the word of god but you
[1:01:07] know it's just feeding me and i was like
[1:01:09] lord help me and this thought came to me
[1:01:12] lord
[1:01:13] help me because as i was reading here
[1:01:16] it talks about brother brown says that
[1:01:19] the reason people are not desperate
[1:01:22] they couldn't give a hoot what
[1:01:23] everybody's condition is
[1:01:26] let's admit it that's the world we're
[1:01:28] living in
[1:01:29] we really don't care what anybody's
[1:01:31] condition is
[1:01:35] you know why because you really don't
[1:01:37] care what your condition is
[1:01:41] huh because how many knows this
[1:01:45] to be true that when you can when you
[1:01:47] care about what condition you're in
[1:01:50] huh because that's what the love of god
[1:01:52] does when the love of god comes on me
[1:01:54] it tells me hey you know you're not
[1:01:56] quite in the condition that you ought to
[1:01:58] be in
[1:02:00] i had to have more desperation how to
[1:02:02] have more fervor
[1:02:04] it doesn't matter how smooth things are
[1:02:06] rolling it doesn't matter how nice
[1:02:08] things are going
[1:02:09] you should still be in a desperation you
[1:02:11] should still be
[1:02:12] vigilant huh
[1:02:16] how many believes that that's what
[1:02:18] brother ben was trying to tell us here
[1:02:20] don't let just that state of emergency
[1:02:22] put you in that
[1:02:23] it's too bad that it takes emergencies
[1:02:25] to get us to a place
[1:02:26] where we can actually get ahold of god
[1:02:28] or whatever it might be
[1:02:31] or be the kind of people that we ought
[1:02:32] to be
[1:02:34] and then in the conclusion of this
[1:02:36] thought is that if you
[1:02:37] care about yourself you'll get yourself
[1:02:40] in the right place
[1:02:41] and the love of god will constrain you
[1:02:43] to pray for others that need it also
[1:02:46] it makes you care for other people how
[1:02:49] many believe that
[1:02:50] that's what the love of god does it
[1:02:52] makes you desperate when you see
[1:02:54] somebody not in the state that they
[1:02:55] ought to be
[1:02:56] slipping from god they're backsliding
[1:02:58] huh
[1:03:01] the church getting too quiet
[1:03:04] everybody just too lack hey you get
[1:03:06] concerned you're like god help us there
[1:03:09] hey man it's too easy to just
[1:03:12] be let it be secondary let god be
[1:03:14] secondary
[1:03:17] huh don't make me get mean here
[1:03:20] but that's almost sometimes for us
[1:03:23] that's a good compliment that's good
[1:03:25] to have god second
[1:03:29] huh because a lot of times we put him
[1:03:32] fourth and fifth and sixth huh no it's
[1:03:36] not good to have him second but
[1:03:37] sometimes we got him five
[1:03:38] somewhere out there you know i i'll be
[1:03:40] i'll be a christian i'll do this you
[1:03:43] know
[1:03:43] you know put god on the back burner he
[1:03:46] ain't even their second anymore
[1:03:50] if we aren't careful hello not saying
[1:03:52] anybody is but i'm just saying we as
[1:03:54] human beings
[1:03:55] everybody here would completely
[1:03:56] understand that it's easy to
[1:03:58] let the devil get that on us where god
[1:04:00] becomes third or fourth
[1:04:02] not even second or let alone first it's
[1:04:06] easy for it to happen folks
[1:04:09] amen all right so i didn't want to get
[1:04:12] too mean but sometimes that about the
[1:04:13] truth isn't it
[1:04:16] so it's the love of god i think i
[1:04:17] thought about what even faith how many
[1:04:19] notes now let me just read a little more
[1:04:20] here we'll go a little further
[1:04:22] so it's here now a lack of love okay
[1:04:27] he says it'll throw you into desperation
[1:04:30] i believe it will
[1:04:32] now the word plainly states in galatians
[1:04:34] 5
[1:04:35] that faith works by love
[1:04:40] amen one place
[1:04:44] brother brown said if a guy if a boy
[1:04:46] really loves a girl and she lives
[1:04:49] somewhere way off somewhere huh
[1:04:53] if he really loves her it might be
[1:04:57] cold it might be whatever but he's going
[1:05:00] to find a way
[1:05:01] to go see her isn't that right
[1:05:05] he'll find a way you know mom and dad
[1:05:08] say look you ain't got no money you
[1:05:10] can't do this out of the other hand
[1:05:11] you'll go get a job for a little while
[1:05:13] you'll save that money you'll get your
[1:05:15] airplane ticket
[1:05:16] and you'll fly there why because it
[1:05:19] gives you faith that
[1:05:20] i believe i can don't tell me i can't
[1:05:23] i'm gonna do it
[1:05:26] huh love brings faith
[1:05:29] faith brings desperation
[1:05:33] amen how many believes that faith
[1:05:36] gives you strength
[1:05:40] how many believes that it gives it
[1:05:42] doesn't make you
[1:05:43] lackadaisical it gives you strength
[1:05:46] faith does didn't motherboard say
[1:05:50] that faith had what on its chest
[1:05:53] was it hair or muscle hair
[1:05:56] right i was debating that i said was it
[1:05:59] hair or was it muscle i'm not sure
[1:06:01] you know what hair has got to do with it
[1:06:02] but he said hair
[1:06:04] so all right another word strength right
[1:06:09] faith makes the sword it has strength in
[1:06:12] it
[1:06:13] praise god how many believes that
[1:06:17] oh my genuine faith brings desperation
[1:06:22] love brings faith faith brings strength
[1:06:25] faith also brings perseverance
[1:06:28] amen inspiration
[1:06:32] like the woman with the blood issue is
[1:06:35] that right
[1:06:36] she was desperate for her healing and
[1:06:39] she didn't care how she had to get to
[1:06:41] him and how many people
[1:06:43] she had to wallow through and push aside
[1:06:45] hello
[1:06:46] get down there and just get through the
[1:06:48] crowd
[1:06:50] she was desperate
[1:06:56] remember this prophet makes a statement
[1:06:58] i may read it yet
[1:06:59] he says a desperate soul can always
[1:07:02] touch the heart of god isn't that
[1:07:06] something that
[1:07:07] even jesus talked about that widow or
[1:07:09] that widow woman i believe it was
[1:07:11] that went to the judge and said man i
[1:07:13] want some vengeance for this i want some
[1:07:14] recompense but he wouldn't listen i
[1:07:16] don't forget a man but because this
[1:07:18] woman continuously
[1:07:20] bombards me i'm gonna give her what she
[1:07:21] wants
[1:07:23] isn't it something that even jesus used
[1:07:25] that illustration
[1:07:26] if you want something from god amen you
[1:07:29] better be desperate for it
[1:07:33] he wants to know that you wondered about
[1:07:35] everything
[1:07:40] amen
[1:07:42] brother baptist he says not he that
[1:07:43] knocks
[1:07:45] no he said he didn't knock us
[1:07:49] hello hello
[1:07:56] knock it keep knocking
[1:08:00] amen somebody can open the door that's
[1:08:03] where it is with god he could
[1:08:04] open the door but you got to get
[1:08:06] desperate
[1:08:08] say well i'm just not desperate then get
[1:08:10] the love of god in your heart
[1:08:12] it'll bring faith in god it'll help you
[1:08:15] conquer every enemy that you've got
[1:08:17] it'll bring the goliath
[1:08:18] down it'll
[1:08:21] stop the mouse of lions
[1:08:25] but you gotta have the love of god in
[1:08:27] your heart
[1:08:29] without that
[1:08:32] well well another day

[1:08:51] internet and this is one time
[1:08:52] i'm actually going to hold off i don't
[1:08:55] usually do that brother right
[1:08:57] but i don't offend anybody but listen
[1:09:00] how many believes
[1:09:02] we need desperation we need the love of
[1:09:04] god
[1:09:05] that makes us do things
[1:09:08] i was driving down the road today and
[1:09:12] while i was driving down the road
[1:09:16] that desperation hit me again because i
[1:09:18] was praying what do you want me to do
[1:09:19] and
[1:09:20] our lord brother thought hey about a
[1:09:22] week ago he thought about that and
[1:09:23] he began to pour things out and
[1:09:27] little elena she was with us

[1:09:55] oh really what is it it's desperation
[1:09:59] and faith and as we were driving down

[1:11:27] you're nobody to begin with but he's
[1:11:28] everything isn't that right
[1:11:30] david didn't have no inferior for
[1:11:32] complex just because he was short and
[1:11:33] little

[1:12:17] he says get all of this off of me i
[1:12:19] i've been proven this you know i don't
[1:12:23] know that this works
[1:12:27] hallelujah how many knows that if you
[1:12:30] don't know that it works you probably
[1:12:32] won't try it
[1:12:34] i'll tell you what if you don't know
[1:12:35] what it's like to trust god in
[1:12:37] tribulation
[1:12:38] then you probably haven't had it happen
[1:12:39] to you but if you have trusted god and
[1:12:42] he's taking you through this and he's
[1:12:43] taking you through that
[1:12:45] it gives you the faith to know that he's
[1:12:46] gonna take you through the next wall
[1:12:50] he's going to take you through the next
[1:12:51] seat
[1:12:53] he's going to help you conquer your next
[1:12:55] problem
[1:12:57] and you learn to put your trust in the
[1:12:58] lord
[1:13:00] makes you vigilant be vigilant for your
[1:13:03] adversary
[1:13:05] the devil is vigilant

[1:13:12] seeking whom he may devour
[1:13:16] wrote a few other things down makes you
[1:13:18] brave
[1:13:21] amen perseverance or
[1:13:24] long suffering it won't be real long
[1:13:28] real
[1:13:28] short anymore you'll have love
[1:13:33] long suffering
[1:13:36] huh you can't wear that guy out
[1:13:40] huh long suffering it makes you
[1:13:44] strength is long suffering all right
[1:13:47] but then let's talk about the other
[1:13:49] while it puts hair on your chest
[1:13:51] it makes a man out of you

[1:15:32] never be able to do anything unless you
[1:15:33] beloved people
[1:15:34] and put themselves in shoes and let me
[1:15:37] tell you if you got the holy ghost
[1:15:38] somebody has said something this side or
[1:15:40] the other you try to see where they come
[1:15:42] from and what they're saying
[1:15:44] hello how many knows we don't have a
[1:15:45] whole lot of that going on in the world
[1:15:47] people don't try to understand what each
[1:15:49] others are saying
[1:15:51] no but the holy ghost makes you try to
[1:15:53] understand what oh so you're saying this
[1:15:56] most of the time if we are talking to
[1:15:57] somebody i disagree but
[1:15:59] no no it's like this
[1:16:03] you're way wrong you know that's not
[1:16:06] holy ghost
[1:16:07] holy ghost gives you understanding
[1:16:11] and another thing it does it makes you
[1:16:14] meek and that right
[1:16:18] meek kind the bible says be
[1:16:22] kindly affectionate one to another
[1:16:26] how many beliefs we need kind affections
[1:16:29] kind
[1:16:30] affections one two another
[1:16:35] let me tell you this again i truly
[1:16:37] believe we need it i need it we all
[1:16:39] need this more than what we have and
[1:16:42] that is to be kindly affectionate
[1:16:44] one to another amen and i always like
[1:16:48] this because well don't just put it on
[1:16:50] no give more of the love of god and
[1:16:53] that's what it'll do for you
[1:16:55] make you considerate of other people
[1:16:59] love other people amen
[1:17:05] praise the lord
[1:17:11] so he says the only way that you can
[1:17:13] have faith is to have
[1:17:14] love first because after all
[1:17:17] faith is love's incentive
[1:17:20] incentive he says that's exactly what
[1:17:23] faith is
[1:17:24] it's an incentive to love
[1:17:27] comes off of it like a spin-off if you
[1:17:30] don't have love
[1:17:31] you can't have faith amen
[1:17:35] another one last quote here brother
[1:17:37] brahm says this way on this one anyway
[1:17:42] we know that it is true that god will
[1:17:45] meet a desperate soul how many knows he
[1:17:49] did jacob
[1:17:51] jacob was a desperate soul
[1:17:54] i've got to read this other one yet here
[1:17:57] it's it's a
[1:17:58] when i heard it i i had to print it out
[1:18:01] because i listened to desperation this
[1:18:03] afternoon i heard something and it's
[1:18:05] it's a profound statement
[1:18:08] he'll meet a desperate soul now we all
[1:18:11] know that but it usually takes something
[1:18:12] to drive us into that
[1:18:14] despair to desperation it takes
[1:18:16] something to do it
[1:18:17] he says jacob now no jacob in
[1:18:19] desperation said you know
[1:18:22] he says i may have filled you you're
[1:18:24] here with me but i'm not going to let
[1:18:25] you go
[1:18:27] somebody see sees it fine just a little
[1:18:29] sensation they get up and jump them down
[1:18:31] up and down run the hall and say well i
[1:18:33] got it i got no not jacob
[1:18:35] jacob stayed there until something
[1:18:38] happened many know jacob got into
[1:18:40] desperation because esau was coming to
[1:18:42] meet him with 400 armed men
[1:18:46] because of how he had swindled him he
[1:18:48] wasn't too happy with him
[1:18:51] and jacob was scared to death when god
[1:18:54] met
[1:18:55] jacob on the backside of the desert amen
[1:18:57] he knew he had him and it says that he
[1:18:59] wrestled with the angel of the lord
[1:19:01] i believe that's god's angel the angel
[1:19:04] of god wrestled with god
[1:19:06] hello all night long did he talk about a
[1:19:09] long wrestling match he wouldn't let him
[1:19:11] go
[1:19:12] i don't know i had hold of him but he
[1:19:13] had a hold of him
[1:19:15] he wouldn't let him go remember in the
[1:19:17] morning the bible says he said let me go
[1:19:18] i gotta go it's morning
[1:19:20] no i let you go
[1:19:24] god loves again he loves people of this
[1:19:28] nature and of this character amen jacob
[1:19:31] stayed there until something happened
[1:19:32] that made him
[1:19:34] walk different
[1:19:37] how many believes that could happen made
[1:19:40] him a different person
[1:19:41] because that he stayed until it happened
[1:19:44] the bible said
[1:19:45] it said that he held until he
[1:19:48] prevailed huh
[1:19:53] until he prevailed until that something
[1:19:56] happened
[1:19:57] the bible said now listen how can
[1:20:00] how can a man prevail over
[1:20:04] god but you can do it
[1:20:10] did you hear me say that that's what he
[1:20:12] said but you can do it
[1:20:15] again he says you can do it a man
[1:20:18] can prevail over god
[1:20:24] profound what that's what he said
[1:20:29] jacob did he wouldn't let him go
[1:20:33] how about the woman that
[1:20:37] had a problem i think it was her
[1:20:38] daughter and she came up to jesus and
[1:20:41] she wanted healing and he wouldn't even
[1:20:42] answer it
[1:20:43] wouldn't even answer they kept going and
[1:20:46] he said what are you going to do with
[1:20:47] this woman tell her to leave us or
[1:20:48] whatever and he says it's not meat
[1:20:50] to give the children spread to dogs
[1:20:53] huh tried to completely discourage her
[1:20:57] but a man said he called her a no most
[1:21:00] people
[1:21:00] would say he just caught i know it was
[1:21:03] around the clock i know it was in the
[1:21:04] in a what do you call them
[1:21:08] i don't forget just what it's called but
[1:21:11] in another way
[1:21:12] of telling you that you're a dog
[1:21:15] not not me to give the children's bed to
[1:21:17] gentiles or gentile dogs because she's a
[1:21:19] gentile
[1:21:21] and the woman prevailed and she had
[1:21:24] faith she had desperate she wouldn't let
[1:21:26] go
[1:21:27] what did she say she says yes lord
[1:21:31] she acknowledged you're right that's
[1:21:34] right

[1:21:37] children's brand say here's susie

[1:21:41] it to the dogs

[1:21:52] little bit and she kind of dropped a big
