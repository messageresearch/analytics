[2:43] unto him
[2:48] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[2:50] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[2:56] blessed are the meek for they shall
[2:58] inherit the earth
[3:05] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[3:07] obtain mercy
[3:13] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[3:15] shall be called the children of god
[3:24] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[3:26] and persecute you
[3:27] and say shall and shall say all manner
[3:30] of evil against you
[3:31] falsely for my sake
[3:43] ye are the salt of the earth but if the
[3:45] salt has lost its savior
[3:47] wherewith shall be salted it is
[3:49] thenceforth good
[3:50] for nothing but to be cast out and to be
[3:53] trodden underfoot of men
[4:01] neither do men light a candle and put it
[4:03] under a bushel
[4:04] but on a candlestick and it giveth light

[36:08] jesus name
[36:10] amen and amen may god bless this reading
[36:13] of his word
[36:14] turn your bibles if you will
[36:21] to matthew
[36:26] matthew 13.
[36:47] matthew 13 and verse
[36:52] 40
[36:55] four we'll begin with 44.
[36:59] the kingdom of heaven is like unto
[37:02] treasure hidden in a field the which
[37:05] when a man had found he
[37:07] hideth and for joy thereof goeth
[37:10] and selleth all that he hath and buyeth
[37:14] that field again the kingdom of heaven
[37:17] is like unto a
[37:18] merchant merchant man seeking goodly
[37:21] pearls
[37:23] who when he found the pearl of great
[37:25] price went and sold all that he had
[37:27] and bought it over in
[37:31] matthew let's go to
[37:34] chapter 10
[37:48] matthew chapter 10
[37:54] and verse 29
[37:58] actually yeah that'll be fine
[38:01] 29 are not two sparrows sold for a
[38:04] farthing
[38:06] and one of them shall not fall on the
[38:08] ground
[38:09] without your father but the very hairs
[38:12] of your head are all numbered
[38:14] fear ye not therefore for ye are of more
[38:16] value than many sparrows
[38:23] and over in matthew 6
[38:29] matthew 6
[38:36] verse 19 lay not up for yourselves
[38:40] treasures upon earth where moth
[38:44] moth and rust that's corrupt and where
[38:47] thieves
[38:48] break through and steal but lay up for
[38:50] yourselves
[38:51] treasure in heaven where neither moth
[38:54] nor
[38:55] rust does corrupt and where thieves do
[38:58] not break through
[38:59] nor steal for where your treasure is
[39:01] there will your heart
[39:02] be also may god add his blessings to
[39:05] reading the words you can be seated
[39:08] this morning i want to take some of the
[39:12] simplest
[39:13] things that we already know and perhaps
[39:15] just look at it a little bit different
[39:18] with the help of the lord this morning
[39:20] amen even the scriptures that we've read
[39:23] and this one this one word
[39:26] is what came to my heart and mind when i
[39:28] began to study for a message
[39:31] and that is found in the 10th chapter
[39:34] again
[39:36] in verse 31.
[39:39] he says fear ye not therefore for ye are
[39:42] of more value
[39:43] than many sparrows and i want to talk
[39:47] about
[39:47] value just that word value
[39:51] is that all right let's talk about value
[39:55] amen and so as i began to think about
[39:58] that i
[39:59] began to think about what jesus talked
[40:01] about before he talked about
[40:02] value and then i began to think about
[40:06] what he said about
[40:07] how the actual even the kingdom of god
[40:12] is about like or is it he took for an
[40:14] example of course and we
[40:16] know that there's many different
[40:17] examples but the one example that he
[40:19] took
[40:20] was of a merchant man all right a
[40:23] businessman
[40:25] isn't that right looking for something
[40:27] of
[40:28] value right because i don't know about
[40:30] you but i think every one of us that
[40:32] when we go shopping
[40:34] what do we look for value right
[40:37] something that is uh you know that's
[40:40] when you pay your money you know because
[40:42] all of us no doubt have been ripped off
[40:45] right we've just been you know we
[40:47] realized we buy some sometimes you
[40:49] probably are
[40:50] maybe online or whatever it might be and
[40:52] when you get it you're like man
[40:53] i paid good money this is not worth it
[40:57] right it wasn't didn't have the value
[40:59] that you thought that it did
[41:01] and so all of us as human beings if we
[41:03] lived any amount of time and i think
[41:05] that the older that you get
[41:06] you are more careful before you buy
[41:09] something isn't that right
[41:10] you want to look things over you want to
[41:12] check it out good isn't that right
[41:14] you take the extra time to make sure
[41:16] that you're getting your value
[41:18] and i believe that's what jesus was
[41:20] saying here that the kingdom of heaven
[41:22] is kind of like that
[41:23] in this world a smart man looks for
[41:26] value amen
[41:27] but abandoned he preached on something
[41:29] called investments isn't that right that
[41:31] before
[41:31] people going investing things you know
[41:33] they check things out
[41:35] you don't want no fly by night you know
[41:37] thing that just overnight and
[41:39] get rich quick scheme he says most of
[41:41] the times those
[41:42] don't pan out to be what they're uh
[41:45] cracked up to be isn't that right so
[41:47] even in there it talks about how that is
[41:49] in many different places god talked
[41:51] about value he talked about trading he
[41:53] talked about
[41:54] having given up been given a talent and
[41:56] then you go and multiply with that
[41:58] talent and so forth and
[42:00] you know and if you don't use what you
[42:01] got and come back and and you bury it or
[42:04] whatever you know you'll be cast out as
[42:06] an unprofitable servant
[42:08] but i want to take this thought with
[42:09] just for a little bit for the help of
[42:10] the lord about value and what is real
[42:12] value
[42:14] amen what real value is
[42:17] amen and so we looked at that and see
[42:21] now that jesus said here
[42:22] he said you know that uh like a merchant
[42:25] man going and what does he do when he
[42:27] finds that
[42:29] pearl of great price and you know a lot
[42:31] of people i want to tell you a lot of
[42:32] people you know
[42:33] people go to church for a lot of
[42:34] different reasons people are christians
[42:36] for
[42:37] a lot of different reasons amen a lot of
[42:39] times those reasons are wrong
[42:42] all right and i have concluded this one
[42:44] thing and that is there's uh
[42:46] uh really two different kinds of
[42:48] believers that mattered a real genuine
[42:50] believer
[42:51] amen his true value is in jesus christ
[42:54] and almighty god
[42:56] and in the things that are not seen all
[42:58] right
[42:59] and then there's so many christians that
[43:01] perhaps go to
[43:02] church and you know they're just trying
[43:04] to appease their soul because
[43:06] maybe they're afraid of what the
[43:08] afterlife is or whatever it might be but
[43:10] they go for another reason and they
[43:12] might say that they have their eyes set
[43:14] on christ and
[43:15] and on on the true value of life but
[43:18] they they may
[43:19] come to find out they really don't amen
[43:22] because the bible talks about he says
[43:23] wherever your heart is
[43:25] wherever your treasure is that's where
[43:28] your heart
[43:28] is going to be also amen where
[43:32] whatever you value that's what you're
[43:34] going to think about
[43:35] amen watch what constantly comes out of
[43:38] a person's mouth and you'll find
[43:40] out where their value is what they
[43:42] really think where their real
[43:44] treasure is and what what what it really
[43:47] means to them amen
[43:48] you talk about a fisherman that's a true
[43:50] fisherman he's going to talk to you
[43:52] about how big a bass he caught and
[43:54] and this that or the other or a hunter
[43:56] or whatever it might be but you take a
[43:58] christian
[43:59] amen like the prophet said you know and
[44:01] he's interested in talking about
[44:03] christ amen that's the top priority
[44:06] amen amen i just appreciate the lord
[44:10] revealing a couple of things to me this
[44:12] weekend
[44:12] and showing me a couple things and i
[44:14] just want to share that lord but i
[44:16] looked at that
[44:16] and it says it talks about value first
[44:19] of all i want to talk about
[44:20] value and then i want to talk about the
[44:23] how that the true valuable things
[44:25] it meant anything that is truly valuable
[44:29] is something that you can't see and then
[44:32] we want to talk about two or three
[44:33] different things if the things that you
[44:35] can't see
[44:36] amen go through detail with those with
[44:38] the help of the lord amen
[44:39] but uh let me see here so jesus said
[44:43] here that you got to be careful about
[44:44] laying up treasures on the earth
[44:46] how many knows that a true christian
[44:48] according to 1st john 3 i believe it is
[44:50] he says
[44:51] he says that we ought to set your
[44:54] affections on things above
[44:56] and not on things beneath we as human
[45:00] beings everything
[45:01] everything that has to do with this
[45:03] flesh in this world
[45:05] amen has to do with the material things
[45:07] of this world
[45:08] amen and so a lot of times it has a big
[45:11] pull
[45:12] on us right it has a big pull on us
[45:15] because
[45:16] it affects our life here all right
[45:19] but we realize that all of this as it
[45:21] you know all of these things that we
[45:23] have here
[45:24] truly aren't valuable
[45:27] all right they're truly not they're not
[45:29] they're not real value at all
[45:30] anything that you can see so he says
[45:33] don't don't don't do that don't lay it
[45:35] up in the in the
[45:36] down here but lay it up lay up for
[45:38] yourselves
[45:39] treasures in heaven we're not you know
[45:42] because it doesn't matter
[45:43] i think in this world every one of us
[45:46] likes to have
[45:47] i like to have new stuff i like to have
[45:48] good stuff don't you
[45:50] but it doesn't matter how newest stuff
[45:52] you buy how good a stuff you buy
[45:54] it isn't very long till it's junk
[46:00] doesn't matter what it is it all wears
[46:02] out it all rusts out
[46:04] amen it all gets old no matter how good
[46:07] it is and it's the same way with your
[46:09] even your own body
[46:10] amen no matter if you're 20 years old
[46:12] and how strong you are
[46:13] eventually it's gonna turn gray
[46:17] eventually you're gonna lose your
[46:18] strength that you have and it's gonna
[46:20] get weaker and weaker it's gonna get old
[46:22] it's gonna wear out
[46:27] amen so the things of the earth the
[46:30] things of this world
[46:31] aren't really truly all right and guess
[46:34] what they're not even
[46:35] really real amen they're not really real
[46:38] how many knows but bam says you know he
[46:40] says you might say you've seen me but we
[46:42] realized that
[46:44] he said that i've never really seen you
[46:46] and you have never really seen me
[46:49] amen because the real valuable thing is
[46:52] on the inside the thing that you can't
[46:54] see this is just the house that we live
[46:56] in
[46:56] that has to be changed for some time all
[47:00] right but abandoned was up in
[47:01] canada i believe it was and he was
[47:03] preaching and i believe he had called
[47:05] out that soldiers so forth and
[47:07] yet discern uh the thoughts and tense of
[47:09] the heart to the people you know jesus
[47:11] christ did through him
[47:12] and the next day he was down by a
[47:14] merchant man somewhere
[47:15] amen and they had a television going i
[47:17] guess it was some kind of a television
[47:19] salesman or something
[47:20] but he got to talk in this man and this
[47:22] man said oh he
[47:24] says you ain't with this branham outfit
[47:26] down here are you
[47:27] and i said yes sir i am and he said oh
[47:30] he said what do you think about that guy
[47:32] i says well oh i don't know and he says
[47:35] well he says i'll tell you i think he's
[47:36] the biggest hypocrite that i ever seen
[47:39] i said you really do and yes i sure do
[47:42] he said the first thing he's got nothing
[47:44] but psychology
[47:46] and i said what uh were you there last
[47:49] night he said yeah
[47:51] and i said what
[47:54] that soldier they brought up there all
[47:56] crippled up and so forth oh he said that
[47:58] soldier
[47:59] could have walked anyhow if he just
[48:01] tried it hm
[48:02] and i says are you a christian he says
[48:04] oh no said i don't believe in none of
[48:06] that stuff
[48:07] and i said oh he said i'm a scientist
[48:10] he says he said and anything that cannot
[48:12] be
[48:14] scientifically proven it's
[48:17] absolutely an heir
[48:20] amen it's not real
[48:21] [Music]
[48:23] in other words it's really not worth
[48:25] nothing
[48:27] oh and i said uh-huh i said i hate to
[48:29] take the other side but i said i'm gonna
[48:32] tell you
[48:33] the real things that are things that
[48:35] cannot
[48:36] be scientifically proved
[48:40] praise the lord the real things are
[48:44] things that cannot be
[48:46] scientifically proven
[48:50] all right oh he says you're wrong that
[48:53] says all right i want to
[48:54] he said if it can't be scientifically
[48:56] proven then it's not real
[48:59] now i said well partner i believe that
[49:01] the things that are real
[49:03] cannot be scientifically proven
[49:07] and anything that's scientifically
[49:10] proven
[49:11] is not real
[49:16] amen
[49:20] oh my it's perishable brother branham's
[49:24] ass
[49:25] i mean believe that it's perish even
[49:27] heaven earth shall pass away
[49:29] it even gonna put everything that we see
[49:31] it's gonna perish
[49:32] it's gonna burn with fervent heat you
[49:36] know they can take you back
[49:37] they can take your body back to ashes
[49:40] and back to dust amen not real
[49:45] but he says anything like that is not
[49:46] real and he said oh
[49:48] he said i think you're wrong and i said
[49:51] i want to ask you one thing
[49:52] are you a married man he said sure got
[49:55] any children yes
[49:57] i said you love your wife he said yes
[49:58] sir and i said what is love
[50:01] i said scientifically show me what
[50:04] love is
[50:08] amen all right
[50:11] what is love all right
[50:14] show me what love is what's the
[50:16] difference about that woman
[50:18] than the other woman what's different
[50:20] about the children
[50:22] then these other children love you
[50:23] couldn't scientifically prove
[50:26] your love that you have for her it can't
[50:28] be scientifically
[50:30] proven that you even have a mind that's
[50:32] right
[50:33] and i thought i had the next page but i
[50:36] don't
[50:37] but it comes to find out this brother
[50:39] this man here
[50:41] brother branham finally comes down to
[50:42] telling this man that he's actually
[50:44] brother branham
[50:45] and brother and he says you know well i
[50:47] just called you a hypocrite to your face
[50:50] and brother brown says well that's the
[50:51] way to do it if you're going to say them
[50:54] tell it to my face you know but you know
[50:57] mother bantam the point that he was
[50:58] making here
[50:59] amen is that anything that is visible
[51:02] anything that is seen
[51:03] is not real
[51:06] how many knows that we get so excited
[51:09] about things that we can see
[51:11] feel here and so forth but you know
[51:14] anything that's not
[51:16] seeable is real and paul
[51:19] said it this way paul said in first
[51:21] corinthians
[51:23] he says for our light affliction which
[51:25] is but for a moment
[51:27] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[51:30] eternal weight of glory
[51:33] while we look not at the things which
[51:36] are seen but the things that are
[51:40] not seen for the things which are
[51:43] seen are temporal but the things which
[51:46] are not seen
[51:47] are eternal so even
[51:51] paul bears out that the things that you
[51:53] can see
[51:54] they're only temporary amen and the real
[51:58] things that are real good
[52:02] and that are real are things that you
[52:04] can't see
[52:06] praise the lord how many knows that one
[52:09] time that sometimes when you're
[52:10] worshiping
[52:11] amen or when you're praying amen
[52:13] sometimes you just
[52:14] close your eyes because why you're
[52:18] shutting off your contact with the world
[52:21] because when you look
[52:23] it has an effect everything has an
[52:24] effect on what you see
[52:27] remember somebody moving around it but
[52:28] when you close your eyes
[52:30] amen you begin to look at the unseen
[52:34] because how many knows that god you
[52:36] don't see
[52:37] god with your eyes
[52:41] praise be to god you can't see him with
[52:43] your eyes but he's there
[52:45] everything that's real in your life this
[52:48] morning
[52:49] it is by because of the things that you
[52:51] don't see
[52:53] praise the lord you know
[52:56] i might back up a little bit amen let me
[52:59] back up a little bit talk just a little
[53:01] bit more about
[53:02] uh this great treasure the most
[53:06] valuable things in the world
[53:09] the most valuable things in the world
[53:12] amen and we know of course how many
[53:14] knows that
[53:16] your life is worth
[53:20] how much
[53:24] you know people will play with their
[53:26] life am i right
[53:29] a lot of times people will risk their
[53:31] lives
[53:32] they don't realize that their life
[53:36] is worth ten thousand worlds now
[53:39] we put a price tag on it of ten thousand
[53:42] worlds but i'm going to give you my
[53:43] opinion of that
[53:45] i don't even believe that's a correct
[53:46] opinion a correct number because
[53:48] that's giving a way out their number
[53:52] that it's just hardly even imaginable
[53:54] for you and i
[53:55] is that right i mean what this world
[53:57] would be worth and then having 10
[53:59] 000 worlds that's just almost infinite
[54:02] so i can say this morning i believe that
[54:04] there's just really
[54:05] no telling how valuable your life really
[54:08] is
[54:11] is that right how many is that you know
[54:14] that's why we
[54:15] sometimes we take that for granted how
[54:16] many know we take everything else
[54:18] serious and don't realize sometimes
[54:20] that the most valuable thing that you
[54:23] have
[54:24] is your life
[54:29] amen how many believes that i don't know
[54:32] about you
[54:32] but i'm glad to be alive
[54:47] let's not be like that no i am glad to
[54:50] be alive
[54:51] i am glad that god chose me out of a
[54:54] million people
[54:55] to come from my mother's womb he chose
[54:59] me to have and to come into this world
[55:03] thank you lord not right
[55:06] but now we know that that life was
[55:08] granted you it was predestinated by god
[55:11] you know the bible says that this life
[55:14] that we now have
[55:15] it was born in sin shape and iniquity
[55:17] come into this world speaking lies
[55:20] and if you only have this life you are
[55:22] going to lose your life
[55:26] how many knows that there has to be a
[55:28] preservative to this life
[55:31] amen there have to be a way to preserve
[55:35] your life because if you just live this
[55:38] life out
[55:39] as a sinful human being you're going to
[55:42] lose it
[55:42] even jesus said that he that saves his
[55:44] life will
[55:46] lose his life
[55:52] amen so we find out that one of the
[55:56] greatest
[55:58] the or should we say the greatest the
[56:01] greatest thing
[56:02] upon the face of the earth is the means
[56:05] by which you are
[56:06] able to preserve your life whatever
[56:10] that means is is the greatest value
[56:13] in the world
[56:18] the means of preserving your life
[56:23] amen aaron what is it
[56:27] can you tell me what that is
[56:31] stephen what is the means
[56:34] that we have of preserving our life
[56:44] close yes serving the lord jesus is
[56:47] the only preservative who knows he that
[56:50] hath the son hath
[56:51] life he that hath not the son has not
[56:53] life
[56:54] he is what preserved it is that right
[56:59] jesus christ of course yeah christ
[57:02] is what preserves our life
[57:06] amen now how many knows that in order
[57:10] to purchase in order to purchase
[57:13] the preservative of your life
[57:18] there has to be a price paid
[57:24] amen jesus said it had to
[57:28] let me see if i can find it there
[57:32] one place there right after he said ye
[57:35] are of more
[57:36] value than many sparrows amen many
[57:40] worlds
[57:42] and whosoever therefore shall confess me
[57:44] before men
[57:45] him will i confess before my father
[57:47] which is in heaven
[57:48] whosoever will deny me before man him
[57:50] will i deny him
[57:51] from my father which is in heaven now i
[57:53] want to go down to here
[57:55] amen in verse 38 he says
[57:58] that he now let's go back up a little
[58:00] bit he that loveth
[58:02] father or mother more than me is not
[58:06] worthy of me
[58:08] now how many knows oh my and he that
[58:10] love a
[58:11] son or daughter more than me is not
[58:13] worthy of me
[58:15] can we say or husband or wife
[58:18] or job or church even brother branham
[58:22] says
[58:23] you can't love your church if your
[58:25] church is wrong and
[58:26] you're not willing to forsake your
[58:28] church for the sake of christ you aren't
[58:30] worthy of this great pearl
[58:33] [Music]
[58:34] amen i'll tell you what it takes the
[58:36] love of god in your heart
[58:38] he says i'll tell you what you gotta
[58:39] love this pearl amen right here
[58:42] more than any you gotta value me over
[58:45] your hood but over your wife
[58:47] you gotta value me over anything else
[58:51] including your own life
[58:55] huh you gotta value him more
[59:00] than your own life let me tell you this
[59:03] you'll
[59:03] never be a proper christian
[59:07] you'll never be and live a proper
[59:09] christian life
[59:11] until you completely die to yourself
[59:14] and let christ rule in your heart
[59:18] it'll always be you'll always have way
[59:21] terrible glitches
[59:24] it'll be a deformed stalk
[59:27] a deformed christian until christ has
[59:30] supreme control
[59:32] of your life he said if
[59:36] anybody if you value anything else more
[59:39] than me
[59:40] you're not worthy of this preservative
[59:44] if you preserve your life here and you
[59:47] want to live your life
[59:48] he said you're going to lose it but if
[59:51] you will lose your life for
[59:54] my sake you will preserve it
[59:57] [Music]
[59:58] in other words how many did he take to
[1:00:00] dying of ourself
[1:00:02] to let christ rule and become top
[1:00:05] priority in our hearts and souls
[1:00:09] that's the only way that is going to
[1:00:11] work
[1:00:12] and there's so many let me tell you
[1:00:14] there's so many that
[1:00:15] say and claim to be serving god but
[1:00:18] they're really serving their self
[1:00:22] they're really still living their own
[1:00:25] life thinking their own thoughts
[1:00:28] still have worldly ambitions a real true
[1:00:32] christian let me make this clear
[1:00:33] a real true christian's ambitions
[1:00:37] are not on the things of this world
[1:00:39] their ambitions are for the other world
[1:00:43] not that you don't take care of things
[1:00:45] here in progress and all that
[1:00:47] but your heart is over there
[1:00:50] your heart looks to the things that are
[1:00:53] not seen
[1:00:54] not at the things that are seen that's
[1:00:56] where your desires are
[1:00:58] that's where your values are
[1:01:01] [Music]
[1:01:06] is that all right it's a little
[1:01:08] different way of looking at it but the
[1:01:10] lord just showed me that
[1:01:12] because jesus believes in value
[1:01:16] amen trade in me your life and i'll give
[1:01:19] you a life
[1:01:20] way better than what you got
[1:01:26] what a deal everybody likes a good deal
[1:01:30] [Applause]
[1:01:31] jesus gave humanity a great deal
[1:01:35] it's a good deal trade in your life
[1:01:39] you can have mine keep your life and
[1:01:42] you'll lose it
[1:01:44] simple deal do you want this
[1:01:46] preservative do you want this great
[1:01:48] value
[1:01:50] or don't you want this value amen
[1:01:55] praise the lord
[1:01:58] that's right more than me son or
[1:02:00] daughter more than me is not worthy of
[1:02:03] me
[1:02:03] that taketh not his cause and followed
[1:02:06] after me
[1:02:07] is not worthy of me
[1:02:11] he that findeth his life shall lose it
[1:02:14] and he that loses his life for my sake
[1:02:17] shall
[1:02:17] find it praise be to god
[1:02:21] hallelujah amen how many know that even
[1:02:25] your soul
[1:02:26] is spiritual it's not natural it's
[1:02:30] unseen
[1:02:32] your still soul still lives even after
[1:02:34] your body dies
[1:02:35] even it is spiritual
[1:02:38] amen all these temporal things that
[1:02:41] really
[1:02:42] don't hold any value
[1:02:49] what did jesus say he said what will a
[1:02:51] man
[1:02:52] give in exchange for his soul
[1:02:56] what will he do if he gains the whole
[1:02:59] world
[1:03:00] but if he loses his soul he has lost
[1:03:03] everything he has gained absolutely
[1:03:06] nothing
[1:03:09] even less than nothing amen
[1:03:12] why because you got to pay for all of
[1:03:14] that
[1:03:16] amen what will a man give
[1:03:19] in exchange for his soul the most
[1:03:21] valuable thing that we have is of course
[1:03:22] your life
[1:03:23] and jesus christ the number two thing i
[1:03:26] want to say
[1:03:26] is the means by which we preserve our
[1:03:29] life and that is jesus christ
[1:03:32] is the most valuable that's true value
[1:03:36] amen i sound like paul harvey don't i
[1:03:42] how many heard paul harvey i remember
[1:03:44] mixing mud up in ohio
[1:03:46] cold winters and having a wheelbarrow
[1:03:48] mud and
[1:03:49] my boss they like paul harvey and every
[1:03:51] news time 12 o'clock they wouldn't miss
[1:03:53] paul harvey and now you know the rest of
[1:03:56] the story
[1:03:57] is that him that's way back in my mind
[1:04:00] somewhere i didn't even think about it
[1:04:01] till just
[1:04:02] then but yeah you know the rest of the
[1:04:04] story that's true value
[1:04:06] he always promoted that hardware true
[1:04:09] value hardware you know
[1:04:12] i thought i'll say what true value is
[1:04:15] the lord jesus christ
[1:04:16] that's true value amen
[1:04:21] how many loves him this morning i say
[1:04:23] thank god for all the things he's done
[1:04:25] you know i think that's so appropriate
[1:04:27] for us to worship the lord and say thank
[1:04:28] you for all that you've done for us
[1:04:30] because you don't realize folks how how
[1:04:33] valuable
[1:04:34] that the lord jesus christ is and the
[1:04:36] things that are not seen
[1:04:38] amen so let me go into the second phase
[1:04:41] if i can but
[1:04:43] i want to read you another fairy tale
[1:04:46] and kids are y'all ready for a fairy

[1:05:02] and in one way that you are spiritually
[1:05:04] speaking that's right
[1:05:06] the lord has put your souls into my care
[1:05:08] because you come and listen to me
[1:05:10] and you believe me and in one sense of
[1:05:12] the word you are my sons and daughters
[1:05:13] that's right and always remember keeping
[1:05:16] the commandments of god is a great thing
[1:05:18] being raised in a good home is a
[1:05:20] heritage from god
[1:05:22] and being a fine kids with personalities

[1:05:28] wonderful
[1:05:29] to even live in this free land
[1:05:32] we've got many things to be thankful for
[1:05:35] and there's one thing that
[1:05:36] you just don't inherit he says you've
[1:05:39] got to accept
[1:05:40] it and that's eternal life and you're
[1:05:43] and you'll only do it do that by
[1:05:45] following jesus and being
[1:05:47] born again having an experience don't
[1:05:50] neglect that
[1:05:51] he says a little story one time i heard
[1:05:53] a man say
[1:05:54] he was poor how many of us were all
[1:05:58] born poor amen
[1:06:01] he always wanted it's a little fairy
[1:06:03] story like

[1:06:13] had answered him and said
[1:06:14] you've been poor all your life and he
[1:06:17] says
[1:06:18] now ask what you will and it will be
[1:06:21] given to you

[1:06:51] what you willing to be given to he said
[1:06:53] yet
[1:06:54] that yonder mountain would open up and i
[1:06:57] could go there in and find
[1:06:58] gold in that mountain he says well
[1:07:01] you'll have to take me wherever you go
[1:07:03] see you'll have to take me with you so
[1:07:05] wherever i am
[1:07:06] then ask what you will how many beliefs
[1:07:09] unless without jesus he says without me
[1:07:12] you can do nothing somebody believes
[1:07:15] that if you're
[1:07:15] ever going to be blessed it'll be
[1:07:17] because you take jesus
[1:07:18] wherever you go always take him with you
[1:07:22] and ask what you will and i'll tell you
[1:07:25] you will find
[1:07:26] the true treasures of life
[1:07:29] how maybe there's treasures in that
[1:07:31] mountain there's
[1:07:33] treasures in christ oh my just can't
[1:07:36] imagine
[1:07:38] amen praise the lord you want to stop
[1:07:41] the son
[1:07:42] joshua did you want to slay giants david
[1:07:45] did
[1:07:46] amen you want to slay a thousand
[1:07:49] philistines
[1:07:50] devils amen samson did nothing was
[1:07:53] impossible even back then
[1:07:55] nothing was impossible and nothing is
[1:07:58] impossible with us
[1:07:59] as long as you're in christ
[1:08:03] all right but you got to take me with
[1:08:04] you he walked up to the mountain and the
[1:08:06] mountain opened up he went in and the
[1:08:08] shells was full of gold
[1:08:10] and diamonds and as the little fairy
[1:08:13] story goes he laid the flower down on a
[1:08:16] table or a rock
[1:08:17] and he run and he grabbed the big gym
[1:08:19] and he said i must go show this to my
[1:08:20] friends and how rich i am i'll be
[1:08:23] i have everything now i'ma show this so
[1:08:24] the flowers spoke up and said
[1:08:26] you've forgotten the main thing so he
[1:08:29] runs back and picks up
[1:08:30] a set well maybe i'll get a piece of
[1:08:32] gold i'll get a piece of silver
[1:08:34] and i'll hurry i got to go tell how rich
[1:08:36] i am or while i what i've got
[1:08:38] and he went to the door and flower said
[1:08:39] but you forgot the main thing
[1:08:41] so he runs back again he says in here
[1:08:44] are all kinds of materials so he picked
[1:08:46] up a stone
[1:08:47] he says i'll take the stone and show the
[1:08:49] people what kind of stone this
[1:08:50] mountain's made up
[1:08:51] so i can find my way back again see and
[1:08:54] he started out the door to flowers that
[1:08:56] it's the final time
[1:08:57] you have forgot the main thing oh he
[1:08:59] said shut up
[1:09:01] see he didn't want to hear no more he
[1:09:03] forgot the main thing
[1:09:04] and he ran out the door and when he did
[1:09:06] the door closed behind him with the
[1:09:08] flower on the inside
[1:09:10] and the main thing was the flower see
[1:09:12] the main thing
[1:09:13] is the flower honey believes the lord
[1:09:16] has been good to us lord is good
[1:09:18] he give you breath he'll give you a life
[1:09:20] he gives you he gives you everything
[1:09:21] that you have
[1:09:23] you wouldn't be here without him but
[1:09:25] sometimes we have a tendency
[1:09:27] to forget the main faith
[1:09:30] praise the lord how many knows the main
[1:09:33] thing is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:36] it is having christ in your heart on a
[1:09:39] daily basis
[1:09:40] that's the main thing having the fire of
[1:09:44] the
[1:09:45] holy spirit burning in your soul
[1:09:49] daily amen not just revival now and then
[1:09:52] but to be in a constant fire burning for
[1:09:55] the lord
[1:09:56] that's the main thing don't get so
[1:09:58] caught up with everything that god gives
[1:10:00] you
[1:10:01] that you forget the main thing
[1:10:05] he is worthy of praise and honor and
[1:10:08] glory and thanks
[1:10:10] and constant worship
[1:10:13] but we get so busy about the gold and
[1:10:15] the silver and the stones and everything
[1:10:17] else that god has made
[1:10:19] we forgot the flower we've got him
[1:10:22] amen praise the lord
[1:10:26] oh my so let's not forget the main thing
[1:10:30] is him okay
[1:10:33] let's talk about something else let's
[1:10:36] talk about some other real
[1:10:37] valuable things
[1:10:40] in our life most valuable things
[1:10:44] are things that are not seen amen
[1:10:48] all right
[1:10:52] we know over in hebrews
[1:10:55] it says that faith
[1:10:59] is the substance of the things hoped for
[1:11:05] it is the evidence of things not seen
[1:11:11] i mean those a lot of people have
[1:11:12] problems with faith unbelievers
[1:11:13] especially
[1:11:14] they gotta they have a problem with
[1:11:16] faith
[1:11:18] they want something that they can either
[1:11:21] do themselves or that they can see
[1:11:23] or they won't believe it unless they can
[1:11:25] see it right
[1:11:27] you know that's not the way it is with a
[1:11:29] christian
[1:11:34] oh my i suppose i should go back a
[1:11:37] little bit
[1:11:38] i'm going to go back a little bit and
[1:11:39] talk about even more
[1:11:41] pressure things because faith is
[1:11:43] something that's a little further down
[1:11:45] the line
[1:11:47] one of the greatest one of the greatest
[1:11:51] treasures one of the greatest values
[1:11:55] that we have today is grace
[1:11:59] god's grace
[1:12:02] because we don't be done without his
[1:12:04] grace
[1:12:06] and his forgiveness i want to talk about
[1:12:09] this forgiveness a little bit
[1:12:13] and i want to say forgive me
[1:12:17] but i want to say that god can't just
[1:12:19] forgive you
[1:12:24] huh god can't just forgive you
[1:12:27] all right and i hope i'm not out of line
[1:12:31] god can't just forgive you no he can't
[1:12:32] just forgive you because
[1:12:37] we know the bible says that without the
[1:12:39] shedding of blood
[1:12:41] there is no remission of sins
[1:12:44] huh so there has to be
[1:12:48] a justification for your sin huh
[1:12:51] god has to make a way that he can
[1:12:53] forgive you
[1:12:55] right because guess what how many knows
[1:12:58] under the old testament
[1:12:59] on the bulls and goats
[1:13:02] those people were what forgiven right
[1:13:05] but not justified
[1:13:08] and they were forgiven and the brother
[1:13:10] bam says that he just covered
[1:13:12] their sins the beloved bulls go it only
[1:13:15] covered it
[1:13:16] it did not remit it
[1:13:19] and what is it they could never go into
[1:13:21] paradise
[1:13:22] under the covering of bloods or goats
[1:13:24] isn't that right they could never go out
[1:13:26] of that place they could never ought to
[1:13:28] leave out of that place that they were
[1:13:31] until after calvary
[1:13:34] isn't that right because god's not going
[1:13:36] to take anything sinful
[1:13:38] or anything wrong into heaven how many
[1:13:40] knows remembers this statement
[1:13:42] that all sin has to be paid for
[1:13:47] not just forgiven but paid for
[1:13:51] all right because god's not an unjust
[1:13:53] god god's a just god
[1:13:55] if he forgives you he's forgiving you
[1:13:58] because he's paying for what you did
[1:14:02] all right
[1:14:06] that's right so without the shedding of
[1:14:07] blood there is no forgiveness there is
[1:14:09] no remission outside of the shedding of
[1:14:11] the blood
[1:14:12] that's why a substitute had to give his
[1:14:14] life
[1:14:15] for god not to kill adam and eve he
[1:14:18] accepted a substitute of a
[1:14:19] sheep and the lamb except that and that
[1:14:22] covered
[1:14:23] it but it didn't remit it i mean it
[1:14:25] believes that we have remissions of sins
[1:14:28] now grace amen made a way
[1:14:32] for us to be forgiven
[1:14:37] amen aren't you glad for that it
[1:14:39] provided
[1:14:40] a way for us to be forgiven and that all
[1:14:43] ties back to calgary
[1:14:47] oh precious is the flow that makes me
[1:14:50] white as no
[1:14:51] no other fountain i know nothing but the
[1:14:54] blood of jesus i love that song maybe we
[1:14:56] can sing
[1:14:57] nothing but the blood nothing but the
[1:14:58] blood we always look back to the blood
[1:15:00] because it did everything that we needed
[1:15:03] it provided for us
[1:15:05] they couldn't go to heaven they couldn't
[1:15:07] just go up there amen until their sins
[1:15:09] were remitted
[1:15:10] until they were gone and the real price
[1:15:13] had been paid for them
[1:15:15] that price had to be paid amen
[1:15:19] and jesus christ paid that price
[1:15:23] the brother says all sin has to be paid
[1:15:25] for
[1:15:27] amen not believe that without the
[1:15:29] remissions there
[1:15:30] is no forgiveness there is no remitting
[1:15:32] of sins
[1:15:34] amen so now we see grace providing
[1:15:37] jesus christ providing a lamb
[1:15:40] so that we can be forgiven i'm so aren't
[1:15:43] you thankful for forgiveness
[1:15:45] forgiveness through faith in jesus
[1:15:48] christ the lord
[1:15:50] that's the only way there is any
[1:15:51] permission there's only forgiveness
[1:15:53] through faith in jesus christ faith in
[1:15:56] what christ did for you
[1:15:58] and for what he did on calvary because
[1:16:01] i'll tell you
[1:16:01] every one of us oh what do you think
[1:16:04] about it that we were supposed to die
[1:16:06] we were supposed to be separated from
[1:16:08] god amen we were supposed to pay the
[1:16:10] price
[1:16:11] that he paid but he paid the price for
[1:16:13] you and i
[1:16:17] now he can forgive you you can either
[1:16:20] accept that forgiveness how many knows
[1:16:22] you can accept that forgiveness he's
[1:16:24] already spoken to forgiveness
[1:16:26] he died for the sins of the whole world
[1:16:29] but a pardon is not a pardon
[1:16:31] unless it's received many believes you
[1:16:34] have to accept
[1:16:35] that he forgives you amen
[1:16:40] amen you accept that he forgives you of
[1:16:43] your sins
[1:16:43] he took your sin upon him upon himself
[1:16:47] at calvary everyone here since why do
[1:16:50] you think that when brother branham seen
[1:16:51] that blood
[1:16:52] and when he seen his scenes coming up
[1:16:54] against that blood
[1:16:55] every time he would every time his sins
[1:16:58] would hit jesus would like bend over it
[1:17:00] would like it would hurt him every time
[1:17:02] every time you seen it hurt him and he
[1:17:04] paid for that sin
[1:17:05] for that hurt on the cross of calvary
[1:17:07] and he took his side and his blood
[1:17:10] and with his blood he said pardoned for
[1:17:13] all of his sins
[1:17:15] how many is glad for that amen
[1:17:18] so real real value is
[1:17:22] of course in the grace of almighty god
[1:17:26] which is comes by amen
[1:17:29] now we come down to how we receive it
[1:17:31] amen

[1:17:35] this grace

[1:18:50] 5th chapter romans 5 is the key

[1:18:58] therefore being justified by faith we
[1:19:02] have peace with god through our lord
[1:19:03] jesus christ
[1:19:04] by whom also we have access
[1:19:08] by faith how many believes that
[1:19:11] everything that you get from god
[1:19:13] amen you get by faith
[1:19:17] amen the joy that you have the peace
[1:19:19] that you have the forgiveness that you
[1:19:21] have it don't matter what it is
[1:19:23] it is goes and travels on the vehicle of
[1:19:26] faith
[1:19:27] that's what gets it the vehicle
[1:19:31] the channel should we say of faith
[1:19:36] something that's totally not seen
[1:19:39] that's the only way that we receive all
[1:19:42] of these great values
[1:19:46] is through the operation and channel of
[1:19:50] faith
[1:19:52] praise the lord
[1:19:55] oh my we have access
[1:19:58] by faith into this grace
[1:20:02] praise be to god it is faith that brings
[1:20:05] you
[1:20:06] and gives you amen brings you to the
[1:20:07] place of grace
[1:20:09] wherein we stand and rejoice in hope
[1:20:14] of the glory of god praise be to god
[1:20:19] hallelujah think about it
[1:20:24] oh by faith by
[1:20:27] faith we have access to god how many
[1:20:30] believes that
[1:20:31] one of the one of the great values of
[1:20:35] this
[1:20:35] world first of all is to be happy
[1:20:39] happiness and how many knows that
[1:20:43] you're never gonna be happy outside of
[1:20:46] justification
[1:20:48] outside of having your sins forgiven
[1:20:52] huh how many believes that that's right
[1:20:55] because
[1:20:56] we as human beings especially us of all
[1:20:58] of us
[1:20:59] who were brought up in church no there's
[1:21:01] a judgment day coming
[1:21:03] not right we realize we got to give an
[1:21:06] answer for everything that we ever did
[1:21:08] unless it gets under the blood
[1:21:11] and we carry that around we carry this
[1:21:13] weight so to speak around
[1:21:15] amen and so we have this and we begin to
[1:21:18] it weighs us down and it causes not to
[1:21:21] have any joy
[1:21:22] not to have any peace let me tell you
[1:21:25] something this world look at the chaos
[1:21:27] that's out there
[1:21:28] all of that chaos is for one reason and
[1:21:30] because of one reason
[1:21:31] and that is because they have not taken
[1:21:34] the greatest value thing that there is
[1:21:36] in this world
[1:21:37] and that's jesus christ by faith
[1:21:40] that's why they're so tore up about
[1:21:43] equal rights and everything else
[1:21:48] huh how many of those we as christians
[1:21:51] hey if you want to chop our head off
[1:21:52] chop our head off
[1:21:53] if you want to burn us at the stake burn
[1:21:55] is at the stake
[1:21:56] jesus says don't be afraid of what they
[1:21:59] can do to your body
[1:22:01] huh because they can kill you
[1:22:04] they will be thou faithful unto death
[1:22:08] isn't that right those hundreds of
[1:22:10] thousands of people
[1:22:12] right after the book of acts that would
[1:22:14] go to the martyrs
[1:22:15] even they would die and give their life
[1:22:18] they forfeited their right to live
[1:22:22] huh hey if they wanted to not forfeit
[1:22:25] their right to live they'd have taken up
[1:22:27] arms and fought
[1:22:29] huh but we're all paul said like sheep
[1:22:33] to the slaughter
[1:22:35] we're just interested in one thing and
[1:22:37] that is serving god
[1:22:39] and if everybody had that attitude you
[1:22:40] know
[1:22:42] think of where the world would be at we
[1:22:45] try not to do each other wrong or harm
[1:22:48] we try to treat the other guy as we want
[1:22:51] to be treated
[1:22:53] isn't that right it would be a great
[1:22:55] place we'd be in the millennium we'd be
[1:22:57] in heaven if everybody
[1:22:58] followed this here but we know that
[1:23:01] we're living
[1:23:02] in a wolf country that right i sent you
[1:23:05] forth as sheep among wolves
[1:23:08] be careful be wise therefore we're in
[1:23:11] wolf country
[1:23:12] amen but let's go back to think of the
[1:23:15] list look at this
[1:23:17] faith by faith we have this how many
[1:23:20] believes that that is something that's
[1:23:21] not seen
[1:23:22] but it's one of the most powerful things
[1:23:24] that we have brother man also he makes a
[1:23:26] statement he says that
[1:23:27] well it's a right according to
[1:23:29] corinthians even
[1:23:32] um
[1:23:35] let me just read the scripture
[1:23:39] second corinthians 5 i think it is
[1:23:52] well i have it wrote down here i think i
[1:23:54] do
[1:23:56] talking about even the weapons that we
[1:23:58] have spiritual weapons
[1:24:00] that we fight against the devil with
[1:24:09] i should know my bible a little better
[1:24:15] no all right
[1:24:18] so we'll just repeat it for the weapons
[1:24:21] of our warfare
[1:24:22] while we are in the flesh we do not war
[1:24:24] against the flesh paul's head
[1:24:26] the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:24:28] carnal but spiritual
[1:24:30] to the pulling down of strongholds we
[1:24:33] cast down
[1:24:34] reasoning and imagination and everything
[1:24:37] that exalts itself above the word of god
[1:24:41] amen so we realize that the the weapons
[1:24:44] that we have
[1:24:45] to fight against the devil they are even
[1:24:47] unseen
[1:24:48] they're not something that you see it's
[1:24:50] something that's on the inside
[1:24:52] but yet it's real how do you believe
[1:24:54] that you overcome
[1:24:55] the thoughts and the number one battle
[1:24:57] is in our mind
[1:24:59] the number one thing that we have to
[1:25:00] overcome is the imagination and the
[1:25:02] reasoning in our mind
[1:25:04] amen that's the first thing that jesus
[1:25:06] and the faith real genuine faith
[1:25:09] will capture every thought paul said
[1:25:12] capture
[1:25:13] every thought and bring it down to the
[1:25:15] obedience
[1:25:16] of christ amen
[1:25:19] moses when he was over in hebrews talks
[1:25:22] about by faith moses
[1:25:23] amen when he he he was born he was hit
[1:25:27] three months from his parents
[1:25:28] because they thought that he was a
[1:25:30] proper child but they were not afraid of
[1:25:32] the king
[1:25:32] commandments and by faith by moses when
[1:25:35] he was come to years
[1:25:37] refused to be called the son of
[1:25:39] pharaoh's daughter
[1:25:42] praise the lord how many knows that it
[1:25:44] is absolutely
[1:25:45] what governs our life is the faith
[1:25:48] that's in our arms
[1:25:50] we make choices based either on doubt or
[1:25:53] we make choices based on
[1:25:55] faith and it governs our life moses
[1:25:58] it says that he said he esteemed he too
[1:26:01] chose rather to suffer affliction
[1:26:06] with the people of god and then what was
[1:26:09] our
[1:26:10] bible reading this morning uh blessed
[1:26:13] are you when men shall cast your name
[1:26:15] out
[1:26:16] and persecute you and all these things
[1:26:18] amen that's the way of a christian
[1:26:20] christian they're going to be talked bad
[1:26:22] about when they don't do bad
[1:26:24] they're going to be called evil when
[1:26:25] they're not evil
[1:26:27] and moses he chose rather to suffer with
[1:26:29] the people of god
[1:26:30] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:26:34] season
[1:26:36] moses had his eye on that great value
[1:26:40] of eternal life and he knew even as
[1:26:44] brother branham described that you talk
[1:26:46] about the best
[1:26:47] life that a man could ever imagine all
[1:26:50] the pleasures that you could bestow upon
[1:26:52] yourself as a human being
[1:26:54] and in the flesh moses could have had it
[1:26:57] but he forfeited all of those things
[1:27:00] because
[1:27:01] in verse 26 he esteemed the reproach
[1:27:04] of christ greater riches
[1:27:09] than all the treasures of egypt
[1:27:13] hallelujah how many believe that every
[1:27:16] son of abraham does the same thing
[1:27:18] we esteem the treasures of god greater
[1:27:21] than any of these things that the devil
[1:27:23] would want to entice you with
[1:27:26] let me tell you something in this world
[1:27:28] it isn't just about being a christian
[1:27:30] amen and escaping hell but it's about
[1:27:32] having in your heart
[1:27:34] the greatest treasure there is on the
[1:27:36] face of the earth
[1:27:38] that's what it's all about god is not
[1:27:40] just something amen to be scared of or
[1:27:43] worried about that but god is
[1:27:45] a treasure how many believes that men
[1:27:48] i'll tell you
[1:27:48] god is your treasure that's where your
[1:27:50] heart's going to be
[1:27:53] oh let me just say while it comes to my
[1:27:55] one of the greatest things that we have
[1:27:56] also amen i believe in the arsenal of
[1:27:59] the believer
[1:28:00] amen is prayer i read in the bible here
[1:28:03] is that jesus said
[1:28:04] that men ought always to pray even jesus
[1:28:07] was telling us
[1:28:08] you need to pray you need to pray
[1:28:12] i mean please it's a real joy to go down
[1:28:14] let me just say this
[1:28:15] amen if you don't everybody here i hope
[1:28:18] that you'll commit this morning
[1:28:19] that if you don't take time on your
[1:28:22] knees
[1:28:22] pray you need to make time to pray
[1:28:28] you don't realize the value of it right
[1:28:30] brother joe the value
[1:28:32] of prayer it is valuable
[1:28:36] it'll bring peace to your heart it'll
[1:28:38] bring joy to your heart it'll bring the
[1:28:40] presence of god into your heart
[1:28:42] so that when we come to church we bring
[1:28:45] the presence of god with us
[1:28:48] how many believes that's what we want
[1:28:50] god help me to bring the presence of god
[1:28:52] with me
[1:28:53] when i come to church not just be wally
[1:28:56] wally wu
[1:28:56] jerusalem so to speak with bible real
[1:28:59] joy in my heart
[1:29:02] amen it's a real value
[1:29:06] prayer faith joy it's a value it's one
[1:29:09] of the greatest values there
[1:29:11] and it's all supernatural brother bram
[1:29:14] says you know anything you can see it's
[1:29:15] not real
[1:29:16] but how many knows joy is real happiness
[1:29:19] is real peace is real the holy ghost is
[1:29:23] real
[1:29:26] being justified is real
[1:29:29] praise be to god hallelujah
[1:29:32] let me touch on this i thought of
[1:29:34] justification for a minute
[1:29:35] shall we i mean remember brahman in the
[1:29:39] invisible union he talks about how that
[1:29:41] we are
[1:29:42] not only he says now you're not only
[1:29:44] forgiven
[1:29:47] hallelujah because i believe it takes a
[1:29:49] little bit more than just being forgiven
[1:29:53] no it takes being justified
[1:29:56] praise the lord how many knows he rising
[1:29:59] he justified
[1:30:00] freely forever in other words he made us
[1:30:04] just he made us right
[1:30:09] oh my but you're justified romans 5 1
[1:30:13] says we're
[1:30:14] therefore justified by faith look at the
[1:30:16] word
[1:30:17] the word don't even mean forgiven
[1:30:22] whoa i guess brother brown had a good
[1:30:25] thought
[1:30:25] he says it don't mean forgiven
[1:30:30] that word means justified and it don't
[1:30:34] mean that you're forgiven for instance
[1:30:36] you heard that i got drunk and
[1:30:37] did some evil thing and so forth come
[1:30:39] around to me saying well i found out you
[1:30:41] did that
[1:30:41] and i forgive you he says then you come
[1:30:44] and i say forgive me
[1:30:45] i didn't do it
[1:30:50] hallelujah how many believes that that's
[1:30:52] where you stand
[1:30:53] if you're gonna go in the rapture amen
[1:30:55] if you're gonna meet the lord in the air
[1:30:57] you aren't just gonna have your sins
[1:30:59] covered they're gonna be completely
[1:31:00] remanded not disremoted but justified
[1:31:03] you'll stand justified as though you've
[1:31:06] never
[1:31:07] done it in the first place as far as
[1:31:10] god's concerned you have never even done
[1:31:12] those things
[1:31:13] justified in the sight of god
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:18] praise be to god i'll be thankful for
[1:31:20] justification
[1:31:22] amen if you have completely have your
[1:31:24] sins remitted in the sea of god forgive
[1:31:26] them you ought to be the happiest person
[1:31:28] in the world
[1:31:29] why because you have peace with god
[1:31:33] amen how many thankful for that peace
[1:31:37] that you have in your heart amen
[1:31:40] i can tell you that i could sin to sit
[1:31:42] under an evergreen
[1:31:44] give me a thousand years just to sit
[1:31:46] there and fold my hands
[1:31:49] and say thank you jesus thank you jesus

[1:32:26] thank you lord and then i would take
[1:32:28] another thousand years put a beat

[1:32:52] i mean looking forward to being over
[1:32:54] there brother branham at an early age he
[1:32:57] lost his wife and a child so he had
[1:32:59] ambition to be with them all of his life

[1:33:13] tithing saved up amen i head to the
[1:33:15] mission fields and go over there

[1:33:24] store them up in heaven amen moth won't
[1:33:28] corrupt over there

[1:33:35] hey maybe the gospel
[1:33:38] if it wouldn't have been for you coming
[1:33:40] and sharing this gospel and leave me to
[1:33:42] christ

[1:33:45] the old lady said thank you
[1:33:47] wouldn't it be for you going i wouldn't
[1:33:49] be here
[1:33:51] and you can look in those people who've

[1:33:54] they'll be eternally in the heavens
[1:33:57] our true values our true treasures
[1:34:02] are over there amen in heaven
[1:34:06] our true treasure and our true value is
[1:34:09] in the supernatural
[1:34:11] realm that's why i believe
[1:34:14] brothers and sisters if you don't get
[1:34:15] anything else out of the service this
[1:34:17] morning
[1:34:19] said it in your heart how many wants a
[1:34:22] closer walk with the lord
[1:34:24] then said it in your heart that you will
[1:34:27] not just
[1:34:28] say a prayer perhaps so loosely but get
[1:34:32] down on your knees find a place to go
[1:34:34] before the lord
[1:34:35] because i truly believe brother and he
[1:34:37] says god loves for you to kneel down
[1:34:39] before him and go to prayer and talk to
[1:34:41] him god loves for you to do that
[1:34:45] amen i was in my office this morning and
[1:34:46] studying and usually i have that
[1:34:50] last minute pushing for all the things
[1:34:52] you know
[1:34:53] i said i think they'll be fine i says i
[1:34:55] think it's more important that i pray a
[1:34:57] little
[1:34:58] that i talk to the lord and it felt so
[1:34:59] good it always feels good every time
[1:35:01] this morning at home
[1:35:02] just to get down on your knees and talk
[1:35:04] to the lord how many knows what it feels
[1:35:06] like it just feels good
[1:35:07] amen you feel you know it feels good
[1:35:09] just to talk to him and know that he
[1:35:11] hears you
[1:35:12] and he draws you closer and it changes
[1:35:14] you
[1:35:16] to me that's worth more than any comfort
[1:35:18] that the devil would try to give
[1:35:20] somebody
[1:35:21] that's more comforting than any booze or
[1:35:23] beer or doper
[1:35:25] drug that he could offer yeah because
[1:35:27] all of that other stuff is just
[1:35:29] substitutes
[1:35:30] they're lies they don't give them any
[1:35:33] more peace they don't give them any more
[1:35:35] a comfort no they're more miserable
[1:35:37] afterwards than they were before
[1:35:39] how maybe there's only one way to have
[1:35:41] true comfort and that is to have this
[1:35:43] peace of god in your heart
[1:35:45] amen there's no greater place to be
[1:35:48] whether you have a dime in the bank or
[1:35:50] whether you're
[1:35:51] below whether you have a bouncing check
[1:35:53] account if you've got god in your heart
[1:35:55] you've got everything
[1:35:56] let the poor say i am rich amen
[1:36:00] amen because if you've got god if you've
[1:36:02] got the holy spirit if you've got peace
[1:36:04] in your heart if you have faith in god
[1:36:06] you have one of the most valuable things
[1:36:08] that there is on the earth
[1:36:10] amen the blood of jesus christ cleanse
[1:36:13] you
[1:36:13] amen at calvary amen i'm just glad for
[1:36:17] calvary
[1:36:18] it made the way for everything it made
[1:36:20] it possible
[1:36:21] for god to forgive you and justify you
[1:36:25] and sanctify you filled with the holy
[1:36:27] ghost and made a way to go to heaven

[1:36:51] that this week and i thought thank you
[1:36:52] lord jesus amen some of the simpler
[1:36:55] scriptures that we
[1:36:56] are very familiar with but yet amen just
[1:36:59] bring it about in another way that makes
[1:37:00] it even more real to me
[1:37:02] thank you lord jesus i had never really
[1:37:04] thought about that they couldn't even go
[1:37:06] into paradise until after calvary
[1:37:09] because it took a remitting it took a
[1:37:11] the perfect lamb
[1:37:12] not the substitute lamb we took the
[1:37:13] perfect lamb
[1:37:15] man for to be able to be justified let's
[1:37:17] power heads this morning

[1:37:25] to the lord and say god
[1:37:26] i ask you to forgive me lord person than
