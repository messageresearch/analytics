[17:34] hey man and it's just good to be in the
[17:37] house of the Lord amen
[17:39] um so I picked up a thought that I
[17:42] basically kind of ended with a couple
[17:44] weeks ago and I want to pick it up from
[17:46] there amen and expound perhaps uh in a
[17:51] little bit different direction if I can
[17:53] with the hip of the Lord and I believe I
[17:55] spoke on uh bride food and I got to
[18:00] talking about amen how that uh I believe
[18:03] at the end of it I was talking about
[18:05] perfect strength by Perfect weakness
[18:07] amen and how that we come down to dust
[18:10] amen amen like Paul did he was struck
[18:13] down on the road to Damascus I believe
[18:16] it was amen and he was struck down to
[18:19] the dirt so to speak amen and so I mean
[18:22] we want to pick up from there and then
[18:24] perhaps him come up from the dust would
[18:27] that be okay come up from the dust and
[18:30] see what God can do amen amen what did I
[18:33] title this tonight I'm not even sure I
[18:36] believe it's when God takes over amen
[18:40] when God takes over amen
[18:42] let's pray Lord Jesus we come before you
[18:45] once again Lord with grateful hearts
[18:48] to have a group of people Lord Jesus
[18:50] here in this Elkin area Lord that loves
[18:53] you and that wants to serve you with all
[18:55] their heart father and that's looking
[18:56] forward to seeing you soon face to face
[18:59] Lord and that comes out on a Wednesday
[19:02] night Lord to prepare their self for
[19:04] that great day that lays ahead Lord
[19:06] Jesus and father we ask God who is
[19:09] streaming tonight that you'd be with
[19:10] them also Lord and Lord mold and shape
[19:13] them Father as your word Goes Forth
[19:15] father we know the hearing of the word
[19:18] it shapes us it molds his father and
[19:21] Lord we just ask God that you come and
[19:23] mold us and shape us into your image
[19:25] have your perfect weight tonight Lord
[19:27] Jesus as we surrender ourselves to you
[19:29] may you use us for your honor For Your
[19:31] Glory now bless the thoughts of our
[19:34] heart and bless your word in Jesus
[19:35] Christ's name amen and amen praise the
[19:40] Lord so amen I just uh I mean it's
[19:43] certainly gonna sound like a perhaps a
[19:46] repeat of what we've said here a few
[19:48] weeks ago go but Eamon I got to thinking
[19:50] about this and it's just because the
[19:52] Lord's just began to pour it out it
[19:54] seemed like so we just try to follow the
[19:56] leading of the spirit amen and see what
[19:59] he would have amen amen if you will turn
[20:02] your Bibles and I think we'll start with
[20:06] um
[20:08] First Corinthians
[20:10] the second chapter
[20:13] First Corinthians 2 and I'm gonna for
[20:17] the few minutes we want to cover some of
[20:20] the quotes and things amen that we've
[20:23] read before before we get into the
[20:25] middle part of our thought and the men
[20:28] and then we'll just go from there amen
[20:34] First Corinthians 2 and verse 1.
[20:37] and I Brethren when I came to you came
[20:40] not with Excellency of speech or of
[20:43] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[20:46] of God for I determined not to know
[20:48] anything among you save Jesus Christ and
[20:50] him crucified and I was with you in Meek
[20:53] in weakness and in fear and in much
[20:55] trembling and my speech was not the
[20:57] preaching and my preaching was not with
[21:00] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[21:03] demonstration of the spirit of God that
[21:06] you face should not stand in the wisdom
[21:09] of man but in the power of God may God
[21:12] that is blessings to the reading in the
[21:14] word amen you can be seated
[21:16] amen I want to emphasize to begin with
[21:19] what Paul says in verse 3 when he says
[21:22] and I was with you in weakness amen
[21:26] remember the little quote we read
[21:27] brother bam says what we need is a bunch
[21:29] of weaklings
[21:30] amen we need some weaklings
[21:34] amen now notice here Paul you know most
[21:39] of us preachers probably today we'd say
[21:41] something you know boy I'll tell you
[21:42] what we had a service to you the other
[21:44] day and man it was just such a powerful
[21:46] service and all of this you know here
[21:49] Paul comes and now he comes and talks
[21:50] about how weak he was
[21:53] and how did he add fear you're always
[21:55] talking about not having a nephew yet
[21:57] fear amen and his he has has he come in
[22:00] much trembling
[22:02] wouldn't it be something if we could
[22:04] have Paul stand up here amen and speak
[22:06] those words I'd love to just see his
[22:08] demeanor and the spirit that goes along
[22:11] with it and just the way that he brought
[22:13] it about it's probably different than
[22:15] what we think
[22:18] isn't that right
[22:19] but that's what he was and I you know
[22:21] that word fear I like what the the
[22:24] brother banham you know it takes a
[22:25] profit of God a lot of time to bring
[22:27] these things out amen and and he
[22:30] explained he explained what this fear
[22:33] was amen he says now the reason that he
[22:37] was fearing is not because he was scared
[22:40] of anything but he was scared that he
[22:43] would displease God in some way
[22:50] in some way amen that he'd get his own
[22:54] ability mixed up into it
[22:58] amen now we're beginning to begin with
[23:01] our thought tonight and that is about
[23:02] our human ability
[23:05] amen
[23:07] Paul amen and I I just want to say this
[23:11] tonight because I hear preachers
[23:12] everywhere all the time we're talking
[23:14] about the Bride of Jesus Christ with a
[23:16] manifestation of the hour and all these
[23:19] things and I truly believe that I
[23:21] believe we are the bride of Christ but
[23:23] amen what I want to talk about is what
[23:26] that bride is
[23:28] amen
[23:30] what she really is because guess what
[23:33] you're you're not just going to be
[23:35] anything and be the bride
[23:37] you're going to have to have some
[23:39] qualities there's some things going to
[23:40] be about you that makes you the bride
[23:43] amen amen and it's going to be what's on
[23:46] the inside is what's going to meet God
[23:48] and I truly believe that uh this this we
[23:52] are the word of God Amen how many
[23:54] believes that and we are becoming the
[23:56] word of God we're becoming the message
[23:57] of the hour
[24:00] how many believe that and tonight's
[24:02] service is certainly going to be more
[24:04] bride food amen it's things that we eat
[24:08] even because you become what you eat
[24:10] amen and so now those here he says he
[24:13] was scared that he would displease God
[24:15] in some way and I had to think Maya Paul
[24:17] was that way shouldn't every Christian
[24:19] be the same way shouldn't we worry a
[24:22] little bit sometimes that we do
[24:25] something in ourselves that would be
[24:27] displeasing God because sometimes we
[24:29] might get our own way mixed step into it
[24:33] because I'm telling you
[24:35] amen
[24:37] when we get our own ways mixed up into
[24:40] it
[24:41] we bitterly fail
[24:46] amen
[24:48] amen
[24:51] oh my that's right praise the Lord so
[24:54] now notice here he says oh now notice
[24:57] listen to this man who was a warrior had
[25:00] stripped himself amen if there's
[25:02] anything that our schools needs today
[25:04] churches needs today is a stripping of
[25:07] ourselves
[25:08] amen of our own thoughts and our own
[25:11] abilities Faith the Lord strip yourself
[25:14] before God unless you would try to do
[25:16] something within yourself
[25:20] amen let me tell you the strongest most
[25:23] powerful person man or woman in here is
[25:27] a person that has not necessarily
[25:30] because you've cast out devils and moved
[25:33] mountains and all those things but a
[25:35] person that actually whipped themselves
[25:39] conquered yourself
[25:43] that's your biggest enemy that's the
[25:45] hardest thing to do is to conquer
[25:47] yourself and I truly believe if I can
[25:49] add the ability somehow I could show us
[25:52] all that there's still too much of our
[25:54] self there
[25:58] that we still have a lot of room
[26:01] to improve when it comes to dying to
[26:03] ourself
[26:05] I truly believe that
[26:08] amen
[26:10] all right a couple of quotes like I said
[26:12] before we go on
[26:21] become nothing
[26:27] second Corinthians 12.
[26:30] in verse 9
[26:33] amen verse 11 go with verse 8. for this
[26:37] thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it
[26:40] might depart from me and he said unto me
[26:43] my grace is sufficient for thee for my
[26:46] strength is made perfect
[26:49] and weakness
[26:54] amen it sounds like Paul hit the
[26:58] bullseye
[27:00] it sounds like Paul is where he was
[27:03] supposed to be and that is weak in
[27:06] himself
[27:11] oh my amen
[27:14] come in weakness my strength I Faith be
[27:17] to God oh my I like that because if you
[27:20] want more of God's perfect strength
[27:24] you've got to become weaker
[27:27] most gladly therefore will I rather
[27:29] glory in mine infirmities that the power
[27:32] of Christ May rest upon me
[27:35] now here we can preach for a whole
[27:37] sermon on just the infirmities that God
[27:39] sends you away the trials that he sends
[27:41] you away Amen to cause you to realize
[27:44] that you're weak
[27:46] that you can't do it
[27:49] oh my there's a testimony amen I wrote
[27:52] over here if there's a testimony that I
[27:54] know that I have had in my life is that
[27:57] when God brings me to the place that I
[27:59] can't do anything about it
[28:01] I can't get over it I can't get around
[28:04] it I can't get under it
[28:06] then I squirm like a worm
[28:13] you do too
[28:15] it's a terrible place
[28:18] I mean come on folks man you ain't got
[28:20] the money to pay the bills or this
[28:22] happens or that happens and then out of
[28:25] your power I like container within my
[28:27] power to do something about it but God
[28:29] brings you the place where it's with
[28:31] outside of your power
[28:33] and the more you try to do it in
[28:36] yourself the more you fail
[28:40] and the more you fail oh it's just a
[28:42] terrible place to be until finally you
[28:45] get smart and you drop to your knees and
[28:48] realize you know that's where God wanted
[28:50] you in the first place
[28:53] to where you would not try to do it in
[28:55] yourself but you'd learn to rely on God
[29:06] praise the Lord
[29:12] Amen brother Sean sometimes it takes
[29:14] people 40 years
[29:17] to learn new things 40 years
[29:23] I I I
[29:26] dare say there's some people claim to be
[29:29] message people and they haven't learned
[29:31] it yet
[29:33] they still ain't learning and I highly
[29:36] question whether they ever will
[29:41] amen because you've got to recognize the
[29:43] moving of God in your life
[29:47] let me just say this that if you
[29:49] bitterly fail at something you need to
[29:51] go back and see check your motive and
[29:54] your objective
[29:56] you see if you had any of your own
[29:57] ability in there at all because and I'll
[30:00] read you the quote but the Bible says
[30:01] God don't never fail
[30:03] God don't fail
[30:06] and I grant you he said any of your
[30:09] abilities you will fail
[30:11] if you're in it at all you will fail
[30:14] oh my you can look at yourself and see
[30:17] where you failed
[30:20] you can look at others and see where
[30:21] they failed and they failed they failed
[30:23] and it says I'm like don't you realize
[30:24] that God ain't in what you're doing
[30:28] you need to go a different direction
[30:31] amen praise the Lord
[30:35] that's right now let me get to my point
[30:38] here therefore therefore I take pleasure
[30:42] in infirmities and reproach Us in
[30:45] Necessities in persecutions in
[30:48] distresses for Christ's Lake for a
[30:50] winner break
[30:54] for when I am weak then am I strong
[31:01] I'm gonna rephrase that just a little
[31:03] bit that'd be all right for when I am
[31:05] reading is he strong
[31:10] amen
[31:12] just like Paul said the faith that I
[31:14] have I have it's not my faith but it's
[31:16] the very faith of the Son of God the
[31:18] life that I not live I live by the face
[31:21] of the son of God
[31:26] then am I strong and I have become a
[31:30] fool and Glory oh my if you all haven't
[31:34] done any studying Paul in this glory and
[31:36] he says he many places he talked about
[31:37] I'm gonna brag about all the bad stuff
[31:39] that happens to me
[31:42] I'm gonna glory in my eternity and I'm
[31:45] gonna Post in life if I have anything to
[31:46] boast about it whatever it's about my
[31:48] infirmity the things that God allows to
[31:50] come my way
[31:51] man I can't even escape a shipwreck amen
[31:54] I Get Shipwrecked
[31:57] two or three times he got into my doctor
[32:00] when Paul got into the boat you better
[32:03] give your ticket back and get done
[32:05] another move
[32:09] why because he was going down
[32:13] [Applause]
[32:17] Hallelujah
[32:20] but the good thing about is God said
[32:22] don't tell anybody to jump overboard try
[32:24] to escape to stay where you are it'll be
[32:26] all right I'll calm this ocean down
[32:32] hey man how about this Peter and what
[32:34] about that little ship though we may not
[32:36] give you get anywhere where Jesus is and
[32:38] one of God's servants and you're in for
[32:40] a Target amen I tell you what it's like
[32:42] the bullseye on you and every arrow out
[32:45] of hell is going to be pouring the
[32:47] starch and the arrows are gonna fly
[32:48] don't get too close to the real thing
[32:51] unless you're ready to have something
[32:52] like adversity
[32:56] [Music]
[33:00] but Jesus always came through didn't he
[33:08] now on the back here we are on the
[33:10] island and we finally got this nice
[33:12] little campfire going and man we're
[33:14] having some good separate and a snake
[33:16] jumps out of the fire and bites under is
[33:20] what else can go wrong
[33:24] huh
[33:25] praise be to God but when you told me
[33:28] I'll tell you what it's God that
[33:29] delivers me it's God that should shook
[33:31] it up and kept on going it's all for his
[33:34] glory
[33:36] it's all for God
[33:38] praise be to God
[33:41] oh my
[33:43] God
[33:44] all right let me go down to the bottom
[33:47] of that verse
[33:50] I'm a fooling Glory you have compelled
[33:53] me for I ought to have been recommended
[33:56] of you
[33:58] amen for in nothing am I behind the
[34:02] chiefest apostles though I be nothing
[34:12] amen
[34:14] praise the Lord
[34:16] how many believes you got to come to the
[34:18] place
[34:19] to where you realize you're nothing
[34:23] amen
[34:25] now notice what he says here
[34:27] he says the person that ought to thought
[34:29] that he was was not insufficient the
[34:32] person that had no ability then that
[34:34] person such in good shape so God can
[34:36] start using them that's right when they
[34:39] feel like they can't and haven't got
[34:41] nothing that's when God can take a hold
[34:43] of them and do something with them but
[34:46] when we are thinking that we're able to
[34:48] do it and God can't use us because we're
[34:50] wanting to do it in ourselves
[34:52] when we are insufficient in ourselves
[34:54] then we are subjects to yield to God's
[34:57] spirit
[34:58] amen oh my so then if it's us trying to
[35:02] do it
[35:03] it will fail
[35:10] amen I wrote down here man last time you
[35:12] failed at something
[35:14] did something wrong said something to
[35:16] somebody you shouldn't have said it or
[35:17] did something or whatever it was and it
[35:19] was bitterly just went bad you have to
[35:23] ask yourself was that me
[35:25] huh was that my ability in there
[35:28] amen
[35:31] oh my I don't know about you yes Lord I
[35:34] know what you're talking about
[35:36] that I got a rebound in here yeah these
[35:39] preachings coming back at me
[35:41] [Laughter]
[35:43] tell her right can I preach
[35:45] it was oh my that's right but boy I'll
[35:47] tell you what
[35:48] my mind okay
[35:51] now notice but as long as we're trying
[35:53] to
[35:54] now notice but if we'll just yield it'll
[35:57] fail but if we'll just yield ourselves
[35:58] to God then God can't fail there's only
[36:02] one thing that God cannot do and that's
[36:03] fail
[36:07] he can do anything else but fail amen
[36:13] no notice
[36:20] I need to read this over here first
[36:24] 67 62.
[36:27] 63 it is it is before
[36:30] now first let me just um
[36:34] get something to you
[36:36] read this quote no ability I don't care
[36:39] whose it is will never be usable in the
[36:42] sight of God
[36:43] God has to get all of our abilities out
[36:46] of us before he can achieve his purpose
[36:49] amen
[36:50] now look around today
[36:55] and all of our great achievements that
[36:57] we think we've done
[36:59] and where is Christianity in the United
[37:02] States
[37:04] remember this around 1963. look at where
[37:07] it's at in the United States look at all
[37:08] of our churches and our denominations
[37:10] look at our evangelists and healing
[37:13] campaigns
[37:15] and everything else that we've had and
[37:18] what is it worse then it was at the
[37:21] beginning
[37:24] folks I don't know how they could have
[37:25] said it back then
[37:27] but if you look at it today you apply
[37:29] this scripture today you can exactly see
[37:31] what brother Brandon's talking about
[37:32] where are they all at
[37:34] what was all the Billy Graham and all of
[37:36] them where's all the healing Billy
[37:38] Graham it all over the place what what
[37:39] is become of the world
[37:42] talking to a man up there and the
[37:44] grocery store at The Food Giant we're a
[37:46] Methodist Church a man pulled away from
[37:48] the main organization the Methodist
[37:49] because they're allowing homosexuals and
[37:52] lesbians and everything else and so they
[37:54] wanted him to become Pastor perhaps a
[37:56] Pentecostal huh
[37:59] he's telling me man they ain't got no
[38:01] clothes don't dress right and everything
[38:03] else they got all kinds of man they're
[38:05] so far off the beaten path they're just
[38:07] pulling away because of homosexual
[38:09] lesbians and so forth but they're
[38:10] pathetics eight balls huh
[38:13] that's the condition of the church world
[38:16] it's in real bad shape Prophet God was
[38:19] exactly right wasn't he
[38:21] look at it today oh my look at
[38:23] everything he says where's the name boss
[38:24] at the beginning it's worse off today
[38:26] than it ever was because that we've
[38:29] tried it to do it in human ability
[38:34] oh my even talking about their prayers
[38:37] and everything else so what I gather
[38:38] from this brothers and sisters is that
[38:40] you and I are going to have to have
[38:42] something more something different than
[38:44] they did
[38:46] all that was preached all that was done
[38:48] you're gonna have have something more
[38:56] amen
[38:58] otherwise we're just going to end up
[38:59] like them
[39:01] a complete failure
[39:04] why do Christians fail
[39:07] because
[39:10] they haven't come the right way
[39:12] I may believe there's a right way and a
[39:14] wrong way
[39:15] you've got to come God's way
[39:18] amen
[39:20] praise the Lord aren't you glad
[39:22] oh my I'm so thankful for this message
[39:25] aren't you
[39:26] so glad for this message you got sent
[39:28] because infant food wasn't for that what
[39:31] would we do
[39:34] amen again the quote I wanted to read
[39:37] now what good did it do nothing
[39:40] and it'll never be until every person
[39:43] that professes to be a Christian will
[39:45] forget about your own ability and yield
[39:47] himself to God
[39:54] you won't
[39:56] say that nothing unless you are dead
[39:59] you you're so
[40:01] yourself the almighty God
[40:03] we need a surrender to God like never
[40:06] before
[40:07] because you and I would let me tease
[40:09] them oh my we've got so much
[40:12] so much of ourselves
[40:14] still a lot of times
[40:17] we still have everything else
[40:21] first we've got too many things up first
[40:24] God has to be first
[40:26] when you go home and when you make a
[40:28] deal or this out of the other well I'm a
[40:30] Christian first somebody asked you well
[40:31] what do you do
[40:33] what do you do I serve God
[40:36] that's my master that's my first thing
[40:38] is I am God's serving I'm a Christian
[40:40] that's what I do
[40:44] now if you want to know my secondary job
[40:46] or my second thing I do I might be a
[40:48] carpenter I might be a logger I might be
[40:50] a uh you know a metal man whatever it
[40:53] might be that's all second
[40:55] everything you did this week was your
[40:57] secondary work we're here this is what
[41:00] we do first
[41:03] foreign
[41:08] doesn't matter when I go out my door
[41:10] tomorrow morning amen this I'm a
[41:12] Christian first and then I go do
[41:13] something that I need to do
[41:15] no matter what I do it's always Christ
[41:17] in it all but every all of our working
[41:18] all our money making and all of that
[41:20] stuff's all secondary
[41:23] amen
[41:24] it all has to be yielded completely
[41:27] to God
[41:31] amen
[41:32] we think today sometimes that the Great
[41:34] Men of God you know are people perhaps
[41:36] that have achieved a lot in their
[41:38] wealthy and they're well off and all of
[41:40] that I want you to know the most
[41:42] greatest powerful of Warriors of all and
[41:44] men were pretty much bums
[41:47] they like I wrote down here during the
[41:49] bomb category
[41:52] when it comes to material things you're
[41:55] in the bum
[41:56] didn't even Jesus say foxes have holes
[41:59] Purge of nests but I ain't got no bed
[42:02] I ain't got nowhere to lay my head
[42:06] huh
[42:08] Paul he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[42:10] spent a lot of time in jail and in bonds
[42:13] and imprisonments and a lot of times
[42:14] he'd asked Timothy somebody just bring
[42:16] me a coat
[42:18] huh
[42:20] that much
[42:22] why but I'll tell you what
[42:25] we make sure we're all taken care of
[42:30] what about this guys he well taken care
[42:32] of
[42:32] the Inner Man
[42:34] amen
[42:35] praise the Lord
[42:37] praise the Lord
[42:41] all right praise the Lord so
[42:43] let me see
[42:46] that's right never did any good until
[42:48] every person that professors Christian
[42:49] will forget his own ability yield
[42:50] himself to God
[42:55] you know how many people wouldn't follow
[42:58] the message today I wouldn't pay
[43:00] attention to that Pillar of Fire right
[43:02] there
[43:04] you know and all these things that
[43:06] either the discernment of things is
[43:08] because they were had a position in the
[43:10] church
[43:12] you know why that Pentecostal that
[43:14] brother Brandon got on the phone with
[43:15] and said now we're gonna have to take
[43:16] him the name off the book because he
[43:17] came in fellowship with you
[43:20] he was up on this age and so forth and
[43:22] he he fellowshipped with you
[43:25] no doubt but Jesus Christ came and
[43:28] discerned the thoughts into the heart
[43:30] and the meeting and everything and the
[43:31] Pentecostal said we're gonna have to
[43:33] take his name off the book
[43:35] huh do you reckon he had some of his own
[43:38] abilities in there his own selfish
[43:40] motives in there that's exactly what it
[43:42] was why do you think the Pharisees they
[43:45] had a selfish motive didn't they
[43:47] they had a selfish motive and let me
[43:48] tell you something Paul he had a selfish
[43:50] mode he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees
[43:54] his ability what he could do
[43:58] oh my how many notes it's not about what
[44:01] you can do the Antichrist will actually
[44:03] force force people Amen to worship him
[44:07] God Don't Force us to worship Him you
[44:10] won't be able to buy or sell unless you
[44:12] belong to him and the devil forces
[44:14] people through political and financial
[44:16] means
[44:19] and anytime somebody's not born again
[44:21] let me tell you something if you're not
[44:22] born again you will lead to your own
[44:24] ability
[44:26] you'll try to get things done according
[44:28] to the way that you can get it done
[44:30] naturally instead of relying on God to
[44:33] do it
[44:34] huh
[44:36] maybe maybe it's a white my wife isn't
[44:39] the way she wanted to be amen and so
[44:41] I'll tell you what just like that
[44:42] Pentecostal BPM the mother band he says
[44:44] I've been praying for my wife I've been
[44:47] trying to cast the devil off of her
[44:48] getting her to be a Christian and
[44:50] everything else
[44:53] isn't that right
[44:55] brother bam says you're going about it
[44:57] all wrong
[44:59] go buy her some flowers and some gifts
[45:01] and be nice to her hey man what did he
[45:04] wins it was nice Jordan and showed her
[45:06] love and it revolutionized his world
[45:10] his ability or God's ability the right
[45:14] way or the wrong way
[45:17] amen
[45:19] oh Lord help us folks if we expect to be
[45:22] in a Rapture one of these days
[45:26] there's a lot of message people no doubt
[45:29] they won't go
[45:32] another message people ain't going
[45:35] there's a lot
[45:37] but a man says there's going to be a
[45:39] very very very few come out of this
[45:41] generation
[45:44] if you're going to run this race and
[45:45] you've planned on being there God is
[45:47] going to do work in your life you've got
[45:49] to do a work in your heart he's going to
[45:51] change you
[45:52] and what's it going to do it's going to
[45:54] come the way that this Prophet the
[45:56] message is for brought according to what
[45:58] Paul said that you've got to die to
[46:00] yourself daily
[46:02] you're going to have to come to the
[46:04] place where you're
[46:05] perfectly we think that it's you have no
[46:07] ability you have no Pride you're done
[46:09] that or not some big somebody not a know
[46:11] it all but a nobody
[46:14] anything I am I am by the grace of
[46:17] almighty God
[46:18] when you get to the place you realize
[46:20] you're not a big shot you're not
[46:21] somebody
[46:25] a kingdom
[46:27] I'm not able to
[46:30] then you're ready for God to begin to
[46:32] lift you up then you're ready for God to
[46:34] begin to use you like he did Paul he had
[46:37] to not paw off his eyes horse break him
[46:39] down to the Damascus to us and realize
[46:41] that he was going about a complete wrong
[46:44] way
[46:45] the very God that he claimed to be
[46:47] serving he was persecuting
[46:52] amen when you come down to that dust you
[46:54] got to come to dust brother am says amen
[46:58] then God is ready to use you
[47:01] amen
[47:03] now notice
[47:06] forget his own ability and yield himself
[47:08] to God
[47:09] amen God can achieve his purpose by not
[47:13] sending the Revival brother
[47:15] but what it needs is first is a killing
[47:18] so that we can
[47:21] you heard my saying I think last service
[47:23] we don't need a revive the flesh
[47:26] we need a Revival of the spirit
[47:29] too many times to buy the the flesh
[47:32] revives amen
[47:34] you have to die before you can be born
[47:36] again he needs the killing of ourselves
[47:38] this Tabernacle needs a killing me with
[47:40] and all of us we need a killing so that
[47:42] we can be revived to New Life A New Hope
[47:45] new experience
[47:47] hey man we need a day of mourning first
[47:52] praise the Lord you got to come to dust
[47:55] come to the place that you know that
[47:57] you're nothing then you're ready to
[47:59] start then God can shape you God can
[48:02] bold you God can use you
[48:05] I don't know what God's Gonna use you

[48:10] it can use you for your abrahe can use
[48:13] you for your job for your workers those
[48:16] around you you'll be a reflection of
[48:17] Christ
[48:19] amen
[48:25] God makes a way amen now you're ready to
[48:30] follow God's way how many believe that
[48:33] these people all these people in this
[48:35] generation they did not come God's way
[48:39] they did not hear God's word they left
[48:41] the Miracles they love the discernment
[48:44] did I love the opening of the bind and
[48:46] so forth isn't that exactly how they did
[48:47] in Jesus they liked all that but when it
[48:49] came to the word
[48:51] huh
[48:53] the word they just couldn't take it even
[48:55] when the BAM says you know now brother
[48:56] abandon when he's in the pulp and so
[48:57] forth to discernment you know that's God
[48:59] but don't listen to his Doctrine you

[49:06] that was teaching false Doctrine
[49:08] amen
[49:10] oh my
[49:12] now let me go in a little bit different
[49:14] direction as we rise up
[49:17] what do you do you come to the death of
[49:19] yourself like Jesus said and then you
[49:21] begin to come God's way because God
[49:23] makes a way aren't you glad that God

[50:03] little bit giving us the right direction
[50:04] to go
[50:06] that he provides things for us
[50:10] that no matter
[50:12] what you face
[50:14] now it's a different story now
[50:17] that you raise up again by the power of
[50:19] the Holy Ghost

[50:22] God first of all has to give you faith
[50:25] to conquer yourself with
[50:28] amen we're saved by grace through faith
[50:30] that not of yourselves it's the gift of
[50:32] God God gives you Faith to conquer
[50:34] yourself with not only that but to

[51:54] breeze come off the top of a hill when
[51:57] that snow caps the mountains and them
[51:58] little ducks raise up from there
[52:01] amen and never seen I've been off the
[52:03] pound come straight to Louisiana as hard
[52:05] as they can it's nature the laws of
[52:08] nature they do it every year he says
[52:10] watch the geese over in Texas where many
[52:12] of them go I've seen the time that God
[52:14] had to stop the car on the road and
[52:17] they'd not be bothered by nobody they're
[52:19] thinking about going
[52:22] how you reading between the lines
[52:25] they got a revival going on all of all
[52:28] of them together
[52:30] to noise why it's worse than
[52:36] can't you feel a little breeze coming
[52:38] mothers and sisters can't you feel that
[52:40] Holy Spirit Breeze coming and Santa's
[52:43] about time to get up
[52:44] I live here
[52:46] time for the bride to become this word
[52:51] that to themselves to come up in newness
[52:53] of life
[52:54] oh my you never heard such when they get
[52:57] together why see what it is it's the
[52:59] laws of nature every year they get
[53:00] together and so forth and when they
[53:02] leave Northern British Columbia Winter's
[53:04] on the way
[53:05] you hear the geese going over screaming
[53:07] to attitude going south I can listen at
[53:10] them and cry because I see God guiding
[53:14] them
[53:15] oh when I got to thinking about how did
[53:17] God guide his children how did he teach
[53:19] that new man he has a leader for him
[53:25] let me just finish the duck story first
[53:28] can I will get on this other in a minute
[53:32] amen
[53:33] now notice what guides them to the
[53:36] pathless air
[53:38] oh my what guides them to the Past was
[53:40] there
[53:41] when it's nothing but a dumb brute what
[53:43] is it that he doesn't
[53:45] oh my talked about hear him going and
[53:48] y'all can you know that leader out there
[53:50] kind of taking his way maybe he's never
[53:52] winged his way to Louisiana before but
[53:54] he'll get there
[53:57] how many believe that we've never went
[53:58] this way but God's gonna have a way for
[54:00] us God's way that made a way for us he's
[54:03] taking his flight he's heading heading
[54:06] to her the whole swarm of them is a
[54:08] coming they may never have been there
[54:10] before big knows exactly where those
[54:13] rice paddies are but it's got rice
[54:15] because he got something that leads him
[54:18] something that's on the inside
[54:21] how many believe that that's the way it
[54:23] was with Paul after he got struck down
[54:25] to the running Masters amen he began to
[54:27] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost they
[54:29] meant to lead him and to guide him
[54:35] oh my
[54:37] that's right
[54:40] now notice
[54:41] and then when spring comes when it's
[54:43] nice and warm down here
[54:45] amen he'll go right straight back up
[54:48] there again it's nature displaying
[54:50] itself
[54:51] it's the laws of God now he says
[54:54] prophets Arch God's chief sign
[54:56] he says God's chief sign is a prophet
[54:58] now I'm going to speak a few minutes
[55:00] about that they are his word made in
[55:02] manifest for that age and that's the
[55:05] reason that the prophet is always God's
[55:06] chief sign he has never sent a judgment
[55:09] upon the Earth without first sending a
[55:12] prophet
[55:13] just seeing scriptures like Noah like
[55:16] Moses like Elijah the prophets amen
[55:18] he sends them to manifest the word for
[55:21] that age to give his people a warning
[55:23] just the same as he sends a cool spell
[55:26] upon the Ducks run them to the north and
[55:29] to the South I'm here to change the
[55:31] light I feel like the power of the holy
[55:33] spirit amen is telling us that you
[55:35] better than I better you better run into
[55:37] Christ
[55:39] it's that time
[55:41] he got much time left
[55:47] amen
[55:48] God's chief sign is not so much that
[55:51] Cool Breeze but it's
[55:53] amen it's
[55:54] the signs of a prophet God send a
[55:56] prophet
[55:58] showed himself in a picture
[56:03] I like what sister Becky says whenever
[56:05] they got to talking about this yeah yeah
[56:07] yeah yeah yeah you might not like that
[56:09] picture too much but don't you know the
[56:10] story
[56:11] about the critic that had his finger up
[56:13] in him and all kinds of pictures that he
[56:15] took of brother bam he was going to put
[56:17] in the paper make himself look great and
[56:18] make him look little and there's only
[56:20] one picture that developed
[56:23] and JJ Lacy of FBI and all of them
[56:26] documents there to come on said
[56:28] confirmed that it's real hello it was
[56:31] the only one that developed
[56:35] that ought to shake a little bit
[56:37] hello to quieten you down
[56:40] it's no small thing
[56:42] amen
[56:45] I can undoubtedly say that that's god's
[56:48] picture right there
[56:50] amen
[56:53] not brother Branham
[56:56] but God loved this man so much he stood
[57:00] behind this man so much that there ain't
[57:03] but a few inches between him and his
[57:05] head
[57:08] show me another man that has his picture
[57:10] taken with God
[57:13] amen
[57:14] all the celebrities and everybody else
[57:16] everybody watches whose pictures they
[57:17] get taken with them uh they don't want a
[57:19] bad rep
[57:20] God wasn't afraid took his picture with
[57:23] the prophet
[57:24] amen
[57:26] praise be the god
[57:28] oh my
[57:31] so I got to think about this duck thing
[57:33] but before I even got to thinking about
[57:35] that I got to thinking about the Deep
[57:36] calling to the Deep
[57:38] and I wrote down here why did God give
[57:42] fish
[57:43] fins
[57:46] fins
[57:50] think about why
[57:52] he gave fish fins
[57:55] otherwise they'd all be sea snakes
[57:59] right they'd have to just wiggle through
[58:01] the water like that right
[58:03] sea snakes
[58:05] but it give them he knew that there
[58:07] would be water he made the water first
[58:09] right
[58:10] and he gave the fish fins so that he
[58:12] could guide himself
[58:14] how you like them little sidearms you're
[58:16] gonna continuously going this way always
[58:19] going like that isn't that right
[58:21] balancing themselves
[58:23] all right
[58:24] amen he put a tail on him
[58:27] even just writes and if he ever decides
[58:30] to take off like lightning but he you
[58:32] won't catch him
[58:34] the speed of a fish
[58:37] isn't that right they can go like who'da
[58:39] thought it God give them a way of Escape
[58:44] amen
[58:46] praise be to God and I thought wow
[58:48] Hallelujah that's the way God does with
[58:51] his children he makes a way he gives
[58:53] them something that they have need of to
[58:56] conquer every enemy that's in front of
[58:58] them
[59:00] something who was first God or the devil
[59:03] amen
[59:05] amen before there was a fish there had
[59:08] to be an ocean for the fish to swim in
[59:10] before you as a Victor there had to be
[59:13] something for you to have victory over
[59:17] aren't you glad for that that's another
[59:19] excite every one of us knowing that God
[59:21] has given you what you have need of he
[59:24] equips Paul he gives him what he has
[59:26] neither
[59:28] God equips his people
[59:32] Hallelujah just like he does the duck he
[59:34] put something in his nature
[59:37] oh I love this story Rebecca bam says
[59:39] man all of those Ducks Amen in the north

[1:01:22] amen and that's what God's doing on a
[1:01:24] Wednesday night it's getting us
[1:01:25] ready

[1:01:31] getting rid of our failures

[1:01:46] Wings isn't that right
[1:01:48] amen God has provided everything that we
[1:01:52] ever have need of

[1:02:18] place we're not there yet
[1:02:21] come on folks
[1:02:22] there's other things that take priority
[1:02:25] God so provides everything for you that
[1:02:27] I don't care if you don't know your next
[1:02:30] paychecks coming from I don't care if
[1:02:32] you're at the place and you're
[1:02:33] surrendered to God you don't know where
[1:02:35] your next meals come from I serve the
[1:02:37] kind of God that knows and dissipize
[1:02:40] your need
[1:02:44] I may believe that Jesus Christ knows
[1:02:46] the fall of us bear he knows the number
[1:02:48] of your hair amen
[1:02:50] he knows that you have need of these
[1:02:52] things but he's at seek first the
[1:02:53] kingdom of God and do you think shall be
[1:02:55] added unto you God will take care of you
[1:02:58] Paul he didn't have a whole lot but he
[1:03:00] always had what he needed
[1:03:02] Jesus he didn't have a whole lot but he
[1:03:05] was so surrendered he was that mighty
[1:03:06] warrior the mighty warrior that by the
[1:03:09] time he put out there that looks so
[1:03:11] great and fabulous so awesome that was
[1:03:14] Jesus humble that was Paul humble
[1:03:18] Mighty Warriors who had submitted
[1:03:21] themselves to almighty God and God could
[1:03:23] use them in such a way until Jesus if he
[1:03:26] did until he'd walk on water
[1:03:30] oh I've been needed to hit back bread
[1:03:32] and fish and they multiply the fishes in
[1:03:34] the loaves
[1:03:36] that's what God would do to a son and
[1:03:38] daughter of God if you whatever you have
[1:03:40] need of God would apply your need
[1:03:44] if you're in the place where God wants
[1:03:46] you to be
[1:03:47] if you're surrendered to God
[1:03:50] I may believe that
[1:03:52] I don't care what it is that you need
[1:03:54] he says if you say to this mountain be
[1:03:56] moved it'll do it God will move
[1:03:58] mountains for you I'm glad to be serving
[1:04:01] a God Like That
[1:04:03] most of us don't have to worry about
[1:04:05] where our next meal is coming from
[1:04:08] if you're like me you got two freezers
[1:04:11] one ain't enough
[1:04:14] have two freezers
[1:04:16] getting a little bit low now about time
[1:04:18] to butcher another one of them cows
[1:04:22] amen but there think about it but like I
[1:04:24] said but if you did if you wasn't the
[1:04:26] place
[1:04:27] you're so serving God like Paul is like
[1:04:29] Jesus did you don't know you know even
[1:04:32] Jesus had to pay his taxes they didn't
[1:04:34] have the money and they're right and he
[1:04:35] said go over here and catch this fish or
[1:04:37] whatever and get that money out of the
[1:04:38] fish's mouth somebody threw something in
[1:04:41] and they didn't realize that it was a
[1:04:42] whatever it was enough to pay their
[1:04:44] taxes where's the fish like the
[1:04:46] shininess of it and swallowed it or bit
[1:04:48] into it and he can't get it stunned
[1:04:50] stuck from his mouth
[1:04:52] I guess that's what it was he said got
[1:04:54] it out of the fish's mouth isn't that
[1:04:55] right
[1:04:57] God makes a way how many glad for God
[1:04:59] made in a way

[1:05:11] about that but little all of this but
[1:05:13] let me let me go there look at this for
[1:05:14] a minute why did God in our human heart
[1:05:19] in our human heart the profit
[1:05:22] daughter said the animal kingdom don't
[1:05:23] have it but in the human heart there's
[1:05:25] an extra little compartment there
[1:05:31] that's right amen y'all know he said
[1:05:34] that I'm not just making that up that
[1:05:37] right so he made it he designed it
[1:05:39] because God wanted that to be the
[1:05:41] control driver
[1:05:44] that was the place for your soul and it
[1:05:47] is also where God is supposed to be in
[1:05:49] where
[1:05:50] your heart
[1:05:52] God's supposed to be in there he's the
[1:05:54] one that's in control now
[1:05:58] amen
[1:06:00] he is leading us he is guiding us
[1:06:04] man a shift has to have the man has had
[1:06:07] to sift for himself if you're not a
[1:06:09] Christian you've got to sit for yourself
[1:06:11] I gotta sift for myself
[1:06:15] I'm glad God takes care of me aren't you
[1:06:18] glad God takes care of you
[1:06:22] he sure does
[1:06:23] and he's in here he's the one that's a
[1:06:25] preeminent one
[1:06:27] he's in that controlled power leading
[1:06:30] you guiding you
[1:06:34] but man we don't people just don't
[1:06:37] recognize don't realize
[1:06:39] that they do too much they try to guide
[1:06:42] themselves lead themselves
[1:06:44] fend for themselves you weren't made to
[1:06:46] be doing that you were made to rely on
[1:06:49] the leadership of almighty God
[1:06:55] amen thank God for it
[1:06:59] every age has always had
[1:07:03] um let me see here
[1:07:07] away made for them by God
[1:07:11] First Corinthians 10 and 13 says that no
[1:07:14] temptation taken you but such as is
[1:07:16] common to man but God who is faithful
[1:07:19] will not suffer you to be tempted about
[1:07:21] that ye are able but will with that
[1:07:24] Temptation also make a way of Escape
[1:07:30] amen
[1:07:31] I thought about that make a way
[1:07:34] he's the way maker I like that song
[1:07:36] Don't you he always makes a way
[1:07:39] when there doesn't seem to be a way
[1:07:42] he always makes a way
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:47] oh my
[1:07:49] when you're in the line of duty
[1:07:51] and you come up to a Red Sea
[1:07:55] huh
[1:07:57] Great Captain the Great Captain Jehovah
[1:08:00] told Moses I want you to go down between
[1:08:01] these rocks down here go down through
[1:08:04] here just go down through that crevice
[1:08:05] go down then there go way down in there
[1:08:08] it was a trap how far from that crevice
[1:08:11] or whatever it was it was a trap and he
[1:08:14] couldn't get back out and they heard
[1:08:15] it's a pharaoh and his horses coming
[1:08:17] right
[1:08:18] had to be pretty close
[1:08:21] and when they got down there there was a
[1:08:22] big old sea a big old water body they
[1:08:25] could never go across
[1:08:28] isn't that something couldn't go across
[1:08:30] God loves to bring you to that place

[1:08:35] to where you can't go over it you can't
[1:08:37] go under it there's

[1:08:49] but that's when you got to yield
[1:08:51] yourself to God
[1:08:53] and God will open up the Red Sea for you
[1:08:56] if he needs to how many believes God is
[1:08:58] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:00] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:09:04] forever

[1:09:07] God will provide you with a get out of
[1:09:09] jail card free
[1:09:11] he can provide you with that isn't it
[1:09:13] right they put Paul and Silas in the
[1:09:15] inner prison and what was their
[1:09:17] obligation what did they do again to
[1:09:19] pray and sing songs
[1:09:20] worship God
[1:09:22] I just heard a testimony here of a
[1:09:24] Preacher talking about somebody amen
[1:09:26] that had something real bad disease
[1:09:28] gonna die and everything else all of a
[1:09:29] sudden when a certain word was spoken

[1:09:56] and he equips us how many believes the
[1:09:59] holy spirit is the equipment that you
[1:10:02] need to conquer every devil that you
[1:10:05] have in front of you
[1:10:07] he will supply every need that you have

[1:11:32] believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:33] remember one place Peter Brown says the
[1:11:35] bride and church age book he says the
[1:11:37] bride does only his will no man can make
[1:11:40] them do otherwise they have thus saith
[1:11:42] the Lord or they keep still they have
[1:11:44] the mind of Christ I mean he's a bride
[1:11:46] is going to do and fulfill the will of
[1:11:49] God not your will and the way you want
[1:11:51] to do it and the way you want to think
[1:11:52] but the way that God wants it done
[1:11:56] there's a couple of messages brother
[1:11:57] Brandon preaching I preachers here many
[1:11:59] times as most preachers do a lot of
[1:12:01] preaching again and again of ourselves
[1:12:03] and I do that too amen but listen to one
[1:12:05] thing he said you know he says after the
[1:12:07] seals and after desperation and all that

[1:12:27] the token
[1:12:29] the literal life of Jesus Christ mother
[1:12:32] bam said ain't that right
[1:12:34] he said that's what the token is it's
[1:12:36] very God's very own life

[1:14:16] total complete Prophet when since when
[1:14:19] God sends a man to do anything he
[1:14:21] completely equips him with everything
[1:14:23] that he has needed
[1:14:26] Oh Glory we should run the balcony we
[1:14:30] run all over the place and realize that
[1:14:32] if God does something and he puts you in
[1:14:35] this layout to see a little gourmet he's
[1:14:38] gonna give you something to overcome it
[1:14:40] with

[1:14:54] back you're gonna have to have what it
[1:14:56] takes and God supplies us with What It
[1:14:58] Takes remember to lay out and see a
[1:15:00] church there they were lukewarm had need
[1:15:03] of nothing ratchet miserable for blind
[1:15:05] and naked but I Picasso divides for me
[1:15:09] to buy me gold tried in the fire

[1:15:25] and to be clothed upon him that the same
[1:15:27] shame of our nakedness do not appear
[1:15:31] amen
[1:15:34] this just comes to mind you can take it
[1:15:36] for what it's worth
[1:15:38] but won't it be a shame when people
[1:15:40] realize
[1:15:42] they weren't dressed for the Rapture
[1:15:43] they didn't have what it was going to
[1:15:45] take they're left behind

[1:15:58] whatever he does God equips you he'll
[1:16:00] fix you up with what you have need of
[1:16:03] he fixed Paul up with what he had need
[1:16:06] of
[1:16:08] what is that that's himself
[1:16:12] I can do all things through Christ with
[1:16:14] strength and strengtheneth me I know how
[1:16:17] to abound and I know how to suffer need
[1:16:20] amen
[1:16:21] that's when he said that I can do all
[1:16:24] things through Christ's dream listen
[1:16:26] now notice
[1:16:28] let me just read this this is very good
[1:16:30] this is out of total Deliverance if our
[1:16:32] hearts condemn us he says now listen we
[1:16:35] want complete deliverance we don't want
[1:16:37] it halfway church we want a real church
[1:16:40] amen or no church at all we want to be
[1:16:43] real Christians or no Christians at all
[1:16:45] we want taller than leverage from our
[1:16:48] habits

[1:16:52] any bad habits
[1:16:55] Lord help me
[1:16:57] from our sins
[1:16:59] from our evil thinking
[1:17:02] from our evil doing
[1:17:05] for my negligence
[1:17:09] whatever we've done we want a total
[1:17:12] Deliverance so that when people come
[1:17:14] into this church to be prayed for this
[1:17:16] may be just a little group maybe a
[1:17:18] hundred to two sitting here they'll be
[1:17:20] completely but they'll be completely in
[1:17:22] the hands
[1:17:23] of God
[1:17:25] and when we pray then God will hear from
[1:17:28] Heaven God wants somebody that he can
[1:17:29] hold in his hands somebody that he can
[1:17:31] say I got confidence in that person I
[1:17:33] can send this my sick servant to the
[1:17:35] Branham Tabernacle and that group of
[1:17:37] people are in one Accord something will
[1:17:40] happen oh my well look look what he does
[1:17:44] in the next look what he does in the
[1:17:46] condition
[1:17:49] what would he do if we would love one
[1:17:52] heart of one Accord
[1:17:57] how many notes that if one person is
[1:17:59] thinking contrary to the holy spirit in
[1:18:02] the direction that God's going what
[1:18:03] person going contrary is a negative it's
[1:18:06] a it's a damp rag so to speak
[1:18:10] we need everybody everybody thinking the
[1:18:13] same thing
[1:18:15] if you want to read more about us being
[1:18:18] one and we'll be in the we'll get it
[1:18:19] listen to Total Deliverance he says a
[1:18:22] lot more in it but listen
[1:18:24] look what he does one Accord and the
[1:18:27] only we can do it is to unify our hearts
[1:18:29] together with brotherly love
[1:18:31] obey the offices of the church and the
[1:18:33] pastor and Obey and the pastor obey God
[1:18:36] then God works in the pasture through
[1:18:39] the board down into the church and all
[1:18:40] together our one unit to the kingdom of
[1:18:42] God then God will hear when we are a
[1:18:46] unified group let nothing bother you
[1:18:49] don't be dismayed in anything
[1:18:54] amen sister Sherry don't be dismayed
[1:18:57] we aren't dismayed in anything
[1:19:00] anything is possible for those that
[1:19:02] believe

[1:19:05] that's when the church shall be
[1:19:07] completely delivered when everything
[1:19:09] comes under the blood I mean please got
[1:19:12] to be under the blood when your sins
[1:19:14] come under the blood when you're smoking
[1:19:16] when you're gambling when you're
[1:19:18] cheating when you're stealing when
[1:19:20] you're lying when everything's brought
[1:19:22] under the blood then there'll be a total
[1:19:24] Deliverance
[1:19:28] and he wants to be up complete Christian

[1:19:34] don't want to be halfway nothing
[1:19:36] you don't have to be the only oh my God

[1:19:42] it was right in here where it says you
[1:19:43] know the people that are halfway the
[1:19:46] reason they're halfway is because they
[1:19:49] got their own ways mixed up in God's
[1:19:51] program folks if we're not what we ought
[1:19:54] to be we still got a little bit of
[1:19:55] ourself in there here and out there in

[1:19:59] you ought to be remember you got your
[1:20:02] own ways mixed up in yet you're not the
[1:20:05] fireball Christian because you still got
[1:20:07] your own way Bennett
