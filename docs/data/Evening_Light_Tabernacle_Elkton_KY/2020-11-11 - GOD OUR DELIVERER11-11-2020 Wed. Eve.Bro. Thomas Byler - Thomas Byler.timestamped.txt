[24:46] so i mean anytime he's got a victory
[24:48] it's always a wonderful thing amen so
[24:50] god bless you man
[24:56] yes let me give you this one here
[25:06] oh um i was going through a really hard
[25:08] struggle in my life you know and
[25:10] i was talking to her brother and you
[25:11] know he just said you know that's just
[25:12] one thing you gotta
[25:13] you just gotta stop doing it so you know
[25:15] it's really hard for me to
[25:17] overcome it because you know at that
[25:19] time satan was just pulling so hard you
[25:20] know uh
[25:21] you know it's like a you know brother
[25:24] was preaching sunday insane about the
[25:25] death walk i feel like that's what i was
[25:26] doing because
[25:27] in a way i was i started there and you
[25:30] know i tried to
[25:31] i tried to do it on my own which didn't
[25:33] work and i figured that out the hard way
[25:35] because i kept and i kept going around
[25:37] in a circle and i ended up running the
[25:38] same spot where i was before
[25:40] you know i felt like there was just no
[25:42] way of getting out of you know and
[25:44] eventually i got to a point where i felt
[25:45] like leaving the message and you know
[25:46] killing myself because you know i got so
[25:48] down and depressed you know because i
[25:49] couldn't overcome this and you know
[25:52] but um i kept trying and trying trying
[25:55] and you know i kept failing but you know
[25:57] the more i want to pray you know i
[25:59] started getting a little bit better you
[26:00] know i started running
[26:01] a few more victories in my life you know
[26:02] i got a few victories and
[26:05] but i still failed every now and then
[26:06] but you know and then the lord you know
[26:08] that's when you know that song uh the
[26:11] lord will be there right on time you
[26:12] know that's when god really stepped in
[26:14] you know just
[26:15] took it away from me so and you know now
[26:17] standing here today i have no desire to
[26:19] do it whatsoever you know
[26:20] it's just completely out of my heart i
[26:22] wouldn't do it for anything you know and
[26:23] i just want to say thank the lord for
[26:25] helping me to overcome you know that's
[26:26] one of the
[26:27] probably one of the strongest now that
[26:28] he has the hardest battle i've ever ever
[26:30] came you know so
[26:31] but i couldn't have done it without the
[26:32] lord you know so i mean i just thank the
[26:34] lord for stepping in and what he did you
[26:36] know
[26:37] you know i remember the message that
[26:39] brother bailey preached about miracles
[26:40] you know that was a real miracle for me
[26:42] and
[26:42] you know i kept talking about it so many
[26:44] times you know at one point i felt like
[26:46] me and brother brother obama wasn't more
[26:48] friends no more because you know i got
[26:50] but i texted him he said he was so that
[26:51] was
[26:52] what a relief but uh but you know other
[26:55] than that
[26:56] i'm just really thankful that the lord
[26:58] stepped in and helped me
[26:59] overcome it because there was no way i
[27:01] could have done it without without them
[27:02] so
[27:04] so that's just my testimony
[27:06] [Applause]
[27:15] or doesn't it amen
[27:22] all right stand with me if you will
[27:28] imminence power heads
[27:31] lord jesus we come before you father we
[27:33] do thank you lord jesus for the strength
[27:35] lord that you've given brother aaron
[27:37] lord to be able to overcome lord knowing
[27:39] god that this is age of great temptation
[27:42] great tests and great trials lord and
[27:45] father
[27:46] satan would like to sift all of our
[27:48] young people with the enticements of the

[29:26] the lord would have me to say which
[29:29] direction he'd want me to go
[29:31] and so this thought came on my heart and
[29:33] so if you will turn your bibles to first
[29:35] samuel
[29:37] first samuel
[29:48] god our deliverer
[29:52] amen praise the lord
[29:58] amen i andrew didn't know i was going to
[30:00] speak this and
[30:01] so forth not andrew aaron
[30:05] aaron uh but that certainly goes along
[30:07] with his testimony tonight so
[30:09] first samuel the 17th chapter
[30:21] and we'll read verse 31 through 37
[30:24] and then also verse 41 through 49
[30:30] and when the words were heard which
[30:32] david spake
[30:33] they rehearsed them before saul and he
[30:36] sent for him
[30:37] and david said to saul let no man's
[30:40] heart
[30:41] fail because of him thy servant will go
[30:44] and fight with this philistine
[30:47] and saul said to david thou are not able
[30:50] to go against this philistine to fight
[30:52] with him
[30:54] for thou art but a youth and he a man of
[30:57] war
[30:57] from his youth and david said unto saul
[31:01] thy servant kept his father's sheep
[31:04] and there came a lion and a bear and
[31:07] took a lamb out of the flock
[31:09] and i went out after him and smote him
[31:12] and delivered it out of his mouth and
[31:14] when he rose up against me i caught him
[31:16] by his beard
[31:18] and smote him and slew him
[31:21] and thy servants slew both the lion and
[31:23] the bear and this uncircumcised
[31:25] philistine
[31:26] shall be as one of them seeing that he
[31:28] hath defied the armies of the living god
[31:32] david said moreover the lord that
[31:34] delivered me out of the paw of the lion
[31:36] and out of the paw of the bear
[31:37] he will deliver me out of the hand of
[31:39] the philistine
[31:40] and saul said unto david go the lord be
[31:43] with you
[31:44] now verse 41 and the philistine came
[31:47] on and drew near unto david and the man
[31:50] that beared a shield went before him
[31:54] and when the philistine looked about and
[31:56] saw david
[31:57] he disdained him for he was but a youth
[32:00] and ruddy and of a fair continence
[32:04] and the philistine said unto david am i
[32:06] a dog that thou comest
[32:07] to me with staves and the philistine
[32:11] cursed david by his gods and the
[32:12] philistines said to david come to me and
[32:15] i will give thy flesh and to the fowls
[32:16] of the air
[32:18] to the beasts of the field then said
[32:21] david to the philistine
[32:22] thou camest to me with a sword and with
[32:25] a spear
[32:27] and with his shield but i come to thee
[32:28] in the name of the lord of hosts the god
[32:30] of the armies of israel
[32:32] whom thou hast defied this day will the
[32:35] lord deliver thee
[32:37] into my hand amen and i will smite thee
[32:41] and take the head from thee and i give i
[32:43] will give the carcasses
[32:45] of the hosts of the philistine this day
[32:48] unto the fowls of the air
[32:50] and to the wild beasts of the earth and
[32:52] that the earth
[32:53] may know that there is a god in israel
[32:56] and all the assembly shall know that the
[32:59] lord saveth not
[33:01] with sword and spear for the battle is
[33:04] the lord's
[33:05] he will give you into our hands amen
[33:09] we got in his blessings reading the
[33:11] words you can be seated
[33:13] when i thought about deliverance god
[33:15] being our deliverer i thought about
[33:18] david
[33:18] amen and you know we might say so much
[33:21] not only of david but we could talk
[33:23] about so many about
[33:25] uh jehoshaphat we could talk about
[33:30] let me see gideon and different ones
[33:32] that we want to talk about but david
[33:34] here beginning
[33:36] you know i really like david because
[33:39] you know i cannot imagine
[33:42] uh and you can't imagine actually
[33:46] what david did there with that lion in
[33:49] that right
[33:50] he took it when he when he took the lamb
[33:53] back
[33:53] it says the bear attack him and when he
[33:56] attacked him he grabbed him by the mouth
[33:58] and killed him
[33:58] by his beard anybody here can imagine
[34:03] grabbing the blind by the beard
[34:04] killing him i don't i
[34:07] that'd be quite exciting to be old i'd
[34:10] be out behind the trying tree just look
[34:12] and go david
[34:13] go go do it david i know you can right
[34:18] oh my i could just picture this
[34:21] uh you know but the thing of it is here
[34:23] i love this this
[34:24] is one of the greatest stories i guess
[34:26] but david here
[34:28] uh you know when he came to when he
[34:31] rehearsed the story to saul you know
[34:34] because saul says no
[34:36] man no you cannot do it
[34:39] huh you can't do it you know man might
[34:43] say no you can't do it
[34:45] am i on
[35:01] it and then uh david you know
[35:04] he was he wasn't afraid but when david
[35:08] he realized he says you know you can
[35:10] tell us all
[35:12] you might not think i can do it but i
[35:14] have done
[35:29] i'm killing him but that's not like this
[35:31] guy here this guy here
[35:33] has the five nine things of the living
[35:36] god
[35:37] so he's got he is you know much greater
[35:41] than what they have
[35:53] enough for for saul to say all right
[36:00] [Applause]
[36:08] [Music]
[36:13] there was not much to do all right there
[36:17] was not much today because
[36:19] david's faith and david's relationship
[36:22] with god
[36:26] the one thing that i really got to me
[36:29] and i thought this is so awesome is that
[36:32] that david was telling saul
[36:35] when he was telling the story he said he
[36:38] said david said
[36:39] more over and he's in the great custom
[36:42] on the old david
[36:43] he's never bragged on himself he didn't
[36:45] have any pride
[36:47] he put the flame and to give him the
[36:49] credit for exactly where
[36:51] it was supposed to be
[37:00] all right try that all right all right
[37:03] now where was i
[37:11] all right thank you very much yeah so
[37:13] david here properly placing the credit
[37:15] of
[37:16] where it really comes from
[37:19] and when i think about this you know
[37:21] because you know
[37:22] we we got to realize like jesus says you
[37:25] know really without
[37:26] me you can do how much
[37:29] you can't do anything without god
[37:33] david realized that it wasn't him he
[37:36] says look
[37:37] the lord that delivered me
[37:40] oh yeah how many knows you're going to
[37:42] face and you go facing the lion you're
[37:45] going to need some deliverance
[37:48] you're going to need some help you need
[37:51] somebody to help you
[37:53] to deliver you from the mouth of the
[37:56] lion
[37:56] and from the part of the bear
[37:59] i don't know if it's all poured a bear
[38:03] uh listen yeah there it is right there i
[38:06] was almost there
[38:08] the lord that delivered me out of the
[38:10] you know it's the paw of the lion
[38:12] and the paw of the bear all right so
[38:13] it's both paws because we all know that
[38:16] the pause is enough to take care of you
[38:18] am i right so the god that delivered me
[38:21] from the land
[38:22] delivered me from the bear he will also
[38:25] be my protection he will also deliver me
[38:29] he'll save me
[38:32] because that's what it's going to take
[38:34] because i could never do it
[38:36] in myself oh when we get to that place
[38:39] folks and you realize you can't do
[38:41] anything in yourself that's when you're
[38:44] ready to let
[38:45] god come into your life and have his way
[38:48] amen god has to bring you to the place
[38:50] where you realize you can't do it
[38:53] because god brings us into this world
[38:55] amen in the condition that we're in into
[38:57] sin born and sent shape and iniquity
[38:59] we come into a pit and we couldn't help
[39:02] ourselves more than
[39:04] anything there was no way for us to help
[39:06] ourself
[39:08] you can't save yourself you can't you
[39:10] can't even redeem yourself you can't do
[39:12] nothing you're helpless you have to have
[39:14] god to help you
[39:19] and david realized this he was nothing
[39:23] without him he realized that without him
[39:27] i could do nothing long before the new
[39:29] testament ever come along
[39:31] he realized that without god i can do
[39:34] nothing
[39:34] i'm going to be the lion's dinner i'm
[39:37] going to be the bear's dinner
[39:39] if god don't deliver me
[39:42] amen and he had that testimony
[39:45] he come in front of the philistine the
[39:48] philistine disdained him
[39:52] and he was humiliated
[39:57] he says i want you to bring me a man
[40:00] that i can fight that i can do battle
[40:03] with bring me a man worthy because this
[40:04] little shrimp
[40:05] he ain't even fit i don't want to kill
[40:08] that poor little thing i don't want to
[40:10] look bad if i kill that little thing
[40:12] anybody can kill that little thing huh
[40:15] am i a dog that you bring me this little
[40:18] child out here
[40:20] i'm much greater than this give me some
[40:22] competition here
[40:25] and he looked at david and he said i'm
[40:27] going to feed your flesh and the fowls
[40:29] in the air and to the beasts in the
[40:31] field and i'm going to do this that or
[40:32] the other
[40:34] and this is one time that david was in
[40:36] quiet huh
[40:39] david wasn't quiet
[40:42] and david answered him back all right
[40:45] good job speak
[40:47] let me say my peace here
[40:50] david said to the fellows saying you
[40:53] come
[40:54] to me with a spear and a sword
[40:58] in other words this guy had to have
[41:00] somebody carry his
[41:01] shield it was so big isn't that right
[41:05] and it was a great big sword
[41:08] now according to the prophet of god
[41:11] his sword was 14 foot long i believe it
[41:14] was 14 foot
[41:15] you know how long the sword that is i'd
[41:18] like to make a sword
[41:20] and you can just imagine that thing
[41:21] swinging around you wouldn't want to be
[41:23] anywhere around
[41:24] you know how many heads it would roll in
[41:26] one good swing out of that giant
[41:28] 14 inches fingers
[41:31] 14 inch fingers about that long
[41:36] scary-looking monster is what he was
[41:39] he was a scary ugly
[41:43] monster because the bible says even
[41:45] david was fair looking he was kind of a
[41:46] pretty boy maybe
[41:48] this guy was rugged meaning scars and
[41:50] you know
[41:51] he was a real animal
[41:54] what would we learn from here what we
[41:56] learned from this is one thing
[41:58] and that is that uh
[42:01] you know this guy one thing that saul
[42:04] said he says you know
[42:06] you can't do it because you are but a
[42:09] youth you are
[42:12] maybe 22 years old huh
[42:16] maybe david was 22 24 just a young
[42:18] little lad
[42:20] huh we think that's all grown up but now
[42:22] when you're about 60 that's just
[42:24] you know young yet right but just a
[42:27] little
[42:28] just young and you've got no experience
[42:30] you don't never you have never hardly
[42:32] done any bible other than maybe the
[42:34] couple of a lion and a bear you are
[42:36] inexperienced
[42:38] and this guy he has been a warrior
[42:40] slinging
[42:42] that old sphere and shield and training
[42:44] and many battles and he's a veteran
[42:46] [Music]
[42:48] how many knows the devil has been around
[42:50] 6 000 years he's a veteran
[42:55] he can't beat the devil ain't no way for
[42:58] you to beat the devil
[43:01] huh he's been around practicing this for
[43:03] six thousand years
[43:04] how old are you you know i'm 58 years
[43:08] old
[43:09] that's just a cool short little lifespan
[43:11] that's just a youth
[43:14] just the youth compared to the
[43:16] experience of the devil
[43:18] amen how many knows ain't none of us a
[43:21] match for the
[43:22] devil not by ourselves there is no way
[43:27] you can defeat the devil by yourself
[43:30] you might try and try and try and try
[43:34] but you can't do it but listen when the
[43:37] holy ghost comes
[43:39] amen and that makes the difference
[43:43] the difference is when the holy spirit
[43:45] when god is behind you
[43:48] amen even paul said man if god before us
[43:51] who can be against us
[43:55] i want to say that to each and every
[43:56] christian light if you've got the holy
[43:58] ghost
[43:59] amen if you've got god with you
[44:02] you ain't got to be worried about the
[44:04] devil that is old and asian
[44:06] and it very well experienced six six
[44:09] thousand years
[44:11] of experience doesn't matter you can
[44:14] still take his head off
[44:18] take his head off amen so david here
[44:23] he give the lord the credit
[44:26] now notice i come to you in the name of
[44:29] the lord of hosts
[44:31] the god of the armies of israel i'm
[44:36] coming to you
[44:37] with god even brother brown says when
[44:41] you pray for something present
[44:43] your token god may not
[44:46] answer you unless you present your token
[44:50] isn't that right amen god bring god on
[44:53] the scene i come to you
[44:54] amen with the god of the armies of
[44:56] israel whom thou has defied
[45:00] this day i'm gonna show everybody how
[45:03] great i am
[45:05] you said what he said
[45:08] i'm gonna be a hero after today i want
[45:10] to be a big shot
[45:13] no he says this day will the lord
[45:17] deliver you into my hand
[45:23] amen he didn't say i'm gonna take it out
[45:25] god's gonna take you down
[45:30] and i believe even the prophet said it
[45:31] didn't matter which way that stone went
[45:34] it was going to find its mark
[45:37] folks he might have had a little he
[45:39] might have been a good
[45:40] sling thrower i mean a stone throw he
[45:43] might have been good because well i'll
[45:44] tell you from what i understand them old
[45:45] testament folks
[45:46] they slung each other to kill each other
[45:48] with slings and stones and they could
[45:50] they bragged about how that you could
[45:51] perhaps take the cap off of a coke can
[45:53] at 50 yards
[45:56] there what wow that guy can flex sling a
[46:00] stone
[46:01] yeah even to brag the bible brag of how
[46:04] they could sling and so far
[46:05] and how they could take a little and how
[46:07] accurate they were
[46:08] but what if that catch is wrong one time
[46:11] it just goes off man it's going to go
[46:12] palm over there
[46:14] hello but it didn't matter did what
[46:16] david was not relying upon himself
[46:20] come on people i'm not relying on myself
[46:23] i need god
[46:28] oh my that's right
[46:32] so he got that he says today god is
[46:34] going to deliver
[46:35] you into my hand they both prophesied
[46:39] they both spoke of what's gonna happen
[46:41] in the future
[46:43] is that right oh my and i love this
[46:47] picture
[46:48] i gotta i wasn't gonna read it but i
[46:50] will is that all right
[46:52] so he says this is gonna happen
[46:56] and i will smite thee not only will i
[46:59] smite thee
[47:00] but today i'm gonna take your head off
[47:05] back in the old testament they killed
[47:06] each other they'd cut each other off
[47:08] with the head right
[47:09] and put you on a spike that's right it
[47:12] was cruel
[47:13] it was rough you know but that's what
[47:16] they do
[47:18] huh smite being take thy head from the
[47:21] and i will give the carcasses of the
[47:24] hosts of the philistines all them folks
[47:28] back there behind you
[47:29] the birds are going to eat good tonight
[47:32] i love the the wolves look you're going
[47:34] to eat good tonight
[47:37] that's right because i'm gonna feed all
[47:39] y'alls flesh to the fowls of the air and
[47:41] to the beasts in the field
[47:42] it's gonna happen today
[47:47] folks i don't know about you but i can't
[47:49] help but believe that there was just
[47:51] some kind of a fear that happened to
[47:52] strike into that philistine tower
[47:55] oh my word i'm in trouble
[47:58] because i know all the past history of
[48:00] these guys and if their god
[48:02] actually sends a little guy out like
[48:04] this something just might happen
[48:06] huh all right this day the fowls of the
[48:10] air to the wild beasts of the earth and
[48:12] all the earth may know
[48:14] that there is a god in israel
[48:22] [Laughter]
[48:25] doesn't feel good after a victory
[48:28] folks i'm telling you half the time the
[48:30] reason that we don't got no more
[48:32] shouting and praising god is because we
[48:34] ain't got enough victories
[48:37] huh because i guarantee you you struggle
[48:40] over something you battle over something
[48:43] you
[48:43] don't know if you're ever going to make
[48:44] it over something and then you make it
[48:47] through that and you know
[48:48] it was god it just does something to you
[48:56] amen it's not called
[48:59] agony of victory
[49:03] no it's called the thrill of victory the
[49:06] agony of defeat
[49:08] i mean there's always ag of defeat is
[49:11] always
[49:12] agony but victory
[49:16] causes what do people do like they did
[49:18] with miriam
[49:20] amen cause is dead shouting praising god
[49:28] that's right that there is a god
[49:32] in heaven i like that
[49:36] and all this assembly will know that
[49:37] there is a god in heaven
[49:41] that the lord saveth not with sword
[49:44] and spear for the battle
[49:47] is the lord's he will give you into our
[49:51] hand oh
[49:54] how sweet it is when you're fighting
[49:56] something is struggling and battling
[49:58] with something you can't overcome it but
[50:00] when god comes on the scene it just
[50:03] vanishes away it is the sweetest victory
[50:07] in the world when the god fights your
[50:09] battle for you
[50:10] it don't matter what it is how many
[50:13] knows we have many battles in our life
[50:16] many different things that we battle but
[50:19] when god comes in there and he beats and
[50:21] defeats it for you what a glorious thing
[50:26] it came to pass when the philistine
[50:27] arose and came and drew nye to david to
[50:30] meet david
[50:31] david hasted and ran towards the army to
[50:34] meet the philistine
[50:36] and david put his hand in his bag took
[50:39] fancy stone and slang it
[50:41] and smote the philistine in his forehead
[50:46] that the stone sunk into his forehead
[50:51] all right now from my interpretation of
[50:54] this is it didn't stick halfway out
[50:58] sunk into it says all the way in
[51:02] i don't know about you but i can't think
[51:04] when i got a zone in my brain
[51:05] and i guarantee you the glass couldn't
[51:07] either
[51:09] that's right it sunk into his forehead
[51:14] how many knows it shows if you ever see
[51:15] pictures of it it talks about the brass
[51:17] helmet
[51:19] and for some reason they left a gap
[51:21] right there
[51:23] there's a gap right there in the helmet
[51:26] hello it was called the double twist
[51:29] spiral all right
[51:30] the double twist spiral is where it was
[51:35] it's there straight up and down bam
[51:38] that's what it was
[51:39] it hit him right in there it wasn't
[51:42] sideways
[51:42] where it cleaned off it was probably up
[51:44] and down
[51:46] huh i can't but imagine that angel got a
[51:49] hold of that stone
[51:54] and that is all over folks
[51:57] this is a good part that ain't the bad
[51:59] part yet let's listen to this i love it
[52:04] all right the stone
[52:07] sunk into his forehead and he fell
[52:11] not backwards but upon his face
[52:15] to the earth hello
[52:19] straight down you talk about a face
[52:22] plant
[52:23] goliath experienced a real face plant
[52:30] dust i can see the dust just flying up
[52:34] and david didn't have a sword of his own
[52:36] he says so he goes up there
[52:38] the saul i mean does not saul but to the
[52:41] goliath
[52:42] pulls out that big sword comes over here
[52:45] and
[52:46] everybody watching look what he's doing
[52:50] cutting his head up like he said
[52:51] grabs him by the head and probably had
[52:53] to have both hands for that big old head
[52:56] and pull it up shove it up there blood
[53:01] all right i mean imagine he was bleeding
[53:04] a little bit right
[53:08] and then can you hear turn it around and
[53:11] show all the israelites in their little
[53:13] dog holes in their trenches they come up
[53:16] out of them trenches
[53:18] if david can do that they got courage
[53:20] like you ain't never seen before
[53:22] let me tell you when one of us overcomes
[53:24] when one of us gets victory over the
[53:25] devil they ought to give the rest of us
[53:27] know
[53:27] to know that hey we can overcome these
[53:29] devils we can overcome these things
[53:31] that's bothering us
[53:33] you can do it amen but you got to have
[53:35] god to help you to do it
[53:37] amen praise god be to god
[53:41] and so david prevailed over the
[53:43] philistines with a sling
[53:44] and a stone and smoked the philistine
[53:47] and slew him
[53:48] and they said there was no sword so he
[53:50] ran he took and he cut off his head
[53:53] and they chased them to the other parts
[53:55] amen and they defeated him all day long
[53:58] just like he had said
[53:59] let's go to another character gideon how
[54:02] many knows that the book of judges
[54:04] in the book of judges there was many
[54:07] many different men that god used to be
[54:10] deliverers
[54:12] amen how many knows that god uses men
[54:15] god uses people to be deliverers amen
[54:19] like moses was a deliverer right but he
[54:22] was just
[54:23] he was just saying man in the hands of
[54:25] god because god is truly deliverer
[54:28] amen it takes god to be a deliverer and
[54:30] in those days
[54:31] if you all remember there was many
[54:33] different fights that was going on
[54:35] and then gideon was chosen he was chosen
[54:38] to be a deliverer
[54:40] and they were going to go up now notice
[54:42] i'm going to read a scripture in the
[54:43] judges the 7th chapter and i want to
[54:45] read you
[54:46] kind of what kind of size army it was
[54:48] before we actually go into the story
[54:51] the 7th chapter verse 12 the media the
[54:54] midianites the midianites and the
[54:56] amalekites and all the children of the
[54:58] east
[54:59] lay along in the valley like
[55:01] grasshoppers for multitudes
[55:03] and their camels were without number as
[55:06] the sand
[55:06] by the sea side for multitude
[55:10] right so they had a great big multitude
[55:13] but in the earlier in the chapter
[55:14] chapter 7 verse 2
[55:17] amen when they pitched uh
[55:22] pitched in front of the midianites he
[55:24] says
[55:25] in the valley he says the lord said unto
[55:27] gideon
[55:28] the people that are with thee are too
[55:30] many
[55:32] to give to the immediate midianites
[55:35] into their hands for me to give the
[55:38] median nuts into their hands
[55:39] least israel vaunt themselves against me
[55:43] saying
[55:44] my hand has saved me
[55:47] i mean those are you just don't need any
[55:49] praise
[55:52] god doesn't want them to get to thinking
[55:54] boy look at me
[55:56] huh look at what i have done
[56:00] because i'm going to go with the help of
[56:02] the lord i want to talk to you about
[56:03] pride and downfall
[56:05] all right pride and downfall because
[56:07] somebody knows that
[56:08] if you really want to hit the ground
[56:10] hard if you really want something bad to
[56:12] happen to you
[56:13] just let pride come into your life
[56:17] let pride get lifted up in pride think
[56:19] you are
[56:20] somebody think that you did it
[56:24] but you're at it look out you're headed
[56:27] for a downfall
[56:31] because the bible says pride cometh
[56:34] before
[56:36] that's right if all so you can be
[56:39] guaranteed
[56:40] all right so they'll say that
[56:43] my hand has done this and therefore go
[56:46] and proclaim and i'm going to save a
[56:48] little bit of reading but how many knows
[56:49] he says
[56:50] you know just take as many as what
[56:53] drink like a dog or lap it out of the
[56:55] water y'all remember the story
[56:57] let him go down and drink and there
[56:59] ended up being 300 men
[57:02] he ended up with 300 that did that
[57:06] they drank from that water he says
[57:09] listen and the lord said unto gideon by
[57:11] the 300 men
[57:13] that left will i save you and
[57:16] deliver the midianites into thine hand
[57:20] and let all the other people go every
[57:23] man to his place
[57:25] first he said that anybody just scared
[57:27] or worried let them all go home and
[57:29] some hundred lots of thousands of people
[57:31] went home and so forth then he narrowed
[57:32] it on down because god wanted them to
[57:35] know
[57:35] that it's not them
[57:40] i i believe that's what god wants us to
[57:42] know that it's
[57:43] not you it's not me
[57:46] it's god he is our deliverer
[57:51] if you're saved tonight if you're filled
[57:53] with the holy ghost it's because that
[57:55] god
[57:56] delivered you how many beliefs he
[57:59] delivers you from sin he delivers you
[58:01] from this he delivers you from that
[58:02] amen unless he delivers you you're still
[58:05] stuck in a rut
[58:07] you're still unsafe you're still unhappy
[58:09] you're still
[58:10] trapped in the flesh so he said the
[58:14] gideon and them
[58:15] that they were to do that and to make a
[58:17] long story short on this one
[58:21] those 300 i don't know just exactly how
[58:24] the picture is but they
[58:25] divided them up into three groups 100
[58:27] here and 100 there
[58:28] and they all had pictures of pictures
[58:31] and in the pictures were lamps and they
[58:34] went so
[58:35] far and they had another trumpet in
[58:37] their other hand and then at first
[58:38] at a certain place they would take and
[58:40] they would break the pictures
[58:42] amen and hold up the lamp and also blow
[58:44] the trumpet i don't know what the
[58:45] purpose was all about
[58:46] but what happened is uh it says in the
[58:49] 300
[58:50] blue verse 22 the trumpets and the lord
[58:53] said every man sword against his fellow
[58:57] i don't know what they see but how many
[58:58] know that god when he goes to doing
[59:00] stuff he can
[59:01] change and should i say manipulate the
[59:04] minds of the enemy
[59:09] i don't know about you but i would never
[59:11] want to be on god's bad side
[59:14] why just like homosexuality and all of
[59:17] that that's their mind is turned over
[59:19] to a reprobate mind they believe that
[59:23] what it's they're doing
[59:24] is okay huh
[59:27] a reprobate man these guys is right they
[59:30] had amen god uh just turned to each
[59:32] other they fought each other
[59:34] and they killed each other so it was not
[59:38] the three hundreds fight it wasn't
[59:40] israel's but it was
[59:41] the lord that fights for him all they
[59:44] had to do is surrender to god
[59:46] all they had to give is to give
[59:48] themselves to god
[59:50] let me take another character we'll go
[59:52] through this jehoshaphat
[59:54] remember jehoshaphat it was another army
[59:57] the hosts and sand of the seas kind of a
[59:59] thing
[1:00:00] i mean it was a group of people a bunch
[1:00:02] of people had common they had
[1:00:04] yeah man they had given him letters you
[1:00:05] know uh that of war and so forth and
[1:00:08] that was scary the liver on it i mean
[1:00:10] man they couldn't do not they couldn't
[1:00:12] they didn't know which way to turn
[1:00:14] and what did jehoshaphat do he did the
[1:00:16] one thing that i believe is another
[1:00:18] example for us tonight
[1:00:19] and that is that the way that you get
[1:00:21] deliverance
[1:00:22] is when you recognize that you need
[1:00:26] deliverance
[1:00:29] you have got to get to the place that
[1:00:31] you know you need help
[1:00:34] amen and joseph had said that in his
[1:00:36] prayer we are not able to defeat them
[1:00:39] but god we
[1:00:40] need help you see even jesus came not
[1:00:43] for the woes one at her well but for the
[1:00:45] sake
[1:00:47] jesus says you know those that don't are
[1:00:48] not sick they don't need a physician
[1:00:51] i'm afraid the world is full of people
[1:00:53] that don't need a physician
[1:00:55] people think that they don't need god
[1:00:59] but jehoshaphat he dressed in sackcloth
[1:01:01] and in ashes and so forth
[1:01:03] and he began to do what pray
[1:01:06] say it with me pray if you want to see
[1:01:09] god's deliverance
[1:01:10] pray because that's where you're going
[1:01:13] to get your deliverance that's where the
[1:01:14] power comes from
[1:01:16] is to talk to the lord talk to god about
[1:01:19] it
[1:01:20] dress in sacrifice in humility amen he
[1:01:23] was not too proud
[1:01:24] to say oh we can do it huh no he wasn't
[1:01:27] he says we can't do it
[1:01:29] you got to come to the place where you
[1:01:30] recognize i can't do it
[1:01:33] amen but i here i am i am believing that
[1:01:35] god is going to do it
[1:01:37] amen and jehoshaphat did that and the
[1:01:40] word of the lord came back to
[1:01:41] jehoshaphat don't you worry about this
[1:01:43] crowd
[1:01:44] don't you worry about all of this
[1:01:45] because i'm going to take care of it
[1:01:48] i'll deliver them into your hands how
[1:01:51] many knows all of our enemies no matter
[1:01:53] what it is sin
[1:01:55] hatred variance immolation lust whatever
[1:01:57] it is
[1:01:58] that is your enemy amen and you'll never
[1:02:01] overcome that unless god delivers you
[1:02:03] from that because i mean we're born and
[1:02:05] sin shaped iniquity come in the world
[1:02:06] speaking lies
[1:02:08] we come in the hole we couldn't crawl
[1:02:09] out there's no way for you to help
[1:02:11] yourself
[1:02:13] that's where grace comes in i mean god's
[1:02:15] deliverance is grace
[1:02:18] in in luke if you remember luke 4
[1:02:21] and 17 where he picked up the scriptures
[1:02:24] he said this day the scripture is
[1:02:26] fulfilled in your ears
[1:02:27] he booked picked up the book of isaiah
[1:02:29] and he opened the book
[1:02:31] and he said the spirit of the lord is
[1:02:32] upon me because he has anointed me to
[1:02:34] preach the gospel to the poor
[1:02:36] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:02:40] and to preach deliverance to the
[1:02:42] captives
[1:02:44] and recovering of sight to the blind
[1:02:49] just like i said sunday we're born blind
[1:02:52] they have eyes but you see not jesus
[1:02:55] said you got to have the lord to come
[1:02:57] and open up your spiritual eyes to be
[1:02:59] able to even see that you have a need
[1:03:02] people's blind but he came to open up
[1:03:04] the eyes of the blind
[1:03:06] he came as a deliverer
[1:03:10] to deliver the goddess
[1:03:13] captives is something that's got to hold
[1:03:14] you and it won't let go
[1:03:18] it just won't let go the desire for sin
[1:03:21] lust
[1:03:22] all those things will not let go unless
[1:03:24] god
[1:03:25] delivers you from it amen he has to
[1:03:28] absolutely deliver you from it give you
[1:03:30] the power
[1:03:31] otherwise you never overcome it amen
[1:03:35] praise the lord let's talk a few minutes
[1:03:39] on
[1:03:40] people that really don't want
[1:03:43] god's deliverance they actually don't
[1:03:46] think
[1:03:47] they're uh that they don't they don't
[1:03:49] even think that they're
[1:03:52] captives people don't you know they
[1:03:55] don't think they're even captive
[1:03:59] and yet they're prisoners how many we
[1:04:02] were all in pot devil's pawn job
[1:04:03] the whole world is in the devil's pawn
[1:04:05] shop the way only way that you're
[1:04:07] getting out of that pawn shop
[1:04:08] if is if god comes and pays the price
[1:04:11] for you
[1:04:12] how many knows he came and bought us
[1:04:13] with a price we are paul with a price
[1:04:16] and he came and paid that price he
[1:04:18] purchased us and delivered us out of
[1:04:20] that pawn shop
[1:04:22] we needed deliverance everybody needs
[1:04:24] deliverance
[1:04:26] he is the god of deliverance
[1:04:29] in many battles but listen when jesus
[1:04:32] was on earth
[1:04:34] he said this and people then the
[1:04:37] pharisees didn't think that they needed
[1:04:39] deliverance he didn't think they were in
[1:04:42] bondage
[1:04:43] then said jesus to those jews which
[1:04:45] believed on him
[1:04:47] if ye continue in my word then are you
[1:04:49] my disciples in need
[1:04:52] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:04:54] shall set you
[1:04:55] afraid huh
[1:04:59] how did this how did the pharisees
[1:05:02] respond
[1:05:03] they answered him we be abraham's seed
[1:05:07] and we were never in bondage to any man
[1:05:11] huh pride
[1:05:15] they didn't want jesus how many know
[1:05:17] they didn't need jesus they didn't think
[1:05:18] they needed jesus
[1:05:19] they didn't need his word they didn't
[1:05:21] they hated jesus
[1:05:23] how's how is god ever going to deliver
[1:05:25] somebody that
[1:05:26] doesn't feel like they have need of
[1:05:28] deliverance
[1:05:29] the only way to get deliverance is when
[1:05:31] you recognize you have a need
[1:05:33] of deliverance you know you want it
[1:05:36] without
[1:05:37] you want it above everything else you
[1:05:38] want more than anything else
[1:05:40] you want deliverance when you've got
[1:05:42] that passion like that god will deliver
[1:05:44] you
[1:05:45] amen
[1:05:48] oh my
[1:05:52] listen isn't this something how
[1:05:53] sometimes god won't deliver us when he
[1:05:54] we think he should
[1:05:56] we think we got the faith to be
[1:05:58] delivered and he still doesn't
[1:06:00] and we have to hold on and keep
[1:06:02] believing keep holding on
[1:06:04] keep believing keep holding on keep
[1:06:05] believing isn't that right
[1:06:07] and then eventually he dies sooner or
[1:06:10] later he does
[1:06:11] he will i believe he's to build
[1:06:14] character
[1:06:15] amen all right listen to this
[1:06:20] and how sayest thou that ye shall be
[1:06:23] made free
[1:06:25] we're never in bondage and jesus
[1:06:27] answered them
[1:06:29] should i say in vain because it never
[1:06:32] did do them any good
[1:06:35] verily verily i say unto you whosoever
[1:06:38] committeth sin
[1:06:39] is the servant of sin
[1:06:42] yeah you may not be in bondage to this
[1:06:45] one the other even though romans are
[1:06:46] abolished about romans
[1:06:48] but listen what he was trying to say i
[1:06:50] don't care you are sinners
[1:06:51] you're bound to your earthly carnal
[1:06:54] nature
[1:06:55] you're born in sin and as long as you're
[1:06:58] in sin
[1:06:58] you're a servant of sin you're a
[1:07:00] prisoner of it
[1:07:03] but i'm here to set you free i'm here to
[1:07:06] set you free from your sin from your
[1:07:08] condemnation
[1:07:11] but they didn't want no deliverance
[1:07:14] they didn't need him they don't need god
[1:07:17] people don't need god
[1:07:22] i don't know about you but all of
[1:07:23] humanity needs god
[1:07:26] they just don't realize they need god
[1:07:30] many religious organizations
[1:07:32] denominations they don't think they need
[1:07:33] god
[1:07:35] they're out there and they're really
[1:07:36] without god but they don't know it
[1:07:39] and is that sad never to be delivered
[1:07:42] same way with cain how many knows that
[1:07:44] came
[1:07:45] he didn't need god he didn't want god
[1:07:48] god offered him mercy
[1:07:50] he offered him deliverance he offered
[1:07:52] him forgiveness
[1:07:54] huh but because it didn't come his way
[1:07:56] he didn't want it
[1:07:57] so we find that many people in the world
[1:08:00] today
[1:08:00] don't feel that they have need to be
[1:08:03] delivered
[1:08:05] they feel like they delivered already
[1:08:07] that's a terrible
[1:08:09] state to be in a terrible place
[1:08:12] to be amen because tommy knows the whole
[1:08:16] creation the whole world
[1:08:20] needs deliverance and all of creation
[1:08:24] is groaning you
[1:08:28] and i are groaning

[1:09:17] for the earnest exp expectation chapter
[1:09:19] 8 of romans
[1:09:20] verse 19 for the earnest expectation of
[1:09:23] the creature waiteth for the
[1:09:25] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:09:27] for the creature was made subject to
[1:09:29] vanity
[1:09:30] not willingly but by reason of him who
[1:09:32] also has subjected the same in hope
[1:09:36] because the creature itself also shall
[1:09:39] be delivered from the bondage
[1:09:43] of corruption amen
[1:09:47] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:09:49] children of god for we know that the
[1:09:51] whole creation groaneth
[1:09:53] and travail up in pain together until
[1:09:57] now
[1:09:58] amen and we ourselves grown within
[1:10:01] ourselves
[1:10:02] we have the holy ghost we've grown
[1:10:05] within ourselves waiting for the
[1:10:06] adoption to
[1:10:07] wit the redemption of this body
[1:10:11] we are looking for and waiting for god
[1:10:13] to deliver us
[1:10:15] from this vile body
[1:10:20] amen
[1:10:23] this body can never pull you the wrong
[1:10:25] way it can never think the wrong
[1:10:26] thoughts it can never accidentally do
[1:10:28] the wrong thing
[1:10:29] huh they bet this body does but
[1:10:33] we're looking for a body that don't do
[1:10:35] that this will always lead you to wrong
[1:10:37] we're looking for
[1:10:38] for that and as i think about this i
[1:10:40] tell you what
[1:10:41] one of the most one of the things i
[1:10:43] really hate to see my

[1:11:35] the growing and the pain and the
[1:11:37] hospitals and
[1:11:38] all of this that's going on isn't that
[1:11:40] right

[1:11:44] relief
[1:11:45] when our lord shall come back to earth

[1:11:48] when this whole creation tree baleth
[1:11:50] waiting to be delivered
[1:11:52] from this bondage of corruption amen

[1:11:58] absolute take the deliverance of
[1:12:01] almighty god
[1:12:02] to change our bodies the changes in our
[1:12:06] they're going to have to be a miracle
[1:12:07] happen god's going to have to do it or

[1:12:10] left sitting right here amen

[1:12:16] looking forward to getting out of this
[1:12:17] old
[1:12:18] house oh my let me just read you a
[1:12:21] couple quotes this is the only quote i
[1:12:22] got
[1:12:23] but talking about this old pest house
[1:12:25] that we're living in
[1:12:27] this place that we're looking to be
[1:12:28] delivered out of
[1:12:30] amen my
[1:12:34] now we find this life holds all kinds of
[1:12:38] evils
[1:12:39] so therefore the life that is to come
[1:12:41] won't have it
[1:12:42] this one has lust sickness death
[1:12:47] because what is it it's not the house
[1:12:49] that he's going
[1:12:50] to prepare amen
[1:12:53] this is a pest house
[1:12:56] how many knows what a pest house is sure
[1:12:59] that's what you're living in
[1:13:01] a pest house is where they put all the
[1:13:04] diseased
[1:13:05] people
[1:13:08] huh well that's just what sin done to us
[1:13:12] amen right that's where sin put us put
[1:13:15] us in the hole put us in the pest house
[1:13:18] amen let anyone else come
[1:13:21] amen they wouldn't they won't let
[1:13:22] anybody else come into that pest house
[1:13:24] because
[1:13:25] there was all kinds of germs flying
[1:13:27] around in there just reminds me of
[1:13:29] looking at the
[1:13:30] world with everybody wearing a mask
[1:13:33] we're living in a great big giant world
[1:13:35] pest house
[1:13:36] we're putting masks on and everything
[1:13:38] else social distancing not trying not to
[1:13:40] catch the germs that's flying around
[1:13:43] what a world you reckon we'll write any
[1:13:46] masks over there
[1:13:48] no eyes are resounding no
[1:13:52] no masks over there folks
[1:13:55] how about social distancing over there
[1:13:58] no
[1:13:58] socialism no more sickness no more germs
[1:14:03] hey i'm not so much you know covets a
[1:14:05] terrible thing but
[1:14:06] all kinds of other things that kill
[1:14:08] millions of peoples every year
[1:14:12] amen
[1:14:14] i'm here to tell you humanity our brains
[1:14:18] people's brains don't work right i know
[1:14:20] i'm on the internet but
[1:14:21] you think about they do all this for
[1:14:23] covet right
[1:14:25] but then they'll let you smoke up
[1:14:27] cigarettes that kill hundreds and
[1:14:29] thousands of people every
[1:14:30] all the time they'll let them take
[1:14:32] things like that that kill them
[1:14:34] isn't that right real good logic we got
[1:14:38] you kill a mama with a baby in the womb
[1:14:40] and it's double homicide
[1:14:42] but if a mama kills it it's not double
[1:14:44] homicide it's okay
[1:14:46] even after it's out of the womb
[1:14:47] breathing hello
[1:14:49] let me tell you something somebody's got
[1:14:52] brain damage
[1:14:53] that's not even right thinking all right
[1:14:56] that's not logical
[1:14:58] it's not justice for sure in a court of
[1:15:00] law it's not justice at all
[1:15:02] that right for one to get charged with
[1:15:05] it and the other one can do it and
[1:15:06] there's not a problem that's not justice
[1:15:09] but that's our thinking the old pest
[1:15:11] house people's gone completely yes
[1:15:14] that's right
[1:15:15] insane amen i don't know how much
[1:15:18] long facebook will leave is beyond there
[1:15:20] but there's other places we can go
[1:15:21] that's all right
[1:15:23] huh but that's right but hey how many
[1:15:27] knows
[1:15:27] it's getting close to going and i don't
[1:15:29] know about you but i'm looking for
