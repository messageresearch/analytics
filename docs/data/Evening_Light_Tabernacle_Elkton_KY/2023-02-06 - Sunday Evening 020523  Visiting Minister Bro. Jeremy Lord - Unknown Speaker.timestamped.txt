[24:04] Lord again
[24:05] hey man I want to thank you so much for
[24:07] your warm welcome and just a beautiful
[24:09] place to be you know that's it feels
[24:12] like home and that's the way it should
[24:13] be where the spirit of the Lord is it
[24:15] should feel like home no matter where we
[24:17] go and I just praise the Lord and you
[24:20] can fill the pull and that's what it is
[24:22] at our church people will pull and and
[24:24] that's what you know that's it's you
[24:27] that are is operating the gift
[24:30] if we just sit and uh not really paying
[24:33] attention you know it's we don't get as
[24:36] much out and it's because the Lord wants
[24:38] to feed us but he wants us also to pull
[24:40] and
[24:42] I
[24:43] praise the Lord for that because I feel
[24:45] at our church I feel it at several
[24:46] churches but there's some Churches you
[24:47] go to and you don't feel that but praise
[24:50] the lord we feel that here amen well I
[24:53] have you stand too long let's turn to
[24:54] Ephesians chapter five
[24:57] Ephesians chapter five let's go to verse
[24:59] 31
[25:01] verse 31.
[25:06] it says for this cause
[25:08] shall a man leave his father and mother
[25:12] and shall be joined into his wife
[25:14] and they too shall be one flesh this is
[25:18] a great mystery but I speak concerning
[25:21] Christ and the church
[25:24] I'd like to speak tonight with the
[25:26] Lord's willing marriage but it's between
[25:29] Christ and the church natural types of
[25:32] spiritual
[25:33] but let's we are the church and we're
[25:35] getting ready to get married to Christ
[25:37] amen let's bow our heads precious
[25:39] Heavenly Father
[25:40] Lord we ask once again Lord Jesus that
[25:43] you will come and anoint your word Lord
[25:45] Jesus Lord these are scriptures that we
[25:47] have read Lord but your word is a Living
[25:50] Word Lord and therefore we always get
[25:53] something fresh and something new Lord
[25:55] out of it something that you have need
[25:57] for us today and Lord we're looking for
[25:59] that Lord and we ask you Lord Jesus for
[26:01] your
[26:03] you're that you add the blessings to the
[26:05] reading your word in Jesus Christ's name
[26:07] amen amen you may be seated
[26:12] this is a
[26:14] something that I I was thinking on the
[26:16] other week and
[26:17] you know how close we are
[26:20] to actually the Lord coming back
[26:22] and to meet him at the Lord started
[26:24] leading me to to other scriptures and
[26:26] there was a a couple in our church that
[26:29] they recently got married probably in
[26:31] last summer
[26:33] but there's things that you do
[26:35] to prepare for a wedding
[26:38] and it's the same
[26:40] thing that we we have
[26:45] made herself ready there is a
[26:48] preparation the location the
[26:51] flowers the the Gown the hairdo the food
[26:56] there's so many things and it doesn't
[26:58] just happen overnight
[27:00] it takes time to prepare for that well
[27:03] it's the same thing with us
[27:05] it takes time to get into position where
[27:09] and the reason the bride does it and the
[27:12] reason we the bride are doing it is to
[27:14] make him our husband happy to be
[27:17] pleasing to him why do we wear the
[27:19] things we do why do we dress the way we
[27:21] do to be pleasing to
[27:23] damn you know there's there's many
[27:25] people that have asked me at work that
[27:28] they don't know much about God but why
[27:31] do you wear dresses and why do you have
[27:32] long hair and not me but you know my
[27:34] wife so
[27:35] yeah I don't wear dresses at work don't
[27:37] don't get it
[27:39] but anyways
[27:41] um
[27:43] and I and I say and I always use it as a
[27:45] natural type that if I know there is
[27:48] something that my wife hates
[27:52] then I won't do that
[27:54] I just won't I said otherwise I'm not a
[27:56] good husband and I said in vice versa if
[27:59] she knows that I do not like a certain
[28:02] thing she won't do that because she
[28:05] loves me
[28:06] and and the scripture says it's an
[28:08] Abomination and that means that
[28:10] something that God hates
[28:14] and I said
[28:16] so he hates it says that's why we do it
[28:18] we don't do it out of uh he hates it so
[28:22] why would I do it and they look at me
[28:24] like huh
[28:25] you know there's we
[28:30] so blessed
[28:31] the things that we know there's basic
[28:34] ABCs that people don't know
[28:37] I I uh there's a friend of mine from
[28:39] high school
[28:41] that he went away and uh you know he
[28:44] lived all around the country's life and
[28:45] and his dad wanted to start
[28:48] a little men's
[28:50] group
[28:51] to kind of help him you know get back on
[28:54] his feet and he was wanting to get some
[28:55] Christian Brothers well they they're
[28:56] Westlands and so
[28:58] and he asked me hey do you want to you
[29:00] want to join this manager and I said
[29:01] absolutely you know we're going to talk
[29:03] about God let's do it now there's a
[29:05] Catholic in there there's a non-dination
[29:08] non-denominational uh brother that has
[29:10] his Doctorate Divinity and there's a
[29:12] there's a couple lutherans no no not
[29:14] lose Westlands and then there's some
[29:15] some other so it's a mix you know and
[29:17] and we start going and there's things
[29:20] that you just you gotta go easy with
[29:23] you can't feed a baby meat you have to
[29:26] feed go start you know that's the thing
[29:29] as we why
[29:32] wise as a why is that the serpent but
[29:35] harmless as a dove and so you start
[29:37] going with the
[29:39] and they've asked me to delete some
[29:41] things
[29:44] appraisal Lord we started how's that
[29:47] sure I'll bring something you know and
[29:49] uh and they start bringing serpent seed
[29:51] and that brother Branham hasn't taught
[29:54] that you can't
[29:55] put through the Bible I don't have to
[29:58] quote brother Branham to prove a
[30:01] Doctrine
[30:02] and if you do then watch out
[30:06] because you might be trying to make
[30:08] brother man say something that's not
[30:10] right whatever he said he goes take it
[30:11] back to the word
[30:13] so
[30:14] these are people that you know they
[30:16] don't even have they don't even know uh
[30:18] really who Jesus is they still you know
[30:21] father son Holy Ghost
[30:23] and and I'm like Lord and every time I
[30:25] go I Lord just make me salty I don't
[30:28] want to hurt him but I want to make them
[30:30] dig
[30:32] and praise the Lord Slowly by slowly it
[30:35] seems like things are turning around and
[30:37] we got to talking about baptism last
[30:39] time because there was somebody in our
[30:41] church that was getting baptized last
[30:42] week and so last time we got to talking
[30:44] about baptism
[30:46] foreign
[30:49] and the the doctor of divinity says
[30:52] after we got done he goes you know
[30:54] I've been baptizing wrong I'm like
[30:56] praise the Lord he goes and I was like
[30:59] what do I do I said just from now on
[31:01] baptized correctly
[31:03] go from now on Lord Jesus Christ instead
[31:05] of father son Holy Ghost and and I was
[31:08] so rejoicing and so enthused because I
[31:11] start seeing things happen and it's been
[31:13] a year
[31:14] but I could get in a way and start
[31:17] pushing things and choke them all out
[31:19] and make them leave no we don't want to
[31:21] do that
[31:22] they they need to get ready too but it's
[31:25] not me getting them ready it says the
[31:29] bride has made herself ready so that's
[31:33] the thing is they have to have the
[31:35] willingness the desire to get themselves
[31:38] ready
[31:39] and so we can't push somebody to get
[31:41] them ready but we can well this is how
[31:44] the Lord has showed me and and uh and
[31:47] Away you go and you can't so you can't
[31:50] push anything else
[31:51] but when you truly fall in love with
[31:55] Christ and that's the key
[31:57] then everything else becomes easy
[32:00] it's not a have to so I want to our
[32:03] brother was talking about it wants to
[32:04] come to church once the true Christian
[32:06] wants to be around those it's absolutely
[32:08] true
[32:10] and
[32:11] and
[32:12] you don't there's a bro
[32:14] brother that
[32:16] we talk and doing you know he's ready
[32:18] you know you need you need friends and
[32:21] the people you hang out with matters
[32:23] so I want to hang out with somebody who
[32:25] is a Christian more than somebody that's
[32:26] just of the world
[32:28] and and he wants more of God and he
[32:31] seems to have a desire now brother
[32:32] Graham always said
[32:34] if you want to become a better Christian
[32:35] read and pray it's as simple as that
[32:38] read and pray read and pray and I also
[32:42] said man it's important to get to church
[32:44] but I have never
[32:46] pushed it because I
[32:48] want him to come to church
[32:50] because he wants to
[32:53] because you can make somebody feel bad
[32:55] and get them in the door but now are
[32:57] they there because they're pleasing you
[32:59] or are they there to please God
[33:02] because if they're there to please you
[33:03] it really doesn't do them much good
[33:05] but if they're there to please God then
[33:07] they're there with a different
[33:08] perspective and praise the Lord last
[33:09] Sunday he was in church and I mean it
[33:13] almost made me cry because I was like oh
[33:15] there's another soul I can I can see him
[33:18] working you know and as long as God is
[33:21] still on The Mercy Seat he's still
[33:23] drawing people too
[33:26] the moment that he leaves the mercy
[33:28] there's no hope left for this world
[33:32] but you know what we are his we are his
[33:36] examples here
[33:37] we we are his ambassadors so what we're
[33:40] supposed to do is witness Christ and
[33:41] bring him in Lord help us
[33:44] now there's different types of brides we
[33:47] are in a very we live in a very selfish
[33:49] world the world has become selfish and
[33:51] so self-centered and it's all about me
[33:54] and they call him Bridezillas you ever
[33:56] heard that term where they they're like
[33:58] a Godzilla but they're just it's all
[34:00] about them this is my day this is this
[34:03] oh the flowers were perfect you know now
[34:07] put that in a spiritual I don't want to
[34:09] be a bridezilla to Christ
[34:12] we can make it all about us and not
[34:14] about Christ
[34:15] oh and and I everything I try to look
[34:18] back at myself
[34:19] Lord do I complain
[34:22] you know I think that's what the
[34:24] children of Israel were doing when the
[34:25] Lord had let him delivered him for me
[34:28] Egypt
[34:30] through the Red Sea and then they
[34:32] started complaining
[34:35] then
[34:37] children they don't have to be baby they
[34:40] don't want you to well done my faithful
[34:42] servant well done you know and I'm like
[34:45] Lord I want to be where where you can
[34:47] you can be proud have you considered my
[34:50] servant job
[34:51] boy have you considered my servant
[34:54] whoever
[34:55] oh my the the Lord has that much
[34:58] confidence in you
[34:59] to put you as a a bait in front of Satan
[35:03] that's what he did with job
[35:05] and
[35:07] Satan was like
[35:09] well you protecting this Lord put a
[35:11] hedge around
[35:13] Germany today at school we should pray
[35:16] that I still pray that to this day I
[35:17] want that edge around her don't you want
[35:19] Satan to complain
[35:20] lord I can't even touch him because he
[35:22] put a hedge around him like yes he does
[35:24] Amen Lord don't remove the Hedge don't
[35:27] let me get ahead in high-minded oh I
[35:30] pass every test we may not have really
[35:32] had a true test
[35:33] job had a truth test
[35:36] oh my
[35:40] and the lord taketh away
[35:42] blessed be the is that going to come out
[35:45] of my mouth
[35:47] Lord
[35:49] I wanted to
[35:51] we don't know exactly what we're going
[35:53] to do to we're put in that situation and
[35:54] Lord I don't really want to be put in
[35:56] that situation
[35:58] but that's where the true you know
[36:00] brother Graham was told when he when he
[36:02] left his wife died and somebody said is
[36:06] your religion still holding on you he
[36:07] goes no it's holding on to me I'm not
[36:10] holding on to it
[36:11] and that's exactly exactly right Christ
[36:14] holds on to us during that time we don't
[36:16] hold on to him it's it's got to be
[36:18] Christ deep inside
[36:19] you truly find out what's there
[36:22] when you go through trials
[36:24] Lord help us I don't want to be
[36:26] bridezilla okay so in Matthew chapter 19
[36:30] verse 4 there's a lot of scriptures that
[36:32] we go through that are concerned and
[36:34] married
[36:35] but he said he answered and said unto
[36:37] them have you not read that he which
[36:40] made them at the beginning made them
[36:43] male and female
[36:44] that'd be something for the world to
[36:46] hear today
[36:47] I can't even tell the gender
[36:49] I mean
[36:51] how crazy
[36:54] are we I mean who would have thought it
[36:56] would get that bad and I've wondered I
[36:59] wanted to brother Brandon actually saw
[37:00] some of the things that are going on
[37:02] today and that's why he was like so no
[37:05] way you know there's this no way and it
[37:09] is absolutely by God's grace that any of
[37:13] us stay especially the kids with
[37:16] everything that's at their fingertips
[37:17] that weren't at our fingertips Lord help
[37:20] me to pray for my children to keep them
[37:23] and it's only by God's grace that he
[37:25] held on to them amen
[37:28] verse 5 and Matthew 19.
[37:31] and he said
[37:32] for this cause shall a man cleave
[37:36] shall a man leave father and mother and
[37:39] shall cleave to his wife and they shall
[37:41] Twain be one flesh verse six wherefore
[37:45] they are no more Twain but one flesh
[37:48] what therefore God has joined together
[37:51] let no man put asunder now remember the
[37:54] other scripture we just read it says
[37:55] speaking concerning Christ in the church
[37:59] what God has joined together now he did
[38:02] it he's talking naturally but Also
[38:04] spiritually he's joined together we are
[38:06] joined together with him in Heavenly
[38:07] places amen let no man put asunder
[38:12] and there will be times where men will
[38:14] try to come in you know what the
[38:17] scripture says they'll be sneaking in
[38:18] you know and wolves and Men I mean
[38:21] wolves and Lamb's clothing
[38:25] amen
[38:26] and and and Naturally Speaking there's
[38:29] been things that uh you know like uh
[38:32] people want to brag on their husband or
[38:34] brag on their wife and maybe making
[38:37] somebody else discontent with their
[38:39] marriage
[38:43] and so
[38:46] drag on her wives well my husband does
[38:48] the dishes
[38:49] it'd be as long as it says oh man he
[38:52] sweeps the floors he does this he does
[38:53] that it's great
[38:56] but be careful because I think of it
[38:59] more like Facebook where everybody's
[39:01] look look how great our life is and you
[39:03] don't really see the things behind the
[39:04] scene
[39:05] and there's always something and Satan
[39:08] can use that to start making you
[39:10] discontent in your current marriage or
[39:12] relationship and don't let that happen
[39:15] love conquers all amen everybody is
[39:19] different I am not the same as brother
[39:21] Byler our our relationship with our
[39:24] wives are probably completely different
[39:26] but it works for us and and that's what
[39:29] what God has joined together
[39:32] let no man
[39:34] put us under
[39:35] now same thing with Christianity with a
[39:38] spiritually speaking it's between you
[39:40] and God it's not between between you and
[39:43] your parents and God or you and your
[39:45] that's during God and you and whatever
[39:48] you want to say it's between you and God
[39:52] so there
[39:53] fore you have to have that personal
[39:56] relationship that nobody else can butt
[39:58] into
[39:59] now
[40:01] we can spiritually same thing with
[40:03] husband as a wise
[40:05] your wife has a wife you need it
[40:07] personally
[40:10] to Christ
[40:11] as a husband you need a personal
[40:13] relationship
[40:14] with Christ now when you join together
[40:16] and you mesh and you meet oh what a bond
[40:19] that is I don't know how
[40:22] they're a Christian
[40:24] because part of being a Christian is
[40:27] forgiveness and understanding and all
[40:30] this and and you are two different
[40:32] people that you become in one house and
[40:34] it is tough to coincide a lot of times
[40:37] but you know what my wife may get on my
[40:40] nerves sometimes and I may get on
[40:42] hurting her sometimes
[40:43] but it's up to us to reconcile those
[40:45] things
[40:46] now we
[40:49] right praise the Lord
[40:52] we can do that
[40:54] that we can reconcile that but that's
[40:56] why I
[40:58] know there's things
[41:00] in my life and it's called iniquity
[41:02] that God doesn't like and I have to run
[41:05] and reconcile that back to God because I
[41:07] pray every day Paul said I Die daily
[41:12] excuse me because he doesn't know some
[41:15] of the things that he's doing that are
[41:17] not pleasing the Lord can you imagine if
[41:19] the Lord showed you absolutely
[41:21] everything that wasn't pleased to him
[41:22] right now it quit
[41:25] there's no way
[41:27] but he's a good god he's a gentle God he
[41:30] shows you a little bit
[41:31] you gotta work on that just perfectly
[41:34] it's it's a have you heard that Holy
[41:37] Spirit rain down it's it's like a soft
[41:43] gentle rain it's not beating the plants
[41:46] he wants you to he wants you to thrive
[41:48] but you've got to get watered oh my my
[41:50] Lord I just want to be to be serving the
[41:53] lord such a beautiful thing now let's go
[41:56] to uh
[41:57] Revelations
[42:02] we've quoted this but let's read it
[42:04] Revelations chapter 19 and uh let's
[42:06] start with verse 6.
[42:08] it says give you a second to get there I
[42:11] always start too early
[42:13] it says and I heard as it were a voice
[42:17] of a great multitude and as a voice of
[42:21] many Waters and as a voice of Mighty
[42:23] thundering saying hallelujah
[42:26] for the Lord God omnipotent greatness
[42:28] verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and
[42:33] give honor to him for the marriage of
[42:35] the Lamb is come and his wife
[42:38] has made herself ready
[42:41] oh my let's go to keep on verse 8.
[42:46] excuse me
[42:47] and to her was granted that she should
[42:49] be a raid and fine linen can you imagine
[42:52] that wedding garment when you're
[42:54] thinking of a fine linen I'm thinking of
[42:57] something that's oh it just feels so
[42:59] almost like Silk and you look at it it's
[43:01] like oh that's so beautiful
[43:03] fine linen and yet it breathes you know
[43:06] it doesn't it's not something that that
[43:08] makes you so hot it's just because it's
[43:10] fine linen and it says clean and white
[43:14] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[43:19] of Saints oh
[43:23] who is our righteousness
[43:25] Jesus
[43:27] Jesus is what we're clothed with Jesus
[43:30] is divine linen it's all about Jesus
[43:36] amen we when we had communions today
[43:39] and
[43:40] there is no way that any of us
[43:44] Jesus that he makes us worthy not
[43:49] looking at us us he is looking at your
[43:54] perfect sacrifice
[43:56] oh my but as long as you got to stay
[43:58] under that perfect side and claim I
[44:00] claim the blood that Jesus shed for me
[44:03] that blood oh my that cleansing blood
[44:06] that is what it is and it's and it's
[44:09] something that I don't ever want to take
[44:10] for granted it seems like sometimes we
[44:13] take the blood of Jesus for granted
[44:16] I mean we we know Calvary but it doesn't
[44:19] seem like it gets preached very much
[44:20] which I understand but if still need
[44:25] to be talked about
[44:27] because Calvary is why we are here oh
[44:31] it's a beautiful
[44:32] Lord help us to be oh my the wedding
[44:35] garment is is
[44:38] Jesus now
[44:43] keep your place there because line up
[44:45] online you can take a scripture and like
[44:48] oh this scripture right here fits right
[44:49] in
[44:50] this scripture right here fits right in
[44:52] so I'm going to fit this right in in
[44:53] Isaiah 64.
[44:56] it says but we are all as an unclean
[44:59] thing in our righteousness are sorry our
[45:03] righteousness are as filthy rags which
[45:05] do Fade but remember it's his
[45:09] righteousness that we're cleansed with
[45:10] so
[45:12] verse um we'll go to Jeremiah Jeremiah
[45:14] fits in here Jeremiah 33 15 and 16 it
[45:18] says in those days at that time
[45:20] I will cause the branch of righteousness
[45:22] to grow upon the David and he shall
[45:25] execute judgment and write
[45:27] in the land verse 16.
[45:29] in those days shall Judah be saved in
[45:32] Jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is
[45:34] the name wherein she I love that wherein
[45:37] she shall be called the Lord our
[45:40] righteousness
[45:42] and that's what it has to be the Lord
[45:45] are righteous not all righteousness
[45:47] because ours is his filthy rags but it's
[45:49] his righteousness
[45:51] so where does pride ever come in
[45:54] shouldn't it's not your righteousness
[45:56] it's his righteousness well by Godly I'm
[45:58] in the message that shouldn't even be
[46:00] part of it praise the Lord the Lord has
[46:03] showed me and he has blessed me I thank
[46:05] the Lord that I'm in a message but it's
[46:07] not going to make me look down on
[46:08] somebody that's not because you know
[46:10] what they could be in the message too
[46:12] they could be part of bride's childhood
[46:15] just not haven't seen it yet so we need
[46:17] to be about our father's business and
[46:18] and invite them and Lord help us to
[46:21] invite everybody who can because it's
[46:25] Christ that we are inviting them to it's
[46:27] not it's not just
[46:29] some Churches
[46:31] Christ himself amen
[46:34] brother Branham as many times I you know
[46:37] brother Brandon had a pretty good sense
[46:38] of humor because there's brothers that
[46:40] they were questioning hey why did you
[46:42] tell them to to stay in the Methodist
[46:44] Church you know stay where they were and
[46:47] he said well if they really got a hold
[46:49] of God he goes they won't stay there
[46:51] long because they'll kick him out and I
[46:53] thought that's exactly right because
[46:56] they can't feed on that carrying anymore
[46:58] now they got a different they had a
[47:00] nature change their sheep they got to
[47:02] eat good food and and so they're going
[47:04] to try to
[47:07] hey that's wrong we the scripture says
[47:10] this and as a system they won't it won't
[47:14] change
[47:15] but and
[47:17] and and so that's what we have to do is
[47:21] just start searching for individuals
[47:23] because and you get into Christ and let
[47:26] them go to the church they want to
[47:27] because if they really get to Christ
[47:31] they won't stay there very long
[47:34] amen so don't get down when you're like
[47:36] I led them to Christ at work
[47:38] but yet they still go to this if it's
[47:40] truly Christ
[47:41] then they won't
[47:44] be thirsty okay so verse 9 back in
[47:48] Revelations chapter 19.
[47:51] and he says that to me blessed are they
[47:53] which are called into the marriage
[47:55] supper of the lamb and he said unto me
[47:58] these are the true sayings of God oh my
[48:02] just to be invited
[48:04] you know he has come and die that's a
[48:07] song that we sang he has the table
[48:09] spread for the saints of God
[48:11] not our
[48:12] fed
[48:15] he invites of people come and dine oh we
[48:19] truly are blessed
[48:21] and if
[48:23] Ephesians chapter 1
[48:26] verse 22 kind of just going to go
[48:27] through some scriptures quickly it says
[48:29] Ephesians 1 20 feet
[48:31] and gave him to be the head over all
[48:34] things to the church which is his body
[48:37] the fullness of him that uh filleth all
[48:40] in all
[48:42] did you know that we are his fullness it
[48:45] says which is the body the fullness of
[48:48] him
[48:50] he
[48:51] isn't complete without us
[48:55] amen but he has given us he and he are
[48:58] part of it it's him
[49:01] that whoever the church is fitly joined
[49:03] together
[49:04] amen he's the master builder I just want
[49:06] to be a part of the church let him Place
[49:08] me where he wants me to be
[49:10] placed I just want to be a part of the
[49:12] church
[49:13] amen let's go to
[49:16] Ephesians chapter 5.
[49:21] verse 22 Ephesians 5 22 couple chapters
[49:23] over
[49:24] now remember we're talking about Christ
[49:26] in the church
[49:27] it's also naturally but wise submit
[49:30] yourselves into your own husbands now
[49:32] Christ is our husband
[49:34] and we're supposed to submit to his will
[49:37] I don't want my will to be done I want
[49:39] his will to be done
[49:41] and it's the same thing why
[49:43] submit yourselves to your husband and
[49:45] adds unto the Lord for the husband is
[49:47] the head of the wife even as Christ is
[49:50] the head of the church now
[49:52] you know really brother Byler is not
[49:54] even head of the church because his head
[49:56] is Christ and as long as Christ this is
[49:59] head then he is a shepherd of this flock
[50:02] but all all in all Christ is the head of
[50:06] the church because he's supposed to be
[50:08] the leading brother Byler leading
[50:09] whoever so then then it takes a lot of
[50:12] pressure off of brother Byler because
[50:14] now he's like Father what do you have
[50:16] done what do you what sermon do you want
[50:18] preach how do you want me to handle this
[50:19] situation because Christ is the head
[50:23] Lord help us to make him keep him the
[50:26] head
[50:27] amen
[50:30] therefore as the church is subject I say
[50:33] right here verse 23 for the husband is
[50:35] the head of the wife even as Christ is
[50:37] ahead of
[50:38] the church
[50:39] and he is the savior of the body verse
[50:42] 24. therefore as the church is subject
[50:44] unto Christ so let the wise be to their
[50:47] own husband and everything husbands love
[50:49] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[50:51] church and gave himself for it now
[50:53] that's a lot of love
[50:56] died for us
[50:59] and Naturally Speaking he's telling us
[51:01] as husbands
[51:03] you're supposed to love your wife enough
[51:05] to die for her because that love needs
[51:07] to be there because love conquers all
[51:10] and and if you truly love your wife and
[51:13] wives love love your husbands what what
[51:17] a marriage it is
[51:18] it's a marriage of Peace instead of
[51:20] contention
[51:21] and and and there's a lot of contentious
[51:25] marriages and what it means is Christ to
[51:28] be more of the focus
[51:30] because if Christ becomes more of the
[51:32] focus
[51:33] the house and everything about it become
[51:37] Falls more in line
[51:38] amen
[51:41] verse 26.
[51:44] okay so Christ gave himself for it verse
[51:47] 26 why did he give himself that he might
[51:51] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[51:54] of Water by the word
[51:57] oh I love that he did it so he could
[52:00] cleanse us and why verse 27 says
[52:03] that he might present it to himself I
[52:06] love that he did it to put he's washing
[52:09] us to present us to himself oh a
[52:13] glorious church not having spot or
[52:15] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[52:18] should be holy and without blemish
[52:21] now we know that Christ is the head
[52:25] amen and the church is the body
[52:28] but you think about it in my natural
[52:30] body what actually washes my body
[52:35] I will take the so
[52:36] open my hand
[52:39] and the body washes the body
[52:41] but the head tells me where to wash how
[52:46] much to us what soap to use
[52:49] everything about it we are perfecting
[52:52] the bride has made herself ready you are
[52:55] washing Yourself by what the head is
[52:58] telling you how to watch
[53:00] oh that's good isn't it oh your feet
[53:04] needs to be washed a little bit more you
[53:06] missed a spot over here
[53:07] and it
[53:09] dare say my hand to say nope I'm not
[53:12] doing it
[53:13] what power does that hand have over my
[53:15] mind
[53:16] that if truly we are part of Christ
[53:20] it'll just be watch your will Lord yes
[53:22] sir
[53:23] oh yes sir
[53:24] now I enjoy to hunt and and fish but
[53:30] when I'm sitting out hunting it takes me
[53:32] a long time
[53:33] but if I'm out there for four hours and
[53:36] it's really cool
[53:39] my core seems to get cold
[53:42] and I just when I get that cold when I
[53:45] when my core gets cold it takes a long
[53:48] time
[53:49] for me to warm up now I can go into a
[53:52] house at 70 degrees and sit there and
[53:54] I'm just hours later I'm still cold
[53:57] but I have found
[53:59] and if I go and take the hottest shower
[54:02] that I can and just stand there remember
[54:05] we're Washed by the Water of the word
[54:08] and there's a time in your life when you
[54:09] start feeling cold
[54:11] and you just sit there and do nothing
[54:15] it takes so long to feel like you get on
[54:17] fire again
[54:19] but if you go and immerse yourself get
[54:21] watched and just stand In the Heat of
[54:24] the word it'll warm you up to your core
[54:27] and it'll set you back on
[54:29] fire again
[54:31] oh my and I just thought Lord I want to
[54:34] be washed by your water of your word and
[54:36] he knows the temperature that you need
[54:38] he knows how long you need some of us
[54:40] might not take as long as others but
[54:43] that's that's all about the head control
[54:44] on the body now that's the thing is that
[54:47] our church may not act the exact same
[54:49] way your church is but as long as Christ
[54:51] is ahead of the church we're acting
[54:52] perfectly
[54:54] well they don't sing that song the same
[54:55] way but they're Worship in Christ
[54:58] oh my and that's the thing is you want
[55:00] to worship Christ but Christ
[55:02] as the
[55:05] as a pedestal he's the one that we're
[55:07] looking to he's everything and then all
[55:10] of our churches will react the same way
[55:12] even though each church is Sovereign
[55:14] within itself
[55:15] amen so it's just a great thing I just
[55:18] want to be a part of the body amen Lord
[55:20] help us
[55:21] now
[55:22] you don't need to turn here's one verse
[55:24] but it's in Hebrews 13 4. it says
[55:27] marriage is Honorable and all and the
[55:30] bed undefiled will whoremongers and
[55:32] adulterers God will judge
[55:34] now as long as we stay true to his word
[55:38] that the moment that we go outside and
[55:41] start checking something else like we're
[55:42] going to use let's say the denominations
[55:45] they left the word of God
[55:48] but they still wanted the name of
[55:50] Christian
[55:51] and the scripture calls them
[55:52] whoremongers and adulterers
[55:54] because they left the word they left
[55:56] Christ they left their first love
[55:58] but marriage between marriages
[56:01] honorable but we got to stay with Christ
[56:05] we got to stay with him first everything
[56:08] about it that's the only way it's
[56:10] honorable
[56:12] now
[56:14] uh in our church and it looks like in
[56:16] this church too we have several people
[56:20] who are you know getting close to the
[56:23] marriage in age
[56:25] and I can't stress enough how important
[56:27] it is the choosing of your mate
[56:31] sets up the rest of your life
[56:33] the characters
[56:35] I mean the looks can fade out I mean oh
[56:38] he Combs his hair in such a way no she
[56:40] looks so pretty
[56:42] yes but looks fade hair falls out you
[56:46] know and
[56:48] but if they
[56:49] truly love the Lord with all their heart
[56:53] now you got a mate for life
[56:57] and that's what you look for
[56:59] I just can't they have to choose Jesus
[57:01] first they have to be in love with Jesus
[57:03] brother Branham says it this way in
[57:04] choosing another bride
[57:06] he's again he said again the kind of a
[57:09] woman that a man will choose now I'm
[57:11] going to add the kind
[57:14] of of a man a woman will choose even
[57:17] though he uses a man here I think it
[57:18] goes both ways okay again the kind of a
[57:21] woman that a man would choose to shows
[57:24] truly what's in him
[57:26] a woman reflects what's the man when she
[57:29] chooses for her um for her as a wife
[57:32] it shows what's down in him no matter
[57:35] what he says outside
[57:38] what what he married
[57:41] that is a true thing
[57:44] watch what we marry watch look for
[57:46] Christ
[57:48] look for Christ that brother that buddy
[57:50] of mine that we started the
[57:52] the men's group on
[57:54] he said that
[57:56] hey that his wife that they got married
[57:59] he said it's like a light switch flipped
[58:01] and she started acting differently
[58:04] and I thought oh my
[58:08] and it
[58:09] it was just a horrible horrible
[58:12] situation to be in and and he he was
[58:15] just that's about drove him to suicide
[58:18] and it was and I thought the wife that
[58:22] you marry
[58:24] it makes so much difference now
[58:27] I am not perfect at all
[58:30] my wife is a help mate to me and I'm
[58:34] supposed to be a help mate to her there
[58:36] are days
[58:38] well I'm just like oh I don't want to go
[58:41] to church tonight
[58:43] you ever felt that way I have I have
[58:47] and in my world my wife has said
[58:51] we have to go we need to go
[58:53] that's a helpmate now
[58:56] vice versa there's been I know but we
[59:00] need to go it's our post of Duty let's
[59:02] go and by the time we get there and you
[59:05] start singing the songs of joy that
[59:07] Melancholy Spirit falls off
[59:10] and then you're excited to be at church
[59:14] but if you listen to your weak flesh You
[59:16] Never Would Have Made It help me now
[59:19] what if my wife
[59:22] I've been like no I don't want to go
[59:24] either they'll be okay what kind of help
[59:26] me that's that's not what Christ is
[59:28] talking about
[59:29] you know and and and and and we don't
[59:31] want to do that we want to we want to
[59:33] stand up and praise the Lord that when
[59:35] the days that I'm weak she's strong the
[59:36] days that she's weak I'm strong praise
[59:38] the Lord for that
[59:40] and Lord help us to keep get going that
[59:42] way to Christ now what you had kind of
[59:45] heard my testimony a little bit this
[59:46] morning about how I grew up in a message
[59:48] but Christ wasn't inside
[59:50] but I thank the Lord for Godly Parents
[59:54] because when the doors were open I had
[59:56] to be there
[59:57] and when I didn't think that I was
[59:59] paying attention I really there's a lot
[1:00:01] of times that I was just there
[1:00:03] but when I gave my heart to Christ and
[1:00:05] he started somebody asked me a question
[1:00:07] I knew the answer and I didn't know how
[1:00:09] I knew the answer
[1:00:10] because they took me to church all the
[1:00:13] time and there was a scene getting
[1:00:16] planted every time I was there and I
[1:00:18] just didn't know it
[1:00:20] it is so important kids when you're why
[1:00:23] they track I made a church there is a
[1:00:26] reason and praise the Lord for that
[1:00:29] because even when I didn't want to be
[1:00:31] there they made me go and as a parent we
[1:00:35] are responsible
[1:00:37] I think we'll be judged
[1:00:39] by that on the end you know at the end
[1:00:41] how we raised our kids
[1:00:43] and I want to be well done that good and
[1:00:46] faithful sir
[1:00:47] en you did a good job
[1:00:49] instead of
[1:00:52] whatever else it could be
[1:00:54] Lord help us
[1:00:56] so give us wisdom give us wisdom and and
[1:00:59] I'm telling you now my wife my wife my
[1:01:02] mom as a young kid she would say Jeremy
[1:01:05] you need to pray for your wife I'm like
[1:01:07] I'm 14 years old what do you mean my
[1:01:10] wife she goes you need to start praying
[1:01:11] for your wife she's out there somewhere
[1:01:13] you don't know what she's going through
[1:01:14] you need to pray for your wife
[1:01:17] and I got thinking about that what a
[1:01:19] wise thing to say
[1:01:21] and after I met my wife I told her that
[1:01:25] she was like oh I was really struggling
[1:01:27] at this point Lord had brought her
[1:01:29] across my mind my mom was praying for my
[1:01:31] wife
[1:01:32] before she
[1:01:33] met I'm telling you pray for your wives
[1:01:36] pray for your husbands if the Lord
[1:01:39] tarries
[1:01:41] you will be so thankful that you prayed
[1:01:43] for them versus just happenstance to
[1:01:46] find them the Lord knows how to bring us
[1:01:48] together amen
[1:01:50] amen so you don't need
[1:01:53] to turn here but in second Corinthians
[1:01:55] that says be not unequally yoked
[1:01:58] with unbelievers oh my and they want the
[1:02:02] kids to go to a different church or not
[1:02:04] at all
[1:02:06] I mean it could be a
[1:02:09] horrible
[1:02:11] I can see uh contention happening
[1:02:15] don't be unleakily yoked oh my
[1:02:19] Lord help us
[1:02:21] now scripture in Proverbs says whosoever
[1:02:23] findeth the wife findeth a good thing
[1:02:25] amen
[1:02:26] absolutely
[1:02:28] now remember Proverbs has a lot of
[1:02:30] little one-liners some of them are
[1:02:32] pretty funny about marriage and things
[1:02:34] some of them it's like I've read I'm
[1:02:36] like I don't have any idea what that
[1:02:38] means have you ever done that it's like
[1:02:40] Lord is this it's not open to me yet
[1:02:41] open it to me when you want to
[1:02:43] but I read this one looking about wives
[1:02:46] and it says it is better to dwell in a
[1:02:49] Wilderness than with a
[1:02:51] contentious and angry woman
[1:02:54] now we are the woman
[1:02:57] we are the bride
[1:03:00] Christ does not want to be yoked to a
[1:03:03] contentious always always whining always
[1:03:07] this angry
[1:03:09] why do they have so much of this why do
[1:03:11] they have so much of that he wants a
[1:03:13] sweet
[1:03:14] he wants his self
[1:03:16] and that's why he washes us
[1:03:19] to present us to himself allow yourself
[1:03:23] to be washed amen allow yourself to be
[1:03:27] changed
[1:03:28] amen
[1:03:30] now this is this is a good one the Lord
[1:03:33] I love it when you start studying for
[1:03:35] things
[1:03:36] and you end up going to some place you
[1:03:37] never thought you would go and and it
[1:03:39] leads you into other things
[1:03:41] it's just the Lord is just a beautiful
[1:03:43] beautiful this word is beautiful amen
[1:03:46] and so listen to Brother Brian I'm in
[1:03:48] the seven Church ages
[1:03:50] amen he was talking
[1:03:52] about in Revelations I'd sing as chapter
[1:03:54] one where it talks about when somebody
[1:03:57] was talking to John and he and he heard
[1:04:00] this voice and he turned to see who was
[1:04:02] talking to me and it was a Candlestick
[1:04:04] remember the can
[1:04:06] a little Spanish brother bran says right
[1:04:08] here he says what one like him
[1:04:11] his bride one like him he was looking at
[1:04:15] you and making our own mind we shouldn't
[1:04:17] be we should be speaking Jesus and
[1:04:21] Jesus there's a Christian
[1:04:24] all that what are they seeing they're
[1:04:26] seeing one liking to Christ
[1:04:28] they're seeing it and then the golden
[1:04:31] candlesticks were the seven Church ages
[1:04:32] and we're in the seventh Church age
[1:04:35] speaking Christ one liking to him oh I
[1:04:39] thought oh that's so beautiful
[1:04:41] Lord let me speak
[1:04:43] Christ let me be there
[1:04:46] now almost done but
[1:04:49] we can't talk about marriage without
[1:04:51] talking about Esther Esther's a
[1:04:54] beautiful book when it talks about
[1:04:55] marriage and one is looking let's go to
[1:04:57] Esther Esther chapter two we're gonna
[1:05:00] we're gonna spend
[1:05:02] quite a bit of time in chapter two
[1:05:06] amen
[1:05:07] actually this whole book
[1:05:10] of the Bible is beautiful
[1:05:12] but there are certain things that it
[1:05:13] will come out that just stands right out
[1:05:15] to you right at the moment
[1:05:17] and uh oh so
[1:05:20] in Esther chapter two we'll start with
[1:05:21] verse 8.
[1:05:25] it says so it came to pass when the
[1:05:28] king's commandment and his decree Was
[1:05:30] Heard
[1:05:31] um hey guy
[1:05:33] the Esther was brought also into the
[1:05:36] King's house into the custody of his guy
[1:05:38] Keeper of the women now remember
[1:05:41] with us when we first come to Christ
[1:05:43] there is a justification sanctification
[1:05:45] and then filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:48] so right here they were all brought into
[1:05:50] the palace I'm going to say as a type
[1:05:51] this is when she was justified
[1:05:54] verse 9. in the maiden pleased him and
[1:05:58] she obtained kindness of him and he
[1:06:00] speedily gave her to things for
[1:06:01] purification and such things that
[1:06:04] belonged to her in this and seven
[1:06:06] maidens you know what
[1:06:08] with us
[1:06:09] you know we're kind of like the type of
[1:06:11] the Esther here and we were given seven
[1:06:14] Messengers
[1:06:16] to bring us to Christ seven Church ages
[1:06:18] seven Messengers
[1:06:20] amen it's a beautiful how it types
[1:06:24] and seven maidens which were meat to
[1:06:27] give to her out of the King's house now
[1:06:29] each one of those Messengers had a
[1:06:30] message from the King's house amen and
[1:06:33] he preferred her and her Maids into the
[1:06:35] best place of the house and other women
[1:06:37] let's drop down to verse 12.
[1:06:39] and when the every maid's turn was come
[1:06:42] to go into the king uh hazarus after she
[1:06:46] had been 12 months according to the
[1:06:48] manner of women and so were the days of
[1:06:51] their purification
[1:06:53] accomplished to wit six months with oil
[1:06:55] uh myrrh six months with sweet oils
[1:06:58] odors and with other things for the
[1:07:01] purification purifying of women okay so
[1:07:03] she was sanctified
[1:07:04] now she now she was justified now she's
[1:07:07] Sanctified but think about them
[1:07:09] this
[1:07:10] 12 months that's a preparation she was
[1:07:16] now something else that was 12 months if
[1:07:20] there was if she
[1:07:22] had
[1:07:23] ever seen any other man and she was
[1:07:25] impregnated nine months they would have
[1:07:27] seen that nine months
[1:07:29] six months of oils can you imagine how
[1:07:33] soft her skin was
[1:07:36] how actually clean she was and just
[1:07:39] think that's what the Christ does for us
[1:07:41] washing by the water the word he
[1:07:45] sanctifies us and he does it with oils
[1:07:48] and love and all everything he does it
[1:07:52] to the best it's not something that's
[1:07:54] just halfway this is the best in the
[1:07:57] land Christ's word himself amen amen
[1:08:01] so I can't imagine how soft her skin was
[1:08:04] all the calluses were probably gone
[1:08:08] I mean all the things that had made to
[1:08:10] have a rough life I mean it had to be
[1:08:12] just gone away and the things of the
[1:08:14] world for us should be gone away I mean
[1:08:17] we should forget about those calluses
[1:08:19] and those scars that we have and
[1:08:21] everything and just point to Christ amen
[1:08:25] you know that myrrh today
[1:08:28] is actually found in a lot of skin
[1:08:31] creams today
[1:08:32] to moisten your skin and to help your
[1:08:34] skin there's a there's a lot of
[1:08:36] medicinal things for myrrh it's it's a
[1:08:38] beautiful thing okay so Esther let's
[1:08:40] drill down 13.
[1:08:42] then now this is afterwards then thus
[1:08:44] came every Maiden into the king
[1:08:46] whatsoever she desired was given her to
[1:08:49] go out with her of the House of the
[1:08:51] women unto the King's house
[1:08:52] but when it was the turn of Esther now
[1:08:55] same same with us
[1:08:57] we're on free moral agency
[1:08:59] you can dress wherever you want to dress
[1:09:03] you can put on whatever you want to put
[1:09:05] on when you leave here and you're at
[1:09:07] your house
[1:09:08] on Tuesday we have no idea
[1:09:11] Christ knows
[1:09:13] but you are a Freemore agency you can do
[1:09:16] what you he doesn't Force us shows
[1:09:18] what's really aside when you're by
[1:09:19] yourself what you watch what you listen
[1:09:23] to show us what character amen
[1:09:26] more
[1:09:27] help us okay so this is Esther mm-hmm
[1:09:33] and uh verse 15 and now
[1:09:36] when it
[1:09:37] turn of Esther
[1:09:40] of uh Abbey Hill the uncle of Mordecai
[1:09:44] she required nothing but what hey guy
[1:09:47] the king's Chamberlain The Keeper the
[1:09:49] women appointed
[1:09:51] now this is good because the king's
[1:09:55] Chamberlain knows what the king wants
[1:09:58] now brother Branham is kind of like a
[1:10:01] type of the Chamberlain his head you
[1:10:03] know he took care of the Bride
[1:10:05] he only gave us what the king told him
[1:10:08] to give
[1:10:09] and Esther's like well what should I
[1:10:11] wear well the king likes this this is
[1:10:13] what's required you can do what you want
[1:10:16] to
[1:10:17] you can wear whatever you want to but
[1:10:19] this
[1:10:20] but this was required
[1:10:22] now I can imagine some of those women
[1:10:25] I mean they're they're open to the
[1:10:27] king's treasure
[1:10:28] can you imagine all the rings that they
[1:10:31] wore all the earrings and all the chains
[1:10:34] and thinking they were all beautiful and
[1:10:35] it's gaudy and and I and but Esther only
[1:10:40] war that says
[1:10:42] but uh what the women appointed an
[1:10:46] Esther appoint attained favor in the
[1:10:49] sight of all them that looked upon her
[1:10:51] why because she only wore what was
[1:10:55] required verse 17 and the King left
[1:10:58] Esther above all the women
[1:11:01] and she obtained grace and favor in his
[1:11:03] sight more than all the virgins so he
[1:11:07] set the royal
[1:11:08] Crown upon her head now that's the same
[1:11:10] thing you're being filled with the Holy
[1:11:12] Ghost in your position you're
[1:11:15] positionally placed as Queen amen but we
[1:11:19] had to do everything so she was
[1:11:20] justified Sanctified then positionally
[1:11:23] placed oh Lord
[1:11:27] and and made her Queen instead of Vesti
[1:11:31] Verse 18 and then the king made a great
[1:11:33] feast that's kind of like the wedding
[1:11:34] supper unto all his princes and then
[1:11:37] servants even Esther ceased and he made
[1:11:39] a release to the provinces and gave
[1:11:41] gifts according to the state
[1:11:43] of the king and that is what we are
[1:11:45] waiting for right now
[1:11:47] we're waiting for that wedding supper I
[1:11:50] can't imagine what that's going to be
[1:11:51] like I have no idea what that's going to
[1:11:54] be like but you know what I just want to
[1:11:56] be there I don't really care what it's
[1:11:57] like you know because you may like
[1:11:59] mashed potatoes and I like baked
[1:12:01] potatoes you know what I think it's
[1:12:02] going to be the same way and is it even
[1:12:04] going to be food I don't even know you
[1:12:06] know because it's going to be worth
[1:12:07] please
[1:12:09] put on his word here
[1:12:11] I'm assuming it's going to be food but
[1:12:14] you know what it's it's up to the it's
[1:12:16] up to the last last verse let's go to
[1:12:19] Isaiah last uh reading in Isaiah chapter
[1:12:23] 61.
[1:12:26] and let's read verses 10 and 11.
[1:12:33] it says
[1:12:35] I will greatly rejoice
[1:12:38] and the Lord now shouldn't that be
[1:12:40] something that we are doing
[1:12:41] right now
[1:12:43] and it doesn't say I Will Rejoice I will
[1:12:46] greatly Rejoice I love it it's every
[1:12:50] word is there for a reason
[1:12:52] I will greatly
[1:12:54] rejoice in the word my soul shall be Joy
[1:12:58] joyful in my God for he hath clothed me
[1:13:05] covered me with the robe of
[1:13:07] righteousness as a bridegroomed decath
[1:13:10] himself with ornaments and as a bride
[1:13:12] adorns herself with jewels for as the
[1:13:15] Earth bringeth forth her bud and as the
[1:13:17] garden castes the things that are sown
[1:13:20] in to the spring and are sown into it to
[1:13:24] Spring forth so the Lord will cause
[1:13:27] righteousness and praise
[1:13:31] for all the nations to see
[1:13:34] now
[1:13:36] you know there is the the love chapter
[1:13:39] and it's a great chapter
[1:13:42] and some of the things there's
[1:13:44] I just love suffereth long
[1:13:47] now think about that with our
[1:13:49] marriage and ourselves
[1:13:51] but also with us in Christ
[1:13:55] now Christ's love suffereth along to us
[1:13:59] oh my
[1:14:01] our prayer requests answered in a mink
[1:14:04] we get inpatient
[1:14:07] when I love that song that we had sung
[1:14:10] this morning I mean this evening when
[1:14:11] God is four days late he's still on time
[1:14:15] that is it's in his time
[1:14:17] who are we to get impatient love if we
[1:14:20] truly love
[1:14:22] of Christ
[1:14:25] kind
[1:14:26] and we're supposed to be kind one to
[1:14:28] another if you truly love your brother
[1:14:30] and sister
[1:14:31] love is kind
[1:14:33] it says love does not puff up
[1:14:37] love seeketh not her own
[1:14:40] that's one of those things is it's not
[1:14:42] self-centered
[1:14:43] brother sister how can I help
[1:14:45] how can we help each other do you need
[1:14:47] prayer for something you're not just
[1:14:49] saying
[1:14:50] well I need prayer I need prayer do you
[1:14:52] need prayer because
[1:14:54] I mean we all
[1:14:56] pray for one another if we're supposed
[1:14:58] to
[1:14:59] and it helps join us together
[1:15:01] love is not easily provoked
[1:15:05] it says offenses will come
[1:15:08] but I'm telling you God will not cause
[1:15:11] you to be offended only Satan will cause
[1:15:13] you to be offended
[1:15:15] offenses are things that Satan uses to
[1:15:18] drive wedges
[1:15:20] well he really meant this and she really
[1:15:22] meant
[1:15:23] that
[1:15:25] if there was a brother an example that
[1:15:27] we had that they could have been
[1:15:29] offended with brother Branham
[1:15:31] people would even draw him out of his
[1:15:33] circles and he would say well I'm going
[1:15:35] to draw you back in
[1:15:38] and some
[1:15:40] say are you gonna they didn't really
[1:15:42] they didn't really mean that he knew
[1:15:44] that that really wasn't
[1:15:47] you could have a whole sermon on
[1:15:49] offenses
[1:15:50] the Lord help us to cast out that devil
[1:15:52] cast out fences amen not be easily
[1:15:55] provoked
[1:15:57] love think is no evil
[1:16:01] don't think evil of our brother sister
[1:16:04] don't think it because Christ says I
[1:16:07] think is no evil
[1:16:09] and then what is left love
[1:16:12] love conquers all if you truly love
[1:16:18] a brother or a sister
[1:16:21] then no matter what you will
[1:16:24] overcome whatever obstacle is there
[1:16:27] amen Satan you know you can't uh
[1:16:31] you can't stop thoughts from coming
[1:16:33] thoughts will come Satan's good in this
[1:16:35] job don't you think he's not how long
[1:16:37] has he been on a job six thousand years
[1:16:39] he knows you better than you know
[1:16:41] yourself
[1:16:43] because we are man and man for six
[1:16:46] thousand years are still the same
[1:16:48] pre
[1:16:49] acher
[1:16:52] amen so
[1:16:55] what's that saying is you can't stop a
[1:16:58] bird from flying from building a nest
[1:17:00] you can stop that thought from nesting
[1:17:03] and taking root
[1:17:04] and then you just cast it out
[1:17:07] and Lord help us to cast out those
[1:17:09] thoughts
[1:17:13] because
[1:17:14] love anchors all and the bride has made
[1:17:18] herself ready
[1:17:20] oh he's coming so soon
[1:17:23] do you know that song
[1:17:26] I wanna be ready
[1:17:30] I wanna be ready to go and I've heard it
[1:17:35] so who pray
[1:17:38] till you're ready
[1:17:43] I know I'm ready oh it's a great one is
[1:17:48] this all it is
[1:17:50] oh eyes one of those songs you can go
[1:17:53] down the road singing you're not
[1:17:54] thinking about it can do it I know I'm
[1:17:57] ready to go oh Lord but it's only Christ
[1:18:00] that can make us ready to go
[1:18:03] amen and then you've got to know that
[1:18:05] you're ready to go that you've done all
[1:18:07] like it with Esther oh she she just did
[1:18:10] what what was commanded her and the rest
[1:18:12] was up to the king
[1:18:15] and that's exactly what we have to do we
[1:18:17] just do what's commanded of us
[1:18:20] and then the rest instead of Lord would
[1:18:22] you
[1:18:24] have you ever thought about the Lord
[1:18:27] 's prayer
[1:18:30] was written
[1:18:31] the vertebrates are in heaven Hall would
[1:18:34] be thy name he prayed so when we go to
[1:18:37] pray we should
[1:18:39] praise him a little bit
[1:18:40] you know my brother bran talks about
[1:18:42] climbing on our father's lap a little
[1:18:44] bit and you know hugging him and being
[1:18:46] intimate with him Lord I'm just so
[1:18:48] thankful for you you're such a good God
[1:18:49] Lord you've done so much for me
[1:18:52] you kind of rest your head on his chest
[1:18:54] a little bit and then
[1:18:56] what happened is you'll get into the
[1:18:58] spirit of Prayer
[1:18:59] and then you'll be like whoa how much
[1:19:01] time has gone by
[1:19:02] versus you know
[1:19:05] sometimes you're looking and it's hard
[1:19:07] to pray for a minute
[1:19:08] and other times time will just go
[1:19:10] because however our attitude and
[1:19:13] mentality is
[1:19:16] now
[1:19:18] talking about Redeeming the time we need
[1:19:20] to set time aside for our prayer that
[1:19:24] I'd pray all right
[1:19:26] right before I get to the bed
[1:19:29] and a lot of times I would fall asleep
[1:19:32] while I'm praying because it was the
[1:19:33] last thing I did first thing I do when I
[1:19:34] get up last thing I did and I found I
[1:19:36] better because because I have a tendency
[1:19:38] to to fall asleep and that's your flesh
[1:19:41] those are the things we got to overcome
[1:19:43] and and he wants to talk to us so spend
[1:19:49] what it is
[1:19:53] oh
[1:19:54] you know one one uh when my wife was
[1:19:58] making all these
[1:19:59] preparations
[1:20:02] I wasn't big on what color flowers had
[1:20:05] to be but she would ask hey it's right
[1:20:07] here she'd she'd asked Lord that's not
[1:20:08] pleasing you that you can see it let me
[1:20:11] know about it because you know what
[1:20:13] knowing about it is 80 of the battle
[1:20:16] then the 20 is praying and ask the Lord
[1:20:18] to take half of it but if you don't know
[1:20:20] about it how are you ever going to pray
[1:20:23] for it and it's amazing how a spirit can
[1:20:26] get on a brother and sister and we'll
[1:20:28] see it before they do a long time
[1:20:31] and it's not our business to go hey you
[1:20:33] got this Spirit on you
[1:20:35] it's more like pray for them
[1:20:38] pray for them keep praying for them and
[1:20:41] by and by the Lord will reveal it to
[1:20:43] them
[1:20:43] and Bam there it goes because there's
[1:20:45] always something in your life you know
[1:20:48] where it talks about don't cast the
[1:20:50] splinter out of your brother's eye when
[1:20:52] you you got yourself a beam a log in
[1:20:54] your own eye well you're you're doing
[1:20:57] this so I always
[1:20:59] when I say something of somebody
[1:21:01] I always think okay there's something on
[1:21:03] Me Lord
[1:21:04] I gotta where am I getting lacking
[1:21:07] that's why no matter how old you get
[1:21:08] you're still going to get worked on
[1:21:09] there's things in our lives that we
[1:21:11] still got to get worked on so we are
[1:21:13] still going to make ourselves ready
[1:21:14] until the day comes
[1:21:16] and Lord help us to do that let's all
[1:21:18] stand
[1:21:19] oh I want to be ready when he comes I
[1:21:22] want to be set in that room spotless
[1:21:24] White
[1:21:28] just be pleasing only have on what he
[1:21:30] requires that's what I want let's bow

[1:21:39] word today Lord Jesus and Lord thank you
[1:21:42] for letting us spend time with you

[1:21:46] that we will be ready Lord when your day
[1:21:48] comes Lord that we won't be that uh you
[1:21:51] know there's ten virgins Lord
[1:21:53] five of them had oil they were ready
[1:21:57] but the other five they were foolish and
[1:22:00] they weren't ready they didn't have that
[1:22:01] oil
[1:22:03] Lord we don't want to be the five
[1:22:05] foolish

[1:22:10] you'll shine a spotlight on it Lord let
[1:22:12] us see it Lord we want to see you
