[1:54] he rejoice
[2:04] i hope you've all had a good weekend god
[2:06] has blessed you all
[2:08] and
[2:11] i thought i'd put it in here
[2:17] maybe i didn't put it in there this
[2:18] morning
[2:20] yeah i got it right here i was sitting
[2:22] in my office this morning and
[2:25] me 25 years 20 years
[2:27] but i was just
[2:29] um you know this is
[2:32] basically the sunday of the year when we
[2:34] come back again it'll be the first of
[2:36] january and we'll be going into 2022.
[2:42] all our whole expectations for this year
[2:44] will be over some
[2:45] just last night and i was reading
[2:47] something read
[2:49] i'll be all over the plate again like i
[2:51] say
[2:52] but uh i'm gonna go and start it about
[2:54] the um
[2:56] we all know in the third
[2:58] chapter
[2:59] after a second timothy we know
[3:04] first eight verses maybe the first
[3:07] nine
[3:08] verses
[3:13] but
[3:14] uh all started about
[3:17] the ninth verse says but they shall
[3:19] proceed no
[3:21] further for their father shall
[3:24] be manifested unto all men
[3:28] as there also was
[3:32] but
[3:34] paul goes three these this uh
[3:38] afterwards was
[3:39] the off call hundreds of people
[3:41] off to rome as you know i am an irishman
[3:44] my people before me were all castle i
[3:48] wanted the word you know being raised
[3:50] that that's the kind of thing
[3:54] in catechism is that above all and
[3:57] that's not the truth there the word has
[3:59] inspired all of it but the church is
[4:01] over
[4:02] the world that's wrong the protestants
[4:04] say this is inspired
[4:08] as much as i believe in it to be
[4:10] inspired see that a lot
[4:12] i especially bring them
[4:14] you try to bring them a little higher
[4:16] and
[4:17] then they see the world i might not be
[4:19] able to make
[4:20] but my faith may be too weak
[4:23] to me
[4:24] it was in the beginning the word is or
[4:27] now is there one i'll just finish with
[4:30] that quote but
[4:31] the thing that's going to make you
[4:33] successful in the coming year
[4:36] uh
[4:39] i i don't
[4:41] have any revelation
[4:44] the scripture will think in the game
[4:45] better if you hope
[4:47] it's going to get better then
[4:49] that's
[4:52] but uh god's place in church this year
[4:54] i'd be honest with you as we listen
[4:56] without hope
[5:02] hey man you're loving with all your
[5:03] heart this morning mark this morning
[5:05] let's stand
[5:07] [Music]
[5:18] [Music]
[5:23] i'm so glad you came to say
[5:27] that
[5:30] [Music]
[5:32] from the earth
[5:35] [Music]
[5:38] he told me he wasn't going to
[5:40] be here today they were glad they was
[5:43] able to make it but i mean it's just
[5:44] good to see one this song come on my
[5:46] heart foreign
[5:54] [Music]
[6:03] ah
[6:19] [Music]
[6:27] hey
[6:43] oh
[6:45] [Music]
[6:53] [Music]
[6:56] in jesus
[7:02] you're glad he was 10 morning i mean
[7:04] brother daniel and
[7:07] carson brother brian you couldn't pick
[7:09] up the off
[7:10] brother josh and sister he were flying
[7:13] come home
[7:14] yesterday or tomorrow and also uh for
[7:17] the mexican distribution the girls would
[7:19] be his wife
[7:20] they had a little girl i believe she's
[7:22] born wednesday thursday and
[7:24] she didn't runs red river
[7:27] and we just want to remember them in
[7:29] prayer this morning
[7:34] [Music]
[7:43] you see
[7:48] [Music]
[7:58] foreign
[8:07] [Music]
[8:18] [Music]
[8:24] can be seated again notice when they
[8:27] load the star which they saw in the east
[8:29] went before the sudden they saw the sour
[8:32] a young child was and when they saw this
[8:35] are they rejoiced with exceeding great
[8:37] joy and when they were commented into
[8:40] the house they saw the young child with
[8:42] mary his mother and
[8:44] at christ at jesus and that as being a
[8:47] king
[8:48] right
[8:49] because truth is how many believes he's
[8:51] the king
[8:53] even up above him when they crucified he
[8:55] said they put up there that said the
[8:57] king of the jews
[9:00] the kingdoms of the world and the
[9:01] kingdom of god the kingdom of satan and
[9:03] so forth only right way
[9:07] to
[9:08] do something
[9:10] is having a king
[9:14] because he said democracies is
[9:17] sales and no anchor
[9:19] boy
[9:23] god it's not
[9:24] that way with god he's the one
[9:27] the atmosphere of every home is
[9:30] dominated by the time i believe i
[9:33] and over in
[9:35] i'm going to go ahead and turn to this
[9:37] just so you'll know it's the truth but
[9:39] in revelations 1
[9:43] and
[9:44] verse
[9:46] 3
[9:48] from jesus christ who is the
[9:50] yes and the first begotten from the dead
[9:54] and
[9:56] only it's waiting for loneliness to
[9:57] second chapter i believe second sentence
[9:59] about only he who now led god is just
[10:03] back because he really paid for it
[10:06] amen
[10:08] and the devil has no more right on you
[10:12] folks think about it he can't do
[10:14] anything you outside of
[10:16] permission boy
[10:21] because i'm here to tell you if you're
[10:22] not in the kingdom of god
[10:24] the devil can man he can paint you up
[10:27] put all kinds of nose rings on you and
[10:29] the devil why because
[10:30] you know you're not gods yet
[10:35] that's why you're still out that west
[10:36] why we did everything in the world
[10:39] man
[10:41] aren't you
[10:42] all right let's look at the power of god
[10:44] let's look at the authority where jesus
[10:45] is when he raised in france it talks
[10:48] about that he was given
[10:50] in power
[10:52] i mean he believes he is above every
[10:54] principle he is above every government
[10:57] he is above every power there is out
[10:59] there
[11:02] and dominion
[11:05] that's why he's the king of kings
[11:09] ruler of rulers lord of lords
[11:12] right i believe brother baby says you
[11:15] know the weakest christian if you are in
[11:18] christ
[11:20] every devil every power every dominion
[11:23] is where
[11:25] it's under your feet
[11:31] folks this is almost bigger than we can
[11:33] grasp this morning
[11:36] how many knows death is on this morning
[11:39] all right
[11:42] that which is to come
[11:44] and has put all things under his feet
[11:46] and gave him to be
[11:48] the head
[11:50] over
[11:51] some things
[11:53] say it with me
[11:55] all things to the church
[11:59] which is his body the fullness of him
[12:02] that filleth all in
[12:05] all
[12:08] oh my i was gonna stop but i'm just
[12:09] gonna take my time this morning is that
[12:11] okay
[12:13] notice when he raised when god raised
[12:15] him from the dead when jesus
[12:18] was from the dead he
[12:22] is ended on high and gave gifts to men
[12:26] he went above the star
[12:29] to be the messenger of the age
[12:31] when he was over there and when he was
[12:33] caught up in that visa
[12:35] you know whatever it was that morning up
[12:37] above his bed and he looked back at his
[12:39] past house body said do i have to
[12:41] go back to that
[12:43] and after all of that he's seen the
[12:45] millions of people that he saw that were
[12:47] over there in that dimension he says but
[12:50] i want to see him
[12:53] what did
[12:54] he say you can't see him yet
[12:59] highest dimension that there is
[13:01] nothing yet
[13:03] well has he
[13:04] done even he said what evil has he done
[13:09] and they couldn't answer he says crucify
[13:11] him crucified let's get rid of just
[13:13] crucified i mean those israel killed
[13:15] their king
[13:19] they crucified their king
[13:25] and because of what he they did to
[13:28] jesus a lot of people don't like the
[13:29] jews
[13:32] you know they just don't like them
[13:34] because
[13:35] prejudice because it comes in isn't that
[13:37] right
[13:38] how many knows the day will come after
[13:40] the bride of jesus christ leaves the
[13:42] earth after the rapture takes place
[13:45] there will be two prophets come to
[13:47] israel
[13:48] moses and elijah
[13:50] and they'll shut up the skies and it
[13:52] don't rain
[13:55] can you imagine a world without rain
[13:57] without food
[13:58] they cause all kinds of troubles to do
[14:00] everything they use they can bring free
[14:01] fries they can bring curses however they
[14:04] want to
[14:05] and they will preach the gospel of jesus
[14:08] christ
[14:09] because now most jews when you tell them
[14:11] about christ they just say he was a good
[14:13] man
[14:15] they don't acknowledge him as being the
[14:16] messiah they just can't see it
[14:19] and see him be a messiah but the bible
[14:22] says that one of these eyes their eyes
[14:24] will be opened
[14:26] and with clouds and they will cry like a
[14:30] parent that has lost their only child
[14:34] they will weep they will weep and they
[14:36] will weep
[14:37] they will cry and they will
[14:40] accept the lord
[14:42] and what he did and 144 000 people will
[14:46] be saved in this
[14:48] single day
[14:50] isn't that right
[14:51] 144 000 and they'll go weeping because
[14:54] they realize that was their lord that
[14:57] they killed
[15:01] that was their king
[15:07] amen
[15:15] all right let's
[15:17] take a few scriptures now if we can
[15:20] 7
[15:21] 18.
[15:24] now notice
[15:25] after the temptation
[15:28] with the devil on the mountain and all
[15:29] of these and overcoming him and so forth
[15:32] john the baptist now haven't been put
[15:34] into prison and so forth
[15:36] him going into the temple and saying a
[15:38] few things in verse 16 he says he reads
[15:42] where it says the people which sat in
[15:43] darkness saw great light and that to
[15:46] them which sat in the regions of the
[15:47] shadow of death light is sprung up
[15:50] from that time now this is the beginning
[15:53] from that time jesus began to preach
[15:57] and to say
[15:58] repent for the kingdom of heaven
[16:03] is at earth
[16:06] i mean there's a beginning of a kingdom
[16:09] he was going to build a kingdom
[16:12] because if god is going to one day one
[16:14] one day he's going to come and take over
[16:17] all these kingdoms somebody knows that
[16:20] he's going to take over all the kingdoms
[16:22] of the world he's going to clean the
[16:24] earth off and what he's beginning to do
[16:27] is to bring to create subjects
[16:31] for that kingdom
[16:33] because like i said a while ago eda had
[16:35] a mess if he came and tried to rule a
[16:38] bunch of
[16:40] carnal people
[16:42] huh
[16:45] because he tried through moses didn't he
[16:49] look at the mess that he had
[16:51] only two out of two million they keep
[16:53] rebelling they keep going back
[16:58] i'm gonna say something kind of strong
[17:00] and if he was there
[17:03] tell me why
[17:07] because of their nature
[17:13] come on folks
[17:15] if that don't
[17:17] tell you that you gotta
[17:18] be born again to be a christian
[17:22] nothing will
[17:24] it's in your nature to be evil it you
[17:26] can't fight your nature
[17:32] praise lord we can do some pretty good
[17:34] reforming but it really don't change it
[17:38] we need to have a change
[17:40] that's what god that's what he's doing
[17:44] amen
[17:50] praise be to god
[17:58] actually glad it's
[18:01] something different than your my
[18:03] i'm not bringing in you today
[18:06] this is when
[18:07] god brings you into there
[18:10] [Applause]
[18:11] god
[18:13] brings you into a whole new world
[18:16] makes you a different
[18:18] person
[18:19] that's scallywag lying cheap
[18:22] stealing oh that's all by the wayside
[18:24] gotta change all that
[18:27] it's scary
[18:29] god isn't going to make you rule
[18:31] anything
[18:32] if i be of god
[18:35] if i'm according to the word
[18:39] amen
[18:41] see where that'll lead you
[18:45] amen
[18:46] all right
[18:48] so
[18:51] the kingdom of god
[18:53] 4 17 i believe it is and then
[18:56] matthew 11 and
[18:59] 12
[19:01] matthew 11.
[19:07] the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence
[19:12] when we talk about a king we would
[19:13] expect him to rule i mean
[19:16] you know
[19:18] but you know this is this is how jesus
[19:20] explains it
[19:22] when
[19:24] he answered them and said the kingdom of
[19:27] god cometh
[19:29] not
[19:30] with observation
[19:32] huh
[19:33] in other words you don't see it with
[19:35] your eyes
[19:41] neither
[19:43] shall they say lo here or lo there
[19:47] for behold the kingdom of god is
[19:52] amen
[19:57] how many please it's in you
[19:59] that's where the kingdom of god is it's
[20:02] inside of us
[20:05] [Music]
[20:06] aren't you glad that the devil doesn't
[20:08] rule anymore aren't you glad the holy
[20:11] ghost rules on that heart now
[20:14] he's king
[20:16] oh my
[20:17] i'm not sure what that woman's name is
[20:19] but i love that song she sings you
[20:23] are my king
[20:25] you
[20:27] are my i can't sing like a woman i
[20:28] better go for a man
[20:30] you
[20:31] are my king
[20:33] amen aren't you glad he's your king
[20:35] i thought it's a beautiful song
[20:38] hallelujah
[20:39] it don't come with observation but it's
[20:41] within you that's where the kingdom of
[20:43] god is
[20:44] another place it says she eat first
[20:48] the kingdom of god and his righteousness
[20:52] because that's what god's got to do he's
[20:54] got to make subjects
[20:57] fit to rule
[21:00] he's got to get us ready for that
[21:02] kingdom
[21:05] before we see the natural kingdom we got
[21:07] to have the spiritual kingdom taken care
[21:09] of
[21:15] that's right
[21:21] god don't want to rule over a bunch of
[21:24] sinners
[21:25] [Applause]
[21:28] i'll tell you this as a pastor i don't
[21:30] like to pastor a bunch of goats
[21:35] out they were out there shopping
[21:36] somewhere and they seen a woman out
[21:37] there in the middle of the winter
[21:41] with shorts on and the wife says you
[21:43] know that can't be
[21:45] comfortable
[21:47] you know she says why do they do that
[21:49] that's because they're americans
[21:51] right they can do that
[21:54] you can go out there
[21:55] dress any old way
[21:59] how many knows
[22:01] our
[22:02] rules and our laws and our king is above
[22:06] civil laws
[22:09] why because they let you drink they let
[22:11] you smoke
[22:13] they let you commit adultery they let
[22:15] you divorce
[22:17] without a problem
[22:20] hey you want a divorce you don't have to
[22:21] have an excuse
[22:24] even todd county remember a few years
[22:26] ago it was a dry dry county right
[22:30] you couldn't have you couldn't sell
[22:31] booze
[22:32] praise the lord you couldn't have
[22:34] something but now they can
[22:36] i guess they caved right brother about
[22:37] the caved just like the world's caving
[22:42] all kinds of laws
[22:44] that allow you to do stuff
[22:47] that we can't do you can't do
[22:50] because our king says no
[22:54] our king says no
[22:56] and do you realize this morning it's the
[22:58] devil's objective
[23:00] if
[23:04] it's his object
[23:06] if for you to just do what he
[23:09] wants you to do instead of god
[23:13] because that makes him your king
[23:21] because the devil is a king
[23:24] huh he
[23:26] he has a kingdom
[23:30] there's only two kingdoms
[23:32] [Music]
[23:34] but better than says they got the rights
[23:36] they don't have the copyright on the
[23:37] cross
[23:38] that's because they make people if you
[23:40] didn't bow down to that cross huh
[23:43] they would kill you
[23:45] all they wanted you to do is to bow down
[23:47] to what they believe what they said and
[23:50] we had 68 million
[23:52] christians that would not adhere would
[23:55] not bow to a lesser
[23:57] power than god
[24:06] huh that's why you'll see a persecution
[24:08] come upon christianity even more and
[24:10] more
[24:11] to try to close places like this down
[24:14] they'll try to make you
[24:16] think the way they think
[24:18] if they
[24:20] how many knows
[24:23] this bloke thing i'll tell you what a
[24:25] bunch of devils woke up
[24:29] this woke thing is of the devil
[24:34] that's right that's confusion you're
[24:37] going to be uncomfortable if you're
[24:38] homosexual around here
[24:41] because i'll tell you right now your
[24:43] mind has been seared
[24:46] your mind so twisted and god's visit
[24:50] even the bible says you know that

[24:52] reprobate american that's what you ended
[24:54] up here they drink beer like it's going
[24:56] out of style
[24:58] and they asked about why aren't you
[24:59] drinking with us
[25:01] i guess he didn't preach on drinking
[25:03] that night
[25:08] he says well he didn't know what to say
[25:10] he was trying to be nice and he says you
[25:11] know well i'm an azeroth i'm not
[25:13] supposed to drink smoke or do any of
[25:15] those things oh okay
[25:16] drink their beer some more
[25:18] didn't realize maybe they need to be a
[25:20] nazarite
[25:23] and what was it in finland or
[25:25] italy one of those places and said they
[25:27] don't serve you water do serve you wine
[25:30] just drink it like it's common
[25:33] huh
[25:35] you go to is it france i guess it is one
[25:37] of those he says you know and
[25:39] and you know they have these women
[25:40] that'll wash you know baby everything
[25:42] else and the brothers were going in
[25:43] there to watch places
[25:45] scrub women he says brother you won't
[25:47] find me up in there
[25:52] right he said they have a spirit
[25:55] every kingdom has a spirit and when a

[31:38] and at the end of the days
[31:41] nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar lifted up
[31:43] my eyes upon to heaven and my
[31:45] understanding returned
[31:48] and i blessed the most high
[31:50] wow he changed his part
[31:52] it changed his tune a little bit didn't
[31:53] he
[31:55] by the might of my power and for the
[31:58] honor of my majesty is what he said
[32:00] before
[32:01] now i blessed the most high and praised
[32:04] and honored him that liveth forever and
[32:07] ever
[32:08] whose dominion is an everlasting
[32:11] dominion
[32:13] how many i believe over hebrews it says
[32:15] you know that we receive a kingdom that
[32:18] cannot be shaken
[32:20] it cannot be removed how many beliefs
[32:22] when you're born again you enter into a
[32:25] kingdom that shall never end
[32:28] never end
[32:30] not an ending kingdom
[32:33] all right and his kingdom is from
[32:35] generation to generation
[32:38] and all the inhabitants of the earth are
[32:41] reputed as nothing
[32:44] and he doeth according to his will
[32:47] in the army of heaven
[32:50] and among
[32:51] the inhabitants of the earth
[32:54] and none can stay
[32:57] his
[32:59] hand
[33:03] how may believes when somebody messes
[33:05] with you
[33:06] relax
[33:10] pray for him
[33:13] ask the lord forgive them
[33:17] take it easy on them
[33:19] why because they're dealing with god
[33:22] not you
[33:25] none can stay his hand or say unto him
[33:28] what doest thou
[33:30] and at the same time my reason returned
[33:32] unto me and for the glory of my kingdom
[33:34] and my honor and my brightness returned
[33:36] unto me and my counselors and my lord
[33:39] sought unto me and i was established in
[33:41] my kingdom
[33:42] an excellent majesty was added unto me
[33:45] now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol
[33:49] and honor
[33:51] the king of heaven
[33:53] amen
[33:54] isn't that awesome
[33:56] all whose works are truth and his ways
[33:59] are judgment
[34:01] and those that walk in pride he is able
[34:05] to abase
[34:09] amen
[34:11] in closing this morning
[34:26] remember
[34:29] how that
[34:35] he had a vision
[34:37] of the statue of the man and one of the
[34:39] last
[34:41] things that he saw
[34:43] was
[34:46] the brass toes and so forth the iron and
[34:50] the feet and so forth that was the last
[34:51] part
[34:53] of that man
[34:54] i'd like to go through that sometimes
[34:55] perhaps up here
[34:57] that was the last kingdom he talked
[34:59] about all the kingdoms the greeks the
[35:01] grecians romans
[35:03] you know that would come after
[35:04] nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar's kingdom
[35:06] was greater than all the romans and all
[35:08] those others but the last kingdom had to
[35:10] do with uh iron and clay and the feet
[35:12] not mixing with each other and you know
[35:14] just don't mix with each other
[35:17] and brother bam says you know there was
[35:18] a meeting i guess in the u.n somewhere
[35:19] when kushchev and eisenhower got
[35:22] together and kush jeff grabbed the shoe
[35:23] up on the table and slapped it on the
[35:25] table because he didn't get everybody's
[35:26] attention all right and brother bam says
[35:29] that represented the east and the west
[35:31] the two legs and so forth the iron and
[35:34] the clay iron means uh
[35:36] eisenhower and kushchev means clay
[35:40] he says we're right in that time period
[35:41] and then the bible says that after that
[35:44] and that during that time period there
[35:46] was a stone that was shown out of the
[35:48] mountains right stone that was hewn out
[35:51] of the mountains had come and he crushed
[35:53] all the kingdoms
[35:55] right
[35:56] somebody knows that's where the age that
[35:58] we're living in
[36:01] amen the age that we're living in is in
[36:02] the time when he's going to come and
[36:04] consume and crush all of these kingdoms
[36:09] and establish what
[36:11] his own kingdom
[36:13] listen
[36:14] we know that right now he who letteth
[36:17] will let until
[36:18] he chooses to come
[36:20] and according to
[36:22] [Applause]
[36:23] ephesians 1 he says until he comes to
[36:26] purchase
[36:28] to redeem his purchased possession
[36:32] in other words if he bought you
[36:34] if he paid for you one of these days
[36:36] he's going to come and redeem that
[36:40] and then
[36:41] he's going to
[36:42] crush all the world
[36:45] and when the seventh angel this is in
[36:46] revelation 11 and 15 he says when the
[36:49] seventh angel sounded there were voices
[36:52] in heaven
[36:53] saying the kingdoms of this world are
[36:56] become the kingdoms of our lord and of
[36:59] his christ and he shall reign forever
[37:03] and
[37:04] ever
[37:06] how many i don't know about you but i'm
[37:07] looking forward to him when he is
[37:09] supreme ruler of the natural world
[37:13] right now he's allowing the devil to do
[37:15] what he does to a certain
[37:17] point right
[37:19] but you know as we live and as we find
[37:21] out things like you know
[37:24] uh you know we know people i take uh
[37:26] brother terry and sister vicky and all
[37:28] of our friends our family different ones
[37:30] you know we go and we live and and we're
[37:32] healthy and then all of a sudden
[37:34] something will strike us right
[37:37] life is so uncertain
[37:40] how we can sit here oh i could see there
[37:42] this morning and talk about brother
[37:43] billy and and ivan and we could talk
[37:46] about uh the cult and bishop we could
[37:48] talk about all those people now i may
[37:50] have sometime we may have like a
[37:52] memorial service for people we know
[37:54] bring pictures or whatever i believe we
[37:56] ought to remember don't you
[37:59] but when he reigns
[38:02] nothing will ever come upon you
[38:05] there'll be no sickness there'll be no
[38:08] death there'll be no sadness there'll be
[38:10] no graveyards no funeral can you imagine
[38:13] when
[38:14] he reigns supreme
[38:16] what it's going to be like
[38:19] well right now we can only imagine folks
[38:21] but i'm telling you
[38:23] it's going to be
[38:25] glorious
[38:26] beyond what we can imagine
[38:29] it's not going to stay this way people
[38:31] one of these days he's going to take
[38:33] these kingdoms
[38:35] and make him all
[38:37] his own
[38:39] and it gets guess what the bible says
[38:41] that those who were resurrected and so
[38:43] forth they lived after the
[38:45] you know not after a thousand but years
[38:47] but in the first resurrection he says we
[38:49] live and reign with christ for what for
[38:51] a thousand years just what that reign is
[38:54] i don't know but i know one thing that
[38:56] if jesus would have come and been the
[38:57] king of israel and ruled them like that
[38:59] and tried to set up campus and all those
[39:02] others as rulers
[39:04] huh
[39:06] can you imagine the corruption that
[39:07] wouldn't have been never worked first
[39:08] god had to get
[39:10] people ready for that
[39:13] kingdom for that place and that's what
[39:15] god is doing you believe that
[39:18] listen to this
[39:20] but the bible says we have access
[39:23] to our king
[39:24] we can have an interview with him
[39:26] whenever we want to call upon him
[39:30] we have no other intercessor no other
[39:32] mediator between us
[39:34] and our king
[39:36] but the one man
[39:38] christ jesus
[39:40] so we are living in a kingdom
[39:43] and it's called in the chronology of the
[39:45] bible
[39:46] this messianic kingdom
[39:50] how many knows he's the messiah
[39:52] messiah means savior we're living in the
[39:55] savior
[39:56] kingdom of god
[39:58] he's in the saving business
[40:01] he's in the redeeming business
[40:03] and he's here to rule
[40:05] and reign on the throne of our heart
[40:08] how many believes without the token you
[40:10] won't be there what is the token in your
[40:12] life the token is the literal life of
[40:15] jesus christ
[40:17] living
[40:18] in you
[40:20] let's close with that thought in our
[40:22] hearts and our mind in our
[40:24] neighborhood wherever we are
[40:27] remember it's god's life living in you
[40:30] is it
[40:31] really him living
[40:34] is it really every thought are you
[40:35] checking every thought comes into your
[40:37] mind
[40:39] paul said bringing into captivity
[40:41] every thought
[40:43] to the obedience
[40:45] of the word
[40:48] in other words where the
[40:51] rules in every life in his dominion
[40:55] ruling the lives of his people
[40:57] amen
[40:59] and he called out people from every walk
[41:02] of life
[41:04] gathering them together and he calls it
[41:07] his
[41:08] church
[41:11] how many knows that
[41:13] god is doing something in the middle of
[41:15] all this
[41:18] he's doing a work
[41:19] you might what
[41:21] this world is terrible but god's doing
[41:23] something in the middle of it
[41:27] and i pray that every soul here
[41:30] this morning
[41:31] is a part of that work that god is doing
[41:34] a work
[41:35] in your life
[41:42] and teaching you
[41:45] to surrender every portion of your life
[41:47] to him so he can rule
[41:49] and teach you how to rule
[41:52] because listen as i said at the
[41:53] beginning
[41:54] children
[41:55] if a child is disobedient you would
[41:57] never give him your checkbook
[42:00] you never put him over your business if
[42:02] he can't even listen to you
[42:05] right
[42:06] and if we are still carnal and so forth
[42:08] he could never set us up to kings he
[42:10] could never have us reigning with him
[42:13] amen before we were fit to reign we have
[42:15] to have character
[42:17] amen god bless you let's stand
[42:20] amen
[42:23] you love him this morning
[42:33] hold your head up people you're the son
[42:35] of a king
[42:36] how many believes it we're the son of a
[42:38] king
[42:40] just as that slave was
[42:42] living in a world a strange place
[42:45] still a slave to this flesh this flesh
[42:47] is still holding us down so to speak
[42:50] right
[42:51] let's bow our heads
[42:54] how many this morning would look at your
[42:56] heart and say lord jesus
[43:00] i want you to rule in every kingdom of
[43:03] my heart every part of my heart
[43:06] i've got my hand up
[43:08] and it's those parts
[43:10] listen god is focusing on those parts of
[43:14] you
[43:15] that still need to be surrendered
[43:18] because as you surrender those you
[43:20] become more in the image of christ you
[43:22] become more like him
[43:25] he can be your king
[43:28] every area of your life
[43:31] he doesn't want just part he wants every
[43:34] area i like that song says jesus be the
[43:37] kingdom be the lord of all the kingdoms
