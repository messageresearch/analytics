the Lord endureth forever praise ye the Lord you may be seated brother Brian morning brothers and sisters I still I'm not getting over that picture that was up there between me and Janette I was going to say something but I I was just saying it's like having a gorilla next to a I I'll leave that on I'll leave the other part on said if you would I was uh looking on that thing let me take this out this morning if you turn with me one of the scriptures up there this morning was Matthew the sixth chapter if you could go to about the N 18th verse this is totally off what I was point this morning but let me I got these two things I printed out this morning off of that tablet but the one of the messages for today um that happened on February 9th the last one on February 9th was the countdown and I'll get into this chapter but I was thinking of that message to countdown where brother brandham was talking about the natural world how it never stays in one place it keeps it's moving to a destination one day and we all know what that destination is there's come like brother Thomas was talking about on Wednesday we're coming to that point where the whole world is going to be shaking and then the revelation of who Jesus Christ really is is about to happen on the face of the Earth do I know the day or the hour no but you can see the season we're in that season right now this morning and I was thinking about that message how the world progresses in the natural sense you know they went from like brother Bram would talk about from the wheel all the way to the rocket and the world out there is the same way and the church is the same way and I was just thinking how much we actually myself I can only speak for my how we live below our privileges this morning in the word of God and in the presence of Jesus Christ we don't realize how privileged we are this morning to have the Revelation for the hour before us and have the ability for a living God to move through your heart and through your life to bring about changes whether they're physical or spiritual and I was thinking this morning um as we look at the you can look at the current condition of the world and brother brandham said what the way the world is the way the church is so we know that outside of the Living Church there's no hope this morning morning but going to this uh chapter here I was just thinking kind of speaks for the thing I have this one from last Sunday too that I would get I was going to get into but starting about the 18th verse because I'm a firm believer you can never read God's word enough and and I I found out I say this a lot I know I don't mean to but I found out if you if you pray and stay quiet and and when you get to that spot where you're quiet now for some people that's different some people takes hours just to get quiet enough that they can read the word of God and it means or touches your heart it really speaks to you some people can do it in little time at all but starting about the 18th verse it says that thou appear not onto men to fast but unto Father which is in secret love he's talking about when you fast and when you do your arms and it goes back to what David was saying in that psalm whenever you do those things for the Lord Jesus is saying you're not supposed to do it before men but you're supposed to do it in secret and God will reward you openly so when you pray for people and when you fast for people and when you do things you I'm I'm a firm believer not to let the right hand know what the left hand's doing but I'll start at this 18th verse uh I'm in the wrong spot at the and then he goes on to say in the 19th verse lay not up for yourselves treasure upon Earth that's that's where the world's out this morning everyone wants Treasures in the earth and not Treasures in the heart where the morth and rust do corrupt and where the thieves break through and steal so we know in a natural sense you can get all the worth wealth in the world and someone can steal it from you you'll lose it when you die it doesn't mean anything but Jesus speaks here but but lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven with neither moth nor rust do corrupt where thieves do not break in nor steal so you know if you lose your experience or you you lose your Revelation you don't lose it because someone stole it from you you let you let it disappear from yourself and it goes on for there your Treasures is that's where your heart be also and that's what I was thinking about what brother brownon was talking about this morning and what I was listening I can when you when you're alone by yourself I know I say this a lot and I I don't apolog I can't say it enough when you find those thoughts possessing your mind and your spirit that's who you really are so whe if you can't get control of those thoughts or those spirits that try to get a hold of you if you find yourself continually doing the same thing you got to realize if you can realize that's who you really are then you can change and I'll keep reading here for where your treasure is that's where your heart be also the Light of the body is the eye and therefore thine eye be single the whole body should be full of light so if you got light you're going to project light but if thy eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness and if therefore the light is in thee be Darkness How Great is Thy Darkness so that's a pretty simple principle if you've got the Revelation you've got Christ in you the only thing that can come out of you is the light of the Gospel if you're holding on to Darkness and evil things sooner or later that's what you're going to project sooner or later and it goes on to say now no man can serve two and that's the scripture that was up there this morning now no man can serve two masses for he will either hate one or love the other or else he will hold to one and despise the other you cannot serve God and mmon Mammon I meant to say and you know as I get older you know this scripture this is being manest on the whole face of the Earth you can't you can't have both you only can have one and you're going to we all have to choose which what we're going to put more in our lives than the other and I'll just finish with a few of these verses and then I I'll jump into Timothy the second chapter 1 Timothy therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor let your nor for your body but what you shall put on it is not life more than meat and the body more than rment you know doesn't mean you don't go to work the next day and you don't provide for your family but Jesus is giving you a principle here this morning you're not supposed to worry about those things you're supposed to put them in his hand and let him take is that an easy thing to do no that's not an easy thing to do sometimes I lost my place therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor for your body but you shall put what you shall p is not your life more than meat and your body more than rment behold the fowls of the air for they s not neither do they reap nor gather into the barns yet Heavenly Father Feth them and are you not much more better than thee and then I'm not going to continue reading but I was just thinking this morning that as I was looking at that that principle doesn't change if I haven't lost my place here second Timothy the uh 2 chapter but I was reading this this is another one from last week and uh brother brandham was talking in this message let me just read these scriptures here this morning in the second chapter of uh Second Timothy and Paul says here thou thou therefore my son being strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and all things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same I commit to thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also and I was thinking about this third scripture right here that's where we're at in our today and he goes on to say that thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man worth entangle himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier so basically Paul's saying here once God has chosen you to do something you can't worry about the circumstances that are around you just commit yourself to the whole purpose that God has for you this morning whatever that purpose be everyone has a purpose that God has given you and I know the pastors and the teachers have come across here telling you that you have to get you have to learn what your purpose what God's goal for you in your life is and once you know and God has witnessed to you that that's your purpose then you have the strength to go out in your life and be successful I'm not worry every day about whether you're where you're supposed to be and he goes on to say here I lost my place and any man also strive for Mastery yet he is not crowned except he strive lawfully basically he's saying you got to play by the rules you can't get ahead without playing by the rules uh that's a simple way of saying it the husband that lath must first be partakers of the fruit and consider what I say and the lord giveth thee understanding in all things and he goes on the remember Jesus Christ the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel and I'll stop there but I was reading this thing from the uh the tablet last week and this is what brother Bram had to say and it really struck my heart about this thought he goes on to say here and this is in the resurrection there's got to be a time where you got to quit babying people and not I I believe in my I can only think about myself there's a time where you got to stop babying yourself and be a strong Christian and walk out in faith you can't sissify them that's what the trouble is today especially out in the churches of the world they're trying to lead them by the hand everywhere like their children instead of just preaching the gospel and let it change their hearts and lives they want to lead them all the way through it and it doesn't work that way and preachers in handling the gospel with e ecclesiastic gloves on and that's what the trouble of it is today and it can be the same in a Methodist Church or in a world church people have to be men and women in Christ you have to be strong in the Lord It's you can't get away it goes on that's what the trouble of it is today what we need today is raw flat gospel to tell you that you're a sinner going to hell and you can forget about that out in the world they don't they don't like telling that simple Brimstone and fire type of pre preaching that they don't like that too much if you haven't got the Holy Ghost you're out of the Kingdom how how often do you hear that out in the world I'll read that again if you haven't got the Holy Ghost you're out of the kingdom of God that's right you can't believe the you can't believe the supernatural because you have never been born again that that experience is together he's saying and you're born again you have to believe the supernatural because you're Supernatural yourself and I just wrote this note to myself sorry about that and I was just thinking this is what and this this thought came out of investments in 1963 January 26 but brother brownon was talking you meet God exactly like you are your death doesn't change who you are and what what I wrote is when you meet God you meet the Lord as yourself but what we forget two things are absent when you go to the other side your body the physical self and the spirit that's on you right now when you take those two away you take your body away and you take your spirit away the only thing left is your soul and brother random taught continually the only thing that will abide in that soul is the unad alterated word of God that seed and all those virtues that you add upon it and I I think sometimes to myself if you take the spirit that that's in me you take that away and you take your body away what's left who are you really or who am I and sometimes I don't get worded but it's an awesome thought to think that one day we're all going to face God one day and The Superficial Spirit we have on us that hoty Spirit it won't be there that day whatever that Spirit we all have different Spirits brother vam taught that that won't be there on that and you won't have that physical body so when you get on the other side who are you going to be really who who's the real I can only speak for myself who's the real Brian Baldwin on that day and the only real Brian Baldwin can be the one that's been born through the word of God and those virtues that are in the scriptures laying me and I was just thinking the whole that's really an awesome thought when you think about it who you really are in life who you who are you or who am I I should be saying not you but who am I in the end who am I going to be on that day and I want to be that perfect Christian that the Bible talks about I want to lead my life in a way that I have those attributes I have the the things that I need to have on that day that's what I desire to have me on that day Brother David love the Lord this morning amen let's stand this morning if we could it's just good to be in the house for the Lord this morning and man how he's looking forward to awesome time in the Lord this morning amen and let's sing that little course if we could this morning so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad

some better and it's just kind of popped up out of the blue and so amen it'll just I hope that it'll just vanish Into the Blue amen so praise the Lord God bless you good to see you is it gersam amen all right God bless you this morning so good to have you on the front row amen praise the Lord amen all right well y'all ready to get started amen well let's go then amen open your bibles if you will and we'll go to the book of Hebrews Hebrews 13 Hebrews 13 amen amen we won't say like smoky in the Bandit we got a long way to go in a short time to get there right all right that's just to loosen you up a little this morning right all right got everybody loosening up oh yeah praise the Lord God is good isn't he amen amen so just trying to follow the leading of the spirit this morning amen uh yesterday just praying Lord what you have and amen and uh couple of times praying there on my desk and just bowing my head say Lord I don't know which which which way you want me to go but just lead me and guide me amen and so about the second time I prayed like that he just kind of give me this amen and I just like brother brandham said God will give you something and then you'll just kind of keep on that thought and then if God multiplies that and just you know then go that direction and so that's how we feel to go this morning Hebrews 13 and verse 8 very familiar scripture to us isn't that right amen praise the Lord Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen amen we want to dwell for a little bit with the help of the Lord and we want to try to uh just try to try to ask the Holy Spirit just to take some of these thoughts and things that I've got wrote down here and try to put it together the way that he wants to put together amen so we will see this and this of course we know this was the SE theme of the prophet of God and his generation wasn't it amen and I love the message where brother Bram talked about how that and he he he he he preaches a message called lifting him up out of History ain't that right lifting him up out of History amen and making him the same yesterday today and forever now anytime that I begin to think about God when I begin to think about how great God is and well when you just think about God you're thinking about the right thing ain't that right and so I begin to think of how perfect that God is that he's the same he don't never have to change God never changes now he changes his uh uh dwelling place isn't that right he changes his mask yeah he changes his mask he changes Amen in in whom he dwells and just in the last few weeks you know I I I've been thinking about one thing that the Lord's kind of quickened to me is how that how that we're such a blessed people to think that we are still how many knows that we are still fallible people we're still failures we still have faults we have failures and you would think God wouldn't use somebody like that but yet he does Amen in all of our failures God still uses us and I don't think that God would keep using us if we make those failures amen and we fell short amen and then we didn't repent of that or as God to forgive us how many times you'll see brother benam talking or you hear him talking about God talking and saying God forgive us of our shortcomings our failures forgive you forgive your unworthy servant and so forth amen but this awesome God that he would actually use you use you dwell in you and dwell in me amen and actually use our vessels use our lips use our heart use our mind to manifest the light to the world Amen it blows my mind how that God can never think a wrong thought how many knows all of his thoughts are perfect the first time and it fascinates me because I know that I sure don't how many knows when you're on a project or you're fixing to do something you probably try to think of it in every manner or way that you can possibly think of it especially if you're in construction or what what you're doing is what's the best way to do this amen a lot of time me and my boys get in an argument because no we want to do it this way this is how no this is how you do it this is a better way Dad and I'm the oldfashioned way hey you know it's been my way is to best but I come to find out and he says okay let's go ahead and do that and then I realize hey you know that really was better I'll tell you what I think we're in trouble when we think that we are always right amen and the other person's always wrong and we're prone we're programmed that way and if you can't give in you're not going to be a person that's easy to get along with if you don't give a little ain't that right if you don't think so get married and find out that's right get married you'll find out there's got to be a little give and take here folks a little bit of understanding but anyway that's a downal rabbit Trail praise the Lord but I like this because God he can't never when he thinks something gets a perfect thought how we can how we can rejoice in that knowing that he thought of you didn't the prophet say he thought of you sitting there this morning morning he thought of you and he knew the clothes that you would be wearing this morning he knew that you would come here this morning he knew what I would preach this morning before the first Stardust was ever made that's how perfect God is this Maring story is about how changing we are how a changing world that we live in ain't that right when you think about even our democracy and our forefathers D wrote up the Constitution and boy they had it down and oh boy we're going to have we had a great nation out of it but we've seen that all fall apart ain't that right that's right even that changes Nations change people change times change amen but God don't change amen his word he don't know never have to take his word back to his unfailing words of Promise amen perfect thoughts amen never has to change his mind only changes his form and how many knows that God lives in Simplicity brother Braham said God will never be in big things and Glamour and all of that God dwells in humility how many believes if you're a Christian this morning then you need to live a simple humble Christian Life That's where God is I'm not don't know about you but I want to know where God dwells so that I can find that place amen because so many people miss this unchanging God they miss him amen and how do they miss him by serving a historical God a his a god of History a god of the past and not a god of the present how many glad this morning that he is the same this very second as he was before he hung the first star he hasn't changed one bit he's alive and well amen oh my when I begin to think about this let me just let me lay a little foundation with the help of the Lord just start here I didn't I didn't want to well we're just going to follow the leading of the spirit they ain't worried about the clock back there or anything is that all right butam says so I feel so bad today when people try to make God something in a history he said what he says I want to ask you something what good is a god of History if he isn't the same today one place want to try to pull it up but I remember he says man if it's if he's just a god of a day gone by you better you might as well study agriculture science or or something like that you'd be better off in some other program than just a God that's not even alive anymore he's just a historical God don't mean anything think about it that's right notice listen he's not is the god of History altogether he's the same today how can people claim him to be something that was and isn't now how many knows that during brother bram's time a mean there was so much going forth and so much Bible schools teaching them that Mark 16 from a certain verse on wasn't even inspired the Holy Ghost was just for the apostles the apostolic days are gone wow what a teaching how many knows it's important what you're taught amen it's very important about what you're taught amen another place says it this way I don't mean to hurt too bad but I want to settle this down to a place where you will get to thinking what good is a god of Moses if he isn't the same God today what good is a historical God amen if he isn't the same in power today amen then he says what good would it do to show if you uh take a freezing man that was freezing to death and you met him in the street and he was freezing and you took him a big picture of a fire so I just at the end there I talk told Siri pull me up a picture of a fire serving a historic God God that is the same today anymore hello a god of the past he said it's like meeting a freezing man out in subzero weather and going up to him and saying hey guess what I got something for you I got something yesterday man we had the biggest bonfire you ever saw look at that huh see put your put your hand up there get it close warm warm your hand he tell you idiot get away from me right why it doesn't do any good it's like a paint of fire showing a freezing man a paint of fire if we're just talking about a god of yesterday amen how many's glad to serve the Living God I'm going to tell you something [Applause] there are way too many so-called Christians that just serve a historical God their eyes are in the rear view mirror of what Luther did what Wesley did what Pentecost did hello or even what God did through the prophet amen that was mighty but that God has to come and inhabit this place you've got to have that same fire in your heart that they had or it don't do you any good amen a lot of times all we had Services weeks ago people used to shout people used to worship God what does that good to you this morning no good when you come into those double does what you come to do I don't know what you came to do but I came to praise the Lord amen I came to praise the Lord to give him honor and glory and worship your worship last week don't work this week your praise last week don't work this week i' oh when's the last time God did something for you I want to tell tell you testimony amen 5050 years ago God did something for me you poor decrepit person you mean it's been 40 years since you had a real experience with God we should have an experience with God every day like brother Brian says in the clo closet a little secret place a little place where you get still and you have some fellowship with almighty God you come out of there different person amen how many believes it's like going into the garden alone while the D is still on the Roses amen he walks with me he talks with me and he tells me I am his own amen he refreshes me like brother Tommy and God help and bring that anointing down anoint everybody like pouring amen the anointing oil over a person I better not dump that he going to pour out that's right but pour it out how many knows that's what we need this morning amen is to lift our hands up and say God come on down come on in here here come and anoint me come anoint the speaker and then let it flow to the first row then let it flow to the second row the third fourth fth let God come down and anoint us today not yesterday today right now God is the god of right now he said I am the I am he's the god of the I am even when Moses went down to pharaoh who shall I say sent me tell them that the I am sent you what a different looking name that sounds weird don't it I am tell them I am God wants you to know that God is the I am not just the I was or will be he's a very present help in time of trouble amen praise the Lord thank you Jesus might look nice M sign like might sound nice but it won't do any good it won't warm you amen go get you some sticks get you a match and light up a little fire ain't that right that's the same way with this cold world that we're living in people that just serve churches that just serve Luther Wesley or some day going by amen they're never going to give anybody any help they're not going to bring warmth to it amen final quote on this thought amen listen if he isn't alive tonight and with us as he has promised amen how many knows that Jesus left one time it is expedient that I go away but if I go away I will will come again how many believes that he did come again and I want you to know something he has never left that's right God has never left and he won't leave he won't leave until it's all done cuz he promised lo I Am With You Always how many's glad that you're not alone you're not by yourself we're not [Applause] alone what is it we're anchored to something in a world that's changing age changes us young and youth is a lie health and strength is a lie why because you get old you get feeble amen as you get older amen you got to have blood pressure this and blood pressure that and oh man everything about us amen begins to amen what you might call crash our computer begins to crash things go wrong I remember when I was 20 years old still out in the world and a guy came up to me and said you know all of that greasy chicken and all that other stuff that you're eating you ought to eat that and I said oh really cuz I love that chicken with the skin on and all that I love that he says oh never mind you're just 20 years old you ain't got nothing to worry about never mind why cuz he was old he had to watch what he eat but when you're strong you can get away with a lot of that ain't that right but when you get old you got to watch your your diet has to change everything about it sometimes you got to take this pill that pill amen that changes but aren't you glad that you got a hold of something that don't change that he's there with you you're not by yourself you're with the one that is that was with Adam and Eve I mean as when we look at that sun it comes up and it goes back down comes up and goes back down and has been ever since the time of Eve times have changed amen but the god that made it has never changed amen praise be to God that's right he says listen if he isn't Alive Tonight with us like he promised lo I Am With You Always even to the consumation even to the consumation or to the end of the world how many knows that's where you and I are we're right at the end of the world Amen aren't you glad he's still here folks wouldn't you be sitting in your chair driving down the road or whatever you're doing we would be of all men most miserable if you didn't have that Holy Spirit in your heart if you didn't have God there to talk to to fellowship with how many di to have God to be able to fellowship with to talk to and no matter what comes your way woo he is there to help you amen now notice that's right I Am With You Always now if that isn't the truth if that's not the truth then there's something wrong we are found false Witnesses not only are we making ourselves miserable under a false pretense but we are deceiving others and we're found deceivers of something that we're talking about which isn't see it's not just a myth or historical what good is a historical God if he isn't the same today what good is the god of Moses that delivered them amen back then if he can't deliver today what a good is the god of Daniel if he isn't alive today what about the three Hebrew children they me deliver from the fiery furnace amen I hope there's a lot of folks in here that can say you know I know that God I know that Holy Spirit I know that Pillar of Fire I'm here to tell you I a witness that I have been in the fiery trials some real fiery trials that I thought would never I'd never get out of of but guess what God delivered me out of those fiery trials how many's glad that God has delivered you out of those fiery trials brother Troy amen all of us the different things that we have gotten out of because we serve a living savior Oh What A Savior Oh What A Savior is mine amen praise be to God Amen you love him this morning amen praise the Lord God is good you know how many beli you got to build your house upon a rock cu the world that we're in is sinking shifting Sans everything is sinking amen people don't have an anchor they're not anchored to anything I'm so glad this morning that when I was 20 years old Amen brother Ur and sister Martha I remember them working for them way back when I was that young age amen and there was an anchor that happened an anchored and anchored I've anchored in Jesus the storms of life I'll breath I've Anchored In Jesus I fear no window wave amen when you get anchored in this rock that is unmovable see Jesus says Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word it'll never pass away how many knows that even the elements shall melt with fervent heat even the sun that's been going out there for 6,000 years one day will be no more is that right in the new Heavens there's no need of the sun because the lamb is the light thereof but even that better said we'll outlive the sun outshine the sun in that eternal life will live longer than what the sun has even it'll pass away the Earth will pass away everything will pass away but my word shall not pass away how many beli that you are part of that word the only way you don't pass away is to uh be a part of that word Peter said in one chapter 1 Peter 1 and 23 that we're born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God Amen oh my I don't know about you but that means a lot to me see if I stayed on the course that I was with being raised I'd have been born well I was born Amish that right and I'd have been born a spiritual Amish man after a while CU at the age of 18 you're required to 18 19 that's been so long I forget exactly what age it is but you have a little age there that they let you go a little while for a while but then you straighten up and you become so so to speak New Creation New Birth you get baptized hello and join the church but you know I'm thankful that I Ain didn't have an Amish birth in that way because I know I I I I go back up and visit my cousin sometimes and then I go back with the Amish school boys that I went to school with I have lots of cousins that are there went over you know and met the little my young we were back young back then right and when I go meet them now they look older than their dad was when I remembered them I don't know I being Amish takes a toll on you I guess but I'm like you look like your dad or you know but you're my first cousin we're all old now and just a sta shamish huh staunch see when you how I me know when you give yourself to that that's what you become whatever church and whatever you believe you adapt and what you accept that's what you become why if you mentioned a God sent a prophet what are you talking about right if you would talk about Holiness or the baptism of the Holy Ghost their main commandment is that they obey the Elders of the church and so forth but it doesn't matter whether it's that you might have an arm birth you might have a menite birth you might have a Beamish birth huh all of these churches they're bringing forth children and like begets light the Bible says but to be a born of the word that's a whole different story how many knows amen we got to be born by what not bromite ISM hello but he pointed us to what he pointed us to the word you've got to have the word birth one of the first things he preaches the Bible says that you have got to be born again not just put your name on a book not just join a church ain't no church this church can't save nobody ain't no church got salvation in it brother B said only salvation in Jesus Christ that's the only place you'll find Salvation not because you belong to this that or the other church he straightened a a uh whether what being a member of the church he straightened that up he says Paul said by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body and members in particular if you want to become a member get the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the only way you'll ever be in the right church and that church is universal amen so God help us changing you talk about changing all right before I go into this let's just talk about how that all of creation all of nature the birds all of the animal kingdom don't they have an instinct given them by God you know the barn swallow I still have trouble with them they like to just build those little mud nests right on the side of my 2x2 underneath the roof huh wouldn't it be weird brother Brad if I told you look I seen one building a nest out there on the on the telephone pole and guess what this crazy little bird he was so smart that he put these little put the mud walls up like and then he took sticks and put it in that mud right quick and then he made a little more mud and then he put leaves all over the top and he had him a little roof and in the back he actually formed a little little window and he's sitting in there all cozy and he's modified he modified he's growing you'd say brother boo now that's a real bird story it ain't a fishy story that's a real birdie story why because they don't all those birds they all do what God gave them the instinct to do what God placed in there they're still as the prophet of God they're still in their place but man how many knows we have to improve we have to grow that's why we can't stay in the same place weak after week month after month year after year decade after decade Millennial after Millennial man has to for progress and how we have progressed but there's a lot of them that just likes to stay in the back now see Ephesians says that and because of our lost State how many know it because of our lost State see god is perfect isin that right he's perfect and you and I thirst for Perfection I long for the DAT I don't have to change see from glory to glory he's changing me changing me changing me his likeness and image to perfect in me the love of God shown to the world for he's changing changing me amen from Earthly things through the Heavenly amen his likeness and image praise the Lord so we change we have to change do you know when I'm going to quit changing brother Glenn that's a good answer there brother Glenn I like the second one when you get that new body that's a perfect body isn't it brother Bram says he says the reason that you long for Perfection is because there's a perfect body waiting for you we hate our faults we hate our mistakes I'll be glad when we're not human anymore why because this Humanity has and I thank God for having graced Mercy on us in our mistakes and our failures to still be Grace have Grace upon us but one of these days we won't need Grace why we need Grace because of our failures but there you'll have a body like his own Glory it'll be perfect amen aren't you longing for that say thank you Lord Jesus I'm longing for that Perfection so when you talk about change and when you talk about how God don't change man does change Church has change amen and we have to change why do you think that God said as many as I love I rebuke and chasen because we're not what we ought to be amen but we're working towards it Lord change me from weak to week take this out take that out fill me with more of your grace and more of your love make me like you want me to be amen that's right all of nature praise Lord I won't go into more humor but you ain't never seen a cow get a big old bugle of some kind and try to go get a little o you know different octaves in it you know they just automatically do all that they don't never have to improve amen amen let me just say uh let me read you something now how many knows that when God lived his life here on Earth he was an example for us he was an example for us and he went up into heaven come back on the day of Pentecost and come into the form of his children come into Peter and Paul and all of them and manifested himself amen and they wrote a book of Acts they wrote a book of Acts and that is what God intended that's the way that God intended for his church to be how many he knows that we call it the Acts of the Apostles The Acts of the Apostles brother brandham corrected it Ain that right why it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles that's right and so that was God and the way that he acted then listen to what brother Braham says when he was given the key he was trying to he was given the key in the church age book of how to how to figure out which messenger was for each age okay now how many knows God had seven stars in his right hand and seven candlesticks and God had given him a key brother B says the key that was given to me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is a most scriptural one in fact it might be called the Keystone of the Bible he said it is the Revelation that God never changes and what he's his ways are as unchangeable as he is remember what he said to Peter he said Peter whatever you lose on Earth I'll lose in heaven whatever you bind on Earth I'll B in heaven and Peter had the keys to the kingdom how many know that's why we go by acts 238 and know that in the name of Jesus baptism was actually the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost and what Peter did there is what the prophet of God pointed us to amen that was what God did amen now notice even in Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I know that whatsoever in Ecclesiastes 3:14-15 I know that whatever God doeth it shall be forever and nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him this just comes to my mind didn't by by I'm said make sure that you say what's on them tapes just stay with the word why because man if we went by the things that we would think and our ideas I'm not here to promote my own ideas or put my own ideas in it and you wouldn't listen if I was say there and a preacher and I have wow boy here I go Pastor message Pastor amen allow to preacher to come in and preach things that was contrary to the message and I lost my confidence completely it was part of the reason I'm here today that was the Turning Point lord said go up to Elon I've been here 30 some OD years hello but because he just not and I went to the pastor look he you know that wasn't right he says well we don't understand it all and all this that or the other yeah but you can't sheep you can't feed your sheep a bunch of questionable stuff and confuse them and knowing that it's a man if you don't have this Revelation you're going to be oh don't you forget about that you get the revelation of almighty God Amen how many's glad that we had thus sayith the Lord the reason I like the quote out of the church H book is because we know that it's exactly according to the word it's according to the Bible and Jesus Christ would come and prove it and vindicate it and anybody a false preacher Jesus Christ isn't going to come and vindicate it hello all right now let's go on that just come to my mind I don't know if anybody needed that but anyway there you have it stay with the word of God Amen because it's how many know it's our anchor praise the Lord all right that's right he says you know nothing can be put to it or taken from it see to change one word of it as Eve did would bring sin and death even as it says in revelation 22 If any man shall add to these things God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this Prophet God shall take away his part out of The Book of Life your life depends on whether you stay with the word or not tell me something where would we be if God wouldn't have sent Malachi 4 we would would be in a confusion we would still be wondering what is right who is Right aren't you glad that the prophet of God didn't belong to the Baptist methodists or Pentecostals or any of them you always stood among them in between all of them and said come back to the word come back to the word they wanted him to do but he wouldn't ain't no way he would do it they even offered him to take him Jet and everything else and take care of all of his expenses if he just let down on the godhead water baptism and serpent seed you talking to the wrong boy right here he says that's right because he's right under God he wasn't going to do it for nothing if he gave back million dooll checks you know said no this isn't for money look at the evangelists and all of those out there today they was given a million dollars boy they sure go for it but it's not for money amen praise the Lord praise the Lord let me continue listen so he says that's right if you add to or take away see if you had anything to it of the words of this prophecy prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life then again he says this way now don't let don't go astray he says when I said that God and his word and ways never change I did not say that the church and its Messengers could not change how many knows it did this is where I want to go with the world and the way that even God's church and God's people changed now I truly believe this I truly believe that brother Braham said that this bride in this hour is elected not to fall come on so I believe that we're not going to fall and we're not going to get called like that like that first church did what did they do amen emphasis lost their first love and by the next one it was smart enough which meant that they were bitter and then the next one even went into death and the whole church went to death spiritual death and God had to bring a Reformation through Luther and Wesley Pentecost had to bring us back to the fullness of the word cuz you couldn't even have the fullness of the birth of Christ you couldn't have the real word birth until the fullness of the word came that's why you would be a menite you'd be an Amish you'd be a Pentecostal you'd be a Baptist a Pentecostal that believed if you speak in tongues you got it that was their birth is that right and when brother bam come along and said you know I've seen the Indians I've seen them do their dances and everything else and and make pens right in the unknown tongue so don't tell me that unknown tongues and all of that is the Holy Ghost the devil can impersonate that Amen brother Bram says you know if love was the evidence of the Holy Ghost the Christian Science would have it on us if gifts were pente C would have it on us amen but I want to ask you what is the condition what is the condition that we're to be in if we expect to be saved in the token brother Braham says I'll tell you what there's only one thing that is accepted just like at the blood that was put on the lindle post is't that right nothing else was accepted if you put the wrong if you put a goat or a and if it wasn't Lamb's blood or some other blood how many knows he wouldn't have said nah I'm just going to wink at their ignorance no that young man or that one lady am me that firstborn of that family would have died amen it had to be the blood and brother bam says even now you say you believe in the blood of Jesus Christ dying for you that's okay that's good but he says it'll take more than that it'll take the life of the blood in you he says don't all of your all of your uh religious demonstrations and all your good deeds and all of those things don't you count on that he says you lay aside everything else until you've got nothing but the literal life of Jesus Christ Living in you how many believe that's the only thing that God is going to take in the Rapture that's God's life living in you amen aren't you glad that we can have that praise the Lord I'm glad that we have it today amen and that we can be amen he says talking about the book of Acts he says they're the standard amen that is the original church and any church that there is will always try to be like them amen how many knows that man you take the life of a pumpkin and it you know uh you know put it pumpkin seed out there it'll bring forth another pumpkin he say you take the hot and tots of Africa amen and where he's preaching over there naked women and and no Tops on and anything else but when they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost they look for some clothes to put on and he said isn't it funny how here in America the Christians they're taking more off and then the Christians over there they're putting it on the same Holy Ghost if you get the same Holy Ghost they got he's still the same yesterday today and forever it'll make us act like they acted it'll make us live like they lived it'll make us love like they loved it'll be the same fire wo don't just tell me about Wesley don't just tell me oh some day going by of services we used to have and preachers that used to be able to preach we can have the same thing today cuz he is the same today yesterday and forever Brother Brad I believe right till the day that we go into Rapture we're going to get hotter and hotter and hotter we're not getting colder we're getting hotter all the time cuz we're going to get so hot that we're going to be changed in the very Adams one of these days that's what I'm looking for a Rapture to get out of this world Trump ain't going to fix very much no he's not it's not going to be the solution I manyan he believes this is the solution right here this is the only solution a surrendered life to the word of God to the reveal word of the hour brother Braham said the Pharisees even the disciples almost missed John the Baptist cuz he the disciples asked him the they they said that the Pharisees are asking isn't John supposed to come first you know isn't uh Eli Elias supposed to come first and Jesus said Elias sure truly shall come first and restore all things but I say unto you he has already come and they have done unto him the things that were listed of them is that right they missed it why because the Pharisees were living in the glare of another age man is always looking back to the god of History the god of yesterday I believe every book I believe every page I believe every message that brother Brandon brought but I'm here to tell you that same healing power that same saving power that same forgiveness power is here today God is here today just like he was back then and when when he isn't there won't be a hope left for the world when that spirit is lifted how many's looking when that he Spirit takes that Spirit out I want to be there with him that's exactly right I want to be there with him when he picks this Holy Spirit takes it out of this world Amen all right I'm going to jump to the last page is that okay hallelujah amen how many believes that we have to be connected to this unmovable Eternal being called God Jesus Christ we're connected to it when you're connected there amen that means you have anchored and you become unmovable unchangeable in your spirit you're never going to you're never going to go back to serving the devil again I don't say you don't have fals and failures but guess what you're now anchored to something that not just you're hanging on no but he's hanging on to you he hideth my soul in where the Cliff of The Rock and covers me there with his hand I've Anchored In Jesus how many Anchored In Jesus in that unmovable Rock Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away David said said he said blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsil of the ungodly nor standeth in the SI in the way of the Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate day and night I'm the preacher I'm the pastor and I'm here to tell you I still got to work on that Lord help me to always be meditating on you if I ain't playing some Good gospel songs I'm meditating on the Lord how many believes if you really want a strong how many wants a stronger Christian life then let's do what this Bible says here wherever you are amen every spare moment you got meditate on the Lord think about him I'm here to tell you it makes me a better preacher it makes me a better husband to my wife it makes me a better dad to my children it makes me a better Grandpa to my grandchildren it makes me a better brother to you amen that right it makes a difference his Delight is in the law of the Lord and on his law does he meditate and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and his Leaf also shall not weather I wanted to sing that song oh I shall not be I shall not be moved I shall not be I shall not be moved just like a tree that's planted by the wad I've anchored in Jehovah I shall not be moved amen wish I knew all those songs but anyway anchored in Jehovah I shall not be moved you shall not be moved all through time it doesn't matter what comes no matter what lions come he'll quench the mouth of the lion he'll shut the mouth of the lion he'll deliver you out of the Paw of the bear he'll deliver you like he did David out of the Paw of the lion and is that what David said when he came up to Goliath he said the god that delivered me out of the P of lion and the bear going to deliver you into my hand amen he's going to deliver you and me out of your hand how many believes that we serve a god like that today I'm glad to serve a living God that delivers you That Forgives you that heals you he's the same God today yesterday and forever and I want to live every day of my life just in that manner that Lord no matter what comes you are the same one closing thought how many knows that this same God doesn't change his ways and if you want to get if you want to get what they got huh if you want to get what they had what do you got to do you got to come the way they came if we'll meet the conditions that they met according to the prophet of God and the Bible if you meet the same conditions they met you'll get the same results can can you imagine brother Tommy walking around in Scottsville or whatever cuz the early Christians from my understand used to drag a cross cross around ain't that right a cross why because they were taking up their cross and following him you were willing to die whatever God said to they were willing to do if you want to get Real Results make sure that you give him a 100% I thought about na na na non I believe it was Elijah told him to go wash Amen in a certain River and right he me go washing the dirty dirty River amen and he got mad he says aren't I I ain't going to read it ain't got time but listen he says you know his servants he came and says I thought he was going to come out here amen and and lay his hands on me and it was going to vanish that's what I expect it you know isn't it something how that if God doesn't things the way do things the way people expect denominations expect well it just ain't going to you know they ain't going to do it but his servant says you know if he' ask you a hard thing wouldn't you have done it and he says yeah I guess you're right so he went over there and he di I'm telling you I think it was seven times how many those amen one less time if he only went one less time than what he was supposed to he never got clean from the leprosy but he did exactly like God said and it happened how many believes when you do according to acts 238 repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the promise is to you to your children children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall go the apostolic days aren't over the days in the fire of the Holy Ghost aren't over no we're living right in the middle of them God is real he just needs surrendered hearts and lives to live this simple humble everyday Christian Life God bless you this morning I hope you enjoyed the word this morning now we want to go and change the order of the service into doing something that the Lord Jesus asked us to do in remembrance of him amen see our whole anchor how many knows everything about what you believe is anchored in one thing and that is in the Cliff of The Rock and when they put a spear he was the Rock and when they put a spear to cause the cleft is that right the blood came out nothing but the blood what will wash away my nothing but the blood our complete confidence in our journey in our destination in the Forgiveness of our sins or anything is in the blood of Jesus Christ that 2,000 years ago this is one place this is one time we do look back brother they always look forward to the Messiah when he would come and he says ever since that the believer looks back at what Jesus did for him on Calvary because when he died on Calvary he said it was finished and it's only our faith in the finished work in the Clift of the rock what Jesus did for us that made all this possible how many glad to be a Christian um I know I said I was about done but I I want to just let me let me just say this I've got a few things wrote down here it says if you're connected to this eternal God he'll be there amen when things go wrong he'll make the right amen when you're in the valley he'll bring you back up out of the mountain amen when you're sick he'll hear heal you amen if you're a sinner and lost he'll find you amen amen when you are getting old you're not going to stay young but when you get older he'll be there amen even when you die he'll be there amen if you're in a battle he'll fight your battle for you you're all to tore up he brings you comfort that's our anchor if people hate you he'll love you amen if you have a need he'll Supply that need amen let's stand we'll change the order to service
