thank god for the grace of god his grace goes beyond anything we could ever calculate with a calculator his grace goes beyond anything we could ever imagine beyond anything we could ever fathom the fact that grace had already declared that we would be saved born again be rapture ready people resurrection ready people before we even took the breath of life or even before it was a body formed goes to speak for how deep and how wonderful is the grace of god i love him so much aren't you happy to be a christian tonight god bless you may be seated for a little bit if you'd like i want to thank you for your many prayers i know um i uh i stand here tonight certainly because of those prayers and the many people that prayed this is probably the second time in my life i've looked death right in the face and this is the second time that i've had the privilege of saying not yet the lord are done with me and i know that i have a purpose on this earth and coming through what i just come through over the past month month and a half i can promise you that whoever tells you or whoever says to me the covet is a myth i'm going to slap him as hard as i can hit him it ain't no myth it's a serious serious thing by the way brother tim i knew him i knew him very well i preached for him many times and matter of fact i was speaking to him the hour right before they put him on the ventilator and um just begging him please don't let him put you on that thing don't let him put you on that thing they was having to do it on a kind of they found blood clots in his lungs and you know we don't know i was thinking of it we don't know exactly why the lord will let this one stay and then take that one but this is why we trust the sovereignty of god because god knows exactly what he's doing he knows why he doesn't and our little puny finite minds we have no business nor do we have a right questioning his great authority and why he makes the decisions he makes and really if we would learn to follow him we'd be better christians all the way around sure would so i pray i appreciate your prayers it's a tough month but technically the doctor cleared me to get back on the road last week and i'm supposed to go to canada but you have to have a certain documentations of immunizations and different things going over and i fell short just a little bit of having everything i needed so i thought well you know i've been sitting around here since august let me think now my last meeting was with brother brooks i think that was the 27th 28th in iowa up there so i've been sitting around here since august 28th itching to kick the devil so i said lord you're gonna have to send me somebody that i can preach for and it wasn't just a few minutes after that but tom ramey can you come wednesday are you feeling all right to come wednesday so we're going to kick the devil for a little while amen now let me just warn you a little bit i don't have all of my strength back a hundred percent i get winded and my breath is a little short but if i have to slow down and preach a little slower tonight uh don't don't let that don't let that strike you as odd okay i'm just monitoring my health taking care of myself and and uh it's not really in the charismatic demonstration of jumping and hollering it's the word of the content of what we're saying anyways and then right and so we appreciate the lord and uh one sister said to me now i know why god gave you them powerful lungs so you could overcome this thing and i i got to laughing because when i come out of the hospital i couldn't hardly talk my lungs everything was so weak after about a week week and a half something like that i couldn't hardly even talk it i you know could hardly get my breath together and uh i i was listening to i think it was the gaither vocal band coming across facebook and they were singing one of them one of them old-fashioned gospel songs real upbeat you know and they're singing about going to heaven and the powers of god and you know and jesus can do anything and i thought you can touch these lungs in this voice right now and you know i started singing with them boys and my voice come right back the power come back right into my lungs and i was i was able to sing right on the spot and sing my wife looking at me she said you couldn't talk five minutes ago and i said that's right victory in jesus my savior forever amen so i'm going to attempt to sing i'm going to try this thing for the glory of god and then we're going to preach a little while now don't get it in your mind that i'm going to be short-winded tonight i'm going to preach [Laughter] man sure love you folks god bless you [Music] i'm going home jesus in the twinkling of an eye i make my reservation for a mansion in the sky i may not know the moment or i may know the day but i know that i'll be leaving when he calls this church away i'm going home with jesus in the twinkling of an [Music] i may not know the moment i may not know the day but i know that i'll be leaving when he calls this church away i'm listening for the trump that'll sound most any time and the crown of life is waiting thank god we'll soon be mine shot through a place called calvary by the precious blood of jesus that trip's been paid i'm go open i've made my reservation for the mansion in the night [Music] oh the captain of the vessel he's calling it on board and the destinations heaven safe on that crystal shore where there will meet our savior no loved one's gone before there to live for all eternity thank god we're going home i'm going home with jesus i made my reservation for a mansion in the sky i may not know the moment and i may not know the day i know that i'll be leaving when he calls his bride away the captain of the vet he's calling get on board and the destinations heaven safe on that crystal shore well there i'll meet my savior and the loved ones gone before there for [Music] for a mansion in the

how many is going when he calls this thank bride lord thank you jesus coughing and kicking let's stand together appreciate the lord tonight thank you for bearing with me we love the lord jesus he's so wonderful to us sydney amen so appreciate god's grace to us i want to speak to you this evening upon i'm not a survivor i'm an overcomer amen i'm not a survivor i'm an overcomer let's turn to ephesians chapter six how many believes that amen i am not a survivor i am not a survivor of lady ladies no sir i'm not going to survive i'm going to overcome it by god's grace you say how are you going to do that by the grace of god we will overcome everything that comes our way don't forget brother brandon said the bride to this last hour she'd have thus saith the lord she'd have the powers of god she'd have mark 16 in action and she would be an invincible army i believe that don't you believe that that's the bride of the last day ephesians chapter 6 verse 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day that's this day today and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loin skirt with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness defeat shod with the preparation the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and the church said amen and amen can we pray over the word of the lord right now while your heads are bowed this evening i would consider it an honor to have an opportunity to pray for you tonight would you like to raise your hand before the lord and say brother ben i have a need tonight something i'd like to share before the lord amen my hands up with you this evening as we pray together heavenly father you see this little body standing here tonight lord none of us not a one of us are sufficient to do a job that would have eternal merit or eternal value we might know how to measure we might know how to run a saw or run equipment or we might know how to do some certain thing on a soul machine but when it comes to eternal things it takes the hand of god to lead us there lead us through it and give us the strength to make it perfect in all our ways so father we submit and commit ourselves to thee tonight knowing lord jesus that thy word will never return to us void we're so grateful to know that as we raise our hand to you this evening not only do you see the requests father but you are already working to answer every knee that was raised up before the body tonight i pray that the holy ghost will come into this place this evening will take your word and speak lord jesus strengthen me as your servant use my mouth tonight to speak to the people only that which you would be pleased with open up the hearts of this thy bride thy body that they might be receptive to hear what the holy spirit would speak unto us tonight and father we look into thy word with great anticipation and expectation knowing that every time the bible is open great things proceed from it so lord we commit ourselves to thee in every way and may your holy ghost come now and minister to the body of jesus christ as we commit this service to you now both speaker and listener in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen the lord bless you may be seated amen what a privilege it is to be a believing christian a believing son and daughter of god do you love the lord say amen one time amen he's wonderful to us amen brother carol used to say quote the little song all the time wonderful wonderful jesus is to me amen i like that because we are living in a time that the word of god is wonderful to us and i i just wanted to pull if you're looking here at me tapping on my phone i had a quote come to my mind and i wanted to read this quote but i somehow failed to get it there but uh it's the first one i pull here jesus christ the same listen to this brother brahman said the word of god will defeat satan anywhere any time any place on any condition the word of god alone it is written will defeat satan he said now that is the truth the written word of god he said just like now he said it's going to hurt you he said but i'm responsible with god's word he said but now before amen he said it is written before satan could say anything to jesus he would hit him back with it is written it is written man shall not live by bread alone it is written he defeated satan on the word of god and every christian in here can defeat satan any place anywhere anytime on the word of god i like that that tells us brother that we don't have to be chickens we could be eagles and i want you to know tonight that god has not designated that you and i would be survivors you know i they were living in a time where it was somebody come through maybe a a great sickness say it's breast cancer or some kind of a thing and even even with covenant in this this time we're living in they come through it on the other side and they'll say i am a survivor of breast cancer i am a survivor of covet i'm a survivor of these different things what a little thought hit me the other day says i thought well if we're looking at it through the eyes of the word of god we're not survivors of any of this but jesus who died two thousand years ago over two thousand years ago my bible tells me that he wounded the head of the serpent now remember what the prophet of god said if you want to kill an animal don't cut his paw off are you with me amen don't feel sorry for me now i want you to preach with me a little while all right now now now notice if you want to kill a human being don't stab him in the leg amen if you want to kill something cut its head off and the effects of all that's with it will go once the head has been cut off amen the prophet tells us that satan that old serpent amen was wounded mortally at calvary where the very head of the devil was cut off amen that means he said sin sickness destruction famine peril sword anything that would accompany amen satan's unbelief and lie of unbelief against the word of god has already been defeated and placed at the feet of jesus christ and every believer i heard i read him say this the other day every believer he said that comes into the foot of calvary amen with that crimson blood falling upon the believer amen and once they are baptized into the body of jesus christ remember out of christ came three elements water blood life the only way to get back into that body is you've got to follow that same pattern water blood and life of god you've got to be justified amen believing on jesus christ amen for your sins as a sinner amen to cleanse you and wash you you must be sanctified by the blood of jesus christ and you must receive the holy ghost in order to enter back into the body of jesus christ but once in that body never forget once you enter back into that realm into that place that body the very propitiation that was made for you amen and the dying lamb of calvary amen the blood even sprinkling upon the earth not only brought back all of the redemptive blessing of god but it also purchased the earth i own this earth because his blood fell on it hallelujah brother may i pause for a moment would somebody grab me a bottle of water it's a little dusty i think maybe it's the reason i'm choking a little bit i thought but somebody's been sucking on it am i going to describe that well if i can chew your chewing gum i might drink your water [Laughter] all right you excuse me but if i'm a part of christ he said every redemptive blessing of god thank there's nothing tonight that's out of our reach don't you listen to that if you've got the holy ghost there's nothing out of your reach not even death can overcome you until our lord and our master says it's time for your card to be pulled from the right brother that's up to him not up to us and we learned a great lesson from hezekiah when it's my time to go i don't want to argue i don't want to become shipwrecked down at the very end because i choose to live on when's my time to go i just want to be able to go i'll never forget when i was in that motel room in connecticut and i was having that great attack with a sugar diabetes and old man death comes stood about eight foot down by me i felt him walk into the room i didn't see anything but i felt him walk in the room like a person would walk in the door and shut it behind him as i lay there in bed i was sitting there like indian style you know my legs crossed over and i was sitting there all at once it seemed like the holy spirit said to me that's death i said yes sir but i didn't fear him i wasn't afraid of him because brother because of the death of the lord jesus christ death is no more to you and i than a buggy [Laughter] come on somebody amen to carry me from this realm into another dimension altogether hallelujah i don't have to fear these things because the head of satan has been cut off so completely that not even death itself can touch a believer did you know that believers don't die did you know that brother man called it a dirt nap they just fall asleep all the believers that have gone through all of these ages all the 2000 years that saints have drawn their last breath and their body go limp and cold those believers simply fell asleep in the arms of jesus they don't have to fear death because death has already been conquered because of his propitiation at calvary uh folks i hope you understand that as deep as we are in this message and as revelated as we try to push ourselves and as many of these big words and terms that we throw around to many of the saints around the world at the end of the day if you don't understand that your sins amen everything that you'll ever be was hanging on that old tree you'll never get anywhere with god until you get that lesson first because you can't save yourself i i know i'm in legalist territory with all these amis around here but i don't mean to hurt your feelings but you can't save yourself i can't live good enough to get there i have no merits to be able to present to him remember danny greenfield the great evangelist he said i thought i was a pretty good guy oh maybe a lie here there or something like that he said but then when i got in the presence of that light brother tom he said everything i ever even thought he said started showing up before me it goes to prove brother that the propitiation of calvary was necessary for you and i to be overcomers without the cross and without the death of the cross and without jesus bearing the sin mark in his body satan would still have rule over every one of us do you understand that up until the death of our lord jesus that we were completely enslaved to satan even those that had a seed as brethren tells the spoken words original seed he said there was the saints of god that old testament they had the seed but they had no water the holy ghost so when they died they went to paradise but satan had total control dominated them in many cases oh you don't think so just look at moses moses could not control his temper and kept him out of the promised land you know why he didn't have a holy ghost had he been born again he'd have been able to control his temper and the saints said amen huh had had david had the ability to control his urges i'm not saying that people that make mistakes and do things wrong lose their temper some don't have the holy ghost but how far can a man go how far can a woman go before you start questioning is there a new birth there the prophet even said in the hebrew series that a dove might lighten a bar room but he'll get out of there eventually quick it doesn't mean that people won't backslide do things wrong but the very essence of the holy ghost gives them power over the thing that would dominate and control them oh i hope somebody's hearing me tonight this is the reason why sometimes we feel so powerless have you ever felt that way you wake up in the morning and something may be going on or some little thing happening in your life and you think to yourself i can't control this you're right but the holy ghost within you praise god that baptism of the holy ghost on the inside of you can control the situation if you'll just let him have hold of it i i don't mean to sound skeptical but this is where we fail because we we're not really so much confident that god can handle it we say we believe that we claim we believe that but we don't act like we believe that you know how i know that because how many times have you taken a situation into your hands tried to fix it tried to make it better even after you declared up here at the altar or wherever it was and testified i'm giving it to god let him handle it that lasts all of about oh five minutes 48 seconds and then as soon as something jumps up we grab right ahold of it again instead of releasing our control and saying lord you take over come on now be honest with me now i'm not trying to de-christianize you but how many times have you fallen into that trap and yet the real reason we do it is because we have not entrusted in this propitiation i'm preaching on we have not allowed ourselves to rest in the finished work of calvary brother sister please don't misunderstand what i'm getting to say but this is the reason if there is a delay to the rapture this is it it is not because we don't have great mysteries it is not because we don't have great understanding of those mysteries but at the end of the day it's because we have not fully surrendered ourself to the finished work of calvary in our lives you might as well preach his coughing kicking and all i'm coming huh because brother realize something if we really had that kind of confidence do you understand there is nothing that could shake us nothing that could move us no matter what would come our way nothing could shake us off that foundation oh you said oh brother ben ah they've pumped so much stuff and you you went brain dead let me tell you what your bible said in the book of peter we go to second peter chapter one he's talking about all them great virtues in there we'd like to preach on go to the end of those verses and look at what peter said those virtues do for you they make you but you can't fall now even like tabernacle i'm going to ask you this question you don't have to answer me vocally but just in your heart when are we going to arrive at the place to where we truly can be so rested in this finished work of the lord jesus until no matter if we're laying in a hospital bed or or we're bankrupt or no matter what's going on around us there is a peace we might be troubled sure we might be upset absolutely might be confused absolutely but but beyond all of that if you dig deeper you know what i'm talking about if you go beyond all of that outward emotion and all those outward manifestations and you really start digging down for a real believer that is rested in the finished work of calvary no matter what somebody might be telling them in their ear there's a peace on the inside maybe bankrupt today but god's got a purpose maybe he's sick today but god's got a purpose so and so may have died but god's got a purpose do you understand this is where our prophet arrived in the last moments of his life in the last years of his life he come to the conclusion that christ is in control of it all i've quoted this to you a million times but allow me to back it up with these words go back to patmos vision he said a man that is fully surrendered to god fully not partially not halfway fully surrendered to god is omnipotent now being settled in the finished work of calvary does not mean that we won't get sick for these by the time i'm searching for a nice word but it's hard under the anointing imbeciles don't sound nice idiots probably don't play i'll just put a blank there and let you all figure it out but for these people that run around the message going the bride's never going to get the covet the bride's never going to get cancer the bride's never what kind of stupid juice have you been drinking that's about like saying of the prophet of god a drunk driver is never going to kill the prophet let me tell you something brother satan has access to this body not control over it access and if god permits him to allow things come through your life or allow this thing to happen or that thing to happen you're going to either trust or you're going to flounder i was talking to an individual the other day brother ben do you realize that some people are saying that the vaccine is the mark of the beast i said this because they don't listen to tapes that's because they don't read the message the mark of the beast has nothing to do with a vaccine the mic of the beast has nothing to do with all this nonsense people keep barking about the the real mark of the beast friend is rejecting the holy ghost it's rejecting your message in the hour you're living your day and your hour okay hang on everybody there's nothing we can do about covet there is nothing we can do about cancer there is nothing we can do oh you say we'll build hospitals yes we'll come up with a a certain medical yes and if god permits it to work you'll do it and it'll be succeed don't forget brother adam is the very one that took vaccines going overseas even though he didn't want he did because he said god allowed medicines like that to come on the earth to help us he said i pray for doctors i pray for hospitals sure because all good things come down from the father of lights in whom there is no variableness now i'm not trying to preach to you tonight why not go get your vaccine that's up to you you do what you want but the point i'm making to you is a lot of these conditions around us that we try to to to manage by saying oh it's bride people you know what we many many many years ago some of you here uh that go back with me i'm a 70s baby okay and some of you go far beyond that i can take brother floyd and some of them science they've been in this thing a long time in the early days of this message we thought everybody was angels until we found out someone was the kind that rides motorcycles you'll get it tomorrow we found out not everybody that called william branham's name was really saints what a shock it was to us to find out that we're homosexuals in the message child molesters in the message lesbians and whoremongers in a message oh my god you mean there's people in the message that lie it like to took the wind out of some of us when we found out certain leaders did certain things you know why because we have this idea of control and we have created this message utopia around us everything is fine nothing to see here move along and when it boils down to it the reason many people cannot go on with the lord is because they've never fully rested in the finished work of calvary it doesn't mean we're not going to get sick but what it means is while i'm sick while i'm taking medicines while the doctors are doing what they can for me nurses doing what they can for me i'm trusting the lord father you put me in this position you allowed me to be here you have a reason for it whatever the testimony is going to come out of this let it be red hot let it let it be so red hot let it be so powerful shake the shingles off the roof but friends let's be honest how many times do we get right in the middle of that heat and all of a sudden we start getting scared fearful worried are you are you ever going to come to the place to where you can hit a spiritual message button and never worry again don't kid yourself you'll always worry you'll always have fear sure those things will always be a part of your human nature but beyond all that dig underneath all of that because you see the bride is likened to the moon feeling good to start preaching now you all ready to preach the prophet of god set the moon as we know controls he said the tide the sun is the lord jesus and he said the moon is the church it has no light of its own glory to god but when the sun begins to beam i was in washington sometime ago in one of the aerospace um museums of smithsonian's and and somebody i heard him say moon rock i'd always wanted to see moon rock you know i thought i would see something out of you know out of the jetsons or something like that it'd be some glowing rock you know floating in the air some kind of a thing it was just an old stupid rock i thought what's so spectacular about this it comes from the moon and then as i stood there looking at that little piece of rock dead lifeless had no color had no light the lord began reminding me you see its problem is he told me that rock there is out of its position he said because allow one of these astronauts the ability to take it and put it back in its rightful position when my light would shine on it it would reflect the glory of the sun i thought oh god how is that for so many believers that get disjointed dysfunctional they get they get they get a such an abusive thing in their mind oh i'm no good i'm sorry i'm this i'm that you're right you're nothing but a dumb rock but in your position and in your place let that sunshine on you one time and the glory of this the glory of his majesty hallelujah will shine right through you like it does the rest of the moon as you see he said the moon controls the tide he said the moon will turn to worship the lord he said the tide waters will start getting out of order he said that moon's like a policeman he swings around there's a stop he puts that tide back in its place the prophet of god likened this to sin and the attributes of sin listen the very thing that the lord jesus put a stop to at calvary is the very thing you've been given to govern over he said what does that mean he said the sin that once ruled you you now rule it and not only that he goes on to say you have overcome it overthrown it handcuffed it and threw it in prison [Laughter] but it's up to us how we're going to view this some of you that's got lasting conditions in your body diabetic high blood pressure scoliosis might be abnormalities in your flesh and your body and and somehow the devil tries to convince you that because of those things you don't have any faith but what satan is failing to share with you okay can i just expose him what he is failing to share with you my friend is that none of that in the flesh has anything to do with your confidence in calvary i mean what are we supposed to expect it is appointed unto man wants to die that means every one of us have an appointment that's what i loved about enoch people wondered about enoch god take him up like that i said it's simple the man that made the appointment can be the same man to cancel it he just canceled enoch's appointment don't be deceived there's going to be a few alive and remain that's going to have their appointments canceled as well [Laughter] glory to god elijah was the same way this isn't so much canceled as postponed did you imagine being taken up into heaven all them years well it's been every bit of four or five thousand years probably elijah has been enjoying the paradises and the beauties of god and then god will send him right back down to the earth to suffer death it's a marvel isn't it but it goes to prove once again god's sovereignty i don't imagine elijah will come back to this earth in whatever way you believe he's going to come but he's going to die one of the other i don't believe when he takes the breath of life and then not takes the breath of life that he's gonna be going back in that dimension cry to god god i'm elijah the prophet would you let me die for he's going to know like the rest of us death where is your sting crave where is your victory listen at these words let them sing to you don't let these be just repetitious quotes the prophet of god said to a believer death is no more than a bluff and yet we get so scared when a doctor looks at us and says cancer or some other thing should we be so i'm giving you grace in this matter because humanly speaking it's nine impossible not to be worried it'd be almost impossible if a doctor said to me i had six months to live you mean to tell me you're so spiritual that your flesh wouldn't go what come on don't you all look at me like that you want me to tell me if the doctor told you you had some incurable disease that there wouldn't be a part of you go lord i i don't want to die now sure there's always that element there but again this is what satan is not sharing with you none of that has anything to do with your confidence in a finished work at calvary oh i feel the holy ghost in this place god quicken it to us lord make it real so you see when life is coming look at a woman when she's carrying a child if i use improper words for some of you forgive me i understand some people get offended we talk about a woman being impregnated or something of that nature but brother brown talked about how that when a woman is pregnant he said that little life on the inside of her forgive me he said it's drawing from her she gets sick brother carol i i used to love the way that he would describe this i quote him a lot because he was my pastor for 15 years y'all i knew the man since i was 16. he married my wife and i dedicated all my kids i preached alongside him for many many years and if i heard him say it once i heard him say it a thousand times i'm not contagious by the way he made the remark to me one time like this he said think of that woman he said there she's standing there cooking some eggs and bacon fine everything's going fine in the day and said all of a sudden that bacon hits her nose and she goes he said what's going on ben there's another life there that's drawing from the outside scripture tells us that in her conception it'll be sorrowful carrying the child will be sorrowful there'll be many of those conditions that will come during the nine months ever how long that might be if it's jessica louise norad she was so interested in getting into this world quickly in the middle of our family she got here four weeks early nosy thing and there was something about the trials of that that you would look and you'd say what an awful thing to put a woman through you know this is the reason some of our modern women have dogs and cats instead of children they think it's horrible for a man to put them through that and looking on the outside you would think terrible but don't forget the reason all of that's happening on the outside there's a life on the inside did you ever stop to think why trials come your way while you wake up one morning in a phone call or something somebody will say to you at church will cause a change or reaction in you you know why that's happening there's a life on the inside and that life is drawing these things into your life you being a christian just naming the name of jesus christ put your head on a chopping blonde come on somebody the very fact that you even say you're born again puts a target on you a bull's eye right on your forehead don't think these things peter said these fiery trials to be strange they said they're not strange don't think some odd thing has happened to you in the church book the prophet said trials and tribulations are a natural normal part of a christian's life there is nothing we can do about them he said but commit their final outworking to the hands of god in other words in my language tonight have confidence in the finished work that's going to get you through to the other side of this you look at those folks fed the lions burn at the stakes and the whole bit like and you think of yourself the world must look at these people like they're losers we look at them like they're winners why why do we have such a perspective of that because we realize what they were fighting for they wasn't trying to survive they were overcoming can i say something how can you overcome if there's nothing set before you to overcome maybe god won't take it away maybe god won't let it come out of your life maybe some preacher can't pray it off of you because it's your battle your fight excuse this it's your pregnancy and the thing that is affecting you it's affecting you because something new a new birth a fresh creation something's got to be wrong with us you mean as a christian you're going to go through bad things yeah but i thought christianity was a wonderful thing it is but there's going to be a lot of hard times come with it a lot of troublesome things come along but i don't want you to forget this the word of god will defeat satan any place be it in the church be in your bedroom in front of a computer be it on your job on a machine being in a hospital bed or be in a pulpit any place anytime whether you're feeling sick whether you're feeling well whether you're happy whether you're sad under any circumstance you might say i'm so low i can't even hold my head up spiritually under any condition the word of god will defeat the devil every time so then what am i supposed to do oh i'm so glad you asked me i've been waiting all night for you to ask me that question we read it take unto you the whole armor of god i want to look at it for a moment just a little bit and we'll go i got no idea what time it is and it's probably a good thing for me for me wherefore take unto you okay stop right there did you notice it didn't say take unto them you y o u this shows us this is a personal individual warfare forgive me i cannot fight your battles for you i pray for you and hold your hands up when you get weak but i cannot fight your battle for you when you go to brother tom or brother floyd or some other minister or somebody in the church you've got confidence in and you're asking them for advice you're always saying the thing how do i how how what do i do how do i you you understand you skipped over the main part of it to try to find an answer you're never going to find from somebody else i just read to you how to fight how what the answer is and how to fight you want to know how to whip it want to know how to beat it take unto you the whole armor of god 99 of the time if you'll investigate your losses it is because you didn't fight when the thing come at you talk to me tonight church i need to hear you this is one of these messages where you can't sit quiet on me now your participation in this tonight is is key to understanding and releasing the anointing upon you to receive what i'm talking about it's essential for you to get this you only need to amend this with your mouth but you need to open spirit and all the gates of your spirit your body and your soul and say god let this thing so pierce my being until i am different from this night on i walk out of here completely different altogether because if not it's just another protractive sermon preached nice about calvary they ain't going to do no good for nobody take unto you the whole armor of god that ye will stand in the evil day and then here's here's a great key for all of us and having done all to stand stand there it goes to prove even paul is describing to us in this very first part of introducing the armor of god he's trying to tell us you're not always going to have the answers remember your participation is key now don't don't don't think to yourself that you're always going to know how to turn don't think to yourself you're always going to know how to yield the sword or how to hold your shield there's going to be moments of your life and your walk with god you're not going to know the answer so what do i do stan don't go forward don't go backwards stand what ground you've got and hold it there until the lord moves you [Applause] but you say brother ben that sounds pretty boring that sounds a little bit uh lazy even but do you understand that part of healing is not always when they're standing there on the front lines with the big medicines piercing that needle into you or or or shoving in that antibiotic or beepers beeping and all these things going off around you know part of the essential part of healing sometimes it's just to do nothing and rest amen i'm glad you said it your participation is key because the victory tonight is going to come out of your mouth i'm telling you that in the name of the lord the victory you get out of this building now this sermon tonight it's going to come out of your mouth tonight if you're going to walk out of here different you're going to speak it sitting right there in the views i'm telling you that in the name of the lord because nothing i would say from this right here is going to change anything until you're willing to possess these words he said brother ben that scares me why well i don't know what to do yes you do stand don't move be patient wait glory i'm so glad he put that in there brother tom there's a lot of victory in just waiting sometimes brother sister god will park you and make you wait don't forget the bible said they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength and rise up not only will you be renewed but you'll rise up again waiting has power in it if we're willing to wait upon the lord now waiting upon yourself that's different that'll get you in trouble because remember not always the sins you do sometimes it's the neglection of the things you're not doing that you should be doing so it's not the waiting upon yourself among you praise god now notice this stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth what is that the word of god now notice the area of the body that paul is likening this to is the place where progeny or seed is planted so truth being a seed jesus saying so that the word of god was a seed then the loins of truth represent the passing of seed life let me give you an example what i mean if you're standing in a situation and you don't know what to do but all of a sudden you feel inspired by hold it by the holy ghost to speak the word that is the passing of the seed of life from the loins of truth that because his word will not return void it will always find a betting ground that may not do it today but later will produce victory in you praise god in other words paul is telling us we are not spiritually sterile we are not just used as some object to look pretty standing in a corner we're not mannequins but we have the ability to pass the seed word oh listen in spoken words original seed i believe it's also on christ the mystery he repeats it but a believer can pass eternal life to another believer what is that the loins of truth you know sometimes it works like this you might be talking to somebody in a store and you might not know what to say to them all of a sudden the holy spirit will come right at that very moment and just drop something into you and you'll pass that word on to that person that's the loins of truth remember satan has the ability to impregnate with the seed of discrepancy again some of you folk if those words offend you you forgive me but i i'm quoting from the message i'm just saying that brother bram said it satan can impregnate by seed of discrepancy but satan cannot reproduce that seed it's hybrid and it comes to its end that's why i mule don't know who its mommy is don't know who its daddy is and he cannot trace its bloodline back nowhere but we that have been hallelujah endued with the with a with the loins of truth the seed of truth we could trace our bloodline and plum back to the beginning like a thoroughbred horse some of you kentuckians i'll be screaming amen this is where them horses come from hallelujah they've got papers they can go all the way back to their great great great they're not confused about who they are the pharisees thought they had that one down jesus just saw that little mystery for him you wanna know where you come from the devil why do you accuse me of sin because i say that i'm the son of god yes i tell you i came from god and i go back to him for he is the lord didn't he also tell us don't take thought when you come before magistrate and judges in that hour what is that the loins of truth how is it going to be at the resurrection and the rapture that you and i will have the ability to speak and our bodies obey that confession and it will change right around us because i believe the holy ghost will place the words in our mouth when the hour arrives change you believe what you want to that's what i believe i believe the seed of truth will fall into our bodies our minds our mouths and at the permission of the holy ghost with his mind in us we'll be able to speak with that voice of the resurrection don't forget divine healing is only the evidence that there is a divine resurrection coming hallelujah notice again having the breastplate of righteousness again the masterpiece the prophet of god said i watched that that parade go by he said and i thought of that great hour when them saints will come by proudly displaying the blood of jesus christ the message of god for the day they lived in upon their chest the breastplate of righteousness why was it located over the chest that's where your soul's at there's a little compartment inside your heart science still can't figure it out that's where your soul resides hallelujah showing that i am not righteous because of my righteousness but my heart is righteous because he recovers me with his breastplate [Applause] thank you jesus oh yes sir having your feet shod listen with the preparation of the gospel of peace i wish i had time to break all these little phrases and things down to you i got so many greek words and things i could bring in here right now i would be here the rest of the night but this word peace that he uses here feet shod but the preparation of the gospel of peace simply means we are no longer at war with god at one time you fought him argued with him wrestled with him that's the reason why if you had old-fashioned conviction anywhere your knuckles were white grabbing the end of the bench you were still wrestling with him until you found out his spirit will not always strive with man when you got yourself right with god the war was over and instead of standing there still at war with god you see this is the reason a woman paints her face the reason heathens do it too subconsciously they don't realize it but when you paint your face you're showing that you're at war with god and every woman that puts mascara on her eyes or puts blush or rouge or some of that stuff on their face and i i know sister but you understand my meaning brother i'm talking about pale cheeks you know on the sister might put a little something on there and pancake or something but you see these girls running around there their eyes black and message girls are just as guilty they do what they call the natural look they still put makeup on but they make it look natural same devil just a different package everyone that does it is showing that they're at war with god one thing's for sure ladies you keep that stuff off your face if you want to be pleasing to the lord because you don't do that to me god you do it to me to man or to look like some kind of a thing to somebody else sure my feet are now shod what is my feet think it's the foundation of who if my feet don't work then i can't stand so how am i going to stand there for being completely dressed how am i going to stand if i have no foundation paul is saying your very foundation of who you are is being at peace with god some of you might think tonight well i'm not at war with him really okay can i challenge that can i challenge you that okay good thank you for your permission i was gonna do it anyways but i just want to be nice about it but if we were genuinely at peace with god like we should be and we would not allow so many questions to come into our hearts when bad stuff happens to us ever get mad and feel like you're gonna quit i i know you probably won't admit it in church but you ever come to the place where you like forget this stuff i've had enough you know what's going on it is a part of you there's a part of you that is still at war with god you have not settled yourself that i'm going to trust him no matter what comes my way so you've got to put your shoes on lace them up time tight and stand still freeze i just love how we hit them big crescendos and you folks are hey man and i bear down on you like this and you are quiet as the nazarenes that's good that's good when you're thinking that's good when you're thinking last one we'll go home notice he says and above all taking the shield of faith all right now i'm going to take this slow because i don't want you to miss these words wherewith ye shall be able to quench all now now for those of you that want to live a life of 90 uh it's okay maybe this thing will come along and this thing can get through and i'll let this pass because you know after all i'm living 90 right do you understand the holy ghost give us our shield to stop all that satan sends our way even the little pet besetting sins that we put up with every day of our life come on church he did not give us our shield to just allow this to come allow that to happen this to pass ah you know no big deal you know as a prophet of god said that a christian is praying up every hour that's exhausting so is holding a shield in a battle but you better get this through your brain and let it fall deep into your heart get this right tonight not tomorrow not a minute from now right now get this straight in your heart yes it's exhausting to check up every hour but you better remember that every single hour of your life satan is hurling darts at you you see we undervalue the importance of these things because we don't realize the purpose behind it why would i need to check up every hour because i'm in a fight it's exhausting to think that every moment you've got to be oh lord i'm sorry god forgive me uh help me but what do you think it's like for them soldiers out there when there's bombs and there's guttery and there's all kinds of things going on around y'all reckon they're going i'm just so wore out i think i'll just lean up against this and relax for a bit scroll through facebook scroll through the gram young people will get that instagram y'all don't call it the crab if he does it he'll be dead in five minutes he has to stay on his toes he has to watch every moment because he's under attack if you even take a breath satan uses that moment to figure out how to work on you next exhausting in it but here's the beauty of all this when i need rest when i need to rest from the war he hides me in his pavilion until then i better fight and i better not lay down my sword and i better not put my shield down because it's a warfare take the helmet of salvation this word literally means when you start breaking it out the soul the helmet of your salvation your brain this is the gateway to your soul this simply means protect your soul young people this is the reason you hear preachers preaching against things i i'm not altogether convinced that preachers even know why they're preaching against him sometimes without any research or any study at all they just get the idea in their brain it's dangerous it's going to hurt people so they just run to the platform and start railing on it but really remember try not to be critical of preachers like that because what you don't realize is what they're trying to do is they're trying to protect you from taking things into your soul that ain't right and at the end of the day if a brother is railing against facebook or you know one of these type of things at the end of the day understand you're an individual and you are answerable to god for what you look at on your phone for what kind of connections you make i guarantee one thing my facebook is sanctified because if it ain't i make sure it is i had a post come through on a guy the other day and he had a it was one of these pictures of brother branham and somebody was kneeling before it and there was a quote above it where brother brown was talking about a sister who kneeled before that picture one in houston and said god and started praying let the pillar of fire and let this of brother breanna and she was praying in the manor and that picture there like that and i thought you sneaky devil so you know what i done took my little finger and i went unfriend block i may be a preacher i may have served him for 30 years but i don't let my soul become a trash can i got cousins and everything that wouldn't speak to me except for social media they're just those type of people in a phone call they don't nothing they'll write me all the time asking for prayer their feeds are filthy cuss words all kinds of stuff you know what i do take my little finger i go up hide so i don't have to see it we all need a helmet for our soul folks last one the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and we know it's a double-edged sword right that's coming and going divides asunder it also hebrews 4 12 discerns not only your thoughts and and your your your mind but it also discerns your intentions god knows what we intend to do i i've shared this with you many years ago but i i don't know if you remember me sharing this about brother branham when he went out there under that complex brother brown was going to quit and become a trapper he hadn't made plans he hadn't bought traps he hadn't bought land he hadn't even told his wife and his kids about it yet but god saw what he intended to do and give him a vision of standing in a trash dump so lord with thy word not only cut out bad thoughts and evil thinking and but cut out evil intentions don't let me make plans let me trust in your plans i'm gonna have to quit time's gone ain't none of y'all ever gonna believe i'm sick preaching this long and none of y'all probably made up it's a hoax right ain't nothing wrong with that kid preached an hour and 40 minutes what i'm trying to tell you brother sister is at the end of the day when paul is dressing this soldier up and he's getting us ready for our march and we start off in the marching time understand this the word he said the sword of the spirit the word of god is nigh thee even in your mouth that's why i told you tonight your participation is key to the success of this message tonight and in his holy name what you speak here tonight and those pews is going to determine your changes when you walk out of here father thank you this evening time for the greatness of your presence as your son i'm very grateful lord that you've given me the strength to be able to preach tonight and thank you for the tenderness of your children lord i only preach maybe an hour some but i always tease them about being long-winded i think sometimes lord what we really need to know is where we stand in all of this preachers say so many words and we leave out the main part which is where do i belong in all of this so lord i'm stretching my hand over your children tonight and i'm asking lord god that you will come into this place and that you'll let every one of them find their place and what i've preached tonight let their mouths be filled with your word let them speak their deliverance let them speak their victory let them speak their overcoming we don't want to barely make it through and survive but taking unto us the shield of faith i want to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked help us my lord in jesus name amen can we stand to our feet tonight says y'all musicians hallelujah this is what i want to do i want us to close our eyes one more time raise both our hands and while you're standing there tonight i want you to speak speak your deliverance speak your victory just speak it
