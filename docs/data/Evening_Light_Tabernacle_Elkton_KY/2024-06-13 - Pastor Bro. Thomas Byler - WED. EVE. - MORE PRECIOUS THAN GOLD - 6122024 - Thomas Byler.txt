Lord in prayer before we read his word Lord Jesus father we just take a deep breath father and want to just let go of all cares and all the worries of the day and any anxiety any kind of anything that would just hinder you from being able to move father in a special way and we just ask God Lord that you'll take me Lord Jesus even as we've taken this instrument Lord Jesus and try to to get it to go and trying to get it work so where sound would come across it father and that's what we do desire Lord that you do even in my heart with my mouth and my mind that use me Father Lord Jesus to speak the words that you once spoken father and Lord to discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart speak to those needs that are represented here tonight Lord and come father and do just exactly what you want to do Lord Jesus we ask God that we just give ourselves completely into your hands Lord Jesus and that you would use us father to bring honor and glory to yourself not bringing any glory to any man father father for we're not worthy of any glory Lord but you're worthy of all the glory we ask God the meditation of my heart father the last few days different things Lord over a period of time that you've laid on my heart to speak God that you just help me now Lord Jesus to delivered in the way that you want to deliver it Lord Jesus bless the reading of the word father as we turn back the pages of your holy RIT Lord knowing god that Lord this written word is you in letter form father and so as we eat this food God that you've given us Lord we pray God that we would become it father and become more like you a heart's desire father for being here tonight is to be more like you Lord Jesus you've predestinated us to be conformed to the image of your son and God you're doing a work into people's lives Lord tonight and we ask God that you just continue that work now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen and Amen brother Glenn I know you was asked me if I had a part three and I didn't at the time but we' just been praying and so he gave me a part three all right so he answered your prayer amen so amen y'all blame brother Glenn amen no not really but anyway God is good isn't he I've certainly enjoyed this little series amen the Lord's given me and so we have one more here today amen talking about releasing the power of God amen amen so if you will turn your Bibles we'll go to First Peter first Peter the first chapter I only have three or four scriptures I only had one to begin with then I got another one and then I got another one and then I got another one so we'll just see what the Lord has amen it's good to see everybody tonight I trust everything's going good for you so far amen praise the Lord we're certainly looking forward to the upcoming meetings Amen in two weeks amen with brother Tim puit amen we'll have a Sunday morning Serv service and I think we'll have a carrying afterwards if that's all right just to have Fellowship together having a little more Fellowship of time of Fellowship Amen in 1 Peter 1 and verse amen let's go with U verse three blessed be the god of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope amen I like that Lively hope don't you amen by the the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and that the that and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you that's some big and heavy words right there amen who are kept I like this one who are kept by the power of God full temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ reations 3 amen and 18 Revelations 3 and 18 and then I want to back up am me and pick up just a couple of thoughts here amen with the help of Lord Lord and will just start somewhere amen and stop somewhere amen because there's no really any beginning or End Amen all right so 18 3:18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and I ano th eyes with I have that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be SE be seated amen um amen I'm not exactly sure what how I titled this amen I titled it the gold of God but then I told my wife to title it more precious than gold more precious than gold amen how many has a desire in their heart Amen to see more of God and to see more of the power of God Amen somehow to see the release a more of a release of the power of God amen amen that's no doubt what every one of us amen desire to have and so tonight we want to go in just a little bit different direction Something That We're all very familiar with something that I've preached so many times amen until I don't really want to preach on it anymore but if the Holy Spirit tells me to preach on it again we'll preach on it again amen because how many believes it must be necessary if God keeps bringing us this back to us amen amen it has to do with trials it has to do with suffering it has to do with amen the gold of God trials amen something that's more precious than gold amen and so tonight as we begin to think about power we realize that the prophet of God said that you know power without what is is satanic power without character is satanic and so we realize that God uh is always wanting to give us more of his power he's wanting to give us more of himself isn't that right amen and so so so that we can have those things that we desire to have and we're certainly living in an age brothers and sisters that's a real testing age it's a real trial age isn't that right every age that ever was down through any time period always had their tests always had their trials isn't that right always had the things that they had to overcome amen for example 68 million through the Dark Ages had to be willing to have their heads sh chopped off to be burned at the stake to be fed to Lions to be thrust through with a sword every imaginable way of death that you can imagine amen horrible horrible horrible things that happened to Christians but yet by the grace and by the power of God they were able to overcome amen because we already know that there's only one thing that you take out of this world only one thing that you take out and I want to ask something a little different to it amen it is the very thing that God Treasures the most and it's what God wants out of us and that is character amen character is a nature now first of all I want to first talk a little bit about the Old Testament we could come all the way up down through there but let's talk about the power of God in manifestation now I know uh let me just bring a quote up if I could amen we'll jump over here a few back here I don't have very many he says a man under pressure is what he is under pressure isn't that right the true real characteristics will show when he's under pressure so one of the things that really brings out the power of God is pressure amen how many knows trials are pressure tests are pressure and every son that comes to God must be chasen must be tried must be tested amen because before you can really if you're really going to have more of the power of God you're going to have to have more character amen amen and character is just never made on a flowery bed of ease character comes through suffering and mo and so forth amen but we always see that God brings us into tight places into pressure points so to speak I don't like it you don't like it I pray that God has already tested me tried me amen and that I've passed the test that I ain't got to take it anymore that's the way I feel about it a couple of amens but hey if you just want more go ahead and raise your hands say God just give me some more of that you know I'm tough oh man if you ask for you're probably going to get how know you better be careful what you ask for but even asking for the power of God if you want more of the power of God God has to bring you to those places to where he can show his great power isn't that right it was when uh that Israel come to that Red Sea and that pressure of Amen not being able to go forward up down or other any other way isn't that when God stepped on the scene that's when he stepped on the scene that's when they begin to see the power of almighty God Amen praise the Lord why does God let troubles come God harnesses troubles he puts bits in the mouth and makes it obey him God speak today don't you just love to meet somebody that when the pressure comes when the pressure's on when the trial's there they can stay calm they don't get all excited about it they don't get all frustrated about it they just say well just hold on don't get all excited you know it's not that big a deal God will take care of it just put your faith in God God loves that he loves that amen listen and God harnesses it I've even I've even heard brother Daniel gon say man if you got troubles and trials and not terrible things happen to you don't blame the devil blame God I was like what what's this man saying all these troubles and trials and everything come to you way yeah how many knows he harnesses he put bits in his mouth he don't let anything to happen to you without his permission I got to thinking how how many believes like sister Sher and you know that cancer that claims that she that it's on you know she says I'm in God's hands that's what every one of us want to say I'm in God's hands ain't that right amen and if God allows troubles to come if he allows disease to come brother bam said he allows it amen to show his power amen and to give you a testimony so that you can say boy I was in trouble boy a bunch of bad stuff happened to me but I got on my knees and I trusted God and I just give it to him and man and he worked it all out God gets the glory I'm here to tell you that's the kind of God that I serve that's where you see the power of God in tight places in pressure places that's where he loves to show up in the darkest of our then Jesus comes amen desperation when people are in desperation Dan when Jesus comes amen that's when the power of God many times is released amen because uh whether you know it or not a lot of times it's not you being under test it's God under test ain't that right when do three Hebrew children says we don't know if God's going to whether he's not but we're not going to bow to your image because we believe him let me tell you God was under under test we're g to find out whether God's going to deliver these boys that truly trust them with trust him with his lives or not ain't that right they trusted God with their lives it have been just a little sad if God wouldn't have showed up well they thought maybe he'd come but they're crispy fried down there huh cuz that's what they'd have been seven times hotter than original that's right but God said no no no no no uhuh I'm coming on down the Angels wanted to come down Angels come up and said man I'm the angel of water I'll flood that place I like I'm so glad that we're serving a God that cares about what you say about him I forget just what it was I seen it on YouTube where where where a country and and they had a big parade and they were mocking Jesus a't that right few days later that whole city almost was drown hundreds of them was lost mudslides just a catastrophe happened to that town God's not mocked another boy just some old boy amen mocking God and saying stuff he says you know he come back on the interview he says now what did you say that you was poisoned you got poisoning and man your luggage was lost you had the most horrible Sak that you ever had what was it that you said he said well I ain't even saying it again he said don't ask me to say it again I'll never say it again not after that experience why God knows God is listening when you testify and when you believe God God hears he said he knows and he won't be mocked and he gets put under the test is he going to come on the scene or not amen how many believes it's on God we he put our names on the book he gave us an unconditional Covenant that I saved you I saved you I put your name on the book he that have begun a work good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus how many's relying on that I'm relying on God's power not my ability Adam in a perfect State couldn't keep his word man can't keep his word so God says I'm going to save you despite yourself wo my goodness if that don't do something to you you're like the little boy or little kid at the C not the candy store but the jingle store that Mama took the little kid kid ain't that right and he had some kind of deformity it just wasn't aware it wasn't alert things she was just in a day somewhere went to the doctor says and the doctor says it's a little better took it to the store and jingled this and jingled that and it didn't do nothing she begin to creep no it's not better it's not better wo brother B says man they had gifts they had that they had this out of the other and still it didn't move them God help us let the word of God move us the power of God Amen isn't that right that's right oh my brother bam says you know there was no rainbow until after the flood after Noah after Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and 40 lights and nights in a storm little Ark pitching up and down the water and so forth but after it was over Dan he saw the rainbow the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of Promise after that he had went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way that you see the Promise after you've went through the tribulation I like the poem must I be carried home on a flowery bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and saes of bloody Seas amen we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best thing that he can give us trials and tribulations that's better than Comforts and peace our Comforts and peace amen just amen are for Beyond his life amen listen to what he says it was not until the Hebrew children was forced into that fiery furnace until the fourth man ain't that right showed up how many's glad then when you get in that fiery furnace when you get in that hard trial watch keep an eye he's going to show up watch that's where he likes to show up in those hard times in those hard places amen amen that's right even Daniel who purposed in his heart that he wouldn't defile himself isin't that right Daniel had to put be put under amen government law that was made a decree amen that you aren't supposed to pray and they tricked him and they trapped him ain't that right oh I'm here to tell you something tonight the devil thinks that he's got you trapped he thinks he's going to drown you with lukewarm and layad AIA and riches and the cares of this life the prees of riches and so forth brother BR that's what people in this hour are are are tested with but I don't know about you but I'm I'm telling you I'm not going to let any any sin any other other thing amen take the power of God out of my life no not out of yours either why because God is looking for people in this Leia age I like this and I hadn't really seen this before but if you'll notice Jesus says come by of me gold tried into fire how many knows gold represents deity God's character is that right so he says come and give me my character amen cuz how many knows the character Jesus had was tested it was tested on the mountain it was tested amen with the Devils that he had to cast out in every manner it was tested it was tried even down into death all the way to hell it was testing to come back again buried Stone rolled that stone in front of him anden it was proved he had the power to come back out that's the kind of gold I want something's going to bring me out of the Grave amen praise the Lord amen I think brother B you're just way too loud you just way too happy in the Lord until I was watching a little something today and and a man come on there and says he read a scripture he says where Paul said rejoice in the lord always rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice how many believe we ought to Rejoice a little bit we ought to have a little happiness when we realize what we got this is what we're doing showing you a little bit of what we got why we ought to be the happiest people why we ought to be rejoicing Paul in the state he was in would tell us all Rejoice Rejoice always and again I say rejoice because we got something to Rejoice about if you've got the power of the Holy Ghost amen so come byy me character that's been tried how do you get that character through the holy spirit amen the Holy Spirit now before I go into my thought let's see let's pick up a little bit of the Old Testament talking about David how many knows David was you talk about the power of God right David the Israelites they were all pinned down had Goliath coming out every little while and mocking us right come on over come on Amen Let me and him fight let's not get all these other guys killed just me and him and if I win y'all serve us if he wins we'll serve you a that right amen David full of the power of almighty God ain't that right another time when they were down in a tight Place said God come on the scene he got in a ruddy little fell how many how many wants to meet David I'm gonna meet David I want to shake his hand but Brad I don't know if he'll be this high or as tall as me I don't know really what little it was or just how big he was but he was a Rudy little fellow how many knows Moses the Israelites are short people so he's probably like this he's probably short but your size ain't got nothing to do with it it's how much a God that you got in your heart oh I like that I don't care how inferior you feel insignificant you feel just get God in your heart and lot the side of that inferiorities so better go by the wayside why because you got God and you ain't got to fear nothing amen I want to shake his hand Fearless but yet how many knows that he still had a character flaw Beth Sheba and all the problems that come his way ain't that right so what we need brothers and sisters we we need power Amen to become the sons of God Amen it takes a lot of power it might take a lot of power am me to bring a giant down or to slay all them Philistines or to kill a bear or a lion but I'm here to tell you there's something that's more and that's bigger and that's that old carnal nature of ourselves that's our own ways hello and we want to slay Giants we want to cast a bunch of devils out and we can't even control ourselves we can't even treat our wife right or husband right we can't be obedient to our husband we can't love our wife right we can't even overcome our ownselves come on folks I think it's time we start with the little stuff the little things in life we ain't got time to redeem the time say no I ain't got time to go to church I ain't got time to pray how weak are you come on grow a muscle on you this an age of mck brother BR say this is nothing but a bunch of muck and jelly back boneless spineless horrible muck that we're living in man has become nothing but a muck but in the age of muck and Mar God's going to have somebody with backbone he's going to have somebody with strength and power and musles Faith manhood and Womanhood amen I think he better start behind the pulpit don't you think I think it starts with Brother Brad a that right I think we to go back into the promised land we're the spies that go over and we get a bunch of this fruit we get in that wine cellar so to speak and we get all Juiced up come out here and say wo where's that devil at bring them great big grapes from had Promised Land oh man I'm here to tell you Christ is good if you ain't never tasted him oh taste and see that the Lord is good bring some of that to the people cuz he's good oh he's so good I'm glad to be serving a living God not Buddha Muhammad or any of those other religions they're all fake and false and wrong Jesus Christ is the only real true religion none of the other religions are right only this Bible amen praise the Lord that's right David was great Moses was a great man delivered Israel did all of those things sad part was in the end of it Moses almost had to say like brother brandham said all of these campaigns and all these meetings every he says it's all a failure didn't he say that he did it's all a failure where's it at today if it wasn't what was it that the brothers were texting to Baptists are now taking the vote whether women can become pastors Baptists as far as I know Pentecostals probably already have it right they're further away than the Baptist are who's left you and I are left God's going to have a people that stay with his word that stay virtuous to the word of God help us Lord amen it's a treacherous hour that we're living in but God's going to have somebody I'm so glad of that amen Moses delivered the people he did all of that and as I was saying Moses at the end what was it two out of two million that went in that's why I was saying it was a failure why because them people's nature was never changed they came out under the cloud Paul said they' seen the pillar fire they followed the prophet but Jesus said there everyone dead the only ones that went in were their children that they had isn't that right their children went in and Joshua and Caleb Moses a mighty deliverer but couldn't even go in himself because he didn't have enough power what was that power to control his temper not to strike that rock twice wasn't supposed to do that his temper got in the way his old carnal self got in the way are you reading between the lines how many knows it's our own selves and our own caral ways amen our own character that's still withholding the power of God I wish I could play what I played on my my little voice memo man my my wife listening to it and she was screaming amen hallelujah on my V voice memo I said you know a lot of times people pre they expect the preacher to be perfect to be preaching huh they you expect me to have reach the epitome of perfection amen even the prophet himself had to gradually grow and grow and grow isn't that right he had mistakes and he had to make things right that's right well I'd love to say brother Brad I'm there I'm there at Perfection you'll never see me do any wrong wouldn't that be a disappointing service boy that preacher just lied like a dog I know he ain't never going to make no mistakes yeah I know he's going to make mistakes don't don't try to tell me that amen I on there I said in the same way vice versa why because we're amen adjusting we're got to overlook one another's fault and pray for one another amen I don't put you out just because you have to make a mistake or you do something wrong I pray for you say God help us to lift up the feeble knees let's strengthen one another another we're working towards the perfecting of the F Saint cuz how many knows that's what the Bible wants that's what it says in Ephesians four he gave pastors evangelists and so forth amen for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ we all come to the fullness and stature of the full measure of Christ and that what we're going for that's what I'm shooting for brother the Joe till my character is worthy of God backing up my word amen that's what he's working for God wants us to have more power but I believe he's saying telling us tonight that we got to work on our character make sure that every bit of us is surrendered oh I like to think that I've went through the trials brother Joe and sister hand and all of us a lot of better bad amen the trials the hard things that we have went through I don't ever want to go through that again but I have to ask myself what kind of man am I what kind of woman are you how are you what has it gotten you where has it gotten you oh we don't see it sometime but I'm here to tell you you're a better person than what you was you're a stronger person than what you was I'm a stronger person than what I am I've got more faith in God because of the trials and the things that I went through if not if not be expecting this you expect some more trials to come your way you expect some more tests to come your way woo well I hope these everybody listening out there you still got character that you're not supposed to have if you are a Christian you look for some trials you look for bad happenings to happen to you God's trying to send them your way it's a promise in the Bible think in that strange towers of fiery trials that are to try you as though some strange thing happened to you it's going to happen to you tell you you get your bad character out God is looking for gold he's looking for Godlike character and he's going to have it because that's what he's going to live with oh I told my wife I said when a man is wanting to get married so forth don't you look at Beauty don't you just look at Beauty because Beauty will fade away and a lot of them beautiful women and one if they'll leave you they'll be unfaithful and leave you brokenhearted but you want what's more important to you than anything is character what kind of character did they love the Lord do they love the go to church are they faithful hello cuz it's going to mean a lot to you down the road whether she cooks for you cleans for you loyal to you a real wife amen it's everything to you that character is everything to you look right past I don't care if she's fat ugly I don't care if that boy a man he skinny long smells like a pole cat got big club feet by B said and smells like a skunk if he's got character he's a good candidate amen same way with the girl I don't care if she's ugly is all get on it don't matter if she's got carried a real Son of God Amen will have respect for her why because down the road that's what's going to really mean a lot amen and the same way with Christ he's going to live with you I mean he gonna live with you before he marries you and takes you to himself he's going to see to it that you got the little character that you are like him you're not going to bail like the devil did you're not going to bail and say oh I'm tired of this I'm tired of my marriage I'm tired of this that want something different huh boy your wife ever says that boy you're in trouble that's right vice versa amen oh my why do you think God let us get in this terrible condition huh all these tests all these trials and in the middle of everything in a total freem moral agent folks folks I'm here to tell you tonight I can do whatever I want to do but I thank God that he give me the holy ghost that he makes me want to do what God wants me to do I don't want to do that wrong I want to do what's right I want to be pleasing to God Amen brother just you that song maybe after after the service let me be pleasing to you how many wants to be pleasing to him that's what I want amen that takes real power is to change your nature change your desires change what you like change what you want change the thirst and the appetite of oh my not the flesh but of the spirit it takes the power of God to change your nature you can come to church every day of your life but if you're not nature doesn't get changed amen you'll be the same sinner you always was until you live for the Lord 247 and you want to be pleasing to him and you don't how was it that I thought about this that's what it was the Lord wants to have you in his hand is that right because if he gets you in his hand there's no telling what he can do but AB said he can get 10,000 Devils running as hard as they can if he'll get one man in his hand that's what he's trying to do get us more in his hand but we get in his hand we Shout wo Hallelujah we have a church service and everything else but come out there on the job or this that or the other all of a sudden we're like a little frog jump out of his hand and boy I hate that guy huh now I'm gonna cheat on this little business deal here I'm gonna lie and cheat about this that or the other jump right out of his hand hello get backslid how many knows it's easy to get backslid I this this is what I got wrote down I love sans's testimony amen when he amen when he was in the hands of God isn't that right slew a thousand Philistines Heap upon Heap jumped up on the last Heap he says is there any more come on anybody else want to come on over here W but he was still weak and had given his strength to God but his heart to Delila he had a character flaw he backs slid and before you know it he was grinding at the Mill that's what black slid this is you're grinding at the Mill oh I feel so defeated I can't believe I did that I feel so terrible grinding at the Mill life such a drag I don't think I'll go to church tonight isn't that what the devil whispered in their ears don't go to church tonight I don't believe I'll go to church tonight I just feel too condemned you're not worthy I'm just not worthy quit listening to the devil get up off your chair or get down on your knees and say God forgive me of my backsliding amen and fill me again with the power because when the weakest Christian gets on his knees the devil goes to don't do that don't do that cuz I know he'll forgive you but just get on your days and get right amen get back up but that's the part we don't want Lord help us we don't want to go there let's stay up there where Samson is stay in the hand of God Amen praise the Lord amen you love him the old beaters of gold you know how they used to know it was real good gold they would take that gold and would beat it and beat it and turn and beat it till they beat the draw right out of it are y'all looking at me are you looking at me are you looking at me then I'm here to tell you you see a living witness and a testimony of that right there I can tell you the Lord beaten me and he beat me and he beat me and he beat me again and I was like how long how long how long how long till the end of this Valley that was my favorite song cuz my Valley was long and hard he kept beating me kept beating me but you're hearing a little bit of gold it produces gold a't that right that's right I didn't even kill anybody folks I'm here to tell you if I'd have been carnal I'd have killed somebody a that right brother Brad you'd have killed somebody probably we'd all probably killed somebody already if you'd have really went in your flesh that's that's right but praise be to God you allowed that beating and what does it do that beating it beats out the pyite it gets all the sludge out gets all of the dirt out amen gets all yourself out oh we got to say that aloud because we really need that beat it and turn it and beat it till they beat all the drop out of it and you know how they could tell that they got all will draw out it when they could see their own reflection in it then they know that all the pyite and stuff was out of it all the rock and the minerals was on it was pure gold when the beater could see his reflection that's the way Christ is doing to his church he's beating it and turning it and beating it turning it beating it how there a preacher be a enough not to tell the word of God and tell men and women when they're living wrong tell them it's wrong to wear these immoral clothes it's wrong to smoke cigarettes it's wrong to stay home from church it's wrong to go to gambling and racing and carrying on the way the church is doing today playing lotteries and things God forbid that I would do that no sir beat that thing just Beat It by the Holy Ghost until Christ sees his own reflection how going to say God I have all I hope I tray I pray God that my reflection is coming out of me cuz I don't really care for the beating how many's with me Lord just let me reflect you just let me reflect you I don't want to be beat anymore I don't want to be stubborn I don't want no pirate I don't want no self in here amen because if it isn't reflecting the way he wants it yet like I said earlier heads up it's coming your way trials tests amen the trial of your faith the test of your faith being much more precious than natural gold that perishes it's more precious because that's what Christ is coming for in the Rapture he's coming for people that have character to have humility to have love one for another to have gentleness to have meekness to have longsuffering one for another if any have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you forgive them also not holding any bitterness against anybody that's character not holding bitterness or grudges hello all of that is pyate all of that is muck and M is that right unforgiveness meekness Pride he ain't going to tell me that he ain't going to do me that way huh Paul I mean Peter I believe says he says you know after you have suffered a while make you perfect establish and strengthen you how many knows that we might be strengthened with all might oh I don't know about you but that's what I desire that's right that's right listen to what he says all the other thing till he sees his own reflection amen the pressure of the hammer amen listen Under Pressure get him all riled get a person all riled up stirred up you'll see the real man come out if he's got temper it'll show itself if he's got Meek if he's Meek and gentle it'll show himself put him under pressure once God puts all his children under test to see whether they have any flaws in them brother bam says man the churches were full a't that right here in the great during the Depression it was easy to find people at the prayer meeting but now they can work in defense plants and Union gives them so much money they can't hardly know what to do with it and you have to almost persuade them to a meeting people don't want no preaching no more they don't want they want somebody to come up and act like a crown amen come up and do a couple flips or this that or the other Amen brother my B were telling me about a man that goes to Alaska and does all of these crazy things and and he's got gets millions and millions of views we're lucky to get 60 or 50 or 30 or seven people don't want to look at this stuff they'd rather watch somebody get close to a bear and almost get mul or climb icebergs or catch fish or you know grab Gators or something you know folks how many knows I don't want to be like that I don't want have to be put under pressure you ain't got to put me under pressure to praise God and to call God on the scene I don't want to have to get the desperation as the prophet of God said before I call God on the scene how many's with me you ain't got to put me do you ain't got to squeeze me through this pipe amen I ain't no dumb driven cow be not dumb driven cattle be not as dumb driven cattle be a hero in The Strife [Applause] amen people got it too nice amen they got it so nice they don't care about church anymore they don't care about God anymore when there's war this place would probably fill up hello people come everywhere I'm finding for God looking for God what does it take a atomic bomb to get you to move amen praise the Lord I love the turtle story don't you oh my I'm just going to tell you what comes to mind maybe you're the quietest person in church maybe you never have a hallelujah or amen you don't really know what the preacher is talking about but maybe you get cancer maybe you're in a car wreck almost dead maybe this sat or the other or something that God comes and does something for you ain't that right when you come to church you say I want to thank God that he spared me I want to thank God that he delivered me W I'm glad that is there's a God that cares about me Amen brother B talked about the turtle he tried to drown that Turtle to get him to move a't that right beat him with a stick couldn't get him to move but what did he do he said set a fire under him set him on a fire woo I totally got to running that's right you get all starchy amen and all cold on God Amen get in your prayer closet amen and get a little fire burning up under you you'll get to moving I got to go to church tonight this is Wednesday night I'm going to church y'all do whatever you want to do I'm heading there amen ain't nothing better in the world to do by the way by by by by by the way there ain't nothing better to do than to go to church I love going to church amen praise the Lord amen I could say something that sting but I feel checked just to hold it that right if I wouldn't have been checked I'd have said it amen but you got to follow the leading of the spirit even Paul didn't rebuke a spirit until way down the road ain't that right time in a season for everything you love him all right listen to this oh my now notice there's something here Amen brother Braham says if there's anything that makes a Christian lazy it's when they're known a flowery bit of ease amen we don't have persecution enough we don't have it hard enough always the chain is the strongest at its weakest link amen let me say it again I don't want persecution I don't want do things but what I'm saying is I don't want to have to go through do things to cause me to get closer to God Amen because I believe if you're where you ought to be with God God knows just how much to put on you and how much not to amen I thank God that I don't go through the trials I'm not going through the trials on a a minute scale that's what I did I'm thankful for that amen I imagine David said you know I got to quit that stuff I don't never want no more Beth sheas no more Beth sheas for me my goodness I was dethroned people rape my wives on top of the mountains on top of the the houses and everything anything else God let all that happen because of what I did Absalon killed is that right man you talk about it don't pay to backslide on God it don't pay to get away from God Amen here here we go amen what what was it I want to be like amen we want to be here is almost lost my thought Joshua this is how we want to be Joshua a type of the Holy Ghost a person being born again ain't that right going over Jordan amen dying to self the old death to self now you're filled with the Holy Ghost now you're in the promised land but that don't mean you're without battles you still have wars you still have battles don't you ever think you're not going to have battles and Wars amen but what was it Joshua was so surrendered to God so in the hands of God that God told him just to go marching around Jericho blow your trumpets and sing amen you shout you sing you praise God and I'll destroy all your enemies God did the fighting didn't he God fought his battles that's where you and I want to be God fighting every battle that comes your way way never losing a man never having to have a Band-Aid no stitches no scratch not one man dead woo that's the kind of battles we want to fight that's where we want to be and we don't want to be where aen is is that right Ain in that Battle of Jericho went in there and got some gold wedge and so forth I thought it was a bunch of gold I thought it was a bunch sister Hannah way figured out how much it was and it wasn't worth all that much isn't that right if I remember it wasn't even all that much amen why in the world would you have sacrificed your whole family and everything else for something like that and then what he was at the grinding mill like Samson they went over to e AI fight the children of AI I believe it was they didn't even take very many men but they lost 36 men they were defeated they had the same Retreat brother Glenn we never want to have the same Retreat from the Devil he's got the B of us amen we want to be able to say keep marching forward we got him on the run now let's keep them moving come on evening like Tabernacle we got depression we got despair we've got amen cancer we've got all those things on the Run let's keep them going get him on out of here amen 36 men left their lives my my and if I this just comes I don't have this really wrote down but but says because one man got out of his place one man got out of order that's why it's so important to preach keeping the order of the spirit amen why do you think brother I'll tell you what right now I'll preach against gossip more than anybody else I'll preach against them things and and discontent and people griping and stuff I'll preach against it hard because I know what happens I know what that stuff Brews it Brews horrible horrible things carnality in a church is absolute poison in the body it's cancer you don't want it amen Lord help us well it's just too hot or it's just too cold the preacher he just he just screams too much it bothers me if it wasn't that you'd say he's just kind of dead and dried up what's wrong with him huh be one thing or the other and I'll tell you what like brother bam says nine times out of 10 it's the one that's causing to stir ain't right I'll say Amen tell them brother BR that's exactly right that's a pastor I know it's the one that's discontent the one causing the stir ain't right why because we should always strive for the unity of the spirit Unity of the faith amen well anyway I don't know who needed that but maybe I did somebody did because I certainly didn't have it in here all right praise the Lord you love him in closing y all remember the story of Sydney and the bridge that they built across the Great Waters over there and how did they said no Bridge could be built because of the sand and everything and the one that did buil that he went in there and he went plumbed down way way way down and he got some Solid Rock to go on and and he tested every bolt he tested every piece of Steel he tested it tested and tested let me say this he tested every nut and I'm here to tell you that God's going to test every one of us nuts that's why he's going to make sure that when we're threaded on to Christ we have never let go no trials are going to let us go no tribulation going to let us go no troubles no riches no cares of lukewarmness will never get us to let go any of these things in this world never going to let go he's going to test every one of us because when we're sitting by his side we're going to sit there tested and tried to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne amen even as I overcame and sat in h Throne aren't you happy today that you can receive a spirit on the inside of you according as he has given us of his divine nature the uh Peter said isn't that right having escape the corruption that is in the world Amen through the precious Promises of God when that Holy Ghost comes in there it gives you power over your flesh it changes your nature will that nature try to raise up and resurrect it sure will till the day you die why do you think you got to eat three times a day why do you think Daniel Prayed three times today why do you think you got to pray why do you think you're supposed to read your Bible amen and the only solution to getting closer to God is to read more of your Bible be more dedicated to God how many he's with me that's right amen more of you musicians come if you would please you love the Lord I want to thank every one of you for praying for me how many prays for me keep your hand up keep it up brother Glenn you still got it up right there you go I I love that guy you yeah I pray for you morning and noon and amen praise the Lord appreciate everybody love everybody amen because that's what really does something for this church is prayer amen calls God on the scene how many thinks that the Holy Spirit just may be doing something yeah I think God's doing something I really do I think he's moving yeah go ahead Sunday amen amen God bless you the devil fought David tooth and nail amen he was s close to not going in because they was wanting not to let him in it was after hours and I guess they ask y all do yall want to see this guy you got to visit her no they said who is it it's David oh yeah yeah let him in right I heard the story that's good amen that's the way it's supposed to work brother when that sweeping Angel comes over there and healed you you're ready to go out then amen amen stand with me tonight amen let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me sister be let the beauty of Jesus be seen in and me all his wonderful passion and purey and oh thou Spirit divine all my nature refined till the beauty of Jesus be SE in me amen let's bow our heads tonight let's talk to our author let's go to the one that saw said come buy of me gold that's been tried in the fire come I've got some gold for you that's been tried into fire and tested and true how many would raise your hand and say God I need more of that car Lord of yours if there's no streaming and you know you need more of that character you're still not sold out quite as much as what you should be you're still not in the full character of God and that's why you don't have the power that you do cuz without character power is satanic Lord Jesus you see the hands that are up and they're all saying Lord Jesus I need more of your character father and forgive me where there isn't Lord father I ask God that you'll mold My Heart Lord that you'll take my life every part of it father I don't want you to have to beat me I don't want you to have to keep hammering me and beating me and trying to get all this draw us out I want the draw us out Lord we want the reflection of Christ to be in our hearts and in our lives so that you could be pleased Lord and say that's my son that's my daughter that's how I want them to be even as the prophet claimed one I believe that he had come to full surrenderance to you Lord that's our heart's desire that we come to that place where we're fully in your hands and everything that we do is pleasing to you Lord and you don't have to chastise us you don't have to correct us Lord father because we come to the place that we're supposed to be Lord and I realize father that'll probably be all the way to the end but God God we thank you Lord Jesus for where you have brought us from and how you've changed us Lord we see a berer trait we see all these different families here today that we have family traits family characteristics Family character and God you don't want no family character you want your character in each and every one of us Lord take out the old bad habits the old character different things God that is unlik like you tonight that perhaps we have carried over father from our lineage of our families Lord Jesus and I know even berer Lord Jesus there's things that are not good Lord that I have to battle Lord and I pray take that all away May that to be the heart's desire of each one Lord father we only are interested in one thing and that is to reflect Jesus Christ we ask this in Jesus name amen and amen God bless [Music] you brother [Music] Joshua no Lord unto you pleasing let me be be pleasing to you let everything that I do be [Music] pleasing to you
