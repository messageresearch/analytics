[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] good morning how y'all doing today y'all come to get ready to get fed I was on the way here and I was just thinking about you know the message of ours Jesus Christ you know and it said Jesus is that man that came down from heaven and I was thinking about you know brother Brad brother Tom all these ministers you know break the the Mana from Heaven the 1100 tapes yall break that bread you know we can't go back and listen to every one of y'all sermons but like Jesus did he breaks that bread gives us fresh Mana every day off tapes you know now because I was like I was just thinking about that this morning man you know it's so powerful but uh if y uh John 6 then Jesus said unto them barely verely I say unto you Moses gave you not the bread from heaven but the father giveth the true bread from Heaven oh 30 32 sorry what you say 6322 sorry for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world and Jesus said unto him I am the bread of life he that hunger to cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will no wise cast out and this is the Father's will which hath sent me and that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again in the last day and the Jews and they murmured at him because he said I am the bread which came down from heaven and Jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life your fathers did eat man and the Wilderness and our dead this this one together I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give to my flesh which I give the life of the world brother B may be seated no he he told you wrong but you can stand this morning if you want to we're going to ask the musicians to come amen we used to play that musical

to have brother Russell here this morning and love brother Russell very much uh just glad the Lord let Austin have Serenity so I get to see my buddy again it been a lot of years come ahead this morning brother Russell amen God bless you my friend good morning Saints God bless you Brother David asks me to sing every time I'm here and so today I said we worked late last night I said I thought about singing but I have a testimony so he gave me the opportunity to give you a testimony first of all I'm sorry to be so casual Brothers my dad didn't even let me wear jeans to school so this is really stretching it for me but but uh I came out on one of those $69 Frontier flights and but if you want to bring a sapcase it's another $69 right so I put everything in a backpack so was just my work clothes so happy to see the tidwells haven't seen them for hope the kids still remember us we were they're our dear old friends and and I'm apologize ahead of time that I won't be here for service tonight my Ox is in the ditch and I didn't push him in the ditch to get him out on Sunday he's he fell in on his own and definitely have to work to to today till late uh because we fly out tomorrow trying to finish the electrical at Austin and Serenity's house so for the testimony I'd like to it could be a prayer request I'm in big trouble on my left knee here but really it is a testimony because in 1998 uh I was for mold injuries as a child I ended up uh blowing my knee out in 1998 I was on crutches for 6 weeks and then I ended up going in for knee surgery and serenity was 6 months old I had three boys so I had three boys Serenity was a little baby and uh when I went in for surgery when I came out of the surgery the doctor said that there was a lot of damaged cartilage and torn damaged and it doesn't apparently apparently won't repair so they cut it out so he said you're only going to get 10 years out of that knee so that was 1998 so just in the last few months I've had trouble with this knee it's been 25 years so I'm it's really a testimony I got 2 5 years out of a 10year KNE so I'm very thankful for that but I remember at that time it was an answer to prayer because there in 1998 when he said you're going to have 10 years and I wanted to hunt with my boys and I wanted to play sports with them and I know there's dads that can't but man I just besought the Lord Lord please let me be active with my with my boys and the Lord answered that prayer and it's kind of interesting to me because now 25 years later the kids are all grown and now my knees starting to to flare up again but it is testimon I got 25 years out of this 10 year near knee that the doctor told me so I'm very thankful so that's but really I realized I should be praying now Lord I got grandchildren that I'd like to play with and I'd like to go hunting with and and ask the Lord to answer that prayer but but I'm thankful for God's goodness amen [Applause] amen amen amen God's been good to us hasn't he amen amen let's stand and sing that little chorus we're gonna cut our part pretty short brother Michael's gonna sing for us here in just a few minutes and and uh I just I just

seat just thank each one of you um and I'm just so glad to be servant of God that is merciful graceful year after year time after time he never he never stops showing his faithfulness amen if you have your Bibles first of all I I I do want to say I'm thankful to be here this morning and just count in an honor brother Bor I was talking with someone the other day and um he asked me where was I preaching somewhere this weekend I told him I was preaching at brother bers and he kind of laughed and he said the last time he saw you he's my age he's 46 or seven or eight uh he said it was in Virginia and y'all were playing football and he just remembers you were tackling everybody and 30s but um you still like look like you could do a few tackles still look like you got a few tackles in you amen I thought that was funny amen time just flies does it but you know when we're serving the lord it doesn't matter we just time flies and when it's our time to go home we go home but until we go home we're just going to enjoy this gift called life amen and just enjoy what he's given us amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to the book of Lamentations and we'll read the fifth chapter and we'll read a few verses we we'll read verse one through three and then we'll pray and you can be seated to to set the stage here the book of Lamentations is uh basically what had happened is Judah and Israel had split and Judah had Judah had fallen into ult idolatry and they had been overtaken by Babylon and the Book of Lamentations is said to be written by the Prophet Jeremiah and Jeremiah is considered the weeping prophet and if you ever read the book of re Lamentations you can understand why he was considered the weeping prophet because it just burdened him it brought such a sorrow so such a grief to see what had happened to Judah they had fallen into idolatry and once they fallen into idolatry they were overtaken by Babylon and the same pattern follows today when we F when we fall into idolatry when we fall into coldness sin creeps into our life When sin creeps into our life we even get colder it's a it's a cycle and this is the cycle that Judah was on and but I we want to read these verses and put that in context that this is just not some some language or some poems that the Prophet Jeremiah wrote but there was something that caused his heart to be so sorrowful that he's crying out to God one more time amen verse one remember oh Lord what has come upon us uh I'm sorry chapter 5 verse one of Lamentations remember oh Lord what has come upon us consider and behold our reproach our inheritance is turned to strangers our houses to aliens we are orphans and fatherless our mothers are as widows let's pray dear heavenly father we just thank you for another Sunday to come together we just thank you for the church here Lord and each one that has a burden to see others come closer to God that's what our desire this morning Lord that we'll leave closer to you may you just be with each one here and the different situations that arise in their life and we love you amen you may be seated I want to continue reading verse five our necks are under persecution we labor and have no rest verse seven our fathers have sinned and are not and we are Bor we have borne their iniquities I want to stop there because there's a good lesson to learn here sin is never isolated here uh the Prophet Jeremiah is saying we our have sinned not us but our fathers have sinned and we're having to Bear their iniquities and and that continues on especially fathers mothers we want to recognize that realize that the the the decisions we make could affect P future Generations that's why it's so good to bring our children to church and and create these habits these Godly habits that excuse me servants have ruled over us there is none that does Deliver us out of their hand verse 10 our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine they ravished the women in Zion and the maids in the cities of Judah verse 15 the joy of our heart is ceased our dance is turned mourning the crown is fallen from our head woe unto us that we have sinned verse 20 wherefore does thou forget us forever and forsake us so long time 21 turn thou un us turn thou us unto thee yes I like how how Prophet Jeremiah said that it didn't he didn't say God come unto us but he said God I recognize the situation here I recognize the problem here it's not you God it's us so turn us back to you turn us back to you and you know sometimes in our life we need to be turned back to the North Star we need to be turned back to our father we need to be turned back to the truth because we all go through seasons of being cold and Jeremiah says here turn thou us unto thee Oh Lord and we shall be turned isn't it wonderful when God does the work nothing can stop it you say well I don't know if my family will ever serve God my children my parents if God does the work no one can stop it you don't worry about it don't have sleepless nights just put it in the hands of God because if God turns them to him no one can stop it no devil in hell can stop it amen but this is the part I want to focus on renew our days as of old renew our days as of old you know when we look at the words that we just read the word persecution came up uh the word mourning came up the word Joy had ceased they people are ruling over us this is how Jeremiah describes their situation but at the end this is what we want to speak on this morning renew our days as of old beginning of 2024 this is our first Sunday in 2024 let's not look back to yesterday as the good old days let's not try to recreate something we had let's just move forward and say God renew my energy renew my Zeal renew my passion renew my love for you as it was in days of old amen amen you know if you ever seen have you ever seen a bird that is missing a few feathers that looks kind of odd all right you know I used to have a parakeet when I was a kid man that bird was messy but uh that's beside the point but he was messy but anyway you know they they start they start getting to a point birds do where they can't fly as high they can't go as far it's a struggle for them to even fly a short distance so almost every year what a bird goes through is called a molting process and during this molting process they slowly not quickly but they slowly and intentionally pluck out the feathers that are damaged and then what happens is New Growth begin new feathers begin to grow and once those new feathers have grow have came to maturity flying is no longer a struggle they can go further than they could two months prior they can go higher than they could two months prior but what it took was a process called a molting process yeah and brothers and sisters we all go through seasons of life where we grow cold and what we need is to go through a great molting process time s in our life when we get so cold and we get so filled with anxiety and we become anxious what we need is just a slow down and let God begin to pluck up out the feathers amen we get so cold we're we're we can't fly as high as we could be we're not as Victorious as we should be amen we're not as joyful as we would be if we just allowed God to do the pucking allow God to take out those feathers that are keeping us Earthbound and allow New Growth to come into our life renew our days as of old Jeremiah the prophet cried out yeah amen and may that be our cry 2024 God renew my strength like as of the days of old renew my energy renew my joy renew my happiness amen life don't need to be a struggle brothers and sisters we need to quit talking about I just can't wait to leave God gave us this gift called life and until he's ready to call us home let's enjoy the ride amen amen CU when we start talking like that all the time I'm barely making it I don't know how I'm gonna get through another day but if you change how you look at things this is a wonderful gift from God he saw fit for me to be here in 2024 so why would I complain he he's he put me here so I might as well just enjoy it amen amen the prophet Isaiah said in Isaiah 429 he give giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength yeah he does not me we're not strong within ourself we're not going to R any Devils by ourselves I don't care what people say we're not going to do it the Bible says flee from them the Bible says don't have anything to do with them you're not strong within yourself to to to beat any devil but the strength comes from God the strength comes from his promises the strength comes from him amen even the youth shall think and be weary so now it's speaking of the the the epitome of humanity the young it says even they will faint they will grow weary the young men shall utterly fail so even the epitome of humanity will fall naturally it only goes so far even the epitome of who we would consider great Giants will fall all right will fall without God right without God I don't place a lot of confidence in humanity I place my confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ he's never failed me he's never grown weak he's never lost his strength he's never lost a battle he's never been intimidated he's never lost confidence in his ability he's never lost confidence in what he promised thousands and thousands and millions millions of years ago before the foundation of the world he made the promise and he will keep it even if time stands to 2029 2042 2077 God is still on the strong Throne this morning amen don't you love him but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength amen they shall Mount up with wings see there's a component here God God they shall run and not be weary even the young shall faint but they that wait they that wait David said in Psalm 51-12 restore unto me the joy of thy salvation he didn't say my salvation he said thy salvation it's all about God and uphold me with thy free spirit Samson cried in judges the 16th chapter and Samson Cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord remember me yeah I pray thee and you strengthen me I pray thee only this once oh God yeah Samson cried remember me you strengthen Me Prophet Jeremiah said renew me as of my days of old bring back God the things I used to hold so tight to me you that I felt was so precious But as time moves on we have this tendency to let go of those things that once kept us kept us brother Brandon said this he said I dedicate my life to him over his pull pit over his pull pit that one great desire in my life is to be more humble before God and before his people knowing that that's one of my major mistakes is having to deal with the public in such a way now notice what he says it took a lot out of me that used to be there it's taken a lot out of me he's praying he said his most major mistake was he was not humble he said I trust that God will restore again that Joy I once had all right not as I lost my joy but I mean I want more of it more humility to serve the Lord amen Jeremiah Isaiah sson David brother Brenham they they all cried the same theme and that is renew my days as of old when Samson with was in the Hall of gagon he knew what it was to be strong at one time but he had disconnected himself from God so he standing there and his mind begins to go back to those times when he had strength when he could fight the Lions when he could fight the Giants when he could slay many men at one time and he's standing there like a puppet and his mind begins to go back to what he once had yeah and he said God renew my strength as I once had renew me as of days of old yeah yeah thank you Lord Isaiah said the same thing David said the same thing all great men and women of God when they grew cold they went back to what they had yeah they went back to what had made them strong they went back to the absolute they went back to the anchor and this morning brothers and sisters if you're feeling cold on God if you feel like you've gotten to a season don't allow 2024 to be that way say God renew me as of days of old I admit I know I've grown cold on God I see it all over my life but God I'm just praying this morning my heart is crying out to you renew me as of days of old let me pick up this book and look at it with Wonder yeah oh let me listen to a sermon and just wonder and say God what are you feeding me this morning instead of oh I've heard this for 20 something years that's right it's not going to change me it won't change you with that attitude nobody can touch me I'm not changing well if you don't want to change brothers and sisters you're going to be left on the side cuz God is a transforming God which means somebody's got to change and it's not going to be God that's going to do the changing so somebody in that party's got to change so it might as well just be us amen amen has anybody ever heard of toys or us yeah when I was a kid it was a big toy store they had one in one out we didn't get to go well we got to go there some but we never got to buy anything there but we got to look uh it's so expensive but I guess that was part of the fun is just looking at what everybody else could buy but but anyway Toys are Us was considered one of the biggest companies in the 80s and 90s and their Heyday they had 1,600 stores 100,000 employees and 2000 and they signed a contract with Amazon to be their exclusive toy producer or or a toy the one that would everyone would buy toys from would be toys or us well of course as Amazon does they didn't really make good on that and they breached their contract and it ended up in court for many many years Toys R Us was suing Amazon for not doing their part of the contract but what happened in that lawsuit they lost Millions and millions of dollars fighting Amazon that these smaller companies came in and they begin to take a market share online but see Toys R Us was so fixated on taking Amazon down that they didn't realize they were going bankrupt doing it where am I going with that sometimes we get our eyes fixated on the wrong thing yeah we get our eyes on what this person's doing that church is doing or that person or that whatever more and we become so fixated that it becomes a distraction and that distraction keeps our eyes upon this person and then we don't see oursel growing cold we see everybody else growing cold but we don't see our s growing cold and we become the very thing that at one time we fought against and that is why happened to toys our us they closed their last store in 2018 because they went bankrupt because they became so stubborn that they were going to fight Amazon instead of putting that millions of dollars and creating an e-commerce website creating online presence and forgetting about Amazon they became fixated on their enemy that they were going to do whatever it took to win the lawsuit brothers and sisters some things are not worth fighting we need to pick our battles because some battles are going to wear you down down down and you're going to look back and I'm going to look back up my life and thought was that really worth it right that's right and see in life if we want to keep oursel warm and tenderhearted towards God we've got to realize some things are not worth fighting and some things are not so worth becoming fixated on yeah becoming hyperfocused on that we get our eyes off of this person this is the person I I mean I want all of us to make heaven but I sure want this boy to make heaven I want to walk the street I want to walk the streets of goat I mean I hope every one of us and I pray and I trust and I believe we're all going to be there but there's only one person I can change this morning that's me by God's help and God's grace so what happens is Satan gets us fixated on something it's like a little sore we begin to pick pick pick and it becomes bigger and bigger and bigger and then we look back on time and realize we have wasted so many years fighting the wrong battle when we could have spent that energy and that time on growing closer to God cu the closer we come to God as brother brandham said The more we start feeling sorry for our enemies the more we start feeling sorry for people that are not living right we're not going to change the world but let's just be Godly people so the people around us see something real and then they want to change they want to change let's be that light in our community amen I know it's simple but that's just kind of where I I live uh but you know if if Toys R Us had just went back to the basics they started in 1948 or 46 because they saw a need in the market for toy stores but by the 80s or 90s they were not willing to back up and go back to what made them what they were same thing with Kodak same thing with many other companies they got so fixated on on a one thing that they didn't realize the whole Market was changing like today you got these stores the Lego stores that create like an experience toy toys or us had the money to do those things but they got ran over by smaller companies because of their lack of having their eyes on the right thing you know sometimes to be renewed we got to go back to the foundation yeah you can perform you know I've learned as a song leader and as a minister you can perform the Motions right you can get through a service and you can go year after year like that you can do it as a late member you come to church you Clap the right time you amen but we don't we're not called to be robots yeah we're not called just here just to just to have a great service and everybody leaves empty but emotionally it was a 10 right but then everybody leaves feeling discouraged and still empty in their life and feel so cold from God I don't want you to leave that this service like that I'd rather shoot like a a shotgun where everything goes so many different ways and people leave and say God was here this morning I don't know exactly what he said but I I knew something changed in my life I've left challenge that God I want you to renew my days as of old yeah right you know one thing in life you know like look at brother Brandon when he was so transparent about he had he said I I've lost humility he said that was my major mistake he red he said I want to rededicate my life do you want to rededicate your life this morning I want to rededicate my life I want 2024 I I want it to be real and genuine with God Amen I want to look at the future with hope because my god holds it Amen brother Brandon did not have to share the expose this weakness in his life or that he was even rededicating his life he had preached enough sermon that when God came on the scene it didn't matter how he felt yes but as a human being like we all we want we want a true relationship with God yeah yeah not just word service not just good singing not all that but I want to know when I go to work tomorrow I feel God Amen he brother Brandon when he rededicated his life he was still preaching he was still traveling but he re recognized something in his life was a Miss yes he was doing the Motions but his heart totally wasn't in it so we want to separate it it's not about always doing the emotions but where is our heart today is our heart warmth by the word of God yeah are we overly critical or we feel like nothing is going right in our life we all have the Seasons but we want to recognize it and say God renew my days as of old you know one thing I don't like doing is turning around when I'm driving I hate turning around oh it's I'd rather go out of the way than turn around and that's what happened when we were in Canada a few years ago I was preaching in Canada we left we you know I told everybody after church we got to get on the road we're trying to get so far tonight and I took a wrong turn you know I I left now I was trying to make everything quick so we could get home in a decent time and I took a wrong turn and uh I believe my helpmate noticed it she tends to notice those things first in in our car so I won't where's she at maybe she's in the bathroom so I can keep talking it's always kind of a running joke cuz when she don't travel with me as much she used to so I I get a little bit more Liberty when she's not with us but this morning she's she's with us somewhere there she is yes yes how you doing this morning but she she noticed that we were we were on the wrong road but I was determined that we were not turning around so it took us extra three or four hours because I did not want to turn around because I hate turning around and I even can spin it in a positive way well at least we get to try a new way to go home I mean we're getting to see new things that we would never seen and then I can even spiritualize it well it must just been God's will you know you can spiritualize about anything right that's right but it end up costing us about three or four hours because I would not turn around and you know in life a lot of times there's warning signs yes and we just need to do a u-turn yeah and just mid up to it say God I'm cold cuz I've got on the wrong road yeah I'm cold because I've allowed things in my life or my home that are not pleasing to you I'm cold because every time the church doors are open I have an excuse for not going I'm cold because I've became critical of everybody in the church or everybody around me nobody does anything right and all these things begin to drip coldness into to our life amen instead sometimes we just need a mitt up God I'm cold I got to do a U-turn because I want you to renew me as of my days of old as my days of old because what keeps us a lot of times from turning around is is pride Proverbs 29:23 man's Pride shall bring him lowow a man's Pride shall bring him low pride is a destroyer it destroys countries it destroys families destroys churches businesses individuals it's a little felter word called Pride because it's often the block that keeps us from going back have you ever been in a discussion with your spouse and you know they're right but you keep digging a hole again I'm going to use that word spiritualize justify and you keep digging a hole because that little five letter word called Pride you just don't want to admit or I don't want to admit they're right that felter word keeps us from our Keeps Us cold keeps us from being renewed from God yeah God is willing God the Bible says is longsuffering he's willing but this felter word keeps us from from um from going back and saying God I just need help I am in a a situation that I got myself into nobody else did but I did and I need your grace and mercy to help me do a U-turn and get back on track that's right have you ever stood against something or fought so hard against something or for something all right but you know in your heart you're only stand Standing for or against it because of tradition you know down deep that you're and you got your scriptures you got your quotes but you know down deep that this is just a personal conviction nothing more you know the longer you live and quite a few of us can testify you realize that a lot of things we hope hold so dear to is nothing more than just personal convictions right it is read questions and answers and how many times brother brandham said I don't know he would say I don't know because he said I can't support it with this what a humility I I mean he could have spend something he could have made an answer up and everybody would have went with it I I I started counting it one time because I was just amazed how sometimes as a minister you feel like you got to know the answers but it's okay I don't know I don't know he said that quite frequently in questions and answers when there was a lot of questions asked he'd even sometimes say well this is what my opinion but I just don't know right so these things that that we hold so so so dear grow and we this what this is what happens we begin to stand up for him we begin to spend all our passion our energy our joy for fighting for something that if we just sit there and thought about it and prayed about it realize this is just my personal conviction and then focus our time our energy and our strength and everything else about Lord I just want to be right with you I just want to be right with you if there's something in my life that's is wrong you take it out somebody don't need to fight me about it somebody don't have to get angry but God you send people in there that really love me that that really want to see me change and help me to have a heart that is open to change so you can renew my strength as of days of [Applause] old oh those days of old when our hearts were so tender and if we found out something wasn't pleasing to God we just got rid of it yeah those days of old where there was a joy and there was a Zeal and there was an excitement for serving God those days of old where we thought God could come back at any time yeah see the Prophet Jeremiah realized Judah got off track because they got their eyes off that Simplicity of God just serving God day by day just Monday when you're at work you're serving God when things go wrong and you lose your temper you apologize and you go on sering in God when things don't go the way you thought they would go in your life you still just serve God when you don't understand what you're going through you still just serve God you cry out like Jeremiah renew my days as of old God I don't understand everything I go through God I don't even like everything I go through but I'm just putting my confidence in your word amen oh God help me we bring a lot of junk into our relationship with God we bring a lot of our past into our walk with the Lord we bring a lot of our tradition in our walk with the Lord and we become fixated on those things instead of coming fixated upon just the word of God and say God in a tender heart and humility change me oh God will you see I need changed yeah you know Jeremiah could have said I am a prophet I've already warned Judah but in humility he did not say renew their days of old he said renew our days as of old he put himself in there he put himself in there and that's what a Believer does they put their self where the battle is if another brother or sister's down they put theirself with them they don't care how it looks to other people or what people will say no they are there because they they want to see everyone have a walk with the Lord and I understand sometimes we have to cut ties for different reason I'm not saying that but I'm saying if our motive for not helping someone because we're afraid someone GNA think we look bad or weird that's a very shallow motive very shallow you know the other night um we were talking about some of our kids that all teenagers now but we were talking about when they had imaginary friends it's quite an interesting conversation uh I won't name any names but one of our kids I'll say they I won't say he or she but I'll say they they had an imaginary friend that actually we were flying somewhere that imaginary friend sit on the wing of the plane the whole trip and they saw it I mean it was like real they they saw him on the The Wing of the the the plane and and they watched him take off and everything else and they had this imaginary friend and what but what it got me thinking is how when we were kids we just enjoyed our life but then there's something about adulthood that brings calluses a hardness yeah but then my Jesus said come as little children yeah he said come as little children little children just enjoy their life they put their confidence in their parents none of my kids have ever came up to me said are we going to get to eat tomorrow they just accept the fact that there's going to be food they don't worry and then my Jesus said you know you come to me as a little child he went far to say you can't even make it into the Kingdom of Heaven unless you come as a little child so what is it that a little child has that us adults don't have does any of you little children want to speak up and tell us what you have that we don't have because we need what you got According To Jesus what they have is they just approach life with a wonder they approach life with faith and confidence in their parents' ability yes they don't sit up at night worrying if breakfast will be on the table they know when they come home from a hard day that they got their home to come to yes and all that creates a security in their life and for us we lose that with our walk with the Lord we sit up all night fretting and worried when God said I gave the birds a place to sleep yeah I'm going to take care of you right and we will stay up all night tossing and turning we all do throughout the day it will be the only thing that hits our mind some huge problem we're going through when God said I'll never leave you or forsake you yeah that's what our father said so we need if we want to renew our days of old we need to come back to that childlike faith I'm just going to accept you God for who you are and what you said I'm going to quit trying to figure everything out and just accept my kids have never sat down while we did bills and did bills with us now they they might have known times when things are a little bit more tighter but they've never sat down and done the bills with us except the fact that the house payment will be paid if we could just take this book and really apply it to our life when he said come as a little child if this morning we could come as a little child if you need healing just come as a little child it might you might say well what I have is very serious and that that's understandable but still come just as a little child and then let God determine how he's going to work it all out but God I'm just doing my part you said come as a little child just childlike Faith yeah childlike Wonder childlike believing amen I I was thinking of that you know a lot of times as adults we lose that we lose that in life just in life in general we become where we become very cynical very critical very callous I don't want that my life and if it's there I want God to remove it I want to approach 2024 and I challenge you this morning as God this is a gift I can't control what's in Washington but I'm not going to allow it to get my blood pressure up I can't even control what's going on in my little city and sometimes I feel like I can't even control what's going on in my house but God I'm just depending on you God I just want to come as a little child because I know you said the Prophet Jeremiah said renew me as of the days of old I want you to renew me as a child I want you to give me the strength to wake up in the morning and say this is going to be a wonderful day because this is the day that the Lord ha made amen hallelujah I don't care if it's Monday morning that's right don't go to work Monday morning said well it's just another Monday it will be just another Monday saying No this Monday God made God made this Monday and if God made this Monday I don't want to Grumble about it I want to say God just help me renew my days as of old help me to accept you amen amen let's look at humility and then we'll close in a few moments brother bernham said I've leaned heavy on the signpost and them he was talking about discernment he said Lord you show me about this for I pray for them cuz I don't know what I might do basically he's saying he's having a hard time having faith without God showing him what's going to happen he said how cruel that was I asked the congregation to forgive me the congregation of the world that's listening to this tape forgive me I was wrong I should have never carried it out like that that wasn't his Commission in the first place that was a sign pointing to the commission I should have prayed for the sick everywhere what he was saying God just renew me as of my days of old I got a little off track but God take me back take me back now Wonder let's just role play Here For a Moment wonder if he had so much pride he couldn't admit that this is what has happened in his life he would got further and further away from God and brothers and sisters that's when I'm talking about that Pride it it it takes us further away from God instead of just saying Adit admitting it I was wrong I was thinking in my own life a few years ago I was preaching somewhere and I I sit word from the pull pit that I didn't really think was bad but it could be I'm not going to say it cuz now I would feel bad saying it but anyway so I get I I I get a letter from a brother from that church and and he was nice and kind about it he he I could tell what he's getting to because he wrote this long letter and then he finally got to it he I just think you should not have used that word from the pull pit and and I so I called him up and he W he he's such a nice person matter of fact he we still talk from time to time and write letters he's a wonderful brother and he was just so kind and such a humility how he told me that he thought I was wrong so so I apologized and said well you know you might be right but you know I say that to say this that could have easily got off track very easy if we both had allowed Pride to get involved and there are times I've allowed pride and it's gotten off track yeah but this time by God's grace he gave me enough wisdom not to use pride and and I told him I said brother you might be right I apologize I shouldn't have probably said that from the pull pit and and he even apologized for even bringing it up he felt bad we were both apologizing but the thing is see pride can cause those just that little issue just that little issue could have been every time I go to that church I I was dodging him to preach and I don't want that right I don't want that in my life I don't want to go places where I have to dodge people I just want to be friends with everybody that comes my way and by God's grace may he just bless your life yeah but that little thing could have caused you know if Pride had risen and look in your own life we sometimes we fa at that and then we look back and wonder why this relationship or this thing went so off track a lot of times if you look back at something small as we get ready to close brother brandham shares a wonderful story that is a great example a couple's getting a divorce and they're going through the whole house arguing over everything this is mine and she say no it's mine they did that for hours then they got up in the attic and they're fighting over every single thing in the house they just couldn't stand each other they thought they get up in the attic and they come to a little pair of baby shoes and they both grabbed for them and they realized that neither one of them could claim honestly that it was theirs the story behind it it was a baby that they had lost when this little girl was just an infant and at that time they cried they fell into each other's arms and they decide not to get a divorce praise the Lord you know in life brother Brenham said it this way let me f he said he said it like this and and listen to it and then we'll apply it to the story he said look at he's talking about growing cold on God look at what you once were in your heart and mind and in your life think go back to it yeah look at what you were in your heart and mind and your life then go back to it in the Book of Revelations it says the Church of Ephesus that church age John said nevertheless or Jesus said nevertheless I have someone against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love he said remember therefore from whence Thou Are Falling remember and then he says repent and do the first Works remember repent do the first Works remember repent and do the first works when they were in the Attic they remembered they fell in each other's arms and they repented and then they went back to their first love those shoes brought back a memory and that memory made them recognize that they had loud Pride to get between them then they repented and then after they repented they fell in each other's arms and they went back to the first works or how it was before they had allowed Pride to get into their marriage amen think back when you fell in love with God I want to make it real personal this morning A lot of times we use these words and it's okay because there's it's true but it sometimes it takes a a part that we need back into it go deeper than I was just predestinated that is true I'm not I believe in predestination go deeper than I was raised in a home that believed God sent a prophet there's true to that but why because we know that was the beginning but do you remember the moment when you had all kind of things in your life life and your eyes was open to the fact that I'm a sinner I'm a drunk I like drugs I'm not honest in my marriage I'm looking my phone think back to that realization that God Drew you to him and when you begin to remember that when you're cold and you pray to God to take me back to that to that God was rich in Mercy even you young people you say well I never got out but you still need to walk with the Lord you still need to be filled with his spirit because one of the worst things is a religious spirit and it can be so hard to detect cuz as someone that grew up in church grew up believing brother Bron was a prophet and all these things if we don't watch it we don't have that defining moment sometimes and because we didn't come from a bar and stumble in and then God miraculously took alcohol in our life if you don't watch it when you get older you begin to question it so you don't want any of that because Satan likes to work in those things if you can't say God you have done a work in my life because something has been transformed into me you say well what does a religious spirit look like a religious spirit is always going to be usually be cloaked in what does other people think and you begin to live your life to make sure everyone else thinks you're a Christian we want to go deeper than that what does God think yeah what does God think this morning what does God think about when we look when we look on our phone at things right what does God think about whatever you plug it in and then then your life begins to become transformed because it's no longer about so and so's going to think bad about me this person or my parents if they find out they're going to kill me they might but get saved and you'll go to heaven but what does God think I don't care how young this morning start getting into that thought pattern what does God think about me this morning what does God think about when I'm on the playground saying those jokes or different things whatever it is what does God think and by doing that you take all those layers of religious spirit that can come upon us amen we all know as a preacher once told me we all know usually what to do the right thing to do it's just sometimes we fail to do the right thing so this morning as we prepare to close cry out like David like Jeremiah Samson brother Brandon renew my days as of old you know Christ and I getting ready to celebrate 24 years of marriage in a couple months in March we've been through ups and downs highs and lows goods and bads and but you know she's still the one and I I've realized after about 24 years of marriage it gets even tougher because your patience with each other can come really quick or you become very impatient because you know what each other's going to say and all that and sometimes what you need is a reset you get through the mundane of life you're especially in our season where you're raising teenagers and different things you got a lot going on sometimes you just need to get away and reset and then you realize how much you mean to each other but just the mundane of life you can start taking each other for granted and you just need to get away for maybe a day or two or go out to eat Christ I like to go walking or just walk for an hour or two and just reset and then it comes back to why you married him or her and this morning if you've grown cold on God as we close think back think back to those times where you just loved serving God where he was your all in all when you had a decision you prayed about it and you really took in consideration or you had a question you might would ask the pastor or see what maybe brother Brenham said or read what the Bible said about it and and it this book was so precious to you you wouldn't put anything on top of it because it just meant something to you if you're cold this morning think back and then pray God reew my days as of old let's stand let's just pray dearly father we just thank you for this wonderful time together Lord we all go through cold spells in our life and seasons and sometimes Lord we just wonder how we're even going to get up or we just don't feel like it and we become overcritical and we become like well nothing good happens this is a terrible world and we know all that the Bible told us it was going to be like that in the end time but Lord our hope is in you you put us here for a reason so Lord help us change our thoughts in 2024 and Lord if we're cold on you please just renew our days as of old yes take us back to when you meant the world to us yes take us back to when we would sometimes just sit and meditate on how beautiful Heaven's going to be Lord Jesus may you just be with each one in this church you know every situation this morning I pray your tender hand would just be upon each individual every family may this be a banner year for their congregation Lord may they see new people come here people that off the street that see such a light or someone from the work or job or school that just see something in their life and they they want that help us all to be a Shining Light Lord we just love you just thank you for all you do in Jesus name we pray amen amen let's just sing A Chorus or two as we'll just have brother B come here in a moment but let's just sing My Hope Is In The Lord let's just sing that this morning don't you love him yes amen he's good to us my hope is in the Lord from this time on and every more my my hope is in the Lord forever more let's sing it again oh my hope it's in the Lord hallelujah come on and every more my I hope it's in the Lord forever more let's sing

presence come on Hallelujah oh my it's in the Lord forever more one more time My Hope Oh My hope it's in the Lord from this time on may God bless you brother Bower [Music] [Music] forever more amen praise the Lord how many believe that amen not just for a few days amen not just for a few weeks not for a few months not for a few decades not for for a few centuries not for a few Millennials but forever more amen I'm just glad to have a god like what we do amen God bless you this morning amen we are thankful for what God is doing and how he's been answering prayers and just been good to us in the midst of it all amen we know that we've got a lot of sickness and different things that goes on but you know brother bam said a church that isn't suffering isn't of God so you can expect the devil to attack isn't that right but I'm just glad that we can call on one to throw him out amen praise the Lord that'll be all for the music just hold on there if you will sister Hannah pewt amen she's going to come up uh I believe it's called a thyroid tumor that the devil has put in her body amen it's not hers amen but we're going to have special prayer deacons and ministers we're going to gather around and amen just pray for her that God will take that thing out of her body that's the temple of God Amen that the devil doesn't have any rights in that Temple amen amen and so we're just going to pray amen that uh God will take and touch her in a special way she goes Tuesday for surgery because it's the size of a cantaloupe I guess amen and by that size and so they're going to have to open up and it'll be a major surgery but we have a major God Amen that can major take care of her amen so praise the Lord so everybody will bind together how many believe we whatever whatever two or three gathered and agree on anything God will do but there's going to be a lot more than two or three is it right so we're going to believe that what the thing that we have asked Jesus said if you if you ask anything in my name I will do it and when you pray if you believe what you have asked for you shall have it how many believes that healing is the children's bread amen this is all right this is why tries was put on his back for our healing and we already thank God for all the healing we've had and sister Hannah testified to she knows that God has done a lot of her come and delivered her of a lot of things in the past and he's going to deliver her of this amen so if you would just pass this around each one amen get some Bible says amen call on the Elders of the church ain't that right amen anointing them with oil pray a prayer faith and they shall be healed amen amen let's gather together and let's bow our heads now Heavenly Father we come before you Lord Jesus so grateful that we have an awesome God like you you are the great physician Lord Jesus and we know that you can remove this without surgery Lord but if you choose to allow it Lord be go by the way of surgery we ask God that you would remove it that there wouldn't be one Speck of that tumor and that sister Hannah could live a long healthy good life amen in the name of Jesus Christ that she would be healthy and happy and uh we just ask God that you would touch her Lord Jesus and healer of it and this devil just come in the temple of Hannah God's Temple and try to come in here and cause her Lord pain and suffering we rebuke that devil in the name of Jesus Christ and we cast him out in Jesus Christ's name and we believe God that what we have asked for she will have Lord and now father we thank you Lord Jesus because we know you've already done it Lord It's Already Done and we believe it in Jesus name amen thank the Lord Jesus amen just that simple Faith thank you brother [Music] David amen and amen praise
