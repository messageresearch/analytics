we kind of broke our rule today and we're trying get a footer in amen before the next rain and so amen I ran a a machine from about 7:30 to 4:00 but I'd have never done that if I had my message in my heart already and so amen but anyway so y'all pray that the rain will hold off amen till we get that foot report amen we get going on it amen i' like to get it done amen so praise the Lord amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen all right um turn your bibles if you will amen and I'd really uh this message that I have here uh it's just something that you can just perhaps you can just say so much of it because you'll never touch a fourth of what what what it all encumbers amen but we want to try to express a few thoughts perhaps that the Lord would um want kind of laid on my heart amen and so we'll just pray that uh God will have his way turn I think we'll go to amen just the Psalms 34 let's go to Psalm 34 amen now that is nice you can have four books up here amen praise the Lord Psalms 34 I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall Contin be in my mouth my my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad amen oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together amen is't that something how we got a song Oh magnify the Lord with me amen for he is worthy to be praised how many please he's worthy to be praised amen and let me just kind of share with you uh this what where this come from and the thought that I had when this come and that is amen the things that God has blessed us with amen when I think thought about the blessings of God the things that he's blessed with bless us with it should turn and we should give blessing back to God Amen how many believes that and so that's what we want to speak on a little bit and by the help of the Lord and then we want to also look at what would cause people not to bless the Lord to give him the glory and the honor that's due to his name amen amen and so what would causes what causes that amen so now let's go on there's so many beautiful things here when I begin to read it was really the first verse I want it but there's so much good things in there I just read I want to read it all the way down to 19 oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all of my fears amen how many can say Amen to that maybe that's why David was saying I Will Bless The Lord at all times glory amen they looked unto him and were lightened their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles have many how many's been there oh my praise be to God my my my the angels of the Lord cth round about them that fear Him and deliver them I will bless the Lord for this also amen how many believe that oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him I will bless the Lord for this also oh fear the lord ye his Saints for there is no want to them that fear Him amen amen the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing Come Ye children hearken unto me and I will teach you the fear of the Lord amen what man is he that desireth life and loveth many days let him see good that he may see good keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips that they speak no goth keep him from speaking G depart from Evil and do good seek peace and pursue it is it too loud no yeah got a few too loud so near I'll move it away from mouth a little bit no all right you can adjust according for that would you all right cuz I'm hearing it back here real loud so amen the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry the face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth the righteous cry the Lord and the Lord heareth but deliver and deliver them out of all of their troubles I Will Bless The Lord the Lord is n to them that are of a broken heart and such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivera be to God you can be seated this Mo this evening amen this Mo morning this evening amen praise the Lord my my my I tell you what when I just when I begin to think this I thought about how blessed that we are amen and so tonight's subject is bless it I've spoken on it before but that's okay isn't it how many believ that we're [Applause] blessed in my mind after looking at some of these things I highly doubt whether we uh recognize half of how blessed we really are amen amen very blessed people amen now how many knows uh where blessings come from amen even if you go to heaven they call it the land of the blessed that right that blessed Promised Land the land of the blessed and the and the land of the Damned or the cursed amen that's where people will end up either one or the other but I got to thinking in my mind I got to thinking Lord you have been so good you have been so good to me you are so good to your people amen amen when you think about what the believer possesses what God has blessed you with amen let me say first of all talking about where blessings come from in Revelations 5 and verse 12 those 10,000s times 10,000s and verse verse 12 says they were saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing amen how many believer you know cuz a lot of time we get weak we get so but people don't recognize that whenever God gives he should get something in return don't you think whenever God blesses you you ought to get blessing back my my when you look at the scope of this it is pretty far and wide but he's worthy of blessing and honor and strength one place the Bible says you know that we are to love the Lord your God with all of your strength all of your mind all of your soul is that right all of your heart love him with all of it because he's worthy of it amen I've got wrote down here first of all God has given the believer what's he what what he's blessed us with amen he has given us access according to Hebrews the third chapter that we have access unto God by faith amen we have access amen into the blessings of God by faith and we know that even faith is the blessing of God Amen even faith is a blessing of God it causes you to have access to it and when you come into that world and into that realm amen it that Faith brings you to the power of the Holy Spirit it brings you to God gives you a power over your enemy amen how how many's glad to have your enemy under your feet demons that torment people how many believe that torment is not you don't you aren't Tor you know how many people are tormented out there they're tormented Demons of Torment that's what demons do they're Demons of Torment they torment people but you and I we aren't tormented tonight B Better B at one place blessed means happy happy oh my we got to be the what the Most Blessed the most happiest people on the face of the [Music] earth I think of where we're coming to we think of a persecution that's coming huh persecution that's coming we don't know just what'll happen yet do we we'll have to wait and see but we know that what we we come out of just a couple hundred years ago was brutal we as Christians did not have what we have today we lived in dens and caves of the earth and lost our lives 68 million give their lives brutally slaughtered killed in the most terrible way hey they didn't get to have houses oh my think about this my they have get to have lands and and have it like you and I we're blessed to be able to be us free and have the things that you [Music] do you know what I what I come to the conclusion is that a lot of times we are we're not thankful like we ought to be we don't praise God like we should because we don't recognize or think about the blessings that God has bestowed upon you but just seing about what how he's blessed you and how good he's been does something to me it should should I do I refuse to be ungrateful unth thankful for the blessings of God all right let's go down that road minute let's talk about it talk about the kind of people first of all the kind of people that don't give God the honor and the glory that's due to his name as far as I'm concerned they're vessels of Dishonor vessels fitted for Destruction huh all that God has done for them all the blessing he they spit in his face they're worthy of Destruction ain't that right in the Book of Romans we want to look at a group there of people who are unth thankful for the blessings of God amen amen and you know God doesn't much appreciate unthankfulness amen he really don't all right let me see here Romans 1 and we'll begin with verse 20 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God huh these people knew God they once knew God but they glorified him not as God in other words they didn't give him the honor they didn't bless God at all times a person that's always praising God for things they're a different type of person neither listen they glorified him not as God and neither were thankful there were a bunch of unthankful people ungrateful people how manyan we live in a country of ungrateful people you think about these young people and so forth and the riots and the unthankfulness of why they un thankful and then we've got the Border 5,000 more people trying to come and get a piece of what they got and they don't even know what they got they don't even realize they do not appreciate what they got but you don't appreciate what you got you're going to lose what you got you're going to get away from that's a problem man I don't care where it is when people oh my him I didn't mean to go here this quick but it goes for every aspect of our life amen you take a marriage amen I'm going to stop and finish my thought here and go over into Jude and then we'll get into it Lord willing all right they were not thankful but became vain became that way they were once this way now they became vain in their imagination and their foolish heart was darkened let me tell you something when you become unthankful and ungrateful and worship God the way that you should your heart gets darker amen professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of The Incorruptible God into an image made unto corruptible man and of birds and of forfo footed beasts and of creeping things my my my isn't about what theyve become a bunch of kittens in school bunch of dogs in school and everything else my gracious wherefore God has also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who change the truth of God into a lie and worship and serve the creature more than the Creator come on how many know don't you ever let the amen the physical things of the world Amen become more to you amen you that more than you god you're an ID doat Tre if you become that way that's what they do that's what the whole world loves they loves tangible things amen rather than god notice to this listen God gave them up the cleaness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who change the truth of God into a lie and worship the and serve the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this cause God gave two mile affections remember I told you homosexual them folks God gave them over to something y'all's quiet show me one tell me one tell me somebody that did huh oh my I don't say I'm not God but boy you're in bad shape listen who changed now notice vile affections for even there were women did change in natural use is that which was against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their own lust one Tower to another and even man with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of reward of eror which was meat even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do to things which are not convenient amen people who wants know God all the way to this bad how many knows that man Humanity has a way of backsliding and slipping away from God becoming unth thankful for the blessings in the goodness of God what do you think people quit Church well it's just too boring yeah that's right you let God become boring off you go slithering back in the water like some water turtle or something off in the world you go we all know people amen next time next thing they're cutting their hair wearing pants and everything else huh next thing you know they're divorced how many know it like a a relationship with God is like a marriage you can't let it get up amen oh my people man you become just common to one another I'm thankful for your wife I'm thankful for your husband you don't realize that M you were so blessed to have that person that you didn't mind saying I do and vow to the rest of your days until death do you part no you thought it was a greatest blessing ever now you don't think it's a blessing anymore huh you better rekindle your fire that's right why unth thankful they don't realize the blessing that they [Applause] have is that the truth that's right M let's look at that look at another group over in the book of Jude it talks about in verse 16 it says these are murmurers and complainers walking after their own lusts a that right people that aren't happy huh I mean there people that aren't happy they don't aren't thankful for their blessings that they have when I think about if you really have Christ in your heart youve got God in your heart we'll get more into it you are a blessed person amen that's right what are these people these people that it's talking about these people they are these are murmurers and complainers walking after their own lusts and so forth it talks about way back it starts with I will verse five I will therefore have put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards destroy them that believe not amen how many knows God gave Israel every chance in the world 10 or 11 chances I think it was 10 different 10 or 11 different times that God had mercy on him different times he uh he was going to just say Moses just separate yourself and I'll wipe the whole thing off can you imagine if Moses wouldn't have come in there the whole the whole lot would have been extinct it would have been just naan and car being swallowed up got to WIP the ball it's a terrible thing to be a non-believer it's a terrible thing to disbelieve God after he has proven himself to you oh my how many know I don't think that we're sufficiently impressed this evening amen with the fact that you don't have to wonder about what your religion is right or not we have the message amen where Jesus himself would come down and prove that what he said was right and that ought to mean the world to us it means everything the budha don't have none of those world religions you are blessed above all the religions of the world you've got the proof that Jesus Christ amen that what you following his right Jesus would come down and Vindicated Time and Time and Time After Time don't I wish the world could hear that Jesus would come there prove it how many know it's the Pentecostals they got so used to it that's the problem people get so used to it every little blessing of God becomes so common to people till they no time they're complaining they're murmuring they're not satisfied with it amen my my my we won't go too much but he talks about Israel afterwards and even the angels and which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation the angels in heaven had the same problem of letting it become common to them there's a lot of message preachers or preachers I don't know about message preach that have went beyond brother bam they think they have my the tapes are old they get tired of listen to that same message again and again and again and again and again I shouldn't laugh maybe but it's kind of funny but I'm here to tell you they get tired of what over in heaven it wouldn't be long another Angel up there talk them into want to follow something different wouldn't take long that's I won't that's why God won't have them over there God wants people who's try and proven over here to they'll stay with God and you'll only stay with God as god holds you amen aren't you glad oh my I don't probably won't never get into this but you know even when the chastisement and the rebuke of God you're a blessed person if God gives a whip to you and beat you up good that's a whole lot better than being lost you should judge yourself so you should not be judged when you're chasing of the Lord so that you won't be condemned with the world thank you Lord thank you Lord for preachers that come by and just step all over my to rebuke me for my lukewarmness that's what we need thank you God you're blessed in that way also you're blessed your eyes are blessed Jesus said you know they look it it's hard to see the Fe things that you that you do having eyes they see not having ears they hear not eyes that can see blessed are your eyes blessed are your ears we're blessed you can see is he thatth are you if you have heard the prophecy blessed are you if you can believe Malachi 4 you're blessed you're a happy [Music] person I'm too busy being happy

remember brother bam also said you know everybody wants the goodness of God but you got to remember God is the God of Justice also amen Justice For The Sinner out there but for you and I remember he's not just a god of blessing you and making everything good for you but he's a god of chastisement God is he's a god of correction amen that's a blessing praise the Lord so we look at these I've got a another another something else I want to bring here the Angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habit a as you get older how many likes that just kind of have habits and a routine I don't know about you but I kind of like my routine we went down Florida for a weekend and come back brother John and it took me days to get back in my routine I was like I'm G to get back in my routine here I'm going to get up I want to have my coffee I want to go do this and I want to go that and this that or the other is that right well let me tell you that's the way ought to be amen with God that you ought to be in a routine that you love me a place that God has put you the way that you do things amen and keep doing them because the devil wants you to stop doing what you're doing change it amen left the habitation he has reserved in Everlasting chain under Darkness unto the Judgment of the great day even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities run about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication going after strange flesh are set forth for an exampling suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh they despise the Dominion they speak evil of dignities M remember he's talking about certain men verse four that have come in crept in unawares who before of old are ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ amen listen even Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses thirst not ring against him ailing accusation but said the Lord reuk you but these speak evil of things which they know not how many believ that child of God they got a what you my mouth but that they know naturally as brue priests in those things they corrupt themselves them for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the air of B for reward it perished in gain saying of Kora these are spots in your feasts of Charity when they Feast with you uhoh the people sometimes right amongst you watch out would it be okay watch out for the make believer in the church watch out he ain't got so much watch out for the unbeliever nah but to make believer it's lie sneaky just so a little seed Discord clouds they are without water carried about winds whose trees whose fruit withered without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots Raging Waves of the sea foaming up their own chain wondering stars to whom is reserved the Blackness and darkness forever and Enoch also the sabath from Adam prophesied saying behold the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his Saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their deeds which they have L committed and of all their hard speeches which ungod Sinners have spoken against them we touched a little bit on that in the last sermon these are murmurers and complainers think about it these are people that don't give God the glory the blessing the praise all stooped all the way down to complaining how many knows murmuring and complaining is a way low it's way down there if you're doing that you're way down there didn't Israel murmur and complain and God sends fiery serpents among them because of their complaining oh my here's another one I jotted down when the Holy Spirit kind of sing me talk about Job how many know job was a rich man he had lands he had more oxen and sheep and uh man camels Gore he had all oh man a wonderful group of family he had a portrait of all nine of his children and these are my beautiful wonderful children God's been so good but you know one thing about job is he didn't get laed and stop praying every morning he would pray for his children offer and sacrifice for himself in case my children sin Lord please forgive them every parent wants to pray that for their children Lord if my children have sinned forgive them would you Lord like I do the church men Lord if there's any sin if any anybody has committed anything Lord forgive them Lord when we come in those doors we want everything here so the Holy Spirit can just Flow Free Lord forgive him make a sacrifice and God goes and he takes everything away from him huh kills his children takes all of his financial things man left him with nothing and what did he do he blessed the Lord anyway it did not cause job in all of his distress to stop blessing the Lord he said the lord gave the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord how many believe bless God in all times in the good times blessed are you and Men shall revile you and persecute you Peter said man if you are suffer wrongfully and so forth you're blessed and you re receive a blessing you receive a blessing when people do bad to you and you receive a blessing when people do good to you as a Christian how many know you oh man you're just plain blessed I am am bless I am blessed every day that I live I am happy when I wake up in the morning when I lay my head to rest I am blessed I am blessed amen all right what else do we for now one more illustration before I want to go and read some of these other things and I want to talk to you about another class of people that got away from God Amen and that was the Ephesian Church age isn't that right they begin to get LAX it says they've got laxed that's what Ephesus means relaxed and drifting amen he said had something against him nevertheless I have somewhat against the because thou H has left thy first love amen how many believe you don't want to lose your love you don't want to lose your love for your wife want to lose your love for your husband you don't want to lose your love for God when you lose your love look out these people had lost their first love to understand this must you must realize that the spirit is not speaking to the original Saints at Ephesus alone but the whole span of the 120 years it's message then it's all the generation he says Now history keeps repeating itself in one a generation in the generations of Israel we see a Revival in one generation and only see the fires fading in the next and in the third generation only Embers were slightly glowing but in the fourth there may not be any vest whatsoever of the original flame then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it's simply the manif ation of the truth that God has no grandchildren how many believe that that applies to the message folks I don't care how on mess's Pew benches you've got to have a genuine personal experience with all Mighty God Amen he says salvation is not passed on just by natural birth anymore amen is that that there is to a Apostolic succession listen listen you start out with truly Born Again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they are no longer just plain Christians amen but they have taken some denominational name amen the fervent desire to please God the to know him and his and word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and become a bit formal [Applause] my my mind this is what H happened back there to the Ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to God was dying out and the people weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they were beginning to careful about the world thought of them the second generation come along was just like is they demanded a king to be like other nations when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway that's the history of the church when it thinks more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God isn't long until they see them stopping doing the things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially amen they change their manner of dress their attitudes their behavior amen hello they get locks now that cycle of Revival of death has never failed all you have to do is recall the in the spirit when men and women Dr like Christians went to church prayed all night took in street corners weren't ashamed of the manifestation of the spirit they left their old dead churches and worshiped in homes and store and buildings they had reality see how that first church man they begin to get away from God and how many know it got colder and colder until they were completely away from God I said to that and when I thought about that I thought how blessed you are according to the cycle Danny you should be quiet as a mouse just amen yeah brother R I guess that's right I guess it was all right tonight went chch you know I guess it was all right brother rer screamed hollered again you know he didn't really have much to say nothing I didn't know

unless I really need to know it I don't care to fill my ears with it cuz then I got to contend with that in my mind during the day most of the time it just SS doubt isn't that right sit here talk

saying in verse three blessed are the poor or in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God wow here Jesus Goes Again Begin pronouncing a blessing blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
