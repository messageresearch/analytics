evening before we approach the word our heavenly father Lord we just come to you Lord we're so thankful Lord that we can come in an hour Lord where a lot of people are falling away but Lord you have come and you've poured out your word and our roots are driving deeper and deeper Lord the winds can blow and the storms can come but Lord we we don't get uprooted but Lord you just bend us a little bit and it helps us just get stronger and stronger Lord we're thankful for every trial and every tribulation that we've gone through and Lord we're thankful for every Mountain that we've set on and every Sunrise that we've seen and Lord we're thankful for an opportunity to be here tonight Lord and we ask Lord you just come and speak to us through your word tonight Lord Lord as we would just set ourselves aside and ask you Lord you minister to us we ask you to be with us now in the reading of your word you bless it in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles tonight I want to turn to the book of Hebrews chapter 6 beginning at verse 13 and I would just like to minister for a few minutes here on a captive to the Covenant captive to the Covenant so here we find here it says for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater in oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of the promis immutability of his counsel aren't you glad for that confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor look at listen what is your anchor the hope we have as an anchor of a soul both sure and steadfast which entereth in within the veil and you could have your seats this evening as I this let me just read this to you out of the message MDC the great Prince and King he says what a marvelous promise two immutable things God cannot lie and be God that's right oh now if it God made a promise in his Bible here we believe God to be infallible word of God if God made a promise in this Bible ible we have this consolation now this word consolation as we just read in Hebrews and brother Brandon makes a statement again is a comfort it's a peace and it's assurance and know that it's impossible for God to lie therefore when we see he promised it in the Bible We Believe It soul body and spirit we believe it we just don't believe it with our with our mind we don't have an intellectual Faith about it but we believe it with our soul it drops down and begins to take root and when it begins to take root in your soul all of a sudden things begin to happen around you it begins to take over your body and it becomes subject to that faith that is laying there and what happens and then the spirit is moving across that faith that is laying there and brings that body subject to the word and you become a place where God's promise is now laying there the immutability of God is laying inside of you body mind and soul has wrapped around the word of God and stepped in there and you have become infallible just as God has become infallible see it's impossible for God to lie he said there's if there's any fault it's in us not in God let me just say that there's any fault because the people have walked away it's not in God it's in us it's in us that we've walked away he says now for God is obligated to his word as he has sworn by his word so the obligation to God by his word comes by God himself now I know we've all given commitments we've all given uh well should we say Oaths or covenants to one another saying we would do certain things be there at certain times and and things like that you know one of the greatest things that we've done as as a a man in time and we know those that are married youve given an oath to your wife that you would provide for and sickness and health you know it's hard to get up and go to work when you're not feeling good I'm just being honest you know that it's hard to get up and go to work when you're not feeling good but these are Oaths that we made to one another now an oath is a formal or solemn or a binding agreement or contract so you give your word to saying that you would provide for her you would stand in the gate and be her protection for her you would be the priest of the home you would stand there in that place and as a as a diviner between your household in God as the one that was being applying the blood so you find that you would sit in this place of this Covenant this oath that God would give is not just an oath but it comes God's identity you realize your word becomes your identity you know we used to say how that that we would give a man's word he's only as good as his word it's because it became his identity if he would he would say he would be there at a certain time and he wouldn't show up you wouldn't hire that man to do a job or you know he wouldn't do things that way or or you wouldn't you you know you wouldn't do things certain way his circumstances rise up you understand that but you understand when God gave his word no circumstance can rise up and block his word he sent his word and it performed his work when God would send his word he would perform his work and he would stand there as the Assurance to you that you were standing beside somebody that would stand beside his word you know when the pilgrims come and they sailed across the ocean on the ship called the mayflower and they landed they were wanted to land in Virginia but they ended landed up in in Massachusetts and they they set up they said there was there was pilgrims and there was non- pilgrims on this ship there was two there was two different there were some that were running from religious freedom and there were some that were that were running from the the Natural Freedom that they had because they were they were might have been Sinners they might have been law Breakers so they boarded the ship and they were running across the ocean but here stood the pilgrims and they said we've got to come up with an agreement to where we can come in a Unison and we can Thrive to a place of survival and go back and look it up the history and they wrote the Mayflower Compact which is basically a contract in which the settlers consented to follow certain Community rules and regulations for the sake of the order and survival yeah that's right oh my it created laws to go by that they can live and work in prosperity you think about that it created laws for their survival and God sent his word for our survival he sent it to us that we would something Survive by and we just throw it around like it's nothing and we think it's something that we just don't have to worry about but this word that God was shed this Covenant that he would give to us was not given to us by man but when God would give come to Abraham he would stand there as God himself and when he approached Abraham and he called him out of the land of Earth the calans called him out to a land of desert of desolation I just love Abraham we find that Abraham is following the word of God spoken to him don't we look like a fanatic to everyone else you might look like a fanatic to everyone else but let me tell you when you got the Vindicated word speaking to you that's what gives you this chance to stand there you won't back up no more you've got a backbone you know where you stand on God's word I'm talking about being captive to the Covenant now I'm not going talking about being a captive you're held in bondage to this thing this ain't no bondage thing but this is a love affair and so when God would confirm his Covenant to Abraham he would even he would actually would just he would send his word to him but one day years had passed the time of life had come and gone in Sarah Abraham an old man dried up one day he was sitting out there and he saw saw a man walking across the desert as he watched this man walk there he recognized it wasn't just no ordinary man nobody just seemed to stop by Brother Tom and stop by Abraham's tent and want to sit down and have fellowship with with him he was an outcast But Here Come God stepped into a flesh body that he created walking out on there the Sands of the desert upon the plains of mamry and he stood there and he stepped into Abraham's tent door and when he spoke Abraham recognized this is the same voice that has been speaking him for years has now manifested himself among him let me tell you we've heard the voice of God it was wasn't through a man but it was God himself speaking to us oh my but see here he is he says now on the proof of his resurrection he says because it's the word of God that's right God can't take back his own word he gave Abraham the word he says look you and Sarah are going to have a son so God couldn't take that word back he had G spoke the word out there now notice how he spoke the word out there and is now out there now God couldn't take it back God's not an India Giver he doesn't throw it out there and pull it back he doesn't he he sends it out there and no matter how much it would Vex his soul he would still perform his word so God once God speaks a word he's got to stay with it he can I can say a word and take it back and you can do the same but God can't he speaks a word he's got to stay with it and he said those words so God honors his word so when God cannot lie and he backs up his word we notice when his word begins he begins to speak his word it begins to set things in order isn't over in Genesis 1 that when he begin to speak the word he put the sun in his place is that right he set the sun in his orbit they have tried to figure out why the sun is that way let me tell you why the sun's that way God said it that way I don't want to understand why I just believe it God said it that way he set the moon in his right place in its order he set it where it's at it's opposite of the done oh my think about it he set the stars in their order he set every single one in their order in their place he said every single I notice and also when he come down he set the Earth in its order he set in it its place in the right distance from the Sun that it will not burn up think of this you're living in a place that is the exact distance that's to the very very very decimal meter that is sitting there that it will not burn by the sun's fire and if God set that Earth in order that we live in this earth and then he began to set animal life and body life in order and he done that now look what he did he set you in the right place you think you said I could have lived in that age I could have lived in that time you could have lived in that time you had to live in this time this is the age that you had to live in you had to live in this hour there's no other age that you could have been living in but this hour you had a set God set his word word and that word is in you and you were set in this hour why do you think he brought all the chromosomes all down through your family history and tied them all together and you would stand there and you would take God at his word and say this is nothing but the truth and God would come down and vindicate it right there among you let me tell you that's a covenant not given by man oh my that's a covenant given by God so then when the word begins to take its evidence upon the face of the Earth Earth we notice what happens it begins to move across the waters and it begins to call out the land and causes separation from the the waters and it causes the mountains to come forth but also out of that Earth would come mankind now you didn't come by by Evolution where they say two pows come and join themselves over on the back side of a lily pad but you came by the spoken word of God God spoke and he took that dust of that Earth and he spoke and he he called that it was a called it man it was a man he didn't have an actual name he called a man brother Ram said his toes were tied into the Earth like the roots of a tree but when the spirit of God broed across that body all of a sudden those toes begin to break loose and it begin to move around and it begin to walk around in God's kingdoms God's spoken word and when it walked around God spoken word it recognized the authority they had on the word of God and it stood there and it realized what was inside of it and God called that man Adam cuz it was just like God the first being was man that he called Adam now we've got the evidence of the word we say that same Spirit dwells in us that spoke to Adam and brought him to life right we got that same Spirit how do you how do you say that I ain't got a driver's license that tells me I got the same spirit I ain't got no physical identification right here I ain't got no tattoo on my arm it's not tattooed on my forehead but what I've got sit down inside of me is faith faith in God's word that he has spoken so if that faith that was inside of God when he begin to speak his word lays inside of me let me tell you what church there's evidence of a inside of you inside of you and all youve got to do is take the check but of faith and begin to write the checks what are we afraid of we're not lacking in faith we're not lacking in faith let me tell you we're not lacking in faith what got some 1100 some messages preached what is it doing building your faith faith is the evidence of un thing faith in action works without faith is dead brother preaches the works of Faith what is you doing calling the bride up into faith into the power of the Living God the recognize who they are we're not lacking look the funds are there but we're not lacking in faith but we're lacking in the ability to write the check I think we got some of the greatest people around you know I travel around a little bit and I run into different people go to different places and I feel just right at home I feel comfortable I don't feel I don't feel all like a ball of nerves why because faith has been established in the hearts of the people when faith is established in the hearts of the people they recognize who is among them and when you recognize it's not your faith but it's God's faith that is dwelling inside of you it's God's faith is took of his AB Boe inside of you now what is God's faith God's faith is his word given to you laying inside of there that whatever you have need of all you got to do is write out the checkbook look the checks won't bounce it doesn't matter how much you think well I think I'm G I'm a bank God bankrupt God on this right here look the checks won't bounce they wouldn't bounce look what happened to Egypt down in Egypt Israel went into Egypt because there was a famine in the land isn't that right so they went down in Egypt now notice what here what happened here as they're down in Egypt now in Exodus 1:7 now notice what be to take place here I want you to I want you to I want you just to catch some things here the Bible says here in verse 7 it says and the children of Israel were fruitful you're talking about a people in bondage they were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceedingly Mighty and the land was filled with them these are people blood Tom that are in bondage and they're multiplying and they're fruitful and they're they're they're growing they're prosperous they're they're let me tell you wherever they were at and they recognized who they were under the anointing of God they were blessed he says they now he says now now there rose up a new king over Egypt which knew not Joseph and he said unto his people behold the people of Israel are more and mightier than we come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply they've already done multiplied I guess he wasn't really seeing what was going on and it come to pass that when they were fallen out of any War they should join unto our enemies and fight against us and so get up out of the land therefore they did said over them test masers to afflict them with their burdens and they built for Pharaoh trasure cities fit them and Ramsey and the more they Afflicted them now notice the more they Afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew God is fulfilling his word right here cuz they are Abraham's seed that wherever they were at underneath Abraham's Covenant the seed Seed of Abraham God would blessed him right so now here they are in Affliction they multiplied and grew and it grieved be and they were grieved because of the children of Israel and the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with rigor and they made their lives bitter in hard bondage and in mortar and brick and all manner of service in the field and they all their service whereing they may them serve with rigor but you know how in the world did they get to this place right here it's because they they come into this land because there was a famine and yet under the blessing of God upon their lives they multiplied and grew Pharaoh recognized that if he did not bring these people under captivity it would be a great detriment to them so slowly he begin to Rob them of their freedoms he begin to cut off the Avenues to which God would come and bless him with standing there and he might have been slipped in little things where and the task matters would put more burdens on them and cause them to work harder and actually set them up in Pharaoh's house separated mothers and daughters and sons and fathers and husbands and wives and they separated them but you know what was laying there the laying there was a promise that God had give Abraham says know for shity in Genesis 15 and13 he says know as shity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterward they shall come out with great substance so here the promise of Deliverance was already spoke by God and now here we find Israel Abraham's seed down in bondage and that God has sent his word out and that promise of deliverer had been laying there and maybe for 300 60 years that promise was laying there and it moved across a little woman that that promise come across and she birthed a son Called Moses yeah and brother says now Moses's mother would tell him look you are the deliverer of Israel you are a Hebrew you are the the a son of Abraham you're not a son of Pharaoh's sister you're not a son of Pharaoh's house h but you are a son of the Living God you're an Israelite and you see with that the promise of the Deliverance was laying in Abraham in Moses because God had already spoke the word to Moses Abraham and so when God be to speak the word now he recognized that the word had to go out now here stands a man that's been promised to be delivered and so what happened here is God began to move across cross that word and he be to hear the cries of his people what were they doing they were writing out checks they were writing out checks for deliverance checks of Faith was being set up let me tell you they were bombarding the Throne of heaven and it did not fall on deaf ears in Exodus 2 and 23 it says this and it come to pass in a process of time oh my that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their Cry came up to God by reason of the bondage their bondage their cries and bondage begin to reach God's ears aren't you glad that when you were in bondage your cries reached God's ears you remember where you were at you know where you were at I know where I was at God's cries the cries that reached God's ears and when those cries reach God's ears God had already set it back in motion before the world was ever created and you was in the mind of God God had already set it in motion what day and what hour that word would move across your life and the Bible says and God heard their groaning and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham and with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto them what a place to be that God would have respect upon on them oh I think God has respect on us Moses come now he come as a deliverer fulfilling the word of God they wanted to have Fellowship back with their creator again they wanted the worship and the freedom that they were know KN that they were born to Worship in so God sent his gift down there among them look they didn't accept it at first they rejected it they rejected Moses at first because they said who are you you're just like the Egyptians you think by killing one of them you're going to set us free Moses when he begin to realize that he was the deliverer look he thought it was something he could do on his own accord he was a man of war he knew how to fight he knew how to lead great men in battle he knew how to do great things but you know what did God had to do he says God God had placed my word in you but Moses look I've got to take that all that the world has put in you I've got to take it out so he went up on the backside of a desert for 40 more years and God heed everything that the world had ever put in him HED it out of them now he stepped out of there that one day walking down across through there walking down through there stepped up in the feris church and Tabernacle and says Lord let my people go don't you think that's where you were at you were dwelling in Satan's Tabernacle let me tell you anywh where were God's down at his Satan's Tabernacle you were dwelling in there but God sent his word down there and there was somebody stood there with a staff in his hand and says let my people go oh my do you realize what was being spoke there when brother saw that Vision he says he saw the church bound behind those bars and he couldn't figure out he tried to break the bars and something come over him and says just speak the word and know he said he said gates of hell hounds of Hell give loose bars of sin give away what happened what happened the rush out of people crying under great anticipation of their freedom Lord oh my look now he says this in the spoken words The Original Seed he says like the mighty anointed Prophet Moses god knew oh my knew God would use him for he had proved Moses to be a servant by his peculiar birth at the right time now the Deliverance of Abraham's seed was at that time he says sure you get here Moses never stayed in Egypt and argued his scriptural points with them that's just the scripture let me just tell you it didn't say that he sat down and had debate with Pharaoh he just said let my people go Pharaoh says what are you talking about Moses already out the door he said God said let my people go he didn't stand there and fuss and argue with them he just gave them the word let the word take root look that's some sometimes these people want to stand around fuss and argue and debate let me just tell you if you back at up by the word we can have a talk we can have a conference but you you just try to pull stuff out of the air let me just tell you I ain't going to have no conference for that I'm not going to argue with you I'm just going to quote scripture and be gone I'm going to stand there and say what the Bible says well they say well we don't need that well you going to throw that out why don't we throw Paul out why don't we throw Wesley out you think you're following the their Methodist you think you're following Wes Wesley's message anymore no they done left John Wesley alone time ago they threw out John Wesley they went to stand look brother one this look brother says this in the in his in his ministry he say the John Wesley roll in his grave knowing what they were doing today let me just say this he would roll over you again if he knew what they were doing today and how much just arguing and fussing and fighting am among our ranks we realize in order to get out of this for the Covenant to come to pass we got to be unified behind the word of God and I'm not saying making treaties with the devil I'm not making a compact with the devil but notice he never fussed with the priest he went in the wilderness and waited on the Lord until the people was ready to receive him he had to come testified of them he had to come to testify of them and he would and they would receive him God called his Prophet to the Wilderness God testify he had chose him how did God testify he chosen he threw down his rod and become a snake Pharaoh says look my suavs can do the same thing they threw down their rods but what happened Moses Rod ate up all the other ones so we can do this that's God done this oh we can do this oh we can do this but there's only one thing they couldn't do they couldn't apply the token to keep the death angel out only God's elect had the ability to apply that token they come underneath the order of the word they applied the token he said God had notice he says oh get ready he says but the people the waiting for Moses are ready for the ready to receive Moses and the true sign overlooked he says Israel could not get into action down there with signs and wonders until they fell on their afas and prayed for God for a deliverer God had his deliverer God had a prophet hanging up there in the wilderness kept them there for 40 years waiting for them to get right to pray and when they got Right and started praying God sent the deliverer isn't that what we've done to this day look we were tied up look you go back you were let me just tell you this we were tied up in denominational systems right you said well I cut my teeth on the messy Pew I'm going just tell you to be frank with you you were tied up in a denominational system people have tagged themselves saying they they they've been a message believer their whole life you know what you've done you've tied yourself because you youve tied yourself to a denominational system you're putting a name to it I'm not I'm not doing way with the message and I'm not doing way with the prophet but I want you to recognize it doesn't matter you've got to have a new birth to recognize that this is nothing but the truth of God your faith has got to come back to the word of God I'm not coming because Mama come or Daddy come or Grandma and Grandpa coming I want you to come because you got a revelation that God has come down inside of your heart and he has convicted the word inside of you and it's come in line with his word that's what we need in this hour you want to see a move among the young people get the word of God moving among them let him let the revelation of the word come in Satan knows he can jump and shout and do all that but when he cannot he cannot duplicate he cannot duplicate the faith of God in your life CU God has put it there he cannot replicate that he can counterfeit a lot of things in the message you anoing ones the end time think of what he's done I was talking to me and a guy work the other day we was talking about it so about how the music has changed and all this I said look I told him I said look people have been anointed that they've catched in that realm I says but they're not you look at them you look at them they got earrings all over tattoos all over and they're standing up there singing gospel songs what has that happened the Covenant the non non-believers that tapped into the Covenant but they're not getting behind the veil but God has called us by the order of the Covenant by the sworn o of God that we have power to enter behind that Veil and what takes us back there the blood of Jesus Christ applied to our Liv takes us back behind that Veil that's how Moses could come down there calling out saying let my people go because he met the pillar of fire up there on the mountain and he knew that what it was it God had given him his commission and he received his commission he didn't go in Moses's name he come in the name of the I am and sent me the god of Abra Abraham Jacob and Isaac has sent me oh let me tell you what has happened to us today we've come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he coming this hour and he has sent us by his word and commissioned us to take his word we've been giving checkbooks of Faith so here Moses comes down says look you've been depositing these checks you've been you've been writing these checks out and you've been looking at your checkbook your bank account and is still saying pending but I'm here to tell you that it's been approved it's been approved this is the hour that your faith in God's word has been approved it's now cized you ever look on your bank statement it says cized as as as you know entertainment groceries food miscellaneous you know what miscellaneous does it covers a lot of things you know what's happened you're you say well I've been writing this out you've come under salvation look in your check look in your bank statement you got salvation that's been withdrawn you've come under baptism you said I'll repent I'll be baptized that's been res withdrawn you come under fulfill he says and you shall be filled with the gift of the Holy Ghost you look in your bank account that's gone now what's take place you say I think I've got it all covered I got all these things covered now let me tell you there's a miscellaneous section it's called Grace that every mistake that you will ever make from here on out is underneath that blood token that God sent his Grace Covenant down to you it wasn't just a word covenant law covenant God sent his Grace Covenant and you're standing underneath there no matter how how much you fail you know that God is more than able cuz that blood is still applied and you don't want to do anything that hurt him oh you don't want to do anything to hurt him brother man says I would go overseas and fly thousands of miles he says and I tell mey honey I love you he says and I come back and she would say honey I love you too he says now I go over there he says oh he says I might slip and I might maybe I slip and fall he says but I want because I love her and she loves me and you realize that God loves you so much that he sent his word out and he says little bride I love you I'm going to send you a deliverer in your place of bondage and you say Lord here I am I love you I love you I love you Lord why because you recognize that you don't want to do anything to hurt him it's become a Affair look we're not held by bonds of sin we're not captive to the the chains of sin but let me tell you this is a love affair that holds us I'm Bound by the chains of love this is what keep this is what sought me love sought me I didn't search it out love sought me this is God's covenant to me his love never fails me his grace never fails me love and grace are walking in harmony together thank oh my and if I fail him I can say Lord forgive me forgive me and he's just and knows that he's able to forgive oh my so now here stood Moses I'm not even getting nowhere on this here stood Moses the Fulfillment of the deliverer of their cries of of Faith was now standing right in front of them oh man you realize what what what what you can write out out of this checkbook the checks in faith that you can write oh listen to this you can write checks of Faith you can write Faith and Healing God's atonement by his stripes you're healed what happened when they slew that lamb brother Carol used to preach a message years ago he talked about he says when they slew that lamb and they would take apart that lamb he says they would eat that lamb he says they would go back there he says eating of that lamb when they walked out of there he says every single one of them he says the old paw with his crooked old back was now straight ma she might have been hunched over she was now straightened up there was not one person walked out of Egypt weak or feeble because they had partook of that lamb what is it they had partook of that healing remedy the dissolver of all doubts a dissolver of all illnesses and infirmities they had took part of that healing virtue and they recognized with the power that laid in that lamb and they took part of it look when they walked out of her not even a soul was on their feet the shoes of their feet ever wore out you talk about a promise you want to get up tomorrow and recognize the same shoes that will you bought them brand new still look like they're brand new let me tell you when you walk in God's word the word is just as real today as it was 20 years ago it's just as real today as it was 40 years ago and I might say this it's just as real today as it was 80 100 years ago even back 2000 years ago the day of Pentecost it's the same Living Word that we're standing under today oh my restoration of the family check has been wrote questions you got questions the check has been wrote Oh My the dissolver you got doubts let me tell you the quest the check has been wrote the dissolver of all doubts has come on the scene you want leadership the check has been wrote and I'm not talking about in a man your pastor but I'm talking about in the Lord Jesus Christ oh my there's a lot of benefits in this check that we've that we got to write a lot of benefits in this checkbook you don't like I said you don't have to worry about it bouncing I'm not worried about it being bankrupt because God put the funds in there God put his word in you and brother say this he says everything you have need of already lies inside of you so the word already lays inside of you Rapture and Faith already lays inside of you so if rapture and Faith lays already already lays inside you something's got to come across you and move across you all of a sudden the raise that up that's just my thinking you planted they planted corn we come down the road I see where they planted corn it rained the Corn's coming up I'm not very smart but I'm telling you that the Corn's coming up faith has been planted in the church for years we need the moving of the spirit I'm not saying we don't have it but I'm just saying we need it more than we ever needed it cuz I'm ready for a body change I tell you what I'm so tired to this Covenant one day I'm going to be like Enoch I'm going to walk right out of this body this old gray hair be black again I don't have to worry about no aches or pains I don't have to have perfect 2020 Vision there be no dysi is in your body no more why because you're taking partakers of that Covenant it's tied you're so tied to it you can't get away from it oh in fellowship with God through reconciliation he says oh when a Believer comes like that God gives him a checkbook for any Redemptive blessing he died for oh in Jesus name it's signed at the bottom of it are you afraid to fill it out he says it now I'm just going to read I'm just going to tell you what he says he says if you're it says you're a coward I know I don't want to be a coward that song a coward in service has no place got to keep on the fire and line here we are he says if you're afraid to fill it out you're a coward he says you'll never come in contact with God but once you get in contact with God the holy spirit makes Christ real in your heart you're you're not afraid to take God at his word any time or believe not just on Wednesdays and not just on Sundays but he said anytime I'm talking about Monday morning I'm talking about Thursday morning I'm talking about Friday morning every any time at any place he says you come oh he says you make cond you're not afraid to take God his word at any time or believe so you take it and you believe it because you've been in contact with the supernatural you've come back into Fellowship you've come back into reconciliation through the blood and believe God and you know you've been in his divine presence so then God would say this in Ezekiel 16 and 62 would say and I will establish my Covenant with thee and thou shalt know that I am the Lord then in First Peter uh 1 3-5 he would say blessed be the god of our father Lord Jesus Christ who according to His abundant Mercy had begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to The Inheritance now notice this is our hope this is where our faith lays right here our faith is not laying in what we could attain in this world what happened down there Lot's wife she had built up such a an image and a society and so much down there and Sodom that when the Angels come down there notice when the Angels come down there and said it's time to go don't tees it's just time to go we got to go you can't try to set this in order and set that in order it's time to go lot being with Abraham recognized who these men were so he stepped in order of the angels and they said Don't Turn back doesn't the Bible say remember lot's wife she turned back and she became a pillar of salt why because she had set so much of her inheritance uncorruptible things her hope was in those things that would that were corruptible yeah in the societies the women's society and the women's league and and then all the social aspects of her life the Bible says to an inheritance Incorruptible think of this Lots standing underneath there underneath those angels commission hearing those commissions of the Angel he recognizes they've come from an incomparable Place turns and tells his wife he says we got to go and don't look back here she is she becomes a pillar of salt lot continues on with the angels why because he recognized that he was going to a place of saf y oh your inheritance is Incorruptible and undefiled and fadeth not away reserved in heaven through you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in this last time so God was going to send his word and drop an inheritance to you that is not a corruptible inheritance you don't have to worry about the storms of life taking it away from you people can come against you but you don't have to worry about them taking it out from you they'll come and try look Satan's job is trying to get you to disbelief that his weapon is superior than your weapon he's trying to get you brother say he say that that your weapon is inferior to his what do you've got you've been armed with faith and so when God drops his word inside of you that Covenant that oath of his promise look he's going to swear by himself there's no greater person that could stand behind this word than God himself no matter how much you would take it before a judge the judge can't stand look I can't stand behind it no more than I have to stand behind God's word so God would stand behind his word and he would drop that word inside your heart and you would recognize that it's God's word that is in you and when that God's word drops down inside of you now look Satan is trying to rob you and tell you what you've got the word of God is not able to overcome you got questions you're sitting on a fence about some things don't you worry about it stay with God's word God will manifest his word will he' done it time and time again he's not going to stop now you're wondering what is going on around the world let me tell you stay with God's word don't get focused on everything else stay with the word God gave his Covenant to you God placed his word inside of you you're the Church of the overcoming power the word of God lays inside of you it doesn't lay anywhere else it doesn't lay nowhere else and you're not cowards Satan would try to tell you you're a coward you don't believe God like so and so you know they got such great faith and seems like whenever they got trouble so God moves for them look don't you worry about that you tell even if you've got a mustard seed of Faith laying inside of you you let the Holy Spirit work over that Mustard Seed of Faith it's as mighty as seed but let me tell you you know when you eat something that's made out of mustard and then when the devil Begins the T taking of that sandwich he'll know that there's something inside of you said oh they got a little something they got a little mustard face inside them I can't eat of that sandwich no more but if you like look look I like mustard some people don't like mustard I don't you think about this I thought about this here while I go brother Tom I thought when I eat mustard I know it's on that sandwich you can put mayonnaise you can put ketchup you can put a lot of things on that sandwich but I know there's mustard on it and I like it I don't like Tula fish and I can know when there tuna fish in something cuz my taste buds tell me that there's tuna fish if I eat it so what do you got to do the devil wants to get one something let me tell you you just take give them a faith sandwich and say here devil eat this right here the just shall live by faith well that was Luther's message yeah it was what does the just also mean the righteous who are you you're the righteousness of God you become the righteousness of God and what makes it what that make you you makes you righteous not on your own accord but it's God's Accord that is now dwelling inside you it's a righteousness now you're standing here the just shall live by faith the righteous shall live by faith what in God's word it's not me that doeth the works it's him that's made me righteous what is righteous good and and and pure and and and and holy and unadulterated no flaws in it that's a righteous man Pious man they couldn't find no fault listen when he stood there that day oh my goodness they couldn't find no fault in him they could not find no fault in him because everything he was doing according to scripture and they looked at his body and said you saw you said you saw Abraham you're not a man over 50 years old and Abraham lived 2,000 years ago and you said you saw you've been with Abraham oh now we know now we know yeah you we can't find no fault of you in the word so we're going to take what you said and twist it around no let me tell you that same Spirit still alive today they can't no find no fault in you they can't find no fault in you why because it's the righteousness of God the righteousness of the Saints what are you going to do you're going to Crown them one day you're going to be red and standing there in White and the righteousness of the Saints what is it it's God's righteous God's glory is whose word is upon on you it's nothing you have ever done but it's everything he has done for you oh my it's everything he's done for you it's not anything you could ever do it's not everything I could ever do I couldn't come to church and sit on a few enough there nothing I could ever do but I had to come to an altar I had to go through a baptism I had to get a filling of the Holy Spirit I've got to go every day to an altar in my heart and ask God to apply the blood to me at every moment of my life don't you think if if brother R need it don't you think we need it also he wasn't such a such a a a man anointed by God to recognize that he needed the righteousness of God don't you think that's why he carried he said that's why he had a cross hanging from his window I don't know watch maybe we need to do two crosses because there's two different Spirits now moving across the nation but look I'm so tied to this Covenant I can't walk away I'm so tied of it it's got me so bound to it I can't walk away do you ever try to run you ever listen you got a dog and you got it chained up and you you you you'll see if now if he's new you know he he know he doesn't know where his boundaries are he doesn't know how far he can go so he'll run and all a sudden that chain will jerk him back but over time he'll learn how far he can go and you'll see the rut in the yard where he runs at The Edge Edge of that and what did Brother R says oh you want to get on that driver watch that driver he says he runs and he he goes around that up that Mountain Road and he gets so close to that cliff and he's riding so close to that edge he says oh don't he's a skilled driver brother says I want to be with a man that hugs the mountain oh I want to be with that man and what do I want to be I want to be I don't want to be at the end living on the edge of loose living might I want to be sucked in behind that Veil behind the Tabernacle in the Tabernacle of God where the very divine presence of God is the supernatural power is laying there and all God's abilities are laying there and I'm eating of that Mana that's where I want to be sitting out I don't want to be sitting out on the edge of loose living and just confess Grace Grace Grace is kep me here Grace is put me back into his presence again oh I'm my say this he says the church the real believer is looking for the manifestation of the Holy Spirit something moving in their heart moving but I believe that we're here because we've had that moving of the spirit in our heart we are the answer for the age we are the answer for the age we are the manifestation of God's covenant God said even we our cries we were just like those people in Israel we are crying out for deliverance and God sent his word down Among Us why because he knew we were in bondage to sin and we needed an Avenue to get out and the only way God could get you out of your situation is he had to send his word to you and he didn't come and beat it over your head and bind you up and B you bring you in the laws but now he's put a Grace coming over you that you don't want to to do anything to offend him I don't want to do anything to offend him I want to do everything I can to please him I know it's hard it is hard I believe you I I it's hard it's struggle it's a real struggle but don't you ever give up on God cuz God didn't give up on you if God's word cannot lie and he stands behind his word let me tell you my word will fail but if I stand behind God's word I know what I'm standing behind I know what we're standing behind we're standing behind the unfailed unadulterated word of God this is this is the manifested word of God in this age this is Eagle food that we're eating of it's not something just to Pat us over but this Covenant has come alive inside of our hearts oh I've become a captive to it I have become a captive to it oh I've sold myself out to this many many years ago and there's many times I'm just coming be honest with you there's many times I wanted to walk away I'm sure nobody else has felt that way but there's many times I just wanted to lay it down and walk away and I ask myself why why me but then God begins to send his holy spirit oh that sweet presence God begins to move down across you and you realize I can't go no more I'm so tied to this thing I'm so tied to this thing this word I'm so tied to it I become a captive to God's word oh I'm not in bonds I could I could do whatever I want to do but I don't want to do anything to offend him isn't that your desire you don't want to do anything to offend him you want to do everything to please him Jesus said when I return will I find faith when I return well I find a place where my word has took up its Abode and they have sold themselves out to it and they're relying on it oh we know that the world's God set everything in order by faith and he spoke Over You by his word and his word is sunk inside of your heart and you come today you come today by faith not knowing what was going to take place but you came by faith oh I came by faith I want to come every moment I want to come to the house of God I want to come by faith CU I know God will come and vindicate his word and he will confirm it in my life oh my let's stand to our feet this evening we're so tied of this thing we just can't run away from it but we're not living on the edge of loose living but we're staying so close to the house of God Mariam stood there you don't have no reason why why she danced on the other side CU When she stood there on that one side and when that Mighty Angel come down the East Wind and it separated that Red Sea and it dried up that land and maram was dancing on the other side let me tell you those people at the end with Pharaoh pressing in the backside all the taskmasters their desire was to take them back in bondage but when they looked in every step they saw the footprints of the of their of their family of every member of their tribe in front of them in that sand that Dusty ground that dry ground look it wasn't a wet ground dust will leave a dry Footprints when dust you walk in the dust and the sands of time you recognize it Christ footsteps that you're walking in where's it taking you
