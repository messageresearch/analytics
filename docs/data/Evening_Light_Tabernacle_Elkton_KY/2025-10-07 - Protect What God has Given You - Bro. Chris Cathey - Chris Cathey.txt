========================================

named by the name of Elijah. Aren't you glad that we had a prophet of our day and he would stand and preach the word. He would bring the word. He didn't have a whole lot of money, but he didn't care about the money. He cared about souls. And that's where you should be. Every one of us should be going, I want to get another soul into the kingdom of God. We should all, no matter who you are, preacher or not, we should all be striving in the same direction. But it seems like a lot of us will have our vineyard set up and we'll plow all day and we'll believe the message of the hour and then someone come up to you in the message. Well, then they say this and then they say that or take the prophet's word out of contents or well, we don't really need to go to church. No, when brother says when them doors are open, you Christian cannot miss a church service. I tell you why. I I believe people are hearing some other different things and this and that. And I'm here to tell you the Bible says as the days are approaching more so we should be coming to the house of God. I tell you why we should be protecting our vineyard. I'm here to tell you to tell you saints that we should protect our vineyard, our home. What God has gave you, what God your business, everything you got, give it back to God. Protect your home front.
