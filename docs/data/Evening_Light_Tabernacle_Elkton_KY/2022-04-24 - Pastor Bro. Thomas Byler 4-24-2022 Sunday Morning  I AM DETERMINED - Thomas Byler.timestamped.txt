[18:55] good morning everyone um
[18:57] i'll just ask brother brad to open us up
[19:00] in prayer
[19:12] foreign
[19:39] and with me if you will um
[19:41] kids can be dismissed to sunday school
[19:45] um
[19:49] if you have your bible turn with me to
[19:51] proverbs chapter 4.
[20:18] hear ye children and
[20:20] the instruction of the father and attend
[20:22] to no
[20:23] understanding
[20:31] for i was my father's son tender and
[20:33] only beloved
[20:35] in the sight of my mother
[20:45] get wisdom get understanding forget it
[20:48] not neither decline from the words of my
[20:51] mouth
[20:58] wisdom is the principle thing therefore
[21:01] get wisdom and with all thy
[21:04] getting get understanding
[21:13] she shall give to thine head an ornament
[21:17] of grace a crown of glory
[21:19] shall she deliver to thee
[21:28] i have taught thee in the way of wisdom
[21:31] i have led thee in right path
[21:41] take fast hold of instruction
[21:44] let her not go keep her for she is thy
[21:47] life
[21:54] avoid it pass not by it turn from it and
[21:58] pass away
[22:08] for they eat the bread of wickedness and
[22:10] drink the wine of violence
[22:20] the way of the wicked is as darkness
[22:22] they know
[22:23] not at what they stumble
[22:32] let them not depart from thine eyes keep
[22:35] them in the midst of thine heart
[22:44] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[22:46] out of it are the issues of life
[22:55] let thine eyes look right on and let
[22:57] that eyelids look straight before thee
[23:05] let's last one together
[23:07] turn not to the right hand nor to the
[23:09] left to remove thy foot from
[23:12] evil but detroit
[23:23] you may be seated
[23:24] it's a good day to be in the house of
[23:26] lord this morning
[23:28] beautiful day out
[23:30] uh i just was uh
[23:33] this was kind of
[23:35] had a little thought this week as i was
[23:37] driving down to nashville i was going uh
[23:39] and they were doing construction work
[23:40] down there
[23:42] and uh
[23:43] on the interstate and it should have
[23:44] been done started a long time ago but
[23:46] but they're uh they were i thought to
[23:49] myself which i don't see this a lot
[23:50] anymore in life as you go through things
[23:53] uh but they're they seem like they're
[23:55] doing a pretty good job they're getting
[23:56] it done
[23:57] uh they look like they're uh really
[24:01] working pretty hard but um not only that
[24:05] they have tons of equipment out there
[24:07] they uh they
[24:08] built their own
[24:10] like a temporary asphalt plant and a
[24:12] concrete plant right on the side of the
[24:13] road there so they're really moving and
[24:14] getting it done got things organized
[24:17] and it got me to thinking
[24:19] as i was driving by one of underneath
[24:21] one of the bridges there they had the
[24:23] dozers had pushed out
[24:25] looked like probably three foot maybe
[24:27] down on
[24:30] oh where the bridge pilings were and
[24:32] they had left just this little spot
[24:35] and it got me to thinking of uh how
[24:36] brother adam said it was talking about
[24:38] that bridge
[24:39] and then
[24:40] we'll go in the scripture here
[24:43] uh just got me thinking about
[24:45] foundations and things like that and
[24:47] doing things right making sure that it's
[24:49] done right
[24:50] but
[24:52] if you go with me to matthew actually
[24:54] actually luke sorry luke 6.
[25:01] just a little scripture reading here
[25:03] luke 6 and we'll start in verse 47.
[25:08] but a lot of things in life anymore
[25:10] especially in the work
[25:12] things a lot of people cut corners and
[25:14] things aren't done right but these these
[25:16] guys look like they know what they're
[25:17] doing and they like i said they they're
[25:20] they seem like they're overdoing it
[25:21] basically but it
[25:23] looks
[25:25] like they're getting it done good
[25:26] and this is jesus speaking in here in
[25:28] luke 6 47
[25:31] whosoever cometh to me and heareth my
[25:33] sayings and doith them i will show you
[25:35] to whom he is like
[25:37] he is like a man which built in house
[25:39] and dig deep and laid foundation on a
[25:42] rock
[25:44] and when the flood arose
[25:46] the stream beat vehemently upon that
[25:48] house and could not shake it for it was
[25:50] founded upon a rock
[25:52] but he that heareth and doeth not is
[25:54] like a man that without a foundation
[25:57] built a house upon the earth against
[25:59] which the streams defeat vehemently and
[26:01] immediately in the ruin of the house was
[26:03] great
[26:04] and uh
[26:07] looking at
[26:08] that scripture and then looking at how
[26:10] those those construction workers are
[26:13] doing a good job and they're uh they're
[26:15] getting things done really good
[26:17] i seen uh
[26:19] you might have seen the same picture it
[26:20] was on the internet it was
[26:22] probably a couple years ago
[26:24] when a hurricane had came through in
[26:26] florida there
[26:27] and
[26:28] and had wiped every house
[26:31] every house was knocked down except one
[26:33] house
[26:35] and i was
[26:36] listening uh to the interview that the
[26:38] guy did
[26:40] and he he was saying that they had drove
[26:42] the
[26:44] they had over built it not they didn't
[26:46] build it to code but they built it
[26:48] beyond code and uh and they took and
[26:51] drove the pilings down
[26:54] like way deep down into the earth
[26:57] and it was the only only house there
[26:59] wasn't ever every other house like a
[27:01] tornado where it grabs the house and
[27:02] leaves the other standing but this was
[27:04] the only house standing and the only
[27:06] thing that they could uh
[27:08] say that probably was the reason was
[27:10] that they overbuilt the house it was
[27:13] built much better than any other house
[27:15] it was the only one left standing
[27:18] and
[27:20] kind of like when brother branham was
[27:22] talking about that uh that bridge
[27:24] builder over in sydney australia when he
[27:26] was when nobody wanted to build this
[27:28] bridge but this builder took upon
[27:31] himself
[27:32] and said he thinks he can do it or
[27:34] actually didn't say he thinks he can do
[27:35] it he said he knows he can do it and he
[27:37] was building it better than anybody else
[27:40] ever built it and i have a
[27:45] a little uh
[27:46] where brother branham was reading that
[27:48] quo or where
[27:50] where he was talking about that
[27:53] but
[27:54] let's see
[28:00] this is in the fallible word of god
[28:03] and he said did you notice he couldn't
[28:05] die on earth this is talking about jesus
[28:06] now did you notice he couldn't die on
[28:08] earth and he couldn't die in heaven so
[28:10] he was the bridge between he died
[28:12] between heavens and earth the very best
[28:14] material that god could put he spoke
[28:16] through the prophet and said it will be
[28:18] in there he reserved the seed thy seed
[28:21] shall bruise the serpent's head and he
[28:23] did it amen he did it and the same god
[28:26] that said that promised you'd send jesus
[28:28] christ the same time the second time for
[28:31] those who wait for his coming and his in
[28:33] his and love his coming
[28:35] the same god that said that said that he
[28:36] would heal our sickness
[28:39] if we would believe him through the
[28:41] atonement that was made there in the
[28:43] middle of the river amen you believe
[28:45] that sure he was the one who paid the
[28:47] price he was the one who's done all
[28:49] these things for us the day that the
[28:51] bridge was completed talking about the
[28:52] sydney bridge now
[28:54] the people screamed and shouted all over
[28:56] the city
[28:57] and all over the country because the
[28:59] bridge was fixed and if you don't
[29:01] believe it he said they screamed and
[29:03] shouted read acts 2 when the bridge was
[29:05] completed that span man back into a
[29:07] relationship with god find out if it
[29:10] wasn't not only that but come rolling
[29:12] down the bridge some divine gifts from
[29:14] god out of heaven and anointed the
[29:15] church to preach the gospel into all
[29:17] parts of the world
[29:19] in sydney when the great final day come
[29:21] after the expansion was made everybody
[29:22] went out and they gave decorated the
[29:24] bridge with flags and so forth giving
[29:28] honor and then the great crucial moment
[29:30] come the ribbon was stretched across and
[29:32] the mayor
[29:33] was the first one to break the ribbon as
[29:35] he went across
[29:37] what's the bridge going to do without
[29:39] one speck of doubt in his mind he broke
[29:41] the ribbon because he had confidence
[29:44] in the builder and the material that
[29:45] went into it
[29:46] some of these days you got to break the
[29:48] ribbon too brother that's right that
[29:50] spans this life from
[29:53] the other
[29:54] you're walking on a brittle threads and
[29:56] you don't know what time they'll break
[29:58] that is true
[29:59] but
[30:00] when the ribbon does break i've got
[30:01] confidence in the tower and in the
[30:03] bridge that was spanned for a highway
[30:05] for us to travel from earth to glory
[30:09] and the mirror broke and after he broke
[30:10] the way hundreds of others followed them
[30:12] loads of people three or four great big
[30:14] electric trains chugged along in each
[30:16] side not a doubt in their minds on all
[30:18] behind there come tens of thousands of
[30:20] automobiles and walking pedestrians and
[30:22] all going across the bridge
[30:24] and someday
[30:26] when life is all over as we break them
[30:28] brittle threads and we see the lord
[30:29] jesus christ coming in his power and
[30:32] glory at the other side when north and
[30:34] south sydney was joined together by one
[30:36] expansion and when jesus died at calvary
[30:38] it spanned an expansion that joined god
[30:40] and man together that men are still the
[30:42] sons and daughters of god and man
[30:45] because jesus christ span the way that's
[30:47] my confidence and his word how he did it
[30:50] and when he had at that day
[30:53] and they went across the bridge the
[30:54] screams and the shouts and the bridges
[30:56] set solid there was not a weave in it at
[30:59] all because the right material had been
[31:01] put in it
[31:02] the right thing had been done the right
[31:04] precautions had been taken and if man
[31:07] how his fame was through all the world
[31:10] the papers packed it everywhere and he
[31:11] was the most famous bridge builder in
[31:13] the world at the time because he took
[31:16] precaution
[31:17] he put the best material in it he wasn't
[31:20] thinking about the price he was thinking
[31:22] about the bridge and then if a man if
[31:24] men will be so concerned for
[31:26] transportation of his fellow man to take
[31:28] such precautions as that
[31:29] how much more is god concerned about his
[31:31] own children to take precautions that
[31:33] the right thing is said so therefore
[31:35] brother our faith is anchored
[31:37] in the word of the living god and when
[31:39] jesus christ said the things that i do
[31:41] shall you do also even more than this
[31:43] for i go into my father i believe that
[31:45] to be the infallible word of god i
[31:47] believe when he said a little while and
[31:49] the world will see me no more
[31:52] yet you shall see me for i'll be with
[31:54] you till the end of the world i believe
[31:56] that's the infallible word of god and i
[31:58] believe that he promised that wherever
[32:00] two or three are gathered together he'd
[32:02] be in her midst and that's the
[32:03] infallible material of god
[32:06] that by my hopes is built in tonight and
[32:09] takes us from this earth to glory and i
[32:12] believe that to be the truth
[32:14] amen uh god bless you brother david

[42:39] his name he has given
[42:43] peace perfect peace to me it is mine yes
[42:49] mine oh blessed be his name mine for all
[42:56] [Music]
[42:59] amen are you thankful for that this
[43:01] morning
[43:02] amen and while we're standing this
[43:04] morning and
[43:05] we only have
[43:07] uh one prayer request this morning and
[43:11] we always remember our shut-in sister
[43:12] peggy
[43:13] the different ones that are not able to
[43:15] be here and
[43:16] we always want to remember them in
[43:18] prayer and
[43:19] greet those that are watching this
[43:21] morning and just pray that god will
[43:22] speak to their hearts but we have a
[43:24] prayer request this morning and
[43:26] i i've been keeping up with it some
[43:29] about trevor
[43:31] and most all of you know and
[43:33] me and brother steve was talking out
[43:35] back before service and
[43:37] this this young man has just really been
[43:39] through a lot
[43:41] that's the easiest way i know to say it
[43:43] and
[43:44] him and his mother tina they have went
[43:46] to uh
[43:47] male's clinic and they're going to start
[43:49] testing today until thursday
[43:52] and
[43:53] he just he just needs a touch from the
[43:55] lord to really
[43:56] you know help them to find out what his
[43:58] problem is and
[43:59] just pray that make sure that he's
[44:01] cancer-free and it says then the plan is
[44:03] to make him a new esophagus
[44:06] and just just really we need to keep him
[44:08] in prayer this week and just pray that
[44:11] god will just move in a special way and
[44:13] you know
[44:16] it's it's sometimes it's easy
[44:18] not to remember someone in prayer but
[44:20] you know if it was your son
[44:22] or your grandson
[44:26] you'd want everybody to pray and you'd
[44:27] really want to call out to god and i
[44:30] believe if there's ever a time that
[44:31] trevor needs a touch from the lord it's
[44:33] now
[44:34] and i i honestly
[44:36] which i don't do well with pain
[44:39] but i don't know
[44:41] how he has maintained a anytime you see
[44:43] a picture of him he's always smiling he
[44:45] has seems like a positive attitude and
[44:48] just pray that god just keep him up and
[44:50] you know
[44:52] if you've never been sick you don't know
[44:54] how people feel when they hurt all the
[44:56] time they don't feel good
[44:57] and uh
[44:59] just really need to hold them up in
[45:01] prayer and pray for sister sherry's back
[45:02] and the lord will touch her this morning
[45:04] and so i just wonder if we could all
[45:06] just
[45:07] take a minute and just pour our hearts
[45:09] out to the lord for
[45:11] trevor this morning so let's just pray
[45:12] together if we could
[45:27] only believe because all things

[1:09:13] every few months maybe every other month
[1:09:15] or something like that but all i all i
[1:09:18] ask is that when we do it everybody

[1:09:23] to sacrifice something you know
[1:09:25] uh it's to try to be there you know so
[1:09:27] that not just a few of us are there but
[1:09:30] you know
[1:09:30] we want everybody that possibly can be
[1:09:33] to be there amen
[1:09:35] because that's what it's all about amen
[1:09:36] fellowship with one another
[1:09:39] amen and i really think that's wonderful
[1:09:41] i certainly enjoy it
[1:09:43] amen and so

[1:09:46] in prayer
[1:09:48] father we just come before you this
[1:09:50] morning lord once again lord jesus
[1:09:52] thankful to be one day closer to home
[1:09:55] one day closer to seeing father what
[1:09:57] heaven is really all about lord and lord
[1:10:00] as we gather together in your precious
[1:10:02] name this morning we would just ask god
[1:10:04] that you'll come
[1:10:05] and that you'll speak to us along the
[1:10:07] way father for you are the same
[1:10:08] yesterday today and forever and lord we
[1:10:11] know that you're not in your corporal
[1:10:12] body anymore but you're in your bride
[1:10:15] body now lord jesus and you're still
[1:10:17] speaking to us along the way
[1:10:20] through the form of the holy spirit in
[1:10:21] your people
[1:10:22] and we just ask god that you'll just be
[1:10:24] with us and bless the service this
[1:10:26] morning and
[1:10:27] ministering of the word that which we
[1:10:28] feel lord you've laid upon our heart to
[1:10:30] minister we ask god that you just speak
[1:10:33] to us and help me just to get out of the
[1:10:34] way lord and bless everybody that has
[1:10:37] come lord jesus that we might all go out
[1:10:39] those double doors better than what we
[1:10:41] came
[1:10:42] we ask these blessings and favors in
[1:10:44] jesus christ's name
[1:10:45] amen and amen
[1:10:48] train your bibles if you will
[1:10:50] amen just a little thought
[1:10:52] amen i felt
[1:10:54] like the lord laid
[1:10:55] it's the same
[1:10:57] amen uh same gospel same message amen
[1:11:02] maybe just a little bit different angle
[1:11:04] amen
[1:11:07] so in first corinthians two if you will
[1:11:10] first corinthians 2.
[1:11:20] and i brethren when i came to you came
[1:11:22] not with excellency of speech or of
[1:11:24] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[1:11:26] of god
[1:11:28] for i determined not to know anything
[1:11:31] among you save jesus christ
[1:11:33] and him crucified and i was with you in
[1:11:36] weakness and in fear and much trembling
[1:11:38] and my speech in my preaching was not
[1:11:40] with enticing words of man's wisdom but
[1:11:42] in demonstration of the spirit and of
[1:11:45] power that your faith should not stand
[1:11:47] in the wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:11:50] god
[1:11:51] i want to take a little thought here out
[1:11:53] of verse 2 the first three verse for i
[1:11:55] determined
[1:11:56] amen and this morning i wanted to just
[1:11:58] title this
[1:11:59] i am determined amen
[1:12:02] i am determined praise the lord god
[1:12:05] bless you you can be seated this morning
[1:12:08] amen now we know that paul here paul
[1:12:11] we know
[1:12:12] how zealous that he was
[1:12:14] in that right
[1:12:16] and how determined paul was even before
[1:12:18] his conversion
[1:12:20] is that right to stop this movement that
[1:12:24] was going on of everybody
[1:12:27] following jesus amen and he was very
[1:12:29] determined he was i guess one of the
[1:12:32] most
[1:12:33] zealous people
[1:12:35] out of all the
[1:12:36] sanhedrin to make an effort to persecute
[1:12:40] the church of the living god
[1:12:43] he knows he was very zealous
[1:12:45] very determined man
[1:12:49] paul had a vision you know he had a he
[1:12:52] he had something in his mind he was a
[1:12:54] determined person and he had and god
[1:12:56] seen that and of course we know uh god
[1:13:00] chose paul amen to turn him around and
[1:13:04] to turn his seal because talk paul
[1:13:06] talked about zeal and how when as
[1:13:09] touching sealed even persecuting the
[1:13:11] church and so forth and
[1:13:13] and so forth but you know god turned
[1:13:15] that zeal around
[1:13:17] amen and now paul became very zealous
[1:13:21] and very determined amen in the way of
[1:13:24] the word amen and and serving god
[1:13:27] amen you know i want to first talk about
[1:13:30] this word determined for just a few
[1:13:32] minutes
[1:13:33] and
[1:13:35] to me
[1:13:36] this
[1:13:37] determined means to be set
[1:13:40] all right
[1:13:41] it's to be said
[1:13:43] and in job god uses this word
[1:13:48] in chapter 14 when he talks about man
[1:13:50] that is born of a woman many times we
[1:13:52] use this scripture at a funeral
[1:13:55] amen a man that is born of a woman being
[1:13:57] a few days and full of trouble comes
[1:13:59] down and forth comes forth like a flower
[1:14:02] is cut down and so forth
[1:14:04] and it says in verse 4 who can bring a
[1:14:06] clean thing out of a unclean not one
[1:14:09] seeing that his days are
[1:14:12] determined
[1:14:15] you see his days are set
[1:14:18] amen the number of his months are with
[1:14:21] thee thou has appointed his bounds that
[1:14:23] he cannot pass
[1:14:26] praise the lord amen also
[1:14:30] i asked siri to tell me what that was
[1:14:32] all about
[1:14:33] and just what the meaning of it was
[1:14:37] the dictionary to
[1:14:38] be determined means
[1:14:40] to have made a firm decision
[1:14:44] and being resolved
[1:14:46] not to change it
[1:14:50] what brought me to the thought was
[1:14:53] uh
[1:14:54] speaking of and i was just thinking
[1:14:56] about how to here we're at the end
[1:14:59] and we're here at the finality of it all
[1:15:04] and
[1:15:05] you know it is truly going to be it's
[1:15:08] going to take
[1:15:09] determination
[1:15:12] how many believes this is an hour when
[1:15:14] you've got to be determined you have to
[1:15:20] have me
[1:15:22] the die has to be cast
[1:15:24] the choice has to be made
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:28] and let me tell you something how many
[1:15:30] knows when somebody
[1:15:32] is determined it's very hard to stop a
[1:15:35] determined person
[1:15:38] no matter who it is
[1:15:40] no matter what it is
[1:15:43] and we know that satan how many knows
[1:15:45] that he
[1:15:46] is determined
[1:15:50] in first peter 5 and 8-9
[1:15:54] it says it this way he says
[1:15:56] be sober be vigilant because your
[1:15:59] adversary the devil
[1:16:02] as a roaring lion
[1:16:05] sits on the couch and leaves you alone
[1:16:11] no no he is determined
[1:16:14] many times when i look this up but obama
[1:16:16] says you know
[1:16:17] he was praying for people who are going
[1:16:19] to die if god didn't
[1:16:21] do something he says satan is determined
[1:16:25] to take your life prematurely
[1:16:28] he's determined to take your life
[1:16:30] i mean no the devil is a determined
[1:16:32] person
[1:16:35] amen
[1:16:37] it's to have a fixed goal
[1:16:40] an ambition
[1:16:42] something that you're set on
[1:16:46] and if you and i are going to make it
[1:16:48] it's going to be it's going to take
[1:16:50] determination there's another word the
[1:16:52] prophet uh uh used and it was called
[1:16:55] perseverance
[1:16:59] perseverance or determination or
[1:17:02] desperation
[1:17:06] amen
[1:17:07] and there's only really one thing that
[1:17:09] brings uh determination and that is
[1:17:12] faith
[1:17:13] amen because you can't be determined
[1:17:15] without faith
[1:17:17] now let me say one thing about
[1:17:18] determination that you got to be careful
[1:17:20] about because
[1:17:22] i
[1:17:24] have seen people
[1:17:26] i've seen people who were really really
[1:17:29] really determined
[1:17:33] uh christians
[1:17:35] so called
[1:17:36] and you've got to be careful and
[1:17:38] make sure that what you're determined in
[1:17:40] is the right thing
[1:17:43] because you can be determined in the
[1:17:45] wrong thing
[1:17:46] and it isn't going to do you any good
[1:17:50] so you got to make sure that you're in
[1:17:51] the will of god
[1:17:54] amen
[1:17:57] how many knows yeah when it comes to you
[1:17:59] think about in on the world scope of
[1:18:01] things you and
[1:18:03] so forth and how many knows that like
[1:18:05] hitler had determination
[1:18:09] he was very determined
[1:18:11] and the japanese from what i understand
[1:18:13] before we defeated them i'm told that
[1:18:15] they had never been defeated
[1:18:18] they didn't know how to say i surrender
[1:18:20] that's why it took him so long
[1:18:23] hiroshima nakasaki we about had to drop
[1:18:26] a bomb on their capitol before they said
[1:18:28] all right all right enough is enough
[1:18:31] huh
[1:18:33] but they were so determined they'd have
[1:18:34] kamikaze and it's hard to fight
[1:18:37] somebody's gonna ram his airplane right
[1:18:39] into your ship and ah
[1:18:43] they were determined they were set
[1:18:45] everywhere you fought them it was fight
[1:18:47] to death they were so determined they
[1:18:49] were going to fight to the last person
[1:18:51] they were beginning their little girl
[1:18:53] their little boys at home and everybody
[1:18:55] to fight and how to fight and how to
[1:18:56] shoot and they were gonna fight us with
[1:18:58] everything they got all the way to the
[1:18:59] end
[1:19:01] they were the charmers
[1:19:06] but do you know what this is what i love
[1:19:09] i love this that no matter how
[1:19:12] bad
[1:19:13] the devil is determined
[1:19:16] amen the believer there's only one way
[1:19:19] that you'll overcome people like the
[1:19:21] jabs or hillary that is that you've got
[1:19:22] to be more determined
[1:19:29] because they found out that yeah they
[1:19:30] were kamikaze yeah we were a little
[1:19:32] kamikaze ourself we were determined they
[1:19:35] were going to be stopped
[1:19:37] same way with him we were determined
[1:19:40] and it was for a good cause it was for
[1:19:41] the right cause i mean that's a good
[1:19:44] cause to be determined about
[1:19:46] the right cause
[1:19:50] i believe it brother bam says you know
[1:19:51] he read it off of somebody else who got
[1:19:53] some something he says find the right
[1:19:56] cause find a good purpose and then give
[1:19:58] yourself to it i mean that's what we've
[1:20:00] done you found the right cause
[1:20:03] and it's the cause of christ
[1:20:08] amen you've got to be determined
[1:20:10] god loves people
[1:20:13] that are determined
[1:20:18] after you become a christian remember
[1:20:19] this
[1:20:20] god sends trials he allows temptations
[1:20:23] and
[1:20:24] trials to come your way
[1:20:27] to try you right because why because he
[1:20:29] wants to see how determined you really
[1:20:31] are
[1:20:32] because that's what god is looking for
[1:20:35] he's looking for people who are
[1:20:36] determined just like that woman that he
[1:20:39] says you know it's not me to give the
[1:20:40] children's bread to dogs
[1:20:44] huh discouraging her calling her a dog
[1:20:47] most people would have got an attitude
[1:20:49] and wouldn't even talk to her
[1:20:54] but he let the preacher not talk to you
[1:20:55] when you talk to him and you walk away
[1:20:57] can you imagine
[1:20:58] i never gone to that church again
[1:21:01] huh
[1:21:03] but listen he didn't even talk to her
[1:21:06] and he kept she kept following she kept
[1:21:09] following
[1:21:10] huh
[1:21:12] oh my god got into another conversation
[1:21:15] and so forth and she says one thing she
[1:21:17] says you know that's true lord it's true
[1:21:21] you know that it's not me to give the
[1:21:23] children breath to the dogs but
[1:21:25] even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall
[1:21:29] from the master table
[1:21:31] he's seen her determination and he said
[1:21:34] be it unto you as dies belief
[1:21:40] we're living in a world folks that's
[1:21:42] soft
[1:21:44] the opposite of determination i've got a
[1:21:46] bunch of things wrote down here
[1:21:48] you know it's
[1:21:50] undetermined is to be easily stopped
[1:21:52] it's to be undecided
[1:21:55] it's to be wishy-washy
[1:21:58] it's to be a jellyfish i know the
[1:22:00] jellyfish doesn't have any backbone
[1:22:04] it's to be wishy-washy
[1:22:07] it's to be on set not knowing where
[1:22:09] you're really going
[1:22:13] how many please we gotta go
[1:22:16] we're set
[1:22:18] we're determined
[1:22:20] one place the bible says since the time
[1:22:21] of john the
[1:22:23] the kingdom of god suffers violence and
[1:22:25] the violence take it by followers
[1:22:28] in other words you got to go get it
[1:22:32] [Music]
[1:22:34] oh god's commissioned to moses moses
[1:22:36] god's commissioned the moses to reap
[1:22:38] that sometimes
[1:22:39] talks about how that you know that
[1:22:40] you've got to go and possess it
[1:22:43] he's giving you the land but they still
[1:22:45] got to go possess it
[1:22:47] that's the way we are this morning
[1:22:50] amen
[1:22:54] you got to be determined to be set
[1:22:57] the decision has to be made
[1:23:00] once the decision is made
[1:23:02] amen then you can go forward
[1:23:05] we live in an age of softness
[1:23:09] people are just so soft
[1:23:12] they can't take anything
[1:23:14] remember brother bam talking about he
[1:23:15] says you know the boxers and so forth
[1:23:18] physically speaking he talked about the
[1:23:20] boxers not being able to take a a punch
[1:23:22] with a big old featherbed on their on
[1:23:24] their on their fists and so forth and he
[1:23:27] talks about the hybrid food that's right
[1:23:29] that big mac at mcdonald's
[1:23:32] that ain't no good for you it's hybrid
[1:23:34] it'll make you want to go home and go to
[1:23:36] bed
[1:23:38] huh
[1:23:40] the food not a
[1:23:41] crazy
[1:23:42] it's a hybrid food and he says it's
[1:23:45] bound to affect the brains
[1:23:50] now folks a lot of folks have a lot of
[1:23:52] philosophy out about homosexuals and how
[1:23:54] well it's in your genetics
[1:23:56] probably god tied it to even the hybrid
[1:23:58] food has caused them not to be able to
[1:23:59] have the right
[1:24:00] mind huh
[1:24:02] he said they're getting off in their
[1:24:04] mind because of even the food
[1:24:06] huh anything i believe to profit over
[1:24:08] any kind of science
[1:24:11] but what is it make yourself the day of
[1:24:14] you know being rugged
[1:24:17] people who believed in something stood
[1:24:19] for something
[1:24:21] had a purpose
[1:24:23] oh my
[1:24:26] let me just say this brother said in
[1:24:28] god's commission to moses he said
[1:24:29] talking about moses and how that he's
[1:24:31] seen this sign you know over this
[1:24:33] stadium first of all he says you know

[1:24:38] fight

[1:24:43] i thought
[1:24:45] that's good it's what's down in here
[1:24:50] oh anything i hate to see is a spineless
[1:24:53] person who calls themselves a christian
[1:24:56] oh my god want some
[1:24:59] i'd eat with grit and backbone
[1:25:06] like old buddy robin said lord give me
[1:25:09] backbone the size of a saw log but
[1:25:11] plenty of knowledge in the gable end of
[1:25:13] my soul let me fight the devil as long
[1:25:16] as i got one tooth and then come him
[1:25:18] till i die

[1:28:44] many philistines come upon thousands
[1:28:46] come upon him

[1:28:53] because they can pounce on him at the
[1:28:55] very same time and he can't do nothing
[1:28:59] but that was samson when they had him

[1:29:52] good old head pump handler and jack how

[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:18] how many would like to hear how jesus
[1:30:20] said what he wants
[1:30:22] how he feels about determination
[1:30:26] turn with me if you will let's go look
[1:30:28] in luke the 14th chapter
[1:30:34] remember determine now i just want to
[1:30:36] read before i read that let me finish
[1:30:38] some of the
[1:30:39] definitions in the verb point of
[1:30:42] determine determine
[1:30:43] it says
[1:30:44] one place he says cause
[1:30:47] to something to occur
[1:30:49] in a particular way
[1:30:51] be decisive
[1:30:53] be the decisive factor in it
[1:30:55] number three is to be
[1:30:58] firmly
[1:30:59] beside
[1:31:00] it firmly
[1:31:03] decided
[1:31:05] amen
[1:31:06] now notice jesus kind of begin to
[1:31:08] describe to us
[1:31:10] what kind of character because this has
[1:31:12] to do with our character how many knows
[1:31:13] that
[1:31:14] it has to do with what character and
[1:31:16] that's what god's looking for is
[1:31:17] character
[1:31:19] what kind of character are you
[1:31:28] chapter 14 of luke verse 28 for which of
[1:31:31] you well wait a minute let me go back a
[1:31:33] bit
[1:31:35] let's go start with 25.
[1:31:37] there were not a great multitude with
[1:31:39] him and he turned and he said unto them
[1:31:41] if a man come to me
[1:31:43] and his father mother wife children
[1:31:46] brethren sister and yay and his own life
[1:31:49] also he cannot be my disciple
[1:31:54] you talk about listening to jesus on the
[1:31:57] shores of galilee and you talk about a
[1:32:00] man that goes just a little bit extreme
[1:32:03] [Music]
[1:32:05] what
[1:32:07] can you imagine how many said what
[1:32:09] hey this mama daddy brothers sisters and
[1:32:12] his wife in his own life also in other
[1:32:14] words you've got to be determined
[1:32:18] you got to be sad
[1:32:20] that it's him i'm going to follow
[1:32:23] now follow my mind i'm hauling my
[1:32:24] brother and i like the song says if my
[1:32:26] brother don't go don't hinder me mama
[1:32:28] don't god don't hinder me i said don't
[1:32:30] go don't let it dope stop me i'm going
[1:32:34] that's what christ is looking for
[1:32:37] you care about
[1:32:38] people oh and aren't you glad we're
[1:32:41] gonna need it because those saints of
[1:32:43] all the ages they're gonna ask us how in
[1:32:46] the world did you make it
[1:32:54] huh
[1:32:55] let me tell you something
[1:32:57] i believe i'm looking at a miracle right
[1:32:59] here
[1:33:00] it's a miracle
[1:33:03] many fall by the wayside
[1:33:06] uh many have gone out maybe followed by
[1:33:08] the wayside and god the devil would have
[1:33:10] his way you wouldn't be sitting in your
[1:33:12] seat this morning
[1:33:16] how many knows if you're going to
[1:33:17] overcome the first you're going to have
[1:33:19] to be determined to overcome the flesh
[1:33:23] because if you aren't determined to
[1:33:24] overcome the flesh and you allow the
[1:33:26] flesh to have its way

[1:33:36] flesh pulls us the wrong way you let the
[1:33:38] flesh have its way you let it do what it

[1:34:43] ghost is all about amen the bible says
[1:34:45] that our flesh is become subject to the
[1:34:47] spirit
[1:34:49] amen

[1:34:56] desires of the flesh they want
[1:34:59] all the lust of the eye you want
[1:35:04] listen

[1:35:29] that's the on probably the most valuable
[1:35:31] thing we've done sing a special do
[1:35:33] something for christ

[1:35:39] what we do for christ

[1:35:44] lord help us because it's all going to
[1:35:45] be over with one of these things and we
[1:35:48] are determined we've set up our minds

[1:36:18] remain shall not prevent them but we're
[1:36:20] gonna meet the lord in the air we'll be
[1:36:22] changed paul said in the moment in the
[1:36:24] twinkling of an eye
[1:36:26] it ought to be our highest goal god help
[1:36:28] me to be ready for that

[1:38:16] jews and we're going to be lifted up the

[1:45:30] having to
[1:45:31] be determined
[1:45:33] he talked about a race that we all
[1:45:35] running right
[1:45:37] but there's only one that gets surprised
[1:45:40] huh
[1:45:41] and so he was believing that he was at
[1:45:43] one that he was running a race somebody

[1:45:47] huh
[1:45:48] the greater your hair
[1:45:50] the closer you are to the end of the
[1:45:52] race you only get to run this race once
[1:45:55] huh
[1:45:59] and paul at the end of it
[1:46:01] he says now i am now ready to be offered
[1:46:04] and the time of my departure is at hand
[1:46:07] i fought a good fight
[1:46:12] as i say these things i want you to
[1:46:14] think about yourself
[1:46:16] i want us all to think about ourself
[1:46:21] because this should be the desire that
[1:46:24] each and every one of us has
[1:46:26] at the end of our race to be able to say
[1:46:29] this
[1:46:30] at the end of our fight to be able to
[1:46:32] say i fought a good fight
[1:46:36] huh
[1:46:37] i fought
[1:46:38] a good fight i've finished my course
[1:46:42] i've kept the faith
[1:46:48] he wasn't unsure
[1:46:49] about his status
[1:46:52] huh
[1:46:55] brother
[1:46:58] who was it that read that
[1:47:00] was it brother troy yeah brother troy
[1:47:02] mentioned that about a wise man building
[1:47:05] his house upon a rock foolish man that
[1:47:07] built upon the sand
[1:47:09] huh
[1:47:10] you know a foolish man he's a christian
[1:47:12] by his mind and so forth and he thinks
[1:47:14] he's right
[1:47:16] huh
[1:47:17] but yet he doesn't do what god says do
[1:47:20] tell me when you come to the end your
[1:47:22] house is going to crash down
[1:47:24] you're going to be disappointed
[1:47:27] is he that does what
[1:47:30] god said do that doesn't have to be
[1:47:33] a worry about anything there's no
[1:47:36] question there
[1:47:37] only those who hear
[1:47:39] these things of mine but don't do them
[1:47:42] that is the one that's going to be
[1:47:43] disappointed
[1:47:45] let's be found the one to do with them
[1:47:47] build your house upon the rock this
[1:47:49] morning so that you can say like oh i
[1:47:51] have finished my court i have run my
[1:47:53] race henceforth there is laid for up for
[1:47:56] me a crowd of righteousness
[1:48:00] oh my that's what we all want to be able
[1:48:02] to say am i right
[1:48:04] which the lord the righteous judge shall
[1:48:06] give me at that day
[1:48:08] [Music]
[1:48:10] i cannot write your name in it
[1:48:12] he says he's going to give it to me
[1:48:15] oh but he doesn't stop there
[1:48:18] paul
[1:48:20] we love you
[1:48:21] because he says this and not me only
[1:48:25] not me only but unto all them also that
[1:48:30] love his appearing
[1:48:33] in other words if you're in this
[1:48:34] condition also you're going to be in
[1:48:36] good shape also
[1:48:38] there'll be a crown of righteousness for
[1:48:40] you also
[1:48:42] praise the lord
[1:48:45] oh my
[1:48:50] finish
[1:48:51] but the lord said here
[1:48:54] which of you
[1:48:56] luke
[1:48:57] 14 28
[1:48:59] wait wait wait here i go again a page
[1:49:02] too much
[1:49:05] he cannot have children brother and
[1:49:06] sister
[1:49:07] in his own life also
[1:49:10] amen
[1:49:12] oh my how many of those that last part
[1:49:14] is really really important
[1:49:17] because
[1:49:18] other places jesus said many places you
[1:49:20] know if you don't up your cross
[1:49:22] and follow me you cannot be my disciples
[1:49:24] and if you don't hate your own life also
[1:49:27] you cannot be my disciples you can't
[1:49:29] have your own way
[1:49:32] you can't do your own thing
[1:49:36] no
[1:49:38] and conjunction whosoever does not bear
[1:49:41] his cross and come after me cannot beat
[1:49:43] my disciples now here's another one
[1:49:45] verse 28 for which of you for which of
[1:49:48] you intending to build a tower sit is
[1:49:51] not down first and counts the cost
[1:49:55] whether you have sufficiency to finish
[1:49:57] it or not
[1:50:00] praise the lord how many of us whenever
[1:50:02] you decide you're going to follow jesus
[1:50:06] it's not just about starting it's about
[1:50:08] finishing that's what it's about for us
[1:50:11] that evening i tabernacle it's not who
[1:50:13] starts it's who finishes
[1:50:17] who's gonna finish it
[1:50:20] who's gonna finish it
[1:50:22] i'm gonna finish it i trust you could
[1:50:24] say i'm gonna finish it
[1:50:27] how are you gonna do it
[1:50:30] by his strength
[1:50:32] by his help
[1:50:34] because that's the only way you're ever
[1:50:35] gonna do it is through jesus christ
[1:50:41] the only thing that's going to give you
[1:50:42] determination
[1:50:45] is christ
[1:50:46] it's faith
[1:50:48] it's the holy ghost
[1:50:49] if truly you are elected in this hour
[1:50:52] god is
[1:50:53] going to put that determination in you
[1:50:58] because the bible says he that hath
[1:50:59] begun a good work in you
[1:51:01] will perform it
[1:51:03] he's going to give you what you have
[1:51:04] need of to make it
[1:51:10] how can you stay in your seats i can
[1:51:12] barely stay up here on the platform
[1:51:14] to think that he puts that in you
[1:51:17] and if that's in you that means you're
[1:51:18] gonna make it
[1:51:26] oh my aren't you happy for that
[1:51:29] you're determined
[1:51:31] you're perseverant
[1:51:35] you're desperate
[1:51:38] you will not be denied
[1:51:42] brother baum says you know that woman in
[1:51:44] mexico
[1:51:45] that had that dead baby announced the
[1:51:47] day before
[1:51:48] he said all 100 deacons couldn't stop
[1:51:51] her
[1:51:51] she would take that little baby and
[1:51:53] crawl between the deacon's legs
[1:51:55] she'd try to get over the top of them
[1:51:57] and she'd push her way through
[1:51:59] she was gonna get to the man of god
[1:52:06] god so loved that let me tell you
[1:52:07] something that baby rose from the dead
[1:52:11] that's what it takes if you want to rise
[1:52:13] from the dead and you've got to be
[1:52:15] determined
[1:52:17] if you want more the holy ghost you've
[1:52:19] got to be retirement
[1:52:21] if you want to be closer to christ
[1:52:22] you've got to be determined
[1:52:26] [Music]
[1:52:30] you want more joy
[1:52:32] you better get determined you want to be
[1:52:35] happier you want to be better get
[1:52:37] determined you want to be a better
[1:52:38] witness get determined
[1:52:43] that's what it takes

[1:54:32] let me just say it
[1:54:34] i've got several projects
[1:54:37] even the finishing of our home called
[1:54:38] finished
[1:54:41] but out in the barn
[1:54:43] there's still the middle roll screws
[1:54:45] that need to be put on there's a lower
[1:54:47] row or screws that need to be put on
[1:54:49] because i just want to get the metal on
[1:54:54] right
[1:54:55] yeah my house it's still got some stain
[1:54:58] and some varnishing that you need to be
[1:55:00] doing but i was tired of sleeping in the
[1:55:01] loft i wanted to get it done you did
[1:55:05] there's a whole lot of little things
[1:55:07] that need to be done
[1:55:08] the little finish work
[1:55:11] huh
[1:55:12] to get the job done because i want the
[1:55:14] job done i'm bad at leaving a little bit
[1:55:16] too much undone
[1:55:19] i'm a carpenter carpenter's house never
[1:55:21] done
[1:55:24] but you know i want to go back i'm gonna
[1:55:25] have to go back and put the throws and
[1:55:26] screws in and make sure that i'll hold
[1:55:28] through this head or the other and i
[1:55:29] felt like that's the way it is in our
[1:55:31] hearts and our lives this morning sure
[1:55:33] the big works on salvation we got the
[1:55:35] holy ghost we got this but there's some
[1:55:36] still some little details in our life
[1:55:39] that need to be taken care of
[1:55:42] we're not quite finished yet
[1:55:48] and it's time to get finished
[1:55:52] it's time to be ready
[1:55:57] how in the world did it go so long how
[1:56:00] are we still here
[1:56:02] here
[1:56:05] he thought it'd be over in 77 here or in
[1:56:07] 2022
[1:56:10] i'm sure he would be voicing the same
[1:56:12] thing
[1:56:14] how long can it go
[1:56:26] one of these days
[1:56:28] people won't feel the holy ghost anymore
[1:56:31] they won't feel the holy ghost anymore
[1:56:34] why
[1:56:36] they'll have churchianity they'll still
[1:56:37] have formalism
[1:56:39] but the holy ghost will be gone
[1:56:42] let me know only he who now let us let
[1:56:45] until he be taken out of the way
[1:56:47] he's gone
[1:56:49] people still go to church
[1:56:51] and it's scary to think
[1:56:54] how many message people may be left here
[1:56:57] huh that don't feel nothing
[1:57:02] they're not going to miss the holy ghost
[1:57:03] they didn't have in the first place
[1:57:05] or maybe they didn't or they had it and
[1:57:07] it's gone
[1:57:09] but i'm telling you now
[1:57:11] lord help us this morning
[1:57:13] i want to be ready for that time i don't
[1:57:15] want to be left behind
[1:57:16] i want to go in the rapture and i
[1:57:18] somehow believe in my heart my life that
[1:57:20] i'll see that rapture
[1:57:22] amen
[1:57:24] but time is short
[1:57:29] whether he has deficiency so jesus here
[1:57:32] he's talking about look if you're going
[1:57:33] to start something be determined to
[1:57:36] finish it
[1:57:37] amen
[1:57:42] at least happily after he has laid the
[1:57:44] foundation and is not able to finish it
[1:57:46] there that behold it begin to mock him
[1:57:49] ah
[1:57:50] he said he was a christian but look
[1:57:52] where
[1:57:53] he is now
[1:57:55] he wasn't really a finish he really
[1:57:57] didn't have it he said he had it
[1:58:00] but he really didn't have it
[1:58:03] amen
[1:58:06] saying this man began to build and was
[1:58:08] not able to finish it
[1:58:09] or what king going to war against
[1:58:11] another king said if not down first and
[1:58:13] consultants whether he be able with ten
[1:58:15] thousand
[1:58:16] to meet him that cometh against him with
[1:58:18] twenty thousand
[1:58:22] god don't want you to be stupid
[1:58:27] he wants you to think this thing through
[1:58:31] and i say he wants you to win
[1:58:34] not lose
[1:58:37] he wants you to get the job done
[1:58:40] he wants you to win the war
[1:58:45] that's right
[1:58:48] amen or else
[1:58:52] while he is a great way off he sendeth
[1:58:54] an ambassador and desireth conditions of
[1:58:56] peace
[1:58:58] huh ain't no way
[1:59:00] you can win this war
[1:59:03] he says look best thing to do is make
[1:59:05] peace
[1:59:06] smart
[1:59:07] otherwise whosoever he be of you
[1:59:11] that forsaketh not all that he hath he
[1:59:14] cannot be my disciple
[1:59:19] my question this morning is have we
[1:59:21] truly forsaken all
[1:59:23] i feel some things in there that you
[1:59:26] haven't forsaken
[1:59:28] isn't that a good question
[1:59:30] that's a good question for all of us
[1:59:33] because if you're really going to be his
[1:59:35] disciple if you're going to follow him
[1:59:37] you're going to go with him to the
[1:59:39] garden if you're going to make it
[1:59:40] through the trials make it through the
[1:59:42] tests huh
[1:59:45] so determined
[1:59:50] that you're going to go all the way with
[1:59:51] him
[1:59:53] you're going to have to first fall
[1:59:54] you're going to have to find those
[1:59:55] little areas in your life that are not
[1:59:57] surrendered to god and surrender them to
[1:59:59] god
[2:00:00] huh
[2:00:02] build it right
[2:00:04] start it right
[2:00:07] amen
[2:00:11] that's right
[2:00:12] he cannot be my disciples
[2:00:16] we want our testimony to be that
[2:00:21] people nowadays are going by the way
[2:00:24] of least resistance
[2:00:27] amen the bible says that the devil is as
[2:00:29] a roaring lion going about
[2:00:32] seeking whom he may devour
[2:00:35] isn't that right
[2:00:38] let me see here
[2:00:41] james i believe it is
[2:00:43] james 4 7.
[2:00:59] all right
[2:01:02] verse 5 do you do you think that the
[2:01:04] scripture saith and made a spirit that
[2:01:06] dwelleth in us lust us to envy but he
[2:01:08] giveth more grace wherefore he saith god
[2:01:10] resists the proud and gives grace unto
[2:01:12] the humble submit yourselves therefore
[2:01:14] to god
[2:01:15] resist the devil and he will flee from
[2:01:19] you
[2:01:20] draw
[2:01:22] almighty god
[2:01:24] and he will go by to you
[2:01:27] how many believe god is waiting on you
[2:01:30] he has got everything done that can be
[2:01:32] done
[2:01:33] now it's up to you and i
[2:01:35] and god gives us something he gives them
[2:01:37] some
[2:01:39] he gives us that perseverance
[2:01:41] that determination
[2:01:43] to go out there and reach out there and
[2:01:45] take what the devil has taken from you
[2:01:48] amen to resist people don't like to
[2:01:50] resist
[2:01:51] people just go along with whatever
[2:01:54] huh
[2:01:55] there's no resistance
[2:01:58] oh you got to resist your fleshly
[2:02:00] desires you got to resist the devil
[2:02:03] and he says he'll flee from you
[2:02:06] you know what people are all paying it
[2:02:07] up
[2:02:09] like they do they got no resistance
[2:02:15] no
[2:02:16] resistance that's why the world looks
[2:02:18] like it does

[2:02:21] women going out there wearing their
[2:02:22] tights right that's what you wear under

[2:03:04] don't you get so low that you got to put
[2:03:06] somebody else down to try to lift
[2:03:08] yourself up
[2:03:09] because when you do remember when you
[2:03:11] start putting somebody else down that's
[2:03:13] all you're doing is trying to lift
[2:03:14] yourself up
[2:03:17] amen

[2:09:29] gifts operating in the church and all of
[2:09:31] this it'd be all wonderful
[2:09:33] but what would he rather have
[2:09:35] if he had to choose

[2:11:02] if the prophet god says somehow you
[2:11:03] don't answer don't answer them that's
[2:11:04] when you got to know that he's god you
[2:11:06] got to be determined
[2:11:09] and that's what he loves god loves for
[2:11:11] somebody that won't give up

[2:11:16] where our mind is set our goal is set
[2:11:18] our mind is made up we're not gonna bow
[2:11:22] god says i like them guys they're
