i'm glad to hear it amen god bless you that'll be all for the music thank you all amen praise the lord amen hey man so we greet everybody tonight both here amen and out there on the what will you call the airwaves the web waves or something like that some kind of waves out there but amen i trust god is with you and blessing you as good as what he is me amen amen so god is good amen how many really appreciates the lord jesus christ tonight amen so just once again just meditating and praying what the lord would perhaps have us to speak hoping that he would help us to have a a timely message and something that would perhaps meet the challenge for the hour amen amen certainly enjoyed sunday morning didn't you so amen enjoyed that that was very good amen appreciate but thaddeus dedication to the lord his sincerity amen as lords can certainly use him and so we appreciate him amen amen let's just bow our heads tonight before we go to the word kind heavenly father we come before you lord once again thankful to be assembled together in your house lord all in one place and one accord father we realize lord anything could happen and father we're so grateful lord jesus most of all for your abiding presence your holy spirit that is with us lord and even in us to the end of the world we just pray father that once again that you would bless our metering together our gatherings together lord and that you would meet in the midst of us lord jesus as you have promised that you would father we ask god that as we open the bible lord jesus we ask god that you give us the inspiration and the minister of what you once said tonight and father meet the needs of the people lord jesus we do pray for each and every one lord that has already been mentioned father in the hospitals and different places lord that has the coronavirus lord we just pray god that you'll take it off of them and that they'll recover lord jesus 100 father we love you and we appreciate your protection god tonight lord in your healing power and all that you are to us and free just glorify your name and praise you for what you are and what you mean to us tonight we ask these blessings and favors in the name of the lord jesus christ amen turn your bibles if you will to the book of acts amen the book of acts the 16th chapter acts 16. and verse 25 and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's bands were loosed and the keeper of the prison awakening out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm we are all here. then he called for a light and sprang it and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated tonight amen tonight i want to talk about being privileged privileged amen being privileged amen so that's what we want to focus on and i really kind of had a hard time figuring out just which way what i wanted to uh title this you know but that's about the best that i could come up with amen talk about having an attitude of gratitude amen i believe in this hour that we're living in and we know that gross darkness is upon the earth amen how many believes that we're living in a world of darkness and i thought about this scripture here when i begin to have this message kind of come to me about paul and silas about midnight you know and we know that uh we're living also in a midnight hour i mean he knows that but bam said when he was here i guess back in the 50s or 40s or whatever way back then talked about how that science has said that we're like three minutes to midnight amen and so you know we're in a very very dark hour amen and i got to thinking about that darkness and how much darkness that we really have around us and paul here of course we know we use this as an illustration many different messages and things could be brought from this just from what we have read whether it was the plan of salvation amen about what must i do to be saved amen the simplicity of salvation comes out of this little scripture that we read amen believe on the lord jesus christ you know not join church and do this that or the other simply believe on the lord jesus christ thou shalt be saved and so forth but what i want to draw from it tonight is a little bit more has to do with the condition that paul found himself we know that they were in prison they were in chains it was the middle of the night and it could have been what we would call a uh the lowest of low for him a really bad place you know to be have been thrown in jail and the stalks put on your feet and your hands and so forth be there in the middle of the night but yet they found something in themselves to sing about something to praise god about amen something and you know let me see here all right yeah they begin now and i thought about this i began to think about this and i'll go ahead and just kind of uh mention this here we'll get into this for just a few minutes if we can for perhaps now i want to talk to you first about the ingredients the ingredients to a healthy happy life amen a diet and how many knows you uh there's things that you can do that really drag you down there's things that you do that is not good for you but the ingredients i want to talk about this with just this a little thought here with paul and silas you know and i believe that one of the ingredients and that we have to have amen and we have to have a lot of first of all the first ingredient in our life that we have to have to have a healthy happy life amen how many knows what that first one might be anybody can guess that's one of them there you go first very good amen that's a good answer the very first thing you got to have in your life is god how he believes that because even jesus said that without me you can do nothing there's nothing any good you can't do anything without god amen if the world could just realize that that is the ingredient that god put in the center of our hearts to begin with he left a void there isn't that right because he meant that place to be filled he meant for something to be in that place in that heart and that is that was a room for himself so that he could be in the throne room because how many know that's the throne rune of almighty god you know because the pharisees were bickering with jesus and saying you know uh you know we we just don't like the way the disciples they don't even wash their hands and so forth and complaining about the way they did and jesus went to tell him you know it's not what you eat and what goes in the mouth that defiles a man but it's what comes out he identified the throne room for out of the heart come this and heart of the heart come murderers and and all of these things the problem is with the heart and i'll tell you what anybody can we say it i'm sure i'll get a good healthy amen on this and anybody that doesn't have god is not gonna have true joy they're not gonna have a healthy life folks we people listen i don't care amen if we are how faithful we are to church or whatever it might be amen unless god is in there you're still just going to be as empty as if he wasn't in church call yourself a christian we all believe that but if that if god isn't in there amen you're just as empty you still have do you don't have the right ingredient and that's what paul had one thing that paul had he didn't have nothing else he had been stripped of everything he didn't own anything amen and here he was in prison in a very dark place and that's where this world is it's in a very dark place that right you and i are getting into that dark place and that forgive me for changing my thought for just a second but you know if i'm not wrong whenever the angel painted the layout of ch age back over here it's actually on the billboard it's actually here i don't know if you can follow me or not mike or whatever but anyway right here this layout see if you'll notice that this age was actually completely blacked out he said to put a little sliver of light in it didn't he and i don't know why that one doesn't have it but this is the hour this is the age that it actually becomes completely black completely dark amen we want to talk about what the darkness is what light is and so forth in a little bit amen but uh you know we're living in an hour and i and can we just say this i you know if i understand it right okay that when that complete darkness comes all right it's be when the holy spirit is lifted from the world amen amen because as long as god is here you're going to have light here but when the holy spirit leaves us gentiles isn't that right that's when it completely blacks out then it's when things are really going to get bad and listen you know we're a privileged people i want to preach about privilege because the fact that you can have god is a real privilege people aren't going to realize the privilege that they had until they can't get it because when they completely blacks out they will call and deal one god but he won't be there for him huh now you talk about real bad that would be real bad oh my so in the next one let me just go on the next one but first of all you got to have god amen because without god you can do nothing the next important thing if you want to be a healthy christian how many wants to be a healthy christian who wants to be a better christian want to be a stronger christian what did brother branham say read your bible and pray more that's the only way you'll get stronger the next is prayer that i got wrote down here because it's very important that if you are a strong christian it's because that you have an intimate deep relationship with jesus christ you talk to him a lot you're friends huh if he's your friend it's going to mold you it's going to shape you it's going to make you what you ought to be and there's something that brother brandon what did brother baby say about prayer that's right brother tom you can't do it enough right you can't never pray too much amen so it's something that you can't do too much is talk to the lord sometimes i don't quite pray like i should and i'll think about going down the road hey if i'm driving i don't mind talking the lord anywhere i get a chance to talk to the lord it's always in season to talk to the lord so if you want a good strong healthy christian life you have to pray a lot the more you pray the more you're going to be stronger in the lord it's absolute necessity and a question you start slacking on your prayer life and every other portion becomes unimportant to you you get away from god again the next of course i wrote in here is church i may believe that church is important and we would almost almost want to meet amongst the coronavirus because we don't want to quit church huh it hurts us to have the cancer church and stay at home we might do it if we know and truly believe that it would save life hello yeah i don't have a problem with actually doing it if you know if we need to but it hurts you know we don't really want to do it because we love to fellowship how many bleeds believers love the fellowship around the word of god and that we love to be able to go out back and shake each other's hand amen and to see each other i mean i was kind of studying this afternoon and amen i was thinking boy it seems like a long time since sunday i'm ready to go back to church again huh how many believes that's the way it ought to be with everyone oh man it's been half a week i ain't seen none of the believers i'd like to see him again i'd like to get around and fellowship around the world church is an important part of a strong christian walk with the lord why because you feed on the word how many knows you feed on the word you get fed at the house of god if you don't eat you're gonna get skinny you're gonna get weak if you don't eat and that's where we come together the house of god not only to eat but also to fellowship one with another that's why we don't just like to have to jump in our car and go right away we like to be able to talk to each other and shake each other's hands if at all possible now right amen i believe it amen and i know in this time and during this time we have to be careful about all of that because you know they're having the social distances i've i'm like brother blind i guess i heard about brother brian you know yeah and he don't want no man he don't want to wear no mask is that right pretty staunch about have you worn one yet he ain't that horrible congratulations i couldn't quite do it because you know uh i i you know but i i carry them i don't care of them whenever i go into a business you know i know about you but i gotta have my milk you know i love my milk and i'm going to wear a mask for milk or whatever you know and so anyway i don't know where i'm going with this maybe it's getting a little carnal here but you know and anyway you think about it you know we don't want to do this but if it means you know they like the social network because of it and you know the thing of it is is we used to not think perhaps that this was real serious but we know like was historic he takes it well and it's really struggling it can't be real amen bad certainly don't vote for politicizing all of this but i do believe that you ought to take precautions amen and so anyway all right well let's get off of that so praise the lord anyway i didn't want to really either but i kind of gave in for that just you know to go into the places and so forth i don't know what you do but anyway they're pretty they're i would say that they're pretty lenient you know if they don't throw you out because you won't then hey you're all right you know because they can't do that you know they can't make you wear one but they can throw you off amen and the law supposedly can't uh arrest you for not wearing one but if you get on their property and they tell you to leave you i've been told that that's where you cross the line because your criminal trespassing for anybody tells you to get off their property so just so you all know we don't want nobody arrested here all right praise the lord so now let's just look at this a little bit listen brother bam says let's talk about this darkness a little bit because and as i got to thinking about this i think about all of the negative all of the darkness because how many knows everything negative is darkness that's why everything negative is darkness you know and you have so much of it you have so much a lot of it and even even this let me just kind of say this that we can come up here and we can preach about this is the end of the world the world is ending the economy is collapsing there is no hope for this world it's doomed huh sure that's all true but i don't know about you but that's not all i want to hear huh if we just constantly preach the negative the negative or the negative why why can't get you down wouldn't it kind of depress you it'd be as bad as watching the news all the time i wonder how many hands would go up that would say you know i have cut back on watching the news because it just gets to me yeah i cut back a little bit i think it was uh michael tidwell he says he says he'll only allow himself for three times a day that's silk quite often you know most of the time people will get up after coffee you know and they'll look at the news and the weather or whatever on your app you know watch you know fox news i'm sure everybody looks at fox news and not all of them i better put that right there now but anyway you have your coffee you have your news and you have your weather you know and hey that's good for the day i know what the weather's going to be i know half of what's going on around in the world but you know if you even that is so negative that you don't want to watch it all the time because it is so negative we could be negative we could preach this negativity until man it would be depressing and if all i ever told you that the world's going to end and there's no hope for this world why it'd be a little negative it'd be a little depressing even those those things are true what i thought about what made me happy this week was the thought it was this thought and that is that air is light in the midst of darkness there is a hope in the middle of hopelessness there is still that there there is still that limber that shimmer of light there for us what is that little glimmer of light that little glimmer of light is that the bible has absolutely pronounced that this world is going to burn i heard brother brahm say i believe it was in future home he talked about the volcano that will come up amen and all of those things that will re if the earth will actually renew itself i mean you talk about covering everything up covering it all up and all of that's going to happen but the bible gives us this hope and he gives us this hope and that hope yes that there is only one hope how many know that there is a hope amen and that is the coming of the lord for the believer i'm not worried about the world burning i'm not worried about the world ending 1960 hearing recognizing and acting on the word of god listen to that brother branham covers politics he covers all of these things he called covers the economy and all of that how corrupt and how all of that is at its end i was going to maybe even play a segment of that just to cover that and he covers it all in there but you think about it now that they're still in the midst of it all just like saul or paul just like saul it doesn't matter how dark it gets it doesn't matter how gloomy it is i am thankful that there is light in the middle of it because if there was no light there would be no hope huh there would be nothing but doom and we see the world in doom shape isn't that right but i like what paul said in thessalonians 5 5 he says you know ye are all the children of light and the children of the day ye are not of the night are of the darkness amen how many believe that every individual they either are living by darkness or they're living by light and we have been promised that in the midst of a dark world that we would not have to walk in darkness amen praise the lord now let me go on with just the other one on the ingredients and that is worship praise god and giving thanks how many believe that the christian amen every christian has an attitude of gratitude ain't nobody that likes to live around the negative all the time person and they thankful for anything they got nobody likes to live around the person nobody should you don't want to be that way why is part of the darkness but part of the light of a person and part of an absolute wonderful life is that you have joy unspeakable and full of glory that you worship and that you praise god and you thank god and you worship god and you give thanks you're a thankful person that's an ingredient to healthy christian life and a happy healthy life those are the it's just some of the ingredients and the other one of course is love that i've got wrote down here but that comes part of the light that's on the inside of us maybe we'll pick that up in a little bit all right so i've got rock down here notice blackout amen this world is blacking out amen and when the bride leaves it'll be completely blacked out people will go to church shall seek god they'll ask forgiveness and they'll want god but there won't be no hope it'll be so dark until all might will be terribly dark completely dark amen this coast comes to my mind right now remember brother branham had a blackboard it was all black and he'd take a chalk i believe and put a little dot on it once in a while that right and those dots represented light and that right and those dots represent the believer that is you that little dot is you in the midst of the darkness praise the lord how many believes deny that you are the light of the world you are the only light that people out there will ever see you're the only sermon they'll ever hear because every one of us is a living sermon we are the light of the world amen let me read you a couple quotes here can i oh what a privileged privileged i thought about i don't know just what the definition of privileged is but in my mind to be privileged is to be able to have access to something isn't that right because if you can't get something that you really want why you're not a privileged person amen and as i believe the prophet would say many times you are a privileged person today to be able to accept the lord jesus christ as your savior amen we're privileged people i believe i you know i don't know what the whole world is all maybe there's a better country than what we live in y'all's quiet now right some of shaking heads i don't think so russia no china no huh north korea no hardly any country in the shape that we're in we are probably still the most privileged people on the face of the earth yeah but i say are people thankful for that privilege no they're not thankful people aren't thankful but in the midst of an unthankful world there will be people that are thankful amen so brother bob says it this way oh in this great hour of darkness and chaos over the earth we should be think about it let me just say this each and every one of us here tonight and out there you should be able to say i'm the happiest person in the world that's what you should be able to say or you're living in the category where brother brown said that the people are living below the privileges amen just comes to mind brother dale potter used to call the upc underprivileged children y'all remember that underprivileged children the upc that was pentecostal people that are living below their privileges hallelujah how many believe we're privileged people we don't realize how privileged we are because once you begin to realize how privileged you really are it'll make you happy oh my arch you are thankful that you're that you know the lord that you're privileged to know the lord that's the main one that i can think of is to be one of god's children to know that you are one of god's children because notice paul had lost all things he said i have suffered the loss of all things and i count them but don't strong words that's right for the knowledge of knowing jesus there he was in the inner prison in the middle of the night in stocks and bonds and he was still the happiest person in the world happy singing it said the other folks that he didn't say now silas let's sing a song to the lord but we don't want to wake nobody up so keep it down what you let's just say amazing grace how sweet the sound oh if the bible says the other prisoners heard them i don't know where they were but they begin to sing praise the lord amazing grace hallelujah oh my can you imagine bellowing through that prison house hey be quiet maybe maybe your guard said hey you'll be quiet paul says what you gonna do put me in jail he was already in jail oh what are you gonna do time you up i'm already tied up amen and they begin to sing and the people heard them let me tell you something i believe that your neighborhood i believe your mama your daddy your brother your sister i believe you're workers i believe you both i believe they ought to be able to hear and see the shining light in your life because you're a privileged person and you're happy about being a privileged person amen can i just say what comes to mind it makes you want to take all these people that are not appreciative of their privileges and load them on up on the boat you ought to hear my wife she said oh no no but don't tell them honey don't tell them yeah think about it and take them to where you know maybe they'll be happy somewhere else isn't that right that's right you know i think a lot of that stuff's pretty accurate you know they said one two three or whatever and go in a corner just out of the other and don't spank them you know and they throw the toys at them now they're throwing rocks better bam said they'd go completely insane i believe he's right i mean the prophet was right amen all these things are important the home is important the mother is important weapons are important correction is important praise the lord so he says listen in this ark there's a darkness and chaos over there we ought to be not gloomy huh not all depressed let me just stop here if you're depressed sorrowful and beat down and not with the lord huh because sometimes you can be sad in the lord sometimes you can be going through a trial and you're not so happy huh but you still got that joy down there i mean that's how it is but if that joy is not down there amen in that oh depression and that darkness i want you to know you don't have to be that way you're privileged to be able to go to the lord in prayer how many thankful for the grace of god that if you mess up hey if god wrote you off what a horrible situation you'd be in but we have our privilege to be able to go before our lord in prayer oh my and to rejoice to know all the time when the people are so indoctrinated in indoctrinated and all kinds of isms and things in the world and yet today the real living god by his word and by physical evidence shows us that he's here with us amen how many please if that's the real privileges that we have he says i will never leave you nor will i we're privileged because if he ever does you're not a privileged person anymore gross darkness will come upon your heart if he would ever leave us or forsake us amen he's here with us working and moving and living and acting exactly like he has always did what a privileged people that we are to have this thank you lord when i was wondering what was right amen you came and showed me the true light even jesus says boy you are a privileged person if you can see these things if you have eyes to see and if you have ears to hear you are a blessed person a happy person brother man says that means amen i believe it's time for revelations 19 where it says let us be glad and rejoice rejoice did you ever see a little kid rejoicing they get plum happy don't they they just rejoice that's gotta be what's in our heart rejoicing be glad in the midst of when everybody's sad and everybody said it's a sad world yeah huh pull you may mass down say hey how are you doing put it back up you're like who in the world what's going on huh i still think it's funny to go down the road and wave wave at people see how many a wave some will wave back then a time or two i didn't think about they went by and waved that says hey you didn't wave they did oh man i missed that one about 50 50. you know and i said that one didn't wave she said yeah he did i seen his little finger coming up off the road i said well praise god it was the right one you never know nowadays all right well praise the lord so now notice brett brown says did you ever stop to think of what a privileged people we are at this day did you ever stop yeah i did this week i stopped for a minute and i began to think of what a privileged people we are amen and i don't you say well brother butler you know i don't have much i don't own much i don't mean that's not what i'm talking about i don't care if we're as poor as paul is you're still a privileged person that ought to be the happiest person in the world i don't care if you're daniel and the lion said or the sheep hebrew children fixing to burn in the fire you could be the happiest person in the world why brother brother let me tell you why because it's like abraham he says god told abraham he said i am your portion brother bannon was back there and a little old trailer of his and he had a little typewriter and he got to thinking about tommy osborne he got to thinking about billy graham and horror roberts and how did they have these great big buildings and everything else and he says here i am lord and a little low trailer with a little old typewriter he's a voice told him but i am your portion it don't matter how much you got it what you got in this world if you've got god you've got everything you take this whole world and give me jesus take this all out but give me jesus how many is with business more tonight you can have it all i just want to make sure i got jesus because if you got him you got everything praise the lord what a privilege we are for this day living in the closing of this world's history huh that's where we're living in the closing of this world's history but yet we're the most privileged people and living in a time when there's all kinds of ism and creates all of these things going on and yet in the midst of all that god writes in on the waves and confirms his word before us hallelujah i'm thankful for that again oh i'm so glad that the prophet promised that there would be light in the evening it is our when it's so dark in the world huh doom and gloom and to know that we are living and walking in the light praise be the god heart oh but don't that make wanna sing that song we'll walk in the light such a beautiful light amen walk where the dewdrops of mercy are bright come on people i'm getting too happy up here it ain't right i need another person to fill me up a little more huh i'll leave the way to be i believe that's what god does for us amen all right the light that he promised that he would do oh my he promised he would do it here we are the privileged people tonight to enjoy these things at the end time praise the lord hallelujah what is darkness i got wrote down here what is darkness darkness is sorrow no joy all right no joy but instead of sorrow god gives you joy unspeakable because listen if there was no christ if there was the holy ghost you truly would not have that joy i mean believe i'm thankful for joy the other one is we're living in a dark hopeless world we're living in a doomed world i mean how many knows there is no coming back she is going over the falls huh she is going down she is going to burn yeah a doomed world that we're living on quite something in it they've been living on the planet that's doomed maybe we'd better get down to this kennedy space center and think about going to mars huh that's all they can do maybe get a space shape station ready uh i heard brother brown talking about the fire that's coming i think it was the future home he talked about those uh gases and things that are in those upper atmosphere he talked about them igniting he talked about them even going off and burning can you imagine the heat that that would create is that right so he even talked about that so my my think about it it's going to absolutely be something else but yet in the midst of it all we can have joy unspeakable because because we don't have a kennedy space center we have a jesus christ spaceship called a countdown and that right in the gospel ship i'm just glad to be in the gospel ship yes amen came in the door come in the door of the gospel by acts 2 38 got baptized in this jesus name got filled with the holy ghost i'm sitting here in one of the seats that's reserved for me i was glad to have reservations on this ship amen praise the lord all right oh my i laugh because i think about naturally how happy we would be if we knew that we was going somewhere safe just before the destruction and we had our seat reserved and we would be outside of that ship huh we'd be shaking each other saying boy are we pleasant oh isn't that wonder is that great to know that hey we're going to leave this place before this thing burns up because it's going now huh but we hear about leaving the light huh we don't quite as excited maybe as we should all right now i'm not just here to get you excited but i'm excited because the lord jesus christ is real there is truly light still in the midst of the darkness and i'm here to tell you that sometime there will not be light in the darkness that light will go out be completely black and i want to not be here when that happens i believe i'm a part of that light i believe you are a part of that light that will leave amen all right so listen that's right a privileged people we are to enjoy these things our heavenly father we are indeed a privileged people this morning in the face of this changing world and we have a hold of the hand of the unchanging god amen times may change but he's eternal and his word is in our heart it's the ultimate of our thoughts they always drift back to the word no matter where we stray he says it always comes back to the word i'm thankful for that privilege that whenever you do stray a little amen and you can come back to the word the holy spirit brings you back to the word to keep you on course otherwise we would drift out into outer darkness and chaos and stay there amen but it's his mercy they always drift back to that word no matter where we stray come back to the word it's a typos of our heart and we're so grateful for that amen one more quote now we're just gloriously and very very thankful for what he has done for us the great mysterious hand this is the fifth seal the great mysterious head of the living god what greater thing could be how much more of a privileged people could would be to have the presence of our king among us and the king of kings and the lord of lords what a great honor and what a privileged people to have him in our midst amen how many thankful to have in our midst amen praise the lord we're how many thankful for it all right let's talk about just in closing how that we can be because how many believes we truly are the light of the world jesus said in matthew i've got it there he says ye are the light of the world and a candle that is lit is not to be put under a bushel a lie a city that is on a hill that's lit up it cannot be hid that's what you and i are and how are we that way by not having all of those negatives on us amen have sin have uh unbelief amen all those things are things that are dark they're of the darkness not of the light amen one of the one of the most listen you know i thought about well what about the negative people think about and paul said you know all the promises of god are yea and amen in other words they're positive how many beliefs everything about that is positive the only thing that's not positive it's not this it's those who don't believe it that that's where the negative is that's where the darkness is that's what a damn nation is those that don't believe but it's all it's everything positive for the believer brother bam even said he makes a statement he says you know the holy spirit is never negative the holy ghost is there's nothing negative about the holy spirit nothing oh i could i just when you think about what the lord has done in your life how he forgave you of all your sins i put him all in the sea of his forgetfulness is that right that even even said look the judgment that's coming that's wrote in the bible you're going to be on the other side of it okay you're going to be with me in judgment judging the world about paul said don't you know that the saints are going to judge the world he took you completely out of judgment he took you out of condemnation he had a part and that he had a pardon wrote for you he's actually a pardon for the whole world but they don't receive it that's what's negative about it because then they have to take the condemnation that he wrote amen they have to they have to be in the fire because they didn't accept the holy ghost fire they didn't accept the way out oh think about the yay of god's word everything's positive about god's word and then when he did save you when he did fill you with the holy ghost amen just like abraham the first time that he lied to that king down there isn't that right god didn't write him off amen god didn't write ever he took lot along with him he shouldn't have taken his lot of his father-in-law and he got into a big bunch of fusses and fights and everything else and they had to part their ways but god didn't write him up for it no he worked with him he taught him and he was teaching them he had grace he was mercy it was a it was a what unconditional covenant unconditional promise abraham i'm gonna do this and i believe that is to you and i tonight that god's promises are unconditional if he has begun to walk good work in you he is able to perform it oh my think about it the honor and the privilege if he has started that work and all of us are nature different all of us may rebel against god more or he may have to work harder on some of us to get us where we need to be isn't that right but he got abraham to where he ought to be and through life's journey to think you know the one of the greatest privilege one of the things that really really i love so much is that you know it is not you holding on it's him alone he's got his hand on you praise god and i'd be long gone i'd be long gone if it wasn't for the grace of god long gone huh no doubt be in the grave already huh because that's where the devil puts you the first chance he gets you serve him won't last all that long amen so i thank god for his grace i'm sure everybody can say i thank god for his mercy for his grace and for his hand that pulled you and hold you mercy said no i'm not gonna let you go i'm not gonna let you slip away huh i love that song that's a new devil can't have you hallelujah you love the lord tonight i just had that thought lord thank you that there's light in the middle of darkness that little bit of light is still there and i want it with all of my heart how many is with me i want that light i want to be that light let me read quickly read this scripture put on therefore the light as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercy when the world is merciless is that right how many knows we're living in a merciless world brutal killing and everything else amen no kindness in the world but it says put on kindness that's how you show the life by being kind humbleness of mind huh being humble meekness and lung suffering forbearing one another amen if i understand it right putting up with each other huh in other words i don't like that guy anymore i'm right now be long suffering with him forbearing one another and forgiving if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ also forgive you so also do ye and above all things make sure you got charity how many believes that's a very important ingredient a lot the most important we say you know that's by the holy ghost you can only have it by the holy ghost it's half of charity above all things put on charity which is the bond of perfection and let the peace of god in the world of chaos in distress let the peace of god rule in your hearts that's one of the things that brought this to my message is when i was just thinking about this working around the farm there and i said thank you lord jesus for the peace that i have in my heart what would i do without that peace how many appreciates that peace that peace peace wonderful peace coming down from the father above amen in a world that doesn't have any peace at all if you want to let your light shine have peace to the witch let the peace of god rule in your hearts to which also you are called in one body and be ye thankful have an attitude of gratitude god bless you let's stand tonight let's bow our heads are you the happiest person in the world or do you really need some more peace and joy in your heart whether here or out there on the net if you're listening tonight wherever you are you really can't say i'm the happiest player i am so happy i'm like paul was in the midst of the darkness most horrible shape yet he could sing he could pray he had joy unspeakable and full of glory if you can't say that tonight raise your hand with me right now and say god i need i need more of the joy of the lord i'm certainly not the happiest person in the world like the pr prophet of god said that i should be but i want to be i want to be able to say i can't stand it it is so awesome i need another person to fill another one it's just overflowing it's joy unspeakable and full of glory in the midst of this dark world of sorrow and depression i have joy unspeakable god bless those hands that are up and i trust that you'll pray and pray and say god whatever it takes i want that joy more than anything else i want the joy of the lord i want the peace of the lord i want the longsuffering the gentleness the meekness the patience i want all of these things in my heart i need him and i'm raising my hand and believing god that you'll give them to me lord and father whatever it is that i'm doing that's causing me not to have it i pray god you'll take it away because i only have one desire and that is to be the light to the world to have the joy of the lord in my heart in the midst of this midnight hour in this darkness i ask god you give me joy unspeakable and full of glory we ask god that you'll do work in every heart that's bowed just now father do a work begin to show them connect them in their minds what it is that's throbbing them of this joy that they could have and whatever it is that you put into their minds and you live let them know what it is give them the courage lord to change it change me from what i am to what i should be and help me to be like paul who said i have learned how to be hungry and how to be full how to suffer need all of these things i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me we ask god that you'd help us that in the midst of a dark world to have the joy of the lord and the peace of god ruling and reigning in our hearts we ask these blessings and favors in jesus name lord father not just momentarily but between now and sunday god help us work on us change us make us different than what we are make us better than what we are lord teach us daily your ways for we ask these blessings in your precious name amen and amen god bless you he
