[26:29] real friend that come and brother Andrew
[26:33] Glover amen he uh he's showed up amen he
[26:38] uh texted me a few days ago and want to
[26:39] know what our church times are and and
[26:42] so forth and I give him our church times
[26:44] and so brother Brad called me this
[26:46] afternoon said he was here and then
[26:47] brother uh Andrew also texted me said
[26:49] he's here he's just here coming to visit
[26:51] and see us so about you but that means a
[26:55] lot to me amen whether he's preaching or
[26:57] not he's going to come he wants to come
[26:58] see us amen shows that he really loves
[27:01] and concerns So I says well I'll tell

[27:05] pony preaching can have a real
[27:10] horse oh uh anyway and as big as one too
[27:16] any well I know she got to watch that I
[27:18] I'll be in trouble right but just tall
[27:21] anyway as
[27:22] far I want to talk to these good quotes
[27:25] and you know what the word says what the
[27:27] quotes say and so forth and then I
[27:29] thought about brother Andrew and my
[27:31] goodness gracious I'll tell you what
[27:34] well here comes a new thought you know I
[27:36] might be a 22 but that guy's a Gatling
[27:38] gun all right when he spits him out I'm
[27:41] here to better go hide right
[27:46] because I know brother Andrew and I'll
[27:48] tell you what I don't know anybody
[27:50] preaches Harder Faster and more true and
[27:52] more honest
[27:54] and so we're certainly looking forward
[27:56] to at it and so
[27:59] amen so we'll try to uh amen just
[28:03] looking forward to that
[28:05] amen uh all right we're going to turn it
[28:08] over brother Joshua if you'll come and
[28:10] worship uh I don't else right now we'll
[28:14] we'll keep everybody posted and updated
[28:16] okay amen and we're
[28:17] believing I know what I was going to say
[28:19] a little bit more maybe I was going to
[28:21] say you know I do
[28:23] believe that uh nothing happens unless
[28:27] God has permitted
[28:29] it amen the devil has to have permission
[28:33] is that right and that the God won't
[28:35] perit anything amen but what he's going
[28:38] to receive Glory and Honor out ofen amen
[28:41] he's seen fit to uh uh allow to H happen
[28:44] to me and Donna amen you know to Donna
[28:47] but if I say me and Donna because she's
[28:49] part of me how many knows we're we're
[28:51] one so if it happens to one it happens
[28:54] to me amen and so uh you know to see and
[28:57] I thought I thought this was kind of a a
[29:00] gradu what is this maybe a graduation
[29:04] trial I I I think of it as the
[29:07] ultimate this is the ultimate
[29:10] test this is the ultimate test amen amen
[29:15] and I thought of it like two Gladiators
[29:17] you know the in the old days they would
[29:20] have Gladiator fights right and
[29:22] sometimes they would say well now this
[29:23] fight here between the two one can live
[29:28] only one can
[29:30] live it's life and death that's the kind
[29:34] of trial it is amen so it's pretty
[29:37] serious amen it's not like well you've
[29:40] got cancer but we can cut it out and
[29:42] you've got a 80% chance amen is that
[29:45] right but this here when they tell you
[29:48] that well they tell you that you aren't
[29:50] going to make it right so then they're
[29:52] saying it's uh life or death so I so I
[29:57] accept it as that
[29:58] ain't that right it's to the
[30:01] death one's going to
[30:04] die one's going to die
[30:09] amen the devil cancer is't that
[30:13] right the other thing is in this fight
[30:16] and in this battle this is also the way
[30:18] I see it this is to do streaming or
[30:20] anybody is that for me and my
[30:24] wife if we lose we're still winning
[30:27] we're we're we still
[30:30] win and if the devil wins he still
[30:35] loses amen Give the Lord a
[30:38] hand that's
[30:40] right that's right because we win either
[30:43] way so we're going to win in this game
[30:46] in this fight praise the Lord how many
[30:48] we're going to win amen and so like I
[30:50] said he's he's the loser that is a loser
[30:53] amen and so even like I I was thinking
[30:56] even if he win he still lose you know
[30:58] because uh he he can't win there's no
[31:01] way that he can't win because we are we
[31:03] win either way so praise be to
[31:06] God Amen so God bless
[31:10] you amen how you know the other thing
[31:14] know if the devil thinks he's going to
[31:16] knock us down slow us down or anything
[31:17] he's got I've got news for him we're not
[31:20] down all this is going to do is bring us
[31:22] closer to God I was thinking on the
[31:25] church uh on on the way to church I says
[31:27] you know this is is going to give us a
[31:28] big
[31:29] bump it already has me and my wife it
[31:32] has given us a bump closer to God like

[55:18] beautiful amen amen Luke chapter
[55:21] 16 and verse number you love the Lord
[55:25] tonight amen amen Luke 16: 16 Jesus here
[55:30] speaking he says now the law and the
[55:33] prophets un John but since that time the
[55:38] kingdom preached and every man presseth
[55:42] into it I love that the kingdom of God
[55:46] is preached and every man presseth into
[55:49] it so there is a preaching of the
[55:51] Kingdom there is a pressing into it the
[55:54] kingdom of God is preached in every man
[55:56] presseth into it Philippians chapter
[55:58] 3 Philippians chapter 3 I
[56:02] know a very familiar reading to you as a
[56:04] Believer tonight you can probably read
[56:06] it uh from your from memory in
[56:09] Philippians chapter 3 and verse number
[56:11] 13 Paul here writing he says Brethren I
[56:15] count not my have apprehended but this
[56:18] one thing I do forgetting those things
[56:20] which are behind and reaching forth
[56:24] those things which are before now watch
[56:26] what he says I pray toward the mark for
[56:30] the prize of the High Calling of God in
[56:33] Christ Jesus I think it's Paul is
[56:36] instructing the church that there are
[56:39] some things that are behind us but he's
[56:41] saying going back to they're actually
[56:44] worth forgetting and leaving behind us
[56:47] and then pressing forth unto the thing
[56:50] that are in front of us now in the book
[56:52] of 2 Corinthians chapter 4 I believe
[56:55] this here is the way
[56:56] that a Believer presses forward we'll
[56:59] find it in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and
[57:02] verse number 13 Paul here writing he
[57:05] says now we having the same Spirit of
[57:09] Faith according as it is written I
[57:12] believed and therefore have I spoken now
[57:15] watch here so there's a there's a
[57:17] speaker that would be Paul right as I
[57:20] believed I spoke and now watch he turns
[57:23] it it says we also believe
[57:26] and therefore we speak I believe the
[57:29] church Living God presses forward by
[57:32] believing the things that have been
[57:34] spoken in The Same Spirit of faith that
[57:37] they were spoken in now in verse 18 He
[57:39] says this while we look not at the
[57:42] things which are seen But at the things
[57:45] which are not seen for the things which
[57:47] are seen are temporal things which are
[57:50] not seen are Eternal we ask the Lord
[57:54] this evening to add the blessing to the
[57:55] reading of you can have your seats here
[57:57] this afternoon for just a few moments
[57:59] tonight if the Lord would help me I
[58:01] would like to talk to you for a few
[58:02] moments here on pressing by faith
[58:06] realities of the Unseen pressing by
[58:09] faith reties of the Unseen of course in
[58:12] Luke 16 Philippians 3 we read there
[58:15] about the word press and in in the
[58:17] Webster dictionary he actually says that
[58:19] press actually means to move or to cause
[58:22] to move into a position of contact now
[58:26] contact with someone or something amen
[58:29] by
[58:30] exer physical Force so when you begin to
[58:33] press up on something you're actually
[58:35] pressing in order to move into a
[58:37] position of contact amen with something
[58:40] of a higher power
[58:41] now of God tells us amen that the most
[58:45] powerful force there is is God how many
[58:47] age there is no more powerful force than
[58:50] God then he'll come along and say and
[58:52] one of the
[58:53] do they say well I tell you I found this
[58:56] amen that the great power in the world
[58:59] is not the atomic bomb he says but a
[59:02] believer in contact his maker amen I'll
[59:05] just go ahead and say it if there is a
[59:07] Believer here tonight and I believe
[59:08] there is amen you all can testify amen
[59:12] that if you are in contact with God you
[59:14] didn't get there easy amen it wasn't an
[59:16] easy walk it wasn't an easy Journey but
[59:18] you had to press am then be on some
[59:21] things to get into contact with God he
[59:23] said but when a Believer gets in contact
[59:25] with God he said it will change his
[59:27] whole attitude it will change his mental
[59:30] it will change his habit it will change
[59:32] his body it will change his nature amen
[59:35] it everything so when a Believer comes
[59:38] in contact amen with his maker just
[59:41] coming in contact amen has the ability
[59:44] to change everything about that believer
[59:48] 1949 subject of science he said now I
[59:51] was just thinking of how that science
[59:53] how they're taking the natural man and
[59:55] how he's went into the research from the
[59:57] Fallen natural and what he has done he
[59:59] said how little the spiritual man has
[1:00:02] progressed in the kingdom of God he said
[1:00:04] I was thinking the natural man went out
[1:00:06] at the Unseen of his eye amen and he
[1:00:09] pulled an Adam down out of the sky and
[1:00:11] he split the Adam and two and that
[1:00:13] destroys human life he said but if the
[1:00:15] natural man that knows nothing of God
[1:00:18] and cannot know nothing of God except he
[1:00:20] be converted then his soul becomes alive
[1:00:24] with the supernatural he said now if he
[1:00:26] could do that in the natural realm amen
[1:00:28] then what ought the man of God to be
[1:00:30] doing he said my friends the church is
[1:00:33] so far behind he said let's pray my that
[1:00:36] God Amen will move his church up he said
[1:00:40] the natural man with the natural
[1:00:42] resources is getting greater results
[1:00:44] than people are amen that call
[1:00:46] themselves Christians now listen to The
[1:00:48] Prophet amen let's press into the Unseen
[1:00:51] amen let's press into the Unseen amen
[1:00:55] the blessing are there amen they're
[1:00:57] yours and they're there for you listen
[1:01:00] the prophet of God is not
[1:01:03] telling seen he's not telling us amen
[1:01:06] just to settle for what we can we can
[1:01:08] feel or what we can hear amen but he's
[1:01:11] saying there is place that we can go
[1:01:13] amen that is an eternal place and unseen
[1:01:16] Place listen if there is a Believer here
[1:01:19] tonight that desires a blessing amen a
[1:01:22] prophet has identified where that
[1:01:23] blessing is he said the blessing of God
[1:01:26] are in the Unseen he said every blessing
[1:01:29] that he died for amen is ours right now
[1:01:33] he said oh God Amen help us to have
[1:01:36] faith tonight can I just tell you how
[1:01:38] how how determined God is for you to
[1:01:41] receive his Blessing he said let's have
[1:01:43] faith tonight amen to use your that you
[1:01:46] said it was ours let us claim it tonight
[1:01:49] every god-given privilege that we have
[1:01:52] so God has these blessings there amen
[1:01:54] but if you don't have the faith amen
[1:01:57] within yourself to get the blessing he
[1:01:59] said God will give you his own faith
[1:02:01] Amen in order for you to climb up into
[1:02:04] that Dimension and to receive that
[1:02:06] blessing now I don't know about you we
[1:02:08] don't have to stay Earth we don't have
[1:02:11] to stay under the control amen of what
[1:02:13] the devil says and what the devil thinks
[1:02:16] been called as the Church of the Living
[1:02:18] God Amen to believe God in the face of
[1:02:20] every obstacle Amen in the face of every
[1:02:23] opposition Amen to stand on the word of
[1:02:25] God and de claim the things amen God has
[1:02:28] given us now amen as Believers you all
[1:02:30] are not unfamiliar with the word unseen
[1:02:33] as a matter of fact brother bam preaches
[1:02:35] that sermon about three times amen
[1:02:38] looking at the Unseen 1950 he said now
[1:02:41] amen we look at the Unseen amen and
[1:02:44] believe that those things which are
[1:02:46] unseen amen but spoke of by God Amen
[1:02:50] they become realities I got to reading
[1:02:53] that the other day and it just got all
[1:02:54] over me am that we look at the Unseen
[1:02:58] amen and we believe that those things
[1:03:00] which are unseen but they are spoke of
[1:03:03] by God Amen they become realities he
[1:03:07] said another place 1959 looking at the
[1:03:10] he said we are told amen that we have an
[1:03:13] outward man and an inward man he said
[1:03:15] now the outward man looks by his eyes
[1:03:18] amen but the inward walks by faith he
[1:03:21] say so we have to be led by one of these
[1:03:23] two persons amen the out that outward
[1:03:26] man is self amen but the inward man is
[1:03:29] God he said you see we do not see with
[1:03:32] our eyes though many times we thought we
[1:03:35] see with our eyes he said we only look
[1:03:37] with our eyes amen but we see with our
[1:03:40] heart amen we look with our eyes amen
[1:03:44] but we see with our heart listen if
[1:03:46] you're looking for the spiritual
[1:03:47] blessings amen that Paul promised you in
[1:03:50] Ephesians chapter 1 amen with the
[1:03:52] natural eye you're never going to see it
[1:03:55] amen but God has sent a prophet in this
[1:03:57] generation who said behold I will send
[1:04:00] you Elijah the prophet shall turn the
[1:04:03] heart amen before the great and Dreadful
[1:04:05] day listen the message did not come Amen
[1:04:08] to turn our eyes it came to turn our
[1:04:11] hearts and the only way we can see a
[1:04:13] miracle is by looking with our hearts
[1:04:16] the only way we can see a victory amen
[1:04:19] is by looking with our heart I believe
[1:04:22] the time has come for the church amen of
[1:04:24] the Living God to look away away from
[1:04:26] the things of the world Amen to look
[1:04:28] away from the reports of the devil I
[1:04:30] believe the time has come amen for the
[1:04:32] Believers to press amen but not to press
[1:04:35] backwards amen not to go to the left to
[1:04:38] the right amen but the time has come
[1:04:41] Amen to press forward the prophet of God
[1:04:43] said we work together as one unit see we
[1:04:46] have to get our differences away we have
[1:04:48] to lay aside our doctr things amen and
[1:04:51] put our arms together amen and press
[1:04:54] forward and take the promise that God
[1:04:57] Almighty has given us I don't know about

[1:05:10] not profess amen we are possessors we
[1:05:14] have promises to possess in the land of
[1:05:17] our inheritance the prophet of God said
[1:05:20] a man that's commissioned of God Amen he
[1:05:22] looks upward and onward he said you
[1:05:24] don't have to care what the world says
[1:05:26] about it anyhow amen he's not listening
[1:05:28] to the world he's got a Divine con from
[1:05:32] God and he is enjoying that presence

[1:05:58] doing more amen than just making a shout
[1:06:00] or making a dance amen but I believe the
[1:06:03] Holy Ghost is making us
[1:06:05] perseverant word perseverant means to be
[1:06:07] persistent Amen in order to make a goal

[1:06:12] ever amounted to anything at any time

[1:14:46] and get in the word and as he would say
[1:14:49] that word come on church he wasn't
[1:14:51] standing behind giving a political
[1:14:53] speech he was standing

[1:15:13] together amen that makes the unit he
[1:15:16] said you know I used to work as
[1:15:17] electrician he said I find out could
[1:15:20] have a wire that's got plenty of current
[1:15:22] but it's not effective until it's
[1:15:25] grounded he said so when it's grounded
[1:15:27] then you get the result which is the
[1:15:29] current so we must have both parts of
[1:15:32] the wire Amen to make if there would
[1:15:35] ever be such a wonderful speaking and
[1:15:37] yet one to believe it come on don't
[1:15:41] matter how many notes Brother Brad or
[1:15:43] brother Thomas or any other preacher
[1:15:44] comes out
[1:15:45] here wonderful speaking it is
[1:15:48] ineffective until somebody begins to
[1:15:51] believe it he said but if there is so oh
[1:15:53] I love this he said if there's someone
[1:15:55] to believe it then comes real effective
[1:16:00] Hallelujah when you begin to hear the
[1:16:03] word preached and you begin to believe
[1:16:05] that word that word begins to become
[1:16:07] effective in your life he said we
[1:16:10] believe Lord I think it's a powerful
[1:16:13] thing amen that faith is what makes the
[1:16:16] word become real
[1:16:19] effective now Faith is the substance of
[1:16:22] things hoped for it's evidence of Things
[1:16:25] Not Seen listen for by it the elders
[1:16:30] obtained watch this and through faith we
[1:16:33] understand that the worlds were framed
[1:16:36] by the word of God so that the things
[1:16:38] which are seen were not made of things
[1:16:42] which do appear ream comes along in 1950
[1:16:45] and says you testify of the things you
[1:16:48] do not
[1:16:49] see my goodness you testify of the
[1:16:54] things you do not see so you don't
[1:16:56] testify of what you see amen you testify
[1:17:00] of what you don't see but how hard is
[1:17:03] that because all you see is what you
[1:17:06] see am all
[1:17:08] you amen but somewhere sometime you got
[1:17:12] out of what you see and press by faith
[1:17:14] into the realities of the Unseen and
[1:17:17] then you begin to testify of seeing
[1:17:20] things that nobody else sees see because
[1:17:23] faith is the substance of things hope
[1:17:25] for it's the evidence of things you do
[1:17:28] not see he said faith is something amen
[1:17:31] that's born in you it's something that
[1:17:33] God gives you another place faith is
[1:17:36] Supernatural and it does Supernatural
[1:17:39] things he said the only spiritual faith
[1:17:42] will only recognize the word so when
[1:17:45] you've got the faith of God in your
[1:17:48] heart the only thing that faith will
[1:17:51] recognize is the word perfect Faith 1916
[1:17:55] 3 he said now we want to speak now upon
[1:17:57] faith and a different type of
[1:17:59] faith faith he said we're told in the
[1:18:02] Bible Faith come up by hearing now you
[1:18:04] cannot be saved without faith he is are
[1:18:08] y'all ready for this he said faith is
[1:18:11] something that you have to believe it's
[1:18:14] there you have to believe it's there
[1:18:17] that really nothing else will declare
[1:18:19] it's there but
[1:18:21] faith faith is believing something is
[1:18:24] there but rich man when nothing else
[1:18:25] will declare it's there when your see
[1:18:28] won't declare it when your feel won't
[1:18:30] declare it when you're hearing won't
[1:18:32] declare it when your memory and reason
[1:18:34] and conscience and affection when none
[1:18:35] of those things will declare it but
[1:18:37] faith is the super sense which is the
[1:18:40] six sense which is the Holy Ghost the
[1:18:42] faith of God and that dwells in you if
[1:18:46] you let the five senses be yielded to
[1:18:48] the six sense it'll guide and bring all
[1:18:51] the other five senses under control the
[1:18:54] super sense he said it's so far above
[1:18:56] the natural sense natural man is above
[1:18:59] the spiritual man as far as the heavens
[1:19:02] is above the natural man and his senses
[1:19:04] listen it makes you believe things that
[1:19:08] not
[1:19:09] see glory to God it makes you believe
[1:19:12] things that you cannot see see it makes
[1:19:16] you act where you do not think the five
[1:19:19] senses would ever think about see the
[1:19:21] devil can get in those five senses and
[1:19:24] he can lie to you but he cannot touch
[1:19:27] that super sense it's far beyond his
[1:19:30] reach see that comes from God it's
[1:19:33] called
[1:19:35] Faith what is Faith it's an unseen Force
[1:19:39] it's a spirit and the Holy Spirit brings
[1:19:42] Faith let me say this faith is the
[1:19:45] evidence of Things Not Seen and Hebrews
[1:19:49] 11: 7 the bible says that by faith which
[1:19:52] that by faith means with confidence in
[1:19:54] God Amen his word by faith Noah being
[1:19:59] warned of God of things not seen as yet
[1:20:03] oh of things not seen as yet he moved
[1:20:08] with fear he prepared an ark to the
[1:20:10] saving of his house by the which he
[1:20:12] condemned the world and became heir of
[1:20:15] the righteousness which is by faith
[1:20:19] listen Noah by faith he moved with fear
[1:20:23] amen
[1:20:25] and
[1:20:25] seen listen Noah knew he was going to
[1:20:28] see you though what are you with me he
[1:20:31] knew he was going to see it couldn't it
[1:20:35] yet but he knew he was going to see it I
[1:20:38] got to studying that the other day
[1:20:40] looking the Amplified Bible I looked at
[1:20:42] that here that that that part of that
[1:20:45] verse that says things not seen in
[1:20:48] Amplified Bible listen at this
[1:20:49] translation it says events not yet seen
[1:20:55] events not yet seen I said oh thank you
[1:20:59] Jesus cuz we got two tapes called modern
[1:21:04] events are made clear by the prophecy
[1:21:08] listen if you have your heart the
[1:21:11] control of the six sense which is fa
[1:21:14] don't have to wait until you see the
[1:21:17] manifestation to begin to Rejoice but
[1:21:20] when you hear the prophecy or you hear
[1:21:23] the word there is something something
[1:21:24] that settles in your heart I don't know
[1:21:27] when I don't know how but I know it's
[1:21:30] going to take
[1:21:31] place I don't know when I don't know how
[1:21:35] but I know it's going to happen I stand
[1:21:38] like Noah I don't know yet but I know
[1:21:41] it's going to happen because God said so
[1:21:44] and I judge him faithful who said
[1:21:46] it I was out in California one time guy
[1:21:50] there he told me he said he said brother
[1:21:52] Andrew he said you want to see the
[1:21:53] driverless car I saidoh sure you know

[1:21:57] punches it in he said now what he'll do
[1:22:00] is this driverless car will come right
[1:22:01] by here and there'll be nobody in it

[1:22:46] event before I start praising God but
[1:22:49] the minute the word is spoken the spirit
[1:22:52] of faith is in my heart I begin to
[1:22:55] believe God listen if it takes 5 years
