sweet Spirit have something in common and you know brother Thomas has just had a really good time with you this weekend getting the fellowship and getting to know you a little bit better and you know just kindred spirits and we have a lot in common and thankful Lord we have this message we have the Lord in common and brother Brad and I we go a little bit ways back so just great to be here again and for all the lers they got great big hearts great big hearts I messed up last night they may have not remember me from the last time they'll never forgive me from last night I'm just trust they'll forgive me for last night if you have your Bibles I want to speak to you this morning try to kind of take these two services that we' spoken and you know I mentioned to you earlier that God gave me two services but I knew expressly that I needed to speak those in the order in which to speak them and and this and as I was up last week uh meditating on a hunting trip and just praying about the service I took back home last week and also this weekend the Lord also would have me to speak this here as well I want to speak to you on we will finish it all right so it's one thing to see somebody else in that picture of Victory but it's another thing to see yourself in that place of Victory and I want you to know today that many of us we have silenced a voice that the enemy you heard from the voice of the Lord but I want to come back this morning and by the help of the Lord not me but the help of the Lord to encourage you that we will finish this fight yeah okay so we look here in John 14 and12 it says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall he do also yes and Greater Works than these than these shall he do because I go unto my father also in 2 Corinthians 6 and verse one says we then as workers together with him beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain so we find here that the works that he did we're to do also second Corinthians 61 then we are workers together with him go to 2 Corinthians 5:18 it says and all things are of God who has reconciled us to himself yes reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation so we have a work to do we have a Ministry of reconciliation to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing their transp their trans trespasses unto them and had committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ and though God did not beseech You by us we pray you in Christ Christ dead be ye reconciled God bless you you can have your seats this morning so we find here that each of us here today are Servants of the lord we have a responsibility and it's more than just coming to church on Wednesday night it's more than just coming to church and occupying a a certain Pew and on Sunday morning or just special meetings it's more than that but we have a work to do and and the Bible says that if you believe on me and the works that I do you shall do also yeah and so we find both in in in in 2 Corinthians 5:20 that here Paul is calling us he tells us you're ambassadors for Christ and Bloomfield would tell us this definition of Ambassador is an age man it's an ELD it means that one acts as an ambassador sometimes merely to deliver a message for another without being empowered to do anything more just an explain it or and for it so understand when we preach the gospel to you we're ambassadors of Christ it's not my idea it's not brother bram's idea it's not our message it's not our we're not empowered to enforce it we're just here to explain it to you we're here to deliver the word to you because we're acting as an ambassador on behalf of the cause of Christ and each one of you here tonight are an ambassador of that cause it's not you don't have to try to break it all down figure it all out but God has asking asking you to live it to believe it to declare it into a dying generation that he is still the same he is still in effect he is still the god that moves he's still a God that does Miracles he's still a God that does mighty Works he's not doing in the Corporal body today but he's doing in the body of his bride and he's hearing you and I and the works that I do shall you do also you ain't got to try to figure it all out you just got to believe it and put it in process and God will do the rest right now Webster would tell us an ambassador is a minister of the highest rank employed by one Prince or state at the court of another two manage the concerns of his own Prince or state and representing the dignity and the power of His Sovereign he is sent to do what the Sovereign would himself if he was present you are an ambassador you were sent here in this age to do exactly what he would do if he was here himself that's exactly right see they are sent to make known the will of The Sovereign and to negotiate the matters of Commerce of War of peace and in general everything affecting the interest of the Sovereign among the people whom they are sent so we don't come with our own agenda we don't come with our own ideas we don't come with our own intellects but we come with the message from the King that the same things he did when when he was here in the physical form are we are to do as well don't ever let the devil talk you out of who you are now I've been preaching on that if you can understand exactly who you are then the devil the powers of Hell will be defenseless so you say brother Joe what do you mean we will finish it I mean we will finish it but you know a lot of times we want to put it on somebody El we want somebody to do the work for us come on let's just be honest sometimes it's too much to bear the load sometimes it's too much to carry the weight sometimes it's too much to get on our knees and pray yeah you know sometimes we can pray for somebody else more than we even pray for our own our own selves and our own needs because it seems like the faith would rise up for somebody else more so than have faith for God in your trial and your situation and brother Brandon tell us here now when God when when Jesus was on the cross and he bowed his head and died and he said it is finished the entire Plan of Redemption was finished right there every soul that would ever be saved was finished right there every sickness that ever would be uh that would anybody would ever have every Cancer that would ever be delivered everything that he did he did it right there when he bowed his head and died but I also want you to know that they question or maybe not question but Paul will tell us that he that began the good work will perform it he will finish it because you and I sometimes we wonder when will God finish this when will God do what he says he will do but Paul is telling us he's come back to tell you again today he will finish it and I'm here to tell you tonight or this morning rather we will finish it it won't be a man it won't be an idea it won't be a denomination but it will be the same savior working in and through his body in and through his body performing the same Works believing the same work and ministering the same miraculous Supernatural power and we will finish this work thank you Lord he said when the Great Shepherd was smitten the great sheep sheep Shepherd Prophet when he was smitten back there he said it is finished and that minute as soon as this Shepherd was smitten it was over sin was settled there was no more more sin they were clean the penalty was paid the Believers whose names were written in the Book of Life predestinated from before the foundation of the world it was finished the very minute that Jesus said it was finished he the great shepherd He had come for his sheep he it was finished God's right hand was pulled from his bosom smitten then on Easter he returned it amen raised it up again to his bosom and he he extended it down to you and I in the form of his word to redeem us back to the original Garden from which we came so tonight we or this morning rather we want to speak on he will finish it so Jesus had a work to do when he was here yeah and just as he had a work to do so do we as the bride have a work to do so he finished what was allotted for him him yes and we're going to finish what's allotted for us Revelations 19 and verse 6 and I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude and a voice of many Waters and is a voice of many mighty Thunder and saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice so right there we have a reason to be glad we have a right to Rejoice let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready that there that phrase made herself ready means to make the necessary preparations yeah now how many of you married this morning now let me see the ladies how many of you ladies are married you didn't just go into that marriage without preparations did you no you started as a little six-year-old girl you knew who exactly who you was going to marry you knew exactly who was going to be your bridesmaids you knew exactly who were going to be the the that he was going to have you knew everything got it all figured out the dress you're going to wear where you going to have it the colors that you're going to have you had it all you made all the necessary preparations for that special day and so what am I telling you the prophet of God we find here he says now the bride has made herself ready she's not sitting back idle doing nothing just waiting hoping that this time is going to come but she's putting forth the effort to make sure that she's going to be prepared for her wedding day that she's going to be dressed not in her own self but she's going to be dressed robed in his righteousness she's going to have the mind of God she's goingon to have the character of Christ she's going to have the same attributes that he possessed she's going to posess and she's made herself ready why because the marriage is about to take place yes God is taking home a bride God is taking a wife to himself notice here in in verse eight it says and to her was granted that word granted means furnished supplied to her was endued that she should be arrayed and fine linen clean and white for the linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb that word called is the Greek word Calo I want you to realize this is a special word here it means to Bear a name to Bear a title see we have been given furnished endued with the right to bear the title not a message not a Pentecost not a method or or Presbyterian or message but we have been given the right to bear the title bride there was a lot of young sisters when I came in this message all right Brothers there was a lot of young sisters you had choice you we call it pick of the litter right not sure how big the litter was but anyway you had a choice you could choose and you be begin to choose you begin to look you begin to evaluate does that person match what's inside of me will that make me a wife will does that person have the character that I'm looking for to be my wife to raise my children and so we find mind here that you have been given the right to bear the title so when I ask my wife Jess sha at the time to marry me she was being she's given the right right there to Bear the title of Miss Joe Adams and so what am I tell telling you is that we have been given the special privilege it's not for everybody look I didn't marry every young girl in the church I married one I chose one in the same way with Christ me many are out there but he's only choosing one and you were chosen in him to Bear the title of Miss Jesus Christ that's right called out called unto the marriage of the Lamb here he says now the word church means called out and Moses as Moses called a nation out of a Nation the holy spirit is calling a bride out of a church a church out of a church members from every denomination making up a bride the bride tree he said and the bride coming out the call now he said the bride tree it is that the bride rather is the one that's going to be in the Rapture in that alone nothing but the bride the elected ones forn by God from the beginning of the father's spiritual genes right don't you see this place you firmly in the plan of God yes so when Satan comes he's got another leg to stand on because now you see you've been given a name you've been given the opportunity or the privilege you've been furnished he's done it he's done it for you he's given you everything that you need so that you can bear his name yeah we find Revelations 2 and verse1 17 that says he that hath an ear now we spoke on that the last couple nights he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to e of the Hidden mana and I will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it all right so each age and we find here in this age each age that listened to the voice each age that listened to the Angel's message was promised a reward yeah to each one of that age that overcame they were promised a reward they were promised to to overcome that they will be given something and age was given to eat of the Hidden mana and now brother B would tell us in questions and answers he says Jesus is the hidden Mana Christ is the church's Mana yeah so we're not feeding on man's idea brother Thomas but we're feeding on the never failing body word of the son of man and it doesn't fail today he's still the same the word still the same the promises are still the F the same they're still in effect and you can call on God anytime and and procure that to yourself and get your desires some of you came last night with great needs but I want you to know you came with great needs and God have responded in it you may not feel any different you may have walked out feeling the same but I want you to know we evoked the name of Jesus last night and God's going to take care of it and we will finish it some of you need a baptism of the Holy Ghost raise your hands God we'll finish it you will receive it because it's a promise unto you and to your children and to your children's children even un to them that are far off God will do what his word says He will do yes yes you will notice now now in the New Testament what was the Mana he says a little while the world seeth me no more it's hidden but yet you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world and Christ is that hidden man that comes from God out of Heaven every day fresh a new blessing a new something coming from God and the hidden Mana coming down from God out of heaven and we Feast upon the Mana which is Christ and he sustains us through the Journey till we reach the land the other side so we know that the Overcomers of the leoan age receives all the rewards from the previous ages so we get to eat of the tree of life we are not going to be hurt by the second death we get to eat of the Hidden Mana we got power over the Nations we're going to be clothed in white rment and we get to sit with him in his throne so to the Overcomer has been given the rights to Feast on the Hidden Mysteries yeah Hidden Mysteries that's right sages and Prophets and great men have longed to hear what we're privileged to hear but it was only entitled to a special people it's not to say that they're not part of that body it's not to say they're not part of that that work that the that the Bride of the previous six ages just were not part of it yes they are part of it they received the Revelation for their age but we receive a greater Revelation in this age we get to perceive of the Hidden Mysteries because in this Sage it's the sounding of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be finished all all those loose sins from the previous ages have now been tied up that's right and we have a perfect message a perfect word we don't need to put our own ideas into it it's perfect we don't need to ingest any kind of denominational view into it it's perfect notice here he says now we've been given the right to receive of the mysteries of God the hidden Mana that's been revealed to the Overcomer so it's hidden but it's going to be revealed to the Overcomer given to the Overcomer and we find here and this Overcomer is going to get to you know the hidden mana and also he's going to be given a white stone what does that white represent Purity yeah and stone represents Revelation so he's going to get a pure revelation of who he is yeah you follow on this this morning yes so it's a why it's a revelation nobody he asked Peter Peter who do men say that I am and we went through this last night see it was a revelation that Peter caught from God that he was the Christ and it's the same Revelation that we get from God that this word is Christ it's not some man's idea it's not something that been set on the shelf for years but it's the it's the it's the body word of the son of man who's come back in this day and now he's injecting himself into a body a multi-member body performing the same signs the same wonders doing the same works and bringing forth the same Promises of God each and everything the same only thing different is the corpal body but what he did in Jesus he's going to finish in the bride and I'm here to declare to you we will finish this fight we get a white a pure Revelation it's not tainted by ideas of man it's not tainted by denominational mindset it's a pure Revelation from God yes there's no way that a seventh grade Kentucky and excuse me for that some of you seventh graders here this morning but can you imagine some of the deep Mysteries that we're preaching today came from a seventh grade Kentucky preacher some boy that can barely read his name and write his name it didn't come from that but it came from almighty God to give a bride a pure revelation of who she is you're no longer Baptist you're no longer Pentecost you're no longer this or that but now you are the Bride of Jesus Christ called by God elected by God anointed by God chosen by God to bear that title yes that's right to bear that name Pride now I trust my wife bears that name in Pride if you don't we got a long ride home tonight but that when you ask and she says I do oh I do I do I do she's happy to Bear your name and when you as the bride said yes I do what you're saying is I'm happy to bear his name I'll bear his scars I'll bear his hurts I'll bear his pains I'll bear his shortcomings I'm happy to bear his name yeah and when I gave my heart to the Lord I was happy to bear that name that's right Paul says I'm not ashamed of the Gospel oh church I'm not ashamed of this message for it is truth it is the reality that God God Is Yet present again among us today and it's not for everybody but it's for you notice here he says the it's only revealed at the excuse me at the last day when the actual seal is broken now he's speaking in the first seal here he goes now broken to who not to Christ but to the church so the Thunder Thunders out it reveals the seal but it's only it's not revealed to Christ he's saying it's revealed to the church he says notice I hope the church truly understands it what I mean you people notice he says I'm going to call your bride so you've been called church for so long you've been called Baptist for so long you've been called Pentecost for so long you've been called you've been labeled this and you bore that title for so long but in this hour God sent a profit and when he begin to break the seals loose and begin to show who we really are he says I'm no longer going to call you a church but now I'm going to call you prde because that's your real name that's your real Revelation and he said in that white stone you get a new name it ain't the name of of Adams it ain't the name of this or that or El in Kentucky or whatever you want to put there but it is the name of Miss Jesus Christ that's your new identity that's who you were that's what God saw you as in the back part of his mind is Miss Jesus Christ I will have a bride she will be without spot she will be without blemish she will be perfect and I know you woke up this morning you didn't look perfect you smell perfect you didn't act perfect but you are perfect because we're perfect by the word notice what he says here this is in why are the people so tossed about the Bible said he that overcometh will I give a white stone and a new name that no man knows but he himself don't make any difference what people say right you know yourself when you've been brought into the inner Veil see as much as we love you and as much as your pastor loves you and brother Brad and the other ministers we they love you they can't tell you you got the Holy Ghost right it's not for us to tell you but when you get that new name cuz with that name comes of Nature and you know it and nobody else has to it ain't for them they can't tell you you ain't got it they can't tell you you do got it but he when you get that new name saving no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it you know that you know that you know when you get it why because your desires change your n changed everything about you changed the things that want to rule you they rule you no more now you rule them why because you received a new name you recognize I don't have to live with this I don't have to be tormented by this I got a new name and with that name I got the authority of my husband and I got the right to to to invoke that name today upon anything that will come against me I have a new name he says a new name a new name written in the rock that nobody knows but himself he who knows who it is see but he can't tell it to no one knows but himself Peter knows he had the keys he said but he didn't go around bragging about it but you know that you know that you know that you know that you know that's right I understand there's going to be times you don't know there's going to be times you question do I have it there's going to be times Satan's in your mind you don't got it you don't have it you don't have it you don't have it you don't have it but there will come a showdown there will come a time that you will know beyond the shadow of a doubt I got the Holy Ghost I got a new name I'm no longer called by my my my natural name but now I've been called I've been placed I have been adopted as a Son of God and a daughter of God and now placed in the family with the new name of Miss Jesus Christ amen that's right notice a white rock and ented a new name not his own name but he's somebody else's oh that only he himself knows he that's got the rock got the Revelation oh come on somebody yeah got the Revelation re come old habits you used to have you don't habit them no more more desires they don't come up anymore why something happened a name took over a title took over a possession took over that's right you know one day my wife she was looking around trying to figure out who she was going to marry but when she said I do it settled it right there she got a new name she quit looking she quit preparing for hey what if this one and what let me tell you when you get a new name it takes all the what if South it takes all the questions out it takes all the doubts out why because you know that you know that you know let me tell he so there's a lot of pretty ladies in here tonight and I ain't trying to be ugly with that but only one of them is going home with me and that's what I'm tell there may be a lot of good people in the world today but there's only one that's going home with them and that's Miss Jesus Christ that is the one that has been given the right to bear the title to bear his name the one that says I do Lord I do I forfeit my rights I forfeit my ideas I forfeit my singleness and I take you at your word I will be Miss Jesus Christ I will let this message live out I will let it flow through me I will let it have control of every aspect of my [Applause] life notice he says what if we got the Pentecostal people today too many Ricks he said that word Elvis and Ricky you never heard that in other days it's a word it's a name for this day and it goes with it he said it's a meaning it means something you say the name means something or you say the name means nothing why did he have to change Abram's name to Abraham notice what God did in Abram God put his own self came down and put an H in Abraham's name or Abraham's name so God has injected himself in Abraham preparing him for that promised son and that's what God does in each and every one of us he come down and places a part of himself in your life so that you can bring forth the promised word of this hour he says why did he change Jacob to Israel not until he wrestled with the Lord he had to overcome and to the Overcomer you get a right to have a new name that's right he says now if the church can overcome she will stop saying I'm Methodist I'm Baptist I'm Presbyterian when she can overcome her Creeds and the worlds that's drawed in her or the of the world that's draw in her there she'll come come back to the Bride of Jesus Christ Miss Jesus Christ yeah and you find it today now we have thunders so we we didn't take the denominational names now we got Thunders peruas Two Souls no souls and we got Elohim and we got the Holy Ghost we got all these different movements in the message but when you take on his name you're not taking on the name of a thunder you're not taking on the name of a peria you're not taking on the name of tusos or return Ministry you're taking on the name of Miss Jesus Christ that's right thank you Lord and brother Brown says and we had the material on Earth today to make ourselves ready don't go outside and dig in the corn field out there and try to find what you need to make yourself ready it's right here everything you need to make yourself ready lays within the pages of this word and 1200 sermons we got everything brother Brown says he says they have all the material on earth now to make themselves ready if you know notice it the Bible says she had made herself ready that means you have a work to do I know some of you don't want to put it all on the preachers put it all on the deacons put it all on the church officials but you have a work to do 1 Corinthians 3 and ver9 says for we are laborers together with God you are God's husbandry 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 58 therefore my beloved Brethren be you steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord so we have a work to do just as Christ had a work that he had to do so does his bride have a work to do we are fellow laborers with him we must be about the father's business we're not here to build kingdoms we're not here to build manss we're here to build the kingdom of God we're here to elevate the name of Jesus Christ we're here to show to a dying generation that he will have a bride and though she may be imperfect in her Humanity she is perfect by the word for the word is placed her in this hour and she will bear that title of Miss Jesus Christ so we must overcome now that's easier said than done yeah very easy overcome takes effort how many of you have overcome oh yeah what is the greatest struggle that you've overcome yourself your greatest adversary is you right your greatest Str Le your greatest accuser is [Music] you and if you can overcome you then you can overcome any obstacle that you face because see you know yourself better than anybody else you know your flaws you know your thoughts you know your shortcomings and if you can overcome so it takes effort to overcome it takes determination to overcome it takes person perseverance look you can't give up you can't be wishy-washy you can't be soft you got to be determined I'm going to serve the Lord no matter what it takes brother B says so many says well if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking and gambling and from lying and stealing I'll serve him let's just throw this in there if the Lord had take this pornography Spirit from me I'll serve him God will take it from you but what you got to do listen to what he says he goes That's overcome and they that overcome shall inherit all things he said but you have the power to do it you must be willing to lay it down yes sir you lay that pack of cigarettes down and watch God go to move and you take you put that alcohol away and you watch God go to moveing you put those bad financial deeds in and ripping people off and cheating people and you commit to God say God I'm going to turn away from this if you watch God God will take it and God will move it in your favor you put that pornography Spirit aside say God I refuse to look at that I refuse to get my eyes to that I refuse to let that be a hindrance in my walk you let God have it you God will show you that he's able to take it from you it's bigger than you are but it ain't bigger than God but God is here to tell you tonight if you lay it down you can overcome and if you overcome then you can herit all things church so you got to make yourself ready you got to make the proper preparations proper preparations prevents poor performance proper preparations prevents poor performance see Abraham was promised he's going to have a child 25 years through his ups and through his downs but he had a name change that guaranteed him the promise yeah and you may have a lot of UPS you may have a lot of downs but when you get a name change yes it guarantees you you're entitled to the promise and for us it's a Rapture for us it's a change of the Body for us it's a millennial Reign it's a marriage supper that's only for the bride yeah I want you to get this this is not for everybody as I said again last night you are a special group of people a prophetic class oh my thank you Jesus notice that now but says in the marriage of the Lamb the same way it is about Divine Healing he said God has got the power to heal you if you got the courage to accept it see God has got the power to heal you because it's already finished but do you have the courage to say yes Lord no matter how long Lord no matter what it takes Lord what happens to my body I believe you're still my healer you're still my deliverer he says notice but you have to fight for every inch that's right now you can tell I don't mind fighting a little bit that's right I don't I was a fighter out there in the world man look I went to a party one time and I'm not glorifying this but I just got to tell you how stupid I am I go to a party I'm 5 foot five at that time I was 5 foot 6 and a half between here and there it's been 30 years I lost a lot of well I lost a lot so we go to this party and I you know I and and and I take on the drinking because that's what we did we drank and we we carried on and party and all that well at the end of the night the biggest guy he had have been El ler he was the biggest guy in the whole party I talent that man to a fight stupid but I didn't care because there was a fighter inside of me and when God got a hold of me he put a fighter on the inside of me and when young people when you come to camps and you come to prayer lines and things like that what is it when I come to pray with you it's not me but it's that fighter on the inside will continue to fight for you and continue to believe for you when you want to give up we're not giving up we're going to press to we're going to fight until God brings the results and the prophet of God say You must fight if you must Reign and he says increase our courage Lord he say I've been in the ministry 30 years and it's been a fight every single day you got to be determined you're G to make through you're GNA work it through you got to be determined I'm GNA fight for the promises of God I'm going to fight for my children I'm going to fight for my healing I'm going to fight for my Deliverance I'm going to fight for the Holy Ghost I'm going to fight for every promise because why because it's our promise it doesn't belong to the enemy it doesn't belong to the Philistines it doesn't belong to the anus it belongs to us as Sons and Daughters of God this word belongs to us the land belongs to us go in church and kick the demons off the land it's your promise it's your word it's your land receive it and we will finish this God has promised you that the land belongs to you go in and take possession of it so this word or this phrase here you got to fight for something how many you ever heard that you got to fight for something or you'll fall for anything yeah so it means to fight in honor of someone or something to struggle to be willing to put yourself in the arena to put yourself In Harm's Way for the cause to go to battle to benefit somebody else to go to battle in the name of someone else the Bible tells us in Matthew 11:12 from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence but the violent the violent taketh by force and that word violent there means those who are forceful and eager in Pursuit eager and forceful to bring forth the promises of God the violent the eager the determined will bring it to pass so we we're going to take possession we got to be willing to fight and you're going to be you're going to be uh you're going to be opposed Satan's going to come against you that's right Satan's going to come against your mind but you have to be determined when Hamas bombed Israel just about last month October 7th I believe it was they sent 2500 missiles into from God a strip into Israel they killed 2500 people they had several wanted hostages what did they do they took tanks and they they bore a hole through the fence there and through the through the wall there between Gaza and Israel and they they came through they had paragliders that flew in from the high side and came in and they begin to destroy man women child mother whatever grandmother grandparent old and young and like they destroyed so why are you saying that brother because Benjamin net and Yahoo began and he came on the press or on the the the news and he said he saids citizens of Israel we didn't start this fight but we will finish it that's right we didn't start this fight but we will finish it and I'm here to declare to you this fight that we're fighting it started in heaven when Lucifer decided he was going to he was going to try to set his kingdom up above the kingdom of God we didn't start this fight but God has got a People God has got an elect in this day and we will finish it Satan you done pick on the wrong one today you picked on more than you can handle because now we're contended for the faith we're contending for the word we will believe it if a prophet of God stood there for 30 years contending for the faith of that you contended for so with the bride of the end time contend for the same Faith contend for the same miraculous power contend for the same Supernatural contend for the same result that the days of Miracles it's not passed but to hear again church Bible days are here again God is still here moving in his body working through his body your Prophet contended that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever he contended against co- foral denominations that said God doesn't do it like he used to do it he contended against the Church of Christ spirit that said the days of Miracles has passed and if he contended shall we contend preachers today don't want you to contend for the supernatural they don't want you to be emotional they don't want you to believe they want you to just press play and Obey but notice let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and the M birth pains he said his wife has made herself ready at the End of the Age there's not another age you are it look around you've been waiting for it you're it yes you're the finality yeah but don't be so happy yeso come on I'm it if I knew I was it man I'm telling you what you are it we're not promis another age we're not promis another Messenger right here lays right now the voice to the final age it ain't raining out through heaven but it's raining here on Earth through Sons and Daughters of God you are the very climax of everything that Jesus was sent to do and you're sent to do the same thing church and we will finish everything that is Promised of a body that is Promised of a bride in this last day we will contend against unbelief we will contend against cancer we will contend against for our children we will contend and we will finish it let me just kind of wrap this up bring this all kind of home here I didn't say I was closing say I'm just going to try to bring it all home here he says the spirit that was in him he sent it back down to the church so the church when this Covenant is brought into full strength when the Covenant is confirmed with God the church the people that goes into this body here to be his bride will be exactly the same spirit that was upon Christ doing the same thing same Ministry same power it will come together and be word by word the same confirming the Covenant so you find men today they don't want you to testify of what God has done or what God has doing then I want you to give glory to God for maybe healing someone of cancer or what God has done the super Supernatural and things like that they said well that takes away from Brother brandham nonsense well that takes away from Christ nonsense see that's not taken away that's giving testimony that the same word that that Christ preached the same word that Paul preached the same word that William Brandon preached is the same word that we preach and it's bringing forth the same results am I telling you I'm telling you that we are proof of the of his victory we are proof today church that the same signs the same wonders the same word will produce the same results yes it's not something sit on the Shelf of yesterday and it doesn't have any power it doesn't have any Authority today it has as much power it has as much Authority today as it ever has because the word will never change we are proof that he hasn't changed brother says God cannot change he's unchangeable God times change people change God is infinite he cannot change he must remain the same yesterday today and forever he must always remain if we believe this to be the word of God we can put our confidence on anything that he said that's right so we are proof of his victory he said the church is his victory victory over sin victory over death victory over drinking victory over whatever it may be we are his victory when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave and they can't keep us in the grave oh Hallelujah he said he took Christ which is a Seed of Abraham on Calvary to him apart he took the spirit off of him put him in his body in the grave and his soul in held raised him up on the third day raised up his body brought it into glory and there he sent the spirit back down and he kept the body on his right hand he said he sent the spirit back down to live in in the church to make the church just so much with the Life of Christ that in the Resurrection the two will come together the bride and the bridegroom the church in Christ will be exactly alike with the same kind of ministry the same kind of power the same kind of spirit he raised up the body of Jesus Christ and set it on the right hand and his right hand and he poured down the spirit upon the church on the day of Pentecost that's how God proved the Covenant yes so the Pentecostal experience today is God proven the Covenant with his people see it's his life being lived out it's his life manifesting and he says in Christ The Mystery of God revealed when the current is Flowing freely the word of God it expresses itself The Works that I do shall you do also and in the last days it shall come to pass behold I'll s s Elijah the prophet and he will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers see it's not the heart of everybody but it's the heart of the children the heart of his children yes that's right he says now there would come time there would come a time forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead the deity through his church to have preeminence in the church and that word preeminent means to have first place that means in his church he's first he's first in everything he's first in importance he's first in honor he's first in exaltation he has the premin in his church he says oh my what the anointed man but now the anointed people yes now the anointed people no longer in a one- man ministry that's right that's right oh now it's in a multi-member body now the anointed people he says anointed by what accepting what Eve turned down Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my spirit my word is spirit see Anointed with the word what Eve turned down he comes back and he's come back through a messenger through a message of this last day and he says he comes back and we accept it yes you believe that yeah Glory can I go on just a little bit longer he said let the F the fundamentalists let the people who deny the power God say it's wrong but the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost yeah so right now in you you had the power to create another world and go live on it think about that you didn't think you was anything Satan told you you was nothing but he says You Got The Power Within you right now to create another world and go live on it see let the fundamentalists let the people who deny the power of God say that it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost men and women it's time that we found out who we are yes see the devil's been trying to hide you back tell you that you're some little coward down something you're not your sons and daughters of God he said deity is not in heaven it's in you amen don't be so happy about having deity deity is not just in heaven but deity is in you right here then if we go on to say notice now he's a creator of all things he made life he made frogs the bees the ducks chickens animals everything that was created and nothing was made but was made by him who Christ the deity he brought down plagues everything in the days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the mouth of lions he quenched the violence of fire he they escape at the edge of the sword he raised the Dead from the grave who Christ he said who is it Christ the deity and he said brother sister that deity is in you today oh H how can you fail how can you not finish what he started well because it's not you no longer doing it it's the de on the inside of you God had taken out old sinful life and he's done away with it and he's come and tabernacled your Humanity did he Tabernacle our Humanity they asked a question would the bride of Christ have a Ministry you got something to do Church got a work to do would the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture he say sure that's what's going on right now see the bride certainly the bride of Christ it's the message of the hour oh hallelujah hallelujah it's the message of the the bride of Christ sure she consists of Apostles and Prophets teachers evangelists pastors is that right that's the bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry it's a great ministry it's a Ministry of the hour yes that's right and the ministry of the bride and the ministry of the Christ of Christ is the same he was saying the world falling apart again he said the church is ready she is sealed in ready to come there will be a big outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the skies amen before he comes there's going to be a big outpouring of the spirit to grab that church to so Elevate her faith yes that between 600 and 9 in the morning some of you are going to be seing those loved ones that's already gone on by the way of the Grave they're G to come walking through and you g to know it's on it's on it's on there ain't no turning back there ain't no giving up we're going to finish it and notice what he says now he says is yet to grab her into the skies exactly because why the church the word the bride Christ his ministry is in his bride which is his body the celestial body you mean the supernatural body here and the spiritual body on the earth see his spirit is in there living his life right out until him and the church becomes one in the wedding they become one he takes them just a little minority in the last days this great big outpouring of the spirit of God signs following the believer yes not just in Elon Kentucky not in M Louisiana not just in our favorite preachers or the well-known preachers that we know but around the world signs are following the believer there's been a great out prodical are coming home yeah that's right sick are being healed hearts are being discerned just couple weeks ago my wife and I were in Belgium and I preached some message there on a Wednesday night and I you know to be honest sometimes you probably know when Lord BL something on your heart and you just fight it you're like Lord why do you want me to preach this why I preach the message on finding forgiveness in the midst of pain because sometimes we have to be able to look deep in our hearts and find forgiveness for those who's wounded us those who's hurt us those who said things are maybe about our family or about situations cuz things can be so tough but we have to be able to find forgiveness in the midst of pain and I spoke that I mean I wor all day like Lord this is not an Evangelistic type service this is kind of more lowkey this is not my style you know but you learn to listen to The Voice and yield to it and anyway I had a brother send me a text when we got home he sent me a message he goes I just wanted to let you know that God used you beyond you could ever imagine last Wednesday night he said this morning a brother in our church ask forgiv foress to the whole church he said the day before you preach he had a meeting with the pastor and today he testified and he said it seemed like brother Joe was in that meeting too he says how the scripture was repeated just exactly like it was the day before he said a lot of lives have been impacted what is that that's not Joe Adams but that's the great outpouring of the spirit of God did those pictures ever come through sister Donna they never came through that's okay I'm going to end right here with this many of you probably seen or heard the testimony of sister Atlanta buts sister lantabus is a precious friend of our family about when she was 39 she was diagnosed with stage four lomic cancer the entire right lung was covered in cancer her husband Brother David buts here is a father with five kids and he's struggling now what do I do what's going to happen what if I lose my wife but in you know and she started taking chemo I think she took two two chemo treatments but and she began to sit in the mezzanine there at the church and in one service it was the end of the service and she was sitting up there brother Thomas and brother Tim began to sing leaning on the Everlasting arm leaning I'm leaning leaning on the Everlasting Arms and just all of a sudden the Revelation struck her that he is in fact the same yesterday today and for he is in fact her healer and she got down from that Meine begin to dance all all around around the church why because God was doing the great outpouring of his spirit and notice the cancer that was going to take her life but she went back to the doctor the next day and within two months she was completely cancer free and today she is cancer free wow because we will finish it oh God has got the faith to heal you he's got the power to heal you if you got the courage to accept it and she took God at his word god you said by your Strife I am healed I'm claiming that today and healing is still her portion healing is still in her life today we had a young girl probably 12 years old Mariah Brit and she had alopecia lost almost all her hair and she came into our youth camp with some bobby pins and she come up to brother Ron Spencer and brother Tim she goes when I get through the other side of this prayer line I want to be able to put these in my hair again now she didn't have a stitch of hair on her head but oh but she believed the word of God she believed that he's the same yesterday and today and forever and today she's got long brown or long black hair she's happily married and she put those bobby pins in what am I telling you I'm telling you it's not the work of a man but it's a great outpouring of the Holy Ghost again he's still the same yesterday today and forever we had a young girl come in our church brother Wayne Lawson was there on a Wednesday night and we just had a prayer line for him and it like we pray for everybody in the church and and and just kept coming and kept coming and kept coming and kept coming and the service went on until the we hours of the of the evening a young girl 16 years old sister kimy wear came up she saids I want my brother saved this young boy grew up in our church started college got into drugs started playing in a rock and roll band doing things he shouldn't do living with a girl different things like that living on his own well he end up moving home and he's staying at the house and now the family's all that church and he looks at his watch and it's late he's laying in bed and you know Mom and Dad ain't home it's 11:00 he jumps up and he looks out the window the neighbors who go to our church they wasn't home it's 11:00 he begin to get scared he begin to think well the Rapture done took place he gets in his trunk drives across town to another church member's house they're not home oh may I may have met missed a Rapture and he gets in his truck and he drives all the way to the church and he wrecks his church in a ditch right before he gets to the house of God but he leaves it there and he comes stumbling into the house of God and he comes to the Altar and he gives his heart to God the very same night that that little sister said I want my brother safe what am I telling you I'm telling you he's still the same church don't give up on the prodical don't give up on your love ones don't give up on your son just have faith and believe we will finish it and we're not going to finish it just C is creeping in and barely getting by we're going to finish it strong we're going to have our shoulders back we're going to be elevated Faith why because it's a great outpouring it's a great outpouring of the Holy Ghost the same signs the same wonders the same power that perform Miracles he's still the same today and I'm going to end with this we had a young couple in our church sister Candace and brother Andrew W or Andrew tner excuse me and we're married seven years couldn't have a baby trying and trying and trying I wish I could had the pictures to show you trying to have a baby trying to have a baby trying to have a baby they she comes up for prayer myself brother Aaron brother Ron brother Tim brother

begin to pray with them in just a few years ago they had little Abigail and she's the cutest little adorable baby how old is she about two years old now a year and a half that's brother David's niece and his great niece see God is still the same Satan says we can't have our children Satan says you can't be free Satan says you're GNA die of that cancer Satan says you can't overcome heart trouble and blood pressure and all that that's just a lie of the enemy but God said I'm going to provide you a great outpouring and we're going to finish this work but because why it ain't you doing it but it's the power of almighty God living in and through his bride performing the same works it's not you it's not the church it's not your favorite preacher but it's almighty God coming down living in that life that life of sin used where sin used to rule it it don't rule it anymore why because the almighty God de has come down and now is no longer you but it's de he living out through you church thank you Lord Jes thank you Lord he said he being the groom to pride has to come forth and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others that spoke of the Bride it can only does anything different than the groom it isn't the bride that's right because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him and if he never was defeated nor will you be defeated brother Josh you ain't going to be defeated you're going to get what you came for because it's your promise we will finish this and God will finish this notice as we end musicians make your way back he says those in the bride only do his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they know that it is it has to be in them doing the works fulfill his own word that he did not complete he says now he did not complete all his work while he was here in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through his bride see she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do a certain thing that he must do now see he's been waiting for this day he's been waiting for your arrival that's right for you to finish amen but he will now he says fulfill through the bride that work which was left for a specific time yeah nobody can take your place no matter what you're going through no matter the trial no matter the situation no matter the doctor's report we will finish he that began the good work will perform it finish it and he's doing it in you he's doing some of you young people some of you young boys some of you young girls who have a heart for God God is doing that that's not the work of a man that's right but that's the work of god let's bow your heads if we just play something softly father how we thank you today Lord that this is not something that we in our own abilities and Humanities have to muster up and try to figure out Lord to come up with all the answers God you see reports from the doctors Lord different ones struggling Lord even now fear trying to set in Lord come against Lord trying to bring fear that what will be will be but father We Believe even now Lord just as you did for sister Len father that there's a great outpouring of the spirit and before the doctors even have to perform medical procedure God you're just as able to remove that situation I'm asking Lord that you'll perform the surgery today supernaturally Lord pray it in the name of Jesus right now Lord you are the same and it's not me speaking but it's the voice of almightyy God speaking today God may you encourage your people that L we can have our young people they can live a Godly life when it looks like the enemy's come in they have no interest in the things of God they have no interest in the word of God Lord in a moment's time you can change all of that just like had it right her boys Lord if we just had the right response to the word Lord I pray tonight or this morning rather Lord even as families when it looks impossible you're still God you're still on the throne and you will do the impossible and you said we can do the impossible if we only believe so Lord we believe today we believe for the healing We Believe for deliverance we believe for prodal We Believe for the healing of families We Believe for healing of marriages Lord you see how the enemy's driven wedges in father and trying to separate a husband and a wife but God I believe today that you could you're the bomb of Gilead that can be applied to that marriage and be applied to that home be applied to that family and bring a much needed healing Lord You're determined to finish but you're going to do it through US you're going to do it through your body you're going to do it through your bride and Lord the word that we have for the church today is we will finish it listen to The Voice listen what he's telling you he that have a near let him hear what the spirit sayth there's a reward to the Overcomer there's a reward to those that refuse to give up there's a reward to those that refuse to give in there's a reward to those that will silence the voice of the enemy so father we just thank you for this time for the church for the people Lord their attendance and their response to the word and father we thank you today that it's not us and our abilities but it's you Lord we just pray for a greater outpouring of your spirit a greater manifestation of your word God for those that came to the altar last night we ask that you just Lord finish it right now fill those with the Holy Ghost deliver
