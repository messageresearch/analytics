[50:45] wonderful the Bible says
[50:48] this who is liken unto thee Oh Lord
[50:52] among the
[50:53] gods who is like thee glorious in
[50:56] Holiness fearful in Praises doing
[51:02] wonders Verse 18 for the Lord shall
[51:06] reign forever and ever for the horse of
[51:10] pharaoh went in with his chariots and
[51:12] with his Horsemen into the sea and the
[51:14] Lord brought again the Waters of the sea
[51:16] upon them but the children of Israel
[51:18] went on dry land in the midst of the Sea
[51:21] and maram the prophetes the sister of
[51:23] Aaron took a timil in her hand and all
[51:25] the women went out after her with
[51:27] timberl and with dances and maram
[51:29] answered them singing answered them sing
[51:32] ye to the Lord for he ha triumphed
[51:34] gloriously and the horse and his rider
[51:37] hath he thrown into the sea so Moses
[51:40] brought Israel from the Red Sea and they
[51:42] went out into the Wilderness of shur and
[51:45] they went three days in the wilderness
[51:46] and found no
[51:49] water and when they came to morah they
[51:51] could not drink of the Waters of morah
[51:53] for they were bitter therefore they the
[51:56] name of it was called morah and the
[51:59] people murmured against Moses saying
[52:02] what shall we
[52:03] drink and he cried unto the Lord and the
[52:06] Lord showed him a tree when he had cast
[52:08] down into the waters the waters were
[52:10] made sweet and there he made for them a
[52:12] statue and an ordinance and there he
[52:16] proved them and he said if thou will
[52:19] diligently hearken to the voice of the
[52:21] Lord thy God and will do that which is
[52:24] right in his sight and will give ear to
[52:26] his Commandments and keep all his
[52:29] statues not just the ones you want to
[52:32] but all his statues I will put none of
[52:35] these diseases upon thee which I have
[52:37] brought upon the
[52:39] Egyptians for I am the Lord that Health
[52:43] thee let us bow our heads I want to
[52:46] speak to you for a few minutes this
[52:48] morning on in a Barren
[52:52] land Heavenly Father
[52:56] Lord as we bow in your presence this
[53:00] morning we are so grateful in our hearts
[53:04] Lord for all that you have done for
[53:08] us where it's written that while we were
[53:10] yet sinners you died for us Lord I I
[53:15] pray as we've gathered here on this cold
[53:18] wintery day that you would bless each
[53:21] one who's made the effort to come and
[53:23] those that wanted to and not able that
[53:25] may be streaming may you bless them also
[53:28] Lord we pray father God we know that in
[53:31] a Congregation of two or three there's
[53:33] needs and Lord no doubt in a
[53:35] congregation this size there's many
[53:37] needs but none of them are greater than
[53:40] you so Lord we don't look to their needs
[53:43] but we look to the god who's able to do
[53:45] something about it and I pray this
[53:47] morning Lord may your spirit come and
[53:49] strike every heart Lord let a Revival
[53:52] break out in every home Lord and shake
[53:54] this community once more for the glory
[53:56] of God lord may we search and strive to
[54:00] find that lost
[54:01] seed we know Lord that when that last
[54:04] one comes in you'll close the book and
[54:06] call your bride and Lord truly we're
[54:09] living in the hour lord of the
[54:11] manifestation of the sons of God may you
[54:14] come Lord and prove your word once more
[54:17] because we love you Lord and we believe
[54:19] you we commit these things into your
[54:21] hands Lord today and those that are
[54:23] traveling the end of the service and
[54:25] going back home pray Lord for each one
[54:27] that they would make it safely Lord we
[54:30] commit these things into your hands For
[54:31] Your Glory in Jesus name and the bride
[54:35] says God bless you you may be
[54:39] seated in our opening scripture this
[54:42] morning it opens with a declaration of
[54:45] just how great our God is and I'd like
[54:49] to say this morning amen because he is
[54:53] there is no God like our God there's
[54:57] many gods in the world today how many
[54:59] gods does the Hindu have and you know
[55:01] people will make a God out of their car
[55:02] or make a God out of their job there's
[55:05] all kinds of gods in the world today but
[55:07] there is no God like our
[55:09] God the Bible says this remember the
[55:12] formal things of old for I am God and
[55:14] there is none else I am God and there is
[55:17] none like me he is the true and living
[55:21] God I said he's the true and living God
[55:26] you know I heard Brother David Siler say
[55:28] one time that he was over in India he
[55:30] said he saw a man take a piece of wood I
[55:32] believe it was and fashion out of God
[55:34] out of this wood and he set the wood
[55:37] down and began to worship a God that he
[55:39] made with his hands and Brother David
[55:42] said as I watched him there he said I
[55:43] begin to think I'm so glad that I do not
[55:46] serve a God that I made with my hands
[55:49] but I serve a God who made me with his
[55:53] hands amen I am so glad this
[55:58] morning that the God we serve is not a
[56:01] dead God of stone or a dead God of wood
[56:03] or a dead God of brass that we would
[56:05] pray to and cry out to but he has no
[56:08] ability to answer back he has no ability
[56:10] to heal or to deliver us or a god of
[56:13] someone's imagination but I am so glad
[56:15] this morning that we serve a God who has
[56:18] the ability to answer back we serve the
[56:22] Living God this morning he is Almighty
[56:25] he is all powerful he is full of Mercy
[56:28] he is
[56:30] love amen and this God that we serve
[56:33] this morning we know his name amen we
[56:36] can cry out to him and he hears our cry
[56:38] and he sees our tears and our God has
[56:41] the ability to answer
[56:45] back Jeremiah 33:3 says it this way call
[56:49] unto me and I will not maybe not hope so
[56:53] not could be but I will answer thee and
[56:56] show thee Great and Mighty things which
[56:59] thou knowest
[57:01] not that's the God we serve this morning
[57:04] no situation no circumstance can stop
[57:06] him from answering you
[57:09] [Applause]
[57:10] back
[57:12] amen you know I think of Jonah think
[57:16] about this this morning Jonah in the
[57:18] belly of a whale a man who had more
[57:22] symptoms more circumstances against him
[57:24] than any man I know
[57:27] anybody here ever been swallowed by a
[57:29] fish Jonah was swallowed by a fish and
[57:35] you know the fish when they eat they
[57:36] always go to the bottom of the fish bow
[57:39] and this fish just swaddled a 6 foot 200
[57:42] pound man so Not only was he in the
[57:45] fish's belly but he was at the bottom of
[57:47] the sea in a fish's
[57:49] belly oh
[57:51] God and Jonah said I prayed unto the
[57:55] Lord out of the fish's belly I cried by
[57:58] the reason of my Affliction unto the
[58:00] Lord and he heard me out of the belly of
[58:05] Hell cried I and thou heardest my voice
[58:08] and I say if God can hear a man's voice
[58:11] in the belly of a wh at the bottom of
[58:13] the sea how much more can you hear your
[58:15] voice this morning in a building that's
[58:17] been set aside to worship
[58:20] Him amen David said in Psalms in my
[58:24] distress I called unto the Lord I Cried
[58:26] unto my God and he heard my voice out of
[58:30] his Temple and My Cry came before him
[58:33] even into his ears who is like unto thee
[58:36] Oh Lord among the gods who is like thee
[58:41] glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises
[58:46] doing wonders and let me say wonders he
[58:50] did when he went down to Egypt he
[58:53] brought his children out of bondage with
[58:55] a Mighty hand he trumped every one of
[58:59] the Egyptian gods and proved every one
[59:01] of their gods was a dead God the
[59:04] Egyptians served a God by the name of
[59:06] raw the god of son and God brought
[59:09] Darkness upon Egypt for three days but
[59:11] their God could not take it back
[59:14] Hallelujah showing that their God was a
[59:16] god of imagination but he was the true
[59:19] God and when he brought his children out
[59:21] of bondage he broke the chains of
[59:23] Oppression he broke the chains of come
[59:25] on somebody he broke the chain and he
[59:27] drowned Pharaoh's Army in the
[59:30] sea
[59:33] hallelujah hallelujah when he went down
[59:36] to Egypt and let me say when God comes
[59:38] to your Egypt he'll break the chains of
[59:41] Oppression he'll break the chains of
[59:43] depression he'll break the chains of
[59:45] sickness Hallelujah and he'll bring us
[59:48] out for because he said I am the Lord
[59:51] thy God that delivered me he proved
[59:54] every one of the Egyptians Gods was dead
[59:57] and that he was the true and living God
[59:59] and he delivered his people and when
[1:00:02] Mariam saw her enemy was dead she got
[1:00:07] into the spirit grabbed a tambourine and
[1:00:10] up and down the bank she went shouting
[1:00:12] and singing and praising God that's the
[1:00:14] kind of church I want to be in don't
[1:00:16] give me some dead dried up church I want
[1:00:19] a god with life in it
[1:00:21] amen
[1:00:24] hallelujah amen
[1:00:27] there laid their dead there laid the
[1:00:29] ones who had beat them and abused them
[1:00:32] laying dead the ones that had bothered
[1:00:34] them and seeing them defeated it was
[1:00:37] time to

[1:01:06] rapture we have a pillar of fire we have
[1:01:09] a prophet messenger and The God Who led
[1:01:11] the first Exodus is leading the Third
[1:01:14] Exodus I say we can shout

[1:01:26] with a defeated enemy sickness is

[1:01:38] conquered
[1:01:42] enemy people come up for prayer and say
[1:01:44] well the devil said this and the devil
[1:01:45] said that and the devil said this you
[1:01:48] are listening to a conquered enemy
[1:01:55] he said Oh Brother D you know that's
[1:01:57] good for brother Bor and that's good for
[1:01:59] brother pal but but I'm the least one in
[1:02:02] the
[1:02:03] church well I really appreciate your
[1:02:08] humility and you know we're a body of
[1:02:10] Believers is that true and the body's
[1:02:12] made up of many different things I'm so
[1:02:14] glad my whole body ain't my
[1:02:18] thumb there's all kinds of parts of your
[1:02:20] body that makes up the body and so maybe
[1:02:23] I am maybe that's exactly who I am
[1:02:26] brother Brett is that little crease at
[1:02:29] the little toe that attaches to the foot
[1:02:32] maybe that's the part of the body I
[1:02:38] am but if that's who I am guess what
[1:02:42] every devil is still under my
[1:02:46] feet
[1:02:48] amen you say brother Bren I'm out the
[1:02:50] least one that's the soulle of his feet

[1:03:34] keep you long this morning I'll preach
[1:03:35] fast you amen fast we get
[1:03:37] done but think about this the Bible said
[1:03:40] when he parted the Red Sea his children
[1:03:42] went over on dry
[1:03:46] ground is that right well up where I'm
[1:03:49] from there's a Wataga Lake and many year
[1:03:51] ago when they built that Lake up there
[1:03:53] they built the dam they backed up the
[1:03:55] water for the river there and they
[1:03:57] flooded a city called
[1:03:59] Butler and they went in and tore down
[1:04:01] all the houses but they left one
[1:04:02] building why they left it I don't know
[1:04:04] but they left the old jail there now how
[1:04:07] long this Lake had 40 maybe 50 years at
[1:04:10] the most and they had a leak in the dam
[1:04:13] so they had to let all the water out so
[1:04:15] they could fix the leak the damage well
[1:04:18] when they let the water out the old town
[1:04:20] of Butler resurfaced and the TVA went in
[1:04:23] with bulldozers and bulldozed out the
[1:04:25] old roads so people could go in and see
[1:04:28] the Old Town some of the ones that lived
[1:04:29] there well me and my brothers we went
[1:04:32] there and I was walking down the road
[1:04:34] that they had graded out and I saw that
[1:04:38] gel and I wanted to look in it mistake
[1:04:41] number
[1:04:42] one when I stepped off of that grad Road
[1:04:46] into that mud I sunk up to my calves I
[1:04:50] thought my brothers were going to pull
[1:04:51] my feet off tried to get me out of that
[1:04:53] mud now how long that had been there
[1:04:56] maybe 50 years at the most how long the
[1:04:58] Red Sea had been here I don't know but
[1:05:00] when oh God hallelujah when God parted
[1:05:03] the water he dried up the ground you
[1:05:05] know why cuz he did not even want his
[1:05:08] children's feet to get
[1:05:11] muddy
[1:05:13] hallelujah
[1:05:15] hallelujah and after this great victory
[1:05:18] of shouting and praising God now they're
[1:05:22] on their journey and here they go
[1:05:24] through the wilderness on their Journey
[1:05:27] marching following the message of the
[1:05:29] Prophet following the pillar of fire on
[1:05:31] their way to the promised land that God
[1:05:34] done said was
[1:05:35] theirs to a God who can't
[1:05:38] fail huh being led by a God who can't
[1:05:41] fail the three days into the journey
[1:05:44] they find their first
[1:05:48] test they find theel in a desert place
[1:05:53] in a Barren land
[1:05:56] with no
[1:05:58] water three days they marched all the
[1:06:01] families all the cattles remember they
[1:06:03] took everything with them the mules
[1:06:06] everything a single day in the
[1:06:07] wilderness without water may be
[1:06:09] tolerable two days would be difficult
[1:06:12] but three days would be almost
[1:06:17] impossible think about it after three
[1:06:20] days of no
[1:06:22] water especially for the children and
[1:06:26] for the
[1:06:27] animals and after three days someone up
[1:06:30] ahead yells
[1:06:32] water there's
[1:06:35] water and the Animals begin to smell it
[1:06:38] perhaps begin to break ranks and the
[1:06:40] children begin to run and whoever got
[1:06:42] there first they just fell
[1:06:48] in get back get back get the kids back
[1:06:53] what's the
[1:06:54] matter we
[1:06:56] can't drink
[1:06:59] it think about it 3 days with no water
[1:07:04] you would about drink
[1:07:08] anything but God made the water so
[1:07:12] bitter that they could not drink it and
[1:07:17] sometimes God will make a trial so
[1:07:21] hard it'll make the water so bitter that
[1:07:25] you can't can't expect nothing less than
[1:07:27] a
[1:07:29] miracle he will make the water so bitter
[1:07:32] that you would look nowhere
[1:07:34] else but to him you see where are people
[1:07:38] who wants
[1:07:39] miracles signs and wonders
[1:07:43] Miracles but you can't have a miracle
[1:07:46] unless you got a
[1:07:49] problem people want Miracles but they
[1:07:52] don't want no problems but here they are
[1:07:55] in a great trial they have a great
[1:07:59] problem but they serve a great
[1:08:02] God think about it the disappointment of
[1:08:05] finding water to realize it's bitter
[1:08:08] would only make the situation worse to
[1:08:11] be so thirsty for so dry dust from the
[1:08:14] desert the sweat the weariness to find
[1:08:17] water in it be so
[1:08:20] bitter that you can't drink it to hear
[1:08:24] the children say mama please please mama
[1:08:27] let me let me have some of that water no
[1:08:30] honey mama can't give you that water
[1:08:33] mama can't let you drink
[1:08:35] it it's too
[1:08:38] bitter why would he do
[1:08:41] that why would he lead us to water and
[1:08:43] it'd be
[1:08:44] bitter we're his people we follow his
[1:08:47] message we listen to Moses why the
[1:08:50] bitter water and they cried
[1:08:53] M and they named the place face the land
[1:08:56] of bitter
[1:08:59] water just three days before they were
[1:09:02] singing shouting dancing praising
[1:09:06] God now the same voices that praised him
[1:09:10] and honored him and danced before him
[1:09:13] now those same voices was murmuring and
[1:09:16] complaining and scared and
[1:09:19] upset how soon they
[1:09:22] forgot the Red Sea
[1:09:27] Revival how quickly their countenance
[1:09:29] changed when they arrived in Mora the
[1:09:32] bitter land the barren bitter land how
[1:09:38] quickly their countenance
[1:09:40] changed when they
[1:09:42] arrived in the bitter land and it's in
[1:09:45] those moments it's in those moments when
[1:09:48] the doctor says I'm sorry when you lose
[1:09:51] your job when bitterness comes into your
[1:09:53] marriage disappointments and situ ation
[1:09:55] turns against you it's them times that
[1:09:59] Satan likes to take advantage of it and
[1:10:02] start spewing his
[1:10:04] lies you say lies well he's the father
[1:10:07] of
[1:10:09] it and can you imagine the lies that he
[1:10:13] tempted to overtake these kids with
[1:10:15] these children God's children I can
[1:10:18] almost hear it in my mind when he come
[1:10:20] to them and said this God of yours
[1:10:23] delivered you out of Egypt are sure they
[1:10:25] beat you and abused you but at least you
[1:10:27] had food at least you had water now he
[1:10:30] brought you out here you ain't got no
[1:10:32] water to leave you three days in the
[1:10:35] desert to die and temp you with water
[1:10:37] that you can't even drink some God you
[1:10:40] serve some cruel
[1:10:44] God and it's in that moment it's in that
[1:10:47] moment when every fear
[1:10:50] surfaces and all they
[1:10:53] saw was death
[1:10:56] it was a bitter situation
[1:11:00] indeed but you see the devil want you to
[1:11:03] see the X-ray he only wants you to see
[1:11:05] the MRI he only wants you to see the
[1:11:07] drug addiction the marital situation the
[1:11:10] fear the pain the No Way Out situation
[1:11:12] he wants you to see the
[1:11:15] storm but not the
[1:11:18] sun you know I flew the other day I was
[1:11:20] flying somewhere to preach got into a
[1:11:23] terrible storm I've been in many a plane
[1:11:25] where
[1:11:25] I have never been in one like this this
[1:11:27] plane was reeling and a
[1:11:29] rocking people were screaming kids were
[1:11:32] crying people praying that's one of
[1:11:43] them so finally we landed down in
[1:11:46] Charlotte and was going to take off
[1:11:48] again but they made us wait for over an
[1:11:51] hour we sat out there on that plane
[1:11:52] waiting for the storm to pass over that
[1:11:54] we could leave and Fin finally we got a
[1:11:55] green light to go and we took off and
[1:11:57] when that plane climbed here we went
[1:11:59] again reeling and rocking and a dropping
[1:12:01] and a jumping clouds everywhere but all
[1:12:04] at once we broke through the clouds and
[1:12:06] when we did guess what I
[1:12:08] saw the sun it was there the whole time
[1:12:14] it was there the whole time the storm
[1:12:16] the wind the clouds the rain it did not
[1:12:19] stop that son
[1:12:20] [Applause]
[1:12:23] amen amen think about that
[1:12:26] to notice the Red Sea was a water
[1:12:31] problem is that true and God moved for
[1:12:34] that water
[1:12:36] problem then if God can fix one water
[1:12:39] problem he can fix all water
[1:12:44] problems amen you see the Red Sea and
[1:12:47] the bitter water was both water
[1:12:51] problems but if God can heal one water
[1:12:53] problem he can heal any water problem if
[1:12:56] God can heal cancer of the skin he can
[1:12:58] heal cancer of the bone cancer of the
[1:13:00] liver cancer of the brain cancer of the
[1:13:02] breast come on somebody if he can bring
[1:13:04] one prodical home if he can bring one
[1:13:06] prodical home he can bring all prodical
[1:13:11] home if he could fix one marriage he can
[1:13:14] fix
[1:13:15] yours if he delivered you once anybody
[1:13:18] ever been delivered by God if he done it
[1:13:22] once cannot he do it again
[1:13:25] I say yes he can I say yes he
[1:13:31] can
[1:13:35] Hallelujah but all they saw was
[1:13:37] death bitter undrinkable water in a
[1:13:42] Barren land and the people remembered
[1:13:45] against Moses saying what shall we drink
[1:13:49] you see God was leading him to the
[1:13:51] promised land that he said was NS as far
[1:13:54] as God was concerned they was already
[1:13:56] there for he told Moses when you bring
[1:13:58] them out you shall worship me upon this
[1:14:01] mountain so as far as God was concerned
[1:14:04] it's already
[1:14:06] done the Battle Is Over the victory is
[1:14:10] won it's all already
[1:14:13] done so God was leading him to this
[1:14:16] promise that that he said was THS why
[1:14:18] wouldn't he Bass the land of
[1:14:22] bitterness why take him to a bitter land
[1:14:25] land if he's done gave him a promised
[1:14:28] land looks like he would have bypassed
[1:14:31] it but he let him right straight to the
[1:14:33] bitter water you see where the
[1:14:36] Israelites didn't see a way God did he
[1:14:40] was the way the test for the Israelites
[1:14:43] was a question of
[1:14:45] faith believing what they couldn't
[1:14:48] see you see the Bible says we walk by
[1:14:51] faith and not by
[1:14:53] sight you can't can't walk by both at
[1:14:56] the same time you either walk with what
[1:14:58] you see with the eyes of your head what
[1:14:59] you see with the eyes of your heart but
[1:15:02] you can't walk by both at the same time
[1:15:04] you see the devil chose to use your eyes
[1:15:06] what he can show you with your eyes but
[1:15:08] God never chose the eyes of your head he
[1:15:11] chose the eyes of your heart look the
[1:15:15] Unseen oh thank you
[1:15:18] Jesus
[1:15:20] amen amen where they didn't see the way
[1:15:23] he was the way
[1:15:25] it was a question of faith without the
[1:15:28] bitter water there would have been no
[1:15:31] opportunity for God to perform a miracle
[1:15:34] that day the most difficult situations
[1:15:37] in our lives are
[1:15:40] opportunity for God to do the miraculous
[1:15:44] to turn our bitter situations sweet to
[1:15:48] show us just how great he
[1:15:52] is you see God could say I'm your healer
[1:15:55] I'm your deliverer and we'd say yes Lord
[1:15:58] yes Lord intellectual conception but God
[1:16:00] don't want us to know him by knowledge
[1:16:03] he wants us to know him
[1:16:05] by faith thank
[1:16:09] you so he could said I'm the god of heal
[1:16:12] yes
[1:16:13] Lord head
[1:16:16] knowledge but he wants you to know it by
[1:16:21] faith let me show
[1:16:23] you I think I've told this before but it
[1:16:25] just come to my mind when my little girl
[1:16:28] Jessica you know the story she hit by
[1:16:29] the train left blind and all the and her
[1:16:32] eyes came open one day God gave us gave
[1:16:34] her back to
[1:16:35] us and so a person heard that I had told
[1:16:39] her that she'd see me again because God
[1:16:41] provided a lamb for her eyes because in
[1:16:42] the Bible days they used a lamb for a c
[1:16:44] and ey animal like they use a dog today
[1:16:47] and I said God provided a lamb for your
[1:16:48] eyes you'll see me again and one day our
[1:16:50] eyes come open and somebody heard about
[1:16:52] the story and they bought Jessica a
[1:16:55] lamb well the J the the lamb was
[1:17:00] free but the electric fence cost about
[1:17:02] 200
[1:17:05] bucks so I put this fence up and I put
[1:17:07] the lamb in it and I told Jessica I said
[1:17:09] now Jessica this wire right here is hot
[1:17:12] if you touch it it'll burn you
[1:17:14] understand yes daddy intellectual
[1:17:18] conception so I was over in the field
[1:17:20] working on a tractor that backslid on me
[1:17:23] and I was looked and here she came down
[1:17:24] out into the backyard where the fence
[1:17:26] was I saw her going to it and I was just
[1:17:28] watching and all of a sudden she grabbed
[1:17:30] a hold of that
[1:17:35] wire so I climbed through the fence and
[1:17:37] I went over to where she was I'll never
[1:17:38] forget it she's about six seven year old
[1:17:41] she looked at me the big old blue eyes
[1:17:42] and had her hand just like this I can
[1:17:44] still see it in my mind and she looked
[1:17:46] up at me tears coming down off of her
[1:17:47] cheeks she said don't touch that wire
[1:17:49] Daddy it's
[1:17:52] hot you see before it was me telling her
[1:17:56] but after she experienced
[1:17:59] it it was her telling me and that's the
[1:18:02] way it is with God Amen he wants you to
[1:18:04] experience it so you can say my God is a
[1:18:07] great God my God Is A Healer my God is a
[1:18:11] deliverer amen that's my
[1:18:14] God there is no God like my
[1:18:18] God not by head knowledge I know it by
[1:18:23] experience hey
[1:18:27] amen I've seen him make the lame walk
[1:18:29] I've seen him open blinded eyes there is
[1:18:32] nothing that my God can't
[1:18:36] do amen and the murmurings and the
[1:18:39] complainings of these
[1:18:42] Israelites against God made Moses cry
[1:18:46] out to God you see if you want your
[1:18:49] Barren lands if you want your bitter
[1:18:51] Waters turn sweet
[1:18:54] then take the case To God In
[1:18:58] Prayer because prayer is the greatest
[1:19:01] weapon that's ever been placed into the
[1:19:04] hand of the
[1:19:05] believer man nor demon can stand before
[1:19:10] prayer that's why the devil tries so
[1:19:13] hard to stop
[1:19:15] us from praying you can go all day and
[1:19:19] not get a text and you go to your prayer
[1:19:21] closet and start praying
[1:19:25] huh why because there's something when a
[1:19:28] child of God goes to the father in
[1:19:33] prayer so God begins by making us begin
[1:19:36] the people complained to Moses and Moses
[1:19:39] took the complaint to the master and all
[1:19:41] the trials the surest way to Victory is
[1:19:44] prayer the power of your
[1:19:47] prayer huh the power of your prayer is
[1:19:51] more powerful than an atomic
[1:19:56] bom you know years
[1:19:59] ago as a sister go to our church sister
[1:20:02] clark God rest so sister eth clark she's
[1:20:04] been going for years now but she's my
[1:20:05] Sunday school teacher when I was a
[1:20:06] little boy and my Mom and Daddy backslid
[1:20:09] on the Lord and took us out of church so
[1:20:10] from the time I was about 9 or 10 till I
[1:20:12] was 21 got out of the army I didn't go
[1:20:14] to
[1:20:16] church but I go gave my heart to the
[1:20:18] Lord started going to church and started
[1:20:20] preaching I think around 85 something
[1:20:22] like that 85 86
[1:20:25] and sister clark was sick wasn't able to
[1:20:27] come to church so after church one not
[1:20:29] me and my wife went by to see her went
[1:20:32] into her house this woman you talking
[1:20:34] about living
[1:20:35] holy anytime she place anywhere where
[1:20:38] there was a television she would turn
[1:20:39] her back to it wouldn't watch it we went
[1:20:43] into our house just a simple home sat
[1:20:46] down to talk to her and she said yeah I
[1:20:48] said even when you was a little boy said
[1:20:51] I saw the Lord had you his hand on you
[1:20:53] and said all the years years I prayed
[1:20:56] for
[1:20:57] you and I got in the car and I started
[1:20:59] crying I told my wife I said think about
[1:21:01] that when I was a total idiot running up
[1:21:04] and down the road God had a Godly woman
[1:21:08] praying for
[1:21:10] me you know that mother pray that prayer
[1:21:12] it may circle the Earth for years and
[1:21:15] find you in a barroom and find you in a
[1:21:18] hotel room ready to take your life the
[1:21:20] power of
[1:21:22] prayer more powerful than an atomic bomb
[1:21:25] you know when they dropped that bombb on
[1:21:26] Hiroshima even today there're still
[1:21:29] people having the effects from that bomb
[1:21:32] and that's the power of your prayer you
[1:21:34] see as soon as you have a prayer God has
[1:21:36] a remedy the Bible said he Moses he
[1:21:39] Cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed
[1:21:41] him a tree which he had cast into the
[1:21:43] waters the waters were made sweet and
[1:21:46] there he made for them a statue and an
[1:21:48] ordinance and there he proved him you
[1:21:51] see the answer to their bitterness
[1:21:55] was always
[1:21:57] there before they even knew they had a
[1:22:01] problem the answer was already there
[1:22:05] when they was down in
[1:22:07] bondage the tree was growing beside the
[1:22:13] water before they ever knew it it was
[1:22:16] all ready there you know for several
[1:22:20] years the second week of February I
[1:22:22] always preached down in medidan
[1:22:23] Louisiana and so about November you know
[1:22:25] you try to get your ticket early so you
[1:22:27] can get a better
[1:22:29] price and so I got my ticket about
[1:22:31] November going to preach in February and
[1:22:33] went ahead and got my seat where I
[1:22:34] wanted to sit so the meeting weekend
[1:22:37] rode up and went down to Louisiana

[1:24:21] never owned their Bible and I thought my
[1:24:25] Lord how many do I have at my
[1:24:28] house and I said well sir I I can't
[1:24:30] promise you anything but when I get home
[1:24:32] I said we'll see what we can do so I
[1:24:33] come home I told brother Michael you
[1:24:34] know Michael Bailey my my brother-in-law
[1:24:37] and he was over the Sunday School
[1:24:38] classes so the kids started bringing
[1:24:39] their money in and it wasn't long after
[1:24:41] that that we had enough money to buy
[1:24:43] some Bibles so I called brother Bai he
[1:24:44] was my interpreter and I said you know
[1:24:46] brother Bai I said I was thinking
[1:24:47] instead of buying the Bibles here in the
[1:24:49] US and trying to get them across the
[1:24:50] border and everybody wants a handout by
[1:24:52] time you pay Customs you pay more to get
[1:24:54] the stuff into the country than what you
[1:24:56] paid for the product itself I said maybe
[1:24:58] we could find somebody in Mexico who
[1:25:00] could print the Bibles they did they
[1:25:02] didn't want to let he said just a simple
[1:25:04] paperback Bible said we can give
[1:25:05] everybody in the church a Bible and then
[1:25:07] we can take these Bibles and pass them
[1:25:08] out when we when we witness on the
[1:25:10] street so he said just a simple Bible so
[1:25:13] I told Brother n he said I'll check and
[1:25:15] see so he called back and he said
[1:25:16] brother darl said I found a man here who
[1:25:18] app print the Bibles it said he would
[1:25:20] either do a thous
[1:25:22] 1,7 for the money money we have or he
[1:25:25] would print a th000 have a little bit of
[1:25:26] money left over he said which do you
[1:25:28] want to do and I said just tell him to
[1:25:29] print a th and7 so the the books were
[1:25:32] ready they went and got them they had
[1:25:33] them all in boxes you know and they got
[1:25:35] this big bus you know like a Greyhound
[1:25:37] bus and you let up the doors like this
[1:25:38] and they had all the Bibles underneath
[1:25:40] it and so I flew down to quoo I wanted
[1:25:42] to be there when the brother got the
[1:25:44] Bibles and you know shake his hand and
[1:25:46] and so brother Bai up in the northern
[1:25:47] part of Mexico they got on this bus and
[1:25:49] was heading to the southern part of
[1:25:50] Mexico and they got stopped by Mexican
[1:25:53] soldiers made everybody get off the bus
[1:25:56] if you've ever been in a situation like
[1:25:57] that it's a little bit nervous it
[1:25:59] happened to me in Mexico it happened to
[1:26:01] me in Costa Rica and it happened to me
[1:26:03] in the
[1:26:03] Philippines it makes you just a wee bit
[1:26:06] nervous just to be honest with you but
[1:26:08] they made them get off the bus and so
[1:26:09] they pulled up the doors and when they
[1:26:11] did there was all these boxes and the
[1:26:12] soldier said what's in those boxes and
[1:26:14] brother B I said they're Bibles said
[1:26:16] Bibles he said yes sir he said well what
[1:26:19] are you doing with Bibles you selling
[1:26:20] them said no no we're not selling them
[1:26:21] we're giving them away he said you're
[1:26:23] giving Bibles away he said yes and so
[1:26:26] the soldier said well if you're giving
[1:26:27] them away we want a Bible but but I said
[1:26:30] he said would you give us one he said
[1:26:32] sure said how many of they are you he
[1:26:34] said there's seven of
[1:26:41] us
[1:26:45] amen you know there's some Church of
[1:26:48] Christ come to me one
[1:26:50] time tried to tell me God don't heal no
[1:26:53] more
[1:26:55] and I told him I said if your God Is So
[1:26:57] puny he can't heal I'm sorry but my God
[1:27:01] still heals you've come too late to tell
[1:27:03] me
[1:27:08] that the tree had been growing there for
[1:27:11] years you see the answer to your fears
[1:27:13] the answer to your sickness the answer
[1:27:15] to your problems was here before you
[1:27:19] ever had a problem there's two reports
[1:27:22] before you the doctors report and
[1:27:24] Isaiah's report is that right now let me
[1:27:28] tell you I worked in surgery for 17
[1:27:30] years been in thousands of
[1:27:33] operations and doctors can tell you
[1:27:36] something and they'll be 100%
[1:27:40] correct is that true and doctors can
[1:27:43] tell you something and be 100%
[1:27:48] wrong I mean it is called practicing
[1:27:51] medicine now look I got nothing against
[1:27:53] doctors I just doctor here not long ago
[1:27:55] I had the flu and pneumonia at the same
[1:27:56] time I sure go to doctors but when the
[1:27:59] doctor says he can't help me I know
[1:28:00] somebody who
[1:28:05] can you know and if we believed this
[1:28:08] report as much as we beli the doctor's
[1:28:10] report how much better off would we
[1:28:13] be I am the Lord thy God that Health
[1:28:18] thee amen but I hear what you're
[1:28:22] saying but my problem
[1:28:25] my
[1:28:27] problem you see that's true you know
[1:28:31] whether it's the least problem in the
[1:28:33] church or the greatest problem in the
[1:28:34] church it's still a
[1:28:38] problem and in the problem sometimes we
[1:28:40] may not be able to see the sweet in the
[1:28:43] bitter yet but hold on have faith God
[1:28:48] works all things to good to bring about
[1:28:51] the sweet Romans 8:28 is true friends is
[1:28:55] that all right Romans 8:28 all things
[1:28:58] work to the good that's good and bad
[1:29:01] that's happy and
[1:29:03] sad that's getting the gift certificate
[1:29:06] from Walmart or the transmission falling
[1:29:08] out in the front
[1:29:09] yard all things work to the good and the
[1:29:13] next time you come to your morage
[1:29:14] instead of panicking have faith that the
[1:29:18] god you serve is the god who will turn
[1:29:21] your bitter Waters sweet for the glory
[1:29:23] of of his name in a desert place in a
[1:29:26] Barren land God shows his greatest power
[1:29:29] in a desert place in a Barren land God
[1:29:32] shows his greatest
[1:29:35] Miracles wow God chose them to bring
[1:29:38] them to a place where they had to rely
[1:29:40] upon him and trust him completely
[1:29:44] instead of looking to the Water of Life
[1:29:47] he wanted them to look to him who is
[1:29:50] life you see what I'm saying if they
[1:29:52] come up and drink the water they have
[1:29:54] said Thank You Lord and just went on but
[1:29:55] he made it so
[1:29:59] bit that the only place they could look
[1:30:01] was to
[1:30:04] him do you trust in The God Who deliver
[1:30:07] you to carry you through the Israelites
[1:30:10] didn't see the water they could
[1:30:12] drink but God did God saw the sweet and
[1:30:16] the bitter he's the one that provided
[1:30:19] it in a Barren land God shows his
[1:30:22] greatest power
[1:30:24] going to have just a few more
[1:30:28] minutes now the disciples and the Lord
[1:30:30] they went into the desert to rest and
[1:30:32] somehow word got out and when they got
[1:30:34] in there to rest there was
[1:30:37] thousands
[1:30:39] thousands you know the Bible said he fed
[1:30:42] 5,000 plus women and children and some
[1:30:45] people estimate there was between 11 and
[1:30:48] 15,000 people at this
[1:30:52] meeting and when the day begin to wear
[1:30:54] on and they were weary the disciples
[1:30:56] came to the Lord and said Master send
[1:30:59] them away for we are in a Barren land we
[1:31:01] are in a desert
[1:31:03] place a desert place of wilderness
[1:31:06] desolate lonely uninhabited we are in a
[1:31:11] Barren land send them away that they may
[1:31:14] go into the village that they may find
[1:31:16] some rest that they may find some some
[1:31:18] some some food some
[1:31:21] water and Jesus said
[1:31:24] go among them and find something to feed
[1:31:30] them in a Barren
[1:31:35] land and so they go among the people and
[1:31:37] they find this little boy who has his
[1:31:42] lunch five biscuits I
[1:31:44] believe and two
[1:31:47] fish so they go up this little boy he's
[1:31:49] got this I can just see he's got this
[1:31:51] bag in his
[1:31:52] hand said
[1:31:54] yeah what's in the bag little
[1:31:57] boy it's my
[1:32:00] lunch what you going to do with
[1:32:04] it eat
[1:32:07] it so would you give it to the
[1:32:11] Lord would you give it to the
[1:32:16] Lord what does the Lord want with my
[1:32:20] lunch he wants to
[1:32:22] feed this multi
[1:32:31] dude Jesus wants to feed this
[1:32:35] multitude with my lunch but you see
[1:32:38] little is much if God is in
[1:32:44] it and when he gave Jesus his lunch Look
[1:32:49] what Jesus was able to do with it and we
[1:32:52] keep our problems and we keep our fears
[1:32:54] and we keep this we won't praise the
[1:32:56] lord we won't raise our hand we sit in
[1:32:58] church like we're
[1:33:00] dead but if you give well you know I
[1:33:03] just can't but if you can just raise
[1:33:05] your hand whatever you can give
[1:33:17] him in this desert place they were
[1:33:20] fixing the
[1:33:21] sea just how great they're God was for
[1:33:25] in this Barren land came A great miracle
[1:33:28] when he took a little boy's lunch and
[1:33:31] blessed it and fed the multitude and the
[1:33:34] Bible said if my memory certainly right
[1:33:36] they took up 12 basketfuls of food left
[1:33:40] over after everybody had
[1:33:45] ate they were tired they were weary they
[1:33:47] were hungry and he fed them I can see
[1:33:51] that little boy going home and threw his
[1:33:53] bag up on the counter and his mama said
[1:33:55] why junior didn't you eat said oh mama
[1:33:57] did I
[1:33:58] eat we had
[1:34:03] Wonderbread they were tired they were
[1:34:05] hungry they were weary and he fed them
[1:34:07] the children of Israel they were tired
[1:34:09] and thirsty and he gave them Sweet Water
[1:34:12] let me say this as we're coming to a
[1:34:13] close you may be in a desert place you
[1:34:17] may have arrived in the land of bitter
[1:34:20] Waters but maybe you're there this
[1:34:22] morning maybe maybe you are there this
[1:34:24] morning for your greatest
[1:34:29] miracle in that Barren land in your land
[1:34:32] of morah why don't you do like Moses and
[1:34:36] cry unto the Lord and let God show you
[1:34:39] that the tree has always been there the
[1:34:42] tree has always been there you say what
[1:34:46] tree you talking about brother Daryl
[1:34:48] calvary's tree you see calvary's tree
[1:34:52] holds the answer to every problem Jesus
[1:34:55] was the answer yesterday he's the answer
[1:34:57] today and if there's a tomorrow he will
[1:34:59] be the answer
[1:35:02] tomorrow calvy where he paid the price
[1:35:05] he paid the price to have the ability to
[1:35:08] turn your bitter Waters
[1:35:11] sweet sweet water in a bitter Barren
[1:35:17] land already paid for you hear not long
[1:35:22] ago I was in a
[1:35:25] restaurant and the waitress come by and

[1:35:34] meal I said really she said yes I said

[1:35:39] care of the tip and everything so if
[1:35:40] there's nothing else you can
[1:35:43] go now I could have done one or two
[1:35:45] things I could have said ma'am I don't
[1:35:47] see nobody in this restaurant that I
[1:35:49] know are you sure you're talking about
[1:35:53] me
[1:35:56] I could have argued I could have debated
[1:35:59] I could have said I'm
[1:36:01] unworthy I could have said no no no you
[1:36:03] want me to go out that door so that bail
[1:36:05] will go off and say he sto a
[1:36:09] steak I could have argued I could have
[1:36:11] debated or I could have accepted the
[1:36:14] fact that someone paid the price for my
[1:36:17] supper and walked out with a belly full
[1:36:19] of
[1:36:21] steak is that not true
[1:36:26] so what do you think I
[1:36:28] did said thank you I said Thank you and
[1:36:32] I walked out because the dinner had
[1:36:34] already been paid
[1:36:36] for oh God don't you hear what I'm
[1:36:38] telling you you can get up this morning
[1:36:40] and walk out that door free for
[1:36:43] everything you have need of has already
[1:36:45] been paid for your healing your
[1:36:47] deliverance your joy your peace your
[1:36:50] security your salvation everything we
[1:36:53] have need he has already paid the
[1:36:57] price Peter said by his stripes you were
[1:37:01] healed past
[1:37:04] it
[1:37:06] hallelujah hallelujah oh do you love him
[1:37:09] this morning David said though I walk in
[1:37:11] the midst of trouble thou will revive me
[1:37:14] Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand
[1:37:16] against the wrath of my enemies and thy
[1:37:18] right hand shall save me David said Thou
[1:37:21] shalt revive me revive means to be
[1:37:24] quickened from sickness from
[1:37:25] discouragement from faintness from death
[1:37:28] to preserve life to let live to give
[1:37:31] life to Quicken to revive to
[1:37:35] refresh notice what David
[1:37:39] said David didn't say if if I walk in
[1:37:43] the midst of trouble he said though what
[1:37:45] was David saying I'm going to have
[1:37:51] trouble amen David understood that there
[1:37:55] will be trouble but he will revive me in
[1:37:58] the times of my troubles in a Land of
[1:38:01] bitter Waters he will make the water
[1:38:04] sweet you see when my mama had cancer
[1:38:07] she told me something I'll never forget
[1:38:09] she said Daryl I may have cancer but
[1:38:12] cancer does not have
[1:38:17] me and I may have
[1:38:20] troubles but troubles does not have
[1:38:26] me amen he promised
[1:38:30] me he would revive me a lot of times the
[1:38:33] reason we get into tight places is God
[1:38:35] wants to reveal to us and show us his
[1:38:38] love and to prove to us he's the same
[1:38:41] God yesterday today and forever and his
[1:38:44] power is still the same he wants to show
[1:38:48] his power God likes to manifest his
[1:38:52] power and maybe that's why you got sick
[1:38:55] maybe that's why you're having the
[1:38:56] trouble is he wants to show
[1:38:59] you his
[1:39:01] love a
[1:39:03] wonderwork god listen friends don't you

[1:39:23] praising the Lord she never came up for
[1:39:25] prayer she never asked for prayer she
[1:39:27] went home and took off her blouse she
[1:39:28] said to put some ointment on this place
