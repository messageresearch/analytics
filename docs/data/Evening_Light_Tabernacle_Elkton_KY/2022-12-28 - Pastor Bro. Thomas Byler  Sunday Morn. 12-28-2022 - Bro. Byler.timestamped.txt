[7:25] who hath believed our report and to whom
[7:29] is the arm of the Lord revealed
[7:45] he is despised and rejected of men a men
[7:48] of Sorrows and acquainted with grief we
[7:51] have hid as it were our faces from him
[7:55] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[8:07] but he was wounded for our
[8:09] transgressions he was bruised for our
[8:11] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[8:13] was upon
[8:15] what is tribes we are healed
[8:27] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[8:30] yet he opened not his mouth
[8:33] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[8:35] and as a sheep before her shears is dumb
[8:37] so he opened not his mouth
[8:53] and he made his grave with the wicked
[8:55] and with the rich and his death because
[8:58] he had done no violence neither was any
[9:00] deceit in his mouth
[9:20] you shall see of the travail of his soul
[9:22] and shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[9:25] shall my righteous servant justify many
[9:27] for he shall bear their iniquities
[9:31] abortion with the Great
[9:34] and he shall divide the spoil with the
[9:36] strong because he hath poured out his
[9:39] soul unto death and he was numbered with
[9:41] the transgressions and he bear the sin
