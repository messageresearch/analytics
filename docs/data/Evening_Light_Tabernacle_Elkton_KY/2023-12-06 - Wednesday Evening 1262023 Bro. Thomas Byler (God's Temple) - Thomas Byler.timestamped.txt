[43:39] going to be um
[43:42] uh kind of a I guess kind of a Holiness
[43:46] message a Holiness message amen and so
[43:51] we'll turn our Bibles I think to First
[43:54] Corinthians the third chapter 1
[43:56] Corinthians
[44:00] 3 I really wanted to talk about God's
[44:03] house God's house amen kind of talking
[44:06] about a local body amen God's house so
[44:09] to speak here a local body and then also
[44:12] you as an individual being God's house
[44:15] or God's Temple isn't that right amen
[44:19] and so in chapter three of First
[44:21] Corinthians we'll begin with uh
[44:26] verse
[44:29] 16 know ye not that ye are the temple of
[44:33] God and that the spirit of God dwelleth
[44:35] in you and if any man defile the temple
[44:38] of God him shall God destroy for the
[44:42] temple of God is Holy which Temple are
[44:46] ye amen I'm going to move this down a
[44:48] little bit Don I I didn't have time
[44:51] David called me out and I was still
[44:52] writing stuff down so I didn't have time
[44:54] to switch out to my mother so I'm going
[44:56] to pull that down a little bit amen so
[44:58] God bless you this evening you can be
[45:00] seated amen which Temple are ye let no
[45:04] man deceive himself if any man among you
[45:06] seem us to be wise in this world let him
[45:10] become a fool that he may be wise let me
[45:15] just start out with the quote that come
[45:17] to my mind amen as I begin to let the
[45:20] Lord speak to me and amen and what I
[45:22] wanted to say this evening amen and it
[45:25] is uh
[45:26] uh um out of I believe it was uh out of
[45:31] a total Deliverance total deliverence
[45:34] ministered amen and it says now but says
[45:38] and the member of the church if he's
[45:40] called to be a member of a certain group
[45:44] he says then he would not
[45:46] compromise if the church believes that
[45:48] we should not gamble then that member
[45:50] should never touch a deck of cards if we
[45:53] don't believe in drinking then he should
[45:55] turn his head completely from
[45:57] drinking if if we do not believe in
[46:00] gambling or smoking then the member of
[46:03] this church should never touch such a
[46:05] thing God gives a complete
[46:09] deliverance amen so how many believes
[46:12] that uh you know that we are the temple
[46:16] of
[46:17] God the Holy Ghost the very Temple that
[46:21] God dwells in amen and God likes to have
[46:25] a clean house I don't know about you but
[46:27] most people I know like to have a decent
[46:29] and half clean house don't they amen and
[46:32] you just don't bring anything into that
[46:35] house you're careful about what you
[46:36] bring into that
[46:38] house amen and so he's saying here if
[46:40] you're a member of a church or whatever
[46:42] and you don't believe in gambling and
[46:45] cussing there's a whole lot of things
[46:47] that don't belong in God's
[46:50] [Applause]
[46:54] house amen what he uh some of the things
[46:56] he said that you're to get rid of and so
[46:59] forth and how that we're to mortify
[47:01] ourselves amen but this is the one that
[47:04] came to me because it began to tell me
[47:06] you know you know he mentions a few
[47:09] things but how many knows there's a lot
[47:10] of things amen God gives a complete
[47:14] deliverance and he will do it if we will
[47:18] completely surrender ourselves to him
[47:22] and you know I don't know about you but
[47:24] I believe that we're probably going to
[47:25] SP most of our days finding things in
[47:28] our lives to surrender to
[47:31] God that's right
[47:35] more I ran across a few quotes brother
[47:38] B's has you know that uh if he could get
[47:40] 12 people he was talking about book of
[47:42] Ephesians and he says you know if he
[47:45] could get 12 people like those Ephesian
[47:47] church if he could get 12 people
[47:49] completely surrendered into his hands he
[47:52] said he could shake the world he can do
[47:53] more with those 12 than he could with
[47:56] all the rest of the world it takes a
[47:58] complete surrenderance to almighty
[48:01] God
[48:05] Amen because the devil doesn't want you
[48:07] to completely surrender your flesh
[48:11] doesn't want you to completely surrender
[48:13] amen amen and if you are in the place
[48:17] that you should be with God Amen
[48:19] remember this is a daily battle the
[48:21] devil will try to come in there right
[48:24] amen and I think we spoke by I think
[48:26] last Wednesday talking about be careful
[48:28] amen because when things happen it's
[48:31] when spirits come in when bad things
[48:34] happen to you somebody says something
[48:36] about you you really you know and it was
[48:38] a brother or sister boy that really hurt
[48:41] if you aren't careful you let bitterness
[48:43] come in ain't that right
[48:45] bitterness and with that Spirit of
[48:47] bitterness comes in you know and it's a
[48:49] terrible thing and until that confession
[48:52] is made that spirit's going to be in
[48:53] there so you got to be careful amen
[48:55] watch out for things when they happen
[48:57] because they'll come in amen and it's
[48:59] the same thing kind of what we're
[49:00] speaking of tonight amen you got to be
[49:03] careful amen praise the Lord amen now
[49:06] listen so he says uh on he says if we
[49:09] will completely surrender and deliver
[49:11] ourselves into his hands and God can
[49:13] live in US Christ the hope
[49:15] of glory and he can reflect himself from
[49:19] us as we get ourselves out of the way
[49:22] amen then our thoughts are in thoughts
[49:26] how many believes that's what we coming
[49:27] to to where when you think in your own
[49:30] way you're thinking what he says what
[49:33] God thinks amen
[49:36] amen oh my could you imagine he says our
[49:40] thoughts are his can you imagine Christ
[49:43] sitting there smoking a
[49:45] cigar I remember a long time ago I
[49:47] watched some television program where a
[49:49] preacher was talking or whatever and and
[49:51] he was sitting there they were sitting
[49:52] around you know they were talking about
[49:54] the Bible and it was
[49:56] smoking
[50:00] huh wow no I don't think it do there's a
[50:03] lot of things you won't find Christ
[50:05] doing is that right if you won't find
[50:07] Christ doing it you shouldn't be doing
[50:10] it
[50:12] amen praise the
[50:14] Lord amen now notice all
[50:18] right can you imagine him smoking could
[50:20] you imagine Christ drinking or playing
[50:24] cards amen then if you your spirit is
[50:27] part of his Spirit he wants it to be
[50:29] upon your confession but some sometimes
[50:31] you permit the devil to come in and to
[50:34] take
[50:35] over amen and all the time in your heart
[50:39] weigh down you know that you're doing
[50:41] wrong when you do thing then he goes on
[50:44] and when one member would talk against
[50:46] another member you know that's not that
[50:48] you know that's wrong you're commanded
[50:50] to pray one for another not talk bad
[50:52] about one
[50:54] another
[50:57] right wow how be unity in the house of
[51:01] God God's house is not
[51:05] divided no there's no division in God's
[51:10] body amen now if you're not a part of
[51:12] that
[51:13] body huh let me tell you if you're
[51:16] filled with poison acid and Malice
[51:19] you're not in the body because the Holy
[51:21] Spirit doesn't have you know there's
[51:23] another thing about the house of God is
[51:25] there's not supposed to be any
[51:26] unforgiveness in the house of
[51:29] God no because my look how forgiving PO
[51:32] he says forgiving one another if you
[51:34] know if anybody done forgive them
[51:37] because if you have bitterness that
[51:39] becomes a poison acid in the church
[51:41] isn't it right so he goes to talking
[51:43] about one another how many believes you
[51:45] got to watch what you say one to another
[51:47] that's just one of the things amen
[51:49] praise the Lord that's right talk don't
[51:52] talk against one another love one
[51:54] another I'm some some one is down let's
[51:56] pick him up help him amen that's a
[51:59] unified group of Believers when we don't
[52:01] obey that then we don't obey God and we
[52:03] displease God therefore our church and
[52:05] our people cannot Prosper the church
[52:08] cannot go on because we're disunified
[52:11] amen praise the Lord if one member makes
[52:14] a mistake don't turn them
[52:16] down huh is that right help him up raise
[52:20] him up amen amen having he have a
[52:23] hearing one with another that's what the
[52:26] scripture says and when we make a
[52:27] mistake let's go before God before we
[52:30] can go before God then we got to go
[52:32] before the person that we've
[52:35] heard oh man he says I just had to do
[52:37] that and I know I did wrong I lied cost

[59:15] can be halfway and God makes his
[59:17] children Christians but sometimes
[59:18] they're halfway it's because the it's
[59:21] not in God's intention for them that to
[59:23] be that way but it's their own ways get
[59:25] mixed up with the plan of God can I say
[59:27] it's an unsurrendered
