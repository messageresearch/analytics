[17:22] preeminence tonight father we ask in
[17:24] your precious name
[17:26] amen and amen turn your bibles if you
[17:28] will to the book of matthew
[17:32] the book of matthew
[17:35] amen just a little thought tonight for a
[17:37] little bit
[17:39] amen
[17:44] matthew 9.
[17:55] i'd like to go ahead and
[17:58] read three stories
[18:01] three stories the first one is in
[18:04] chapter 9
[18:05] of matthew verse 20. and behold a woman
[18:09] which was diseased
[18:10] with an issue of blood 12 years came
[18:13] behind
[18:15] and touched the hem of his garment for
[18:18] she said within herself if i may but
[18:20] touched
[18:20] his garment i shall be whole
[18:24] but jesus turned him about and when he
[18:27] saw her he said
[18:29] daughter be of good comfort that faith
[18:31] has made behold
[18:33] and the woman was made whole from that
[18:35] very hour
[18:36] i think there's another place and
[18:40] one of my must be on one of the other
[18:41] gospels where it said that he said who
[18:43] touched me
[18:45] amen and then the disciple says what he
[18:47] means who touches you everybody's
[18:49] touching you
[18:50] am i right he says no virtue has went
[18:53] from me
[18:54] am i right so anyway
[18:58] uh he said daughter be of
[19:01] good comfort thy faith has made thee
[19:03] whole
[19:05] then in verse 27
[19:09] and when jesus departed thence two blind
[19:11] men followed him crying
[19:13] and saying thou son of david have mercy
[19:16] on us
[19:18] and when he was come into the house the
[19:21] blind men came to him
[19:22] and jesus said unto them believe ye that
[19:25] i am able
[19:26] to do this they said unto him
[19:29] yea lord then
[19:32] touched he their eyes saying according
[19:35] to your faith
[19:36] be it unto you and their eyes were
[19:38] opened
[19:39] and jesus straightly charged him saying
[19:41] see that note that you
[19:43] that no man know it what i want you to
[19:46] get from both of these stories
[19:48] is that jesus
[19:52] in both cases told them that it was
[19:54] according to their faith
[19:57] in that right he said thy faith
[20:01] has made the whole he says according to
[20:03] your faith
[20:05] be it unto you amen one more
[20:09] uh over in matthew
[20:12] 15 and 22
[20:16] matthew 15 and 22
[20:24] down to verse 28 i believe it is and
[20:26] behold
[20:29] a woman of canaan came out
[20:32] of the coast of the same coasts and
[20:34] cried unto him saying
[20:36] have mercy on me o lord thou son of
[20:38] david
[20:39] my daughter is grievously vexed with a
[20:41] devil
[20:43] but he answered her not a word and his
[20:46] disciples came and besought him saying
[20:48] send her away for she cried after us but
[20:50] he answered and said i am not
[20:52] sent but unto the lost sheep of the
[20:55] house of israel
[20:58] then came she and worshiped him saying
[21:01] lord help me
[21:02] but he answered and said it's not me to
[21:04] take the children's bread and to cast it
[21:06] to dogs
[21:07] and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat
[21:10] of the crumbs which fall from the
[21:12] master's table
[21:14] then jesus answered and said unto her o
[21:17] woman
[21:20] great is thy faith be it
[21:23] unto thee according as thou wilt and
[21:26] that daughter
[21:27] and her daughter was made whole from
[21:28] that very hour may god it is
[21:31] blessings to the reading of the words
[21:32] you can be seated tonight
[21:35] amen tonight i want to speak on faith
[21:37] for a little bit
[21:38] but i called it the arm of faith
[21:42] the arm of faith amen
[21:47] and so i want to read you a quote here
[21:49] actually two quotes to just
[21:52] uh kind of start here
[22:00] said in hebrews the fourth chapter verse
[22:02] 12 it says that the word of god
[22:04] is sharper than a two-edged sword
[22:07] he says now there's only one thing that
[22:09] can hold
[22:11] this sword and that's
[22:14] the hand of faith all right
[22:18] the hand of faith is the only thing that
[22:20] can you
[22:21] can wield he said yield but
[22:25] wield this sword of the word
[22:28] now you might have a weak arm all right
[22:31] you might have a weak arm just enough to
[22:33] pick up
[22:34] for justification you're so weak maybe
[22:37] that's all you can cut through
[22:39] but this sword of the word will cut free
[22:42] every promise that god made in it
[22:45] if they got a good strong arm of faith
[22:49] holding it there amen he says god made
[22:53] the promise and
[22:54] faith holds this sword
[22:57] he says in it'll cut her out of the rock
[23:00] yonder every promise of god can be cut
[23:03] free by the word of god for it's
[23:06] a sword another place he says our faith
[23:10] is an arm our faith is an arm
[23:13] a mighty arm that holds a sharp
[23:16] two-edged sword of god
[23:19] and that sharp true edge his sword will
[23:21] cut out every promise
[23:22] free if that arm of faith is able to
[23:26] yield
[23:27] that sword
[23:31] some people has very weak muscles
[23:34] trouble and they can just maybe cut off
[23:36] a little scratch
[23:38] maybe just enough to join church others
[23:42] can come into justification
[23:45] some can go all the way to the baptism
[23:47] of the holy ghost
[23:49] amen a strong arm holding this bible can
[23:52] cut every promise
[23:54] free that's right so be strong
[23:58] in the lord amen
[24:01] all right you can go home well maybe not
[24:03] quite yet
[24:07] isn't that something to think that amen
[24:10] so
[24:11] i thought about this and that's really
[24:13] what caught my attention and
[24:15] what really brought me to this message
[24:16] and to the thought is
[24:18] what he said about the word of god
[24:21] and what it actually takes and how that
[24:23] some people can just cut a little bit
[24:25] out of it
[24:25] some people can cut more out of it amen
[24:29] but we know that jesus said different
[24:31] places he saw he talked about that one
[24:33] man you know he had a believer
[24:34] he he had uh his son i believe was fixed
[24:36] with the devil and so forth he says you
[24:38] know
[24:39] help them on unbelief because he says no
[24:41] if thou
[24:42] canst believe all things are possible to
[24:46] them that believe
[24:48] amen another place he says with you
[24:51] nothing shall be impossible
[24:55] amen whatsoever things you ask and
[24:57] believe
[24:58] you can help somebody knows it oh my
[25:02] god just keep getting excited already
[25:04] here when you just think it just let it
[25:06] let it stink that into your mind like it
[25:08] is mine right now
[25:10] when you think about this you know
[25:11] because somebody knows that
[25:13] then you can live you can read every
[25:15] book you want
[25:16] you can read every philosopher and all
[25:18] the good stories but this is a book
[25:21] amen and this truly is what we would
[25:23] call the living bible
[25:25] i mean this book is alive
[25:29] it's real it's not fictitious it's not
[25:31] history it's not good philosophy
[25:33] amen god backs his
[25:37] word up
[25:41] and like he said every promise is in
[25:43] here how many knows the rapture is in
[25:45] here
[25:47] heaven is in here everything is in here
[25:51] but it's all according to your faith
[25:56] it's all according to what you can
[25:58] believe
[25:59] as thou has believed so be
[26:02] it unto you
[26:06] i got to thinking about that and i
[26:08] thought about the word of god first of
[26:10] all
[26:10] let me let me read you one more
[26:11] scripture over in ephesians about what
[26:13] the word is
[26:14] okay now the word
[26:19] is the sword it's been found in
[26:21] ephesians 6
[26:23] and he talks about be strong therefore
[26:25] in the lord and the power of the might
[26:27] in the power of his might put on the
[26:29] whole armor of god that you may be
[26:32] able to stand against the wiles of the
[26:33] devil the shield of faith you know the
[26:35] sword of the word and all the things
[26:37] that we're to be equipped
[26:38] with and then to properly fight the
[26:40] devil
[26:42] but down in verse 17 just to kind of uh
[26:45] uh
[26:46] you know show you what it what it is he
[26:48] says and take
[26:50] this helmet of salvation and
[26:53] the sword of the spirit
[26:56] what is the sword of the spirit
[27:01] because you know if you've got the
[27:03] spirit but no sword
[27:05] you've got to have a sword with this
[27:07] with the spirit
[27:09] and the sword of the spirit spirit
[27:12] because
[27:13] you know what one person sometimes told
[27:15] brother about hey you know if you can
[27:16] believe
[27:17] you know you can touch that post out
[27:20] there and get healed
[27:22] what did he say he said no because
[27:24] that's not according to the word of god
[27:27] it still has to be according to the word
[27:29] amen
[27:30] so you know we could you can believe
[27:32] anything that ain't will make a soul
[27:34] it has to be according to the word of
[27:35] god for god to honor
[27:38] so now here it says take the sword of
[27:40] the spirit
[27:41] which is the word of god
[27:45] the sword of the spirit is the word of
[27:47] god
[27:49] praise the lord so that sword
[27:52] is the word and only uh
[27:55] depending on how big a muscle you have
[27:58] it's how hard you can strike
[28:01] and how much you can cut and what you
[28:04] can receive from god it's all according
[28:06] to your faith
[28:08] and i like that because that stands for
[28:10] every one of us right here
[28:14] now if you want to talk about the power
[28:17] when we talk about the power of the word
[28:20] of god
[28:21] the word of god is quick and it's
[28:23] powerful
[28:24] and it's sharper than any two-edged
[28:26] sword and so forth on down
[28:28] and we know that it was actually in the
[28:31] beginning
[28:32] god spoke
[28:36] and created the heavens and the earth so
[28:39] we know that the word
[28:40] is so powerful that the voice that i
[28:43] have the words that i speak
[28:45] me standing here every bit of that was
[28:48] created
[28:49] by the word of god you are hearing
[28:53] amen breath you're hearing amen
[28:55] something that god
[28:57] created by his word you're standing on
[28:59] what god created
[29:01] everything you look at god created
[29:06] our bodies our minds our hearts
[29:09] everything got everything that was ever
[29:11] created the bible says without him
[29:13] there was nothing created that was
[29:15] created it was all created by the word
[29:17] of god
[29:19] praise the lord so i mean it was it's
[29:20] very very most powerful thing
[29:22] in the universe why do you think over in
[29:25] revelations 19th chapter when he comes
[29:27] back
[29:29] right beyond the heart
[29:33] what do you think written which is
[29:36] called
[29:39] the word of god
[29:43] amen so the word is powerful
[29:48] amen very the most powerful thing in the
[29:52] universe
[29:53] is god's word amen and this is why i say
[29:57] it's living because
[29:59] it's still as alive
[30:02] as it ever was
[30:06] one of these days the skies are going to
[30:07] catch fire the heavens are going to
[30:09] catch on fire
[30:11] all right it says the heavens are going
[30:13] to be on fire the earth is going to melt
[30:16] with fervently the elements of the earth
[30:18] everything's going to melt with
[30:20] fervent heat it's all going to be a
[30:21] great big giant boom like you ain't
[30:23] never heard in your whole life
[30:25] it's all going to pass away it's
[30:28] all going to become nothing but the
[30:31] bible says but my word
[30:33] shall not pass away everything else is
[30:36] going to pass away
[30:37] but this will not pass away
[30:43] do you see how
[30:46] ignorant it is
[30:51] it'll never pass away no matter how many
[30:53] people try to make it
[30:54] null and void whatever it is it'll never
[30:56] pass away
[30:58] if he says that
[31:01] you're gonna be a judgment every tongue
[31:03] shall confess every knee shall bow
[31:06] and every tongue shall come free said
[31:08] jesus christ is lord
[31:10] still this is going to happen amen
[31:14] but now the problem is and i want to
[31:15] talk a little bit for a little while
[31:16] with the help of the lord about
[31:18] weak faith and strong faith
[31:21] how many blades that knows that the
[31:23] bible says that abraham
[31:24] not being weak in faith abraham was not
[31:28] weak
[31:29] in faith 25 years it didn't matter he
[31:33] wasn't weak in faith
[31:34] he knew god said it he knew it was going
[31:36] to happen he hung on to it
[31:38] and it didn't matter how long of a time
[31:41] that it was
[31:42] so how many can say tonight know that
[31:44] amen real genuine
[31:46] strong faith endures time
[31:51] no matter how much time goes by real
[31:54] genuine if you've got real genuine faith
[31:57] you're not going to fall off in 20 30
[31:59] years
[32:00] 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 years or 120 like
[32:05] noah i mean knows noah was not freaking
[32:07] fake
[32:07] he went 120 years and he was just
[32:10] building that r huh and that's the same
[32:14] way with you and me
[32:15] i was 20 years old when i come to the
[32:17] lord
[32:18] i'm almost 6 59 and i say
[32:21] 60 i just saw giving myself a few years
[32:23] always to make myself feel better
[32:25] but anyway you know and you know you
[32:28] know look at that time frame if you have
[32:30] genuine faith
[32:31] i mean time is not of the essence
[32:35] there's something down on
[32:39] the inside of it amen
[32:43] so you look at that um think about
[32:46] think about what faith
[32:50] what faith in the word it's it's the
[32:54] only thing that
[32:55] makes makes this work
[32:58] huh how many knows that's the first
[33:00] thing that for
[33:01] this work the first thing to access
[33:04] the power of this word the only thing
[33:08] the thing you gotta have is faith
[33:10] revelation by god himself
[33:13] for god reveal it to you you can conjure
[33:16] it in your mind and
[33:18] you can try and try and try you'll never
[33:20] get any power like that
[33:22] but when god comes down and he reveals
[33:24] it to you it makes it real to you in
[33:27] your life and in your heart
[33:28] when god grants you that faith for we
[33:31] are saved by grace through faith and
[33:33] that not of yourselves it's the gift of
[33:34] god
[33:35] when you get that faith faith folks i'm
[33:37] here to tell you
[33:38] it causes you to tap into this and to
[33:41] know
[33:41] that it'll absolutely take you over the
[33:45] flames of hell
[33:48] huh let me tell you something this is
[33:51] going to carry us
[33:52] right over the atomic bombs that's
[33:54] coming
[33:55] this place is going to get blowed up it
[33:57] could be nothing but ashes
[33:59] but this faith in this word is what's
[34:02] going to pick you up in the rapture
[34:03] and take you right above it while that
[34:06] happens down here
[34:08] gonna carry you over the flames of hell
[34:10] and the tribulation period
[34:13] amen this word right here
[34:17] is what changes this from one day to the
[34:21] other
[34:21] it's what uh changes our character it
[34:25] molds us it shapes us into the image of
[34:28] christ
[34:30] huh does all kinds of things we could be
[34:33] here all night
[34:34] y'all ready for all night i ain't done
[34:37] almighty brother brad
[34:40] or a midnighter like paul
[34:43] hey man so just think about it isn't
[34:46] that awesome just to think about the
[34:47] power so the power
[34:49] of this word we realize that for one
[34:51] thing you think about what it's done
[34:53] people with strong faith in this word
[34:57] have literally quenched the violence of
[35:01] fire
[35:02] they heated up the oven amen that they
[35:05] were getting
[35:06] thrown into seven times hotter than they
[35:08] originally were gonna do
[35:10] they were just gonna make the fire hot
[35:12] enough to burn the guys but after they
[35:14] defied the king they said make it seven
[35:16] times hotter i believe it was
[35:21] so hot that the people that were
[35:22] dragging them boys up there over the
[35:24] edge got killed by the heat
[35:28] huh them boys are gonna get they're
[35:31] gonna die
[35:32] but can you imagine them guards they
[35:34] were doomed either way
[35:36] if they didn't go throw them in they're
[35:37] gonna get killed and if they go throw
[35:39] them in they'll get killed
[35:42] horrible devil to serve isn't it
[35:46] yeah that is bad but dad they
[35:49] had to go through some guys in
[35:52] and they went and throwed them in and
[35:54] they because of their
[35:55] faith in the word of god and in god
[35:59] it's quenched the violence of fire and
[36:01] they walked around in the fire
[36:04] walked around in a fire
[36:08] because of strong faith daniel walked
[36:12] among lions hey folks i'm here to tell
[36:15] you
[36:15] it ain't like these guys that raised the
[36:17] lions and pitted them and were all nice
[36:19] to them you know
[36:20] no these lions they were very hungry
[36:24] huh they were wild terrible lions didn't
[36:27] like humans a whole lot
[36:29] because if we found that out right after
[36:31] uh you know god saved daniel from the
[36:33] lion's
[36:34] mouth and so forth then they throw those
[36:36] other guys in
[36:39] i'm not sure just how it says it but it
[36:41] talks about they were
[36:42] ripped bone to bone before they ever hit
[36:44] the ground from what i understand
[36:47] my lines did a job
[36:50] but think about it think about what it
[36:52] does
[36:56] let it soak in that you
[36:59] let me let me just say this the next
[37:02] thing
[37:02] that it brings the next thing
[37:06] the one thing that this word of god will
[37:08] do
[37:09] for every one of us tonight
[37:14] make you invincible
[37:20] invincible
[37:24] yeah hey shamgar right
[37:29] shamgar got fed up with being pushed
[37:32] around
[37:33] by the devil because that's what the
[37:37] devil loves to do
[37:38] the devil loves when you just get a
[37:40] little bit of faith when you just get a
[37:42] little bit going
[37:42] he loves to just knock you right back
[37:44] down
[37:46] huh and chamgar every year they would
[37:48] come and he would have a weak harvest
[37:50] and he would
[37:51] you know he would probably try to hide
[37:53] some wheat for his family
[37:55] they'd find his in wheat probably
[37:59] and he was in a bad shape he got so fed
[38:01] up with it he says
[38:02] that they ain't got no right i'm an
[38:05] israelite and i have a right to my
[38:07] this is our land and faith kicked in
[38:11] i'm gonna kill him i don't believe that
[38:13] we never mattered i don't believe it
[38:15] would have mattered if it's a hundred
[38:17] or 200 i don't know about you but jeff
[38:19] but i wouldn't take
[38:20] 10 guys on with a sword can you imagine
[38:23] 10
[38:24] guys yeah let alone 100
[38:28] or 200 or 300 or 400 or 500
[38:31] it was 600.
[38:34] and he killed all of them
[38:38] come on let's get the lord ahead
[38:41] thank you
[38:46] invincible unstoppable
[38:50] he got the spirit of god believing and
[38:52] trusting in god
[38:53] same way with samson is that right don't
[38:56] matter if it's a thousand or ten
[38:57] thousand
[38:58] and as i've done it before and told you
[39:00] before i don't believe
[39:01] any man that i know or could ever think
[39:04] of that could go on a battlefield
[39:06] and have enough energy to
[39:10] kill a thousand in a day now you would
[39:12] you'd run out of energy
[39:14] before you get that far but not him
[39:19] i think he does talk about afterwards
[39:20] she was weak and go really red and so
[39:22] forth
[39:23] yeah i'd take a zap right out of it
[39:26] but the power of invincibility
[39:30] amen not only in the old testament there
[39:32] but didn't jesus say
[39:34] with you nothing's going to be
[39:35] impossible
[39:38] huh faith
[39:41] in this word strong faith in this word
[39:45] will give you the ability
[39:48] to walk on water huh
[39:52] weak faith when you look at
[39:54] circumstances like peter did
[39:57] if you look around a little bit huh
[40:01] well i don't know if i got there you go
[40:03] down right there
[40:06] i don't know if i can do this i tried
[40:08] this before
[40:09] boy the devil just fill you up with it
[40:13] because even peter not just not just
[40:14] jesus walked on water but peter
[40:17] walked on water but i'm glad for a
[40:20] helping hand sometimes when you get a
[40:22] little weak in faith
[40:23] jesus reaches down picks you up say come
[40:25] on up here come on up here
[40:28] amen how many knows these people that we
[40:30] read about in the bible
[40:32] huh the woman that touched the hem of
[40:34] his garment
[40:38] she said if i can just touch him if i
[40:41] can just
[40:41] touch him and just and no doubt a lot of
[40:44] people weren't she had to push
[40:45] do some shoving she had to push around a
[40:47] little bit to get to where jesus was
[40:50] and she touched him amen
[40:54] and jesus and she was instantly healed
[40:58] isn't that right and jesus realized
[41:06] she has gone out of me strength
[41:10] that's gone out of me somebody touched
[41:11] me somebody got healed
[41:15] i guess jesus will have to tell us
[41:17] whether really he knew who it was or
[41:18] wasn't right
[41:20] maybe he didn't know i don't know but he
[41:22] said who touched me
[41:25] and the woman admitted he's with me and
[41:28] he said
[41:29] your faith is what did it
[41:34] your faith is what did it
[41:38] same way with the blind people he didn't
[41:41] say well
[41:43] i heal you he had oh he could how many
[41:45] knows jesus can heal everyone so high
[41:46] everyone's stew whether you've got faith
[41:47] in that you can do it
[41:49] he can do what he wants but he says this
[41:51] was your faith this was your doing
[41:53] huh you did this
[41:57] it was your faith that did it why
[42:00] because
[42:01] they had strong faith the one woman as
[42:03] we know
[42:04] he even called a dog a gentile i guess
[42:08] not me to give the children's bread to
[42:10] dogs lady
[42:14] some people are would never be that
[42:16] humble
[42:18] called me a dog ain't no dog
[42:22] ain't nobody called me a dog yeah i'm
[42:25] dog
[42:25] i'm a worm the bible calls us worms
[42:27] somewhere right
[42:29] but a worm ain't nothing compared to god
[42:33] she says yes that's true lord it is not
[42:36] the good to get take the children's
[42:38] bread
[42:39] out of their plate and give it to the
[42:41] dogs
[42:43] no but she was pretty wise she had faith
[42:46] she had determination i believe brother
[42:48] brandon preached on perseverance
[42:50] she was perseverant i mean his faith is
[42:53] perseverant
[42:54] it's going to happen it's got to happen
[42:56] i ain't worried about nothing else
[42:58] like the queen of sheba how many of us
[43:00] she had real genuine faith
[43:02] because she went and loaded her camels
[43:05] up and she just had a small
[43:07] a bunch of arms around her but she had a
[43:09] lot of gold
[43:11] she had all kinds of valuables and she
[43:13] wasn't worried about all of them deserts
[43:15] and all of those
[43:16] uh criminals on their desert that would
[43:18] have taken him so far so you didn't
[43:20] think about all of that just get me up
[43:21] there
[43:23] i want to see solomon i want to see this
[43:25] she didn't worry about everything else
[43:28] sometimes a person with real genuine
[43:30] faith
[43:31] they act crazy to the world but if you
[43:33] have genuine it is persistent
[43:36] perseverant amen
[43:39] it makes it so
[43:42] praise the lord gives you
[43:45] invincibility unstoppability
[43:49] and i believe that even death shouldn't
[43:52] scare us
[43:54] even death itself shouldn't scare us
[43:58] it has no power over us not even death
[44:03] how many knows it makes you brave
[44:07] now how many of those that uh peter and
[44:10] all of those when they were in the upper
[44:11] room waiting for the holy ghost to come
[44:13] they were worried they were scared up
[44:14] there from what i understand they were a
[44:16] little worried
[44:17] that hey they're fixing to come they can
[44:19] come anytime they can find us
[44:21] and they could crucify us like they did
[44:23] our master
[44:26] huh and they were up there but after the
[44:29] holy ghost came in there right
[44:31] when that spirit comes down and that
[44:33] faith bubbled up
[44:35] the rams as they come up out of their
[44:36] room they were preaching the gospel and
[44:38] they says where is that devil at we
[44:40] ain't afraid
[44:42] no more they took the fear out
[44:45] they went out preaching the gospel
[44:47] everywhere didn't care if they got
[44:48] thrown in jesus
[44:49] into prison they didn't care if they got
[44:51] crucified or whatever happened they did
[44:53] get crucified
[44:54] they get killed and everything else but
[44:56] they had genuine faith in god
[44:58] amen strong faith peter brother bannon
[45:02] preached on perfect faith
[45:03] he talked about how that peter had
[45:05] perfect faith
[45:06] isn't that right amen when that uh
[45:09] crippled man
[45:10] it was crippled and so forth amen he was
[45:12] going to the temple and
[45:14] he was begging for alms and peter come
[45:16] up to him and
[45:18] and talk to him for a minute perhaps and
[45:20] and he asked him for gold silver gold
[45:23] peter says i ain't got no money
[45:25] i ain't got no silver no gold but the
[45:27] bible says that peter perceived
[45:30] that he had faith to be healed
[45:34] now something must have come over peter
[45:36] right something must have told him hey
[45:38] say that to him tell him to get up
[45:42] rise up in the name of jesus christ rise
[45:45] up and walk
[45:46] i'm up i'm up i believe that he had
[45:48] faith and he rose up and walked
[45:51] see all these different stories brothers
[45:53] and sisters tears stories
[45:55] to tell you that it doesn't matter if
[45:57] you're in lion's eye or what kind of a
[45:58] fire you're in if god is with you and
[46:01] you have faith in god
[46:02] god will take you through it i'm just
[46:05] glad for that
[46:06] the same power and that faith comes by
[46:08] hearing that's why we're talking about
[46:09] these lords
[46:10] because it gives you faith make you
[46:11] realize the very same
[46:14] god oh my how brother brandon preached a
[46:17] message
[46:17] different message upon uh uh
[46:20] god the unchangeable god the
[46:23] unchangeable
[46:25] god that never changes he is not the i
[46:27] was but he is i
[46:28] am the i am and he still is
[46:32] as much as he ever was as powerful as he
[46:36] ever was
[46:39] now we know that the prophet taught us
[46:41] how to do this generation this is the
[46:43] age of hybriding
[46:46] this is the age when people hybrid
[46:48] everything people
[46:49] hybrid or try to hybrid this word
[46:54] huh
[46:56] called a hybrid religion they try to mix
[46:59] something else into it and what does it
[47:01] produce
[47:02] huh same thing that a horse and a donkey
[47:04] will produce in that right a mule
[47:08] and he can never reproduce himself again
[47:11] same as a grain of corn that's hybrid it
[47:13] can never reproduce itself again
[47:16] and it basically makes the word of god
[47:19] to them
[47:20] of non-effect
[47:23] it is of not affected them it doesn't
[47:25] have the power that it's supposed to
[47:26] have
[47:27] because they hybrid it they mix their
[47:29] own ideas their own thoughts
[47:31] and so forth in it why do you think
[47:34] jesus said
[47:35] if you had faith as the grain
[47:38] of a mustard seed
[47:41] huh the reason he said a mustard seed
[47:44] because from what i understand
[47:46] a mustard seed will not mix
[47:49] with anything else it is so pure it
[47:53] won't mix with nothing
[47:55] so if you have that kind of faith you
[47:58] could say to a mountain
[48:00] ah i'm stupid but i believe you
[48:04] literally meant mountain
[48:08] i believe you've set a mountain he meant
[48:10] the mountain he just said a tree
[48:12] he demanded a tree but he set the
[48:13] mountain be plucked up
[48:17] look at that mountain pop up
[48:21] go over into the ocean
[48:25] being a big spot with it
[48:29] can i say something else a little crazy

[51:52] take your peace that you have
[51:53] yes you will you get the holy ghost you
[51:56] get right with god
[51:57] and never try anything out in this book
[51:59] we try to rob you of that
[52:02] but you know how many knows that at
[52:04] calvary
[52:06] that the devil was stripped of every one
[52:08] of his powers
[52:10] he had every one of them stripped in
[52:12] other words
[52:16] he's only got whatever power we give him
[52:19] whatever power you give him is the power
[52:21] that he has
[52:26] in order for him to have power over you
[52:28] you have to reject
[52:30] god and his word and his power
[52:33] you basically have to say devil here i
[52:35] am i give up
[52:39] that's what you got to do how was it the
[52:42] prophet said
[52:44] uh you can't walk in darkness
[52:48] until you refuse the light huh
[52:52] because the light is shining so the only
[52:53] way you can really walk in darkness is
[52:54] to refuse the light
[52:57] amen and this is the light this is the
[52:59] truth
[53:01] huh and let me tell you something else
[53:03] about what this is
[53:04] do you realize this is an absolute
[53:07] affidavit
[53:10] this is a stamped
[53:15] notary repub public or whatever it's
[53:17] been notarized it's been
[53:19] officially made it's got the stamp of
[53:22] god on it
[53:24] that every person on earth
[53:28] is pardoned
[53:32] huh every sin that anybody ever
[53:35] committed or ever will commit
[53:37] is forgiven it's a complete pardon right
[53:40] here
[53:42] for god to love the world that he gave
[53:44] his own begotten son that whosoever
[53:46] believeth in him should not
[53:48] perish but have everlasting life
[53:52] amen it is a stamp of approval that
[53:54] everybody can live eternally
[53:59] the only reason everybody doesn't
[54:01] because they're weak in faith
[54:03] they don't believe it
[54:06] they don't believe it because if you
[54:08] believed it huh how many knows that's
[54:11] the same way with the holy ghost
[54:13] well i want the holy ghost believe god
[54:15] the right way
[54:16] and god will give it to you instantly
[54:22] don't have to come to the altar it can
[54:24] be in your car can be on the job
[54:25] can be wherever you actually get that
[54:28] faith that you're supposed to have
[54:29] when god accepts that faith and you
[54:30] receive that faith god will give it to
[54:32] you instantly
[54:34] peter was preaching at the house of
[54:35] cornelius isn't that right 11th chapter
[54:37] i believe
[54:38] it is of acts and while he was yet
[54:40] speaking these words the holy ghost fell
[54:42] on
[54:42] because he believed what he said
[54:48] can i just say what comes to my
[54:51] that's mind same way with this gospel do
[54:53] you realize that when this gospel is
[54:55] preached you can receive the baptism the
[54:56] holy ghost right there
[54:58] you can receive the holy ghost by
[55:00] believing what the preacher says
[55:04] if it's the truth and if you reject it
[55:06] what do you get and what do you receive
[55:10] mark of the beast
[55:13] mark of the beast has always been to
[55:15] reject the truth
[55:17] it's the mark of unbelief the mark of
[55:20] cain
[55:22] that's kind of strong in it but it's the
[55:23] truth
[55:25] go ye into all the world and preach the
[55:27] gospel
[55:28] he that believeth and his baptize shall
[55:31] be saved

[1:01:58] huh oh my
[1:02:01] and it gives you courage i'm i'm not
[1:02:03] going to go along tonight
[1:02:06] but let me just read you this one more
[1:02:08] would that be okay
[1:02:21] i was reading the other day where a man
[1:02:22] said the devil got before him
[1:02:24] and he was just a little bitty old devil
[1:02:27] and this devil said boo
[1:02:28] so i jumped back and he said boo
[1:02:32] and i jump back again every time he
[1:02:34] hollered boo
[1:02:35] i'd jump back and hit it bigger and i
[1:02:37] would get smaller
[1:02:40] huh isn't that about how the devil is
[1:02:42] every time he whoops yeah every time he
[1:02:44] scares you
[1:02:45] i mean it seems like the devil is just
[1:02:46] so big
[1:02:49] he's just so big how am i ever going to
[1:02:52] do it
[1:02:53] huh
[1:02:57] and he said he just kept saying boo said
[1:02:59] i got smaller each time and i jump back
[1:03:01] and he'd get bigger
[1:03:02] so i know i had to fight him after a
[1:03:04] while and said i looked around i thought
[1:03:06] i found the word of god and i said i'll
[1:03:08] hold it in my hand
[1:03:09] and the devil i said boo i said the
[1:03:12] devil said boo and i said boo back
[1:03:19] aaron you're not the devil but let me
[1:03:20] use the illustration all right
[1:03:23] say boot to me
[1:03:27] huh that's what you got to do back he
[1:03:28] said that right
[1:03:31] right that one goes boom and you go you
[1:03:33] boo here here
[1:03:34] you know be like that's right that's
[1:03:38] what he says boo back scare him
[1:03:40] why because you know he's a bluff
[1:03:45] you know i wish there's somebody in here
[1:03:49] but anyway because it's just like just
[1:03:52] like david right
[1:03:54] you know david was a little bitty fella
[1:03:57] and
[1:03:58] goliath how does that song go
[1:04:04] david was oh so small and a giant oh so
[1:04:08] tall
[1:04:09] you know and uh
[1:04:13] so there they were what did uh who
[1:04:16] talked first
[1:04:18] i think it was goliath booed
[1:04:21] and my dog that you sent this little guy
[1:04:25] out here to fight me
[1:04:27] you know who am i and so forth he says
[1:04:30] today i'll do this
[1:04:31] i'll take your head i'll i'll feed you
[1:04:33] to the files in the air i'll pick you up
[1:04:35] by the end of my spear
[1:04:37] and feed you to the birds
[1:04:40] huh david said
[1:04:45] [Music]
[1:04:47] you come to me with a sword and a spear
[1:04:52] goliath i'm not afraid of you
[1:04:56] why because the god that delivered the
[1:04:59] bear into my hand and the lion
[1:05:02] in the mind you fight any of them lately
[1:05:04] goliath bet you did
[1:05:07] but i did and god delivered me from the
[1:05:10] potter line and the pawn
[1:05:12] for the bear he's gonna deliver you into
[1:05:15] my hand
[1:05:17] you come with me as with a sword and a
[1:05:19] spear but i come to you
[1:05:21] in the name of the lord of hosts the
[1:05:24] armies of israel
[1:05:26] that's why i come to your hand now let's
[1:05:28] do this
[1:05:30] amen got to meet him face to face with
[1:05:34] the brahman says sometime you're going
[1:05:35] to have to fight him
[1:05:37] huh so everybody ask yourselves tonight
[1:05:41] both here
[1:05:42] on the streaming world where does the
[1:05:45] devil
[1:05:46] intimidate you at
[1:05:49] because that's where your battle is
[1:05:50] going to have to be you're going to say
[1:05:51] i'm not going to be intimidated
[1:05:53] by the devil anymore we're going to say
[1:05:55] boo back
[1:05:57] huh we're going to meet him face to face
[1:06:02] in other words let's do this
[1:06:09] but about says faith
[1:06:12] has got muscles on his chest
[1:06:15] and he says every time that reasoning
[1:06:19] comes and oh
[1:06:20] i don't know if you can do it i don't
[1:06:21] know if you can do it he says you let
[1:06:23] faith come and say
[1:06:25] shut up reasoning sit down
[1:06:28] reasoning and brother bram says it goes
[1:06:32] back over into the corner sits in a
[1:06:33] little chair in the corner somewhere
[1:06:35] because faith makes it so
[1:06:38] you meet the devil you say devil this is
[1:06:41] where the line is drawn
[1:06:44] amen if he's robbed you of something go
[1:06:46] get it back
[1:06:49] no that alley he's down and that dark
[1:06:51] place that he's down
[1:06:53] that he's got you down it isn't as scary
[1:06:55] and as
[1:06:56] spooky as it looks because way down in
[1:06:58] that alley way in that
[1:07:00] dark place he is just a bluff
[1:07:04] he's just a little devil running around
[1:07:06] and when we
[1:07:07] listen do you realize the bible says
[1:07:10] that when we get down
[1:07:12] to the pit when we get down to the pit
[1:07:15] where the devil is going to get thrown
[1:07:16] into
[1:07:18] isaiah 14 i believe it is you will be
[1:07:22] brought to the sides of the pit
[1:07:24] i hope i can remember this
[1:07:29] and they who look upon you narrowly look
[1:07:32] upon you
[1:07:33] will say is this the guy
[1:07:37] is this the devil are you the guy
[1:07:40] that brought down nations are you the
[1:07:42] one that give us
[1:07:44] all this trouble you know i thought you
[1:07:47] was a big bad guy
[1:07:49] you aren't as much as what i thought she
[1:07:51] was isn't that right
[1:07:53] that's the way i read it anyway narrowly
[1:07:56] look upon him and
[1:07:57] say is this the guy that i was scared of
[1:08:02] that i let push me around
[1:08:05] huh
[1:08:09] but i grant you this one thing you'll
[1:08:11] never do it on your own
[1:08:13] you'll never do it without the holy
[1:08:15] ghost you have to have god on your side
[1:08:19] don't never try to meet him like the
[1:08:20] seven sons of siva did
[1:08:23] they didn't have the holy ghost they
[1:08:25] wanted to go cast some devils out
[1:08:27] you know right they were going to go
[1:08:28] cast out them some devils out
[1:08:32] they got up in that house and they got
[1:08:34] into this
[1:08:35] place and they were saying we adjure
[1:08:37] thee
[1:08:39] by jesus christ that paul preaches
[1:08:42] wow had it right not bad

[1:08:50] you got it right but
[1:08:53] they didn't know him personally isn't
[1:08:56] that right

[1:09:01] my mom's experience dad's no no no
[1:09:06] you know they had to have an experience
[1:09:07] like paul had
[1:09:09] the holy ghost wasn't there they weren't
[1:09:12] being backed up
[1:09:14] and can we say the devils were probably
[1:09:16] in here too
[1:09:17] and what happened yeah they got loose
[1:09:21] the devil got loose they turned loose
[1:09:23] peter they turned loose on them seven
[1:09:25] sons
[1:09:26] and they barely escaped with their lives
[1:09:29] does it say something about their their
[1:09:32] clothes were ripped from them
[1:09:38] why because they didn't do it by the
[1:09:40] word of god
[1:09:42] do you realize that the nations nowadays
[1:09:45] that fight the nations russia
[1:09:48] china north korea all of these guys
[1:09:51] all the fighting that goes between them
[1:09:53] that's just devils that are jealous of
[1:09:55] each other
[1:09:56] huh it's just a bunch of devils fighting
[1:09:58] that's why we have wars
[1:10:01] yeah and everything else is because the
[1:10:03] devils are truly they battle each other
[1:10:05] over jealousy and hatred and
[1:10:07] money and all these other things

[1:10:13] tonight as i close
[1:10:16] that each and every one of us is asking
[1:10:19] ourselves
[1:10:21] how is my
[1:10:25] faith

[1:10:30] you're saved
[1:10:32] if your spirit should be you're filled
[1:10:34] with the holy ghost
[1:10:36] if it is where it ought to be you've
[1:10:38] conquered the biggest enemy of all and
[1:10:40] that is your
[1:10:41] old self the old man
[1:10:46] that second person that paul talked
[1:10:48] about that gets in god's way
[1:10:52] and you have learned to yield yourself
[1:10:54] to god
[1:10:56] you've conquered yourself brother bram
[1:10:58] said
[1:10:59] amen you've whipped yourself out
[1:11:05] you've said lord i can't do anything
[1:11:09] but i know with you i can do anything
[1:11:13] because greater is he that is in you
[1:11:14] than he that is in the world

[1:11:23] faith lord
[1:11:25] increase my faith
