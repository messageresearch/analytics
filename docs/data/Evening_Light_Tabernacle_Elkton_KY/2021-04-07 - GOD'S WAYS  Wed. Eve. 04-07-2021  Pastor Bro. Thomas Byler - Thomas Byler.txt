our heads go before the lord in prayer kind of heavenly father we once again come before you thank the lord jesus to be able to assemble ourselves together lord in a midweek service lord just to lay aside all the cares of life and father just to be able to focus on you and center our minds upon you lord and together together in your name lord knowing god that you'll be in our midst and father you know every need of every person we just desire god that you'll meet those needs and lord that you would receive our thanks and our praise and our worship to you tonight father we just desire god that you just take the little thought i feel like you've laid upon my heart to speak on and just say what you once said lord jesus we ask these blessings and favors in jesus name amen amen let's turn our bibles if you will and i think we'll go to the book of isaiah first book of isaiah amen be a message we've heard before but i just trust that maybe it'll something will be said to help somebody amen in isaiah 55 and we'll read verse 8 and for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts then your thoughts amen now let's go to hebrews hebrew 3. we want to speak on god's ways god's ways hebrews 3 verse 7 wherefore as the holy ghost saith today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me and proved me and saw my works 40 years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath that they shall not enter into my rest may god it is blessed instead of reading the word you can be seek be seated amen talk about humility amen for one thing we want to talk about this evening with the help of the lord but i was listening to a message amen brother brandon preaching and he was preaching on the world is again falling apart in 1963 and he made a statement that kind of caught my attention and from that i began to just study and see what the lord would have so we'll see what the lord will have from that one little thought amen he was preaching of course about how that the world as before is falling apart amen and of course he covered everything he covered politics he covered the churches and he made a statement back then and i want you to listen to this about politics he made the statement he says our politics just couldn't get no worse think about that way back in 63 he said politics it really can't get any worse but we look at it today we've seen it get a lot worse in it i mean a lot worse amen so even he felt that way about politics back then also the churches in their condition that they had gotten into pentecost he mentions about how that they had gotten into formalism and and so forth and they let all kinds of things come in that shouldn't come in amen they had gotten to be real lukewarm and so forth he really hit that hard but then he makes a statement came in that uh that kind of caught my attention that caught me to begin to you know cause me to question the way that i think amen and the way that we think amen and so i want to i want to read that statement before i uh go any further but uh there's another thing that he said that i think i'll read after that one but listen to what he says he says now our political world the whole thing is corrupted our political world man-made systems and fashions he says and of course brother branham was just preaching away as you know real hard now he says this he says and we want everything just [Music] everything we want everything just everything so we can take it easy amen all right and retire he says and take life easy amen and i was like whoa you know and i i see this brother sisters you know and and i'll maybe share with you but retire and take life easy then he makes a statement and you should hear him say he says life wasn't intended to be easy life wasn't intended to be easy amen life is a struggle amen everything's got life is struggling isn't that right look at the trees and so forth you know and when we get into some kind of a system that takes it easy remember we're wrong amen there was another time brother branham was preaching about riches and being poor and so forth and you know uh let me just let me read this okay somebody came to brother batman he was talking about he says you know about taking a million and a half dollar check brother branham was handed a check hundred and one hundred one million five hundred thousand then he says man this man's worth twenty eight million dollars he owns big mission bell winery and all and i said i don't care how he owns said sir my father owns the cattle on on every hill i don't have any need of the money and he says well i just seeing your mother's home and yours here and parsonage and says you could use it and i said yes when i need it father will send it to me i don't need it now and i refuse to look at it a million five hundred thousand dollars and one offering and i'd rather take 50 cents or a dime from so and so and so and so and let everybody have a part in it then to take a lot of big money and headaches and troubles and then you think well it's just too much enough the curse of the love of it he says now i've heard him say it when he said he says i was born poor i was raised poor my people are poor and i want to die poor you go back and listen to it that's what he said i want to die poor that was the prophet of god amen when i caught that i began to think you know you know i wonder sometimes whether we really think the way that we ought to think it's time as bottom am i really thinking the way that i was just thinking because either way i feel about it i'm close to 60 if i don't think about my retirement now in about five years from now well you might think about it all you want to but you ain't going to do a whole lot about it huh i figure it's only smart how many knows it's only smart to think about your retirement isn't that what the whole good thing everybody really thinks about in retirement or or if not just having it easy just don't we all love to have it we all like to have it easy but if we can look at god and we can look at how did he set things up in that right and i'll tell you what you know um let me think y'all remember joey hendrickson when they were coming to church here and he was he was uh just retiring and i'm not sure if it was just a couple months out of retirement and here he found out that he has cancer it might not even be that long it was right at the point i'm not sure i'm thinking in the back of my mind if i remember right that just before his death he got his first retirement check just before he died if i'm right if i remember about he wasn't he was writing that time frame like that amen and so no doubt he worked and he talked to me i remember me talking to me about how he worked here amen for so many years and he had a good retirement coming you know and so forth and then think about what happened and so truly when you think you might be taking it easy guess what something always always pops up amen god did not intend for us to have it easy the prophet of god said so god's intention how many knows it's god's intentions you know just when you think you have it nice watch out we are in such a world amen and there's something else that'll come along amen but he said that another place he said that i was like wow you know and and i don't know about you but i don't think that any of us in here probably would be strong enough to say no don't i don't want your million and a half dollars you know you can say whatever you want to say right now but you know you'd have to be put to the test before you'd really know isn't that right that's right but brother bannon you know because the man was paying his tithes he was you know he called it his tithes yet every reason every legitimate reason but brother branham was so sensitive about money and getting into things like that that he wouldn't i'd rather i would i want to make sure and he always go and he come to a service and he'd tell him look i'm not here he's in he many times said i'd never take up an offering in my life that doesn't mean that his church didn't take up an offering but he never said look i want to need an offering will you take it up he said the closest he ever came to taking up an offering was he was in a tight place and he says look i hate to do this but i'm gonna have to pass the hat and he went out there and them to us just began to go down there and them little miami's you know them older mammies they were taking their nickel out and they're pinning out their dimes out and so forth and he says i was just kidding never mind you know you almost did it but he couldn't even do it he went and spray painted some bicycles and sold that bicycle amen and got what he needed to get done but he wanted the people to know that he wasn't there for the money he wasn't there to get rich because i guarantee you brother branham could have been a multi-multi-multi-millionaire if he had just taken money that people would give him there's a lot of people amen that wanted to give it to him but he didn't want it he wanted to stay simple he wanted to everybody to have it whenever there was an offering that people would take up he would accept an offering that people would take up for him but he wouldn't take it up himself and that's what he meant by that but he wanted everybody in there but so i got to think and i thought man you know i wonder how much you know we think that we were supposed to think and to think the way that god thinks and the way that he intends it to be so i went and i got a bunch of scriptures together on this tonight and we want to just look at it for a little bit because i guarantee it is one thing that you and i compared to all of the apostle disciples and the christians down through the dark ages we have it nice compared to what they did because how many knows john the revelator he was the only man that died of old age every last one of them either was crucified upside down paul's head was chopped off they were killed in one manner or other they were killed they had to give their life so it was hard amen it was not an easy life a christian life is not an easy life the great the good thing about it it doesn't matter though like paul was in jail amen and they had him in socks the good thing about a christian is that no matter how hard the struggles you go through no matter how many heart battles you go through you have somebody that takes care of you and it comforts you during that time amen so we want to look some scriptures and and look at the look at how we look and how we think about things compared to how god thinks about things you know right and so many times it's just the opposite just the opposite okay so i didn't bring my ink pen so i'll probably lose my way if i don't follow these let's look at the disciples first of all because you know we're always we as human beings are always looking at how how much we can attain how high we can go not right how far we can go like man he's all excited about going to the moon you know and in his space program and all these other things man he's always trying to go up higher and and so forth in status of life and business people are always wanting to become the vice president and then the president and so forth they're always trying to climb the ladder we as human beings do that isn't that right amen but you know when you think about it you know we just want to look at god's ways for a little bit now and the disciples were the same way now we know the disciples had forsaken all and i want to read that script after a while because they had forsaken all you know and they had sacrificed at all for god but in it all they knew that he was the messiah they knew that this was the messiah okay so in mark 9 if you want to turn with me let's go to mark 9. and along the way they had kind of disputed about who's going to be the greatest and so forth if you remember and verse 33 9 33 it says and he came to capernaum and being in the house he asked them what was it that he disputed amongst yourselves by the way amen and they held their peace in other words the crowd was quiet nobody said word [Laughter] for by the way they had disputed amongst themselves who shall be the greatest amen even in christianity they wanted to see who would be the greatest amen they wanted to see how who would be the best always climbing up going as high as you can and he sat down and called the twelve and said it unto them if any man desire to be the first the same shall be last of all amen in other words if you're trying to become somebody if you're exalted with pride comes before a fall if you try to exalt yourself god says you're going to be brought down to the base amen and servant of all amen well thank you all right y'all are on the ball so we see the disciples how they said that right now i want to go to another one over in matthew 19 matthew 19. he makes this statement in i'm just going to read one verse in chapter 19 and then we'll go to verse chapter 20 verse 25. again he says in verse 30 many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first amen so that's one of god's ways one of god's ways is in this world those who seem to be last the least they're the ones that's going to be first and those that are first in this world are going to be last so it's just opposite and if you'll notice the prophet of god also made a statement he says you know we as human beings he says you know we're not like god because god is so he's greatest of all you know he's the greatest of all but yet he's so great that he can make himself little he can make himself a foot wash blunky the lowest job that's what god could do we as human beings we don't we have a hard time getting so great that we can actually humble ourselves and become small but i'll tell you what if you ever come get the holy ghost i mean if you get the holy ghost it'll make you little and i was just reading a quote back there but it says man you need to humble yourself and let everybody be else everybody else be better than you that everybody else be better than you because you think you're better than somebody else no that's not god's way and so humility with god has been all down through time because we know that david was just a sheepherder isn't that right he was a nobody and you just go on and on and on how did god choose chooses the foolish and those who are nothing of the world to make him something amen another message brother bam talked about was uh humble thyself is one thing uh paul a prisoner i believe it was another amen talking about the way up is what down amen the last shall be first and so forth now in chapter 20 verse 25 if you'll notice notice he says but jesus called them unto him and said know ye that the princes of the gentiles exercised dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister in other words your servant people think well the preacher is the great one no the preacher is not the greatest preacher is your servant amen and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant amen even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his land or life for a ransom for all in other words in life people who have always demanded to be served and oh you know you know bring it to me it's be my you know serve me that's never amounted too much they never amounted to much there's nothing ever written much of them and jesus said i didn't come so everybody would fall at my enough you'll notice if if you remember jesus when he washed the disciples feet he didn't say hey i'm gonna sit down here you wash mine first he went and watched theirs he was the first to wash their feet and then he says you know i've given you an example that just do like i did god's thinking in god's ways he said even in isaiah they're not your ways are not my ways my ways are not your ways but now how many knows that through the baptism of the holy ghost that can be different through the baptism of the holy ghost we have his very life in us and really tonight's message is about and i think about myself because i'll tell you what it doesn't take long it didn't take much for us to exalt ourselves in our own eyes it doesn't take much to before we can let pride rise up or we can you know get to where we're thinking something and we're going higher than we should then god can't use us amen we have to my heart's desires are not lord help me to humble myself because the bible says he that humbles himself shall be exalted i'm not sure where it is but somewhere they asked him who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and he called a little child to him isn't that right and he called a little child to him right here it is matthew 18. at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven see their mindset oh my hey folks let me tell you something you'd be amazed at how people in the world and in this message have that mindset about being the greatest i want to be the greatest but when you get that in your mind you're in for trouble you're fixing the fall because when you begin to think i want to be the greatest because in your mind you should be saying lord how can i be the humblest i want to be humble how can i serve [Music] the let me somebody feels like their doormat well i'm a doormat hey how if you really got the right let me see how i can serve the man that's the doormat right you want to go lower than the doormat man huh you want to just stay way down because paul i mean it was paul he was the man of us the same way i'm going to be great you know like the k ephesus and so forth paul had so much pride and he explained it later he talked about i was the pharisee of the pharisee you know i was all this that's what i was but god had to knock me off my high horse he had to knock me down you live a christian you let the son of god get to where they've got a lot of pride in their life watch out somebody's fixing to hit the road god is going to bring it down amen bring you down to where you need to be amen but i thought about you know we want everything easy god doesn't make things god didn't intend this world for us to be able to be multi-millionaires retire amen just have it easy god's purpose of the church is what what is to what is our purpose here what does god want us to do go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature even better bam says not build hospitals and schools and college and all of this no go preach the gospel be a witness be a testimony for jesus christ that's what god's called us to do amen what as i was thinking about this sermon i have one little humor here in my sermon tonight is that all right um i got to thinking about the 29 no wait a minute it was the 29th chapter of matthew around verse three all right let me see this yeah jesus lays out the four simple simple steps to becoming financially independent huh all right that was the humorous because there is nothing 29th chapter of matty god never did give no four simple steps to doing all that but what he did do was blow our mind when he said that it is easier for camel to go through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to get into the kingdom of heaven and peter in them says who then can be saved amen because how many knows you have to really watch riches you really gotta watch these carnal natural worldly things because it will choke out the spiritual life right out of you and you will find yourself serving it rather than serving god amen nothing wrong with having something that god gave you i was reading ecclesiastes today and i ran across a couple things that i thought were pretty good it says he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase huh all right this also is vanity the sleep of a laboring man is sweet whether he eat a little or much but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep huh that's about right isn't it get so busy with riches until you don't have time to sleep you're worrying about everything you're thinking about everything amen down in verse 15 it says as he came forth of his mother's womb naked shall he return to go as he came and he shall take nothing of his labor which he may carry away in his hand we brought nothing into this world and was certainly not taking anything away amen brother brahm says i was born poor my people are poor i want to die poor the only thing i want to have when i die is favor with god that's all i want i brought nothing into this world it's certain we take nothing out amen so if you ever want to pray for me it's not to have money not to have big homes or be popular but just pray that i can stay in the hands of christ that he might mold me and make me and use me in any way that he sees fit to do amen in that our hearts desire that's what we truly desire of all the things that god does give us amen that our main ambition and goal is that we pray for one another that we're ready to go because there's nothing you're gonna you're not gonna have handfuls of hundred dollar bills no your children will get that and you don't know how quick they're gonna blow it huh that's what solomon said it's all vanity all that you ever gained all that you get the vain thing about it is you don't know whether the guy getting it's going to be wise or not amen all right let's go a little further is that all right all right lord help us just think the way that god wants us to think because sometimes we think so much the opposite way we worry so much about the things of the world it reminds me of what jesus said the fall of a sparrow the number of your hair and you god knows that you have need of these things but just keep your mind on god and his will amen all right i never finished this here verse did i which is who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them huh the greatest we're talking about in the kingdom of heaven and he said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven after jesus came and did something he didn't do in 2000 years he deserved the thoughts and tense of the heart world over hello but yet people could not humble themselves huh and confess hey i believe that's jesus christ that's not just the prophet that's not just a man but that's jesus christ they got so lifted up in their minds and their own thoughts until they thought they were better than what god had sent better than somebody that can't even talk proper english hello they got their minds messed up folks and they miss god because they didn't do what they couldn't humble themselves how many knows it takes a lot for anybody to humble themselves to the word of god amen humble them you've got to humble yourself to the word of god to submit yourself humbling is submitting yourself none of them wanted to submit even though it was infallible it was absolutely the truth amen and what become of it was terrible amen so he said unless you become un like them become as little children we shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as a little child amen the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven humble yourself as now we know that children what did they do to the parents they just simply believe they believe what their parents said they submit themselves to the parents they're happy and content with basically doing what they're told and if you'll do that just with the kingdom of god amen hey i don't know nothing but he knows everything unless you become as a little child he says you'll never amount to much amen amen all right now all right well i didn't mark some of them out 19 and 3 we got it 20 okay we got that now we're going to go and we want to talk about again what jesus said and how he put it and how whether or not it's going to be easy or supposed to be easy for us luke turn it with me if you want to luke the sixth chapter okay and he went up into the mountain called his disciples together verse 13 chose 12 of them whom he had chose and so forth and it mentions all the one he had chose luke luke 6 and verse 17. and he came down with them and stood in the plane and the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people came out of all judea and jerusalem and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon which came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases and they were and they that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and he healed them all so we had a great healing campaign isn't that right great multitude came they were all healed then he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be ye poor how many knows that's truly what the disciples were even jesus was poor huh you know and when you preach about being poor this is why i said earlier i was going to mention that my wife could give you a testimony that some preachers and this is the thing of it how many knows that uh whether it's the bible or whether it's things brother banh said about retirement well but about or should i just not worry about my retirement should i just not do i don't think that that's what the prophet was saying huh no do you think jesus said blessed are the poor so hey i better work on being poor huh see we had preachers in the message already to take things so far out of context until they think it they make it make it a religion they make it to where that's how you got to be but you better have a balance on it because if you don't get a balance on it hello that don't mean if god gives you something it means for you to have a lot of money that you don't have a lot of money hello but if you are let me say if you are poor on account of following the gospel you're a blessed person huh when it causes you to you know take persecution on the count of the gospel watch out amen that's that you're a blessed person for yours is the kingdom of god and blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled you see how bug out jesus said look it may not be easy you might not have it either you know how many of those in the dark ages that were hungry that they didn't have a home that they had hide in caves and give their lives even one place he says you know be faithful unto death you're going to have tribulation the bible says about tribulation and things like that amen but listen if you are on account of the gospel hungry now let me can i stop for a minute because look at look at israel how many knows when god bought them out of egypt they had a dead a jamboree they had to dance and scream and shout in time whenever they came out of egypt is that right and then god came and takes him right down to the red sea where they couldn't go any further huh they led him right into a trap see it's god's ways israel didn't understand god's ways now i don't know about you but it is really wonderful if you understand god's ways because if you don't understand god's ways you're not going to know how to react or act just like trials that come our way if you don't know that hey god's going to allow those things to happen if you don't understand god's ways and he is going to test you he is going to try you the bible says every son that comes to god must be tested must be tried must be chastened every son no grandson nobody's exempt huh well there we've had an evening like tabernacle we've got a lot of people go through some hard times but there's a few of us that's never had a trial can't say that can we no because every son every daughter that comes to god has to be tested as we tried and they didn't israel didn't understand god's ways god's way is to not always let it be nice not always let it be easy amen and so he allowed them come into that trap and couldn't go forward they had to trust god and after they went through that and god did oh my the miracle of parting the red sea going across on dry land coming out the other side looking back and here comes the chariots and here comes the spears and here comes the whole army of egypt coming through there and all of a sudden the waters gush down i don't know about you brother glenn but i'm here to tell you if i'd have been pharaoh and god parted the waters for them to make it through i would have my doubts that he means for me to get through that right i'd say no way we're going down in there really no way let's go back home let them guys go no not pharaoh he's one well i don't want to say stupid but what a general whenever god does a miracle like that and they're like wow how can that even be huh i think i'll try it not a good not good but somehow other even the bible talks about god hardening his art amen maybe god had to harden his head he had to make him uh you know hardhead now we're coming after you we ain't giving up that easy huh come into there and what happened here comes the water and washed them all away they came over to the other side of the river miriam i don't have a tambourine up here she began to and all the sisters oh they all follow everybody oh praise be to god moses wrote a song if i ain't wrong about somebody about how they got it for all of his enemies they had a good time but god don't mean for you just to have a good time he does mean for you to have a good time but then it wasn't long isn't that right he got in out into the wilderness and there's no water what a horrible general huh moses what is wrong with you taking us out into this desert here where there ain't no water i am thirsty i don't know about you but water is something we can't do without amen but all god was looking for was hey don't matter blessed are you when you're hungry for the kingdom of god blessed are you if you come up against a wall that you can't cross praise be to god anyway amen moani's going through some really really hard times again only thing i know i have to do is when one one piece of advice that i gave him i said look why don't you just start praising be to god praise be to god my heart's be to god it'll chase all the devils away of torment and everything else hello does anyone hear it if israel would have just praised the lord god's able he took us out of egypt he's able to do it i don't doubt but they'd be in heaven nowadays but remember the bible said because they did understand my ways i swore in my wrath that they will not enter into my rest they're not coming home here i'm going to have doubters up here amen after all that god did both hunger and thirst after righteousness huh blessed are you to hunger now for you shall be filled amen when you're starving and hungry no doubt there's a many a little child many of mother father parents that were having hungry for the kingdom of god's sake don't worry over there there's gonna be plenty of food in other words jesus said in this world you're probably going to have it rough it's not going to be easy amen and think about this coming off of here this is what he's telling them i'm going to give you flowery better people thank you become a christian it's a flowery bed of ease it's not but god gives you grace through it all that hunger now for you shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now amen for ye shall laugh amen i believe that's part of the reason that brother brahm said god didn't intend for things to be easy because he knew they would be hard yet you and i let me tell you how many believes that god has made it we have it nice we have it too nice don't let that niceness take you away from god blessed are ye when men shall love you no hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name is evil ain't nobody gonna be called calling me evil huh yeah they are people's going to call you evil who's going to make you evil look evil for the son of man's sake amen rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets but woe unto you that are rich you have you received your consolation how many knows that so many times people who are rich trust in their riches people that want to be rich because you feel like hey you're secure you're you're good to go huh you've got a i don't even know about a 401k and all that i guess it's some kind of retirement fund and all of that i got 2 million dollars in my 401k i'll tell you what at 65 i'm gonna sit back i'm gonna go bass fishing i'm gonna go take it easy huh what did the bible say over in james i think that the rich are not to trust in their riches those who few who are rich don't trust in your riches but use it to distribute to saints of necessity and so forth never i use it right but people intend to think that it brings security don't trust in your riches no sir people trust in it war unto you that are full for ye shall hunger will unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep war to you and men shall speak well of you for so did did their fathers to the false prophets amen but i say unto you which here love your enemies do good to them which hates you huh so contrary to our nature to the way we think isn't it because without the holy ghost let me tell you something you will not love your enemy now you'll try to try to comply but it won't be there it has to be there bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and unto him that smiteth thee on the cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also amen give unto every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again and as you would that men should do to you do ye also unto them likewise how many knows that's pretty much the golden rule of christianity golden rule of christianity is to do to others as you would have others do to you i mean it covers it all i believe in galatians says he that loveth his neighbor has has fulfilled the law and all this commandment hang all along the prophets if you do that as a christian you probably do all right man because you're always trying to do whatever you would want others to do to you amen and then notice do them likewise and if you love them which love you what thank have ye for sinners also love those that love them that is so hard to do in the human realm is that right to love the ones that don't love you and if you do good to them that do good to you what thank have you for sinners also do the same amen praise the lord so we see that god dwells in humility god dwells how many knows to do all these things that we just read takes humility i was reading a little bit about isuzu street and the revival there and back then some of the black folks couldn't even go inside the church to listen to the preaching and to hear the teaching but it says you know instead of being proud and no i ain't going to do that they would actually some of the ones that became great and renowned amen and wanted they humbled themselves and they would go outside of the door and sit there on the doorstep listen see what they could hear i had to think that's humility and it talked about how humble how they humbled themselves hey if i can i'm going to get what i can if i can't give them sights of bread but they were so dedicated to god they were hungry hungry for god amen and they humbled themselves amen just a couple of scriptures on on something brother branham said both in uh i mean different one different places brother bam says but a real listen but a real big man makes himself small that shows that the god of heaven made himself a foot wash flunk washer to mankind he says the way up is down if you want more of god you have to find a way to humble yourself more he that humbleth himself shall be exalted amen and he says that's what's the matter with people today they don't want to accept the humility of the gospel but abraham someone said brother how do you see visions he said it's not me see you got to get yourself out of the picture god made a promise god's got to stay with that promise but you've got to be simple enough to get away and out of your own way how many believes that we have to get out of our own ways again the way to know god is to get simple because how many knows that's how a childish a child is just simple-minded many times if you come to church and you listen to the preacher if you just take it into simplicity that it's given simply believe in that right it'll bless you but if you sit back there and you analyze it and you begin to think yeah but over here and over there stay simple the more i can get myself simple the more god can use me my god can talk to me but i'm here to i you know the other day i was uh filling up my gas tank at the gas station and all of a sudden a car with a loud muffler a mustang you know took out of there and he wanted everybody to hear he had a loud muffler you know here comes a woman ill fame dressed or whatever she had her dress on and everything but she was fussing at her husband you know you didn't give me enough money you know and she went over there and just carried on you know how world is the only drama they have is what they create i was just standing you know pumping the gas thinking praise the lord i don't even hear and i got to think about the prophet of god says you know when you go into jakarta glory when you get back there behind the veil the veil drops and all the noise of the world you don't even hear it i thought i don't even hear all that i'm behind the veil in god i'm resting in peace you know they're out there carrying on trying to prove things and having all their drama but i thought you know thank god for being behind that veil the words all just shut up shut in with god doesn't affect you doesn't you know praise the lord just want to be at that place where god can speak to your heart and lead you can guide you he can bless you you know how many is glad for that that's where i want to be how that we might know god get simple the way up is down amen he says he that humbles himself shall be exalted and he that exalt himself shall be abased we must humble ourselves try not to mode know too much amen you're smart but you don't have to be smart you can think of all kinds of stuff but don't think of all kinds of stuff just get your mind on the word and on the simplicity of the gospel you'll be a whole lot better off let all the riff raff amen i believe everything outside of the holy spirit speaking to you is there so much noise out there everything else is noise except the holy slinger let's look if you want more of me you're going to have to find a way to humble yourself a little more you're going to have to go a little lower here because down here is where i'm at people can know how to do send people to the moon but they can't figure out what makes the blade of the grass grow it's actually god that causes that life to grow amen no sooner listen we must humble ourselves try not to know too much just know one thing focus everything else out of the way and look onto christ if you don't know how to write your name how many knows peter couldn't even write his name that don't have one thing to do with it just focus your heart on christ and watch out and see what happens peter said one place after he said with men this is impossible as far as rich man entering in and then to answer peter said unto him behold we have forsaken everything we've given it all up sometimes i wonder if we've given it all up to let christ have first place in our life and follow thee what shall we have therefore huh in other words what's our reward we've forsaken all the folly what's our reward and she sees jesus said unto them verily i say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory ye shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the 12 tribes of israel paul said don't you know the saints are going to judge the world wow he says you're going to be sitting on 12 thrones you're going to be telling them pharisees huh why didn't you accept him we were looking for him why didn't he accept him and everyone that has forsaken houses or brothers or sisters or fathers or mothers or wife for children huh how many knows if you've got a christian wife you don't forsake him you have a christian husband you don't forsake them but those who had to because of the sake of the gospel am i right or children or lands for my sake shall receive a hundred fold and shall inherit everlasting life and he says conclusively but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first lord help me not to have to try to be first top dog boss lord let me be the least a nobody that but just somebody that you can use amen god bless you let's stand tonight i know we've heard it before but i hope that was a blessing to you i just thought about that and i said lord help me to understand what you intend amen that it isn't all gonna be easy amen you have intended it for us to follow you no matter what amen let's bow our heads how many really want more of the lord realize maybe there's an area in your life where you could humble yourself more god bless you god bless you god sees your hand lord jesus i pray father just about every hand being up father we realize that we truly want more of you lord and we understand your ways father how that if we want more we have to go further down lord to get it we have to die to our own ways our own thinking more and keep our minds just simple don't let the devil come in and put questions and all kinds of genealogies and all kinds of different things in there but just simply follow the word just keep our focus on you lord jesus and off of the things of the world and though you have given us much though we have much lord father we don't want let those things to get in between us and you lord never let anything else be first in our life but you father we thank you for the peace and the love that you give our hearts father in the midst of a world that is falling apart lord jesus we thank you that we have an anchor that goes within the veil that holds sure and steadfast and this wednesday night both those that are here and those that are listening father as we humble our hearts and our lives and our our bow our heads to you right now we ask god that you would show each and every individual an area of our life that perhaps we could humble ourselves more that we could base ourselves more father so that you could use this in a greater way and how that we could be closer to you how we could walk with you so that truly the world would be shut out and we'd be shut in with god in that secret place lord jesus we ask god that you just touch every heart now in jesus name amen and amen god bless you amen
