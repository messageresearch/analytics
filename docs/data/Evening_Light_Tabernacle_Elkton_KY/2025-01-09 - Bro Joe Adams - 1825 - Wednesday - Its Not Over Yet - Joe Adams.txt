thing I hope we don't think it's a bad thing I mean we we like Weston actually we love Weston and so we welcome him into our family he asked me last time we was here if he could take our hand in marriage and I just broke down and started crying hey guys it's tough you guys that only have boys you're lucky you don't have no girls to give away but we're happy to be here we want to want to just kind of go to the Lord tonight I hope nobody's in a rush there's the only thing outside waiting on you is the cold weather so let's just stay warm while we're here I will say that I was telling brother Thomas and brother Brad in the back before we get started tonight that the Lord laid this thought on my heart and I thought I was going to preach it Sunday but brother Thomas and sister Donna neither one was here and when brother Thomas invited me to come he put this on my heart for sister Donna so tonight we're just going to believe I know all of us have a need but we understand that there's a great need back there but we also understand we ser serve a great big God who's able to meet that need so tonight I want to speak to you on and I give it a title it's not over yet it's not over yet and we'll look here in 2 Corinthians 4 we're going to start at verse 5 and I'm kind of going to back up and forth here once we get down and I'll have you seated but so for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servant for Jesus's sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excell Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we're troubled on every side yet not distressed we're perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body skip down to verse 14 knowing that he which rais up the Lord Jesus shall also or he that rais up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving May redown to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though the outward man perish yet the inward man is New Day by Day for our light Affliction which is yet but a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not on the things which are seen but the things that are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal God bless you you can have your seats this evening I don't see brother Tommy he didn't make it tonight oh there he is I can't hardly see nothing that's the honest thing I left my glasses at the room and I usually just need readers but tonight looks like I I can't see a face out there so that may be a good thing but also want to look here at another scripture 1 Peter 5 and ver8 very quick it says be sober otherwise that means not intoxicated be sober be vigilent because your adversary deser the devil as a roaring line walketh about seeking whom he may devour amen this word devour here as we look at it means to drink to swallow up to Gul down to absorb to engulf to submerge to overwhelm to swallow greedly to devour to destroy to annihilate your enemy seeks to annihilate you tonight he seeks to overwhelm you tonight and he has many facets of overwhelming the mind of the people and the hearts of the people and we understand that Satan does all that he has and he does all that's in his power to try to destroy the elect of of God you understand that you here tonight are his main focus you're his goal tonight his goal is to destroy you to annihilate you to stop you from progressing in your walk with God but I also want you to know tonight that you are God's main focus Satan is after you but God is for you tonight and if Satan can put so much power so much energy so much Focus us into trying to keep you from becoming what God has called you to be how much more tonight Church of the Living God it's God's focus on you tonight he said you're the apple of his eye woo my think about it l oh you tonight in epton Kentucky are the apple of God's eye tonight and no matter what you're going through no matter what you're facing on this side there ain't enough power in the Demons of Darkness there ain't enough power in the Dooms of Hell tonight to stop you and to stop our God and can I put the devil on notice tonight he may be trying you he may be attacking you he may be coming against you but it ain't over yet the god that we serve brother Thomas he has the final say I told myself I wasn't going to get excited I lied on notice Satan does all within his power to try to stop us but you're here tonight some of you tried to throw in the towel but you're here tonight some of you tried to quit but you're here tonight why because the devil don't have enough to stop God's bride he don't have enough to stop you tonight and as long as we're in these bodies as long as we're in this world we're going to face trouble all right Ain't nobody got Wings here tonight we're going to have hard times difficult times and but the Bible says though the outward man this outward thing that we call the the body or the humanity and whatever name you want to give it this thing will embarrass you it would ridicule you look I'm about to be 50 years old in 3 months and I wake up every day going oh my god when I was 25 I didn't wake up saying that I said praise God today I'm waking up oh my God we got a new ache we got a new pain we got a new this we got a new that there's trying times as we progress along but I want you to know tonight we serve a great big God tonight and though the outward man perish though this flesh perish the inward man let me tell you Satan can't get to the inward man he can Tu this outward man he can bring it down to destruction but this inward man is Renew Day by Day Hallelujah you can come against my body you can come against my mind but you can't come against this soul of mine because it belongs to God tonight Hallelujah the outward man perishes but the inward man is renewed the outward man is in feeble but the inward man is strengthened the outward man grows old he decays but the inward man renews his strength and is invigorated in its youth let me tell you young people you may not think much about that right now but one day these scriptures or this thought here will be a reality to you though this outward man perish oh there's something in a heart of a Believer longs to to see God it's renewed by reading the word of God it's renewed by studying the message of God I like what it says here in verse four 2 Corinthians or verse 7 excuse me it says but we have this treasure so Brother Brad I was looking at that today I'm like what is he talking about now Paul is is telling us here we have this treasure in Earth and vessels sometimes we don't want to put treasure in Earth and vessels in humanity do we CU Humanity will disappoint you Humanity will fail you Humanity will hurt you not intentionally hopefully but it does but Paul is here is saying we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us so I've started looking back at the beginning of this chapter in verse one it says therefore seeing we have this ministry so otherwise Paul is pointing back the treasure that we have Paul is saying in his day the treasure that we have is this ministry otherwise the treasure that we hold in Earth and vessels is the message of the hour Paul was proclaiming in that age in the Ephesian age that the treasure that the believer possessed was The Treasure of the message of the hour the ministry of the Gospel of Jesus Christ you said brother Joe are you sure go to verse three but if our gospel Paul still speaking here if it be hid is hid from them that are lost and the gospel is the good news is it not to me it's good news so The Treasure of the Gospel the rich and invaluable truths which they are called to preach to others so when you come to the church you come and you listen to tapes and different things of that nature go to meetings and camps you should count it a treasure the words that are proceeding out of the man's mouth it's not his own thoughts but it's the mind of God coming out and expressing itself to the people as the gospel the good news so this word treasure here is applied to truth on the account of their inestimable worth otherwise you can't put a price on it in one scripture they would say it's to Pearl of great price the gospel and if that's not what it means to you you need to come to the altar it should mean everything to you the gospel the good news it means that whatever is in this word no matter what it ask of us to do to how we should dress how we should behave how we should act how we should conduct oursel what we should believe what we should uh what whatever it may be we should come under subjection to the word cuz it's a treasure now let me just say this if I had a million dollars here tonight with me and I stuck it in a vessel in the back and I said hey first one comes to the altar first one comes up here I'm going to give you the access code to the treasure y'all all be streaming up here right now come on who don't want a million bucks but what he's given us Paul is giv us is something that far exceeds a million dollars your million dollars will Rust your million dollars will burn up your million dollars will canker and go down to the grave but what God is giv us tonight is The Treasure of the Gospel that'll lift you out of here and change your body and heal your sickness and deliver your children it'll take you out of this realm I'm talking about The Treasure of the Gospel not just the word preached but the word preached in power and manifestation of the words of God anybody can stand behind here and quote scripture quote quotes but I'm talking about the gospel being preached by the anointing of the Holy Spirit Paul said I came not with enticing words of man no but Paul preached he demonstrated the reality of the word he preached the reality so after brother Brandon went off the scene what have we done as a Mist Community we went we seed seeds of theology 60 years of theology message theology theology theology theology but where is the manifestation of the theology oh church I'm here to tell you tonight Satan's trying to drown it out and give you well it's thus sayth the message it's thus sayth the message what let me tell you if it never comes on your Humanity if it never manifest in your church in your home in your life it ain't th sayth the message but when it becomes a living reality Hallelujah when it becomes a manifestation then it becomes your ring reality the message in the Bible has to come off pages it has to come off the pages and it has to come in the heart I don't care if you're young if you're old if you're blind whatever it may be it's got to be more than books on a shelf it's got to be more than takes on a on a record player it's got to be a living manifestation and you don't think the prophet of God will want this word that he preached begin to manifest it's got to be more than just quoting what he said but it's living what he said it's a treasure that just struck me today brother Thomas a treasure I treasure it there's not a moment that I or a day that I don't wake up and I thank God for this message there's not a time that I lay my head on the bed at night that I don't thank God for this message cuz I know where I was Brother David I know the life I used to live and I know the joy of my heart tonight I know the love that I have for the things of God tonight but let me just go little let's go on now cuz I don't want to get buried down there but we look here in verse eight it says we are troubled on every side we are troubled we not just you sometimes we think well it's just me no it didn't say me it said we we are troubled it ain't just you it's not just the preachers it's not just the deacons it's not just the pastors it's not just this group this church but the Bible says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed so we look at this and we find a negative connotation and if you're not careful all that you focus on is the negative connotation see we look at the scriptures and oh we're troubled and all we focus on is all the trouble if you just knew what I've been through brother Joe you find people oh come on man they'll lock you up in a meeting and all of a sudden you're out there in the vegetable or the foyer or out side man they want to unload years of trouble I'm like I ain't got enough time for that y'all know uh what was her name Shirley not Shirley C liquor what was her name Sweet Brown no y'all don't watch YouTube do you y'all saved church that's good you're doing a good job brother Thomas well she done had bronc she said ain't nobody got time for that yeah y'all remember her sweet brown or whatever her name was was well that's what no Joe you got to get out of junkyard business and start watching some YouTube but we find here Satan loves to make you feel like you're the only one I'm the only one going through what I'm going through come on somebody I'm the only one brother Joe you don't understand everybody's against me they don't understand my pride I'm the only one dealing with this no you're not there's been sons of God there's been Daughters of God down through 2,000 years down through seven Church ages that's been through what you're going through and they made it let me tell you if they made it you'll make it it wasn't over for them and it ain't over for you but Satan wants you to think you're the only one so we understand that this Christian life is going to have its share of hardships and difficulties but can I tell you they're not permanent they're not permanent the Bible says that we look not at the things which are seen but a lot of times that's all we can put our eyes on is the things that are seen things that are felt things that we you know we go through we look at those things and wow they're they become the reality for most of us but he says we don't look at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen why is that brother Joe why is that Pastor Paul for the things which are seen are temporal otherwise that hardship you're going through is temporal that trial you're facing is temporal that sickness is temporal his temporal what is he saying take your eyes off of that and put your eyes back on the word of God for the things that are not seen the things that you can't see the things that you can't taste the things that you can't feel those things are Eternal those things have value what is he talking about he's talking about faith to overcome Faith to rise up and stand your ground and say it's thus sayith the Lord for me we're going to face difficulties but where where we find these things we're not to look at times we are to look at Jesus look your Prophet preach the message look and live maybe you're not going through what sister Donna is going through tonight and I asked earlier this this morning I said how are you feeling she said it's unbelievable I've never had one fear cuz she's not looking at the diagnosis SE she's not looking at the lump in the breast she's not looking at the scan that the doctor she's looking to looking at the things that are temporal she's looking at the things that are Eternal and if I can get you tonight to take your eyes off the things that are temporal and put your eyes back on the things that are Eternal we will have a Hallelujah meeting tonight they will break forth joy unspeakable and full of Glory on a Wednesday night when it's 16° outside that that spiritual thermometer of the believer is rising above [Music] 100 Jesus is our source of Life Jesus is our source of strength Jesus is our absolute and he's entrusted hear me young people hear me old people he has entrusted his word to you he's hi hidden this treasure in your earn vessel somebody's going to Proclaim it some young people are going to make a declaration I'm going to serve God I'm going to dedicate my life to God why go out there and get scarred up why go out there and come back and face all the trials and all the mind battle let me just spare you young people some things I was 22 23 years old before I got saved I got a lot of battles I got a lot of scars and don't you think for one moment that that devil that enemy that adversary of ours don't try to remind me each and every day but that's I'm trying to share I'm trying to to spare you from those scars tonight I'm sure brother Tommy has a a lot of scars brother Joe has a lot of scars many of us have a lot of scars and we want you tonight the greatest decision that you can can ever make tonight is to surrender it all and say God I'm going to serve you on a Wednesday night I'm going to make a declaration I'm going to serve you tonight I'm going to give you my all I'm going to give you my heart my soul my strength my body my mind everything that I am God I give it to you [Applause] tonight he's entrusted his gospel to his bride amen oh my that just ain't some likeness that ain't just some little little thin milk skin milk let me put it like that no that is Rich he's entrusted his word his message with you and I tonight that means he's found confidence in somebody somebody that'll take him at his word somebody that will look away from calamities and look to the Cross somebody that'll look and see that there was a cross there was a price that was paid and know that that by his strip tonight I am healed that's a finished work it ain't something in the future it ain't something next week it's not next month it's already done I said it's already done for you and if he's by his stripes you are healed I'm here to tell you tonight by those same Stripes you are saved tonight you are delivered tonight you are set free [Applause] tonight oh Hallelujah don't us here now we're going to go into this scripture here we're troubled on every side don't mind if I do every side that word trouble just think of it like this and they would say that it's to be grasped tightly so if you're troubled and you're in somebody's grasp like I'm grabbing this microphone I got it completely surrounded by my hands and it here it means it protrays to be grasped tightly to be squeezed to be brought to distress CU you don't see how you can get out of the antagonist hands how are you going to be removed from the clutch of that trouble no doubt sister Donna when you got that call or when you went to the and got that scan and got the report maybe you felt a little bit of that trouble but the Bible says we're troubled on every side but yet not distressed tonight that word distress there means as though we have no hope as though we have no way of Escape I don't care where the devil has you tonight we are a people that are not in distress tonight we are a people that have hope we have faith we have joy we have the word of God then we come down to the second part of it it says we're perplexed that word perplexed there means sometimes we don't know what to do have any of you ever been to that place in your Christian walk or maybe in your just your Humanity let's just bring it to that place you're facing a decision your place you're facing an obstacle a trial a situation and you just don't know what to do perplexed we're troubled oh my but yet not in distress we're perplexed and there's times we don't know what course to steer or how we're going to be relieved how we're going to be supplied sometimes we're even at an uttermost loss for the things that we face that are temporal but the Bible says yet not in despair that means we're not at a complete loss or absence of hope that's right that's why we look to Jesus and live let me just say this and I'm sure brother Thomas doesn't mind but you can't look to your pastor and live tonight you can't look to Brother Brad another Minister and live tonight young people you can't look to Mama and Daddy you can't look to your favorite preacher you got a to look to Jesus and live you got to look back to the word of God and live tonight because I'm going tell you when the pastor's gone because old age is kicked in and he's gone by the way of the Grave God will still be with you when Mama and Daddy ain't there for you God will still be with you when your friends are forsaken you God will still be with you tonight look to him tonight and live the Bible says also we're persecuted now we all know by persecution it means to be pursued from place to place followed with mines and curses and reproaches laid hold on in prison threatened with the severest tortures but yet the Bible says we're not forsaken oh you may be persecuted you may be sought after but we're not forsaken we're not brother Thomas we have not been abandoned by almighty God you may feel that you're the only one but you're not alone you may feel that everybody's left you and forsaken you but he has never left you nor forsaken you then it says that we are cast down that means to be dashed to Pieces it's kind of a wrestling term and it means that in a wrestling term is when the first one throws the other opponent down then that one that's standing is to conquer and many times we have felt thrown down by the enemy we are felt overwhelmed by the trial by the situation by whatever it is that you're going through and but the Bible says we're cast down but yet not destroyed oh Satan may have thrown you down this evening or this week or this year but let me tell you we're not cast down brother Thomas we get up to fight again we get up to live again we give up to say Amen to the word I'm still coming I'm still believing I'm still trusting tonight though we're troubled on every side though we're perplexed though we're persecuted though we're cast down I don't find one scripture in all of the Old Testament nor in the New Testament brother Tomy it ever says you're defeated did you hear me somebody if you can find one place that you're defe needed let me tell you we might as well walk away and give up but as long as there's not a word in the Bible says that all the scriptures is inspired by God and if all the word is inspired by God and there's not one word written about your demise there's not one word written about your defeat that tells me right there that that devil don't have enough tonight he may put this on you he may put sickness on you he may put cancer on you but I'm here to say it ain't over yet it a ain't over yet Church there's nothing written in the word about your defeat tonight but we can go to the back of the book I said we can go to the back of the book and we can read about his defeat we can read about his demise come on somebody don't you realize you're the you're more than a conqueror tonight though were troubled on every side yet I'm not defeated Romans 8:31 says what shall we say to these things if God be for us who what devil what form what sickness what trial what situation what circumstance who can be against me put it make it personal tonight what situation can be against me when almighty God is for me tonight hell don't have enough for you brother Tommy come on man oh but we can take from the scriptures that as Sons and Daughters of God we're going to face difficulties but we're going to come out we're going to live sister da to fight another day I like what it says in Ephesians 6 and sometimes we we want to put these scriptures here not sure where my voice is going but sometimes we put these as you know maybe Sunday school lessons but this ain't a Sunday school lesson this is a a first Angel a messenger begin to talk to us and begin to prepare us and he says finally my brother be strong in the Lord Paul is saying put your strength won't you envelop yourself in the strength of the Lord not in the strength of your ability not in the strength of your Humanity not in the strength of your ual abilities put your strength in the Lord and the power of His might let me tell you God is going to empower somebody I say Empower me tonight Lord endue me with strength tonight Lord let me draw from you everything that I have need of tonight says put on the whole armor of God the whole armor well this is so nice we taught this in Sunday school brother Joe and we did vaction Bible school and this is so pretty this is a messenger preparing of people how to overcome put on the whole armor of God oh you can do so much and be 99% protected but that 1% if not protected is not covered if not shielded by the grace of God it'll bring your demise notice what he says Now put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against a Wows the cunny Arts the deceit the craftiness the trickery of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood so your brother's not against you can we go ahead and put that on tape tonight your brother's not against you your wife's not against you your husband's not against your wives okay we got a few that's right everybody's kind of quiet on that yeah praise the Lord so we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places otherwise we're wrestling against angels that are fallen from their first State that's right they're fighting you to keep you from reaching where they fell from it's not your brother it's not this and it's not that but we're wrestling we're in a contest we're in a struggle against these things and these principalities or chief rulers beings of their first rank was in the order of their own kingdom and its authorities and rulers of Darkness Emperors of Darkness of the state of things spiritual wickedness in high places in heaven Heavenly places that's where the first battle originated it didn't happen down here in the garden of Adam and Eve but it happened in heaven but we find that's why many Christians even Believers we wrestle against anxieties depression come on church we wrestle against fears we wrestle against these things these are principalities see many Of You' have overcome drugs alcohol Liv in a promiscuous life you know listening to the wrong music and all that you know things that we consider sin but yet we pamper these little things depression it gives us a sense of ownership it empowers us anxieties but I until you don't understand my fears now those are not your fears don't own it they don't belong to you until you accept them you know it's kind of like the rattlesnake story they dropped them off at your door they're not yours until you sign for them quit signing for things that don't belong to you oh we talk about I I ain't got cancer I ain't I ain't signing for that but you signed up for depression oh you signed up for anxiety oh you signed up for fear let me tell you if you cannot sign up for cancer then don't sign up for depression don't sign up for anxiety don't sign up for fear don't sign up for any of those things those are not yours they belong to the devil but God has giving you Joy he's giving you peace he's giving you love he's giving you the fruits of the spirit those what are what belongs to you tonight I was listening to a tape this morning and I started looking at some things and I like what brother brandham says here and putting on the whole armor of God now you had a first messenger talked to you about putting on the whole armor of God in the first age and then you have the seventh messenger come back and preaches a message putting on the whole armor of God this ain't just some Sunday school level mentality message this is for the Bride of Jesus Christ he's trying to tell you what it's going to take to get out of here and brother B says Paul here is speaking of a soldier dressed going to war a soldier getting himself in his armor preparing for battle oh Church we're not in a picnic we're not in a picnic we're in a battle but listen what he says he goes I believe it was Lincoln that said one time in the time of peace prepare for war in the time of peace prepare for war some of you are in a battle some of you in a time of Peace but what are you doing with your time what are you doing in this moment where you're not in battle in the time of Peace there should not be a believer in this church that's not praying for your pastor's wife cuz in the time of peace you may not be the one that's Afflicted with that cancer you may not be the one that's in that trial you may not be the family that's struggling to have your children to serve God and and their Wayward and out their dting you may have all of yours but in the time of Peace come on church I'm talking to you as a church family tonight as the in the time of Peace you prepare you come together as a church family and you prepared to go to battle you prepared to go to war you pray that say God you going to have her you're going to have a testimony you're going to have a witness that cancer is nothing but a blood to almighty God that Satan is defeated in the time of Peace can somebody say in the time of peace I'm going to prepare I'm going to prepare my home I'm going to prepare my life I'm going to prepare my spirit for the battle Gideon in the time of Peace pray like you never prayed before Grace in a time of Peace believe like you've never believed before Brother David in the time of Peace believe give it all to God like you never gave before I'm here to tell you tonight Weston in the time of Peace you're about to take a young lady to be her her head in the time of peace without any other battles you begin to prepare how do you prepare on your knees believing trusting praying seeking God almighty God God lead me God guide me God strengthen me oh God in the time of peace tonight let me prepare my mind let me prepare my soul let me prepare for the battle that's about to rage put on the whole armor of God prepare for battle you're not getting out of here without a battle you may be at peace today but you can be at War tomorrow we as a country about to have a new Administration we're at peace today but we can be at War tomorrow natural types to spiritual what are you doing in your time of Peace how are you preparing in your time of Peace notice oh my man I could have break this up in part two we may have to break it up I may have to cancel my other meeting listen what he says here in God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief do you believe that total separation from unbelief now there's no sin but the sin of unbelief and here a prophet of God I I want to focus on this I want to drive this on this is more than just a Prophet this is the seventh angel this is the messenger to the final age and the messenger said that the people under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age and he's calling for a total complete separation from unbelief he's trying to get a people that'll believe his word and he told him he was told by an Angel if you can get the people to believe oh Hallelujah if you can get the people to believe he didn't say believe you but believe the message that you're preaching then nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer not even a broken home not even a trial not even a situation not even way we're kids nothing will stand before your prayer your prayer your prayer come on somebody your prayer nothing will stand before your prayer but it takes total separation from unbelief well you say brother Joe I believe the message and you still listen to the wrong kind of music brother Jo I believe the message and you're still entertaining their own kind of movies oh brother Jo I believe God sent a prophet the devil does too I'm talking about total separation from unbelief I'm talking about having at home scoured out achen took a Babylonian garment well this ain't going to hurt oh you don't think your dress don't hurt he took a Babylonian garment he didn't even put it on he just took it and he took a wedge of gold and some silver and it cost him his daughters his wife his cattle everything that had his name imprinted on it was destroyed and stoned and the name achan was removed you don't think that it matters it matters God God is calling for total separation and if we're going to be Overcomers if we're going to be those that are alive and remain at his coming Church it starts here it starts tonight this ain't something you put off into your meetings in May or Sunday or your your pastor comes or your favorite preacher comes it starts tonight I am going to separate from all unbelief I'm trying to prepare you notice brother BR as I just read the title now let go to it he said talking about Eve she questioned one little phase of God's word well I thought it was okay to do this no it's not okay we had a messenger come to tell us how we need to live and he says now if she would have remained behind the word fortified behind the word the whole armor of God so he's calling the word or the message of her day the whole armor of God if she would have remained behind it put it all on listen to her husband Oh you mean I got to listen to him again come on he is never right well maybe he is maybe he is for to F behind the whole armor of God notice the word and then we look in John one in the beginning was what the word the Word was God the word was with God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made verse 14 and the word was made flesh that word there is Loos so we're to be fortified behind the logos otherwise the only on the on the day of Pentecost the prophet of God said it was the logos it came and divided itself up and came and indwelled the people they now Brother David were were fully behind the the word of God fortifi behind the word of God they were they put on the whole armor of God and God came in this generation God came in this age when the Pentecostal fires blew out and it went down through the Dark Ages God raised up another Mighty messenger and under his message He restored the truth of of Pentecost and the true genuine filling of the Holy Ghost has been restored back in this day Church Paul had a portion let me tell you a Martin had a portion Wesley had a portion but in this generation you got all the portion you've got the token life on display it is Jesus Christ coming and dwelling and in encapsulating you with the whole armor of God don't you understand you can't make a Rapture without it I'm here to tell you you're not going to make a r without the armor play Church all you want to I'm trying to spare you I ain't saying you're not going to heaven that ain't for me to judge but I'm here to tell you if you don't have the armor of God you don't have the Holy Ghost not some sensation not some snot not some shout not some dance not some emotion I'm talking about having the person tonight if you don't have that you're not going in a Rapture you can find it in the message so while we have the opportunity and your first messenger and your seventh messenger are both telling us put on the whole armor of God because Paul knew what it meant to be filled with the Holy Ghost Paul knew what it meant to receive Revelation from on high and so did William brandham go into a cave and meet with an angel over and over and over he knew what it meant to be in the presence of the pillar of fire let me tell you and there's a people in the land today that knows what it means to be in the presence of the pillar of fire we know what it means to be in the presence of almighty God Hallelujah the whole armor of God is the Holy Ghost fortifi behind the word he says he comes in to try to find something what did he says Satan tries to come in and find something that God did then he tries to find a counteract to it but God God never has to change because he give them his word at the beginning he is infinite he cannot change it will still it's still his word today never changes from the word there he is in the word his church is fortified by the word his first person was fortified Eve but she stepped just for a minute to listen to Satan's tactics so young people when we talk to you about these things we're not trying to be big bad wolf we're not trying to be ugly parents we're not trying to be mean preachers we're trying to help you we're trying to point you to the light trying to show you there's a better way I know you don't believe it but some of us has been where you are when you get about 25 you're going to think man my mom and dad wasn't that dumb after all and then when you get saved and get filled with the Holy Ghost you going be like man I was stupid that preacher was right brother Thomas was right brother Brad was right brother Joe was right let me go on now notice so we find what is Satan's tactics today reasoning well you know really that's just brother brandom's idea that's just his idea this man met with an angel this man was Vindicated over and over and over I'm sorry you may be smart you may be superintelligent have a 180 IQ but I'm going to take this man's understanding over yours any day not trying to be ugly to you I know some of you are very smart and that's good Pat your Chef on the back when service is over but we're talking about equipping oursel to leave this place that when the battle's over we're going to leave when he comes we're going to meet him in the air so we find Satan uses reasoning well that's just brother brandom's idea you know oh my that's just brother Thomas's idea you know he grew up homish I mean he grew up homish now he trying to bring that into the church no that's how some of us think oh he goes to 10 puits you know he's a hillbilly he's on the other side of the you know all he knows how to do is raise goats sometimes that's what we think we think so little of men who are in the presence of God we think so little of people let me just say that not just men but people who are spiritual said there's a there's a Razor's Edge between insanity and spirituality you may think we're insane and let me tell you I hope you think I am cuz I am insanely in love with Jesus that I don't he said well brother Joe you done lost your mind brother Joe you're absolutely right I lost it 20s something years ago and I don't want my old mind back I'm glad to take the mind of Christ let me tell you somebody should be saying oh God let the mind that was in Christ be in me he thought it not robbery to be equal with God and I don't think it robbery tonight to be with him tonight oh Hallelujah to the Lamb of God tonight God is going to have a bride I am that bride God is going to have a church I am that church quit putting it off to another day quit putting it off to another a tonight is tonight today is the day I am that church I am that bride I am that manifested seed I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God I am victorious I am saved I am filled with the Holy Ghost and I am am delivered I am healed I'm set free oh Hallelujah I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb I am that's my testimony what about your testimony my goodness we don't have enough time on a Wednesday night God has provided you the means he's equipped you with the ability in this word to overcome every obstacle that you face every trial every trouble every difficulty Mom and Dad don't you worry about that boy don't you worry about that girl you gave them to God on the Cradle roll you put them in God's hands leave it there if God can't save them you certainly won't but if you believe this word if you believe this message you commit them to God you don't go back and keep digging it up looking at that seed how's it performing all you'll do is mess it up quit trying quit poking quit prying and committ it to God and believe believe that that which you've entrusted in him he will perform because he's entrusted with you his word all right I'm gonna bring this down my good I'm might to skip a lot if I'm here Sunday we may pick this back up I'm not sure but notice I like what brother Brown says you say well brother Joe brother B says well you know you say brother Bram I don't know whether if I can move my hand or not he says you'll never move it as long as you think that that's how some of us think oh we get hurt we get this we get that I can't I can't I can't I'm so tired of hearing I can't what about I can I will I do believe I can I will I do believe I believe he heals my body I believe he saves my children I believe he restores my home I believe he protects my church I can I will and I do believe tonight [Applause] he says believe that that he's done it and go say he's done it and act like he's done it and move every inch if you can't move it just say tomorrow I'll move it a little bit further the next day I'll move it a little bit further the next day I'll move it a little bit further sat said that's as far as you're going to move you say oh no sir no sir Saint says oh sister Donna that's as far as that tumor is going to digress you say oh no sir I got a promise of total healing I got a promise of total Victory if God defeated cancer once he can do it again it ain't over yet I'm here to tell you it ain't over sister Donna God has to final say he said great faith will bring you right out now oh brother Joe I don't have great faith that's how some of us are but that ain't the end of the quote he said a little faith will bring you out anyhow if you'll stay with it oh I wish I had your faith Bulldog Joe it don't take Bulldog faith it takes just a grain of Mustard Seed Faith and if you got faith of a grain of a mustard seed tonight and stay with it and believe it and trust it no matter what the report no matter what you see no matter how you feel and stay with it it'll bring you right out of it Hallelujah a little faith will bring you right out anyhow if you'll stay with it just he said just where you see the r of light follow it stay with it it'll bring you out oh my then he goes and he says now he defeated Satan on his own ground with the word of God and the weakest oh my nobody wants to raise their hand for that one do they the weakest Christian here tonight so he's preaching on a Wednesday night or maybe a Sunday night it don't really matter but he said tonight the weakest Christian here tonight can defeat Satan anywhere come on any place any time under any conditions with thus sayeth the Lord let me tell Ain no devil going to stop my praise ain't no devil going to keep my victory ain't no devil going to rob me of my healing ain't no devil why because my God this word me as a Believer tonight will defeat Satan under any conditions under any ground no matter what it is he said if it's in the belly of a whale if it's in a den of Lies if it's in a bed of cancer almighty God gets to [Music] [Applause] Victory you can't lose Hallelujah all right I'm having a good time up here brother Thomas thank you for inviting me can I go a little further all right praise the Lord Matthew 19: 26 but Jesus beheld them and he said unto them with men this is impossible but with God all things are possible but you say well brother Joe you're saying all things are possible with God certainly we agree to that don't we church but let's just jump over into Mark 9 verse 23 y'all got somewhere y'all showing this nowhere we got nobody run a projector tonight do we oh my goodness that's okay I'll read y'all got your Bibles y'all need to write these two scriptures down because a lot of times we want to put it on God With God all things are possible well God ain't in my flesh right now God ain't in my trial God ain't in my sickness God ain't God God ain't God ain't but With God all things are possible but what about me what about my doctor's report what about my home that's tore up what about my marriage Us in shamas Look what Jesus does so you want to put it all on Jesus and say with Jesus everything's possible and certainly it is but Mark 9 verse 23 Jesus said unto him if thou can't believe if thou cast believe all things are possible to him that believeth so you want to put it on Jesus but Jesus is putting it back into your LA tonight if you can believe if you will believe tonight no matter what you're going through no matter what your trouble no matter what your perplexity no matter what what you're facing tonight if you can believe all things are possible tonight for the believer say brother Joe I believe tonight that have what you ask for ask anything in my name and I'll give it to you tonight that's just sayth the word of God he said you got to believe the impossible in order to have new life then he says in another place the impossibilities Are Made Real when God is taking at his word he said don't doubt anything just go right on believing it'll be all right God promis it God will perform it God watches over his word to keep it and to answer prayer impossible things this is in Jesus came and called but impossible things are made real when God has took at his word The Impossible is made realities when God is taken at his word he goes now how beautiful but even now Lord Lazar is 4 days late Mary had to believe for the impossible but even now Lord whatever you ask whatever you ask God on a Wednesday night even now Lord whatever you ask God it looks like my Situation's over even now Lord whatever you ask the father whatever you ask in my name believing but that's the key is not have an ounce of Doubt mixed in with but believing he said You shall have whatsoever you ask now brother Timothy tells a story and I'm going to repeat it for y'all tonight he there was a king and this King many people came to this King and they asked for all kinds of things King can I can I have a cow king can I have uh uh you know a duck King can I have some bread king and the King just ignored it just ignored it just ignored it he was inundated you know sometimes that's how we do the king but there come a time there was a man brother Tommy that came to this King said King King this is what I want King I need some land King I need about 10 acres of land King I need a I need a house on that land King not only do I need a house on that land I need three or four bedrooms in that house I need a couple bathrooms in that house King I'm about to get married and I'm about to take a wife and I'm we're going to have children I need to make preparations King I'm asking tonight King I'm asking I'm asking you to give me a house you don't gave me a wife you give me some land you give me a house you put furnish in that house King I'm asking for some things and all of a sudden the king says okay permission granted request granted brother Thomas everybody's like well King King why' you do that why don't you give him this one asked for a cow this one asked for a duck this one asked for something so little this one asked for this you just ignored them he said because he's the only one that approached me and and and and said King I want you to give me this because he recognized the authority that I had as a king oh church sometimes we come to God with so many Petty things but God's want you to come to him with great big things don't you think that the great big things is just as easy with God as little bitty things you got to need tonight the god that we serve he's still King Jesus he's still on the throne tonight whatever your need is he's still able to answer don't just ask for small things ask for big things ask for things that only the king can give somebody recognize that this is the only thing that the king can give and the King wants to be recognized as somebody that all your strength come from all your fortunes come from all your blessings come from it come from the King ask the king for big things that's right King I need a trailer on some land for a certain amount of money I'm asking for it I'm not just asking I'm believing for it why because you're a king and I'm subject to you tonight King I'm off my notes but King I need healing King doctors have giving me up King they say I got cancer in my breast King they say it's all through my liing knows but King Jesus I'm coming to you tonight for you are my healer you're the only one that can heal me and deliver me I'm approaching you as my king [Applause] tonight ask something that only a king can [Applause] [Music] give ask ask ask that your Joys be full you parents oh my ask you got children they're drifting ask come on Hattie come on Hade God put it no why did God put that on the tapes why did God see fit to have hady story on the tapes CU he knew at the end of The L C and AG there would be children under the umbrella of the message that would begin to drift and it would take a parents' prayer it would take a parents asking the king recognizing that he's the one that gave him to me and I give them back to you go King now save my children save my son save my daughter save them tonight in the name of Jesus Christ ask the king only something that a king can give ask the king put that first picture up if you would brother mik I'm bringing it down right now I'm not closing I'm bringing it down we land 7:47 you don't land it overnight y'all know what that is right that's a chess board how many chess players do we have here tonight all right we have a several so we understand that in a game of chess there's one there's one figure one piece on this board that matters well what do you mean brother don't look there's pawns there's there's this one there's that one there's the queen I mean come on certainly the queen no what you see here is a chess board it's a game of strategy it's where you as a chess player try to manipulate your opponent into making moves that help you put that player's King see it's all about the king put the king in Checkmate and when their King has no more moves brother Tommy then you can put your chest out check me we would say it in English Today mik drop some of y'all get that tomorrow next slide I hope this comes up pretty good we're bringing it to a close right here so this picture that we're about to look at this picture is a painting that was painted by a famous man by the name of Frederick Fredick RZ he's got several little names in there I'm not going to read all those but this painting once once was uh displayed in the Lou Museum in Paris France you look at this painting and this is a you can't really see all the detail of it if you look back in the back you can really see the detail so everybody turn around real quick and look at the back because this is a much better picture everybody see that stand up if you need to I'm okay I'll preach right here y'all stand up with me we're about to close stand on up and turn around look at that so we look at this painting here and we see that this King we find this man which is the devil here he's being portrayed as a devil and we find the lion here on the far left he has his paw on the skull of another uh maybe a previous victim then you see this Red Feather which is an emblem an ancient emblem of cunningness and Malice and we find that this this King he seems for lawn and the angel in the back is looking at them because this painting is called Checkmate and we look at this and we find here that Satan appears to have so many more pieces of the king's pieces and the King only has just a handful keep looking back there way that's okay I want you to focus on the painting so we see here there's an ancient legend that said that there came a Grandmaster chess Champlain into the Lou Museum one day he came through with a group and they looked at the Mona Lisa o they wound over it but next to the Mona Lisa hung this portrait or this painting and he stopped and he looked at it and he meditated on it and he studied it because we find here this chess board is placed on a coffin so what that's telling you that Satan and this King are playing for the king's Soul so young people you can't play with this message you can't play and gamble with this message cuz Satan is after your king and when he gets your king he gets you he gets your soul and we find here that we look at this and we see that he got this red rooster or this rooster feather in his cap and and his Wicked pieces the king's Wicked pieces he's his own self as the king his Queen is voluptuous female his offices of his devices are laziness anger Pride falsehood doubt and unbelief and the devil is in a winning position and everyone knows it and he's one of the lot of the king's pieces and the devil looks absolutely arrogant while the young king and the angel looking on look extremely anxious and distraught and bewildered and no doubt with his head in his hand like many of us he says how did I get in this condition I've lost it all there's no hope I have no other moves but see this is not just a game of chess church more importantly young people it's a game of life it's a game of life and every day Satan is making moves to try to get you to make moves they say that a good chess player can make one move ahead at a time one move he can think one move ahead at a time a great chess player can make four to five moves ahead at a time but a really great chess player can make 20 moves ahead head at a time so Satan is all about making moves while you're streaming the internet scrolling through and he knows he can just show that click image and when you click there's 20 other moves that he's going to do follow right behind it and see Satan also studies your weaknesses and a lot of times the opponent will make a move to exploit the weakness of his opponent he will make a move knowing that it's going to cost him but he's looking for weaknesses in his opponent and that's what Satan does he does things because he's looking for weaknesses well you say you're a Believer but you got this weakness and then he will exploit that weakness then he will turn that weakness into a habit then he would turn that habit into an addiction and if he can turn it into an addiction then he gets a stronghold in your life and he knows if he can ever gain a stronghold then it's next to impossible for you to defeat him let's carry on keep looking at the painting so the devil concentrates on our weakness and he thinks ahead and he begins to get you to make choice and sometimes you know we're human we make choices on our complexes we make choices on how we feel we make choices on you know if we're you know fear and worry and regret and you know then Satan will begin to blur the lines between right and wrong you know what used to be black and white areas he will mix those and now they're all gray things begin to come in your home that used to not come in your home music you listen to you used to not listen to movies come in your home that you used to would not watch see he begins to blur the lines but the only way to defeat s Satan the only way to defeat your adversary is by believing the truth so the facts may be stacked up against you tonight that yeah we are troubled on every side a lot of my pieces are gone but the truth is we're not in despair the fact is you may be perplexed tonight but the truth is you're not distressed the fact is we may be persecuted and feel the persecution but the truth is you're not forsaken the the facts may be that you've been cast down but the truth is you're not destroyed so the facts may be against you but the truth is on your side tonight so we get back to the painting and back to the legend of the story of this great Grandmaster studying what seems to be ours looking at this picture studying this painting looking at the pieces on the board see this spider at the bottom he's about to spin a web for his next victim my how did my family end up here my how did my marriage end up here how did I end up here I've gone to churches I've studied the message I've gone to meetings I've gone to camps but it seems like the further I go the more I lose and the more the devil takes and this Legend This grandmas he's studying brother Thomas he's studying this picture like you are right now and he's looking at it and he's studying it and all of a sudden he breaks the silence the know the Lou museum is a very quiet dignified place not a whole lot of talking going on kind of like a library and all of a sudden he said wait wait a
