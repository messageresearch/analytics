[4:00] all right let's go to numbers if you
[4:02] will the book of numbers
[4:05] amen
[4:15] the 14th chapter 13th chapter
[4:25] this is after they went and spied out
[4:27] the land and so forth and they were
[4:29] bringing back a report of course the 10
[4:31] spies
[4:35] or was it 12 spies i think it was 12
[4:37] spies 10 had one report and of course
[4:40] joshua and caleb had another report
[4:42] amen and so we want to look at just what
[4:44] they said
[4:46] um
[4:47] let's go with verse 25 of chapter 13.
[4:50] and it turned from searching out the
[4:52] land
[4:53] after 40 days and they went and came to
[4:55] moses and to aaron and to all the
[4:58] congregation of the children of israel
[4:59] unto the wilderness of paran
[5:02] to kadesh
[5:03] and brought back word unto them and unto
[5:06] all the congregation and showed them the
[5:08] fruit of the land and they told him and
[5:11] said we come unto the land wither thou
[5:13] send us to us
[5:14] and surely it floweth with milk and
[5:16] honey and this is the fruit of it
[5:19] nevertheless the people be strong that
[5:21] dwell in this in the land and the cities
[5:23] are walled
[5:24] and very great and moreover we saw the
[5:26] children of enoch there and the
[5:28] amalekites dwelt in the land of the
[5:30] south and the hittites and the jebusites
[5:33] and the amorites dwell in the mountains
[5:35] and the canaanites dwell by the sea and
[5:37] by the coast of jordan and caleb stealed
[5:40] the people before moses and said
[5:42] let us go up at once and possess it for
[5:45] we are well able to overcome it
[5:48] but the men that went up with him said
[5:51] we may not be able to go up against the
[5:53] people for they are stronger than we
[5:55] and they brought up an evil report of
[5:58] the land which they had searched unto
[6:00] the children of israel saying
[6:02] the land though
[6:04] through which we have gone to search it
[6:06] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[6:08] thereof and all the people that saw
[6:11] that we saw in our men of great stature
[6:18] and there we saw the giants the sons of
[6:21] ant
[6:22] which come of the giants and we were in
[6:25] our own side as grasshoppers and so were
[6:29] so in their sight now all the
[6:31] congregation lifted up their voice and
[6:33] cried and the people wept that night and
[6:36] all the children of israel murmured
[6:37] against
[6:38] moses and against aaron and the whole
[6:40] congregation said unto them would god
[6:43] that we had died in the land of egypt
[6:45] for
[6:46] uh with god we had died in this
[6:49] wilderness or would to god we died in
[6:51] this wilderness and wherefore hath the
[6:53] lord brought us into this land to fall
[6:55] by the sword that our wives and our
[6:57] children should be prayed for it not
[6:59] better for us to have returned unto
[7:01] egypt
[7:02] amen and they said
[7:04] and they said one to another let us make
[7:06] a captain let us return
[7:08] unto egypt
[7:10] and mo then moses and aaron fell on
[7:12] their faces before all the assembly of
[7:14] the congregation
[7:15] of the children of israel and joshua the
[7:17] son of nun and caleb the son of jupiter
[7:21] which were of them that searched the
[7:23] land rent their clothes and they spake
[7:25] unto the company of the children of
[7:26] israel saying the land which we pass
[7:28] through to search it is an exceeding
[7:30] good land if the lord therefore delight
[7:33] in us he will bring
[7:35] us into this land and give it to us the
[7:37] land which most uh flowed with milk and
[7:40] honey only rebel not against the lord
[7:43] neither fear ye the people of the land
[7:45] for they are bred for us
[7:47] their defense is departed from them the
[7:49] lord is with us
[7:51] fear them not but all the congregation
[7:53] baits them stoned them with stones and
[7:56] the glory of the lord appeared in the
[7:58] tabernacle of the congregation before
[8:00] all the children of israel and the lord
[8:02] said unto moses how long will this
[8:04] people provoke me
[8:06] how will how long will they be err they
[8:09] believe me
[8:10] for all the signs which i have shown
[8:14] unto them and of course he goes to song
[8:15] talking about how he wanted to smite and
[8:18] so forth and moses fell into breach for
[8:20] him and then in verse 20
[8:23] after he's asked god to pardon him
[8:26] pardon them the lord said verse 20 i
[8:28] have pardoned according to thy word but
[8:30] as truly as i live all the earth shall
[8:32] be filled with the glory of the lord
[8:34] because all those men which have seen my
[8:36] glory and my miracles which i did in
[8:38] egypt and in the wilderness and have
[8:40] tempted me now these ten times they have
[8:43] not hearkened unto my voice surely they
[8:45] shall not see the land
[8:47] which i swear unto their fathers neither
[8:49] shall any of them that provoke me to see
[8:51] it but my servant caleb because he had
[8:53] another spirit with him hath followed me
[8:56] fully him will i bring into the land
[8:58] with the rivers with us whoever he went
[9:01] and his seed shall possess it may god
[9:03] add his blessings to the reading of the
[9:05] word you can be seated amen
[9:08] praise the lord
[9:10] that's right we read a scripture here
[9:12] and i first of all want to say as we
[9:14] talk about
[9:15] atmosphere
[9:17] amen we know
[9:18] uh as the prophet of god said you know
[9:20] it's the atmosphere of anything that
[9:23] does it talking about an egg and how
[9:25] that you can put an egg under a dog or
[9:28] whatever you want to put it under as
[9:29] long as that temperature is right amen
[9:33] then he also mentions on how that
[9:34] there's people that you like to be
[9:36] around and there's others that you just
[9:38] try to avoid
[9:40] amen
[9:42] when you think about atmosphere first of
[9:43] all you have to think about what creates
[9:45] an atmosphere what makes an atmosphere
[9:48] amen and we'll realize when you're
[9:49] talking about creating an atmosphere
[9:51] amen we of course and i look i look at
[9:54] this my my my core i thought thought is
[9:57] we know that it is actually faith that
[9:59] creates a right atmosphere because how
[10:02] many knows faith is positive
[10:05] faith is never negative now prophet told
[10:08] us don't ever if you can possibly help
[10:10] but don't ever let a negative thought
[10:13] go through your mind
[10:15] now when you think about negative you
[10:16] think about everything that this world
[10:19] is and everything about this world is
[10:22] negative
[10:23] there isn't hardly anything there's
[10:26] absolutely nothing uh
[10:29] positive about this world
[10:34] amen when you think about politics it's
[10:37] absolutely polluted there's nothing
[10:39] positive about politics nothing positive
[10:42] about any of animation
[10:45] huh
[10:47] we know that the world is dying
[10:49] i mean it was the bible declared that
[10:52] this world is going to die and it's in
[10:54] the process of dying
[10:56] that's not positive that's negative
[11:01] he meant i used the word dying but you
[11:04] know the bible says that heavens and
[11:06] earth and then when somebody dies
[11:09] we say that they passed away
[11:12] right
[11:13] and the bible said that heavens and
[11:15] earth shall die or pass away
[11:19] amen so there there's nothing positive
[11:21] there there's only one hope
[11:23] praise the lord and how many know
[11:26] that's in jesus christ and you can't get
[11:29] anything from jesus christ outside of
[11:32] faith
[11:33] so faith is what does it i believe that
[11:36] we as believers we're so i'm so great
[11:38] i'm glad i was thinking on the way to
[11:40] church so how did i'm so glad
[11:43] amen that god has given us something
[11:45] that we can be positive about
[11:53] there's only one hope i mean there's
[11:55] only one chance
[11:58] for anybody in this world and that's
[12:00] jesus christ
[12:02] there's only one hope that the bible
[12:04] says in this world that is the coming of
[12:06] the lord jesus
[12:08] it's funny how i hear it different tapes
[12:10] he speaks about he says there's no
[12:11] there's absolutely no hope outside of
[12:14] the coming of the lord
[12:15] and what a hope that is
[12:18] folks it is no wonder that people
[12:22] are druggies and tattooed up and
[12:25] everything out they're tormented
[12:27] they're depressed
[12:31] they have nothing to be happy about they
[12:34] have no future
[12:38] but that's not you and i
[12:40] [Applause]
[12:42] how many months there have the right
[12:44] atmosphere around you
[12:46] amen and that is what the holy spirit
[12:51] for the faith brings the holy spirit
[12:55] you know joshua and caleb were the kind
[12:58] of people that you really want to hang
[13:00] with
[13:04] because even god said there was a
[13:06] different spirit about them
[13:09] how many knows what that spirit is that
[13:11] spirit is a spirit of faith
[13:14] they were not grumblers they were not
[13:16] complainers
[13:19] god got sick of israel and how
[13:22] oh my
[13:23] think about it if god did not let one of
[13:26] those parents go into the promised land
[13:28] because they would not believe his signs
[13:31] and his wonders that he did
[13:35] what about this generation
[13:38] that still has the tapes of every sign
[13:40] every wonder everything that's still
[13:42] there that can still hear it they can
[13:44] still see it and hear the signs and the
[13:46] wonders that god has done in this
[13:48] generation
[13:50] because remember buddha baptism says
[13:52] those tapes will be played on judgment
[13:54] day in front of people
[13:57] neither will god spare this generation
[13:59] god did every sign every wonder that is
[14:02] imaginable to get people's attention
[14:06] and yet
[14:07] they go on in sin
[14:09] they go on and i believe notice how god
[14:12] said these ten times have i got to try
[14:15] to get them to believe me
[14:17] no matter what their circumstance is
[14:23] huh
[14:26] and i'm so grateful tonight aren't you
[14:28] glad tonight that that it doesn't matter
[14:32] what your circumstance is
[14:34] i don't care if it's death itself
[14:37] staring you in the face you can be
[14:39] positive you can have joy
[14:46] because it's nothing but a vehicle to
[14:48] take you over yonder
[14:51] oh my praise be to god
[14:55] all right never let a negative thought
[14:58] go through your mind
[14:59] every promise every word of god is what
[15:03] yea
[15:04] the bible says
[15:06] it's yes
[15:07] it's positive it's short
[15:10] it's a promise
[15:12] it can't fail
[15:16] amen nobody knows that you and i
[15:19] are amateur creators
[15:23] not only amateur creators but in order
[15:26] to be an amateur creator you have to be
[15:28] an amateur god
[15:35] oh my i love this
[15:39] your amateur amateur god
[15:42] a minor god
[15:45] how many know that we were given
[15:46] dominion over big bulls
[15:49] coming at you through the field
[15:51] we were given dominion over hornets that
[15:54] are fixed to take you out
[15:57] we were giving dominion over to storms
[16:00] and over the weather
[16:01] [Music]
[16:04] we were given dominion over lions it
[16:06] don't matter what it is we were given
[16:08] dominion over all of the animals all of
[16:11] the world
[16:13] that's what god told adam i give you
[16:14] dominion over all of it
[16:17] man
[16:18] amateur
[16:20] god didn't he say one place you know
[16:23] that if we really had faith we could go
[16:26] create a world and go live on it
[16:29] well i don't know about you brother
[16:30] glenn but i got i want to make sure that
[16:33] i create this world the way it's
[16:34] supposed to be huh
[16:37] amen by faith create the atmosphere
[16:40] around you
[16:45] create the atmosphere for your life
[16:50] huh
[16:52] that's who it benefits first folks
[16:55] man claims to be a christian the biggest
[16:57] benefit from beneficiary from that is a
[17:00] wife
[17:02] and then the children
[17:04] and so forth on down then the neighbors
[17:06] and everywhere else
[17:09] folks if we can't have that world under
[17:11] going to control i know where are we
[17:13] ever going to create worlds
[17:15] i wrote down here says you know we do
[17:17] create our through faith we do create
[17:19] our atmosphere
[17:22] that we are
[17:23] and as a family as a mom as a dad we're
[17:26] responsible to create an atmosphere that
[17:28] the children can hatch
[17:32] so that they'll help from just him dad i
[17:34] want what you got mom i want what you
[17:36] got
[17:39] huh
[17:40] as bosses our workers should be able to
[17:42] say i want what you have boss
[17:46] and if the servant is a christian and
[17:48] maybe the boss ain't the boss should be
[17:49] able to look at that servant say look i
[17:51] don't know what you got but i need what
[17:52] you got
[17:55] huh
[17:57] praise the lord
[18:00] the right mental attitude towers the
[18:03] word of god brother man says we'll bring
[18:06] every promise of god to pass
[18:11] what kind of attitude that god do you
[18:13] have to have
[18:15] praise the lord
[18:17] oh my
[18:19] we got to have an attitude
[18:21] like joshua and like caleb did
[18:23] him in the holy spirit atmosphere
[18:26] faith to believe that it doesn't matter
[18:28] how big the giants are
[18:32] do you realize that tonight that those
[18:36] the thing that that that uh keeps you
[18:39] from having joy unspeakable
[18:43] those devils that try to keep me from
[18:45] that they're big
[18:46] [Applause]
[18:50] they're like the sons of mana they don't
[18:52] want you to have any peace they don't
[18:54] want you have any joy
[18:57] they don't want you to go to church
[19:00] and if you do go to church they don't
[19:01] want you to get anything
[19:03] and they'll keep you from it you'll be
[19:05] sitting in your peers and that devil of
[19:08] america will keep you from getting joy
[19:10] keep you from getting peace
[19:12] if you possibly can
[19:15] by coming up in your mind and trying to
[19:17] control it
[19:21] praise the
[19:22] lord me just say it you got to get your
[19:25] mind right
[19:28] before you can get your heart right
[19:30] because your mind is the womb to the
[19:32] soul
[19:34] that right
[19:35] praise the lord i like that i was
[19:38] looking for the excellent spirit
[19:40] you know and i believe that joshua had
[19:42] an excellent spirit caleb had an extra
[19:44] something about his spirit i mean as we
[19:46] all carry a spirit
[19:51] and some spirits you like to be around
[19:53] some spirits you don't really like to be
[19:55] around
[19:56] i think another way to church you know i
[19:58] can probably mention a person's name who
[20:00] i really don't care around to be around
[20:03] too much
[20:05] going to mention a name because that
[20:07] just be mean
[20:09] we can't be doing that up here
[20:11] but anyway right
[20:14] think about it
[20:15] just negative negative negative negative
[20:22] i like joshua i like caleb god like
[20:24] caleb he says caleb
[20:27] you're my kind of guy
[20:29] isn't it something how that there's an
[20:31] atmosphere that even comes with our
[20:33] names
[20:36] then brother says don't call them
[20:38] ricketts don't call them elvises
[20:42] rats and cats and everything else he
[20:44] says what if my god he says if you name
[20:46] the shot change it if you ain't better
[20:48] there's something that comes with that
[20:53] that's why we got so many
[20:55] johns and paul's right
[20:57] [Applause]
[20:58] we got gelato joshuas
[21:02] why because of that great man that he
[21:05] was that come with that name
[21:07] or david's
[21:10] huh
[21:12] i don't know about thomas
[21:20] they call him downton thomas
[21:23] well let me tell you something i think
[21:25] he made it so we're all right
[21:28] he just had to see the bleach
[21:30] he just had to touch the side
[21:33] but you know one thing thomas did was
[21:35] confirm
[21:36] that jesus wasn't just the son of god or
[21:40] the second person in the trinity
[21:43] he says my lord and my god and he fell
[21:47] down and worshipped him and jesus never
[21:49] said no you can only worship the father
[21:51] no he had it right
[21:54] praise be to god
[21:56] all these different names you think
[21:58] about it
[22:00] i mean i think about you know there's
[22:01] not many
[22:03] many people i was going to say not very
[22:05] many smart people
[22:07] that named their children cain
[22:10] or dave or korra
[22:13] huh
[22:14] because of what came with the lies that
[22:16] they lived
[22:19] amen but mary's
[22:21] martha's
[22:23] not right
[22:24] elizabeth
[22:27] different ones like that many names that
[22:29] we have around today
[22:31] this many thousands of years later
[22:33] because of the atmosphere and what came
[22:36] with those people
[22:39] people of faith
[22:40] people that believe god
[22:43] praise be to god
[22:45] oh my an attitude of faith
[22:49] i like it
[22:52] now
[22:53] we know that
[22:55] god
[23:00] by faith
[23:06] we know that through faith
[23:08] we understand
[23:10] that the worlds were framed by the word
[23:13] of god
[23:15] i mean that was god believed his own
[23:17] word
[23:18] [Music]
[23:19] i read brother banham uh a quote i
[23:22] didn't bring it with him but he says you
[23:23] know he believed in his own word and he
[23:26] spoke his own word
[23:28] and he come into existence
[23:31] and he says that's the way that it is
[23:32] for you and for me even jesus said
[23:35] whatsoever things you desire when you
[23:38] ask them believe that you'll receive
[23:41] them and you will have them
[23:44] paul said the life that i now live i
[23:46] live by the faith of the son of god i
[23:50] mean believe that's what we live by
[23:52] that's what you and i live by is the
[23:54] faith of almighty god it ain't your
[23:56] faith it ain't somebody else's faith is
[23:58] god's own faith
[24:03] the very faith he had
[24:05] how that ought to give us
[24:09] faith
[24:11] to know that when we ask anything
[24:14] god will grant it to you
[24:17] we try to add so many things to it but
[24:19] that's what jesus says
[24:21] you know jesus was always a positive
[24:23] person
[24:25] he had an atmosphere around him didn't
[24:26] he
[24:28] you want to look at one go with me let's
[24:30] look at one mark nine
[24:33] you know it doesn't matter you could go
[24:35] on and on and on it's like the woman at
[24:37] the well or like the woman that was
[24:39] caught in the act of adultery isn't that
[24:41] right he didn't go there and he said now
[24:43] did you really do it
[24:45] did he
[24:46] no they had already judged that they
[24:48] were caught in a very axe and there was
[24:50] no getting around it
[24:53] huh
[24:55] she was guilty she should have died
[24:58] along with him but what did he say
[25:02] he that is without sin cast the first
[25:04] stone
[25:05] and none of them could cast the first
[25:07] stone
[25:08] was he mean to her no he had an
[25:10] atmosphere of forgiveness
[25:13] he says where are those he that
[25:15] condemned me
[25:16] he says i have none
[25:18] and jesus says
[25:20] neither do i condemn thee
[25:24] go in sin no more
[25:26] huh wasn't that awesome
[25:29] here a man
[25:32] in verse 17 of chapter 9
[25:34] and one of the multitudes answered and
[25:36] said master i have brought unto thee my
[25:39] son which had a dumb spirit and whether
[25:41] so ever he taketh him he teareth him and
[25:44] he foameth and gnashes out his teeth can
[25:45] you imagine and pineth away
[25:49] and i speak to your disciples should
[25:51] cast him out and they could not
[25:54] and he answered him he answering him and
[25:57] said oh faithless generation how long
[25:59] will i be with you how long shall i
[26:01] suffer you bring him to me
[26:05] and he brought him to him and when he
[26:07] saw him straightway to spirit tear him
[26:10] and he fell to the ground and wallowed
[26:12] foaming
[26:13] and he asked his father how long has it
[26:16] been since it came upon him and he said
[26:17] of a child
[26:19] and oftentimes it has
[26:21] cast him in the fire and in the waters
[26:23] to destroy him but if thou can't do
[26:25] anything
[26:26] have compassion on us and help us
[26:30] can you imagine a parent
[26:32] yeah you would say lord if you can do
[26:34] anything please do it
[26:36] help us if you can boy they come to the
[26:39] right place
[26:42] how many knows whenever you bring your
[26:44] troubles to jesus you've come to the
[26:46] right place
[26:48] you're bringing it to the right person
[26:51] hallelujah
[26:54] and listen to a positive look at how he
[26:57] said now what you know jesus didn't say
[26:59] now i'm not sure if i can do this
[27:02] he didn't say have you got any sin in
[27:04] your life
[27:07] he didn't make any listen to what he
[27:08] says jesus said unto them if thou canst
[27:12] believe
[27:15] all things are possible to him that
[27:18] believeth
[27:22] he said i want you to know anything's
[27:24] possible with god
[27:26] if you can believe it anything can
[27:28] happen
[27:31] and straightway the father of the child
[27:33] cried out and said with tears lord i
[27:36] believe help they all might unbelieve
[27:39] hallelujah
[27:41] that's what i say tonight lord help our
[27:42] unbelief
[27:48] we could go so much higher we could just
[27:50] believe more
[27:51] amen
[27:54] and when jesus saw that the people were
[27:56] coming running together remember it was
[27:58] a big big multitude there
[28:00] he rebuked that foul spirit saying in
[28:02] him thou them and death spirit i charged
[28:05] he come out of him and entered no man
[28:09] into him no more into him and the spirit
[28:11] cried out and
[28:12] rent him soaring came out of him and he
[28:15] was as one dead in as much as that man
[28:17] he said he is dead but jesus took him by
[28:20] the hand and lifted him up and he arose
[28:22] praise be to god
[28:25] how many knows there he was and look
[28:27] what god did and the thing that he said
[28:29] is what i wanted to bring is look what
[28:30] jesus said amen they were in that
[28:33] terrible condition he told him look i
[28:35] want you you need to be able to believe
[28:36] what was brother branham's theme song
[28:38] when he come out only believe all
[28:41] all things are possible to them that
[28:43] believe
[28:46] there'd be times where just as few
[28:48] people would get uh you know healed or
[28:50] whatever in the meeting and there would
[28:52] be times when the holy spirit would come
[28:53] down and heal everybody
[28:56] other places the whole place it gets
[28:58] smoky the holy the presence of god would
[29:01] just come down
[29:05] amen in that what we desire
[29:08] for god's presence to come down
[29:10] makes all the difference in the world
[29:14] praise be to god
[29:16] love i just love him don't you
[29:19] amen
[29:24] think about this one here how many knows
[29:26] that god loves to try our faith
[29:29] really believe him
[29:30] what is the right mental attitude look
[29:32] at the right mental attitude that brings
[29:35] things to pass
[29:40] he said and be certain of god
[29:43] he says you know he loves to test us
[29:47] he says he'd love to see the reaction of
[29:49] your faith did you know that
[29:51] god likes to see how you'll react when
[29:53] you say lord i believe remember
[29:56] jesus one place he said to that woman
[29:58] there was a gentile he said you know
[30:00] it's not meat to give the children's
[30:02] bread to dogs
[30:05] wow
[30:07] what that would have might have done to
[30:08] her you know
[30:10] but he was testing her
[30:12] see how how serious she really was
[30:16] because how many knows jesus loves
[30:19] perseverance
[30:21] he loves people that are determined
[30:25] because i want you to know something how
[30:27] many believes god keeps his word
[30:30] when he says something the prophet of
[30:31] god said you know listen god has to keep
[30:34] he has to honor that word
[30:36] if you will do your part
[30:39] and believe with all your heart god is
[30:41] obligated to dress
[30:44] praise be to god it doesn't matter what
[30:46] it is folks
[30:48] amen
[30:51] oh let's go on
[30:53] you say well oh lord thou art my healer
[30:55] thou art my savior i believe that you
[30:57] are a healer i believe that you are the
[30:59] one who gives the holy spirit
[31:01] and the things that i'm
[31:02] requiring and you are the god who gives
[31:05] that
[31:06] and then when you confess all of your
[31:08] sins and promise god that you'll do
[31:10] you'll do if he'll uh gives you that
[31:13] he says he'll let you get well and then
[31:15] because it don't happen you run off like
[31:18] a coward somewhere
[31:20] huh
[31:22] because it's not always a matter it's
[31:24] not a matter of having it done right
[31:26] away
[31:28] it's not always the right attitude
[31:30] towards god's promises
[31:32] that brings the past it's not always
[31:34] right away
[31:37] no not always
[31:39] but if you'll be like john ryan huh
[31:42] like john ryan for weeks
[31:45] even had to go back in line
[31:49] and brother baptism says do you believe
[31:50] what i told you he said yes i do then
[31:53] why are you doubting why are you back
[31:54] here again
[31:55] he says get out of here basically go on
[31:58] and confess
[32:01] and he went everywhere confessing thank
[32:04] you lord jesus for healing me
[32:08] everywhere thank you for healing
[32:09] blindness and bad people making fun of
[32:11] it don't matter
[32:14] one day
[32:16] the angel caught up with him
[32:18] might we say
[32:20] because when the angel comes right to
[32:22] confirm it
[32:24] even i imagine
[32:26] imagine their bells of heaven were
[32:28] ringing and every time he say i i
[32:30] confess i'm healed thank god i'm healed
[32:33] read all about it right
[32:36] here up there say jesus say hey god say
[32:38] hey man we gotta we gotta make this good
[32:41] he's confessing it in front of everybody
[32:44] there on that barber chair hello
[32:47] his eyes came open
[32:49] didn't matter at all
[32:52] he confessed it held on to it god made
[32:55] it good
[32:56] i hope that's a lesson to somebody here
[32:58] or out there just remember when
[33:01] you
[33:03] you're healing it's not a matter of just
[33:05] that really meaning
[33:10] because you run off and say well god
[33:12] didn't do it listen to what the prophet
[33:14] says listen
[33:16] he says you run off like a coward god
[33:18] can't use that there's no way for him to
[33:21] use you there's no way for him to answer
[33:23] you because he only answers by faith
[33:27] how many please
[33:28] that god only answers by faith
[33:33] then all of a sudden you go away and he
[33:35] can't answer but real true faith stands
[33:38] there
[33:39] being sure that god is be certain that
[33:42] he is
[33:44] amen
[33:46] praise be to god
[33:48] he is sure just like joshua like caleb
[33:50] they didn't know
[33:52] but they knew that god could do it
[33:55] joshie was the same way he was a i love
[33:57] a leader like joshua he didn't have to
[33:59] see it to believe it
[34:01] he just followed the spirit went over
[34:03] there crossed over
[34:05] the yard and went under the other side
[34:07] and started running around
[34:09] jericho
[34:12] marching around jericho he didn't know
[34:14] how many times
[34:16] he just did it one day another day
[34:18] another day
[34:19] another day and then it is just
[34:20] according to the word of the lord
[34:24] how many knows that we've got these
[34:26] angels all around us
[34:28] all the hosts of heaven are behind
[34:31] people that believe
[34:41] i'm trying to think of quote brother
[34:42] brahm says if everybody in here would
[34:44] genuinely believe nobody would be feeble
[34:46] or wanting the holy ghost in the next
[34:48] five minutes
[34:53] amen
[34:55] we don't have many people here tonight i
[34:56] don't know what you need
[34:58] but who knows you wouldn't have the knee
[34:59] to that in the next five minutes if you
[35:01] could just believe
[35:04] say it's mine
[35:06] praise the lord
[35:08] amen
[35:14] i'm glad are you glad
[35:18] remember in the bible it says let us
[35:20] rejoice and be glad
[35:22] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[35:26] and we're glad we've lived for cheap lab
[35:30] day when i was born again glad day when
[35:33] i was born again
[35:35] amen you asked me why i'm happy so i'll
[35:38] just tell you what huh
[35:40] be glad how many beliefs you can be bad
[35:42] not very many people out there are glad
[35:46] but i'm glad tonight
[35:48] why because in the most negative world
[35:51] you can have an atmosphere of joy
[35:56] how many knows faith is light doubt is
[35:58] darkness
[36:01] a man of faith brings light to your
[36:03] world
[36:06] it brings hope to your world and what is
[36:08] light
[36:10] before the
[36:12] led come along the light was heat
[36:16] right it was hot
[36:17] just like the sun when the sun's out
[36:19] that light is shining it's warm
[36:22] so is faith
[36:24] it brings the light of the gospel into
[36:26] people's lives and it brings a warmth
[36:31] hallelujah
[36:33] just like
[36:34] people worshiping the lord tonight the
[36:36] atmosphere we have here
[36:38] it brings the warmth
[36:41] how many knows the old time holy spirit
[36:44] never won't go near it that's the reason
[36:46] people fear it
[36:48] and it's good enough for me the holy
[36:50] spirit brings warmth it brings love
[36:54] it brings worship
[36:56] like brother baby some churches you go
[36:58] into it it feels like there's icicles
[37:00] hanging from the chandeliers
[37:03] it's so chilly
[37:05] jesus christ came to die tonight for
[37:09] sinners and nobody says the word just
[37:12] quiet as it melts
[37:17] i mean as preachers get worried we get
[37:19] worried when everybody gets so quiet
[37:23] you know why
[37:24] because the word of god really doesn't
[37:25] have an effect on you
[37:28] because if it really has an effect on
[37:30] you you know you know what i came up
[37:31] with a revelation tonight brother i mean
[37:33] today brother glenn he says whenever
[37:35] you're preaching
[37:36] if it's if in order for it to really do
[37:39] any good you got to be filled with the
[37:40] holy ghost
[37:45] or you may be a sinner and god work on
[37:47] your heart
[37:49] but just to sit there and be unholy
[37:52] ghost filled and just sit there you're
[37:54] just bump on the law
[37:58] it don't mean much
[38:00] [Applause]

[38:16] foreign i'm not in here what is it
[38:19] called the seed of the soul scornful
[38:24] that's right
[38:25] oh the critical
[38:28] god got fed up god don't like it either
[38:32] he don't like negative people he don't
[38:33] like uh you know a bad atmosphere around
[38:37] people
[38:39] prophet didn't
[38:40] we don't
[38:42] amen
[38:44] oh my praise god

[38:49] an atmosphere

[47:59] couple more and we'll go to the house
[48:01] so we look here
[48:03] amen world i mean this world is promised
[48:06] to burn
[48:08] yeah
[48:09] there's nothing nothing good about that
[48:11] it's going to be a hot atmosphere after
[48:13] a while
[48:14] even the elements shall melt with
[48:16] fervent heat
[48:18] heavens and earth to pass away their
[48:20] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[48:23] but you and i
[48:26] we're glad
[48:28] why
[48:29] because we ain't got to worry about that
[48:30] fire
[48:32] we're standing where the fire has
[48:34] already been
[48:36] aren't you glad
[48:38] praise god we ain't got to worry about
[48:41] judgment
[48:43] you got to worry about the second
[48:45] resurrection that all the people of all
[48:48] ages all the way from genesis being
[48:51] gathered to that great judgment day
[48:54] we'll be with christ after we've enjoyed
[48:57] three and a half years with him at the
[49:00] marriage supper isn't that right
[49:03] and then
[49:04] we live for a thousand years isn't that
[49:06] right come back on earth well we're
[49:08] coming back on earth
[49:10] how many sad we're coming back
[49:14] amen
[49:15] so the world
[49:17] the heavens and the earth are
[49:19] promised the fire but you don't have to
[49:21] worry i don't have to worry
[49:23] because we're standing and living
[49:26] where the holy spirit fire
[49:29] has already been
[49:32] praise be to god
[49:34] remember brother baum says that it's
[49:36] going to be a mixture of a holy fire
[49:40] that's going to burn every devil every
[49:42] germ every sickness every kind of sin
[49:44] and all that is going to be burnt
[49:47] amen there's going to be no evil he's
[49:49] going to be none of that he says that's
[49:50] the way it is with a believer god comes
[49:52] down with the holy ghost fire and he
[49:54] kills every devil every attitude every
[49:57] bad thing about us
[50:00] he burns it out of us
[50:02] because if you don't get it burned out
[50:04] of you now
[50:06] guess what you got another fire coming
[50:09] it's going to burn sooner or later you
[50:10] don't want that in it
[50:12] you want it out of there
[50:15] because it's going to burn sooner or
[50:16] later i want to have it burnt down
[50:19] send it on up
[50:22] some men sins follow them after they die
[50:26] but other men sins go up beforehand unto
[50:30] judgment
[50:33] how many wants to repent of their sin
[50:35] and
[50:36] and confess their faults and our hands
[50:38] raise up and say yeah i lord i'm gonna
[50:40] do that now i'm gonna send it up
[50:42] beforehand
[50:43] because we know that there's mercy now
[50:47] there'll be no mercy there but where's
[50:49] mercy now so we're putting it out there
[50:50] god i don't want to be like this take
[50:52] this out of my life take that out of my
[50:54] life
[50:56] clean me make me more like you god
[50:59] amen
[51:02] praise be to god
[51:04] you love him amen
[51:07] amen
[51:08] darkest hour
[51:10] we're standing when the fire has already
[51:12] been
[51:14] and we're walking in the light
[51:16] the beauty
[51:18] for light
[51:20] it's not much beauty out there
[51:23] but the light that you're walking in
[51:25] is beautiful
[51:27] it's beautiful why
[51:30] your sins are gone your sins are taken
[51:32] care of
[51:33] it's all under the blood
[51:38] how many knows that a christian
[51:40] was dead
[51:42] in sins and trespasses
[51:44] but now we've been what
[51:47] quickened
[51:49] made alive
[51:52] how many glad to be alive
[51:55] amen
[51:57] living
[51:59] in the holy ghost
[52:01] there's nothing like it
[52:04] there's absolutely nothing like living
[52:06] in the holy ghost
[52:12] i was studying i got my message and had
[52:15] a lot of my thing notes together so i
[52:16] went outside and cleaning along the pool
[52:19] a little bit here there and doing this
[52:20] that or the other and
[52:22] i got to thinking and something said you
[52:23] know what are you doing out here
[52:25] washington i got more for you
[52:28] i got a murphy and i thought you know
[52:31] i thought people you know i thought
[52:32] about saying telling you this you know i
[52:34] hear a voice a voice i hear a voice
[52:38] now people are
[52:41] people hearing voices right you got to
[52:42] watch folks say they hear voices
[52:45] and if you notice i don't say voices
[52:48] i say voice
[52:50] one voice i don't hear a bunch of voices
[52:51] because man people that do that they
[52:54] it's not too good
[52:56] amen i think tommy sent me something
[52:58] about talking about he's got you know
[53:01] jesus on one side and
[53:03] the devil on the other side you know but
[53:04] somehow he's deaf in one ear
[53:08] yeah
[53:09] that's what i want to be whoever the
[53:11] devil is i'm deaf i can't hear what he
[53:12] does
[53:13] he says he'll see he'll try to tell you
[53:15] you ain't saved or you ain't gonna make
[53:16] it just shut up i'm different that ear
[53:21] all right
[53:22] but i like to clearly clearly be able to
[53:24] hear this other voice telling me you're
[53:26] my son
[53:28] i love you i'm your father
[53:31] i'll never leave you no forsake you
[53:33] i'll always take care of you
[53:36] yeah i hear all kinds he tells me how
[53:38] kind of thing
[53:40] he tells me what to preach
[53:43] huh
[53:44] i was up at my office this afternoon and
[53:46] i says now lord here i am
[53:49] and i i'm waiting on you to give me a
[53:52] message lord
[53:55] you know and and
[53:57] sometimes i have to wait but not today
[53:59] it wasn't five seconds later this come
[54:01] to my mind and it just began to roll and
[54:04] you know i had preached on this a lot of
[54:05] times before but i thought about how
[54:07] jesus was so positive
[54:09] when people were in all kinds of trouble
[54:11] he always had hope for him
[54:13] he always created an atmosphere just
[54:14] believing anything's possible
[54:17] telling his disciples after they were
[54:20] amazed at that
[54:22] fig tree being wilted and so forth wow
[54:24] look at that and he says i'll tell you
[54:26] what i want you to understand that if
[54:28] you have faith as a grain of mustard
[54:30] seed you can say to that mountain be
[54:32] moved
[54:34] and if you don't doubt it'll
[54:36] happen amen
[54:39] always i thought about christ and how
[54:40] positive he was the atmosphere that he
[54:42] was he was certainly a person that he'd
[54:44] love to be around
[54:47] a chris how many knows a christian is
[54:49] somebody that you love to be around it's
[54:52] just your atmosphere
[54:54] how are you
[54:56] you know
[54:57] it's always concerned about you caring
[55:00] about you
[55:02] man it's just something about it
[55:04] but i thank god for
[55:06] voice that we hear
[55:08] that still small voice that we can hear
[55:10] every day how many here is that
[55:17] how many knows that sometimes it's so
[55:19] quiet you gotta listen
[55:29] you know when i was out there watching
[55:30] and something said you know there's more
[55:33] i thought you know i could have just
[55:34] thought that but no i believe it was him
[55:39] and some of these things that you know i
[55:41] just begin to think about the world how
[55:42] it's how it's promised to burn but we're
[55:45] standing where the fire's already been
[55:47] and all these little things you just say
[55:48] thank you jesus
[55:50] you're so awesome
[55:52] it don't matter
[55:55] aren't you glad that you don't have to
[55:57] just be in this atmosphere while you're
[55:58] sitting in church
[56:02] it don't have to be
[56:05] but i'm convinced that we get so busy
[56:06] sometimes that we don't have time for
[56:08] this atmosphere
[56:10] we don't take time for this atmosphere
[56:11] like i told you sunday i get frustrated
[56:13] with myself
[56:15] because i get too busy
[56:17] you know i had gotten away to where i
[56:19] wasn't listening to hardly anything but
[56:21] maybe before bed a little bit and
[56:23] sometimes during the day going somewhere
[56:25] but folks in the last couple of weeks
[56:26] i've gotten to where i like to go to bed
[56:28] with it
[56:30] huh
[56:31] i like to put on this
[56:33] on on instead of having a fan by my head
[56:36] i'll take my phone or my ipad and i will
[56:38] have a scribbling stream sound
[56:42] right
[56:43] but you know anymore it's i'll play
[56:46] brother branham until i fall asleep and
[56:47] wake up and then i'll shut it off and
[56:49] then put it on the ripley stream but i
[56:50] want to go to the bible says you know
[56:52] when you lay on your bed when you get up
[56:54] at night in the morning when you go to
[56:56] bed in the middle of the day keep your
[56:57] heart mind on it makes a difference
[57:00] many differences it's too easy to get
[57:02] away from that folks
[57:03] and then your christian life
[57:07] relax
[57:08] relax
[57:10] amen
[57:11] i don't know about you but
[57:12] i want to get closer to god
[57:14] while the world is getting further away
[57:16] you and i
[57:18] are getting closer
[57:19] amen god bless you let's stand tonight
[57:22] amen
[57:28] musicians if you want to come
[57:43] heads bowed
[57:45] honest hearts
[57:47] you need more of that atmosphere in your
[57:49] life
[57:50] god bless you god bless you
[57:53] all of our hands lord
[57:54] i need more of that atmosphere in my
[57:57] life
[57:58] so that those around us
[58:00] lord will feel that atmosphere that
[58:02] warmth
[58:03] if there's a son and daughter of god
[58:05] perhaps they'll even so to speak come to
[58:08] christ
[58:09] and they'll be able to say
[58:11] i don't know what you have but i need
[58:13] what you have i want what you have
[58:15] it's desirable
[58:18] god help us lord to create that
[58:20] atmosphere more
[58:21] lord to redeem our time more lord
[58:23] whatever it takes to have more
[58:25] atmosphere lord we ask god that you'd
[58:27] help us to make time
[58:29] father forgive us of where we slack lord
[58:31] and where we're not what we ought to be
[58:33] father tonight
[58:34] lord jesus may we have the atmosphere
[58:37] that faith creates
[58:39] lord jesus for we know that faith is
[58:41] always positive never negative lord and
[58:43] always looking at the promise of god
[58:45] we're looking to your word just as hard
[58:48] as we can
[58:49] because if we get our eyes off of you
[58:51] and get it on this world it'll certainly
[58:53] be depressing and we don't want to be
[58:54] depressed lord help us to keep our eyes
[58:56] on you
[58:58] and lord about your word and what you
[59:00] have told us lord jesus to create our
[59:02] world
[59:03] that we live on
[59:05] father help us each one in here to
[59:07] create our world
[59:08] and let that world be an atmosphere of
[59:10] the holy spirit
[59:12] for we know that by faith one of these
[59:14] days we're going to a world
[59:17] that is has nothing there but perfect
[59:19] love
[59:20] perfect faith
[59:22] and we'll fit right in and even as your
[59:23] prophet told us it'll take perfect love
[59:26] to put you in there whatever you do lay
[59:28] aside everything else until you get that
[59:30] atmosphere around you that atmosphere of
[59:33] perfect love that no matter what anybody
[59:35] does
[59:36] lord jesus what would we do father if we
[59:38] let everything that people do affect us
[59:40] and
[59:41] mold our character
[59:43] to a terrible person lord
[59:45] but father when we put it at the altar
[59:47] of the calvary lord and we say lord
[59:50] we don't want to do anything lord jesus
[59:53] that's un like you and that's not
[59:55] pleasing to you lord
[59:57] we ask god tonight that you'll bless
[59:59] every hand that is up
[1:00:01] every heart may we go from here a better
[1:00:03] people
[1:00:04] lord jesus to serve you tomorrow lord
[1:00:07] don't you let us be forgetful here's
[1:00:10] but lord help us tonight before we go to
[1:00:12] bed perhaps to read the bible to play
[1:00:15] the bible or brother branham a tape lord
[1:00:18] and just to constantly have our minds on
[1:00:21] you
[1:00:22] and not just to play it but to hear
[1:00:24] what's said father
[1:00:26] well lord we just thank you for what you
[1:00:28] have done for us in this hour you said
[1:00:30] that in the evening time it would be
[1:00:32] light
[1:00:34] and it lord you manifested it you
[1:00:37] brought it to us we are living in that
[1:00:38] light and we thank you father for it
[1:00:41] let that light shine in our hearts in
[1:00:43] jesus name
[1:00:44] amen and amen god bless you
