[33:06] Earl Gregory and we went to several
[33:08] their concerts but Priscilla Magruder
[33:10] got cancer
[33:12] and uh there's a song that she wrote

[33:24] with cancer
[33:26] that

[33:31] so her husband came by one morning and
[33:34] he said he's seen her standing
[33:36] and she was standing on top of the Bible
[33:40] he said I thought she had done lost her
[33:42] mind because of her medication that she
[33:44] was on

[36:50] raise everybody right back up again
[36:53] enjoy the weekend did you

[36:56] enjoyed that Amen Brother Bill being up
[36:58] here and ministering for us and getting
[37:00] to hear him again amen and so amen I
[37:05] can't think of any announcements or
[37:06] anything so let's just bow our heads
[37:08] Lord Jesus we come before you father
[37:10] tonight once again Lord being assembled
[37:12] together in your name we know that
[37:14] wherever two or three are gathered in
[37:16] your name there you are in our midst
[37:17] Lord and as we open the Bible tonight
[37:19] father and want to speak just on
[37:21] something we feel oh God that you've
[37:23] revealed to us Lord Jesus we ask God do
[37:26] you just give the inspiration and help
[37:28] us to say what you once said tonight
[37:29] benefit and edify the body of Christ
[37:31] Lord Lord meet all the needs you know
[37:34] what they are Lord and I know the
[37:35] different ones are not feeling the best
[37:37] amen Joshua's tonight he's not feeling
[37:40] too good from what understands we ask
[37:41] God do you bless him
[37:43] touch him Lord and Lord we just ask now
[37:46] father that you just help us bless the
[37:48] meeting together our gathering together
[37:49] the effort that everybody has made Lord
[37:51] Jesus to be here and those that get
[37:53] online Lord and listen we ask God that
[37:56] you'd blessed him also
[37:58] made ourselves to you yield ourselves so
[38:00] you use this for your purpose to God
[38:02] Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen I
[38:06] just had this uh low thought come to me
[38:09] and amen I guess you know I just try to
[38:12] follow the leading of the spirit amen
[38:14] and so I think I have at least a couple
[38:16] little things probably maybe that you've
[38:18] not heard before amen
[38:20] amen but most of it we probably have
[38:23] amen but this is just kind of different
[38:26] so if you will turn to Second
[38:27] Thessalonians
[38:29] second Thessalonians
[38:32] the second chapter
[38:36] and I was trying to think of what I was
[38:39] thinking about when I come to this
[38:41] scripture and and so forth but for some
[38:43] reason it was just a certain portion of
[38:45] this scripture that kind of stuck with
[38:48] me and and I began to build on amen and
[38:52] so uh amen but I trust it'll be a
[38:55] blessing to you tonight
[38:57] you know I may just say this I truly
[39:00] believe that we need revelation
[39:02] amen
[39:04] and I suppose you know I don't want to
[39:06] say just especially but especially uh
[39:09] preachers amen
[39:12] uh because
[39:13] I know the Eagles feed on Fresh
[39:16] Revelation isn't that right amen and
[39:19] something that's just fresh to you it
[39:20] doesn't matter what it is amen and we
[39:23] certainly appreciate it so this to me it
[39:25] was just a different different something
[39:27] different I felt like the Lord just give
[39:29] them to me in a different angle but
[39:31] um it just stemmed from the second
[39:33] chapter of second Thessalonians we'll
[39:37] begin with verse 1.
[39:39] that would beseech you Brethren by the
[39:41] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by
[39:43] our gather there unto him that you be
[39:46] not soon shaken in mind or be troubled
[39:49] neither by Spirit nor by letter
[39:51] nor by word nor by letter s from us as
[39:55] that the day of Christ is at hand let no
[39:58] man deceive you by any means for that
[40:00] they shall not come except there come a
[40:02] falling away first
[40:04] and that man of sin be revealed the Son
[40:07] of Perdition amen
[40:10] amen now can I just stop there a minute
[40:13] and and how many knows who the Son of
[40:16] Perdition was
[40:18] really when you think about it uh it was
[40:21] what God brought in in the way by
[40:25] serpency
[40:26] and that right which was Cain isn't that
[40:29] right
[40:30] he was the first son of perdition
[40:33] amen and he talked about him being
[40:34] revealed when did we ever have a message
[40:36] coming how the church has fought against
[40:38] what serpency right they just couldn't
[40:41] take that but that's not a Perdition is
[40:43] revealed who opposes and exalters
[40:46] himself above all that is called God or
[40:48] that is worship so that he asked God
[40:50] sitteth in the temple of God showing
[40:52] himself that he is God remember ye not
[40:55] that when I was yet with you I told you
[40:58] these things and now you know what
[41:00] withholdth that he might be revealed in
[41:03] his time for the mystery of iniquity it
[41:06] does already work only who who now
[41:09] letteth will let till he be taken of the
[41:12] out of the way and then shall that
[41:15] Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall
[41:17] consume with the spirit of his mouth and
[41:20] shall destroy with the brightness of his
[41:22] coming may God add this blessings to the
[41:24] reading of the word you can be seated
[41:28] amen perhaps uh perhaps it was this it
[41:31] just comes back to me now and I think
[41:33] that perhaps I was thinking about the
[41:35] age in which we were living in and the
[41:37] hour in which we're living in and the
[41:39] way that things are going and how wicked
[41:41] things are getting and how much it looks
[41:44] like certainly we can say that it just
[41:47] you know that the devil is in control
[41:51] amen and that the devil is running
[41:54] things
[41:57] that's it folks I mean the devil's run
[42:00] things
[42:01] yeah truly he is he's running things
[42:04] here on Earth
[42:05] you know and better man I mean when the
[42:08] message from the God of this evil age
[42:10] and he was just talking about how
[42:12] horrible things were and we find out
[42:14] that she is naked and lewd and nude and
[42:18] the world seems to be in the most evil
[42:20] age ever never in any age that women act
[42:24] the way they did it never but just
[42:26] before the destruction of the andaluvian
[42:28] world and Jesus referred to it he says
[42:32] and then he'll get to that after a while
[42:34] now he's talking about that and I get to
[42:36] thinking about how her brother Bannon
[42:38] perhaps talked about the women the way
[42:39] they were he talked about of course
[42:41] homosexuality and when we when I think
[42:44] about it and how that what they're doing
[42:46] and they're just messing everything up
[42:48] including our kids now isn't that right
[42:50] and how many knows that we we realized
[42:53] and I kind of looked for it years ago
[42:55] realized that whenever the Sodom and
[42:57] Gomorrah they pushed themselves over
[42:59] into lot righteous rot lot as the
[43:03] scripture says you know uh that it Rex
[43:06] his righteous soul and so forth you know
[43:08] that even they pushed themselves into
[43:09] that we find ourselves that that
[43:11] homosexual spirit and so forth is uh uh
[43:15] uh you know pushing themselves all the
[43:17] way into our children and I was amazed
[43:20] to see on the news somewhere and then
[43:22] where they're even teaching uh you know
[43:26] about sexual preferences to our kids
[43:28] since in public some public schools and
[43:30] there's liberal places
[43:32] including if you'll notice perversion or
[43:36] a
[43:36] sodomy if you understand uh you know and
[43:39] so forth that's what the teaching you I
[43:41] thought man I look at how terrible it is
[43:43] man I don't know about you but wouldn't
[43:45] you just jerk your kids out of there if
[43:47] you knew anything was like that being
[43:48] told her your kids come back but you
[43:50] know and you and you look at where it's
[43:52] going
[43:53] amen and then we look at that and then
[43:55] we see here uh you know that and I want
[43:59] to title this he who now let us will let
[44:02] amen he who now let us will let now
[44:05] notice but abandoned right after he says
[44:09] this and Jesus referred to it and we'll
[44:10] get to it after a while has God lost
[44:13] control
[44:18] well he perhaps says that because
[44:22] perhaps it looks like it
[44:24] right
[44:26] it looks like the devil has just got
[44:28] full control because we know that he's
[44:30] making a Satan's eating isn't that right
[44:33] but I noticed I want you to notice
[44:36] something here that you know when
[44:38] brother Branham explained this scripture
[44:40] in the second Thessalonians the uh
[44:43] the seventh chapter from what I
[44:45] understand only he who now led us will
[44:48] let until he be taken out of the way the
[44:51] way that I understand the prophets call
[44:53] explaining that until he he said he the
[44:57] Holy Ghost is taken out of the way is
[45:00] that right how many understands that if
[45:01] you don't understand but about method he
[45:03] says one day the holy spirit will be
[45:05] taken out of the way
[45:07] isn't that right and then the mystery
[45:10] now notice and then shall that Wicked be
[45:12] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[45:14] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[45:17] destroy with the brightness of his
[45:19] coming we know that God one day is going
[45:22] to pull the Holy Ghost there's going to
[45:23] be a Rapture take place isn't that right
[45:25] God's gonna pull these people out of
[45:27] here before he destroyed the Devil with
[45:31] the brightness of his coming
[45:35] amen
[45:45] all right so has God lost control
[45:49] now now I have another just one more
[45:52] line here that I really want to get to
[45:53] but let me go back and just kind of
[45:54] expound a little bit
[45:58] for we know that the mystery of iniquity
[46:00] certainly does already work right
[46:04] this thing is really working the spirit
[46:06] of iniquity is certainly working
[46:08] overtime
[46:10] is that right
[46:11] and I like this he says only
[46:15] he who now let
[46:17] I wish I'd wrote this all down I didn't
[46:20] take the time like I said
[46:22] amen because when you look at that
[46:26] it says there's somebody that's letting
[46:29] something happen right
[46:32] now when you let something happen right
[46:36] you're in control
[46:40] right
[46:41] in other words before somebody does
[46:44] something they got to have permission to
[46:46] do it
[46:48] or if they do it it's because you let
[46:51] them do it
[46:53] now I want to tell you tonight that
[46:55] who's who's the letter
[46:58] who lets
[47:03] God right he's the one that's truly in
[47:07] control
[47:08] has gotten lost control no he's in
[47:10] control
[47:11] but he's letting he's allowing
[47:15] right
[47:18] and I got to thinking about that he's
[47:20] letting it happen anything that's
[47:21] happening God's letting it happen
[47:25] right
[47:27] so it's it it it to me it displays power
[47:30] right
[47:32] it talks about having the greater power
[47:34] we know that God is the greater power
[47:36] not the devil
[47:39] amen
[47:42] oh my
[47:43] so we see here we see God in this
[47:46] scripture I mean those
[47:48] how brother bam said this just comes to
[47:50] me but bam says you know you got to find
[47:51] thought in scriptures Jesus Christ find
[47:54] him in every scripture
[47:55] and I see him in this one only he who
[47:58] now let us
[47:59] we'll let
[48:01] amen
[48:05] dude I get a little something out of
[48:07] that it's just for me
[48:09] the letter because without the letter
[48:12] ain't nobody gonna do nothing nothing
[48:14] gonna happen unless he lets it happen
[48:17] he would have never fallen if God
[48:19] wouldn't have let it have got the oh my
[48:22] God you all get too happy with me now
[48:26] nothing
[48:29] but what he loves
[48:33] amen
[48:35] but what he allows
[48:38] only what only he who let us will not
[48:40] let until
[48:41] [Applause]
[48:42] he be taken it out of the way let me put
[48:44] this down
[48:45] so now what happens when God takes him
[48:49] out of the way
[48:51] right
[48:53] let me see with that word I like this
[48:54] word here I want to just Revel in it a
[48:57] little bit
[48:58] okay only he who now letters will let
[49:02] until
[49:03] [Applause]
[49:06] to a certain point right
[49:09] to a certain place you live
[49:13] until he be taken out of the way
[49:16] [Music]
[49:18] and I just want to say then God will
[49:20] have his day
[49:24] isn't that right I mean that's when the
[49:26] day of the Lord will come
[49:28] cruel like a thief in the night
[49:33] amen
[49:37] we just can't fathom
[49:39] what God's going to do in that
[49:41] tribulation period
[49:42] the people that are left here on the
[49:44] Earth
[49:45] are in for our
[49:48] some real I mean we're not talking we're
[49:51] talking about yeah something on the
[49:53] scale of Noah cataclysmic Universal
[49:56] only it's going to be by fire this time
[49:58] there's going to be earthquakes involved
[50:00] there's going to be volcanoes coming
[50:01] forth erupting everywhere
[50:04] how many heard the story of yellow
[50:06] yellow stone is it
[50:08] and the volcano if that one ever erupted
[50:10] it would destroy almost the whole world
[50:12] if that one ever come up out of there
[50:14] and brother bam says man the volcanoes
[50:17] will rub the inside will go inside out
[50:19] and everything else oh
[50:21] burying people you wipe this thing clean
[50:24] folks he'll fold that thing he'll fold
[50:26] this thing up like you ain't never seen
[50:30] because he's going to come whenever he
[50:32] takes that out of the way he's going to
[50:33] destroy the Devil with the brightness of
[50:37] his coming amen
[50:39] because why he's up there and he's
[50:40] fixing to come he's fixing to come back
[50:42] and as he comes back he's going to
[50:44] destroy the world until so there's a
[50:46] point that which he's not going to let
[50:49] any more
[50:51] amen
[50:52] so back in 64 God of this evil age has
[50:56] God lost control or is he just
[51:00] permitting huh
[51:03] is he just permitting another agency to
[51:06] control
[51:09] huh
[51:10] so if the devil has any power now if
[51:13] he's can doing any controlling it's
[51:15] because that lets him do
[51:21] amen back to back to the battle
[51:26] uh that brother Brad preached on Matthew
[51:29] 5 there where the devil took him up on
[51:31] all the mountain and he showed him all
[51:32] the kingdoms and he had he would be all
[51:35] belong to him
[51:37] not only did all the kingdoms belong to
[51:40] him all of humanity belonged to him
[51:45] you're quiet on me now
[51:48] why
[51:49] and the devil it was a it was a power
[51:52] struggle is what it was
[51:54] it was a power struggle and just before
[51:57] he went and paid for it at Calvary to
[51:59] never tried to offer it to him isn't
[52:01] that right
[52:02] tried to make a deal he tried to have
[52:04] more power than God
[52:09] I don't want to say the devil's stupid
[52:11] but the devil's stupid
[52:15] not to think that he could challenge God
[52:19] and win come on man didn't you live with
[52:21] him up there for a while you got to know
[52:23] they ain't nobody ever gonna win against
[52:25] him but he had to try
[52:30] yeah
[52:32] but he had to try and he did
[52:35] it wasn't but a few years maybe a year
[52:38] and a half I don't know just how long or
[52:40] later when Jesus went to Calvary folks
[52:43] huh when he went to Calvary and when he
[52:47] shed his blood and when he spilled his
[52:50] blood upon the Earth how many knows that
[52:52] he paid for it he bought it up
[52:59] now before then
[53:01] the devil had permission that the devil
[53:04] had what we call a right
[53:06] to everybody
[53:09] we were in what the devil's pawn shop
[53:12] weren't we he had control of us I'll
[53:15] tell you what no matter how much our
[53:16] holy David was no I'm not a righteous
[53:19] David wasn't how much like a man of God
[53:21] the devil still had rights
[53:25] huh
[53:26] and that's why that most of those people
[53:28] never were complete Overcomers because
[53:30] they had the devil had rights yet
[53:34] same way with Samson Moses a temper and
[53:36] everything else kept him out of the
[53:38] Promised Land
[53:40] the devil had rights
[53:43] not just permission but he had a right
[53:45] to be there
[53:49] amen
[53:50] he had everybody get rights to be there
[53:54] it was his it belonged to his because it
[53:57] was forfeited
[53:58] Adam forfeited it
[54:01] and the devil had control of it
[54:03] until Calvary
[54:07] now many knows when Calvary happened
[54:09] when he shied his blood it was momentous
[54:15] it was a Monumental thing because God
[54:18] the power question of power was over
[54:21] then
[54:26] all right the power question was over
[54:31] amen
[54:41] he paid the price
[54:44] and then Ephesians Paul says the eyes of
[54:47] your understanding being enlightened
[54:49] that ye may know what is the hope of his
[54:51] calling and what the riches of the glory
[54:52] of his inheritance in the Saints what is
[54:55] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[54:57] us word to believe according to the
[54:59] working of his mighty power
[55:01] which he wrote In Christ when he raised
[55:04] him from the dead it set him at his own
[55:06] right hand in Heavenly places
[55:09] far above all principality and power and
[55:15] might and dominion and every name that
[55:18] is named
[55:20] foreign
[55:21] not only in this world but I in that
[55:24] within the world that is to come and
[55:26] that's put all things under his feet and
[55:29] gave him to be the head over all things
[55:31] to the church which is his body the
[55:33] fullness of him that filleth all in all
[55:38] so we see now that after Calvary he
[55:41] ascended and he is above every
[55:43] principality
[55:46] every Power every night every Dominion
[55:52] he's above it all
[55:56] he has the right to do whatever whenever
[55:58] however he wants to
[56:00] how many he believes that
[56:02] he has a right now God bought it back he
[56:05] purchased it
[56:07] amen and he give us an inheritance in
[56:10] him
[56:11] and we are his body isn't that right
[56:15] now I notice how it says that we are his
[56:17] body and God has put all these things
[56:20] under his feet
[56:24] so if you're in the body of Christ every
[56:27] devil every Dominion every principality
[56:30] every sickness every devil is under your
[56:33] feet
[56:34] you're above all of it
[56:40] one time you couldn't do that you had to
[56:42] be sad you had to be sorrowful you
[56:45] couldn't overcome sin you had to sin
[56:47] again
[56:49] you had to be sad again you had no
[56:51] Victory there ain't no way for you to
[56:53] ever maintain victory
[56:57] uh
[56:58] sometimes we don't appreciate
[57:01] the joy and the peace
[57:04] the Forgiveness the grace the love that
[57:06] we have
[57:07] it's the greatest thing that we possess
[57:10] is these things
[57:12] amen
[57:14] and sometimes we take him for granted
[57:17] isn't that right
[57:19] now notice I like this this is what
[57:22] comes to me when I got to thinking about
[57:24] he who led it oh I like to get in the
[57:29] paws my mind
[57:31] when he got this inspiration to say that
[57:33] only he who now let us will let
[57:36] I like that it may be so simple it may
[57:39] be twisted English I don't know but I
[57:41] like it only he who now let us will let
[57:45] he's gonna let him have dominion he's
[57:47] gonna let him iniquity abound he's going
[57:49] to do holiday he think until a certain
[57:51] time
[57:52] amen
[57:54] so I like that this is all let me just
[57:57] say this all of what's happening today
[57:59] is happening by permission
[58:04] by permission
[58:07] because God could come and claim
[58:10] what he has purchased at any time
[58:13] is that right
[58:15] he could come and change it he could say
[58:17] time shall be no more
[58:19] he could say all right I've had enough
[58:22] he could say it is done
[58:25] it is finished anytime
[58:28] but he knows when he's going to say that
[58:30] what time he's going to say that but who
[58:32] knows he's going to say it's done he's
[58:34] gonna say time is no more
[58:36] huh he's gonna say that's it I'm not
[58:40] permitting it anymore
[58:43] I don't know about you but I can go and
[58:44] not say we had a great service because
[58:46] we found out that God is in control
[58:51] huh
[58:52] anything that's happening to only happen
[58:54] by permission
[58:56] they got to have a permit
[58:59] God has to give him a permit
[59:02] before he does anything poor devil can't
[59:04] do anything with answer
[59:08] all right I mean that goes for you that
[59:11] goes for me
[59:14] I'm not the prophet taught is that with
[59:16] job the devil that could not touch Joe
[59:19] God had an edge around it and so much
[59:21] more you and I God's believers
[59:25] we've got to hedge around us and nothing
[59:27] can happen to us according to the Bible
[59:29] according to the prophet of God the
[59:31] devil's got to have permission before he
[59:33] does anything
[59:35] and me as a human being I'm sure you as
[59:37] a human being we don't say God sent me
[59:39] God we say no Lord thank you for the
[59:41] Hedge keep the heads there
[59:45] huh beeping out don't open the gate
[59:48] don't let him in
[59:52] huh
[59:54] and God knows how to do it is what he's
[59:57] doing
[59:59] it's quite unique let me say this it's
[1:00:02] quite unique because the most of the
[1:00:04] world don't believe it
[1:00:07] that anything that happens to you as a
[1:00:09] Christian God has to permit it first if
[1:00:13] it happens to you it happens for a
[1:00:15] reason
[1:00:16] God is allowing it I like to know that
[1:00:19] don't you they don't know what in the
[1:00:21] world is going on
[1:00:24] wow all these things happening to me
[1:00:28] to get chaos because they don't have a
[1:00:31] God Like United
[1:00:34] you can have confidence tonight that to
[1:00:36] know that nothing can happen to you
[1:00:38] without permission
[1:00:40] God can't touch you without permission
[1:00:42] and God does allow a thing about the
[1:00:43] debt but God does give the devil
[1:00:45] permission to touch you
[1:00:48] even one place how many times you better
[1:00:50] bam say the devil's got a Punch coming
[1:00:53] he's got one punch coming it may be this
[1:00:55] and it may be that and it may be the
[1:00:56] other
[1:00:57] huh
[1:00:59] we're gonna cover that tonight
[1:01:02] all right
[1:01:04] praise the Lord
[1:01:06] Revelation series brother bam says now
[1:01:08] notice oh this does me so good I get to
[1:01:11] really feeding oh let's let our hearts
[1:01:13] just loose a few minutes
[1:01:15] Satan is a squatter
[1:01:23] he don't legally own this
[1:01:28] oh my
[1:01:32] when Christ came as a Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:01:34] and redeemed it back to us but Satan
[1:01:37] possesses or he has a right or or he has
[1:01:40] a he's a squatter he says but you know
[1:01:42] after this fight's all over he's cast
[1:01:45] into the Lake of Fire and so forth he'll
[1:01:47] be done away with and all them that
[1:01:49] worship with him but The Heirs of
[1:01:51] Salvation will come with Christ but now
[1:01:54] he's a squatter
[1:01:59] amen how many knows that if somebody
[1:02:01] comes into your house they're called
[1:02:03] squatters
[1:02:05] they have no legal right to be there
[1:02:08] and you can kick it off if you want to
[1:02:13] praise be to God but Abraham says
[1:02:16] remember in the Old Testament a man lost
[1:02:18] his inheritance in this quarter coming
[1:02:20] on his land and he could hold it he
[1:02:22] could hold it any longer for
[1:02:24] annihilation from the owner until 50
[1:02:27] years now after 50 years the Jubilee
[1:02:29] came by that Do You Believe come along
[1:02:31] and then everything went back to the
[1:02:33] original again all slaves if he got into
[1:02:37] slavery no matter how much bad you were
[1:02:39] then your whole family becomes late when
[1:02:41] that do believe sounded you had a parcel
[1:02:43] of land that was yours
[1:02:45] and you might lose it none of us get a
[1:02:48] ride to it but after 50 years it goes
[1:02:50] right back to the original owner
[1:02:53] which means what that means no matter
[1:02:55] how much of his baby I become that land
[1:02:57] still belongs to you
[1:03:00] that's where it was with the Old
[1:03:01] Testament I'll tell you what that no
[1:03:03] matter what it was old big name the
[1:03:05] devil was squatting on Humanity but when
[1:03:08] that Jubilee sounded we had a right to
[1:03:10] go back and possess our land and our
[1:03:13] land is to be back with God the way that
[1:03:16] Adam was right with God that's why you
[1:03:18] can ask and it would be given unto him
[1:03:22] praise God
[1:03:25] oh my
[1:03:26] anybody that got on that in that 50-year
[1:03:29] span
[1:03:30] they were just squatters
[1:03:33] let me tell you something that's what
[1:03:34] the devil is right now
[1:03:36] because Jesus has done sound of Jubilee
[1:03:38] is that right
[1:03:42] we have something that you believe in
[1:03:43] everybody that hears that Jubilee
[1:03:46] that Jubilee sound you can go back and
[1:03:49] possess that land
[1:03:53] amen how many knows I land is eternal
[1:03:56] life
[1:03:57] the holy ghost that Adam lost
[1:04:00] amen
[1:04:02] how many knows now this Bliss land here
[1:04:04] this ground here belongs to God
[1:04:07] huh it belongs to God and the devil has
[1:04:11] no legal right to jump on your property
[1:04:14] amen and if he does something happens
[1:04:17] because a lot of times the sickness will
[1:04:18] jump on you this will jump on you
[1:04:20] that'll jump on you
[1:04:22] huh what do we do kick him out cast out
[1:04:25] the devil
[1:04:26] amen no no legal writing anymore
[1:04:29] praise the Lord he's just a squatter
[1:04:33] praise be to God
[1:04:36] oh my
[1:04:39] when he was on earth when Christ was on
[1:04:41] Earth he conquered every gate the enemy
[1:04:43] had is that right
[1:04:46] well whatever it was he conquered the
[1:04:48] gates of sickness he conquered the gates
[1:04:50] of death whatever whatever and he said
[1:04:52] whatever you ask on Earth but it will be
[1:04:54] bound on Earth and I'll be healed mine
[1:04:56] in heaven you give us the key to the
[1:04:58] gate he conquered the Gate of Temptation
[1:05:01] by the words and the key was resist the
[1:05:04] enemy and he'll flee from you
[1:05:06] he conquered it all every sickness death
[1:05:09] hell the great he conquered death and
[1:05:12] Hell
[1:05:13] Oh my he conquered what the others
[1:05:15] couldn't conquer because they're The
[1:05:17] Original Seed this is the spiritual seed
[1:05:19] he conquered the gates of the grave
[1:05:22] and Rose up on the third day for our
[1:05:24] justification and now we are more than
[1:05:26] conquerors
[1:05:27] oh and we just walked right into our
[1:05:30] inheritance more than conquerors now he
[1:05:33] says we are this is what the quote I was
[1:05:35] looking for we are dealing with a
[1:05:38] defeated enemy
[1:05:43] sickness is defeated death is defeated
[1:05:46] hell is defeated everything is defeated
[1:05:51] Glory
[1:05:53] I mean those probably got many times
[1:05:56] said whenever Jesus died on Calvary he
[1:05:58] stripped the devil up every rights that
[1:06:00] he had he ain't got no legal rights
[1:06:03] anymore at all
[1:06:05] oh he stripped him he robbed him about
[1:06:08] everything he had any power he had any
[1:06:10] rights that he had he stripped him of it
[1:06:13] and gave it to you
[1:06:16] huh
[1:06:18] praise be to God
[1:06:21] now
[1:06:23] praise be to God let no wonder
[1:06:26] Paul could say all things are yours
[1:06:30] remember that scripture we said all
[1:06:32] things whether it's life whether it's
[1:06:34] dance whether it's things present
[1:06:36] whether it's Paul no matter what it is
[1:06:38] whether it's things that come on oh
[1:06:40] thing to yours Paul said he got such a
[1:06:42] revelation that it's out that he said
[1:06:44] everything's ours
[1:06:47] [Laughter]
[1:06:51] do you see how it ought to give us just
[1:06:53] a little more joy than that realize
[1:06:55] everything is yours
[1:06:58] you ain't got to be afraid of cancer you
[1:07:00] ain't got to be afraid of death
[1:07:03] you ain't got to be afraid to die you
[1:07:05] ain't got to be afraid of any fear or
[1:07:07] not you ain't got to be scared of
[1:07:08] anything
[1:07:09] you're dealing with a defeated enemies
[1:07:13] we're disputing he says we are disputing
[1:07:17] with a conquered enemy
[1:07:21] oh my I like that no wonder Paul could
[1:07:24] say when David was building The Chopping
[1:07:25] Block to chop his head off he says oh
[1:07:28] death where is your sting
[1:07:31] oh my show me where you can make me
[1:07:34] squirm and scream grave where is your
[1:07:37] victory
[1:07:39] oh you think you'll mold me out there
[1:07:41] I'll point you to an empty tomb over
[1:07:44] there and I'm in him and he'll raise me
[1:07:47] up at the last
[1:07:50] Paul didn't scream that didn't make Paul
[1:07:54] squirm and scream he says I'm more than
[1:07:55] willing to go
[1:07:56] let him let Ray Ray
[1:08:00] and let it slide down there and let my
[1:08:02] head fall into the bucket he didn't mind
[1:08:06] because God does permit things like that
[1:08:09] to happen
[1:08:10] God permits his Saints to be killed
[1:08:13] and I got to thinking about that when I
[1:08:15] was meditating on this well what about
[1:08:17] that look at what God permitted down
[1:08:19] through the Dark Ages
[1:08:21] be thou faithful unto death
[1:08:23] even Jesus said don't be afraid of those
[1:08:25] that can destroy your body
[1:08:27] don't fear them huh because how many of
[1:08:30] those Satan can only do so much right
[1:08:33] one of the worst things he's going to
[1:08:35] ever do to us
[1:08:37] is
[1:08:38] take control of your money
[1:08:40] you ain't buying and selling unless you
[1:08:43] belong me
[1:08:44] that's all the power he got if we're not
[1:08:48] huh
[1:08:50] Jesus had enough to give us joy and
[1:08:52] happiness forgive us amen he's going to
[1:08:54] raise us from the dead he's going to
[1:08:55] give us immortality give us power over
[1:08:58] all of that all the only Power the devil
[1:09:00] have is these natural means and so forth
[1:09:03] huh
[1:09:04] to try to persuade people to go his way
[1:09:06] deception lusts and all that other stuff
[1:09:09] amen
[1:09:11] all right
[1:09:13] praise the Lord
[1:09:17] Hallelujah a defeated enemy brother
[1:09:20] Brown said why
[1:09:23] he's operating under permission God
[1:09:26] could take this thing rightfully anytime
[1:09:31] that he chose to
[1:09:33] amen
[1:09:38] I know we could go in a Nebuchadnezzar
[1:09:41] and all the kingdoms could go
[1:09:44] hurt especially remember
[1:09:46] Herod told Jesus he says the power to
[1:09:49] kill you or to free you
[1:09:52] what was Jesus reply
[1:09:55] you would have no power
[1:09:57] unless my daddy my father give it to you
[1:09:59] this father that's in me unless he had
[1:10:01] given it to you you wouldn't even be
[1:10:03] where you are
[1:10:07] now here we come to the part that I
[1:10:10] trust you probably never heard before
[1:10:11] because I didn't
[1:10:13] I'm going to read just a little bit
[1:10:14] first I want to read let's talk to
[1:10:16] Matthew if you will
[1:10:18] I want to give you a 40-minute sermon
[1:10:20] tonight but I think it's going to be a
[1:10:22] little longer
[1:10:34] before we go into this let me just cover
[1:10:36] something else
[1:10:37] another place remember Herod you have no
[1:10:41] pollen levels given and Jesus says
[1:10:43] one place he says that they don't take
[1:10:45] my life written that right he says I lay
[1:10:48] it down
[1:10:49] whatever they did he permitted them to
[1:10:52] do it
[1:10:54] he allowed them to do it
[1:10:57] yeah they didn't they didn't take him by
[1:11:00] force
[1:11:01] they took him by permission
[1:11:07] tell me something when they came at
[1:11:09] Jesus the first time
[1:11:11] from what I understand they were all
[1:11:13] thrown back
[1:11:15] there was such a power they were thrown
[1:11:16] back from what understand is that right
[1:11:19] they were thrown back even though they
[1:11:21] were thrown back I don't know what power
[1:11:23] that was maybe a bunch of angels but
[1:11:25] they were thrown back
[1:11:27] and then
[1:11:29] a second then they came back at him and
[1:11:31] of course they took him and led him away
[1:11:36] but you know no he he
[1:11:38] willfully laid down his life
[1:11:42] here we find in Matthew 14 22 and
[1:11:47] straight away Jesus constrained his
[1:11:48] disciples again to his ship and to go
[1:11:50] before him on to the other side and
[1:11:52] while they sent
[1:11:53] poorly sent the multitudes away and when
[1:11:56] he had sent the multitudes away he went
[1:11:58] up into a mountain apart to pray and
[1:12:00] when the evening was come
[1:12:01] he was there alone
[1:12:03] but the ship was not in the midst of the
[1:12:05] sea tossed with ways for the wind was
[1:12:07] contrary and much of the night Jesus
[1:12:10] went unto them walking on the sea and
[1:12:12] when his disciples
[1:12:13] saw him on the sea they were troubled
[1:12:15] saying it is a spirit in the creek I
[1:12:17] cried out for fear I believe in John
[1:12:20] it talks about how that he would have he
[1:12:22] walked by he made like he was going to
[1:12:24] walk by him
[1:12:26] but straight with Jesus fake unto them
[1:12:28] saying be of good cheer it is I be not
[1:12:31] afraid
[1:12:32] didn't but a man preach my message
[1:12:34] called it is I be not afraid
[1:12:37] when he did something and he talked
[1:12:39] about what he what he did when Jesus
[1:12:40] made himself known and did Miracles like
[1:12:42] that and even brother bam says in this
[1:12:45] generation all the phds and all those
[1:12:47] thought man it's a spirited celebrity
[1:12:49] it's a devil or it scared him
[1:12:52] and brother Banner preached your message
[1:12:53] don't be afraid
[1:12:55] it is Jesus
[1:12:57] it's here to help you
[1:12:59] and Peter answered and said on him Lord
[1:13:01] if it be thou bid me coming to thee on
[1:13:04] the water and he said come and when
[1:13:06] Peter was come down out of the ship he
[1:13:08] walked on the water to go to Jesus but
[1:13:11] what he saw the wind was boisterous and
[1:13:13] he was afraid and Begins the beginning
[1:13:15] of sink he cried saying Lord save me and
[1:13:18] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[1:13:20] hand and caught him and said unto him oh
[1:13:22] thou little faith wherefore did down now
[1:13:25] amen Jesus got right to the point didn't
[1:13:28] he
[1:13:29] and when they were coming to the ship I
[1:13:32] noticed not until but when they were
[1:13:34] come into the ship the wind ceased
[1:13:38] and they that were in the ship came in
[1:13:40] worshiped saying of a truth Thou Art the
[1:13:43] son of God
[1:13:45] brother Ben I'm talking about this says
[1:13:47] it this way one night after preaching a
[1:13:49] long time he sent his disciples away and
[1:13:51] he they got into a ship and went out
[1:13:53] there without him
[1:13:54] oh my and when did he when he did
[1:13:57] then he then he's out into the sea that
[1:14:00] little ship was and the little Storm
[1:14:01] come up and the devil said I've got them
[1:14:03] away from me now I've got these holy
[1:14:06] rollers away from their masses I'll see
[1:14:08] how much message they're going to take
[1:14:10] the whole world I'll drown under one of
[1:14:12] them out there
[1:14:14] so there come up a great storm the devil
[1:14:16] begin to snort his breath and the storm
[1:14:18] came up and the little ship began to
[1:14:20] bounce up and down like this the sails
[1:14:22] broke the horse dropped the ship filled
[1:14:24] with water and it was the darkest time
[1:14:27] no doubt they were holding one another
[1:14:28] around the waist and crying they thought
[1:14:30] oh where has he gone
[1:14:33] what has happened to him why didn't we
[1:14:35] wait to take him with us why didn't we
[1:14:37] want uh what didn't he we have him in
[1:14:41] the boat and many times you think the
[1:14:43] same thing my friend
[1:14:45] you have out went out they're off
[1:14:47] without him but remember he's still
[1:14:49] watching you he knows right where you
[1:14:52] are
[1:14:53] oh man he says here I'm in me trouble it
[1:14:56] may be trouble in your home it may be
[1:14:58] trouble in your soul there may be
[1:15:00] trouble in your body whatever it is
[1:15:02] don't you worry he's got his eyes on you
[1:15:07] amen he's watching you
[1:15:11] he climbed up on top of a mountain the
[1:15:13] Bible says remember he went up on the
[1:15:15] mountain he was looking out there and he
[1:15:17] seen every trick that the devil was
[1:15:19] playing Hallelujah
[1:15:21] he not only climbed but he climbed the
[1:15:24] ramparts of Glory not only to Calvary
[1:15:26] but the ramp parts of glory and he sets
[1:15:29] night at his majesty he looks down on
[1:15:31] Earth
[1:15:33] here's the part I don't think he ever
[1:15:35] heard before but this is what I want to
[1:15:37] make my point that is not even a ripple
[1:15:40] can come on the water without his
[1:15:43] permission
[1:15:45] the sea can't move a leaf can't move a
[1:15:48] bird can't fly
[1:15:50] without his permission now I added that
[1:15:53] permission last time but that's what he
[1:15:54] was talking about
[1:15:56] not even a ripple on the ocean
[1:15:59] not a leaf fall from a tree not a bird
[1:16:04] fighting not the engine Supreme control
[1:16:09] how many square for that
[1:16:13] that's right be Not Afraid oh blessed be
[1:16:16] the name of the Lord he's above all
[1:16:18] principalities and Powers
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:23] oh you might think well we ought to just
[1:16:25] take control
[1:16:27] we've got to be over this we over that
[1:16:29] remember God's just allowing the Devil
[1:16:32] to do these things
[1:16:34] but he'll stop him one day
[1:16:37] oh my the Earth may hit the lowest thing
[1:16:39] that could be brought God gave him the
[1:16:41] highest name that could be given the
[1:16:43] Earth put him in as low as they could
[1:16:44] get him into Sinner's grave but God
[1:16:46] raised him into the highest why he's so
[1:16:48] high then he has to look down to see
[1:16:51] heaven
[1:16:52] Hallelujah His Eye Is on the Sparrow and
[1:16:57] I know he want to with me
[1:17:01] aren't you glad tonight
[1:17:03] God's watching you wherever you go hey
[1:17:05] man he's making sure that no courage and
[1:17:08] no wreck amen you get over to the car
[1:17:10] because you're texting or something amen
[1:17:12] and if that wheel drops off into that
[1:17:14] big ditch it's gonna suck you right into
[1:17:16] it hey man it could throw you right into
[1:17:17] that tree you're gonna die and you come
[1:17:19] with an inch just be checking back
[1:17:22] you know what I'm talking about
[1:17:26] yeah some of those places you almost run
[1:17:28] off probably die
[1:17:31] but he watches you
[1:17:33] he's watching you
[1:17:36] Hallelujah aren't you glad
[1:17:39] he's to travel the ramparts of glory and
[1:17:42] he's got his eye on you
[1:17:44] the devil can't take you nothing can
[1:17:45] happen to you
[1:17:47] until God is done with you
[1:17:49] praise be to God his eyes on the sparrow
[1:17:52] he knows everything that's gonna oh yeah
[1:17:55] God's in control
[1:17:57] sure the devil he may be doing what he
[1:17:59] does but he's only doing it by
[1:18:01] permission
[1:18:02] that makes me happy how many know when I
[1:18:05] see these blessings and these promises
[1:18:07] in the Bible I can see what brother bam
[1:18:08] says we ought to be the people in the
[1:18:10] world
[1:18:11] we ought to be the happiest people in
[1:18:13] the world to have a god like we have the
[1:18:15] promises we haven't possess what you
[1:18:17] possess
[1:18:20] amen
[1:18:25] I'll say what comes to mind
[1:18:29] every Earthly possession you'll probably
[1:18:31] no doubt lose one day all of our
[1:18:34] possessions and the things that we get
[1:18:36] at church from God
[1:18:38] it's the only thing that we'll have
[1:18:41] at the very end so let's make sure we
[1:18:43] enjoy church we enjoy the things of God

[1:21:14] huh can you imagine how many knows Jesus
[1:21:17] knew all about that he was watching him
[1:21:19] he's seen the Storm come
[1:21:22] he knows they were about to sink
[1:21:25] and did he show up he showed up
[1:21:30] oh my just a thought that comes God
[1:21:33] won't send you somewhere where it won't
[1:21:35] take care of you isn't that right and
[1:21:37] Jesus sent him go on across the devil
[1:21:40] tried to sink and before they got the
[1:21:41] cross but I told them go across
[1:21:44] oh my brother man says he went without
[1:21:47] him he got out of his presence and they
[1:21:49] begin to sink Jesus come back on to see
[1:21:53] him because there he was
[1:21:56] foreign
[1:21:58] and when he finally got back on the boat
[1:22:01] the winds calmed down
[1:22:04] how many knows that's the way it is
[1:22:05] sometimes when you get away from God
[1:22:07] from God Amen these storms happen they
[1:22:10] all happen for a reason
[1:22:12] but he's always there in The Darkest
[1:22:14] Hour
[1:22:17] amen
[1:22:18] listen to what brother bam says
[1:22:21] maybe that's what he's doing to you
[1:22:23] tonight he got out of his presence he
[1:22:25] might give you a cancer
[1:22:28] foreign
[1:22:29] the devil to give you a cancer right
[1:22:32] give you this he might give you that he
[1:22:34] might give you a
[1:22:35] he might give you a tore up car he might
[1:22:37] give you worry she might give you a
[1:22:39] headache he will do but there's one
[1:22:41] thing I do know that God still got his
[1:22:44] eye on you he wants to see what you'll
[1:22:47] do he wants to test you
[1:22:49] he goes on to talk to him he's laying
[1:22:51] around the other one he talks about our
[1:22:52] troubles and our trials is what shackles
[1:22:55] away breaks the shackles of the world a
[1:22:57] lot of time a lot of times those trees
[1:22:59] sing shackles of the spirit get us gets
[1:23:02] us free from all the Warmness
[1:23:06] because of the easy and everything nice
[1:23:08] that don't hardly ever do anything for
[1:23:11] us
[1:23:14] make you lazy
[1:23:16] oh my
[1:23:18] same way with the disciples remember
[1:23:21] another time he was even in the boat
[1:23:24] you're right
[1:23:25] but he was asleep
[1:23:28] Jesus was asleep he was in his
[1:23:30] subconscious he was out of it so to
[1:23:32] speak right and the devil coming he
[1:23:34] blowed his breath and the man they were
[1:23:36] sinking isn't that right throwing stuff
[1:23:38] off and then they were they were fat in
[1:23:40] fact hey
[1:23:46] Jesus it's time to wake up put in
[1:23:49] trouble out here
[1:23:50] we know you made the water in the wine
[1:23:53] you you made fishes and Loaves and all
[1:23:56] these Miracles you done you can take
[1:23:58] care of it they should just don't fret
[1:24:00] this wake him up
[1:24:03] how about that in our triple in our
[1:24:04] world still Fred just wake him up
[1:24:07] call him on the scene
[1:24:10] commit him to the case
[1:24:13] oh my one thing's sure he's got his eye
[1:24:16] on you this may be your darkest hour I
[1:24:18] don't know God does but just in that
[1:24:21] Darkest Hour when they were just about
[1:24:23] ready to go down then Jesus come walking
[1:24:25] on the waters
[1:24:27] amen just all undisturbed the big waves
[1:24:30] just flattened out there in front of him
[1:24:31] as he walked along Peter said Lord if
[1:24:33] that be me you bid me come to you he
[1:24:36] says come on walk out here ask and you
[1:24:38] shall receive see can you shall find
[1:24:40] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[1:24:43] amen praise the Lord
[1:24:49] even they can they can do go on without
[1:24:52] permission amen the Devil Couldn't sink
[1:24:54] them without permission now couldn't he
[1:24:56] amen
[1:24:58] I like that
[1:25:00] they couldn't do it without without
[1:25:02] God's permission can't do anything
[1:25:05] without God's permission
[1:25:07] praise the Lord
[1:25:10] I don't know about you but I'm
[1:25:13] I'm expecting the Lord
[1:25:15] to come and bring the stuff that is one
[1:25:17] of these days
[1:25:20] we already know what the scripture says
[1:25:22] about
[1:25:23] Daniel remember Nebuchadnezzar the dream
[1:25:26] that he had the head of gold all the way
[1:25:28] down to the iron and the clay Christian
[1:25:29] from Gorbachev and the two kingdoms and
[1:25:31] fighting each other all the way utility
[1:25:33] and until the stone was cut out of the
[1:25:36] mountain it comes in crushes the world
[1:25:40] amen one more lesson one more thought
[1:25:42] here
[1:25:43] sometimes God opens the gate sometimes
[1:25:47] God takes that hedge away from the
[1:25:50] Stoney
[1:25:54] things happen to us we don't understand
[1:25:57] we always want to be on top of the world
[1:26:01] listen to this this will be a lesson for
[1:26:03] us like Paul said he had an infirmity
[1:26:08] something was bothering him the devil
[1:26:10] would Buffet him
[1:26:12] huh remember that the devil would just
[1:26:14] buff it Paul blow after blow and he
[1:26:18] consulted the Lord three times to take
[1:26:20] that thing away he said I don't want
[1:26:22] this Lord take it from me
[1:26:25] now I may know that whenever you're in
[1:26:27] the Lord's care and you're a child of
[1:26:29] God whatever comes to you the best thing
[1:26:30] to do is to commit it to the Lord trust
[1:26:32] the Lord in it
[1:26:33] believe the Lord Jesus Christ and go on
[1:26:36] what some people do is that well I don't
[1:26:38] understand why he hasn't healed me I
[1:26:39] don't understand why this is on me and I
[1:26:41] have to complain
[1:26:43] don't worry about it
[1:26:46] you don't know what it is if God's done
[1:26:48] it and you know it's his doing there's
[1:26:50] for a reason it's for a purpose
[1:26:53] Paul he didn't want that thing
[1:26:57] amen take it away from him then one
[1:27:00] night the Lord spoke to him said Saul or
[1:27:02] Paul my grace is sufficient for you
[1:27:05] he says well then I'll glory and my
[1:27:07] infirmities let me remember how many
[1:27:09] times Paul says I'm gonna brag I'm
[1:27:12] bragging about my many infirmities
[1:27:15] all right
[1:27:17] all right I'm not going to glory in how
[1:27:18] big a church I have and how big of
[1:27:20] preaching how many Souls I've said I'm
[1:27:22] just going to glory in my infirmities
[1:27:24] I've been Shipwrecked I've been Beat to
[1:27:27] Death I've been left for death three
[1:27:29] times with life
[1:27:30] he's twice without giving stripes and so
[1:27:33] forth and stone and everything else and
[1:27:36] praise be to God
[1:27:39] don't you realize that whenever Jesus
[1:27:41] talked to Paul first I'm going to show
[1:27:43] you the things that you're going to
[1:27:44] suffer from my kingdom and my when the
[1:27:47] first things God promising me to go do
[1:27:48] some suffering
[1:27:50] I'd like to have a Ministry god promise
[1:27:52] you I'm going to let you suffer a little
[1:27:53] here
[1:27:55] I'll glory in it I know you're a Healer
[1:27:58] I've seen you heal the sick raise it at
[1:28:00] cast out Devils Open the Eyes of the
[1:28:02] blind
[1:28:03] but if I've consulted to you and you
[1:28:05] tell me it's your grace is sufficient
[1:28:07] then this devil that bothers me is
[1:28:10] Growing Pains of your grace
[1:28:13] whoa then our glory and my infirmities
[1:28:16] why if these I be exalted above the
[1:28:19] abundance of the revelations
[1:28:22] man I'll get lifted up too high with
[1:28:24] these Revelations I'll just get up too
[1:28:26] high
[1:28:28] come on folks we sometimes don't think
[1:28:31] we can get up too hot yeah you can get
[1:28:33] up so high until you think you're
[1:28:34] invincible and you're all this and
[1:28:36] you're all that
[1:28:37] God has to knock you down realize no
[1:28:39] you're not all this and you're not all
[1:28:41] that
[1:28:44] he had something the other disciples did
[1:28:46] not have have he saw them after the
[1:28:49] death burial and resurrection and
[1:28:51] Ascension
[1:28:53] amen now on down he saw him back in the
[1:28:56] pillar of fire form see Paul did he was
[1:29:00] very special he had and Paul said except
[1:29:03] I be exalted and want to build me some
[1:29:05] great seminaries or something else and
[1:29:07] great big something or another at least
[1:29:09] I'd be exalted about the abundance above
[1:29:12] revelation God let a guy God let a
[1:29:16] messenger of the Devil Keep Me beat down
[1:29:23] whoa
[1:29:25] I don't like to hear that
[1:29:31] um
[1:29:33] can I just say something
[1:29:35] maybe maybe that's why God don't give us
[1:29:37] some of us millions of dollars
[1:29:40] huh
[1:29:41] maybe some of us just need to be happy
[1:29:44] with who our God give us
[1:29:46] he's just no matter how hard some people
[1:29:48] try to get rich they just can't get rich
[1:29:51] why don't you just be happy you know
[1:29:53] because brother bam says there's as many
[1:29:54] Penny errors as there's millionaires
[1:29:58] what was it Paul and Susie one time his
[1:30:00] brother told me he says you know they
[1:30:01] knew that certain guy that he'd stumble
[1:30:03] over the dollars to get to pennies
[1:30:07] listen how much money he liked money so
[1:30:09] well he'd tumble over the dollars to get
[1:30:11] the pennies
[1:30:12] anyway
[1:30:13] I'll let you interpret that
[1:30:15] yeah
[1:30:17] what is it Paul here he says you know
[1:30:19] God knows to keep it how to keep us down
[1:30:22] he says Paul says for and what did the
[1:30:24] Holy Ghost say he says for when you are
[1:30:26] weak
[1:30:27] then am I strong
[1:30:30] amen
[1:30:40] there was a point that I wanted to make
[1:30:47] now we'll make it here keep me beat down
[1:30:50] he said I'm weak I'm strong strong Amen
[1:30:53] brother bass says Growing Pains of Grace
[1:30:57] what does it make what do trials do it
[1:30:59] makes us reliant on him
[1:31:04] relying
[1:31:06] we could stay that on a long time he
[1:31:08] says you know and so forth Oh my he may
[1:31:10] permit Crossroads he may permit
[1:31:12] Crossroads to try us to perfect us to
[1:31:16] his service amen he may permit that now
[1:31:19] church both here and on to take world he
[1:31:21] may permit the crossed roads for our
[1:31:24] service like he did Daniel that little
[1:31:27] Crossroad one time he says you know he
[1:31:29] was on
[1:31:30] and he let the king turn against him and
[1:31:33] throw him into the lion's den how many
[1:31:34] knows the laws of little land in that
[1:31:36] hour turn to where he come against
[1:31:38] Daniel and it got thrown I mean it was
[1:31:41] the laws of our land is turning
[1:31:42] certainly against you amen
[1:31:45] and it did him he had got a loud these
[1:31:48] things allowed that happened to Daniel
[1:31:50] the hell out it happened to three Hebrew
[1:31:52] children job is a perfect example of a
[1:31:54] man that was so perfect before God but
[1:31:56] God permitted the devil to come in and
[1:31:59] so forth
[1:32:00] how many knows
[1:32:02] even his wife
[1:32:04] couldn't hold on and told job not to
[1:32:06] hold on
[1:32:07] but God knew he would hold on
[1:32:09] he would hold his Integrity God said he
[1:32:12] says there ain't a man like him you
[1:32:13] can't make him curse me
[1:32:15] and he couldn't
[1:32:16] amen
[1:32:18] he may cross permit Crossroads amen now
[1:32:22] notice one more one more just quick
[1:32:24] thought one thing that we uh the point I
[1:32:27] want to make going back to the boat if
[1:32:30] you'll notice how that
[1:32:31] uh
[1:32:33] let me see here where's my story
[1:32:53] well
[1:32:56] I think it's in the scripture itself
[1:32:59] and when they were in this and and then
[1:33:03] they that were in the ship came and
[1:33:05] worshiped him saying of the truth Thou
[1:33:09] Art the son of God
[1:33:12] let me just in closing say this
[1:33:15] and I want to call it
[1:33:17] the most precious thing in our life
[1:33:21] what's the most precious thing in our
[1:33:23] life and I know we'd say the Holy Ghost
[1:33:27] but I want to take a scriptures and just
[1:33:29] read you a scripture
[1:33:31] and that when we're going through these
[1:33:33] things Wendy's disciples
[1:33:36] seen what God come how did he delivered
[1:33:39] them and the power that he had and he'd
[1:33:41] come in there on the ship they realized
[1:33:43] the tread of a truth out the son of God
[1:33:48] Jesus said yet a little while and the
[1:33:51] world seeth me no more
[1:33:56] let me say this the most precious thing
[1:33:58] we have but ye see me because I live ye
[1:34:03] shall live also
[1:34:06] all around the message you can hear it
[1:34:07] in different churches everybody's
[1:34:09] talking about well God healed me and God
[1:34:11] did this and God did this and God did
[1:34:13] that all we can talk about is what God
[1:34:14] did what God's doing
[1:34:17] you know what it is every one of I I
[1:34:19] don't care who it is every one of us
[1:34:21] wants to see Christ
[1:34:23] in our life
[1:34:25] are you with me the most precious thing
[1:34:28] is when you go through trials and when
[1:34:30] God delivers you out of that trial
[1:34:33] it shows that he's on the ship that he's
[1:34:36] watching you that he's caring for you
[1:34:38] that he's on board and I don't know
[1:34:41] about you but that's the most precious
[1:34:42] thing we have is to know when God comes
[1:34:45] and he shows himself that he's with us
[1:34:47] just the other day Brother David called
[1:34:49] me amen and he said uh texted me or call
[1:34:51] me he says you know something Tommy send
[1:34:53] him you know something that was working
[1:34:54] on him and God just showed him it was
[1:34:56] just a verification oh and he was all
[1:34:58] excited I was like praise be to God
[1:35:00] that's it that's right that's what we
[1:35:02] look for we look for verification we
[1:35:03] look for God to confirm himself wouldn't
[1:35:06] the day I see him I see him
[1:35:09] that's what makes us happy is to see
[1:35:11] Christ in our life how many believes
[1:35:13] that
[1:35:14] the most precious thing we have is to
[1:35:16] know and he's watching us
[1:35:19] and then nothing can touch us without
[1:35:20] his permission and that he's on board
[1:35:22] that's all we care about is that we've
[1:35:24] got not left him
[1:35:26] but he's here in every heart
[1:35:29] amen not necessarily just in the church
[1:35:31] but in every individual's house where
[1:35:33] many believe that I like that scriptures
[1:35:35] the world they don't see no don't see
[1:35:37] him
[1:35:38] I think it was Bill that read a
[1:35:40] scripture that says you know uh you know
[1:35:43] every house is built by a man he says
[1:35:47] but which has the greater glory the
[1:35:50] house or the man that built it right and
[1:35:53] it's the same way with God what's
[1:35:55] greater the creation what is the most
[1:35:58] glorious the creation of the Creator I
[1:36:01] mean the whole world is enjoying his
[1:36:03] creation but they don't realize what's
[1:36:06] greater than the creation is the creator
[1:36:09] if people just give him the glory let's
[1:36:11] do it
[1:36:12] he's one that's worthy of it I'll stand
[1:36:14] with me tonight God bless you I hope you
[1:36:16] enjoyed that little thought Lord laid on
[1:36:18] my heart only he who let it will let
[1:36:21] he's in control the devil's been
[1:36:24] stripped he ain't no got no rights
[1:36:28] I thought about bringing the flashlight
[1:36:30] and shutting all these lights off
[1:36:34] and we could have done it with just
[1:36:35] simple uh just a simple light switch
[1:36:39] and you know it's like the devil and all
[1:36:41] of everything that he is and it seems
[1:36:43] like it's so powerful but you turn them
[1:36:45] lights off and you just turned Ash light
[1:36:47] on right
[1:36:48] and if you turn that flashlight on and
[1:36:51] it came on but yet everything was dark
[1:36:56] if it stayed dark
[1:36:58] you'd say that flashlight wouldn't be
[1:37:00] working right in your mind because you
[1:37:01] know that when that flashlight comes on
[1:37:04] the darkness scatters they can't make a
[1:37:07] light they can't make a light that takes
[1:37:09] out or or Another Life a Darkness a dark
[1:37:12] light that'll take out light
[1:37:15] amen light always pushes the darkness
[1:37:18] away and that's the same way it is with
[1:37:20] Christ when he's in your heart
[1:37:23] the second that light comes in
[1:37:25] from this fleas
[1:37:27] sorrow fear all of that goes away
[1:37:30] let's bow our heads Lord Jesus
[1:37:32] and before I pray
[1:37:35] I'm sure it's your heart's desire but
[1:37:36] how many in here receive want to see
[1:37:38] more of God in your life say Lord I want
[1:37:41] to see more of you in my life art

[1:37:45] us you said that the world wouldn't see
[1:37:48] me but you're gonna see me you're gonna
[1:37:50] see me working in your life you're going
[1:37:52] to see me do things and that's what we
