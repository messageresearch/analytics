[22:54] all night. And I know a lot of you are
[22:56] tired today. It's It's been a warm day
[22:59] to say the least, hasn't it? But you
[23:01] know what?
[23:03] What a wonderful place we had to come in
[23:05] and just to be in the presence of the
[23:07] Lord. And brother Joe said, "How would
[23:09] it be if we had to have church out there
[23:11] in the pavilion? It'd be warm." But you
[23:14] know, that same God would be out there
[23:16] that's in here tonight. And that's what
[23:18] we come to do is worship him tonight.
[23:20] God bless you. Those that are streaming
[23:22] tonight, Sister Parish and Sister Peggy,
[23:24] the different ones, and just say God
[23:26] bless you tonight. And it's just good to
[23:28] see each and everyone here. We had uh I
[23:30] guess Sunday
[23:32] I counted up and there was 11 or 12
[23:35] families gone Sunday. So we had quite a
[23:37] few gone Sunday. We had some visitors,
[23:40] but it looks like all home folks
[23:41] tonight. So God bless you. And this song
[23:44] come on my heart tonight. And and uh I
[23:47] know we sing it a lot sometimes, but I'm
[23:50] just glad to be one of them tonight. Are
[23:52] you glad to be one of them? Amen.
[23:55] Well, there are people almost
[23:58] everywhere.
[24:19] Yeah. Heat.
[24:33] Heat. Heat.
[24:43] Heat. Heat.
[24:56] Yeah.
[24:59] Heat.
[25:11] Heat. Heat.
[25:25] Heat. Heat.
[25:35] Heat.

[26:47] Heat. Heat.
[27:00] Heat.
[27:10] Heat.
[27:29] Heat. Heat.
[27:45] I can see I'm
[27:51] aren't you happy to be one of them
[27:52] tonight. Amen. God is good, isn't he?
[27:57] Amen. We're going to sing this next song
[27:59] is is I was asked if we would sing it
[28:01] tonight and uh for brother Joe and
[28:04] brother Austin and them. And brother Joe
[28:06] and them lost a good friend this week
[28:08] that worked for them, a good employee.
[28:10] And brother Joe was telling me about
[28:13] Danny. And he he said that, you know, he
[28:16] could he could do anything and said we
[28:18] could trust him and he could just take
[28:19] care of things for us. And and uh I
[28:22] think he was in Minnesota, wasn't he,
[28:24] Brother Joe? And he had a brain aneurysm
[28:26] and and the Lord decided to call him
[28:29] home. And you know, we don't understand
[28:31] things
[28:33] in life at all.
[28:35] And you know, there's one thing I've
[28:37] learned
[28:39] since I work for myself. We have a good
[28:42] family and we have an awesome church
[28:44] family, but then God gives us a family
[28:47] outside of people that we deal with and
[28:49] they become like family. And you know,
[28:51] when you when you lose someone, it's
[28:54] tough sometimes. And brother Joe asked
[28:57] that we'd sing this song tonight. It's
[28:59] I'll see you in the rapture. Amen. You
[29:01] know, we don't have the promise to come
[29:04] back Sunday. Any of us, we could be gone
[29:07] home.
[29:09] But there's one thing about it, my
[29:11] friend.
[29:13] The next time, if I'm not here Sunday,
[29:16] I'm gone. The next time you see me, I'm
[29:18] going to look a lot different than I do
[29:20] now.
[29:22] There won't be no sugar diabetes. There
[29:24] won't be no ball head.
[29:28] I'll be a I'll look like a young man
[29:30] again.
[29:32] And if you see somebody jumping real
[29:34] high and screaming really loud, say,
[29:37] "Brother David, is that you?" And I'll
[29:38] say, "Yes, it's so good to see you."
[29:40] Amen. Ain't that your heart's desire
[29:42] tonight? Amen.
[29:45] Oh, if we never meet again

[33:35] Michael and Brother John Way. Would you
[33:37] come help them also? And
[33:40] they ask that we'd remember the family
[33:42] in prayer. Brother Joe and Sister Hannah
[33:44] did. And remember all them. Remember
[33:46] brother Austin also in prayer. And I
[33:49] mean, we just just pray that God will
[33:51] just comfort their hearts tonight. And
[33:53] we know our God's a comforter tonight.
[33:55] And also, we want to continue to
[33:57] remember uh Sister Parish and Sister
[34:00] Peggy. And I forgot to ask if anyone had
[34:04] heard about Sister Parish, but I'm sure
[34:06] she's still moving on up. So, we want to
[34:08] continue to pray for her tonight. And
[34:10] and uh also Sister Sherry and Sister
[34:14] Janette and Sister Donna. the Lord

[42:23] mind that what kind of cancer was it?
[42:27] Prostate. Yeah, that he does have
[42:29] prostate cancer and they do have to do a
[42:32] a screening. They're going to screen
[42:34] him, screen him to make sure that it
[42:36] hasn't spread. So, how many would say,
[42:38] "Lord, help us and let that test come
[42:40] back that it hasn't spread." Amen. And I
[42:43] remember whenever Dad Donna, you know,
[42:44] was diagnosed null and and I think it
[42:46] was the very night in the same night or
[42:48] the next morning one I know brother
[42:50] Russellville was was down at the bottom
[42:52] of Grand Canyon, I think, with his bunch
[42:54] of believers and he sent a picture of
[42:56] them all gathering around. Amen. And
[43:00] praying.
[43:02] We want him to know that we're going to
[43:04] be praying for him. I mean going to be
[43:06] praying for him. Amen. The whole church
[43:08] here, we're going to be believing for
[43:10] him. Amen. that he's going to equip that
[43:13] devil. Amen. That God is going to come
[43:14] in his life, manifest himself in such a
[43:17] way, amen, that he will experience the
[43:20] healing power of almighty God. Amen.
[43:23] We're not taking defeat. We're not
[43:25] accepting the devil's package. Amen.
[43:27] We're believing that he'll be fine and
[43:29] he'll get uh have every day that he has
[43:31] coming to him. Amen. So, let's bow our
[43:34] heads all and everybody pray for brother
[43:35] Russell, will you? Lord Jesus, we come
[43:37] before you just now, Lord. And we want
[43:39] to remember our brother, Lord, that has
[43:41] certainly gotten a bad report, Lord
[43:43] Jesus, from the doctor, Lord. But we
[43:45] thank you, Lord Jesus, for the good
[43:46] report that you have given us in Isaiah
[43:49] 56, God, that you said by your stripes,
[43:52] Russell is healed, Brother Russell
[43:54] Wallace. We believe, God, that you'll do
[43:57] a miracle for him, Lord Jesus, and that
[43:58] you'll cast out this enemy that has come
[44:01] and invaded this property of Almighty
[44:04] God. Devil has no right to be there. And
[44:07] we believe, God, that Brother Russell is
[44:09] right with you, Lord Jesus. And we
[44:11] believe, God, that you'll do a miracle,
[44:12] Lord Jesus. Father, that it'll make the
[44:15] whole community of the believers and the
[44:17] Christian realm, Lord Jesus, be in awe
[44:19] of what God can do. We have already seen
[44:22] what you can do in my wife, Lord Jesus.
[44:24] And Father, we ask God that you'll do
[44:26] the same for our brother, Lord. Cast
[44:28] that devil out. We do in the name of
[44:31] Jesus Christ. And we believe that he is
[44:34] healed. Amen. Amen. And amen. Thank you,
[44:37] Lord Jesus. Let's stop before the Lord.
[44:39] Say, "Thank you, Lord. It's already
[44:41] done." Amen. It's already done. Praise
[44:44] the Lord. Amen. Let's bow. Not bow our
[44:48] heads. Let's open our Bibles. We just
[44:50] bowed our heads. Amen. Oh my. Praise the
[44:55] Lord. Amen.
[44:58] Amen. I'll tell you something. I might
[45:00] as well tell you. I was at the picking
[45:02] up uh Donna's prescription at the doctor
[45:05] today and you got to remember their
[45:06] birthday you know and I couldn't quite
[45:08] remember her birthday and somebody local
[45:10] I hardware lady sister
[45:14] G Jeanie I think it was was there and I
[45:16] was trying to remember her birthday and
[45:18] she said you better remember her
[45:19] birthday and I was scrambling there and
[45:21] then was
[45:24] another old man was sitting there about
[45:26] 80 years old I guess and he was watching
[45:28] this whole thing and you know he says
[45:31] Uh he says uh something about well that
[45:34] it'll get worse or something you know
[45:36] and and Genie was telling me I'm in
[45:39] trouble if you don't remember and stuff.
[45:40] And then the lady says well what's her
[45:42] name? I said Donna Ber I remember that.
[45:47] Oh my Oh my Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[45:53] So that's how it goes. Praise the Lord.
[45:56] Turn your Bibles if you will to Romans,
[45:58] to the book of Romans. And probably I
[46:00] think brother uh brother Ben Norrod will
[46:05] be with us this coming. Uh brother Brad,
[46:08] I'm going to have him do probably about
[46:09] three services after that. Amen. So,
[46:12] Amen. We're going to hear some good
[46:13] preaching here coming up.
[46:16] Amen.
[46:17] Praise the Lord. Now, one scripture that
[46:20] I didn't get to read to uh read uh last
[46:24] Sunday that I want to pick up on. Amen.
[46:27] And we've been talking about the two
[46:29] gods. Isn't that right? One is a real
[46:32] God. God is there's only one true God,
[46:34] one real God. Amen. He's the creator God
[46:37] speaks things into existence. We know
[46:39] that the devil is a false god, right?
[46:42] He's a false god. Uh he, you know, he's
[46:44] nothing but a inter in impersonator.
[46:48] Isaiah 14 talked about he wanted to be
[46:50] like the most high, you know, and be on
[46:52] the on a throne and all of that. And
[46:54] then we find below that that there's
[46:56] idols that can be gods to people.
[46:58] There's many gods. Isn't that right?
[47:00] Many gods. And I want to talk to you
[47:02] about a third kind here this evening
[47:04] with the help of the Lord here in a
[47:06] little bit. A third kind. That's going
[47:07] to be amen something that I want to test
[47:10] you on a little bit. But anyway, so we
[47:12] find that there's all of those. Amen.
[47:15] But basically what we've been preaching
[47:17] on is that you serve one or the other.
[47:19] No man can serve two masters, right? So
[47:22] you're going to love the one and hate
[47:23] the other or whatever. You're going to
[47:24] serve two and you get paid. You get
[47:27] paid. The wages of sin is death, but the
[47:30] gift of God is eternal life. And that I
[47:32] come, Jesus said, I come that you might
[47:34] have life and have that more abundantly.
[47:37] Ain't that right? Have more abundant
[47:39] life. That's what Jesus come. He said
[47:40] that the thief comes not but to kill, to
[47:42] steal, and to destroy. So, we know the
[47:45] devil is boy, he's he's a terrible
[47:47] master to serve. I don't know why
[47:49] anybody would want to have anything to
[47:51] do with the devil, but they sure do.
[47:53] Ain't that right? And so, there's a
[47:56] reward for each. And uh for either one
[47:59] that you serve. And so, Paul kind of
[48:02] expresses that this in this scripture.
[48:04] And I found this scripture and I wanted
[48:05] to, you know, read that here last
[48:07] service, but I didn't. So, we're going
[48:09] to go into this this scripture and then
[48:12] just continue on. And it's found in
[48:14] Romans 2, if you'll if I pull that out.
[48:18] Romans 2 and verse 6. And um let me see.
[48:23] All right. Can you uh I'm going to do
[48:25] this. I'm going to use my little thing
[48:27] here if everybody wants to read with me.
[48:29] Who will render to every man according
[48:31] to his deeds. Now go to keep going. To
[48:34] them who by patient continuence and
[48:37] welloing seek for glory and honor,
[48:40] immortality,
[48:42] eternal life. Now, we read that fast. Go
[48:44] back a little bit. Go back to the other
[48:46] one. Uh because I want to what I'm going
[48:48] to go off of and where I got my thought
[48:50] of from was this word glory and honor
[48:55] and immortality,
[48:57] eternal life. Cuz you know to them
[49:01] that's talking about us, right? Amen.
[49:03] Talking about us there. To them who by
[49:06] patient continuence in welloing seek for
[49:11] glory. Amen. And I thought, man, we're
[49:13] seeking glory. Well, we want to find out
[49:15] just what kind of glory we seek. Ain't
[49:17] that right? Amen. Honor, immortality,
[49:22] eternal life. Now, go to the next one.
[49:25] But unto them, see, here's the reward
[49:27] for those that don't. But unto them that
[49:29] are contentious and do not obey the
[49:31] truth, but obey unrighteousness, what do
[49:35] they get?
[49:38] Indignation and wrath. Go on to the next
[49:41] one. Not only indignation and wrath, but
[49:44] tribulation and anguish.
[49:48] My goodness. Tribulation and anguish,
[49:51] Paul says, upon every soul of men that
[49:55] doeth evil to the Jew first and also to
[49:59] the Gentile.
[50:01] My next one. Next one. But glory.
[50:06] Amen. Somebody say it with me. But
[50:08] glory, honor, and peace to every man
[50:13] that workketh good to the Jew first and
[50:17] also to the Gentile.
[50:20] Amen. Give the Lord's word a hand. Say,
[50:22] "Thank you, Lord Jesus." Praise the
[50:24] Lord. Amen. You can be seated this
[50:27] evening. Amen. Praise the Lord. We uh I
[50:30] thought, well, this, you know, I studied
[50:32] for a little bit. I says, "Well, we do
[50:33] probably just won't hold them too long."
[50:35] But you know how it is with ministers
[50:37] when we get to study and we get our
[50:39] little plate full. We'll try not to go
[50:41] too long. Amen. Praise the Lord. But now
[50:44] I like this because I wanted to that was
[50:46] kind of my punchline once again Sunday
[50:48] talking about, you know, for the
[50:50] believer. Amen. We seek glory and honor
[50:56] and and and immortality,
[50:59] eternal life. That's what we crave for.
[51:02] That's what we desire.
[51:04] [Music]
[51:05] But to those that are contentious, Amen.
[51:08] And do not obey the truth, rebellious,
[51:11] do not obey, he says, uh, but
[51:14] unrighteousness, indignation, and wrath,
[51:16] tribulation, and anguish. So before I
[51:19] really get started, I want to I want to
[51:23] bring in another thought here after I
[51:24] kind of get started. But let's let's
[51:27] first of all I wrote down here it says
[51:30] you know if you re you have to we know
[51:32] that we're going to have to be
[51:33] controlled by one or the other. We have
[51:35] to have to re reap the rewards of one or
[51:38] the other. And so if you don't want to
[51:41] serve God then I welcome you to this.
[51:47] Isn't that what Paul was pretty much
[51:48] saying to those that don't obey the
[51:51] truth? Tribulation and anguish and
[51:54] wrath, you know, and anybody Jew, it
[51:56] doesn't matter who it is. If you ain't
[51:58] going to serve God, welcome to
[52:00] tribulation. Welcome to wrath. Welcome
[52:03] to anguish.
[52:07] My gracious. Think about this. You know
[52:10] it says that uh uh you know even when
[52:13] they did not retain God in their
[52:14] knowledge but God gave them over to a
[52:16] reprobate mind to do other things which
[52:18] are not convenient. You don't want to
[52:20] serve God then he let them be filled. He
[52:23] lets them be filled with unrighteousness
[52:26] fornication wickedness covetousness
[52:29] maliciousness full of envy murder debate
[52:33] deceit malignity and whisperers
[52:36] backbiters. hateful haters of God.
[52:40] I mean, that's what they're going to be
[52:42] filled with. Despiteful,
[52:45] proud.
[52:47] My think about it. They're all these and
[52:49] they're proud of it. Yeah. I'm hateful
[52:52] and my Yeah.
[52:57] boy. Boy, you talk about a cup full. You
[53:00] talk about a bunch of mess in your
[53:02] heart.
[53:03] Amen. Listen. Inventors of evil things,
[53:06] disobedient to parents without
[53:09] understanding, covenant breakers without
[53:11] natural affection, implable, unmerciful,
[53:15] who knowing the judgment of God, that
[53:17] they which commit such things are worthy
[53:19] of death, not only do the same, but have
[53:22] pleasure in them that do those. Listen,
[53:26] you have something else. Amen. that that
[53:28] these people are full of the works of
[53:30] the flesh are manifested which are these
[53:32] adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
[53:34] lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft.
[53:38] You want to have your flesh to be the
[53:40] ruler. You want your flesh to get the
[53:42] better of you. The works of the flesh
[53:45] are all these: hatred, variance,
[53:47] emulation, wrath, strife,
[53:50] seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,
[53:53] drunkenness, revelings of such like of
[53:56] which I tell you before, as I have also
[53:59] told you in times past that they which
[54:01] do such things shall not inherit the
[54:03] kingdom of God.
[54:06] Amen. Well, I don't know about you, but
[54:08] I don't want no part of that.
[54:10] No, I don't want no part of the devil. I
[54:12] don't want no part of that. Amen. How
[54:15] many with me? We want to serve God.
[54:16] Choose you this day who you will serve.
[54:20] I mean I was and I thought about the
[54:22] facts of life. You know as you go
[54:24] driving by a graveyard. I mean you think
[54:26] about you think about the facts of life.
[54:28] I thought I was reading my brother B
[54:30] says you know you don't know but it may
[54:32] be by morning it won't be but a few days
[54:34] you could be laying in a casket and all
[54:36] your friends be gathered around you and
[54:37] looking at you down at you.
[54:41] Amen. How many glad to understand, so to
[54:43] speak, the facts of life and death? Life
[54:46] and death.
[54:48] Yeah. There's a casket. How many know if
[54:50] time carries and the rapture don't come?
[54:53] Amen. The fact is there's a grave
[54:55] waiting for you. There's a casket
[54:57] waiting for you.
[54:59] Amen.
[55:01] My But think about this. And also, how
[55:04] many know where give account man must
[55:06] give an account for his deeds? Yeah,
[55:10] you've got to give an account for your
[55:12] deeds. Who will render every man
[55:14] according to his deeds? How many knows
[55:16] it's important
[55:18] the way that we live and what we do and
[55:20] the choices that we make.
[55:23] It's vital. We're not playing life.
[55:26] No, this is life and you have to make
[55:29] real choices that affect you in a real
[55:31] way.
[55:33] We want to make the right choices, not
[55:35] the wrong choices. We want to choose
[55:37] God, not the devil.
[55:40] Amen. Aren't you so glad that we want to
[55:43] be part of God's glory? What is some of
[55:45] that glory that we want? Amen. The glory
[55:48] of being and understanding that you are
[55:51] a son and daughter of God. To know where
[55:54] you come from, to know what your purpose
[55:56] is here, and to know where you're going.
[55:59] Amen. And it's not just in the grave.
[56:01] Amen. But how many know there's a
[56:03] resurrection coming? There's a God,
[56:06] amen, that is going to raise up
[56:08] everybody again. There's a heaven to go
[56:11] to a hell to John.
[56:16] Amen. Praise be to God. Hallelujah.
[56:21] So now I wanted to get into something
[56:23] else just before started. Amen.
[56:28] As a little thought, you know, I I try
[56:30] to capture every little thought that
[56:31] comes by Tommy. He probably knows how
[56:33] that is. But you try to capture those
[56:34] thoughts that God brings into your mind,
[56:36] scriptures that he brings that kind of
[56:38] inspire you that you know you maybe
[56:40] speak on.
[56:42] Amen.
[56:44] And my question was
[56:47] just how sincere should you be
[56:52] to make sure that you don't miss heaven?
[56:56] Amen.
[56:59] And a scripture came to my mind cuz we
[57:01] know the prophet of God when he sent
[57:03] beyond the curtain of time he says
[57:04] whatever you do don't miss it. And
[57:08] whatever you do don't never take that
[57:10] downward road. Don't never take that
[57:13] wrong road
[57:15] cuz he had been in for both places when
[57:18] he was younger not right with God and he
[57:20] got that you know uh he was almost at
[57:22] the point of death laying in his blood
[57:24] and the doctors were just about had
[57:26] given him up and his heartbeat was just
[57:28] so many times a minute and and he could
[57:31] hear his own blood splashing I think it
[57:32] was and my he's you know and and and
[57:35] where he was was terrible but God didn't
[57:37] let him die. Amen. How many glad for
[57:41] that? That's right. Because brother Ram
[57:43] said there's old ladies, millions of
[57:45] them. The old ladies, he says, "If you
[57:46] wouldn't have went, we wouldn't be
[57:48] here." So they were thankful for his
[57:51] sacrifice. God was going to see to it
[57:52] that we have Malachi 4.
[57:57] Amen. But there he was in both places.
[57:59] Amen. And he was also in the other
[58:01] place. He says, "Whatever you do, don't
[58:02] go there." And Jesus,
[58:06] I'm going to let Jesus tell you how
[58:08] sincere you ought to be about not
[58:11] missing heaven.
[58:14] Amen.
[58:17] He says, "If thy right eye offend thee,
[58:22] pluck it out
[58:25] and cast it from thee.
[58:28] For it is profitable for thee that one
[58:32] of thy members should perish and not thy
[58:35] whole body be cast into hell.
[58:40] And if thy right hand offend thee, cut
[58:42] it out,
[58:45] and cast it from thee.
[58:47] For it is profitable for thee that one
[58:50] of thy members perish.
[58:53] Amen. and that thy whole body should be
[58:56] cast into hell.
[59:01] Hello.
[59:03] So, what is he saying? If you something,
[59:06] if there's something in your life,
[59:09] Amen. If there's a part of your body, he
[59:13] could have put it different, but he
[59:14] talked about a part of your body.
[59:16] There's a part of your body that's going
[59:18] to keep you from being there, he said,
[59:20] cut it out.
[59:25] The scripture before that he talks about
[59:27] whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust
[59:29] after has committed adultery with her in
[59:30] his heart already. And then he said, "If
[59:32] I have anything, can you imagine
[59:33] somebody going around, Amen, without any
[59:36] eyes?" And I just couldn't quit looking
[59:39] at the wrong thing.
[59:41] Oh, and you say, "Well, that was dumb.
[59:46] You mean you can't see because you did,
[59:48] you know, this, that, or the other?"
[59:50] According to the scriptures, you ought
[59:52] to applaud the man.
[59:54] Amen. He was dead serious about, "Hey,
[59:56] I'm going to overcome it. I'm not going
[59:58] to hell with two eyes." Amen. because it
[1:00:01] kept me from going to going to heaven.
[1:00:05] Amen. So I thought, you know, that's the
[1:00:07] way it ought to be. You know, he says
[1:00:09] Jesus said he that if you don't even
[1:00:11] you've got to even hate your own life if
[1:00:14] you're going to come and be my disc. How
[1:00:16] many know you got to be willing to die
[1:00:19] for the Lord?
[1:00:21] Amen. Many of them down through the dark
[1:00:23] ages had to. But especially in our day,
[1:00:26] you have to be willing to die to self.
[1:00:30] Amen. This evening with the help of the
[1:00:33] Lord, this is kind of a message that's
[1:00:35] going to be an answer to the question or
[1:00:39] the statement that I've made here that
[1:00:43] you need to be ready for the rapture.
[1:00:47] Need to be ready. Jesus said, "Be ye
[1:00:50] ready for you know not the day and the
[1:00:51] hour." He didn't halfway and said ready.
[1:00:54] Not almost. I'm almost ready.
[1:00:57] How many know there's going to be a lot
[1:00:59] of people that find it be left behind.
[1:01:01] They were almost
[1:01:03] them people that went out to look for
[1:01:04] that oil. They almost found oil
[1:01:08] but didn't quite find it. I don't know
[1:01:10] about you, but I don't want almost.
[1:01:12] God don't want you to be almost. But I
[1:01:15] want to tell you how that some
[1:01:18] indications.
[1:01:19] I want to give you some indications of
[1:01:21] what that means to be ready.
[1:01:25] Amen. How many believes that you can
[1:01:28] know that you're ready?
[1:01:30] You can know that you're ready.
[1:01:34] So, it's a pretty to me it's a pretty
[1:01:37] monumental message. Amen.
[1:01:42] Amen. I'm glad to have my brother Mooney
[1:01:45] with us tonight.
[1:01:47] I mean, hopefully he'll make it a habit.
[1:01:49] You know, he's been going through a
[1:01:50] rough time. It's been a hard time. And
[1:01:54] we've been praying for him and he got me
[1:01:55] to call me up the other day and he said,
[1:01:58] "Thomas, can can you come pray for me?"
[1:02:01] And he asked Brad, too, but I couldn't
[1:02:03] get a hold of Brad at the time. And so I
[1:02:05] says, "I'll come over and pray for you."
[1:02:06] And I got over there and he said,
[1:02:08] "Thomas, I I just felt led to call you."
[1:02:10] Something said, "Call Thomas." He says,
[1:02:12] "Cuz you're the pastor."
[1:02:15] And I was like, that kind of caught my
[1:02:17] attention. Pastor. I got to thinking,
[1:02:20] you know, there's no higher authority in
[1:02:21] an area than the pastor. Amen. No higher
[1:02:24] authority. So yeah, you did the right
[1:02:27] thing. Call the pastor of the area.
[1:02:29] Amen. And I believe that that voice that
[1:02:33] was talking to him was the right voice.
[1:02:35] Amen. Then tonight I got back after
[1:02:38] prayer and uh my phone had I think he
[1:02:42] had run it six times it looked like. And
[1:02:44] I says, "Well, I better call him. I'm in
[1:02:45] church, but I'm going to call him." So I
[1:02:46] called him. He says, "I feel like I
[1:02:48] ought to be in church." Amen.
[1:02:51] In church. I ought you ought to be in
[1:02:52] church. And you know, when I was talking
[1:02:55] to you and praying for you over there,
[1:02:57] you know, I thought about after I left,
[1:02:58] I thought, you know, I I I ought to tell
[1:03:00] him to come to church. But I didn't. I
[1:03:02] didn't tell him. So, I just want to say
[1:03:04] to him tonight, keep listening to that
[1:03:07] voice. I believe that voice that you
[1:03:09] heard is the right voice. Amen. He wants
[1:03:12] to get back in church. He wants to get
[1:03:13] his life right. He wants to serve God.
[1:03:16] Amen. How many give the Lord a hand?
[1:03:19] Okay. Thank you, Jesus. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:22] That devil money will have to go. I
[1:03:24] don't care how long he lingers, that
[1:03:26] anxiety devil has got to go. Amen. Why?
[1:03:30] Cuz we have talked about him. Make sure
[1:03:32] everything was right. Everything under
[1:03:33] the blood. And he's willing to repent of
[1:03:35] anything. And you have that attitude.
[1:03:37] You open yourself up for that devil to
[1:03:39] have to go. He has no closet, no room,
[1:03:42] no hole, no corner anywhere. Amen. To to
[1:03:46] hide. Amen. So this is an answer to
[1:03:48] prayer. Brother Mooney. Amen. Answer to
[1:03:52] prayer. Amen. In a much awaited time.
[1:03:54] Amen. So, praise the Lord. So, let's
[1:03:57] look at this.
[1:03:59] Amen. Aren't you glad to understand?
[1:04:01] Let's get into the message now. Thinking
[1:04:03] about how that we we ought to be
[1:04:06] thankful the for the glory that God has
[1:04:09] shown us.
[1:04:11] The glory of God. How many know God has
[1:04:14] shown us his glory and his honor? We
[1:04:18] look for honor. What is that honor? That
[1:04:21] honor is to sit with him in his throne.
[1:04:25] How many's looking forward to sitting?
[1:04:27] What an honor it would be to sit with
[1:04:30] him in his throne as he sat down on his
[1:04:32] father's throne. One day, brother and
[1:04:34] sister, you and I will be there right
[1:04:36] beside him. Amen. We're going to be the
[1:04:39] bride of Jesus Christ. We're going to be
[1:04:41] not out there the servants. No, but
[1:04:43] we're going to be right there on the
[1:04:44] throne around him. Amen. That's a real
[1:04:48] honor to have it. It's a real honor.
[1:04:51] It's a real glory to be a son of God.
[1:04:55] I thought about how that it is such a
[1:04:57] glory to be a son or a daughter of God.
[1:05:03] So many people in the world don't know
[1:05:06] where they come from.
[1:05:09] They don't know what their purpose is
[1:05:11] here and they don't know where they
[1:05:13] going.
[1:05:15] How many thought we do know where we
[1:05:17] come from? Praise the Lord. Listen to
[1:05:20] this, brother Bam. Things that are to be
[1:05:22] 65. Your birth here was pre-planned.
[1:05:27] Oh my. I guess you believe that everyone
[1:05:29] of know you know that your birth was
[1:05:31] pre-planned. Did you know that your
[1:05:32] being here never originated from just a
[1:05:35] myth or a thought? Everything. It was
[1:05:37] all pre-planned by God before the
[1:05:39] foundation of the world.
[1:05:42] Amen.
[1:05:43] that you are here. Amen. He's infinite.
[1:05:46] He knew every flea that would ever be on
[1:05:48] earth and how many times it would bend
[1:05:50] its eyes. See, and our little minds
[1:05:52] cannot fathom that what infinite means.
[1:05:54] God knows all things. Now, there
[1:05:57] therefore there's nothing out of cater.
[1:05:59] Now, if we know the word of God, we know
[1:06:01] that we are when we know the word of
[1:06:03] God. I want to say we know where we come
[1:06:04] from. We know where we are living and we
[1:06:08] know the hour that we're living in. We
[1:06:11] know what lays ahead.
[1:06:15] We see what we've passed. Amen. Praise
[1:06:19] the Lord. See, then it goes again. It
[1:06:21] talking about the pre-planned being
[1:06:23] pre-planned of God. So, you were all
[1:06:26] pre-planned by God.
[1:06:31] Woo. That ought to do something. But,
[1:06:33] Brad, you was ordained to sit there for
[1:06:36] today. All of you every everything this
[1:06:38] setting tonight was pre-planned.
[1:06:42] Oh, there's nothing like being in the
[1:06:44] center of God's plan, in the center of
[1:06:47] his will and knowing you're completely
[1:06:49] surrendered to him. And yet you are of
[1:06:52] God on the inside leading and guiding.
[1:06:56] What an honor. What glory that is.
[1:07:00] Amen.
[1:07:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:05] Hallelujah.
[1:07:07] All pre-planned by God. Nothing happens
[1:07:10] by chance with God. He knows all about
[1:07:12] him. Oh, I love that scripture. We know
[1:07:14] that all things work together for the
[1:07:17] good to them that love God, to them who
[1:07:20] are the called according to his purpose.
[1:07:23] Everything works together. That's why
[1:07:25] God said, "You can't lose if you're in
[1:07:27] the program of Almighty God." There's no
[1:07:30] such a thing as losing to for a
[1:07:32] Christian.
[1:07:35] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:07:38] Amen.
[1:07:41] Listen, it's all preparing planned for
[1:07:45] many generations back so you could be
[1:07:48] here tonight.
[1:07:51] How many glad to be here?
[1:07:54] I'm glad to be here.
[1:07:59] I'm glad I'm not miserable. I'm not glad
[1:08:02] I'm not serving the devil.
[1:08:04] I'm glad I'm not out of God's will.
[1:08:07] Right in the center of his will. Stay
[1:08:09] there.
[1:08:11] Woo. Glory. Praise be to God. How many
[1:08:14] knows? Oh my. We've heard it before, but
[1:08:16] man, just when the inspiration strikes,
[1:08:18] you realize, hey, it might sound like
[1:08:20] such a small thing, but it's not. You're
[1:08:23] here because God chose you to be here.
[1:08:27] I like being here.
[1:08:31] Oh my. Because if I'm here by the will
[1:08:34] of God, don't worry. Get the old worry
[1:08:37] out of your head. You're going to be
[1:08:39] there. Amen. Because he has begun a good
[1:08:41] work in you. He will perform it. I'm not
[1:08:44] counting on myself to make it. I'm
[1:08:46] counting on him to make it for me.
[1:08:50] I count on him having me in his hand.
[1:08:52] And nothing can pop me out of his hand.
[1:08:56] Nothing can you out of his hand.
[1:09:00] Sorry.
[1:09:02] That's what I'm relying on when brother
[1:09:05] was preaching on preaching on every the
[1:09:07] time test of memorial time. I mean the
[1:09:09] bridge of Sydney and so forth. God tests
[1:09:11] everything. Amen. And those that are
[1:09:13] really tested have their eyes fixed like
[1:09:16] granite or sort of when granted but
[1:09:18] something else like flint. We have our
[1:09:21] our sights fixed on Calvary. Amen. That
[1:09:26] means you're re completely relying on
[1:09:28] what God does, what God did.
[1:09:34] Amen.
[1:09:36] Praise be to God.
[1:09:38] Hallelujah.
[1:09:41] Amen.
[1:09:44] Did you think Did you know that? He says
[1:09:47] everything was planned for way back.
[1:09:49] That's right. Just think you at one time
[1:09:52] I'll repeat this again.
[1:09:55] At one time was in your father in the
[1:09:58] gene of your father and we could say our
[1:10:01] great great great great
[1:10:03] grandfather way back there.
[1:10:07] Huh?
[1:10:10] This just comes to mind. So I'll slow
[1:10:11] down.
[1:10:17] You see why uh that bull
[1:10:25] that your great great great
[1:10:26] great-grandfather was in the pen with
[1:10:28] and he come at him and he almost smashed
[1:10:31] him in the gates. He was up to kill him.
[1:10:35] And guess what? Somehow or other great
[1:10:38] big great big great big great big great
[1:10:38] big great big great big great big great
[1:10:38] big great big great great great
[1:10:39] granddaddy
[1:10:41] jumped. You ain't never seen a man jump
[1:10:43] like that. All right.
[1:10:46] All right. You dodged him
[1:10:49] because if he'd have got killed, you
[1:10:51] wouldn't be here.
[1:10:53] How many knows God watched out for you?
[1:10:56] Great great great great granddaddy. He
[1:10:58] was making sure you get here.
[1:11:01] Glory. Not just him. No, I was that was
[1:11:04] a figure of speech out there.
[1:11:07] No, you know, I I you you know, we think
[1:11:11] we I Well, maybe if they write it down
[1:11:14] in the history books, you might
[1:11:16] remember, but hardly any of us probably
[1:11:18] remember our great great great
[1:11:19] granddaddy. You'd have to look in a book
[1:11:21] to find out what his name was. That's
[1:11:24] why if time would go on, people would
[1:11:26] really not remember you. Amen. And
[1:11:29] that's okay. Just as long as he
[1:11:31] remembers me when the calling time
[1:11:33] comes. When it come time to call. Amen.
[1:11:36] I'll be somewhere listening for my name.
[1:11:39] That's all I care. When I make up my
[1:11:41] jewels, God says, when I call, when I
[1:11:43] make up my jewels, Amen. You're going to
[1:11:45] be there. Amen. Because why? Because
[1:11:48] they thought about him and talked about
[1:11:50] him in Malachi 3 or 4 there. Praise the
[1:11:54] Lord. Okay. Well, we're never going to
[1:11:57] get through this way, but anyway,
[1:12:00] good. Just I like to slow down and just
[1:12:06] chew the fat.
[1:12:09] Don't you just love to chew on that fat?
[1:12:12] Get a little bit of that meat together
[1:12:13] and
[1:12:16] cardiovascular system. Look out.
[1:12:21] Oh my. That's all right.
[1:12:27] I'm just going to go ahead and tell you
[1:12:30] my brother-in-law David Mills. you know
[1:12:31] how he is. Maybe he's listening. And uh
[1:12:35] he said his good some kind of a real
[1:12:37] good health man said that and you said
[1:12:41] that you ought to eat beef fat. So he
[1:12:43] goes to the store and buys beef fat,
[1:12:45] fries it and eats beef fat.
[1:12:48] Little bit of beef fat.
[1:12:52] You know, it's hard to believe what's
[1:12:54] true, isn't it? Little bit hard to
[1:12:56] believe what is true. One day they'll
[1:12:58] tell you to eat eggs, and then they'll
[1:12:59] tell you not to eat eggs, and then
[1:13:01] they'll tell you, "Yeah, eggs are good
[1:13:02] after all." And one day they'll tell you
[1:13:04] don't drink milk, and then I drink milk.
[1:13:06] And hey, if I like it, I'm going to eat
[1:13:08] it.
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:13] Amen.
[1:13:15] Amen. All right. Go to the doctor and
[1:13:19] see what we can do to fix this. It's
[1:13:20] what we about to do, don't we?
[1:13:24] Amen. All right. So we looked at
[1:13:28] everything is pre-planned. Where you
[1:13:29] come from? Let's talk about where we
[1:13:31] come from. We know that we come from
[1:13:33] father God. How many believe that we
[1:13:35] come from God? Even as Jesus said, I
[1:13:38] come from God and I go back to God.
[1:13:41] You and I have come from God. Now, let's
[1:13:45] look at what we're here for. Would that
[1:13:46] be okay?
[1:13:49] All right.
[1:13:51] And one more one more quote on where you
[1:13:54] come from. Now, the only way that you
[1:13:56] can be a son and daughter of God because
[1:13:59] you have to have eternal life. Amen. How
[1:14:02] many believes that? And there's only one
[1:14:04] form of eternal life and that's God's
[1:14:07] life.
[1:14:09] The only one form of eternal life that
[1:14:12] was God. There to be a son of God, you
[1:14:14] had to be in him always.
[1:14:19] Amen. Always.
[1:14:25] I'm going to go ahead and say it. I
[1:14:27] think one of the most powerful things,
[1:14:30] most powerful revelations that God gives
[1:14:33] us that is an atomic bomb to the devil
[1:14:36] when he tries to tell you you won't be
[1:14:37] saved. You won't make it.
[1:14:40] Hello. One of the most powerful things
[1:14:43] is that he says you wasn't saved on any
[1:14:45] certain day.
[1:14:48] Amen. That's powerful
[1:14:51] cuz I can take you to the time and I can
[1:14:54] take you to the place fill a big creek
[1:14:57] down in Pinecraft.
[1:15:00] Hello. Where the Lord saved me and
[1:15:03] filled me with his Holy Ghost.
[1:15:06] Yeah, sure. That's perhaps when I
[1:15:08] recognize it.
[1:15:10] That's when I realize, hey, he died for
[1:15:13] me. It's for me. I am part of this. I am
[1:15:18] part of God. God saved me really did.
[1:15:22] But we did was with him before the world
[1:15:25] ever began. You was saved in the mind of
[1:15:28] God already.
[1:15:30] Amen. Praise the Lord. How many know?
[1:15:32] Aren't you glad that before the first
[1:15:34] star was put out there before the first
[1:15:37] speck of of the the solar system when
[1:15:40] God was there by himself?
[1:15:44] Amen. In his mind, he wrote your name
[1:15:46] down before the foundation of the world.
[1:15:50] He put your name down. Yet when you was
[1:15:52] saved, when he put your name down,
[1:15:56] that's enough to get you happy,
[1:15:59] knowing that it's not
[1:16:02] something that you muster up or come up
[1:16:04] with
[1:16:06] or necessarily a choice you make. Even
[1:16:08] though you will make that choice, you do
[1:16:10] have to make that choice, but that's not
[1:16:12] what it hinges on.
[1:16:14] Amen.
[1:16:15] You had to be with God. And that's what
[1:16:18] we love. I mean, what I don't know about
[1:16:20] you, but that's what I'm looking for.
[1:16:22] How many's looking for that eternal
[1:16:24] life, that immortality? Paul said, "We
[1:16:28] look for immortality."
[1:16:34] [Music]
[1:16:36] Amen.
[1:16:38] Praise the Lord. So listen.
[1:16:41] So he says well I'm only one form. He
[1:16:45] says you had to be in him always. The
[1:16:48] gene of your life, the spiritual life
[1:16:52] tonight. And of course we could if we
[1:16:55] had time but to go into that little
[1:16:57] something that told you this was wrong
[1:16:59] and that was wrong. He says that that
[1:17:00] was that little gene working. Amen.
[1:17:04] Amen.
[1:17:06] Brother Mooney remembers when we were
[1:17:09] still sinners when I first come down
[1:17:11] from Ohio. We was in the house there.
[1:17:14] You might remember. And I started
[1:17:16] preaching to you almost. And you we was
[1:17:18] half drunk probably. And he says, "Man,
[1:17:21] until you're going to live it, don't
[1:17:22] preach it to me." I said, "Yeah, yeah,
[1:17:25] yeah. You're right. You're right. You're
[1:17:26] right." And I left it like that. I left
[1:17:28] it. It was kind of some kind of a
[1:17:29] revelation I had or whatever. It was
[1:17:31] that little gene working. I just hadn't
[1:17:34] really come to it yet. I hadn't
[1:17:35] surrendered until later on. It was a bit
[1:17:38] later before God really went that gene.
[1:17:41] He really begin to work. Hey, there's
[1:17:43] got to be more to life than just
[1:17:45] partying. There's got to be more life
[1:17:47] than just all of this, you know, living
[1:17:49] however you want to. There's, you know,
[1:17:50] leaving you totally empty. Hello. And
[1:17:53] not feeling Yeah. like you're nothing
[1:17:55] but a rag. Hello. And a dirty old rag of
[1:17:58] some kind. There got to be something
[1:18:00] more. Got to be something more.
[1:18:02] And I don't mean to get on my testimony
[1:18:04] here, but
[1:18:06] still. Amen. God begin to working and I
[1:18:09] begin to searching and and talking to
[1:18:12] different ones and and trying to find
[1:18:14] basically seeking God. I realized that
[1:18:17] that wasn't later I found out it was God
[1:18:19] pulling on me. It was God. No man comes
[1:18:22] to the father unless my to me unless my
[1:18:24] father draws him. I mean that was the
[1:18:27] father drawing him drawing me.
[1:18:30] And I tried different uh I'm going to go
[1:18:33] ahead different different people that
[1:18:35] would come through in robes and
[1:18:37] everything else and hey what do you
[1:18:38] believe? You got some robes on you must
[1:18:40] be religious. I wasn't afraid to go up
[1:18:41] and say what do you believe?
[1:18:44] Tell me what you believe. And they got
[1:18:46] the you know doing crazy stuff like
[1:18:49] condemning me for wearing shoes. Thou
[1:18:50] shalt not kill. And you had to put kill
[1:18:52] the cow to get the leather for your
[1:18:54] shoes. Well please forgive me. I was
[1:18:56] ignorant. That's it.
[1:18:58] I'll call me ignorant. I didn't know,
[1:19:00] you know. He said, "So, tell me more."
[1:19:02] And so they said, "Come back to Pine
[1:19:03] Craft Park back there where you usually
[1:19:05] go at the ramp." And there was a little
[1:19:07] trail that goes back into bushes back
[1:19:09] there. Amen. They were back there and I
[1:19:11] went way pumped by into the bushes to
[1:19:13] find them people over there. And they
[1:19:14] were more concerned about washing their
[1:19:16] clothes. Where they going to go wash
[1:19:17] their clothes? And they had something
[1:19:18] wrapped up and smoking. Now, I don't
[1:19:21] know if that was tobacco or another kind
[1:19:23] of tobacco, but I said, "Whatever it is,
[1:19:25] I'm out of here. This ain't it. This is
[1:19:28] not what I was looking for.
[1:19:31] [Applause]
[1:19:33] And so that was the end of that. But the
[1:19:37] point that I want to make just shortly
[1:19:38] with this is I'm so glad. I am so glad
[1:19:42] that God had sent Malachi 4 and somebody
[1:19:45] knew of a prophet. Ain't that right? Cuz
[1:19:47] when I met them, I come to the right
[1:19:50] thing. Amen. That was the right way.
[1:19:53] Amen.
[1:19:54] I thank God cuz I'd still be lost. You'd
[1:19:57] still be lost. You'd still be wondering.
[1:19:59] You'd still be seeking if God wouldn't
[1:20:01] have brought Malachi forward. You'd be
[1:20:03] cursed with a curse of never really
[1:20:05] knowing what's right.
[1:20:08] So, we thank God for the message. Amen.
[1:20:11] Praise be to God. All right.
[1:20:15] So, he says, "Now listen to this." And I
[1:20:18] like this.
[1:20:20] The gene of your life, the spiritual
[1:20:22] life tonight was in the God the Father
[1:20:24] before there was even a molecule.
[1:20:35] That's deep.
[1:20:37] That's deep. The gene of your life,
[1:20:43] the gene of you.
[1:20:47] Hello. How many believed you had to be a
[1:20:51] gene of God? We are God's genetics.
[1:20:58] No wonder we act like we do.
[1:21:02] Hallelujah.
[1:21:04] Glory.
[1:21:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:08] No wonder we don't just act a little bit
[1:21:11] like Jesus does.
[1:21:13] Amen. I'm sorry. If you don't like it,
[1:21:16] then just blame my jeans. It's in my
[1:21:18] jeans. And I'm not talking about my blue
[1:21:21] jeans cuz I ain't got very many of that.
[1:21:24] Amen. The jeans. We're the jean of God.
[1:21:28] Hallelujah. Aren't you glad that just
[1:21:30] that jean of your life? Praise be to
[1:21:33] God.
[1:21:35] You're nothing. Now listen, this is I
[1:21:37] love this. And you are and you are. I
[1:21:41] like when he tells us who we are cuz
[1:21:43] there's a whole lot of confusion out
[1:21:45] there about who people are. They don't
[1:21:47] know what in the world they are.
[1:21:50] Why? Because they're serving the God of
[1:21:52] Confucious.
[1:21:54] Confusion. God is not the God of
[1:21:56] confusion.
[1:21:58] You're nothing. You're nothing but the
[1:22:00] manifestation
[1:22:02] of the gene of life that was in God as a
[1:22:06] son of God. Now you are express.
[1:22:12] Woo. How many likes to express
[1:22:14] themselves? God loves to be expressed.
[1:22:17] He expressed himself when he came into
[1:22:19] the form of Jesus Christ. The Bible says
[1:22:22] that he was the express image of God.
[1:22:26] How many believes that you at the
[1:22:27] believer, you are expressing God to your
[1:22:32] world, to your community. We are the
[1:22:35] expression around Elton or Scottsville
[1:22:37] or wherever you are. We are the
[1:22:39] expression of God.
[1:22:43] Remember
[1:22:46] the token. If you have the token, it
[1:22:48] must be on display. People have got to
[1:22:51] be able to see that you've got the Holy
[1:22:54] Ghost. They've got to be able to see it.
[1:22:57] God help us that they can see more of
[1:22:59] the Holy Ghost in our lives. Got to be
[1:23:02] on display. Not just hid, not covered
[1:23:06] up.
[1:23:07] No. But shown plainly to the world. I'm
[1:23:10] a Christian. And they can tell by your
[1:23:12] works. Remember, a tree is known by the
[1:23:16] fruit that it bears.
[1:23:21] If you got two more hours, I want to
[1:23:23] talk about that. How you can know. Amen.
[1:23:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:30] Now, notice you are expressed
[1:23:33] after his word has come in you to light
[1:23:36] up this age. How many believe you're the
[1:23:38] light of this age?
[1:23:41] You are the light of the world. God help
[1:23:44] me. God help you to trim that wick a
[1:23:48] little more so that our wives can see
[1:23:51] the light of God in us. So our husbands
[1:23:53] can see the light of God in us. So our
[1:23:56] children can see the light of God in us.
[1:23:58] So our neighbors from the everybody can
[1:24:00] see the light of God in us. Lord, trim
[1:24:03] my lamp.
[1:24:04] [Applause]
[1:24:07] That's what we are called to do is to be
[1:24:09] light. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:13] And you are expressing God's life in you
[1:24:17] because you are a son or a daughter of
[1:24:19] God. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:28] All right.
[1:24:30] That
[1:24:32] I'm doing the last first quote last. So
[1:24:35] I was wondering where it got to. It's
[1:24:36] still up there at the first quote.
[1:24:39] Okay.
[1:24:40] Um, so he says
[1:24:43] you are expressing God's life in you
[1:24:46] because you're a son and daughter of
[1:24:47] God. Therefore, you get what I mean? He
[1:24:50] says you're sitting in this church
[1:24:52] tonight because your duty is to express
[1:24:56] God to this nation
[1:24:58] and to this people and to this
[1:25:01] neighborhood where you associate
[1:25:03] wherever you are. God knew that you
[1:25:06] would be here. Amen. And listen, we're
[1:25:09] washed. And when the water came, the
[1:25:12] washing of the water fell upon you. It
[1:25:15] was expressed in a being. Now you have
[1:25:17] fellowship with your father. See, just
[1:25:20] as you did with your earthly father.
[1:25:22] You're citizens of the king. Amen.
[1:25:25] You're his children, sons and daughters
[1:25:28] of God. Amen.
[1:25:33] Right now in the other dimension,
[1:25:37] there's Jesus somewhere sitting on that
[1:25:41] intercessory, that place of
[1:25:43] intercessory. How many knows in that
[1:25:45] realm and in that dimension, there's
[1:25:47] hosts of angels?
[1:25:50] Angels, mighty angels
[1:25:53] that if God says, "Go down to Sodom and
[1:25:55] destroy it," it goes down and destroys
[1:25:56] it. Hello
[1:25:59] If it says go flood the world, it goes
[1:26:02] down and it floods the world. Powerful
[1:26:04] angels
[1:26:05] under commission told by God to do
[1:26:08] mighty things.
[1:26:10] What it would be like to be an angel,
[1:26:12] but we're taught by the message in the
[1:26:14] hour that you and I have more authority
[1:26:17] than those angels. If you're in the
[1:26:20] place that you ought to be with God,
[1:26:21] then you have more authority than an
[1:26:23] angel. They are servants.
[1:26:26] You're a son. You're
[1:26:29] let me tell you them devils don't have
[1:26:30] no right. They better listen to what
[1:26:33] God's people say.
[1:26:35] Speak that word. Don't count it and
[1:26:37] it'll be storms will stop. Will stop
[1:26:43] will stop. Everything will stop
[1:26:47] and leave. May those things
[1:26:50] stop and leave anxiety.
[1:26:55] We've got the authority. We're sons and
[1:26:57] daughters of God.
[1:27:03] What a privilege. What a honor. What
[1:27:06] glory.
[1:27:08] That's glorious.
[1:27:10] That's the kind of glory I like to see.
[1:27:13] [Applause]
[1:27:15] Praise be to God.
[1:27:18] Amen.
[1:27:22] All right. Now
[1:27:24] take another turn.
[1:27:29] And this is a quote kind of picked up
[1:27:32] from where brother Bram talks about
[1:27:33] where we're going to go. Jesus says, "I
[1:27:35] go to prepare a place for you." And
[1:27:38] brother Brandham used this in a message
[1:27:40] called Things That Are To Be. And he
[1:27:42] said, "This is usually a sermon that we
[1:27:44] preach at a funeral." Brad isn't that
[1:27:47] right. I go to prepare a place for you
[1:27:49] that where I am, there ye may be also.
[1:27:53] Amen. And we want to come back with the
[1:27:54] rest of the 15 minutes we got
[1:27:58] and talk about what we're here for.
[1:28:00] Amen. But this will bring us into the
[1:28:03] thought of what we're here for. I'm
[1:28:06] telling you, this vest is just too hot.
[1:28:10] That air conditioner turned to good.
[1:28:12] We're going to have to have a fan.
[1:28:14] I thought, brother B, why do you try to
[1:28:16] dress nice? Why do I dress nice? Tell
[1:28:20] you why I dress nice. Cuz we are
[1:28:23] representatives of Jesus Christ. We are
[1:28:26] representing the greatest thing upon the
[1:28:28] face of the earth. Amen. I don't want
[1:28:31] Senator Rubio.
[1:28:33] Rubio, what is he? A state secretary of
[1:28:36] state. When he goes, he don't go
[1:28:38] slouchy. He don't look like that one. I
[1:28:41] guess I shouldn't call names.
[1:28:44] when some of those senators are supposed
[1:28:46] to dress right and they don't. They
[1:28:48] dress like some street thugs.
[1:28:50] But anyway,
[1:28:53] but it's hot up here. So, if you don't
[1:28:54] mind, listen to this. So, Jesus says, "I
[1:28:57] go to prepare a place that is to receive
[1:29:00] them shows there." He says that there is
[1:29:04] life after this life is ended. What a
[1:29:07] consolation that ought to give us all to
[1:29:09] know that after this life is over, there
[1:29:12] is a life that we go into.
[1:29:15] How many believe that? And as you get
[1:29:17] older, it becomes more of a reality to
[1:29:20] you. And as you begin to see days of
[1:29:23] your life growing close, then it begins
[1:29:26] to make you pack up closer. Amen. How
[1:29:29] many say that? That's right. Pack up
[1:29:31] closer. But I'm here to tell you, it
[1:29:33] better not just be for us. All folks
[1:29:35] pack it up closer. Amen. Every one of us
[1:29:37] better pack up a little closer. Amen.
[1:29:39] Because we're all going to meet him in
[1:29:41] the air. And you're either ready or
[1:29:42] you're not.
[1:29:45] And you begin to pack up closer getting
[1:29:47] ready for that great event. And here is
[1:29:50] something that caught my attention that
[1:29:52] took me to all this other stuff. He says
[1:29:54] that great event,
[1:29:57] things that are to be paragraph 23. He
[1:30:00] says it's continuing
[1:30:04] of this same life in another world.
[1:30:09] Another place.
[1:30:15] But the Bible says that death don't
[1:30:17] change our character, does it? Death
[1:30:20] don't change you. If you was to drop
[1:30:21] that right now, you would be what you
[1:30:24] are. Amen.
[1:30:28] you would be what you are.
[1:30:31] And I thought, my
[1:30:34] that's right.
[1:30:36] What we do when we cross over, he says,
[1:30:39] the only thing death does to you,
[1:30:42] Brother Bam says, it doesn't change you.
[1:30:44] It only changes your dwelling place.
[1:30:47] Amen. Amen.
[1:30:51] So if you've got bad things in your
[1:30:53] life, if you got bad habits in your
[1:30:55] life, you wouldn't want to drop dead
[1:30:57] right now,
[1:31:01] cuz that's what you'd be on the other
[1:31:02] side. If you're impure, you'd have
[1:31:05] impurities over there.
[1:31:09] But I'm going to say, if you've got the
[1:31:11] peace that passes understanding, you'd
[1:31:13] say, "Well, yeah, this is just what I
[1:31:15] was looking for.
[1:31:17] I don't know about you, but I'm looking
[1:31:19] for this body. This body that pulls you
[1:31:21] down and hinders you in every manner.
[1:31:24] Amen. One of these days it'll be
[1:31:25] changed. Amen. So that man don't never
[1:31:29] have to have a battle like Paul talked
[1:31:31] about. Now it's not two dogs fighting
[1:31:33] anymore. Amen. It's a white dog in a
[1:31:36] white body. Amen. No black dog around.
[1:31:39] We're looking forward to that.
[1:31:42] [Music]
[1:31:46] Amen.
[1:31:48] You would be exactly what you are now.
[1:31:51] If you're evil now, you'd be evil over
[1:31:53] there.
[1:31:55] If you'd have sin in your life, you'd be
[1:31:58] have sin life over there. And most
[1:32:00] likely, you wouldn't have a theophony
[1:32:02] body to go into. Amen.
[1:32:07] Woo. We're privileged people.
[1:32:09] We're privileged people.
[1:32:12] Amen. And so I want to acknowledge I
[1:32:13] want to tell you this. Whatever it is in
[1:32:16] your life, amen, that would keep you out
[1:32:19] of the kingdom, it's time to cut it off.
[1:32:23] It's time to do a little cutting. Amen.
[1:32:26] Stop this. If your phone, Amen, gives
[1:32:28] you trouble, get rid of the phone. If
[1:32:31] your job keeps you from the house of
[1:32:32] God, keep you from serving God, right?
[1:32:34] Get another job. Make way for God. Make
[1:32:38] room for God.
[1:32:42] Hello.
[1:32:44] Praise be to God. Whatever it is, could
[1:32:46] be anything. Whatever it is, you got to
[1:32:48] be as desperate as what Jesus said. You
[1:32:50] better be willing to cut your hand off
[1:32:53] if that's what it takes. Ready and
[1:32:55] willing to pluck your eye out.
[1:32:58] I'm serious about this thing. You got to
[1:33:00] be serious about this thing.
[1:33:05] Willing to do whatever it takes, but I
[1:33:08] won't let nothing stop me.
[1:33:11] Amen. I'm going to heaven. If my brother
[1:33:14] don't go, don't hinder me. Since it
[1:33:17] don't go, don't hinder me. Amen.
[1:33:21] But we will try to stop and pick him up.
[1:33:24] If my brother's in the way, we will try
[1:33:26] to stop and pick him up. Is that all
[1:33:28] right? Amen. But if the devil rolls
[1:33:30] around, we will roll right over him. We
[1:33:33] will roll right over him. We ain't going
[1:33:35] to pick that guy up.
[1:33:39] Hallelujah.
[1:33:42] Praise be to God.
[1:33:44] I thought my that is good.
[1:33:49] So, what's some of the requirements?
[1:33:51] What do you got to have? How do I know?
[1:33:54] How do I know I'm rapture ready,
[1:33:56] brother?
[1:33:58] How do I know? Well, a tree is known by
[1:34:02] its fruit.
[1:34:05] Amen. All
[1:34:08] [Applause]
[1:34:18] right.
[1:34:21] Now, let's get started.
[1:34:25] Have you got my title ready? Here's my
[1:34:28] title tonight.
[1:34:30] Amateur
[1:34:32] God. Oh, man. I messed up, Brother
[1:34:35] Tommy. I mess up here too. I was going
[1:34:37] to say, what is the other kind of gods
[1:34:39] that there is? What other kind of God is
[1:34:42] there
[1:34:44] besides the devil and besides God? You
[1:34:48] ought to have had you baffled, wouldn't
[1:34:49] I? You probably wouldn't have thought
[1:34:51] about that amateur god thing.
[1:34:54] But anyway, there you are. Amateur gods.
[1:35:00] Amen. See, but Bab says in Ephesians par
[1:35:03] parallels Joshua when he made man
[1:35:06] Jehovah he says what did that mean? I am
[1:35:09] the allexistent one who is created
[1:35:13] something off of myself to be a son of
[1:35:15] mine or a temporary or an amateur little
[1:35:19] one of mine. Oh glory. Why? He's a
[1:35:21] Jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[1:35:25] amateur god.
[1:35:28] Woo!
[1:35:30] Boy, we can got a 12 on that one. Think
[1:35:34] about it. God has made us to be amateur.
[1:35:37] Our little gods, brother Brad. We are
[1:35:40] little gods. Say, "I'm a little god."
[1:35:45] That's right.
[1:35:47] That's right. Joshua, when he said,
[1:35:49] "Son, stand still." And then stood
[1:35:52] still, he was an amateur dog. Why?
[1:35:55] because God come down and spoke through
[1:35:57] him. Hello. Moses creating fleas and
[1:36:02] everything. You'll be like God and Abram
[1:36:04] and uh Aaron will be your prophet. Is
[1:36:06] that what God told Moses? You be like
[1:36:09] God and he'll be like your prophet.
[1:36:13] Woo. Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:19] It's a pretty big word, isn't it? But
[1:36:22] this is the third part of my series on
[1:36:25] this that we're amateur or little gods
[1:36:30] because he is
[1:36:32] Papa God. He is father God.
[1:36:38] Woo. Let's rub that in the devil's face.
[1:36:41] Devil, you ain't nothing but a loser.
[1:36:43] That company was kicked out of heaven
[1:36:45] that all you can do is do what good God
[1:36:47] allows you to do. You can't even do
[1:36:50] anything without permission. Amen.
[1:36:52] You're just a loser. But we are born
[1:36:55] sons and daughters of God
[1:37:00] in our very
[1:37:03] us. It just makes us that way. It just
[1:37:05] gives us faith.
[1:37:09] If you want to know how you're supposed
[1:37:10] to be, look at Jesus life. He was a
[1:37:13] perfect example, wasn't he? He was the
[1:37:16] perfect example of the expression of
[1:37:19] what God was. He did nothing but what
[1:37:21] his father showed him first. God help
[1:37:23] us.
[1:37:28] Each one
[1:37:31] and I,
[1:37:33] brother Brad, listen close. Listen close
[1:37:35] every day. Listen to that voice. He'll
[1:37:39] give you messages. He'll talk to you.
[1:37:42] Amen.
[1:37:43] Just like that little thing there with
[1:37:46] with uh cut your hand off or and so
[1:37:49] forth. I never really understood it, but
[1:37:51] the Lord revealed that's just how
[1:37:52] serious God wants you to be about not
[1:37:54] missing it.
[1:37:56] Hello. Even your own life also. Whatever
[1:37:59] it takes, Lord.
[1:38:01] Amen.
[1:38:03] Okay. Praise the Lord. See, now God made
[1:38:07] man to be predominant over the earth. He
[1:38:10] had a dominion and the earth was man's
[1:38:13] dominion. That's right. Amen. If that's
[1:38:16] his domain, then he's God over the
[1:38:20] earth.
[1:38:22] How many believe that's what you was
[1:38:24] meant to be? Each and every one of you
[1:38:25] brothers, sisters,
[1:38:27] can you imagine being in heaven and I
[1:38:29] look, I want some of these kind of
[1:38:31] flowers. Brother Brad and y'all,
[1:38:33] brother, sister Joyce, y'all never going
[1:38:34] to have to do no pots and waters. No,
[1:38:37] it's just going to be by speaking of the
[1:38:38] word. Any one of us put our flower beds
[1:38:42] around just the way that we want. Build
[1:38:44] the house just the way we want. Amen.
[1:38:47] I'm going to tell you this right now.
[1:38:48] Hallelujah. Praise God. I mean, I won't
[1:38:50] have to know, hey, hold on and smash my
[1:38:53] thumb again and get it black and blue
[1:38:55] and lose my thumb again over there. No,
[1:38:57] it ain't going to be nothing like that.
[1:38:59] Hell, it ain't going to be nothing like
[1:39:01] climbing under that house and plumbing
[1:39:02] and having to have two fans on you just
[1:39:04] enough to burn up in this heat.
[1:39:08] Woo!
[1:39:09] will be able to say, "Come on, breeze. I
[1:39:12] could use a little breeze.
[1:39:15] 15 12 miles an hour."
[1:39:20] That's right. I feel like a heaven just
[1:39:24] just this way or that just that way.
[1:39:27] Hello.
[1:39:28] Speak the word.
[1:39:31] You know, the glorious part of it, we
[1:39:33] need to be practicing that over here.
[1:39:36] How many believes that we're just
[1:39:38] continuing this life over there? Like
[1:39:41] brother Brad, brother Brandon when he
[1:39:43] was that bull came, he says, you know,
[1:39:45] he spoke to him that love came down and
[1:39:47] he apologized to the bull. I'm sorry,
[1:39:50] bull. I have intruded upon your
[1:39:53] territory and you are only doing what
[1:39:55] God put in your genes to do. And that's
[1:39:57] to kill anybody that comes on your
[1:39:59] territory. You're the big bull.
[1:40:02] Big bad bull. But I'm a servant of God
[1:40:06] and I'm going to pray for one of his
[1:40:07] little ones. So stop and go back where
[1:40:11] you come from.
[1:40:13] Hello.
[1:40:15] And that love dropped down. He says he
[1:40:17] wasn't afraid of that bull more than
[1:40:18] anything.
[1:40:21] Before that, he's like every one of you
[1:40:23] and I should be. You know what that was?
[1:40:27] Well, if this is going to be my end,
[1:40:30] help me to go not a coward, but just as
[1:40:33] bravely as I can. Ain't that right? You
[1:40:35] was ready if this is how I'm going to
[1:40:36] go.
[1:40:41] Okay, honey.
[1:40:43] I'm not the only one that chuckles
[1:40:45] themselves sometimes. So, that's all
[1:40:47] right.
[1:40:53] Praise the Lord. All
[1:40:55] right, let's get back to this before we
[1:40:57] all end up doing
[1:41:00] All right. Praise the Lord. God is good,
[1:41:03] ain't he? God is good. Did I say
[1:41:05] something wrong or No, it's Yes, sir.
[1:41:09] All right. All right. Never know.
[1:41:11] Sometimes I say something and everybody
[1:41:13] after church says it was because you
[1:41:14] said this and I was like, I mean, it
[1:41:16] ain't no wonder.
[1:41:21] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:41:24] Thank you, brother Joe. Thank y'all for
[1:41:26] praying. I really appreciate the
[1:41:27] atmosphere and everything. It really
[1:41:28] makes all the difference in the world.
[1:41:30] It really does. And we pray that Amen.
[1:41:33] we'll just keep that up. Amen. Keep that
[1:41:34] atmosphere going. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:38] An amateur God.
[1:41:42] This is our domain.
[1:41:45] Then if that's his domain, he was God
[1:41:47] over the earth. He could speak and it
[1:41:48] would be so. He would speak this and it
[1:41:51] would be so. There he is. God Jehovah.
[1:41:54] How many knows we have that? We have got
[1:41:56] that waved over us. We have got that
[1:41:59] showed us. Did not. Brother Bram says,
[1:42:01] "I am your daddy, so to speak. I'm your
[1:42:03] father that I've be now. You don't call
[1:42:04] me that, but I'm your father that I've
[1:42:06] begotten you to the gospel." If we are
[1:42:08] children of the prophets, how many
[1:42:10] believe we ought to act like children of
[1:42:12] the prophet. We ought to be act like we
[1:42:14] ought to be able to speak. We ought to
[1:42:16] be be able to believe the way that he
[1:42:18] did.
[1:42:20] But how many knows this one thing that
[1:42:23] before you can be an adopted son and
[1:42:25] before you can speak some of this power
[1:42:27] without character is satanic.
[1:42:30] That's right. So how many believe that
[1:42:31] there's only one thing that you can take
[1:42:33] with you when you leave here and that is
[1:42:35] your character. And that character to
[1:42:38] make a long story short that character
[1:42:40] is molded by trials and tests, hard
[1:42:44] times, strugglings and pains.
[1:42:47] Amen.
[1:42:50] It comes to my mind. I'm just going to
[1:42:52] go ahead and say it. The Lord has
[1:42:54] blessed me and my wife. He has blessed
[1:42:56] me with allowing us to be a shepherd of
[1:42:59] this flock.
[1:43:02] People
[1:43:04] that's filled with the Holy Ghost. I
[1:43:06] thank God for every one of you. Amen.
[1:43:09] And then naturally speaking, giving us a
[1:43:11] farm out there way beyond what we could
[1:43:13] ever ask for. a nice 300 acre lake, a
[1:43:17] creek that goes right into it. The best
[1:43:19] hunting I could have ever asked for. 15
[1:43:22] point buck last year. Just really,
[1:43:24] really thankful for what God has given
[1:43:26] us. Getting to have our children out
[1:43:29] there, getting to that place and and
[1:43:31] we've went through so much. I've went
[1:43:32] through so much, Brother Brad, that I
[1:43:33] thought, you know, we've and I I don't
[1:43:35] have any animosity against anybody. I
[1:43:37] love everybody. I believe that if
[1:43:39] anybody did me wrong, I would love them
[1:43:40] and I would pray for them anyway. Amen.
[1:43:43] And I had gotten to the place, brothers
[1:43:44] and sisters, where I thought, well,
[1:43:45] maybe I kind of graduated from that.
[1:43:47] Maybe I don't have to deal with those
[1:43:49] trials. Maybe we don't have to do that
[1:43:51] anymore.
[1:43:54] We're getting in our golden years. I'm a
[1:43:57] terrible word to say. You know, they say
[1:43:59] you had the golden years or whatever.
[1:44:00] And we were I was just and so forth. And
[1:44:03] then and then as you know, Amen. When we
[1:44:06] went to the doctor, of course, then we
[1:44:09] faced the biggest
[1:44:13] test and trial of our life. It was worse
[1:44:16] than anything that we could have ever
[1:44:18] faced because it was a fight to the
[1:44:21] death. Hello. It was a life and death.
[1:44:24] We've never had a life and death
[1:44:25] situation.
[1:44:28] So, I realized that and I thought like,
[1:44:31] well, maybe this is some kind of a
[1:44:33] graduation test or something. This is
[1:44:36] you can't go any further. You can't go
[1:44:37] any harder than this is live or die.
[1:44:40] Sink or swim. This is this is somebody's
[1:44:43] something has to die.
[1:44:46] Amen. The devil like the doctor said to
[1:44:49] Donna, you know, and I and I thought
[1:44:52] about this here when I was thinking
[1:44:53] about this, how did the doctor says,
[1:44:54] "You're going to die of breast cancer."
[1:44:56] That was nothing short of what Goliath
[1:44:59] said to David. I'm gonna take you and
[1:45:01] unp my spear and I'm gonna feed you to
[1:45:03] the birds. There was nothing left in him
[1:45:06] saying you're gonna die and you're going
[1:45:07] to go in the grave. And then she replied
[1:45:09] with that's what you say.
[1:45:13] That's what she said. That's what you
[1:45:14] say. But my God, Amen. I come to you not
[1:45:18] with science, not with tests, not with
[1:45:21] looking at the screens, but I come to
[1:45:24] you in the name of the Lord by his
[1:45:26] stripes. I'm going to take your house.
[1:45:34] There was nothing short of it.
[1:45:36] Hallelujah.
[1:45:39] Glory. Praise be to God. Now, I'll be
[1:45:42] honest with you. A man is what he is
[1:45:46] under pressure. How many believes that?
[1:45:49] Isn't that what the prophet thought? Put
[1:45:51] a man under pressure and you'll see what
[1:45:53] he really is.
[1:45:58] So, my thought tonight is that if you
[1:46:02] want to know whether you're ready to go
[1:46:04] or not, look at yourself and how you
[1:46:07] react under pressure. What do you do
[1:46:11] when you're under that kind of pressure?
[1:46:13] That's right.
[1:46:15] Amen.
[1:46:17] Trials of any kind, whatever comes your
[1:46:21] way.
[1:46:23] How many knows that's what God is doing
[1:46:26] to us? He is molding us and shaping us
[1:46:30] and molding our character.
[1:46:35] God help me
[1:46:38] cuz you just never know. You never know
[1:46:40] what's coming next. Right? But remember
[1:46:44] this folks, if you really want to know
[1:46:46] if you love God and you're in a place
[1:46:49] where you're rapture ready, and that is,
[1:46:52] and I'm going to I'm going to Can I say
[1:46:54] it the way Jesus,
[1:47:09] he says, I say unto you, you. No, you
[1:47:13] have heard that it has been said, an eye
[1:47:15] for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But
[1:47:19] I say unto you that you resist not evil,
[1:47:22] but whosoever shall smite thee on the
[1:47:23] right cheek, turn to him the other also.
[1:47:28] How many know these are all trials?
[1:47:30] These are all tests. These things are
[1:47:32] not easy to do.
[1:47:34] When somebody maybe not literally smacks
[1:47:37] you, but somebody does you wrong,
[1:47:42] The first thing as a carnal human being
[1:47:46] is for you to say, "I'll get back at
[1:47:48] him." Amen. I'll get back at him. I'll
[1:47:50] get him.
[1:47:54] Test number one.
[1:48:00] Turn to him the other. Can you not have
[1:48:04] any bitterness in your heart?
[1:48:09] If any man sue you at the law and take
[1:48:11] away thy coat, can you give him your
[1:48:13] cloak also?
[1:48:15] If somebody compels thee to go a mile,
[1:48:17] will you go with him the extra mile?
[1:48:20] Give to him that askstth from uh uh that
[1:48:23] would borrow from thee, and turn him not
[1:48:25] away. Ye have heard that it has been
[1:48:28] said, thou shalt love thy neighbor and
[1:48:29] hate thine enemy. But I say to you, love
[1:48:32] your enemies, and bless them that curse
[1:48:34] you.
[1:48:36] Amen.
[1:48:43] Do good to them that hate you. Wow.
[1:48:46] Remember this, folks. This is not This
[1:48:49] cannot be put on.
[1:48:53] I believe that you have to have it in
[1:48:56] your heart.
[1:48:58] It's got to be there cuz he isn't going
[1:49:00] to come to get somebody that just says,
[1:49:02] "Well, I I know I I really want to, but
[1:49:05] I know I can't." Uh-uh. You didn't pass
[1:49:07] the test. He's not coming for those that
[1:49:10] have it in their heart yet to do it.
[1:49:15] Do good them that hate you, and pray for
[1:49:17] them that despitefully use you, and
[1:49:19] persecute you,
[1:49:22] that ye may be the children of your
[1:49:24] father, which is in heaven. For he
[1:49:26] maketh the son to rise on the evil and
[1:49:28] on the good, sendeth rain on the just
[1:49:30] and the unjust.
[1:49:33] For if you love them which love you, you
[1:49:35] have to say you're the same as everybody
[1:49:36] else.
[1:49:38] And if you sleep, church salute your
[1:49:40] brethren also. A that's the way the
[1:49:42] others do too. Do not even the publicans
[1:49:44] the same. Be ye therefore perfect.
[1:49:52] When the perfect storm comes,
[1:49:56] can you have calm in the middle of the
[1:49:59] storm?
[1:50:00] How many knows that God is the eye of
[1:50:03] the storm for me? He is the eye of the
[1:50:05] storm. There can be calm
[1:50:09] in the middle of the storm.
[1:50:12] Trust me, when I heard this and when I
[1:50:14] dealt with this, I was knocked off my
[1:50:17] feet. And it took me weeks
[1:50:19] of prayer and finding the right thought.
[1:50:23] Hello. Saying, "God, how do I deal with
[1:50:25] this?" And by God's grace, he helped me
[1:50:28] to find the right thought.
[1:50:30] Amen. Cuz I felt like my wife already
[1:50:32] had it. I needed to get the right
[1:50:34] thought. And that is we're in God's
[1:50:36] hands.
[1:50:39] Fear. Go ahead and get out of here. You
[1:50:42] have no idea. Well, until you've
[1:50:45] experienced it of what the thought the
[1:50:47] how the devil will put thoughts in your
[1:50:49] mind. Okay. Well, you're going to bury
[1:50:52] her out here. We're going to have a
[1:50:53] funeral here. This that or the other. Oh
[1:50:55] my. You get weak and you just Oh, man.
[1:50:58] the throttle down
[1:51:01] and I had to smack myself. Get a hold of
[1:51:04] yourself.
[1:51:08] Hello. She's not going to die. She's
[1:51:11] going to live
[1:51:14] now. Quit thinking that. Quit thinking
[1:51:16] those thoughts. That's what the devil
[1:51:18] wants you to think. Amen. No doubt,
[1:51:20] Brother Russell. I don't know what he's
[1:51:22] thinking, but I want to encourage him.
[1:51:25] Think thoughts of faith.
[1:51:27] Amen. Cuz we're believing with him.
[1:51:30] Amen. He's going to be all right,
[1:51:32] Brother Austin. We're going to God. God
[1:51:34] is going to whip it. We aren't. God is
[1:51:36] going to whip it cuz he more than able.
[1:51:40] How many believe that? And we believe
[1:51:42] that it's already done. We just have to
[1:51:43] accept it and receive it. That's right.
[1:51:46] Say, "It's mine. It's mine."
[1:51:50] Amen. Amen. My prayer is
[1:51:54] every one of you,
[1:51:56] don't let anything set you.
[1:52:01] Don't let anything
[1:52:04] be not uh soon shaken. Don't be shaken.
[1:52:08] Be steadfast
[1:52:10] no matter what happens cuz this is a
[1:52:12] rocking world. Amen.
[1:52:17] And if you notice,
[1:52:21] if you notice,
[1:52:29] Brother Brandham talked about cutting
[1:52:30] things off. He talked about going beyond
[1:52:32] the curtain of time.
[1:52:34] How many remembers that?
[1:52:40] And what he seen those people over there
[1:52:44] and he says, "Oh my precious friend, my
[1:52:46] beloved, my darlings of the gospel, my
[1:52:49] begotten children unto God."
[1:52:54] 1960, he says, "My, listen to me, your
[1:52:57] pastor. I wish there was some way I
[1:53:00] could explain it to you. There's no
[1:53:02] words. I couldn't find it. It's not
[1:53:04] found anywhere. But just beyond that
[1:53:07] last breath is the most glorious thing
[1:53:09] that you've ever There is no way to
[1:53:12] explain it.
[1:53:15] There's no way. I just can't do it. But
[1:53:18] whatever you do, friends, I said, he
[1:53:21] said, "Lay aside,
[1:53:24] huh? Lay aside everything else." In
[1:53:29] other words, cut out everything else
[1:53:32] until you get perfect love.
[1:53:38] How many knows perfect love for God
[1:53:40] casts out all fear?
[1:53:43] Anytimes cancer, anything happens, the
[1:53:45] first thing that hits you is fear,
[1:53:47] doubt, negativity.
[1:53:51] But love God. And many times brother
[1:53:54] talked about if you have cancer, if you
[1:53:55] get any things, the important thing is
[1:53:57] just to love God.
[1:53:59] said, "Love God." Why? Cuz that'll cast
[1:54:01] that thing out. How many believe casts
[1:54:04] out fear?
[1:54:07] Get perfect love. Get to that spot that
[1:54:09] you can love everybody, every enemy,
[1:54:12] everything else. Amen.
[1:54:15] Thus sayaith the Lord, it'll take
[1:54:18] perfect love to put you in that place.
[1:54:22] Amen. How many knows that you cannot
[1:54:25] know whether you have perfect love until
[1:54:30] you get tested?
[1:54:33] How many knows? You want to know what
[1:54:34] kind of blood you have yet? You got to
[1:54:36] get tested. Let us run some tests. Let's
[1:54:38] run some tests.
[1:54:40] You want to know if a tree has good
[1:54:42] roots?
[1:54:44] Let's see a side wind.
[1:54:47] How many knows going down to Florida and
[1:54:49] that big hurricane and and around here
[1:54:52] going home sometimes after a tornado
[1:54:54] comes through trees everywhere uprooted
[1:54:56] up on their sides.
[1:54:59] Well, that tree wasn't strong enough.
[1:55:01] And that's about like it is Christian
[1:55:03] nowadays. Here's one in the ditch.
[1:55:05] Here's one over here on this side here.
[1:55:07] Everybody blowing around because winds.
[1:55:10] Hello.
[1:55:13] But I believe I'm believe in that tree
[1:55:15] who's got their roots deep.
[1:55:18] The winds blow. They're coming sideways.
[1:55:22] It's hard. But hallelujah. That root is
[1:55:27] holding. It won't let me flop over. It
[1:55:30] won't let me go. Why? Cuz you're rooted
[1:55:32] and grounded.
[1:55:35] The only way you'll know if you'll stand
[1:55:37] is to have a wind. So don't be so afraid
[1:55:40] of the winds.
[1:55:46] Brother Bryant,
[1:55:48] all of us that are getting older, we've
[1:55:50] got that big wind ahead of us called
[1:55:52] death.
[1:55:53] That's right. That's one of the facts of
[1:55:56] life is that we're going to get old.
[1:55:59] We're going to shrivel up. Brother Bram
[1:56:01] says, "And if time carries, the rapture
[1:56:04] doesn't come, we're going to die."
[1:56:07] Hello. It's a simple fact of life. But I
[1:56:10] am so glad that there's another fact of
[1:56:12] life, brother Brad. That is that we can
[1:56:14] have a savior to know. Amen. That we
[1:56:16] don't have to worry about judgment. We
[1:56:18] don't have to worry about death. We
[1:56:19] don't have to worry about the grave. Cuz
[1:56:21] we've already been shown that beyond
[1:56:23] that last breath.
[1:56:26] Amen. That really when we're dying, we
[1:56:29] ought to be happy about it. Lord, boy,
[1:56:32] that sounds crazy, don't it, brother
[1:56:33] John? We ought to be happy about it.
[1:56:38] Come on people. I've got a quote for
[1:56:41] you.
[1:56:43] Who was it? One of those one of those I
[1:56:45] forget his name now, but he's remember
[1:56:48] he said he says, "Who's dying here?" He
[1:56:51] says, "Who's dying? Me or you?" Couldn't
[1:56:53] sing in them old slow. Oh my. You know
[1:56:57] songs. Amen. And they got the choir got
[1:57:00] a giddy up song. Oh, drap
[1:57:03] my savior. open up the windows this air
[1:57:06] and come do give me some rejoicing here.
[1:57:09] Brother Bosworth, remember what he said?
[1:57:13] What he said? Brother B says, "But
[1:57:14] brother Bosworth, you're dying." He
[1:57:16] said, "No, I'm not dying. I'm just going
[1:57:18] home." But B says, Brother Bam knew just
[1:57:20] what to ask, what questions to ask. He
[1:57:22] says, "What was the best time of your
[1:57:24] life?" When everybody was roaring,
[1:57:27] whenever he had a great service and all
[1:57:28] this ever, maybe he people were healed.
[1:57:31] Maybe a lame person ran ran wondering
[1:57:33] around. You know what would your
[1:57:35] greatest time? What did he say?
[1:57:39] Right now. Right now.
[1:57:43] How many believe that if you really have
[1:57:45] faith when that wind comes when you're
[1:57:47] ripped ready with God? I believe that's
[1:57:50] the way you can be.
[1:57:52] That's the way we can we can be. We
[1:57:54] don't have to be scared. We can say like
[1:57:56] Paul, your stinger,
[1:57:59] the sting of death. Amen. the scariness
[1:58:03] of death. Oh death, where's your sting?
[1:58:06] Oh grave, where is your victory? But I
[1:58:09] thank God who gives us the victory
[1:58:10] through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1:58:13] Hallelujah. How many glad for that
[1:58:14] victory?
[1:58:19] [Applause]
[1:58:20] Amen.
[1:58:27] I guess the core of the thought tonight
[1:58:28] was how do we know
[1:58:32] if you're ready? All I can tell you is
[1:58:34] if you match this right here, if you've
[1:58:36] got that perfect love,
[1:58:42] and you stand in the middle of the
[1:58:44] storm, hello, and you trust in God, he
[1:58:47] is your anchor. It's a good sign.
[1:58:51] Brother Brandham also said talking about
[1:58:54] the token
[1:58:55] he says but in this glorious place under
[1:58:58] this covenant there's a difference
[1:58:59] between the blood and the life the token
[1:59:01] for the believer and he was talking
[1:59:02] about putting that blood on the lentil
[1:59:04] of the door and on the post he says it's
[1:59:07] not the blood chemistry but it's the
[1:59:09] holy spirit of god how many believes in
[1:59:11] this hour he said it's not about the
[1:59:13] chemistry of the blood
[1:59:15] it's not even you believing about the
[1:59:17] chemistry of the blood
[1:59:19] amen Man, it's not about you saying, "I
[1:59:22] believe what he did on Calvary." You
[1:59:24] have to do that. But there's a lot of
[1:59:26] people that say that, but they don't get
[1:59:29] what they're supposed to get from
[1:59:31] believing that. How many knows what
[1:59:33] you're supposed to get from believing
[1:59:34] that? The Holy Ghost. Abraham says, "If
[1:59:38] you really genuinely believe with all of
[1:59:40] your heart, God is obligated to give you
[1:59:42] the Holy Ghost sitting in your seat."
[1:59:45] Well, I don't know if he said sitting in
[1:59:46] your seat, but anyway, I say sitting in
[1:59:48] your seat right there. right where you
[1:59:50] are, God is obligate. He will give you
[1:59:52] the Holy Ghost if you really believe it
[1:59:53] with all your heart. And he said the
[1:59:56] evidence that God has accepted your
[1:59:58] sacrifice, the evidence that you really
[2:00:00] had faith in that is when you're
[2:00:03] circumcised
[2:00:04] and that is given the baptism of the
[2:00:07] Holy Ghost.
[2:00:09] Amen. Praise the Lord. And listen what
[2:00:12] he says. And today, it's not the
[2:00:14] chemistry that God is looking for. this
[2:00:16] token that God requires of the church
[2:00:19] today. God must see this token. He must
[2:00:23] see it in every one of us.
[2:00:26] Therefore, in these evening shadows as
[2:00:28] he's appearing and the wrath is ready to
[2:00:30] be poured out upon high upon the ungodly
[2:00:33] nations, upon the ungodly unbelievers
[2:00:35] and a lot of ungodliness in there. Boy,
[2:00:37] he's about right, ain't he? Professors
[2:00:40] without a possession. As I've tried to
[2:00:42] unfold myself now, we are living in the
[2:00:44] shadows to wrath that is ready to
[2:00:45] strike. God's requiring a token that you
[2:00:48] yourself have received this token, the
[2:00:50] Holy Ghost. It's the only way. It's the
[2:00:53] only sign that God will ever pass
[2:00:56] because it is the literal life of Jesus
[2:00:58] Christ returned back on the lever. How
[2:01:02] many's glad that you can have not just a
[2:01:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost, not just some
[2:01:06] formal ritual of something, but the very
[2:01:10] life of Jesus Christ,
[2:01:13] the very life of God.
[2:01:15] You won't go outside of that. You won't
[2:01:19] go in the rapture outside of that. Amen.
[2:01:25] There again, he said, "Amen. It must be
[2:01:29] upon each one of us." Praise the Lord.
[2:01:32] All right. 15 minutes long. Is that
[2:01:35] okay?
[2:01:37] We're going to stop right there.
[2:01:41] You love the Lord.
[2:01:45] I can't but just say one more thing.
[2:01:48] Stand with me.
[2:01:52] My heart's yearning, my heart's desire
[2:01:55] is for everybody that is in here and for
[2:01:58] those that are streaming
[2:02:00] that'll hear this
[2:02:02] that you will look
[2:02:05] and be a fruit inspector.
[2:02:09] Search yourself. Search your heart. see
[2:02:12] if you're in love with God the way that
[2:02:14] you should be. And see if the character
[2:02:18] of Jesus Christ is in your heart
[2:02:22] because see really you can only be a
[2:02:25] judge of yourself. You know better than
[2:02:26] everybody else. We can fool everybody
[2:02:28] else. But you got to be honest with
[2:02:30] yourself and say if you're not this
[2:02:34] evening
[2:02:36] and you want to see more of the
[2:02:37] character of Jesus Christ in your life
[2:02:41] and say God I must have it cuz that's
[2:02:44] the only thing I can take with me is the
[2:02:47] character the kind of person that I am
[2:02:49] and that doesn't always come easy. How
[2:02:51] many know is it made and molded by
[2:02:54] sufferings and trials and things that
[2:02:55] come our way?
[2:02:57] God, I raise my hand. I want to be ready
[2:03:00] for that rapture. And tonight, God, I
[2:03:02] pray that you will cut off, cut out of
[2:03:05] my life anything that is a hindrance to
[2:03:09] your Holy Spirit. Any disobedience in my
[2:03:13] life, I ask God that you help me to come
[2:03:15] into full obedience to your word. That
[2:03:18] is my heart's desire, Lord. We want to
[2:03:21] be sons and daughters of God that are
[2:03:24] fit to rule, that have the character of
[2:03:26] Christ in their life. Lord, forgive us
[2:03:28] of where we're not.
[2:03:31] Lord, help us as we take these few
[2:03:33] moments to raise our hands to you and
[2:03:36] say, "God,
[2:03:40] show me.
[2:03:42] Show me if there's any area in my life
[2:03:45] that I'm still blind
[2:03:47] that I still haven't given you the room
[2:03:50] that you should have and that you
[2:03:51] desire. I raise my hands now and say,
[2:03:54] "God, show me. Show me. Show me."
[2:03:56] Father, I do want don't want to deceive
[2:03:59] myself. I don't want to fool myself. I
[2:04:01] want to be honest with you. And when you
[2:04:03] talk to my heart and you tell me what it
[2:04:06] is, God, that I need to cut off, what I
[2:04:09] need to change in my life to get closer
[2:04:11] to you and to be more like you, I will
[2:04:13] be obedient. I will obey what you say.
[2:04:16] God, bless every heart, every mind that
[2:04:18] is asking this of you. So that father,
[2:04:24] if you come tomorrow morning between
[2:04:26] 6:00 and 9, everything will be right in
[2:04:29] our hearts, in our lives. We want to be
[2:04:32] ready because we could come any time,
[2:04:33] Lord.
[2:04:35] And we truly do believe that we're sons
[2:04:37] and daughters of yours. Help us, Lord,
[2:04:40] to humbly, Lord, live a life that is
[2:04:43] worthy of the gospel of Christ in Jesus
[2:04:45] name. Amen.
[2:04:48] And amen. You love him. Turn it over,
[2:04:52] David. God bless you. Amen. Love you

[2:05:07] preaching. I tell you, that's pretty
[2:05:09] good to me tonight.
[2:05:11] Let's give the Lord a hand tonight.

[2:06:27] burdens down.
[2:06:31] Amen. You love him with all your heart.
[2:06:33] And Amen. And uh I've got a prayer
[2:06:37] request. I actually forgot to write it
[2:06:40] down tonight. And I'm going to have
[2:06:41] brother Brad come and dismiss the
[2:06:43] service tonight. remember this and my
[2:06:45] daughter uh called me and there's a
[2:06:49] young girl it's a friend of it's one of
[2:06:51] her best friends her daughter she's 16
[2:06:54] year 15 years old her name is Ocean
[2:06:57] Moore she tried to commit suicide
[2:07:01] and uh
[2:07:03] she's been on depression medicine for
[2:07:05] quite some time I guess and I thought 15
[2:07:10] years old and already on depression
[2:07:11] medicine
[2:07:13] And I began to talk to Jennifer about
[2:07:15] her and and she said that the girl asked
[2:07:18] to be homeschooled a couple years ago.
[2:07:20] And I said, "Well, what happened?" She
[2:07:22] said, "Dad, I don't know. She's been
[2:07:24] cutting herself and burning herself and
[2:07:26] then she tried to OD on the drugs and
[2:07:29] and her mother, mom and dad just really
[2:07:32] I don't know how they would be cuz I've
[2:07:34] never had to deal with that." But I
[2:07:36] asked you tonight to pray for him and
[2:07:38] pray for her and and her name is Ocean.
[2:07:41] And uh we're just going to ask brother
[2:07:43] Brad to come and dismiss us and take
[2:07:44] this knee to the Lord in prayer tonight.
[2:07:46] Brother Brad,
[2:07:51] let's just bow our hearts this evening.
[2:07:53] Lord,
[2:07:55] heavenly father, we come before you,
[2:07:57] Lord.
[2:07:59] No doubt we've heard from you tonight,
[2:08:01] Lord. We felt your presence from the
[2:08:03] moment we stepped into the building
[2:08:04] tonight. And Lord, we've heard the
[2:08:08] overcoming words. We've heard words of
[2:08:10] inspiration and motivation. Words that
[2:08:12] gets us ready to make sure our lives
[2:08:15] line up with what you would have us to
[2:08:16] be. Lord Lord, you hear the the sincere
[2:08:20] need tonight, Lord. This such a serious
[2:08:22] situation, just a young lady, 15 years
[2:08:24] old, and the devil is torturing her,
[2:08:28] tormenting her. And but Lord, we know
[2:08:32] that you care.
[2:08:34] There was a maniac that was across the
[2:08:37] sea, a raging sea, who was in the tombs.
[2:08:40] And the prophet said he was so strong he
[2:08:42] could pick up those tombs, those
[2:08:44] tombstones, and throw them. And he was
[2:08:46] cutting himself with the stones and and
[2:08:49] just butchering himself.
[2:08:52] But you cared, Lord. You went across the
[2:08:55] rag and sea, not not to impress the
[2:08:58] people, not to show the multitudes or to
[2:09:00] reach out to the many, but you went for
[2:09:02] one. And Father, we ask that you would
[2:09:05] just go to this young lady tonight. We
[2:09:06] don't know her situation. We don't know
[2:09:08] what depresses her, what gives her the
[2:09:10] the panic and the anxiety and the fear
[2:09:12] of this world, but Lord, you do. So
[2:09:15] Lord, we just co commit to you tonight,
[2:09:18] Lord, and commission you, Lord, that you
[2:09:20] would just go and and touch her tonight,
[2:09:22] Lord, that you would minister to her,
[2:09:24] that you would just give her peace and
[2:09:25] you will give her mo more than anything
[2:09:27] deliverance and let her know, Father,
[2:09:30] that you are a loving, all powerful God,
[2:09:33] and that the blood is still wet on
[2:09:34] Calvary and that you can be there for
[2:09:37] her, Lord, and heal her body of this
[2:09:39] mental disease, Lord. Lord, we just
[2:09:42] thank you for the service we've had
[2:09:43] tonight, Lord. And we thank you for
[2:09:45] everybody that's made an effort to come
[2:09:46] out. And we just ask, Lord, as we
[2:09:48] dismiss this service that you'll go with
[2:09:50] each and every one of us, Lord, that
[2:09:52] you'll just have your guardian angels
[2:09:54] and compass about us as we travel and go
[2:09:57] go our separate ways. Be with us through
[2:09:59] the remainder of the week. And Lord,
[2:10:02] bring us back at your appointed time on
[2:10:03] Sunday. Be with Brother Ben as he
[2:10:05] prepares for the service and you know
[2:10:07] the needs that we'll have this weekend.
[2:10:09] and speak to his heart in the days to
[2:10:11] come that he could minister the word to
[2:10:13] us. We love you Lord. We give you honor,
[2:10:15] praise, and glory for all that you do in
[2:10:17] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:10:21] With me. If Jesus goes with God bless
[2:10:25] you, I'll go
[2:10:29] anywhere.
[2:10:34] Oh, it's heaven to
