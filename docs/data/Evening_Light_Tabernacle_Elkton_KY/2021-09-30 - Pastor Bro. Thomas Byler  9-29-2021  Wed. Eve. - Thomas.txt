everybody that's feeling good amen and believe those that are sick the lord will bring them out so god bless you tonight amen and so let's just bow our heads lord jesus once again father as we approach your word as we approach your throne lord we realize father it's a very serious thing lord and we're not just to hear father to be heard or to say something we would want to say but we're here father to hear from you and see what you would have us to speak and what you'd want us to hear and how you would want to move and just what you'd want to do father and help us to speak a word that would be in season father lord what we have need of hearing today lord jesus we just surrender ourselves see asking god that you'll speak to your people tonight the word lord jesus that you once spoken father as we open your word and father just read and believe god that those things that you've laid upon our heart to speak on is of you we pray lord that you just bless us anoint us now lord and we do pray for all those that are not feeling well bless them lord jesus those traveling and different things we ask for your blessing upon them lord and each one here father we ask god that you bless every heart here also lord with us touch from you lord jesus a special lord voice a little word god that you would speak to our hearts that we would know that it's you speaking to us because only you know what's in our hearts lord what we think and what we have need of blessed now we ask in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen i was just praying and seeing what the lord would have uh just what he'd want us to speak and i know it's always appreciated whenever you can amen have the lord lay something on your heart that you know people will come to you and just say things like you know that i really needed that that was just for me you know and so i mean a timely message is always what we want especially in this late hour and you know we we need that we need that this week we'll need that next week we'll need that next month amen we'll need to the lord for to keep speaking to our hearts the moment until he until we see him in person amen how many for looking forward to seeing him in person amen so we feel him we know he's in our hearts he speaks to us in that way but one of these days amen we're going to see him face to face so we're thankful for that amen so if you will let's turn there's just two scriptures that came to my mind and i thought well you've preached on that before but uh you know i said you lord if you have something different but that just popped right back into my heart and mine and i said okay well if that's the direction you want us to go we'll go there amen amen so we want to and and basically what i feel like is this is something that this is a message that the lord jesus himself tells us and gives to us a warning that he gives us in this hour in the hour in which you are and i are living amen so we're going to revelations 19 revelations 19 two scriptures that we want to begin with amen realize the more that i study this more deep it really is amen and so we'll probably just touch touch the tops of it a little bit revelations 19 amen i certainly like certainly like the book of revelation don't you especially since we've had a prophet to come and give us the interpretation of it amen uh and so we're so thankful for that but in revelations 19 and down in verse 6 it says and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude amen now this reason i read verse 6 is because amen this voice that he heard was through this multitude and it also ties into verse 7 and what it says and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth notice what this voice says and i let us be glad and rejoice amen let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints amen and he says unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god amen now over in matthew the other scripture that came to me was in matthew and this is jesus message to you and to me certainly relevant for our day for our hour and for what we do from one week to another amen what we are doing amen now notice it says in verse 42 and i'm going to go back and pick this up the whole the whole thought of the whole thing but we want to just read this scripture just to let you be seated chapter chapter 24 verse 42. he says watch therefore for you know not the hour that your lord must come but know this that if the goodman of the house would have known and what watched a thief would come he would have watched and would have not suffered his house to be broken up therefore be now notice that ready work the bride has made herself ready jesus tells us here therefore be ye also ready amen amen so that's our message from the lord tonight is be ready be ready be ready that's the most important thing he said amen for in such an hour as you think not son of man cometh amen so may god has blessings to reading the word you can be seated i want to go back a little bit first of all i want to read a little bit more but let's go get a little bit more of a background to this to this before we uh basically go into it go back to verse 29 now this is we know that there was three questions asked jesus when shall when shall what was it the question anymore he says tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and he goes to talking about how there's going to be wars and destructions and earthquakes and but he says don't fear the end is not yet you know and he talks about pestilence earthquakes and all the different things that happened because he knew that all these things were going to happen over a 2000 year period but down in verse 29 i believe the prophet god brought it and it brought it into perspective he got to talking about being the tribulation period amen in verse 29 on immediately after tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall be gathered them his elect from the four winds from one hand of heaven to the other i do not know the exact interpretation of this but i do know that angels are messengers isn't that right amen and there's a gathering together whether where the carcass is there the eagles gather together amen with prophet went across the earth what seven times all the way around seven times gathering that bride out of that uh out of that church isn't that right come out of her and so forth amen gathering together from one end of the heaven now he says now learn the parable of the fig tree and we know that's israel right that's israel when his branch is yet tender and put it forth his leaves you know that summer is nigh amen so whenever we see them become a nation so likewise ye when you shall see all these things that know that it is near even at the doors verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away amen we can stop there and preach about four months right amen that one thing you can count on is that when god says something it's gonna come to pass amen there isn't there isn't enough powers in all of hell to try to stop god from fulfilling his word amen but of the day and the hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only amen so the coming of the lord is going to be a secret the coming of the lord is going to happen in a day and an hour that people are not expecting amen it's going to happen suddenly it's going to for we know that to the earth and to the people of the world it's going to they won't even realize when the rapture takes place because only that any christ shall rise first they won't know until the tribulation period sets in and so forth because he says he comes as a thief in the night to take his bride away two shall be in the field two shall be take one shall be taken amen let me just read it but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as in the days of that noah before the flood they were eating and drinking they were marrying and giving in marriage amen until the day that noah entered into the ark and they knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the son of may coming of the son of man be amen two shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other one left two shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other one left amen we know that there's people going to just come up missing and of course we know that thousands come up missing every day amen and it's not going to be a big deal it's not going to be like denominations and people think skies you know jets are going to drop out of the skies and trains are going to derail and oh there's going to be big traffic jams and all this because of all the people that are going no that's not going to be like that it's going to be a very few jesus says even he says if i don't hasten my coming no flesh will be saved well i even find for faith when i come on the earth and we realize we're living in that time where people are you know people live that don't have it on the inside of the inside of the inside sooner or later they just wither away amen amen and they just the people are losing faith you have to have that anchor way down on the inside okay so we see here that eating and drinking building and so forth everything was going on just like normal until that day that it happens amen so it says then two will be taken and so forth but now notice and he says two but be taken now notice as he says jesus tells them something i like it he says now watch i like that because we want to speak on tonight if you're wondering what the title is the title is be ready being ready we're going to talk about how to be ready what it's going to take to be ready amen that's what you and i are doing every day every week you know what we're doing that's what we're doing here tonight that's what we focus on is to be ready for that hour because we don't want that hour to take us unawares i don't believe that he's gonna take the bride of jesus christ unawares no because we're awake and we're watching amen and we are not gonna be we're gonna not gonna suffer our house to be broken up amen so i believe i believe it's time to get our get things ready don't you so he says watch therefore for ye no not that hour that the lord does come no we don't know it either but we can sure see the signs of the time we can watch around us and we can know in what watch we are and we knowing what watched christ will come so there he says stuff goes on so now notice he says who then for you know be also ready for such an hour to take nixon a man cometh that's verse 44. who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord has made ruler over his household to give him meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing amen doing what doing what god wants you to be doing we're watching waiting being ready for his coming looking for his coming any day amen if he doesn't come yet tonight we'll look for him tomorrow if it'll come the next it will come the next day because things are things are winding down folks how many please your things are winding down things are coming to a close very rapidly amen praise be to god hallelujah things are fixing to close up here folks it's choice it's great this thing isn't going to continue on like this amen um i didn't don't have the quote but i believe it in the in future uh invisible union brother bam says you know the world the whole world is fixing to go into complete insanity he says you see the footprints of it now but it's going to happen where the whole world goes into complete insanity welcome to the insane institution that's where we are folks hello everybody out there you are living in an insane world people who have lost their minds completely they've already done it they're already down the highest of our politicians have lost their mind that's exactly right we're living there now prophet prophesied it and it's here people don't even know what gender they are they don't even know where don't even know if you're a man or a woman amen like what our brother said you know go out there up there to the tree if you got to use the bathroom identify the dog that's insanity okay to have a man going into a woman's bathroom is insanity all right well don't get me started but anyway so be ready right blessed as that servant with his lord amen when he comes he'll find him watching and waking waiting verily i say unto you he shall make him ruler over all his goods do you think that god wants these people that are up in office now ruling his kingdom in heaven no not even close no they won't never beat around they're not going to be there they'll be putting the lake of fire yeah that's right where god destroys them why because god offered a mercy god come and vindicated and prove that it was him and they turned it down i brought malachi 4 right out of the hills of kentucky the greatest prophet ever and they turned him down kicked him out yeah you know they know that ain't nobody can dispute that ain't nobody can dispute it proven over and over and over again you know i was listening to the bible i'm listening to the whole bible here at genesis and i was just listening and listening and listening and i was listening where where moses went out there and god commissioned moses to go down to his people and he says you know how they who do i say that sentiment they're not going to believe me he says well what is that that's got in your hand throw that stick down it turns to a snake and so forth he says he says now he says if they won't believe the first sign put your hand in your body they'll become leprous amen and then they'll put it in again and go away if they don't believe the first sign they'll believe the second one huh how many signs did god do in this generation people still don't believe it multiple over and over and over and over and over again they still won't believe it it's sad ain't it amen all right so he says here now but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart the lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and to drink with the drunken i'd like to talk on that a little bit because you know it's not necessarily just eating and drinking and you know drinking whiskey and wine and all that stuff but people got to get drunk on all kinds of things people get drunk on pleasure to get money mad to get drunk on the cares of life and money and all these other things people get drunk and all kinds of it but notice how it says that a person that you know begins to think that the lord delays his coming to all this up and become mean and that right to become mean and arrogant and everything else smite one another and oh my that's how do you do when the lord you don't expect the lord to come when you get away from god then it's that the lord of that servant shall come in a day that he don't look for an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him oh boy we don't want to be in this part do we cut his and shall cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrite still shall be weeping and gnashing of truth amen great tribulation period praise be to god all right chapter 25 notice he says here then shall the kingdom of heaven be like unto ten virgins which took their lamps now we're going to talk a little bit about getting ready that all right ten virgins that took their lamps and went forth to meet him what is this went forth all about you got to go out this message of this hour is to come out how many believes that it's to come out to go out go out to meet him go out of where go out of all of his sin go out of all this chaos amen go out of churches you got to leave churches nowadays if you want to be in the bride of christ amen let me just stop here take a little time here but we know that when god created adam and eve it was the thought that he had of having his own wife isn't that right and it's the most beautiful thing there is outside of salvation a good wife a good husband that's a bad thing that god could give you but he had something greater in mind didn't he he had something greater in mind he had a thought that he also wanted a wife he wanted a bride amen this bride is going to make herself ready boy now how many knows better bam talk there's a lot of a lot of things where where brother man talked about the vision that he had of that dump and so forth if he goes that way and so forth and you know that it would end up in catastrophe but if if not he does he chose the right path and so forth he says now god has blessed him with being able to what dress the bride another give us the clothing that we need to dress because every bride has to have a wedding dress right and over in revelation 19 chapter we find out that he says she was granted to her that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white clean and white represents unspotted huh you don't go smearing a bunch of mud on on on a bride's dress you don't have no ink on it not right it has to be spot it has to be pure it has to be white it has to be clean and that's how god is gonna have a pride for himself without spot and without wrinkle amen but now how many knows that the devil also has a bride the devil has a church now we know that a female is a type of the church right amen she is the type of the church now the prophet taught us you look at the conditions of women and you'll see the conditions of a church amen now you look at the worldly women boy it's terribly bad but even in a local church even in a church here or any church you go to look at all the women huh and you'll see what condition that church is in amen so go visit your baptist church sometime go visit these others it's bad ain't it that's right and so we see here that god is going to have a church without spot without wrinkle amen and these uh virgins that went out if you'll notice amen they went out there was five wise five foolish the wise took oil in their vessels in other words they had the baptism of the holy ghost oil represents the you may go into a church today and somebody say the preacher say something and amen some brother or say hey man there's a sister saying hey man boy everybody turn your head what's going on amen people begin to screaming and slobbering and speaking in tongues and act like a bunch of acts 2 38 children isn't that right them denominations they were like they don't know what to do with all that man they can't have all that they put her out of our church right away amen now over in revelations we look we're gonna let me finish this first all right and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps i truly believe that that call has absolutely done went forth that it's time to go out and meet the bridegroom because this bridegroom is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god isn't that right so we go and we join ourselves with the word of god amen amen when you come to god you have to what submit yourself what 100 to him just like a wife does her husband and then she submits himself herself completely to him she surrenders herself to him amen and that's what god is looking for how he knows that's what god's looking for us here as we approach him in the rapture time and the catching away he is looking for a wife and husband relationship that's what he wants not just because you're worried about going hell but because you know just as a husband and wife the sweetness the you know how they just know each other and how they just love each other and oh my maybe i shouldn't go down this road but maybe i will you know i was thinking of you know when you're courtney the girl and you know girl you really like her you really love her and you want to impress her man you'll open the car door and man you'll buy her you'll pay for her meal you're gonna hand her that bill right and mine's just whatever she wants you give it to her don't you anything you could possibly do for but that all changes long a little bit after marriage and that's why we got the problems that we do well you sisters don't have to amen your husband might hear but that's the truth right we'd have a whole lot better marriage is if we try to please our wife didn't paul say that a husband sees how that she can please he's his wife and a wife being married sees how she can please her husband amen and that's in a spiritual realm too isn't that right amen we want to please the lord and that's why god is so good to us with everything because he wants to please us that's why he says to ask abundantly that you join me for before i come to give you life for that more abundantly god wants you to have abundant life not some uh drag life shouldn't be a drag no should have abundant life if you're in christ amen i just had that revelation this week i said you know i need to treat my wife you know try to make her and i do but you know just the idea hey you know if we did that more treated our wives as good as we did our well girlfriend when she was our girlfriend everything would be okay that's right all right so let's talk about this false church first of all when we get over into revelations we talk about and i want to i want to give you a picture of the false search what we're to come out of we're going to show you what you got to get away from right what you want what you've got to get away from to really get dressed amen and to be ready to meet the lord you can't be part of because the fact is the public god said that you know people today and the churches today are running without a message they really don't have a message for the people well jesus died two thousand years ago well that's wonderful but there's a whole lot more nowadays we have questions like which church is right you know what's right who's right what's truth what's not truth you know there's all kinds of questions you know why are the lutherans now having a uproar because they have a uh what is it i don't even know the word anymore trans uh trans you know or somebody that's was made from a boy to a girl and they have a problem with him being a bishop transgender yeah having a trans yeah i you got such complicated words anymore but transgender bishop i'm like oh my gracious you mean they let that in there where are we at amen i'll tell you where we're at we're found in revelations in revelation 17 is where we're at when we begin to look at devil and his bride amen now we know that the whole thing you know when it comes right down to it all the way from eve and adam eve to how that you know she committed fornication against her husband and so forth and it's been adultery from the very beginning amen she became a harlot when you cheat on your husband or your wife you know it's harlotry prostitution not prostitution that's for sale but harlotry it becomes like a and so the bible has some strong words all all through revelations you'll find these strong words and i want to show you why revelation 17 it says and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven miles and talked with me saying come heather and i want to show you the judgment of the great that setteth upon many waters if you're wondering what waters are over in the same chapter verse 15 and he says unto me the waters which thou saw us where the seth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues so in other words this great is over nations to tongues and peoples amen she has a vast following over a whole lot of people the great horrors i mean he calls her just he didn't mean he didn't diminish he didn't he just called her what she was because to take another man to take another man's word amen over his how many knows jesus is not too happy with that god's not too pleased with sharing his wife amen and so he says you know sitteth upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication we know that wine represents stimulation so when i got to thinking about this people absolutely get some kind of a kick out of some kind of a sensation out of committing adultery on god it's terrible i don't know why but to do naturally speaking naturally speaking if you have a woman that has got the wrong spirit on her in that right and she likes to flirt with other guys well guess what you have issues you got problems because it's a spirit a bad woman the bible says is water in a man's blood and vice versa is that right and for some reason we know that we're living in an age of adultery and whoredom and everything else and even the prophet said back in the 60s it's hard to find a virtuous girl you'd have to go to some black woods church somewhere to find one because all the public schools while their law prostitutes before they ever get out of there amen maybe not all but close and where are we at today oh my but notice a stimulation of her fornication a why never fornication the kings of the earth have committed fornication so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman all right a woman a church sitting upon a scarlet colored beast names of full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was a raided purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having in a golden cup in her hand full of the abominations and the filthiness of her fornication now who in the world is this church who in the world who has a cup full of her of the abominations that are forming the filthiness of her for a cake he gets real explicit don't he amen upon her forehead was her name written mystery babylon the great the mother notice it's not just her that's a harlot but she has children she has daughters that are harlots amen daughters that are harlots and abominations of the earth here's another identification mark of this woman this woman i saw was drunken with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration i don't know exactly what it is that john saw but we know that the catholic church came and it's always decked with gold they have the great cathedrals and everything else and she will admit that she is guilty of killing 68 million people down through the dark ages that was satan's tool church is satan's tool but the bible says that one woman and if you're not dressed right is more of a temptation and the greatest reason for a man to fall to the worst trap there is right but he said spiritually he says a church is the most deceiving thing that there is because woman types church and it's the church that's so deceiving people go in there wanting to be good people nuns go in there wanting to be good people huh but most of them become servants to the priests hello it's just terrible amen and so you see that how that people go into baptist churches methodist churches and the preacher now brother bam taught us he says if you really want to see what kind of a woman she is see what kind of children she brings forth right he says these riggies and these cats and the elvis and preacher lets him goes out the public bathing and everything else and wear these kitties and so forth and come to church with shorts on and pants on i mean those bible says that a woman that wears a garment pertains to a man it's an abomination in the sight of god boy we done got a lot of people riled up there if they all heard this abominations it's an abominations mother of harlots churches how many knows that's what the churches are nowadays i hate to announce it but they're the heartless the denominations out there are the harlots baptist methodists pentecostals pentecostals as much harlotry as any of them they could have jesus come right down in the congregation discern the thoughts and do all the signs and be exactly according the word preach the gospel and then say anybody that goes to those meetings will kick you out if you go and you want to join up with jesus we'll kick you out of our church we'll excommunicate you one man said to brother ben now i gotta take him off the book because he come over there to your meetings well what's that mean i mean ain't gonna make it you are full more foolish than i thought you was brother bran said well something to that extent he says you not not as wise as i thought he says that ain't the truth that ain't true don't you worry about taking if you've been in other words you better get your name off of that book if you want it on his book so they're the prostitute their heart they will absolutely claim to be married to christ and take their own understanding take their wisdom over gods that's why they'll be left in the tribulation period that's why they'll be screaming oh god i thought i was serving all you know there's going to be so much weeping and wailing there's going to be so many people disappointed because they thought they could get ready to their self all these people there's millions of people that think they're getting ready i'm gonna get ready i'm gonna get myself ready to wait i want to get ready yeah take your way and you're going to find that you if you do get in somehow you're going to be that guy that jesus says you know when there was a wedding and there was a garment this guy didn't have a wedding garment on it the master i mean hey how did you get in here without the wedding garment he says find him take him behind him and cast him in the outer darkness weeping and wailing gnashing of teeth right get him out of here people want to go people want to get there their own way you're not going to get there your own way oh my she was drunken with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs amen now notice in verse let me see here revelations 19 and 6. catholic church how many knows that's the catholic church that great heart harlot this is the catholic church they claim to follow paul and peter but what did they do they put images up statues up and they will kiss the toe off of peter poor peter you know you don't have a toe anymore too many people been down there worshiping how about mary how many how many know the catholic church they are our biggest form of spiritualism in the world praying to dead folks huh praying to mary oh she's really their god they worship me when they pray they pray to marry or paid a peer where do you find that in the bible nowhere it's spiritualism it's idolatry it's prostitution or hollywood she said you know being a claiming to be married to god christ and then doing that but it's no more than what somebody would say well we know that's the truth brother bannon we know what you tell us the truth but if i teach that my church will kick me out huh and they'll say so i can't teach that folks the day i get ashamed to preach this message is a day that god will throw me out spew me out huh not ashamed to preach this message it was jesus christ it was him coming and doing what he what he said he was gonna do the message is amen found over in chapter let's go back to 18. and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with his strong voice saying babylon the greatest fallen is fallen has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit in the cage of every unclean and hateful bird amen and all nations for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her foreign of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornications with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies amen look at that the kings of the earth every time how many knows that whenever the pope has a meeting all of the even the uh over the middle east all of those leaders they'll come and they'll join him still be with him boy if he comes the united we we ran from that thing we didn't want no catholicism we want no part of all that because we know what they all did but like that look how they have come back in this could get you shot yeah because boy they they know but here they finally to make their way back in you know and invading of look at how many catholics we have there in in our office up there and so forth of course we know what brother branham said about president kennedy he was the first catholic he says you who sold your birthright to vote for the very thing that we ran from amen that's right the very thing that we ran fight but catholicism now notice so he says abundance of her delicacy and heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her come out of her come out of who lay out to see her come out of that harlot system that prostitute system of revelation 3. how many knows revelation 3 is the letter to the churches and in the last church age he said and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that were cold nor hot so that because thou art lukewarm i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou says i am rich increased with goods and have need of nothing in other words i ain't got to listen to that crank i ain't got to follow all that they thought they had all they need they did not have all they need when your denominational church you do not have the need what you need to make a rapture amen well i was preaching this i said just go visit the baptist church the methodist church oh visit see how the women dress when you come into this church look at the women how they dress and you'll see with the condition of the church you're all dressed like prostitutes well that's a prostitute church huh it shows more on men i mean on women than does men all of us know not to come in here with shorts and it's like that and the other isn't that right as our women i'm proud i wouldn't be afraid to pray to all of our sisters up and say this is to where christian dresses amen but they said they have need of nothing and have noticed and noah's not that thou art wretched this church was wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i don't think i'm going to take this church to heaven no no because you're going to be without spot without wrinkle have a dress on of pure white how many beliefs and that white this is the righteousness of saints now it says saints but we know that we don't have our own righteousness so whatever's righteousness you have you got from him amen and i'm sure that's what what is his righteousness amen praise be the lord blind and naked that's what the church condition was they were wretched miserable poor blind and naked then he says i constantly abide me a gold tried to defy the thou mayest be rich and white raymond the dumbest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint that i said without eyes with eyes if thou may see oh my as many as i love i rebuke that's what he just got finished doing that's why brother brown's message is half of brother brown's message it's a rebuke to women it's a rebuke to churches and when he preached and said denominationalism is the mark of the beast he was pretty strong and then they threw him out speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the holy ghost we'll throw you out for that it just showed you didn't have it you wouldn't slow jesus out uh-uh you wouldn't throw jesus out if you truly had the baptism of the holy ghost amen i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent and here is the secret behold they have thrown me out they have put me out the church put christ out in this church age right around 1963. i've been here for three years and ain't nobody opened them doors people that do come to my meetings get excommunicated hardly anywhere to go huh jesus barely had anywhere to go tell you who you are what you're afraid of what your problem is and what you've done in the past and everything else and forgive you and get it all made right and eyes opened and heal the sick and everything right there they don't want it prostitute horror amen won't be there now look at the women they're preachers now they got eve up there preaching her gospel of oh god don't mind huh god is a god of love he's a god of love i love the way he loves me and i love him back but he don't put up with my foolishness it's not without no correction amen is that all right i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice seen that right i'm at least come out and hear my voice i'd love to play that tape where brother brown says come out of her come out that's what he said that angel was screamed get out of there or you'll be tart takers of the mark of the beast why because if you continue to believe that the second you take that belief because what you believe is what changes in your forehead you'll get marked when you reject the truth you get marked and you never hear the truth again let me tell you something that's scary that's scary lord help me never to reject your truth when evangelists come by a preacher comes by and tells the truth and i see it's the truth and then to turn from that huh i don't care how much you scream shout dance in the spirit you'll never get right with god until you come back to that place you got that's where i messed up that's where i left you take me back again amen oh my that's right stand at the door not that's what god is calling us out of get away from that if you're going to be dressed if you're going to be ready you can't be part of attack part of that how many knows this message when it comes it preaches holiness it preaches purity amen it preaches believing every word of god amen brother bram says no you know as a woman if she is married to christ the word she cannot be married to a church denomination at the same time for she's bound by it she shall not live with both husbands at the same time and that's what people are doing living with preachers that won't preach the truth amen still claiming that they love the lord singing god's music and songs but living with two husbands amen she shall be called an adulterer that's kandre one to another see one is of god and the other one is man made amen what would you do if you knew that this church is not of god you get out of here quick it's the same way with any other church if it's not a god it's either of god or it's not it either stands for the full word of god or it doesn't or it compromises and that's the deceiving part that's why so many will come and say didn't we do this and didn't we do that they thought they were right but they weren't amen my let me tell you a word i was listening to a tape and this is what something something bill abraham said that i really like listen close now just watch stay close to christ let me warn you know as a minister of the gospel don't take any foolishness and don't imagine anything why because people were having oil coming out of their hands and blood and this that or the other all kinds of imaginations and things that are not scriptural hello and it all banishes can i say that anything that isn't really founded upon the word it vanishes it it comes to nothing and all those little feelings and sensations and foolishness all came to nothing he says don't take any of those things stay right there until until on the inside of the inside is anchored to the word that you're right with christ because that's the only thing that's going to make it because we're in the most deceitful age that we've ever lived it would deceive the very elect that if it was possible many false prophets are going into the land many false preachers see come over here coming over there now there's only one place and that is to meet god on the basis of his word come into christ and he is everywhere all right because they have an anointing and they can do the same thing like the rest of them brotherhood says clean up your lives you should hear this in invisible union clean up your lives pay lives up pay your debts oh no man jesus said i don't mean your house and stuff like that you gotta have that you got that but all of get everything else off your hands in other words all of those lingering things and all those things that are out there that you know you need to get make right and that right and get right get it all right he says you got to do it get all your things off of your hands get everything right make ready get ready remember in the name of the lord something's fixing to happen i want to say that again tonight something's fixing to happen it may not happen for three years five years it could happen in two years it could happen six months it could happen in the next couple months but something's fixing to happen something big is fixing the heaven i mean big amen oh my let me finish this and see if i can still remember what i was thinking about [Applause] so now he says what are we coming here for what are we doing are we coming here just to play a game no are we coming here to meet us a lot no christ can't come until the church is perfectly right how many things we got to get right i like that song well you better get right are you going to get left amen hey matthew you better get right amen now notice perfectly right he's waiting on us and he said look at california look at the riots look at 19 people being killed racial didn't i tell you not long ago that martin luther king would lead his people to a massacre how many remembers that and it isn't it isn't them colored people it's them leaders staring them up wait that's the truth i have to be careful here but not until a certain president did all this racial stuff even start up he heard very little of it i'm old enough now to remember how it all went we were all getting along pretty good hey we were getting along so good we put a black president in there i was like wow we know that that's all gone now everybody ought to be happy then it all got way worse huh all of a sudden things went downhill uh-huh what did brother said it's him leaders steering it up it isn't integration brother bam said segregation or whatever racism whatever you want to call it that's not really what it is i don't believe it's really a problem we've got problems we've got bruce please project we got those things but i don't believe it's all that amen all right and whatever you want to call it he says isn't all of that he said it's the devil that's right it's the devil not only to the white or the colored it's all of them amen it's the devil and the men of faculties of reasons of men is broke down amen there's no hope there it's beyond hope the whole thing is a putrified sore he's a prophet he's a prophet because why he said it was a future fight sorry if it wasn't back then look at it now it is certainly a putrified sore now just going to bust any time it seems like amen there's no hopes men are faculties he says of men they can't even make a decision now i'm not a politician i'm not democrat republican they're all filthy i'm for the he says i'm for one kingdom and that's the kingdom of jesus christ that's all amen brother bam says oh god that's like the pope where is our men men that's men that stands for principle women that stand for a principle where is a church that stands for principle i ain't got a nickel's worth of time for i wish you why she give in compromising spirit if a woman's a woman let her be a lady if a man's a man let him be a man amen we can say that about ten times to the world hey if you're born a man be man if you're born a woman and if you're born both ways well you're definitely got problems that's right all right because that's not normal yeah they want to make that normal no it's not it's not a normal child hey first thing i'd say that's not normal folks people is not normal their brains ain't normal all right now go again if he's president where's our john quincy adams where's our abraham lincoln's men of principle where's our patrick henry give me liberty or give me death where's a man that stands for what's right where's a man that's not afraid to speak out regardless if the whole world's against him speak out what's right and stand for it and die for it amen where is men today of integrity where is men with spirit they're so wishy-washy and gummed up until they don't know where they stand boy that's the truth god let me stand with the principles of one man as a minister the word of jesus christ heavens and earth will pass away but it'll never fail on this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall never prevail against it amen praise be to god god is looking for a church that is not mixed up with my idea any other preacher's idea but is committed to god's word let god's word be true and every man lie that's what the bible says every man's word let it be a lie and mine the truth and it is amen to show you that it is like a husband-and-wife relationship with god and his church amen and i believe that that's the way we should live tonight let me in closing say i believe that's the way we should live we don't want to do something against our lord because he's also our husband and we want to please our husband how many believes he's our husband amen that's exactly right he's our lord he knows best amen you know there's there's churches and preachers that take this too far but they'll say a woman don't even need to do any thinking the only thought she should have is his thoughts because it's go with the word but we don't want to have our own thought we want his thoughts right but people take that too far and they play with it and go the wrong way with it but with god we don't really have to have our own thought because as long as we think his thoughts are going to be perfect unfortunately a husband he can be wrong is that right i don't know should i say it sister johnny sometimes men ought to listen to their wives there you go yeah amen oh my they're smart i got a smart life i was out there putting some more metal on my barn yesterday are you ready donna and i thought of a joke i said honey i got a joke i said every good wife laughs at this joke she goes i'm like oh that was good that was you got me there every good wife laughed at her husband joe yeah right that's funny i thought that was good right there but anyway she's smart i like it smart don't you all right but anyway i won't tell you the joke maybe later amen but anyway so listen amen you love the lord tonight i'm sorry if that was a little out maybe just a little bit out there but anyway i thought it was good i mean whenever she did that so ephesians verse 22 of chapter four why wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself forward how many knows it goes both ways that he might sanctify cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word then he might present it to himself a glorious church now notice not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body and of his flesh and his bone and for this cause shall a man leaving his father and the mother let me just say this you have to leave everything else if you're going to join with the lord nobody believes that might be church might be your own ideas might be your own ways it might be your own life it might be all kinds of things but you leave everything else you didn't jesus say unless if you're willing to say call to follow me you're not worthy of me and shall we and they too shall be one flesh notice the last verse that he says he says he's not really talking about husbands and wives this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church that's who he really was talking about when brother branham preached invisible union of the bride he says you know whatever you husbands your new wives are and so forth he made different statements and so forth about a wife being true to her husband or having to confess that to her husband or whatever and vice versa and make everything right and then he goes on and of course great into detail he says you know i'm that's i'm not so much talking about tasman but i'm talking about christ and his church he says you can't be to the old denomination of church your old man you know he asked he's got to be dead not just divorced but he's got to be dead if you're going to be married to christ that's when he says you know you can't be married to christ in a denominational at the same time because one of them is actually amen and a a prostitute you wouldn't want to be part of that and the other one of course we know that jesus christ he's got a little remnant we don't know just how large that is but it's a small group of people amen that is getting ready to leave this world amen in our character we could get in our character but time's getting away but the body of jesus christ notice she's not smiting her servants and says he says be clothed with humility amen have sweetness about you have gentleness patience and all the sweet characters that's what he's coming for hey man a wife that's not either burly and so forth he just wants a wife that he's got gentleness about his sweetness and all the characters of uh i mean a real gentle person amen so god bless you tonight stand with me tonight if you will how many loves the lord amen how many wants to be part of that bride get yourself notice she said get herself ready so if jesus said here be ready the other place he says the bride has what made herself ready what are we doing we're casting out the old things we're putting on the new man amen putting away lying the bible says good go into the scripture paul says put off all these things and put on the new man which after god was created in righteousness and true holiness put away lying speak every man truth to his neighbor for we are members one of another be angry and say not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that steal a stole steal no more but let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that was good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the ears and grieve not the holy spirit whereby ye are sealed until the day of your redemption let all bitterness wrath anger clamor evil speaking be put away from you with all my loss and be kind one another one kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another and even as christ for god's sake has forgiven you be followers of god as dear children and walk in love as christ also has loved us and has given himself for us an offering in his sacrifice for a sweet smelling savor but fornication and all uncleanness covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting amen which are not convenient but rather the giving of thanks for this you know that no whoremonger no unclean person nor covetous man which is an idolater have any inheritance in the kingdom of god christ and of god that no man deceive you with weighing words words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god on the children of disobedience be not ye therefore partakers with them reminds me of the scriptures that you partake not of our sins that you receive not of our plagues let's bow our heads lord jesus as once again father we have come into your house gather ourselves together lord to do a checkup lord to do a search in our hearts to see whether we're ready or whether we still need improvement lord we ask god that you'd help us lord jesus as we search our hearts and as we look at this in ephesians where paul talked about all the things that we need to put out get away from to put on a new man that is righteous and holy father we ask god tonight that jesus draws ever closer lord both tonight and then between now and sunday lord we want to meet you lord we want to be ready we want to obey what you said to watch watch be ready be ready below we see our government we see the the squeeze that's coming down people losing their jobs just because they don't do what the government said and lord we see a real squeeze coming we know there's a financial squeeze coming all these things are leading up to the mark of the beast that if you don't do what they say if you don't obey what they do it's going to affect your money it's going to affect your pocketbook no man will buy or sell eventually unless you belong lord and jesus we see where the 13th chapter of revelations where it says that america rose up and she exercised all the power of the first beast give life to the image of the beast that it might do all that the first one did we see it happening we see it closing in lord we're just watching it watching it the squeeze coming down getting closer closer lord it's even at the doors or while we look at the signs and we see father that can't be long now we ask god that you are each soul in here and in their radio audience father to say god help me to be ready for any day lord jesus when that happens we know when that squeeze comes god they're going to try to squeeze us out but you'll take us out that'll be the time father according to the scriptures that you'll take us out of here lord we ask god that you'll have everybody have everyone under the sound of my voice to be ready lord everybody at evening light tabernacle i asked for them lord that you'd have them ready lord jesus why don't we honesty each one father help me god to lead him to help him to help dress them lord jesus in the robes of your righteousness father forgive us of our shortcomings our failures lord and where we're not what we ought to be lord jesus we ask your blessing upon us lord go with us heal our sick god raise us up father help us not to get into a slump lord but to stay fervent not to get caught up plum drunk with the cares of life and the things of the world but to be fervent in spirit to have our true lamps trimmed and burning and ready for we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen god bless you church
