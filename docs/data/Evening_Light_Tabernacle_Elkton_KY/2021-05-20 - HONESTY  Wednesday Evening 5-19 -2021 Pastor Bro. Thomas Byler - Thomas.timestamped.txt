[6:54] told her the other day that
[6:57] they tried to admit it in the hospital
[6:58] last thursday and we'd plan to go out of
[7:01] town for our anniversary and
[7:02] just told him she didn't want to do that
[7:04] so she has to go to the doctor tomorrow
[7:07] and they're going to run some tests and
[7:08] so i don't know what
[7:09] they're going to do with that she's
[7:10] retaining too much fluid so
[7:12] just remember her she's been in a lot of
[7:14] pain and just pray that god will
[7:16] just work out worker worker grace in her
[7:19] life and
[7:20] she she doesn't keep her leg up she's
[7:22] pretty miserable and it gets to hurting
[7:24] quite a bit so
[7:25] just remember heard in your prayers and
[7:27] just pray that god
[7:28] just just give her a miracle she needs
[7:31] one
[7:32] in her body tonight and i just pray that
[7:35] i i woke up this morning and she wasn't
[7:37] in bed she
[7:38] gets up and down and i was thinking as
[7:42] brother brad i i began to think the
[7:44] other day when brother brad preached the
[7:46] mother's day message and
[7:48] uh he began to talk about how mothers
[7:50] are always busy and
[7:51] i was always amazed whenever the kids
[7:54] were growing up
[7:55] because there's always you mothers know
[7:58] there's always a
[7:59] mountain of laundry and we would go to
[8:02] bed and she'd be doing laundry when we'd
[8:03] get up
[8:04] she'd be doing laundry and i said when
[8:06] did you come to bed she said i slept for
[8:08] a while
[8:09] i don't know how long that wild was but
[8:12] she was always busy and so just remember
[8:14] her in prayer gotta just touch her body
[8:16] and if you have any on your heart you
[8:18] might let me know with uplifted hand and
[8:20] man sister peggy in the different
[8:21] shut-ins tonight and
[8:23] hey man we're gonna ask for the brian if
[8:24] he'd open the service in the word of

[11:47] amen tonight amen
[11:52] amen god bless you you may be seated
[11:54] tonight and
[11:55] amen i we sing that little of course
[11:58] that one verse
[11:59] they'll be shouting and i know some
[12:02] people don't think we should get really
[12:04] excited but
[12:05] you know i guess one of my favorite
[12:06] quotes by the brad of brother brandon's
[12:08] is
[12:09] when he talks about that man of course
[12:11] i'm kind of like yeah i like baseball
[12:13] so he got so beside himself he grabbed
[12:15] his straw hat and just yanked it down
[12:17] over his head
[12:18] because he was enthused and you know i
[12:21] don't
[12:22] i don't know what you like to do but
[12:25] there's nothing i like
[12:26] better more than to be in the presence
[12:28] of the lord jesus
[12:29] i've been to baseball games and went
[12:32] home sad because i paid a lot of money
[12:34] and my team
[12:34] lost and i went home happy because they
[12:37] did win
[12:38] but there's nothing like the joy and the
[12:40] thrill the feel
[12:41] the lord jesus christ and to be in his
[12:43] presence and it's not always shouting
[12:45] sometimes just to lift your hands and
[12:47] feel that sweet holy spirit
[12:50] just it just moves it it just feels like
[12:53] a
[12:54] i don't know how to describe it but you
[12:55] know what i'm talking about and
[12:57] i just pray as brother daniel williams
[12:59] used to say
[13:00] if you just need to stand in the corner
[13:02] and shake your head yes
[13:03] if that's what you do let the lord have
[13:06] his way in your heart and life tonight
[13:08] and
[13:08] this song was on my heart today and it's
[13:10] in the red book sister becky page 139 at
[13:13] calvary and
[13:14] amen we wouldn't be here tonight if it
[13:16] wasn't for calvary
[13:17] and i'm so thankful for what the lord's
[13:19] done for us and
[13:21] i have the privilege i want to give a
[13:22] little testimony before we sing and
[13:25] i get to work for myself and the lord's
[13:28] blessed us when we
[13:29] go out and buy cars and i was at a young
[13:33] he's probably about 30 years old a black
[13:35] man the other day and
[13:38] we were talking and i began to testify
[13:42] to him and began to tell him
[13:43] what the lord had done for me and all
[13:45] the things he had brought me through and
[13:48] and uh he looked at me and he said you
[13:49] know he said the
[13:51] last two days has been the worst two
[13:52] days that i can remember he got hurt on
[13:55] his job and
[13:56] he couldn't no longer do what he used to
[13:58] do he said i went from making 80 000 a
[14:00] year
[14:01] 70 to 80 000 a year to making 20 000 a
[14:04] year because i hurt my back and
[14:06] i said well i'm gonna tell you i said
[14:09] you trust in the lord and put your hope
[14:11] in him because that's the only hope that
[14:12] we have and
[14:13] i said i know by experience
[14:17] firsthand that god not only will he
[14:20] bless you spiritually
[14:21] he'll do he'll bless you financially and
[14:24] he'll he can touch your body he'll do
[14:26] whatever you had need of and he looked
[14:27] at me and he said
[14:30] i'm glad that you came by today and i
[14:34] said lord
[14:34] sometimes we go through trials and we go
[14:36] through tests and we don't understand
[14:38] it's all because of calvary and what
[14:40] you've done for us
[14:41] that we can help somebody you say will
[14:44] he ever come to lord

[35:57] well i won't say that i preached it
[35:58] before but it'll be a different
[36:00] direction than we've preached before
[36:01] amen and most likely
[36:04] this evening it'll probably affect
[36:07] everybody amen
[36:09] amen shouldn't be anybody left out on
[36:11] this one so
[36:12] amen because i know i wasn't amen and i
[36:14] was like wow lord that is really
[36:16] something because
[36:17] even whenever i got whenever this
[36:18] message kind of come to me i was like
[36:21] wow that's really good so praise the
[36:23] lord
[36:24] so if you will open your bibles to the
[36:26] book of revelation
[36:27] and this evening we want to talk about
[36:30] dishonesty
[36:31] and honesty amen
[36:35] all right it's quite a subject isn't it
[36:38] we want to focus
[36:39] focus with the help of the lord on
[36:40] honesty but of course we'll bring in the
[36:42] opposite
[36:43] also
[36:47] in revelation 21
[36:54] and there's two places here that he kind
[36:57] of
[36:57] sounds a lot alike so we're going to
[36:59] read read both of those scriptures
[37:02] let's go to revelations 22 12

[37:31] the end the first
[37:32] and the last blessed are dated to his
[37:34] commandments that they may
[37:36] have a right to the tree of life and may
[37:38] enter
[37:39] in through the gates of the city for
[37:42] without are dogs
[37:43] and sorcerers whoremongers and murderers
[37:47] idolaters and what's or whosoever loveth
[37:51] and maketh a lie isn't it something that
[37:54] god would put that in
[37:56] the very end whoever loveth
[37:59] or maketh a lie amen well
[38:03] let me know just something that comes to
[38:04] me before we read the other word
[38:06] uh a lie has to be made
[38:10] am i right you have to make a lie
[38:14] you know because you have to pervert
[38:17] truth in order to make a lie
[38:19] amen so you actually have to make a lie
[38:21] you have to take the truth and pervert
[38:22] it
[38:23] in order to make a lie amen
[38:28] in verse chapter 21 verse six through
[38:31] eight
[38:34] and he said unto me it is done i am
[38:37] alpha and the omega
[38:38] the beginning and the end i will give
[38:40] unto him that is a thirst of the
[38:41] fountain of water of life freely
[38:44] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[38:45] things and i will be his god and he
[38:47] shall be
[38:48] my son amen him that overcometh
[38:52] but the fearful and the unbelieving
[38:56] and the abominable and murderers
[38:59] and whoremongers and sorcerers and
[39:02] idolaters
[39:04] and all liars shall have their part in
[39:07] the lake which burneth
[39:09] with fire and brimstone which is the
[39:11] second death
[39:12] may god had his blessings to the reading
[39:14] of the words you can be seated
[39:16] amen we want to talk about uh
[39:20] talk about honesty dishonesty amen
[39:25] first of all we know that something
[39:26] that's dishonest
[39:28] is a lie it's not the truth isn't that
[39:31] right
[39:32] something that's honest something that's
[39:34] right
[39:36] is truth amen and honesty is a form
[39:40] of holiness right
[39:44] we know this because many times when
[39:47] somebody is
[39:48] needing to confess something or whatever
[39:51] you know we'll tell them look why don't
[39:53] you just tell me the truth
[39:55] we say it this way why don't you come
[39:56] clean
[39:59] why don't you come clean and tell the
[40:01] truth
[40:03] why because even the man even the reason
[40:06] that we have the story
[40:08] of the prospector uh that went and found
[40:11] gold and was on his way back
[40:13] and you know he was in his cabin and his
[40:16] dog kept barking in the kit barking and
[40:18] he finally shot his dog because he
[40:19] wouldn't quit
[40:20] barking and he shot his dog and
[40:23] afterwards
[40:24] man went in there and killed the man
[40:27] the reason that we know that is because
[40:29] that man came clean because he had that
[40:31] is on his conscience
[40:32] all of his life and brother bam said
[40:35] that at
[40:36] his death deathbed is when he confessed
[40:38] it in other words
[40:39] he wanted to get it off his chest so he
[40:42] actually confessed to the murder
[40:45] and that's how he found out what the
[40:46] story all was about because he confessed
[40:49] it
[40:49] amen because confession amen and this is
[40:53] another word for
[40:53] confession is very very important thing
[40:56] because
[40:57] confession is to the truth
[41:01] right if thou shalt confess with our
[41:05] mouth the lord jesus
[41:06] why why do you have to confess the lord
[41:08] jesus because jesus said
[41:09] i am the way i am the truth
[41:13] somebody knows that this is the truth
[41:15] the bible is the truth
[41:18] everything outside of that is dishonesty
[41:20] it's a lie
[41:22] let every man's word by and mind the
[41:25] truth
[41:26] is what god says amen
[41:30] and ultimately there's only two things
[41:33] that we can do
[41:34] there's only two things we have to
[41:36] either accept
[41:38] honesty or dishonesty we have to accept
[41:41] the truth
[41:42] or we accept a lie
[41:46] amen
[41:50] and we know the very beginning of the
[41:53] creation the very beginning of the fall
[41:55] was because that
[41:56] eve did what she believed a lie
[42:02] and she believed the lie she didn't stay
[42:05] with the truth amen and that's what
[42:09] caused the whole thing
[42:11] it brought death to the whole human race
[42:13] because
[42:14] she went with dishonesty
[42:21] right she believed something that was
[42:24] not honest
[42:25] that was not true
[42:28] she believed the lie believed something
[42:30] that was dishonest
[42:32] and it brought the whole thing in and in
[42:34] his end time
[42:35] the prophet of god said that it was
[42:37] actually the churches
[42:39] out there hello they also have accepted
[42:42] the devil's lie isn't that right
[42:46] they also accepted the devil's eye and
[42:48] brought all
[42:49] brought us to where we are now
[42:52] politically
[42:53] nationally the whole thing they brought
[42:55] it to death
[42:56] because they believed a lie over
[42:59] the vindicated word of god
[43:03] amen let me tell you something i want to
[43:05] talk a little bit about being honest
[43:06] with god
[43:07] being honest with yourself and being
[43:10] honest with others
[43:14] amen and it's all because this all
[43:17] derived from
[43:18] a little revelation as i was listening
[43:20] to the prophet of god and
[43:22] and thought about a certain story and so
[43:24] forth that he mentioned and he mentions
[43:26] a woman that comes back from heaven
[43:28] and when she comes back from heaven she
[43:31] confesses something
[43:33] all right and it is the
[43:36] smallest thing that you might think that
[43:38] would be so
[43:39] small so little so insignificant
[43:43] but yet to come back from heaven and to
[43:45] confess something
[43:47] amen and i thought it back and i thought
[43:50] about how
[43:51] that i thought about calling this
[43:55] honesty from heaven or heavenly honesty
[43:58] amen praise the lord
[44:03] because ultimately brothers sisters we
[44:05] have to be honest
[44:08] and we have to be honest with god
[44:11] now how many knows that the bible says
[44:13] over in
[44:14] let me just find it here if i can
[44:24] first of all in second corinthians
[44:26] fourth chapter one through two it says
[44:28] therefore seeing that we have this
[44:31] ministry
[44:32] as we have received mercy we thank not
[44:35] but have renounced
[44:37] the hidden things of dishonesty
[44:41] amen everything that's not true
[44:45] amen not walking and crafting us
[44:49] don't handling the word of god
[44:50] deceitfully
[44:52] amen i mean as you can tell when
[44:55] somebody's
[44:56] misleading you amen a salesman plenty
[45:00] can make it much better than it is
[45:04] misleading you can hear when it's but
[45:05] don't walk crafty and craftiness
[45:08] but by manifestation of the truth
[45:10] commending ourselves
[45:12] to every man's conscience in the sight
[45:14] of
[45:15] god amen
[45:20] all right romans also in romans
[45:26] the 14th chapter and this is found also
[45:29] back i'm going to read isaiah right
[45:30] quick
[45:32] isaiah 45 and 23 says it this way i have
[45:35] sworn by myself
[45:37] the word has gone out of my mouth in
[45:39] righteousness and shall not return
[45:42] that unto me every knee shall bow and
[45:45] every tongue shall swear paul repeats
[45:49] this and he says for it is written
[45:51] as i live saith the lord every knee
[45:54] shall bow
[45:55] to me and every tongue shall confess
[45:58] to god now he knows that every tongue
[46:02] another place he talks about every knee
[46:04] shall bow
[46:05] every tongue shall confess that jesus
[46:08] christ is lord amen
[46:10] that he is lord
[46:15] every time
[46:18] every knee all of our politicians
[46:21] everybody
[46:22] will bow the knee every tongue is going
[46:25] to have to confess
[46:27] yes you are lord and remember in isaiah
[46:31] and here he says my
[46:32] word has gone forth and shall not return
[46:35] void
[46:36] every knee will bow every tongue shall
[46:38] confess
[46:41] amen that
[46:44] this is the truth amen
[46:47] that his word is the truth
[46:54] so eventually people have to confess
[46:57] to the truth amen
[47:01] sooner or later now
[47:05] let me tell you something else excuses
[47:07] are just a lie
[47:09] there's just a way of trying to get
[47:11] around something but it's a lie
[47:14] not even the truth and people make all
[47:16] kinds of excuses
[47:17] people will say that they don't believe
[47:19] in god but yet the bible says that even
[47:21] the devils believe right even the devil
[47:24] believes
[47:25] and trembles
[47:30] in romans the first chapter
[47:34] in verse 20 it says for the invisible
[47:37] things of him
[47:38] from the creation of the world are
[47:40] clearly seeing
[47:41] being understood by the things that are
[47:43] made
[47:44] even is he in godhead
[47:48] so that they are without excuse
[47:53] when i was studying this i began to
[47:54] think of how that
[47:56] you know god says that a man
[47:59] says there's no god is a fool
[48:02] but you know he is a fool but he didn't
[48:05] call him dumb
[48:06] he didn't call him stupid huh
[48:10] not dumb not ignorant
[48:13] you can look at the creation and you can
[48:15] know
[48:16] there's got to be a god all right
[48:19] if you choose to try to believe that
[48:22] there isn't one
[48:23] you're not dumb you're a fool you
[48:26] already know but you're just making the
[48:27] fool of yourself
[48:29] amen because here the bible clearly
[48:31] states that just by the things that are
[48:33] made
[48:34] people can know that there's a god let
[48:36] me bring this again
[48:37] to even serpentine even the devil and
[48:41] people that are absolutely of the devil
[48:44] they also believe in a god i mean those
[48:46] that
[48:46] everybody believes in some kind of god
[48:48] they believe there's a god out the
[48:50] indians did
[48:51] africa all of them they all believed
[48:53] that there's a god
[48:55] because the their daddy their great
[48:57] great great great great granddad he
[48:59] believed that there was a god
[49:01] and he had a temple and he worshipped
[49:03] and he brought fruits and he sacrificed
[49:05] to god
[49:06] and his name was cain am i right
[49:09] oh he was a very religious man amen
[49:15] but if you'll notice like i said you
[49:17] either have to accept the truth
[49:19] or you have to accept something that's
[49:21] not the truth something that sits on
[49:23] forever it's either all about honesty or
[49:25] it's about
[49:26] dishonesty amen
[49:31] and you have to be honest with god and
[49:33] believe people that are not honest with
[49:35] god
[49:37] well you better watch them they're not
[49:39] going to be honest with themselves
[49:42] they're not going to be honest with you
[49:45] they're not going to be honest
[49:46] they're not honest because if everybody
[49:49] was honest
[49:50] what would they do they would all
[49:53] believe
[49:54] what god said because the bible over say
[49:57] first or second john says if you do not
[50:00] believe the witness of god
[50:02] you have made him a liar in other words
[50:04] you say that ain't true
[50:06] you're making him a liar he says my word
[50:08] is true you say no it's not
[50:10] you're making him a liar hello
[50:14] you're trying to say it's not the truth
[50:16] but if everybody
[50:18] if everybody looked at it right and gave
[50:20] honor to god the way he's supposed to be
[50:22] honored
[50:22] is that right and if they all would do
[50:25] what they're supposed to do they would
[50:26] know
[50:27] that this is the truth if they were what
[50:30] honest with themselves
[50:34] people are not honest with their self
[50:36] and they're not honest with god
[50:39] the sad part what the sad part
[50:42] once they are confronted with the truth
[50:44] once the truth comes in front of you
[50:46] is that right it's presented to you the
[50:48] truth is
[50:50] then you either have to accept that
[50:51] truth or you have to accept
[50:54] a lie
[50:59] and let me tell you something isn't that
[51:00] what the world has done
[51:02] the world has done just that according
[51:05] to
[51:05] second thessalonians
[51:11] and then shall that wicked be revealed
[51:13] whom the lord shall consume with the
[51:14] spirit of his mouth
[51:15] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[51:17] his coming
[51:18] even him whose coming is after satan
[51:21] after
[51:22] working of satan with all power and
[51:24] signs and lying wonders
[51:26] with all deceivableness of
[51:29] unrighteousness
[51:31] in them that perish all right because
[51:34] they receive
[51:35] not the love of the truth
[51:38] amen
[51:44] they receive not the love of the truth
[51:45] that they might be saved because how
[51:47] many knows that
[51:48] if you received the truth of god it'll
[51:50] save you
[51:53] if you accept what god has said it'll
[51:55] actually save your soul
[51:57] amen because it's going to be filled
[52:00] with people
[52:01] who have accepted a lie and therefore
[52:05] it makes them liars amen
[52:09] and heaven is going to be full of people
[52:12] who were
[52:13] honest honest
[52:18] for this cost notice that they might be
[52:20] saved for this cause
[52:22] god shall send them strong delusion
[52:26] that they should believe a lie
[52:30] that they all might be damned who
[52:33] believed
[52:34] not the truth but had pleasure
[52:39] in unrighteousness
[52:42] folks there will be people that are
[52:44] deacons that are preachers that are
[52:46] evangelists
[52:49] take people like benny hen you take
[52:51] people that
[52:52] know about the prophet of god and even
[52:53] repeat him and say things about him and
[52:55] stuff
[52:57] don't tell me they don't know
[53:00] no they'll give the given account over
[53:02] there for that
[53:04] that's right everybody and really
[53:06] truthfully how many knows that
[53:07] god is responsible to bring the truth to
[53:09] front of everybody
[53:11] the truth has to be presented to people
[53:14] for them to be accountable
[53:16] you know right and then they have to
[53:18] make a choice of whether or not
[53:20] they accept the truth or a lie
[53:24] and on the day of judgment folks it'll
[53:27] be played
[53:28] back their very thoughts will be played
[53:31] back
[53:32] there's one thing sure folks that you
[53:35] can hide it
[53:36] you can you can look be connected you
[53:38] can do it all that
[53:39] but it'll all be brought out over there
[53:42] there isn't
[53:43] nothing that isn't going to be revealed
[53:46] over there that's why he says he comes
[53:48] his reward is with him to give to every
[53:51] man
[53:51] according to his work
[53:56] that right everybody's going to be
[53:59] you know given a given basically on
[54:01] whether they chose to accept the truth
[54:04] or whether they accepted a dishonest lie
[54:08] that's where it all lays right there
[54:12] wow that's something in it
[54:17] look at the pharisees isn't that right
[54:19] look at the pharisees
[54:22] now jesus brought him the truth didn't
[54:25] he
[54:26] but he they just wouldn't hear him they
[54:28] didn't want to hear him because of pride
[54:29] because of jealousy but when nicodemus
[54:32] came to jesus at night
[54:34] what did he say
[54:37] he said i know that you are a a
[54:40] are of god did he say it that way
[54:44] now what do you say sister begging
[54:48] that's right we secret word
[54:51] we pharisees know that you're a man of
[54:54] god
[54:58] but they were afraid to confess him they
[55:00] didn't want to confess him
[55:01] their pride in their prestige and all of
[55:03] that so what did that make him that
[55:05] made them to accept the devil's lie in
[55:07] their minds
[55:09] amen ah you were not born of fornication
[55:12] all that was just throw off because they
[55:14] knew in their heart
[55:15] nobody could do that without them being
[55:17] a god
[55:18] now you take that when jesus raised him
[55:21] from the dead lashes from the dead open
[55:22] the eyes of the blind all these things
[55:24] you bring that into our age hello
[55:27] and all the miracles that are done that
[55:29] have been done
[55:30] through the ministry of the prophet of
[55:32] god jesus christ would come down in the
[55:36] after by almost every sermon
[55:39] that right and show himself this
[55:42] generation this world
[55:44] is without excuse
[55:49] and buddy i'm gonna hear that i'll tell
[55:51] you right now you are
[55:52] lying to yourself if you don't believe
[55:56] that those tapes are gonna meet you on
[55:58] judgment day
[56:00] because brother man said this message
[56:02] will meet this generation on the
[56:04] judgment day
[56:05] don't give me no excuses you heard it
[56:08] you knew it
[56:09] and you accepted something that was a
[56:11] lie
[56:12] a dishonesty over the word of god and
[56:14] many penteco
[56:15] preachers and churches baptist
[56:17] methodists and all of them
[56:19] hello will be thrown out
[56:23] many will come to me in that day say
[56:25] lord lord open to us
[56:27] no he says haven't we spoke in tongues
[56:29] haven't we cast out there have we done
[56:30] many mighty works in your name
[56:33] and jesus will say depart from me i
[56:36] never knew you you workers of what
[56:41] iniquity is order to do something and
[56:44] not do it they
[56:45] chose to go the other way you
[56:48] choose dishonesty over honesty when the
[56:52] word and the truth is come before you
[56:54] and you seal your doom thereby
[56:57] or you get saved by there by thereby how
[57:00] many is glad to be a product of
[57:02] having faith and belief in it the
[57:05] unbelieving is the one that's going to
[57:07] go over there they don't choose to
[57:08] believe they don't want to believe
[57:10] cain had an opportunity to believe that
[57:12] he was right there in front of him and
[57:13] presented him
[57:14] he willfully walked the other way for
[57:15] that they will give an account
[57:18] amen the world will give an account
[57:21] people will the religious world will
[57:23] give an account
[57:25] amen because they chose to believe a lie
[57:28] amen they received not the love of the
[57:32] truth
[57:33] so god what does he do you take a simple
[57:37] thing like there was never nobody
[57:39] baptized in titles of father son the
[57:41] holy ghost
[57:42] oh my only in the name of jesus christ
[57:46] was anybody ever baptized you hear that
[57:49] and then what you do with that can
[57:51] determine your outcome
[57:54] because the proof of truth is right
[57:55] there in front of you
[57:57] you have to choose one or the other
[58:01] amen all the way down it doesn't matter
[58:04] what it is
[58:05] each one and every every part of it you
[58:07] have to choose
[58:08] whether you'll receive it or whether you
[58:10] would rather believe a lie
[58:12] but they had pleasure and
[58:13] unrighteousness
[58:16] people have pleasure in their
[58:17] unrighteousness
[58:21] how could they brother but i can't
[58:23] understand how
[58:25] pentecostal preachers and all them over
[58:27] in arizona amen told their people don't
[58:29] you go to brother madam's meetings
[58:31] or we'll excommunicate you i mean jesus
[58:33] is there discerning the thoughts and
[58:34] intents of the heart we've got the
[58:36] messiah signed there people are getting
[58:37] healed but don't you go there
[58:42] something terrible happened down in here
[58:44] folks
[58:46] they wouldn't want to confess to the
[58:48] truth
[58:49] but one day how many knows one day god's
[58:52] gonna say
[58:54] i told you behold i will send you elijah
[58:57] the prophet before the great and
[58:58] dreadful day of the lord
[59:00] and he'll turn the hearts of the
[59:01] children back to the hearts of the
[59:02] father now why wasn't your heart
[59:04] turned back what is your excuse
[59:08] huh
[59:12] that's something praise the lord
[59:16] amen and sin comes in because of
[59:19] unbelief and unconfession
[59:21] and then sin comes it's sin to disbelief
[59:24] how many believes it's good to confess
[59:26] if we confess with our mouth the lord
[59:28] jesus christ
[59:29] we shall be saved if we accept the truth
[59:34] you'll be all right but the truth comes
[59:37] to us
[59:38] on a daily basis amen
[59:41] let me say talk about this for a minute
[59:43] first you have to be honest with god
[59:46] but people will absolutely on the second
[59:48] part people will absolutely deceive them
[59:53] bible talks about people who will
[59:55] deceive themselves they would rather be
[59:57] deceived
[59:59] but to be honest with god is to let the
[1:00:02] holy spirit bring a light into your life
[1:00:07] it'll bring conviction into your life
[1:00:09] it'll make you honest
[1:00:11] brother i'm talked about after getting
[1:00:13] the holy ghost you know you'll take that
[1:00:14] i
[1:00:15] tire iron or whatever tool you borrowed
[1:00:17] that's sitting there you'll want to take
[1:00:18] that back home you want everything right
[1:00:21] how many ghost makes you want to have
[1:00:23] everything
[1:00:25] right everything honest
[1:00:29] christian wants to be honest that's one
[1:00:31] of the major things is if you want
[1:00:33] happiness and joy folks
[1:00:34] you have to have a clear conscience you
[1:00:36] have to be honest with god
[1:00:39] let him come down and shine it but if
[1:00:40] you're not honest with god
[1:00:42] you don't you don't have that
[1:00:43] relationship of lord i want to be
[1:00:45] pleasing to you
[1:00:46] you know right
[1:00:50] then you go to the other side and you
[1:00:52] lie to yourself
[1:00:54] well it doesn't really matter that was
[1:00:56] the lie that eve
[1:00:57] believed from the devil was god don't
[1:00:59] really care it doesn't really matter
[1:01:01] you're not surely gonna die amen
[1:01:06] it deviates from the word of god amen
[1:01:10] so you have to be honest with god you
[1:01:12] have to be honest with yourself
[1:01:13] before you'll be honest with others
[1:01:17] amen okay let's talk about
[1:01:23] confession of our sins to be honest with
[1:01:26] ourself
[1:01:28] remember the story brother bam gave of a
[1:01:30] woman that came to him and she was
[1:01:32] i don't know just how extreme it was but
[1:01:34] she was very nervous and upset all the
[1:01:36] time
[1:01:36] always tore up just nervous wreck
[1:01:41] and brother brandon went into his life
[1:01:42] and says you know you had an affair
[1:01:44] with a man a long time ago i've made
[1:01:47] that right i've confessed that to god
[1:01:49] let me tell you something how many knows
[1:01:50] if you see that
[1:01:51] if that had been any good if that
[1:01:53] confession would have been good
[1:01:56] huh god would rather man would have
[1:01:58] never saw it
[1:02:00] but i'm here i'm telling you here when
[1:02:02] you're not honest with yourself
[1:02:06] you will bring a lot of torment upon
[1:02:08] yourself
[1:02:10] amen she wasn't honest he was honest
[1:02:12] with god but she didn't have the
[1:02:13] audacity
[1:02:14] to confess it because that's the only
[1:02:17] way to get rid of
[1:02:18] guilt is to confess
[1:02:21] to make it right amen
[1:02:26] and she wasn't really honest because she
[1:02:28] knows she'd have known
[1:02:30] that she needs to tell her husband
[1:02:33] they're right
[1:02:35] but after think about it afterwards then
[1:02:37] it could be released
[1:02:39] and let me tell you something from what
[1:02:40] i understand she had been paid for by a
[1:02:42] lot of different ministers
[1:02:45] yet she was a sunday school teaching all
[1:02:47] these other things but she was prayed
[1:02:48] for and tried to overcome that but as
[1:02:50] long as that sin
[1:02:53] that untruthfulness that dishonesty was
[1:02:56] in there
[1:02:57] the devil had a right to hold on to her
[1:03:00] to grab grabber not let go no matter how
[1:03:03] much oil was poured upon her
[1:03:04] no matter how great the evangelist was
[1:03:07] praying for her
[1:03:08] how much he prayed that devil had the
[1:03:10] right to be there
[1:03:11] how many believes as long as we are not
[1:03:13] honest in our heart we have
[1:03:15] dishonesty hid we know this isn't right
[1:03:17] in our life we know that isn't right in
[1:03:19] our life
[1:03:20] come on now the devil has a right to be
[1:03:24] there
[1:03:26] and any preacher praying for you isn't
[1:03:28] going to do any good
[1:03:29] not until you make that thing right you
[1:03:32] have to be
[1:03:33] honest amen praise be to god
[1:03:39] oh yeah the song says nothing between
[1:03:42] me me and my savior amen let nothing
[1:03:45] between
[1:03:46] praise the lord brother branham many
[1:03:48] times
[1:03:50] if the prophet of god remember whenever
[1:03:52] he uh was under the investigation of the
[1:03:54] irs
[1:03:56] and he was under immense amount of
[1:03:57] pressure and they called again and they
[1:03:59] were on the phone
[1:04:00] and she says what do you want me to tell
[1:04:02] him and he ran outside the back of the
[1:04:04] building tell him i'm not in here
[1:04:07] maybe by the time maybe by the time that
[1:04:09] he was outside he wasn't in there
[1:04:11] anymore
[1:04:13] my his wife was godly and she says you
[1:04:15] know it was that just exactly right
[1:04:18] i mean whenever you ask yourself that
[1:04:20] question you already know it isn't
[1:04:23] exactly right come on folks
[1:04:27] and so guess what he went to pray for
[1:04:29] our baby and man he was so condemned
[1:04:32] what did brother branham do he tells us
[1:04:33] that story don't he
[1:04:35] even in his life story when he tells his
[1:04:37] life story talks about
[1:04:39] not obeying god and the price that his
[1:04:41] wife paid the price
[1:04:42] that his child paid now i want to read
[1:04:44] you that story perhaps after a while
[1:04:46] here in a minute
[1:04:47] but you know even his wife told him he
[1:04:49] says you know where we made our mistake
[1:04:51] she said perhaps if you would have
[1:04:52] obeyed god things would have been
[1:04:54] different
[1:04:56] that's quite something from your lovely
[1:04:58] wife coming back to you telling you that
[1:05:00] that if you've done the right thing
[1:05:02] it would be different folks and i want
[1:05:05] to tell you something if we're honest
[1:05:06] with ourselves sometimes
[1:05:08] we have to ask ourselves just how many
[1:05:11] times we miss
[1:05:12] the holy spirit how many times we miss
[1:05:16] the
[1:05:16] speaking of the holy spirit in our lives
[1:05:19] and we barge on
[1:05:20] hello and it's never good is it
[1:05:24] lord help us sure he confessed he knew
[1:05:26] he had made a mistake
[1:05:28] even going to africa when the holy
[1:05:29] spirit don't go up into the next land
[1:05:31] stay right here and
[1:05:32] he listened to the preachers and he got
[1:05:33] home sick and he was sick for years
[1:05:36] years of sickness because of didn't
[1:05:38] listen
[1:05:39] he confessed this he made it right he
[1:05:41] wasn't afraid to do that and even the
[1:05:43] bible talks about confess your sins
[1:05:45] one to another and god will heal you but
[1:05:47] as long as you have unconfessed sin you
[1:05:50] aren't truthful you on the side
[1:05:51] not honest with yourself folks i'm
[1:05:54] here to tell you that when you get
[1:05:55] honest with yourself the holy spirit
[1:05:57] will come in and he'll show you things
[1:05:59] amen there's two times two times that
[1:06:03] people
[1:06:04] will get honest amen
[1:06:08] one of them is perhaps when sickness
[1:06:11] comes upon them
[1:06:12] they want to get something from god and
[1:06:15] they begin to clean out their closets so
[1:06:17] to speak isn't that right
[1:06:18] know what the prophet taught if you want
[1:06:21] to get here first of all go back in your
[1:06:23] life
[1:06:23] and find out if there's anything that
[1:06:25] you haven't made right
[1:06:28] if you have there's something there then
[1:06:29] go back and make it right confess that
[1:06:32] thing be honest with yourself
[1:06:35] and make it right and then
[1:06:39] folks i'm here to tell you if people
[1:06:41] aren't honest with themselves most of
[1:06:43] the time they do when they come down to
[1:06:45] their deathbed
[1:06:47] it's a little late then but it's better
[1:06:50] than never
[1:06:52] huh folks i've had people come to me and
[1:06:54] confess
[1:06:56] you know things that i'd have thought
[1:06:58] they'd never confess people never admit
[1:07:00] they're wrong never
[1:07:01] try to make it right no no all through
[1:07:03] life i'm right you're wrong i'm right
[1:07:05] and come say look
[1:07:06] i apologize all of a sudden there's no
[1:07:10] reason for the bread to be proud anymore
[1:07:13] because you're fixing to go meet the
[1:07:14] maker there's only one thing it doesn't
[1:07:17] matter how humble you have to be
[1:07:18] you'll humble yourself you'll confess
[1:07:21] you'll make it right
[1:07:22] because you don't want to go over there
[1:07:24] with unconfessed sin
[1:07:26] you don't want to go over there in
[1:07:28] dishonesty
[1:07:30] because you might be dishonest here but
[1:07:32] when you get over there you better be
[1:07:33] right
[1:07:34] amen you have to be right to be there
[1:07:38] and to go there
[1:07:39] you have because there's nothing there's
[1:07:41] no dishonesty
[1:07:43] entering heaven there's no
[1:07:46] filth there's no dirt there's no other
[1:07:49] all of that it's got to be clean how
[1:07:51] many believe we got to be clean
[1:07:53] we've got to have a clean heart without
[1:07:56] holiness no man
[1:07:57] shall see god amen
[1:08:04] all right
[1:08:09] let me see if i have my story

[1:08:15] different ones that i want to talk about
[1:08:16] but

[1:10:19] on the book there's no mercy for you
[1:10:21] says do you want to peel your case

[1:10:25] peel my case he said well then
[1:10:26] you can go to the white zone judgment
[1:10:28] appeal your case there daniel curry said
[1:10:29] that he felt himself going through
[1:10:32] space for about an hour said he come
[1:10:34] into a place he got lighter
[1:10:35] and lighter and lighter and lighter so
[1:10:38] it further went the lighter it got
[1:10:41] it was a hundred times thousand times
[1:10:43] brighter than the sun ever signs he said
[1:10:44] he was trembling
[1:10:45] and said when he got into that night he
[1:10:47] heard a voice say
[1:10:49] was you perfect on earth
[1:10:53] he said no i wasn't perfect got the
[1:10:55] trembling
[1:10:56] did you always play on us with everybody
[1:11:00] he said and he said in another place he
[1:11:02] says you know he thought that he was a
[1:11:03] pretty good man until you come into that
[1:11:05] light
[1:11:06] and he realized that he wasn't quite as
[1:11:08] honest as what
[1:11:10] he had maybe thought he was amen i mean
[1:11:14] i said that's how it is when the holy
[1:11:15] spirit comes into your heart
[1:11:17] you find out oh my i'm not as good as i
[1:11:20] thought i was
[1:11:21] that's what the holy spirit will tell
[1:11:22] you it'll show you your faults
[1:11:26] all right he said i
[1:11:29] a few things come to mind that i wasn't
[1:11:31] just exactly honest about
[1:11:33] no i guess i wasn't honest said did you
[1:11:37] tell the truth in every case
[1:11:38] in your life said no i remembered some
[1:11:42] things i told that was just a little
[1:11:43] shady
[1:11:45] i wasn't truthful just exactly said did
[1:11:48] you ever take anything that did not
[1:11:50] belong to you
[1:11:51] anything money or anything else that
[1:11:52] didn't belong to you
[1:11:54] it was giannis see said he thought on
[1:11:57] earth
[1:11:57] he was pretty good but he was condemned
[1:12:00] he says no i've took things that didn't
[1:12:02] belong to me
[1:12:03] he said then you wasn't perfect he said
[1:12:06] no i wasn't perfect
[1:12:08] so he was just looking for any time for
[1:12:10] the blast to come from that great light
[1:12:11] from where the dove rested
[1:12:13] condemned said just then he heard a
[1:12:16] voice behind him that was sweeter than
[1:12:17] any mother's voice
[1:12:19] he'd ever heard said he turned to look
[1:12:22] and the sweetest face he'd ever saw
[1:12:23] sweeter than his mother's face
[1:12:25] was standing there with him and he said
[1:12:27] now father daniel curry stood
[1:12:29] for me down on earth it's true he wasn't
[1:12:32] perfect but he stood for me
[1:12:34] he stood for me on earth now i'm going
[1:12:36] to stand for him
[1:12:37] in heaven take all of his sins and put
[1:12:40] him over on my account
[1:12:42] amen who's going to stand for you on
[1:12:45] that day
[1:12:46] brother branham says amen
[1:12:49] now i wrote this down i said i wonder
[1:12:51] what will happen with politicians when
[1:12:53] they get over there and ask you to ask a
[1:12:54] question
[1:12:55] did you ever lie
[1:13:00] i wrote down here they'll confess yes
[1:13:03] that's about all i ever did
[1:13:07] and every time my mouth was open it was
[1:13:10] a lie
[1:13:11] come on people amen it's okay
[1:13:14] you all know there's a there's
[1:13:18] hardly any more liars than that they lie
[1:13:20] lie lie
[1:13:21] i've come to the conclusion a lot of
[1:13:23] times if they tell you one thing you can
[1:13:24] know it's the exact opposite
[1:13:27] is that right but that's the truth i was
[1:13:30] going to ask him did you ever lie
[1:13:33] they'll have to be honest you're going
[1:13:34] to have to confess
[1:13:36] oh they're going to confess to their sin
[1:13:37] they're going to have to confess to all
[1:13:39] of it
[1:13:39] every bit of it amen that's why i said
[1:13:43] about
[1:13:43] church members preachers all of them

[1:16:35] a calico dress
[1:16:36] once every three or four months i said
[1:16:38] i've worked and helped me to make
[1:16:40] you've worked and helped me to make a
[1:16:42] living for the kitties
[1:16:44] and the girls started crying and she
[1:16:45] went back out of the room
[1:16:47] the nurse i said why did you tell me i'd
[1:16:50] done wrong by calling me back and she
[1:16:51] says oh bill
[1:16:53] you've preached about it honey you've
[1:16:55] talked about it but said
[1:16:57] you don't realize what it is
[1:17:00] let me just let that sink in a little
[1:17:01] bit we don't realize
[1:17:03] what the holy spirit in our hearts
[1:17:06] really is
[1:17:09] where it'll take us i heard him say
[1:17:12] yesterday he says if you
[1:17:13] you you cannot go out of this world
[1:17:16] without the holy ghost
[1:17:17] amen and expect to be over there
[1:17:21] said i was being taken home by a group
[1:17:23] of white angels said
[1:17:25] it was like an oriental thing with great
[1:17:27] big birds flying from tree to tree
[1:17:32] amen just a beautiful place brother
[1:17:33] brown described it a little more in
[1:17:35] another place
[1:17:36] i believe with all of my heart her eyes
[1:17:38] come open to see the vision she was
[1:17:40] going into paradise
[1:17:42] oh my i don't know whether you believe
[1:17:44] this or not but i've stood by the
[1:17:45] bedside and seen
[1:17:47] saints going here they've talked to
[1:17:49] their loved ones that's going on years
[1:17:51] ago you've done that i just wondered
[1:17:54] this friend
[1:17:55] how not this is not doctrine it's just a
[1:17:57] thought and i wonder if that
[1:18:00] if at that morning when death is hard
[1:18:02] anyhow
[1:18:03] he said i was standing he kind of goes
[1:18:05] on another story i was standing by the
[1:18:06] side of a man a few years ago
[1:18:08] he'd been a christian for a long time
[1:18:10] and he says he talked me said billy
[1:18:12] i said is everything all right it's mr
[1:18:14] blood
[1:18:16] blood cell he was about 80 years old
[1:18:20] said oh everything's okay really said i
[1:18:22] want to see my lord so bad
[1:18:24] my life is all worn and gone said i want
[1:18:26] to see him
[1:18:27] he's he's standing there talking to me
[1:18:30] his wife there

[1:18:44] honey you're
[1:18:46] said i'm not beside myself said sister
[1:18:49] she been gone for years and i just
[1:18:52] wonder
[1:18:52] if at that great hour when we're going
[1:18:54] down god knows that this soul is coming
[1:18:57] from
[1:18:58] the body like a tooth being extracted
[1:19:00] from your mouth
[1:19:01] i wonder if god don't say to mother go
[1:19:03] on down and stand by jordan
[1:19:05] your son's coming over this morning
[1:19:08] amen awesome praise the lord
[1:19:12] in our eyes when it's breaking from that
[1:19:14] natural world into the spiritual world
[1:19:16] then it becomes a visual there and we
[1:19:19] actually see them
[1:19:20] standing amen
[1:19:24] i thought she was entering paradise and
[1:19:26] i said what did it look like honey
[1:19:28] said oh it was so beautiful
[1:19:31] she said what is it honey she said i
[1:19:33] must hurry back she said i guess you
[1:19:35] know
[1:19:36] why i'm going oh that's what hurt me
[1:19:40] and i said yes she said you should have
[1:19:43] never listened
[1:19:44] to mother and i said i know it

[1:19:49] to your mother i said honey someday
[1:19:51] i will make it up for it so help me she
[1:19:53] said bill
[1:19:55] if you have went ahead and done what god

[1:19:59] different today

[1:22:12] payment on the rifle
[1:22:15] i mean let me tell you something if we
[1:22:16] loved each other more like that there'd
[1:22:18] be less

[1:22:22] each other like that
[1:22:25] amen you don't know how made that made
[1:22:28] me feel
[1:22:28] she was a real girl and she said another
[1:22:32] thing
[1:22:33] i want to apologize to you
[1:22:37] i said she said i did something wrong
[1:22:42] amen of all things
[1:22:45] her sister hoped to say of all the
[1:22:46] things to bring up
[1:22:48] she comes back and apologizes
[1:22:54] and i said what's that she said i kept
[1:22:57] something from you

[1:23:20] when i got
[1:23:20] she got to fort wayne she had to get
[1:23:22] another pair of stockings
[1:23:24] but she told me she said there in her
[1:23:26] dying hour she said
[1:23:27] bill them was for older women i gave it
[1:23:29] to your mother
[1:23:30] she said that she kept she said that
[1:23:34] i kept that from you because i didn't
[1:23:35] want to hurt your feelings
[1:23:37] that you got oh my you don't know how
[1:23:40] that made me feel
[1:23:42] then i said bless your heart honey

[1:23:56] now listen he says we don't believe that
[1:24:01] you don't believe anything you can
[1:24:02] believe anything you want to but i don't
[1:24:04] believe that a christian dies there's no
[1:24:05] scripture for it
[1:24:06] he that hears my words and believeth on
[1:24:08] him that sent me has passed from death
[1:24:10] unto life
[1:24:11] i am the resurrection and life he said
[1:24:12] amen
[1:24:14] and i said honey i'll take your body out
[1:24:16] here and bury it and so forth
[1:24:18] now notice that she raised up them bony
[1:24:20] hands and embraced around me
[1:24:22] i kissed her goodbye and she closed her
[1:24:24] eyes and went to meet god
[1:24:26] that was my last date with my wife and
[1:24:29] by the grace of god i'm trying my best
[1:24:31] to make double time that's the reason
[1:24:34] that i try to preach so hard day and
[1:24:36] night
[1:24:37] in one campaign after another trying to
[1:24:40] make up
[1:24:41] for the time that i lost what brought me
[1:24:44] to this message was the thought that
[1:24:46] she would come back and she would be
[1:24:48] that
[1:24:50] honest that really all she had
[1:24:54] everything else was made right
[1:24:56] everything else was good but she just
[1:24:58] kept something from her husband
[1:25:00] that simple didn't want to hurt him in
[1:25:03] the first place
[1:25:04] right didn't want to hurt his feelings
[1:25:06] that he had done something wrong
[1:25:07] but she kept that from him
[1:25:11] just a little bit of perhaps dishonesty
[1:25:14] and she wanted to be honest with you on
[1:25:17] that little issue
[1:25:19] i wonder if we tonight search our hearts
[1:25:24] how many knows when you get over there
[1:25:26] it's going to be the little thing
[1:25:28] when you get to the door of death you
[1:25:29] want every little thing
[1:25:32] made right you want to be totally honest
[1:25:35] in your heart
[1:25:36] we don't want to get to daniel curry and
[1:25:38] get over there i mean that's not an
[1:25:40] excuse well i'll wait and
[1:25:42] let him cover it hello
[1:25:45] i believe is an example that here we
[1:25:48] want to make sure that
[1:25:49] everything we do is on us we're honest
[1:25:52] with each other
[1:25:52] husband and wife between each other
[1:25:54] you're honest open have everything right
[1:25:56] she came back and apologized come from
[1:25:59] heaven a beautiful place and says i want
[1:26:01] to apologize
[1:26:02] that i kept that from you she was an
[1:26:04] honest woman
[1:26:06] let's be honest people amen heaven's
[1:26:09] gonna be filled
[1:26:10] with absolutely completely
[1:26:14] totally honest people
[1:26:17] god bless you let's then
[1:26:22] musicians just hold on for a minute i'm
[1:26:24] going to do what brother
[1:26:25] our brother did let's bow our heads
[1:26:28] we're going to have just a little bit of
[1:26:29] a prayer yet before we
[1:26:31] get into a few songs perhaps
[1:26:34] i want to ask each and every one of you
[1:26:36] because i'll tell you one thing that the
[1:26:37] lord does with me is
[1:26:40] he'll bring things up in my mind i'm
[1:26:43] sure he probably does you
[1:26:45] there may be a lot of people sitting the
[1:26:47] holy spirit bring things up or out there
[1:26:50] in the
[1:26:50] radio land so to speak he'll bring
[1:26:53] things up behind and he'll show you
[1:26:55] things that you really ought to make
[1:26:56] right
[1:26:58] and a lot of times we'll make excuses in
[1:27:01] that right
[1:27:02] we'll justify ourselves but the holy
[1:27:03] spirit's sweet enough
[1:27:05] to keep bringing that up let me tell you
[1:27:08] something it's a whole lot better to
[1:27:10] live
[1:27:10] free you don't even really have to
[1:27:13] apologize
[1:27:14] maybe you don't really have to make it
[1:27:15] right but it bothers you
