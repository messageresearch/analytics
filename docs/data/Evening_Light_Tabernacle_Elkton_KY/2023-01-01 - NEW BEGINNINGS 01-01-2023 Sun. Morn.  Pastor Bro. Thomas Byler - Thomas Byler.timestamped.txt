[0:00] which are behind
[0:02] and reaching forth unto those things
[0:05] with the calling of God
[0:07] what's the meaning of the word you can
[0:09] come to my mind
[0:11] to think about Paul speaking here about
[0:14] two things here
[0:15] amen and that is forgetting those things
[0:19] that are in the past isn't that right
[0:23] or that are behind us amen and as we
[0:27] know that and and maybe Wednesday I
[0:30] don't know if the Lord will just inspire
[0:31] me to go that way this coming Wednesday
[0:33] but we may talk about uh being Eternal
[0:37] creatures amen creatures of Eternity
[0:39] Amen brother bam said a lot about that
[0:42] we make over that but this morning I
[0:44] want to talk more about us as creatures
[0:47] of time amen and in our natural realm we
[0:51] know that we have times and Seasons like
[0:54] Ecclesiastes says to everything there is
[0:56] a season and a time to every purpose
[0:59] under the heaven there's a time to be
[1:01] born a time to die a time to plant in
[1:04] other words there's a beginning there's
[1:05] an end
[1:07] just about everything there's a
[1:08] beginning and there is an end amen
[1:12] amen to time the plant and so forth now
[1:15] notice verse 10 you know because to me
[1:18] to me keeping up with this a lot of
[1:21] times uh you know there's a lot of so
[1:24] many different Beginnings there's so
[1:26] many different endings isn't it right uh
[1:28] that it's a lot to keep up with uh
[1:32] Solomon said in verse 10's I have seen
[1:34] after he talks about all these things he
[1:36] says I've seen the true Veil The which
[1:38] God has given to the sons of men to be
[1:41] exercised
[1:42] by that by that in so many things that
[1:46] we do even in the beginning and the end
[1:48] amen that it begins and it be it becomes
[1:51] and is a travail amen
[1:54] and so
[1:56] uh also you know the the one one of the
[1:59] first places that we find the a a a a a
[2:02] beginning was of course in Genesis when
[2:04] God said with the
[2:07] very first
[2:08] verse that he ever wrote was he said in
[2:12] the beginning Amen in the beginning God
[2:15] created the heavens and the Earth
[2:18] then the prophet of God stated anything
[2:20] that has a beginning
[2:23] that's right has an end anything that
[2:26] has a begin in the end how many knows
[2:28] shall be an end to this world
[2:30] it'll change from one thing to another
[2:32] amen everything that is a beginning has
[2:34] an end and that's why I like to think
[2:36] about what God and the Holy Spirit is
[2:38] and us as Mortals amen us as Mortals we
[2:42] have a there's uh we have a beginning
[2:44] and uh let me just ask you this quiz
[2:48] question this morning a little bit
[2:50] uh when did you start
[2:52] when do we start conception at Birth
[2:58] somebody's at the foundation of the
[3:00] world
[3:02] okay
[3:05] well
[3:08] let me just read what the prophet of God
[3:10] says now notice he says God has allotted
[3:13] that his scripture from the beginning
[3:15] now notice he says in these
[3:18] talking about something else here for a
[3:20] minute we'll get to the point but let me
[3:21] pick this up while we're on it before
[3:24] there was any time notice he is the
[3:26] Eternal one these things happening now
[3:28] are only the attributes of God's
[3:32] thinking
[3:33] at first it has to be a thought
[3:38] man and then a word
[3:41] when they thought
[3:44] is expressed it becomes a word and then
[3:47] when it's spoken it has to happen
[3:50] not yours or mine but God's
[3:53] we can think anything and you might say
[3:56] I'm going to do this tomorrow we may be
[3:58] taking you seeing you at the funeral
[3:59] tomorrow we don't know that right but
[4:02] with God when he thinks something and
[4:04] when he says something it has to happen
[4:08] you can count on it let me just like I
[4:10] said you know whenever you go through
[4:12] these things and the holy spirit's
[4:13] dealing with you it's just amazing the
[4:15] things that pull in but I don't want to
[4:17] go on too much of something other but it
[4:19] still fits in and that is when he said
[4:21] that God a lot of scriptures how many
[4:23] knows that he had a lot of scriptures
[4:25] for every age including our age
[4:29] the whole history of the world God has
[4:32] already wrote it all out
[4:35] amen
[4:37] the whole mind when you think about the
[4:38] the main thing that we think about when
[4:40] we think about the allotted word that's
[4:42] been wrote was the seven Church ages in
[4:44] the first three chapters of Revelation
[4:45] he knew what each age would do what they
[4:48] would go through and how they would have
[4:49] to give their lives now they would be
[4:51] killed isn't that right
[4:53] he says be thou faithful unto death he
[4:56] knew they would die you know and so
[4:57] forth all of it all the way down to
[4:59] lyanna see originally creates with good
[5:01] and so forth but not in Revelations 18
[5:04] he talked about that being an angel
[5:05] calling us up out of there
[5:09] amen praise be to God how many is glad
[5:13] doesn't that do something to you know
[5:15] you're not part of the layout is here
[5:17] but you're part of the ones that are
[5:18] called out
[5:20] if you can see yourself in that part of
[5:22] the word
[5:24] you ought to have a hard time keeping
[5:25] your bench
[5:27] why because if you're on the bad side
[5:28] I'll tell you what there ain't nothing
[5:30] to be happy about man one time two men
[5:32] came out of the meeting up by the
[5:34] bantams they listen to him preach on the
[5:35] eagle and the Buzzard and he said he
[5:37] called me a buzzard
[5:41] ah another guy says really he called me
[5:44] an eagle
[5:47] it just depends on how perceiving what
[5:49] you are what it identified you
[5:52] oh Mom when I think about the revelation
[5:54] of God and what he just shows us and
[5:56] what we know and how
[5:58] how that make you happy to know who you
[6:00] are and what you are
[6:03] amen here's a lot of this word to every
[6:05] Asian we have to be a part we have to be
[6:08] a part of that word
[6:10] and if you are a part of that word that
[6:13] means that you were part of his thoughts
[6:15] before not at the foundation but before
[6:18] the foundation of the world before I
[6:20] never let the first word like that
[6:23] he had thought of you
[6:25] huh before that
[6:30] because you know I got the writing this
[6:32] down about well our first beginning was
[6:34] at conception or our beginning was at
[6:36] first you know because that's when you
[6:38] take the Breath of Life That's when your
[6:39] life begins and we know the Bible says
[6:41] you know before you was born I knew you
[6:43] into your mother's womb booms so I guess
[6:47] but God mothers woman I thought you know
[6:50] that was still not our beginning
[6:52] I begin to think about the prophet of
[6:54] God said and he says you know Therefore
[6:57] your name was in his thinking that's how
[7:00] you have eternal life you can't have it
[7:03] any other way
[7:08] you won't have it any other way if you
[7:10] weren't part of that thinking but the
[7:12] man says you don't even stand a chance
[7:15] there's no way that you're ever going to
[7:18] be there if you wasn't in that thinking
[7:21] because he wrote your name down in the
[7:23] book of life before the foundation of
[7:25] the world
[7:26] and that's what he came to do he came to
[7:28] redeem those pains that were on the book
[7:30] by the man says and he says when that
[7:32] last name is redeemed he's going to come
[7:34] and receive his purchase possession
[7:39] amen you talk about a beginning
[7:43] ah
[7:44] and you know that's the glory of it
[7:47] foreign
[7:48] that's the most glorious beginning
[7:51] was to have been in his thoughts
[7:53] amen
[7:55] praise the Lord
[7:57] your name
[8:03] amen that's how you have eternal life
[8:05] otherwise you you can't just can't say
[8:07] well I belong to church
[8:09] I knew this and
[8:12] the kingdom of man at the beginning is
[8:15] always enthusiasm and it's always great
[8:17] and it's always wonderful you know most
[8:22] is out
[8:27] and if that's the kingdoms governments
[8:29] think about America how we work how we
[8:32] thrived and looking at the glory
[8:33] [Applause]
[8:34] even Trump said uh make America great
[8:37] again
[8:38] sometimes at one time Terry there wasn't
[8:41] a government in the world could defeat
[8:43] us not Japan
[8:46] but at the end notice how that was at
[8:47] the beginning now at the end is always
[8:49] sad just the life that we live we get to
[8:51] be 20 years old we can't move our hands
[8:53] can't move our legs hey man you're so
[8:55] weak we can't do anything anymore amen
[8:57] and we take the last breath that we die
[8:59] it's a sad story
[9:06] start straight anything normally mortal
[9:10] starts great
[9:12] anybody that has any gills huh oh I'm
[9:15] gonna do this this is gonna be wonderful
[9:17] this is gonna be great
[9:22] time it all faces a lot
[9:24] we all been there
[9:27] amen
[9:30] kingdoms
[9:32] oh my
[9:35] brother bam says in one of his message
[9:37] we're standing tonight upon the Bremen
[9:39] watching come to pass
[9:41] for two great teens
[9:43] and those two great teams are these one
[9:45] of them is the ending of History other
[9:47] than the one they use the ending of time
[9:49] and many great mating men down Through
[9:51] the Ages have long to see this hour that
[9:53] we are now approaching
[9:55] amen
[9:59] Micah turn this one on would you well
[10:02] turn this one on a little bit there's
[10:04] something I wanted to play and I was
[10:06] listening to it and I'm going to kind of
[10:07] just
[10:08] I try to keep my thought here
[10:11] two things here but there's something I
[10:13] wanted to play brother bam said
[10:15] and it's concerning our future
[10:17] concerning the coming year and so forth
[10:19] and he was preaching on the Feast of the
[10:21] trumpets 1963.
[10:23] I thought that it should be our goal
[10:25] because one place he said
[10:27] um
[10:28] let me just
[10:29] see if I can pull that one
[10:32] quote up where he makes a statement I
[10:34] don't mean it to be that way but I
[10:37] believe that we're living at the closing
[10:38] close so close to the coming of the Lord
[10:40] Jesus
[10:42] that I have to take every
[10:44] advantage of every minute that I have
[10:46] when I have the people together
[10:48] so pick that out when he speaks then he
[10:51] talks about our assembling together and
[10:52] the privilege that is and so forth
[10:55] so now we're going to try to I'm going
[10:56] to go back 10 seconds
[10:59] and see where we're at all right ready
[11:02] I don't I mean it to be that
[11:05] I believe that we're living at so close
[11:09] to the coming of Jesus that I have to
[11:12] take advantage
[11:13] should have been a minute
[11:15] the people together
[11:16] and I was thinking I was just driving
[11:19] out
[11:20] a while ago being out for a little
[11:22] prayer just for entering the pulpit is
[11:25] any real sincere clergymen does I was
[11:29] thinking
[11:30] um
[11:31] you know we're having the most glorious
[11:33] time when we meet here together that's
[11:35] right and the people Gathering From many
[11:38] states right in here now from where from
[11:41] way away hundreds and hundreds of miles
[11:43] and we have SIMPLE together to
[11:46] but
[11:48] there will come a time soon when this
[11:51] will be just upon memory that is right
[11:53] these times will be taken away from us
[11:56] so therefore we must do
[11:59] that we know how to do to make this
[12:02] every minute
[12:04] now
[12:07] amen how many believe that
[12:10] so you know in this coming year I don't
[12:12] really look for greater
[12:14] uh liberties
[12:17] politically no I've expected to go the
[12:20] other direction even the brother bam
[12:21] talked about what we do this morning be
[12:24] a fond memory
[12:26] so don't expect that to happen but what
[12:28] we do but about him he says you know we
[12:30] come together and people think that
[12:32] we're coming together he talked to used
[12:34] to use it people think we're coming back
[12:36] for eternity or something he says well I
[12:38] just preached it long but then it makes
[12:40] a statement I'm trying to take long and
[12:41] I'm trying to take every opportunity
[12:43] when we have the people together to do
[12:45] all that we can for the kingdom of God
[12:47] Amen
[12:49] praise the Lord so let's go back on our
[12:51] thought amen because that's what we want
[12:52] to do are you with me just coming here
[12:54] let's do all that we can for the kingdom
[12:56] of God that's the only thing that counts
[12:58] the only thing that matters
[13:00] amen I'm going to say something else
[13:03] comes to mind you know in the last few
[13:04] service and and so forth now with when
[13:07] the preachers preaching and everybody
[13:08] gets into disservice
[13:11] I like that amen and when he says
[13:13] something that's worthwhile you know I
[13:15] noticed it with Brother Brad preaching
[13:16] and so forth you know people applaud and
[13:19] applaud the word of God not the man of
[13:21] God but the word of God Amen and I like
[13:23] to see that happen and let's keep going
[13:25] that way amen don't let the spirit
[13:28] dampen and so forth let's keep pressing
[13:30] right on
[13:31] amen
[13:34] Hallelujah so we think about these
[13:37] things that's happening now they're only
[13:38] in attributes of God's thinking you know
[13:40] it was a had to be a word first amen
[13:42] before it was a thought amen
[13:45] so we see not many Fitness just thought
[13:46] about how that if you have eternal life
[13:48] you can't have it no other way I mean it
[13:51] had to be with him then there's only one
[13:54] eternal life and it always existed and
[13:56] you now here's wherever the punch line
[13:58] and you in his mind existed amen and his
[14:04] mind existed before there was a world
[14:06] that's the reason that he said he chose
[14:08] you before the foundation of the world
[14:10] Ill Mind it isn't what we think or
[14:13] somebody else thinks it's what God
[14:16] thinks
[14:17] hey man I mean it's that it's not what
[14:21] you make yourself or try to make
[14:22] yourself or the choices you make you
[14:24] realize that God knew that you would
[14:26] choose that and he put that into you to
[14:29] be able to choose it
[14:31] it was him all along
[14:34] it's it's
[14:36] okay that has begun I got you
[14:43] he has started give us the beginning he
[14:47] started to work in you what is he gonna
[14:49] do he's gonna go through the middle of
[14:50] it if they gives you trials and
[14:52] tribulations
[14:54] but he's gonna take you through he says
[14:56] he will also perform it
[15:01] oh my every other kingdom is gonna fall
[15:05] the kingdom
[15:08] hypocrisy
[15:12] you boy I'll tell you what it gets my
[15:15] goat not only get political but the ones
[15:16] that's called others Liars are the liars
[15:19] isn't that right and nobody sees it just
[15:21] like nobody sees it nobody don't believe
[15:23] anything you're just because like
[15:25] brother dance says please Chase
[15:26] something you're not fine people are
[15:27] believing not diesel oh boy lies a lie
[15:32] amen but oh my buddies falling but
[15:35] aren't you glad that you received I have
[15:37] received a kingdom that shall never pass
[15:40] away
[15:41] Hallelujah
[15:43] all Earthly kingdoms fall there have
[15:46] been so many starts and so many
[15:48] stops but to this there's not gonna be
[15:51] any stopping amen praise God we have all
[15:55] kinds of different places that we start
[15:56] we start when we take that first breath
[15:58] we wait for that first time that that
[16:00] maybe I'll take the first step
[16:02] oh no we're so happy as parents when
[16:05] that little one takes that first step
[16:07] but then what from there so oh did you
[16:10] hear what he said it's she said Mommy
[16:11] first or she said mommy or daddy first
[16:15] oh we always look for the first word
[16:17] coming on I'm always looking for this
[16:18] first thing the beginning of so many
[16:20] things first day of school
[16:22] huh
[16:24] or get married the first day of marriage
[16:26] not glorious and it's a honeymoon for a
[16:29] while
[16:31] is that right and you gotta go through
[16:34] that and let me tell you something how
[16:35] many beliefs that you got to work at
[16:36] keeping your marriage a honeymoon
[16:39] that's right because the devil tries to
[16:41] get in there and destroy it
[16:43] oh my so many things
[16:46] praise the Lord
[16:48] first walk marriage and so forth
[16:50] but listen it all comes to an end all
[16:53] will comes to oh it comes to not so many
[16:56] things come to not but not when God does
[16:58] something
[17:00] men
[17:01] praise be to God now notice
[17:04] this is what mother Brown said here
[17:06] in
[17:09] um Shalom I believe in boss he said we
[17:11] don't
[17:12] we're not the kind of people that look
[17:14] back
[17:15] no
[17:16] because you're going to wreck up
[17:18] if you do notice we are not we're
[17:21] looking forward to see where we're going
[17:23] see that which is in the past Paul said
[17:26] we're forgetting those things which you
[17:27] are in the past we press our smart for
[17:30] the prize of the high calling in Christ
[17:32] Jesus and that's what we want to do amen
[17:36] praise the Lord that's what I'm looking
[17:38] I'm looking forward now to what I will
[17:40] do in this coming year
[17:43] amen
[17:45] notice how the Bible talks about how
[17:47] Jesus said you know there's a lot of
[17:49] people that have a lot of enthusiasm
[17:51] they have a lot of rejoicing and then
[17:53] when the word falls on them and so forth
[17:54] the spirit falls on them but if it
[17:56] doesn't go all the way down and it falls
[17:58] into Rocky places it goes for a little
[18:00] while and then what does it say and
[18:02] Withers away
[18:05] a lot of people
[18:06] when they're going it's hard and the
[18:08] persecution happens send people with her
[18:10] away
[18:13] oh my
[18:15] but I'm looking forward to the
[18:17] impairment of the kingdom of God doing
[18:18] more all that I can from the kingdom of
[18:21] God notice how that Jesus says you know
[18:22] if you abide in me and my word abide in
[18:25] you you'll ask what you will and it
[18:26] shall be done he talks about you know
[18:28] that we're devoting Barefoot fruit
[18:30] amen and if you don't bear fruit Jesus
[18:32] said he purges that he he actually trims
[18:35] you off Cuts you off and you're wither
[18:36] but if you do bear some fruit what does
[18:39] he do he prunes you so that you'll have
[18:41] more fruit
[18:43] an experience of fruit isn't that we
[18:46] want I don't know about Jupiter this
[18:47] morning but I want I want more fruit I
[18:49] want more dedication I want a greater
[18:51] Holy Ghost
[18:52] [Music]
[18:56] I want more of Jesus more and more and
[18:59] more I was thinking this morning as I
[19:00] was studying I said you know the Holy
[19:02] Ghost is addictive it ought to be
[19:04] addictive amen I got a level but I gotta
[19:07] have more
[19:09] in that I wasn't back in the bar days
[19:12] whenever you were drinking no simulation
[19:13] you drink until you'd fall over
[19:16] I don't know you didn't have sense
[19:18] enough to quit
[19:20] you felt so good you wanted to drink
[19:21] more until you were throwing up on your
[19:24] partner or whatever it wasn't no fun
[19:26] but let me tell you the Holy Ghost said
[19:28] man we can have so much and Canal you
[19:30] can act like those did on the day of
[19:32] Pentecost and they staggered around and
[19:34] they thought that they were drunk
[19:36] went to God this be a year that morons
[19:39] get drunk
[19:40] on the spirit
[19:43] I mean it's more of them
[19:46] I'm glad and I thought this message when
[19:48] I thought about this message I thought
[19:50] about this I am
[19:53] so glad that even as we have new years
[19:57] we have new moons we have uh new months
[20:00] we have new seasons we have the the
[20:02] beginning of summer we have the
[20:03] beginning of winter we have the
[20:04] beginning of fall we're at the beginning
[20:05] of an ending of spring and all these
[20:07] other Beginnings aren't you glad that
[20:09] God is a god of new beginnings
[20:16] oh we at this new beginning I like I
[20:19] like this thing I'll probably go through
[20:20] this if I have time probably don't have
[20:22] but you know the new birth and so forth
[20:24] when we get together with the Holy Ghost
[20:25] we get the new birth but so much in this
[20:27] world I don't think amen sometimes it
[20:29] takes it out of you doesn't it I mean it
[20:32] drains you up the spirit and we need bad
[20:34] neighbors we need many refillings so
[20:37] many times we need a refilling of the
[20:39] Holy Ghost I need more of that again
[20:41] amen this week it's been kind of a rough
[20:43] week with God of your spirit again
[20:45] they better did stare for you
[20:48] because I'm here to tell you this
[20:50] morning there was people again
[20:52] don't have no New Beginnings do this
[20:54] when he even repented went out and cried
[20:56] amen and tried to repent but there was
[20:58] no repentance there was no new beginning
[21:00] to do this
[21:04] that was horrible
[21:07] imagine having been that Deacon's
[21:09] daughter that brother Madam says God's
[21:10] calling you lady God's calling you amen
[21:12] and she was embarrassed she walked out
[21:14] and said don't you ever call on me like
[21:15] that again my Daddy's got enough
[21:17] religion for all of us you embarrassed
[21:19] me she went out there but if I'm seeing
[21:21] him on the street later that year or a
[21:23] year later she was out on the street
[21:24] somewhere dressed like a prostitute
[21:26] drinking whiskey smoking
[21:29] he addressed her she said here you want
[21:32] some drinks she said no I don't drink
[21:34] don't you should be ought to be ashamed
[21:35] of yourself offering
[21:37] she wasn't ashamed she had no shame
[21:40] she said see that time you were right he
[21:42] was calling me and I turned him down
[21:44] huh
[21:46] he wasn't on me but I turned it down
[21:49] and since then I could see my mother
[21:51] though flying hell laughs
[21:54] no matter how much she would wanted to
[21:56] not be that way she could never come
[21:57] back
[21:58] what a horrible set hey never be
[22:01] do not have a new song Not Another
[22:04] Chance
[22:07] amen
[22:08] or that other lady Catholic woman I
[22:11] believe one time he was witnessing out
[22:13] on the street and the lady come up there
[22:14] and says I wouldn't have my cow follow
[22:16] your religion
[22:18] a couple hours later they called him to
[22:21] the hospital
[22:22] she was calling him tell that man sorry
[22:24] so that man I want to apologize tell
[22:26] that man to come pray for me she was
[22:28] calling for him she said she knew she
[22:29] said the wrong thing
[22:32] and she was being painted and acting
[22:34] before he got there
[22:37] she was dead
[22:39] she says her freckles on her face stood
[22:42] out because of the excruciating pain
[22:43] that she went through
[22:45] screaming for help screaming for mercy
[22:47] and so forth there wasn't no mercy
[22:49] there's Mercy this morning
[22:57] huh
[22:58] praise be to God
[23:01] let me go
[23:02] come on can I
[23:05] oh my so now notice looking forward
[23:11] there is let me just stop there
[23:14] looking forward the Holy Ghost is there
[23:18] when you're looking forward
[23:20] I'm telling you right now I can't
[23:23] imagine being a slave like brother Matt
[23:24] says when you're a slave there's no hope
[23:26] there's no future for you all you got to
[23:28] do is work hard for somebody and all you
[23:31] get is a place to sleep and some food to
[23:33] eat close to where that's it that's all
[23:35] you got
[23:37] but people without hope without a future
[23:39] it looks bleak
[23:41] even if you don't have any natural goals
[23:43] here hello it's kind of bleak
[23:46] huh
[23:47] all you're going to do is be lazy be a
[23:49] couch potato be worthless
[23:51] you need to have goals you need to have
[23:52] ambitions
[23:53] isn't that right
[23:56] but you got to have something to look
[23:57] forward to
[23:59] oh my
[24:01] God and as we Face these New Year we're
[24:03] facing both as I have read Darkness and
[24:06] Light
[24:07] Isaiah 63 says you know there's gross
[24:10] Darkness upon the people
[24:12] but there will be light for you amen
[24:16] now notice
[24:17] David speaking you trust in the Lord put
[24:19] your confidence in him Isaiah said Gross
[24:21] darkness is he coming upon the people
[24:23] but for the church to rise and shine for
[24:27] the glory of thy light has come
[24:30] amen
[24:31] so we faced this year just like we do
[24:35] all years
[24:36] well I thought that's good for us isn't
[24:38] it
[24:40] a regret of our mistakes in the past
[24:44] huh
[24:46] and I wrote down here you know what if
[24:48] you would what kind of person would you
[24:49] do be
[24:50] what kind of what kind of a tormented
[24:52] person would you be if you would just
[24:54] look at your mistakes
[24:56] that you've made
[24:58] the past years
[25:00] huh
[25:02] you could be depressed wouldn't you
[25:06] if you focused on them
[25:09] amen
[25:10] but aren't you so glad that your past
[25:14] can be erased
[25:16] there's an eraser it's not turning a new
[25:20] Leaf it's not turning a new patch
[25:26] but the blood of Jesus Christ
[25:29] your sins dropped in that blood and that
[25:31] bleach
[25:34] it can be gone
[25:36] no more to be remembered
[25:38] cause I'll tell you this right now when
[25:40] you get old your your past if you ain't
[25:42] got it right will haunt you you'll sit
[25:45] in that rocking chair for hours and
[25:46] you'll think about what you did the way
[25:49] that you lived what you've done all your
[25:51] life
[25:52] we that get older know what I'm talking
[25:55] about
[25:55] you think about more when you get older
[25:58] and you realize you
[26:01] have many think about those
[26:03] threats that you have
[26:06] God help us this year not to have as
[26:08] many regrets as what we didn't know yet
[26:10] for years pass
[26:14] amen
[26:16] it'll it's what haunts people it's what
[26:18] people put their guns to their head
[26:19] forward it bothers them people's past
[26:22] bothers them
[26:25] Amen brother Sean probably knows people
[26:28] military you know people that have
[26:29] killed people people that have you know
[26:31] done things they shouldn't perhaps in
[26:33] the military or whatever it was
[26:35] huh because sometimes military people do
[26:37] things unjust
[26:39] huh well I shot that person but I
[26:42] accidentally got that child beside him
[26:44] you didn't celebrate the blood
[26:46] when you know not just military people
[26:48] but anybody that sins against God
[26:50] anybody that does wrong needs that has
[26:53] that regret and then he's purging him
[26:54] and then it's not going to happen but
[26:56] the man says turning a new page like
[26:58] that girl that was in the insane asylum
[26:59] they tried this they tried Anonymous
[27:01] here and there amen she still had the
[27:03] problem no matter what they did he
[27:04] wouldn't fix it and he said turning a
[27:06] new page ain't gonna do it
[27:09] ain't gonna do it
[27:14] amen he's gonna take the blood of Jesus
[27:16] Christ
[27:17] we have regrets that we made and so
[27:19] forth in the past and may looking
[27:21] forward for a future of the Glorious
[27:23] Light of Christ amen but no doubt if we
[27:27] live through this year we'll find many
[27:29] mistakes that we have made
[27:31] amen
[27:32] sure but now let's see this morning God
[27:34] help me not to make so many mistakes
[27:36] somebody's with me help me not do things
[27:39] that are displeasing to the spirit
[27:41] but let me go through this year more
[27:43] pleasing to the Lord more yielded to
[27:46] Christ
[27:48] oh my
[27:51] Hallelujah
[27:54] I don't care if we belong today if we
[27:56] have to move it up to 3 30 is that okay
[27:58] let's just have church
[28:00] is that okay because I'm thinking here
[28:02] of where I'm at and where I want to be
[28:03] in the time in the communion yet
[28:06] and I just got to say stop that Thomas
[28:08] take your time
[28:11] let the Holy Spirit have his way
[28:14] amen we got a lot to make up for
[28:18] Amen Brother Brad can help me maybe with
[28:20] that amen amen all right
[28:28] many mistakes that we'll have made again
[28:31] because that goes along with the pro and
[28:33] con that's the law of average that we
[28:36] live by here on Earth and we're so glad
[28:37] to have a mediator who sits at the right
[28:39] hand of God to make intercessions when
[28:42] we are willing to admit our mistakes
[28:43] that we have done wrong when he forgives
[28:46] them he's full of grace and mercy to
[28:48] forgive us of those mistakes amen I need
[28:51] to laugh for that now this grows
[28:53] Darkness I wish to speak on it for just
[28:54] a minute there is so much of it in the
[28:56] world today and growing darker and
[28:59] darker all the time
[29:01] each year we find that the world has
[29:04] started our spirit systems because
[29:06] they're groping in darkness there's more
[29:08] than
[29:10] amen now those who will not turn to
[29:13] light
[29:14] it's only one thing that I can say to
[29:16] them this coming year that they're going
[29:18] to stoop darker and darker as the year
[29:20] goes on
[29:22] what the about the Bible says you want
[29:24] sin
[29:26] how is that anymore
[29:29] sin will go plump to the core until the
[29:32] skies catch on fire something to that
[29:34] extent it'll get worse and worse I think
[29:36] it was worse and worse until the skies
[29:38] catch on fire
[29:42] I mean as you can see that not politics
[29:44] it's getting worse and worse until the
[29:47] skies are catch on fire because it's
[29:49] going to burn us
[29:50] amen
[29:53] but
[29:54] how many likes in this scripture so many
[29:56] times he says but to you bride I say
[29:58] shalom
[30:00] Shalom to you who believe every word
[30:03] every jot every Tittle to you I say
[30:04] shalom
[30:06] peace
[30:08] I'm just glad for that piece
[30:11] now I notice
[30:13] you're going to stoop darker and darker
[30:15] as this year goes on but to those who
[30:17] turn on this New Year's to the light
[30:20] then you'll get brighter
[30:24] and brighter
[30:27] and brighter
[30:30] until that perfect day
[30:33] that we look for is appearing when all
[30:36] Darkness will fade away oh my
[30:39] that's the reason of that it's why I say
[30:42] to the Church of the Living God today
[30:44] shalom
[30:46] because we are his lights we are the
[30:49] light of the world
[30:52] I'm gonna need this we always say God
[30:53] help me
[30:55] help me to be a better light
[30:57] in my community a brighter light a
[31:01] greater influence on my job as a boss
[31:05] as a worker as a servant let me be a
[31:07] light
[31:08] a greater light in 2023 than I was in
[31:13] 2022.
[31:15] amen
[31:17] help me to be a better brother help me
[31:19] to be a better Pastor help me to be a
[31:21] better husband help me to be a better
[31:22] wife

[31:26] brother you sisters you better be you
[31:28] want to be a better sister to your
[31:29] sisters let's walk one another more
[31:31] let's draw closer to one another more
[31:33] Let the love of God be felt in this
[31:36] church Among Us
[31:37] greater Fellowship on with another
[31:40] folks I couldn't wait this morning
[31:41] because I'm glad to go to church like
[31:43] this is too long a week and a half is
[31:45] too long
[31:48] I hope everybody felt that way
[31:50] I'll just say as your pastor if you
[31:52] didn't I think you need some prayer
[31:54] you need to pray more
[31:56] amen
[31:59] oh
[32:00] aren't you glad that he has begun he
[32:02] that had begun a good work in you will
[32:04] also perform it
[32:06] amen
[32:11] you know the Bible says in Revelations
[32:13] the third chapter somewhere there it
[32:14] says and I won't go to it I'll just
[32:15] rehearse it save time he says in I
[32:18] believe it's in Revelations 3 when he
[32:19] begins the laodicea churches he says the
[32:22] beginning of the creation of God that he
[32:25] is the beginning he's the beginning of
[32:27] the creation of God Ephesians Paul says
[32:30] that we are his workmen
[32:32] yep create it in Christ Jesus
[32:37] amen now we have a new Time new period
[32:40] coming Amen in Acts acts 1 it says you
[32:42] know it is not for you to know the times
[32:44] of the Season that God has put in his
[32:46] own hand but you shall receive power
[32:48] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[32:51] and you shall be with me of me both in
[32:54] Jerusalem Vegeta Judea and so forth
[32:56] and that's the other most parts of the
[32:58] world Amen
[32:59] so God is beginning a creation he
[33:02] created Christ Jesus it was a new
[33:04] beginning I want to say the next two was
[33:07] ever real had a good time they come out
[33:09] of that rejoicing as you can see on the
[33:11] video and so forth there that end
[33:15] bad
[33:17] you got finally ended even after they
[33:19] went into the promised land because of
[33:20] their sins and idolatry that it did
[33:22] wrong they rejected him now over the
[33:24] last two thousand
[33:26] years
[33:27] because we needed something more than
[33:30] just a carnal Reformation we needed
[33:32] something more than just a oh my
[33:35] God that goes for every young person
[33:36] every person that was so scientist is
[33:38] going to try no you consecrate yourself
[33:40] 100 to the Holy Ghost until God comes in
[33:42] and accepts your sacrifice and fills you
[33:45] with his spirit
[33:46] that's the only way you'll ever overcome
[33:48] that's the only way you'll ever be a
[33:50] Christian is by the power of the Holy
[33:52] Ghost
[33:56] I'm gonna say what comes to my mind the
[33:58] reason some of our young people can't
[33:59] maintain their testimony can't really be
[34:01] a Christian the way because the parents
[34:02] aren't where they ought to be they don't
[34:04] have an atmosphere of prayer they don't
[34:05] have constantly you know the way that
[34:08] they are too
[34:09] I mean believes every one of us is
[34:10] parents you're there to you moms
[34:12] especially you're their tutor like
[34:13] Susanna Wesley the tutor those to
[34:16] treat teach them and so forth so they
[34:17] can just fall right into it
[34:20] amen
[34:22] that just come to mind that just said
[34:24] that that's totally free
[34:27] how many believe that
[34:31] your sisters
[34:33] that is your calling in life that is
[34:37] your duty to God is to raise those
[34:40] children for the Lord
[34:42] bam says what 20 25 however long it is
[34:45] that you have to raise them and that's
[34:47] your job you've done your job
[34:49] huh that's your duty
[34:51] amen
[34:54] praise the Lord
[34:56] is this all right
[35:00] amen
[35:02] then we think about
[35:08] things that people do for New Beginnings
[35:12] people do the craziest stuff
[35:15] just to have a new starter
[35:19] everybody wants a new start I got to
[35:21] think about unbelievers
[35:23] they're not happy with the earring
[35:25] back in my day when I was 20 years old
[35:28] that was about 40 years ago
[35:30] something like that
[35:32] you know some of the guy his brother
[35:34] Sean did have a little little ring
[35:36] leaning ring left here
[35:41] and I still don't know exactly what it
[35:43] meant
[35:45] don't really care to I don't guess but
[35:48] it was supposed to be okay
[35:51] huh
[35:53] and then you ended up with Dennis Rodman
[35:56] right
[36:02] now I've watched some of these people I
[36:04] don't know if you've I think I may have
[36:05] shown some of the pictures here before
[36:06] of a person that had their ears way big
[36:08] and and completely faced that too
[36:11] horrible right
[36:13] and and what I read about him is he gets
[36:16] some more attention
[36:18] a lot of these people do that for
[36:19] attention
[36:22] just to get more attention
[36:24] they're so lonely I guess
[36:26] they're so insecure they want somebody
[36:28] to say oh wow look at that tattoo you
[36:30] got
[36:31] you look at that tattoo and I says wow
[36:33] well that's gonna hold nobody said
[36:34] nothing in the world to me I'll put
[36:35] another one over here
[36:37] they went from the earrings to what the
[36:39] nose ringing now you can't go through
[36:41] Dairy Queen with somebody
[36:43] let me tell you something it's unsafe
[36:46] but anyway to that to tattoos and all
[36:49] these other things dig out the great
[36:51] extremes just to try to have a new start
[36:53] girls to cut their hair a little bit
[36:55] I want to look a little different so
[36:58] that the devil's Temptations for a girl
[37:01] cut your hair
[37:03] huh not about to deal with them to wear
[37:06] a little makeup
[37:07] a little this that or the other
[37:10] amen
[37:12] be glad of how God
[37:15] made you
[37:17] amen
[37:20] you say well I got crooked teeth
[37:22] I don't know my wife's got one crooked
[37:24] teeth one crooked teeth over here
[37:26] nothing I like that crooked teeth it's
[37:29] just unique to me I like I dislike it it
[37:32] doesn't bother me a bit
[37:34] I'm telling you something if you got a
[37:35] girlfriend that's got all kinds of
[37:36] crooked teeth if you really love her now
[37:38] please don't look perfect to you
[37:43] you might have a boyfriend that smells
[37:45] like a pogat but it smells good to you
[37:48] come on folks is that right it's about
[37:51] the brother
[37:52] said
[37:53] I like the smell of that pole cat that's
[37:55] my poke okay
[37:58] God help me oh my I didn't mean to go
[38:01] there but
[38:03] that was a prophet
[38:05] let me tell you how young men need to
[38:07] look for girls that have character
[38:09] I thank God for having young ladies in
[38:11] this church that have character
[38:12] amen any any good man should uh you know
[38:16] see the girls that we have in our church
[38:17] that's Christian cares faithful folks

[38:26] be a beauty King to have character and
[38:28] to be likable amen
[38:33] folks I'm here to tell you most of the
[38:34] times it goes the other way with beauty
[38:38] yeah
[38:39] anyway I didn't mean to go that way but
[38:40] that's all right I guess the Holy Spirit
[38:41] wanted to encourage some of us amen
[38:44] praise the Lord God is good isn't he
[38:47] so we got here look at this look at what
[38:49] I wrote down here people are forever

[39:55] be somebody sitting in here does that
[39:56] and they're gonna feel real bad I hope
[39:58] not
[40:00] all I can say is this there ain't a
[40:03] thing wrong with it
[40:05] as long as you got plenty money
[40:08] all right
[40:10] ain't nothing wrong with it
[40:12] but we're just nature that way but now
[40:14] if you ain't got the money you're going
[40:16] deeper into that and stuff then again
[40:17] you got a problem
[40:19] you man
[40:22] I've been thinking about trading money
[40:24] and it's got that
[40:25] you know I just got it paid for the
[40:28] other day and if I'm ever going to have
[40:29] a better truck mother's brother Jeff I
[40:31] better do it now because I have more put
[40:33] down on that other women ever
[40:35] I just I not have payments too much to
[40:38] do it so I don't know if I'll do it or

[40:51] I'm tired of that church I'm going
[40:52] somewhere else I don't get fed anymore
[40:55] I've heard that a lot coming from other
[40:57] places
[41:02] better watch what I say because I don't
[41:04] want to hurt anybody's feelings but
[41:08] find out that they got the same problems
[41:09] when they get here or go there that they
[41:11] had before
[41:13] amen
[41:16] what if I come up here and says look
[41:19] oh my God church anymore because I don't
[41:22] feel like I'm getting fed
[41:28] you'd say that that brother it's got to
[41:31] be your own fault you're the preacher

[51:55] as the prophet of God said his
[51:57] fellowship and and communion and so
[51:59] forth amen

[52:04] First Corinthians I believe it is
[52:09] amen how many is looking forward to
[52:11] Fellowship today
[52:13] and another service this evening amen
[52:15] just a good day in the Lord
[52:18] First Corinthians
[52:24] 11.
[52:27] verse 26.
[52:30] Paul says for I have received of the
[52:32] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[52:34] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[52:36] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[52:39] when he had given thanks he break it and
[52:40] said take eat this is my body which is
[52:42] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[52:45] me after the same animal so he took the
[52:48] cup and when he had stopped saying this
[52:49] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[52:51] this two years often as he drink it in
[52:53] remembrance of me for as often as he eat
[52:56] this bread and drink of this cup you do
[52:58] show the Lord's death till he come amen
[53:00] how many believes it's important
[53:02] it's important
[53:04] wherefore whosoever shall lead of this
[53:06] bread and drinketh this cup of the Lord
[53:07] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[53:09] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[53:11] examine himself and so let him eat of
[53:13] that bread and drink of that cup examine
[53:15] yourself make sure your sins are under
[53:17] the blood
[53:20] foreignation to himself not Discerning
[53:23] the Lord's body and for this cause many
[53:25] are weak and sickly among you and many
[53:26] sleep for we would judge ourselves we
[53:28] should not be judged
[53:30] but when we are judged we are chasing of
[53:31] the law that we should not be condemned
[53:33] with the world wherever my brethren when
[53:35] he come together to eat Terry one for
[53:37] another and if any man hunger let him
[53:39] eat at home that you come not together
[53:40] unto condemnation and the rest well I
[53:43] said in order
[53:44] when I come amen today I'm going to
[53:47] trust that you have already made things
[53:49] right with the Lord and all those that
[53:51] want to take communion if you would come
[53:52] over around to the right side the rest
[53:54] can be remain seated if anybody doesn't
[53:57] want to even if y'all come around
