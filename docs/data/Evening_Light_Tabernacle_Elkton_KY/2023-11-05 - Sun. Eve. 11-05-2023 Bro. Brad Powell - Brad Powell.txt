need and how I I need more of him and my children need more of him and sister Sher need a touch from the Lord and different ones and you know what the next thing I know I'm waking up my alarm's going

the people this afternoon Lord we just pray that you would speak through US allow me to get myself out of the way and that the words that are spoken are not the words of man but the the words of eternal life and from God Almighty Lord Lord we pray that you would speak to our hearts anoint our ears to hear Lord Jesus what you'd have in store for us and may the word just be encouraging to us and inspiring and and bless us Lord to to be able to to serve you in a greater way because you know that's our heart's desire we just want to be what you want us to be and we're trying to come into

and live through Us in Jesus name amen amen good to be in the house of the Lord again I tell you y'all got me sappy back there singing and and uh just enjoyed it and maybe we should uh maybe we should have just had a song service this afternoon I don't know but we just do what the Lord's laid on her on her heart and and uh preach what he's laid on her heart and and I like that song they sang Like an Eagle will take to the sky one of these days we're going to wipe away the last tear the last heartache will be gone and like an eagle will take to the sky so if you would turn in your Bibles to John chapter 1 we had just a great service this morning we appreciate the word the awesomeness of the word that went forth this morning and speaking about judgment so we got our spiritual bellies full this morning and and then you got your natural bellies full so I know you're tired I try not to keep you and I know we uh we want to come and hear the word and and if you just give us about an hour maybe less I'm I'm not going to keep you and you know the old saying is the the spirit's willing but the flesh is weak uh we're we're willing to be here and we want to be here but in the flesh we're getting tired so uh I know I know where you're at I want to speak to you today if I could on just a little topic of Broken Vessels Broken Vessels and um we today was communion Sunday and and you know I I just think communion Sundays are special Sundays it's a time of remembrance it's a time that we can reflect back and just take some solemn moments to thank the Lord for what he's done for us and and uh so I always try to bring in a scripture if I'm asked to speak on that day of any either service and and just a to just to remember what God has done for us and and there was a I won't keep you standing long but uh we'll get into our scripture but there was a a a clip that was sent to me two or three years ago and it and it it stuck out to me and it stuck with me and I get amused every time I see it and and I can tell it to my kids over and over and I laugh and they because it's Dad you know and uh but it's a little boy and he's sitting at the table and and he's sitting at the table and he's doing a a a word math problem how many loves word math problems me neither we're we're we're just alike so we're in good company I hate them but he's doing the math word problem and he's reading the word problem out loud and he said and the problem reads Jaden has a dollar and Jaden has a quarter Jaden has two dimes and one nickel how much money does Jaden have and he looks up at his mama and smiles and he says Jaden [Applause] broke Jaden broke now I never in a million years thought I would use that in a sermon to to start out a sermon but when I thought about Broken Vessels I thought Jaden broke Jaden had some money Jaden had a150 but in the mind of this little boy Jaden was broke and I'm afraid that's the way we are a lot of times as Christians we have a little bit of joy we have a little bit of happiness we have a little bit of love a little bit of life a little bit of Hope but we walk around like we're broke Christians and so I I thought about that and I thought Broken Vessels what what does that mean there's songs written about it and and so I looked it up and there's actually a scriptural definition for Broken Vessels and it said a person who is destroyed or forgotten or who feels flawed broken or empty and I thought my Broken Vessels how many of us have walked through life maybe this week last week maybe yesterday maybe today and in your life you're thinking I feel so flawed I feel so broken I feel so empty we've all been there and I thought Broken Vessels so let's go to our scripture here and let's look at this and and we'll try to look through this and break it down if we can so John chapter 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made watch this in him was life and the life was the light of man so here Jesus comes on to the scene and John's recounting who Jesus is and he's letting us know Jesus is not an empty broken vessel Jesus is a man of life he is a man that carries the light of men in within him so he is not an empty vessel and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehend it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear the witness of that light that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not now here's one of the most astounding statements in the Bible he came to his own and his own received him not how could you feel any more empty than that right there he came to his own his own received him not but as many as received him listen now there's a different group of people but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born by your last name no not by Blood it was born not of blood nor by the of Flesh nor by the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and we beheld his glory and the glory of as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness have we all received and Grace for grace for the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ you can have your seats John begins to look at this I'm going to lay a little Foundation before we get into our thoughts John John uh begins it looks at this not at the baptism of Jesus like Mark does he doesn't start his writing there he doesn't even start with the conception or the birth of Jesus as as Matthew or Luke write it but he starts at in back in the word all the way back to Genesis 1:1 so John must have had what I would say was a truly great revelation of who Jesus Christ was in this past here Jesus is identified as the Incarnation of Eternal Word so now Jesus has stepped on the word into the world and and he has identified himself as the word come to life for the whole world to see this word is brought into a relationship with God in the closest possible way he was both was was God and was present in the beginning he was God in the creation and it was the uncomprehended source of life life he was that light for humankind he brought salvation into the world are you with me but despite despite John's testimony and what he tells Jesus was not universally received Jesus was not a man that was received through the hearts of all mankind that he come in contact with there were many that couldn't stand Jesus there were many that looked at him and mocked him and and didn't like his Works who tried every way to to send him away and and to get him out of their cities the Pharisees the Sadducees they could not stand the work of Jesus so in this word he became the Incarnate of Jesus John the Baptist tells of his greatness and the author of the book of John adds to John the baptizer testimony and says that Jesus even supersedes Moses this is powerful words they had been waiting and waiting for somebody to come onto the scene for the Messiah to come on the scene and now they're telling this man John the baptizer says this man right here is greater than Moses was ever take and know and know this guy and put your eyes on him and see what he's doing because Moses only gave the law but this man Jesus when he's on the scene he gives us Grace he gives us truth he gives us life he gives us hope he gives us joy he gives us forgiveness he gives us these things so Jes Jesus revealed God the Father whom the world had never put eyes on now he stands in shoe leather now let's fast forward a bit we've laid a foundation of who Jesus was and what John saw and and what John the Baptist testified of let's fast forward a little bit and see what the prophet says about Jesus he said there he was when he was dying Yonder at Calvary everything had rejected him he said they they had spit on him and his face was full of a mockery spit they had a rag around his eyes they hit him on the head and said if you're the prophet tell us who hit you and a little woman run in the midst of him and said what is he done but heal your sick raise your dead and done good and he said they smacked her in the mouth they smacked her in the mouth and said would you listen to a woman instead of your priest away with such a person' and he said his own Dear Mother walking in his bloody Footprints his own Dear Mother walking in his bloody Footprints as he went Yonder to Calvary down in her heart was wondering when she seen her darling child die Yonder a man 33 years old but looked 50 he said the Bible says the strain and and where he probably was turning gray and the grim look on his face to where he was suffering not so much physically but because he was in agony my brothers and sisters can you imagine the pain can you imagine the pain and the anguish that Jesus was feeling down into his heart the loneliness and the emptiness that he must have been going through how he must have felt like some kind of a broken empty vessel and he sits there on the cross and the prophet said he never died from a Roman spear neither did he die from a nail drove into his hand hand or his feet but he died of a broken heart rejected he died of a broken heart being rejected he came to his own and his own received him not and listen what the prophet said he said and you say brother brandom I wish I could have stood there on that day of Calvary he said brother you're standing in a better place today because you're standing in the presence of a resurrected Lord Jesus who has proven himself triumphant We Stand today in the presence of a resurrected Jesus Christ who will never be spit on again he'll never be mocked again he'll never be nailed to a cross again and we stand in the very presence of him today because we are triumphant Psalms 31 I'm gonna go through several scriptures you just have to listen you don't have time to turn to them Psalms 31 have mercy mercy on me oh lord for I am in trouble mine eyes is consumed with grief yay my soul and my belly for my life is spent with grief and my years with s my strength faileth because of my iniquity and my bones are consumed reproach amongst all my enemies but especially amongst my neighbors and I fear to my a fear to my acquaintance that they did see me with without fled from me I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind I am like a broken vessel brothers and sisters this is David we hear this account of David we see Christ and we can look back at others in history job for instance and they go through times when they feel like they just don't measure up we go through times like they did where we feel inadequate or like we're never enough and David Avid says have mercy on me oh Lord because here's David again layment out in sorrow and David is turning his head up in sorrow and layment out to Christ showing that both during their times of rest and during times of adversity God is still there God is still in the presence he's showing that God's people that the adversity comes in Seasons yet David looks to the Lord again it's like we're riding an emotional roller coaster we go high one day and then we go down or like you're on a boat and full of waves and all of a sudden you feel like man you could you could conquer the world and you're feeling good man there's nothing in the world that can stop me and then the next thing you know man there is nothing I can't even get out of bed we're riding this roller coaster and David is talking about this roller coaster and David begins to look back and he even takes some some thoughts from The Book of Job and looks back at job's life and he says my eyes waste away with grief he's in a pable condition here my eyes are wasting away with grief and he's talking about his afflictions you know our our afflictions come in different ways different maners but they all are are are thrown at us by Satan and David talking about his afflictions here the the first one he talks about is physical he says my strength fails me my bone waste away now many times as we get older and we begin to mature and and we become in the veteran age of life and we're getting just about that ready our bones begin to fail us and we feel like we're wasting away and we feel like that Satan has sapped our physical strength to the point that we're approaching death David is describing his predicament at that David was not at a point of death but that is how he described himself because he could feel like he just could not go on our afflictions hit us emotionally David says my life is spent with grief and my years is filled with sign fear is on every side so emotionally David is now feeling drained and pulled down by the hour he's living in how many of us can feel some emotional pull and some drain by the hour we're living in it is a constant battle Satan is not sleeping on the job brothers and sisters it is a constant battle that he's constantly pulling and pulling And the emotions and the the things that you hear the news the things that go on in Schools they're pulling us and draining us social David said I've beeno reproach amongst my enemies repulsive to my acquaintances brother and sisters David says I don't fit in we can say that we don't fit you better emotion you as social mortal he says take they take counsel together against me and scheme to take my life away Satan is constantly scheming against you he is a mortal enemy of yours spiritually listen to what David says because of my iniquities because of my failures because of my shortcomings because of my mistakes I'm not even adequate because of all of these things building up social emotional mortal spiritual I just a forgotten man out of mind and I am a broken vessel it's okay to feel broken David is letting us know you can't overcome Brokenness Jesus let us know that you can overcome Brokenness how do you overcome Brokenness how do you overcome emptiness how do you overcome the the waters and the oils leaking through your vessel I'm fixing You Second Kings 4 1-7 there was a woman there in Second Kings her husband had died she was left with two boys and a big boatload of debt two Bosman are coming after her they're going to take her boys and make them work off the debt and take them in and make them and pull them into to slavery pretty much to work off the debt and Elija says to her what shall I do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she said thy handmade hath not anything in in the house except save a pot of oil you don't have no money you you don't have no gold you don't have no silver you don't have you don't have cattle you don't have any sheep have nothing you can barter with I have nothing but a pot of oil Elisha looks down at her said what am I going to do no Elisha says little is much if God is in it Elisha says I tell you what you go and borrow vessels from all over the neighborhood you go and borrow these vessels empty vessels borrow not a few did you hear that borrow not a few and when thou come in thou shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and Y shall pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full I'm going to say it again little is much if God is in it little is much if God is in it so she went and she goes and she shuts the door she gathers and brings all the vessels in and she brings them and she begins to pour out and it said it came to pass that when the vessels were full that she said unto her sons bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed amen amen little is much when God is in it then she came and told the man of God and he said go and sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy Children of the [Applause] rest the prophet says go and go and borrow empty vessels borrow not a few is this strange we think sometimes in our natural Minds that the answer to this woman's dilemma is going to be fullness she's got to have gold she's got to have coins she's got to have how only way she can get out of this is if she's got money or cattle or sheep or something that she can barter with but that's not the way it is the natural mind iMed immediately begins to look for what does she have that she can sell what does she have that she can has an abundance that she can get rid of but that is not the way it is with God God has a different way to deliver her because God has always been in the business of making something out of nothing let me tell you brothers and sisters there is nothing that attracts the attention of the Lord like [Applause] emptiness like emptiness listen what the prophet said he said oh it's God's strategy to take a empty human vessels you and me to take empty human V vessels and shake the world with them that's right that's what the he didn't say he was going to take a bunch of preachers and shake the world he didn't say he was going to take a bunch of musicians and shake the world he said I want somebody that will pour themselves out and let me pour myself in and I'm going to take that person that's willing to be empty and I'm going to shake the entire world with them that's what God is looking for he said look at it on the day of Pentecost what what did he do he said it took them 10 days to get emptied yep there they was in that upper room up there praying and praying and praying God couldn't move on to the scene until the very last morsel of pollution was out of their out of them people and we get down on our knees sometimes say oh God forgive me Phyllis oh God I'm sorry feel me are we really getting down to where the rubber meets of Road and emptying ourselves out completely and getting out every bit of trash and and smoke and mire out of our Lives before we ever ask God to move into our lives we ask God for things but we're asking for things a Miss sometimes because we're not ready to accept God and he said God he took himself and he filled them up because they were standing there with their vessels turned up the only way they could turn them up is if they had took them had taken them from turning them down and turned them up they had poured out everything on the day of Pentecost and he says and that's what we need today that's what we need today is empty vessels brothers and sisters we need men and we need women and young people and children that are willing to empty themselves out and turn their themselves up to God and say God I am clean pour yourself in me pour yourself in me there's a natural law that says that nothing can remain empty everything has to be filled you go dig a hole what happens water comes up in it right yeah you go out there and you dig a post hole you come back well I'll come back in a couple days and I'll put my post in at my concrete you going to have to get the water out first because the hole is filled up either that or the dirt has filled itself back in don't don't ask me how it does it you dig a hole it will fill itself back in you can't wait and that is a law of Nature and since nothing can remain empty and we realize in this condition we have to be intentional we have to be deliberate we have to act uh uh and choose to be emptied we have to want to be emptied you know you can cruise through life claiming Christianity claiming to be a believer claiming all these things you can cruise through life but are you truly empty do you truly allow God a completely clean and empty vessel to dwell in I'm speaking to myself as I looked at this I thought you know what I could do so much more empty and out I could I could get get rid of so much stuff in my life that would allow God more time in it and in our story here he tells her to go and buy go go and borrow sorry go and borrow these vessels and so she goes and she begins to borrow from this neighbor and this neighbor and this neighbor and we don't know what was in those vessels do we it could have been any kinds of many kinds of things filled in those vessels that she borrowed and in those vessels it could have been flour in one of them it could have been meal in in one of them maybe it could have been honey in one of them them maybe hot peppers in another one so she's got all these vessels and and so maybe maybe in one of those vessels there was Envy in one of them did you hear me and one of those vessels maybe there was hatred in one of them maybe one of those vessels was filled with a with a Red Hot Chili Pepper of temper now you can't just take that oil and pour it in there and expect it to be good no we don't know what came in those but one thing we do know that those vessels had something in them and in order for God to use them those vessels had to be cleaned out and that's the way it is with us because these vessels are going to house something good or bad you're going to have something in this vessel but under God's command it says if if he's to use them I can't use them until they're first all emptied out clean out all the old stuff so brothers and sisters regardless of the condition that these vessels were found in regardless of the condition that you're living in there has to be a cleaning and a day when when you're dumped out and cleaned out regardless of what you've done in the past regardless of what Memories you have of the past regardless of where you're living today so if there's anything in your life that's hindering God from moving dump it out get rid of it that's the required condition empty means to have nothing on the inside it means that that you can you have to be there with no worth no significance meaningless lifeless and boy now how many wants to be empty well that's a hard that's a that's a that's a catch 22 is it because man we're that we to work hard in life we ought to be be make our parents proud We ought to make each other proud We ought to be proud for our homes we ought to be able to to do this and do that and and and show ourselves but here's not what it's saying it's telling us we need to be empty we need to be lifeless we need to be void we need to be meaningless because the only way we can make God proud and let him live in US is if that's the condition we're in we have to get to such a place that emptiness is we're speaking of as a condition of the heart it's an attitude it's a disposition of the heart that changes the entire life before God and says God I'm weak I'm hopeless I'm helpless I'm powerless and I am nothing without you you want to get somewhere with God get less with yourself you want to move forward with God and have God to move become an empty vessel Be A Life That's wholly given up to God and fully surrendered a life that is totally surrendered and sustained by God John 15 tells us I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing it's plain and simple we try to make it hard we make it hard because we try to do things our way we try to do things the way we want things done that's right but that's not the way God is God says if if I'm going to use you you have to be mine you have to be fully committed you have to be labeled we we had some honey we had some some honey that we had and and we give it out to to various ones well we had Amber Amber and Jordan come and they we give them some honey two years ago three years ago I don't know but it was some of the best honey that you could possibly imagine it was just as crystal clear as as you could ever see they loved it well she she been wanting some more so she come up a couple weeks ago and she went over to ny's house my mother-in-law and she had some honey on the table that had our label on it she ate that honey and she said I ate some of your honey over at nanas I said no you didn't she said it had your label on it I said it wasn't our honey I said that was something we had to we bought out and I just put it in that jar had our label on it she said oh cuz I buy it in bulk she said oh I said but I've got some that the label stands behind what's in it I've got some that's inside the jar here that's exactly come off of our farm and it will put that other to shame you'll like this honey because it's the real deal and that's the way it is with God if God's going to put his label across you and says that's one of mine you better be the real deal John 6 53 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you I say uh uh very very I say unto you except you eat this flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you so we're most valuable when we are empty how many times have we said it I'm must decrease so that he must increase when it when we become nothing he can become everything that's right that that's when something really begins to take place is is when we become nothing God becomes everything there's a story and and we talked about this here a while back but I've I've dug deeper into it with this this story here in 1 Samuel Samuel said when thou was little in thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of of Israel and the Lord anointed thee King over Israel and there's a story in the Book of Judges and and this is one I want to get to the story in the Book of Judges where God uses emptiness in a powerful way Judges 7 and16 Gideon divided the 300 men listen to this Gideon divided the 300 men into three companies and he put a trumpet in every man's hand with empty pictures and lamps within the pictures did you hear what I said 300 men with a trumpet and an empty picture a water picture with a candle these 300 men carrying a trumpet and a an empty picture with a candle are fixing to go take on a huge medanite Army well little is much if God is in it because here is 300 men taken on this army with no swords no Spears no knives no Shields a trumpet and a empty water picture with a c are you getting the picture brothers and sisters I don't know about you but I don't find that too intimidating if I'm the midianite Army and I'm looking up there and I'm looking down on them on them guys them 300 men I'm looking down and I'm probably yelling what you g to do with them trumpets in that water pcture are y'all going to cook us some soup and sing us a song or what are y'all going to do are you going to serenade us with your trumpet that's right because if I'm going into battle I'm planning and preparing to take on men with swords and shields and Spears and catapults and armor that that's what I'm looking for and here I'm looking at an Army full of men with trumpets and an empty water picture it what it was that made their picture valuable was God's purpose see it wasn't the beauty it it wasn't their beauty it wasn't the particular shape or the design of the water pictures it had nothing to do with what they were used for in the past had nothing to do with any of that it didn't matter whose house else it come from it didn't matter if those pictures were made of gold or silver or clay or or whatever none of that stuff mattered or brass that wasn't what God was looking for but what made them valuable to God's purpose is the same thing that makes us valuable to him today and they were empty they were empty and they were breakable we don't like to be broken do we oh boy I got one sitting right there and there's one sitting right there that does not want to be broken they got the the the the uh that they could be twins 16 15 16 years apart Carson and sa they don't want their Spirit broken when they set their mind to something they're going on they're going to dig their heels in they're going to keep going on till they accomplish what they're looking to do am I right Austin smiling yeah he's thinking man don't don't be bringing my family into this it's all good it's all good it'll all work out but we don't like to be broken we don't like our spirit broken we don't like somebody to tell us no we don't like for somebody to say you've got to fail before you can succeed you know what I found out everybody wants what you got but they don't want to do what it takes to get what you got let me tell you some of the most successful people in the world ever to walk on the face of the Earth whether it be business or Athletics or or just just in life in general marriages they because they fail over and over and over but they don't stop right they keep digging in their heels and say we may not have made it today but tomorrow is a different day exactly right Baby Ruth had 780 or 700 and something home runs held the record for years but they never talk about the 1400 strikeouts and you know what his motto was don't let the fear strike it out keep you from playing the game unbre we don't want to be broken but God tells us we got to be breakable these pictures were empty they were breakable and if you want to get God's attention and show him your emptiness show him that you're empty and show him that you want to attract the heart but because you're breakable you'll never serve God's higher purpose until you get empty and broken before God you say man I thought you preachers were pepping us up here at the last days I thought you preachers were trying to get us ready for a rapture we are if your vessel is not completely empty God can't completely fill you that's right God does his be best work with broken things broken pictures broken bread broken hearts you know they didn't even realize who Jesus was until he broke the bread when he broke the bread they began to realize by the scars on his hands I don't know or by the way he broke the bread but they said oh we know who this is and he vanished so God does great things in broken pieces so here they were these pictures now let's look at these pictures they were empty to hold a candle these these water pictures were empty to put the candle in secondly they had to be broken to allow the light that was inside to be seen to release the treasure that was on the inside now it just I hope I can I hope I can get this across to you the way it came to me but when I read John chapter 1 one and it said in him was life and the life was the light of men in him was life and the life was light of men here they have a picture they have a candle he's the life the light of men they put the light into the picture and then when the when the the they they begin to go and the but the light on the inside has to be seen you know we can have all of God in us till we're full to the top to the very tip of our hair but if the world never sees him if the world never sees God living through you if if the world never sees God speaking through you and walking through you and talking through you and ministering through you what good is all of that light going to do and unfortunately many Christians have forgotten that our reason for being saved is not to be a have a more comfortable life and that's a common misconception boy if I get saved life's going to be easy I'm in cruise control because God loves me and I'm going to be blessed boy that's a what a that's a real wakeup call when that don't happen it brother Troy you know what I'm talking about life life begins to happen but but the real thing is to manifest the reality of the resurrection of a savior to the world yes that's what the is that's what the life and the light is that's on the inside of us is to let the world know that there is a resurrected savior who can come and cut you loose who can free them who can save them who can deliver them who can heal them how does the world know that by going to church no they don't go to church they know it by watching you they know it by hearing your testimonies they know it by by seeing you and they say that woman right there she's a walking Mir mirle because she has been completely healed of cancer but to manifest the beauty of this resurrected savior here Gideon is with these 300 soldiers a trumpet a pitcher and a candle the candle inside the picture and all of a sudden the Army begins to S to to scream to scream out at the top of their voice and they begin to look out there and they begin to holler out and they begin to scream out of what that look at what God this is the sword of God and Gideon yes and the pictures the light goes forth and they scream this is the sword of God this is the sword of Gideon and they said God turned the swords of all of those men upon themselves and they fleed the scene and God won victoriously little as much when God is in it it don't matter if it's a water pcture a candle a trumpet it doesn't matter but if God is in it and you're letting God have complete control watch him move on the [Applause] scene empty vessel the prophet said borrow not a few brothers and sisters we shouldn't hold back on God brother B's been preaching a lot here lately about ask big things get big results well if you going to ask for big things and you going to take this bottle cap to catch all of God's oil you ain't going to take home a lot if I had up here today put that right there if I had up here today and said in this back room right here I've got a garden h and out of that garden hose flows pure Liquid Gold go get all the vessels you can carry bring them up here we'll fill them up you can have all you can carry out of here well y'all setting off a Ste cuz I know better if y'all thought that was a true statement if I could produce that You' be running out there trying to find every water trough you be opening the hood on your trucks you be backing your cars up here and fill this vessel fill this vessel why is it when we talk about God we don't do that bring all of your vessels to God if you need Joy bring a vessel for Joy if you need happiness don't settle for just Joy get happiness too get love get Deliverance get Freedom get get rid of fear and take on the good things the peace of God bring your vessels not a few bring them all bring them all it was not when the there was no longer a a empty vessel that the oil stopped flowing if we could just have a fresh flow of the Holy anointing of God we would see that we could have the peace and the security and the love and the freedom and happiness and forgiveness and joy but we must come empty I want you to listen to this again fixing the close I'm going to break 40 50 minutes maybe God's strategy don't forget this God's strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them shake the world with them turned up and God took himself and filled him up that's all and they shook the world poured himself into him that's what we have need today is empty vessels so that God can fill them up God cannot use them as long as they're already filled up now listen to this I like this Elijah didn't say some vessels and borrow a lot of oil and we'll see if we can get a good sale price on it and get you a little more than what we can so that we can pay your neighbor back he didn't say that see we try to barter sometimes but he didn't say that he said go bring me some empty vessels that's all you need he said brothers and sisters he says as it was on the day of Pentecost they had those empty vessels so God could fill them up and he says brother listen now this day demands that this day demands that this day you've got to have that will'll have that or will'll perish you see how important it is that we empty oursel out that our lives this little short period of time we're here really doesn't mean a lot right we've got to have that or perish he says brother listen to this I'm close the lid has come off of Hell the streams of demon power is pouring from everywhere it's conquered the Nations he didn't say it will conquer he said it's conquered the Nations right it's conquered politics man I hope Trump wins it don't matter it's conquered the politics till it's rotten to the core it's conquered the churches that's until they know nothing but denomination you say well I'm a Christian I'm a he says I'm a Methodist are you a CH Christian I'm no more than being a pig or a hog or a horse or something else now that sounds pretty harsh you go tell that to your Baptist friends Go Tell it to your Catholic friends you might get a [Applause] curing that doesn't matter it has nothing to do with it you're a Christian when you're born again and filled with the Holy Ghost not until that not until you're yielded completely to the spirit if you are not yielded to the spirit then you are never born again and you don't have the Holy Ghost you might speak in tongues and river and jump and run and do all kinds of he said but what we need oh God I feel it pouring in through here now what we need is a prophet of God who will rise up with a thunderbolt of God I think we got that we know what we have need of and and more and more I study this message the more and more I realize that I got something that the church world does not have and if I'm not careful and if you're not careful we will take these very quotes the very very scriptures we'll take them for granted we will we will fail to realize how important and how blessed we are as a people at the Bri of Jesus Christ we've been told that our whole life so it's it's common to us but we can't let this message message become common to us when he tells us we have to be empty we got to be empty when he tells us that politics has been conquered it's been conquered when he tells us the denominations have been conquered it's been conquered so we have to take these and live by these words and don't take them for granted and he says so get weak so you can get strong how many tonight would say God help me get weak so that I can be strong help we get weak it'll conquer every devil he said it'll put the learned to [Applause] shame you know your kids can teach many of theologians they won't believe them but they can teach them they can tell them truths that the world has never heard you're five year olds six year olds eight year olds why because God has found empty vessel willing to accept the word and the message of his hour he says remember as it was in the days of Noah so it'll be in the coming of Son of Man eight Souls were saved think in the Days of Elijah there was 7,000 only had it just think we're living think we're we're living now when John came on the scene the little church was certainly in the minority but there was empty vessels to pour the oil in God let us empty ourselves up let's stand to our feet as the musicians come he says get empty friends get weak deny your own ability that's hard for men that's hard for for humans to deny your own ability because it's easy we want to fix things we want things to be our way and we can do it I can do it I know I can do it give me the challenge I'll take it on deny your own ability he said you out there in the radio or those that hear these tapes wherever you come from empty yourselves out pour yourselves out upon God's altar as a sacrifice let the angel come with a coal of fire fill that vessel with the power of almighty God and then he'll make you strong and he'll give you the grace to stand you want to know how to do it thank you Lord right there deny yourself empty yourself ask God to fill you and he'll give you the power he'll give you the power to make you strong he'll give you the power to give you the grace so that you can stand the Ws of this wicked age let's bow our heads sister Becky if you just want to play whatever's on your heart heart there Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for this day for another service you've you've blessed us with and we thank you for we could certainly feel your presence from from the back door as we came in and through the singing of the songs and we just uh felt felt an anointing here tonight the people pulling even though they were tired and their flesh their Spirits pulled and Lord we just trust that that we go away from here from a changed people a people that's willing to find ourselves and our own abilities denied and vessels empty so that you can fill us up on a day-to-day basis and Lord as our pastors been preaching ask big things you get big results we can ask big things but if we're not prepared to take it home with us it'll do us no good so Lord help us
