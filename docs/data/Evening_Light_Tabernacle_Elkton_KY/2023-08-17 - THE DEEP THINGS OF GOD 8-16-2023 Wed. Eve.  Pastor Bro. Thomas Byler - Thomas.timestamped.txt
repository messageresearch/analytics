[31:58] minutes worth of reading but it's two we
[32:01] accept uh save Jesus Christ and him
[32:03] crucified I was with you in weakness and
[32:06] in much fear and trembling
[32:08] and so forth and then we'll go down to
[32:11] verse six how be it how be it we speak
[32:14] wisdom among them that are perfect yet
[32:17] not the wisdom of this world nor of the
[32:20] princes of this world that come to
[32:22] naught but we speak wisdom the wisdom of
[32:25] God in the mystery even the hidden
[32:28] wisdom which God ordained before the
[32:30] world unto our glory amen amen now which
[32:35] none of the princes of this world knew
[32:37] for had they known it
[32:40] they would not have crucified the Lord
[32:42] Of Glory but as it is written I Has Not
[32:46] Seen Nor Ear heard nor hath entered into
[32:48] the heart of man
[32:51] the things which God
[32:53] has prepared
[32:55] for them that love him
[32:57] but God has revealed them unto us by his
[33:00] spirit for the spirit searches all
[33:03] things yea the Deep things of God Amen
[33:06] may God had his blessings to the reading
[33:08] of the word the Deep things
[33:10] of God
[33:12] the Deep things
[33:14] of God so by the help and grace of God
[33:17] tonight we're going to go deep
[33:20] I was thinking on the way here I said
[33:22] boy you're in trouble you got a shallow
[33:24] mind trying to go deep here
[33:27] amen blessed you know it's not about my
[33:29] mind anyway isn't that right it's about
[33:32] Christ amen and I'll express to you what
[33:35] I was kind of thinking in this so of
[33:38] course
[33:39] when we talk about the Deep things of
[33:41] God Amen uh you know I'm just going to
[33:44] share give me a different scriptures and
[33:46] different things and it'll probably seem
[33:48] like we're jumping into place but amen
[33:51] we are going to jump all over the place
[33:52] with the help of Lord because we know
[33:54] that God has some mysterious things that
[33:57] he had here amen before the before the
[33:59] world isn't that right
[34:01] amen but he has ordained it before the
[34:03] world unto our glory amen this will go
[34:07] along with brother Brad's message
[34:09] certainly on on Sunday I certainly
[34:11] enjoyed it amen I certainly enjoyed
[34:13] Sunday's message and this will certainly
[34:15] amen just go right along with going into
[34:17] the promised land how many believes we
[34:19] need to go into that Promised Land
[34:21] the promised land of the word of God and
[34:24] to eat on uh bride food we're eating and
[34:27] I was thinking of where that scripture
[34:30] was about eating all the good of the
[34:33] land eating the good of the land amen
[34:35] and I believe these deep things of God
[34:36] are eating on the good things of the
[34:39] land
[34:40] and of course and we'll just cover quite
[34:43] a quite a few different things amen uh
[34:46] with the help of the Lord on it but in
[34:47] Isaiah 1 18 it says
[34:50] um if ye be willing and obedient ye
[34:53] shall eat the good of the land amen
[34:56] praise the Lord how many is glad that we
[35:00] can uh eat those great big grapes that
[35:03] Joshua and those I don't know if it was
[35:05] Joshua but but it was I guess it was
[35:08] Joshua and Caleb but different ones that
[35:10] brought the uh grapes back amen amen
[35:13] from the land when they went to spy out
[35:16] the land and they brought these grapes
[35:17] back and I got to thinking of how big
[35:19] Those Grapes might have been maybe they
[35:22] were the size of a I mean uh maybe apple
[35:24] or something maybe even uh I don't know
[35:26] maybe they're as big as a grapefruit you
[35:28] know but I can just imagine that when
[35:30] you got into biting into one of them
[35:32] grapes you probably got your nose and
[35:34] your mouth all in it and my you just got
[35:36] your face all messy eating them grapes
[35:41] amen and that's what we want to do
[35:44] tonight I want you to just get all messy
[35:46] tonight and get to eat them good grapes
[35:48] amen because we don't want to be the two
[35:50] and a half amen they're just happy with
[35:52] salvation or being a part of Israel or
[35:54] whatever but hey man we want to go into
[35:56] all that God has for us I believe
[35:58] brother bam said one place if I found
[36:00] out that I inherited something you know
[36:02] and you mean I got a great big Warehouse
[36:04] or something here I'd want me or not I
[36:06] don't give me no forfeit ladder Now give
[36:08] me a eight foot or nine foot maybe 12
[36:10] foot ladder you know because we're gonna
[36:11] go up there we're gonna get on them top
[36:13] shelves and we're gonna dig into there
[36:15] and find out what we inherited
[36:17] how many knows whenever you're talking
[36:19] about inheritance a lot of times you're
[36:20] talking about somebody Gotta Die before

[38:22] depends on what your preference is and
[38:24] you know we each have about as little
[38:26] interest on each other stuff sometimes
[38:28] because we're not in the same space

[38:38] God and we want more of God
[38:41] so you gotta first of all we know that
[38:43] you first of all got to get in the
[38:45] spirit of it amen no matter what you're
[38:47] doing and now we have received not the
[38:50] spirit of the world but the spirit which
[38:51] is of god that we might know the things
[38:55] that are freely given to us of God
[38:58] oh my friend Peter God what my I wasn't
[39:02] even thinking of this but isn't that
[39:04] kind of deep right there amen thinking
[39:06] that God was freely given to you
[39:10] amen all you had to do is believe my
[39:14] goodness that shouldn't be all that hard
[39:16] he's the one that's over he's the one
[39:19] that battled them demons he fought for
[39:21] it and then he bled he died he went to
[39:24] hell for you he rose again and he has
[39:26] freely given us all these things
[39:29] [Music]
[39:30] that sounds deep to me
[39:33] oh my which things also we speak not in
[39:36] The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but
[39:38] which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing
[39:40] spiritual things with the spiritual
[39:42] thing
[39:43] for the natural man receiveth not the
[39:45] things of the spirit of God for they are
[39:47] foolishness
[39:49] foolishness under him neither can they
[39:52] know him because they are spiritually
[39:54] discerned how many notes to the world
[39:56] and you know don't have the spirit amen
[39:58] it seems like a bunch of foolish
[39:59] preaching it meant foods that seem
[40:01] fooling to them but to us is the most
[40:03] precious thing amen is the stuff that we
[40:06] love to do all day every day we love to
[40:08] hear the preaching of the word
[40:10] amen because it has the power of
[40:12] Salvation in the preaching of the word
[40:14] foolishness to them it's not fully says
[40:17] to us
[40:19] oh my
[40:21] God but he that is spiritual
[40:25] now notice for the natural man receiving
[40:27] not the things of the spirit of God for
[40:29] their Spirit foolishness unto them
[40:31] neither can he know them because they
[40:33] are spiritually discerned but that is
[40:35] spiritual judges all things yet he
[40:37] himself is judged of no man for who hath
[40:40] known the mind of the Lord that he man
[40:42] instruct them but we have the mind of
[40:46] Christ
[40:54] to think that you've got God's mind
[40:59] you've got his way of thinking
[41:04] for Jesus
[41:07] oh my praise be to God
[41:11] amen all right
[41:14] praise be to God not Ephesians if you
[41:17] want let's go to Ephesians
[41:27] if Ephesians 3
[41:34] and 14.
[41:39] for this cause I bow my knees unto the
[41:42] father
[41:44] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[41:47] of whom the whole
[41:48] family in Heaven and Earth Lord to be
[41:51] strengthened with them with the might by
[41:53] his spirit in the Inner Man
[41:56] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[41:58] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[42:00] in your love may be able now notice now
[42:03] notice what he's talking about here this
[42:04] is scripture I want to get you may be
[42:06] able
[42:07] to comprehend
[42:10] with the Saints what is the width isn't
[42:13] that right the bread the breadth which
[42:16] is the width
[42:18] foreign
[42:24] the depth
[42:26] and the doubt and the Heights amen how
[42:29] high is that thing I want it
[42:32] amen
[42:34] that you may be able to comprehend and
[42:37] to know that which passes knowledge that
[42:41] you may be filled with the all the
[42:43] fullness of God not unto him that is
[42:46] able to do exceedingly abundantly above
[42:47] all that we could ask or think according
[42:49] to the power that worketh in him so here
[42:52] again I just wanted to read that the
[42:53] talk was talking Paul was talking about
[42:55] how did he wants us to be able to
[42:57] comprehend
[43:02] what the depth of God is
[43:06] praise be to God
[43:08] amen because I want to know don't you
[43:10] it's something about and I was and I was
[43:13] looking at the internet amen just some
[43:15] of those things and and something come
[43:17] up where it had a saying I believe it
[43:19] was John Bunyan that he made a statement
[43:22] he made a statement he says you know
[43:24] whatever God says is best is best
[43:31] no matter if every man in the world
[43:34] disagrees with it or is against it and I
[43:38] thought that's right whatever God says
[43:40] is best is best
[43:42] when I think about how that God has
[43:44] given us away and when you know and when
[43:47] you can comprehend that way because let
[43:49] me tell you
[43:52] life is full of darkness and mystery and
[43:55] uh and confusion and when you have what
[43:57] God has said
[43:59] when you have comprehension of God and
[44:02] his word and what his will is
[44:04] and what the true right way is
[44:07] you're a blessed person
[44:09] I don't know about you but I want to be
[44:10] able to comprehend it don't you
[44:13] amen
[44:15] praise the Lord I want to comprehend
[44:17] what the width the height the depth of
[44:21] God is
[44:22] praise be to God
[44:24] understanding one of the things that
[44:26] we've learned is the Way Up Is Down
[44:29] never
[44:31] right
[44:33] God's strength is ever again deeper
[44:36] unless you come to the death of yourself
[44:39] until you come on come all the way down
[44:42] and then you're ready to come back up
[44:44] so that's the amen then God can use you
[44:47] I believe that God can use you to slay
[44:51] Giants
[44:54] and not just Giants but armies
[44:58] amen
[44:59] praise be to God
[45:03] oh my
[45:07] amen we're gonna pick pick I'm thinking
[45:11] and I'm wanting to say things that's
[45:13] down in the list on my on my notes here
[45:16] but
[45:17] amen and it doesn't mind matter if it's
[45:20] one giant it doesn't matter if it's 600
[45:23] Philistines
[45:24] it means it don't matter if it's a
[45:27] thousand
[45:29] it doesn't matter if it's a whole Army
[45:32] of Egypt Moses with a stick in God went
[45:35] down and took over
[45:39] that's the
[45:41] yeah that's deep
[45:43] amen
[45:45] praise the Lord not a thought let me
[45:48] first of all start with the thought that
[45:49] I kind of had when I thought about the
[45:51] Deep things of God I I had this this
[45:53] thought first of of the um
[45:58] what do you call it
[46:01] the satisfaction or the contentment
[46:05] that a Christian has in Walking with God
[46:09] the contentment that you can feel
[46:11] Walking with God on a daily basis
[46:16] and I want to emphasize this tonight
[46:18] amen and I want to kind of bring this
[46:21] and
[46:22] it just pops into my mind how many knows
[46:25] everything you think has to be in
[46:26] weighed with the word but this is what
[46:28] what what coming to my heart and mind
[46:30] this week and what brought me to this
[46:32] message is what else can we ask for what
[46:35] more do you want
[46:38] what more do we want because how many
[46:40] knows we're never happy with what we
[46:42] have
[46:43] huh
[46:45] amen I'll tell you what we have a house
[46:47] we have a this out of the other my
[46:49] little house out there we have and so
[46:50] forth but do you realize how nice it is
[46:52] for me to go out there on that front
[46:54] porch and sit on that white rocker and
[46:55] drink my coffee every morning and enjoy
[46:58] no I'm at the biggest place
[47:00] and not by no means I got the fancy play
[47:03] but I enjoy what God gave me
[47:08] I'm intent with what I got gay man
[47:10] that's kind of how it was gone and
[47:13] people would just enjoy what God gave
[47:15] them they wouldn't be some discontent it
[47:17] wouldn't be so unhappy
[47:21] foreign
[47:22] God give us godliness with contentment
[47:28] that's deep
[47:30] why because we as human beings we always
[47:32] want we're too busy trying to better
[47:34] ourselves and we
[47:36] never get a chance to enjoy what God has
[47:40] already given us
[47:44] so chill
[47:45] and enjoy what God gave you
[47:48] quit stressing yourself out over more
[47:51] when you've already got all you need
[47:56] oh I don't have enough you got
[47:58] food you got arraignment you got a roof
[48:01] over your head Paul's head you're having
[48:03] food and Raymond
[48:05] we can do it well I'm a happy man
[48:10] Glory because you know what God hates
[48:13] somebody that's discontent
[48:16] I don't know about you but I don't like
[48:18] this contentment to myself
[48:21] God hates his contentment because the
[48:23] devil was right up there with God and he
[48:26] was discontent he was dissatisfied and
[48:29] you know what better man said about the
[48:30] world is filled with this side of five
[48:33] people
[48:41] but we as Christians look at Paul what
[48:44] he says
[48:46] but I speak in respect of one for I have
[48:48] learned and whatsoever State I am there
[48:52] with to be content
[48:55] how to be amazed
[48:58] I know everywhere I can do all things
[49:00] and everywhere I'm instructable to be
[49:03] full and to be hungry to abound and to
[49:05] suffer need but he says I know there's
[49:07] one thing that whatsoever said I am
[49:09] there with I am God can you be so happy
[49:12] Paul
[49:13] why why you're in prison you're involved
[49:16] because you've been taken care of
[49:18] your future is secured you have a God
[49:21] that's leading you
[49:23] have a garden that's guiding you you
[49:26] have a God that's comforting you you've
[49:28] got the god in creation you are you
[49:30] ain't got nothing to worry about
[49:32] [Applause]
[49:35] that's deep
[49:39] amen
[49:41] oh yeah well maybe talk about it yet but
[49:43] the fact that we know
[49:45] that your name was written before the
[49:47] sun was made before the Earth was made
[49:49] before this ball was made your name
[49:57] your name foundation of the world
[49:59] way back into the back part of God's
[50:01] mind
[50:03] you know what the prophet said we're
[50:05] understanding the back part again just
[50:07] the Bible is the complete revelation of
[50:10] Jesus Christ
[50:12] what was in the back of his mind
[50:14] before he started making the first star
[50:19] before I hung the first star moon
[50:24] who was in his mind I was in his mind
[50:29] that's why I'm here that's why you're
[50:31] here that day being deep I don't know
[50:33] what is
[50:36] we have the mind of Christ
[50:43] praise the Lord
[50:47] Hallelujah
[50:49] Hallelujah
[50:51] first one I thought back to my thought
[50:53] second Corinthians 5.
[50:56] foreign
[51:01] Corinthians 5
[51:04] verse 17 therefore
[51:06] If any man be in Christ here's a new
[51:09] creature
[51:10] all things are passed away behold all
[51:12] things are new
[51:14] amen
[51:16] aren't you glad for that
[51:20] now I'm gonna stop right there just I'm
[51:23] sorry but we're going to come up the
[51:24] stop sign right there before we go on
[51:26] I'm gonna pick up what comes up into my
[51:28] mind because I want to do this Tower to
[51:30] you first
[51:31] but how many believes that
[51:33] we're in the Promised Land
[51:36] the promised land of the Holy Ghost
[51:38] that's the Holy Ghost it's the promised
[51:39] land and I like what this second Peter 1
[51:42] and 4 says whereby are given unto us
[51:46] succeeding great and precious promises
[51:50] amen how many believes that we have
[51:51] great precious promises amen now notice
[51:55] so he says the old things are passed
[51:57] away behold all things are become new
[51:58] and all things are of God who has
[52:01] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[52:04] and it's given
[52:05] but us the ministry of reconciliation
[52:11] to it that God was
[52:14] in Christ reconciling the world unto
[52:16] himself not imputing us
[52:19] trespasses upon them and hath committed
[52:22] unto us the word of reconciliation now
[52:25] then we are ambassadors for Christ
[52:27] though as God did beseech You by us we
[52:31] pray you instead be reconciled amen it
[52:35] was a book of what
[52:36] a book of redemption
[52:40] a book of reconcilia
[52:42] should have hearted God and man was
[52:44] going to be reconciled again
[52:47] a man to think that we've been wrecking
[52:49] some I mean reason you have been
[52:51] reconciled yeah I'll tell you something
[52:53] deep amen when you think about the
[52:55] prophet of God saying that we are
[52:56] everywhere every state except this
[52:58] physical body we have been reconciled in
[53:00] the same spot in place that Adam was
[53:02] before the fall
[53:06] say that it's Mountain be moved and
[53:08] it'll be moved
[53:11] all things are possible to you
[53:14] when you reconciled that was deep
[53:17] just a simple message of reconciliation
[53:20] of God reconciling with man
[53:24] you and him becoming one again
[53:27] praise be to God aren't you glad after
[53:29] that
[53:30] oh my
[53:32] be reconciled to God for he have made us
[53:35] to be sin he hath made him to be sin
[53:41] for us
[53:43] who knew knows him
[53:45] that he might be made that we
[53:47] might be made the righteousness of God
[53:52] in him remember the church age book
[53:55] whether bam explained he said you know
[53:56] that when the what the blood washes us
[53:59] when we get clean that we become the
[54:01] very righteousness of God
[54:06] wow that you're just as right as his God
[54:09] is righteous
[54:10] you're just as holy as God is Holy
[54:16] daddy deep I don't know what it is
[54:21] the very righteousness of God
[54:24] why because you ain't gonna sit by him
[54:26] and be all dirty
[54:28] huh You're Gonna Be have to be righteous
[54:30] like he is
[54:32] you're going to live with him
[54:35] amen
[54:36] we say are we're gonna I'm gonna believe
[54:40] we already are
[54:41] you live with him every day
[54:44] I hope so
[54:46] amen
[54:48] oh my pray to you I thought
[54:50] reconciliation that's what it's all
[54:52] about
[54:53] amen
[54:58] Colossians
[55:02] no
[55:07] Galatians 2 20.
[55:10] Galatians 2 20 is another one
[55:22] and then
[55:24] notice how Paul says here
[55:28] I am crucified with Christ
[55:31] nevertheless I live
[55:34] yet not I but Christ liveth in me how
[55:39] many believe that and the life that I
[55:41] now live I live
[55:43] that I now live in the flesh I live by
[55:46] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[55:49] and gave himself for me Colossians 1 and
[55:52] verse 20 says 26 it says even the
[55:55] ministry which has been hid from ages
[55:58] and from
[56:00] three
[56:01] Generations
[56:03] but now it's made manifest to his Saints
[56:06] how many knows to whom God would make
[56:09] known what is the riches of the glory of
[56:12] this mystery
[56:14] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[56:18] you the hope of glory
[56:20] I mean everybody Baptist Christ the
[56:22] mystery you know somebody talking about
[56:24] Christ was the mystery and if Christ in
[56:26] his you he says then that makes you the
[56:29] ministry that was in God's mind before
[56:30] the foundation of the world people don't
[56:32] realize that they're walking especially
[56:35] their sisters or brothers away
[56:36] regressing do we have they don't realize
[56:38] that they're looking at the very mystery
[56:40] of almighty God that he had before the
[56:42] foundation of the world
[56:45] he would be in a union that would be
[56:47] Christ amen
[56:50] fight in the world
[56:53] that's the great mystery
[56:55] I don't know about you but I like
[56:56] Mysteries don't you
[56:58] mystery books
[56:59] you like a mystery book this is the
[57:01] greatest mystery book of all
[57:03] but the great mystery is what
[57:05] the great mystery Paul said that's been
[57:08] hid from ages
[57:11] which is Christ in you
[57:13] the hope of glory
[57:15] amen I don't know anything deeper than
[57:18] God in you
[57:19] living his own life out
[57:22] amen
[57:25] praise be to God
[57:27] let's look at a few more things shall we
[57:30] let's look at faith hope and love
[57:33] amen and I want to touch on this Faith a
[57:35] little bit because how many knows that
[57:37] faith is deep
[57:39] one of the things that God is that God
[57:41] grants to us is Faith it's deep
[57:46] we know that faith is a revelation
[57:48] that's given to you isn't that right
[57:50] of God revealing himself to you
[57:52] personally
[57:53] amen
[57:55] Faith Like Joshua
[57:57] faith that God had let's go back further
[58:02] we understand that the worlds were
[58:04] framed by the word of God
[58:08] faith in what he said and that the very
[58:10] faith that God said amen and there
[58:12] Joshua one day until God and man it was
[58:15] so one back there Joshua was so yielded
[58:18] to the plan of God that he could speak
[58:20] to the son and
[58:26] that's deep
[58:32] can you imagine how many scientists
[58:34] would disagree with you and would fuss
[58:35] and fight with you knives it couldn't
[58:37] have been
[58:38] everybody flew off if the sun stopped
[58:41] the moon stopped in the valley of
[58:43] whatever lawn
[58:46] I thought well I don't know what aggalon
[58:48] is
[58:49] probably
[58:52] yeah I go probably and
[58:55] it's kind of like Death Valley in a
[58:56] certain Valley maybe he was maybe
[58:58] Joshua's looking setting into certain
[58:59] Valley he says hold still Moon you stand
[59:03] Sun stand still where you're at God
[59:06] heard him
[59:07] stop the whole thing that's what faith
[59:10] will do
[59:18] Red Sea parted the walls come up
[59:21] faith is an hour for the other moves
[59:25] amen by faith are you saved by grace
[59:28] that not of yourselves
[59:31] Paul said the way that I live I live by
[59:34] the face of the Son of God I believe
[59:36] that's where you ought to live that's
[59:38] where I don't live that's our very
[59:39] driving force is the faith of almighty
[59:41] God
[59:42] in a person
[59:46] praise be to God
[59:51] amen
[59:52] the Reapers know and all about that
[59:54] Faith don't you
[59:55] God opening red season
[59:58] can't get over it and can't get under it
[1:00:00] and God takes you through just commit
[1:00:03] your case to the Lord
[1:00:05] if he can't handle it guess what no
[1:00:06] doctor can't either
[1:00:08] but when you trust the Lord in that
[1:00:10] watch God work
[1:00:11] yeah
[1:00:12] yeah man I actually glad to say
[1:00:19] like that
[1:00:20] Hallelujah
[1:00:22] God gives us faith
[1:00:26] go just down the road that
[1:00:29] in the side but I begin to think about
[1:00:30] Roe
[1:00:31] rope as I was driving down the road
[1:00:33] because in First Corinthians 13 chapter
[1:00:35] now abiding face hope and love isn't
[1:00:38] that right
[1:00:39] faith hope and love and I said well
[1:00:40] faith I know it's powerful it's so
[1:00:43] powerful
[1:00:44] it'll bring Giants and it'll slay Giants
[1:00:46] it'll kill all armies
[1:00:50] we're living by faith I'll tell you what
[1:00:52] you can be down in advance you can feel
[1:00:54] like
[1:00:55] they're just
[1:00:57] piles of demons on you and you can just
[1:00:59] say Dad let's get off of me
[1:01:02] let's watch him play everywhere
[1:01:05] they can't stop you better benefits when
[1:01:07] you've got a personal experience with
[1:01:08] God there's not enough devils in hell to
[1:01:10] stop you I want you to know there's a
[1:01:13] bunch of them
[1:01:17] or Son of God if he's got faith
[1:01:21] amen you'll fling every one of them off
[1:01:24] of you
[1:01:25] they'll get tired of fighting you and
[1:01:26] run off into the into the darkness back
[1:01:29] where they come from
[1:01:30] that's right they'll try to depress you
[1:01:33] try to make you hopeless
[1:01:36] but you know I thought what about hope
[1:01:38] what does Hope do well
[1:01:40] we know that one of the things that
[1:01:42] would keep anybody going
[1:01:44] if you were imprisoned
[1:01:47] if you
[1:01:49] or whatever your situation you're if
[1:01:52] you're in a hopeless situation
[1:01:54] the only thing that'll keep you going is
[1:01:55] Hope
[1:01:56] is that right and I thought you know
[1:01:58] it'd be like a prisoner
[1:02:00] like a prisoner in bars
[1:02:03] he said well I'm just going to spend the
[1:02:05] rest of my life behind bars but do you
[1:02:07] know of all the people that have escaped
[1:02:09] prison
[1:02:11] huh have you all heard of all the
[1:02:13] stories oh Alcatraz nobody can ever
[1:02:15] escape there but yet I heard it did
[1:02:18] huh
[1:02:19] why it doesn't matter how tight you are
[1:02:23] confined
[1:02:24] if you have hope
[1:02:26] you find a way out
[1:02:29] you figured out but now if you don't
[1:02:30] have hope you'll sit there and rot
[1:02:36] once you lose hope you'll just sit there
[1:02:37] hey man you got a chance in the world
[1:02:39] you know but that guy that wants to get
[1:02:41] out of there guess what he's gonna look
[1:02:44] alive he's gonna watch what that little
[1:02:47] guy does what time he does what time
[1:02:48] that door opens he's gonna do this out
[1:02:50] of the other he's going to survey when
[1:02:51] he goes out into into the playground

[1:02:55] where this wall is where that wall is
[1:02:56] how many walls do I get to get through
[1:02:58] to get out
[1:02:59] he'll be conniving hello because he's
[1:03:01] got hope that he's going to get out
[1:03:03] that's why they escape
[1:03:04] that's what hope does

[1:08:09] different religions and we want to do
[1:08:10] what's right we don't know which one to

[1:08:19] in Malachi 4 for you he put in Malachi 4

[1:08:25] when he spoke amen it was unrebound

[1:08:31] it's a voice that you hear
[1:08:34] and he called to you call to me
[1:08:38] and we responded my sheep hear my voice
[1:08:42] and another state won't follow

[1:16:28] god listen to me
[1:16:30] I don't know why brother Joe but
[1:16:32] sometimes it feels like God puts each
[1:16:34] person he'll make you feel like you are
[1:16:36] all alone
[1:16:38] sometime in your walk it could easily
[1:16:39] happen where you feel like there's
[1:16:41] you're all alone
[1:16:43] but you know what he brings us to that
[1:16:45] place to where he doesn't matter if
[1:16:46] you're all alone you will walk your walk
[1:16:48] is to be alone with God
[1:16:51] it's not if everybody treats you right
[1:16:52] and everybody loves you and everybody's
[1:16:54] doing good for you then you'll love God
[1:16:56] no you got nothing to do with it
[1:16:57] it's persecution
[1:17:00] is separation if you're all by yourself

[1:17:05] separate me from the love of God
[1:17:08] Jesus said if you love wife nor husband
[1:17:10] more
[1:17:12] than me you're not worthy of me
[1:17:15] is that you and your wife or your
[1:17:17] husband or your land or your disorder

[1:17:37] when the winds blowing when the swords
[1:17:40] come amen the devil blow as hard as he
[1:17:41] wants all it does is make me stronger
[1:17:48] oh my well I'm not sure what I call it
[1:17:51] here a few Services go the more the
[1:17:52] devil blows the strong you get
[1:17:55] it's kind of productive
[1:17:57] the devil's is blowing and he's hissing
[1:18:00] in the trials that come your way and
[1:18:02] then it's counterproductive
[1:18:05] I don't care how much Leo this tear no
[1:18:08] matter what the devil throws at us
[1:18:10] the trial of your faith being much more
[1:18:13] precious than a gold
[1:18:15] [Applause]
[1:18:16] deep
[1:18:19] the trial that you go through it is what
[1:18:21] dresses you it's what molds you it's the
[1:18:24] very gold it's the character picture
[1:18:28] that you're going to take with you
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:31] that's deep
[1:18:33] like Peter said and I wanted to bring
[1:18:35] that in the other Deep thing is those
[1:18:37] trials that we go through
[1:18:38] they're more precious in Gold than
[1:18:40] perishes
[1:18:41] because it's what makes you and what
[1:18:43] molds you
[1:18:45] it's what teaches to go on our knees
[1:18:48] we can't do nothing else we can't get
[1:18:50] over it you can't get around to hey but
[1:18:52] he can take you through
[1:18:55] and none I'm too bad to have that kind
[1:18:59] of goal remember laodice said this
[1:19:00] lukewarm when I was sitting in this I
[1:19:03] thought man this is the age of people or
[1:19:05] nothing but muck I believe the prophet
[1:19:06] of God said there's just people would
[1:19:08] just become muck
[1:19:10] laughs
[1:19:12] just a big old jellyfish there's just
[1:19:14] nothing there but in the midst of all
[1:19:16] that he's gonna have a people without
[1:19:19] spout without wrinkle and then they're
[1:19:21] on a rock
[1:19:23] oh another they're in the image of
[1:19:25] Christ they're not mocked in the image
[1:19:27] of Christ
[1:19:29] in the middle of it all
[1:19:30] in the middle of this worst age as ever
[1:19:32] when people don't know
[1:19:34] which side they belong they don't if
[1:19:35] they're a man or a woman
[1:19:37] huh
[1:19:41] uh
[1:19:44] I think Brad was saying something about
[1:19:45] you can't expect I'm not thinking it was
[1:19:48] him something about you can't expect a
[1:19:49] 12 year old child to make a decision
[1:19:55] the kind of decisions they make isn't
[1:19:56] that right
[1:19:57] they're not wise enough to and I thought
[1:19:59] you know what
[1:20:00] a 12 year old can't either but be
[1:20:02] Senators that are 80 years old they
[1:20:03] gotta lick a sense either they aren't
[1:20:05] able to make any choices either
[1:20:16] right because they're the ones they're
[1:20:18] trying to confuse him in the first
[1:20:19] they're worse than a 12 year old right
[1:20:21] most 12 year olds could probably tell
[1:20:22] them hey you bunch of you guys are your
[1:20:24] little ignoramus here
[1:20:28] amen
[1:20:29] that's right I apologize all of them are
[1:20:32] brainless yeah I don't mind brainless
[1:20:35] completely lost their brain completely
[1:20:37] lost their mind the prophet said
[1:20:39] he's called completely going sane
[1:20:42] Insanity you are insane and I'm not
[1:20:45] putting you in the insane institution
[1:20:47] because you're already in it
[1:20:50] this whole world is an insane
[1:20:52] Institution
[1:20:54] and in the midst of the insane
[1:20:56] institution we got a few of them going
[1:20:58] around trying to keep some sanity
[1:21:01] amen
[1:21:04] that's God's church and when those are
[1:21:06] gone
[1:21:07] it's time to get rid of it all
[1:21:10] amen
[1:21:12] praise the Lord
[1:21:14] oh aren't you glad God Moses and shakes
[1:21:18] us
[1:21:18] those trials that come your way the Deep
[1:21:21] part of those is it's kind of productive
[1:21:25] when the wind blows
[1:21:28] what does it do that tree stretches its
[1:21:31] roots
[1:21:33] root stretch
[1:21:34] almost both empty goes deeper next time
[1:21:38] goes deeper goes deeper
[1:21:40] I love a tree that's planted by the
[1:21:43] water amen where it can go way deep but
[1:21:46] it can go way out doing the wind coming
[1:21:48] kept going
[1:21:49] on you and I have been planted by the
[1:21:51] rivers of water
[1:21:53] you can let your roots go away in here
[1:21:58] Oh I thought about personal revelation
[1:22:00] folks we need personal revelation more
[1:22:01] than anything else in the world
[1:22:03] while it's a rock that'll keep you Amen
[1:22:05] in in scripture and all other ground is
[1:22:08] sinking sand ain't it oh crap it's a
[1:22:11] solid rock I Stand All on the ground is
[1:22:13] exactly quicksand and it's going down
[1:22:16] but we're building a house on a rock
[1:22:21] Amen on a personal revelation of
[1:22:24] almighty God
[1:22:25] somebody believes it we have to
[1:22:28] realize more
[1:22:30] what we are and Who We Are God's
[1:22:33] children humbly amen
[1:22:35] all right we got five minutes can I go
[1:22:37] more

[1:22:41] realize let me go on listen we're not
[1:22:43] done yet

[1:22:46] day long we are counted as she best for
[1:22:48] the slaughter need all these things we
[1:22:51] are
[1:22:53] did I miss something
[1:22:56] all these things we are conquerors
[1:22:59] that's what I wanted to hear no we're
[1:23:00] more
[1:23:03] that's deeper right
[1:23:04] oh we're more than conquerors we're
[1:23:07] through him that loved us
[1:23:11] we could just run and jump and shouting
[1:23:14] huh
[1:23:15] to figure more than a conqueror he
[1:23:18] conquered for you
[1:23:20] and he give you the victory
[1:23:22] and they do to make three
[1:23:26] Oh I thought about that a while ago I
[1:23:28] thought you know
[1:23:31] when you become a Christian when you
[1:23:33] come dead to yourself then you're ready
[1:23:35] to slay Giants no
[1:23:37] no
[1:23:40] what it means is if you have actually
[1:23:43] whipped yourself and you actually come
[1:23:44] to the death of yourself that means that
[1:23:46] you have already
[1:23:47] whipped the Giant
[1:23:49] you've already quit the biggest giant
[1:23:51] you'll ever win that is yourself
[1:23:54] oh we all know that mind of ours that
[1:23:57] heart of mind to live flesh of this
[1:23:59] flesh
[1:24:00] hey man you better you if you you know
[1:24:01] you got to overcome that thing isn't
[1:24:03] that right you can overcome that and
[1:24:05] whip that you've done it brother bam
[1:24:07] said what's the greatest enemy he had
[1:24:10] himself
[1:24:11] so if you win that you're not tell the
[1:24:13] giant you're ready or something bigger
[1:24:15] than Giants now you're ready for armies
[1:24:21] oh man brother Tommy we talk about

[1:24:43] just love to take the shield of faith

[1:25:44] can life separate us
[1:25:47] and Angels separate us
