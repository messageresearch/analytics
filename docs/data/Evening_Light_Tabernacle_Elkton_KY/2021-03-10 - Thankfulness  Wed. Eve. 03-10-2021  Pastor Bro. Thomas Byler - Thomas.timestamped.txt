[32:30] stephen amen that he's doing better so
[32:33] that's all good
[32:35] amen amen
[32:39] let's turn to luke 17.
[32:45] luke 17.
[33:02] and colossians 3 15.
[33:10] luke 17 beginning with verse 12.
[33:14] and as he entered into a certain village
[33:17] there met him 10 men that were lepers
[33:20] switched to the far off
[33:22] and they lifted up their voices and said
[33:24] jesus master have mercy on us
[33:27] and when he saw them he said unto them
[33:29] go show yourselves unto the priests
[33:31] and it came to pass that as they went
[33:34] they were cleansed
[33:35] and one of them when he saw that he was
[33:38] healed
[33:38] turned back and with a loud voice
[33:41] glorified god and fell down
[33:43] on his face at his feet giving him
[33:47] thanks
[33:47] and he was and he was a samaritan
[33:51] and jesus answered and said where
[33:54] were there not ten cleansed but where
[33:57] are
[33:58] the nine there are not found that return
[34:02] to give glory to god
[34:03] save this stranger and he said unto him
[34:06] arise
[34:06] and go thy way that faith has made the
[34:09] whole
[34:10] in colossians three
[34:19] colossians 3.
[34:38] verse 15 and let the peace of god
[34:43] rule in your hearts to which also
[34:47] you are called in one body
[34:50] and be ye thankful may god had his
[34:53] blessings to read in the words you can
[34:55] be seated
[34:56] tonight i want to speak on a subject
[34:58] that i've probably spoken on here
[35:00] many times but i want to speak on it
[35:02] again because
[35:04] this morning as i was just concentrating
[35:06] and meeting
[35:07] meditating on the lord i mean this is
[35:09] the thought that came to me
[35:11] amen so tonight we want to speak on
[35:13] thankfulness
[35:15] thankfulness amen
[35:19] amen in everything give thanks amen
[35:23] in everything
[35:27] and so i was thinking about the state
[35:30] of being thankful first of all we
[35:32] realize that
[35:34] to be thankful is actually a state that
[35:36] a person is in
[35:38] it's a state just kind of like you know
[35:41] when we get over to heaven we know that
[35:43] what's going to make heaven heaven
[35:46] is the state that you're in amen
[35:50] just your this your state of being
[35:54] amen and i read that part also i didn't
[35:57] even know that that
[35:58] was in that same verse but today
[36:01] as i was working and doing a few
[36:03] different things and
[36:04] the wind was just blowing and whistling
[36:06] and
[36:07] you know especially in the wintertime
[36:09] that wind can sound kind of spooky and
[36:12] you know kind of haunting and
[36:16] you know and so but you know the thought
[36:19] that came to me i was just like well you
[36:20] know i'm so glad that i don't have to be
[36:22] haunted
[36:24] i don't have to be feeling condemned i
[36:26] don't have to feel
[36:27] bad or i don't have to be spooky in my
[36:31] spirit
[36:33] i just felt that peace in my heart you
[36:35] know and i thought about that scripture
[36:37] came to me but it says let the peace of
[36:39] god
[36:40] rule i like that
[36:44] let it rule your life
[36:48] let it rule you amen control you
[36:52] it also is a state of being i mean knows
[36:55] that it's a part of being
[36:56] a state of being amen tonight talking
[36:59] about thankfulness i truly believe that
[37:00] this
[37:01] is one of the large
[37:05] uh one of the large characters
[37:09] all right parts of our character it is a
[37:11] part of our characters many different
[37:13] aspects to character
[37:15] but being thankful is a large part of a
[37:18] character that
[37:19] god is looking for amen in each and
[37:22] every one of us
[37:24] so with the help of the lord tonight for
[37:25] a little while we want to go and use
[37:26] different illustrations and the one
[37:28] main one probably that i want to use
[37:30] will be the apostle paul
[37:32] amen and i wrote down here is i just got
[37:35] the meditating
[37:36] and i got to thinking about what satisfy
[37:40] i mean what
[37:42] where's my other paper
[37:48] being satisfied okay
[37:52] found it all the way under everything
[37:55] all right
[37:56] the state of being thankful what leads
[37:59] to that and what causes a person
[38:02] to be thankful a thankful person amen
[38:06] first of all we realize that for our
[38:08] person
[38:09] uh to be thankful first of all you have
[38:11] to be content
[38:14] amen you have to be happy
[38:18] all right what leads to discontent
[38:21] actually yeah and content
[38:24] actually is a state to where you're
[38:28] satisfied amen in other words for
[38:31] content would be
[38:32] satisfied you're satisfied
[38:35] am i right now all of these
[38:39] all of these other words the opposite of
[38:41] being content would be discontent
[38:45] and how many knows that discontent would
[38:47] be would bring
[38:48] dissatisfaction it you surely wouldn't
[38:51] be thankful for your
[38:53] discontented state right
[38:56] you wouldn't be satisfied well thank you
[38:59] lord for letting me be dissatisfied no
[39:01] you just wouldn't match with it wouldn't
[39:02] work right
[39:04] no it means that you're satisfied
[39:10] amen brother brethren he makes a
[39:12] statement and identified with christ
[39:13] he says you know there in this in this
[39:16] here country today
[39:17] there is so many dissatisfied
[39:22] people amen
[39:25] now we all know that when you take uh
[39:29] for granted the things that you have
[39:33] you're not happy you're not satisfied
[39:36] with the good things that you have i
[39:38] mean those most likely you're even gonna
[39:40] lose those good things
[39:43] and we see in our nation today that
[39:46] people are not content with the
[39:47] liberties that they have
[39:50] amen they're not content with the
[39:52] liberty they're not satisfied
[39:54] with the liberties that they have
[39:58] and you know it's quite something how
[40:00] and i'm just going to put a little bit
[40:01] of my own in here and you forgive me
[40:04] but you know we have a congress and i'm
[40:07] i guess they're the ones that are
[40:08] supposed to be uh making laws there are
[40:11] lawmakers
[40:12] you nearly be busy busy busy busy busy
[40:15] busy making
[40:15] making laws making more laws making more
[40:18] laws
[40:19] i don't know about you but i thought
[40:20] already i said let's take a break
[40:23] you know because more laws just means
[40:26] more more rules
[40:28] more things you got to follow do this do
[40:30] that do this do that
[40:31] you know until when are they going to
[40:32] stop making laws pretty soon we'll be
[40:34] like most other countries that
[40:35] you can't blow your nose without a
[40:37] permit
[40:41] i mean it's bad you go to canada go to
[40:43] other places you know
[40:44] but they're making laws they're doing
[40:46] all these things
[40:47] but we know and you know they've made me
[40:49] we already know that they've made so
[40:51] many laws that it
[40:52] disaffects most of the laws they made
[40:56] and you know they're just never
[40:58] satisfied
[41:00] this world the america not just america
[41:03] but the world over
[41:05] people are dissatisfied they're
[41:08] discontent
[41:09] and they are not thankful
[41:15] thankful being thankful means you're in
[41:17] a state of satisfaction
[41:19] you're satisfied you're happy
[41:23] we find that there's a lot of people
[41:24] that are not happy
[41:35] and that's sad because we ought to be
[41:38] the happiest people on the earth
[41:40] we ought to be the most contented people
[41:42] on the face of the earth
[41:45] most and you know people are just never
[41:48] satisfied no matter how good people get
[41:50] it
[41:50] they're still not satisfied now let me
[41:53] just say this the reason that i
[41:54] mentioned a minute ago that being
[41:56] satisfied and being thankful
[41:57] is part of a major part of our character
[42:01] and we know that god in all of this
[42:04] uh is looking for character
[42:07] to live with for eternity that's what
[42:09] he's looking for
[42:11] and the only thing that we're going to
[42:12] take with us when we draw our last
[42:14] breath
[42:14] it's not our money not a bigger bank
[42:16] account
[42:17] it's nothing you're gonna take nothing
[42:19] with you except your character
[42:21] that's all you can take with you
[42:24] amen and so
[42:28] i truly believe that people are so busy
[42:33] getting stuff getting rich
[42:36] so busy with getting more
[42:39] that they forgot what real
[42:45] prosperity is what real
[42:49] prosperity is
[42:52] can anybody think about what real
[42:54] prosperity is in a scriptural sense
[42:56] something the bible says
[42:58] something that's great cain
[43:04] huh we'll read it after a while but the
[43:08] bible says
[43:08] godliness with contentment
[43:12] is great gain in other words if you're
[43:15] godly
[43:16] and you're content you have gained a
[43:20] whole
[43:21] lot you're real rich
[43:24] you've really gotten somewhere in life
[43:28] if you're godly and you're content
[43:32] godliness with contentment pulse that is
[43:36] great gain we'll get into that a little
[43:40] bit
[43:42] but i truly believe that it's part of a
[43:44] a christian and it's
[43:45] it's a it's a beautiful it's a beautiful
[43:49] beautiful beautiful place to be
[43:54] a place to where you're just a thankful
[43:57] person
[44:00] thankfulness is also a very very very
[44:03] positive thing
[44:05] it's not negative at all
[44:09] not negative it's it's totally positive
[44:12] and remember this
[44:13] that the holy spirit is always
[44:17] positive never negative
[44:22] nobody likes to live with a discontented
[44:25] mate
[44:26] a unhappy mate huh
[44:30] unsatisfied mate because we know what
[44:32] comes with that
[44:33] murmuring complaining nothing's ever
[44:37] gone
[44:37] my it's just a horrible person to live
[44:39] with
[44:41] i think brother baby said he says god
[44:42] don't never let the devil crown
[44:45] my life being a crabby old man
[44:48] or let my wife be a crabby old woman
[44:52] amen no never
[44:55] let the devil crown your life with that
[44:59] and that goes for us young people too
[45:00] don't let him crown with your life with
[45:02] being crabby and i
[45:06] i thought about a person that had this
[45:09] had this state i'm going to call it a
[45:12] state of thankfulness
[45:14] they live people that live in a state of
[45:17] thankfulness
[45:18] live in a state of satisfaction
[45:21] it's people that you like to be around i
[45:24] like to be around somebody that's
[45:25] satisfied
[45:29] i like when my wife is satisfied huh
[45:33] it's my job to make sure my wife is
[45:35] satisfied
[45:36] huh isn't that right
[45:41] god doesn't want to live up there with a
[45:42] dissatisfied person
[45:45] huh and you know most people
[45:48] think that they're satisfied when
[45:51] everything
[45:52] might they have what they want
[45:54] everything is going good
[45:56] right there's no adversity everything's
[46:00] on the mountaintop huh
[46:03] it's good and easy to be thankful on the
[46:05] mountaintop
[46:07] everything going good right but god
[46:10] wants more out of us
[46:12] than to be thankful just on a
[46:13] mountaintop when things are going good
[46:16] because we know that god has designed
[46:18] this world
[46:19] this world has been created and designed
[46:24] with adversity all right
[46:28] this world is created with adversity i
[46:31] mean having to
[46:31] get up and go to work and then it
[46:33] doesn't go right you get a flat tire on
[46:36] the way to work
[46:38] and you hurt yourself changing the tire
[46:40] everything can go wrong will go wrong
[46:43] murphy says so
[46:46] that's right so god created adversity
[46:51] he created adversity so much until
[46:55] not everything's going to always go good
[46:57] and so it's going to get
[46:58] easy to be a complainer easy to be
[47:02] unhappy to easy to be unthankful
[47:07] amen easy because of the adversity
[47:11] that is in the world but you know
[47:14] in the middle of all of that and i want
[47:16] to talk in a minute
[47:18] i'll bring it up but when you're a
[47:20] thankful person
[47:22] you're like the lady that always had
[47:24] something
[47:25] good to say about somebody
[47:28] how many of us when you when you when
[47:30] you're a thankful person
[47:33] even brother bam says if you can't say
[47:34] something good about somebody don't say
[47:36] anything at all
[47:38] never say something negative about
[47:40] somebody
[47:42] okay and so they this man did he said
[47:46] hey you know we'll get this lady
[47:48] we'll get her we'll get her to say
[47:50] something negative about somebody
[47:52] right and it says lady what about the
[47:55] devil
[47:56] huh and she had something good to say
[48:00] about him she said
[48:01] well he's a good adversary
[48:06] right he's a good adversary my
[48:10] mama she was so positive
[48:13] amen and she'd probably be saying but i
[48:15] thank the lord for delivering him from
[48:17] my
[48:18] adversary huh
[48:22] okay so praise the lord that's right to
[48:26] be satisfied a place of satisfied
[48:29] and you know it's not about
[48:32] whether or not everything is going good
[48:35] for you
[48:36] that you should be content and satisfied
[48:39] and a thankful person that right
[48:43] let me just mention before i use paul
[48:45] for my illa main illustration tonight
[48:50] i want to use him for my main
[48:52] illustration but i want to talk to you
[48:53] about one other person
[48:57] that really went down into pages of
[49:01] history american history
[49:03] as a hero it was stonewall jackson
[49:08] huh and he was asked why in the world
[49:12] how can you just stand there bullets and
[49:14] arrows flying by you and
[49:16] all this that or the other and you just
[49:17] stand there like a stone
[49:20] whoa i don't know about you but i think
[49:24] i would think you need to move right
[49:26] brother
[49:26] move you know so that it can't be a hard
[49:29] target to hit
[49:30] but just to stand there and hold the
[49:32] line just directing his men and so forth
[49:36] stonewall jackson had to be completely
[49:39] satisfied
[49:42] of where he was
[49:46] huh in the middle of getting arrows
[49:48] flung by your head and everything else
[49:51] hatchets flying by you who knows what
[49:53] all and he kicked this they asked this
[49:56] question what
[49:57] why why do you do this now how can you
[49:59] do this he kicked the ground with his
[50:01] foot
[50:02] and what did he say i don't never take a
[50:05] drink
[50:06] of water without thanking the lord for
[50:14] he was a thankful guy he was content
[50:18] and happy with the state that he was in
[50:22] where he was at see being thankful
[50:26] it is not whether everything's going
[50:27] good and you got something special just
[50:29] out of the other but it's a state of
[50:31] being someplace
[50:33] being the state that you are and i want
[50:35] to tell you that place the secret place
[50:37] that that is
[50:38] and that we all want to be and that is
[50:40] in christ
[50:42] jesus when you're in him
[50:45] folks when you are in christ you can be
[50:47] a thankful person
[50:50] because it don't matter life death good
[50:52] time bad time no matter what comes or
[50:54] goes
[50:56] you're a thankful person because why
[50:58] you're in heavenly places in christ
[51:00] jesus
[51:01] and he must have been ready to gold and
[51:03] the second the arrow struck him
[51:05] through his heart or wherever it was he
[51:07] was ready to go because he had a
[51:09] relationship
[51:10] with the master
[51:15] and truly he did what the scripture says
[51:17] in all things
[51:19] give thanks i like that song give thanks
[51:22] with a grateful heart
[51:24] amen when we come to the house of god
[51:26] like the song says i will enter his
[51:28] gates
[51:29] with thanksgiving
[51:34] gratitude it's also a form of worship
[51:38] because remember when that leper fell
[51:40] down he worshipped from god and
[51:41] glorified god
[51:43] and was thanking him thank you thank you
[51:45] thank you lord
[51:46] amen for opening my eyes
[51:50] the others were such a state of being
[51:52] thankful for their eyesight but they
[51:54] forgot where it came from
[51:55] jesus says where's the others at
[51:58] huh amen
[52:03] so we look at him look at look at him
[52:06] and snowball jackson how
[52:07] where he must have been in that place
[52:09] there's that place
[52:10] i truly believe that we can get locked
[52:13] in behind the holies of holies
[52:15] whenever you receive the holy spirit
[52:17] amen the world should become
[52:19] shut off to you you don't hear all the
[52:21] sounds of the world and everything else
[52:24] amen
[52:27] yeah i don't know about you but i need
[52:30] to get
[52:31] shut in with god more people don't
[52:34] realize i don't realize even i was
[52:36] telling my wife on the way to work
[52:38] to way to work well tonight's work so
[52:40] here i am
[52:41] the way to church i said you know you
[52:44] know honey i says i really
[52:46] you know because yesterday we got to
[52:49] drive and do something me and my son and
[52:51] so forth and
[52:51] and on the way just to listen to gospel
[52:54] music and to
[52:55] meditate and just just to have that
[52:57] music how many knows music
[52:58] inspires just to be in that atmosphere
[53:01] of music and prayer and talking to the
[53:03] lord and
[53:04] it really does something to you and if
[53:07] you get too busy and i do i get too busy
[53:09] to where
[53:10] you can take an hour or two and just get
[53:12] away basking songs bask in prayer
[53:15] basket talking to the lord huh it makes
[53:18] a huge difference
[53:22] in everything about you
[53:25] if you're nervous if you're upset but
[53:26] it'll just calm you right down
[53:30] amen just like these thoughts that come
[53:33] here and i said honey i get my messages
[53:35] in that presence and so forth and he
[53:37] gives me all these things you know it
[53:38] begins to pour out but
[53:39] i need to spend more time i mean would
[53:42] be with me
[53:43] we really need to spend more time in the
[53:45] presence of god
[53:46] and i grant you we'll be thankful
[53:48] because that's the only thing that
[53:49] really
[53:50] gives you strength and so forth
[53:54] amen praise the lord
[54:02] so it's not being thankful it's not in
[54:05] having everything just right and
[54:07] everything good
[54:08] right but it's in being in the lord
[54:12] that's what it's all about it's being in
[54:14] christ
[54:15] that makes you a thankful person amen
[54:18] some
[54:18] so many times in the world that you and
[54:21] i are living in
[54:23] people are not thankful doesn't matter
[54:25] how much they get people
[54:26] with a you know you take people that
[54:29] have become a billionaire
[54:32] they weren't thankful with 1 million 2
[54:34] million had to be 100 million not 100
[54:36] million with a thousand million a
[54:37] billion
[54:39] you know that it's one billion so money
[54:41] can it never satisfies
[54:44] they're never content with what they
[54:46] have
[54:48] they always have to have more amen
[54:51] there's only one thing that brings
[54:53] contentment and that is having peace
[54:56] with god there's nothing that'll bring
[54:58] contentment in your life like having
[55:00] peace with god well
[55:01] because if you're not at peace with god
[55:03] folks you're never going to be content i
[55:05] mean
[55:06] until you get right with god the way
[55:07] you're supposed to be you're never going
[55:08] to have contentment
[55:10] you're never going to be no person
[55:11] you're not going to be satisfied you
[55:13] find a person that says satisfied
[55:14] remember to not right with god
[55:17] huh that's why brother bam says the
[55:20] hospitals are full of them there's
[55:21] so people everywhere the insane
[55:24] institutions
[55:24] are my you know people taking drugs and
[55:28] all these they're not satisfied they're
[55:29] not content
[55:30] they're not happy amen
[55:34] they're not thankful amen because why
[55:38] because they're not in the right place
[55:42] he says you know the insane institutions
[55:45] are overrun
[55:46] dissatisfied they don't know what do
[55:47] they want to do
[55:49] there seems just to be something that
[55:51] they're reaching after but they never
[55:54] come to it
[55:57] amen how many wants to come to it i want
[56:00] to come to that place
[56:03] where all that comes forth from me
[56:06] is gratefulness to god for what he does
[56:10] and for what he needs
[56:12] means absolutely taking full benefits
[56:14] we're beneficiaries of what christ did
[56:16] for us
[56:17] on calvary okay let's go to paul
[56:20] let's talk about paul for a little bit
[56:23] all right
[56:24] number one will be second corinthians
[56:28] 11.
[56:31] second corinthians 11.
[56:40] i mean it was paul he really had a hard
[56:42] life
[56:44] even when jesus talked to him he talked
[56:47] about
[56:47] how i'm going to show you all the things
[56:50] that you're going to
[56:51] suffer from my name's sake what an
[56:54] introduce what an introduction
[56:56] to a ministry christ telling you you're
[56:58] going to suffer
[56:59] a lot of things for me
[57:06] second corinthians 11 verse 22
[57:10] are they hebrews so am i are they
[57:11] israelites so am i
[57:13] are they the seed of abraham so am i are
[57:15] they ministers of christ i speak as a
[57:18] fool i am more
[57:20] in laborers more abundant in stripes
[57:22] above
[57:23] measure in imprisons more frequent and
[57:25] deaths often
[57:28] of the jews five times received i
[57:31] 40 stripes save one
[57:35] five times thrice
[57:38] was i beaten with rods once
[57:41] was i stoned
[57:45] my thrice
[57:48] three times i suffered shipwreck
[57:53] come on folks people say paul you ain't
[57:56] living right
[57:58] you cannot be living right three times
[58:01] every time you get don't get on the
[58:03] water ball you're gonna go down

[58:09] gonna get stoned

[58:14] used to it
[58:16] yeah you think the lord delivered for me
[58:19] all this no
[58:20] he didn't paul had a reason
[58:24] to complain matter of fact i thought
[58:27] about adding a chapter to acts or
[58:29] hebrews and writing out what paul could
[58:32] have complained about
[58:33] and how he could have wrote a chapter of
[58:36] complaining
[58:37] and being unthankful but paul never did
[58:39] any
[58:41] a night and a day i have been in the
[58:44] deep in journeyings
[58:45] often in perils of water in perils of
[58:49] robbers
[58:51] amen i was proud of my granddaughter
[58:56] donna said that elena came to her and
[58:59] says
[59:00] donna i already had my devotions i just
[59:02] had my devotion she can read
[59:05] and she says well what did you find out
[59:07] what did you read you know how dominant

[59:26] character
[59:27] and of course my wife went to explaining
[59:30] why and all of that you know but he was
[59:31] like
[59:32] wow that's pretty strong but that's what
[59:34] she was reading
[59:36] in journeys off from perils of the water
[59:38] perils of rob or perils by my own
[59:40] countrymen
[59:41] in perils by the heathen in perils in
[59:44] the city in perils in the wilderness
[59:46] in perils in the sea in perils among
[59:48] false brethren
[59:50] in weariness and painfulness
[59:53] in watchings often and thirst
[59:57] in fastings often in cold
[1:00:01] and nakedness hello how many knows one
[1:00:04] time he
[1:00:04] asked timmy timothy to bring his coat
[1:00:06] it's cold he was shivering maybe in jail
[1:00:09] he had the shiver sitting in a cold dark
[1:00:11] tail
[1:00:11] just shivering away cold
[1:00:15] yeah like you would see a dog out there
[1:00:17] somewhere
[1:00:18] shivering in the cold he had it rough
[1:00:24] besides those things that are within
[1:00:26] that which cometh upon
[1:00:27] dave me daily the cares of all the
[1:00:29] churches
[1:00:30] who is weak and i am not weak who is
[1:00:32] offended and i am not
[1:00:34] amen that falls in look if you got a
[1:00:37] reason to complain if you got a reason
[1:00:38] to not be thankful
[1:00:39] i've got more of a reason
[1:00:43] if i must need glory i will glory into
[1:00:46] things which concern
[1:00:47] my infirmities amen
[1:00:51] i didn't write this down but i just
[1:00:53] looked
[1:00:54] across the page there
[1:01:01] which is perfect look over into
[1:01:06] verse 9 of chapter 12. and he said unto
[1:01:09] me my grace is sufficient for thee for
[1:01:11] my strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:01:13] most gladly therefore will i rather
[1:01:16] glory in mine infirmities that the power
[1:01:18] of christ may rest upon me
[1:01:20] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[1:01:24] in reproaches look how positive the holy
[1:01:27] ghost was
[1:01:29] in paul
[1:01:34] in necessities in persecutions
[1:01:38] in distresses for christ's sake for when
[1:01:40] i am weak
[1:01:41] then am i strong
[1:01:45] amen let's go to second corinthians 4
[1:01:49] 7 to 9.
[1:02:00] 4 7-9 paul says this way
[1:02:05] but we have this treasure in earth and
[1:02:07] vessels now remember
[1:02:08] he said just over here a page further
[1:02:11] over
[1:02:12] i believe it was he said
[1:02:17] he said most gladly therefore will i
[1:02:19] rather glory and remind infirmities that
[1:02:21] the power of christ
[1:02:23] may rest upon me he realized that when
[1:02:25] these things come
[1:02:27] that's when you have to have that peace
[1:02:29] in your heart
[1:02:30] you know right and the power of god will
[1:02:33] come forth i will take care of it
[1:02:36] so here he was once again saying we have
[1:02:38] this treasure in our earthly vessels
[1:02:41] that the excellency of the power
[1:02:43] may be of god and not of us we are
[1:02:46] troubled on every side
[1:02:48] yet not distressed amen
[1:02:52] amen something positive we are perplexed
[1:02:55] but we're not in despair we're
[1:02:59] persecuted but
[1:03:00] praise be to god hallelujah somebody say
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:04] but we're not forsaken every time
[1:03:08] no matter how bad it was paul always had
[1:03:11] something good to say
[1:03:13] how many knows that's the holy ghost
[1:03:16] that's what the holy ghost will do
[1:03:17] doesn't matter how bad it is he'll
[1:03:19] always have something
[1:03:21] positive to say just like that woman
[1:03:23] talking about
[1:03:25] the adversary of the devil
[1:03:29] now let's go to philippians
[1:03:37] philippians
[1:03:42] 4.
[1:03:46] philippians 4 and verse 11.
[1:03:51] well let's go let's read verse 8 a
[1:03:53] little bit longer let's take a little
[1:03:54] further journey down
[1:03:55] this path of the word amen see what the
[1:03:58] lord will teach us
[1:03:59] verse 8 says finally brethren whatsoever
[1:04:02] things are true
[1:04:04] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:04:07] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:04:09] pure
[1:04:10] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[1:04:12] things are of good report if there be
[1:04:15] any virtue or if there be any praise
[1:04:18] think on these things notice how that
[1:04:22] one of them says be any praise i mean
[1:04:23] those
[1:04:24] you mean that praise is part of thanking
[1:04:26] being thankful
[1:04:27] amen verse 11 not that i speak in
[1:04:31] respect of
[1:04:32] one for i have earned in whatsoever
[1:04:36] state amen
[1:04:39] how many knows it's our state of being
[1:04:42] it's about
[1:04:42] the state that we're in the state that
[1:04:45] we live in
[1:04:46] every single day
[1:04:52] i have learned whatsoever state i am
[1:04:54] whether he's being beat
[1:04:56] whether he's being stoned whether he's
[1:04:58] going down in a ship
[1:05:01] all he thinks whether i'm cold whether
[1:05:04] i'm
[1:05:04] full or whether i'm hungry or whatever
[1:05:07] it is
[1:05:08] i'm still going to be thankful
[1:05:11] i'm still going to be thankful
[1:05:15] whatever state that i am
[1:05:18] there with to be content
[1:05:23] amen we realize that how many knows that
[1:05:26] can only you can only
[1:05:28] say that that when you're going through
[1:05:30] your hardest struggles and hardest
[1:05:32] battles
[1:05:33] your biggest adversity that comes
[1:05:35] against you because we all have
[1:05:36] adversity
[1:05:37] life is full of adversity you have to
[1:05:41] learn to deal with adversity in this
[1:05:42] world or you're
[1:05:44] definitely going to have road rage and
[1:05:46] everything else kind of rage
[1:05:49] you won't make it amen somebody will
[1:05:52] kill you or you'll kill somebody if you
[1:05:54] don't learn to
[1:05:55] learn to live with adversity
[1:05:58] things are not always going to go right
[1:06:00] and paul knew that more he sure didn't
[1:06:02] have everything going right but he
[1:06:04] learned whatever state is
[1:06:05] be content amen
[1:06:09] and i know how to be a based
[1:06:12] and i know how to abound everywhere in
[1:06:16] all things i am instructed both to be
[1:06:19] full
[1:06:20] and to be hungry i know what it's like
[1:06:21] to be on the mountaintop
[1:06:23] i know what it's like to be in the
[1:06:24] valley and i've learned in it all
[1:06:28] so he's thankful content
[1:06:33] amen
[1:06:37] i can do all things through christ
[1:06:41] we could re-read it i can go through
[1:06:43] anything
[1:06:45] with christ
[1:06:48] amen how many wants to be in that place
[1:06:51] lord i can go through anything i can
[1:06:53] live in a place
[1:06:54] and be in a state of peace with god
[1:06:58] and it doesn't matter what comes and i
[1:07:00] truly believe that with paul
[1:07:02] it was all the way to putting his head
[1:07:04] on the block
[1:07:05] folks i'm here to tell you i don't know
[1:07:07] if we'll ever get it i don't
[1:07:09] want to see it but paul when they stuck
[1:07:11] his head up underneath that log
[1:07:14] i'm content let it fall
[1:07:19] whatever state i am in i'm content
[1:07:23] why because he was in heavenly places in
[1:07:25] christ jesus
[1:07:27] he was in the spirit so much that no
[1:07:29] matter what comes or what goes
[1:07:32] amen he was thankful in everything
[1:07:36] give thanks the bible said in james 1 i
[1:07:39] believe it says he says when
[1:07:41] he said counted all joy when you fall
[1:07:43] into diverse
[1:07:48] couches and ice cream parlors and good
[1:07:51] things happen to you no
[1:07:53] temptations and trials and everything
[1:07:56] else
[1:07:57] amen because that's when you really see
[1:08:00] god people
[1:08:01] don't want no adversity everybody wants
[1:08:02] to be a couch potato they don't want to
[1:08:04] work they don't want that they want
[1:08:05] everything easy
[1:08:08] they don't want no friction they don't
[1:08:09] want no body to disagree with them
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:13] didn't even bring the bomb say he says
[1:08:14] what what would be like if nobody ever
[1:08:16] disagreed with us
[1:08:18] we'd be like a rag just you know
[1:08:22] that's what the world wants to be just a
[1:08:23] rag did everything handed to him to god
[1:08:26] at the best
[1:08:27] amen
[1:08:31] amen and yet
[1:08:34] they aren't thankful adversity how many
[1:08:37] knows
[1:08:38] god god puts it in our lives he brings
[1:08:40] adversity
[1:08:42] into our life to see how we will do
[1:08:46] how we will act and whether or not we
[1:08:49] will be content
[1:08:51] in everything
[1:08:55] god did it
[1:08:58] at the red sea isn't that right tomb
[1:09:02] come down there and they all
[1:09:03] boy they were thankful they were
[1:09:06] praising god when they came out of egypt
[1:09:10] all worshipping and praising god but
[1:09:11] when he brought him down there to the
[1:09:13] red sea
[1:09:14] they didn't they weren't so happy with
[1:09:16] their state
[1:09:17] of being anymore they weren't happy
[1:09:21] where they were
[1:09:27] folks and if you're relying on
[1:09:30] everything being
[1:09:31] in a good place for you to be happy then
[1:09:33] you're not always going to be happy
[1:09:36] huh you're going to come home your wife
[1:09:39] has had a bad day and she's going to be
[1:09:41] gripey and complaining and you maybe had
[1:09:44] a bad day you come home and you're all
[1:09:46] griping and complaining and everything
[1:09:48] else because
[1:09:49] things didn't go right today at all
[1:09:51] folks you're gonna have ups and downs
[1:09:53] like you wouldn't believe
[1:09:55] it's gonna be a rollercoaster ride
[1:09:59] because god made it that way he didn't
[1:10:00] make everything go good he made it
[1:10:02] things to go wrong
[1:10:03] huh he does it on purpose
[1:10:12] even the prophet god said he said the
[1:10:14] best thing that god can give us is a
[1:10:16] trial
[1:10:18] huh the thing that comes the best thing
[1:10:21] that can come along our way sometimes is
[1:10:23] for the wind to blow
[1:10:25] on those trees and just boy they're just
[1:10:27] bending over
[1:10:29] they're barely hanging on by the roots
[1:10:30] them roots are popping
[1:10:32] huh but guess what
[1:10:36] it's stretching it and then when it
[1:10:38] comes back up
[1:10:40] those roots will go deeper dig deeper
[1:10:43] and it'll take a bigger win next time
[1:10:46] to move that tree and that's what he
[1:10:48] does with us that's what he did with
[1:10:50] israel
[1:10:50] he wanted to see what they would do in
[1:10:53] the middle of
[1:10:54] adversity if they would be thankful in
[1:10:56] whatever state they are or if they would
[1:10:58] complain
[1:10:59] of the state that they're in
[1:11:05] most of us have to get old before we get
[1:11:08] to this place brother glenn
[1:11:10] before we learn hey don't let everything
[1:11:13] upset you that comes along
[1:11:17] try to let nothing upset you because
[1:11:20] that's exactly what it is
[1:11:22] here you are upright all of a sudden
[1:11:25] you're upset you're upside down you
[1:11:27] aren't what you
[1:11:28] are at all you know you're all out of
[1:11:30] whack who needs to get all out of whack
[1:11:32] and all upset
[1:11:35] huh no but listen so
[1:11:39] he did it there he did it with their how
[1:11:41] about when they got hungry
[1:11:43] right they were so he took them through
[1:11:45] that
[1:11:46] their dead end next thing was hunger
[1:11:49] they got hungry
[1:11:52] now what god was looking for was like
[1:11:55] paul whatever state that they were in
[1:11:57] to say well thank you lord i am not in
[1:12:00] egypt anymore
[1:12:02] i'll tell you what i ate a little better
[1:12:04] there
[1:12:05] because i didn't get hungry there that
[1:12:07] fed me good
[1:12:09] huh here i am hungry but guess what
[1:12:12] they're not taking our children for
[1:12:13] their slaves anymore at their will
[1:12:16] i'm not a slave anymore i don't have to
[1:12:18] do all that every day anymore
[1:12:20] praise be to god i may be alone praise
[1:12:23] god anyway
[1:12:24] that's what god was looking for huh
[1:12:28] but no they quickly became unthankful
[1:12:33] because they were not content with the
[1:12:35] state that they were in
[1:12:38] amen
[1:12:43] praise you know how many knows
[1:12:46] thankfulness is part of worshiping and
[1:12:47] praising god
[1:12:48] thank you thank you thank you lord for
[1:12:50] saving me
[1:12:52] worshiping god and praising him for what
[1:12:54] he for everybody has done
[1:12:56] israel one time when they were preaching
[1:12:58] of the word come forth amen and the
[1:12:59] people got the worshipping god so much
[1:13:02] and until the preacher couldn't even
[1:13:04] talk anymore
[1:13:05] it was too loud out there they were over
[1:13:09] writing the preacher and so they just
[1:13:10] went to worship see god
[1:13:12] inhabits the praise of his people god
[1:13:15] inhabits the praise of his people
[1:13:20] he don't inhabit when there's fussing
[1:13:22] and bickering and fighting and
[1:13:24] grouching and all god just man if you
[1:13:27] want poison assets
[1:13:28] you want to get the holy ghost to get
[1:13:30] out of the church
[1:13:31] just become a complainer just complain
[1:13:34] about one thing and
[1:13:34] poof there he goes
[1:13:38] that's right beyond thankful for one
[1:13:40] thing and poop he's gone
[1:13:41] he does god don't live in that he don't
[1:13:43] live in fusses or fights
[1:13:44] he don't live there he lives in
[1:13:46] contentment
[1:13:48] and brotherly kindness and love
[1:13:51] that's where it inhabits thankfulness
[1:13:54] he comes down there and oh my just what
[1:13:57] a
[1:13:57] what a beautiful thing when everybody is
[1:13:59] thankful to god the way they should do
[1:14:01] and begin the worshiping god god comes
[1:14:04] down
[1:14:05] and part of the reason we don't have as
[1:14:06] much as the holy spirit to come down
[1:14:08] is because we're not as thankful as what
[1:14:10] we should be
[1:14:11] we don't give god the praise that he
[1:14:13] deserves
[1:14:15] amen
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:21] begin to oh my what it does when you're
[1:14:24] a thankful person it brings a song in
[1:14:26] your heart
[1:14:28] it brings a song in your heart it makes
[1:14:31] you appreciate it
[1:14:32] makes you love god more amen
[1:14:38] amen i got a couple more scriptures that
[1:14:40] all right whether believe it or not
[1:14:41] another 15 minutes
[1:14:43] amen let me see here
[1:14:52] this is a scripture i didn't even wrote
[1:14:54] down i just opened it up and read it
[1:14:56] be careful for nothing but in everything
[1:14:59] by prayer and
[1:15:01] supplication with thanksgiving
[1:15:05] let your requests be made known unto god
[1:15:09] didn't even have this this is just
[1:15:11] coming to my scripture
[1:15:13] and listen to this how good it's
[1:15:14] perfectly and
[1:15:16] the peace of god which
[1:15:19] passes all understanding shall keep
[1:15:23] your hearts and minds through jesus
[1:15:26] christ
[1:15:27] if you want to know where that is that's
[1:15:28] the verse just before philippians 8
[1:15:31] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[1:15:32] true and whatsoever things are good
[1:15:34] i didn't even see that there oh we could
[1:15:36] just go all night if you if i'd
[1:15:38] taken more time to find more of those
[1:15:40] scriptures we could go online like that
[1:15:41] but i think that's perfect talking about
[1:15:44] with everything all of your quests
[1:15:45] everything
[1:15:46] amen come with thanksgiving
[1:15:49] amen and then let the peace of god which
[1:15:52] passes
[1:15:52] understanding if you don't know that i
[1:15:55] mean here here and on the
[1:15:57] on the internet listen if you really
[1:16:00] don't know what that piece that passes
[1:16:03] understanding
[1:16:04] is that just completely satisfies you
[1:16:06] because so completely until
[1:16:08] you really don't need anything else but
[1:16:10] god you're just content with them
[1:16:12] is and take some time
[1:16:16] take some time i would say take however
[1:16:18] long whatever time you got to take
[1:16:20] out of your busy schedule until you find
[1:16:23] that peace
[1:16:24] because if you don't find that peace you
[1:16:26] will not find no contentment
[1:16:28] or satisfaction because there's only one
[1:16:31] side one place of contentment
[1:16:32] and that is a place of satisfaction and
[1:16:34] that is in peace
[1:16:36] amen okay
[1:16:46] first timothy 6
[1:16:54] one that i've read many times but i
[1:16:56] think it's good
[1:16:57] to read
[1:17:04] and we'll begin with verse five first
[1:17:06] timothy six
[1:17:07] verse five perverse disputings of men
[1:17:11] of corrupt mind and destitute of the
[1:17:13] truth
[1:17:14] supposing that gain is godliness
[1:17:18] from such withdraw yourself
[1:17:22] but godliness with contentment is
[1:17:26] great gain
[1:17:30] for we brought nothing into this world
[1:17:34] and it is certain that we will carry
[1:17:36] nothing out
[1:17:39] and having food and raiment
[1:17:43] let us be content there with
[1:17:47] now how many knows that doesn't he's not
[1:17:49] talking about salvation
[1:17:50] i'm on salvation i want all of those
[1:17:52] things but he was talking naturally
[1:17:54] speaking here
[1:17:56] food in raiment you should be happy
[1:18:00] you should have a smile on your face
[1:18:02] that's right
[1:18:04] most of us need a big refrigerator how
[1:18:06] many needs a big refrigerator
[1:18:08] you can't get enough stuff in there it's
[1:18:10] too much stuff in there
[1:18:11] my wife orders two gallons of milk one
[1:18:13] of two gallons of low fat and
[1:18:15] another two gallons of one percent you
[1:18:17] know and then we have two
[1:18:19] half gallons of creamer for our and you
[1:18:21] know and you just
[1:18:22] i can't get this in the fridge
[1:18:25] i got plenty of food hello
[1:18:29] well i need her oh boy i hope she don't
[1:18:31] get me for this
[1:18:32] went in her closet the other day and i
[1:18:33] think mine looks about just the same and
