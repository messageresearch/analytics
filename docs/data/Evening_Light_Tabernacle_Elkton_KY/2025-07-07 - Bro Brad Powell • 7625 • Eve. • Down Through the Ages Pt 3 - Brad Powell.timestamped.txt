[43:48] is in the Lord
[43:52] from this time on
[43:56] and ever more.
[43:59] Oh my hope
[44:03] is in the Lord
[44:07] forever more.
[44:11] First verse.
[44:14] I stand in awe within the presence of
[44:19] the Lord.
[44:22] In whom the wisdom of the aes
[44:27] lies.
[44:29] For whom the raging of the seas
[44:34] subsides.
[44:37] The living sacrifice.
[44:41] The only course
[44:43] of life. Oh my hope
[44:48] is in the Lord.
[44:52] This time on
[44:55] forever more.
[44:58] Oh my hope
[45:03] is in the Lord
[45:06] forever more. I I really like this
[45:10] verse.
[45:14] His tender mercies come with a brea
[45:18] rising sun
[45:21] to meet the sinner in his brokenness
[45:29] to offer healing and forgiveveness.
[45:33] [Music]
[45:37] And those who trust in you will find
[45:41] their hearts
[45:43] at rest. Oh yes, my home
[45:48] is the Lord is
[45:52] from this time on
[45:55] and never more.
[45:58] Oh, my hope
[46:03] is in the Lord
[46:07] forever
[46:08] more.
[46:10] Verse two again. Oh,
[46:14] his tender mercies come with every
[46:18] rising sun
[46:21] to meet the sinner in his brokenness.
[46:29] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[46:36] And those who trust in him will find
[46:41] their hearts at rest.
[46:45] My hope
[46:48] is in the Lord.
[46:51] From this time on
[46:55] and ever more,
[46:58] all my hope
[47:02] is in the Lord
[47:06] forever
[47:08] more.
[47:13] Amen. Aren't you thankful tonight that
[47:14] you can put your hope in a forever
[47:16] lasting, a forever more trust in the
[47:19] Lord God Almighty?
[47:21] Amen. Certainly been good to be in the
[47:23] house of the Lord today and trust that
[47:25] you guys had a good dinner and and uh
[47:28] we're just going to we're just going to
[47:30] eat one more time. You got room for a
[47:32] little more.
[47:33] Amen. I hope you're not too tired. We
[47:35] won't try to keep you long. We do want
[47:37] to just try to continue just briefly a
[47:39] little bit of our thought this morning
[47:41] and take a little bit of a different
[47:42] direction. But um we want to uh to to
[47:46] just uh see what the Lord would have in
[47:48] store for us and just try to get
[47:50] settled. But I'm going to try to try to
[47:52] just kind of slow slow down a little bit
[47:54] tonight and and uh just kind of go
[47:56] through some some thoughts and and and
[47:58] kind of teach and try not to get so
[48:01] excited if we can help it. But man, I
[48:02] tell you, the word just excites me. So,
[48:05] as the word comes, we just get excited.
[48:07] So, I want to read you a little quote
[48:09] here and getting started here while
[48:11] you're standing. Brother Ram says, "The
[48:13] heavenly father, as the day is growing
[48:16] dim now, the signs of his appearing is
[48:18] at hand. We see the church, that little
[48:21] handful of elected, called out,
[48:23] predestinated before the beginning of
[48:26] the world. Names are put on the lamb's
[48:29] book of life before there was a
[48:30] foundation of the world. The Holy Spirit
[48:33] has sought through the nations and
[48:35] around the world until it's called this
[48:37] little group. All the father has given
[48:40] me will come to me and all that comes to
[48:43] me, I will give him everlasting life.
[48:45] Raise him up in the last day. He said,
[48:48] 'We see that little group gathering
[48:49] itself together.
[48:51] Amen. Out of every denomination, out of
[48:55] every church, out of every little
[48:56] village, God getting his little group
[48:59] ready, letting the morning star shine
[49:02] upon them as they see the approaching of
[49:06] the Lord Jesus. Listen what he says.
[49:09] seen the ministry come from the just
[49:12] shall live by faith Martin Luther
[49:14] sanctification by John Wesley baptism of
[49:17] the Holy Ghost by the Pentecost and the
[49:19] and by the Pentecostals and the
[49:21] restoration of gifts and now coming into
[49:24] that morning star
[49:26] beginning to reflect
[49:30] who's the reflection.
[49:33] Amen. beginning to reflect and all the
[49:35] church is pulling out of every church,
[49:37] every nation, every people a bride for
[49:41] his name. Listen now, oh God, their
[49:44] hearts are filled with joy. They're
[49:46] happy. They're set. They set in hot
[49:48] buildings. They'll walk in cold weather.
[49:50] They walk through rain, sleet, snow,
[49:52] anywhere. For where the carcass is, the
[49:55] eagles will be gathered. And my sheep
[49:57] know my voice. See, nothing can hold her
[49:59] back.
[50:00] rain, sle, snow, she's here.
[50:05] She's here to feed. She's ready to go.
[50:06] She's wanting to get more and more and
[50:08] more of God.
[50:10] And I'm so glad, Lord, that I'm to be
[50:14] numbered with them. I'm so happy tonight
[50:16] to know that there is a church. You said
[50:18] there would be a church, there would be
[50:19] a church without a spot or a wrinkle.
[50:21] Father, oh God, let our names be on that
[50:24] great book up there that we may appear
[50:27] without spot or wrinkle. Was that your
[50:29] heart's desire tonight? Amen. Praise the
[50:32] Lord. Amen. God's certainly good. I want
[50:35] to take a little thought tonight if we
[50:37] could and we'll continue with our
[50:38] thought on down through the ages. But I
[50:41] want to speak finish up this morning and
[50:43] and then we'll carry it on into another
[50:44] thought. But I want to speak on when the
[50:47] bride is revealed, Satan is exposed.
[50:53] When the bride is revealed, Satan is
[50:56] exposed. and turn with me if you would
[50:58] in into the book of Genesis and we'll
[51:01] read just a portion there and we'll
[51:03] continue continue on our thought of the
[51:05] bride being revealed for just for just a
[51:07] few minutes and I'm going to try to look
[51:09] at the clock. I tell you my eyes today
[51:12] they just failing me.
[51:19] Thank you, brother. 8 o'clock. You heard
[51:22] him.
[51:24] Genesis chapter 24.
[51:26] And he said, 'Oh Lord God of my master
[51:29] Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed
[51:31] this day and show kindness unto my
[51:33] master Abraham. Behold, I stand here by
[51:36] the well of water. Isn't that an amazing
[51:39] thing? I stand by the well of water, and
[51:42] the daughters of the men of the city
[51:44] come out to draw water. And let it come
[51:46] to pass that the damsel to whom I shall
[51:49] say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee,
[51:52] that I may drink, and she shall say,
[51:54] drink, and I will give thy camels drink
[51:57] also. Let the same be she that thou hast
[52:00] appointed for thy servant Isaac, and
[52:03] thereby shall I know that thou hast
[52:05] showed kindness unto my master." Now,
[52:07] watch how Jesus, watch how God works
[52:09] here. And it came to pass before he had
[52:12] been done speaking,
[52:16] You got that?
[52:18] It came to pass before he had done
[52:20] speaking that behold, Rebecca came out,
[52:25] who was born to Bethule, son of Mila,
[52:28] the wife of Naora, Abraham's brother,
[52:29] with her picture upon her shoulder. Did
[52:32] I give you the scripture, Carson?
[52:35] You got it.
[52:36] Struggling with the program.
[52:39] The devil, I tell you what,
[52:42] we're okay, though. We You got your
[52:44] Bibles? And the damsel was fair to look
[52:47] upon, a virgin, neither had any man
[52:48] known her, for she went down to the well
[52:50] and filled her picture and came up. And
[52:54] the servant ran to meet her and said,
[52:56] "Let me, I pray thee, drink a little
[52:58] water of thy picture." And she said,
[53:00] "Drink, my lord." And she hasted and let
[53:03] down her pitcher upon her upon her hand
[53:05] and gave him drink. And when she had
[53:06] done giving him drink, she said, "I will
[53:08] draw water for thy camels also until
[53:12] they have done drinking." and she hasted
[53:14] and emptied her picture into the trough
[53:17] and ran again. It didn't say she she
[53:20] thought about it. She waited. She
[53:21] hesitated. She ran again unto the well
[53:25] to draw water and drew for his camels.
[53:28] Now, we've heard this preached on and
[53:30] talked about, but just to bring it back
[53:31] to your remembrance, we're talking about
[53:33] 10 camels drinking 30 to 50 gallons of
[53:36] water each. So we're talking about she
[53:38] carried in five gallon water pictures on
[53:40] her shoulder 300 to 500 gallons of water
[53:48] and we have a hard time making it
[53:50] sometimes.
[53:54] And watch what happens now. Eleer
[53:56] sitting here. Look at this. He says and
[53:57] it says, "And the man wandering at her
[54:00] held his peace." Now, if I'm sitting
[54:02] there and I'm watching this young young
[54:04] lady, this young damsel, we don't know
[54:06] how old she was, or at least I don't,
[54:08] not not by what I've studied so far. But
[54:10] if I see this young woman who is running
[54:13] to the well to get water and and pouring
[54:15] in, and she's running and she's running
[54:17] and she's back and forth, back and forth
[54:18] with all that she's got within her. I'm
[54:21] going to stand there in wander in
[54:22] amazement as well. And I'm going to say,
[54:25] God, this has to be the one because she
[54:28] is so dedicated. She's so committed. she
[54:30] is doing exactly what I've asked you to
[54:33] show her to do if she's the one to meet
[54:37] Isaac.
[54:38] And so he's standing there and he's
[54:40] wandering at this and he holds her peace
[54:42] to whether the Lord made this journey
[54:44] prosperous or not. And it came to pass
[54:46] as the camels had done drinking that the
[54:48] man took a golden earring of half a
[54:50] shekele weight and two bracelets for her
[54:52] hands of 10 shekels weight of gold.
[54:56] Amen.
[54:58] This is a love letter. We talking about
[55:00] love letters this morning. So here now
[55:02] we have a love letter that was that we
[55:04] seen in Revelation that we've been
[55:07] talking about. And now we see a love
[55:08] letter in the book of Genesis. The
[55:11] prophet tells us in the in the in the uh
[55:13] church age book there's two books that
[55:15] Satan hates.
[55:17] Genesis and Revelation. Why? Because it
[55:21] exposes for exactly who he is.
[55:26] But here is this love letter in the book
[55:28] of Revelation or the book of Genesis
[55:30] rather. And I think about this Eleer as
[55:33] he traveled and and as we get to looking
[55:35] at this, how how how in-depth this gets
[55:38] between what God is wanting to do in his
[55:40] church today and what he did back then
[55:42] and how how the two meet. So let's just
[55:44] go before the Lord in prayer as we get
[55:46] ready to to minister the word tonight.
[55:47] Heavenly Father, we come before you
[55:49] thankful, Lord, for another service and
[55:51] and the opportunity to come and to share
[55:53] your word and what's been placed on our
[55:55] heart, Lord. And we trust that we uh
[55:58] will not weary the people tonight, Lord,
[56:00] but that we'll be able to share the word
[56:02] and they'll be receptive, Lord, as I
[56:04] know it's getting late in the day and
[56:05] and and time is is is definitely never
[56:09] on our sides and weariness creeps in
[56:11] after meals. But Lord, we just ask that
[56:12] you'd give us 45 minutes of of of energy
[56:16] today, Lord. That we could just sit here
[56:17] and receive what you'd have in store for
[56:19] us to to finish off uh the capstone for
[56:22] the day, Lord. And as we speak to our
[56:24] hearts, we just want to tell you we love
[56:25] you. We appreciate you. And thank you
[56:27] for all you do for us in Jesus name.
[56:29] Amen. You can have your seats.
[56:32] Now, talking about this love letter, and
[56:34] I want to share this with you, and and
[56:35] and you've probably heard it, but if you
[56:37] type in love letter in the message, you
[56:39] get one quote that comes up when you put
[56:41] them in conjunction. And brother
[56:43] Brandham's talking about this, and he's
[56:44] talking about, he said, now my wife, I
[56:46] love I love her, how I love her. He
[56:50] says, she'll write me a letter when I'm
[56:52] overseas.
[56:54] He said, and she'll say, Billy, tonight
[56:56] with the babies, I just put them to
[56:57] sleep and and and I this and I and
[57:00] she'll go to talking like that. He said,
[57:02] "Now, uh, he he" He said, "Now, what she
[57:05] wrote on the paper, see, that's what she
[57:08] wrote on the paper. See, but I love her
[57:11] so much that I can read right between
[57:13] the lines of what she really means."
[57:18] So, here is a hidden mystery that the
[57:20] prophet is telling us is being revealed.
[57:22] He says, "Now, that's the way it is with
[57:24] God. It's it's it's not because you know
[57:27] so much, but it's because you love him
[57:31] and he loves you and you sat down and
[57:33] you read his love letter.
[57:37] She wasn't telling him all the gushy,
[57:40] all the icky, all the stuff that we
[57:42] would didn't want to hear, but she's
[57:44] telling him about how the days went and
[57:45] he could read into the love letter. And
[57:48] that's what we have to do with the word
[57:49] of God. We sit down and we read it and
[57:51] we read between the lines and we read
[57:54] the letter. He says if you'll do that,
[57:56] he will just speak to you right between
[57:58] the letters.
[58:01] He says, "And the real context is in the
[58:03] text and the context is revealed by the
[58:07] Holy Ghost."
[58:10] Oh, he says, "That would make a
[58:11] Methodist shout." Think of it, brother.
[58:13] How is that? That's right. He said,
[58:15] "See, it's a love letter, a love affair
[58:18] between you and your maker, and he will
[58:21] reveal it to you." Now, watch this. As
[58:24] you have need of it,
[58:27] you say, "Well, I look over here and I
[58:29] see this person and and they're so far
[58:31] along the road. They're so far down.
[58:33] They've been in this message so long and
[58:34] they know this much and they're they're
[58:36] so far ahead of me." It doesn't matter.
[58:39] He'll reveal it to you as you have need
[58:41] of it. That's not a cause to quit. We
[58:44] see a lot of times people they they they
[58:45] give up. They throw up their hands and
[58:47] they quit and they walk away because I
[58:50] just can't live it. Everybody else lives
[58:52] so far above on me. I just can't live
[58:55] the way they live. Don't throw up your
[58:58] hands and wait and read the love letter
[59:00] and let God reveal it to you as you have
[59:04] need of it.
[59:08] And as seasoned message believers, we
[59:11] have to be patient.
[59:13] We have to be able to look at these that
[59:15] are babes that are cutting their teeth
[59:17] right now and say they can't digest
[59:20] all of this at one time.
[59:23] Could you?
[59:26] No. You couldn't take it all in at one
[59:28] time. It was a process. A little here, a
[59:30] little there, a little here, a little
[59:31] there. But it was that love letter being
[59:34] revealed to you. And when I talk about
[59:36] the word reveal, I want you to notice
[59:38] the difference. When you reveal
[59:40] something, it's a revelation to the
[59:42] audience.
[59:44] So when God reveals his word in Genesis,
[59:47] when God reveals his word in the book of
[59:49] Revelations, it is because he is
[59:51] revealing something to the audience or
[59:53] the reader, it's talking about an unseen
[59:56] character.
[1:00:03] When you reveal something, listen to
[1:00:05] what the definition is. A reveal in a
[1:00:07] story is a plot point where there's a
[1:00:09] secret previously unknown that a fact is
[1:00:12] disclosed. This can be a plot twist, a
[1:00:15] hidden identity, or a long awaited
[1:00:18] answer to a mystery.
[1:00:23] Let me tell you, when I read that, I
[1:00:24] thought, a thought twist,
[1:00:27] that's me. A hidden identity, that's me.
[1:00:32] When I got to thinking a long awaited
[1:00:33] answer to a mystery, that's me. The plot
[1:00:37] twist, the hidden identity. I didn't
[1:00:39] realize who I was. There was a time in
[1:00:42] my life that I lived a life that a lot
[1:00:44] of people didn't like me. There's a lot
[1:00:46] of people don't like me today, but it's
[1:00:47] not for the reasons they didn't like me
[1:00:49] then.
[1:00:52] But they didn't. You wouldn't You
[1:00:54] wouldn't have liked to be around me. I
[1:00:55] was arrogant. I was cocky.
[1:00:59] Come on, church.
[1:01:01] Somebody help me a little bit.
[1:01:04] I was ready to fight.
[1:01:07] I was mean.
[1:01:09] You say, "Well, I didn't ever think you
[1:01:10] was that way." You never got me riled
[1:01:12] up.
[1:01:15] Hallelujah.
[1:01:18] Praise the Lord. Brother Ber got me
[1:01:20] riled up one time. You remember that?
[1:01:23] When when when when when we were hunting
[1:01:25] and y'all shooting 22s over in the
[1:01:27] woods, man, you got me riled up. I
[1:01:29] wasn't a I wasn't a Christian then
[1:01:33] up on that hill.
[1:01:37] Brother Ber and Caleb and and Micah just
[1:01:41] beer and we're in the deer stands.
[1:01:44] What in the world? Hey.
[1:01:48] Oh, forgive me Lord. I don't know where
[1:01:50] that came from, but it's the truth.
[1:01:55] But there was a there was a time when I
[1:01:57] had a hidden identity about me. And I I
[1:02:00] look back and I think I didn't know who
[1:02:02] I really was.
[1:02:05] I was a person that was not a fun to be
[1:02:07] around, who was not pleasant to live to
[1:02:09] live with, who who was who was not on
[1:02:11] the right track. But there was a hidden
[1:02:14] identity on the inside. And there was a
[1:02:15] long awaited answer to a mystery that
[1:02:17] was laying on the inside of me that when
[1:02:19] I heard the word and I seen the word, it
[1:02:22] was able to be revealed to me exactly
[1:02:25] who I was. And it was a revelation that
[1:02:28] I'm a child of God. I'm a seed of God
[1:02:31] before the foundation of the world.
[1:02:33] That's where I came from. And you have
[1:02:35] to have that same revelation.
[1:02:39] Now, let's look here for just a second
[1:02:41] at the word expose.
[1:02:43] That's a revelation. And that's
[1:02:44] revealed. But now exposed, it refers to
[1:02:47] a different kind of concept. It It
[1:02:50] refers to something to make varnable or
[1:02:52] to bring to light something that has
[1:02:54] negative connotation.
[1:02:57] Oh, that sounds like the devil.
[1:03:00] That sounds like the devil. Hey, listen
[1:03:02] to the listen to this definition right
[1:03:03] here. This refers to making something
[1:03:05] public that was previously hidden or
[1:03:08] secret like exposing a scandal.
[1:03:13] Oh, so now we're exposing a scandal.
[1:03:16] Before it was a revelation of who I
[1:03:18] found out who I was on the inside
[1:03:20] because the word of God spoke to my
[1:03:22] heart. But here we look in the Garden of
[1:03:24] Eden and we see a scandal that's being
[1:03:26] exposed.
[1:03:28] This scandal being exposed, surely thou
[1:03:30] shalt not die.
[1:03:34] You see what he did?
[1:03:35] He began to get in there. He began to to
[1:03:37] uh pervert the word. He took God's
[1:03:40] revealed word to them and said was God
[1:03:42] said here you can have everything you
[1:03:44] want in the garden. You can eat of
[1:03:45] everything you want but just don't eat
[1:03:46] of this. That was the revealed truth in
[1:03:49] the hour.
[1:03:51] And Satan comes in and he begins to
[1:03:53] pervert it and he says surely you shall
[1:03:55] not die.
[1:03:59] And what was the first thing they had to
[1:04:00] do after they ptook? She ptook and it
[1:04:03] was good and she gave. What was the
[1:04:05] first thing they did when Jesus when God
[1:04:07] came into the garden and said, "Adam,
[1:04:09] where art thou?"
[1:04:11] They were hiding a scandal.
[1:04:16] You see, Satan don't like to be exposed.
[1:04:20] So, I want to look here for just a
[1:04:21] little bit at Elzer and what happened
[1:04:23] there on that on that wagon train and
[1:04:25] and look into that and then we're going
[1:04:26] to go into exposing the devil just a
[1:04:28] little bit.
[1:04:31] Are you with me?
[1:04:32] Are you awake?
[1:04:34] Are you tired?
[1:04:35] No.
[1:04:38] The nos were louder than the than the
[1:04:40] yays.
[1:04:43] So, here's Eleazar and we look down here
[1:04:45] at Eleazar. Brother Brandham said,
[1:04:47] Eleazar had assurance that the angel was
[1:04:49] going to go before him and therefore he
[1:04:52] could decide to go. So, Eleazar had been
[1:04:54] praying because he didn't want to
[1:04:55] disappoint Abraham. He didn't want to
[1:04:57] disappoint the situation and didn't want
[1:04:59] to come back with the wrong mate for
[1:05:01] Isaac. And so, here he is. He's going
[1:05:03] out here with the assurance that God is
[1:05:05] going to do something for him. And God
[1:05:07] is going to send a word or a message or
[1:05:09] something before him before he gets
[1:05:11] there. So, he's going to take and send
[1:05:13] men with angels, brother Brandham said,
[1:05:16] before him before he gets to take the
[1:05:18] message to the church. He says, not only
[1:05:20] that, but when Eleazar left the father
[1:05:23] Isaac, which represented the father
[1:05:25] Christ, he loaded the whole train of
[1:05:27] camels with good gifts for the bride.
[1:05:31] Hallelujah.
[1:05:31] So listen in this hour brothers and
[1:05:33] sisters. There is a whole train full of
[1:05:36] gifts
[1:05:37] that is here for the bride of Jesus
[1:05:39] Christ. If you have a need in your life,
[1:05:41] the gift is there. Why? Because he
[1:05:43] thought about you.
[1:05:45] He sent before you. The word goes
[1:05:47] before.
[1:05:48] And so here now you got the gift. If you
[1:05:50] need healing, the gift is in the train.
[1:05:53] If you need deliverance, the gift is in
[1:05:55] the train. If you need if you need
[1:05:57] somebody to come and hold your hand and
[1:05:58] get you through a rough day, the gift is
[1:06:00] in the train. It's in the word of Jesus
[1:06:03] Christ.
[1:06:05] He loaded the train with good gifts.
[1:06:07] Good gifts for the bride. He said, "Oh,
[1:06:10] I love Jesus." He loaded the camels full
[1:06:12] of good gifts to give the bride. And he
[1:06:14] never and he never told her that they
[1:06:16] were for another generation.
[1:06:19] That's right.
[1:06:21] Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:22] You say, "Well, I look back here and I
[1:06:23] see this happening this day and this
[1:06:25] happening this day, but what about me?"
[1:06:27] He didn't say it was just for them.
[1:06:29] It is a continuation. It is a building.
[1:06:33] And as God begins to move, he begins to
[1:06:35] continue to build on top of this. So, it
[1:06:37] wasn't just for another generation.
[1:06:39] That's why it says he's the same
[1:06:40] yesterday, today, and forever. If
[1:06:43] listen, I I gave a I gave a a a story
[1:06:46] this morning that I heard, but I'm going
[1:06:47] to tell you the other flip side of it.
[1:06:49] You know, when brother Brandham told
[1:06:50] that woman, bring her child up and the
[1:06:52] child come up and he could see into
[1:06:54] their lives and he said, "You're I can't
[1:06:56] believe you would come ask such a
[1:06:57] request in the condition you're living."
[1:07:00] He also says that if you come under the
[1:07:04] same pretenses and in the and meet the
[1:07:06] same conditions as the person that was
[1:07:09] healed, God is obligated to heal you.
[1:07:13] So if you stand on the same word, Sister
[1:07:15] Becky come up and she said, she said,
[1:07:18] I'm I'm aching. Is this okay, Sister
[1:07:19] Becky? She said, I'm aching. My bones
[1:07:21] are aching, but brother David come up
[1:07:23] and he got his healing.
[1:07:26] I want what he got.
[1:07:29] And so we prayed and I believe she's
[1:07:32] going to get what he got because she can
[1:07:34] meet those same conditions that God I
[1:07:36] know you're able to meet the need.
[1:07:39] And that's what God does in this hour.
[1:07:41] He gives and he gives and he gives.
[1:07:44] It wasn't for another generation or
[1:07:46] another day, but it's for the bride.
[1:07:49] Those same gifts are for you and I.
[1:07:53] Amen.
[1:07:55] Every true servant of God has has that
[1:07:58] sent out and it's got a whole book of
[1:08:00] divine promises that he can offer to the
[1:08:02] bride.
[1:08:07] You know, when they look at that, uh,
[1:08:09] there's a portrait of Eleazar and
[1:08:11] Rebecca at the whale
[1:08:14] and and I didn't pull it up, but because
[1:08:16] there's several of them, but the one
[1:08:17] that really caught my attention is is
[1:08:20] Rebecca sitting there and she's talking
[1:08:22] to Eleazer
[1:08:24] and she's standing there and all around
[1:08:27] her is maybe 20 or 30 other damsels,
[1:08:32] but the attention's on one.
[1:08:36] They had water pots.
[1:08:38] They were dressed nice.
[1:08:41] They let many of them in the picture
[1:08:43] were much fairer to look at than she
[1:08:45] was.
[1:08:47] But Eleazar picked out the one.
[1:08:51] The one that did what the word said to
[1:08:53] do.
[1:08:54] That's the one he began to gift give the
[1:08:57] gifts to. And he's he says he's got
[1:08:59] gifts for her there. And he will not
[1:09:02] hold any of them back. And every one of
[1:09:04] them he gives freely. and to a true
[1:09:06] servant, a model servant that God can
[1:09:08] put trust in. He won't hide it back from
[1:09:10] her because he knows that she is the
[1:09:13] oncoming queen.
[1:09:16] So if you're questioning in your life
[1:09:18] tonight or this week or next week or
[1:09:21] next month whether God cares enough
[1:09:23] about you to give you the gifts, how
[1:09:26] many believes you're the oncoming queen?
[1:09:28] And if you believe you're the oncoming
[1:09:30] queen, the gifts are endless. They're
[1:09:32] numerous. Too numerous to count. You can
[1:09:34] have whatever the word says you're
[1:09:37] obligated to get.
[1:09:41] He said, "Oh, there's there there's
[1:09:43] there is no good thing withheld from
[1:09:45] them that walk upright before him.
[1:09:50] Whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:09:51] pray." Believe that. You say, "I need to
[1:09:54] get rid of this anger." Do you believe
[1:09:57] you can?
[1:09:58] I need to get rid of this temper. Do you
[1:10:00] believe you can? I need to get rid of
[1:10:02] this anxiety. Do you believe you can? I
[1:10:04] need to get healed. I need my body to
[1:10:06] feel better. Do you believe it can?
[1:10:09] I told Jo the other day, I said, "Why is
[1:10:11] it people they they they want to get rid
[1:10:13] of this, they want to get rid of that,
[1:10:14] they want to get rid move this out of
[1:10:16] their life, but yet they hold on to it
[1:10:17] and they give it a name."
[1:10:21] Yeah.
[1:10:24] Somebody uh in conversation the other
[1:10:26] day, I was just listening. You know,
[1:10:28] sometimes you learn a whole lot by
[1:10:29] listening. Yeah.
[1:10:31] And I was just listening and they was
[1:10:32] talking and they was telling a story and
[1:10:34] and I know it's been a problem and they
[1:10:36] were telling a story and they said it
[1:10:38] was my anxiety.
[1:10:43] It was what?
[1:10:46] It was my my anxiety.
[1:10:51] And I think why are you claiming that?
[1:10:54] Why do we hold on to that and say this
[1:10:56] is mine. I don't want that. Anxiety is
[1:11:00] nothing of God's people.
[1:11:03] Anxiety is a fear and a fear is false
[1:11:05] evidence appearing real. It is not real.
[1:11:08] It's not mine. I don't want nothing to
[1:11:09] do with anxiety.
[1:11:12] Let me tell you, I suffered with it as a
[1:11:14] child long enough that I know I don't
[1:11:16] want no part of anxiety.
[1:11:21] So, I'm not going to hold on to it. It's
[1:11:22] a finished work. Yeah.
[1:11:24] When you get prayed for and and you get
[1:11:26] prayed for and you say, "I want
[1:11:27] deliverance." It's a finished work.
[1:11:30] That's the gift in the caravan and the
[1:11:32] camel's pack.
[1:11:36] He came to the well in the evening time
[1:11:38] and he come with and Eleazar had to make
[1:11:40] another decision. He made a decision
[1:11:42] whether he would trust his own opinion
[1:11:44] or the woman or would he trust God's
[1:11:47] opinion of the woman.
[1:11:51] And it was in the evening time when he
[1:11:52] came near the well of the city. And it
[1:11:55] was about the time that Rebecca had to
[1:11:56] make a decision.
[1:12:00] Now, I want you to to think about this.
[1:12:02] Let me get back to these to this
[1:12:03] scripture here if I can find it. I'm I'm
[1:12:06] jumping a little bit. Forgive me.
[1:12:11] It came to pass before he had done
[1:12:13] speaking
[1:12:16] that behold Rebecca came out who was
[1:12:18] born to Bethle. That's not the point.
[1:12:20] But the point is before he had been done
[1:12:22] speaking. So he's asking God send
[1:12:24] somebody this way. Now I want you to
[1:12:26] notice what the prophet said happened.
[1:12:29] You ever wonder how it happened? We got
[1:12:31] it. It's all in the message. It
[1:12:33] everything we have need of every every
[1:12:34] every story is right here in the Bible.
[1:12:38] In the message. He says this. It was at
[1:12:40] the evening time and he came near the
[1:12:42] well near the city and it was about the
[1:12:44] time that Rebecca had to make a
[1:12:46] decision. Rebecca's got to make a
[1:12:48] decision. This guy over here, Eleazar,
[1:12:51] he's praying and before he's done
[1:12:53] speaking, he said, "I believe the angel
[1:12:54] of the Lord beat him there by half an
[1:12:56] hour." He said, "I believe the angel of
[1:12:59] the Lord beat her beat him there by a
[1:13:01] half an hour." And he said, he made the
[1:13:03] way clear. And he spoke to Rebecca's
[1:13:05] heart and said, "Go get water."
[1:13:12] [Music]
[1:13:14] Lord, send somebody.
[1:13:17] The angel comes and says, "Go get
[1:13:18] water."
[1:13:21] Before he's done speaking, I'm gonna eat
[1:13:24] this fly.
[1:13:32] And so here Rebecca now comes into the
[1:13:34] into the water. She's coming there at
[1:13:36] the evening time and she's coming to the
[1:13:38] where the water of life is. He says, "Do
[1:13:41] you get the picture? It's the church in
[1:13:42] these last days. The evening time, the
[1:13:44] lights are here.
[1:13:47] The lights are already here. It's not
[1:13:48] that we're waiting for the evening time
[1:13:50] to come. We're in the evening time.
[1:13:54] Things are happening so fast, we can't
[1:13:56] keep up with them.
[1:14:00] A woman in purple. Yesterday's news.
[1:14:04] A poem from the United States.
[1:14:05] Yesterday's news.
[1:14:07] Peace. Peace. Peace. Yesterday's news.
[1:14:11] Come on, church. We're right here. We're
[1:14:13] witnessing the very thing that he's
[1:14:15] talking about. The evening lights are
[1:14:17] here. And it says she moved into the
[1:14:19] waters of life.
[1:14:23] He said, Eleazar started praying. Oh
[1:14:25] Lord,
[1:14:26] can you imagine seeing all this? And
[1:14:29] Eleazar sitting there and he begins to
[1:14:30] pray. He says, he begins to pray and
[1:14:32] says, "Oh Lord, let something
[1:14:34] supernatural happen." How many loves to
[1:14:37] see the supernatural? When the
[1:14:38] supernatural happens in our midst, it's
[1:14:41] different than when you hear about
[1:14:42] somebody else or some other church or
[1:14:44] some other place. But when you see the
[1:14:46] supernatural moving in our midst
[1:14:49] amongst our neighbors, amongst our
[1:14:52] brothers and our sisters, it does
[1:14:55] something to your faith that gives you
[1:14:56] just a little bit more faith to step and
[1:14:58] climb just a little bit higher on the
[1:15:01] rung of the ladder.
[1:15:06] He said, "But there's something about
[1:15:08] it." He said, "There's something about
[1:15:10] it." He had no more than said it than
[1:15:15] Rebecca came. He said, "God is right on
[1:15:18] the dot.
[1:15:23] He's right there when you need him. He's
[1:15:25] right there in the need of time. Right
[1:15:27] in the nick of time, right exactly when
[1:15:29] you need something to intervene, God
[1:15:31] steps right there on the dot and he
[1:15:33] sends her down there and he takes her
[1:15:35] down there and and and he look look what
[1:15:37] happens. He says, "No more than your
[1:15:39] heart goes to hungering and thirsting
[1:15:41] for God."
[1:15:44] How many's hungering and thirsting?
[1:15:47] So, no more than your heart hungers and
[1:15:49] thirst for God that some kind of Holy
[1:15:51] Ghost revival will break out somewhere
[1:15:54] and something will take place.
[1:15:56] Listen now. He says, "When a neighbor
[1:15:58] gets healed and comes to tell you about
[1:16:00] it, something takes place to let you
[1:16:03] know that the angel of the Lord is
[1:16:05] moving.
[1:16:10] It's something about it.
[1:16:15] I hope this is okay. I think it is.
[1:16:20] You know, we we went for a long time
[1:16:22] here.
[1:16:24] believers believing in the word,
[1:16:26] believing a God in action, believing of
[1:16:28] a God of of healing, a God of power, and
[1:16:31] a God of of restoration, a God of uh
[1:16:33] that sends out the the the the uh the
[1:16:35] the the warriors and the prayer warriors
[1:16:37] that bring back the prodals.
[1:16:40] But it wasn't until we started seeing
[1:16:42] some things in our midst, and I I I've
[1:16:45] shared this, Sister Donna and I had a
[1:16:47] conversation, and she said, you know,
[1:16:49] and and and she's just been an ideal an
[1:16:52] ideal patron.
[1:16:55] of what of how to handle the situation
[1:16:57] she's in. And and it's not discrediting
[1:16:59] anybody else. But it was from the very
[1:17:02] beginning she said, "This is not my war.
[1:17:05] This is God's.
[1:17:07] I'm a child of God and he can heal me."
[1:17:10] And what did the devil do? The devil
[1:17:12] came to her through the wisdom of a
[1:17:14] doctor and said, "You're going to die."
[1:17:16] Yeah.
[1:17:18] Well, we can expose that lie
[1:17:22] because as God begin to move on the
[1:17:23] scene, things begin to take place. Next
[1:17:26] thing you know, things are happening.
[1:17:28] Body's getting better.
[1:17:30] Wounds are healing.
[1:17:32] Lymph nodes are receding.
[1:17:34] You know, I told brother Ber, praise the
[1:17:36] Lord.
[1:17:43] I told brother Ber, he he And he was a
[1:17:46] little hesitant, he said, to talk about
[1:17:48] those lymph nodes. I said, "Listen, we
[1:17:49] we talked about it this morning, and
[1:17:50] this is ain't in my notes." I said,
[1:17:52] "Listen, you heard of a transmission
[1:17:55] system, and when you put transmission
[1:17:57] fluid in a transmission, that fluid runs
[1:17:59] all the way through the entire system,
[1:18:03] from the front to the back, all the way
[1:18:06] through that system."
[1:18:08] And he and I said, "She had four lymph
[1:18:11] nodes taken out." Is that right? Four.
[1:18:13] Zero cancer. Right. your lymphatic
[1:18:16] system,
[1:18:18] the lymph the the the lymph nodes are
[1:18:21] all connected through vessels.
[1:18:24] Are you with me?
[1:18:25] Just like that transmission fluid runs
[1:18:27] through the system, anything that's in
[1:18:29] that lymph node system is going to run
[1:18:31] systematically through the body. God
[1:18:34] moving on the scene on the inside taking
[1:18:37] away what the Satan can't get his hands
[1:18:39] on.
[1:18:43] If it's not in one lymph node, it
[1:18:44] shouldn't be in the rest of them because
[1:18:46] it's a systematic system in the human
[1:18:48] body.
[1:18:50] You say, "Well, maybe this one's got it.
[1:18:53] Maybe it ain't. Maybe God ain't got
[1:18:54] there yet,
[1:18:56] but he's on the dot."
[1:19:02] But I say all that to say this. She
[1:19:05] began,
[1:19:07] "Thomas, shoot that thing.
[1:19:12] to say. I say all that to say this
[1:19:14] though. As she be to talk and she be to
[1:19:17] testify and she be to tell how this is
[1:19:19] God's battle and we begin to see results
[1:19:22] happen. It done something for me.
[1:19:27] It done something to my my ministry. It
[1:19:31] done something to my faith. It done
[1:19:33] something on the inside of me that says,
[1:19:35] "Hey, this is not just for the church
[1:19:37] down the road. This is not just for the
[1:19:40] church in the in the Pentecostal day.
[1:19:43] This is not just for some other time.
[1:19:45] This is for us today. This is for our
[1:19:48] believers. This is for our bride. Our
[1:19:51] bride that is setting in Elkton,
[1:19:53] Kentucky. God is still on the move. And
[1:19:57] it gives us an authority. It gives us a
[1:19:59] little bit more pep in our step to get
[1:20:00] up and say, "God is able."
[1:20:08] actions and results speak loud.
[1:20:15] Brother said, "So why did Rebecca make
[1:20:17] that sudden move? Why did she go to the
[1:20:20] waters of life so quickly?" He said, "It
[1:20:23] was because she was a blood relative to
[1:20:26] Isaac."
[1:20:29] So what is it that makes you move?
[1:20:32] Amen. What is it that gets you on your
[1:20:34] feet? What is it that gives you the
[1:20:35] power, the energy, the spark in your
[1:20:37] life? It's because you are a blood
[1:20:39] relative to Jesus Christ. It was the
[1:20:42] blood shed on Calvary. And it's through
[1:20:44] that blood that we find our power.
[1:20:50] It's through that blood we hunger. It's
[1:20:53] through that blood that we thirst. It's
[1:20:55] through the blood of Christ the vessel
[1:20:57] opens up and allows the Holy Spirit to
[1:21:00] come in. Without that blood, the Holy
[1:21:02] Spirit can't come in. Do you realize
[1:21:04] that? Without that blood in your life to
[1:21:07] cleanse you out and to cover and to
[1:21:09] annihilate the sins and the mistakes,
[1:21:11] how can the Holy Spirit dwell there?
[1:21:14] But because of that blood, the Holy
[1:21:16] Spirit now has a vessel that it can live
[1:21:19] into. What's the Bible tell us? If you
[1:21:22] get yourself cleaned out and you don't
[1:21:23] fill it with something, the Holy Ghost,
[1:21:27] more's coming back your way.
[1:21:30] You got to sweep it and clean it and
[1:21:32] fill it.
[1:21:36] Rebecca, watch what he says. He that
[1:21:40] heareth, let him come to the waters of
[1:21:42] life freely.
[1:21:45] He said, "The bride said,"
[1:21:49] How many?
[1:21:50] The bride said, "Come."
[1:21:55] You mean Ezer goes to go find a bride
[1:21:59] for Isaac? And he's wanting in his mind
[1:22:01] and in his heart, he's wanting to say,
[1:22:03] "Come, come, come, come with me." But
[1:22:05] that's not what he said. The bride said,
[1:22:07] "Come, let me give you water that you
[1:22:10] want. Come, let me give you the water
[1:22:12] that your camels need. Come." So,
[1:22:14] brothers and sisters, it's the bride of
[1:22:16] Jesus Christ in the hour we're living in
[1:22:18] that is saying, "Come, Lord. Come, Lord.
[1:22:21] Come, Lord. Call me away, Lord.
[1:22:30] Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:33] He said, "Watch a real quick qu a real
[1:22:35] Christian in a meeting.
[1:22:37] Watch quickly how they're ordained to
[1:22:39] eternal life." He said, "They'll know
[1:22:42] it. There's something in that message
[1:22:44] that stirs them."
[1:22:46] Oh, it's nothing like getting up here
[1:22:48] and preaching. And then you begin to
[1:22:50] break the word and you begin to to share
[1:22:51] the bread and you begin to to lay it out
[1:22:53] there. And then all of a sudden you see
[1:22:55] somebody who's grasping a hold of what
[1:22:57] you're saying
[1:22:59] and you know they're going through
[1:23:01] something. You know they've been in
[1:23:02] places they shouldn't have been. You
[1:23:03] know they've been doing things they
[1:23:05] shouldn't do. But as the word goes
[1:23:06] forth, something on the inside begins to
[1:23:09] grab them and it begins to pull them.
[1:23:11] And you can see their countenance
[1:23:12] change. What is that? It's God stirring
[1:23:15] on the inside. Amen.
[1:23:22] The angel of the Lord was leading her
[1:23:25] and she was stirred and immediately she
[1:23:27] started watering the camels
[1:23:29] and the gifts went on her.
[1:23:34] Pour it out. Pour it out, bride.
[1:23:38] Pour it out and watch the gifts come
[1:23:40] upon you.
[1:23:41] He said she began to water the camels.
[1:23:43] The gifts went on her. He began to take
[1:23:45] out the earrings.
[1:23:48] Oh, you know what that meant? He said he
[1:23:50] took out the earrings and he gave her
[1:23:51] the earrings to signify to signify that
[1:23:55] uh it means your faith cometh by
[1:23:57] hearing.
[1:24:00] You see, we always read that story and
[1:24:01] just thought, man, look at how much
[1:24:03] gold, look at how much weight of gold,
[1:24:04] look at how much he cares, how much the
[1:24:06] value is. But there's symbolic meanings
[1:24:08] behind what he done. He said he gave her
[1:24:10] the earrings to tell her that faith
[1:24:12] cometh by hearing. He put the bracelets
[1:24:14] on her that says the works of your
[1:24:16] hands.
[1:24:21] She poured out the water.
[1:24:23] The works of her hands called out to a
[1:24:28] husband.
[1:24:31] He got her ready as soon as she began to
[1:24:33] begin to water. He give the water. She
[1:24:36] give the waters of life to testify to
[1:24:38] tell others to get the message out. Tell
[1:24:40] them what has happened to you.
[1:24:44] You want to see God move? Tell everybody
[1:24:47] what he's doing.
[1:24:49] If he's done something in your life,
[1:24:50] share what he's doing in your life.
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:25:00] This message had stirred Rebecca.
[1:25:03] Why?
[1:25:05] How could she be so stirred? A stranger
[1:25:08] comes up to her.
[1:25:11] What could stir her? What could stir
[1:25:13] her? What could send her to a point that
[1:25:15] she was so excited and so stirred?
[1:25:18] And the prophet said, because she was
[1:25:20] satisfied that the message was from God.
[1:25:28] Brothers and sisters, I don't have to
[1:25:30] question
[1:25:32] anything this book says.
[1:25:35] I don't have to go to a bishop.
[1:25:38] I don't have to go to a hierarchy. I
[1:25:41] don't have to go to to an association.
[1:25:46] If I've got a question, I may go to my
[1:25:48] pastor because I want to know what he
[1:25:50] thinks.
[1:25:52] But the truth is, the word
[1:25:55] never lies.
[1:25:56] The word never misleads.
[1:25:59] And so right here, she knew when the
[1:26:02] word came to her through the word of an
[1:26:04] angel and says, "Go water."
[1:26:07] She had no mistake in the message that
[1:26:09] it was from God.
[1:26:11] Brothers and sisters, I don't have no
[1:26:12] question in my mind where this message
[1:26:15] came from.
[1:26:17] When I saw it, I knew it.
[1:26:19] That's right.
[1:26:23] Was I made fun of? Yep.
[1:26:26] Yep. Sure was. I tried to witness as a
[1:26:30] 17, 16, 17 year old to one of my best
[1:26:32] friends. He said, "Man, y'all need to
[1:26:33] quit killing chickens and handling
[1:26:35] snakes out there."
[1:26:41] Huh?
[1:26:43] So, was was I ridiculed? Yeah.
[1:26:48] Yeah. Have you ever been ridiculed?
[1:26:51] Yeah. But did it change the way I
[1:26:53] thought about the message?
[1:26:55] No.
[1:26:57] Isn't that an amazing thing that once
[1:26:59] you know that you know that you know it
[1:27:01] begins to build this excitement in her
[1:27:04] and just like her she was so excited.
[1:27:07] But what did what did her people around
[1:27:08] her say?
[1:27:10] Won't you just stay around here for just
[1:27:12] a little while? Make sure
[1:27:16] don't go too deep.
[1:27:19] You'll find yourself in a cult.
[1:27:22] Don't go too deep. Stick around here.
[1:27:24] See what happens. But that's not what
[1:27:26] she said. No, no, I'm excited. I'm going
[1:27:29] to go. I'm going to go and I'm going to
[1:27:30] go find my husband. She said, I'm going
[1:27:32] to go and I'm going to marry this man.
[1:27:34] I'm not going to stick around here for
[1:27:36] no time. No time being. God has already
[1:27:39] told me. Go water. He sent him. Now I'm
[1:27:42] going to get him.
[1:27:45] I'm going.
[1:27:48] So what did she do? She lingered around.
[1:27:50] No, she says she put on her garments.
[1:27:53] She got herself ready. She got on her
[1:27:55] garments and she began to go because
[1:27:57] why? She had gotten all the gifts.
[1:28:00] The word had come to her. She's got her
[1:28:02] garments on and he says, "Go. Let's go
[1:28:05] find them."
[1:28:10] And he says it was about the evening
[1:28:12] time.
[1:28:14] Don't you love that evening time
[1:28:16] message?
[1:28:18] It was about the evening time. He said
[1:28:20] when Isaac went out there and he get he
[1:28:21] stepped out of his tent and he was just
[1:28:23] going to wander out there out of his
[1:28:24] tent to go meditate for a while.
[1:28:30] And here's Isaac out there meditating.
[1:28:33] Lord, you're so good to me.
[1:28:37] Lord, you you you bless me beyond
[1:28:39] measure. Lord, uh the the fields are
[1:28:42] full because of you. Lord, our
[1:28:45] everything is good, but Lord, I could
[1:28:46] sure use a wife.
[1:28:51] You ought to desire a wife. They're
[1:28:54] pretty good to have around.
[1:28:59] And all of a sudden,
[1:29:02] he says, "There come those camels
[1:29:04] coming."
[1:29:06] Can you imagine the dust out there as
[1:29:08] the the dust in that dry barren land?
[1:29:10] dust comes and it's boiling up out from
[1:29:12] under the feet of the camels. And he
[1:29:13] says when they look out there, she
[1:29:15] looked out there, Rebecca looked at him
[1:29:17] and it was love at first sight.
[1:29:20] It was something that she'd been longing
[1:29:22] for, something that God had showed her,
[1:29:24] go water.
[1:29:26] What has that got to do with it? Because
[1:29:29] water is from the word.
[1:29:32] And as the word goes forth, go water.
[1:29:34] And God has now been trying to give her.
[1:29:36] He's trying to bless her. He's trying to
[1:29:38] give her what she's looking for. He
[1:29:39] said, "It didn't make no difference what
[1:29:41] that man looked like."
[1:29:45] Listen to this. I don't care whether
[1:29:47] he's big or little, what color he is,
[1:29:49] that makes me no difference. She looked
[1:29:52] at him and she said, "He's my Lord."
[1:29:57] We're in the evening time.
[1:30:00] You know, we all got pictures of what
[1:30:02] Jesus is going to look like.
[1:30:05] You know, Brother Brandham said that
[1:30:06] picture of Hoffman's head of Christ was
[1:30:08] the closest thing that we could ever
[1:30:10] that's ever been portrayed.
[1:30:14] But what will it be like when our eyes
[1:30:18] cast on him for the first time?
[1:30:21] What will it be like? What is it going
[1:30:24] to be like? I you know the song I can
[1:30:25] only imagine. What will it be like? Will
[1:30:27] I Will I cry? Will I Will I dance? Will
[1:30:29] I shout? Will I scream? What will I do
[1:30:31] when I'm eyes lock eyes with the one who
[1:30:34] loved me enough to die for me?
[1:30:43] You know, when we go before God, we go
[1:30:44] as an open book.
[1:30:47] And I like what he says. He talks about
[1:30:49] Rebecca here. He says, "She lighted off
[1:30:51] that camel and she pulled the veil off
[1:30:54] her face."
[1:30:57] You can't hide from God.
[1:31:00] And Rebecca pulls the veil off her face,
[1:31:03] revealing the love that she would carry
[1:31:05] for Isaac,
[1:31:08] someone she'd never laid eyes on, but
[1:31:10] God had promised.
[1:31:13] God's so good to us.
[1:31:16] Listen, he says, "There's no time to
[1:31:18] linger. It's time to make a decision."
[1:31:21] What kind of effect has the message made
[1:31:23] on you? Are you ready to say, "I will
[1:31:26] go. I will arise and go with Jesus. I
[1:31:29] will embrace him in his arms
[1:31:33] in the arms of my savior.
[1:31:38] How many would say that this morning or
[1:31:40] this evening?
[1:31:42] So God has revealed his love through the
[1:31:44] bride in the book of Genesis chapter 24
[1:31:48] with Rebecca and Isaac. He's revealed
[1:31:51] what he's going to do in this last hour
[1:31:53] in the book of Revelations. But now
[1:31:55] let's look and see what the prophet says
[1:31:56] about the book of revelations and what
[1:31:58] Satan's plan is. He said the book of
[1:32:01] revelations and the re is the revelation
[1:32:03] of Jesus. What he's doing in the
[1:32:05] churches for those seven ages. He says
[1:32:10] you're now look. He says, let me get to
[1:32:13] my spot. There is a you're going to know
[1:32:14] there's times and there's seasons. Those
[1:32:17] men were still thinking Jesus had an
[1:32:19] earthly kingdom. But it wasn't a but it
[1:32:22] was a spiritual kingdom that he was
[1:32:24] going to build even though he could not
[1:32:25] tell them about it in this place that he
[1:32:28] was in because the father had not yet
[1:32:30] revealed it to him.
[1:32:32] So you mean Jesus is sitting there the
[1:32:34] people are asking him what kind of
[1:32:36] kingdom is this going to be? I can't
[1:32:37] tell you because it hadn't been revealed
[1:32:39] to me. But the prophet says, he goes on
[1:32:42] and says, "But after his death and his
[1:32:43] resurrection and this particular time in
[1:32:47] his ministry, he's able to set forth
[1:32:49] here in the revelation of himself to
[1:32:52] John what the glory and the presence in
[1:32:54] the church would mean and do."
[1:33:00] Jesus couldn't even have told us what
[1:33:02] was going to happen when he was here on
[1:33:04] earth.
[1:33:06] Do you see how important and how how how
[1:33:08] how this this this ch this this church
[1:33:10] age messenger messengers that were sent
[1:33:14] through the revelation of the message of
[1:33:16] the hour and the message that was given
[1:33:17] to John on the aisle of Patmas because
[1:33:20] after Jesus's death and resurrection
[1:33:22] then God revealed to him says this is
[1:33:24] what I'm going to do
[1:33:29] that's right
[1:33:30] now share it share it with the people.
[1:33:35] He said, "And in this revelation,"
[1:33:36] here's what I like. He tells us what the
[1:33:39] end of the devil is.
[1:33:42] He's coming to an end.
[1:33:44] His reign is shortly coming to a halt.
[1:33:48] Soon and brief a and and swiftly coming
[1:33:50] to a halt. He tells us what the end of
[1:33:53] the devil is. He tells us how he's going
[1:33:55] to deal with the devil. He tells us how
[1:33:57] he's going to cast him into the lake of
[1:33:59] fire. and he reveals the end of the
[1:34:01] wicked ones who follow Satan. And Satan
[1:34:04] hates it.
[1:34:07] You want to make him mad, just tell him
[1:34:09] where he's going.
[1:34:13] He hates it. You want to You want to
[1:34:15] upset the You want to upset the devil,
[1:34:17] just tell him how much God loves you and
[1:34:19] how much he hates him.
[1:34:22] Just expose him for what he is. You want
[1:34:23] to make the devil mad, tell him he's a
[1:34:25] liar. Yeah.
[1:34:27] When he tells you you can't be healed,
[1:34:28] tell him you're a liar.
[1:34:30] Because the word says, "By my stripes,
[1:34:33] by his stripes, I've been made healed."
[1:34:38] You see, sometimes we got to expose the
[1:34:40] devil
[1:34:41] for who he is. And he says, notice how
[1:34:44] he hates two books in the Bible, the
[1:34:47] book of Genesis, the book of
[1:34:48] Revelations. Why? Because both of these
[1:34:51] books attack Satan's origin.
[1:34:55] And it tells of his awful ways and the
[1:34:57] destruction. That's why he attacks them.
[1:35:00] He hates to be exposed.
[1:35:04] And in those books, he's exposed for
[1:35:07] exactly who he is.
[1:35:11] He's a deceiver. He's a perverter. He's
[1:35:14] a liar. He's a counterfeit. Are you with
[1:35:17] me?
[1:35:18] Amen.
[1:35:19] He's a false witness.
[1:35:25] He hates to be exposed.
[1:35:28] Jesus said that about Satan. He has no
[1:35:30] part in me and I have no part in him.
[1:35:33] The devil would love to prove that
[1:35:35] different but he cannot. So what he does
[1:35:38] is all he can do to destroy the
[1:35:40] confidence in the word.
[1:35:45] Huh?
[1:35:47] That's where it all started.
[1:35:51] He took the confidence that Adam and Eve
[1:35:54] had in the word. They had no reason to
[1:35:57] disbelieve, no reason to to mis uh
[1:36:00] misinterpret because God said, "This is
[1:36:02] what you can have. This is what you
[1:36:04] can't have." Black and white, plain.
[1:36:07] And he comes in there and he begins to
[1:36:08] shake the confidence that they would
[1:36:11] have in the very word of God. That's
[1:36:14] right.
[1:36:15] in a garden of Eden where they had the
[1:36:17] right to pluck up trees, create rivers,
[1:36:20] move this, move that.
[1:36:24] And Satan could break the confidence of
[1:36:28] a man of Adam and Eve against the very
[1:36:30] word of God. He's listen now. He's not
[1:36:33] he he's not one to just play around
[1:36:35] with.
[1:36:36] You better know where you stand. When
[1:36:39] you go before God, when you go before
[1:36:40] spirits, when you go before these things
[1:36:42] and you're praying or whatever, and
[1:36:43] there's a spirit, you better know where
[1:36:45] you stand.
[1:36:50] We could we could tell you stories.
[1:36:53] Brother Ber can tell you stories of
[1:36:55] spirits that you have to battle.
[1:36:58] We we can tell you stories of prayer
[1:37:00] lines that I've been in and I've seen
[1:37:03] people that the spirits that they have
[1:37:05] to you have to battle in those people.
[1:37:07] you better know where you stand because
[1:37:08] why? They've been so confused. They've
[1:37:10] been so contorted and they've had their
[1:37:12] confidence has been broken to where they
[1:37:14] believe and accept what Satan says more
[1:37:18] than what the word of God says.
[1:37:25] He said, "Let me put in a word here from
[1:37:27] my own ministry if you don't mind.
[1:37:30] You say you you you you out there, you
[1:37:33] in a different place." Let me tell you
[1:37:34] what he says. Let me put a word in here
[1:37:36] from my own ministry if you don't mind.
[1:37:38] You all know that the gift in my in my
[1:37:41] life is supernatural. It is a gift
[1:37:43] whereby the Holy Spirit is able to
[1:37:45] discern diseases, the thoughts of men's
[1:37:48] hearts, and other things that only God
[1:37:50] could know, then reveal it to me. Listen
[1:37:53] now. I wish you could stand with me and
[1:37:56] see the faces of people
[1:37:59] when Satan knows he's going to be
[1:38:02] exposed.
[1:38:06] Oh,
[1:38:08] so you wasn't making that up. No, no,
[1:38:10] no. Just like you can look at in a
[1:38:13] congregation and you can see when God is
[1:38:15] moving in somebody's life and God is
[1:38:17] revealing himself to in a person's life
[1:38:20] and you can see the joy and the
[1:38:21] happiness and the peace and the love
[1:38:24] come across somebody who was once
[1:38:26] sitting there like a bump on a log.
[1:38:29] You can also look out there and you can
[1:38:31] begin to see Satan as he's getting ready
[1:38:33] to get exposed.
[1:38:35] You can see the color of their skin
[1:38:37] change.
[1:38:39] Oh, they get mad. You can't hide it.
[1:38:43] You get a temper, you get red.
[1:38:46] You don't like something said, you begin
[1:38:48] to frown, snarl. Ah.
[1:38:52] And you begin to look out there and you
[1:38:53] can see the countenance begin to change.
[1:38:56] That's right. That's right. Next thing
[1:38:58] you know, they got to move. And I don't
[1:39:00] mean when the Lord gets ready. No, they
[1:39:03] getting ready to get exposed. They
[1:39:06] getting out the back door.
[1:39:09] Amen.
[1:39:15] You know, sometimes
[1:39:17] we rush
[1:39:19] sometimes we rush God.
[1:39:22] This ain't in my notes, but sometimes we
[1:39:25] rush God into into a place that we don't
[1:39:27] even allow him to have time to move in
[1:39:30] people's lives.
[1:39:32] You know, the people we get here and we
[1:39:34] begin to preach and the word goes forth
[1:39:36] and the preaching goes forth and the
[1:39:37] preacher says, "All right, let's stand."
[1:39:40] That don't mean put your pocketbook on
[1:39:42] your shoulder.
[1:39:48] That don't mean put your kids shoes on.
[1:39:51] Fold up blankets.
[1:39:55] Boy, you say a lot when you set up here,
[1:39:56] don't you, brother Balor?
[1:40:05] It's not a time to get ready to dismiss
[1:40:07] and see how fast we can get out the back
[1:40:09] doors.
[1:40:11] Sometimes, Brother Steve has to open the
[1:40:13] doors just so people don't knock him
[1:40:14] down leaving.
[1:40:16] Well, he he ought to he they he ought to
[1:40:18] be standing in front of the doors and
[1:40:19] say, "Stay, wait right here. Let's see
[1:40:21] what's fixing to happen.
[1:40:22] Amen.
[1:40:24] God is on the move.
[1:40:28] And after the word goes forth, then we
[1:40:30] begin to praise. Then we begin to
[1:40:32] worship. Then we can really enter into a
[1:40:35] place. Why? Because we've been all
[1:40:36] scoured out.
[1:40:41] But we rush God.
[1:40:47] So, brother Steve, you can feel free to
[1:40:49] lock them doors anytime you want.
[1:40:54] Let's be patient. Let's see what God is
[1:40:55] going to do. Let's see how he moves in
[1:40:57] the congregation. See how he moves in
[1:40:59] the midst. He says, "And remember this,
[1:41:03] Satan knows assuredly that the church of
[1:41:05] the at Pentecost that with the power of
[1:41:09] God of Mark 16 in action is the true
[1:41:12] church that Jesus claims as his own."
[1:41:15] And he knows that all else is false. It
[1:41:19] has to be. What is this Mark 16? Church,
[1:41:22] let me tell you. Go into all the world
[1:41:25] and preach the gospel to every creature.
[1:41:26] He that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:41:28] be saved. He that believeth not shall be
[1:41:30] damned. These signs,
[1:41:34] these signs shall follow them that
[1:41:36] believe, and in my name they shall cast
[1:41:38] out devils.
[1:41:45] They shall speak with new tongues.
[1:41:49] They shall take up serpents and drink
[1:41:50] any deadly thing and it shall not hurt
[1:41:52] hurt them. They shall lay hands on the
[1:41:54] sick and they shall recover.
[1:41:59] It didn't say they might.
[1:42:01] It's a finished work.
[1:42:04] When that blood shed on Calvary, what
[1:42:06] did he say? It's finished.
[1:42:09] Don't hold on to it. Don't name it.
[1:42:10] Don't pet it. A
[1:42:18] fear,
[1:42:20] lust,
[1:42:24] hatred,
[1:42:27] addiction,
[1:42:31] filthy videos.
[1:42:33] Come on, church.
[1:42:35] You know, I I I've always I I've been
[1:42:37] guilty of always trying to see the best
[1:42:39] in everybody. And I I try not to see
[1:42:41] faults. And sometimes I don't even
[1:42:42] believe people's got any. I know you
[1:42:45] don't think that when I preach,
[1:42:48] but the truth of the matter is I'm going
[1:42:50] to tell a little story on Brother Glenn.
[1:42:52] I had never told you this, Brother
[1:42:53] Glenn, but I'm going to tell you tell
[1:42:55] tell the whole church.
[1:42:58] Brother Glenn, when he first come around
[1:42:59] and he was living before me such a life,
[1:43:02] I thought, man, this guy's got it. He is
[1:43:04] he's 100%. There ain't nothing in his
[1:43:06] life.
[1:43:10] And we were standing outside one day and
[1:43:12] he's testified this so I'm not telling
[1:43:14] you nothing he hadn't told you. And
[1:43:16] we're standing outside one day and he
[1:43:17] said, "Brother Ber, I've had a good
[1:43:20] week. God's been moving. I ain't even
[1:43:23] been to the casino."
[1:43:25] I just died laughing cuz I thought he
[1:43:28] was making a joke.
[1:43:30] He wasn't making a joke. He was telling
[1:43:32] us that he had been delivered
[1:43:35] from something in his life.
[1:43:38] God had moved in his life and he was
[1:43:41] confessing. And when I realized, I have
[1:43:43] no reason to lie. This guy really did
[1:43:45] have a problem. He really had an
[1:43:47] addiction, but it's not his anymore.
[1:43:49] He's been delivered. He don't go there.
[1:43:51] He don't live there. He don't waste
[1:43:52] money there.
[1:43:56] Why did I take it so light? Cuz I've
[1:43:57] never had that problem.
[1:44:00] They wasn't getting my money. I learned
[1:44:02] my lesson.
[1:44:04] I learned my lesson at the county fair.
[1:44:10] Brother Glenn, we I worked hard, man. We
[1:44:12] worked hard like dogs. We sweating this
[1:44:15] summer. 100 hades outside, you know.
[1:44:19] And and my father-in-law gave me that
[1:44:21] check. It was about $320 if I remember.
[1:44:24] Thought, man, this is good. I got some
[1:44:27] money. We went to the county fair.
[1:44:37] Man, do I get myself in some pickles and
[1:44:40] I was going to win that VCR.
[1:44:43] Now, some of you young people don't know
[1:44:44] what a VCR is,
[1:44:47] but it's a is got a cassette you stick
[1:44:50] in it and you watch movies,
[1:44:53] looking at me like a cow staring at
[1:44:56] another gate.
[1:44:59] But I was going to win that VCR.
[1:45:02] I was a baseball player. I could knock
[1:45:04] them jugs over. He gave me a ball. I
[1:45:07] threw it. I don't know. He had lead
[1:45:09] powled in them things. They was
[1:45:12] unshakable. They're unmovable. I said,
[1:45:14] "He ain't getting the best of me. Here's
[1:45:15] 10 more dollars. Here's 10 more. Here's
[1:45:18] 10. Give me three more balls. Here's 20
[1:45:19] more. Give me Give me Give me more. I'm
[1:45:21] I'm not leaving here till I get that
[1:45:23] VCR."
[1:45:28] $320 and broke later.
[1:45:38] Brother Steve, I want you to get up here
[1:45:39] and tell some stories sometime
[1:45:42] cuz he sure likes mine.
[1:45:45] Broke as a joke because I had given into
[1:45:48] the temptation knowing better and should
[1:45:52] not have been there. should not even
[1:45:54] been down that road.
[1:46:01] Remember this, Christ in the true church
[1:46:03] is a continuation
[1:46:06] of the book of Acts.
[1:46:08] But the book of Revelation shows how
[1:46:10] that the antichrist spirit would come
[1:46:12] into the church and defile it, making it
[1:46:15] lukewarm, formal, and powerless.
[1:46:21] You know, that's just how Satan is. He
[1:46:23] comes in and we see the move going on
[1:46:26] around and and then he comes in and he
[1:46:28] wants to say, "Well, you know, that was
[1:46:29] just a that was just a feeling. That was
[1:46:32] just an emotion.
[1:46:35] Did they really get something? They
[1:46:37] didn't come back the next service."
[1:46:39] And then you begin to doubt and you
[1:46:41] begin to question. And he begins to come
[1:46:43] in and he begins to say, "Well, maybe
[1:46:45] maybe it was for them in a different
[1:46:47] time. Maybe when Matthew, Mark, and Luke
[1:46:49] was on the scene. Maybe that's when
[1:46:51] Jesus would all of his works, and now
[1:46:54] you're just following a history of the
[1:46:56] church.
[1:46:58] You know, there's people that just
[1:47:00] follow the history of the church.
[1:47:03] They study the history of the church. I
[1:47:05] don't need a God of history.
[1:47:09] Come on, church. I need a God who is
[1:47:11] right there when I say, "I need you,
[1:47:14] Lord." And he says, "Go get water.
[1:47:22] This book exposes Satan. It reveals his
[1:47:24] work. It attempt the attempted
[1:47:26] destruction of God's people and
[1:47:28] discrediting of God's word right down to
[1:47:30] the time he's cast into the lake of
[1:47:31] fire. And he fights that. See, he's not
[1:47:35] going down easy.
[1:47:37] No, he's got fiery darts. Did you know
[1:47:39] that? Fiery dart here, a dart there. He
[1:47:42] shoots this, this, this, this, this.
[1:47:43] He'll get into your home. He'll get into
[1:47:45] your house. He'll get between the
[1:47:46] between your between the the mom and the
[1:47:48] kids and he'll get between the wife and
[1:47:50] the husband.
[1:47:52] And he begins to throw these darts to to
[1:47:54] disarray and to shake up the house that
[1:47:56] you're living in.
[1:47:59] And next thing you know, I ain't going
[1:48:01] to church.
[1:48:05] You done made me mad. You go ahead. I'll
[1:48:08] stay here.
[1:48:14] I've said it, Brother Joe.
[1:48:24] But what is that? It's Satan getting in
[1:48:26] and disrupting.
[1:48:28] He's disrupting the flow. He wants to
[1:48:30] get in there and he wants to discredit
[1:48:32] God's word and tell you that you don't
[1:48:34] even need to be there cuz it don't
[1:48:36] matter. Look at the way your wife acts.
[1:48:37] Look at the way your kids act. Look at
[1:48:38] the way your boss treats you. That has
[1:48:41] not one thing to do with it.
[1:48:48] Not one thing.
[1:48:50] You say, "Well, if my husband did this
[1:48:52] and my husband did that, don't matter.
[1:48:56] It's between you and God. It's between
[1:49:00] your relationship and God." And he tries
[1:49:03] to get in and discredit that. He says he
[1:49:05] can't stand it. He fights it. He knows.
[1:49:09] Now listen here. We're going to close
[1:49:10] with this. He knows that if the people
[1:49:13] get the true revelation.
[1:49:15] Here's one of those quotes, Brother Ber
[1:49:17] said, Mark in your book. He knows if you
[1:49:20] people get the true revelation of the
[1:49:22] true church and what she is, what she
[1:49:26] stands for, and that she can do the
[1:49:29] greater works, she will be an invincible
[1:49:33] army.
[1:49:35] There'll be no stopping her. He can't
[1:49:38] disrupt her. Why? because she stands on
[1:49:40] the word and the word alone. It doesn't
[1:49:42] matter what this person thinks or that
[1:49:44] person thinks or what this church does
[1:49:46] or that church does. It matters between
[1:49:48] what happens between you and God. And
[1:49:51] when we realize that, the greater works
[1:49:54] begin to flow through us. Amen.
[1:49:57] She will be an invincible army if they
[1:49:59] get a true revelation of the two spirits
[1:50:01] within the framework of the Christian
[1:50:03] church and by God's spirit discern and
[1:50:07] withstand the antichrist spirit.
[1:50:11] Satan will be
[1:50:14] powerless.
[1:50:18] Say this. Satan
[1:50:21] you're powerless.
[1:50:24] Satan
[1:50:25] You're powerless.
[1:50:27] I
[1:50:29] am an invincible
[1:50:32] army.
[1:50:33] Satan, you're powerless because the word
[1:50:35] says I know who I am and I'm an
[1:50:37] invincible army tonight.
[1:50:40] Amen. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:50:46] Satan will be powerless before her. He
[1:50:48] will be as definitely thwarted today as
[1:50:51] when Christ withstood his every effort
[1:50:55] to gain power over him in the desert.
[1:50:59] What did he do?
[1:51:01] It is written. He come at him with this.
[1:51:04] Oh, aren't you hungry?
[1:51:09] The truth was he probably was hungry 40
[1:51:11] days.
[1:51:13] That's right.
[1:51:14] He was probably wanting something to
[1:51:16] eat. But the fact of the matter is he
[1:51:18] said, "No, it's written, I shall not
[1:51:21] live by bread alone."
[1:51:24] Well, what if I give you all the
[1:51:25] kingdoms set before you? Everything you
[1:51:28] see from the pinnacle of this mountain,
[1:51:30] everywhere you see, all 360 degrees can
[1:51:34] be yours.
[1:51:36] It's written.
[1:51:39] Why could he say that? Because he knew.
[1:51:42] He knew all the kingdoms would be his
[1:51:44] anyway.
[1:51:48] What if you fall off this pit, off this
[1:51:50] cliff? Won't the angels come get you?
[1:51:52] Why don't you just jump off and let's
[1:51:53] let's see if they really come and they
[1:51:55] stand on their word. No, it's written, I
[1:51:57] shall not tempt. He could have said,
[1:51:59] it's written they'll protect me.
[1:52:02] But he said, "It's written, I shall not
[1:52:04] tempt."
[1:52:06] You love the Lord tonight.
[1:52:10] Satan hates revelation,
[1:52:14] but we love it.
[1:52:17] What is it that keeps me coming back?
[1:52:20] It's the revealed word. Every day I open
[1:52:23] the book, Brother Ber, every single day,
[1:52:25] there's something new that stands out,
[1:52:27] that calls my name. There's something
[1:52:29] new that I can identify myself with in
[1:52:32] the word. and I flip through it and I
[1:52:34] say, "Man, I didn't know that that was
[1:52:36] in there, but that really speaks to my
[1:52:38] heart." That's why reading your Bible
[1:52:40] and praying, praying and reading your
[1:52:42] Bible,
[1:52:44] don't do one without the other, you
[1:52:45] won't have the right interpretation.
[1:52:48] That's right.
[1:52:49] But pray, God, show me today what I need
[1:52:52] in your word. And see, if God don't
[1:52:55] start speaking to you,
[1:52:57] you say, "Well, I've never heard him in
[1:52:58] an audible voice." It may not be in an
[1:53:00] audible voice, but it's through a word.
[1:53:03] It's through a message book. It's
[1:53:05] through a tape. It's through a song.
[1:53:09] Come on, church.
[1:53:10] It's through another minister.
[1:53:12] It's through the pastor. It's through
[1:53:14] the preacher.
[1:53:15] Maybe it's through a brother or a
[1:53:18] sister.
[1:53:23] Go get water.
[1:53:26] With true revelation in our lives,
[1:53:29] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:53:32] us, but we prevail over them.
[1:53:38] We're victorious tonight.
[1:53:40] My favorite thing to say is, "Devil, we
[1:53:44] win."
[1:53:46] When he comes at me with guns blazing
[1:53:48] and both barrels shooting, devil, I win.
[1:53:51] You can shoot. You can scratch. You can
[1:53:53] claw. You can prod. You can poke. You
[1:53:55] can stick your nose where it don't
[1:53:57] belong. Go back to hell cuz I win.
[1:54:04] Thank you, Lord.
[1:54:06] Let's just bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:54:08] Father, we come before you tonight
[1:54:09] thankful, Lord, for another another
[1:54:12] outing of your word going forth, Lord.
[1:54:14] that we was able to be able to just find
[1:54:17] your spirit and move, Lord, as you've
[1:54:19] seen, Lord, to the PE needs of the
[1:54:20] people, as there was a call and a and a
[1:54:23] cry and there was a a pull on the word
[1:54:26] tonight, Lord. And we're thankful we
[1:54:27] could enter into that channel knowing
[1:54:29] that I'm nothing but a vessel. I'm
[1:54:31] nothing but a but just a just a man that
[1:54:33] just can do nothing on my own, but
[1:54:35] through you, Father,
[1:54:37] but through you, Father, all things are
[1:54:40] possible. And that ought to be our cry
[1:54:43] of every believer in here tonight. All
[1:54:46] things are possible to them who believe.
[1:54:49] We win. We win. Tonight we rebuke Satan.
[1:54:53] We rebuke any anxieties, any fears, any
[1:54:56] doubts, any any anger, any tempers. We
[1:54:59] rebuke all those all those spirits in
[1:55:01] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:55:03] tonight. We rebuke you, Satan.
[1:55:07] We win.
[1:55:09] We win.
[1:55:10] Lord, we love you. Thank you for
[1:55:12] delivering tonight on your word. Lord,
[1:55:14] we give you honor, praise, and glory.
[1:55:16] And ask that you go with us through this
[1:55:17] week. Bless the church. Bless each and
[1:55:20] every one of the individuals here
[1:55:21] tonight that's made an effort that's
[1:55:23] that's that's come here and through
[1:55:25] fought through tiredness. They've
[1:55:27] sacrificed their afternoon.
[1:55:29] But it wasn't a sacrifice when it's done
[1:55:31] in love.
[1:55:33] And it's because we love you, Lord, that
[1:55:36] we're here, Lord. We thank you, Lord. We
[1:55:39] love you in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:55:42] Amen.
[1:55:46] You got a song, brother David.
[1:55:51] [Music]
[1:56:02] seeking whom he may devour. The Bible
[1:56:08] tells us so
[1:56:11] and many souls have
[1:56:16] coming.
[1:56:17] [Music]
[1:56:20] But I'm so
[1:56:22] sus today is overcoming
[1:56:26] power. Oh, greater is he that is in me.
[1:56:33] Oh, greater is he that is in me. Oh,
[1:56:37] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:56:42] is in the world.
[1:56:46] And on the day of Pentecost,
[1:56:50] a rushing mighty wind.
[1:56:54] boy blew into the upper room and
[1:56:59] baptized all of them.
[1:57:03] And with a power gater than
[1:57:08] any earthly fool
[1:57:11] and I'm so glad I've got it, you want to
[1:57:16] let the whole world know. Oh, greater is
[1:57:21] he that is in me.
[1:57:26] She that is in me. Oh, greater is he
[1:57:30] that is in me than he that is in the
[1:57:35] world. Oh, greater is he that is in me.
[1:57:41] Yes, greater is he that is in me. For
[1:57:46] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:57:51] is in the world. And on the day of he a
[1:57:59] rushing mighty wind.
[1:58:02] Oh it flew into the upper room and
[1:58:07] baptized all of them.
[1:58:11] And with the power greater than
[1:58:15] any earthly f
[1:58:20] I'm so glad I've got it. I'm going to
[1:58:24] let the whole world know. Oh, greater is
[1:58:28] he that is in me.
[1:58:32] Greater is he that is in me.
[1:58:36] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:58:41] is in the world.
