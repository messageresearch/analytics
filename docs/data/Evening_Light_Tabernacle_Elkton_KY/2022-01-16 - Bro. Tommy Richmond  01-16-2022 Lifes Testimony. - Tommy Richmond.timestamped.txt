[36:47] won't go too much amen but i do want to
[36:49] talk about the importance of it amen and
[36:51] i thought i've been thinking about
[36:52] testifying and confessing amen testimony
[36:55] testimony is like a confession amen amen
[36:57] and so let's go to
[36:59] look at what jesus said about the
[37:01] importance of confessing him amen
[37:05] and first of all uh
[37:07] we'll go to mark 8 we want to talk about
[37:10] confessing him and not being ashamed of
[37:12] him amen
[37:14] mark 8.
[37:22] and i think it's also luke 9. there's
[37:25] two scriptures of course
[37:26] you know that mark luke and john a lot
[37:28] of them
[37:30] say this you know tell the story maybe
[37:32] just a little bit different but a lot of
[37:34] them have the same thing in it and i
[37:35] want to take math marks and luke's
[37:38] uh
[37:39] scripture of what they said
[37:42] amen
[37:43] mark 8 and we'll begin with verse 36-38
[37:49] it says uh
[37:51] mark let's go way back to verse 34 so we
[37:54] get the whole story and when he had
[37:56] called the people unto him
[37:58] with his disciples also he said unto
[38:00] them whosoever will can come after me
[38:03] let him deny himself take up and follow
[38:06] me
[38:06] for whosoever shall save his life shall
[38:09] lose it and whosoever will lose his life
[38:11] for my sake and the gospels the same
[38:14] shall save it
[38:15] for what is it profited a man if he
[38:17] shall gain the whole world and lose his
[38:19] own soul or what shall a man give in
[38:22] exchange for his soul now notice he's
[38:24] talking about your soul he's talking
[38:26] about eternity and what does he say here
[38:28] at the end
[38:29] whosoever therefore
[38:31] shall be ashamed of me and of my words
[38:36] in this adulterous and sinful generation
[38:39] of him also shall the son of man
[38:42] be ashamed
[38:44] now notice his last part
[38:47] he envelops of the whole of heaven
[38:50] all of his angels
[38:52] all right he tells you if you're ashamed
[38:54] of me in front of one or two people
[38:56] he says
[38:58] of him also shall the son of man be
[39:00] ashamed when he cometh in the glory of
[39:03] his father with all with the holy angels
[39:07] amen
[39:08] now over in luke luke says it also in
[39:12] verse chapter 9
[39:15] luke chapter 9.
[39:20] we'll let you be seated after this and i
[39:22] want to speak for about 10 minutes if
[39:24] that be okay
[39:25] then we'll have the service turned over
[39:27] to brother tommy
[39:28] amen for him to give his testimony of
[39:30] what christ has done in his life
[39:33] amen
[39:35] verse 23 of luke 9
[39:38] and he said unto them all if a man come
[39:41] after me let him deny himself and take
[39:44] up his cross daily
[39:46] and follow me for whosoever will save
[39:48] his life
[39:50] shall lose it and whosoever will lose
[39:51] his life for my sake the same shall
[39:55] save it for what is a man prophet if he
[39:58] gain the whole world and lose himself
[40:00] and be or be cast away
[40:02] for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and
[40:04] of my words of him shall the son of man
[40:06] also be ashamed when he shall come in
[40:09] his own glory
[40:11] and in his fathers
[40:13] and of the holy angels amen god bless
[40:17] you you can be seated this morning
[40:21] amen
[40:23] praise the lord how many knows that
[40:26] uh
[40:27] it's important not to be ashamed of
[40:30] jesus christ
[40:32] amen there's a lot of people that are
[40:34] shy just kind of oh they don't want to
[40:36] say something about jesus or somebody
[40:39] i'll say a curse word or something and
[40:40] they use the lord's name in vain and you
[40:42] know
[40:43] they don't have enough maybe in them to
[40:45] say well you shouldn't talk like that
[40:47] uh-huh you shouldn't say that i don't
[40:49] really want to hear that
[40:51] you know if you want to talk like that
[40:52] talk to somebody else like that i don't
[40:54] really want to hear it
[40:56] you don't want the recompense of what
[40:57] will come with it perhaps it's just well
[40:59] i'll just be quiet
[41:01] huh
[41:02] or just to be a witness just to be a
[41:04] witness for christ sometimes people are
[41:06] shamed to do it you should never be
[41:08] ashamed to be a witness for christ and
[41:10] to confess him amen
[41:13] all right let me see here i think in
[41:15] luke telling luke 12 he talks about
[41:17] calling it a confession
[41:19] all right not just being ashamed but but
[41:21] to confess in luke 12 and verse 8 it
[41:24] says also i say unto you whosoever shall
[41:27] confess me before men amen in other
[41:31] words
[41:33] you're not ashamed of him and you
[41:34] confess the lord jesus christ he says
[41:37] him shall the son of man also confess
[41:40] before the angels of god amen
[41:44] so in front of the whole hosts of heaven
[41:48] amen if you're not ashamed to confess
[41:50] him
[41:51] when he's there with all
[41:53] the holy angels
[41:55] amen he'll no doubt mention your name
[41:59] he won't be ashamed to say your name
[42:02] oh my
[42:04] i want you to try to imagine what it's
[42:06] going to be like when he's there with
[42:07] all of the holy angels
[42:09] and if the bible says he'll be ashamed
[42:11] of you
[42:12] right
[42:13] so i don't know just how that's going to
[42:15] work do you
[42:16] you know because you're ashamed of
[42:17] somebody you just kind of shrug away
[42:19] from them you know or maybe you would
[42:20] call out to god and he just said
[42:23] who are you
[42:25] just ashamed of you you know you feel
[42:28] real bad god he don't i don't know you
[42:30] you know
[42:31] that's a it's a it makes you feel bad if
[42:33] somebody acts like that target but he
[42:35] says he will be ashamed of you
[42:37] on that day if you're ashamed of him
[42:40] if you're not if you're ashamed to
[42:41] confess and if you live
[42:43] listen
[42:45] but if you do if you confess me before
[42:47] men
[42:48] him will he confess before god and all
[42:50] of his holy angels
[42:52] he won't be he won't be a ashamed to
[42:54] call your name
[42:56] and say well done
[42:58] your name put your name in there
[43:01] enter into the joys of the lord who has
[43:03] prepared for you from the foundation of
[43:05] the world come here
[43:08] call your name and come i'm not afraid
[43:09] to call your name when you're not
[43:11] ashamed of him
[43:13] amen
[43:15] how many knows our world our government
[43:19] politics everybody's ashamed of jesus
[43:22] they don't want no part of him they
[43:24] don't know want them nowhere around
[43:26] don't wanna mention his name
[43:28] our presidents they used to say god
[43:30] bless america they used to praise pray
[43:33] for america and they don't say that
[43:35] stuff anymore
[43:36] no right they hardly say that
[43:39] and that's a shame
[43:41] but folks god's people aren't like that
[43:43] amen we're not like
[43:45] that we're not afraid
[43:46] ashamed to confess the lord jesus christ
[43:49] amen quickly another one what what
[43:52] what paul said about it let's see what
[43:54] paul said in romans 10
[43:56] in romans 10 and verse 8
[44:00] paul says it this way
[44:02] what saith that the word is nigh thee
[44:04] even in thy mouth and in thy heart that
[44:06] is the word of faith which we preach
[44:09] that
[44:10] if thou shalt confess
[44:13] with thy mouth the lord jesus
[44:17] and shall believe in that heart that god
[44:20] has raised him from the dead how many
[44:22] know
[44:23] you got to believe what jesus died that
[44:25] he died for you that he confessed what
[44:27] he did for you
[44:29] you're not ashamed of what christ done
[44:34] but confess him first of all you got to
[44:36] believe in your heart that god has
[44:38] raised him from the dead
[44:40] and then confess it with your mouth
[44:44] salvation
[44:46] true salvation comes out through here
[44:49] you can't be
[44:51] saved and then be ashamed of him
[44:54] oh
[44:55] if you know what god has done for you're
[44:56] not ashamed of him you want to be a
[44:58] witness to everybody you want to tell
[45:00] everybody to know what christ has done
[45:02] for you
[45:03] how many believes that
[45:05] amen
[45:06] thou shalt now notice he says
[45:09] and believe in that heart god has raised
[45:11] him from the dead thou shalt be saved
[45:15] hallelujah so how many believes
[45:17] confession give it a testimony of the
[45:19] lord
[45:20] and it's part of your salvation it's
[45:22] part of being in heaven if you're
[45:23] ashamed to do that you're not ready to
[45:25] be a christian
[45:27] remember the days of jesus
[45:29] and the scribes the pharisees he says
[45:31] anybody that confesses him
[45:33] will be excommunicated everybody
[45:35] confesses christ they'd be thrown out
[45:37] even that man that was born blind and
[45:39] was opened he says you know he says he's
[45:41] of age ask him how he was healed
[45:44] because the parents knew that if they
[45:45] confessed him they'd get thrown out so
[45:47] they didn't want to confess him
[45:50] folks what kind of parent is that
[45:52] their child gets healed by their eyes
[45:54] they're ashamed to confess
[45:56] the man that was able to do this
[45:59] that's not much of a parent is it
[46:02] no
[46:03] i don't know about you but if my child i
[46:04] don't care what church i was in amen god
[46:07] healed him i'd say god healed him jesus
[46:09] healed him
[46:11] that's right
[46:12] amen
[46:15] thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[46:16] lord jesus shall believe in the heart
[46:17] god has raised him from and for with the
[46:19] heart man believeth unto righteousness
[46:22] and with the mouth confession is made
[46:24] unto salvation in other words it's just
[46:27] really not complete until you say
[46:29] something about i'll tell you just let
[46:31] everybody know the lord saved me
[46:34] amen god is good he's real
[46:38] amen
[46:39] not really else got salvation yet
[46:42] now i want to say something else and
[46:44] this is where i could go into a whole
[46:45] message and that is remember
[46:47] the bible says let us go without the
[46:49] camp bearing his reproach because
[46:52] don't matter what generation it is what
[46:54] time frame it is it is always a reproach
[46:57] to most of the world to confess the lord
[47:00] jesus christ
[47:02] always a reproach
[47:04] in other words it's a stickler it's it's
[47:07] it's sticky kind of remember jesus says
[47:09] you know my words have no place in you
[47:11] therefore you're not of god right my
[47:14] words have no place in you
[47:16] you can't hear me and he says you say if
[47:19] we'd have been in the days of the
[47:20] fathers we would not have been partakers
[47:22] of the blood of the prophets
[47:24] in other words back then we believe
[47:26] moses they said moses is our prophet
[47:28] abraham is our father that's what they
[47:29] told jesus
[47:31] and jesus said if abraham was your
[47:32] father moses your prophet you would
[47:35] believe me
[47:37] see folks it's not about just believing
[47:39] jesus of 2000 years ago it's about you
[47:41] believing jesus in your day
[47:44] amen
[47:46] amen let me tell you my confession this
[47:49] morning is
[47:50] uh is this is it's in matthew no it's in
[47:53] uh you see here
[47:56] okay let's go just a couple more can i
[47:58] go a little longer
[48:00] ah
[48:01] did i write it down i'm thinking it
[48:03] might be
[48:05] might be in
[48:07] mark
[48:09] no it's john 3 over here it is john 3.
[48:12] we want to talk about somebody that was
[48:13] ashamed of ashamed of christ
[48:17] and learned a little something
[48:18] now there was a man of the pharisees
[48:20] named nicodemus a ruler of the jews and
[48:22] the same came to jesus
[48:25] in front of everybody wanting to see him
[48:28] no he came to him by night
[48:32] i can't tell nobody where i'm going
[48:34] can't tell who i'm have an appointment
[48:36] with
[48:37] uh came and sneaked up there the same
[48:39] came to jesus by night and said unto
[48:40] rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[48:43] come from god for no man can do these
[48:46] miracles set down to us except god be
[48:49] with him
[48:50] how many knows nobody can work a miracle
[48:53] without god being with him
[48:56] and you know these miracles see this
[48:58] opening of the blind and lazarus raising
[49:00] and all they did just says god's got to
[49:02] be with him
[49:04] remember jesus said if you can't believe
[49:06] my words believe my works they testify
[49:09] who i am
[49:10] i think brother brian read it in the
[49:11] scriptures talking about you know you
[49:13] know believe the works
[49:15] amen
[49:16] let me tell you some how many knows that
[49:18] that's why we're not con we're not
[49:19] ashamed to confess what christ
[49:22] did in our generation
[49:24] amen
[49:26] oh my
[49:27] pentecost how many knows pentecost 3 000
[49:30] souls were added to them in one day
[49:33] in this generation jesus did 10 times
[49:36] that
[49:37] do you realize if i was to number it
[49:40] jesus had a ministry of three and a half
[49:42] years when he was here on the earth
[49:45] in our age he had like 25 or so years
[49:47] i'm not sure exactly what it is but it
[49:49] was it was from 33 i think to 65 or
[49:52] something 30 some years
[49:54] and miracles upon miracles from that the
[49:57] prophet could have never done
[49:58] brother branham could have never done it
[50:01] no we know that he could have never done
[50:03] it unless god was with him
[50:05] it was christ doing it bringing the
[50:08] message of this generation
[50:10] amen
[50:13] and some folks are kind of halfway a day
[50:15] kind of leery that i'm not
[50:17] people that got 13 different people
[50:18] raised from the dead miracles upon
[50:21] miracles that was not the prophet that
[50:22] was not a man that was christ doing it
[50:27] amen and i'm not sure i'm sure not could
[50:29] be ashamed to confess that god it was
[50:30] god i'm all in focus when i whenever god
[50:33] i know that it's god according to his
[50:35] word i'm all in not just part but all in
[50:38] amen i'm having hikes hikes i must be
[50:39] close to here we got some spark point on
[50:41] here
[50:42] praise the lord how many love the lord
[50:45] but to believe christ and what he has
[50:47] done in your day that's what it's all
[50:49] about
[50:49] because even jesus said you say you'd
[50:51] have been nah
[50:52] what you do with christ today is what
[50:54] you'd have done with him back then
[50:57] even so much that it's pretty strong
[50:59] that if you're a christian and you're
[51:01] led by the holy ghost you can say like
[51:03] first john did in chapter four and verse
[51:06] six he says we are of god
[51:09] he that knoweth god heareth us
[51:15] how many knows you shall know the truth
[51:17] and the true shall set you free my sheep
[51:19] they know my voice
[51:21] real sheep know the truth when they hear
[51:22] it
[51:23] and if the truth is in you
[51:26] which how many knows uh that's that's
[51:28] that's just the thing christ ascended
[51:30] but he re-descended on the day of
[51:31] pentecost
[51:32] and he never he came back can we say
[51:35] jesus came back to her
[51:37] and he is living in his people
[51:40] now what you do to his people you do to
[51:43] christ
[51:46] heareth us he that is not of god heareth
[51:48] not us and hereby know with the spirit
[51:50] of truth and the spirit of error
[51:53] you can judge a person by if the truth
[51:56] is presented to you and you reject it
[51:59] you show who you are
[52:02] because children of god do not reject
[52:04] the truth of god or the word of god they
[52:07] don't do it
[52:08] there's one thing's for sure
[52:11] if you're a child of god you don't live
[52:13] by bread alone but by you lived by every
[52:16] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[52:18] god
[52:19] amen so praise be to god so we testify
[52:23] of what christ has done in our
[52:24] generation
[52:26] amen
[52:28] and it's quite something when i think
[52:29] about how that the miracles that were
[52:31] done were
[52:34] hundreds of thousands times more than
[52:37] what jesus did
[52:38] remember greater works indeed shall you
[52:40] discerning of the thoughts and intents
[52:41] of the heart like the woman at the well
[52:44] you've had five husbands and the one
[52:45] you're living with that happened almost
[52:47] every service
[52:48] the prophet had almost every service he
[52:50] would discern the thoughts and dance of
[52:51] the heart say that's not me that's him
[52:53] he's here
[52:56] amen see what you do with that
[52:58] guarantee you
[53:00] you'll answer for it on the day of
[53:01] judgment
[53:03] amen even the prophet god said these
[53:05] tapes would be played back on judgment
[53:07] day
[53:08] it's not me it's him it's his works it's
[53:10] his doing
[53:11] it's the last prophet the last messenger
[53:14] sent to the gentiles before the
[53:15] destruction of the world amen
[53:18] all right god bless you this morning i'm
[53:20] looking forward to it amen i told tommy
[53:22] he had a video that he sent me that i
[53:24] wanted to play but i think he's got it

[55:27] know i'm gonna get up here and sing song
[55:28] time come for audition he's singing no
[55:31] song you know i ain't getting up here i
[55:32] do anything else but i ain't getting up
[55:34] there
[55:35] and uh every time i'd get up and share
[55:37] or i mean i could be just talking to
[55:38] somebody and i'd choke up and i mean you
[55:40] can ask my buddy here i was the best man
[55:42] in his wedding supposed to give a speech
[55:43] and i had this big old thing that i had
[55:46] i was gonna say all this stuff and
[55:48] i get like so many lines into it and
[55:50] like fold the paper up and put in my
[55:51] back pocket start winging it and cut it
[55:53] like two minutes you know like my buddy
[55:55] just called me story time tommy because
[55:58] i'd make a short story long and now i
[56:00] can get up here i can make a long story
[56:02] short you know what i'm saying so just
[56:03] had to bear with me here
[56:07] and i was expecting that i told
[56:08] everybody in your mama too to come on
[56:10] out here i was trying to get it all back
[56:11] to the gills you know
[56:12] and i'll tell you why here in mark's let
[56:15] me see
[56:18] mark 5 19.
[56:21] i got sidetracked there
[56:24] just pray that the lord will uh
[56:27] say what he wants me to say and take out
[56:29] what he wants me to leave out you know
[56:32] he said here in 5 19 albeit jesus
[56:35] suffered and suffered him not but saith
[56:38] unto him go home and tell our friends
[56:39] and tell them how great things the lord
[56:41] had done for thee and have had
[56:43] compassion on the praise god you know
[56:46] that that just means a lot to me because
[56:47] i should i had that scripture a long
[56:49] time ago when i do that never did it
[56:51] that's why i said that was testimony
[56:52] right at the beginning you know here we
[56:53] are praise god
[56:55] conquering these fears huh go to luke 19
[57:00] 37
[57:03] through 40.
[57:17] well i should probably mark my face
[57:20] your first for getting nervous huh
[57:24] i already said here he and they told him
[57:27] jesus of nazareth's passes by and he
[57:29] cried saying jesus thou son of david
[57:32] have mercy on me and they
[57:35] which went before rebuked him and that
[57:37] he should
[57:38] hold his peace and he cried so much the
[57:40] more thou son of david have mercy on me
[57:43] and jesus stood on and commanded him to
[57:46] be brought unto him and said unto him he
[57:49] said
[57:50] unto him and when he was come near he
[57:52] asked him what
[58:02] oh man
[58:12] yeah i was on the wrong chapter there
[58:15] yeah okay let me get on the right jeff
[58:19] i mean you're gonna have it you know
[58:24] and when he was come now even
[58:26] now
[58:28] just bear with me all right
[58:31] even now at the descent of the mount of
[58:33] olives the whole multitude of disciples
[58:35] began to rejoice and praise god with a
[58:37] loud voice with
[58:39] for the almighty works that god they had
[58:42] seen saying blessed be the king
[58:44] that cometh on the name of the lord
[58:46] peace in heaven glory in the highest and
[58:48] some of the pharisees from a multitude
[58:52] said unto him master
[58:54] rebuke thy disciples he said unto them
[58:56] said unto them i tell you that if these
[58:58] should hold their peace the stones would
[59:00] cry out immediately
[59:02] you know amen
[59:04] mark 10 27.
[59:11] i guess i could have kept them together
[59:28] mark 10 27 and jesus looking upon them
[59:31] saith with man
[59:32] it is impossible but not with god for
[59:35] all
[59:36] with god all things are possible
[59:38] 11 24
[59:41] therefore i say unto you whatsoever
[59:44] things you desire when you pray believe
[59:46] that you receive them and you shall have
[59:47] them
[59:48] matthew
[59:50] 17 20
[59:57] and jesus said on them because of your
[59:59] unbelief for verily i say unto you if
[1:00:01] you have faith as mustard faith has a
[1:00:03] grain of mustard seed you shall say it
[1:00:05] on this mountain remove hence to yonder
[1:00:08] place and it shall remove and nothing
[1:00:10] shall be impossible unto you
[1:00:14] hey man
[1:00:17] i see i had broke down a few things here
[1:00:19] i got quite a bit here i'm gonna get
[1:00:21] going try to get the rust knocked off
[1:00:22] here and i said well the last time you
[1:00:24] see me i was liking feeble old man but
[1:00:26] now look i still look old but now i come
[1:00:28] into you with power from on high
[1:00:30] carrying this sword i'm not a preacher
[1:00:32] i'm just going to use scriptures
[1:00:33] throughout the book
[1:00:35] to back my stories change the mind
[1:00:37] change
[1:00:39] stories of that god can change a man and
[1:00:41] i'm a witness of that
[1:00:44] here's some fuel for my fire fuel for
[1:00:47] your fears and my fears i started
[1:00:48] thinking of that way one day i'm laying
[1:00:50] there thinking about things which i'm
[1:00:52] fixing to talk about and i was just
[1:00:54] thinking
[1:00:55] about these things and they just started
[1:00:58] really burdening me
[1:01:00] and then i start
[1:01:02] using that you know it's just power and
[1:01:04] to overcome these fears
[1:01:06] he said you know here's some fuel
[1:01:08] if you ain't making mistakes you ain't
[1:01:10] trying don't fear to fail if you get
[1:01:12] knocked down to back up you need more
[1:01:14] fuel minding your loved ones that i see
[1:01:16] hurting and in jail people's children
[1:01:18] being tormented the lost loved ones my
[1:01:21] sister i lost my and all my family and
[1:01:24] my friends and all that they've lost and
[1:01:26] my friends and their family members and
[1:01:28] all the sicknesses and the things that's
[1:01:29] crippled up people in the bed and
[1:01:31] addictions and chains and it makes me
[1:01:32] angry and it just gives me fuel ready to
[1:01:34] go to war with jesus by my side he's
[1:01:37] brought me through so much like he did
[1:01:39] david fighting and bury the lion and
[1:01:40] goliath and so i'm i've been i've
[1:01:43] invited everybody and their mama you
[1:01:44] know you go big or go home and i thought
[1:01:46] that you know laura was telling me one
[1:01:47] day it was like you know either go home
[1:01:49] go big or go home you know i was feeling
[1:01:51] like you know it's been burdening me for
[1:01:53] a night don't be
[1:01:54] you know he's done back me up by all
[1:01:56] these things he brought me through so
[1:01:57] why fear you know
[1:02:00] and uh you know if god be force who can
[1:02:02] be against
[1:02:04] us and he said in second kings here
[1:02:07] elijah prayed and said unto the lord i
[1:02:08] pray they open their eyes that they may
[1:02:10] see that the lord their their eyes
[1:02:13] of the young man he saw and behold the
[1:02:14] mountain was full of horses and
[1:02:15] cherished round the fire elisha and he
[1:02:17] said you know i believe in here today
[1:02:19] that you know there's angels and
[1:02:20] everything in here today you know
[1:02:24] i said you know you can't control the
[1:02:25] hand we're dealt but we can talk to one
[1:02:28] talk to the one who can
[1:02:31] we've all come from different walks of
[1:02:33] life but i ask you to think about your
[1:02:34] life and your is your glass half full or
[1:02:37] half empty today can you see the forest
[1:02:38] for the trees or you just don't get cold
[1:02:42] and stagnant lukewarm mad or angry with
[1:02:44] god are you not
[1:02:46] or maybe you're not where you once was
[1:02:48] let's wreak in on that fire here today
[1:02:50] the power of the blood in the word
[1:02:53] ephesians 6 17 says it's the helmet and
[1:02:55] a two-wedged sword and you know it cuts
[1:02:58] coming and going the bible says and in
[1:02:59] romans 3 4 he said let god be true and
[1:03:02] every man be a liar so even though i may
[1:03:04] fail you everyone else may fail fail me
[1:03:07] and everything fails but one thing that
[1:03:09] i
[1:03:10] that don't that's my absolute that's my
[1:03:12] jesus that's this word my sword that
[1:03:14] overcomes satan anytime anywhere

[1:03:35] lives in me to show
[1:03:36] here's a few of my life's testimonies
[1:03:39] that he's brought me through and where
[1:03:40] i've been and where i'm going and some
[1:03:41] of what he's brought me through and i
[1:03:43] hope some of these stories inspire and
[1:03:45] lift your faith and help someone else
[1:03:47] or maybe even start your walk most of
[1:03:49] all glorify our lord god almighty
[1:03:51] because i only believe all things are
[1:03:53] possible hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the
[1:03:56] same yesterday and forever
[1:03:59] you know i was expecting a lot a lot
[1:04:00] more people here today but being they'll
[1:04:02] try to get them sick and bring in storms
[1:04:05] everything we're about to get more
[1:04:07] eggman's how y'all gonna get a little
[1:04:08] water here you know
[1:04:13] there you go
[1:04:14] and uh i was i'm just gonna
[1:04:16] try to lay it out i'm not good with
[1:04:18] words and my memory is really bad
[1:04:21] uh especially to get up here and if i
[1:04:23] start freezing
[1:04:25] but anyway uh
[1:04:27] i just want to kind of give a foundation
[1:04:28] in my life
[1:04:30] just a little bit of my personality as i
[1:04:32] was growing up i'm not gonna hit on a
[1:04:33] whole lot of stuff just kind of give
[1:04:35] some stuff you know
[1:04:37] get us on down the road and that makes
[1:04:39] sense why i'm where i'm at today
[1:04:41] you know as i was growing up well i i
[1:04:43] was told that you know i was born i was
[1:04:45] born prematurely i always laugh joke
[1:04:47] about this because i had things to do
[1:04:49] i'd get out here and get to work you
[1:04:50] know
[1:04:51] mama and my aunt them told me you know
[1:04:53] they seen me when i was they sneaking
[1:04:54] their house getting out they sneaking
[1:04:56] there i'm crying over the baby bed
[1:04:57] sliding down the rails you know
[1:04:59] you sp and as i was growing up you know
[1:05:01] i was just a big daredevil i'd do
[1:05:03] anything you know it didn't matter what
[1:05:04] you was doing skating biking it didn't
[1:05:06] matter i broke bones got into fights all
[1:05:09] the time you know i was self-conscious
[1:05:11] and stuff too growing up i you know we
[1:05:13] didn't have a whole lot when i was young
[1:05:15] and you know you
[1:05:16] you might have been wearing like same
[1:05:17] clothes you know had grass stains so you
[1:05:20] just start being self-conscious about
[1:05:21] that you know you just want to you just
[1:05:23] kind of want to be cool you know and fit
[1:05:25] in with everybody you know how it is in
[1:05:27] school
[1:05:29] uh and as i was growing up i had uh
[1:05:31] i had a bad temper a real bad temper
[1:05:34] and i had this chip on my shoulder from
[1:05:36] some might call it the short man cinder
[1:05:38] my color whatever you will but
[1:05:40] i had to prove to you that uh i was just
[1:05:42] tough as you was
[1:05:43] and uh
[1:05:44] you know as it didn't matter
[1:05:47] you mixed the temper with uh no fear
[1:05:51] uh you got a bad combination
[1:05:54] you could bump me look at me wrong and i
[1:05:56] would be ready to fight literally
[1:06:00] uh
[1:06:01] and i got all this full so y'all just
[1:06:03] either pray that i hurry up or take my
[1:06:06] time
[1:06:10] uh
[1:06:13] oh yeah and i then we're on down the
[1:06:15] just that temper and you know that
[1:06:17] fighting mentality you know and
[1:06:19] uh you know as you grow up and they
[1:06:22] start getting mad at things you know
[1:06:24] getting destructive punching holes
[1:06:25] through walls you know and
[1:06:28] i've always been like that and
[1:06:31] i don't know i think it's kind of molded
[1:06:33] and shaped in me though
[1:06:35] something about that fighting character
[1:06:37] i believe you know
[1:06:38] but it's just how you use it i guess but
[1:06:40] you know i progressed on and we'll get
[1:06:42] on down the line to uh
[1:06:46] as i was i don't know how over old well
[1:06:48] i was 15 when i started doing uh
[1:06:51] some drugs and drinking a little bit and
[1:06:53] you know eventually it just
[1:06:57] became fun you know because you know i
[1:06:59] wrote this dopamine down because you
[1:07:01] know back in them days we didn't know i
[1:07:03] didn't know nothing about all that and
[1:07:05] you know when you're riding bikes
[1:07:07] skating doing them things you know
[1:07:09] lifting weights any of that you get
[1:07:10] dopamines going your phone anything
[1:07:12] you're doing you're getting them
[1:07:13] dopamine going it releases you can eat
[1:07:15] food
[1:07:16] and it's a natural high that your body
[1:07:18] gets you know looking back we didn't
[1:07:20] know that you know that's why i think
[1:07:22] you know i fell into you know i just
[1:07:24] always like i guess dopamine and you
[1:07:27] know uh
[1:07:29] so uh
[1:07:32] that i put on here i was a bit of
[1:07:33] extremist you know you can probably
[1:07:34] already see that we're fixing to we're
[1:07:36] gonna probably see that by the time i
[1:07:37] get to the end of this
[1:07:38] uh i couldn't just uh get up here and
[1:07:41] just share a little testimony it seemed
[1:07:42] like i got to drag out my
[1:07:44] life story i don't know why but
[1:07:48] uh
[1:07:50] i got stories for days i even wrote that
[1:07:52] here and i got stories for days we can
[1:07:53] keep on going and on and on and on but
[1:07:56] i'll just get to some of the high points
[1:07:57] you know i remember a time that i was in
[1:08:00] high school it was my senior year
[1:08:02] and
[1:08:03] i was actually in the hallway arguing
[1:08:05] with my girlfriend at the time
[1:08:07] and this dude said something to me and
[1:08:09] uh
[1:08:10] well he said he just hit me wrong you
[1:08:12] know and like i said my temper never
[1:08:14] hurt i'm already fighting anyway then
[1:08:15] you
[1:08:16] you had on run your mouth and i went
[1:08:18] down there and
[1:08:19] anyway make a long story short when
[1:08:20] you're getting on big detail but we've
[1:08:22] about gotten a big fight got tackled by
[1:08:25] the vice principal you know get
[1:08:27] suspended from school and everything and
[1:08:28] i come back and when i come back from
[1:08:30] school he told me you know i was going
[1:08:32] to be in school suspension i'm like
[1:08:35] no i'm not going to be in school
[1:08:37] suspension and he was like yeah blah
[1:08:39] blah blah there you are and i got all
[1:08:41] mad and got in his face and put poking
[1:08:43] him in the face and thing and he said

[1:09:03] you know after all that you know i was
[1:09:05] uh

[1:09:46] we'll come find out now navy seals what
[1:09:48] i hear is about us guys
[1:09:50] but anyway uh
[1:09:53] you know god had a different plan for me
[1:09:55] and uh
[1:09:56] you know
[1:09:57] i had done her tough lessons tough life

[1:10:14] careful what you wish for
[1:10:16] i was at arby's and uh
[1:10:18] the drunk driver came through the
[1:10:19] building and hit them grease fryers and

[1:10:46] the dude nails it in reverse comes
[1:10:48] around plows the rb sign about kills me
[1:10:51] a second time right there within minutes
[1:10:54] i mean seconds probably and i'm standing
[1:10:56] there then ripping my clothes off and
[1:10:58] all my skin's just falling off my arms
[1:11:00] and everything
[1:11:01] pretty
[1:11:02] unimaginable but anyway
[1:11:04] you know and you know i say all that to
[1:11:06] say you know if i hadn't made stupid
[1:11:08] choices for one quit in school i would
[1:11:11] have been in school that day i would
[1:11:12] have been standing there where i was at
[1:11:14] you know but
[1:11:15] uh you know the good lord works in
[1:11:17] mysterious ways you know
[1:11:19] i got a
[1:11:21] uh and i remember one time i they told

[1:11:38] i was just crying my heart out facing
[1:11:41] the pill i don't know why but i was
[1:11:42] thinking you know
[1:11:44] nobody's ever going to love me now for
[1:11:46] me they're just going to love me for the
[1:11:47] money you know or
[1:11:49] because my scars
[1:11:51] you know and i just cried and
[1:11:53] picked my head up
[1:11:55] my pillow was just soaked in blood and i
[1:11:57] was just like
[1:11:59] you know i just wanted to forget that
[1:12:00] that was just something to me you know
[1:12:02] that i thought you know nobody's ever
[1:12:03] going to love me you know but
[1:12:05] jesus christ loves me and that's all
[1:12:07] that matters
[1:12:09] and then
[1:12:10] my wife
[1:12:11] my wonderful wife you know i mean
[1:12:13] wow
[1:12:14] she's got a powerful testimony too i
[1:12:16] mean
[1:12:18] everything i put her through
[1:12:21] you can only imagine we'll get to that
[1:12:22] here shortly but
[1:12:24] you know
[1:12:25] she loves me is where i was going with
[1:12:27] that praise god
[1:12:36] i got a settlement
[1:12:37] you know
[1:12:38] i still got the old black truck that i
[1:12:40] bought from it in the couch and stuff a
[1:12:41] few things but
[1:12:43] at the end of the day i run through the
[1:12:44] money we was having fun i was young
[1:12:47] i looked back behind
[1:12:49] 20. you know i learned that uh
[1:12:51] money won't buy you happiness you know
[1:12:53] cause i had a pretty good little chunk
[1:12:54] at that time and uh
[1:12:57] uh
[1:12:58] we should do the same things if he's
[1:13:00] gonna do all this do all that didn't
[1:13:01] even do it all we did was ride the roads
[1:13:03] get drunk get out did the same things it
[1:13:05] was some doping means you know
[1:13:07] then you start realizing you got an
[1:13:08] addiction you got a problem you know
[1:13:11] and uh
[1:13:12] because you start growing up a little
[1:13:14] bit you know
[1:13:15] and uh
[1:13:17] but uh
[1:13:19] i i won't forget this time too it's
[1:13:21] pretty crazy story i was riding in the
[1:13:22] car i bought i bought this car
[1:13:25] and uh it's pretty cool
[1:13:27] i had it tricked out a little bit and
[1:13:29] i'm going down the road i was going to
[1:13:30] see my buddy actually he was getting off
[1:13:32] work
[1:13:33] i'm going down the road this is how god
[1:13:34] works in mysterious ways i mean you know
[1:13:37] and i thank god for the courage it gives
[1:13:39] me in life you know because it's it's
[1:13:41] helped me tremendously in things and
[1:13:43] it's helped me uh
[1:13:45] do and accomplish a lot of things a lot
[1:13:46] of people couldn't
[1:13:48] but uh
[1:13:49] i i won't forget this either i'm i'm
[1:13:52] driving out through her this car comes
[1:13:54] rolling up on me speeding up on me and
[1:13:55] it looks like i remember this at that
[1:13:57] time it was like a little jeep cherokee
[1:13:59] sheriff's truck and russell i thought oh
[1:14:01] my gosh he's fixing it i'm fixing to get
[1:14:03] hit here he comes and i slow down and
[1:14:05] pull over
[1:14:07] and you know forget you know this is a
[1:14:08] lot of years ago i try to do the best i
[1:14:10] can to tell a story if i say it wrong
[1:14:12] lord forgive me about any story i say
[1:14:14] for that matter uh
[1:14:16] but
[1:14:16] i'm going down through her and i pull
[1:14:18] over and they they pulled in front of me
[1:14:20] and i see then it wasn't a cop car i'm
[1:14:21] like that's weird so then i keep going i
[1:14:23] keep going i'm driving out there they
[1:14:25] pull back up beside me this guy is
[1:14:27] leaning out the thing with like a big
[1:14:28] old pipe wrench and something and i'm
[1:14:30] like and it was a bunch of them you know
[1:14:32] i'm not by myself and i had this fake it
[1:14:33] was like an aerosol pistol i pulled it
[1:14:36] up by the side dude pulls up a gun i'm
[1:14:37] like god i hit the brakes they get in
[1:14:40] front of me they whip it over in front
[1:14:41] of me they throw something out the
[1:14:42] window i don't know what it was but it
[1:14:44] looked like a cloud of smoke and i'm
[1:14:45] like you know i'm
[1:14:48] bobbing and waving to go around that and
[1:14:50] i'm going out there and i'm flying i'm
[1:14:51] going and i'm like these freaking idiots
[1:14:53] i think they're trying to carjack my car
[1:14:55] so i'm nil on it and i blow their doors
[1:14:57] i get all the way down and i hit the
[1:14:59] e-brake whip it around uh in the middle
[1:15:01] of the road under uh caution lights and
[1:15:02] islands and there's where the courage
[1:15:04] comes in because i come flying right
[1:15:06] back at them dead center road i'm so mad
[1:15:08] i don't care i'm we're going to hit you
[1:15:11] know
[1:15:11] they ran off the road
[1:15:13] it was funny but you know thank god he
[1:15:15] was with me then too even when i was
[1:15:17] doing wrong you know and gave me the
[1:15:18] courage to do something like that
[1:15:19] because they probably
[1:15:20] all them guys they're probably going to
[1:15:22] rough me up and take my car that'll kill
[1:15:23] me who knows you know
[1:15:24] but uh
[1:15:27] that's just funny time i don't want to
[1:15:28] forget that
[1:15:29] nobody's there to witness it but jesus
[1:15:32] and uh
[1:15:35] it goes even further than that but we
[1:15:38] ain't got to go through all that
[1:15:40] part of me wants to but i'm bad about
[1:15:41] dragging a lot of stories uh that's what
[1:15:43] happens see
[1:15:46] and i have a sense of humor and a lot of
[1:15:49] times i could never get up here and
[1:15:50] loosen up with him so i'm trying to
[1:15:51] loosen up with it so you'll just bear
[1:15:52] with me on that too
[1:15:58] me and my friends we had roommates
[1:16:01] we all were running around and
[1:16:02] everything
[1:16:04] then i wound up getting in a
[1:16:05] relationship
[1:16:07] and kind of slowed me down a little bit
[1:16:09] you know being now that i'm kind of
[1:16:10] dating
[1:16:12] blah blah blah and then you know one day
[1:16:14] i was asked to go to church i hadn't
[1:16:15] been in church in a long time i went a
[1:16:17] few times with my dad and every now and
[1:16:18] then with a buddy and uh my grandpa
[1:16:21] would take me and
[1:16:23] and stuff like that and uh
[1:16:25] some of my friends every now and then
[1:16:27] i'd go with them to different churches
[1:16:29] and
[1:16:30] then i was like alright yeah i'll go i
[1:16:32] ain't been in a while you know and uh
[1:16:35] i was there i won't i won't forget
[1:16:38] you know because i i this point in my
[1:16:40] life people talk about god i ain't gonna
[1:16:43] hear you know what i'm saying i'm gonna
[1:16:44] talk about it i ain't gonna talk about
[1:16:45] it that's just the way i was you know i
[1:16:47] mean i lived wild and i mean
[1:16:50] i mean
[1:16:52] i just remember even like talking about
[1:16:53] church girl i was like i don't even want
[1:16:55] no church girl you know i don't even
[1:16:56] want a good girl back then you know
[1:16:59] and you just think of your personality
[1:17:01] how i was but
[1:17:02] uh
[1:17:03] i'm like i go to church anyway i'm in
[1:17:05] church i'm up there and i won't forget
[1:17:08] god just start you know how god does
[1:17:11] sometimes he starts speaking through you
[1:17:12] somehow with things and you're just like
[1:17:15] you feel like he's talking straight to
[1:17:16] you and i thought it was so weird you
[1:17:18] know what i'm saying and uh
[1:17:20] i remember this guy getting up her
[1:17:21] guitar and i'm like oh my gosh here this
[1:17:23] guy goes you know and he gets up there
[1:17:26] and
[1:17:26] actually
[1:17:27] wouldn't say it but he was colored guy
[1:17:29] you know but back then i was thinking
[1:17:31] you know i can't believe this guy gonna
[1:17:33] get up for a guitar you know kind of
[1:17:35] racial back in a little bit sometimes
[1:17:36] and uh
[1:17:38] uh
[1:17:39] i ain't today and uh
[1:17:44] he sung his heart out man and it was
[1:17:46] awesome it was touched me you know and
[1:17:49] uh
[1:17:50] god just kept dealing with me anyway
[1:17:53] and
[1:17:54] i just ignored it
[1:17:56] kept pushing it back it's fine whatever
[1:17:59] i leave i'm going down the road and i
[1:18:01] ain't even kidding you god is my witness
[1:18:03] you can believe me you don't have to and
[1:18:05] it was as though audible voice which was
[1:18:08] probably not audible or she would have
[1:18:10] heard it but it was though his audible
[1:18:12] voice said you're walking away from god
[1:18:15] i just kept on driving i'm like
[1:18:17] and they just hit me man i just started
[1:18:19] bawling i turned i turned the truck
[1:18:21] around i said i got to go back i got to
[1:18:23] go back i gotta go find that preacher
[1:18:25] i gotta go talk to him you know i didn't
[1:18:26] know what was happening you know
[1:18:28] and i go back
[1:18:30] and that guy sit there and led me to the
[1:18:31] lord
[1:18:32] and that day from that day on
[1:18:35] never been the same
[1:18:38] it changed my life in a noticeable way i
[1:18:41] i no more did things that i i normally
[1:18:44] did i was
[1:18:45] shying away from things that i never
[1:18:47] would have
[1:18:49] you know it was a
[1:18:50] new birth experience and i remember i
[1:18:53] was building i built the cross out of
[1:18:55] nowhere i built this cross and wrote on
[1:18:57] the back of it god is love where'd that
[1:18:59] come from i like to think now that it
[1:19:01] was like
[1:19:02] he punched the devil right in the mouth
[1:19:04] you know what i'm saying huh
[1:19:05] yeah that's what i like to think but uh
[1:19:09] uh
[1:19:16] but i was telling all my friends about
[1:19:17] it and everything and
[1:19:19] and
[1:19:20] uh how long have i been up here
[1:19:25] five minutes oh that's good he made it
[1:19:27] to 12 30 maybe i can get there
[1:19:38] oh yeah i was just i was sharing it with
[1:19:40] my friends and all the time you know you
[1:19:41] had that fire now something bubbling
[1:19:42] inside of you that i'm sure and you know
[1:19:44] it's
[1:19:45] it just has to but you know
[1:19:47] in time it was you know i was living
[1:19:49] with friends and you know with roommates
[1:19:50] and you know i just kind of slowly you
[1:19:52] know
[1:19:53] i went against that still small voice
[1:19:55] that don't do it you know i and i did it
[1:19:57] next thing you know i'm back to where i
[1:19:59] was before i gave my heart to the lord
[1:20:01] but then i became worse then i became
[1:20:04] even real jealous even more even
[1:20:06] controlling and you know whether it
[1:20:08] wound up ending my relationship you know
[1:20:11] because of how i was and then i go on i
[1:20:13] go on for years and years uh pretty wild
[1:20:16] you know
[1:20:17] drugs and temper and getting in trouble
[1:20:19] and
[1:20:21] you know especially put on there you
[1:20:23] know mixing no fear with drugs and
[1:20:25] alcohol and temper now we really have a
[1:20:27] recipe for disaster got me in a lot of
[1:20:29] trouble
[1:20:30] uh i went now went running for years
[1:20:33] back wide open backwards for a long time
[1:20:36] you know in proverbs 13 5 it says the
[1:20:38] way of a transgressor is hard
[1:20:41] and i can tell you it is and james 1 8 a
[1:20:43] double-minded man is unstable in his
[1:20:45] ways
[1:20:46] and i can't describe literally how many
[1:20:49] times god has saved my life you know i
[1:20:51] mean it's uncountable i mean that's why
[1:20:53] i said i'm just trying to get some high
[1:20:54] points just a few things that you know a
[1:20:55] few stories here and there lay a
[1:20:57] foundation but i mean we couldn't write
[1:21:00] enough books in here for all what he's
[1:21:02] done for me
[1:21:03] uh
[1:21:04] and then one night i was i've been
[1:21:06] riding around with some friends i got
[1:21:08] home they dropped me off i got on my
[1:21:09] motorcycle and i'm like i'm gonna go for
[1:21:11] a ride you know i ride you know and i
[1:21:14] was always a show off too i'd like to
[1:21:15] show off and it just gave me cur even
[1:21:18] more courage you know you know how we
[1:21:19] are we gotta you gotta jump off the high
[1:21:21] truck up here you know what i'm saying
[1:21:23] it's just what it's just how it is you
[1:21:24] know and uh
[1:21:26] so i i'm riding my bike and i blow their
[1:21:29] doors past them and uh you know i'm
[1:21:31] drunk and i get down the road and i do
[1:21:33] donut and i'm coming back up at the end
[1:21:35] of the road they're coming up the hill
[1:21:36] and i see their lights and i'm like
[1:21:37] because i know that road and i'm like
[1:21:39] oh man i hope they ain't right in the
[1:21:41] middle or something you know a lot of
[1:21:42] hitting me head on so i kind of hugged
[1:21:44] the right and when i did
[1:21:46] they passed me and then i went down the
[1:21:48] road kind of done this and i went back
[1:21:50] looking hindsight you know and
[1:21:52] i must have went off in the grass right
[1:21:54] there because it was a straight shot
[1:21:55] because the road curved so when i was
[1:21:57] hooking that right side i went off came
[1:21:59] back on where the barn you know they'll
[1:22:01] do the blacktop and kind of be a little
[1:22:02] pull in came back on there in front of
[1:22:04] the barn window flipping my motorcycle
[1:22:06] and everything down through here
[1:22:08] didn't really know nothing i woke up the
[1:22:10] next morning i mean mouth so swelled up
[1:22:12] couldn't hardly talk uh
[1:22:14] now i know i was dislocated shoulder i'm
[1:22:16] walking got one shoe long and i'm like i
[1:22:19] mean it's just sun just now coming up
[1:22:21] and uh
[1:22:22] i'm like what in the world you don't
[1:22:24] even know what's happened here and i'm
[1:22:26] like oh my gosh i see my bike shine
[1:22:29] chrome on i'm like i don't wreck my
[1:22:30] motorcycle and uh
[1:22:33] i go over to i'm like i'm gonna try to
[1:22:35] lamp at home bars all bent down and
[1:22:37] everything i said well maybe i can still
[1:22:38] limp at home i go to pick it up and i'm
[1:22:40] gonna try to start the keys were in my
[1:22:42] pocket so i don't know how that happened
[1:22:44] but i don't know if i tried to ride it
[1:22:45] again at night or what and the world
[1:22:46] happened but i guess i had passed back
[1:22:48] out and then my dad come and he found me
[1:22:51] he and it tore him all up because he
[1:22:53] look he thought i was going to be dead
[1:22:55] and the way i looked and everything and
[1:22:58] you know
[1:23:00] being backslidden and where i was at you
[1:23:01] know all along when you backslide on god
[1:23:04] you always want to do a little better
[1:23:06] but then you're always beating yourself
[1:23:07] up because you're not then you're always
[1:23:09] not doing better and you snowball you
[1:23:11] know what i'm saying
[1:23:12] and uh
[1:23:14] so now i'm all jacked up black eyes
[1:23:16] everything else i'm like man lord when i
[1:23:19] get healed up i'm gonna go to church
[1:23:21] and i came to this church before one
[1:23:22] time i thought man a bunch of weirdos

[1:23:27] uh
[1:23:29] that's what i thought but you know by
[1:23:31] god's grace he buried with me didn't he

[1:23:58] girl
[1:23:59] and uh
[1:24:00] i asked josh or melanie and i'm like
[1:24:02] what's what's that girl's number what
[1:24:03] she you know try to get her number for
[1:24:05] me you know they get her number in their
[1:24:06] hand we start talking or whatever

[1:24:21] her and uh
[1:24:24] got her number we talked for a while you
[1:24:26] know on the phone and stuff like that
[1:24:27] and then i took her on first date being
[1:24:30] extreme as i am we're not just going to
[1:24:31] do something normal i'll take her to
[1:24:32] pilot rock
[1:24:34] we climb up there just said stars
[1:24:35] because it's so beautiful and beautiful
[1:24:36] to talk you know i love about rock it's
[1:24:38] so pretty up here especially at night
[1:24:40] time
[1:24:41] and we dated for a while and you know
[1:24:44] you can ask
[1:24:45] signs from god sometimes you can ask him
[1:24:47] for maybe something and it might be
[1:24:49] really weird i've asked for really weird
[1:24:50] things and not even got him this was one
[1:24:52] of them i was praying i had been praying
[1:24:54] when i meet the right one sometimes i go
[1:24:56] sit on my front porch out of my old
[1:24:57] trailer i'd sit there and there was this
[1:24:58] fork in this tree i slept three fallen
[1:25:00] stars fall right there you know that's a
[1:25:02] weird thing to ask and i'm talking to
[1:25:03] her on the phone sitting there and all
[1:25:05] of a sudden
[1:25:06] i see all three i'm like well that was
[1:25:09] weird i don't know that was just a
[1:25:10] coincidence i guess you know you're
[1:25:11] thinking man
[1:25:12] wow i don't know but anyway you know
[1:25:18] things that happened and
[1:25:20] you know
[1:25:21] i started getting a little jealous just
[1:25:23] a little bit i don't know why sometimes
[1:25:26] looking back in my life the only time i
[1:25:27] ever got a little jealous is when i
[1:25:29] really cared about somebody i don't know
[1:25:30] if it was just afraid of getting hurt or
[1:25:32] what it was but
[1:25:33] uh only the
[1:25:35] couple girls i really cared about i'd
[1:25:37] get like it so then i started getting
[1:25:38] like it hurt and i thought you know what
[1:25:40] i i ain't doing this again
[1:25:42] and i was actually thinking about
[1:25:44] uh breaking up just because of how i was
[1:25:47] i didn't want to be that way and you
[1:25:49] know god had other plans and you know it
[1:25:51] ended up working out and
[1:25:53] we end up just kept on dating everything
[1:25:55] but
[1:25:56] uh
[1:25:58] as it progressed of course i got to
[1:26:00] where i was
[1:26:01] really way more control and then i
[1:26:03] started drinking a lot more and then
[1:26:04] then
[1:26:05] you know the drinking was fun you know
[1:26:07] you do things and you know
[1:26:09] whatever but one of the train you know
[1:26:12] beer they say got a
[1:26:14] good acquired taste uh
[1:26:16] it wasn't i didn't i didn't care that
[1:26:17] much about it a whole lot until one
[1:26:19] morning i drank one morning and i drink
[1:26:21] one morning and i look back and
[1:26:24] that was life changing there
[1:26:26] uh
[1:26:27] i started drinking all day
[1:26:29] you know i look back i think a lot of it
[1:26:32] you you're trying to
[1:26:34] well at that time
[1:26:37] uh
[1:26:39] i mean i'm partying drinking still like
[1:26:41] normal you know
[1:26:43] just not as bad as i was
[1:26:45] and uh because i'm still you know we're
[1:26:48] dating everything and we got married and
[1:26:51] yada yada
[1:26:53] uh
[1:26:56] then we end up having our son lyric say
[1:26:58] some prayers for him he's sick they're
[1:26:59] getting bigger today
[1:27:03] you know and uh
[1:27:07] uh
[1:27:09] deep brain freezer

[1:27:16] now let's get off my nose here
[1:27:21] huh
[1:27:23] oh you're quite a few times
[1:27:29] oh yeah the morning drinking well once
[1:27:32] that happened man
[1:27:34] you know it
[1:27:35] turned from being just for more fun and
[1:27:38] you know because you're growing up
[1:27:39] responsibilities are starting to add up
[1:27:41] things you need to be doing is adding up
[1:27:43] you're not taking care of them you're
[1:27:45] still acting like you're 18 years old
[1:27:47] you know
[1:27:48] and uh
[1:27:49] but i start drinking in the morning i
[1:27:51] think then you kind of now you know you
[1:27:53] take it first drink in the morning i
[1:27:55] mean seven o'clock i'd pop the top by
[1:27:57] six o'clock
[1:27:59] i'd have six back in me and i mean
[1:28:02] it was crazy but i was a functional
[1:28:04] drunk you know which i thought i was
[1:28:06] anyway
[1:28:08] uh
[1:28:08] thought i could do about anything doing
[1:28:11] it i became where i felt more normal
[1:28:14] drunk than i was normal
[1:28:16] and
[1:28:18] uh you know
[1:28:21] dragged that out but
[1:28:22] that morning where i'm trying to
[1:28:24] emphasize on that that's when it changed
[1:28:25] my life on drinking to where now
[1:28:28] i really rely on it
[1:28:30] daily because then you know i mean
[1:28:32] day in and day out i'd be uh
[1:28:35] i'd be leaving work leave my
[1:28:37] responsibility not taking care of the
[1:28:38] things i should be taking care of
[1:28:41] and uh
[1:28:42] you know became a full-time job
[1:28:46] feeding my addiction it ruled me ruled
[1:28:48] over my life you know i even got to work
[1:28:51] because you know you backslide like i

[1:30:17] it's crazy when you're out there doing
[1:30:19] running wild like that
[1:30:22] but uh
[1:30:23] all along here i've been building a rap
[1:30:24] sheet a mile long you know and it's just
[1:30:28] anyway
[1:30:29] we ain't gonna get into all that but
[1:30:31] then i went on that probably went on
[1:30:33] about five months
[1:30:35] really just just a crazy man you know if
[1:30:37] it weren't for jesus i
[1:30:39] i'd be someone i'd be on some old show
[1:30:41] which i've literally i've seen these
[1:30:43] shows of these guys that got jealous on
[1:30:45] like snap you know they've snapped you
[1:30:47] know
[1:30:48] got jealous and this and that and killed
[1:30:50] their old lady you know controlling
[1:30:51] couldn't take it no more winds up
[1:30:53] sniping you know everything that guy
[1:30:55] talked about and everything they i had
[1:30:57] all them signs i was a guy you know i'm
[1:30:59] saying i would have been a murderer just
[1:31:00] like you hear
[1:31:03] it's crazy but that's just the lord
[1:31:04] jesus held me back from going too far
[1:31:07] praise god you know in in that time
[1:31:10] of just
[1:31:12] full-blown madness man i mean it
[1:31:14] literally was madness you know it was so
[1:31:15] much devil trying to
[1:31:18] i'll be bringing it home shortly about
[1:31:19] you know
[1:31:20] but so many devils with that jealousy
[1:31:22] spirit that controlled my life and then
[1:31:24] in turn and controlled her and then
[1:31:25] ruined everybody's life around me
[1:31:27] because you know she can't even have a
[1:31:28] good time know where she goes because
[1:31:29] i'm all jealous and trying to control
[1:31:31] everything and i can't have fun here
[1:31:33] because
[1:31:34] i mean i'm telling these jealousy
[1:31:35] spirits it's it's a rough devil
[1:31:38] play in some of the places i've been and
[1:31:40] addictions and the things i've seen
[1:31:43] outside of jesus rarely do they come
[1:31:45] back i've been down the bottom of the
[1:31:46] pits of hell and seen things and done
[1:31:49] things that you know is plumb just nasty
[1:31:52] you know what i'm saying and you know
[1:31:54] dope what it stands for death or prison
[1:31:56] eventually that was that was the road i
[1:31:58] was on if it wasn't for jesus you know
[1:32:01] and uh
[1:32:02] he kept me all along the way
[1:32:04] uh
[1:32:05] i felt like paul in romans there 7 15
[1:32:08] says
[1:32:09] that which i do i allow not for that i
[1:32:12] would that i do i i do not but what i
[1:32:16] hate that i do you know i'm saying that
[1:32:18] to me when i was in that spot i'm over
[1:32:20] here keep feeding my addiction i'm doing
[1:32:21] what i don't want to do i want to be
[1:32:23] doing right reading and going to church
[1:32:24] doing the right things but i'm not doing
[1:32:26] it that's how i interpret it and you
[1:32:29] know it meant something for me because
[1:32:30] i'm you know that's a scripture hitting
[1:32:32] home for me at that time you know
[1:32:34] uh
[1:32:35] i still did good things you know when
[1:32:38] you're backslidden you know you i still
[1:32:40] had a good heart and wanted to help
[1:32:42] people i made stands for people you know
[1:32:44] i remember times where people was about
[1:32:46] to go rob people and stuff and you know
[1:32:48] i stood up and wouldn't let it happen
[1:32:50] you know who knows what could have
[1:32:51] happened in the middle of getting robbed
[1:32:52] especially knowing you know i'm saying
[1:32:54] you look back like
[1:32:56] wow you know
[1:32:57] but all along that was just god's anchor
[1:32:59] holding me it wasn't me holding him
[1:33:01] i was always running against him you
[1:33:03] know but you you're either serving the
[1:33:05] devil or god our lives our fruits like
[1:33:09] that song you might drink whiskey you
[1:33:11] might drink wine you're gonna serve
[1:33:13] somebody you know every dot every day
[1:33:16] every choice every either for god or the
[1:33:19] devil it's faith or doubt that's the way
[1:33:21] i look at it
[1:33:22] you know
[1:33:23] and i like to back things up with the
[1:33:25] scripture everything that we can read
[1:33:26] and feed and believe it's all right here
[1:33:28] you know that's all we need right here
[1:33:31] you know
[1:33:32] matthew 6 24 says no man can serve two
[1:33:35] masters for either he will hate the one
[1:33:36] love the other or else he will hold to
[1:33:38] the one and despise the other yet you
[1:33:40] cannot serve god and mammon the world or
[1:33:44] the devil
[1:33:45] base based upon your own condition
[1:33:48] convictions that's what's right or wrong
[1:33:50] in your own eyes you know in this word
[1:33:52] if you find it in a word
[1:33:54] uh but praise god for his grace that
[1:33:58] that it never fails us daily and we
[1:34:01] judge ourselves daily as christians you
[1:34:02] know like paul said i must repent daily
[1:34:05] because we're all going to make mistakes
[1:34:07] every day and there's no sin greater
[1:34:08] than the neck so i must repent as he did
[1:34:11] you know
[1:34:13] i got to a real miserable state in life
[1:34:16] i was very violent with everyone
[1:34:18] my wife she wanted to leave me you know
[1:34:21] we can talk about them times now and
[1:34:23] part of her testimony is she just about
[1:34:25] wished i was dead you know she she was
[1:34:27] so sick of me and the way i was and she
[1:34:29] she wanted she wanted out she even
[1:34:32] prayed bad things some of them happened
[1:34:33] and and she still stayed with me what
[1:34:35] was that that was god's mercy and grace
[1:34:37] holding her with me praise god for that
[1:34:40] you know
[1:34:42] i got to a crazy spot there and i was
[1:34:45] going crazy and caleb was actually
[1:34:47] working with me at the time i think
[1:34:48] that's so crazy i mean i was bipolar on
[1:34:51] a whole another level jackal and i you
[1:34:52] never know you're gonna get well i was a
[1:34:54] good guy a good day or a bad day
[1:34:57] uh i could flip a script like that and i
[1:35:00] just end up quitting my job i ask him
[1:35:01] i'm like man would you just go get my
[1:35:03] toes i called dude up here and we're
[1:35:04] always
[1:35:06] doing all our flat
[1:35:09] but anyway
[1:35:10] caleb went picked up my tools for me
[1:35:12] and uh
[1:35:14] that was the end of that up there and
[1:35:17] then i just go full-blown crazy for
[1:35:19] i think it's
[1:35:21] about a year i was running a while
[1:35:23] really no job just doing whatever you
[1:35:25] know
[1:35:26] i've been doing whatever for the dope
[1:35:28] man too
[1:35:29] you know it didn't matter
[1:35:32] and i got to a spot in my life i was so
[1:35:36] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[1:35:38] you know i'll just be praying you know
[1:35:40] i'd be praying god heal me or kill me
[1:35:42] that's just where my prayer got you know
[1:35:43] i was ready to just you know that's bold
[1:35:45] statement you know especially you know
[1:35:47] not being where he's supposed to be what
[1:35:48] if he did kill me you know i've been in
[1:35:50] hell right now but
[1:35:52] it's another saving grace that he saved
[1:35:54] me through that you know but it was it
[1:35:56] was a time there
[1:35:58] that uh i'd get i remember i was so
[1:36:00] hopeless and
[1:36:02] crying i mean i was barely crying this
[1:36:04] is one of the major points in my life i
[1:36:06] remember i was there in the gravel
[1:36:09] crying
[1:36:10] balled up soaking wet crying mad at god
[1:36:13] you could have changed anything you
[1:36:15] could have done anything at any time
[1:36:18] all i wanted to be was a good husband
[1:36:20] and a good dad and you know i'm over
[1:36:22] here
[1:36:22] you know i'm addicted to everything and
[1:36:25] you you name it and i was just so low i
[1:36:28] didn't quit my job pretty much had
[1:36:29] nothing my wife wanted to leave me
[1:36:32] half time i'm telling them to stay at
[1:36:33] her mamas and daddies because
[1:36:35] you know i've done high up i don't need
[1:36:37] to be around i don't want her or my kid
[1:36:38] around me and i'm laying there in the
[1:36:41] driveway just crying
[1:36:43] the bottom of my heart all out and
[1:36:46] something just came over me
[1:36:48] that i didn't have nothing else left but
[1:36:50] hope
[1:36:51] and then i just began to laugh
[1:36:54] and cry and stood up and just praise god
[1:36:57] for that hope that's all i had there and
[1:36:59] it was
[1:37:00] it was something that carried me on
[1:37:02] through through another day you know
[1:37:06] and you know then one day me and uh uh
[1:37:10] me and buddy was working doing tile i'd

[1:40:11] all all the cop cars come flying in
[1:40:13] there and when they came in
[1:40:16] i just end up you know i'm hit now i'm
[1:40:18] laid down and they all on me cop tells
[1:40:21] me he was going to shoot me for sure if
[1:40:22] i got up and even tried to run
[1:40:24] and uh we're talking all the way you
[1:40:26] know and everything else and uh
[1:40:30] i say all that crazy story to show you
[1:40:32] that when i got bailed out and i was
[1:40:34] going through a pre-trial and everything
[1:40:35] i was having to take drug tests they
[1:40:37] were doing everything they
[1:40:38] took me going through the pre-trial
[1:40:40] before my final sense and you know and i
[1:40:42] actually started doing a little bit
[1:40:43] better and uh
[1:40:45] because like i said i'd been struggling
[1:40:46] real bad with drinking and everything
[1:40:48] but with a drug test and everything i'm
[1:40:50] uh
[1:40:52] doing a little bit better and uh
[1:40:54] i'm coming up the final sense and and
[1:40:56] me and her getting this argument that
[1:40:58] day it's like three or four days before
[1:41:00] it and i'm like we're going to my mom's
[1:41:01] and we're over there and then uh
[1:41:06] i get frustrated next thing you know i'm
[1:41:08] going to my butt it's going to walk i'll
[1:41:11] leave i i get out there this is how
[1:41:13] funny i'm tying all this together you'll
[1:41:14] get in a minute but
[1:41:16] when i leave i just crested the hill
[1:41:19] there just below mom and dad's and this
[1:41:21] car comes he's like you can ride on my
[1:41:23] head and then dad ends up coming looking
[1:41:24] for me and uh
[1:41:26] i wasn't there they dropped me off at
[1:41:28] the end of the road i'm walking down the
[1:41:29] road i'm i'm wearing overalls no shoes
[1:41:31] no shirt i'm walking out there i'm just
[1:41:33] like seeing stars you know it's pretty
[1:41:35] nice you know
[1:41:36] and uh
[1:41:38] here comes this cop car i knew a cop car
[1:41:40] sound a million times have i
[1:41:43] got away by even just hearing that sound
[1:41:45] i ain't kidding it got hidden or
[1:41:47] something and uh
[1:41:49] i heard it and i didn't think nothing
[1:41:50] ain't doing nothing wrong he's like yeah
[1:41:52] well we got calls about some guy that
[1:41:54] probably was drunk walking down the road
[1:41:55] he gets me in the car i'm like man i
[1:41:56] could have been driving doing anything
[1:41:58] you just take me i just live right over
[1:41:59] here i was like just take me home he's
[1:42:00] like
[1:42:01] no we're going to take you to jail
[1:42:03] tonight he said you're going to get a pi
[1:42:05] i got all mad at him and start making a
[1:42:07] big deal out of it anyway i ended up
[1:42:09] getting
[1:42:10] terroristic threatening then so the
[1:42:11] terroristic threatening if i hadn't run
[1:42:13] my mouth ought to sign myself out of
[1:42:15] jail next morning for pi but now that i
[1:42:18] have added this charge now i'm now i'm
[1:42:20] going to be in jail for a bit so
[1:42:23] uh
[1:42:25] now what what's happening now now i'm
[1:42:27] fixing to go to my final sentence and uh
[1:42:30] all dressed up in a jumpsuit and uh
[1:42:32] handcuffs so that really looks good to
[1:42:34] your judge that you're coming to try to
[1:42:36] beg for mercy for you know you coming uh
[1:42:38] with some new charges
[1:42:41] but it was a major turning point in my
[1:42:43] life uh
[1:42:45] 10 after got 20 more minutes
[1:42:48] it was a major turning point in my life
[1:42:49] for the first month was it was hard
[1:42:53] but uh
[1:42:55] you know it was hard and i was sick man
[1:42:57] i was it was so hard at first when i was
[1:42:59] in jail i just wanted to be free you
[1:43:00] know it's now
[1:43:02] all the jealousy and controlling that
[1:43:03] i'm talking about now is stripped from
[1:43:05] you you have zero control you can't get
[1:43:07] no drugs you can't get nothing you ain't
[1:43:09] doing nothing and you just
[1:43:12] you know it's a whole other level of uh
[1:43:13] humbling
[1:43:14] and uh
[1:43:16] you just want to be free you know i mean
[1:43:18] not to look at the sun and the moon you
[1:43:19] know when we'd be doing stuff and it
[1:43:21] just makes me sick i want to be free
[1:43:23] but i hit a point where this guy you
[1:43:25] know he speaks
[1:43:26] mysterious ways but this guy i just
[1:43:28] actually heard him saying over here he's
[1:43:29] like you know someone lives and fair
[1:43:31] tries to control everyone around them
[1:43:33] and uh i thought uh
[1:43:37] you know that just kind of hit home at
[1:43:38] me i'm like
[1:43:39] i guess that's right you know what i'm
[1:43:41] saying and but i remember rolling over
[1:43:43] one night rolling over in my bed crying
[1:43:46] barely crying i had to kind of cover
[1:43:47] myself up because you didn't look like
[1:43:48] no punk in jail you know what i'm saying
[1:43:50] and uh i'm laying her crying and the
[1:43:53] same thing i'm like you could have
[1:43:54] changed me you could have done anything
[1:43:56] at any time
[1:43:57] and
[1:43:59] basically at the end of it said so now
[1:44:01] you're blaming god
[1:44:02] and then it hit me and i just started
[1:44:03] crying i'm sorry i'm sorry lord it's all
[1:44:06] my fault i did it it's my fault
[1:44:08] and
[1:44:09] we made it through that night and the
[1:44:10] next morning i ain't getting you open a
[1:44:12] bible oh i was needing something from
[1:44:14] god this is where we start really
[1:44:16] turning i needed something from god and
[1:44:19] i turn the page
[1:44:20] open it up it's uh
[1:44:23] my grace is sufficient for thee for my
[1:44:25] strength isn't
[1:44:26] my
[1:44:27] grace is first
[1:44:29] my grace is sufficient for thee
[1:44:30] therefore
[1:44:31] uh what do you say here i'm getting all
[1:44:33] confused and
[1:44:35] embarrassed up here now
[1:44:36] i feel like i'm sorry for holding on so
[1:44:38] long
[1:44:43] i'm gonna get to the meat and potatoes
[1:44:44] here shortly
[1:44:47] uh my grace is sufficient for thee my
[1:44:49] strength is made perfect and weakness
[1:44:51] yeah therefore
[1:44:52] most gladly therefore i will rather
[1:44:54] glory in my harmonies that the power of
[1:44:56] christ may rest upon me you know and
[1:44:58] then i
[1:44:59] i know that i know it by heart but i
[1:45:00] just couldn't say it right now i've
[1:45:01] choked up but then then i flipped again
[1:45:04] and when i flipped again it landed on
[1:45:05] the scripture john 4 18 said there's no
[1:45:08] fear and perfect love for perfect love
[1:45:09] casts without fear remember i just told
[1:45:11] you he's dealing with me on fear already
[1:45:13] you know and it was like that night i
[1:45:16] was laying there and or the day i was he
[1:45:18] was dealing with me with what he said
[1:45:20] and then i was thinking on my life i
[1:45:22] thought i was always you know just no
[1:45:24] fear you know
[1:45:27] i mean i had got a stupid tattoo one
[1:45:29] time and put that on my body
[1:45:31] thinking that
[1:45:33] you know i had no fear but he started
[1:45:35] dealing with me and giving me the
[1:45:37] revelation that all along
[1:45:39] i had fear all along i had more fear of
[1:45:42] like if it was to fight someone it
[1:45:43] didn't matter i'd bite you i had more
[1:45:45] fear looking like a pump than i did
[1:45:48] of getting whooped you know what i'm
[1:45:49] saying so i took that fear and i'd
[1:45:51] rather just fight you and then sit here
[1:45:53] and get whooped you know and it was like
[1:45:55] he gave me a revelation of that that all
[1:45:56] along i had fear you know it was just a
[1:45:58] different way
[1:46:00] uh
[1:46:02] you could probably switch to that other
[1:46:03] picture back here it'd probably be
[1:46:04] better for you than
[1:46:06] my ugly face upper
[1:46:07] i see it back there now
[1:46:10] uh
[1:46:14] but anyway yeah that day i got a
[1:46:15] breakthrough
[1:46:17] and i mean i was writing scripture down
[1:46:19] and i was reading and feeding all the
[1:46:20] time these guys was like man if you lift
[1:46:22] with weights as much as you read that
[1:46:23] bible and i'm like nah i i just kept on
[1:46:26] reading this bible i was right every
[1:46:27] time i got verse i liked i'd write it
[1:46:29] down i had a notebook full of pages of
[1:46:31] just notes and everything i said but my
[1:46:33] doc my desire had been changed i no
[1:46:35] longer was jealous anymore i knew god
[1:46:38] had done work that day that night when i
[1:46:40] confessed to him that it was my fault
[1:46:42] now i'm accepting my responsibilities i
[1:46:44] played the blame game on my wife my my
[1:46:46] family my everybody around me my friend
[1:46:49] when there was nobody else to blame i
[1:46:50] was blaming god but then when i accepted
[1:46:52] my responsibility that it was my fault
[1:46:55] something happened right there and i
[1:46:57] ain't been i ain't been the same since
[1:46:59] then he set me free from drugs and
[1:47:01] alcohol and addiction and uh april 29th
[1:47:04] i'll have 11 years free from those drugs
[1:47:06] and alcohol and that lifestyle and he
[1:47:09] delivered me from jealous and temper and
[1:47:12] many more but
[1:47:13] you know
[1:47:15] uh
[1:47:16] well time was still hardy even though i
[1:47:18] had a break
[1:47:20] through you know i was just wanting to
[1:47:21] get out and you couldn't wait to get out
[1:47:23] everybody said told my wife people like
[1:47:25] me don't change you know and you know
[1:47:27] something doesn't happen in here now
[1:47:28] you're trying to convince her she was
[1:47:29] barely hanging on by a thread
[1:47:31] this is my last chance with her she was
[1:47:33] done
[1:47:34] and uh she done told me this is it and
[1:47:36] uh
[1:47:38] uh
[1:47:40] but
[1:47:41] god had done you know and i noticed a
[1:47:42] significant change in me
[1:47:44] first times ever i remember on the
[1:47:46] inside you know something happened
[1:47:49] there was this guy there
[1:47:51] he was from hazard we lifted weights and
[1:47:52] stuff together and you always hear
[1:47:54] stories about these guys from hazard
[1:47:55] they're bad guys you know blah blah blah
[1:47:58] he he like picking around with people
[1:48:00] but you know
[1:48:01] he's
[1:48:03] he'd be one of them guys to be ready to
[1:48:04] throw down any second you know and uh
[1:48:07] he kept messing with my chair and i'm
[1:48:08] like sitting there cuz like a
[1:48:10] i said i i just soon get up and we'll
[1:48:13] fight about it whatever but i was
[1:48:14] sitting there and i remember thinking oh
[1:48:16] lord just help me i don't want to fight
[1:48:18] i don't want to get no more trouble
[1:48:20] cause i you know been in all kinds of
[1:48:21] trouble i'm sitting there and he's
[1:48:23] helping me and this dude kicks my chair
[1:48:25] again
[1:48:26] i look back and i'm like don't you kick
[1:48:28] my chair again we're in here he's
[1:48:30] actually in church because where he's
[1:48:31] kicking my chair i said we're in here
[1:48:32] supposed to be worshipping god
[1:48:34] kid you're not he never touched my chair
[1:48:36] again never said anything out of the way
[1:48:37] to me again that was god coming on scene
[1:48:39] showing me that he was there with me
[1:48:41] that he would take care of it for me
[1:48:44] and you know i remember uh i was in drug
[1:48:47] court they and they i ended up getting
[1:48:49] shocked out going through a drug court
[1:48:50] program and uh
[1:48:52] uh
[1:48:53] when i was going through all that i had
[1:48:54] to go through it and that's 78 fail rate
[1:48:57] when i was going through that but you
[1:48:58] know praise god uh wait wait
[1:49:01] we completed all that it was 18 months
[1:49:03] and they changed it to 24 months you
[1:49:05] know and i've seen i've seen the fail
[1:49:08] rate i've seen all them i mean there's
[1:49:09] dudes in there offering me meth and
[1:49:11] everything else when i was in there
[1:49:13] uh
[1:49:14] you know it was
[1:49:16] anyway
[1:49:17] but
[1:49:18] you know and then
[1:49:21] i was i was proving
[1:49:23] god's word
[1:49:24] it's humbling me and you know god has a
[1:49:26] sense of humor too because i'm a big
[1:49:28] motorcycle rider and uh now i don't want
[1:49:30] to be such a burden on my wife i want to
[1:49:32] do better i wound up i have to get this
[1:49:34] moped because now i got no driver's
[1:49:36] license and uh
[1:49:38] i thought you know i'm riding the moped
[1:49:40] now i feel like i said this is what the
[1:49:42] mennonites feel like you know when
[1:49:43] they're riding horse and buggy i'm going
[1:49:44] slow and everything and uh
[1:49:47] but you know it's really funny story i
[1:49:48] won't forget either be careful what you
[1:49:50] say because i was sitting there drug
[1:49:52] court one night everybody's leaving you
[1:49:54] know and i'm a nice guy everybody i'm
[1:49:55] like uh this guy he's like man my riding
[1:49:58] i'm like
[1:50:00] i said well i mean if you really need to
[1:50:02] i can give you a ride
[1:50:03] oh yeah yeah nope yeah i don't arrive
[1:50:05] like oh my gosh man i'm right now i got
[1:50:08] this guy on the back of my mom i'm like
[1:50:10] put your hands back there and where you
[1:50:12] live at and where we're going he lived
[1:50:14] of course i had to go straight to the
[1:50:15] middle of town the other side i'm like
[1:50:17] oh my god god has a sense of humor you
[1:50:19] know
[1:50:20] then uh
[1:50:23] i won't forget either too when i was
[1:50:24] sitting there uh glorifying the lord in
[1:50:27] these meetings and stuff you know and
[1:50:28] i'm in there praising god and stuff and
[1:50:30] then you know
[1:50:31] meetings i had to go to all i mean
[1:50:33] losers having to do three and four a
[1:50:34] week
[1:50:35] and uh
[1:50:36] mandatory plus all the other classes and
[1:50:40] wound up having to do ged classes and
[1:50:42] everything else and uh i wound up
[1:50:44] getting my ged too
[1:50:46] and uh
[1:50:47] but uh
[1:50:49] i remember yeah i had a guy come to me
[1:50:51] and tell me that uh
[1:50:53] uh you know
[1:50:55] n-a-n-a-a we're not going to church just
[1:50:57] like when i go to church
[1:50:59] and i i'm not going to bring my naa
[1:51:01] books there i'm high
[1:51:03] because see they want to say that you
[1:51:04] know
[1:51:05] that's their higher power but you know
[1:51:06] that ain't my higher power my iron parts
[1:51:08] jesus christ want to set me free and i'm
[1:51:10] gonna glorify him you know so i'll be
[1:51:13] talking about him they ain't like that
[1:51:14] you know funny thing is that i was out
[1:51:16] there too one time i heard a guy where i
[1:51:17] heard these guys are the leaders that i
[1:51:19] was actually man you're talking full of
[1:51:21] knowledge you know you're like man they
[1:51:22] got it going on you know and then i i
[1:51:24] was just over here doing something was
[1:51:26] waiting on class and he's dropping kind
[1:51:28] of you know you just heard them talking
[1:51:29] and i'm like my goodness see that's what
[1:51:31] we're following and they was talking all
[1:51:33] kinds of nasty stuff and i'm like this
[1:51:35] is what we gotta listen to the leaders
[1:51:37] you know what i mean you know because
[1:51:38] you know coming from you know you want
[1:51:40] the good lord's advice not some of my
[1:51:42] hand because then over here you know
[1:51:44] they don't even know that's pretty
[1:51:46] hypocritical and anyway all them guys
[1:51:48] they all wind up
[1:51:50] backslidden
[1:51:52] and back strung out and
[1:51:55] some of them was already older at that
[1:51:56] time
[1:51:57] but you know
[1:51:58] and a few more stories here and i'm
[1:52:01] gonna be getting through here shortly uh
[1:52:04] uh you know i remember too you know just
[1:52:07] like the the drug court and fighting
[1:52:09] thing you know uh
[1:52:11] when you move over and you go to jail or
[1:52:12] you go to a new town you know you got no
[1:52:14] reputation people around your town where
[1:52:16] you're from they know you they know your
[1:52:18] character how you are fighting
[1:52:19] everything else you go there you know
[1:52:20] you got to start all the way over you
[1:52:22] know people don't know you and so you
[1:52:24] kind of feel like you know people
[1:52:25] mistake your kindness for weakness you
[1:52:27] know and uh
[1:52:29] i had multiple times the same thing that
[1:52:31] happened to me in jail
[1:52:34] a couple times
[1:52:35] that i went home there wasn't like no
[1:52:38] confrontation but it was things that was
[1:52:40] really getting to me and i was fixing
[1:52:42] explode prayed about it and i said if it
[1:52:44] happens again tomorrow
[1:52:46] i'm sorry lord i'll be thrown down and
[1:52:49] that they don't ever happen again
[1:52:52] you know before i tuck it compulsively
[1:52:54] and wound up you know in trouble but
[1:52:56] that was god for me that was meant
[1:52:58] something because like i said that's why
[1:52:59] i like the foundation of the stuff that
[1:53:01] i've done all my life and how it was he
[1:53:03] come in and changed that you see and
[1:53:05] that he can do whatever you need help
[1:53:07] with the lord can help you with
[1:53:12] i said here i'm so blessed to have my
[1:53:14] wife and
[1:53:16] you know we could go on for testimonies
[1:53:18] for days for her too she she don't like
[1:53:20] when i talk about her she won't leave
[1:53:22] that all the way up but
[1:53:23] uh
[1:53:25] you know i love her and bless your heart
[1:53:27] and
[1:53:28] uh
[1:53:30] so you know uh yeah
[1:53:32] so i go on for years now that i'm out
[1:53:34] and all that you know we get through all
[1:53:36] that but you know it's easy to grow
[1:53:38] stagnant complacent with god you know uh
[1:53:42] you just get to a spot you know we've
[1:53:44] all been there surely if not be praying
[1:53:47] for me but uh
[1:53:49] i won't forget this is a good good time
[1:53:52] right here was uh
[1:53:53] i struggled with cigarette smoking for
[1:53:55] 19 years i was sitting either where mama
[1:53:57] is or tammy is right now
[1:53:59] and uh i've been struggling i've been

[1:57:27] time i never really paid a whole lot of
[1:57:29] attention it was like down to like 38

[1:57:38] remember talking about martha and them
[1:57:40] uh
[1:57:41] uh
[1:57:42] their thing when they have them on the
[1:57:44] cover and they're like oh yeah you don't
[1:57:45] come back from it when it gets this low
[1:57:47] without getting on the machine and i was
[1:57:48] lowering that i'm thinking oh god
[1:57:51] you know i'm panicking you know and uh i
[1:57:53] just i was i was laying there in the
[1:57:55] dark and i was crying you know crying
[1:57:57] out to god because i felt like i was
[1:57:59] gonna die and uh i didn't want to sit
[1:58:01] there and dive up for ten thousand feet
[1:58:03] and my wife had to find me and uh
[1:58:06] anyway made it through the night
[1:58:09] and uh i don't know if this has anything
[1:58:11] to do with anything but i had to eat
[1:58:12] these berries and we just tied the two
[1:58:14] things together later on this may or may
[1:58:16] not had nothing to do with it i don't
[1:58:17] know i'd eat these berries like soft
[1:58:19] side roast man there's some good looking
[1:58:21] blueberries i got either the bitterest
[1:58:23] blueberries you ever eat and uh i had
[1:58:25] taken uh at the time i was taking a
[1:58:28] couple uh melatonin pills you get from
[1:58:30] walmart and uh
[1:58:32] it's like what was the next day or
[1:58:33] something i was walking up the mountain
[1:58:36] i'm walking up the mountain and here
[1:58:37] here comes uh some little berries here
[1:58:39] i'm like i'll take them up you know
[1:58:41] because after all this you look back you
[1:58:42] ain't supposed to just eat wild berries
[1:58:44] up here in colorado and uh i eat this
[1:58:46] berry and the uh
[1:58:49] that night it happens again and always
[1:58:51] skip tonight that's what it was it
[1:58:52] skipped tonight and because i was good
[1:58:54] the next time because the first night i
[1:58:55] think well maybe i was just acclimating
[1:58:57] too well the next night was good then
[1:59:00] third night it happens to me again as
[1:59:02] i'm laying there and it's happening to
[1:59:03] me again i feel like i'm about to die
[1:59:04] and i'm losing all my breath and like my
[1:59:06] heart feels like dude it's like coming
[1:59:07] down like zero beating hardly feels like
[1:59:10] uh i start tying all these together i'm
[1:59:12] like i did that and did that that's the
[1:59:13] only thing is the same i'm like and i'm
[1:59:15] googling and all this and you see
[1:59:16] something wild berries can cause like
[1:59:18] respiratory problems and things like
[1:59:19] that i'm like oh my gosh but anyway i
[1:59:22] was going to come back and share that
[1:59:23] testimony that was another testimony of
[1:59:25] god keeping me
[1:59:26] and then i got all nervous and scared
[1:59:29] and put it off and procrastinated end up
[1:59:31] not ever doing that but you know
[1:59:33] in romans 8 28 here he said all things
[1:59:35] work together for the good of them
[1:59:36] they're called
[1:59:38] that are called to them according
[1:59:43] who are they called according to his
[1:59:45] purpose you know
[1:59:46] and uh
[1:59:48] uh
[1:59:50] i had this here
[1:59:55] oh yeah anybody can get up and leave any
[1:59:56] time too you ain't gonna hurt my
[1:59:58] feelings i understand
[2:00:05] it's just a lit learning experience i'm
[2:00:07] giving a testimony either your life
[2:00:09] story or maybe just share some
[2:00:10] testimonies
[2:00:14] and
[2:00:15] when the says looking at the unseen when
[2:00:17] the great crisis come which always does
[2:00:20] when the uh
[2:00:22] of giza was being just a lukewarm church
[2:00:25] render member when he had not seen what
[2:00:28] elijah had seen because he was walking
[2:00:32] walking by faith he was looking at the
[2:00:34] unseen all the time you know
[2:00:36] uh
[2:00:40] sorry about that wrong
[2:00:44] oh i think of david in the writings of
[2:00:46] psalms when muslim
[2:00:48] industry
[2:00:49] takes
[2:00:50] takes distress to bring the best out of
[2:00:52] a man it's really that's when god gets
[2:00:55] down to when we fast many times to get
[2:00:58] ourselves in position to get ourselves
[2:01:00] out of the way and i think when david
[2:01:03] and these
[2:01:04] in this place then he began to meditate
[2:01:06] on the lord he began to think about
[2:01:08] things many times god gets us in in a
[2:01:11] tight corner where we have to look up
[2:01:13] sometimes even he has to get us on our
[2:01:16] back or in the hospital or our bed
[2:01:18] somewhere
[2:01:19] we can't so we can look up to see the
[2:01:21] great blessings of god
[2:01:24] you know it means a lot to me when you
[2:01:26] just come from laying up in the hospital
[2:01:28] for a while you know
[2:01:29] uh
[2:01:30] these this right here this is
[2:01:32] just the other day when i was
[2:01:34] asking the lord about something and he
[2:01:36] shows me this right on time it's like
[2:01:38] god knows how to use things got a couple
[2:01:40] devotionals i read and stuff and he you
[2:01:42] know he'll get
[2:01:44] you know
[2:01:45] uh
[2:01:47] one night me and lyric had been lifting

[2:02:00] came back really hard i mean just felt
[2:02:03] like you had my heart like it and then
[2:02:04] it got super hot then it felt like you

[2:02:08] just doing that right there i mean
[2:02:10] excruciating pain like i can't describe

[2:08:28] gone everything i was gonna do with my
[2:08:30] wife all the things we were gonna do in
[2:08:33] our future god
[2:08:36] when you're faced with that
[2:08:42] i can't do nothing
[2:08:45] i'm laying there
[2:08:46] around by myself
[2:08:48] because nobody could be there at night
[2:08:51] you're all in your head you know you
[2:08:53] can't even get out of bed you get a pee
[2:08:54] in a urinal thing or whatever
[2:08:57] and uh
[2:09:10] i am i'm gonna do faster
[2:09:18] but it was just just overwhelming
[2:09:21] uh
[2:09:23] what
[2:09:25] is happening you know and then you know
[2:09:27] you say something to your wife and she
[2:09:30] don't really
[2:09:31] you know show a lot of motion too
[2:09:33] sometime you know she'd cry
[2:09:37] you know
[2:09:38] i couldn't see nothing but doom and
[2:09:39] gloom
[2:09:40] you know all i could i couldn't see no
[2:09:42] beauty of the forest for the trees in my
[2:09:44] way you know
[2:09:45] and i i thought
[2:09:47] literally couldn't be any worse to me at
[2:09:49] that time they just told me i mean
[2:09:51] because i can't heal can't do nothing i
[2:09:53] can't
[2:09:54] what am i nothing you know i mean
[2:09:57] i was thinking everything like i mean
[2:09:58] cancer this and that i'm like this is
[2:10:00] worse than everything literally that was
[2:10:02] where my mind was
[2:10:04] and uh
[2:10:05] it was just devastating to me you know
[2:10:08] uh
[2:10:09] it was just gone you know
[2:10:16] he said you can't do nothing none of
[2:10:18] that because you'll die it's that
[2:10:19] serious if you do anything it ruptures
[2:10:21] on you you're gonna die out immediately
[2:10:24] you know and you're just like why don't
[2:10:25] we just do the surgery why don't we just
[2:10:28] do surgery anyway he said no there's so
[2:10:31] many complications with the surgery that
[2:10:33] uh it's too high of a risk unless you
[2:10:35] absolutely need it and
[2:10:37] so then you know
[2:10:38] thinking all this and that and
[2:10:41] uh
[2:10:43] you would think you know normal thoughts
[2:10:44] you know if you get pain or something
[2:10:46] you just you know you might have to
[2:10:47] tough it out through somebody you know
[2:10:48] what i'm saying you just cowboy up with
[2:10:50] this they're like no don't tough it out
[2:10:52] take it easy you're like oh my word but
[2:10:54] uh and so keep in mind i had days that i
[2:10:58] was just depressing in a dark place you
[2:10:59] know i got to such a dark place
[2:11:02] that uh
[2:11:05] i couldn't just start thinking about
[2:11:06] anything but just uh ending it all and
[2:11:10] just be done with it
[2:11:12] and uh
[2:11:15] i
[2:11:19] hadn't called nobody at that time really
[2:11:22] and uh i called
[2:11:24] talking to him
[2:11:26] and we was talking
[2:11:28] you know i mean i just was just
[2:11:30] depressed anyway i didn't even want to
[2:11:32] talk about but just something i just led
[2:11:34] to call him and you know we're talking
[2:11:37] and we just began to keep talking and
[2:11:38] joe old encourager started encouraging
[2:11:41] me and everything
[2:11:42] next thing you know he's encouraging me
[2:11:44] that you know
[2:11:45] that's a miracle and everything he
[2:11:47] started believing yeah yep
[2:11:49] amen i am a miracle and it's like why am

[2:11:54] the way there he saved me uh here from
[2:11:57] having to have the surgery save me there
[2:11:58] if he done all that why can't he heal me
[2:12:00] right up it says by his word by stripes
[2:12:02] i'm healed then you start receiving that
[2:12:05] you start getting them seeds you start
[2:12:06] watering them they start taking root you
[2:12:08] know you start
[2:12:09] feeding on them and then you start you
[2:12:11] start it's a fight or flight now we're
[2:12:13] starting to fight back starting to you
[2:12:15] know
[2:12:16] shaking devils off you know i'm starting
[2:12:18] to see some hope at the end of the
[2:12:19] tunnel you know
[2:12:20] and you know i'd been i started began to
[2:12:22] ponder on the lord
[2:12:24] and telling him how sorry i was that i
[2:12:26] didn't get up here lord and praised your
[2:12:28] name and gave you more glory for all
[2:12:29] that you've done and try to live in fear
[2:12:31] and be scared to do it
[2:12:33] and now i'm sorry i'm dragging it all
[2:12:34] out for y'all but uh here we are and
[2:12:37] you know he said me do a lot of things
[2:12:39] you know it
[2:12:40] it
[2:12:41] it's just wow all the things he brought
[2:12:43] me through brought me over
[2:12:49] but all through this life he's been
[2:12:51] building my faith lifting my faith and
[2:12:53] getting me through the things
[2:12:55] that uh
[2:12:57] uh
[2:12:58] you know
[2:12:59] that all you know
[2:13:01] all i know is his word to be the truth
[2:13:03] you know you read the scriptures when
[2:13:04] you're by stripes i'm healed you think
[2:13:07] all this and you start thinking on
[2:13:08] things like godliness with contentment's
[2:13:10] great gain i should have been more
[2:13:11] content with where
[2:13:13] what i had in him you know instead of
[2:13:15] always wanting more all this and that or
[2:13:16] not giving him the time be more in
[2:13:19] christ jesus you know
[2:13:21] and greater is he that
[2:13:22] lives within me that
[2:13:24] he that is in this world you know jesus
[2:13:26] came and paid the price for my healing
[2:13:28] on calvary you know uh hezekiah's
[2:13:31] prayers he said change the mind of god i
[2:13:33] began to pray because i told both time i
[2:13:35] was like man or i think i did i was i
[2:13:37] felt like i was in the state of limbo
[2:13:39] like you know you believe you're healed
[2:13:41] but then you're like all at the same
[2:13:42] time you're like you know sometimes god
[2:13:43] test people to see how they react you
[2:13:45] know if that picture don't come back
[2:13:46] when i go to my uh
[2:13:51] checkup you wanted to come back like oh
[2:13:53] there was never a tear there you know
[2:13:54] there's never a tear there you want that
[2:13:56] you know and it's like well if it don't
[2:13:58] come back that so i just started praying
[2:14:00] god it'd be make it your perfect will
[2:14:01] that i be healed if it wasn't your
[2:14:03] perfect will start start changing that
[2:14:05] start believing in a different way
[2:14:06] instead of being like well what if it
[2:14:07] wasn't so then i started doing that
[2:14:09] start believing that and start you know
[2:14:11] believing his word here and his word
[2:14:14] says
[2:14:15] by his stripes i am healed and it was
[2:14:17] that simple it's that's very simple you
[2:14:20] know and i said romans 10 17 says then
[2:14:23] faith cometh by hearing by the word
[2:14:26] psalms 38 15 for in thee oh lord do i

[2:14:53] pondering on them day in and day out you
[2:14:55] know
[2:14:56] uh
[2:14:57] you know i changed my focus changed my
[2:14:59] focus started really focusing getting
[2:15:01] off my phone worthlessness any tv shows

[2:15:05] believing you know it's a white dog
[2:15:07] black dog fight you know i love that
[2:15:08] story the white dog the black dog is a
[2:15:10] simple story you know the little indian

[2:15:40] whatever it was that ever make it she
[2:15:42] said and it made harry on my arm stand
[2:15:44] up and hurt through he said
[2:15:45] uh you're the third person i've seen
[2:15:47] making y'all don't know how many people
[2:15:48] i've witnessed to and told them my story
[2:15:50] and they said my grandma died from that
[2:15:51] so and so died from that so-and-so
[2:15:52] definitely you're like wow you know i

[2:16:12] i come in here and tell you that it is
[2:16:14] healed even though whatever that doctor
[2:16:16] can't see we already know so if it ain't
[2:16:18] healed then it's my fault if it's my
[2:16:19] fault then i didn't have the faith so
[2:16:21] god grant me the faith and help my
[2:16:23] unbelief and every little bit of faith i
[2:16:24] get stitches it back up until i made
[2:16:26] whole because you know i only hold back
[2:16:30] what he's already done you know
[2:16:33] the bible says he's the high priest of
[2:16:34] our confession i believe i believe
[2:16:37] uh 100 percent his word to be the truth
[2:16:39] and if it is by stripes i'm healed then
[2:16:41] i got the revelation of it laying there

[2:16:55] i said i just started laughing i said
[2:16:57] well that's the devil on one hand god on
[2:16:59] the right i said ultimately lord you
[2:17:00] paid the price calvary some peace comes
[2:17:03] over me i believe i was healed i didn't
[2:17:05] care what doctor had to say we went on
[2:17:07] went on believing and you know

[2:17:12] doctor says a great physician that said
[2:17:14] what it is it's healed
[2:17:15] so you know
[2:17:17] uh

[2:17:32] started coming
[2:17:33] on his breaks kicking it with me hanging
[2:17:35] out and talking and fellowshipping with
[2:17:37] me and uh he said something he'd been
[2:17:40] seeing my oxygen levels how they were he
[2:17:41] was like have you ever been checking for
[2:17:42] sleep apnea i'm like nah he's like you

[2:17:45] and i'm like dude we ain't even gonna go
[2:17:47] there you know what i'm saying we ain't
[2:17:48] gonna talk about that frustrating and
[2:17:50] he's like there that i had the same
[2:17:52] problem blah blah blah he said i got
[2:17:54] that machine i don't have to do it no
[2:17:55] more you know and
[2:17:57] i tell you that to tell you this that uh
[2:18:01] after i came back home
[2:18:03] uh
[2:18:05] i was having the same problem using the
[2:18:07] restroom i mean y'all wouldn't believe
[2:18:08] six seven eight ten times a night just
[2:18:10] so aggravating uh
[2:18:13] and uh i said
[2:18:15] it came to me that same lord that you're
[2:18:18] believing to heal your aorta you don't
[2:18:19] believe he can heal you of this i said i
[2:18:21] do
[2:18:22] and i've been normal for two weeks now
[2:18:25] [Applause]

[2:18:31] he said uh
[2:18:33] uh i'll be with you even in you to end
[2:18:35] the world
[2:18:36] uh john 5 000 says search the scriptures
[2:18:41] search the scriptures for in them you
[2:18:42] think
[2:18:44] there they wish they testified me
[2:18:46] i said uh you know this terror has been
[2:18:48] a blessing you know it's drawn me closer
[2:18:50] to god got me focused back on him
[2:18:52] so he's rekindled the fire the little
[2:18:54] look of fire i have and i said years ago
[2:18:56] i wanted to go and be a helping
[2:18:59] encouragement burn victims and go to
[2:19:00] jails and rehabs outreach be a witness
[2:19:02] of the gospel and i say to you today uh
[2:19:06] i thought even deeper on it after that
[2:19:08] message that one day and i had been
[2:19:10] thinking on it i ask you today what is
[2:19:12] the gospel to you
[2:19:13] you know you can think on that a second
[2:19:15] what is the gospel to you
[2:19:17] you know christ paid for our sins our
[2:19:19] healing our deliverance on calvary
[2:19:22] in john 3 16 there he said god so loved
[2:19:25] the world that he gave his only begotten
[2:19:26] son whoever shall believe in him should
[2:19:28] not perish but have everlasting life
[2:19:31] the scriptures also say you must be born
[2:19:33] again ezekiel 3 36 26 a new heart also
[2:19:37] will i give you and a new spirit will i
[2:19:39] put in you within you and i will take
[2:19:41] away the old stony heart and put a heart
[2:19:44] of flesh and will give you a new heart
[2:19:46] flesh
[2:19:47] acts 2 38 says repent be baptized every
[2:19:49] one of you names jesus christ for
[2:19:51] permission your sins you shall receive a
[2:19:53] holy ghost
[2:19:54] that
[2:19:55] is the simple good news it's not an
[2:19:58] intellectual all worked up
[2:20:01] hand-me-down religion it's not a painted
[2:20:03] fire on the wall
[2:20:05] it's a real holy ghost fire experience
[2:20:07] that'll change your life then by faith
[2:20:09] you can go on believing every word
[2:20:11] to be the truth you can live me a sermon
