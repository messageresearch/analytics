[24:32] now because you

[38:15] [Music]
[38:19] In search of many answers that my
[38:23] troubled soul just couldn't seem to
[38:26] find.
[38:32] I saw a flower blooming where there was
[38:37] no rain or sunine.
[38:45] And I knew not that this flower would
[38:49] change the rest of my life.
[38:56] I found a liar in my valley.
[39:03] I found strength. When I was born,
[39:09] I found a place to leave my burdens.
[39:15] I found a refuge from the storm.
[39:22] A place to drain my
[39:27] dark. Two beaming rays of sunshine.
[39:34] I found a lily in my valley
[39:41] and he blooms all the time.
[39:48] So if you're down and
[39:51] brokenarted and you just can't seem to
[39:54] find peace of mind,
[39:58] [Music]
[40:02] you're searching for your answers, but
[40:05] your problems are getting worse all the
[40:08] time.
[40:14] Just reach your hands to Jesus. He'll
[40:18] take you and break the ties and mine.
[40:23] [Music]
[40:26] He'll be your lily in your
[40:30] valley. You can watch him bloom all the
[40:34] time.
[40:37] He'll be your lady in your valley.
[40:44] He'll be strength when you're warm.
[40:48] [Music]
[40:50] He'll be the place to leave your burden.
[40:56] He'll give you refuge from the storm.
[41:03] A place to trade your dark
[41:08] skies to beaming rays of sunshine.
[41:15] He'll be your lily in your valley
[41:20] [Music]
[41:22] and he'll bloom all the time.
[41:28] I found a lily in my valley.
[41:35] I found strength when I was warm.
[41:41] I found a place to lead my burden.
[41:47] I found a refuge from the storm.
[41:54] A place to trade my dark
[41:59] skies to beaming rays of sunshine.

[43:25] valley. I'll praise on the
[43:31] mountain. I'll praise when I'm
[43:35] sure. And praise when I'm doubting.
[43:43] Praise when

[44:55] control. Praise is a
[44:58] weapon and it's more than a sound.
[45:06] My praise is a
[45:09] shout that brings
[45:12] Jericho
[45:17] down. As long as I'm
[45:20] breathing, I've got a reason to
[45:28] praise the Lord.

[48:11] Let's stand tonight if we could and pray
[48:13] the song service been a blessing to you
[48:15] and just so good to be in the presence
[48:17] of the Lord tonight. And let's sing that
[48:20] little chorus as brother Brad comes
[48:21] tonight. In the presence of Jehovah
[48:23] tonight if we could, Sister Becky. How
[48:26] many believe we're in the presence of
[48:27] Jehovah tonight?

[50:13] being in the presence of the King, our
[50:15] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. What a
[50:17] presence is here tonight, felt amongst
[50:19] us. And we just felt the strong presence
[50:21] in the study. And so I knew stepping out
[50:24] here it was going to be even stronger.
[50:25] So it's good to be in the house of the
[50:27] Lord tonight. And let's just bow our
[50:29] heads if we could go to the Lord in
[50:30] prayer. Heavenly Father, we just thank
[50:32] you, Lord, for the day, for the time
[50:34] that you've given us to set aside just
[50:36] to come and worship you tonight. And
[50:38] Lord, just to hear what you'd have in
[50:40] store for us, Lord, knowing that we are
[50:42] needy people tonight, Lord Jesus. And
[50:45] our greatest need is for more of you,
[50:47] Lord. We just want to stay in your
[50:48] presence, to bask in your presence,
[50:50] Lord. That you would just fill us with
[50:52] more of the Holy Ghost. Father, give us
[50:54] the courage and the strength to fight
[50:56] and to be able to be warriors for you,
[50:58] Father. That we would be able to
[51:00] withstand all the ws and the wickedness
[51:02] of this age that we live in. Father,
[51:04] Lord, we just want to tell you how much
[51:05] we love you tonight. We pray for those
[51:07] that couldn't be here tonight, Lord. And
[51:09] we pray that you would just come in our
[51:11] midst and move throughout the
[51:13] congregation tonight, Lord. That you
[51:14] would just step into the to this vessel
[51:17] that that has been set aside for you
[51:19] tonight, Lord Jesus. That you would just
[51:21] use my lips to speak to the ears of the
[51:24] hearers and that it would sink down into
[51:25] the hearts, Lord, that we may grow you
[51:27] and to know you in a greater way. In
[51:30] Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Good to
[51:33] be in the house of the Lord. Just a
[51:35] little different setting tonight. I was
[51:37] looking around. We got some that's not
[51:38] here. Brother Bo, good to see you. Good
[51:40] to see you. And have Becca and Katie

[51:46] And so, man, I tell you what, there's
[51:48] some there's some working working little
[51:51] ladies there. So, we're certainly
[51:52] thankful to have them helping us on the
[51:54] farm. And they've really put their put
[51:56] their shoulder to the wheel, so to
[51:58] speak.
[51:59] So, over here, they've been helping,
[52:01] too. So, Paul and Daniel, we don't want
[52:03] to leave you out. they've uh they've
[52:04] pitched in. I've had them for two days,
[52:06] them for one, and and uh it it's been a
[52:09] pretty good pretty good week so far. So,
[52:11] just uh want to get right into the word
[52:14] if you want to turn into your Bibles.
[52:15] And we'll we'll be turning into the book
[52:17] of Jude and it's one one book there
[52:20] right before Revelations. And it's just
[52:22] one one chapter. And I'm also want to
[52:24] turn in if you want to hold your place
[52:26] in Psalms 35.
[52:28] Now, we've been as I'm looking at this
[52:30] here and and I'm trying to uh see how to
[52:32] put this together tonight. And you know,
[52:34] my thoughts are we just come out of
[52:36] great meetings and the the the I don't
[52:39] want to say the fear. It's not the right
[52:40] word probably, but just to give you an
[52:42] illustration, but is that we will begin
[52:45] to let things become common. But I don't
[52:47] want to be there. I want to be to where
[52:48] we keep the fire burning. I want to be
[52:50] into a place that we keep moving forward
[52:52] in Christ. that we keep putting putting
[52:54] more to the to the to the grindstoneone
[52:56] that we keep pushing and we keep getting
[52:58] and and we keep giving more to God and
[53:00] we find ourselves being lifted up into a
[53:02] higher place because that's the spirit
[53:04] of the hour for the believer is we're
[53:06] being called up higher.
[53:09] I want you to listen what the prophet
[53:10] says. This is in 59. He says, "I'm glad
[53:14] for the results of last week's revival."
[53:17] He says it has not only given a local
[53:19] stir but around different countries and
[53:22] we've heard of it and that the Lord was
[53:24] good. How many have we heard testimonies
[53:27] that the Lord moved in our services?
[53:28] We're thankful for that. Now listen to
[53:30] what he says. He says, "Now if just
[53:32] burning the old bridges and making
[53:34] things ready and entering into the Lord
[53:37] prepared to receive the blessings."
[53:41] If that little time did that, he says,
[53:45] "What would it be if we continued on?"
[53:48] So, don't let it die. He says, "Don't
[53:51] let it die, but just keep pouring on
[53:54] more material and more material." And he
[53:56] said, "Keep adding to that fire until
[53:58] the so smoke signals will be seen plum
[54:01] around the world. Keep adding to the
[54:04] fire that Holy Ghost fire that Jesus
[54:07] Christ lives and there's a fire burning
[54:09] in our hearts. So brothers and sisters,
[54:12] as we look at that, what would our lives
[54:14] be like if we could just take heed to
[54:16] this one little quote, that we could
[54:19] pray more dedicated, that we could fast
[54:22] more dedicated, that we would put more
[54:24] of the desire to receive more of the
[54:26] Holy Ghost down in our lives and in our
[54:29] families and send the Holy Ghost after
[54:32] our lost loved ones, our lost children.
[54:35] Are you with me? How much greater would
[54:38] it be? I'll tell you what would happen.
[54:40] our expectation
[54:42] levels. Our expectation levels, we our
[54:46] expectation levels would rise to new
[54:48] heights so much that Wednesday night
[54:51] services wouldn't just be another
[54:53] Wednesday night service.
[54:55] Wednesday night services are more than
[54:58] just another work night, week night
[55:00] service.
[55:03] We can have that fire burning all the
[55:05] time. And listen what the prophet says
[55:08] here. Listen to what he
[55:10] says. after I have made a new
[55:18] dedication, the prophet of the hour, the
[55:21] the messenger to the last church
[55:24] age after I have made a new
[55:28] dedication my own self
[55:32] and my wife
[55:35] and so forth. We notice things so
[55:38] different around the home.
[55:44] What's that say for us?
[55:47] What does that say for us? I noticed
[55:49] things so different around the home. He
[55:51] said we're not as nervous.
[55:54] We're not as shaky. He says we're not as
[55:57] shaky as we was. We're not as jumpy. We
[55:59] don't we don't get this and get that and
[56:01] get in and get out. He said, "No, we
[56:02] just go quietly and we get more done."
[56:07] So he says, "Keep yourself consecrated
[56:10] to God through the coming year because
[56:13] we don't know what the Lord will do for
[56:15] us."
[56:17] That's a powerful quote.
[56:20] Jude, let's read from Jude
[56:23] here. Verse one, Jude the servant of
[56:27] Jesus Christ, the brother of James, to
[56:29] them that are sanctified,
[56:32] who them who are what? Sanctified. Am I
[56:35] speaking to any sanctified believers
[56:37] tonight? Stay with me now. Those who are
[56:40] sanctified by the father, by God the
[56:43] father, and who are preserved. How many
[56:45] of those are we have? You've been
[56:47] preserved. You've been bought. You've
[56:48] been paid for with a price. Preserved in
[56:51] Jesus Christ. And who the called?
[56:56] Mercy unto you, and peace and love be
[56:59] multiplied. Beloved, when I gave all
[57:02] diligence to write unto you of the
[57:04] common
[57:05] salvation, listen now, this he says the
[57:08] common salvation, it was more needful
[57:10] for me to write unto you and exhort you
[57:13] that you should what? Earnestly contend
[57:17] for the faith which was once delivered
[57:19] unto the saints.
[57:22] It wasn't enough just to talk about
[57:24] common salvation,
[57:26] but something stirred into Jude's heart.
[57:29] something stirred in his heart and said,
[57:30] "Hey, I want you to write to them and I
[57:33] want you to speak to them and I want you
[57:35] to encourage them to fight to fight for
[57:38] the for the for the faith that was once
[57:40] delivered into the
[57:44] saints." Listen now. For there are
[57:46] certain men crept in unawares who were
[57:48] before old ordained to this
[57:50] condemnation. Ungodly men turning the
[57:53] grace of our God into lasciviousness and
[57:55] denying the only Lord and our Lord Jesus
[58:00] Christ. So uh Psalm
[58:06] 35. Now listen to what this says here.
[58:09] Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that
[58:13] strive with me. fight against them that
[58:17] fight against
[58:19] me. Now, sometimes we can read a
[58:22] scripture and we can find it kind of in
[58:23] and it kind of we have to really break
[58:24] it down and slow it down and see what
[58:26] he's saying here. Well, I just happened
[58:28] to look through some other
[58:29] interpretations. It's just something
[58:30] said look through some other
[58:31] interpretations. Well, I found the
[58:32] interpretation of this Psalm 35 in the
[58:36] message Bible. Now, remember when I say
[58:38] the message Bible, I'm not talking about
[58:39] a a Bible that was written around the
[58:42] message. It's called, it's a translation
[58:44] the message. But I love the way it said
[58:47] because it really just hits home to
[58:49] exactly what I'm going to talk about
[58:50] tonight and what I'm trying to get
[58:52] through to to the people tonight. Listen
[58:54] to what it says. Psalms 35. Harass these
[58:58] hecklers,
[59:00] God. Punch these bullies in the
[59:06] nose. Watch out, devil.
[59:09] Watch out, devil. punch these bullies in
[59:12] the nose. Grab a weapon, anything at
[59:15] hand, and stand up for me. Aren't you
[59:18] thankful you got a God that stands for
[59:20] you tonight? You may have your seats.
[59:22] God bless you.
[59:24] I'm going to speak tonight if we could
[59:26] on contending believers. Contending
[59:29] believers. This is a little topic that
[59:31] has been on our heart and we could have
[59:33] went a thousand different directions,
[59:34] but this is how it unfolded. So
[59:39] contending believers. So we look at this
[59:42] book of Jude just to lay a foundation in
[59:44] this book of Jude. We see that this book
[59:46] was written some around some 33 years
[59:48] after the day of Pentecost. So this was
[59:51] after the pouring out of the Holy Spirit
[59:53] on the early saints. And Jude is is
[59:56] called to write this book to the church
[59:58] to tell them that they should earnestly
[1:00:00] contend. And the prophet said, "This is
[1:00:03] the only place in the sacred writings
[1:00:05] that we're ever told to contend because
[1:00:08] we're not
[1:00:10] contentious. We're not contentious
[1:00:12] people. There should be no contentions
[1:00:14] between believers. There should be no
[1:00:16] arguments, no strife, no riffs or
[1:00:18] tussles between believers or believe
[1:00:20] from this church to that church." Come
[1:00:22] on now. But we're believers, so there
[1:00:25] should be no contention amongst us. But
[1:00:28] he says instead we are to earnestly
[1:00:30] contend for a purpose. Now we're talking
[1:00:33] about a purpose. And he says that
[1:00:35] purpose is that we're contend for the
[1:00:38] faith that was once delivered unto the
[1:00:40] saints. So in order for us to get all
[1:00:43] that Christ has in store for us. That
[1:00:46] tells me, brother Tommy, we're going to
[1:00:47] have to fight. We're going to have to
[1:00:49] dig down deep. We're going to have to
[1:00:51] dig our heels in. And at some point
[1:00:53] we're going to have to fight because
[1:00:54] that old Satan, that old devil, he is
[1:00:57] here to kill, to steal, and destroy. And
[1:01:00] if you're going to get by him, you're
[1:01:02] going to have to stand up and fight.
[1:01:09] But you see, we got a problem around the
[1:01:11] message a lot of times. I see. Boy, I
[1:01:14] don't want to say
[1:01:15] it too
[1:01:17] harshly, but we have people who who come
[1:01:20] to Christ out of
[1:01:24] convenience. They're looking for a God
[1:01:27] when they need a
[1:01:30] God. Boy, I sure hope this don't apply
[1:01:32] to anybody sitting here tonight. And I
[1:01:34] hope the ones it does apply to hear it.
[1:01:37] But they're looking for a God when they
[1:01:39] need him, not because they're in love
[1:01:42] with him. You see, there's a difference.
[1:01:46] The people call upon God when they have
[1:01:48] a need, when they have a desire, when
[1:01:50] they're broke, and when when things are
[1:01:52] easy. They'll show up when when things
[1:01:54] are good. They'll just show up or or
[1:01:55] they maybe they don't, but they or
[1:01:57] they'll come when they're desperate, and
[1:01:59] they'll cry out to God when they're in
[1:02:01] despair. But that's not what the
[1:02:03] believer does. The believer finds
[1:02:06] themsself at a place that they are so in
[1:02:09] love, a love affair with Jesus Christ
[1:02:13] that there is nothing that would keep
[1:02:14] them from coming through the doors.
[1:02:17] There is nothing that could stop them to
[1:02:18] be here to fight for what God has want
[1:02:20] to do for them. And they have a purpose
[1:02:23] when they come here. And brothers and
[1:02:25] sisters, God is looking for a people
[1:02:27] that are willing to contend for that
[1:02:29] faith to fight for everything that God
[1:02:33] has promised them in this hour. Just
[1:02:36] like Joshua and
[1:02:37] Caleb, think about Joshua and Caleb.
[1:02:40] They stood there and they stood there
[1:02:41] and they went out and spied over that
[1:02:43] land that God had promised them.
[1:02:48] There was another group that went with
[1:02:50] them.
[1:02:52] They go over there and they look over
[1:02:54] there and they're the people that are
[1:02:56] just hanging around the church.
[1:02:59] Come on. They're the people that's just
[1:03:01] hanging around the church. They're not
[1:03:03] really in love with God.
[1:03:07] But it's convenient to hang out with the
[1:03:11] tribe. They have Sunday
[1:03:17] dinners. Somebody done left a phone up
[1:03:20] here. Am I being
[1:03:26] recorded? They hanging around the
[1:03:29] tribe. And so here they are. They're
[1:03:31] hanging around. They see and they go
[1:03:33] over and they look at this land and they
[1:03:35] see this land filled with
[1:03:39] giants. Giant obstacles stand before
[1:03:42] them. Gigantic problems stand before
[1:03:46] them. gigantic obstacles that they say
[1:03:49] there is no way that we can get through
[1:03:51] here. There's no way that we can take
[1:03:53] this
[1:03:54] land. But it didn't change the promise.
[1:03:58] And if God made a
[1:04:00] promise, there is somebody that is going
[1:04:03] to accept what that promise is. If God
[1:04:06] makes a promise in this hour that
[1:04:08] there's going to be a rapture,
[1:04:11] five million people may say, "No, it's
[1:04:14] not possible." But God will have a group
[1:04:17] of people in Elton, Kentucky, in Johnson
[1:04:20] City, in Menon, Louisiana, that says, "I
[1:04:22] know it's possible. I know that God can
[1:04:25] move. I know God's going to come down
[1:04:27] and take
[1:04:28] me." There's a group of people like a
[1:04:31] Joshua and a Caleb that looks over there
[1:04:32] and says, "This is a land that is
[1:04:34] flowing with milk and
[1:04:38] honey." I just seen where the prophet
[1:04:40] said, we were talking about it at dinner
[1:04:42] tonight. The prophet said, "That land
[1:04:43] flowing with milk and honey." He said,
[1:04:45] he said, "That's a Pentecostal
[1:04:47] cocktail." Some of us need to see and
[1:04:49] taste of that Pentecostal cocktail. We
[1:04:52] need to see and hear that milk and honey
[1:04:54] and taste it to know what God can do in
[1:04:56] our life. To put God on the scene, a God
[1:05:00] in action, a God that carries out the
[1:05:03] word,
[1:05:05] not just over there looking at giants.
[1:05:07] We all have problems.
[1:05:10] Some of us have big problems. Some of us
[1:05:12] are going through big things.
[1:05:14] But that doesn't change the promise that
[1:05:17] God gave
[1:05:21] us. You see that one group, they just
[1:05:25] kind of linger around the
[1:05:30] church. Why do they linger? Have you
[1:05:32] ever, you know, I I watch this. Y'all
[1:05:35] know I'm a people
[1:05:37] watcher. That's probably not good if
[1:05:39] you're a
[1:05:40] preacher, but I'm a people watcher. I
[1:05:42] try to figure out what's going on. Why
[1:05:44] do people linger around the
[1:05:47] church? If they don't, if they really
[1:05:49] don't want to be here, why do they
[1:05:51] come? Mom and daddy told them to go to
[1:05:55] church. They don't want to disappoint
[1:05:57] mom and
[1:05:59] daddy.
[1:06:01] Wow. Sure is quiet.
[1:06:05] But they don't want to disappoint what
[1:06:07] mom and daddy taught them. I'm supposed
[1:06:08] to be in church. Daddy said to be in
[1:06:10] church. Daddy said, "When the doors are
[1:06:12] open, if the love of God's in me, the
[1:06:13] doors are open, I'll be in the house of
[1:06:15] God." And they come without even a
[1:06:17] desire to be here, not even expecting
[1:06:20] from God, but just being a
[1:06:22] presence. Don't y'all get so quiet on
[1:06:24] me. Y'all need to help me now.
[1:06:29] And they sit there and they look around
[1:06:31] and they hang around this
[1:06:33] church. And but Joshua and
[1:06:36] Caleb, they seen it different.
[1:06:39] Joshua and Caleb, they looked across
[1:06:41] there and they said, "You know what? My
[1:06:43] mom and daddy may have told me about
[1:06:45] this land, but this was more than just a
[1:06:47] storytelling. This was more than just be
[1:06:50] here or be there. God said they promised
[1:06:53] us this land. I'm going to take this
[1:06:59] land." Because why? This land is worth
[1:07:02] fighting for. This gospel is worth
[1:07:04] fighting for. This message is worth
[1:07:06] fighting for. Your children are worth
[1:07:08] fighting for.
[1:07:12] God is looking for people who will fight
[1:07:14] through tiredness.
[1:07:19] Oh, I can't be there. I'm just so
[1:07:21] tired. I I just I'm just so tired. I
[1:07:24] just can't get I just can't get Don't
[1:07:26] give me your excuses.
[1:07:36] Some of the people that cry that
[1:07:37] wellhead
[1:07:40] I wonder if they've lifted a finger all
[1:07:41] week
[1:07:45] long. Maybe this this stuff till 2 or 3
[1:07:49] in the morning.
[1:07:54] But they're too tired for God.
[1:07:57] too tired to come and see what God has
[1:08:00] in store for them. God is looking for a
[1:08:04] people who will fight through sickness.
[1:08:09] You know, we have very little
[1:08:11] excuse if we at all follow and keep up
[1:08:14] with Brother Ron Spencer.
[1:08:18] And and if you haven't heard the
[1:08:20] stories, I can tell you some that but
[1:08:23] five minutes before he's supposed to
[1:08:24] come out and preach, he vomits 5, 10, 15
[1:08:27] times, goes into a seizure. Seizures
[1:08:30] that last 15 minutes, and blurs his
[1:08:32] vision where he can't see, and then he
[1:08:33] walks out the door, steps to the pull
[1:08:35] pit, and says, "Good morning."
[1:08:39] God is looking for those kind of people.
[1:08:42] God is looking for those people who will
[1:08:44] fight to do what God has called them to
[1:08:46] do.
[1:08:49] God is looking for people who will fight
[1:08:51] through hurt feelings.
[1:08:56] How many people you think around this
[1:08:58] message has given up their walk on the
[1:09:00] on God? Walk on the Lord just because of
[1:09:02] hurt feelings.
[1:09:04] Just because somebody said something
[1:09:06] that they didn't like? Just because they
[1:09:09] got their toes stepped on by a preacher.
[1:09:13] You know what I've come to find out? I
[1:09:14] figured this one out. Those people,
[1:09:17] brother John, those people that that get
[1:09:19] their feelings hurt and get their toes
[1:09:20] stepped on and they don't want to come
[1:09:21] to church. You know why they don't You
[1:09:23] know why they don't like that preacher?
[1:09:25] Because he told them the truth.
[1:09:30] People are not looking for the truth.
[1:09:32] They're not looking to hear the truth.
[1:09:33] They want somebody to agree with them,
[1:09:36] somebody to pat them on the back.
[1:09:41] But God is looking for these people who
[1:09:43] will find their way through hurt
[1:09:44] feelings.
[1:09:46] Not just risk a relationship with the
[1:09:48] Lord because you got your feelings
[1:09:50] stepped on. Let me ask you, how many of
[1:09:52] you have had your feelings hurt?
[1:09:56] Come on, church. We're human. Daniel's
[1:09:59] never had his feelings hurt. I was
[1:10:01] fixing to call you out,
[1:10:04] too. Let me go over here, Becca. You
[1:10:06] ever had your feelings hurt? You come
[1:10:08] from a big family. I've been in your
[1:10:10] house.
[1:10:11] I've seen you with your brother, you two
[1:10:14] sisters, and your mom and daddy. So, I
[1:10:16] I've been there and he hurt some of them
[1:10:17] conversations. I was the only child, so
[1:10:19] I'm just
[1:10:24] flabbergasted, but you've had your
[1:10:26] feelings hurt more than once. Did you
[1:10:29] disown the Adams family? You may have
[1:10:32] felt like it, but they steal your
[1:10:34] brother. They steal your sister. They
[1:10:37] steal her family. So why is it when
[1:10:39] somebody gets their feelings hurt in
[1:10:41] church, they disown God?
[1:10:44] Just because somebody done something to
[1:10:46] them and and hurt their feelings.
[1:10:49] Come on, church.
[1:10:52] Heaven is worth fighting for. Then no
[1:10:55] matter what they say, no matter how I
[1:10:57] feel, no matter how it hurts, heaven is
[1:11:00] worth fighting for. Eternal peace is
[1:11:02] worth fighting for. Love and happiness
[1:11:05] and joy is worth fighting for.
[1:11:09] No more sorrows is worth fighting for.
[1:11:11] No more tears is worth fighting for.
[1:11:14] Your children is worth fighting for. No
[1:11:17] more depression. No more sickness.
[1:11:19] Eternal life is worth fighting for.
[1:11:22] Amen.
[1:11:28] You know, a couple of weeks ago, you
[1:11:31] know, sometimes I put myself out there
[1:11:33] way too way too open for people. Some
[1:11:36] people say I shouldn't do that, but I
[1:11:38] think it keeps us
[1:11:40] real.
[1:11:42] Couple of weeks ago, just before the
[1:11:45] meetings, I got my feelings stomped on,
[1:11:51] hurt. Oh, all of you think I'm going to
[1:11:54] tell you why, don't you? No, it ain't
[1:11:59] happening. But something happened.
[1:12:04] And man, did Satan begin to whisper
[1:12:07] in my
[1:12:12] ear. He said, "They don't even love
[1:12:18] you. They don't even appreciate
[1:12:21] you. They don't care about
[1:12:24] you. You're not good enough. And you'll
[1:12:28] never make it.
[1:12:34] I'm going to preach a sermon I've been
[1:12:35] working on. It's called Conversation
[1:12:37] with the Devil.
[1:12:43] You know, I could have let that get me
[1:12:45] down. I could have let that hold me
[1:12:48] back. I could have listened to him and I
[1:12:50] could have said, "You know what? I bet
[1:12:51] you're right, Satan. They don't love me.
[1:12:54] I've seen the way they don't appreciate
[1:12:57] me. I've seen the way they treat me."
[1:12:59] And I could have went just down that
[1:13:00] road so fast and so easy. And you're
[1:13:03] right, I don't even know if I can make
[1:13:06] it. I could have let it get the best of
[1:13:09] me. And I could have let it ruin my
[1:13:11] expectations of the meetings. I could
[1:13:14] have let it tear down all of my
[1:13:16] anticipations of what I was wanting to
[1:13:18] see God do in our meetings.
[1:13:24] You see, because if Satan can beat you
[1:13:27] today, he's got you tomorrow.
[1:13:30] Think about that. If he can get you so
[1:13:33] down today, how can you be victorious
[1:13:35] tomorrow?
[1:13:39] You know, I could have moped
[1:13:41] around. I could have quit praying. I
[1:13:44] could have given up. Brother Tommy,
[1:13:45] don't text me at 5:00 no more. I'm
[1:13:48] done. Y'all have the meetings you want.
[1:13:54] And you know it it was a
[1:13:57] struggle because every time I would
[1:13:59] think about
[1:14:01] this, it was
[1:14:06] painful. And it was a struggle for me as
[1:14:09] I began to fight and battle through
[1:14:10] this. And I thought, you know what? I
[1:14:12] can hide
[1:14:13] this. Nobody will ever know. I'll just
[1:14:16] play it off. I can hide it. But you know
[1:14:19] how it is when something's on your mind.
[1:14:20] You got to you got to you got to tell
[1:14:22] something. You got to tell
[1:14:29] it. But I couldn't hide
[1:14:32] it. So I went to my queen over
[1:14:37] there. You know, she's been my best
[1:14:39] friend since we were 16, 15, 16 years
[1:14:42] old. We dated about that time. We
[1:14:46] married young going on 29 years. I think
[1:14:50] that's
[1:14:52] right. She's been by my side every day.
[1:14:56] Through thick and through thin, through
[1:14:58] hard and through good, through rain,
[1:14:59] through hail, through storms, it doesn't
[1:15:01] matter. She stood right by
[1:15:09] me. And I told her, I just told her in
[1:15:12] in conversation, I had to get this this
[1:15:15] off my chest. Did you know? And I began
[1:15:17] to tell her and she said, "Huh?" And she
[1:15:19] didn't say nothing for a while. She come
[1:15:21] back a couple hours
[1:15:23] later. Let me tell you, wives know
[1:15:27] you. She said, "Did that hurt your
[1:15:32] feelings?" I said, "Yeah, just a little
[1:15:34] bit." I said, "But it'll be all right.
[1:15:37] It'll be all right." And so I began to
[1:15:40] think about that. And about the time she
[1:15:43] tell me that, right about right then and
[1:15:44] there, I thought, I'm not going to let
[1:15:46] this get me. So, I started to contend
[1:15:50] for the faith. I started to fight for
[1:15:52] what for what God had done in my life,
[1:15:54] for what God had brought me from, for
[1:15:56] the friends that he had given me, for
[1:15:58] the love that had been showed to me, for
[1:16:00] what he's done for me in this pull pit.
[1:16:02] And I begin to contend. And I begin to
[1:16:04] put all those thoughts aside. When the
[1:16:06] depression came, I put it aside. Amen.
[1:16:10] When the anger came, I put it aside.
[1:16:12] When I got all nervous and all worked up
[1:16:14] on the inside, I put it aside. I fought
[1:16:18] back.
[1:16:19] And you know what? Satan tried to talk
[1:16:21] to me. So, I just thought, well, I'm
[1:16:22] going to tell you a thing or two.
[1:16:25] And so, I said, Satan, let me tell you,
[1:16:27] you are a liar.
[1:16:29] Because my God, my God told me he would
[1:16:32] never leave me. He would never forsake
[1:16:37] me.
[1:16:38] That word forsake means he will not
[1:16:41] abandon you. Oh, we got a God who will
[1:16:45] never abandon you.
[1:16:48] He'll be with me and in
[1:16:51] me until it's
[1:16:57] over. So there's nothing too big for my
[1:16:59] God.
[1:17:03] You look at that word contend and it
[1:17:05] means that you're engaging in a
[1:17:06] struggle.
[1:17:10] You ever had a struggle?
[1:17:12] If you got a struggle, you more than
[1:17:13] likely have an
[1:17:15] opponent. You have an opposition,
[1:17:18] something that you're fighting against,
[1:17:19] whether it's physical, if you're in a
[1:17:22] battle on a in a street fight, there's
[1:17:25] somebody you're fighting. If it's
[1:17:26] somebody you're having an argument with,
[1:17:28] it's a verbal. But we fight something
[1:17:31] that's a little bit different. It's not
[1:17:32] flesh. It's not blood. It's spiritual.
[1:17:35] And so that
[1:17:36] adversary, the devil,
[1:17:39] he is our adversary. He is our opponent.
[1:17:43] And we are battling him in a war.
[1:17:46] And we fight this war every single day
[1:17:49] we step out.
[1:17:52] Not only that, but when you lay down at
[1:17:54] night,
[1:17:57] he's there.
[1:18:00] He watches you sleep. Now, I'm not
[1:18:02] trying to scare you kids. Don't take
[1:18:03] that wrong. But he's there. He's
[1:18:05] waiting. He's a polished warrior. He
[1:18:08] knows you better than you know yourself.
[1:18:11] And for some people, their self is their
[1:18:13] biggest problem.
[1:18:19] That's why it's called
[1:18:22] selfish because their biggest
[1:18:25] problem is
[1:18:28] themselves. And the devil is always in
[1:18:32] your ear.
[1:18:33] And the prophet says that we know our
[1:18:36] enemy by his
[1:18:38] attacks. And so we know our enemy. He
[1:18:40] said, ' Maybe you didn't get that just
[1:18:42] right. He said, we know our enemy. We
[1:18:44] know his old attack. He broke down the
[1:18:47] human race. And the way he gets you away
[1:18:50] from God is to disbelieve his
[1:18:54] word. And I got to thinking about that
[1:18:56] and I thought, you know what most people
[1:18:58] when they read that, you know what most
[1:18:59] people's going to think? That he gets us
[1:19:01] to disbelieve his word. and
[1:19:04] doctrine that he gets us to disbelieve
[1:19:07] his word and what we've been taught
[1:19:08] through the church ages or through the
[1:19:10] seals and through the statue and he
[1:19:11] tries to get us there but that's not it.
[1:19:13] He will use just the little subtle
[1:19:14] things. God don't love you
[1:19:17] but God's word said he is
[1:19:21] love. God can't heal you but he said but
[1:19:24] the word says that he's the God that
[1:19:27] heals all of your afflictions. Amen.
[1:19:31] He tells you that he don't care for you.
[1:19:34] These are the things that this is how he
[1:19:36] gets you to think that you're up the
[1:19:38] word. It's the little things. It's not
[1:19:40] the big thing. It's the little
[1:19:41] foxes that's full of the vine. And so
[1:19:45] that Satan begins to throw these things
[1:19:47] at you. And the prophet says that the
[1:19:48] only way that you could ever stay in
[1:19:50] fellowship with God and to talk to him
[1:19:52] in the cool of the evening. Oh, isn't
[1:19:55] that a great place to be? in the cool of
[1:19:58] the evening when when all the day is
[1:19:59] done and you're sitting there and you're
[1:20:00] and you're sharing your thoughts with
[1:20:02] God and you're in the cool of the
[1:20:03] evening. It makes me think what the
[1:20:04] prophet said with Adam and Eve in the
[1:20:06] cool of the garden and God would come
[1:20:08] down and commune with them. I love that
[1:20:10] place. But he says the only way that you
[1:20:12] can get in the cool of the evening with
[1:20:14] him is to stay fortified in his word.
[1:20:20] So let me ask you, if you're fortified,
[1:20:22] doesn't that mean that you're in a
[1:20:24] battle?
[1:20:26] If there is a fort, there's an army. If
[1:20:29] you're if you're in a fortress, you're
[1:20:31] being protected for something. And he
[1:20:34] says, "So just find yourself and let the
[1:20:36] curtain, both sides of the curtain of
[1:20:38] God's word drop down around you and find
[1:20:41] yourself right in the middle of those
[1:20:43] curtains, and there you'll be
[1:20:46] fortified."
[1:20:52] Right in the middle of it.
[1:20:56] Isn't that a great place?
[1:21:00] You look to the left, there's God. You
[1:21:03] look to the right, there's
[1:21:05] God. You look ahead, there's God. You
[1:21:07] look behind you, there's God. You look
[1:21:09] up, there's God. There's God all around
[1:21:11] you. God all around. There's
[1:21:13] believers making intercession for
[1:21:18] you. How many enjoyed those meetings we
[1:21:20] had that we just came out of? Give the
[1:21:23] Lord a hand.
[1:21:24] clap. What an amazing amazing time and
[1:21:27] meetings we
[1:21:29] had. But you know, brothers and sisters,
[1:21:31] we don't have to leave that kind of
[1:21:32] atmosphere.
[1:21:34] We don't have to just say that that
[1:21:36] atmosphere only comes once a year on a
[1:21:40] set date. That's not the way God works.
[1:21:42] But we can have those kinds of
[1:21:44] visitations from God on a regular basis.
[1:21:47] Because if we're honest, how many of us
[1:21:49] could say that we dedicated ourselves a
[1:21:51] little bit better?
[1:21:53] How many prayed a little bit better? I
[1:21:55] challenged you. Did you accept the
[1:21:57] challenge? Yeah. People are shaking
[1:21:59] their heads everywhere.
[1:22:00] Yeah. So, you begin to rise up and you
[1:22:04] begin to find yourself with
[1:22:07] expectations. You begin to find yourself
[1:22:10] contending for something.
[1:22:13] How many of you come to those meetings
[1:22:14] with a purpose?
[1:22:16] You had a desire. You had a thought. You
[1:22:19] had something you needed God to do in
[1:22:21] your life.
[1:22:23] and you were praying for it. Let me tell
[1:22:26] you, I've seen people come through that
[1:22:27] prayer line.
[1:22:31] I'm going to stop right there. I'm going
[1:22:33] to get to it. I wasn't going to do it,
[1:22:36] but I'm going to do it. I've seen
[1:22:38] families
[1:22:40] united. I've seen testimonies, heard
[1:22:42] testimonies of where God moved into
[1:22:44] people's lives that they had never had
[1:22:47] an experience like that in their life.
[1:22:49] That it was the best night of their
[1:22:51] life.
[1:22:54] Why is
[1:22:55] tonight not the same? It should be. It
[1:22:59] should be. We should have that
[1:23:01] atmosphere. But what was it? We was
[1:23:03] contending for something. We was
[1:23:05] fighting for God to move on the scene.
[1:23:07] And we had confidence that God was going
[1:23:09] to come and God was going to deliver.
[1:23:13] And might I say, he came, he saw, and he
[1:23:15] conquered. God moved in a mighty way
[1:23:18] like I haven't seen in years in this
[1:23:20] church if
[1:23:21] ever. It's okay. Give him a round of
[1:23:25] applause. It's because you It's because
[1:23:29] you had a desire. You had a need in your
[1:23:31] life. Something that you needed God to
[1:23:33] come and impact you. And Jude tells us
[1:23:36] to I want to encourage you, exhort you
[1:23:39] to earnestly contend for that faith, to
[1:23:42] earnestly contend for it.
[1:23:45] So 33 years after the day of Pentecost,
[1:23:48] Jude writes this
[1:23:50] letter. After the pouring out of the
[1:23:52] Holy Ghost on the early saints, Jude
[1:23:55] needs to remind us
[1:23:58] too that you need an
[1:24:00] outpouring of the Holy Ghost. I need an
[1:24:04] outpouring of the Holy Ghost. The church
[1:24:07] here needs an outpouring of the Holy
[1:24:09] Ghost. You say, "Man, I think we're
[1:24:11] moving on. I think we're doing good." I
[1:24:13] do, too. But let me tell you, I thought
[1:24:15] about this the other day, and I didn't
[1:24:16] have this in my notes, but this is the
[1:24:17] way it came to me. I thought, you know,
[1:24:20] when I was a young preacher, I I thought
[1:24:22] I was I I was living good and and I
[1:24:24] thought I had the Holy Ghost. And man, I
[1:24:27] tell you what, I had about enough Holy
[1:24:28] Ghost to fill my big
[1:24:31] toe. Well, maybe all of y'all was just
[1:24:33] bubbling
[1:24:35] over. But as a young minister, I
[1:24:37] thought, man, I got the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:24:39] on fire for God. And then somebody would
[1:24:42] rub me wrong.
[1:24:46] And that
[1:24:47] temper will begin to
[1:24:53] rage. It may have been enough Holy Ghost
[1:24:56] to fill my pinky toe, brother Tommy. Cuz
[1:24:59] one time I got so mad I went to the gun.
[1:25:01] I went to the house and I was going into
[1:25:04] the get to get to my house to get a gun
[1:25:06] and it wasn't to target practice.
[1:25:12] Thank the Lord I was locked out of the
[1:25:15] house. You know, God has a way of
[1:25:17] protecting people from doing stupid
[1:25:19] stuff. You know, you you can do some of
[1:25:21] the stupidest stuff. I'm talking to
[1:25:23] myself without the Holy Ghost. And all
[1:25:26] along I thought I had the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:29] And I'm not underplaying anybody's Holy
[1:25:31] Ghost. But what I'm trying to tell you
[1:25:33] is there is more of the Holy Ghost for
[1:25:36] you.
[1:25:38] There is more than just a big toes worth
[1:25:41] or a knee filling or a waist filling.
[1:25:44] Let God keep pouring in more and more
[1:25:47] and more. We were filling them pots. Oh,
[1:25:50] come on
[1:25:54] church. Rebecca had some songs playing
[1:25:57] on the on the on the speaker, whatever
[1:25:59] you Bluetooth. And we were sitting there
[1:26:01] and we were filling them
[1:26:02] pots. Oh yeah, them 12in pots. How many
[1:26:05] do we fill, sisters?
[1:26:08] How many? We're at about 5,000 right
[1:26:11] now. But while we were filling them
[1:26:14] pots, song came on and it said, "Fill
[1:26:17] said was talking about filling the cup.
[1:26:20] Filling the cup." And I, she said,
[1:26:22] Rebecca said, "We filling the pots." She
[1:26:25] said, "There's your next sermon." She
[1:26:26] said, "That'll preach." And there's a
[1:26:28] lot of truth into that because there is
[1:26:30] more of God. Don't just give me a cup
[1:26:32] full of God. Give me pots full and pots
[1:26:35] full and pots full because I want more
[1:26:38] of you,
[1:26:39] Lord. And when I think I'm full, let me
[1:26:42] run
[1:26:46] over. You know, when they anointed
[1:26:48] David, they poured the oil over him.
[1:26:49] When they anointed the the the priest
[1:26:51] and the kings, they poured the oil over
[1:26:53] Aaron.
[1:26:56] Pour it over me, God. Pour it over me.
[1:27:00] Pour your spirit over on me, Lord.
[1:27:05] tomorrow and we're trying to get get
[1:27:07] through here. We we're
[1:27:10] okay. You know, we limit God. I've said
[1:27:12] that too many times and I I'm I'm
[1:27:14] getting
[1:27:18] bit. We put God on time constraint. So,
[1:27:20] these two over here ain't sleeping. He's
[1:27:22] afraid they going to sleep on me tonight
[1:27:24] because they tired, but they fighting
[1:27:27] tiredness. Tomorrow, May the 29th, is
[1:27:30] Ascension Day.
[1:27:34] 40 days since Easter morning
[1:27:36] resurrection. Now, this is not a this is
[1:27:38] a this is a holiday that most most most
[1:27:41] Christian churches don't really
[1:27:42] celebrate. It's more Catholics celebrate
[1:27:44] it and and Menanite and Amish. They'll
[1:27:47] close there. There won't be no Menanite.
[1:27:48] No Dutch countries open tomorrow. So,
[1:27:50] you ain't going to go get no bread
[1:27:52] tomorrow. You might get some at brother
[1:27:54] Troy's, but not around here.
[1:27:59] But the 40 days since the Easter morning
[1:28:02] resurrection. And so as I slow down here
[1:28:05] for just a moment, I want you to think
[1:28:06] about this. Jesus spends day after day
[1:28:10] after day walking throughout the cities
[1:28:13] and the country. He's preaching and
[1:28:16] teaching. He's doing things that has
[1:28:18] never been seen. He's he's healed
[1:28:20] blinded eyes. Eyes have been opened.
[1:28:21] Deaf ears have been opened. Dead has
[1:28:24] been raised. So all of these things are
[1:28:27] happening and they're watching this. The
[1:28:29] disciples, the apostles, the people of
[1:28:31] the land are watching this happen in
[1:28:33] Jesus's life as he's walking. He begins
[1:28:35] to foretell the death, burial, and
[1:28:37] resurrection that is to come. So, we
[1:28:40] know at this point now Jesus is is
[1:28:42] clearly explaining to them what's going
[1:28:44] to happen. But they're in disbelief, but
[1:28:47] it
[1:28:49] happens. It's see they were in
[1:28:51] disbelief, but the word didn't change.
[1:28:54] It happens. And so now here is
[1:28:57] Jesus and a and after his death, burial,
[1:29:00] and
[1:29:02] resurrection, they just still in a place
[1:29:04] they don't know what they're going to
[1:29:05] do. And here he comes appearing on the
[1:29:08] scene in
[1:29:11] flesh, not a spirit. And for 40 days,
[1:29:15] Jesus now is working around through the
[1:29:17] people. He's going around. He's
[1:29:19] revealing himself to the people as the
[1:29:22] living, risen savior of the world. And
[1:29:25] now he begins to tell his apostles and
[1:29:27] the disciples again, "Go and wait in
[1:29:30] Jerusalem. Wait in Jerusalem because
[1:29:33] there is a promise the father has given
[1:29:35] that there's going to be a
[1:29:37] baptismal." Come on. An immersion of the
[1:29:41] Holy Ghost that's going to come down
[1:29:43] upon the people.
[1:29:47] You could read it right in the book of
[1:29:48] Acts. It says it just about that way.
[1:29:51] There's going to be an immersion of the
[1:29:53] Holy Ghost to come down. And he says,
[1:29:55] "You shall receive power
[1:29:58] and you shall be a witness of what I am
[1:30:01] in your life."
[1:30:04] Think about this. So Jesus now takes the
[1:30:07] apostles out out to Bethany up about two
[1:30:09] miles from Jerusalem. And Jesus now
[1:30:12] lifts his hands and he blesses the
[1:30:14] people. Luke 24. And he blesses the
[1:30:16] people. And he is then carried up into
[1:30:19] the heavens, up into the up into the
[1:30:21] sky. And then there he looked and
[1:30:23] they're left staring at the heavens. So
[1:30:26] now these people are left staring at the
[1:30:29] heavens and wondering now what do we
[1:30:36] do? He spends
[1:30:39] years doing miracles, signs, wonders,
[1:30:42] miracles, signs, wonders, miracles,
[1:30:44] signs, wonders. death, burial,
[1:30:47] resurrection, comes back for 40 days.
[1:30:49] You want to talk about a miracle, a
[1:30:50] sign, and a wonder. But now here they
[1:30:53] stand in awe and in wonder of what is
[1:30:57] about to happen. So what could they do
[1:31:01] now? What could they
[1:31:07] do? Brothers and sisters, they had to
[1:31:09] start contending.
[1:31:12] You think there wasn't a battle that was
[1:31:14] going
[1:31:15] on? You think there wasn't a battle that
[1:31:17] was going on in their minds? No doubt
[1:31:19] the battle was on. There was 120 men and
[1:31:22] women, followers of Jesus Christ, that
[1:31:24] were now standing there wondering, "What
[1:31:26] are we going to do?" He tells us to go
[1:31:28] and wait. What are we going to do? How
[1:31:29] long are we going to wait? What's going
[1:31:31] to
[1:31:34] happen? And we struggle with the
[1:31:37] rapture.
[1:31:40] The Bible says he'll come back just like
[1:31:42] he went.
[1:31:45] He done it once, he can do it again.
[1:31:48] He'll do it
[1:31:51] again. 120
[1:31:53] believers. Now, these wasn't the high
[1:31:55] fallutants of the city. These wasn't
[1:31:57] dignitaries. I want you to think about
[1:31:59] this. These wasn't the dignitaries or
[1:32:01] the Pharisees or the priests or the
[1:32:03] bishops. But there was 120 ordinary
[1:32:07] everyday people,
[1:32:11] farmers,
[1:32:14] shepherds, housewives, homemakers,
[1:32:17] carpenters,
[1:32:21] storekeepers,
[1:32:24] loggers,
[1:32:27] nurses, military
[1:32:30] men, retired military. I'm gonna include
[1:32:33] you, brother
[1:32:37] Glenn.
[1:32:40] Teachers, ordinary
[1:32:43] people. But you know what the word says?
[1:32:45] The word says that at that hour they
[1:32:48] joined
[1:32:49] together. And they joined together in
[1:32:52] one accord. And they joined together in
[1:32:54] one accord. It says in prayer and
[1:32:57] supplication. I looked up that word. I
[1:33:00] know what prayer means. But I want to
[1:33:02] know for sure what supplication means.
[1:33:05] It says an earnest request.
[1:33:09] Oh, you must earnestly
[1:33:12] contend. So now here's 120 people in an
[1:33:15] upper room chamber sitting there for 10
[1:33:18] days. 10 days under the under crying out
[1:33:21] to God to move onto the scene. For 10
[1:33:23] days they fight the temptation to quit.
[1:33:27] How many of you's ever had the
[1:33:28] temptation to
[1:33:29] quit? Amen. Sure you have. Because
[1:33:34] sometimes it gets
[1:33:36] hard. Anybody ever tell you the road of
[1:33:38] a Christian life is a easy road? They a
[1:33:40] liar. And I'll tell them they're a liar.
[1:33:44] Because the road that a Christian walks
[1:33:45] is a hard road. It's a road of
[1:33:47] persecution. It's a road of trials. It's
[1:33:50] a road of challenges. But it's also a
[1:33:52] road of forgiveness. It's a road of
[1:33:54] love. And it's a road of eternity.
[1:33:57] But now here these are contending in
[1:34:00] prayer and supplication and they're
[1:34:01] crying out because but on that 10th day
[1:34:06] something began to happen. Jerusalem
[1:34:09] began to shake. Can you think about the
[1:34:12] power as it moved through there? I was
[1:34:15] thinking about it as the storm come
[1:34:16] through the other night and we were
[1:34:18] sitting in the fellowship hall and that
[1:34:20] wind was howling so hard that the rain
[1:34:22] was blowing sideways.
[1:34:26] The wind moved through the through the
[1:34:28] church through Jerusalem and it begin to
[1:34:30] shake the
[1:34:36] walls. What was
[1:34:39] it? Pentecost
[1:34:41] had
[1:34:43] arrived. Pentecost had made its way. The
[1:34:46] Holy Ghost fire fell upon them. And
[1:34:48] there was a flame over him. And there
[1:34:50] was a flame over you and a flame over
[1:34:52] you and over you. And the fire fell here
[1:34:55] and it fell there. And their needs began
[1:34:58] to get met. And they were in such one
[1:35:00] accord that they spoke in one
[1:35:03] language, a language that was unknown.
[1:35:06] And the people said, "Hey, aren't these
[1:35:07] people
[1:35:10] Galileans? Oh, that Holy Ghost fire
[1:35:13] poured out upon them. They spoke with
[1:35:15] tongues. They spoke in unknown
[1:35:16] languages. They they begin to utter
[1:35:19] things out. And they see the mighty God,
[1:35:21] the Father, Jesus Christ, moving on the
[1:35:23] scene. And they said, "Here it is. This
[1:35:25] is what we've longed for. This is what
[1:35:27] we've waited for. We have always wanted
[1:35:29] to be like him. And now I
[1:35:34] am. I am." These weren't an ordinary 120
[1:35:39] people that are ordinary that was going
[1:35:41] to turn the world upside down with the
[1:35:44] fire that fell on
[1:35:48] Pentecost. And one day Peter stood and
[1:35:50] he began to speak. Peter began to boldly
[1:35:53] stand out there and he began to present
[1:35:55] himself and he be to tell what Jesus had
[1:35:57] done. 3,000
[1:36:05] people,
[1:36:07] 3,000
[1:36:11] people they went forth. It says, "And
[1:36:14] they the Lord worked with them and they
[1:36:17] began to tell the Lord's work and they
[1:36:19] confirmed with words with signs and
[1:36:22] wonders following
[1:36:26] what's following us
[1:36:29] a lot.
[1:36:31] Testimony after testimony, healing after
[1:36:34] healing, deliverance after deliverance,
[1:36:37] prodals returning after prodals
[1:36:39] returning. We didn't have that 20 years
[1:36:42] ago. Something has happened. There's
[1:36:45] been a move of God and a fire that has
[1:36:47] fell amongst his people. And the God's
[1:36:49] people are calling him on the scene. And
[1:36:51] we're now seeing God in
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:36:57] action. Listen to this. Christ made you
[1:37:00] free. God made us free. Don't starve to
[1:37:03] death. God has Pentecostal blessings all
[1:37:07] through the
[1:37:08] skies. And you have untapped resources
[1:37:12] of his goodness. Amen.
[1:37:19] Untapped. You know, if you was thirsty
[1:37:21] and you needed a
[1:37:23] well, you would love for that well
[1:37:25] digger to come out and say, "We got a
[1:37:28] untapped
[1:37:29] resource on your
[1:37:32] property." You'll never run it dry.
[1:37:34] Brother Bose's from Arizona. He knows
[1:37:36] what I'm talking about. He's shaking his
[1:37:38] head. When they tell them they got a
[1:37:39] well, they go to shouting. They go to
[1:37:41] praising. They go to dancing. Why?
[1:37:43] Because water is such a good resource.
[1:37:45] And the prophet tells us all those
[1:37:47] Pentecostal blessings are up there. And
[1:37:49] it's an untapped resource. You're not
[1:37:52] going to run it out.
[1:37:59] How do we get
[1:38:01] there? The eagle. He says, I'm not
[1:38:04] jumping. I got to I got somewhere I'm
[1:38:05] going. The eagle, he says, builds his
[1:38:08] nest high up on the rock. He's like the
[1:38:12] church. He says, the church of Jesus
[1:38:14] Christ is the church that is set on a
[1:38:16] hill. It gives off a light. It's
[1:38:18] high. It has high ambitions.
[1:38:25] You know, uh, a lot of people think I'm
[1:38:27] crazy about half the time because I just
[1:38:30] I just try stuff.
[1:38:36] I sent brother to brother
[1:38:38] Tom. Lord help
[1:38:41] me. I go to brother Tommy's
[1:38:44] house. And he says, "Let me show you
[1:38:46] this hot tub. He done built this hot tub
[1:38:49] out of a water trough insulated." Tammy,
[1:38:51] it's okay. It's okay, sis. It's okay. He
[1:38:55] done built this hot tub. So, I look at
[1:38:57] it and I say, "Man, I'd like to have one
[1:38:59] now." He sends me the plans to it.
[1:39:03] He shows me his soaking cold soaking
[1:39:06] tub. I said, "That's all right. You can
[1:39:08] do both in this one." He's texting me
[1:39:10] back. You can set this up. You can do
[1:39:11] hot and
[1:39:13] cold. Joyce, I was telling Joyce about
[1:39:15] it. She said, "You ain't allowed to go
[1:39:17] to Tommy's no
[1:39:19] more. Y'all can't even
[1:39:21] talk." I sent him a text the other day
[1:39:23] and I said, "Look," I said, "Listen,
[1:39:25] look at this, Tommy." I said, "It's a
[1:39:27] whole truckload of barrels, 4 foot by 4
[1:39:29] foot barrels. We can get them for $5 a
[1:39:32] piece." I said, "Can you imagine the
[1:39:34] money we can make selling hot
[1:39:36] tubs?" He said, "Let's
[1:39:46] go." But the Pentecostal believer, the
[1:39:49] church, the bride, he says she has high
[1:39:54] ambitions. He said we ought to have high
[1:39:56] expectations. It should have high
[1:39:59] expectations because it's been expecting
[1:40:02] God to do something.
[1:40:05] What good is a God if he never does
[1:40:07] anything?
[1:40:10] You know, we got the only We serve the
[1:40:12] only God that has ever risen and come up
[1:40:14] out of the ground and is alive today.
[1:40:16] The rest of them still sitting in a
[1:40:18] tomb. They ain't doing nothing. But I
[1:40:21] see my God working. I see my God moving.
[1:40:24] I see my God delivering.
[1:40:26] [Applause]
[1:40:33] I got to I got to find a ramp here,
[1:40:35] brother Steve. Start making my way
[1:40:37] down. He says, "Come to church this
[1:40:40] afternoon." If you're
[1:40:41] sick and you say, "I'm expecting to go
[1:40:44] home." Well, and I'm not leaving until I
[1:40:48] do.
[1:40:49] Now, that's contending for the faith. He
[1:40:52] says, "If you haven't got the Holy
[1:40:54] Ghost, say I'll stay here and I'll rot
[1:40:56] in this place or I'll get the Holy
[1:41:00] Ghost." Are we willing to
[1:41:03] fight? He said, "But we take it too
[1:41:07] haphazardly."
[1:41:09] Huh? Many times we we count it as, like
[1:41:12] I said, just another service. This is
[1:41:13] just another Wednesday night. I don't
[1:41:15] think this is just another Wednesday
[1:41:16] night. There's a there's a special
[1:41:18] presence here. The music was a certain
[1:41:20] way. the the atmosphere was set in a
[1:41:22] certain way, in a certain tone.
[1:41:25] Somebody came expecting.
[1:41:28] Somebody came
[1:41:33] expecting. But many
[1:41:38] times, sometimes people will say, "Well,
[1:41:41] it's just Brother Ber preaching or it's
[1:41:44] just Brother Brad
[1:41:46] preaching." Well, you know what? I I if
[1:41:50] you come that
[1:41:52] way, if you're coming to see what the
[1:41:54] man
[1:41:56] does, you're going to see a man.
[1:42:00] Because if you're sitting back there and
[1:42:02] you say, "Well, it's just Brother Ber.
[1:42:04] It's just Brother Brad. It's just
[1:42:05] Brother Joe. It's just Brother Tim. It's
[1:42:06] just
[1:42:08] Brother." You're sitting back there,
[1:42:10] you're not going to see God do anything.
[1:42:13] You're going to think about all of
[1:42:14] Brother Brad's mistakes. You're going to
[1:42:16] think about the things he done as a
[1:42:18] young person. You're going to think
[1:42:20] about the things he said wrong. You're
[1:42:22] going to think about the the way he hurt
[1:42:23] your feelings.
[1:42:26] Amen. Good preaching.
[1:42:29] But if you come here with expectations
[1:42:32] and say, "I don't care who's preaching
[1:42:35] tonight.
[1:42:36] I don't come to hear man. I come to hear
[1:42:38] God. God, I have a need in my life. I
[1:42:41] have a desire in my heart. And Lord,
[1:42:44] just speak to whoever it is. Speak
[1:42:46] through him that I may receive what you
[1:42:49] have in store for
[1:42:54] me. You know, our attitude determines
[1:42:56] what we get.
[1:42:59] Our attitude determines what we
[1:43:02] get. We come expecting to get an answer
[1:43:05] from God, you'll get an answer from God.
[1:43:10] I'm going to interject this. It's not in
[1:43:12] my notes, but I'm going to put it in
[1:43:14] there. I told you I got my feelings
[1:43:17] hurt, right? Yeah. I got my feelings
[1:43:20] hurt. I mully grubbed about it for a
[1:43:23] couple
[1:43:26] days and I thought, you know what? I
[1:43:28] don't even know if I'm going to church.
[1:43:35] Some of you angels put your wings up.
[1:43:41] But I said, "No, that's not the right
[1:43:43] attitude. Thank God for the Holy Ghost
[1:43:45] above my big toe."
[1:43:48] I said, "I'm going to go see what God
[1:43:49] says about
[1:43:51] this. I'm going to go see what God says
[1:43:53] about this. And I'm going to see if I
[1:43:55] got the right attitude or if I if I
[1:43:57] should have my feelings hurt or what I
[1:43:58] shouldn't. I'm going to go see what God
[1:44:01] says. Amen. I didn't go ask brother Ber
[1:44:05] before service, hey, what do you think
[1:44:06] about this? No. We prayed. We went
[1:44:09] through our normal routines. We prayed.
[1:44:10] We had song service. I sat down right
[1:44:13] here, took my spot right
[1:44:18] here. And he says, "God don't need no
[1:44:22] babies."
[1:44:28] Come again. God, I don't expect you to
[1:44:31] be crying, he said. I thought that's
[1:44:34] what you
[1:44:36] said. Problem solved.
[1:44:40] But if I would have come and asked
[1:44:42] Brother Ber or if I'd have said, "Well,
[1:44:45] he's just picking on me. Joyce must have
[1:44:47] told
[1:44:49] him." No, that's not the way God works.
[1:44:53] But when you come with
[1:44:55] expectations, things change.
[1:44:59] If you have a need in your life, you can
[1:45:02] stake on
[1:45:04] it. Brother Brandham said there was a
[1:45:06] man that come to he was trying to seek
[1:45:08] God and every time he'd say, "I'm
[1:45:10] saved." He said the devil would say,
[1:45:11] "No, you're
[1:45:13] not." He said, and he he would say, "I'm
[1:45:16] saved." And he would say, "No, you're
[1:45:17] not." And he said he one day he drove
[1:45:20] down a stake.
[1:45:22] Come on now. And he said, he drove down
[1:45:25] that stake. And he said, "From this time
[1:45:27] on, Satan, I'll point you to this stake.
[1:45:32] I'm going to point you to this stake.
[1:45:34] This is the place where I met God's
[1:45:36] requirements right here."
[1:45:40] Come on, church. Some of us need to
[1:45:42] drive our steak down. Some of you need
[1:45:44] to drive your steak down over
[1:45:46] depression, over anxiety, over fear,
[1:45:49] over doubt, over anger. Drive your state
[1:45:52] down. He said, "Drive it down right
[1:45:54] beside you." I challenge you. If you've
[1:45:56] got something in your life that you need
[1:45:57] God to move on, open up your Bible and
[1:46:00] write it right there. Depression, May
[1:46:02] the 28th, I drive my stake. I'll point
[1:46:05] you back, Satan, every time to this
[1:46:07] word.
[1:46:09] You don't have to have it no more. Drive
[1:46:11] that stake.
[1:46:15] Fear shouldn't have no holds on us.
[1:46:18] Doubt shouldn't have any holds on us.
[1:46:21] drive the
[1:46:29] steak. I wasn't going to do this, but I
[1:46:31] got to. And I got to get off here
[1:46:33] somewhere. I got about 10 10 stories I
[1:46:36] want to tell. We ain't started, but I'm
[1:46:39] going to tell this one and we're going
[1:46:40] to
[1:46:42] close. Maybe
[1:46:44] two. The prophet said there was a young
[1:46:47] man.
[1:46:48] There was a young man, no doubt a good
[1:46:53] citizen. He said, 'But he was a good
[1:46:55] citizen of the country, but spells would
[1:46:57] come on him. And he said spells would
[1:47:00] come on him and he would get so bad that
[1:47:02] the prisons couldn't hold him. He said
[1:47:05] they bound him with
[1:47:06] chains, he had a legion of devils in
[1:47:10] him.
[1:47:12] 6,000 devils.
[1:47:17] This is a bad
[1:47:19] character. This is a bad bad
[1:47:23] character. And he said they couldn't
[1:47:25] hold him. He was in the graveyard. They
[1:47:27] put him out there and he would take the
[1:47:29] slabs. Think about that. The slabs of
[1:47:32] marble and he was under such possession
[1:47:34] that he would take those slabs and cut
[1:47:36] and tear
[1:47:38] himself. That's not an easy task.
[1:47:43] But he would cut and tear
[1:47:45] himself. He said, "But one
[1:47:48] day, one day he met Jesus." He said,
[1:47:52] "One day he met Jesus." And from that
[1:47:55] time,
[1:47:58] he drove a stake.
[1:48:00] He drove a steak. That maniac drove a
[1:48:02] steak right there. And he met Jesus. And
[1:48:04] he said, "From that time,
[1:48:07] he was never the same. When he met
[1:48:09] Jesus, he became a gentleman. He said he
[1:48:13] could go back home a gentleman and be
[1:48:15] back with his family as a gentleman
[1:48:17] because from that time he could say,
[1:48:20] "I've been
[1:48:29] changed." You say, "Well, that sounds
[1:48:31] good. That sounds good. You can tell us
[1:48:33] all the stories. You can tell us about
[1:48:35] Joshua and Caleb and and blind
[1:48:37] Barnameus. You can tell us about deaf
[1:48:39] ears. You can tell us about the maniac.
[1:48:40] You can tell us about all those things
[1:48:42] that happened in Jesus'
[1:48:48] time. I got to do it.
[1:48:52] I'm not going to get into the full
[1:48:53] details, but I've got his permission to
[1:48:55] tell this story. Sister Sarah, I got his
[1:49:00] permission. That mama back there
[1:49:02] cried and she cried for a
[1:49:07] prodal. My
[1:49:10] nephew as a child who was the
[1:49:12] sweetest, the most caring, the most
[1:49:16] loving young man that you would ever
[1:49:19] meet. But something happened on the
[1:49:22] inside. Something scarred him so bad and
[1:49:25] hurt him so bad that he turned to an
[1:49:27] outside resource.
[1:49:32] She kept
[1:49:34] praying. She kept
[1:49:37] praying. A year, two years. How many
[1:49:41] Sarah?
[1:49:43] Five. Five years bound by chains and
[1:49:49] torment. Five years addicted. Five years
[1:49:54] of holding on to pain that he could not
[1:49:56] control. That he had no control over.
[1:49:59] Five years
[1:50:03] tormented, God had begun to deal with
[1:50:06] me. I knew I had to go see him. I just
[1:50:09] didn't know
[1:50:12] when. So, as conversations go, can I
[1:50:16] have a few minutes here? As
[1:50:18] conversations
[1:50:20] go, there was an opportunity and God
[1:50:23] said, "Now's the time."
[1:50:25] So I told her, I said, 'I'm going to the
[1:50:27] house. You think he'll talk to me? She
[1:50:30] said, 'I don't know if he'll talk to
[1:50:33] anybody. So I go and I pull up and I
[1:50:36] ring or a knock on the door, I can't
[1:50:38] remember which, and he comes door. I
[1:50:40] say, "Hey
[1:50:41] buddy, what you doing?" I'm just hanging
[1:50:44] out. So I go in, I began to just talk to
[1:50:47] him and say, "Hey, I just want you to
[1:50:49] know you don't always have to live this
[1:50:53] way." And I want you to know that I'm
[1:50:55] here for you. Your mama's here for you.
[1:50:58] Your family's here for
[1:51:00] you. But more importantly, God is here
[1:51:02] for
[1:51:03] you. He played it
[1:51:06] off. So I said, "Well, I'm not going to
[1:51:09] ask him to pray. I'm not going to do any
[1:51:10] of that. I'm just going to let him know
[1:51:11] I'm here for you." So I
[1:51:15] left. Little time goes by.
[1:51:19] God begins to move and God begins to
[1:51:23] work on the inside,
[1:51:25] man. He can't live like this anymore.
[1:51:28] Are you with me?
[1:51:32] Prayers have been been rotating through
[1:51:34] the
[1:51:36] heavens. Desperation, cries of
[1:51:38] desperation been been rotating through
[1:51:40] the
[1:51:41] heavens and God heard the
[1:51:44] prayers. and he comes a and God begins
[1:51:48] to deal with
[1:51:49] him and he begins to DT detox for if you
[1:51:55] don't know the words the
[1:51:57] terminology says okay he told me it was
[1:52:01] it'll help
[1:52:06] people begins to shake and quiver and
[1:52:10] anger begins to boil out of him and she
[1:52:13] called and it's I can tell you I won't
[1:52:15] put you a stake in the ground. I'm going
[1:52:17] to let you know the day. I don't know
[1:52:19] the date, but I know the day. Brother
[1:52:20] Kadre Diggs was here to
[1:52:22] preach. We were in that study right
[1:52:25] there. She said, "I'm going to come." He
[1:52:26] said, "He wants y'all to pray with him.
[1:52:28] He can't do
[1:52:30] this." We sat back there, Brother Ber
[1:52:32] and myself prayed with
[1:52:34] him. And we begin to pray for him and
[1:52:36] and talk to him and tried to encourage
[1:52:38] him. And Brother Ber had duties and to
[1:52:40] take care of out here. And so I just sat
[1:52:43] back there and I said, "Are you serious
[1:52:46] about
[1:52:47] this?" Yeah, I can't live like this no
[1:52:55] more. And I said, "God's here to help
[1:53:02] you." I've debated for months if I want
[1:53:05] to say this, but I'm going to say this
[1:53:07] because it'll help somebody.
[1:53:12] He said, "I hate your
[1:53:20] God." I said, "You don't mean that." He
[1:53:23] said, "Why would God allow me to go
[1:53:26] through what I've gone through? Why
[1:53:28] would God allow the things that's
[1:53:29] happened to me happened to me? Why has
[1:53:32] God allowed me to have to go down this
[1:53:34] road if he's such a loving God?
[1:53:41] And I told him, I said, "There's been
[1:53:44] choices
[1:53:45] made. Choices that you had no control
[1:53:48] over, decisions made." I said, "But
[1:53:50] you've got a choice,
[1:53:54] too." Can I just tell you how honest I
[1:53:56] was with him? And Lord forgive me. Let
[1:53:58] me step around
[1:54:01] here. I said, "Listen here, Cody."
[1:54:05] I said, "You you got you got
[1:54:07] choices." I said, "You can be the
[1:54:10] kind, the loving, the gentle Cody that
[1:54:15] you once
[1:54:16] was, or you can be the
[1:54:22] butthole." Forgive me, but that's what I
[1:54:24] told him. But it got his attention in
[1:54:27] such a way that he began to realize,
[1:54:28] I've got choices to make in this. I've
[1:54:31] got decisions to make. And he began to
[1:54:33] begin to toil over these decisions. And
[1:54:35] he began to think over these decisions.
[1:54:37] And we began to pray. And we began to
[1:54:39] think. And he got so
[1:54:41] angry because we made him
[1:54:46] stay. And his mama said, "Do you want to
[1:54:48] go home, Cody?" I said, "He ain't going
[1:54:50] home." He said he was going to stay. If
[1:54:52] we prayed for him, he was going to stay.
[1:54:53] I said, "He ain't going home." I said,
[1:54:54] "That's your mama talking. I'm your
[1:54:58] uncle. You ain't going home.
[1:55:02] Take me home. No, you're staying right
[1:55:06] here. He
[1:55:10] stayed. God made doors open that would
[1:55:14] allow him to get the help that he
[1:55:16] needed. God be to move onto the scene.
[1:55:19] God began to go into him and he began to
[1:55:21] tenderize him and God be to help him
[1:55:23] through the struggles because I told
[1:55:24] him, I said, "What you're fixing to go
[1:55:26] through, you're going to have to fight.
[1:55:29] This is going to be the hardest hardest
[1:55:32] weeks of your life that you've ever went
[1:55:34] through. I've seen detox. I've seen
[1:55:38] babies addicted to heroin. I've seen
[1:55:40] babies that were born into homes that
[1:55:42] were full of of heroin and cocaine. And
[1:55:45] I've seen them shake and I've seen them
[1:55:47] quiver. And I've seen them cry. And it's
[1:55:49] no different whether it's a baby or or
[1:55:51] an adult.
[1:56:00] Things began to
[1:56:05] change. Little by little, God was moving
[1:56:08] in his
[1:56:09] heart. Little by little, when Sarah
[1:56:13] would go to Murphy'sboro to visit with
[1:56:16] Kaye, he worked up the courage to come
[1:56:18] to church. That
[1:56:22] right? And he sat
[1:56:24] there, God began to move. God began to
[1:56:27] deal. God began to
[1:56:29] work. It wasn't
[1:56:32] long he would go on his own on Wednesday
[1:56:36] night.
[1:56:38] Tenderizing, God moving, God God doing
[1:56:42] something. He told me the other day, he
[1:56:44] said, you know, I had to go, he has to
[1:56:45] go to this program, and it's it's it's
[1:56:48] okay that I tell you this, but he has to
[1:56:49] go to this program. He he's he's
[1:56:50] committed to it and he's got to finish
[1:56:52] it. But he said the woman there began to
[1:56:54] talk about uh the uh about Catholicism
[1:56:57] and and and this that and the other. And
[1:56:59] he said he said, "Listen, I'm
[1:57:05] leaving." She said, "Why?" He said, "Cuz
[1:57:08] I don't care a thing about your
[1:57:10] Catholicism. It was Jesus Christ who
[1:57:12] died for me."
[1:57:15] God began to move on the scene.
[1:57:23] He lives in a home and he and he lives
[1:57:25] there and he's got kind of under
[1:57:26] supervision, I guess. And I think it's
[1:57:28] kind of comical now, but they tell him
[1:57:31] said, "You you're coming in too late.
[1:57:32] You're staying out on Wednesday. You're
[1:57:34] coming in too late." He said, "Kick me
[1:57:35] out. If it means I'm can't go to church,
[1:57:38] just kick me
[1:57:41] out." You say, "What? What do you say
[1:57:43] all this for?" I'm going to say this
[1:57:44] because somebody was contending.
[1:57:47] Somebody was contending for this for for
[1:57:50] Cody. Somebody his mama was contending.
[1:57:52] His family was contending. And we wanted
[1:57:54] to God to move in his life. And for
[1:57:56] somebody to say that they dislike God so
[1:57:59] much and then to come right here through
[1:58:00] this prayer line with both hands up and
[1:58:02] say, "I just want God to fill me with
[1:58:04] the Holy
[1:58:06] Ghost. Don't tell me my God's not alive.
[1:58:10] Don't tell me he's still not doing the
[1:58:12] things that he done in those days.
[1:58:19] There was a story I read here just the
[1:58:21] other day. True
[1:58:23] story. True story. Young lady, she was
[1:58:26] in a horrific
[1:58:27] accident and she was trapped in a car
[1:58:31] and she was trapped in the car and and a
[1:58:33] in the middle of the wreckage. She the
[1:58:35] rescuers couldn't free her and she was
[1:58:36] bleeding to death and and slowly and
[1:58:39] little by little the blood was draining
[1:58:41] out of her body and one of the
[1:58:43] paramedics stood there and he was
[1:58:44] holding her hand as she was bleeding out
[1:58:46] and slowly starting to fade away and the
[1:58:49] young girl looked up at the paramedic
[1:58:50] and said, "Will you pray for
[1:58:53] me?" So he began to pray and as he began
[1:58:57] to
[1:58:59] pray, God came on the scene. as he began
[1:59:03] to pray about that time a man get this
[1:59:06] now a man steps out of a cornfield
[1:59:08] dressed in a suit packing a
[1:59:11] Bible. You say you're making this up.
[1:59:13] I'm not making it up.
[1:59:16] Eyewitnesses document it. And this man
[1:59:19] walks out of the cornfield in a suit
[1:59:20] packing a Bible and he walks over there
[1:59:22] and he says, "I'm here to pray for you."
[1:59:26] That man begins to lay his hands on her
[1:59:28] and he lays her hands on her and people
[1:59:30] are taking pictures of this
[1:59:34] scene. All of a
[1:59:36] sudden, the bleeding stops. All of a
[1:59:40] sudden, her breath returns to normal
[1:59:42] breathing rate. All of a sudden, her
[1:59:44] blood pressure returns to normal. All of
[1:59:47] a sudden, she's alert and oriented. And
[1:59:50] as they look around, this man's nowhere
[1:59:51] to be found.
[1:59:55] The rescuers finally get her out of the
[1:59:57] car and she's asking questions. Who was
[1:59:59] that that prayed for me? I want to thank
[2:00:01] him. They said, 'I don't know, but there
[2:00:03] was people taking pictures all over.
[2:00:04] Just to go find the picture, we'll find
[2:00:06] out who it is. You know how many
[2:00:08] pictures he appeared in? Zero. Zero.
[2:00:12] He stood right beside the paramedic
[2:00:15] and prayed with the paramedic and he
[2:00:18] says, "I don't know who he
[2:00:20] was. Don't tell me.
[2:00:24] God can't work on the scene.
[2:00:30] But sometimes we have to
[2:00:33] fight. I'll close with
[2:00:36] this. Brother Brandham told the story.
[2:00:39] He says, you know, it's not the size of
[2:00:42] the of the dog in the fight, but it's
[2:00:44] the size of the fight in the dog.
[2:00:47] And he said that always stood out to me.
[2:00:50] And he said it was in that football
[2:00:51] stadium right above the header when they
[2:00:53] would go out onto the field. That way
[2:00:54] that those guys every time they went
[2:00:56] underneath it they could look up there
[2:00:58] say we may not be the biggest, we may
[2:01:01] not be the baddest. We may not have the
[2:01:03] most money. We may not be the loudest.
[2:01:05] We may not be this or we may not be
[2:01:07] that. But one thing about it we got is
[2:01:09] we got fight. and they can look at that
[2:01:12] sign and say, "No matter what, I've got
[2:01:14] fight." And he says that he says, "Let
[2:01:17] me tell you, if you'll get the devil on
[2:01:19] the run,
[2:01:21] don't let him run over you, but you get
[2:01:23] the devil on the run." And you show him
[2:01:25] what size he is and you get a little
[2:01:28] grit about yourself. Oh, we need
[2:01:30] Christians with grit in this hour.
[2:01:34] And then you can claim your
[2:01:36] Godgiven privileges in Jesus Christ.
[2:01:40] Let's stand to our
[2:01:42] feet. You love the Lord
[2:01:48] tonight. Oh
[2:01:51] man, God sure is good to us. He's on
[2:01:55] time. He's on time. When it looks like
[2:01:58] it it's over, when it looks like it's
[2:01:59] it's defeated, when it looks like that
[2:02:01] that you can't do nothing about it,
[2:02:03] there he comes arriving on the scene.
[2:02:05] Why? Cuz you're fighting. You're
[2:02:06] contending. You're moving. You're asking
[2:02:08] God to move on the
[2:02:12] scene. You think about
[2:02:16] David. We need some all night services
[2:02:18] is what we need. What you think about
[2:02:20] David? Brother Bam said he goes there
[2:02:22] and he picks up those five little
[2:02:24] stones. He said he picks up those five
[2:02:26] stones, Jesus, and puts them in his five
[2:02:29] little fingers, fa I
[2:02:33] t. and he begins to sling that
[2:02:37] stone. And you know, I often wondered,
[2:02:40] and this is just my thinking, so take it
[2:02:42] with a grain of salt. Why did he need
[2:02:44] five stones if it was
[2:02:47] Goliath? Well, I got to thinking, I got
[2:02:49] to study and look, and some people think
[2:02:51] that there was more than just one giant.
[2:02:53] If there was one, it could have been
[2:02:54] more. They said he had brothers,
[2:02:56] right? So, I can just imagine David say,
[2:02:58] "You know what? One's not enough. Well,
[2:03:01] I'm not just going to take down one
[2:03:03] giant, but if any of the others want to
[2:03:04] come and combat against me, I'm going to
[2:03:06] take them out, too. Bring it on, Satan.
[2:03:10] And that's the kind of the attitude we
[2:03:11] need to have. Bring it on, Satan.
[2:03:14] Let's bow our
[2:03:16] heads. We'll sing that song that you
[2:03:18] sang at the beginning there. On time,
[2:03:20] God. Sister Becky, Lord, we just come
[2:03:22] before you. We've held the people way
[2:03:24] too long tonight. Forgive us. Forgive
[2:03:25] me, Lord. It wasn't my intentions, but
[2:03:28] there was just I just felt like so much
[2:03:32] so much that we were gaining and so much
[2:03:34] that we were moving under inspiration
[2:03:37] on, Lord, and just helping tonight,
[2:03:39] Lord. So, forgive me for holding the
[2:03:41] people too long. Would you see them with
[2:03:42] safe travels home? Help us, Lord, as in
[2:03:45] the weeks to come to fight, to be
[2:03:47] earnestly contending for the faith that
[2:03:50] you placed in our life to we can have
[2:03:51] and see the same things take place in
[2:03:53] our lives as in the days of the Bible.
[2:03:55] because we know that you're the same
[2:03:56] yesterday, today, and forever. And
[2:03:58] sometimes it may look dreer. Sometimes
[2:04:00] it may look gloomy. Sometimes it may
[2:04:02] look like it's not going to happen. But
[2:04:04] you always show up on time as long as we
[2:04:07] still fight. So help us, Lord, in this
[2:04:10] hour to be fighters for what you have in
[2:04:13] store for us. Help us to drive a stake
[2:04:16] over depression, over anxiety, drive a
[2:04:18] stake over fear and and and the
[2:04:21] pressures of this life, the things that
[2:04:23] hold us
[2:04:24] back. and to say, "From this day, from
[2:04:27] this time, Satan, I'll never be the same
[2:04:30] because God arrived on the
[2:04:34] scene." Amen. Amen. Well, he's an
[2:04:38] ontime
[2:04:40] God. Yes, he
[2:04:42] [Music]
[2:04:44] is. He's an on time
[2:04:48] God. Yes, he is.
[2:04:52] [Music]
[2:04:53] Job said he may not come when you want
[2:04:57] him, but he'll be there right on
[2:05:01] time. Cuz he's an on time
[2:05:05] God. Yes, he is once again.
[2:05:10] Well, he's an on time
[2:05:14] God. Yes, he is.
[2:05:17] [Applause]
[2:05:19] He's an old time
[2:05:22] God. Yes, he
[2:05:26] is. Well, he may not come when you want
[2:05:31] him, but he'll be there right on
[2:05:35] time. Well, he's an on time
[2:05:39] God. Yes, he is. You got the
[2:05:43] verses. Well, you can ask the children
[2:05:47] of
[2:05:48] Israel trapped at the Red
[2:05:51] [Applause]
[2:05:53] Sea. By that mean old
[2:05:57] Pharaoh and his
[2:06:00] army. They had water all around them and
[2:06:06] old Pharaoh at their back.
[2:06:10] But out of nowhere, God stepped in and
[2:06:14] built a highway just like that. I tell
[2:06:18] you, he's an on time
[2:06:21] God. Yes, he
[2:06:25] is. Well, he's an on time
