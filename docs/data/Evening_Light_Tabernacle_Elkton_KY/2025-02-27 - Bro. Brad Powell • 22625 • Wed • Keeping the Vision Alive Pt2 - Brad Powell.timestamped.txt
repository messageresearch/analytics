[39:02] in our Bibles we we have a lot on the
[39:04] plate tonight but I think we
[39:06] can get out at a decent hour and we
[39:10] wanted to just go ahead and continue the
[39:11] thought of where we were at the other
[39:13] day and and we'll just would title this
[39:16] if we would keeping the vision alive
[39:18] part two and turn in your Bibles uh
[39:22] first
[39:23] Peter uh chapter 4 we'll start there
[39:29] how many's having a good week say amen
[39:31] that's good to hear if you're having a
[39:33] bad week say oh
[39:36] me that's good to hear
[39:38] too no
[39:42] responses first Peter
[39:47] 4:12 beloved think it not strange
[39:50] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[39:54] try you as though some strange thing
[39:57] happened unto you think it not
[40:01] strange think about that think it not
[40:04] strange concerning the fiery trial for
[40:07] which is to try you as though some
[40:09] strange things happened to you so it's
[40:11] saying why we don't look at look at our
[40:13] trials and say why why why is this
[40:15] strange thing happening to
[40:21] me but
[40:24] rejoice in as much as you are partakers
[40:26] of Christ
[40:29] sufferings that when his glory shall be
[40:31] revealed you may be glad also with
[40:33] exceeding Joy if ye be reproached for
[40:36] the name of Christ happy are ye for the
[40:39] spirit of glor of glory and of God
[40:42] resteth upon you on their part he is
[40:45] evil spoken of but on your part he is
[40:49] glorified so they can speak all the evil
[40:51] they want against you and and the way
[40:53] you live and the way you look and the
[40:55] way you act but all glor GL is still
[40:57] given to God when they speak the evil
[40:59] they're giving glory to
[41:01] God the devil can't win it's about time
[41:05] he understands
[41:06] that but let none of you suffer as a
[41:09] murderer as a thief or as an evildoer or
[41:11] as a busy body in other men's matters I
[41:14] like that one because you know that's
[41:15] one thing that a lot of people try to do
[41:17] is is uh they want to be busy bodies in
[41:19] other people's
[41:21] business yeah yeah that's it's not for
[41:24] me to tell somebody else how to live
[41:26] right or to try to oversee the way they
[41:28] act or the way they do that's that's
[41:30] between them and
[41:33] God yet if any man suffer as a Christian
[41:36] how many Christians do we have
[41:38] here that's talking to you if any man
[41:40] suffer as a Christian let him not be
[41:43] ashamed but let him glorify God on his
[41:46] behalf so no matter if you're if you're
[41:49] suffering today no matter what trial
[41:51] you're going through you have no reason
[41:53] to be ashamed When Trials come there's
[41:56] no reason to be ashamed
[41:59] there's no reason to be critical of
[42:00] other people's
[42:01] trials because that's one thing we see a
[42:03] lot of times people do oh he must be
[42:05] really into something because look at
[42:07] all he's going through he must be living
[42:11] some way he shouldn't be living he must
[42:13] be doing things he shouldn't be doing or
[42:15] he wouldn't be going through the kinds
[42:17] of things he's going through he wouldn't
[42:19] be going through the hardships and the
[42:21] challenges his kids wouldn't be doing
[42:23] these things if they wasn't living the
[42:25] way they should or shouldn't live
[42:29] come on come
[42:32] on but if any man suffer as a Christian
[42:35] let him not be ashamed I'm not
[42:37] ashamed God every I tell you we've been
[42:39] talking and we've been going on this and
[42:41] brother B's been saying this minut a
[42:42] visiting ministers I'm not ashamed of
[42:45] the things I've had to go through
[42:46] because the things I've had to go
[42:48] through is what's made me who I am the
[42:51] things you go through is what makes you
[42:53] who you are the things that Joseph went
[42:56] through are the things that made him
[42:58] what he was in God's
[43:01] Vision keep the vision no M no matter
[43:04] where you're
[43:05] at Genesis chapter 39 we're going to
[43:09] pick up here where we where we left off
[43:10] forgive me if I cough some tonight we've
[43:13] we had that cro last last week
[43:15] congestion and infection and we're
[43:17] trying to get over it
[43:19] okay we are over
[43:25] it and Joseph was brought down to Egypt
[43:29] and potterer an officer of pharaoh
[43:31] captain of the guard of the an Egyptian
[43:34] bought him out of the hands of the
[43:35] Israelites remember that now which he
[43:38] which had brought him down thither and
[43:40] the Lord was with Joseph isn't it
[43:43] amazing thing that when Joseph just got
[43:45] out of the pit been sold into slavery
[43:47] into into a life of bondage it wasn't
[43:50] because he done anything wrong it wasn't
[43:51] because he was a secret sinner it wasn't
[43:53] because he was doing any of those things
[43:55] that anybody shouldn't have been doing
[43:56] but God was still with him and he was
[44:01] prosperous you mean in all your
[44:03] adversities and all your hardships when
[44:05] you're down in the dumps when the when
[44:07] the world is dark and dreary and gloomy
[44:09] and and it looks like there's no way out
[44:11] and you have no hope you're still
[44:13] prosperous and God is still with you how
[44:15] many can say
[44:16] amen and his master saw that the Lord
[44:20] was with him you mean an Egyptian potier
[44:23] had enough wisdom that he could see with
[44:25] his eyes he had a vision
[44:27] look at who this man
[44:29] is Piper looked at this and said man I
[44:32] don't know who what what kind of God he
[44:34] serves because I certainly don't serve
[44:35] him but whoever he serves is with him
[44:38] and he makes everything he does
[44:41] prosper that's my
[44:44] God and Joseph found Grace in his sight
[44:47] and he served him and made him overseer
[44:51] so now Joseph is the Man In Charge he's
[44:53] the man of the hour he he made him the
[44:56] over Seer over his house and over all
[44:58] that he had he put into his hands and it
[45:01] came to pass from that time that he had
[45:03] made him Overseer in his house and over
[45:06] all that he had that the Lord blessed
[45:08] the Egyptians house for Joseph's
[45:11] sake so you mean all the struggles all
[45:14] the hardships all the when things look
[45:17] so grim and dark and and God was still
[45:19] working things out for Joseph's sake
[45:23] through the house of an Egyptian
[45:27] are you with me think about this and he
[45:31] left all that he had in Joseph's hand
[45:33] and he knew uh knew not ought that he
[45:36] had and saved bread which he did eat and
[45:38] Joseph was goodly person and well
[45:40] favored and it came to pass after these
[45:42] things that his master's Wife cast her
[45:44] eyes upon Joseph and she said lie with
[45:48] me let's just bow our heads Heavenly
[45:50] Father we just come before you tonight
[45:51] with grateful Hearts thankful Lord for
[45:54] healthy bodies to be able to come into
[45:56] the house tonight and draw strength from
[45:58] you draw strength from your word and
[46:00] draw strength from your wisdom father
[46:02] lead us and guide us tonight help me to
[46:04] allow myself out of the way that you
[46:06] could just speak freely to us tonight
[46:09] that you would just anoint our ears to
[46:11] hear what you would have for us
[46:12] encourage us father Lift us up and lead
[46:15] us and guide us as we want to serve you
[46:17] in a greater way in the days to come in
[46:20] Jesus name amen you can have your seats
[46:24] tonight so I want you to not noce and in
[46:27] reading our text tonight that Joseph
[46:30] remember now he was a young man about
[46:31] the age of 17 and we know that Joseph
[46:34] was a young man of vision we know that
[46:37] the Lord had had used Joseph and he had
[46:40] looked at Joseph and he was very
[46:41] favorable upon Joseph and revealing to
[46:44] Joseph of what would happen in his life
[46:47] he was very favorable and and telling
[46:50] him what his gifts were he showed him
[46:52] what his purpose was going to be and but
[46:55] for some strange turn of events in the
[46:58] in and down the road we see that he
[47:01] would find that his own
[47:03] family his own Brothers despised by 10
[47:07] of his own Brothers doubted by his own
[47:11] father that that someday they would find
[47:14] themselves paying homage to Joseph
[47:17] someday they would find themselves
[47:19] through the circumstances of life to be
[47:21] bowing down at the very
[47:24] feet of Joseph
[47:27] and even though he had been mocked by
[47:29] his family think about this he'd been
[47:31] abused by his brothers he'd been left
[47:33] for dead in the very bowels of the
[47:36] earth and he was sold into slavery and
[47:39] bondage brothers and sisters Joseph did
[47:41] not allow circumstances of
[47:44] life he did not allow the circumstances
[47:47] of life to determine the outcome of his
[47:54] vision you see he knew that God had
[47:56] given him that that Vision he knew that
[47:58] someday no matter what down the road his
[48:01] brothers would bow down at his
[48:04] feet circumstances will come in your
[48:07] life circumstances will go in your life
[48:10] and then circumstances will come again
[48:12] in your
[48:14] life don't let the circumstances out out
[48:17] Shadow the outcome of the vision so when
[48:19] your life seems to be overtaken by
[48:22] despair it's important that we realize
[48:24] and we know that God is still in control
[48:26] when there's troubles and trials and
[48:28] there's there's there's disarray that
[48:30] God is still the comforter it's it's
[48:33] it's nice to know when you're laying
[48:35] there sick and you're on your back and
[48:37] you're laying there sick and you're
[48:39] wondering some of you's been
[48:41] there and you're wondering God how can I
[48:44] ever get over this am I ever going to
[48:46] get well will I ever quit coughing will
[48:48] I ever get a good night's sleep will I
[48:50] ever get out of this pain it's good to
[48:53] know that in those times that God is
[48:56] still the great physician and that God
[48:59] still heals all the diseases of your
[49:02] body all of the diseases listen to what
[49:05] Psalms 103 says praise the Lord my soul
[49:08] and forget not all of his
[49:12] benefits all forget not all of his
[49:15] benefits brothers and sisters there's
[49:17] benefits related to
[49:21] Calvary the benefits of Calvary are
[49:24] Redemption the benefits of Calvary are
[49:26] hope hope their Deliverance their love
[49:29] it's
[49:31] healing it's Deliverance Listen to It's

[49:43] on my knees and I cry out God I need you
[49:46] in this hour and he's there to deliver
[49:49] in the hour of
[49:51] need the benefits of Calvary tells us
[49:54] that we can have victory over sin

[50:03] your life the benefits of Calvary tells
[50:06] me I can have victory over
[50:09] Satan that I have a right to push back
[50:12] as brother Bor said on Sunday when Satan
[50:15] comes and puts his fo weight against me
[50:17] I push back that is the benefits of the
[50:20] victory of Calvary the benefits of
[50:23] Calvary tells me I have victory over
[50:25] death
[50:27] There Is No Death as I've said in a
[50:28] Believer so I have victory tonight over
[50:30] the
[50:32] death that's the benefits of Calvary and
[50:35] Psalms 103 praise ye the Lord of my soul
[50:38] forget not all of his benefits who heals
[50:42] all your
[50:44] diseases so brothers and sisters we have
[50:47] a great benefactor in Jesus Christ
[50:50] today and I got to looking at this and I
[50:52] I've looked at this wrong for so long
[50:54] and then I I finally got to breaking it
[50:55] down and I thought the
[50:57] benefactor the benefactor is the one who
[51:00] creates the estate plan oh come on the
[51:04] benefactor Jesus Christ he's the one
[51:07] that said if I go to
[51:09] Calvary my estate says that you can be
[51:12] the beneficiary of all of these benefits
[51:15] that was placed on the cross of
[51:18] Calvary I'm the benefactor I'm going to
[51:21] give it to you he said everything that I
[51:24] have I'm going to give it to you so
[51:26] Jesus as the benefactor gives us all
[51:28] these
[51:30] blessings Jesus gives you as a
[51:32] benefactor he gives you overcoming
[51:34] power Jesus as a benefactor he gives you
[51:37] the healing in your body he gives you
[51:40] the the the the Forgiveness of of of
[51:42] your
[51:42] enemies that's important brothers and
[51:45] sisters you have to be able to forgive
[51:47] your
[51:48] enemies you'll see here in the life of
[51:51] Joseph he had to forgive enemy after
[51:53] enemy after enemy
[51:57] why is it so important because if you
[51:58] hold on to that if you hold on to those
[52:02] grudges if if you hold on to those those
[52:06] things that have set you back from other
[52:08] people you'll never go
[52:11] nowhere they'll keep going on with life
[52:13] and you'll sit there in the muddle and
[52:15] the mire and in your distress and in
[52:17] your mully grub just wondering how can
[52:19] they get by with doing
[52:23] this thank you brother Steve it will eat
[52:26] you up
[52:27] up it'll tear your heart out it'll ruin
[52:30] your walk with the Lord it'll ruin your
[52:32] walk with within your
[52:35] family that's why forgiveness is so
[52:38] important and Jesus tells us we are the
[52:41] named
[52:43] beneficiaries and as the beneficiaries
[52:46] brothers and sisters we have a right to
[52:48] obtain all that Jesus has envisioned for
[52:51] us to
[52:53] have you know when you go get an
[52:55] insurance policy
[52:58] my wife has a little insurance policy on
[52:59] me and I'm one on her if one of us die
[53:02] surely we can get in the
[53:06] ground but if I die it says that she is
[53:10] the
[53:11] beneficiary of that
[53:14] policy it doesn't say
[53:17] Weston no it doesn't say
[53:20] Carson joce pal is the beneficiary upon
[53:24] the death of me
[53:27] none of you can be my Ben can be the
[53:29] beneficiary of my
[53:35] policy we are the beneficiaries of the
[53:39] benefits of Calvary in other words we
[53:42] are the recipients we're the ones that
[53:44] get the the benefits from the planed EST
[53:46] state that God had in the very beginning
[53:49] it was you that was on his mind when he
[53:51] was on the cross it was your sickness it
[53:54] was your distress it was the things that
[53:55] you would go through from point A to
[53:57] point B in that section we call life
[54:01] that he said because he is my child he's
[54:03] my son or he's my daughter he's now my
[54:06] beneficiary upon on my death he receives
[54:10] all that I have written for
[54:20] him and you know what the good thing is
[54:22] about the beneficiary once it's given
[54:24] given to the person who's the recipient
[54:26] there's nothing that a court nothing
[54:28] that any lawyer nothing any judge can do
[54:31] to take that away because you know why
[54:33] the debt has been
[54:37] paid the debt has been paid so what are
[54:40] we waiting for tonight it's time that we
[54:42] cash in on our
[54:44] benefits what good does it do you to
[54:46] have a policy like this and you never
[54:49] cash it
[54:51] in she can have she can have 15 Life
[54:54] policies on me and if I die and if she
[54:56] never takes it to an attorney and says
[54:57] hey how do I cash these
[55:00] in she'll never get a
[55:02] dime they can sit there Idol they can
[55:05] set in a safe box in a kitchen drawer
[55:07] wherever you want to put your items but
[55:09] there would never be a dividend paid to
[55:12] her as long as she doesn't accept what
[55:15] the what the writing of the document
[55:23] says the prophet says it this way he
[55:25] said God
[55:29] fora God had a
[55:32] vision God fora he said God had a vision
[55:36] he says God forsaw the bride and the
[55:40] groom he said he fora the bride and the
[55:43] groom Hallelujah to save his wife like
[55:46] Adam he had to go with her Adam knew
[55:49] what he was doing Eve didn't know what
[55:51] she was doing but Adam walked out with
[55:54] his wife
[56:03] he said listen now and Jesus took his
[56:08] wife he took his wife's
[56:12] Place Jesus took his wife's place and he
[56:16] became sin for her so let me ask you are
[56:19] you in the vision
[56:22] tonight you have to see yourself in that
[56:24] Vision tonight he took his wife's place
[56:27] and he became remember he says he became
[56:30] you he stood your
[56:36] punishment you mean it was my
[56:39] punishment it was your punishment it was
[56:42] the Wicked Deeds you done it was the bad
[56:45] that you done the the the the the
[56:47] inappropriate thoughts that you had in
[56:49] your
[56:50] mind it was the evil thoughts that you
[56:53] walked upon day after day as a sinner
[56:57] it was your drinking it was your
[56:58] carousing it was your
[57:01] drugging yeah he stood your punishment
[57:05] he said and that you might stand in his
[57:08] place he said he stood in your place
[57:10] that you might stand in his place what
[57:12] love what a
[57:13] fellowship what a love and what a
[57:16] fellowship that Jesus has brothers and
[57:17] sisters Joseph wasn't alone in that pit
[57:20] and you'll never be alone in your
[57:22] pit Joseph was in that pit but he wasn't
[57:26] alone in the pit when it seemed like he
[57:29] was in the deepest darkest day of his
[57:32] life God was standing there with
[57:39] him can you imagine the emptiness in the
[57:42] pit of his stomach when he got cast into
[57:45] that
[57:46] prison had done nothing
[57:49] wrong an innocent
[57:52] man sentenced to prison
[57:56] and now he is cast down in this prison
[57:58] can you imagine the hollow in the pit of
[58:00] his stomach but he never stood
[58:05] alone God don't let his children stand
[58:08] alone and we don't stand alone in this
[58:10] hour and no matter what comes our way
[58:12] God is standing right there through the
[58:14] Holy Ghost and it's through the power of
[58:17] the Holy Ghost that we find our
[58:18] overcoming power he says the Holy Ghost
[58:21] in This last day as promised is like the
[58:23] abstract title deeden
[58:27] wow now listen to this this is
[58:31] important we're just going to teach a
[58:33] little bit and preach a little bit and
[58:34] we'll go as long as we can go
[58:38] and but this this this this is this is
[58:41] good
[58:42] stuff somebody told me one time said you
[58:44] you shouldn't say that's good stuff well
[58:48] it's good
[58:50] stuff I don't know any other way to put
[58:52] it brother Bor when I dig into the word
[58:54] of God and I begin to see myself in the
[58:56] book and I begin to see the promises
[58:59] that's
[59:01] good the the Bible says when God made
[59:04] this on the first day it was good and on
[59:06] the second day it was good this gets
[59:09] gets more I read it the gooder it gets I
[59:12] don't know any other way to put it but
[59:14] this abstract title a deed it's a
[59:17] summary of a property of legal
[59:20] history it's including all the Deeds the
[59:22] mortgages and the documents that affect
[59:25] the title
[59:26] now we got Realtors here we got Bankers
[59:28] sitting here we got people that bought
[59:30] property here you know what I'm talking
[59:34] about he says and and it's important to
[59:37] know that this deed this abstract title
[59:39] deed it's a key document in any real
[59:43] estate
[59:47] transaction and the prophet says now you
[59:49] can get a
[59:50] title you can get a
[59:53] title I got a title
[59:57] he says you can get a title to a place
[59:58] but that still don't say it's
[1:00:01] yours so that goes right back to what
[1:00:04] we've been talking about that profession
[1:00:06] without a
[1:00:07] possession you know there's a lot of
[1:00:09] Christians out there that profess
[1:00:10] professing
[1:00:12] Christianity but they possess no powers
[1:00:14] to back it up they profess going to a
[1:00:18] message church but there is no power to
[1:00:20] back up there is no evidence there is no
[1:00:23] fruit to back up where they stand
[1:00:26] so what it is that they have a
[1:00:29] title I'm a message believer churchgoing
[1:00:32] Bible tote and
[1:00:33] Christian have you ever opened
[1:00:38] it have you ever dug into it because the
[1:00:42] the way you're living sure don't line up
[1:00:44] with what I've been
[1:00:46] reading I don't know what version you
[1:00:48] listening to or you looking
[1:00:51] at Li the liberal life version I guess I
[1:00:54] don't know
[1:00:58] but he says you can have that title but
[1:01:00] you still don't he can't say it's yours
[1:01:03] but somebody way back Yonder could have
[1:01:06] come and put a claim on
[1:01:09] it now you see are you with me
[1:01:13] now the devil tries to put his claim on
[1:01:17] you you see this is not just any old
[1:01:20] title this is not just any old deed this
[1:01:23] is an abstract
[1:01:26] title there's a difference this is a
[1:01:30] title this right here has been
[1:01:34] proven this right here says my debts
[1:01:37] have been paid on this
[1:01:39] property this says nobody can hold
[1:01:42] claims to anything that God has given me
[1:01:45] in this
[1:01:47] book so it tells me that I'm one of
[1:01:50] God's children so this right here it
[1:01:53] tells me that no matter what it what it
[1:01:56] is in my life that I had to overcome
[1:01:59] it's been
[1:02:04] forgiven you see that's what the devil
[1:02:06] does he tries to put those claims on you
[1:02:08] he tries to tell you you you know you're
[1:02:10] too Wicked to be a child of
[1:02:13] God you're too depressed to ever be
[1:02:16] happy you're too sad to ever have
[1:02:20] joy these are claims he's putting on you
[1:02:24] he's trying to say I'm going to take
[1:02:25] this piece of their property well you
[1:02:27] know you're the doctor said you're way
[1:02:29] too sick to be
[1:02:31] healed that's nothing but a false
[1:02:34] claim you say a false claim yeah that's
[1:02:37] what I'm talking about a false claim he
[1:02:38] can claim all he wants but the the
[1:02:40] mortgage company the title company from
[1:02:43] heaven above has said that there is an
[1:02:45] abstract deed that the debts been paid
[1:02:48] the price has been paid the blood still
[1:02:50] wet on Calvary and we have forgiveness
[1:02:54] we have healing we have have
[1:02:57] Deliverance my deed reads Isaiah 53 it
[1:03:01] says who ha believed this
[1:03:03] report who hath believed this report to
[1:03:06] whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:03:08] revealed that's me I believe this report
[1:03:13] it says he was despised and rejected of
[1:03:15] me and a Man of Sorrows acquainted of
[1:03:17] grief for
[1:03:20] me my deed says that he bore my griefs
[1:03:24] he carried my sorrow
[1:03:27] my deed says that he was wounded for my
[1:03:31] transgressions and the devil can claim
[1:03:34] all he wants to that it wasn't for me
[1:03:36] but my book says the property is
[1:03:39] mine so I've got to write in this hour
[1:03:42] I've got a right with what God has done
[1:03:44] in my life to post a sign on there to
[1:03:46] say devil this property is free and
[1:03:49] clear it's been given to me it's now
[1:03:52] posted no trespassing
[1:03:59] don't make no more claims on me devil
[1:04:02] don't make no more claims on my family
[1:04:05] devil don't make no more claims on the
[1:04:07] things that that that you want me to
[1:04:09] believe because I don't believe
[1:04:10] it you see brothers and sisters when you
[1:04:13] get
[1:04:14] abstract everything he said it shows
[1:04:16] that everything that was ever against it
[1:04:19] listen now has been struck off
[1:04:27] come
[1:04:28] on everything that you ever done every
[1:04:33] Wicked thought every Wicked thing you
[1:04:35] ever said in your mind and in and that
[1:04:37] you looked at or you thought has been
[1:04:40] struck off the Record in other words it
[1:04:43] don't
[1:04:48] exist you know when they was going to
[1:04:50] release I don't know if they ever did
[1:04:51] those JFK files and MLK files and all
[1:04:54] that all that stuff is is all going to
[1:04:57] be blacked out you a going to read it
[1:04:58] anyway it don't matter what they turned
[1:05:00] loose it was all going to be blacked out
[1:05:01] and you you're not going to know what it
[1:05:04] said that's the way my god
[1:05:06] did my faults my failures my
[1:05:10] weaknesses he didn't do
[1:05:14] that take that big fat Sharpie
[1:05:18] marker and just start wiping that
[1:05:21] out he didn't do
[1:05:23] that he says and and and this man that
[1:05:26] believes the word and then the Holy
[1:05:28] Spirit comes it's an abstract to the
[1:05:30] title and that gives you permission when
[1:05:33] you have that abstract that every bit of
[1:05:36] that belongs to you and every bit of
[1:05:39] that it belongs to you he said and it
[1:05:41] gives you the abstract when the Holy
[1:05:43] Ghost comes upon this tital deed that
[1:05:45] God saw back Yonder when before the
[1:05:48] foundation of the world so before you

[1:07:08] it struck off and omitted
[1:07:11] everything he's the abstract holder and
[1:07:14] is sure the spirit raised Christ from
[1:07:16] the dead I have an abstract deed that
[1:07:18] I'm part of the body with the abstract
[1:07:20] of the Holy Ghost that in that body word

[1:07:47] said oh my sins are struck out all your
[1:07:50] sins are struck out by the blood of
[1:07:52] Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost has come
[1:07:55] as a abstract to the title deed that God
[1:07:58] has given me by grace and for
[1:08:02] knowledge you know I sleep well at night
[1:08:05] knowing without a doubt that I'm one of
[1:08:10] his I don't have to wake up in the
[1:08:12] morning and wonder I wonder if I'm a
[1:08:14] Child of God
[1:08:17] today I sleep well at night knowing that
[1:08:20] day after day after day there's been a
[1:08:23] price paid for me that I can walk just
[1:08:27] as he walked by his grace and through
[1:08:30] his
[1:08:33] mercy so the prophet says so what are
[1:08:35] you scared
[1:08:37] about you know that's a that's one thing
[1:08:39] a Christian should never be is
[1:08:42] scared what are we scared about but you
[1:08:45] see so many people that are scared
[1:08:47] they're scared of this this sickness
[1:08:49] that sickness and me and somebody was
[1:08:50] talking the other day you know it's easy
[1:08:51] to it's easy to have faith when it ain't
[1:08:53] you the sick
[1:08:55] right let's just be
[1:08:57] honest but when it comes knocking on
[1:09:00] your
[1:09:04] door things
[1:09:08] change I don't wish sickness on
[1:09:11] anybody but sickness causes desperation
[1:09:14] sometimes sickness causes you to examine
[1:09:17] things in a little bit of different
[1:09:23] light what are you scared about no
[1:09:25] wonder he said fear not I am he that was
[1:09:28] dead and alive again I'm alive forever
[1:09:30] more and I had the keys of death and
[1:09:32] Hell listen to what his next statement
[1:09:35] is don't worry about
[1:09:42] nothing don't worry about
[1:09:46] nothing even death ain't going to hurt
[1:09:49] you he said see notice it's
[1:09:53] beautiful don't worry about nothing the
[1:09:57] abstract title and we're good we're
[1:09:59] getting on I promise we're moving the
[1:10:01] abstract title the Deb is settled
[1:10:03] everything against it has been struck
[1:10:04] off haa he said Glory he said I may act
[1:10:08] a little silly but I feel
[1:10:12] good there's a reason we may act a
[1:10:14] little silly because we feel good
[1:10:16] because the word of God says all the
[1:10:19] promises are
[1:10:21] yours he says do you realize what that
[1:10:24] means there is none nothing that can
[1:10:26] take it away from
[1:10:28] you say it I am the holder I you hold
[1:10:33] the title deed in your hand for every
[1:10:36] promise you have need of when we begin
[1:10:39] to realize that and we begin to believe
[1:10:41] it and we begin to see oursel in the
[1:10:43] vision of that we become that Invincible
[1:10:46] Army that he talked
[1:10:48] about have you noticed how things have
[1:10:50] changed over the last few years around
[1:10:52] the word of God around message it's a
[1:10:54] power of overcoming it's a power of
[1:10:57] authority through the word of Jesus
[1:10:58] Christ it's not people no more just just
[1:11:01] wandering or just dilly-dallying and
[1:11:03] dabbling around the word it's people
[1:11:05] that are standing on the word that are
[1:11:07] living the word I told somebody the
[1:11:09] other day I said you know the difference
[1:11:11] I can see in our church the difference
[1:11:13] that I can see in our church is we're
[1:11:14] not just looking for the coming we're
[1:11:16] living the
[1:11:19] coming there's a life that's being lived
[1:11:22] in the Believers in this hour that's
[1:11:23] saying come Lord come
[1:11:26] and what's they talking about come into
[1:11:27] me come into my life come into me and
[1:11:30] fill me with your Holy Ghost so that I
[1:11:32] can be the what everything you want me
[1:11:35] to be that's all Joseph
[1:11:38] wanted all Joseph wanted was to be what
[1:11:41] God wanted him to be we look at his life
[1:11:44] we see that Piper has elevated him to a
[1:11:47] to a place of authority he put him into
[1:11:49] a place of power and I want you to
[1:11:52] notice that the vision is taking place
[1:11:55] right before his very
[1:11:58] eyes but watch how the Devil comes right
[1:12:01] back into the
[1:12:04] scene you know that's the way life is
[1:12:07] it's like a big
[1:12:10] stage sometimes you're in the in the
[1:12:12] Forefront Life's good and everything's
[1:12:13] Grand enter devil stage
[1:12:18] left and he comes creeping in and we see
[1:12:23] here it is it it came out after these
[1:12:26] things after he's been
[1:12:28] elevated after after he's been blessed
[1:12:32] after he's blessed others through his
[1:12:35] ministry I want you to notice that after
[1:12:38] he was delivered out of the
[1:12:40] pit after he was given
[1:12:42] Freedom after he's been
[1:12:45] successful after he's been
[1:12:49] prosperous that's when we think we've
[1:12:51] arrived right oh I made it
[1:12:57] be
[1:12:58] careful that his master's Wife cast her
[1:13:01] eyes upon Joseph and said lie with
[1:13:06] me here comes that old
[1:13:08] devil trying to make
[1:13:11] claims oh you know
[1:13:13] Joseph you know you're interested in
[1:13:17] her look at how beautiful she
[1:13:23] is you don't believe that's what he done
[1:13:26] read what it says verse 10 and it came
[1:13:28] to pass after she spake to Joseph day by
[1:13:32] day so over and over and over and over
[1:13:40] the tempter
[1:13:41] came if you're not being tempted if
[1:13:44] you're not being chased if you're not
[1:13:46] being hounded let that be a warning he's
[1:13:48] probably already got
[1:13:52] you but day after day it said he
[1:13:55] hearkened not unto
[1:13:58] her and refused to be with
[1:14:01] her we go we know the story we go on
[1:14:04] down I'm I'm just going to skip through
[1:14:05] some of the story for time's sake but we
[1:14:07] know he refused and she grabbed a hold
[1:14:09] of him and stripped him of his Cod and
[1:14:11] and held on to it and then falsely
[1:14:13] accused him after all blessings after
[1:14:15] all the good after everything he'd done
[1:14:17] for her her husband's
[1:14:19] household do you see what kind of
[1:14:21] wickedness this woman Was Not only was
[1:14:24] she a hard
[1:14:25] a fornicator an
[1:14:28] adulterer she didn't even care about the
[1:14:30] well-being of her own
[1:14:32] husband the household his wealth his
[1:14:35] riches his his uh notoriety his
[1:14:38] Prosperity she didn't care about none of
[1:14:39] that she was so selfish and that's the
[1:14:41] way the devil lives and that's why we
[1:14:43] harp so much on selfish attitudes that's
[1:14:48] selfish spirit will take you
[1:14:50] nowhere if you're selfish and it's all
[1:14:53] about you and it's all about me me me me
[1:14:57] me it's not going to be a fun
[1:15:02] road it's about what you can do for
[1:15:06] others it's about what you give to
[1:15:09] others there's a saying some of you some
[1:15:12] of you ladies may have noticed it I
[1:15:14] notice things I pick up quotes and scri
[1:15:17] and in scripture and and just quotes and
[1:15:19] stuff
[1:15:19] everywhere but it
[1:15:21] says it's not what we Gather in life but
[1:15:24] what we
[1:15:26] scatter that was Sam Walton's wife it's
[1:15:29] on the wall of every Sams and that
[1:15:31] you'll ever go into walk back towards
[1:15:33] the bathroom and you'll see it on the
[1:15:34] left hand wall of ever Sams that I've
[1:15:36] been to it's not what we gather but what
[1:15:39] we
[1:15:41] scatter that's a selfless
[1:15:45] attitude so here she is this selfish
[1:15:48] woman I can promise you brothers and
[1:15:51] sisters I can promise you without a
[1:15:54] doubt in my mind that Joseph did not see
[1:15:56] this coming in the
[1:16:00] vision did you ever see any of your
[1:16:02] troubles
[1:16:03] coming no that's not the way it works he
[1:16:07] never even foreseen his brother's
[1:16:09] deceitful
[1:16:10] lies he never he never foreseen their
[1:16:13] Envy he didn't foresee their their
[1:16:15] malice their hatred he didn't foresee
[1:16:19] the pit that he would be thrown into he
[1:16:21] didn't foresee being sold down into
[1:16:23] bondage
[1:16:25] you see the devil don't just come and
[1:16:26] announce his presence say he this is
[1:16:28] what I'm going to do to you on this date
[1:16:29] on this day of this year and then this
[1:16:31] is what you're going to go no that's not
[1:16:33] the way it
[1:16:34] works but still it's a purpose and a
[1:16:37] plan it weaves itself all through
[1:16:39] everything you don't go through anything
[1:16:41] in life without it something being
[1:16:43] behind it there's a reason behind
[1:16:46] everything you go
[1:16:48] through I'm beginning to see that more
[1:16:50] and more as I'm getting older and older
[1:16:52] that's right and as I've been I I teach
[1:16:55] classes now some and I and I got this
[1:16:57] theory that you go from point A to point
[1:16:59] B and everything in you point a is your
[1:17:02] vision point a is what you see point a
[1:17:05] is what you think life is what you're
[1:17:06] looking for point B is when you get
[1:17:08] there and you arrive and you say this
[1:17:10] was the Fulfillment of my vision now how
[1:17:13] you get there is what happens all in
[1:17:15] between that's
[1:17:19] life and you don't know what it's going
[1:17:21] to take to get from point A to point B
[1:17:25] sometimes it's here and sometimes it's
[1:17:28] here and sometimes it's
[1:17:30] here you're the gum on the bottom of the
[1:17:35] shoe how many's ever felt like the gum
[1:17:37] on the bottom of a
[1:17:39] shoe yeah sometimes that's the way it is
[1:17:42] and and Joseph he didn't see himself
[1:17:44] going through none of this he didn't see
[1:17:46] that he was going to have to suffer but
[1:17:48] he had to suffer and go through this but
[1:17:50] all he could see was point B the victory
[1:17:57] he knew what God told him he knew what
[1:17:59] God showed him he knew what would
[1:18:01] happen Watch What Happens but the Lord
[1:18:04] was with Joseph and showed him mercy and
[1:18:08] gave him favor in the sight of The
[1:18:10] Keeper of the
[1:18:12] prison
[1:18:17] huh abused
[1:18:20] mocked put into a pit sold into bondage
[1:18:26] taking out of the pit prospering
[1:18:29] building up
[1:18:32] wealth lied
[1:18:37] about maybe you maybe maybe you didn't
[1:18:39] hear me lied about how many's ever been
[1:18:42] lied
[1:18:43] about if you hadn't it hurts it hurts
[1:18:47] real
[1:18:49] bad lies destroy
[1:18:52] people and here's Joseph lied
[1:18:55] about tried to be
[1:19:05] destroyed and the Lord was with
[1:19:10] Joseph what is it that get you through
[1:19:14] that through it
[1:19:16] all through it all it's
[1:19:20] Jesus he gave him favor in the sight of
[1:19:22] The Keeper of the prison and The Keeper
[1:19:24] of the prison committed to Joseph's hand
[1:19:26] all the
[1:19:28] prisoners man you are an amazing amazing
[1:19:31] person I don't know why you going
[1:19:33] through what you going through I don't
[1:19:34] know where you came from or what your
[1:19:36] heritage is or what's going on in your
[1:19:38] life or why you're having to suffer the
[1:19:40] way you are but you are one prosperous
[1:19:43] dude I want you to be over
[1:19:47] everybody I want you to take control
[1:19:49] over the whole situation I want you to
[1:19:51] to go in there and tell them what to do
[1:19:53] you show them how to do the job and
[1:19:55] we're going to build a we're going to
[1:19:56] build a
[1:19:58] kingdom that the world has never seen do
[1:20:01] you realize Joseph had a big part in
[1:20:02] plan with with building up of
[1:20:06] Egypt and he begins to build this up and
[1:20:09] build this up because the Lord was with
[1:20:11] him and showed him mercy and gave him
[1:20:15] favor and back into the
[1:20:17] prison now we would look at this and we
[1:20:19] would say this is not fair this is not
[1:20:22] fair how could God allow this to happen
[1:20:24] to Joseph and Joseph the prophet tells
[1:20:27] us was a very type of Christ how could
[1:20:29] he allow this to happen think it not
[1:20:31] strange concerning the fiery
[1:20:34] trials let me ask you
[1:20:37] this Joseph is up and down in trials and
[1:20:40] hardship and and troubles over and over
[1:20:43] and over and the problem is that he's a
[1:20:45] type of
[1:20:48] Christ let's just talk about the The
[1:20:50] Life of Christ for just a second
[1:20:55] what happened when he come onto the
[1:20:57] scene and was
[1:21:01] baptized went right into the
[1:21:04] Wilderness went right into
[1:21:07] trials right into
[1:21:09] temptation right into
[1:21:12] struggles right into the adversaries
[1:21:15] Den right into the living room of where
[1:21:18] Satan
[1:21:19] lived said why don't you just jump off
[1:21:21] of here the angels will catch you
[1:21:24] [Music]
[1:21:29] uh well it's
[1:21:33] written I won't tempt my
[1:21:37] god well if you're if you're so hungry
[1:21:41] Jesus why don't you just take these
[1:21:43] stones and turn them into bread well let
[1:21:44] me there's something I read something
[1:21:46] about that this is a big old document
[1:21:48] got a lot of good stuff in't
[1:21:50] it huh my Lord shall provide amen
[1:21:55] do you see what I'm saying even Jesus's
[1:21:58] life did that change the purpose of
[1:21:59] Jesus being on the
[1:22:01] scene his mission his vision never
[1:22:04] changed from when he arrived on the
[1:22:05] scene went into the Wilderness being
[1:22:07] tempted by
[1:22:09] Satan his whole purpose his whole Vision
[1:22:12] was a day on a cross called Calvary he
[1:22:15] never
[1:22:17] wavered he was
[1:22:19] persecuted he was mocked he was spit
[1:22:23] upon he was
[1:22:29] troubled you see sometimes God delivers
[1:22:32] us hard
[1:22:35] situations that's where we see where the
[1:22:37] rubber meets a road so let me ask you
[1:22:39] tonight let me ask you tonight when
[1:22:42] you're standing there and you you're
[1:22:43] face to face with a wall it's been put
[1:22:46] in your life do you just stand there and
[1:22:49] do you stare at that wall and say oh my
[1:22:52] goodness why is this happening to me why
[1:22:54] can't I go forward why can't I have
[1:22:56] healing why can't I have Deliverance why
[1:22:58] can't my children be
[1:23:01] saved do you focus on the wall do you
[1:23:04] focus on the problem or do you focus on
[1:23:06] the
[1:23:08] solution it's what you devote your time
[1:23:10] to if you want to devote your time to
[1:23:13] the problem you know what you'll have
[1:23:15] worry fear anxiety doubt
[1:23:21] frustration but if you begin to look at
[1:23:23] the solution
[1:23:25] and you begin to look at the the the
[1:23:26] changing factors the solution of Calvary
[1:23:30] and say that no matter what comes my way
[1:23:32] God will lead me whether it'll be over
[1:23:35] it under it around it through it I don't
[1:23:39] know how but the the solution is God
[1:23:42] will take me through he will get me to
[1:23:45] the other
[1:23:48] side so that's why we don't need to just
[1:23:50] belly ache sometimes our faith is going
[1:23:52] to be rocked so sometimes our faith is
[1:23:55] going to be rocked Joseph didn't do
[1:23:58] anything to find himself in this
[1:24:00] situation but I want you to notice this
[1:24:03] his brothers we know wanted him dead
[1:24:06] they took advantage of him wrongly
[1:24:08] accused him he didn't even have a voice
[1:24:11] in this in this in this uh direction of
[1:24:13] his life was
[1:24:16] traveling but scripture never reveals to
[1:24:19] us that Joseph sat around questioning
[1:24:20] and doubting did you ever notice that
[1:24:26] not once in the scripture did
[1:24:28] Joseph
[1:24:30] complain did you ever find
[1:24:33] it you never hear him complaining you
[1:24:36] never hear him doing any of those things
[1:24:37] you never hear him going in there and
[1:24:39] trying to trying to blame somebody he's
[1:24:41] not doing the blame
[1:24:43] game but he just continues to do what
[1:24:46] God is wanting him to do you see because
[1:24:51] there was a famine coming
[1:24:54] there was a famine coming upon the land
[1:24:56] and God had revealed to Joseph this fact
[1:24:58] that there is a famine coming and
[1:25:00] without adequate food everybody all
[1:25:03] people your people the Egyptians the
[1:25:06] Israelites are you with me all of these
[1:25:10] people are going to
[1:25:12] die you have a purpose you have a plan
[1:25:15] and so this famine coming God listen to
[1:25:18] what happens Watch What Happens God
[1:25:20] allowed Joseph to be slow sold into
[1:25:22] slavery
[1:25:26] that was not
[1:25:29] Satan you realize that God allowed him
[1:25:32] to be sold into slavery he allowed him
[1:25:35] to be wrongfully Accused by Piper's wife
[1:25:38] God allowed the Baker and the cup bear
[1:25:40] to be placed in the prison where he
[1:25:42] was you see we just see the
[1:25:46] front we just see what happens on stage
[1:25:50] we don't see what's happening in the
[1:25:52] background we don't see the costumes
[1:25:55] that are being changed we don't see
[1:25:56] who's turning on the lights who's doing
[1:25:58] this and who's doing that that's God's
[1:26:00] business God allowed Joseph to interpret
[1:26:05] dreams God used the famine to bring the
[1:26:07] family of Joseph of J Jacob to Egypt God
[1:26:11] used Joseph to prepare a place for them
[1:26:13] as they took Refuge God used Joseph to
[1:26:17] save the world even the
[1:26:21] ishmaelites the ones who bought him
[1:26:27] owed him into
[1:26:28] slavery you say well how you know it
[1:26:30] said that the whole world was saved the
[1:26:31] whole world was dependent upon Joseph's
[1:26:34] uh sa saving the
[1:26:36] world his
[1:26:39] interpretations so how did Joseph do
[1:26:44] this no complaining no
[1:26:48] murmuring Colossians 323 I think
[1:26:51] describes this to a te and whatsoever
[1:26:54] ever you do do it heartily as to the
[1:26:56] Lord and not unto
[1:26:58] men knowing that of the Lord you shall
[1:27:01] receive the reward of the inheritance
[1:27:03] for ye serve the Lord
[1:27:07] Christ if anybody had a
[1:27:10] reason if anybody and we're going to
[1:27:13] wind this down had a reason to quit to
[1:27:15] complain or to walk
[1:27:18] away Joseph
[1:27:21] did my little trials
[1:27:24] my little
[1:27:29] troubles they're a toothache compared to
[1:27:31] what Joseph went
[1:27:36] through he could have quit he could have
[1:27:38] lived a lifestyle of laziness
[1:27:42] resentment he said if this is the way
[1:27:44] it's going to be God how many people's
[1:27:45] done that if this is the way it's going
[1:27:48] to be God if this is the way you're
[1:27:49] going to treat
[1:27:51] me I refuse ref to
[1:27:57] serve I quit going to church it's
[1:28:00] amazing how many people lose their lose
[1:28:02] their relationship with God because of a
[1:28:04] deacon or a pastor or a trustee or just
[1:28:06] somebody in the
[1:28:13] church last time I checked we was all
[1:28:18] human I'll tell you right now I've said
[1:28:20] things I wish I could have took back a
[1:28:22] many of times
[1:28:24] brother Bor has said things he wished he
[1:28:26] could take back a many of
[1:28:28] times
[1:28:30] human but to allow somebody's fallacy or
[1:28:34] somebody's misunderstanding or
[1:28:35] somebody's uh uh not seeing something
[1:28:38] the way you do you're going to allow
[1:28:40] that to take you out of
[1:28:42] church you're going to allow that to
[1:28:44] take you and ruin your relationship with
[1:28:46] God and your fellowship with brothers
[1:28:48] and sisters it won't
[1:28:50] work well I'll just stream no you won't
[1:28:54] I'll just go I I'll drive let me tell

[1:28:59] church Faithfully it wasn't
[1:29:02] fun they all a thing fun about
[1:29:13] it
[1:29:15] resilience Joseph was resilient we look
[1:29:18] at the life of Joseph and we see he's
[1:29:20] resilient he was able to withstand he
[1:29:22] was able to recover quick from his
[1:29:24] difficulties he kept his character he
[1:29:27] kept the way he no matter what
[1:29:28] circumstances was he was going to serve
[1:29:34] others now I'm going to ask you this

[1:31:31] let me ask you this what are the habits
[1:31:32] with
[1:31:33] Jesus what were the habits of Jesus
[1:31:37] Jesus was committed to doing the will of
[1:31:39] God he was committed to Ministry I do
[1:31:43] not seek my own but the will of the
[1:31:45] father who sent
[1:31:50] meit was
[1:31:55] Jesus knew that having God's Will and
[1:31:58] knowing the the Old Testament and and
[1:32:00] and living out his life was guid and
[1:32:03] when Satan tempt him he
[1:32:07] replied that's a good habit a good habit
[1:32:15] is Jesus said those who obey my
[1:32:17] Commandments are the ones who love
[1:32:20] me and because they love me
[1:32:30] years they love me and I reveal myself
[1:32:32] to each one of
[1:32:35] them Jesus habit had a habit of being
[1:32:38] disciplined in
[1:32:42] solitude he didn't let the
[1:32:45] care of
[1:32:47] the him distract him from who
[1:32:52] he distraction
[1:32:58] distractions thinking the other day and
[1:33:00] I didn't get to study this out so I'm
[1:33:01] just going to throw it
[1:33:02] out look at
[1:33:05] it around us you know we have
[1:33:08] the or the interweb
[1:33:11] internet do you realize that's telling
[1:33:13] you what it is it's a
[1:33:16] net it's grabbing you it's capturing you
[1:33:21] it's holding on to you you ever tried to
[1:33:23] get out of a fish
[1:33:24] net it ain't no
[1:33:27] fun them little them little squares they
[1:33:30] grab you and they hang your clothes they
[1:33:31] hang you buttons they hang you shoelaces
[1:33:34] you ever get trapped in a net it's got
[1:33:38] you
[1:33:44] Netflix movies that grab you let's just
[1:33:46] break it
[1:33:49] down now 20 years ago if you told me we
[1:33:52] had Netflix I'd have said
[1:33:59] nah people used to throw the TVs out now
[1:34:03] we pack one in our pocket and watch one
[1:34:05] on the on the
[1:34:06] wall looking at both of them at the same
[1:34:13] time Netflix think about what it
[1:34:18] is Apple
[1:34:21] computer this is nothing against Steve
[1:34:23] Job it's just come to me I seen a little
[1:34:25] little thing on this and I thought this
[1:34:26] really makes sense what is the sign of
[1:34:29] the Apple computer a bite out of an
[1:34:31] apple what is typically the original
[1:34:39] sin I feel like we could just keep
[1:34:42] going
[1:34:45] distractions
[1:34:49] iPhone a
[1:34:52] channel how do you get a hold to
[1:34:54] somebody how do you how do you know
[1:34:56] somebody how do you see what somebody's
[1:34:58] really thinking you look in their
[1:35:04] eyes eyes tell the
[1:35:08] stories I work in sales if I can get
[1:35:10] make eye contact I'm begin to read you
[1:35:12] and I can listen to you and eyes and
[1:35:15] listen
[1:35:18] iPhone some of y'all are awful quiet
[1:35:25] but Jesus found himself as a habit to
[1:35:27] make himself as a discipline of solitude
[1:35:30] he would find a place where he could
[1:35:32] just get alone and be quiet did you ever
[1:35:34] notice that some of the best stories was
[1:35:35] when he could just slip away and he was
[1:35:37] just all to himself
[1:35:39] alone and them others and others that
[1:35:42] run around with
[1:35:45] him they wouldn't do
[1:35:47] it Lord help us save us we're going to
[1:35:50] die the waves are going to overtake us
[1:35:52] and he saw and L
[1:36:03] he had compassion for the
[1:36:07] hurting Jesus was always moved about
[1:36:10] compassion anytime he saw the sick the
[1:36:13] disadvantaged the
[1:36:15] Vernal compassion was turned into
[1:36:21] kindness two blind Beggars he touched
[1:36:23] their eyes and healed them Jesus had
[1:36:26] compassion on a widow restored her only
[1:36:29] son back to life it also tells Jesus had
[1:36:32] compassion on a leper touched him and
[1:36:34] healed him the Bible says he had
[1:36:36] compassion on a multitude because they
[1:36:38] were weary and Scattered like sheep
[1:36:39] having no Shepherd he prayed more
[1:36:41] workers for the plenteous
[1:36:43] Harvest Jesus moved with compassion on a
[1:36:46] crowd and healed their
[1:36:47] sick it records uh the Bible in Mark
[1:36:50] records how he moved with compassion on
[1:36:52] a multitude because uh they were like
[1:36:54] sheep without a Shepherd he began to
[1:36:55] teach them and this occasion he fed
[1:36:57] 5,000 men in their family he had
[1:36:59] compassion because they were
[1:37:03] hungry how many's hungry for
[1:37:06] God you see how this all ties
[1:37:12] together
[1:37:13] Faith this was a habit that Jesus
[1:37:16] practiced
[1:37:19] Faith Jesus had faith for miracles he
[1:37:22] didn't he didn't record any failures did
[1:37:24] you notice that in the Bible there's no
[1:37:26] failed
[1:37:29] Miracles out of all the stories Jesus
[1:37:31] done there's never one time that says
[1:37:33] well didn't work this time think the way
[1:37:35] God
[1:37:36] works he cursed a fig
[1:37:39] tree and what happened to
[1:37:43] it he spoke out of Faith to open the
[1:37:46] blind eyes heal the leper rais the Dead
[1:37:48] Calm the storm on the sea he told his
[1:37:50] disciples listen to this he told his
[1:37:52] disciples that Lazarus was sleeping he
[1:37:55] didn't say he was dead we always tell
[1:37:58] the story and we say Lazarus was laying
[1:38:00] dead in a
[1:38:01] tomb that's not what he said he said he
[1:38:05] was
[1:38:06] asleep he said he was asleep and when he
[1:38:09] got to the tomb Lazarus was asleep there
[1:38:11] for four days and he commanded him to
[1:38:13] come out of the grave and you know what
[1:38:15] he
[1:38:17] did so Jesus has had Jesus had a habit
[1:38:21] of Faith he told the woman with 12 years
[1:38:24] of a bleeding disorder that touched him
[1:38:26] by the Hemm of her garment said daughter
[1:38:27] your faith has made you well go in peace
[1:38:30] you have been
[1:38:33] healed these are affirmations in my deed
[1:38:38] book you say how does that apply to us
[1:38:41] today we need to practice what we
[1:38:45] preach a little over a year ago brother
[1:38:48] John come up for
[1:38:49] prayer couldn't hardly walk
[1:38:52] crying a man man of his stature crying
[1:38:55] walking down that aisle we had prayer
[1:38:57] for him for his
[1:39:00] back and it struck me something struck
[1:39:03] me and I had a marker and I had a
[1:39:04] handkerchief that we prayed over that I
[1:39:06] preached over and we prayed over and if
[1:39:08] I'm not mistaken I wrote the date on it
[1:39:09] and I wrote John lter healed of sciatic
[1:39:13] pain sciatic ba back pain and I handed
[1:39:17] that to him and I said you keep this as
[1:39:19] a
[1:39:20] reminder and don't you claim nothing no
[1:39:26] different I forgot about it he didn't
[1:39:29] forget about it a couple weeks ago he
[1:39:32] pulled out of his pocket he said you
[1:39:33] remember
[1:39:34] that still holds
[1:39:41] Good am I telling the truth now let me
[1:39:45] ask you John has has the devil had to
[1:39:46] put any claims on that he's he's T he's
[1:39:49] touched you a time or two hadn't he he's
[1:39:51] scratched at you he's clawed at you but

[1:45:25] day and I thought you know what somebody
[1:45:29] like that just needs
[1:45:31] forgiveness that was another habit that
[1:45:33] Jesus practiced
[1:45:35] forgiveness you know he practiced that
[1:45:37] on each and every one of
[1:45:39] us where would we be without
[1:45:43] forgiveness
[1:45:45] Joseph Integrity he kept his Integrity
[1:45:48] in the difficult
[1:45:50] situations demonstrated self-control
[1:45:53] strong work ethic towards his brothers
[1:45:56] that had wronged
[1:45:58] him I was like what brother Brandon was
[1:46:00] talking about he was talking about
[1:46:02] Joseph and this is en closing he said in
[1:46:06] his prison he constantly remembered he
[1:46:09] was born for a
[1:46:10] purpose he was going to set by a king
[1:46:13] all the rest of them was going to Bow a
[1:46:15] knee to him his vision told him so but
[1:46:20] before his vision could be completely
[1:46:22] fulfilled he had to become a prisoner he
[1:46:24] had to become a ruler and and when he
[1:46:26] come into the from the house from his
[1:46:28] prison house he become a prisoner of the
[1:46:30] word of God that he could only say what
[1:46:33] God had put in his mouth to say then God
[1:46:37] moved through him he said that applied
[1:46:40] to Moses and
[1:46:44] Paul and Joseph and
