[26:32] amen just appreciate the lord very much
[26:35] and
[26:36] just give a brief testimony and we were
[26:39] gone over the weekend
[26:40] our family reunion had a good time with
[26:42] our family and
[26:44] then we come back monday and uh janet
[26:46] went back to the
[26:48] wound doctor and they released her and
[26:52] and uh just pray that uh
[26:55] her surgery will get moved up some uh
[26:57] it's gonna we're gonna have to wait till
[26:58] september
[26:59] but her legs have healed up we're very
[27:02] thankful for that
[27:03] and uh
[27:06] we just appreciate god's grace and his
[27:08] mercy and your prayers and
[27:10] he's still a healer we're still just
[27:14] trusting him today and
[27:15] then i had to go monday afternoon and
[27:20] i said i almost feel like we're really
[27:23] old people because
[27:24] they seem like they always have to go to
[27:26] the doctor if she goes a day i go a day
[27:28] or she don't know then i have to go and
[27:30] but anyways but i had to go to the eye
[27:33] doctor and
[27:34] uh to see if they was going to give me
[27:36] another shot in mind he was
[27:39] very happy with my progress and so i
[27:41] didn't have to have a shot in my eye and
[27:43] i've got to go back and do my regular
[27:46] checkup to get better glasses i'm
[27:49] needing them but

[28:09] and she said that she had to come what
[28:12] was it ever five weeks she said and

[28:16] last time i got 109 it was like
[28:18] 19 weeks ago and mine's got better
[28:22] and you know
[28:26] we all think sometimes that we've got it
[28:29] bad but

[45:13] tonight
[45:14] i think that'll be all for the music
[45:17] we're going to
[45:18] uh it'll be a little different tonight
[45:20] and
[45:21] while you're while you're standing if
[45:22] you want to be turning into your bibles
[45:24] and
[45:24] to the book of ezekiel
[45:29] certainly appreciate your everyone's
[45:31] effort to come out tonight and i know
[45:32] there's
[45:32] there's many out in sickness that sound
[45:34] like the devil's certainly on a rampage
[45:36] uh and uh wednesday nights are always
[45:39] seem to be a little different
[45:40] it's no different for the preacher it's
[45:42] it seems to be a little different for
[45:44] the
[45:44] for the audience sometimes the preacher
[45:46] he's he still has to put in the same
[45:48] amount of time and energy and effort and
[45:51] and prayer to get to get to something
[45:53] together
[45:54] uh the way the lord would see so but we
[45:57] appreciate your effort to come out if
[45:58] you've worked outside you probably
[46:00] felt like you've been sitting on the
[46:01] surface of the sun today so you're tired
[46:03] and
[46:04] and we're going to try not to hold you
[46:05] too long tonight maybe
[46:08] just to just take our time for just a
[46:09] little bit and
[46:11] slow things down a little bit tonight
[46:12] i've enjoyed the wednesday night
[46:14] services bro the baller has been
[46:15] been bringing to us kind of slowing down
[46:17] and kind of giving a chance to to
[46:19] communicate back and forth and
[46:22] and we're just going to try to continue
[46:23] uh it seemed like that's
[46:25] kind of the thought that's going forward
[46:27] and we just want to kind of continue
[46:28] that thought and
[46:29] continuity with what he's been bringing
[46:31] and and with what the lords do for us so
[46:34] ezekiel 37 and
[46:36] we'll look there if you've got your
[46:37] scofield bible it's page 881
[46:41] i always like the the scofield bible
[46:43] just because
[46:44] uh if i can't find the scripture i can
[46:46] look at carson's and he's already got it
[46:48] and i'm gonna look and see what page
[46:49] he's on
[46:51] so uh i tell you what sometimes i the
[46:54] kids make me
[46:55] make me feel uh that they can get there
[46:58] quicker than i can what i'm trying to
[47:00] say
[47:00] they they can flip through the
[47:01] scriptures so
[47:04] very familiar scripture here ezekiel 37
[47:09] the hand of the lord was upon me and
[47:11] carried me
[47:12] out in the spirit of the lord and set me
[47:15] down in the midst
[47:16] of the valley which was full of bones
[47:20] and causing me to pass by them round
[47:23] about and behold there were
[47:25] very many in the open valley and lo
[47:29] they were very dry and we look at what
[47:32] the definition of dry we think in our
[47:34] mind we know it's it's simple we know
[47:36] the elementary word of dry and it's easy
[47:38] and it is just what it says it says it's
[47:40] free from
[47:41] liquid especially water and the analogy
[47:45] they give is
[47:46] dry as they bone
[47:49] they were very dry and he said unto me
[47:52] son of man
[47:54] look at how he addressed him son of man
[47:55] he's saying son of adam
[47:58] the descendant of adam son of man can
[48:01] these bones live
[48:03] and i answered oh lord god thou
[48:06] knowest and again he said unto me
[48:09] prophesy upon these bones and i say unto
[48:11] them
[48:12] oh ye dry bones hear the word of the
[48:14] lord
[48:15] thus saith the lord god unto these bones
[48:18] behold and i will cause
[48:20] what breath to enter into you
[48:24] and what ye shall live
[48:28] so if i could hold your attention
[48:29] tonight for about 45 minutes
[48:31] as you're seated may the lord add his
[48:33] blessings to the reading of the word
[48:35] i'd like to speak to you on the subject
[48:37] of ye shall
[48:38] live ye shall live
[48:42] and i was found this quote and brother
[48:45] branham
[48:46] was talking and he was talking to about
[48:48] a brother cobble i think it was
[48:50] and he said he was talking about a very
[48:52] beautiful picture and then he says oh
[48:54] it's a sad one in a way the condition
[48:58] of our hearts our hearts condition of
[49:02] the world
[49:03] how we are becoming dry towards
[49:08] the lord brothers and sisters there's a
[49:11] desensitizing of our
[49:12] godly spiritual selves happening in the
[49:15] world
[49:16] today when you look at in the world
[49:18] right is wrong
[49:19] and wrong is right man is woman woman is
[49:22] man or they're both
[49:26] and technology is feeding this to us
[49:28] faster than our minds can process that
[49:30] we're being fooled
[49:33] that we're being tricked by the devil
[49:35] and that the devil is constantly pushing
[49:37] and drowning us in these thoughts
[49:41] of deception and desensitizing us as
[49:44] christians
[49:44] we know right from wrong but yet as we
[49:47] listen and watch the news and the
[49:49] technology
[49:50] man what is right what is wrong
[49:54] and he says if you notice you i go out
[49:57] into the deserts many times i walk into
[49:59] the desert of california and arizona and
[50:01] through them places
[50:03] and every weed that you find's got a
[50:05] sticker on it
[50:07] he says because it's dry a dry climate
[50:11] it just develops stickers everything out
[50:14] there's got a sticker
[50:15] he said but you take and change that
[50:18] same variety of weed
[50:20] and put it up into the country where
[50:21] there's a lot of rain
[50:23] and a lot of swamp and he said it's just
[50:26] as soft
[50:27] as it can be he said it's just as
[50:31] soft as it can be
[50:34] the water makes the difference
[50:38] the water makes the difference and you
[50:41] take a people or a church that's just so
[50:43] dry
[50:44] they never have prayer meetings they
[50:45] become stickers
[50:47] they're just finding fault and sticking
[50:49] at one another
[50:52] uh oh but all we need is a good rain
[50:56] to soften us up a little bit he said
[50:58] don't you think so he said i like to
[51:00] live at the spout
[51:01] i like to live at the spout where
[51:04] there's plenty of rain falling
[51:05] and i can just keep getting softened up
[51:07] you know that's the best place to live
[51:09] is where the rain's falling see if the
[51:12] church is all dry there's no spirit in
[51:14] it
[51:16] it's got little stickers and what it
[51:19] needs is a good old-fashioned holy ghost
[51:22] rain to soften up the church
[51:27] one of the strangest but most famous
[51:29] passages in the bible
[51:31] we find here in ezekiel 37 and this
[51:34] ezekiel 37 has inspired
[51:36] numerous sunday school lessons it's
[51:38] inspired songs and sermons
[51:40] you know the song ezekiel connected them
[51:43] dry bones ezekiel connected them
[51:46] dry bones ezekiel in the valley of the
[51:49] dry bones now hear ye the word of the
[51:51] lord
[51:53] it's inspired by the scripture you know
[51:56] how it goes it's bones connect the bone
[51:58] this bone comes to this bone and this
[52:00] bone comes back to this bone
[52:01] and this is all taking place and on and
[52:03] on and on them dry bones
[52:08] the prophet ezekiel is led into this
[52:10] valley filled with
[52:12] damn dry bones and as ezekiel is looking
[52:15] out across the pews i
[52:18] i mean looking out across the valley
[52:24] if something gets sticky if the preacher
[52:26] let me tell you a little secret about
[52:28] preachers
[52:29] if they're saying something is sticky to
[52:31] you they've already stuffed themselves
[52:32] plenty of times with it so
[52:36] he's looking out across the valley of
[52:38] them dry bones
[52:39] he sees an army he sees an army that
[52:42] once flourished in battle for the lord
[52:44] he sees an army that was once vibrant
[52:47] and full of energy and spirit for the
[52:49] lord he sees an
[52:50] army that was once mighty and unified in
[52:53] the lord
[52:54] an army brothers and sisters that was
[52:55] capable of conquering
[52:57] every enemy that stood in its way this
[52:59] was a
[53:00] mighty people of god
[53:03] this mighty people of god and army
[53:06] brothers and sisters has now been turned
[53:08] into a pile of bony
[53:10] rubble
[53:13] a pile of bony rubble these bones that
[53:16] are now piled on top of each other's
[53:18] bones that have been bleached white by
[53:20] the baking of the sun
[53:22] the bones that echo the hollow sounds of
[53:25] death as they fall upon one another
[53:28] you know there's a certain sound that
[53:29] bones have it don't matter what kind of
[53:32] bone it is cow bone
[53:34] dog bone whatever if you've ever picked
[53:35] up one that's been dried and you drop it
[53:37] it's ear piercing hollow sound of death
[53:43] and these bones are now in this valley
[53:48] death is in this valley of the people
[53:51] that served god
[53:55] these were god's people
[53:58] did you ever think about that this was
[54:00] god's chosen people this was the vision
[54:02] of
[54:02] israel where they lay as bones
[54:06] are you with me tonight brother sisters
[54:09] what
[54:10] we need is an outpouring of the holy
[54:12] ghost like we have never
[54:14] had before we need god to open up the
[54:16] floodgates of heaven
[54:17] and let it rain down upon his people we
[54:20] can't afford to be dry
[54:22] in this time we can't afford to be
[54:24] sensitized in this time we're living in
[54:26] we need an outpouring of the holy ghost
[54:30] from here to there
[54:35] and i want to challenge you tonight if i
[54:38] don't challenge you i'm not doing my job
[54:41] so i'm going to challenge you tonight as
[54:42] i challenge myself
[54:44] and ask am i really as full of the holy
[54:47] ghost as i could be
[54:49] or as i should be am i really is full of
[54:53] the holy ghost do i take christ
[54:55] as serious as i should am i softened up
[54:59] enough
[54:59] in my flesh and in my spirit that i can
[55:03] be
[55:03] uh under the full
[55:06] capacity of what god wants me to be
[55:10] you see because many times i think we
[55:12] deceive ourselves into believing we're
[55:13] fully in god's will
[55:15] because we go to church we pay our
[55:18] tithes
[55:19] we pay our offerings we support missions
[55:22] we do all these things
[55:24] we do all these things but that's just
[55:26] being obedient
[55:29] that's just being obedient to what god
[55:30] has told us to do that has nothing to do
[55:33] with submitting yourselves to god's will
[55:35] on a daily basis
[55:39] and carrying out his works
[55:45] now say with me i'm not beating you too
[55:47] bad i'm not telling you you're not a
[55:49] christian
[55:50] i'm not saying that you're backslidden
[55:52] i'm not saying that you're not serving
[55:54] god
[55:55] i'm not saying any of those things at
[55:57] all but these
[55:58] bones that were in this valley were the
[56:01] servants of god
[56:06] we are the bride of jesus christ they
[56:09] were god's chosen
[56:10] we're god's chosen are you with me
[56:14] they knew all the ordinances of god we
[56:16] know
[56:18] we know the ordinance of god
[56:25] and still they find themselves dry
[56:28] in a defeated state of mind
[56:33] and used as an illustration of death
[56:40] so are we fully surrendered and alive
[56:43] tonight
[56:45] or do we find ourselves dry and stale
[56:49] not in myself but in him are we still
[56:52] you know i still read my bible i still
[56:54] pray i hope you're doing those things i
[56:55] come to church 52 times every
[56:58] a a week a year 52 times
[57:01] on sundays 52 times on wednesdays
[57:07] i hope you do if not maybe that's some
[57:09] of the problem
[57:10] oh maybe it's a lack of commitment
[57:16] maybe it's a lack of commitment that we
[57:18] found you know brother bowler he he was
[57:20] on this
[57:21] last week and he says what does it mean
[57:23] to be a christian
[57:26] and i thought about what everybody said
[57:28] myself included
[57:30] we talked about how god does stuff for
[57:32] us as individuals
[57:34] didn't we everybody that answered
[57:38] god does this for me god does that for
[57:39] me god watches it keeps me secure god
[57:41] keeps me safe
[57:43] god provides let me ask you what does a
[57:46] christian do
[57:50] what is a christian supposed to do in
[57:51] return you know the relationship with
[57:53] god is a reciprocating relationship you
[57:55] give and he gives you
[57:56] you know it goes back and forth both
[57:58] ways so what are we doing for god
[58:00] and you look and you think well we pray
[58:01] we study what's the next thing we should
[58:04] be
[58:04] fellowship fellowship coming together
[58:07] around the word of god
[58:09] coming together with brothers and
[58:10] sisters of light precious faith and
[58:12] spirit and truth and worshiping around
[58:14] the word of god
[58:16] we draw strength in numbers friends
[58:20] if this house was full you can't imagine
[58:22] what could happen
[58:24] it only takes two or three but what if
[58:27] we had the whole house was filled with
[58:29] licks of fire
[58:31] what if the whole house here was filled
[58:33] with people who were sincere and
[58:35] committed and
[58:36] dedicated to getting down and in front
[58:38] of god and saying god
[58:39] however you want to use me wherever you
[58:41] want me to go
[58:42] whatever you want me to say i'll do it
[58:44] what would happen in this church today
[58:52] fellowship what's the next thing we
[58:54] should do
[58:55] share
[58:59] i think i read somewhere it says go into
[59:00] all the world
[59:02] and preach the gospel
[59:05] share the word of god
[59:09] so if we're doing all of this if we're
[59:11] doing all this
[59:12] our life should be overflowing with god
[59:15] we should be so full of joy
[59:17] that it's uncontained
[59:26] joy i looked it up being a christian is
[59:32] having
[59:32] joy being a christian and joy go hand in
[59:36] hand
[59:38] and i'm going to show it to you through
[59:40] definitions you watch this
[59:42] these are uh synonyms they mean the same
[59:45] thing as joy
[59:46] joy means delight so as a christian did
[59:49] you
[59:50] delight in coming to the house of god
[59:52] tonight
[59:53] because every time the doors is open
[59:55] you'll be there and be ready to go
[59:56] you'll delight
[59:57] and come into the house of god are you
[1:00:01] in jubilation tonight are you in
[1:00:04] jubilation because of your freedom
[1:00:06] because of what god done for you on
[1:00:08] calvary you ought to be in jubilation
[1:00:09] because you are a free
[1:00:12] person
[1:00:14] triumph these words are all the same as
[1:00:17] joy
[1:00:18] try enough are you triumphant tonight
[1:00:21] because you've overcome through christ
[1:00:22] jesus
[1:00:25] rejoicing happiness gladness and here
[1:00:27] was one that i thought oh my goodness
[1:00:29] how have we not seen this before
[1:00:31] the same thing that means joy rapture
[1:00:37] rapture and then you thought rapture how
[1:00:40] does rapture mean joy well i looked up
[1:00:42] what rapture meant and it means
[1:00:44] a feeling of intense pleasure or joy
[1:00:46] what a feeling it will be
[1:00:48] when we rapture out this earth
[1:00:52] you're talking about a joyous time
[1:00:54] that's why david said
[1:00:56] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1:01:00] we've got to have joy because joy gives
[1:01:02] us life
[1:01:05] joy that gets us alive you can live this
[1:01:10] the opposite
[1:01:12] you know i found out in life it's the
[1:01:13] choices you make
[1:01:15] you can choose to be joyous or you can
[1:01:17] choose to be miserable
[1:01:19] that's your choice but i get so
[1:01:23] disgusted when i see people who are
[1:01:25] miserable in their own skin
[1:01:28] they're miserable because of what
[1:01:31] somebody else said
[1:01:32] they're miserable because of what
[1:01:34] somebody else did they're in despair
[1:01:36] somebody done them wrong song they're
[1:01:39] constantly in a trial they're constantly
[1:01:41] in a tribulation
[1:01:44] maybe they're just in a dry condition
[1:01:46] tonight
[1:01:50] brothers and sisters nobody likes a dry
[1:01:52] person
[1:01:55] nobody likes the negative nelly
[1:01:59] and i studied and this was this you know
[1:02:01] it's funny how
[1:02:02] i think i think internet knows your
[1:02:05] knows your thoughts sometimes
[1:02:08] because as i was studying about
[1:02:09] negativity and positivity and we know
[1:02:11] the prophet said that every everything
[1:02:13] positive there's a negative
[1:02:14] everything negative there's a positive
[1:02:15] and as i was looking at that negative
[1:02:17] nelly nobody likes negative nearly this
[1:02:18] pops up
[1:02:20] and it says you may have seen it says
[1:02:23] hate has four letters
[1:02:25] so does love enemies has seven letters
[1:02:29] so does friends lying has
[1:02:32] five letters so does truth isn't that
[1:02:35] amazing
[1:02:36] negative has eight letters so does
[1:02:38] positive
[1:02:39] under has five so does above cry has
[1:02:43] three
[1:02:44] so does joy anger has five
[1:02:47] guess what so does happy
[1:02:50] right has five wrong has five hurt has
[1:02:53] four he'll has four
[1:02:58] the negatives and the
[1:03:01] what are you going to be are you going
[1:03:03] to be that christian everybody turns to
[1:03:05] and relies on
[1:03:06] are you going to be the christian that
[1:03:07] goes out and gets those that are lost
[1:03:08] are you going to be the christian that
[1:03:10] people can look and say that's a solid
[1:03:11] person right there
[1:03:13] are you going to be the one that says he
[1:03:15] ain't a christian
[1:03:17] look how miserable he is look how
[1:03:20] discouraged he is if that's the life of
[1:03:22] christ

[1:03:40] atmosphere around you gets
[1:03:43] dry you touch something
[1:03:46] sparks fly off and the only thing you
[1:03:50] want to do
[1:03:51] is find you a thorn bush so that you can
[1:03:53] rub your back up and down until it
[1:03:55] bleeds because you're so itchy
[1:03:57] and dry and miserable dryness

[1:05:29] husband comes home from work with a dry
[1:05:31] attitude
[1:05:33] and you say how was your day fine

[1:05:49] hands up
[1:05:50] dryness we don't like dry
[1:05:53] and these are some some examples i put
[1:05:56] in there that are the natural
[1:05:57] so what do you think god thinks about us
[1:05:59] in the spiritual
[1:06:01] when the preacher's up there preaching
[1:06:03] he's preaching his heart out and he's
[1:06:05] committed and dedicated and prayed and
[1:06:07] studied and then you're sitting out
[1:06:08] there like a knot on a log
[1:06:10] and you got your arms crossed and you're
[1:06:14] looking and you're counting the glitter
[1:06:15] on the ceiling
[1:06:18] what does god think about that
[1:06:22] what does god think about it when the
[1:06:24] word goes forth you can't muster up
[1:06:26] enough energy to say amen
[1:06:32] that's right brother steve
[1:06:39] you're not hurting me no
[1:06:42] no you're not hurting me you're not
[1:06:44] hurting brother you're hurting yourself
[1:06:47] you're hurting your relationship with
[1:06:49] god what about our worship
[1:06:52] why does worship keep coming up why does
[1:06:54] praise keep coming up
[1:06:57] because the bible says that everything
[1:06:59] that has breath
[1:07:03] we know it why don't we do it
[1:07:04] [Applause]
[1:07:06] i said oh i tell you what it's a good
[1:07:08] thing we don't ask the musicians what
[1:07:10] they see
[1:07:14] sister becky said that's right and i'm
[1:07:17] glad i sat there so that my eyes are in
[1:07:19] front and not behind me
[1:07:21] i get so frustrated why don't you praise
[1:07:23] the lord just sing like you're singing
[1:07:25] in the shower
[1:07:32] we got to have a little bit of emotion
[1:07:36] a little bit of emotion i don't know
[1:07:37] what time i started brother but this is
[1:07:39] not going near as fast as i thought it
[1:07:40] was
[1:07:43] we got to have a little bit of emotion
[1:07:45] in our life
[1:07:47] we have emotion with everything else and
[1:07:50] i'm as guilty as anybody
[1:07:53] we were at a ballgame basketball game
[1:07:54] and you hear the ball game story all the
[1:07:56] time and i think
[1:07:57] do i really act like that yeah i did
[1:08:01] my friend says he's the press announcer
[1:08:04] and he's sitting over talking to me
[1:08:05] before the game he said well i'm gonna
[1:08:06] go over here
[1:08:06] he said i can't step by you you get too
[1:08:08] wild
[1:08:12] i thought well i'll show him
[1:08:17] i got my chairs in that bench in the
[1:08:20] stadium
[1:08:21] i sat there and i watched the game i
[1:08:24] didn't say a word i watched the game
[1:08:28] and the referee made a bad call
[1:08:34] i'm watching the game and then he made a
[1:08:37] bad call against my son i said what are
[1:08:39] you talking about
[1:08:40] [Laughter]
[1:08:44] what is it it's the emotion that comes
[1:08:47] out
[1:08:48] god demands and requires emotion
[1:08:52] in his people brother brown said
[1:08:54] anything that is alive
[1:08:55] has emotion and anything that doesn't
[1:08:59] is dead he said excuse the expression
[1:09:02] but i think we ought to bury some of our
[1:09:04] emotionless
[1:09:06] religion because it's dead
[1:09:08] [Music]
[1:09:13] he said when that baby's born there's
[1:09:15] three elements that come
[1:09:17] he said it's water and if there's no
[1:09:20] water it's a dry birth and a baby's not
[1:09:22] normal
[1:09:23] second thing is blood and the next thing
[1:09:26] is life
[1:09:27] he said if that baby's born and he's
[1:09:29] still born and he doesn't cry if there's
[1:09:31] no emotion to him
[1:09:33] he's a dead born baby he said but and
[1:09:35] that's what's matter with the churches
[1:09:37] today that's 1962.
[1:09:41] 1962. and that's what's a matter with
[1:09:43] the churches today
[1:09:44] they have no emotion what's wrong with
[1:09:47] our pentecostals
[1:09:48] he said we're bringing forth dead born
[1:09:50] babies that's right
[1:09:52] he said what do you do with the baby if
[1:09:54] he's still born like that
[1:09:56] he said you take him by the heels you
[1:09:57] raise him up and you give him a little
[1:09:59] prostate
[1:10:00] posterior protoplasmic stimulation as
[1:10:03] hard as you can
[1:10:07] and he said that's what the church needs
[1:10:08] tonight
[1:10:10] a good old-fashioned gospel spanking
[1:10:13] with the power of the holy ghost
[1:10:16] we need more preachers to stand in the
[1:10:18] pulpit and tell you where the robber
[1:10:19] meets the road
[1:10:21] because we want to see you make it we
[1:10:23] want to see you get there we want to see
[1:10:25] you get there with joy and happiness and
[1:10:28] love
[1:10:30] not miserable christians
[1:10:34] so what are you doing with your life
[1:10:35] tonight are you filled with that holy
[1:10:38] ghost and is god living through you
[1:10:39] are you afraid to let go
[1:10:44] are you holding yourself back and just
[1:10:46] say i just can't do it
[1:10:49] brother and sister i want so much of god
[1:10:51] in me
[1:10:53] i want to be so filled with the holy
[1:10:56] spirit that every word that comes
[1:10:58] out of this mouth is his
[1:11:01] every thought that goes through this
[1:11:04] mind
[1:11:05] is his every dream
[1:11:08] that i dream is of his
[1:11:12] every movement that i make
[1:11:15] is his that's where i want to be
[1:11:19] whether preaching singing testifying
[1:11:22] witnessing whatever it is i want to be
[1:11:24] alive in christ
[1:11:25] and like i said as a minister of the
[1:11:26] gospel i want you
[1:11:28] alive in christ for the balor wants you
[1:11:30] alive in christ
[1:11:32] we want you to have that experience
[1:11:38] too many times i believe people sell
[1:11:40] themselves short on all the joys of
[1:11:42] living a fully surrendered life
[1:11:50] they sell themselves short on letting
[1:11:52] god lead them and guide them
[1:11:55] you know i i never want to be that
[1:11:57] christian that never gets involved
[1:12:00] in the movement of god
[1:12:04] you know if god says sing i want to sing
[1:12:08] if god says dance i want to dance
[1:12:11] and if god says speak in tongues i want
[1:12:13] to speak in tongues
[1:12:15] so let me ask you what happened to those
[1:12:17] things
[1:12:20] because my bible tells me that god never
[1:12:22] changes
[1:12:23] so where are they at
[1:12:28] it might be that we get so clammed up
[1:12:30] and so tight
[1:12:31] and so dry that we would be afraid of
[1:12:33] somebody spoke in tongues somebody might
[1:12:35] interpret and tell us what we need
[1:12:36] [Music]
[1:12:39] [Applause]
[1:12:41] well this might be my last time
[1:12:46] [Applause]
[1:12:47] god wants more from us than to just be
[1:12:50] spectators
[1:12:53] now let me ask you this one
[1:12:57] where's our converts
[1:13:02] where's the con the new converts in this
[1:13:04] church
[1:13:07] um well we might go to midnight
[1:13:13] where are the people that we've
[1:13:14] witnessed the gospel to
[1:13:19] man it's quiet as a church mouse
[1:13:23] like i said when i point at you there's
[1:13:25] three pointing back i'm guilty
[1:13:28] i'm guilty
[1:13:32] well brother what if i ask somebody to
[1:13:33] come and they get offended because we
[1:13:34] talk about the message
[1:13:37] we can make all the excuses we want
[1:13:40] excuses are a dime a dozen but you know
[1:13:42] what they get you nothing
[1:13:46] because i'm here to tell you in a dying
[1:13:47] a lost and dying world
[1:13:50] we're too spiritually dry to ask
[1:13:52] somebody to come to church
[1:13:57] we're too dry and dead on ourselves to
[1:14:00] look at somebody and say let me tell you
[1:14:02] what god
[1:14:03] has done do you have a home church
[1:14:06] and if you don't would you like to come
[1:14:08] with us
[1:14:09] how many times have you said that in the
[1:14:10] last year
[1:14:13] don't answer please
[1:14:18] you know 99 out of 100 they may look at
[1:14:21] you cross-eyed
[1:14:24] but what about that one that was just
[1:14:25] needed somebody to care
[1:14:27] enough to ask
[1:14:32] what about that one person that you
[1:14:34] think there's no way in
[1:14:37] the green earth of god that that person
[1:14:39] will ever be a christian
[1:14:41] but they didn't have a church they don't
[1:14:43] have no family
[1:14:44] they don't know anybody in the community
[1:14:46] and they just need somebody to say
[1:14:48] would you like to come to church with me
[1:14:52] you know you can tell them about christ
[1:14:53] all you want why don't you bring them
[1:14:54] with you
[1:14:56] invite them over to your house for
[1:14:57] dinner
[1:14:58] [Music]
[1:15:02] and let me tell you the message won't
[1:15:03] scare them off you know why
[1:15:05] because there's nothing in the message
[1:15:06] to be scared about
[1:15:08] if you know the message you can take
[1:15:11] them through the message you can take
[1:15:12] them through the bible
[1:15:13] and they can plainly see that it all
[1:15:14] lines up
[1:15:20] brother byler i was thanking maybe we
[1:15:22] need to get us some business cards
[1:15:26] evening light tabernacle pastor thomas
[1:15:29] pyler
[1:15:31] phone number and address
[1:15:35] some of you looking at me like i'm crazy
[1:15:40] business william business we're at
[1:15:42] church
[1:15:43] you know what uh the first recorded
[1:15:46] words out of jesus mouth was in the
[1:15:48] bible at age 12
[1:15:50] you'll find in luke chapter 2 verse 49
[1:15:54] and he said unto me unto them why do you
[1:15:57] seek me do you not know that i'm about
[1:15:59] my father's
[1:16:04] business
[1:16:07] brothers and sisters i've told you
[1:16:08] before
[1:16:10] i get embarrassed sometimes and i get
[1:16:12] ashamed when i'm some of my
[1:16:13] denominational preachers and friends
[1:16:15] they make me ashamed
[1:16:18] i shouldn't feel that way i shouldn't
[1:16:21] have to feel that way that tells me i'm
[1:16:23] not doing something i should be doing
[1:16:25] that i'm maybe not as close to god and
[1:16:27] as in tune with god as i think i
[1:16:29] am i'm gonna share this story with you i
[1:16:32] don't think i have here
[1:16:35] we were we had our ball team we was up
[1:16:37] in louisville or lexington i can't
[1:16:38] remember but we stopped at a cracker
[1:16:40] barrel
[1:16:42] and we stopped at a cracker barrel to
[1:16:43] eat dinner and the kids were all at one
[1:16:45] table and they were they were all having
[1:16:46] a big time and it was me
[1:16:48] and coach crawford he's my friend my
[1:16:50] baptist
[1:16:51] pastor friend and another guy's another
[1:16:54] coach sitting at the table there
[1:16:55] and a young lady comes up to us and
[1:16:57] pleasant smile just
[1:16:58] having to look like the best day of her
[1:17:00] life and that takes our drink order what
[1:17:02] would you like to drink
[1:17:03] so we tell her and you know when you're
[1:17:06] good friends with people you can tell
[1:17:08] sometimes when things are not right or
[1:17:10] they're uncomfortable well i can see
[1:17:12] daryl he kind of started rocking in his
[1:17:14] chair there's a certain thing he does he
[1:17:15] kind of just
[1:17:16] bounces back and forth i thought what's
[1:17:18] troubling him
[1:17:20] so we go on we go and she comes back out
[1:17:22] she comes out to take our order and we
[1:17:24] give her our order
[1:17:26] and when daryl really gets really
[1:17:27] nervous he starts kind of chewing
[1:17:30] right here in the car wherever
[1:17:33] sitting in the dugout you know when base
[1:17:35] is loaded two hours two
[1:17:37] through two strikes full you know he's
[1:17:39] he's like this right here
[1:17:41] he started doing that i thought the
[1:17:42] world is bothering him
[1:17:46] time goes on she comes back out she sets
[1:17:49] up our food around our table
[1:17:52] and she said is there anything else i
[1:17:54] can do for y'all and just smiles
[1:17:56] and he kicked back and he smiled at her
[1:18:00] and he's got a certain smile i'm going
[1:18:02] to tell you why he's a real man of god
[1:18:04] and he looks at her and he says ma'am we
[1:18:06] don't need nothing else this looks
[1:18:07] wonderful
[1:18:09] but we're fixing to pray for our food
[1:18:12] he said is there anything that's
[1:18:13] troubling you or on your heart that you
[1:18:15] would like for us to pray
[1:18:17] for you for
[1:18:20] you could have knocked me over with
[1:18:24] feather
[1:18:26] right there in the middle of cracker
[1:18:27] barrel she wells up with tears
[1:18:32] she said you know i moved here with my
[1:18:33] boyfriend
[1:18:35] she said we thought this was going to
[1:18:36] work she said it ain't worked out
[1:18:39] she said now i'm trying to save enough
[1:18:41] money to go to go home and
[1:18:42] i'm working two jobs and she said i'm
[1:18:45] just having a hard
[1:18:46] hard time she said will you just pray
[1:18:48] that i find my way back home
[1:18:53] brother and sister that is being in tune
[1:18:56] with god
[1:18:59] that is being so committed
[1:19:03] to the spirit of god that he sensed that
[1:19:06] on
[1:19:06] he sent something wasn't right on her
[1:19:10] something was bothering her something
[1:19:12] was troubling her her smiles couldn't
[1:19:14] hide it
[1:19:15] her pleasure couldn't hide it but he was
[1:19:17] in tune with a channel with god
[1:19:19] that god said ask her for prayer
[1:19:25] you see sometimes we have to get out of
[1:19:27] our comfort zone
[1:19:29] there we were joined hands with this
[1:19:31] young lady
[1:19:32] in the middle you know god's going to
[1:19:34] put you out there where everybody sees
[1:19:35] it
[1:19:37] you're not going to do it back in the
[1:19:38] corner okay he's not going to say come
[1:19:40] over here we're going to hide and pray
[1:19:41] no
[1:19:42] sir right there in the middle of cracker
[1:19:44] barrel we all join hands and we pray and
[1:19:46] she's crying
[1:19:49] people looking at us like we're crazier
[1:19:51] than bedbugs
[1:19:54] but you know what i didn't care it
[1:19:57] didn't matter at that point what did i
[1:19:58] care i didn't know those people
[1:20:00] they made they didn't mean nothing to me
[1:20:02] as far as what i felt how they felt
[1:20:03] about me didn't matter to me
[1:20:06] what mattered was that poor girl who was
[1:20:09] crying out in her heart
[1:20:10] for somebody to help me and he was in a
[1:20:14] channel
[1:20:15] to do it
[1:20:20] you know i've had people tell me they
[1:20:22] say it's easy for you
[1:20:25] you're a preacher god called you to be a
[1:20:28] preacher and it's easy for you you're
[1:20:29] comfortable in front of the people
[1:20:32] and they say i i can't get up there in
[1:20:34] front of people like you do there's no
[1:20:36] way i could testify in front of
[1:20:37] everybody
[1:20:38] there's no way i get so nervous i can't
[1:20:40] sing specials there's no way i could do
[1:20:42] that
[1:20:42] i tried it one time i've had somebody i
[1:20:45] tried it one time
[1:20:47] my voice cracked i was so nervous i
[1:20:49] couldn't get in tune with the piano
[1:21:01] it was a disaster
[1:21:05] i could never witness to anybody because
[1:21:07] i don't know what to say i get so
[1:21:08] nervous
[1:21:10] i just get so nervous
[1:21:14] that's why we need that outpouring
[1:21:17] that's why we need that outpouring
[1:21:20] let me tell you a day in the life of a
[1:21:22] preacher
[1:21:24] it's not easy it's not easy

[1:21:37] i'm going to be honest with you
[1:21:40] because i believe honesty makes us grow
[1:21:43] i try to think of every excuse i could
[1:21:45] possibly think of
[1:21:47] to not take this service
[1:21:52] let's see i've got to i've got work

[1:22:21] quiver on me and i text him back

[1:24:11] said no i never even asked
[1:24:17] like i had something to do with it i
[1:24:19] never even asked
[1:24:25] getting in the channel letting god move
[1:24:28] in such a way
[1:24:30] that we're right where he wants us to be
[1:24:33] you know i'm going to tell you one of
[1:24:34] the most aggravating things i ever hear
[1:24:37] and it gets me every time i hear it
[1:24:41] i'll get the moma soap box tonight
[1:24:44] but people go to special meetings people
[1:24:47] go to camps
[1:24:49] and they come back and they say boy i
[1:24:51] wish we could have service like that
[1:24:56] why don't we
[1:25:00] why don't we their singers are no more
[1:25:04] talented than some we've got
[1:25:07] their preachers are not more no better
[1:25:09] than brother byler
[1:25:11] a lot of them is better than me but
[1:25:12] they're no better than brother byler we
[1:25:14] can have those kind of services
[1:25:15] but what are we doing to get into the
[1:25:17] service
[1:25:20] what are we doing to get into that
[1:25:21] channel with god
[1:25:25] we need the breath of god
[1:25:28] to breathe down across us and give us
[1:25:32] the life we need
[1:25:34] so that we can go forward with god
[1:25:38] you want to have good services choose to
[1:25:40] have a good service
[1:25:41] [Applause]
[1:25:43] the message i had on my mind was
[1:25:45] expectations but i saved it for another
[1:25:47] day
[1:25:48] this is just before the forerunner of it
[1:25:51] expectations you get in life what you
[1:25:53] expect
[1:25:56] you know weston just went to that camp
[1:25:58] three weeks
[1:26:00] that boy never stayed away from home for
[1:26:01] three hours hardly
[1:26:04] he's a homebody and that's okay
[1:26:08] he gets up there day one not good
[1:26:14] day two not so good
[1:26:18] he's ready to come home he's miserable
[1:26:21] yeah i wish this was over
[1:26:23] we're talking two days out of a 21
[1:26:27] and i said son i said
[1:26:30] that camp is going to be what you make
[1:26:32] it
[1:26:34] so make it what you want it to be
[1:26:40] day five man he's got some friends now
[1:26:43] he even found a conservative buddy
[1:26:45] praise the lord
[1:26:50] day 21 we go back to get him we can't
[1:26:52] leave because he's got to tell everybody
[1:26:54] bye
[1:26:56] he turned the atmosphere into what he
[1:26:59] needed it to be
[1:27:01] for his joy
[1:27:05] let's look at our scripture for a few
[1:27:06] minutes and then we're going to get out
[1:27:07] of here
[1:27:10] i'm going to start at verse 2 there
[1:27:14] and cause me to pass about then round
[1:27:16] about and behold
[1:27:18] there were very many in the open valley
[1:27:21] and lo they were very dry and he said
[1:27:24] unto me son of man
[1:27:26] can these bones live now we look here
[1:27:29] in ezekiel and this is time when the
[1:27:31] babylonians have completely laid
[1:27:33] waste to israel they have taken their
[1:27:36] people captive they've taken daniel
[1:27:38] they've taken the three
[1:27:39] hebrew children and they've laid ruined
[1:27:42] to the city of israel and destroyed
[1:27:43] their temple
[1:27:45] so restoration in ezekiel's eyes seems
[1:27:48] impossible at this time
[1:27:50] because they are under the foot of the
[1:27:52] most powerful empire
[1:27:54] to rule at this time in the world
[1:27:57] living in a city that they can see no
[1:27:59] possible renewal
[1:28:01] israel now these dry bones a dead nation
[1:28:04] full of absolutely no sign of life
[1:28:08] or recovery it's going to take a miracle
[1:28:12] this is going to take a miracle and god
[1:28:14] says ezekiel
[1:28:18] can these bones live
[1:28:23] brothers and sisters he wasn't asking
[1:28:24] for ezekiel's advice
[1:28:27] he didn't even want ezekiel's opinion
[1:28:31] but he was trying to make ezekiel think
[1:28:35] he was trying to get him to think what
[1:28:37] what do you mean can these bones live
[1:28:38] well how can i tie
[1:28:39] what where's god come over this how can
[1:28:41] he i'm not answering this question
[1:28:43] god i'm not answering because thou
[1:28:44] knowest
[1:28:47] you're the omnipotent god you're the
[1:28:49] all-knowing you know the answer before
[1:28:50] you ask the question
[1:28:52] so i'm not answering and he says
[1:28:56] prophesy he tells ezekiel
[1:28:59] preach preach
[1:29:02] you want to talk about an uncomfortable
[1:29:04] place to be in
[1:29:06] you think about ezekiel in this position
[1:29:08] he's sitting up on the pinnacle of a
[1:29:09] hill
[1:29:10] looking into a valley full of thousands
[1:29:13] and thousands of bones
[1:29:15] and he's supposed to preach
[1:29:18] i can't help but think that in my mind
[1:29:21] he had to have turned around
[1:29:22] and see who was watching this event
[1:29:29] preach to these bones and say unto them
[1:29:31] ye dry bones hear the word of the lord
[1:29:34] thus saith the lord unto the bones
[1:29:36] behold i will cause
[1:29:39] breath breath
[1:29:43] to enter into you and ye shall
[1:29:46] live we look at the word for breath
[1:29:49] there and it's the same word of breath
[1:29:52] that god
[1:29:53] used in the beginning in genesis 2 when
[1:29:55] he's creating adam
[1:29:57] and he's saying there and in genesis 2
[1:30:00] god
[1:30:00] for man out of what
[1:30:04] dust
[1:30:07] dust is pretty dry
[1:30:10] dust is pretty dry you can't grow
[1:30:12] nothing in dust
[1:30:13] you can throw some seeds down in dust
[1:30:15] it's just going to lay there
[1:30:16] there's no life in dust and god created
[1:30:19] adam
[1:30:20] and man out of the dust of the earth
[1:30:24] and formed him there
[1:30:27] and i'm going to take you to what
[1:30:28] happened that day and i know it to be
[1:30:30] the truth you know how come i know
[1:30:31] because brother brown said i saw
[1:30:36] he said i see adam standing like a tree
[1:30:40] it's one of my all-time favorite quotes
[1:30:42] i saw adam standing like a tree
[1:30:45] god had made them he was dead
[1:30:49] as he could be
[1:30:53] dust and he said his toes were like the
[1:30:57] roots
[1:30:58] sticking into the ground
[1:31:04] and god breathed
[1:31:10] god breathed the breath of life into it
[1:31:12] and he jumped
[1:31:14] he said adam jumped that was the first
[1:31:15] thing he did he had an emotion
[1:31:19] you mean when god breathed the life into
[1:31:22] him he was emotional
[1:31:24] somebody but bruh stephen set him down
[1:31:27] he's jumping around because god has
[1:31:29] breathed life into him
[1:31:31] brother brown said he came to himself
[1:31:35] it was god's living breath to come into
[1:31:38] him
[1:31:38] and he came into himself and he said he
[1:31:41] became a living soul
[1:31:42] and he began to move on and move on and
[1:31:45] move on
[1:31:46] brothers and sisters adam came alive the
[1:31:48] spirit of god moved into him
[1:31:50] he became emotional he jumped and he was
[1:31:52] moving because he was about god's
[1:31:56] business
[1:32:01] so ezekiel he begins to preach
[1:32:07] ezekiel's preaching and he says there
[1:32:10] was a noise
[1:32:16] and every hole is shaking
[1:32:23] and bone came to bone
[1:32:27] the toe come to the foot the foot to the
[1:32:29] ankle the ankle to the leg
[1:32:32] the fingers to the hands the hands to
[1:32:34] the wrists the rest of the arms
[1:32:36] to the torso these bones are coming
[1:32:38] together and flesh
[1:32:39] and sinew are beginning to form in these
[1:32:41] dry bones
[1:32:43] the very marrow of these bones that were
[1:32:45] so hollow
[1:32:46] and full of death that had no life in
[1:32:48] them now the stem cells are in there
[1:32:51] the marrow contains the stem cells where
[1:32:54] life lives
[1:32:56] deep down inside these bones they begin
[1:32:58] to grow
[1:33:00] and they come together and the flesh
[1:33:01] comes over
[1:33:04] and it covered them
[1:33:08] and the bible says but there was no
[1:33:12] breath breath
[1:33:16] there was no breath in them
[1:33:22] can you imagine ezekiel standing there
[1:33:26] he said and he said unto me preach
[1:33:32] god's telling amen i like what i'm
[1:33:35] saying preach
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:37] preach preaches equal preaching to the
[1:33:39] wind preach
[1:33:41] son of man reminding him again you
[1:33:43] descendant of adam
[1:33:45] you remember what i did for adam don't
[1:33:47] you you remember when he stood there
[1:33:49] with his toes in the ground like roots
[1:33:51] and i come out of the dust of the earth
[1:33:53] and i breathe upon him you remember what
[1:33:56] happened son of man
[1:33:57] preached to the wind
[1:34:02] sometimes brothers and sisters we need
[1:34:04] to be brought back to our remembrance
[1:34:08] you say i can't be a witness remember
[1:34:10] when you're as a sinner

[1:34:28] can't do it too many people around
[1:34:30] just remember that blood shed on calvary

[1:34:37] sing
[1:34:40] i need you to testify
[1:34:43] i need you to witness you know why
[1:34:46] because i draw
[1:34:47] strength from that i draw
[1:34:50] strength when i hear somebody testify
[1:34:52] the good things that god's done from
[1:34:53] them
[1:34:54] for them i begin to think man if god can
[1:34:57] do that for them
[1:34:58] what could he do for me when i hear a
[1:35:02] song and i see people so dedicated
[1:35:04] into the song and they get into it they
[1:35:06] they get a little emotional
[1:35:08] and i think man what a blessing that i
[1:35:10] went right through that this week i need
[1:35:13] that song
[1:35:18] [Applause]
[1:35:20] amen preach unto the wind
[1:35:23] prophesy son of man and say to the wind
[1:35:27] come from the four winds o breath and
[1:35:29] breathe upon the slain
[1:35:32] that they may live
[1:35:35] you know what ezekiel did he said i
[1:35:37] preached
[1:35:40] i preached wind from the north wind from
[1:35:43] the south went from the east from the
[1:35:45] west
[1:35:45] come and move upon these people that
[1:35:48] they may have life
[1:35:55] i preached and as he commanded me and
[1:35:58] breath came into them
[1:35:59] and they lived and they stood on their
[1:36:02] feet like an exceeding great army
[1:36:08] those bones that were in the pews
[1:36:12] they got up
[1:36:17] those bones they couldn't sing
[1:36:21] they began to sing a new song those
[1:36:24] bones they couldn't witness
[1:36:26] they began to tell everybody what god
[1:36:27] had done for them
[1:36:29] those bones and couldn't give a
[1:36:30] testimony begin to tell how god healed
[1:36:33] their body
[1:36:34] those bones that were dead now were
[1:36:36] alive
[1:36:39] but that's not the end of the story
[1:36:44] the succeeding great army
[1:36:48] they're on the move for god and ezekiel
[1:36:52] is standing there and he's listening
[1:36:55] he's in amazement i can imagine he's in
[1:36:57] amazement
[1:36:58] wow what my god has done
[1:37:05] what my god has done
[1:37:08] and he said unto him son of man
[1:37:11] these bones are the whole house of
[1:37:13] israel
[1:37:16] now god had done a miraculous work in
[1:37:17] their life hadn't he
[1:37:19] he brought them back he put blood back
[1:37:22] in their bones he put vessels back in he
[1:37:24] gave them
[1:37:25] breath and they're living now but what
[1:37:27] was those bones doing
[1:37:30] listen it said this is the whole house
[1:37:32] of israel and they say
[1:37:38] these once bones that are now a mighty
[1:37:40] army they say
[1:37:42] our bones are dried and our hope is lost
[1:37:47] see they're no different than what we
[1:37:48] can be
[1:37:50] god does mighty works for us we get
[1:37:52] excited we get we get up on the on the
[1:37:55] cloud we're up on the mountain
[1:37:56] everything's going good
[1:37:57] and we feel like everything's going good
[1:37:59] but something happens
[1:38:03] and if we're not careful we say lord
[1:38:08] our bones are dry
[1:38:11] we said in the pews our bones are dry
[1:38:14] our hope is lost
[1:38:19] god couldn't settle for that god
[1:38:22] couldn't settle that he says ezekiel
[1:38:23] you tell them that the living don't
[1:38:25] dwell in the graves with the dead
[1:38:27] that i have breathed the breath of life
[1:38:29] upon them and i'm going to open the
[1:38:31] grave and i'm going to cause them to
[1:38:32] come out
[1:38:33] and i'm going to give them the land that
[1:38:34] is theirs the land of israel
[1:38:39] how god moves
[1:38:44] verse 14 and i shall put my spirit
[1:38:49] in you and you shall live and i shall
[1:38:51] place you in your own land then you
[1:38:53] shall know
[1:38:54] that i the lord have spoken and
[1:38:57] performed it
[1:38:58] saith the lord brothers sisters
[1:39:03] we need to find a place of surrender
[1:39:07] you know i googled fully
[1:39:11] fully surrendered to god i googled it
[1:39:16] sometimes google has more common sense
[1:39:18] than we do
[1:39:22] you know what it says question what does
[1:39:24] it mean to be fully surrendered to god
[1:39:27] and this is the answer word for word to
[1:39:29] surrender in spirituality and religions
[1:39:32] means that a believer
[1:39:35] completely gives up his own will
[1:39:39] and subjects his thoughts his ideas
[1:39:42] his deeds to the will and teaching of
[1:39:46] a higher power and in contrast
[1:39:50] with submission surrender is the willful
[1:39:53] acceptance
[1:39:54] and yielding to a dominating
[1:39:57] force and their will
[1:40:05] let me tell you you do anything for god
[1:40:08] it's going to take you out of your
[1:40:09] comfort zone
[1:40:15] you testify for god it's going to take
[1:40:17] you out of your comfort zone
[1:40:19] you're saying for god you're going to be
[1:40:21] nervous
[1:40:22] your voice is going to quiver
[1:40:26] but you know how you overcome that
[1:40:29] you exercise the gift
[1:40:34] you exercise gift if you don't exercise
[1:40:39] you don't use it you're going to lose it
[1:40:44] you exercise again it don't mean it's
[1:40:46] going to get easier the next time you're
[1:40:47] still going to get nervous let me tell
[1:40:49] you
[1:40:49] i paced that floor till i about where
[1:40:50] the carpet out
[1:40:52] tonight as i was studying today
[1:40:56] it makes my body so cold and i can't
[1:40:58] hardly stand it i touch the joist on her
[1:40:59] neck
[1:41:00] and she said yeah it's cold in his house
[1:41:01] saying that i said no it ain't cold in
[1:41:03] this house i'm nervous
[1:41:09] it don't get any easier
[1:41:13] but we must fully surrender to god
[1:41:16] get into a place that god can lead us
[1:41:18] and guide us
[1:41:19] and move us and take us where he wants
[1:41:22] us to do
[1:41:23] to go and say things he wants us to say
[1:41:28] can i share one thought one experience
[1:41:30] with you one testimony
[1:41:33] i've never shared this in my life with
[1:41:34] anybody maybe my wife
[1:41:39] i was preaching one time several years
[1:41:44] ago
[1:41:46] and i don't know i know what it was but
[1:41:48] i didn't at the time
[1:41:51] but i could feel on my shoulder
[1:41:54] a pressure and it was just like somebody
[1:41:58] had their
[1:41:58] arm laid across my shoulder
[1:42:02] and was pushing me and i would go this
[1:42:04] way
[1:42:05] and when he would turn i would go this
[1:42:07] way and i could keep feeling this
[1:42:09] pressure
[1:42:12] while i was preaching it was weird and
[1:42:14] you know i hardly ever deviate from my
[1:42:16] notes
[1:42:16] and i like my notes in front of me so i
[1:42:19] never go out into the crowd hardly
[1:42:21] and here i went
[1:42:25] no notes and began to preach
[1:42:31] and i could feel this pressure i kept
[1:42:33] feeling this pressure on my arm
[1:42:36] the service was over
[1:42:41] and in my opinion it wasn't nothing
[1:42:42] fantastic
[1:42:45] and i got done i thought
[1:42:48] man i felt so in tune that had to have
[1:42:51] been
[1:42:52] the hand of god leading me over here
[1:42:56] and leading me over over this way and
[1:42:58] taking me down into the people
[1:43:00] that had to be the hand of god and you
[1:43:02] know what happened
[1:43:04] satan said you're crazy
[1:43:07] he said you're crazy he said it wasn't
[1:43:11] the hand of god it's all in your
[1:43:12] imagination
[1:43:13] you just think it was
[1:43:16] and you know what i did i started to
[1:43:18] doubt
[1:43:21] i started to question well maybe it
[1:43:22] wasn't nothing maybe i just really felt
[1:43:24] good and
[1:43:25] it was just free tonight i don't know i
[1:43:28] thought i felt something
[1:43:31] i closed i went to the back closed up my
[1:43:32] bible put my notes up like i always do
[1:43:35] put my coat on walked outside walked up
[1:43:38] to where the people were standing
[1:43:40] and this little brother i'm going to
[1:43:42] call his name
[1:43:44] but he walked up to me and tears were
[1:43:47] streaming
[1:43:48] i'm talking excessively down his face
[1:43:51] and his lip was quivering
[1:43:53] in such a way i thought i said are you
[1:43:54] okay
[1:43:56] he said brother brad he said i don't
[1:44:00] know if you know it
[1:44:01] and i don't know if anybody else saw it
[1:44:03] he said but as you was walking through
[1:44:05] that crowd there was a ball of fire
[1:44:07] up on your shoulder he said i haven't
[1:44:11] seen that since the days of pentecost
[1:44:16] i don't know if it was more for him or
[1:44:18] more for me did i see the pillar of fire
[1:44:21] i didn't see it
[1:44:22] did i feel something i felt it and then
[1:44:24] i doubted because i let satan get in my
[1:44:26] mind
[1:44:28] but god sent him to me to confirm
[1:44:32] that god was on the move you love the
[1:44:35] lord tonight
[1:44:38] let's stand to our feet
[1:44:43] and i don't tell you that i said it's
[1:44:45] the first time i've ever told that story
[1:44:47] and i don't tell
[1:44:48] it for no other reason than this the
[1:44:50] glory of god
[1:44:52] because i'm nothing i don't consider
[1:44:54] myself a good preacher at all
[1:44:56] i just try my best to pray and
[1:44:58] consecrate myself before god
[1:45:01] and deliver what he'd have me to deliver
[1:45:04] and i just let him
[1:45:05] let him do the rest
[1:45:09] let's just bow our heads if we could
[1:45:20] heavenly father we thank you lord
[1:45:24] for this wonderful day
[1:45:27] for you taking the time to come and
[1:45:29] visit us tonight lord
[1:45:31] lord we thank you for your people that's
[1:45:34] made sacrifice
[1:45:35] to come out and to hear the word of god
[1:45:39] that was preached tonight and lord i
[1:45:42] trust with all my heart that if
[1:45:43] something was said to
[1:45:45] encourage and something to inspire to
[1:45:48] lead us in
[1:45:48] into a way that we could find such a
[1:45:51] fellowship with you such a glory divine
[1:45:53] such a a falling of the holy spirit in
[1:45:55] our lives as individuals
[1:45:58] lord that we would not only read our
[1:46:00] bible not only pray do those things
[1:46:02] that are obedient to you father but that
[1:46:04] we could also
[1:46:05] find fellowship with believers of light
[1:46:09] precious face
[1:46:10] that we could share the gospel as it's
[1:46:13] been shared to us
[1:46:15] lord if if i'd never heard about this
[1:46:17] where would i be today
[1:46:19] if nobody had ever taken the time to to
[1:46:21] invite me or my parents didn't take time
[1:46:23] to send me to church as a young boy
[1:46:27] you know that's becoming a thing of the
[1:46:29] past
[1:46:30] to take kids to church in the world
[1:46:34] and as each generation goes by lord we
[1:46:37] know that it gets harder and harder
[1:46:39] and people get further and further and
[1:46:41] further away
[1:46:42] and lord is that we know that the only
[1:46:44] light in this last day will be the light
[1:46:46] that we
[1:46:46] shine and reflect you upon the people
[1:46:49] lord
[1:46:51] so lord it's my desire and it's my
[1:46:54] heart's prayer tonight that
[1:46:55] we get so close to you father so in tune
[1:46:58] with you father
[1:46:59] that we can feel you lead us and guide
[1:47:02] us
[1:47:03] and that as we speak the thoughts come
[1:47:05] into our mind and we speak the very
[1:47:07] thoughts
[1:47:08] of god that we could be witnesses
[1:47:11] that we could be a living testimony
[1:47:15] that we can sing the praises and we can
[1:47:18] get over the
[1:47:19] the embarrassment or we can get over the
[1:47:21] the shyness
[1:47:22] or or the nervousness and be able to
[1:47:25] submit ourselves
[1:47:26] and to to do what you would have us to
[1:47:28] do so that we could be a blessing to the
[1:47:30] others
[1:47:31] around us as ezekiel looked out across
[1:47:34] that valley he seen nothing
[1:47:36] but death he was afraid to even answer
[1:47:38] you father
[1:47:41] but lord when you ask him can these
[1:47:43] bones live you knew the answer lord
[1:47:47] and no matter how dry we may get no
[1:47:49] matter how stale we may get up on the
[1:47:51] word and upon
[1:47:52] the movement of the spirit lord we know
[1:47:54] that if you'll just pour out your
[1:47:56] self if you'll open those floodgates of
[1:47:58] heaven and let your
[1:47:59] holy ghost rain down upon us father
[1:48:03] that we can get right back in tune with
[1:48:06] you
