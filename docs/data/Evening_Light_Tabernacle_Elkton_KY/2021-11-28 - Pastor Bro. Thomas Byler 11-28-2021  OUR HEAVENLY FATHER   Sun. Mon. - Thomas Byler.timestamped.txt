[0:00] me jump up here to the
[0:02] fifth chapter of john
[0:07] i was reading that uh devotional it's a
[0:10] couple of days ahead
[0:12] and i was just thinking
[0:15] this morning
[0:17] i was thinking we're a few days away
[0:18] from
[0:20] from december 7th and it's hard to
[0:22] believe that that was 80 years ago
[0:25] where the united states was attacked by
[0:27] japanese forces uh 80 years ago was
[0:29] pretty quick i guess
[0:30] before you know it i was just telling
[0:32] jeanette this morning you know a young
[0:34] man that was on one of those ships in
[0:36] pearl harbor if he was 19 or 20 years
[0:39] old then he'd be 100 years old today you
[0:41] know and that just seems like a short
[0:43] time ago
[0:45] but uh let me uh read get to hear first
[0:48] i hope this is the right one
[0:50] if you wanted to where this quote comes
[0:52] out if you wanted
[0:54] one of the messages faith is our victory
[0:57] and it's
[0:58] october 4th 1958
[1:01] let me just read a few of these
[1:02] scriptures here before i go off on a
[1:05] tangent here
[1:06] and it starts at the first verse here it
[1:08] says
[1:10] whoever believeth that jesus christ is
[1:13] the christ and born of god
[1:14] everyone that loved him that begotteth
[1:17] love with him and also he that is
[1:19] begotten of him
[1:20] by this know that we love the children
[1:23] of god when we love god and keep his
[1:25] commandments
[1:27] for the for this is the love of god that
[1:29] we keep his commandments and his
[1:32] and his commandments are not grievous
[1:35] so whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[1:38] the world and this is the victory that
[1:40] overcome with the world even our faith
[1:43] and who is he that overcometh the world
[1:45] but he that believeth that jesus christ
[1:47] is the son of god and it goes kind of
[1:49] what the brothers have been preaching
[1:52] the last week you know everyone
[1:54] has to come to that relationship with
[1:56] what you believe but i was just reading
[1:58] this this morning
[2:00] uh
[2:01] and it comes out of the december sixth
[2:03] devotional
[2:04] and uh i'm just this first paragraph
[2:07] really struck me and you know the world
[2:09] that we're in was has so many diversions
[2:11] out there it's
[2:12] pulling people left and right they have
[2:15] no foundation anymore in their lives
[2:17] they're just all over the place and i'll
[2:19] just read what brother branham had to
[2:21] say here
[2:22] when you come to him
[2:24] don't come as a floater and that's what
[2:26] the world is right now everyone's a
[2:27] floater they're here they're they're
[2:29] never consistent walking down the road
[2:31] in the middle of the road
[2:33] i'll go up and try it and see if it
[2:35] works you'll never get nowhere
[2:38] when you come with this kind of
[2:40] determination that you are sold out
[2:42] stock and barrel
[2:44] when you're
[2:45] tired of the world and sin and unbelief
[2:48] and the frustrations and doubts that
[2:50] come
[2:51] to the living god with an anchor surely
[2:53] tightened in the rock of ages and
[2:55] brother thomas and all the men of the
[2:57] preach across the pulpit have taught you
[2:59] that you got to have that anchor you
[3:01] have to have that post in the ground
[3:02] where you know that you know that god
[3:04] has done it for you if you don't have
[3:06] that then you're going to be floating
[3:08] like brother branham's saying here in
[3:10] your relationship with jesus christ but
[3:13] once you meet the master then you'd
[3:14] settle like this people talk about and
[3:17] i'll go on and read this here
[3:19] holy spirit there you pull you into the
[3:21] presence of the living god that you will
[3:23] give you a faith that'll overcome
[3:26] anything that is in the world sickness
[3:28] disease even death itself
[3:30] and i can see in the age that we're
[3:32] living this morning that is really
[3:34] important that you have that foundation
[3:36] that you have that anchor in your soul i
[3:39] know i say it a lot but you have to have
[3:41] that anchor in your soul
[3:43] and he goes on to say here you say that
[3:46] you said death brother branham that's
[3:48] what i meant death was it not lazarus
[3:50] who was laying dead in the ground and
[3:52] that already corruption set in when
[3:54] jesus said to martha
[3:56] well where have you buried him and if
[3:58] you don't doubt you shall see the glory
[4:00] of god and i believe the same thing
[4:02] today whatever your need is if you don't
[4:04] doubt i'm sure that god i i know that
[4:06] he'll meet your need
[4:08] do not
[4:09] do not tell you not to doubt he said
[4:12] he said to jairus that day if you only
[4:14] believe you will see the glory of god
[4:17] then faith overcomes death faith is the
[4:19] victory over death
[4:21] faith is the victory over sin faith is
[4:23] the victory over sickness
[4:25] faith is the victory over worry
[4:27] faith is the victory over frustration
[4:30] faith is the victory over the world i
[4:32] know in my own life
[4:34] that's really important to victory over
[4:35] frustration i find as i get older i can
[4:38] only
[4:39] speak for myself i wind up getting more
[4:41] frustrated in the things that i do and
[4:44] he goes on to you say john when he wrote
[4:46] that he did not have any troubles he did
[4:49] not have any have to deal with the folks
[4:51] that i deal with when we know this isn't
[4:53] true
[4:54] you know john's day was just as bad as
[4:56] our day or
[4:57] our day might be worse in a in a mental
[5:00] sense but his in a physical sense
[5:03] and the same thought you may not have to
[5:05] overcome the same thing but he never
[5:07] excluded them for he said this faith is
[5:10] the victory that overcomes the world and
[5:12] the whole thing how is it it's faith in
[5:15] it right above it when we have the
[5:17] written word of god laying before us and
[5:20] the holy spirit performing and showing
[5:22] the resurrection of the lord jesus you
[5:24] know that happens in every heart it's
[5:26] this morning if you're believing and
[5:29] what the vine promises written there
[5:31] whatsoever thing you desire when you
[5:33] pray believe you receive it and you
[5:35] shall have it
[5:37] what do you have to do then have faith
[5:40] just not floating faith and that's what
[5:41] i was thinking about not floating back
[5:43] and forth in what you believe but your
[5:45] your foundation is firm and you're
[5:48] moving forward
[5:49] not just make a make-believe faith but a
[5:51] real faith now faith is the conqueror
[5:53] faith is an overcomer it just isn't a
[5:55] peace maker it overcomes faith is the
[5:58] victory that overcomes the world what
[6:00] does it do what is faith
[6:03] what does the conqueror conquer the
[6:04] victory is the same to conquer it means
[6:07] to beat down the override to handcuff to
[6:10] throw into prison it means that sin that
[6:12] once ruled you you rule it now
[6:15] it means that you have overcome it and
[6:17] you have whipped it
[6:18] and you you're greater than it and
[6:20] that's the most important the same
[6:22] things that possessed you 20 35 or a
[6:26] year ago shouldn't be possessing you
[6:28] today you should be moving forward in
[6:30] your relationship
[6:32] with jesus christ brother david

[33:39] our series that all right
[33:41] amen and so this morning um i wanted to
[33:44] speak on the creator god the creator
[33:48] but
[33:48] it kind of
[33:50] amen uh went into something a little
[33:53] different but i mean it certainly will
[33:55] have to do with the great creator but
[33:57] uh if you will turn your bibles
[34:00] to
[34:02] i think we'll go into isaiah first let's
[34:05] go to isaiah
[34:09] the 9th chapter
[34:11] and then we'll give you our title
[34:15] another one of god's
[34:18] attributes we're talking about god's
[34:20] attributes for those of you who haven't
[34:22] been here for the last few services
[34:24] we've been talking about the attributes
[34:26] of god all that he is all the different
[34:29] things that god is
[34:31] amen
[34:32] you know he's the everlasting father
[34:34] he's the prince of peace he's he's the
[34:36] creator he's redeemer and he just goes
[34:39] on and on and on this morning we want to
[34:42] read in isaiah 9
[34:44] um
[34:45] and beginning with verse 6. amen
[34:51] for unto us a child is born unto us a
[34:55] son is given
[34:56] and the government shall be upon his
[34:58] shoulder and his name shall be called
[35:01] wonderful
[35:02] counselor
[35:04] the mighty god
[35:06] the everlasting father
[35:08] the prince of peace
[35:10] of the increase of his government and
[35:12] peace that there shall be no end
[35:14] upon the throne of david and upon his
[35:16] kingdom to order it and to establish it
[35:19] with judgment and with justice from
[35:21] henceforth
[35:22] even forever the seal of the lord of
[35:24] hosts will perform this amen may god had
[35:27] his blessings to the reading of the
[35:28] words you can be seated
[35:30] amen
[35:31] and we'll title this this morning the
[35:33] everlasting
[35:34] father amen we want to talk about
[35:37] our father amen talking about god
[35:40] as a father amen
[35:44] so that's what we want to speak on
[35:46] amen over in the book of ephesians over
[35:48] in the book of ephesians i want to go
[35:51] amen in
[35:53] chapter four
[35:57] if you'll notice there it said that he
[35:59] was the ever
[36:00] lasting father amen
[36:04] and in ephesians 4
[36:06] and verse 4 says there is one body
[36:10] and one spirit even as ye are called in
[36:13] one hope of your calling
[36:16] there's one lord
[36:18] one faith
[36:21] one baptism
[36:23] and one god and father
[36:27] of all
[36:32] you all amen
[36:34] so how many believes there's one father
[36:38] only one father amen this is a very
[36:41] interesting thing
[36:43] you know because even jesus when he was
[36:45] here on earth
[36:46] he kept talking about the father i do
[36:48] nothing but what the father showed me
[36:50] first and kept talking about the father
[36:52] and the disciples were
[36:55] you know they couldn't
[36:56] couldn't stand themselves anymore
[36:59] and uh he says they asked he says you
[37:02] know show us the father and it'll
[37:04] satisfy us
[37:06] they wanted to know who this father was
[37:08] amen
[37:10] and so
[37:12] you know that you know trinitarianism
[37:15] you know and and you know there is such
[37:17] a thing let me say this there is such a
[37:19] thing as god the father
[37:21] the son
[37:23] and got the holy ghost
[37:26] amen how many believes that
[37:29] now
[37:31] most of the time when you say those
[37:33] words us believers we're like whoa stop
[37:35] watch out you know
[37:37] amen but truly there is one god the
[37:40] father
[37:42] the one god became the son
[37:44] and in the holy ghost is god
[37:47] because the bible says that which is
[37:49] conceived of mary is of the holy ghost
[37:53] right so the holy ghost was jesus's
[37:56] father
[37:57] that's right so the holy spirit is the
[37:59] father
[38:00] amen and we know that all he did all
[38:03] that god did was go into different
[38:05] offices
[38:07] amen so god the father father how many
[38:10] know the father is not a name
[38:13] son is not a name this name of the holy
[38:16] ghost is not holy ghost amen
[38:19] or christ should i say how many knows
[38:20] the name of the holy ghost is christ
[38:23] that's right praise the lord
[38:25] but anyway we don't want to go into that
[38:27] too much but notice here how he says
[38:29] that he is
[38:30] father
[38:31] of all
[38:32] i like that
[38:34] and the next phrase i also like he says
[38:36] who is above all
[38:40] this father is above everything
[38:44] how many knows in the family
[38:46] who's the head of the house
[38:49] the father
[38:51] the dad
[38:52] he is responsible for that family
[38:56] he's the head of that body ahead of that
[38:58] family
[39:00] who is the head of the father
[39:04] christ who's the head of christ
[39:07] come on now the bible clearly says the
[39:10] head of christ is god
[39:12] that's right amen because we're all
[39:14] under authority amen
[39:16] but anyway so
[39:18] we want to talk about the father for a
[39:19] little bit and i really don't want to
[39:22] keep you all day but this might take a
[39:23] little bit
[39:26] because when we we want to we want to
[39:28] transition from the father to his
[39:30] children right
[39:32] but we want to just talk about how that
[39:34] the father is above all
[39:36] amen and through you all and in all and
[39:39] through you all he is above everything
[39:41] there is nothing
[39:42] above god amen and over in isaiah if
[39:46] you'll notice
[39:48] a little phrase that he says
[39:51] he says
[39:53] the government shall be upon his
[39:55] shoulder the way that prophet god
[39:57] explained that
[39:58] was that in other words the rulership
[40:01] is upon his shoulder in other words if
[40:04] the burden of rumorship is on his
[40:07] shoulder
[40:08] how many knows that the burden of ruling
[40:11] is on his shoulder and brother ben
[40:12] described in some wife getting married
[40:14] and putting her veil off of her face
[40:16] onto the man's shoulder showing that he
[40:19] now takes responsibility complete
[40:21] responsibility for it
[40:23] he is responsible for all her burdens
[40:25] are on him now right
[40:27] and so that's the way it is with god all
[40:30] of your burdens are on god's sober all
[40:33] of your cares are on god's shoulder
[40:36] amen aren't you glad for that
[40:39] i'm very thankful for that
[40:41] over and let's go to another one in uh
[40:44] matthew we'll talk about the father a
[40:46] little bit more here in matthew 6
[40:50] and verse
[40:52] i believe it's all the way over here
[40:54] in 26
[40:56] jesus says behold the fouls of the air
[40:59] for they so not neither do they reap
[41:01] nor gather into barns yet your heavenly
[41:04] father
[41:06] feedeth them are ye not much better than
[41:09] they
[41:11] amen
[41:12] but random he talked about a bird and
[41:16] you know how that the birds how did they
[41:17] have don't have
[41:19] arthritis or or or diabetes and you
[41:22] don't see them on crotches and
[41:24] wheelchairs and all these things you
[41:26] know
[41:27] and you don't see a bird worrying about
[41:29] things
[41:31] amen you know consider the foul look at
[41:33] the foul how they're taken care of now
[41:36] you know there's something about a
[41:38] father naturally speaking in a family
[41:43] if anybody ought to get gray hairs it's
[41:45] the husband
[41:47] it's the father why because he worries
[41:50] about or cares about every detail of
[41:53] that family
[41:56] every little detail
[41:59] amen and when we get neglectful about
[42:01] things that's where we end up paying for
[42:04] it
[42:04] when we neglect those things that are
[42:07] needful
[42:09] amen
[42:11] amen
[42:12] a lot of times it's just a just not
[42:14] necessarily
[42:15] finances or clothing or shoes or perhaps
[42:18] affection perhaps the emotional part
[42:21] hello
[42:22] of our wives or spouses different things
[42:24] you know
[42:26] you know
[42:26] i've learned one thing and one thing
[42:28] i've learned in your life and that is
[42:30] when your wife has to yell a little bit
[42:32] you better listen a little harder
[42:36] yeah because you raise their voice they
[42:38] get allowed because they want to get
[42:40] your attention
[42:42] you know they're not just doing it
[42:44] because you know they like to yell at
[42:45] you no they're trying to get
[42:48] to get the sound through
[42:51] they're trying to get you to hear
[42:54] what they really have need of what they
[42:55] really want
[42:59] how many believes that the wife really
[43:01] had to have the same thing right
[43:04] and then when the husband perhaps get a
[43:05] little loud hey listen honey huh
[43:10] well listen honey didn't work listen
[43:12] honey
[43:14] oh boy i didn't mean to go here but here
[43:16] we go
[43:19] you know brother banner talked about the
[43:21] church and so forth and i think
[43:23] the pastor neville brother neville or
[43:25] one of them that was the pastor and he
[43:26] said brother brother neville is real
[43:28] timid and he just talks softly but i i
[43:31] don't have a problem saying sit down
[43:35] all right brother brandon he'll get loud
[43:37] he'll get he'll get right frank brother
[43:38] brandon did because he was a little
[43:39] built a little different
[43:41] he meant how many knows he didn't mind
[43:42] screaming you know come on i heard my
[43:44] people
[43:45] he didn't mind calling them lodges
[43:47] instead of churches
[43:49] he maybe he got a little harder you know
[43:51] but listen so the father amen he cares
[43:54] your father is intricate how many
[43:56] believes that god cares our heavenly
[43:59] father cares about you
[44:02] you ought to be very happy this morning
[44:05] that you have a heavenly father as i got
[44:08] to thinking about this subject i got to
[44:09] thinking about how that this world has
[44:12] daddy issues
[44:16] this world has daddy issues
[44:20] that's the whole thing is any issues
[44:23] because how many knows there's only two
[44:25] fathers in this world
[44:27] there's only two fathers one of them is
[44:30] god and the other is the devil
[44:33] because
[44:35] listen to this if you remember the
[44:37] scribes and the pharisees they began to
[44:40] say that he was illegitimate born and he
[44:42] has the devil on him don't we say well
[44:44] and he got into this out of the other
[44:46] and they said you know jesus said if you
[44:48] were abraham's seed you hear what i said
[44:50] you know because they kept saying we are
[44:52] but we have abraham as our father jesus
[44:55] said if abraham was your father
[44:59] you would hear my words
[45:02] but because my words don't have any
[45:04] place in you you're not abraham's not
[45:06] your daddy then that was your daddy
[45:14] that's getting plain that's getting
[45:16] rough
[45:17] telling them your daddy is the devil if
[45:20] the devil is your father
[45:25] listen to me very carefully because
[45:26] jesus said my sheep they hear my voice
[45:31] let me tell you something if you are of
[45:34] god and if you are a son of god
[45:37] if he truly is your daddy when you hear
[45:40] the truth you will hear it
[45:42] and you will accept it
[45:45] period
[45:47] if you do not accept the truth when it's
[45:49] presented to you remember your daddy is
[45:53] the father of lies and that all you'll
[45:56] accept is lies
[46:02] deception
[46:04] huh
[46:05] oh bible said that but it doesn't really
[46:08] mean it
[46:11] not the devil that's what they believe
[46:14] well the bible says there's only one god
[46:18] how many know there's only one god
[46:21] let me just read another one we'll try
[46:22] to pick this up a little bit here
[46:24] if we can i believe it's in
[46:26] i hope i wrote this the last one down
[46:29] i know i had it looked up
[46:33] first corinthians
[46:36] first corinthians i know it was in first
[46:38] corinthians
[46:42] eight
[46:43] number verse four we'll start with verse
[46:45] four
[46:46] according
[46:48] as concerning therefore the eating of
[46:51] those things that are offered in
[46:52] sacrifice unto idols
[46:55] we know that an idol is nothing in the
[46:57] world
[46:59] and that there is none other god
[47:03] but one
[47:05] people don't know that do they
[47:07] they have three different gods now
[47:09] there's only one god
[47:11] amen what's his name
[47:13] jesus
[47:15] that's his right his name is jesus when
[47:18] thomas fell down and worshiped him says
[47:20] my lord
[47:22] and my god let me tell you something you
[47:24] could have believed in more than one god
[47:26] if he says no no no don't worship me
[47:29] worship the father only
[47:31] he just said that you could have
[47:32] believed something like that but he
[47:34] never did he accepted the worship am i
[47:37] right because he was god
[47:40] amen the fullness of the godhead the
[47:42] bible says dwells in him
[47:46] amen if you've seen me you've seen the
[47:48] father
[47:51] oh my
[47:52] oh my getting ahead of myself but then i
[47:54] say it
[47:56] and at that day there will come a day
[47:58] there will come a day jesus said at that
[48:00] day you will know that i am in my father
[48:03] my father is in me i am in you and you
[48:06] are in me
[48:08] so where is the father this morning
[48:11] he's right in your heart that's where he
[48:13] is
[48:17] think about it
[48:19] where is the father right here
[48:22] when i pray i don't pray to a god that's
[48:24] way out in the eons of spakes
[48:27] if that is where he is you are praying a
[48:30] prayer of repentance because he's not in
[48:33] there
[48:35] but when he's in there you don't have to
[48:37] go very far to pray he's right there
[48:41] he's the holy ghost
[48:43] and he's right in your heart
[48:45] that day you'll know that i am in the
[48:47] father i'm you are and he is in me and i
[48:49] am in him you're in me and i'm in you
[48:50] you'll find out we're all one
[48:56] don't get me excited here
[48:58] but brother brett i've got my father's
[49:00] blood running through me
[49:02] oh brother had don't i've never had to
[49:05] be a man come and join the byler family
[49:09] i was pouring the violer
[49:12] i've got violent blood i've got violent
[49:14] flash i've got filer looks i've got
[49:17] milor actions
[49:20] no
[49:21] that's right i look in the mirror
[49:22] sometimes i say a little bit of my dad
[49:24] right there in my nose or in my lips or
[49:26] my eyes i see a little my
[49:28] dad huh
[49:32] that's right
[49:34] how about spiritually
[49:36] that's the way it is
[49:38] people ought to look at you and say boy
[49:40] i'll tell you you look a little like
[49:42] jesus
[49:45] oh my
[49:46] now notice but one
[49:49] for though there be
[49:52] that are called gods
[49:54] whether in heaven or in earth
[49:56] as there be many gods
[50:00] do you hear that the bible says to be
[50:02] many gods
[50:05] amen
[50:07] and many lords
[50:10] but
[50:11] to us there is but
[50:13] one god
[50:15] the father
[50:17] amen
[50:18] god
[50:19] the father
[50:20] how many believe that god
[50:22] is the father
[50:24] of all
[50:26] there is nothing that was made
[50:29] outside of the father
[50:30] he's the head of it all
[50:33] of whom are
[50:35] all things
[50:38] and we
[50:39] in him
[50:41] and one lord jesus christ by whom are
[50:44] all things and we by him my point of
[50:48] reading that was that there is only one
[50:51] true god
[50:52] all the others are amateur gods
[50:55] even moses when god told moses you're
[50:58] going to be like god
[51:00] huh
[51:01] or instead of god and aaron's going to
[51:04] be a prophet
[51:06] huh
[51:07] and that's where the catholics get ins
[51:09] vicarious philadelphi
[51:11] instead of god
[51:13] they think they're instead of god
[51:15] they act as instead of god
[51:18] second thessalonians the second chapter
[51:20] says he's gonna sit in the temples of
[51:22] god showing himself that he is god
[51:25] he's going to take the place of god
[51:27] but what's he doing
[51:29] let me tell you what he's doing he's
[51:30] imitating your place
[51:34] he's imitating our plates
[51:38] because we are the ones that are the
[51:39] amateur gods
[51:43] we are here instead of christ
[51:47] in instead is that right he is using you
[51:50] he's using me
[51:52] not the antichrist
[51:55] amen
[51:56] because it's always
[51:57] a dollar bill fake dollar bill has to
[51:59] look like a real dollar bill
[52:03] amen
[52:04] but think about this back to matthew
[52:06] just for a second there let me finish
[52:08] that scripture can we
[52:15] oh my
[52:19] the fowls they don't gather they don't
[52:21] reap
[52:22] you don't gather into barns
[52:24] yet your heavenly father feeded them are
[52:27] you not much better than they
[52:31] thank you jesus i mean you really don't
[52:34] have to worry about stuff
[52:36] your heavenly father is taking care of
[52:38] you
[52:40] he is watching over
[52:42] your health he is watching over your
[52:44] finances he is watching over
[52:47] your attitude he is watching over your
[52:49] spirit he is keeping you from harm
[52:53] he is protecting you he's watching over
[52:56] you
[52:57] amen oh hallelujah aren't you glad for
[53:01] that
[53:03] oh man which of you by taking thought
[53:05] can add one statute to his stature and
[53:08] why take he thought for raymond consider
[53:11] the lilies of the field how they grow
[53:13] they dwell not neither do they spin
[53:17] and yet i say unto you that even solomon
[53:19] in all of his glory was not arrayed like
[53:21] one of these wherefore if god so clothed
[53:23] the grass of the field which today is
[53:25] and tomorrow's cast into the oven shall
[53:27] he not much more clothe yet clothe you o
[53:29] ye of little faith
[53:31] never take no thought saying what shall
[53:32] we eat or what shall we drink or where
[53:34] with all shall we be of a clothe
[53:39] come on folks let's be real honest
[53:42] this is what we think about most of the
[53:44] time
[53:48] where am i going to live what am i going
[53:49] to wear what am i going to drive i'm
[53:50] going to pay my bills
[53:53] huh
[53:54] it's time to take on god's thoughts
[53:57] quit worrying so much about that
[54:00] quit thinking so much about that you got
[54:01] to do that i mean we all got to work you
[54:04] don't work you don't need sure we got to
[54:05] do all of that but that is not your
[54:07] primary thought pattern huh
[54:11] or where shall we be close but these are
[54:13] the things that the gentiles seek after
[54:15] for your heavenly father knoweth that
[54:19] you have need of these things but seek
[54:21] ye first the kingdom of god and his
[54:24] righteousness and all these things shall
[54:26] be added unto you
[54:30] if you really want to be blessed just
[54:32] seek the kingdom first
[54:34] put god first in everything and that all
[54:37] the rest be secondary
[54:39] then god will take care of you
[54:44] i'm afraid that we have taken care of
[54:46] ourselves so much until we don't rely on
[54:49] god to take care of us
[54:51] we go ballistic if something
[54:54] doesn't quite go the way we want it to
[54:56] go
[54:57] when we want it to go
[54:58] how good it wanted to go
[55:00] or if something goes badly wrong
[55:03] we lose it also
[55:08] praise be to god
[55:10] all right let me turn a little bit
[55:15] so we know our heavenly father cares
[55:17] about us he's over everything he's the
[55:19] watcher of he's our heavenly father
[55:22] amen
[55:27] in genesis 1
[55:29] 26 and god
[55:31] god said let us make man
[55:33] in our image
[55:34] in our likeness
[55:36] and let them have dominion over the fish
[55:38] of the sea
[55:39] over the file of the air over the cattle
[55:41] over all the earth and over every
[55:43] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[55:44] earth so god created man in his own
[55:47] image
[55:49] and in the image of god created he him
[55:53] male and female created he them
[55:56] and he blessed them and god said
[56:00] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[56:02] the earth and subdue it amen
[56:06] and have dominion
[56:08] over the fish of the sea over the fowl
[56:10] of the air and over every living thing
[56:12] that moveth upon the earth
[56:15] hallelujah
[56:16] how many knows that we were original to
[56:19] have to be the god of the earth
[56:22] he was the god of heaven but god gave
[56:24] adam the authority over everything
[56:31] how many knows he could say to a
[56:33] mountain be moved and it would be moved
[56:36] he could say peace be still
[56:38] and it was still just like jesus did
[56:42] huh he could just speak the word
[56:46] and it would be done he got to name all
[56:48] the cows and the cattle the horse and
[56:50] everything else
[56:54] that's right so god gave him a dominion
[56:57] he gave him authority over the earth
[57:00] but you know what we have a problem with
[57:02] today this after the fall when we didn't
[57:05] come the way that we were supposed to by
[57:07] the way of the spoken word and we came
[57:10] by sexual desire after the fall we know
[57:13] that we were born wrong
[57:16] amen we fell from that place that we
[57:19] were supposed to be
[57:24] a ruler
[57:27] oh my
[57:28] hitler he had it in him he had a natural
[57:31] way of thinking about it supremacy
[57:35] huh
[57:38] supreme overall rule
[57:42] what did japan the same way they wanted
[57:44] to rule
[57:45] they thought they were supreme they were
[57:47] wanting to rule all
[57:49] china's got a little taste of it right
[57:50] now they like the rural world
[57:55] sure building up their army the way that
[57:57] they are
[57:59] that's just the carnal man
[58:02] folks i have new for you
[58:04] there's going to be one that
[58:06] rules it's going to be god
[58:10] amen but god give us a dominion
[58:13] now after fall man lost that
[58:16] now we do good to rule over our flesh
[58:23] but how many believes that we as fathers
[58:25] we as sons of god
[58:28] we should be like god
[58:30] and rule
[58:32] that we should subdue every enemy under
[58:35] our feet
[58:38] amen
[58:41] i mean the more i got into this subject
[58:43] tomorrow i realized i needed to have an
[58:44] altar call we all need to be at it
[58:47] including myself
[58:51] because i believe god put it this way to
[58:53] church as far from the place that it
[58:55] should be preached on the adoption
[58:56] series four times and he talked about
[58:58] how did we got to learn our place in
[59:01] christ where we belong to be
[59:03] amen
[59:05] that's right
[59:07] now notice let me just read you a quote
[59:09] or something too scary
[59:11] amen remember when a man is saved he
[59:14] becomes eternal life in his heart and as
[59:16] you're able to push out all the roots of
[59:18] bitterness then that god begins to
[59:20] spread in you
[59:22] then you become a son of god
[59:26] amen
[59:27] a man was made to be a god
[59:31] huh do you know that he's in the image
[59:34] of god he's a son of god
[59:39] we don't realize what a son of god is
[59:42] it's to be god-like
[59:44] it's to be like oh i like that so oh to
[59:46] be like him oh to be like him
[59:50] amen i love that song wish i could sing
[59:52] it better know it better but if you have
[59:54] a if you've got god at all ninja you
[59:57] have a desire to be
[59:59] like him
[1:00:01] amen
[1:00:03] to be
[1:00:05] like god
[1:00:07] amen he was in the image of god he's
[1:00:09] like him and he was given a dominion
[1:00:12] dominion over the whole earth he ruled
[1:00:14] the earth
[1:00:18] he ruled the animal kingdom all the
[1:00:20] kingdoms
[1:00:22] all but the kingdom of god above
[1:00:24] remember he's our heavenly father
[1:00:26] amen
[1:00:27] and he was god he was an amateur
[1:00:30] god
[1:00:31] a lesser god
[1:00:34] how many knows
[1:00:35] what different
[1:00:37] satan the devil before he was kicked out
[1:00:39] of heaven when he was god's right hand i
[1:00:41] believe the prophet said he deviated
[1:00:44] nothing with god he had all the
[1:00:45] authority god had except one thing he
[1:00:48] couldn't do
[1:00:50] what was it
[1:00:52] create
[1:00:54] amen he could not create
[1:00:57] the devil cannot
[1:00:59] create
[1:01:01] that's the difference he has to take
[1:01:03] it's what is created and make something
[1:01:05] with it and that's what man does
[1:01:07] he take something that god has already
[1:01:09] created
[1:01:10] why because we as
[1:01:12] uh not only are we amateur gods but
[1:01:15] we're also amateur creators
[1:01:20] we love to make things
[1:01:22] build things
[1:01:26] and boy oh boy
[1:01:29] country talk here boy oh boy
[1:01:32] you talk about what man has created
[1:01:35] what man has made
[1:01:37] what we have gone to in the last 100
[1:01:39] years
[1:01:41] think about
[1:01:42] we can't we can't fathom okay you and i
[1:01:45] can't fathom
[1:01:46] just a little lifespan we had do you
[1:01:48] realize there was 2 000 years from the
[1:01:52] time of christ that we went through
[1:01:54] and the way all the way up to the late
[1:01:56] 1700s or
[1:01:58] or 1800s
[1:02:00] close to 1900s right right right right
[1:02:02] about that time is when they begin to
[1:02:05] invent things and find things and stuff
[1:02:06] they had never invented for truth out
[1:02:08] why didn't they get smarter quicker
[1:02:13] huh it's quite something isn't it all
[1:02:15] god holds it back
[1:02:17] he don't let no benjamin franklin's come
[1:02:19] and thomas edison and all of them come
[1:02:22] until it's time
[1:02:23] for the light to be in minute
[1:02:25] until all these things is to be invented
[1:02:28] in that right he held it back to all of
[1:02:29] that wisdom knowledge shall be in the
[1:02:31] increase in the end time is what the
[1:02:33] bible says
[1:02:35] now right
[1:02:36] and there we are right there how that
[1:02:38] man has progressed and what we've built
[1:02:40] and man you look at the skyscrapers and
[1:02:42] look at everything they've done and all
[1:02:44] the inventions even to our cell phone
[1:02:49] hey remember
[1:02:50] when we first started out all we had was
[1:02:53] the uh uh what do you call that you go
[1:02:56] boop
[1:02:57] what's that call
[1:03:02] morris code yeah that telegraph
[1:03:04] telegraph right and you know i mean that
[1:03:06] was
[1:03:08] can you imagine
[1:03:10] you know
[1:03:11] to where we had the phones on the wall
[1:03:13] we had
[1:03:16] dial all the numbers up right
[1:03:19] now folks if you want to have three four
[1:03:21] people online you're gonna tap them all
[1:03:23] in right
[1:03:25] my look at the cell phone look at where
[1:03:27] we went to
[1:03:28] why because man is a creator
[1:03:31] you know it's in him to create it's in
[1:03:34] him to evolve because why there's one
[1:03:37] big difference between you and the
[1:03:39] animal kingdom
[1:03:40] guess what they're still back in the
[1:03:42] dark ages the birds and all that they do
[1:03:44] things that they have always done the
[1:03:46] very same way
[1:03:48] we seem to have done the same thing for
[1:03:51] all of that time
[1:03:53] huh
[1:03:55] but it was in man to be creative to be
[1:03:57] like god in the image of god we were
[1:04:00] created
[1:04:01] now think about what we would do
[1:04:03] if we would take the spiritual side of
[1:04:05] that
[1:04:08] if we would take the spiritual side and
[1:04:10] if we would progress
[1:04:13] because we have an intelligence folks i
[1:04:15] mean those our intelligence
[1:04:18] doesn't really have a barrier
[1:04:21] unless you figure things out that's why
[1:04:23] we're flying
[1:04:24] 300 people in the airplane through the
[1:04:26] air from one side the other
[1:04:28] there's really no barrier we are we are
[1:04:30] a person we are we have been given
[1:04:33] reasoning we've been allowed to reason
[1:04:40] and that could be good and that can be
[1:04:42] bad
[1:04:43] isn't that right
[1:04:45] but actually god has put it put that
[1:04:47] reasoning in there to make every rich
[1:04:50] person responsible and accountable
[1:04:54] and to be able to judge them for the
[1:04:56] decisions that they make
[1:04:59] the choices that they make called free
[1:05:01] moral agency
[1:05:03] female agency comes in there amen and
[1:05:05] man becomes accountable you know
[1:05:08] for what he says isn't that isn't that
[1:05:10] crazy this world
[1:05:13] like brother brian saying it's it's the
[1:05:15] world's getting crazier all the time
[1:05:20] who'd have thought that somebody as
[1:05:22] crazy as would think that you need to
[1:05:24] get rid of the police that it would
[1:05:26] actually happen
[1:05:28] surely that wouldn't happen right but
[1:05:30] yeah it's happening
[1:05:31] and it was crazy yeah it was dumb
[1:05:38] we embrace dumb ideas
[1:05:41] what do we get killed
[1:05:44] that's right
[1:05:45] death amen
[1:05:48] but anyway all right so think about it
[1:05:52] intelligence
[1:05:53] god allowed us to be able to figure
[1:05:56] things out
[1:05:59] to grow
[1:06:01] to advance
[1:06:04] i'm just glad that god
[1:06:06] made a way that we could make a choice
[1:06:09] and advance because without calvary how
[1:06:11] many knows it didn't matter how much you
[1:06:13] knew
[1:06:14] no matter how much you wanted to you
[1:06:16] could never advance spiritually
[1:06:19] why because he was born and since
[1:06:21] shaping the becoming the world
[1:06:22] speaking lies no matter how much you
[1:06:24] tried to overcome no matter how much you
[1:06:27] tried to rule your spirit you could not
[1:06:30] rule your spirit
[1:06:33] the bible says he that rule of his
[1:06:35] spirit is stronger than the man that
[1:06:37] takes a city
[1:06:40] huh
[1:06:42] can control yourself
[1:06:44] [Music]
[1:06:46] and i want you to know that god's
[1:06:48] children god's sons
[1:06:50] oh they're led by the spirit of god
[1:06:53] and they have the power of god
[1:06:56] to overcome
[1:06:58] [Music]
[1:07:00] to rule
[1:07:03] to have
[1:07:05] dominion
[1:07:08] amen
[1:07:10] over
[1:07:12] amen let's talk about
[1:07:16] this for just a minute
[1:07:18] the power
[1:07:20] to create
[1:07:21] right
[1:07:24] the power
[1:07:25] to create
[1:07:29] now we know that god is the only one
[1:07:32] that can create
[1:07:34] out of nothing
[1:07:37] but do you realize
[1:07:39] that
[1:07:41] man
[1:07:42] that has been reconciled to god
[1:07:46] the if you're
[1:07:47] uh adam you know we know that he
[1:07:49] couldn't he couldn't create any more it
[1:07:51] was all lost but christ the second man
[1:07:53] adam brought us back into a relationship
[1:07:55] with god now
[1:07:59] and i don't think ever i don't think
[1:08:01] ever that i know us
[1:08:04] even in brother-in-law's not about
[1:08:06] ministry but christ's ministry when he
[1:08:08] was here by the brand i mean brother
[1:08:09] bram said how did he
[1:08:11] and multiplied it
[1:08:14] right he multiplied it
[1:08:16] but in our age god seemed fit to take
[1:08:19] one of his sons
[1:08:21] in that right
[1:08:22] and give him the word of creation
[1:08:32] isn't that right
[1:08:35] give him the power
[1:08:37] to create
[1:08:39] how many knows where i am with your
[1:08:40] creators
[1:08:42] brother bands before i pick that back up
[1:08:44] i want to say this
[1:08:46] he says it this way did you ever see
[1:08:47] people that you just love to be around
[1:08:50] you just love to be around them because
[1:08:52] they create an atmosphere around them
[1:09:02] who was it brother
[1:09:04] ted when he was here ministering talked
[1:09:06] about and i read the same thing that's
[1:09:08] why i knew he was accurate
[1:09:10] but he talked about how that brother bam
[1:09:11] said he said we're coming to meetings
[1:09:13] sometimes and there would be such an
[1:09:15] atmosphere there such an expectation
[1:09:17] such an atmosphere that before brother
[1:09:18] brandon would ever come out amen that
[1:09:21] everybody would be healed already
[1:09:24] huh why because the people created that
[1:09:28] atmosphere they come believing they
[1:09:30] didn't worry about their their work
[1:09:32] yesterday they didn't care about whether
[1:09:35] the electric was on or what their bill
[1:09:36] was due they cared about getting a hold
[1:09:39] of god
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:43] what does it go to show you it doesn't
[1:09:45] matter about the preacher
[1:09:47] it don't matter if the preacher is here
[1:09:49] or not you have the power to create such
[1:09:52] an atmosphere
[1:09:59] i mean though sure we want power to do
[1:10:01] like the prophet god and speak squirrels
[1:10:03] into existence
[1:10:07] huh
[1:10:09] listen out there
[1:10:12] brother banham loved hunting
[1:10:14] he loved hunting squirrel
[1:10:16] and so god used a squirrel
[1:10:19] folks if it had been me it'd have
[1:10:21] probably been a big buck
[1:10:24] huh or it had been a 14 pound pass
[1:10:28] i'd sure like to have a 14 bomb as i
[1:10:31] have been wearing this lake out and all
[1:10:33] i've been catching is these 12 inches
[1:10:35] huh if it's me he opposite thomas just
[1:10:38] speak it
[1:10:41] and you'll have what you want
[1:10:43] huh
[1:10:45] praise be to god
[1:10:49] i'd say over there by that lily pad i'm
[1:10:51] gonna throw my lure right over there
[1:10:54] and guess what i'm just gonna put a hook
[1:10:56] on it nothing on the hook
[1:10:58] i want to make sure it's god
[1:11:00] i just throw that hook in there and i'm
[1:11:02] going to catch a 14 pound bass
[1:11:05] huh
[1:11:06] if god would have said it i wouldn't be
[1:11:08] afraid to say it if the unction wasn't
[1:11:10] here
[1:11:11] listen people i believe that we are
[1:11:13] supposed to be in the place of being
[1:11:15] able to speak these things
[1:11:16] because the god said that the whole
[1:11:18] world is groaning romans 8 says they're
[1:11:22] groaning for the manifestation of the
[1:11:24] sons of god
[1:11:26] the world is dying
[1:11:29] for the sons of god to be manifested and
[1:11:32] we ourselves are groaning
[1:11:34] folks i know you're groaning
[1:11:36] i watch this church and i know that oh
[1:11:38] it's so easy to just
[1:11:40] kind of slip backwards don't slip

[1:12:26] done something amen and god told the
[1:12:28] prophet he says you give that man what
[1:12:30] he wants
[1:12:31] that's what we need we need the holy
[1:12:33] spirit to tell us to speak don't just
[1:12:35] speak on your own you won't get nothing
[1:12:37] but if he says it
[1:12:40] you'll get what your hearts desire you
[1:12:42] can say i give it to you in the name of
[1:12:44] the lord
[1:12:45] we've had a manifestation of it we've
[1:12:47] had an example of it i got to thinking
[1:12:49] about folks i'm here to tell you this
[1:12:51] message shouldn't make us lukewarm and
[1:12:53] backsliding this message ought to make
[1:12:55] us look like jesus christ act like jesus
[1:12:57] christ
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:03] how many believes it
[1:13:07] what did jesus say about it
[1:13:09] let's see what jesus said about it
[1:13:13] jesus said
[1:13:22] i say unto you
[1:13:24] he that believeth on me
[1:13:26] the works that i do shall he do also
[1:13:32] you see where we need a good old altar

[1:13:39] love like he does have you got the power
[1:13:42] like he does do you look like your daddy
[1:13:46] do you act like your daddy
[1:13:51] huh
[1:13:52] because i am here to tell you
[1:13:55] and i believe the prophet said that
[1:13:56] means
[1:13:57] absolutely
[1:14:02] verily verily
[1:14:05] i say unto you
[1:14:07] and greater works
[1:14:09] than these shall he do
[1:14:11] because i go unto the father
[1:14:14] oh my here is what a son of god is to

[1:14:18] amen the great father had children
[1:14:21] this is what we're to look like
[1:14:24] verily verily i say unto you
[1:14:27] that whosoever what else whatsoever you

[1:14:39] holy ghost in there until he can say
[1:14:42] just say this
[1:14:44] just say that because the one thing that
[1:14:46] is son of god we as children of god we
[1:14:48] as amateur god we as amateur creator are
[1:14:51] not is independent we are not
[1:14:53] independent we are not on our own we are
[1:14:56] powered with god's power we are filled
[1:14:58] with his spirit he does these things to
[1:15:00] us it's not us doing it
[1:15:02] oh and i want you to brag about my
[1:15:04] father let me prank about my daddy a
[1:15:06] little bit a little scrawny man by the
[1:15:08] name of david he was a nobody but yet he
[1:15:10] killed a lion and a bear and he killed
[1:15:12] that goliath and afterwards everybody
[1:15:14] was like david you are such a great man
[1:15:16] you are such an awesome man he said no
[1:15:18] it's not me he's the one that's awesome
[1:15:28] it makes you look awesome but it's not
[1:15:30] you that's awesome it's him that's
[1:15:32] awesome because he surrendered to him
[1:15:34] what we need is people completely
[1:15:36] surrendered to god
[1:15:41] so that god can use you
[1:15:48] how many believes that
[1:16:03] the goal
[1:16:05] of a father
[1:16:07] the goal
[1:16:09] of a mother
[1:16:11] the goal
[1:16:13] that they have
[1:16:14] is what
[1:16:17] let's leave what their goal is
[1:16:24] herein is set forth the love of god page
[1:16:26] 355 to church facebook
[1:16:29] hearing it set forth the love of god
[1:16:32] he desired in love
[1:16:34] a family
[1:16:36] of his own
[1:16:38] hey amen
[1:16:41] i knew i was talking to but
[1:16:44] before i got married
[1:16:46] before i thought about getting married i
[1:16:48] wasn't ready to get married i didn't
[1:16:49] want to get married i didn't want
[1:16:49] nothing to do with marriage
[1:16:51] but one day
[1:16:54] that all changed
[1:16:56] and that right
[1:16:58] it changed and i said
[1:17:00] i don't want to be by myself no more
[1:17:02] i want to share my life with somebody
[1:17:04] right
[1:17:06] how many knows that's the way god feels
[1:17:07] he don't want to be alone
[1:17:09] he wants to be with somebody
[1:17:11] he wants to have a family
[1:17:13] got married
[1:17:14] oh my this is awesome it's beautiful
[1:17:18] satisfying fulfilling
[1:17:20] just have a companion
[1:17:22] know what love's all really all about
[1:17:24] it's just awesome
[1:17:26] but after about two years go by
[1:17:30] something else hit me
[1:17:32] something else let me see i'd like to
[1:17:34] have
[1:17:34] a son i'd like to have
[1:17:36] children
[1:17:38] huh
[1:17:39] right this is a desire i would like to
[1:17:40] have children
[1:17:41] it must be kind of how god feels right
[1:17:44] it's by himself
[1:17:46] but he wants children
[1:17:51] amen
[1:17:53] notice he desired a family of his own
[1:17:57] a family of sons and daughters sons like
[1:18:00] himself
[1:18:03] amen
[1:18:04] and before him lies all mankind has one
[1:18:07] lump of clay and out of that same lump
[1:18:08] of clay he will now make vessels of
[1:18:10] honor and dishonor the choosing will be
[1:18:12] his own choosing and those chosen ones
[1:18:15] born of his spirit will be trained
[1:18:19] huh
[1:18:21] how many believe that before we're ready
[1:18:23] to speak things before we can even get
[1:18:25] to the place of adoption and speaking
[1:18:27] things
[1:18:28] we have to have
[1:18:30] some fatherly care
[1:18:35] oh yeah
[1:18:37] fatherly cares what we have to have
[1:18:42] then those chosen ones
[1:18:44] born of a spirit trained to conform to
[1:18:46] the image in their walk
[1:18:51] huh
[1:18:52] you know i take that walk
[1:18:54] what that walk means to me i don't know
[1:18:56] what that walk means to you
[1:18:59] but that's a steady forward motion
[1:19:02] another not just a sunday or wednesday
[1:19:04] christian no but you're
[1:19:06] every day
[1:19:08] walking with god
[1:19:11] that's what i see that walking is
[1:19:12] meaning something you do
[1:19:14] every single
[1:19:17] day
[1:19:18] it don't change when you go out those
[1:19:19] doors
[1:19:21] no that's where it starts
[1:19:24] that's where you put into practice what
[1:19:26] you've been here listening to
[1:19:30] that's right in their walk he reproves
[1:19:34] with all long-suffering and gentleness
[1:19:37] and mercy amen
[1:19:39] he chases
[1:19:41] with nail scar hands
[1:19:44] sometimes his potter must take this
[1:19:46] vessel that he is working on
[1:19:49] and thoroughly break it
[1:19:52] down
[1:19:54] oh my
[1:19:56] i don't know any christians but that has
[1:19:58] that time in their life
[1:20:00] i did we did brother joe
[1:20:03] but john all of us we've all had that
[1:20:05] time
[1:20:05] where god has to break
[1:20:07] you
[1:20:09] down
[1:20:10] he had to break brother branham down
[1:20:13] brother branham was he was out and
[1:20:16] praying for the sick and walking the
[1:20:17] power lines and baptizing people and
[1:20:19] preaching the gospel like you ain't
[1:20:21] never seen
[1:20:22] isn't that right
[1:20:23] but yet he lacked when it came to
[1:20:25] obeying what god said when those people
[1:20:28] in mishawsha indiana said come and
[1:20:30] preach here come and preach god opened
[1:20:32] the door wide open and he refused to go
[1:20:34] through it because of his mother-in-law
[1:20:36] and god had to teach him a real lesson
[1:20:39] took his wife and baby
[1:20:42] was that a terrible thing yes that was a
[1:20:44] terrible thing and yet it was the best
[1:20:46] thing god could do
[1:20:49] because how many knows where they are
[1:20:51] now are they in a much better place
[1:20:54] much much better place
[1:20:58] amen
[1:21:00] that's right
[1:21:02] yet
[1:21:02] god had to teach him he had to break him
[1:21:04] down so much until the devil tempted him
[1:21:07] to
[1:21:08] say i'm god's going to be that way i'm
[1:21:10] not going to serve him
[1:21:11] i don't know if i can go on amen huh
[1:21:14] he has to thoroughly break that vessel
[1:21:16] down that he's working on that he may
[1:21:18] rebuild it exactly how he desires it
[1:21:23] oh listen church listening evening light
[1:21:25] tabernacle that's god's desire that's
[1:21:28] what he wants to do in your life
[1:21:33] he's come into your life to rebuild you
[1:21:38] to the way that you're supposed to
[1:21:40] be god have mercy on me
[1:21:44] huh because i know i need some
[1:21:46] rebuilding i'm sure you do too
[1:21:48] i'm making look at your life
[1:21:50] but this week i was thinking because
[1:21:52] i'll tell you right now most people
[1:21:54] don't never take a good look at
[1:21:56] themselves
[1:21:58] i know we're supposed to look to christ
[1:21:59] but sometimes you need to take a real
[1:22:01] good look at yourself and see what kind
[1:22:04] of person you really are
[1:22:06] and i guarantee you this most of the
[1:22:08] time it'll send you to your knees and
[1:22:10] saying god i don't want to be like that
[1:22:14] huh
[1:22:17] don't just ignore it
[1:22:19] well that's just how i am that's
[1:22:22] blindness uh if it's not the way that
[1:22:25] god wants you to be
[1:22:28] you're not allowing god to work on you
[1:22:31] if you're a son of god remember this
[1:22:33] you're gonna get worked on
[1:22:35] how many believes that you're gonna get
[1:22:38] worked on
[1:22:40] [Music]
[1:22:43] that's the bible have you forgotten
[1:22:45] hebrews 12 and five have you forgotten
[1:22:48] the exhortation which speaketh unto us
[1:22:50] on two children my son despise not now
[1:22:54] the chastening of the lord nor faith
[1:22:57] when thou art rebuked of him
[1:23:01] huh
[1:23:02] boy sometimes the lord would be so hard
[1:23:04] till we just feel like quitting just
[1:23:06] quitting
[1:23:08] huh
[1:23:09] christianity it's not supposed to be
[1:23:10] this hard
[1:23:12] huh
[1:23:13] yeah we'll find out what you're made of
[1:23:16] don't faint
[1:23:17] be patient
[1:23:18] [Applause]
[1:23:19] oh my those weapons how many of those
[1:23:22] weapons our children didn't get the
[1:23:24] weapons the reason why god renegades the
[1:23:26] reason this generation as the prophet of
[1:23:28] god has gone completely insane is
[1:23:31] because a lack of discipline a lack of
[1:23:33] parent teaching
[1:23:35] am i right
[1:23:37] too many one two three four fives
[1:23:45] usually what you know what you know what
[1:23:47] you should say the second time
[1:23:49] that ought to get him going
[1:23:52] you ready for this
[1:23:55] what did i tell you
[1:23:58] [Laughter]
[1:24:02] that's that you said i know what that
[1:24:03] means
[1:24:04] right
[1:24:06] because if i kind of tell you what did i
[1:24:08] tell you they know the next thing is i'm
[1:24:10] not telling you and again
[1:24:12] i'll make you happy to do it
[1:24:14] folks how many know we need to be taught
[1:24:16] to need to be taught obedience
[1:24:19] oh my
[1:24:21] anyway i didn't mean to go down that
[1:24:22] road but still it has to do with
[1:24:24] parenting right
[1:24:25] the outcome let me tell you something
[1:24:27] the most satisfying the most wonderful
[1:24:30] thing that a pair can have is to have
[1:24:32] his children loving the lord
[1:24:36] serving god doing the right thing
[1:24:39] that's the most rewarding thing that a
[1:24:42] parent can have
[1:24:44] oh my that's your goal that's your
[1:24:46] ambition that's god's goal that's his
[1:24:48] goal for you that's his goal for me
[1:24:51] be to the place to where christ reflects
[1:24:54] so much until when he says say that you
[1:24:57] can say it
[1:24:58] and it's there
[1:25:00] because it wasn't just for brother
[1:25:01] branham it was for you and me too
[1:25:04] he's not the only son of god
[1:25:06] can i say something
[1:25:09] thank you brother joe
[1:25:11] think about how did god use the prophet
[1:25:13] of god so much he was so much in his
[1:25:16] image he looked back but so much like
[1:25:18] jesus there was a group of people that
[1:25:21] even to this day in this message think
[1:25:23] that he was jesus christ
[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:25:27] brother almost had to go off the field
[1:25:29] and say don't you say that about me it
[1:25:30] makes me antichrist
[1:25:33] but he looks so much like christ he
[1:25:35] could discern the thoughts and tense of
[1:25:36] the heart like jesus did
[1:25:38] folks not so long ago
[1:25:40] i was close to some of those people that
[1:25:42] kind of leaned that way
[1:25:44] and i heard them at the dinner table say
[1:25:45] well brother branham healed this person
[1:25:48] when brother branham healed that person
[1:25:50] and i knew how they lean
[1:25:52] i was like brother bantam didn't heal
[1:25:54] nobody
[1:25:55] if brother brandon was here he says i
[1:25:57] can't heal nobody
[1:25:58] you can't heal nobody
[1:26:01] it was jesus that healed them
[1:26:04] they want to so healer is in town he's
[1:26:05] not the healer christ is the healer
[1:26:09] but it's still a compliment because they
[1:26:11] said the same thing about john the
[1:26:12] baptist heart now the christ or do we
[1:26:15] look for another what is it you know
[1:26:17] because i am not i'm not worthy it's
[1:26:19] time to shunt i shoot right
[1:26:23] but so much
[1:26:25] in this image
[1:26:26] till some
[1:26:28] went off the deep end
[1:26:30] and we're wrong
[1:26:32] hello and i fear for those people
[1:26:35] can't believe something like that
[1:26:38] and be okay with god
[1:26:40] no no no no no
[1:26:44] let me tell you better repent anybody
[1:26:45] would be listening there you lean that
[1:26:47] way your chance of heaven slim
[1:26:51] god's not going to have you worshiping a
[1:26:52] man or an idol
[1:26:54] and have you some other god other than
[1:26:56] him
[1:26:57] huh
[1:26:59] what was it i heard some kind of a
[1:27:02] was it my wife said it i guess facebook
[1:27:04] or whatever there was a little saying
[1:27:05] that says you know people expect to live
[1:27:08] in the mansion over there with him but
[1:27:10] they won't come to his house down here
[1:27:15] hello you can't come to his house and
[1:27:18] you want to live in a mansion with him
[1:27:19] over there i thought may that happen up
[1:27:26] there's something i've been wanting to
[1:27:27] ask each and every one of you
[1:27:30] i want to ask you a question
[1:27:33] how much
[1:27:34] do you love jesus
[1:27:38] how much
[1:27:39] do you love jesus
[1:27:41] because remember it's not just about
[1:27:43] coming to church and paying your tithe
[1:27:45] and being loyal
[1:27:46] it's about how much you love jesus
[1:27:49] because that's what causes you to do all
[1:27:51] those things right
[1:27:53] however much you love jesus is how much
[1:27:55] you adhere to him
[1:27:57] it's your walk everything about it
[1:28:00] senders around
[1:28:01] your love
[1:28:03] for him
[1:28:05] and it shows in every one of us isn't
[1:28:06] that right
[1:28:09] amen if you love the lord you can't wait
[1:28:12] for them doors to open
[1:28:14] amen you can't wait to hear another
[1:28:16] sermon you can't wait to say amen let me
[1:28:19] tell you something we're in trouble when
[1:28:21] the amends die down when the hallelujahs
[1:28:24] die down when the church gets cold and
[1:28:27] stiff and starchy
[1:28:31] folks let me just go back a little bit
[1:28:33] and talk about creating an atmosphere
[1:28:35] amen if we could come to church amen
[1:28:37] with our spirits ready
[1:28:39] but that atmosphere don't start in
[1:28:41] church
[1:28:42] that atmosphere starts right at home
[1:28:46] it starts with your spouse it starts
[1:28:48] with your wife or your husband the
[1:28:50] atmosphere that you have with each other
[1:28:53] and that you have with your children and
[1:28:55] atmosphere with your prayer life so that
[1:28:57] when you walk in those doors you bring
[1:28:59] that atmosphere with you
[1:29:01] [Music]
[1:29:03] do you sit there with that attitude
[1:29:06] you're going to be a damp wit rag
[1:29:09] is that right we come
[1:29:10] with an atmosphere about us
[1:29:13] folks i want i want people when they get
[1:29:14] around me to not feel thomas byla

[1:29:48] the power to create
[1:29:50] each and every one of us
[1:29:52] power to pull god down

[1:30:21] let's talk about
[1:30:23] sons of god
[1:30:25] and how that we're so proud of our daddy
[1:30:28] aren't you glad aren't you proud of your
[1:30:30] papa
[1:30:32] let me tell you about my daddy
[1:30:34] you know what children are always doing
[1:30:36] my dad is and my dad died now the girls
[1:30:39] they'll say my mom this and my mom that
[1:30:41] they look up to mom she said ride their
[1:30:42] idol
[1:30:44] right
[1:30:45] well that's the way it is in the kingdom
[1:30:46] of god let me tell you about my daddy
[1:30:49] amen my father which is in heaven
[1:30:52] but
[1:30:55] the children of israel hungry he fed up
[1:30:59] he raided birds out of the heavens and
[1:31:01] fed them until their bellies were full
[1:31:03] they said and said praise be to god
[1:31:06] but them kids got to complain and while
[1:31:09] their
[1:31:10] toothpick was in their mouth picking the
[1:31:12] meat out
[1:31:13] well i tell you what there's no water
[1:31:15] around here
[1:31:17] there's no drink
[1:31:18] moses why didn't you bring us out here
[1:31:20] so that we would die here isn't there
[1:31:21] enough graves in egypt
[1:31:23] do you see why god wanted to just kill
[1:31:24] them all right out but to go off go get
[1:31:27] he wouldn't have done it if they
[1:31:28] wouldn't have deserved it but moses was
[1:31:31] like christ and he stood in the bridge
[1:31:32] in there right
[1:31:34] which isn't it sad
[1:31:36] let me tell you isn't it sad brother joe
[1:31:38] isn't it sad brother john to think that
[1:31:40] those 2 million
[1:31:41] all of those people are not going to be
[1:31:43] in heaven
[1:31:47] they're not going to be in heaven
[1:31:49] isn't that exactly what the prophet
[1:31:51] confirmed what jesus said yes and
[1:31:53] they're everyone dead but says that
[1:31:56] meant totally separated from god
[1:32:00] when jesus himself said yes and there
[1:32:01] everyone dead
[1:32:03] dad we had five we minor in the
[1:32:04] wilderness and we had this out of the
[1:32:06] other yeah but jesus said they're
[1:32:07] everyone dead
[1:32:09] with lazarus he said he's it
[1:32:12] huh
[1:32:13] that's right so even that that's sad
[1:32:16] only two that made it
[1:32:18] out of the original bunch now let me
[1:32:19] clarify this
[1:32:21] because what people don't understand
[1:32:23] is the children that didn't know any
[1:32:25] better they were the ones that went in
[1:32:28] joshua and caleb and the children went
[1:32:30] in but not those parents
[1:32:32] not mom and daddy not them old fighters
[1:32:35] always fighting fighting fighting
[1:32:37] fighting
[1:32:38] they didn't go in
[1:32:41] amen
[1:32:43] all right
[1:32:44] all right praise the lord so where we're
[1:32:46] at
[1:32:48] oh my
[1:32:51] what about
[1:32:52] oh thank you think about this but listen
[1:32:54] folks lord's really good this morning
[1:32:58] when we think about david
[1:33:00] when we think about david and how that
[1:33:02] god was pleased with him right
[1:33:05] god he was a man after god's own heart
[1:33:09] and god laid it on his heart to go after
[1:33:12] the goliath and all of these people
[1:33:15] all of his brothers thought boy he's
[1:33:16] going to get killed that ain't no good
[1:33:18] right
[1:33:19] but god had confidence he had he loved
[1:33:21] david
[1:33:22] and he gave him a mighty victory he
[1:33:24] brought goliath down for him
[1:33:27] now i want to say something else that is
[1:33:30] like the three hebrew children listen to
[1:33:32] this
[1:33:33] the three hebrew children were going to
[1:33:35] serve god
[1:33:38] even if it meant death
[1:33:41] let me say this way if i can it wasn't
[1:33:43] so important that the three hebrew
[1:33:45] children lived
[1:33:48] that wasn't what was important
[1:33:51] or died
[1:33:52] the important part was is that they
[1:33:55] trusted their daddy
[1:33:57] they trusted god whether they would live
[1:34:00] or whether they would die it was all
[1:34:02] fine by them
[1:34:05] i believe that's the way it is even the
[1:34:07] prophet made the statement live or die
[1:34:08] sink or swim where faith is in him
[1:34:12] i believe that's a real big step in
[1:34:14] being a mature son of god that it's not
[1:34:16] about whether he live or whether you die
[1:34:18] it's about whether in death or life
[1:34:20] whichever way it goes
[1:34:22] huh just like my wife caleb when he was
[1:34:25] born god we don't know if he's going to
[1:34:27] live so i'm giving it to him i'm giving
[1:34:29] him to you if you want to take him take
[1:34:31] him
[1:34:34] that's the way we got to feel about
[1:34:35] ourself god if you're going to let me
[1:34:37] die if you want me to die i will die but
[1:34:39] i'm going to die trusting you
[1:34:42] huh
[1:34:43] our faith is completely in god our trust
[1:34:46] and our hope is completely in father god
[1:34:49] am i right
[1:34:51] remember this is the kind of faith jesus
[1:34:53] asked us to have what so every things
[1:34:55] you ask you shall receive brother
[1:34:57] branham when he was so sick isn't that
[1:34:59] right brother brandon was so sick in his
[1:35:00] stomach
[1:35:03] he kept being sick and sick and sick the
[1:35:04] doctor says if you eat one big solid
[1:35:07] chunk of food you gonna die
[1:35:10] and he got around the table now i'm not
[1:35:12] sure brotherhead probably knows but what
[1:35:13] kind of food they were eating but hand
[1:35:15] me them taters hand me this beans hey
[1:35:17] hand me that stuff
[1:35:20] he
[1:35:21] i sing on it and he says by his stripes
[1:35:24] i am healed
[1:35:26] his mama he says i'm gonna eat it mama
[1:35:28] mama said don't you eat it son don't you
[1:35:30] eat it you're gonna die i want you
[1:35:31] around
[1:35:35] live or die
[1:35:36] i trust him
[1:35:38] he ate them
[1:35:40] right mama crying
[1:35:42] mama crying
[1:35:44] maybe she didn't have faith like he did
[1:35:47] but liver died he was eating them he was
[1:35:49] trusting the lord
[1:35:51] he was believing the lord
[1:35:53] and then right he spit it back up oh
[1:35:57] the image i got he would spit it up in
[1:35:59] his hand oh
[1:36:02] you're gonna stay down
[1:36:05] huh
[1:36:07] right by his throat i'm healed
[1:36:11] by his throat
[1:36:12] i'm healed
[1:36:15] and what happens
[1:36:17] he got healed
[1:36:19] god honored he says that's my boy
[1:36:22] when those three hebrew children went up
[1:36:24] into the fire father god was proud he
[1:36:27] says that's my son
[1:36:29] that's my children
[1:36:31] that's what i'm looking for
[1:36:33] live or die
[1:36:35] i will serve him
[1:36:37] what does it matter
[1:36:38] if you die you go to a better place
[1:36:40] anyway
[1:36:42] you want to make sure you're just right
[1:36:43] with god right
[1:36:46] oh my
[1:36:48] how maybe we have room for growth
[1:36:50] we need to grow
[1:36:53] amen
[1:36:55] that he may rebuild
[1:36:57] it exactly as he desires
[1:36:59] but it is love
[1:37:01] that is his love another way of love
[1:37:05] there is not
[1:37:07] how many knows we human beings we as
[1:37:09] christians me as a pastor of 30 years we
[1:37:12] still need chastening
[1:37:14] we still need rebuke we still need
[1:37:16] direction we still need correction
[1:37:19] because it won't be till tuesday or
[1:37:20] something or that and i'll probably miss
[1:37:22] my morning well i hardly ever miss that
[1:37:24] but maybe my noon prayer or thinking
[1:37:27] about him as much as i should hello
[1:37:29] we are so prone to backsliding
[1:37:33] we're so prone
[1:37:34] to getting away from god
[1:37:38] listen to you people that wanted to
[1:37:40] renew the joy of your salvation
[1:37:43] somewhere you've lost joy
[1:37:45] think back where you what you did
[1:37:48] did you neglect prayer meeting did you
[1:37:50] neglect reading your bible neglect
[1:37:53] praying at your home asking the
[1:37:56] blessing at the table
[1:37:58] huh
[1:37:59] oh my it's so unbecoming of christians
[1:38:01] no matter where you are by your head and
[1:38:04] pray
[1:38:04] i'm sure every one of us have been
[1:38:06] restaurants and well do i want to bomb
[1:38:07] my head what do you want to do none of
[1:38:09] us no doubt are ashamed of that right i
[1:38:11] don't care if the worst atheists die or
[1:38:12] whatever i wouldn't care if they throw
[1:38:14] me out
[1:38:16] amen
[1:38:17] i'll be respectful for them
[1:38:19] not make them hear my prayer maybe i
[1:38:21] have a silent prayer unless i'm in the
[1:38:23] group
[1:38:24] i don't just get up there and say god
[1:38:26] bless this food now
[1:38:29] some of them might need that but anyway
[1:38:32] listen to this let's go on and if ever
[1:38:34] listen wherever you left that joy
[1:38:36] whatever weeded it out whatever little
[1:38:39] bitterness come in nobody knows
[1:38:43] you got to go back to that place and say
[1:38:45] this is where i lost my joy this is why
[1:38:47] i lost my faith in god
[1:38:50] lord help me to repent
[1:38:53] oh my this is where he says
[1:38:55] you know that when you get saved the
[1:38:57] holy spirit comes in there that eternal
[1:38:59] life and as you're able to push out all
[1:39:01] the roots of bitterness then god begins
[1:39:04] to spread in you
[1:39:06] then you become a son
[1:39:09] and daughter of god
[1:39:11] amen
[1:39:13] praise the lord
[1:39:20] we cannot be reliant upon ourselves
[1:39:23] we have to rely on him
[1:39:25] it's time to get back to sons and
[1:39:27] daughters of god
[1:39:31] back
[1:39:32] to where jesus said
[1:39:35] if you ask anything in my name
[1:39:38] i will do it
[1:39:41] did he say you will do it
[1:39:43] no he said you will ask
[1:39:45] and i will do it
[1:39:47] well we get where we miss demarcus we
[1:39:49] ask and we think we're gonna do it no
[1:39:50] you're not you're gonna ask ask and you
[1:39:53] shall receive
[1:39:54] not and it shall be opened unto you
[1:39:57] amen
[1:39:59] when i see how god was in our prophet i
[1:40:03] see how he was
[1:40:05] when i read this message and i study
[1:40:06] this message
[1:40:08] i realize brothers and sisters that it's
[1:40:10] not just about what was in him but it's
[1:40:12] what's in you
[1:40:13] what's in me
[1:40:15] and i don't know about you but i'll say
[1:40:17] lord
[1:40:19] i want to get to that place to where i
[1:40:21] speak
[1:40:22] just
[1:40:23] let the holy spirit come
[1:40:25] let him tell me to say something
[1:40:27] and say it
[1:40:29] let it happen
[1:40:30] let me tell you something how many
[1:40:31] believes that that can happen for any
[1:40:33] sister in this church
[1:40:35] any young people in this church it can
[1:40:37] happen to you god can do it through you
[1:40:41] if you'll surrender completely to god
[1:40:44] and be pleasing to him how many believes
[1:40:45] but he's gotta he's gotta work on us a
[1:40:47] lot of time before we get to that place
[1:40:49] brother branham had to be worked on very
[1:40:51] hard before he got to that place
[1:40:54] amen had he right how many members had
[1:40:56] he write the same way
[1:40:58] god said tell her
[1:40:59] ask her what she wants and give it to
[1:41:01] her
[1:41:02] amen speak
[1:41:05] the word
[1:41:06] and it'll be so whatsoever you ask
[1:41:10] it'll be done
[1:41:12] so
[1:41:12] search your heart this morning
[1:41:14] ask yourself
[1:41:16] where are you as a daughter of god
[1:41:21] where are you as a son of god
[1:41:25] where are you in your character
[1:41:28] where are you in your atmosphere where
[1:41:30] are we as where are we at this morning
[1:41:31] evening tabernacle in atmosphere what do
[1:41:34] we bring to church with us
[1:41:37] do we bring our cares our worries our
[1:41:40] frets
[1:41:41] or do we bring the atmosphere of peace
[1:41:44] and the holy spirit
[1:41:46] so that god can move
[1:41:48] on the scene because how many knows
[1:41:49] brother troy we have dire situations
[1:41:52] we have things that we absolutely need
[1:41:54] miracles for
[1:41:56] amen i believe he's a miracle-working
[1:41:58] god i believe the same yesterday today
[1:42:01] and forever
[1:42:04] i think my wife pointed out to me a
[1:42:06] quote where he talks about you know god
[1:42:07] did
[1:42:09] everything he could do
[1:42:10] brother man says i've done everything i
[1:42:12] can do now it's up to you
[1:42:15] whether you accept that or not whether
[1:42:18] you receive it or not it's completely up
[1:42:20] to you
[1:42:21] because everything else has been done
[1:42:23] i mean as god has showed us the example
[1:42:26] i truly believe he's shown us an example
[1:42:28] of what a son of god is like
[1:42:31] through the prophet in his generation
[1:42:33] and of course his son jesus christ
[1:42:35] himself but in our generation christ was
[1:42:38] in him i don't know that was christ
[1:42:41] not the brother adam brother ram could
[1:42:42] heal he couldn't tell you where he was
[1:42:44] from he wouldn't know the first thing
[1:42:46] about you
[1:42:48] unless the holy spirit come
[1:42:50] unless jesus came because he's still the
[1:42:53] holy spirit is the designer of the
[1:42:54] thoughts and intents of the heart not a
[1:42:56] man
[1:43:02] amen i want to be more like him oh i
[1:43:04] want to be like him i want to be like
[1:43:08] him don't you want to be like him
[1:43:12] stand with me this morning
[1:43:18] praise the lord
[1:43:21] with our heads bowed
[1:43:28] eyes closed don't think about anything
[1:43:31] else right now
[1:43:32] except where you're at
[1:43:35] with the lord
[1:43:37] where are you at with the lord
[1:43:39] are you in love with him do you love him
[1:43:42] as much as what you should
[1:43:45] are you close to him
[1:43:52] close
[1:43:58] remember romans 8 i didn't get to it
[1:44:01] but he predestinated us to be conformed
[1:44:05] to the image
[1:44:07] of his son
[1:44:09] that's what we've been predestinated to
[1:44:11] be
[1:44:12] and when you ask
[1:44:14] to be that remember
[1:44:15] that's his desire also you can't ask a
[1:44:18] miss
[1:44:19] on that
[1:44:20] because that's god's desire that is
[1:44:23] to be like him
[1:44:25] to be in his image
[1:44:27] the works that he did
[1:44:29] you do also
[1:44:32] how many would say i'm not where i
[1:44:34] should be
[1:44:37] i confess i'm not where i should be
[1:44:39] should be
[1:44:40] i don't know if you're backslid i don't
[1:44:41] know where you're at but you know where
[1:44:43] you're at
[1:44:45] say god i'm not where ought to be this
[1:44:47] morning my hand is up lord we all need
[1:44:49] to grow
[1:44:50] we all need to come closer to you lord
[1:44:54] we want to see the reflection of christ
[1:44:56] in our lives above anything above any
[1:44:59] riches above any worldly possessions
[1:45:02] no none of those things matter to us
[1:45:03] what matters to us that christ
[1:45:06] is reflected
[1:45:08] in our hearts our lives our atmosphere
[1:45:11] our words
[1:45:14] our actions towards one another
[1:45:17] in everything god we want
[1:45:19] your reflection
[1:45:21] to be in our hearts and our lives
[1:45:24] lord you see every hand
[1:45:26] lord and i knew i knew when i read this
[1:45:28] and seen this
[1:45:29] i still see lord jesus where i
[1:45:31] definitely need
[1:45:33] a change of reflection i need to change
[1:45:36] i need to
[1:45:37] lord let you have greater
[1:45:39] power in my life lord surrender more to
[1:45:42] you than what i have lord and i ask god
[1:45:44] this morning you'll see every hand and
[1:45:46] every sin
[1:45:47] every failure now
[1:45:49] will drop in the blood of jesus christ
[1:45:52] because they raise their hands in
[1:45:53] confession of their faults and their
[1:45:55] failures
[1:45:56] and saying god i come here to see where
[1:45:59] i can become better lord to find my bad
[1:46:02] places
[1:46:03] and to let you the holy spirit come into
[1:46:05] my life in a greater way
[1:46:08] never to look at somebody else and
[1:46:09] expect it out of them but to expect it
[1:46:11] out of our self lord out of me
[1:46:15] the husband
[1:46:16] the father of my house that's where the
[1:46:18] responsibility lays
[1:46:20] and i asked this morning that you would
[1:46:21] take every father this morning
[1:46:24] and help them surrender completely to
[1:46:26] you so that they could be the same kind
[1:46:27] of daddy that you are to them lord
[1:46:31] we thank you lord jesus so much this
[1:46:33] morning to have a heavenly father like
[1:46:35] you
[1:46:37] so we say this morning heavenly father i
[1:46:39] appreciate you heavenly father i
[1:46:41] appreciate you i love you i adore you i
[1:46:43] bow down before you lord heavenly father
[1:46:47] we appreciate you

[1:46:50] heart every life and help us to have an
[1:46:53] unwavering faith in you lord
[1:46:56] live or die our faith is in you god
[1:46:59] that you're more than able to meet the
[1:47:01] needs the things that we have to desire
[1:47:03] for no things that we need lord
[1:47:05] now we can speak the word lord jesus if
[1:47:07] you'll just anoint us and we know that
[1:47:09] it'll be even if it's a moving of a
[1:47:12] mountain because your word has said
[1:47:13] nothing shall be impossible unto you
[1:47:16] lord and we believe that the sons of god
[1:47:18] are in that position
[1:47:20] that nothing is impossible for him we
[1:47:22] ask god that you're blessed
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:25] lord jesus bless each one that has a
[1:47:27] need right now lord
[1:47:30] lord down in that heart they know what
[1:47:32] that need is lord and we ask god that
[1:47:34] you'll meet that need we believe that
[1:47:35] you will
