[26:48] a couple of places if you want to turn
[26:50] to Matthew uh we're going to start there
[26:53] with Matthew uh
[26:56] 26 and we'll read one verse there then
[26:59] I'm going to read out of um Hebrews 12
[27:03] also then we'll be seated hope
[27:05] everyone's doing
[27:08] well amen it's good to see y'all got
[27:12] good good looking bunch of people here
[27:13] brother
[27:14] Thomas amen Matthew 26 and verse 39 this
[27:19] is Jesus in Gethsemane he went a little
[27:22] further and fell on his face and prayed
[27:25] saying oh my father if it be possible
[27:29] let this cup pass from me
[27:33] nevertheless NE as I will b as thou Wilt
[27:37] tonight I want to speak on the word
[27:39] think of on this word
[27:41] nevertheless if you want to turn to
[27:43] Hebrews
[27:44] 12 going to read verse two
[27:49] there it says looking unto Jesus the
[27:52] author and finisher of our faith who for
[27:54] the joy that was set before him endured
[27:56] the cross despite the shame sat down at
[27:59] the right hand of the Throne of God you
[28:02] may be seated
[28:07] tonight all right praise the
[28:13] Lord nevertheless Jesus was in
[28:17] Gethsemane am
[28:20] I
[28:26] okay
[28:29] up a little
[28:33] bit
[28:39] okay okay so Jesus in Gethsemane he did
[28:43] not want to go through what he had to go
[28:45] through he was begging he was praying he
[28:47] said oh don't let me have to go through
[28:48] this but then it come to the point when
[28:50] and he he you know he took him a while
[28:52] because he went and prayed he came back
[28:53] to the disciples and they were they were
[28:56] sleeping he went back and prayed pray
[28:57] came back to the disciples again the
[28:58] third time he finally got to the point
[29:00] he said okay I'm good now I'm ready to
[29:03] go but it took him a while cuz Jesus had
[29:05] to overcome himself there in Gethsemane
[29:07] and he got to the point he said
[29:09] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[29:11] done brother and sister that is what we
[29:13] must come to in our walk and then you
[29:16] see you say well why did he do that what
[29:19] was it what was the faith that kept him
[29:20] going we see it there in Hebrews 122 it
[29:23] says for the joy that was set before him
[29:25] that was why he had the faith to keep
[29:27] going because he knew that the the end
[29:29] result was going to be amazing all right
[29:32] but you had to go through the bitterness
[29:33] first so we want to turn over here to
[29:36] Revelation 10 we're going to read a
[29:37] little bit here in Revelations 10
[29:40] and8 and it says and the voice which I
[29:44] heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[29:45] and said go take the little book which
[29:47] is open in the hand of the Angel which
[29:49] stand upon the sea and upon the earth
[29:51] now we know that this is a type of John
[29:55] the John is the type of the Bride at
[29:57] this
[29:58] point and it says right before that in
[30:00] the days has it's the message of the
[30:02] hour and we have heard that and as soon
[30:04] as we hear that then the voice says to
[30:06] you now you need to go take that open
[30:08] book and what are you supposed to do
[30:10] you're supposed to eat
[30:12] it this is something to be eaten this is
[30:14] what your soul lives on it's not
[30:16] something to be to be debated not
[30:18] something to argue about it's not a set
[30:20] of rules to follow so many times people
[30:23] man I like this up here so many times
[30:25] people they you know they think well the
[30:27] message just following all the rules and
[30:28] living a holy life and believeing all
[30:30] the right kind of doctrin brother and
[30:32] sister when you eat the book that book
[30:33] gets inside of you and it changes you
[30:36] and you become something that you were
[30:37] not before because you are what you
[30:41] eat and you can tell a person what
[30:44] they're feeding on by what comes out of
[30:45] their life and if you're feeding on the
[30:47] word the word comes out of your life if
[30:49] you're feeding on carrots carrots comes
[30:51] out of your life if you're feeding on
[30:52] the world the world comes out of your
[30:54] life but if you want to know whether or
[30:55] not you're feeding on Christ see what
[30:57] kind of life you're living and I'm not
[30:58] talking about whether or not you're
[31:00] living a holy life because that just
[31:02] comes with it but brother and sister The
[31:04] Life of Christ is the word for you for
[31:06] this day manifesting Christ through you
[31:09] and that's something that you might be
[31:10] the only person who's recognizing it but
[31:12] you see that there's something different
[31:14] about you and you keep growing little by
[31:16] little because it just you you know this
[31:18] I'm not but it says it says it's going
[31:20] to be honey in your mouth but afterwards
[31:22] it's going to make you bitter and that's
[31:25] exactly what we're doing when you come
[31:26] into it atmosphere like this this is
[31:28] honey Honey's just drooling all over the
[31:30] place this is a wonderful atmosphere
[31:33] it's just great you know and anyone
[31:34] wants to come to church when it's like
[31:36] this and everyone just worshiping and
[31:37] praising and God is so real his presence
[31:40] so real but as soon as you hit that door
[31:42] what does it say he said it was in my
[31:45] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[31:47] had eaten it my belly was bitter right
[31:50] away you hit the door and right away
[31:54] there's and sometime it come from your
[31:56] brother and S sister
[31:58] going right sat knows how to use this to
[32:01] tr of drag each other down it's a sad
[32:03] thing but brother and sister we're
[32:04] getting know that
[32:06] too amen we're starting to learn that
[32:08] you know that person sitting right there
[32:10] is actually Christ and how I treat her
[32:12] is how I treat Christ think about that
[32:15] the next time you want to sass
[32:18] somebody you what happened to Sister me
[32:20] when she sass the
[32:22] prophet God didn't like it he said well
[32:25] we're not prophets you're still a part
[32:27] of the body of Christ how some respect
[32:30] for each other amen amen got off my
[32:34] subject all right so soon as you hit the
[32:37] door there's bitterness right this the
[32:41] loss everything we go through and why do
[32:43] we go through it be because we know that
[32:45] there's a joy set before us that if we
[32:47] take our cross daily and die to oursel
[32:49] daily there's a reward that's coming
[32:51] down the road if we will go through the
[32:53] bitterness now and so we have these
[32:55] wonderful times when you're just fellow
[32:57] shipping and sometime it's in your
[32:58] prayer closet whatever the situation is
[33:00] that you have this honey excuse me you
[33:03] you're enjoying this honey but you know
[33:04] that there's another trial coming
[33:06] there's another the valley right down
[33:08] the
[33:09] road and what happens is you go through
[33:11] life and some of us getting a little old
[33:13] and we recognize something that you go
[33:15] through a valley and then you come up
[33:17] and then you go through a valley and
[33:18] then you come up and your entire life
[33:20] walking with Christ is going to be just
[33:22] like that the whole way you're on a
[33:23] roller
[33:25] coaster and the key to we or not you are
[33:27] you are succeeding or passing your test
[33:30] is because your your emotions don't do
[33:32] this with it your emotions are right
[33:34] there and no matter what you're going
[33:36] through all that's coming out of your
[33:37] mouth is praise and worship you want to
[33:41] know if you're growing in Christ what's
[33:42] coming out of your mouth when you're
[33:44] going through the hard times are you
[33:45] whining and complaining are you saying
[33:47] saying you do what you can do but I'm
[33:49] still going
[33:51] on that's what it takes that's what it
[33:54] is it's that simple
[33:55] anytime tries to make Christianity so
[33:59] complicated it is the simplest Concept
[34:02] in the
[34:03] world you just believe what God says and
[34:06] if you believe what God says and you
[34:08] grow in that Grace and that Faith then
[34:10] after a while you notice that you are
[34:13] maturing that's an amazing thing to see
[34:15] when you see that maturity in you you're
[34:17] like oh my goodness I don't react the
[34:19] way I used to I don't do the things I
[34:21] used to Satan used to throw a Temptation
[34:23] at me I just head over heels there I go
[34:25] it's like oh my goodness what are we
[34:27] doing here and now he throws it and I
[34:30] can overcome it and then I go head over
[34:33] heels all right but for a
[34:37] while hang on get my head on but but you
[34:41] find out
[34:45] you calm down feel you recognize that
[34:47] you are getting a place where Satan
[34:49] can't just knock you around like he used
[34:51] to have you noticed that isn't that
[34:54] amazing brother brandom said you can
[34:56] live so so close to Christ that he can't
[34:58] find
[34:59] you what does that mean it's like this
[35:03] maybe maybe 20 years ago I said brother
[35:05] Thomas you know I those shoes man
[35:07] they're really
[35:08] ugly and he said well I don't like yours
[35:11] either yours are like Podunk shoes hurt
[35:14] his feelings
[35:21] right now I what happened to brother
[35:23] Thomas I can't find him anymore he go to
[35:25] he Satan goes to push buttons and the
[35:27] only thing he sees is
[35:29] Christ your family go to push your
[35:31] buttons cuz they know your
[35:34] weakness right and they're in the bad
[35:35] mood so I want to kind of sass this
[35:37] person to push that person's button and
[35:39] they don't get any reaction yeah there's
[35:41] no reaction why because that old man is
[35:43] dead I'm gonna I'm gonna make a really
[35:45] really gr kind of analogy right here but
[35:49] okay but like you're driving down the
[35:50] road and you're looking around enjoying
[35:51] it and all of a sudden there's a dead
[35:52] pum oh I just ran over that dead
[35:54] pum you know who doesn't care that got
[35:57] run over the posum he's already dead he
[36:01] couldn't care less you run over him 20
[36:03] more times he's
[36:07] dead it's the same with us
[36:09] friends Satan pushes you and push you
[36:12] and push you all you get is a dead man
[36:14] what happened to brother Thomas oh he
[36:18] died ain't that amazing and when you see
[36:22] that in your brothers and sisters you
[36:23] talk about inspiring I say man I see I
[36:27] want that too I can have that too that's
[36:30] part of my that's that's my inheritance
[36:32] too I can be dead
[36:34] too you can choose this
[36:37] friends how do
[36:41] you you get there through the bidder
[36:46] y Something's Gonna offer
[36:50] you his
[36:52] religion and his religion he don't have
[36:55] bitter you can have
[36:58] what what you want Proverbs 5 talking
[37:03] about a horish
[37:05] woman but we're gonna you know the woman
[37:07] is a type of the church so when we talk
[37:09] about this don't think of a woman think
[37:11] of a church okay I me in fact I'm going
[37:13] to put Church in there first uh verse
[37:15] one Proverbs 51 my son attended to my
[37:19] wisdom and bow thine ear to my
[37:21] understanding that thou mayest regard
[37:23] discretion that thy lips may keep
[37:24] knowledge so he said what's coming out
[37:26] of your M it needs to be knowledged you
[37:27] need to make sure you're living
[37:28] correctly for the lips of a strange
[37:31] Church drops as in honeycomb and her
[37:34] mouth is smoother than oil what is this
[37:36] all about this is Satan's his
[37:39] Christianity his bride and you can find
[37:41] all kinds of churches and pastors and
[37:42] preachers and people and He will offer
[37:44] you a religion that you want that
[37:46] appeals to your nature appeals to your
[37:49] flesh your your emotion and I'm not
[37:51] talking about all the dozens of hundreds
[37:53] of churches around the world I'm talking
[37:55] about Methodist churches you can find
[37:56] this around the message you can find
[37:58] this in your Pew sitting next to you and
[38:00] I want a kind of religion I want to be a
[38:02] Christian according to my idea what a
[38:04] Christian should be and he offers it to
[38:07] you you can have any kind of
[38:08] Christianity you
[38:10] want it's smooth look look it's drops as
[38:14] honeycomb here we go back to Sweet again
[38:16] right and and it's her mouth is smoother
[38:19] than oil and you got someone who's going
[38:20] to scratch your ears and tell you what
[38:22] you want to hear because that way
[38:23] they'll keep you in the church and that
[38:25] way you're going to keep paying your
[38:26] time
[38:27] and you can sit there and be any kind of
[38:28] Christian you want to be and still be
[38:33] fine if you ever sit in a situation like
[38:36] that you need to get up and flee that's
[38:38] right if your pastor doesn't care enough
[38:39] to tell you the the truth and hurt your
[38:41] feelings once in a while he don't care
[38:43] about your
[38:44] soul he don't I have no problem with
[38:47] saying that because I know this
[38:48] gentleman here is going to hurt your
[38:49] feelings when it's
[38:51] needed some more you should have said
[38:53] Amen to
[38:55] that
[38:57] her mouth is smoother than oil but her
[38:59] end is bitter as warm word sharp as a
[39:01] two-edged sword her feet go down to Hell
[39:03] down to death her steps take hold on
[39:05] Hell lest thou should us Ponder the path
[39:07] of her life her ways are movable that
[39:09] thou cannot know them so what is it
[39:11] talking about you're building your house
[39:12] on on sinking sand on shifting sand and
[39:15] it's movable and you come in you go and
[39:16] say well I want to believe it this way
[39:18] and he said okay you can believe it that
[39:19] way well I think this is the way we
[39:21] should do yeah go ahead and do it any of
[39:22] your way because it's just going to just
[39:24] stroke your your feelings and what you
[39:26] want and you can be this wonderful great
[39:29] whoever it is that you think you want to
[39:30] be that's Satan's
[39:32] religion and it's sweet and is honey and
[39:35] you can have anything you want but
[39:36] remember at the end it's bitter so what
[39:40] you have you have a choice here you can
[39:42] either go through the bitter now and
[39:43] have eternal life or you can have the
[39:45] honey now and go to
[39:47] hell you you live now and die later or
[39:49] you die now or you live later that's
[39:51] it's that simple that's Christianity in
[39:53] a nutshell right there friends you die
[39:55] to yourself and you go through the hard
[39:56] times you go through the bitter and
[39:58] that's all about dying to self or you
[40:01] ignore that and you never say
[40:03] nevertheless you say no I'm not going to
[40:04] do this and you live the life you want
[40:06] to live now yeah that's right it's
[40:10] pretty cut and dry but that's what it
[40:11] comes down to friends and here's the
[40:13] really wonderful part once you are born
[40:15] again and you are born again that spirit
[40:17] inside you it won't let you escape the
[40:20] bitter you say you no boy come on back
[40:22] you're going through this
[40:24] trial you try and get up in the way
[40:26] snatch you he'll drag you right back
[40:27] said no you're not going anywhere well I
[40:29] don't want to go through this and until
[40:31] you get to the point where you say
[40:32] nevertheless amen nevertheless whatever
[40:36] you want I'm gonna read I'm gonna read
[40:38] last of scripture tonight if that's okay
[40:40] I'm GNA go to Hebrews
[40:46] 5 uh that's Romans where's
[40:53] Hebrews Hebrews 5 and 7 talking about
[40:56] Jesus again who in the days of his flesh
[40:58] when he had offered up prayers and
[40:59] supplication with strong crying and
[41:00] tears unto him that was able to save him
[41:02] from death and was heard in that he
[41:04] feared so here he is he's got to go
[41:06] through this and he was heard in that he
[41:08] feared so in other words the father
[41:11] heard what he was
[41:12] saying but he didn't stop
[41:15] it right he didn't stop it from
[41:17] happening he could have stopped okay I
[41:20] understand something you don't want to
[41:20] go through that we'll find another
[41:24] way strong CRI Eyes and Tears and him
[41:27] that was able to save him from Death he
[41:29] was able to but he didn't yeah though he
[41:33] were a son yet learn he obedience by the
[41:35] things which he suffered brother and
[41:37] sister that is the whole thing how do we
[41:39] learn obedience how do we learn to
[41:40] believe by the things we suffer for
[41:42] friends the way the things that change
[41:45] us is
[41:46] suffering it is living a happy good good
[41:50] good you know having a good lucky life
[41:52] everything's going good we don't change
[41:53] what's the point in changing there's
[41:55] nothing to change it
[41:56] it's the trials is what changes it's the
[41:58] trials what mold our character it's the
[42:00] trials that get to us after a while we
[42:02] said I am sick of this trial I got to
[42:03] overcome this I'm tired of stumbling
[42:05] this I'm tired of this happening over
[42:07] here I'm tired of this this this uh my
[42:10] family all rough up about something I
[42:11] I'm tired of having these things going
[42:13] on in the church I need a change yeah
[42:16] that's what brings change friends is
[42:18] when you go through suffering that's
[42:19] what changed Jesus character it's going
[42:21] to be the same for
[42:22] us
[42:24] amen let's go to Hebrews
[42:27] 10 and we're going to start at verse
[42:34] 32 Hebrews 10:32 it says but called to
[42:37] remembrance the former days in which
[42:39] after you were eliminated you endured a
[42:42] great fight fight great fight of
[42:44] Affliction so after the honey and then
[42:46] you went right into the bitter you see
[42:47] what that is you illuminated you got the
[42:49] honey it was sweet you took the message
[42:51] and you realized you a child of God and
[42:53] it was so wonderful and right away you
[42:55] going into a fight of Affliction because
[42:57] your family started rejecting you your
[42:58] friends started rejecting you started
[43:00] having all kinds of problem you
[43:01] recognize there things in your life that
[43:02] need to be changed and it become one
[43:05] step out and you just right into the
[43:07] battle and you're just battling ever
[43:10] since partly while you were made a
[43:13] gazing stop both by reproaches and
[43:14] affliction partly while you became comp
[43:17] Companions and that were so used and so
[43:19] people are looking at you and say look
[43:20] what kind of church are you going to or
[43:22] some of you a lot of you were raised in
[43:23] the message and your friends around
[43:24] there they look at you the way they do
[43:25] and said well you're just an eyeball yep
[43:28] you are an
[43:29] eyeball you might as well just get used
[43:31] to it so not not try to be halfway in
[43:33] the world and halfway out and well I'm
[43:35] GNA be a friend with my friends here but
[43:36] I'm still G to be a Christian no it
[43:38] don't work that way you stand for what's
[43:40] right and they'll respect you whether
[43:41] they like you or not and who cares if
[43:43] they do anyways because they don't
[43:46] matter they don't
[43:48] matter people's opinions of you do not
[43:52] matter there's there's one to get to
[43:54] after a while that you do what you're
[43:57] supposed to do no matter what people
[43:58] think about you no matter what they
[44:01] say for you had compassion on me and my
[44:03] bonds took joyfully the spoiling of your
[44:05] goods knowing in yourself that you have
[44:06] in heaven a better and enduring
[44:08] substance there it is that knowing that
[44:09] you you want to go through this bitter
[44:11] not because you know that you have
[44:12] something coming that doesn't even
[44:14] compare this this can't even hold a
[44:16] candle you go through let me just put
[44:18] this way once you get that new body
[44:20] everything you went through here in this
[44:21] life ain't going to matter and you're
[44:23] not going to care about it don't matter
[44:24] what you suffer everything it's all
[44:26] going to be have been worth it to get
[44:28] there can you imagine what that's going
[44:29] to be like that's right my cast not away
[44:33] there for your confidence which has
[44:34] great recompense of reward there's a
[44:36] great joy set before you for you have
[44:38] need patience that after you have done
[44:40] the will of God you might receive the
[44:42] promise there's the prence there you
[44:44] walk through the values and you go
[44:45] through this life and you go through one
[44:47] thing after another but you know that if
[44:48] I will just keep going I would just keep
[44:50] believing there's a reward at the end
[44:53] that's going to be worth it all it is I
[44:55] promise you for yet a little while he
[44:57] that shall come will come will not t now
[44:59] the just shall live by faith but if any
[45:01] man draw back my soul shall have no
[45:02] pleasure in him what does that mean is
[45:06] that I'm not willing to say nevertheless
[45:08] I'm not willing to say not my will but
[45:10] thine be done I don't like this I'm not
[45:12] going to accept it and I'm GNA pull back
[45:14] and I know the will War the will of the
[45:16] Lord is me for do this and go this and
[45:18] say this to this person and preach this
[45:20] or to do whatever it is he wants me to
[45:22] do but I just can't bring myself to do
[45:24] it and you draw
[45:27] back and you know you quit walking in
[45:29] faith because what you're saying is God
[45:31] I don't believe that what you're want me
[45:33] to do is going to make me happier than
[45:35] what Satan wants me to do I don't
[45:36] believe that that following your word
[45:38] and believing your word and going
[45:40] through this bitterness is really going
[45:41] to be what I want and I'm not going to
[45:43] do it I want my own
[45:48] way friend every one of us
[45:52] goes through that cuz Jesus himself did
[45:56] Jesus did not want to go through with
[45:58] that he had to pray repeatedly he had to
[46:01] spend hours in prayer to get his human
[46:03] part to the place where it would say
[46:05] nevertheless not my
[46:09] will think about it it's bitter friends
[46:12] there's a bitterness that goes to being
[46:14] a Christian and that has to do with you
[46:16] dying to yourself and your own your own
[46:18] ideas and everything you
[46:24] want but we are not of them who draw
[46:27] back into
[46:28] predition but of them that believe to
[46:30] the saving of the Soul ain't that
[46:32] amazing oh my I'm gonna turn to Romans
[46:43] 5 I thought it was there it is Romans 5
[46:48] And1 therefore being justified by faith
[46:50] we have peace with God through our Lord
[46:52] Jesus Christ by whom also we have access
[46:54] by faith into his grace where when we we
[46:55] stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory
[46:57] of
[47:01] God there it is we've rejoice in Hope of
[47:05] the glory of God we know that there's a
[47:07] something ahead there's a reward yes and
[47:11] because of that verse three says and not
[47:12] only so but we glory in Tribulation
[47:16] also now all of a sudden it didn't get
[47:18] so fun anymore wait a minute I want a
[47:21] joy and rejoice and hope of the glory
[47:23] but it says to glory and tribulation
[47:25] also
[47:28] friends this is a mature Christian this
[47:32] is what you come to if you're not there
[47:34] already you're going to get there so the
[47:37] sooner we get there the quicker we get
[47:38] out of here that's all right so let's
[47:41] just go ahead and say you know what I've
[47:43] been through this I've been through that
[47:44] I've seen God bring me through
[47:45] everything he brought me through I have
[47:47] another tribulation another trial right
[47:49] here well if he brought me all this way
[47:50] he didn't bring me here just to let me
[47:52] go he's gonna take me through this and
[47:54] I'm gonna look back at this and say
[47:55] praise God he took me through that and
[47:57] you hit another trial and you get
[47:58] through it you turn around and say
[47:59] praise God he took me through that and
[48:01] after a while when those Trials come you
[48:02] quit getting so discourage you say well
[48:04] he brought me this far he promised to
[48:05] take me the rest of the way and then you
[48:07] can glory in it because here's what
[48:08] happens every time you get through one
[48:09] of those trials you know what happens
[48:11] you're that much closer to Christ you're
[48:13] that much more Christlike and you
[48:14] recognize this is the best thing your
[48:16] trials are your best thing that you go
[48:18] through your trials are way more better
[48:20] for you than your
[48:23] honey it's true the honey is not molding
[48:27] character when I walked out of here in
[48:30] this atmosphere wonderful atmosphere it
[48:32] was not molding
[48:33] character it's needed we need to have
[48:38] it but if all we did was hang out in the
[48:41] honey we would be little kids with
[48:43] bottles in our
[48:44] mouths and if the honey ain't full one
[48:47] well I'm not going to go to church
[48:48] anymore I don't feel like it church is
[48:51] boring yeah churches go through these up

[50:04] right all these great Heroes of
[50:09] Faith one I mean 111 now Faith is a
[50:13] substance of things hope for the
[50:14] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[50:15] the elders obtain a good report and we

[50:26] and say my goodness what amazing people
[50:30] you recognize you can stand shoulder
[50:31] toosh shoulder with them and they can
[50:33] say the same thing about
[50:35] you it's true yes when it's all said and
[50:38] done you had the exact same Faith they
[50:41] did that's right and you overcame in a
[50:43] lot of ways more than any of them
[50:45] overcame because you're fighting a
[50:47] harder battle than they
[50:48] fought ain't that weird you say well I
[50:51] never had to build an ark or I never had
[50:53] to almost kill my son or
[50:56] or something like that yeah but the
[50:57] things you're overcoming is just as
[50:58] greater greater that's right it's true
[51:01] let's go all to verse 32 what shall I
[51:03] say more all these amazing people right
[51:06] all this great faith for the time would
[51:07] fail me to tell Gideon and Barack and
[51:09] Samson and Jeff and David and Samuel of
[51:12] the prophets who through faith subdued
[51:14] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[51:15] promises stopped the mouth of lions
[51:17] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[51:18] the edge of the sword out of weakness
[51:20] were made strong wax violent and fight
[51:21] turned to fight fight the armies of the
[51:23] enemy women receive their dead to life
[51:25] again oh my goodness look at all this
[51:27] stuff going on you notice what happened
[51:29] they went through a hard test they
[51:32] went to some bitterness and God came in
[51:35] did so great because they went through
[51:36] the battle first and they came out they
[51:38] kep believe in and so God could come
[51:41] down in that situation and bring him to
[51:43] life and and restore the dead and stop
[51:45] the armies and do that but you had to go
[51:46] through the battle first you had to have
[51:48] the faith to walk in there knowing God's
[51:50] going to take care of it when they went
[51:52] into the fiery furnace in down in
[51:54] Babylon they went in they said hey
[51:55] whether God's going to save us or not I
[51:57] don't know but I'm going to walk in
[51:58] faith because I'm not going to turn back
[52:00] on God the faith kept him going into it
[52:02] and God came on the scene came on the
[52:03] scene in in Daniels came on the scene
[52:05] with Joshua sto on the sun all these
[52:07] amazing things where there's a great
[52:09] battle and they stayed faithful so God
[52:10] came on the
[52:12] scene ain't that
[52:14] amazing how many times in your own life
[52:16] you could say you know what there's a
[52:17] great battle and I just kept believing I
[52:19] wouldn't get discouraged and God came on
[52:21] the scene and he healed me he set me
[52:23] free he did whatever it is he answered
[52:25] my prayer and I have the same testimony
[52:27] of these people
[52:33] did the
[52:35] dead raised to life again and others
[52:38] were
[52:39] tortured not accepting Deliverance that
[52:41] they might obtain a better Resurrection
[52:43] other had trial cruel mocking scourging
[52:45] bonds and imprisonment Stone and saw a
[52:49] thunder wait a
[52:51] minute what happened to the
[52:54] Deliverance
[52:56] yeah all these amazing people faith and
[53:00] then all a sudden they're being tortured
[53:01] to death they're being saw a center the
[53:03] being Stone why didn't Faith come and
[53:06] deliver
[53:09] them all of a sudden it gets a whole
[53:12] different story
[53:15] yeah pan delivers you oh no he
[53:21] doesn't you still un woken the
[53:24] bitter that's
[53:27] right because look at this other torture
[53:31] not accepting Deliverance that they
[53:33] might obtain a better Resurrection they
[53:35] could have been delivered but it been
[53:36] Satan's
[53:37] Deliverance all they had to do was
[53:40] renounce their faith say okay okay I
[53:42] hate Jesus Christ I I don't know nothing
[53:44] I'm not a Christian anymore I give it up
[53:47] and they would have been set
[53:49] free he said well where's the faith it
[53:52] was a faith that kept them being
[53:53] tortured see brothers and sisters
[53:55] sometime it takes the same Faith to die
[53:57] for Christ as it does to live for
[54:02] him but are you willing to do
[54:06] that are you willing to go through are
[54:08] you willing to be mocked and scourged
[54:10] and all these things that go through
[54:12] being a Christian and he said well why
[54:13] don't God come and deliver me he
[54:15] delivered that person he delivered that
[54:16] person why don't he deliver me because
[54:18] maybe he chose you for something
[54:21] else this church you know you know he he
[54:24] uh
[54:25] he delivered Lazarus right look what he
[54:28] had to go through first Steven was
[54:30] stoned to
[54:31] death he could have delivered Stephen he
[54:34] could have said no stop those stones but
[54:36] he
[54:37] didn't see because brother and sister
[54:41] Faith is recognizing and accepting God's
[54:44] perfect will for your
[54:46] life no matter how makes you feel no
[54:49] matter what you want that's
[54:52] right when you're praying for for a
[54:55] revelation faith is a revelation when
[54:57] you're praying for for for Revelation
[54:58] what what God wants for your life are
[55:00] you willing to accept what he gives
[55:02] you look at all the people have been
[55:05] sick sick for years and someone else is
[55:08] healed and you're saying well why don't
[55:09] I get
[55:12] healing because brother and sister God
[55:16] chose that person to glorify him name
[55:18] his name by healing him he chose another
[55:22] person to glorify his name by being
[55:24] faithful during this
[55:27] to be faithful to be faithful while
[55:30] you're going through
[55:33] it we don't want that I want to be the
[55:35] first person my myself I want to be the
[55:38] one who's
[55:40] healed but God gets to choose see that's
[55:43] why you put yourself in neutral when you
[55:44] go to pray God I I have this the doctor
[55:46] says I'm sick you know whatever is going
[55:48] on I'm praying I'm looking I'm seeking
[55:50] Revelation what's God's perfect will for
[55:51] this so I know what to whatever he tells
[55:53] me I have faith to walk in
[56:00] that and he says fill your
[56:05] healed praise God healed 10 years later
[56:09] I still have the same thing what's
[56:14] going he can heal you right now he can
[56:16] make you wait a while and you know let
[56:18] me just put this out you know you know
[56:19] people who've been sick for a while even
[56:21] died from it and they stayed faithful
[56:25] have you ever seen a more inspiring life
[56:28] than someone who's faithful all the way
[56:30] to
[56:32] death brother brother Donnie's
[56:38] daughter the stories that come out of
[56:40] her of that situation oh no there wasn't
[56:44] that was the same faith that stopped the
[56:47] sun
[56:49] right but she was chosen for that and
[56:52] her life was chosen to be Inspirations
[56:53] for how many people were touched by it
[56:56] but that's not what we want wanted
[56:58] nobody expected her to die everyone say
[57:00] surely God's going to heal her there are
[57:02] so many how many thousands and thousands
[57:03] of prayers and how much Faith was put in
[57:05] there and that Faith was strong there's
[57:06] no lack of faith in that it was God's
[57:08] will can now the question is can you
[57:10] accept his
[57:11] will because that's what faith does not
[57:14] my will but thine be done that's what
[57:16] nevertheless is I don't want to go
[57:18] through this I don't want to suffer this
[57:19] way I don't want to see this in my
[57:21] family I don't want to see my kids
[57:22] running out to the world I don't want to
[57:23] see this happening here I don't know
[57:25] want all all this stuff that's going on
[57:27] and yet you know that this is what God
[57:29] has chosen for you to go through and you
[57:30] say nevertheless not my will but thine
[57:33] be
[57:34] done that's what mature Christian does
[57:38] he say I don't want this I want I want a
[57:40] different job I don't like how this is
[57:42] going on my wife left me my kids hate me
[57:44] whatever the situation is but this is
[57:45] what God has chosen for you to go
[57:47] through to mold your character and so
[57:49] you're going to say nevertheless
[57:51] whatever I had to go through because at
[57:53] the end I know it's all going to be just
[57:55] fine God's going to fix
[57:58] it it's not our job to tell how or when
[58:02] by faith Jesus said nevertheless because
[58:05] he had the joy that was set before my
[58:07] brother and sister we have that Joy set
[58:08] before us that nevertheless whatever we
[58:10] have to go through it's going to be just
[58:12] fine if you continue to walk in
[58:16] faith that's the
[58:19] key to it don't be that that that fall
[58:22] back oh my goodness I just can't take
[58:24] this any with is there too much I just I
[58:26] just don't think I can keep going I'm
[58:28] just not going to do this anymore that's
[58:31] why we see so many people
[58:32] leave they get
[58:36] discouraged but I don't want this I
[58:37] don't want this path I don't want to be
[58:39] sick I don't want to have this
[58:40] temptation I don't want to have this
[58:41] besetting sin there's a good one
[58:43] especially for young
[58:44] people besetting sins Paul said we have
[58:48] them you know besetting sin is is
[58:50] something you struggle with and you pray
[58:52] about it and you you give it to God and
[58:54] you you claim victory and you fall again
[58:57] and you get prayed for it again and you
[58:59] go and talk to your pastor whatever the
[59:00] situation is and you know and you're
[59:02] claiming Victory and you fall
[59:04] again and Satan's right there the whole
[59:06] time if you were born again if you were
[59:09] born again if you were born
[59:13] again and you know what people do they
[59:15] get
[59:16] discouraged I just can't do it I just
[59:18] can't live I like such a hypocrite I'm
[59:19] just going to stay home now you just
[59:21] play right into Satan's
[59:23] hand
[59:25] you know one of the biggest black gues
[59:27] you can give to Satan is when he knocks
[59:29] you down on Saturday and you go to
[59:32] church on Sunday and act like nothing
[59:36] happened it's
[59:39] [Applause]
[59:42] true it's true because he gonna sit
[59:45] there and say you hypocrite what if
[59:47] everybody knew what you did
[59:50] yesterday they'd forgive me amen they're
[59:53] Christians and if they don't they ain't
[59:55] my brother and sister
[59:57] anyways
[59:59] oh they're Pharisee they're looking down
[1:00:02] their nose because they think that their
[1:00:03] sins are not as bad as
[1:00:12] mine boy it's easy to be a Pharisee
[1:00:14] isn't
[1:00:15] it it's so easy you
[1:00:20] see oh look at that person man they
[1:00:22] don't hardly ever get to church for six
[1:00:23] months
[1:00:25] and you're worse off than he is because
[1:00:27] you think you've done
[1:00:34] something look look the word gets down
[1:00:36] close he wants to cut all that junk out
[1:00:38] of there he just wants just your heart
[1:00:40] not all your
[1:00:41] religion
[1:00:46] amen don't want this path I don't want
[1:00:48] to you're going to overcome that thing
[1:00:51] and you might have fell a thousand times
[1:00:54] but a thous
[1:00:56] thousand and one times you got back you
[1:00:58] but you just keep coming and you just
[1:00:59] keep going and you just keep claiming
[1:01:01] the truth and you go keep going and
[1:01:04] what's God doing he is he is molding
[1:01:06] your character till you have the
[1:01:07] strength to defeat that thing yeah
[1:01:10] because what it is is every time we fall
[1:01:12] I think I
[1:01:14] spoke on this before every time we fall
[1:01:17] it's because we believe Satan's lie over
[1:01:19] God's truth what's going to make you
[1:01:21] happy I don't want to go through this
[1:01:23] I'm going to take an escape
[1:01:26] yeah and that's unbelief but when we
[1:01:29] walk in faith and finally get to the
[1:01:31] point where you know what I am going to
[1:01:32] believe God's word no matter what that
[1:01:34] thing says and you turn around that last
[1:01:36] time it says you're done and I'm walking
[1:01:38] free you'll come to that friend if you
[1:01:40] keep walking that's right absolutely
[1:01:42] Satan can't can't overcome you he can't
[1:01:44] knock you
[1:01:46] down it's like job he was going through
[1:01:49] some hard times he didn't like it he did
[1:01:52] not like what he was going through and
[1:01:54] everyone is discouraging his own wife
[1:01:56] was discouraging and said why don't you
[1:01:57] just curse God and it says he never
[1:02:00] charged God foolishly he said God gave
[1:02:03] he can take it away blessed be the name
[1:02:04] of the Lord and he said that and that
[1:02:06] was the right thing but then he on on
[1:02:08] past that he was just like he was in a
[1:02:10] hard time he was saying this ain't fair
[1:02:13] this is not what I should be going
[1:02:15] through you know what's what's the
[1:02:16] purpose of trying to be a good person if
[1:02:17] God lets you go through this it's the
[1:02:19] things we all think all the time we
[1:02:21] think about these things you know what's
[1:02:22] the purpose of being a Christian if I
[1:02:24] had to have this and if God's A Healer
[1:02:26] why am I going through this and if God's
[1:02:27] a deliverer why do I have this problem
[1:02:29] if God's going to sa my kids why are
[1:02:31] they out running in the world and we
[1:02:32] have all these questions we keep asking
[1:02:34] these things and it's very foolish
[1:02:38] questions blessed be the name of the
[1:02:40] Lord the go God brought me this far
[1:02:42] he'll bring me the rest of the way
[1:02:44] blessed be the name of the
[1:02:47] Lord Brother brandom got to that point
[1:02:50] he got that close to CH to charging God
[1:02:52] foolishly you know what he's talking
[1:02:53] about he said I was ready to say well
[1:02:56] that's the way he's going to treat me
[1:02:58] I'm quitting forget it he opens his
[1:03:01] mouth to say that and what came out the
[1:03:03] Lord gives the Lord take it away blessed
[1:03:05] be the name of the Lord why because he
[1:03:07] said there's a tie poost inside there
[1:03:10] there's something inside that held him
[1:03:12] you can't do this on your own you can't
[1:03:13] go through the bitterness with with on
[1:03:15] your own you will walk away it's too
[1:03:17] much sat can make it too hard but
[1:03:19] brother and sister when there's
[1:03:20] something inside that holds you oh my
[1:03:24] something inside hold you and when
[1:03:26] you're ready to give up and something
[1:03:27] said no come on come on picks you up and
[1:03:30] go and sometime that's when you get to
[1:03:32] church you barely drag yourself and you
[1:03:34] sit on the back row back I'm not saying
[1:03:35] anything you s in back row I know you're
[1:03:37] back there for the right reason but you
[1:03:39] sit on you sit on the back row because
[1:03:41] you can't have the faith to walk any
[1:03:43] farther up and the and brother Thomas
[1:03:45] gets up there he preaches something and
[1:03:47] you know God spoke directly to you and
[1:03:50] God know exactly what you're going
[1:03:52] through and it just gave you enough
[1:03:53] strength to get back up and go back and
[1:03:55] have lunch with someone and come to
[1:03:56] church the next
[1:03:58] time and what do you do you recognize
[1:04:01] Man this ain't me doing this at all this
[1:04:02] is the the the the the power of God is
[1:04:05] moving me along and giving me the
[1:04:07] strength to keep
[1:04:08] going is that amazing on you know why he
[1:04:11] does that because he loves
[1:04:13] you that's all it
[1:04:16] is so God delivers through life and
[1:04:19] through
[1:04:20] death he answers prayer he answers every
[1:04:23] prayer
[1:04:24] sometime he is yes sometime no sometime
[1:04:28] wait and sometime he don't say anything
[1:04:30] that's an
[1:04:31] answer it
[1:04:35] is Hebrews

[1:04:41] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:04:43] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:04:44] and the sin which does so easily beset
[1:04:46] us let us run with patience the race
[1:04:48] that set before it's the whole thing is
[1:04:50] patient just be patient just keep going
[1:04:52] just keep going there's going to be hard
[1:04:55] times there's going to be good times
[1:04:57] yeah just keep pressing on that's right
[1:04:59] that's all you got to
[1:05:02] do now I'm going to read
[1:05:07] um yeah I got
[1:05:10] time let's keep going I I read verse two
[1:05:13] let's go down to verse three for
[1:05:14] consider him that endured such
[1:05:16] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[1:05:17] let you be weird and faint in your
[1:05:20] minds don't be Wei and faint in your
[1:05:22] mind that's all it's saying how do you
[1:05:24] do that you just keep walking you keep
[1:05:25] believing you have not resisted un blood

[1:05:30] as
[1:05:30] un children my son despise not the
[1:05:34] changes that simple friends these trials
[1:05:36] we go through the the the disciplines
[1:05:38] and all these things it sometime it's a
[1:05:40] rebuke from the Holy Spirit saying you
[1:05:42] know what you have the wrong attitude
[1:05:43] here you got the wrong approach there
[1:05:46] yes right you're believing the wrong
[1:05:50] thing here you're protecting
[1:05:53] yourself
[1:05:54] For Whom The Love Lord loveth he
[1:05:56] chasteneth and scourges every son whom
[1:05:58] he receiveth and if you don't accept
[1:06:00] it if you're not partakers and you're
[1:06:02] not Sons you're bastard and not Sons so

[1:06:28] does Amen Let's uh let me turn change
[1:06:32] just a little bit here uh John 11 gonna
[1:06:35] go to John 11 we GNA talk about
[1:06:39] Lazarus we all know the story so I'm not
[1:06:41] going to read a lot of
[1:06:43] it but we're going to start at 11 uh
[1:06:48] 20 John 11:20 then Martha as soon as she
[1:06:52] heard that Jesus went and met him but
[1:06:54] but Mary sat still in the house Minds
[1:06:57] when he didn't show up surely Jesus was
[1:06:59] going to come as soon as he heard he was
[1:07:00] sick and he was seriously sick so I sent
[1:07:02] him again hey he's dying you need to
[1:07:03] come and the the the the runner came
[1:07:06] back and said he he ain't
[1:07:08] coming he yes he is La did you tell him
[1:07:12] Lazarus is dying yeah he said he's gonna
[1:07:15] stay there for another day or two he's
[1:07:16] busy what was he doing sitting out in
[1:07:19] the
[1:07:21] sun what yeah he was just he was just
[1:07:25] rest they're eating they're having a
[1:07:27] good time La you told him Lazarus is
[1:07:30] done
[1:07:33] yeah well what kind of a friend is
[1:07:38] that you ever feel that when you pray
[1:07:40] and pray and pray and you don't get an
[1:07:44] answer what are you
[1:07:47] doing why don't you answer me where is
[1:07:49] you at I I prayed and prayed and you
[1:07:50] don't come and I need your presence I'm
[1:07:52] I'm having a hard time where is you

[1:07:59] died and it was
[1:08:01] over oh my goodness what good was having
[1:08:05] Jesus for your friend
[1:08:08] now because he let my brother
[1:08:12] die but there's two responses Martha's
[1:08:16] and Mary's right something that anchored
[1:08:19] in Martha that hadn't anchored as deep
[1:08:20] in
[1:08:21] Mary because when Martha heard he was
[1:08:23] coming she got up and went to meet him
[1:08:27] and Mary sat
[1:08:29] still her faith was paralyzed by The
[1:08:34] Bitter she lost
[1:08:36] confidence she couldn't
[1:08:39] move so she sat
[1:08:42] there been
[1:08:44] there yes
[1:08:47] sir just
[1:08:49] depression down don't have enough energy
[1:08:52] to breathe my next breath
[1:08:55] just wish you could crawl in a hole and
[1:08:57] get
[1:09:00] buried Martha got to Jesus she said Lord
[1:09:02] if thou had been here my brother had not
[1:09:04] died but I know that even
[1:09:09] now oh my even
[1:09:13] now even now whatever you ask of God God
[1:09:16] will give it to thee is that amazing
[1:09:19] Mary sat still Martha said yeah but even
[1:09:22] now he's dead but whatever you ask God
[1:09:25] will do for you something that
[1:09:28] anchored Jesus said thy brother shall
[1:09:30] rise again Mark says I know he should
[1:09:32] rise and Resurrection the last day Jesus
[1:09:34] said I am the resurrection and the life
[1:09:36] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:09:37] dead yet shall he live what whosoever
[1:09:39] liveth and believeth him he shall never
[1:09:40] die believest thou this preach your
[1:09:42] little servant get her faith just a
[1:09:44] little bit higher she said yeah he Lord
[1:09:47] I believe that thou are the Christ the
[1:09:48] son of God which should come into the
[1:09:51] world oh my they were having quite a
[1:09:53] time there some honey flowing right
[1:09:58] there and when she had said so she went
[1:10:00] her way and called Mary her sister
[1:10:02] secretly
[1:10:04] saying the master has come and call us
[1:10:07] for thee as soon as she heard that she
[1:10:10] Rose quickly and came unto
[1:10:12] him why what stirred Mary's Faith she
[1:10:16] heard her name
[1:10:17] called The Master's calling for you
[1:10:20] you're sitting down there in your Pew
[1:10:21] and you can't hardly move and you just
[1:10:22] can't wait to get out church because you
[1:10:24] feel like such a hypocrite and all of a
[1:10:25] sudden something comes across the pulpit
[1:10:27] and you know he just called your name he
[1:10:30] spoke directly to your need and you know
[1:10:32] that he still cares you know that he is
[1:10:35] still around you know that he is still
[1:10:36] here and that he never left you you
[1:10:38] might have walked away you might feel
[1:10:39] like you're totally abandoned but you
[1:10:41] realize that he was there all the
[1:10:43] time he would just move and he would
[1:10:45] just just stripping a few shaving a
[1:10:47] little bit more of yourself off you so
[1:10:49] that he can manifest himself when you
[1:10:52] hear that personal call you feel that
[1:10:54] personal word that comes to you then
[1:10:56] everything everything is okay again and
[1:10:58] it can happen just like that and that
[1:11:01] amazing that still Small Voice and you
[1:11:03] hear your voice called he says oh he's
[1:11:05] still here he said I've been doing this
[1:11:09] how come you don't believe how come you
[1:11:11] doubt me why you I I've been here the
[1:11:12] whole time I brought you through
[1:11:13] everything I brought you through and yet
[1:11:15] when something goes wrong you're ready
[1:11:16] to be like the disciples in the ship oh
[1:11:18] my goodness we're gonna die he's right
[1:11:19] back there sleeping I know but we're
[1:11:21] gonna die he's in the boat I know but
[1:11:24] we're going to die wake them
[1:11:26] up you can't wake them up with your lips
[1:11:29] you can't call on the scene with your
[1:11:31] lips you can't come on the scene with
[1:11:33] your prayers doesn't that sound weird so
[1:11:36] the prophet said your prayers doesn't
[1:11:37] come on the scene your lips doesn't C on
[1:11:39] the scene you know what does faith all
[1:11:41] he's looking for is Faith and you don't
[1:11:43] even have to say a thing but from your
[1:11:45] heart you just recognize yeah but I
[1:11:47] still believe I don't care what Satan
[1:11:49] does I still believe I don't care what
[1:11:50] I'm going through I still believe and I
[1:11:52] might look like a HP I might be the
[1:11:54] worst person in the church but something
[1:11:56] inside of me still believes and I'm not
[1:11:58] going to give
[1:11:59] up something keep's holding
[1:12:04] me yeah Mary ran out there and said oh
[1:12:07] he still cares we saw what happen amen
[1:12:11] amen I have I have to read this one more
[1:12:13] quote this one quote and it's a little
[1:12:17] bit long so I'm going to shorten it a
[1:12:18] little
[1:12:19] bit is in SM Church age just kind of
[1:12:23] everything together then we're going to
[1:12:24] be
[1:12:25] done talking about going through
[1:12:28] suffering the Lord Lord God Almighty
[1:12:31] says I
[1:12:32] know there he is walking in the midst of
[1:12:34] the people there he is the chief
[1:12:36] Shepherd of the flock but does he hold
[1:12:37] back the persecution does he stand the
[1:12:40] tribulation no he does
[1:12:42] not he simply says I know your
[1:12:46] tribulation I am not at all unmindful of
[1:12:48] your
[1:12:50] suffering sometime he looks at you and
[1:12:52] you're suffering with what whatever it
[1:12:53] is he says I know what you're going
[1:12:55] through you can come here and have a
[1:12:56] wonderful service you got something on
[1:12:58] your mind you pray for it maybe it's a
[1:13:00] physical illness maybe it's you need
[1:13:01] Deliverance whatever it is and you have
[1:13:03] a wonderful time and you walk out the
[1:13:06] door you realize you still got that
[1:13:09] problem said why didn't he heal me why
[1:13:11] didn't he take that
[1:13:13] away he said I know I'm gonna bless you
[1:13:17] I'm going to be part of your worship
[1:13:18] you're going to feel my
[1:13:20] presence I know what you're going
[1:13:22] through but I'm not going to deliver You
[1:13:26] Yet brother Braham
[1:13:28] said what a stumbling block that is to
[1:13:31] so many people like Israel they wonder
[1:13:34] if God really loves them how can God be
[1:13:36] just and loving if he stands by and
[1:13:37] watches as people
[1:13:41] suffer if you have that attitude friends
[1:13:44] it's time to grow up yes time to grow
[1:13:49] up he lets you suffer because he knows
[1:13:52] it's best for you
[1:13:54] we go through this everyone goes through
[1:13:57] it now there's some scripture like I
[1:13:59] said I'm going to skip some of this down
[1:14:00] you can go read I recommend you do you
[1:14:03] see they could not figure out God's love
[1:14:05] they thought that love meant no
[1:14:06] suffering they meant a baby with
[1:14:08] parental care but God said his love was
[1:14:09] elective love the proof of his love is
[1:14:11] election no matter what happens his love
[1:14:13] was proven True by the fact they were
[1:14:15] chosen unto salvation friends this is
[1:14:18] how you know God loves you because he
[1:14:19] chose you it's election when you see
[1:14:21] that you've been elected then you know
[1:14:23] God loves you because you're part of his
[1:14:24] family you know how you kind of love
[1:14:26] your family a little special God does
[1:14:28] too he said these are my kids I'm going
[1:14:29] to love them a little special and I'm
[1:14:31] not g to lose
[1:14:34] him he may commit you to death as he did
[1:14:37] Paul he may commit you to suffering as
[1:14:39] he did
[1:14:40] job that is his
[1:14:43] prerogative he is
[1:14:45] Sovereign are you willing to let him
[1:14:47] have his
[1:14:49] way are you willing to let him choose
[1:14:52] how your life glorifies IES
[1:14:54] him yes through suffering through death
[1:14:59] through
[1:15:05] loss but it is all with a purpose if you
[1:15:07] did not have a purpose then he would be
[1:15:09] the author of frustration not of Peace
[1:15:11] his purpose is that after we have
[1:15:12] suffered with a while we would be made
[1:15:14] perfect be established strengthen and
[1:15:16] settled suffering is the only way we get
[1:15:18] to that point friend you have to suffer
[1:15:20] we all have to suffer and you can suffer
[1:15:23] for the devil you can suffer for Christ
[1:15:24] you're going to suffer for
[1:15:26] somebody but you might as well make it
[1:15:30] worthwhile because you suffer for the
[1:15:31] devil you have bitterness at the end and
[1:15:34] you're G to stand there one day and say
[1:15:35] oh my goodness what a fool I was I had
[1:15:38] every opportunity to have eternal
[1:15:41] life that's
[1:15:44] right but I let Satan talk me out of it
[1:15:47] because he told me that that bitterness
[1:15:48] was too much for me I could be happier
[1:15:51] without it
[1:15:58] he quotes Hebrews he were son yet learn
[1:15:59] obedience by the things which he
[1:16:00] suffered being made perfect he be the
[1:16:02] author and of Eternal salvation to all
[1:16:04] them that obey him in plain language the
[1:16:06] very character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:16:08] suffering and according to Paul he has
[1:16:10] left his church a measure of suffering
[1:16:11] that they too by their faith in God
[1:16:13] while suffering for him would come to a
[1:16:15] place of
[1:16:17] perfection we have to suffer for him to
[1:16:19] come to a place Perfection we want to go
[1:16:21] on the on the Rapture you got to have
[1:16:22] perfect love you got to have perfect
[1:16:24] Faith all these things you got to have
[1:16:25] it friends and the only way we get that
[1:16:27] to express is when we die to ourselves
[1:16:30] and let Christ be manifest to us only
[1:16:32] way it's gonna
[1:16:34] happen let me just try to finish
[1:16:40] here he said Peter says think not
[1:16:42] strange concerning the fiery trials that
[1:16:44] are to try you that is what Peter said
[1:16:45] is it strange that God wants us to
[1:16:46] develop a Christlike character that
[1:16:48] comes through suffering no sir we all
[1:16:50] have trials we all have tried and chasen
[1:16:52] his sons not one but goes through that
[1:16:54] the church that is not suffering and is
[1:16:56] not being tried hasn't got it it isn't
[1:16:59] of
[1:17:00] God what a difference from the attitudes
[1:17:03] many times we got trouble in our church
[1:17:04] maybe I should go to another church well
[1:17:06] if your church ain't suffering and being
[1:17:07] tried it isn't of God so why are you
[1:17:09] going leaving for when you know God's in
[1:17:11] the midst of it think about that if it's
[1:17:14] not being tried if not suffering it
[1:17:16] ain't of God every person in every
[1:17:18] church and everyone goes through this
[1:17:19] kind of stuff it's what we have to do
[1:17:21] you know what you know what happens and
[1:17:23] you all know this you've been through
[1:17:24] enough trials well you know what happens
[1:17:26] when there's a a problem in the church
[1:17:27] and you work together and you get
[1:17:28] through it after a while it just makes
[1:17:30] you closer to each other if you want
[1:17:32] through with the right
[1:17:33] attitude it sure does it makes you a
[1:17:35] stronger Church makes you a stronger
[1:17:38] person the the cotty skies and storms
[1:17:41] the life for no signs of God's
[1:17:42] disapproval neither are the bright Skies
[1:17:44] the still water signs of his love and
[1:17:45] approval his approval of any of us is
[1:17:47] only in the
[1:17:48] belove his love is the election which
[1:17:51] he's elected which he had for us before
[1:17:52] the foundation of the world does he love
[1:17:54] us yes how shall we know it because he
[1:17:56] said
[1:17:58] so let me just stop there one more time
[1:18:00] I'm going to I'm gonna wind it up here
[1:18:02] but anytime you say I don't even know
[1:18:04] God loves me you just called him a liar
[1:18:06] he said he loves you what more do you
[1:18:08] want well I don't feel his love well
[1:18:11] what does that have to do with are you a
[1:18:12] feeler now you just go by your feelings
[1:18:15] or do you go by what he said you go by
[1:18:17] faith because he allows you to feel all
[1:18:19] kinds of ways to prove that when you're
[1:18:21] feeling down and beat down and you don't
[1:18:23] feel lovable and you just you know your
[1:18:26] family can't stand you your dog can't
[1:18:28] stand you and yet still God loves you
[1:18:30] because he said he
[1:18:36] did you ever see someone who needs that
[1:18:39] constant
[1:18:40] reassurance do you love me do you love
[1:18:42] me
[1:18:44] yes oh my goodness how many times do I
[1:18:47] have to say
[1:18:48] so and yet that's how we are so many
[1:18:51] times with God
[1:18:53] yes I love you I brought you to church
[1:18:55] tonight didn't I you think you out here
[1:18:57] on your own right you Lord I came with
[1:18:59] my presence when you're here do you
[1:19:01] think that was your
[1:19:03] presence I preach the word to encourage
[1:19:05] you do you think that was Phil's
[1:19:08] word he loves us he wants us to believe
[1:19:11] that and if we will just just just deny
[1:19:14] Satan's junk and all that that that that
[1:19:16] doubt and fear and all that other stuff
[1:19:18] he keeps putting in our head and all
[1:19:20] that junk we just deny that and just say
[1:19:23] God loves me Satan what are you going to
[1:19:25] do about
[1:19:27] it just keep going in
[1:19:31] patience oh my goodness that's all he's
[1:19:34] looking
[1:19:36] for let me finish this y'all go ahead
[1:19:38] and stand I I can quit preaching if it's
[1:19:40] stand go
[1:19:41] ahead you L us amen yes but how shall we
[1:19:45] know we shall know because he said and
[1:19:48] manifest that he did love us for he
[1:19:49] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[1:19:51] Spirit placing us as his
[1:19:54] sons that's what's going on you look
[1:19:56] around he's placed us as his sons here
[1:19:58] we are Sons and Daughters of God he has
[1:20:00] done this
[1:20:01] work how shall I prove my love to him by
[1:20:04] believing what he said that's all he's
[1:20:07] asking for simple as that believing what
[1:20:10] he said and then if I do that conducting
[1:20:12] myself with joyid the trials that he and
[1:20:15] his wisdom allows to come to pass isn't

[1:23:24] anymore you say oh no it's still there
[1:23:26] but the evidence that I'm suffering is
[1:23:28] under the blood because I know what God
[1:23:30] has done for me and he has promised me
[1:23:32] deliverance and if it's through
[1:23:33] Deliverance in this body or getting a
[1:23:35] new body I don't care but I'm still
[1:23:38] delivered ask ask brother Donnie's
[1:23:41] daughter if she's sick right
[1:23:43] now she ain't sick anymore she never
[1:23:46] going to be sick again and brother and
[1:23:48] sister if he he ordains that you're
[1:23:50] going to suffer through this life and
[1:23:51] your whole life it's just built around
[1:23:53] suffering and suffering and yet you come
[1:23:55] to a place where people only see Christ
[1:23:57] through you that was your purpose in
[1:23:59] this
[1:24:01] life what's your testimony because I am
[1:24:04] faithful through the bitterness and if
[1:24:05] it takes all the way to the end then I'm
[1:24:07] still faithful that takes more faith
[1:24:09] than some God coming down and just
[1:24:11] setting you free right
[1:24:12] here but it's not what we want nobody
[1:24:16] wants that bitterness no one wants that
[1:24:18] P because we want to have a great
[1:24:19] testimony look what God did and set me
[1:24:21] free
[1:24:24] but you don't get to
[1:24:26] choose you don't get to choose your
[1:24:29] purpose in life I was quick preaching
[1:24:32] you don't get to choose what was going
[1:24:33] on you don't get to choose how your life
[1:24:35] is going to glorify God you have to
[1:24:37] recognize it and you get that
[1:24:39] relationship with Christ and he said
[1:24:40] this is what I want in your life are you
[1:24:42] willing to walk this path and you're GNA
[1:24:44] say oh take this from me I don't want
[1:24:47] this path
[1:24:49] nevertheless not my will but what you
[1:24:52] want done and someone looks at you say
[1:24:55] all I see is Christ God bless you
