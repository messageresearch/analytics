[57:19] Father and from the father of our Lord
[57:22] Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all
[57:25] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[57:28] in Christ
[57:30] according as he has chosen Us in him
[57:34] before the foundation of the world that
[57:36] we should be holy and Without Blame
[57:38] before him in love having predestinated
[57:41] us unto the adoption of children by
[57:43] Jesus Christ to himself according to
[57:46] good pleasure of his will jump over to
[57:49] verse n having made known unto us the
[57:52] mystery of is well now notice this last
[57:54] verse it talks about amen that he
[57:56] adopted us amen according to the good
[57:59] pleasure of his will now verse n it says
[58:02] having made known unto us the mystery of
[58:05] his will amen according to his good
[58:08] pleasure which he hath purposed in
[58:10] himself verse 11 in whom also we have
[58:13] obtained an inheritance being
[58:15] predestinated according to the purpose
[58:17] of him who worketh all things after the
[58:20] counil of his own will that we should be
[58:23] to the praise of his glory
[58:25] who first trusted in Christ in whom ye
[58:27] also trusted after you heard the word of
[58:30] Truth amen the gospel of your salvation
[58:33] how many has been there amen been there
[58:35] and done that in whom also you have
[58:38] after ye believed you were sealed with
[58:39] the Holy Spirit of Promise which is the
[58:42] earnest of our inheritance until the
[58:44] Redemption of the purchased possession
[58:46] unto the praise of his glory may God add
[58:49] His blessings to the reading of the word
[58:50] you can be seated tonight I want to
[58:52] speak about abiding in the the will of
[58:55] God Amen first I just wanted to speak on
[58:57] the will of God but I want to talk about
[58:59] abiding in the will of God I like
[59:03] Revelations I was just going to read
[59:04] that first verse there am me just one
[59:07] verse it talks about and all who dwell
[59:09] on the purch on the
[59:11] Earth shall worship Him whose names are
[59:13] not written in the book
[59:17] of said this week he says you
[59:21] know know the message that he preached
[59:24] on here him amen he just used like one
[59:26] simple little scripture amen but he said
[59:29] amen and so you can just take one
[59:32] scripture just a scripture like what we
[59:33] read right there and we just
[59:37] realize that what we have read is of
[59:39] course the mystery that everybody
[59:42] doesn't really understand amen people
[59:45] don't people of the world don't really
[59:47] understand what it's all
[59:49] about amen but now let's just let's just
[59:52] try to lay something here talking about
[59:54] the will will of God anden when I think
[59:56] beg to think about the will of God that
[59:58] I begin to think about that song about
[1:00:01] when he was on the cross I was on his
[1:00:03] mind amen I mean know I was on his mind
[1:00:06] when he was on the cross amen and uh
[1:00:10] also that other song about talking about
[1:00:13] uh talking about his will amen with the
[1:00:16] man on the cross had my name in his will
[1:00:21] amen praise the Lord Jesus I believe one
[1:00:23] place set Noah Testament isn't in in
[1:00:27] effect until the testator is dead
[1:00:30] remember when we take the communion he
[1:00:31] said this is the New Testament in my
[1:00:33] blood so the New Testament is the new
[1:00:36] The Testament of Jesus Christ amen and
[1:00:40] the other thought is that you know you
[1:00:42] as to ask the question well what is the
[1:00:45] will of God what is the will of God
[1:00:48] brother bam says you know God's word is
[1:00:51] his
[1:00:53] will amen and that's why I wanted to

[1:04:39] here but one of the will of God is for
[1:04:41] to chastise you as many as I love his
[1:04:44] will is to chasten you to rebuke
[1:04:50] you if you want to be a Christian first
[1:04:52] thing you can expect is a good old
[1:04:54] fashion rebuke chastisement a whipping
[1:04:58] from God it's all in the program it's
[1:05:00] all in the will of God for that to be so
[1:05:06] amen that's right because we have got
[1:05:08] some ways that we ought to
[1:05:11] have we still got ways we ought to have
[1:05:15] we think things that we ought and
[1:05:17] think do things that we oughtn't do
[1:05:21] amen but I want the mind of Christ I the
[1:05:24] will of God in my life I desire nothing
[1:05:27] more as what Jesus said you know he said
[1:05:30] remember he said uh they came back to
[1:05:32] him Jesus said have you got any meat
[1:05:34] here he says my meat is to do the
[1:05:36] father's will I don't care if I eat or
[1:05:39] if I don't eat my heart's desire and
[1:05:41] passion is to do God's
[1:05:44] will that's my thought tonight how many
[1:05:46] wants to be in God's
[1:05:49] will cuz I want to tell you something
[1:05:51] tonight it's a horrible thing to be be
[1:05:54] in his permissive
[1:05:55] will his permissive will is a place that
[1:05:58] you don't want to
[1:06:01] be
[1:06:04] amen and many many many people get out
[1:06:07] of the will of
[1:06:08] God so sad to say but many
[1:06:12] do many people get out of the will of
[1:06:16] God his word is his will so if you ever
[1:06:19] want to know whether you know you you're
[1:06:22] doing God's will or not just see if
[1:06:24] you're doing his word or not
[1:06:27] amen how many's glad that you accepted
[1:06:30] acts 238 you accepted John 3:16
[1:06:34] whosoever believeth in me shall not
[1:06:36] perish but have everlasting life Lord
[1:06:39] you accepted his will you realize
[1:06:42] tonight that it's not his
[1:06:45] will that any should perish if it's not
[1:06:48] his perfect will that any should perish
[1:06:51] then it has to be his permissive will
[1:06:54] right ain't never heard that before have
[1:06:57] you that's right it's his permissive
[1:06:59] will in other words if you really want
[1:07:01] to go you can he'll permit
[1:07:04] you it's called free choice free m
[1:07:11] agency let's take a
[1:07:13] little
[1:07:16] trip I love taking a little trip let's
[1:07:18] not go back so far that God's alone
[1:07:21] anymore let's go back to where he had
[1:07:24] created Millions perhaps of
[1:07:26] angels hundreds of thousands of angels I
[1:07:29] don't just how many it was ain't that
[1:07:32] right and he had one special Angel there
[1:07:35] that was right there beside God we're
[1:07:37] going to call him God's rightand
[1:07:41] man right next to God ain't that
[1:07:45] right amen and of course we know that uh
[1:07:50] that was the first he was he was walked
[1:07:52] among the coals of God and the glory of
[1:07:55] God the beauty of
[1:07:57] God I just can't grasp why he wasn't
[1:08:02] happy I just can't grasp it but he was
[1:08:05] right where he was supposed to
[1:08:08] be a that right he was right where he's
[1:08:11] supposed to be we're going say that he
[1:08:13] was perfectly in the will of
[1:08:15] God and I never knew it until the
[1:08:17] Prophet come along and told us that all
[1:08:20] those angels and everybody up there was
[1:08:22] put on free moral agency to
[1:08:25] [Music]
[1:08:30] I'm just going to say something off the
[1:08:32] wall a little bit hang on I hope when we
[1:08:35] get over there brother Tommy there ain't
[1:08:36] no more free moral agency Lord Jesus you
[1:08:39] lock me in don't you let me I don't want
[1:08:41] to have a choice I want to be there I
[1:08:43] you know are you with
[1:08:45] me I want be locked in cuz we have a
[1:08:49] tendency to mess up when we have free
[1:08:51] moral agency we have a strong long
[1:08:54] tendency to mess
[1:08:56] up I don't know whether there will be or
[1:08:58] not
[1:08:59] amen I don't know that but I'm just
[1:09:03] saying I hope not I hope that uh you
[1:09:06] know won't be any of that anymore why
[1:09:09] perhaps because we made our choice down
[1:09:11] here I mean we we're free moral
[1:09:15] agents you had you could choose whether
[1:09:17] you wanted to come to church or not
[1:09:19] tonight can boy I'll tell you what I'm a
[1:09:23] I I'm a preacher that believes that you
[1:09:25] can do what you
[1:09:28] want I'm here to tell I believe that you
[1:09:30] ought to do what you
[1:09:35] want cuz if you come to church and you
[1:09:37] don't really want it you really hate it
[1:09:40] you're going to be a miserable creature
[1:09:42] and you're not going to be there
[1:09:44] anyway huh not going to be there anyone
[1:09:48] anyway but it has to be in your heart I
[1:09:50] mean know it has to be in your heart
[1:09:52] that's why we pray for our children
[1:09:53] children by the time they get up let's
[1:09:55] hope that they've got a passion to want
[1:09:56] to know God to love God with all of
[1:09:59] their heart mind soul and strength I
[1:10:02] justify that statement by saying what
[1:10:04] Jesus said he said I would that you were
[1:10:06] either cold or
[1:10:08] hot and that even God want you to either
[1:10:12] be hot or go get
[1:10:16] cold amen but don't be somewhere in
[1:10:19] between somewhere in between is the most
[1:10:21] miserable place that you can been after
[1:10:23] amen you
[1:10:25] know after he decided that he wanted to
[1:10:28] be like God he wanted to have a kingdom
[1:10:30] this that or the other what did he do he
[1:10:32] actually got out of the will of God
[1:10:34] didn't he he got out of the will of God
[1:10:36] and look where he's at today he is one
[1:10:40] miserable
[1:10:44] creature no chance of being
[1:10:47] saved
[1:10:48] amen and he went to blabbering his mouth
[1:10:52] all over heaven you
[1:10:54] know God just thinks he's the only holy
[1:10:58] one around

[1:11:02] glory do you realize that same Spirit
[1:11:04] got into Dayan and Kora when brother
[1:11:07] Brandon was in Johannesburg one of those
[1:11:09] ministers when brother bam said it's not
[1:11:11] the will of God for us to go over into
[1:11:12] these other cities God told me to stay
[1:11:15] right here one of the ministers said
[1:11:18] yeah but do you are what are you do you
[1:11:19] think you're the only one that gets
[1:11:21] hears from God better bam on the tapes
[1:11:24] says you know that's exactly what naan

[1:11:28] swallowed him up
[1:11:31] alive
[1:11:32] amen I I hope to get to it but I wanted
[1:11:35] to touch on that for just a minute
[1:11:36] because even brother bam got out of the
[1:11:38] perfect will of God down in uh Down in
[1:11:41] Africa and so forth those places isn't
[1:11:42] that right God had told him and I'll

[1:22:12] to be when you feel like you're getting
[1:22:15] a weapon like you ain't never had
[1:22:17] remember it's the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:22:19] getting you back to the baptism of the

[1:27:10] Christian going through every Brier
[1:27:12] patch you could

[1:27:39] this really down in our hearts and lives
[1:27:41] it'll save you a lot of trouble down the
[1:27:44] road how many believe let's remember
[1:27:47] this don't get out of the will of God
[1:27:49] stay in his perfect will
[1:27:53] whatever that word says do it that is
[1:27:56] his
[1:27:57] will whatever it
[1:27:59] is and I want to say on the other
[1:28:03] hand anything contrary to that
[1:28:06] word is not his will is that right is
[1:28:12] out of the will of
[1:28:15] God Naomi certainly had it rough when
[1:28:18] she stepped out and
[1:28:20] Sam never finished Samson story remember
[1:28:23] Samson gave it gave it up there he was
[1:28:25] his eyes poked
[1:28:27] out God didn't bless him when he got out
[1:28:30] of God's will I don't know about you but
[1:28:33] it'd be kind of painful have somebody
[1:28:34] take a knife and just gouge your eye out
[1:28:37] and then your other eye and there you
[1:28:39] are blind going around some grinding
[1:28:45] wheel oh my if I had
[1:28:49] just Abode in the place that God had me
[1:28:53] if I have just stayed where God put
[1:29:02] me
[1:29:05] sometimes in life there's I guess three
[1:29:09] major things that I thought of when I
[1:29:11] was thinking about this message three
[1:29:13] major Wills of God that you want to find
[1:29:16] in your
[1:29:17] life first of all to find out whether
[1:29:20] you're son and daughter of God or not
[1:29:22] accept the Lord Jesus Christ and come to
[1:29:24] him come to the will of God that is
[1:29:27] number one that's the greatest will that
[1:29:29] you want God's
[1:29:32] will
[1:29:37] amen can you see how that if you're
[1:29:39] saved tonight can you see can you see
[1:29:41] your name on that
[1:29:45] book can you see your name in the
[1:29:50] Booky if I don't finish my thought I
[1:29:52] never will one of is that the second is
[1:29:56] of course your wife or your husband how
[1:29:58] many believes you want to pray about
[1:30:00] your marriage outside of your your
[1:30:03] salvation that's the most important
[1:30:05] thing and then of course the church you
[1:30:08] go to and where you
[1:30:10] live how many believe you want to be in
[1:30:12] the will of
[1:30:13] God it's
[1:30:15] important CU once you know that and when
[1:30:18] God blesses you in that and establish
[1:30:20] you say hey this is what God wants me to
[1:30:22] do this is where God wants me then oh
[1:30:26] it's not always going to be a flowery
[1:30:27] bed be God never promises but if you're
[1:30:30] in the will of God you are where you're
[1:30:31] supposed to be and if you're stay there
[1:30:34] God will see you through how many beli
[1:30:38] that God will see you through whatever
[1:30:40] troubles that come your way amen but you
[1:30:43] get out of the will of God folks and
[1:30:45] it'll be just just a terrible
[1:30:47] thing amen praise be to God
[1:30:52] having predestinated us unto the
[1:30:54] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:30:56] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:30:59] of his will and he made known to us the
[1:31:03] mystery of his
[1:31:04] will amen how many know he let us know
[1:31:07] that I wrote your name down before the
[1:31:10] foundation of the world if you ever do
[1:31:12] come to God and you are a part of God
[1:31:15] you had to be on that name that list
[1:31:17] before the world ever began you were on
[1:31:21] his will or should I say in his
[1:31:26] will didn't brother R say they all
[1:31:28] predestinated having predestinated us
[1:31:31] according to the purpose of him who
[1:31:33] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:31:36] his will he predestinated you according
[1:31:39] to his
[1:31:42] will don't they to do something for you
[1:31:45] knowing that hey he predestinated you to
[1:31:47] his

[1:31:54] the Holy Ghost it was his will to save
[1:31:58] you the P the permissive will is

[1:45:07] be like a dumb driven cow while Israel
[1:45:09] was kind of that way we as human beings
[1:45:11] tend to be that way we don't do change
[1:45:14] we don't go a lot of times it takes Hard
[1:45:16] Times different things in our
[1:45:18] life bad things that happen in our life
[1:45:21] to push us into the place that God wants
[1:45:24] us to
[1:45:26] be how can I write that or say that
[1:45:29] again it takes bad things in our life to
[1:45:31] dri drive us into the perfect will of
[1:45:34] God a lot of
[1:45:38] times because we're too
[1:45:40] stubborn
[1:45:44] amen
[1:45:46] amen you love him this was my this is
[1:45:50] the capping of it if you abide in me I
[1:45:54] like that we know what happens if you
[1:45:55] don't
[1:45:58] abide did it say you'd be
[1:46:00] blessed no he says you'd be
[1:46:03] withered if a man abide not he is
[1:46:07] withered and what happens with withered
[1:46:09] branches they throw them off into the
[1:46:12] fire what happened with
[1:46:15] Israel of Jude there he says the Angels
[1:46:18] which kept not their first estate and
[1:46:20] gomorah were given over is that right
[1:46:24] those people weren't sodomites at one
[1:46:27] time look at America isn't that
[1:46:30] right I've always said about America how
[1:46:34] great we could have
[1:46:36] been how great we could have stayed if
[1:46:39] we would have Abode in
[1:46:44] God if we wouldn't let them Rascals take
[1:46:48] prayer out of
[1:46:49] school
[1:46:51] Child come home and it was beat half to
[1:46:53] death and I'm telling you what that
[1:46:55] child is was way abused well go ahead
[1:46:57] and Let's Straighten that teacher out
[1:46:59] but don't take the whip
[1:47:01] out
[1:47:03] huh yeah just like our cops like our
[1:47:05] police force yeah there's a lot of them
[1:47:07] do should that things they didn't
[1:47:09] shouldn't do but don't dismiss the
[1:47:11] cotton picking police
[1:47:16] force cotton picking ain't a bad word
[1:47:19] right so I'm okay
[1:47:24] oh my but that's what they do
[1:47:29] Insane think of what it could have been
[1:47:31] in brother Ram what he say what if
[1:47:33] America and every the world would have
[1:47:35] embraced the gift that God gave to
[1:47:38] us my it would have been the Millennium
[1:47:42] God would have just come on down is that
[1:47:44] right God would just come on down and
[1:47:46] said boy them folks I'm human beings I
[1:47:49] am not at all disappointed that I made
[1:47:52] them look how they've received it
[1:47:53] they've changed they're holy they're
[1:47:55] pure amen the world has accepted the
[1:47:57] blood that I shed I me as well come down
[1:48:00] here and change their bodies anden
[1:48:02] create a new world anden and live in the
[1:48:10] Millennium I'm not sure what was it
[1:48:12] brother bam said about Solomon was it a
[1:48:14] millennium was it it was a great time
[1:48:17] for Israel when they accept the gift
[1:48:19] that was in Solomon ain't that
[1:48:22] right it was a great
[1:48:25] time could have been a great for us but
[1:48:29] because how many knows what God did in
[1:48:31] this generation was the will of God how
[1:48:35] many times brother B would
[1:48:36] preach um God's provided way for this
[1:48:40] day this message is God's it's his
[1:48:44] will lean not to your own understanding
[1:48:47] brother bam says you know I believe um
[1:48:51] no it wasn't leaning un to you
[1:48:52] understand it was a message called doing
[1:48:54] God a service without
[1:48:57] it being his
[1:48:59] will
[1:49:01] amen and he My Oh
[1:49:04] My My Own M did y'all read that quote
[1:49:07] where brother bam says all of our
[1:49:08] missionary all of our he says they going
[1:49:10] to
[1:49:12] the prayer to the the the the flag post
[1:49:15] and thousands upon thousands of and
[1:49:17] prayer say pray might as well not to win
[1:49:20] it's out of the will of God
[1:49:21] denominations going on the way they did
[1:49:23] it they're doing God a service without
[1:49:25] being his will because they didn't
[1:49:27] accept what God sent him in the first
[1:49:29] place that's why he had the authority to
[1:49:30] say
[1:49:34] such amen
[1:49:36] wow they didn't accept the will of
[1:49:40] God lord I want to accept the will of

[1:50:49] believe there was ever a cross-eyed
