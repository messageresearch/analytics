[39:42] Warner Brothers and Sisters
[39:45] we'll just stand this morning
[39:50] maybe Brother Brad will open us in
[39:52] prayer this morning
[40:39] and the children can be dismissed for
[40:41] Sunday school and if we'll go into the
[40:42] Psalms
[40:43] we're gonna go to Psalm 69
[40:49] beautiful morning to be in the house of
[40:51] the Lord this morning
[40:53] Psalm 69
[40:55] . we're going to read
[40:59] up to verse 17.
[41:05] Save Me O God for the waters or come in
[41:08] unto my soul
[41:18] I'm weary of my crying my throat is
[41:21] dried my eyes fail while I wait for my
[41:23] God
[41:24] today
[41:38] oh God thou knowest my foolishness and
[41:41] my sins are not hid from thee
[41:56] as for thy sake I have borne reproach
[41:58] Hashem have covered my face
[42:01] all right
[42:07] for the Zeal of Van house hath eaten me
[42:10] up and their approaches of them that
[42:12] reproached thee are Fallen upon me
[42:21] I made sackcloth also my garment and
[42:24] became a proverb to them
[42:33] as for me my prayer is unto thee O Lord
[42:36] in an acceptable time o God in the
[42:39] multitude of thy mercies hear me in the
[42:42] truth of my salvation
[42:46] let's see
[42:53] not the water flood overflowed me
[42:55] neither let the Deep swallow me up and
[42:58] let not the pit shut her mouth upon me
[43:08] this one together and hide not thy face
[43:10] from thy servant for I am in trouble
[43:13] hear me speedily God bless you may be
[43:16] seated brother Brian
[43:28] morning brothers and sisters you know
[43:31] one thing you can take out of that Psalm
[43:33] that you know this is David when he was
[43:36] in afflictions
[43:38] because the Absalon the Sun and because
[43:40] of his own sin the one thing I was
[43:43] striking just out of the one couple of
[43:45] these verses no matter what was
[43:47] happening
[43:49] to David he didn't want his
[43:51] circumstances to affect the other
[43:53] believers around him he didn't want his
[43:56] shame to be causing any stumbling boxer
[43:59] for anyone else around him and
[44:00] everything
[44:01] he put his trust in the Lord
[44:04] you know you have to exercise that Faith
[44:07] yourself this morning and believe that
[44:09] God is more than able
[44:11] not being repetitive and I just lost my
[44:15] place here this morning
[44:23] if you've turned me to Second
[44:24] Corinthians the fourth chapter
[44:29] I thought I added more but
[44:38] as I was listening to some messages this
[44:40] morning
[44:42] reading
[44:44] my Bible I was just thinking
[44:46] we all need like the brother Hall was
[44:49] saying last week we all need to exercise
[44:51] that Sixth Sense we have to exercise
[44:53] that faith that God gives us every day
[44:59] I was also listened in some messages
[45:01] this morning but I'll just read these
[45:03] verses you know one
[45:06] the kind of person I am you know
[45:09] it's not what you what I think or what
[45:11] other people think is what's God's word
[45:13] actually has to say you know men can be
[45:17] wrong everyone can be wrong but God's
[45:19] word will never be wrong you don't ever
[45:21] steer you wrong it'll never lead you
[45:24] down the wrong path it'll always keep
[45:27] you straightly pointed North to your
[45:29] goal at the end and let me read some of
[45:31] these scriptures
[45:33] um that struck me this morning therefore
[45:36] seeing we have this ministry as we have
[45:39] received Mercy we thank God not and
[45:41] that's the hope of every Christian you
[45:44] know it's not what you did or who you
[45:46] are or what you are it's just the mercy
[45:48] of God that you're sitting here this
[45:50] morning makes you no better than the
[45:52] neighbor next to you or the people you
[45:54] live next to it's just God's mercy
[45:58] and I lost my place there second verse
[46:00] here but have renounced the hidden
[46:02] things of dishonesty not walking and
[46:05] crafting this or handling of the word of
[46:07] God deceitfully
[46:09] but by the manifestations of the truth
[46:11] commending ourselves to Every Man's
[46:14] conscience in the sight of God and
[46:15] that's what David was talking about in
[46:18] that Psalm we just read the first 17
[46:20] verses saying the same exact thing and
[46:23] he goes and Paul goes on to say in the
[46:25] third but but if our gospel be hid it
[46:28] decides from them that are lost
[46:31] and to whom the God of this world hath
[46:33] blinded the minds of them which believe
[46:34] not at least the light of the Glorious
[46:37] gospel of Christ who is the image of God
[46:40] should shine onto them you know that's a
[46:43] terrible thing right there but the
[46:45] gospel is not going to be hit from you
[46:47] if you're searching for it and Desiring
[46:49] you know you can I'm sure you all have
[46:52] examples in your life
[46:54] where you can talk to people time and
[46:56] time and time again and they it's it's
[46:59] just like they don't it just doesn't
[47:01] register then it might be that last time
[47:04] you say something to them that the
[47:05] lights come on
[47:06] uh I was writing some other stuff down
[47:09] here this morning I'll just read
[47:12] if I read this I won't get in trouble
[47:13] that's the one thing I learned in life
[47:15] you just take God's word put it before
[47:17] you you just read it and believe it
[47:19] you're most likely not going to get in
[47:21] trouble and he goes on to say here in
[47:24] the fifth verse
[47:25] for we preach not ourselves but Christ
[47:28] Jesus the Lord and ourselves
[47:31] Servants of Jesus say for God who
[47:33] commanded the light to shine out of
[47:35] Darkness I shine in our hearts to give
[47:38] light of the knowledge of the glory of
[47:40] God in the face of Jesus Christ and I
[47:43] was listening to that message on the way
[47:45] here this morning you know everything
[47:47] that God was he put into Christ and
[47:49] everything that Christ was he put into
[47:51] the church and you and its church is not
[47:54] a body or a place we go the church is
[47:57] you the people that are here this
[47:58] morning everything that God loves he and
[48:01] Christ he wants to put into you as an
[48:03] individual this morning if you'll reach
[48:05] out in faith and take it and he goes on
[48:07] to say here
[48:08] but we have this treasure in earthing
[48:11] vessels excellently of the power that
[48:13] may it be of God and not of us
[48:15] we are troubled on every side yet not
[48:18] distress we're perplexed but not in
[48:20] Despair and you know if you look at that
[48:23] scripture there's I was talking about it
[48:25] last
[48:26] last Sunday
[48:28] there shouldn't be any fear they're
[48:30] saying Paul's saying here they were
[48:32] having trouble there were situations in
[48:34] the church and in their lives but they
[48:36] weren't fearful they were just dealing
[48:38] with the situations that they presented
[48:40] themselves to us and I lost my place
[48:43] again
[48:43] persecuted persecuted but not forsaken
[48:46] cast down but not destroyed
[48:48] always bearing about in the body the
[48:51] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[48:53] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[48:57] our body
[48:58] and he goes on to say for for we which
[49:00] live are
[49:02] away delivered unto death nor Jesus said
[49:05] that the life of Jesus might be made
[49:08] manifested in our mortal flesh
[49:10] and I know that's everyone's goal this
[49:13] morning that you that your desires that
[49:15] when people see you this morning they
[49:18] don't see you but they see the god
[49:19] that's inside you Jesus Christ himself
[49:22] and I lost I keep saying this like he I
[49:25] lost my place again my bodies before we
[49:28] live
[49:29] for we which live are are we delivered
[49:32] unto that for Jesus sake the life also
[49:34] that Jesus might be manifested in our
[49:36] mortal flesh so then death work is in us
[49:38] but life in you and we have in the same
[49:41] Spirit of Faith according as it is
[49:43] written I believed and therefore I have
[49:45] spoken we also believe and therefore
[49:47] speak and that's a principle brother
[49:49] random talk you know you just got to
[49:51] speak you know you just got to speak to
[49:53] your circumstances out of the word of
[49:55] God and God will bring about a change in
[49:58] those circumstances knowing that we
[50:00] which were raised up by the Lord Jesus
[50:02] so raise up also by Jesus shall present
[50:06] us with you for all things are for your
[50:09] sakes the abundant grace might through
[50:12] the Thanksgiving of many
[50:14] rebound to the glory of God for which
[50:16] cause we faint not but through our
[50:19] outward man first yet the inward man is
[50:22] renewed day by day
[50:24] as I guess as you get older this
[50:26] scripture should mean more more to you
[50:28] every day of your life for our light
[50:31] affliction
[50:32] which is but for a moment working for us
[50:35] of more exceedingly an eternal weight of
[50:37] Glory while we look not at the things
[50:40] which are seen
[50:42] what are the things which are not seen
[50:44] for the things which are seen or
[50:46] temporal but the things which are not
[50:48] seen are Eternal so the things that
[50:51] Paul's talking about here you could go
[50:53] back to Galatians the fifth chapter and
[50:55] all the things you as a Christian
[50:57] present you know just like brother I'm
[51:00] pretty much done this morning the best
[51:02] way I know how to say it this morning
[51:06] you know
[51:08] what you are on the inside is who you're
[51:10] going to be on the other side and you
[51:12] can't fool yourself this morning I can't
[51:15] fool my own self this morning what you
[51:17] are on the inside is when you die is who
[51:19] you're going to be on the other side and
[51:21] that's a sobering thought to us each
[51:24] whether you're young middle age old
[51:26] that's a very serious thought you want
[51:29] to be on the inside what you're
[51:31] reflecting on the outside you know that
[51:33] God doesn't want any hypocrisy you know
[51:36] you know you don't want to you don't
[51:38] want to go for life being one thing on
[51:41] the outside and being something
[51:42] different on the inside it gets gets
[51:45] kind of older after a while trying to
[51:46] have to manufacture something but if you
[51:49] just stay still long enough that God Can
[51:51] Make You In His Image
[51:53] it won't be manufactured anymore or be
[51:55] God doing it for you brother Josh
[52:09] [Applause]
[52:13] thank you
[52:15] I think that song number 630 standing in
[52:18] the need of prayer

[1:23:30] amen and amen
[1:23:33] praise the Lord
[1:23:34] if you will turn to First John the
[1:23:37] fourth chapter first John 4.
[1:23:40] amen
[1:23:46] we spoke on Grace Wednesday night Grace
[1:23:49] the grace of almighty God Amen and we
[1:23:53] realize how amazing grace really is
[1:23:56] because of the millions of people that
[1:23:58] God could have chose besides you but he
[1:24:01] didn't he chose you amen and just to be
[1:24:03] one of God's children is the greatest
[1:24:05] honor that we could have Amen to know
[1:24:07] that you are a child of God and know
[1:24:11] what Grace really is and who Grace
[1:24:13] really is amen amen so we're very
[1:24:16] thankful for that amen and let me just
[1:24:19] read here uh the first John 4 we'll go
[1:24:24] with seven
[1:24:25] on down to
[1:24:28] 12 and then we'll stop
[1:24:30] beloved let us love one another for love
[1:24:33] is of God and everyone that loveth is
[1:24:35] born of God and knoweth God but he that
[1:24:37] loveth not knoweth not God for God is
[1:24:40] love in this was manifested the love of
[1:24:42] God towards us because if God sent his
[1:24:45] only begotten
[1:24:46] son into the world that he might live
[1:24:49] through him herein is love not that we
[1:24:52] love God but that he loved us and sent
[1:24:55] his son to be the propitiation for our
[1:24:58] sins beloved if God so loved us we also
[1:25:03] ought to love one another amen
[1:25:06] I believe it comes to my mind a
[1:25:09] scripture that talks about if there's
[1:25:10] any that has a quarrel against any it's
[1:25:13] as even as Christ forgave you forgive
[1:25:15] them also amen
[1:25:17] so how many believes we got to have the
[1:25:18] same love and the same forgiveness that
[1:25:20] God had
[1:25:21] no man has seen God at a time if we love
[1:25:24] one another God dwelleth in us and his
[1:25:26] love is perfected in us may God have
[1:25:29] bless the reading of the word you can be
[1:25:32] seated let me just read a quote or two
[1:25:34] if I may amen and then I'll give you my
[1:25:36] title brother bam talking about Grace
[1:25:39] and The Marvelous and what Grace is
[1:25:41] really all about he's talking about the
[1:25:43] sovereignty of Grace and he pulls it
[1:25:45] over into and talks about what we want
[1:25:47] to talk about in the next quote he can
[1:25:50] save a rich like me and he did what is
[1:25:53] it Grace William Branham a drunkard son
[1:25:55] I mean he knows that his dad ran a
[1:25:58] Distillery a whiskey Distillery and so
[1:26:00] forth he was just a drunkard son and
[1:26:02] that don't make any difference the grace
[1:26:04] of God save me me I'm a woman I'm the
[1:26:07] woman's daughter that was no good don't
[1:26:09] make any difference God's grace saved
[1:26:11] you it's Sovereign it don't have to ask
[1:26:14] nobody
[1:26:15] amen I'm so glad for that it can take
[1:26:18] the vilest man and make him white as
[1:26:20] snow don't have to ask nobody listen
[1:26:22] quickly he says it was proved that the
[1:26:24] cross when new when the Bible sinner
[1:26:26] Violet Thief amen he deserved to die God
[1:26:30] had never come across his mind he never
[1:26:32] thought nothing of it then on the cross
[1:26:35] though through those bloody lips between
[1:26:37] the groans there came a sound Lord have
[1:26:41] mercy on me
[1:26:43] amen another place remember he says when
[1:26:46] thou cometh to Paradise remember me and
[1:26:48] there came another one back through the
[1:26:50] blood and the tears and the agony Grace
[1:26:53] took a hold and it says today Thou shalt
[1:26:56] be with me
[1:26:57] in Paradise
[1:26:59] amen I may know it's Grace that's what
[1:27:02] it wants amen pardons who he wants Grace
[1:27:06] did that the grace couldn't he'll help
[1:27:08] himself and so forth no more and you can
[1:27:09] help yourself we couldn't do nothing
[1:27:11] about it but the grace of God could do
[1:27:13] something about it amen
[1:27:15] the sovereignty of the grace of God of
[1:27:17] to that dying Thief Thou shalt be with
[1:27:20] me in Paradise think of it that's
[1:27:21] wonderful now think of it
[1:27:24] amen love and grace is sisters twin
[1:27:27] sisters amen this morning we was sitting
[1:27:31] at our little bar our breakfast bar and
[1:27:33] my Elena she was sitting there eating
[1:27:35] her breakfast and I was there with my
[1:27:37] book pads just writing things down they
[1:27:39] always ask Grandpa what are you what are

[1:28:13] they're twin sisters you can't have
[1:28:16] Grace without having love
[1:28:18] praise the lord they're twin sisters
[1:28:20] that's exactly right Amen in another
[1:28:22] place it talks about we realize that
[1:28:25] Grace is actually a product
[1:28:28] or something that is produced because of
[1:28:31] love
[1:28:32] now we want to talk about God's love
[1:28:34] this morning is that okay
[1:28:36] amen
[1:28:38] my my my once again we talk about
[1:28:40] something that
[1:28:42] um
[1:28:43] amen that really tongue can't really
[1:28:46] even express it
[1:28:48] amen I believe it was said and uh uh the
[1:28:52] love of God song he says could we with
[1:28:54] ink the ocean feel
[1:28:56] and one of the Skies of parchment made
[1:28:59] in other words Writing Tablet or
[1:29:01] whatever where every stock on earth a
[1:29:04] quill and every man ascribed by trade
[1:29:08] amen a writer to write the love of God
[1:29:11] above would drain the ocean dry
[1:29:15] nor could the scroll contain the whole
[1:29:17] those stretch from Sky to Sky
[1:29:21] hallelujah oh love of God how rich and
[1:29:23] pure how measureless and strong it shall
[1:29:27] forever more endure the Saints and
[1:29:30] Angels saw
[1:29:32] amen
[1:29:33] so we want to talk with the help of the
[1:29:35] Lord about the love of God
[1:29:37] amen God bless you brother Parish good
[1:29:39] to have you and your wife this morning
[1:29:40] with us amen may God protect you amen
[1:29:44] amen how many glad the covets just kind
[1:29:46] of seems to be amen by the wayside
[1:29:49] president said the pandemic's over so I
[1:29:51] guess it's over right
[1:29:53] amen praise the Lord so let's talk about
[1:29:56] this this is something that God demands
[1:29:59] of is something that no doubt you and I
[1:30:01] need more of
[1:30:03] amen first of all we realize that he
[1:30:06] says that God is love now when we talk
[1:30:08] about God being loved God is a whole lot
[1:30:11] more than just love but the actual true
[1:30:14] essence of the real genuine love and
[1:30:16] where it comes from it is actually what
[1:30:19] God is God is love
[1:30:23] praise be to God we want to look with
[1:30:25] the help of the Lord what God what the
[1:30:27] what that love does because you realize
[1:30:29] that everything everything God has ever
[1:30:32] done
[1:30:33] was because of love
[1:30:35] amen
[1:30:37] everything he does is because of love
[1:30:39] amen verse 16 of chapter 4 it says and
[1:30:42] we have known and believed the love that
[1:30:45] God has for us God is love and he that
[1:30:48] dwelleth in love do I lift in God and
[1:30:52] God in him in other words you can't be
[1:30:54] in God unless you've got love in your
[1:30:57] heart
[1:31:00] amen
[1:31:03] all right now down in verse 18 says
[1:31:06] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:31:08] love casts out fear because fear hath
[1:31:12] torment he that feareth is not made
[1:31:14] perfect in love we love him because
[1:31:17] he first loved us I mean those that's a
[1:31:21] very famous I love him I love him I love
[1:31:24] him because he first loved me
[1:31:27] he first loved us we were uh boy we were
[1:31:31] just like that we saw her we wrote about
[1:31:33] the one that actually killed him
[1:31:35] worthless no good fit to die and God
[1:31:39] went and chose that prisoner the one
[1:31:40] that killed his own son and says I'm
[1:31:42] adopting you imma let you my son
[1:31:45] he says that was what you was that's
[1:31:48] what I was and that's because the love
[1:31:50] that that man had that's nothing but
[1:31:52] love
[1:31:53] all right
[1:31:55] If any man say I love God and hated this
[1:31:57] brother he is alive for he let loveth
[1:31:59] not his brother whom he has seen how can
[1:32:01] he love God who he has not seen amen
[1:32:05] let's talk about first little love for
[1:32:07] just a little bit we realize that the
[1:32:08] whole creation everything that was made
[1:32:10] all of the world that was made was what
[1:32:14] made with an idea it was made for a
[1:32:17] purpose right
[1:32:19] amen and that purpose was
[1:32:22] you and I
[1:32:24] that was for those who were going to be
[1:32:26] with him when it's all over with when
[1:32:28] it's all said enough
[1:32:30] amen
[1:32:32] and one of the first places that God
[1:32:34] ever displayed his love of course we
[1:32:36] realized it was Adam and Eve and making
[1:32:38] a way for him and not destroying them
[1:32:40] when they deserve to die
[1:32:42] is that right they deserved the die but
[1:32:45] he made a way for him and he gave him a
[1:32:47] substitute so forth and then on down a
[1:32:49] little bit later we found that all of
[1:32:51] humanity all of humanity had gotten so
[1:32:54] wicked until the constant imagination of
[1:32:57] his mind was evil continuously he had
[1:33:01] mingled the sons of God mingled with the
[1:33:03] daughters of man and man there was all
[1:33:05] kinds of marriage and giving in marriage
[1:33:07] and all this stuff that was going on it
[1:33:09] was so wicked until it repented God that
[1:33:11] he ever made man
[1:33:13] and he says I will destroy a man whom I
[1:33:16] have made it repent of God to happen can
[1:33:18] you imagine God's feeling on Humanity
[1:33:22] and I truly believe tonight that his
[1:33:24] feeling has come back again about to the
[1:33:26] same place that it Grieves God that he
[1:33:29] made Humanity
[1:33:30] because look at look at the ones that he
[1:33:32] very ones that he created made he
[1:33:35] throwed him out
[1:33:38] Sorry by the schools they don't want no
[1:33:40] part of him nowhere they don't want no
[1:33:42] ten command they want nothing of God
[1:33:45] and then they're throwing him out and
[1:33:47] not only did they throw him out but the
[1:33:49] church World threw him out also
[1:33:52] huh
[1:33:54] that's exactly right you know the Bible
[1:33:57] talks about he says because they
[1:33:58] received not the love of the truth
[1:34:04] oh my listen to this in in second
[1:34:06] Thessalonians 2 I'm going to read uh
[1:34:08] read this
[1:34:09] he says for this cause
[1:34:12] God shall send them strong delusions
[1:34:15] that they might believe a lie
[1:34:17] then I jump up to the scripture just
[1:34:20] before that
[1:34:21] and read about half of that scripture it
[1:34:24] says because they received not the love
[1:34:27] of the truth that they should believe
[1:34:30] amen that this might be saved and for
[1:34:33] this cause God send them strong
[1:34:35] illusions that they actually should
[1:34:36] believe a lot notice how that God sends
[1:34:40] people strong delusions because they
[1:34:42] received not the love of the truth it's
[1:34:45] just not the love of the truth they
[1:34:47] don't love the truth
[1:34:50] they don't love what God has brought
[1:34:52] them
[1:34:53] I mean those the problem is not with God
[1:34:57] loving
[1:34:58] it is not a problem with God caring this
[1:35:02] morning it's God oh my when you think
[1:35:05] about it when you think about the whole
[1:35:08] now I'm going to just jump around here a
[1:35:10] little bit
[1:35:11] when you think about the scope of God's
[1:35:13] love was expressed the very very how he
[1:35:16] really expressed it
[1:35:19] uh and I believe it was their in the
[1:35:20] scriptures because uh uh let me see here
[1:35:26] oh wow
[1:35:28] he loved us but we love him because he
[1:35:31] first loved us mine listen here now well
[1:35:34] I wish I here it is here it is verse 9.
[1:35:37] and this was manifested the love of God
[1:35:40] towards us because that God sent his
[1:35:43] only begotten son into the world that we
[1:35:46] might have lived so that was the
[1:35:48] manifestation of God's love
[1:35:51] to the whole world for God to love the
[1:35:53] whole world that he gave his only Beyond
[1:35:54] us begotten son that whosoever would
[1:35:57] believe in him should not have heard
[1:35:59] that's what he did now I mean us
[1:36:01] whenever he put his hands out like that
[1:36:03] he says it is finished
[1:36:05] that's all he could do he loved the
[1:36:07] world that much until he gave his only
[1:36:09] he gave his life but the man piped it
[1:36:11] with that uh Arnold band uh Winkle read
[1:36:14] I believe it was Von wrinkle went over
[1:36:16] there in Switzerland that said one day
[1:36:18] when the armies were all around him and
[1:36:20] so forth amen and he said he kissed his
[1:36:22] mom and his wife and the kids goodbye
[1:36:24] said I'm gonna die for Switzerland today
[1:36:26] amen he says he went out there and he
[1:36:28] says I died today for switching Give me
[1:36:30] liberty he's talking about Liberty and
[1:36:33] he ran with his arms open and ran right
[1:36:35] into a bunch of them Spears and that's
[1:36:37] about him explained that they had walls
[1:36:39] they were a trained army they were like
[1:36:42] the Romans just totally strong but
[1:36:44] because of that act of hero heroism
[1:36:48] it rather than everybody picked up axes
[1:36:51] they'd pick up whatever they couldn't
[1:36:52] they rather than Anthony because that
[1:36:55] man and the love that he had for his
[1:36:57] family in his home
[1:36:58] and they're the same way with Christ God
[1:37:00] he didn't have to how many knows Jesus
[1:37:02] didn't he said no man takes my life from
[1:37:05] me
[1:37:07] I lay it down I'm at least he laid it
[1:37:10] down
[1:37:11] [Applause]
[1:37:13] hey man she started his arms and he died
[1:37:16] and he gave his life
[1:37:18] for you and me and he expressed
[1:37:20] his love for us
[1:37:22] now it's our turn
[1:37:25] it's the world turned I mean he's
[1:37:27] waiting to see how we'll love back
[1:37:30] praise be to God but it's all because of
[1:37:32] love
[1:37:33] all done because of love the love of God
[1:37:37] now notice
[1:37:41] the man talked about he was
[1:37:44] um I believe he's talking about that
[1:37:47] woman that had given
[1:37:50] yes he was talking about that mother
[1:37:53] that had actually ran into that fire
[1:37:55] because her love for her baby y'all
[1:37:56] remember the story
[1:37:58] she loved her little baby she was
[1:37:59] upstairs and the house was on fire and
[1:38:01] the firemen wouldn't even go in but she
[1:38:03] wrapped herself in the blanket ran
[1:38:04] upstairs and grabbed that baby come back
[1:38:06] out and took what she protected herself
[1:38:08] with and wrapped that baby around that
[1:38:11] and he went down through those flames
[1:38:12] and just got totally disfigured
[1:38:15] and years later that girl coming home
[1:38:17] from college was ashamed of her mom
[1:38:20] and the train conductor grabbed a hold
[1:38:22] of her arms let me tell you the story
[1:38:24] and he told the little girl the story of
[1:38:26] how moms love because of that love that
[1:38:28] she had
[1:38:30] ran through the Flames he says don't you
[1:38:32] ever be ashamed don't you ever be
[1:38:35] ashamed of of what she did she was a lot
[1:38:37] prettier than you at one time amen
[1:38:40] and that's what Christ did for us and
[1:38:42] now notice what he'll say here but he
[1:38:44] says now Divine love is one of the most
[1:38:47] powerful forces it's one of the greatest
[1:38:49] forces there is in the world when Divine
[1:38:51] love has been projected now notice when
[1:38:53] Divine love has been projected and comes
[1:38:56] to its end then Sovereign Grace will
[1:38:59] take its place
[1:39:02] how many wants to see just how great
[1:39:04] love really is
[1:39:06] and I've got some statements here at the
[1:39:08] end that I want to make with the help of
[1:39:09] the Lord
[1:39:10] but in First Corinthians 13 chapter
[1:39:13] which we're all very familiar with but I
[1:39:15] want to read it would that be all right
[1:39:17] because Paul he talks about gifts and
[1:39:19] having teachers and the Miracles and and
[1:39:22] Gifts of healing helps and governments
[1:39:24] and all these things but in Chapter 13
[1:39:26] He says Paul says it this way though I
[1:39:28] speak with tongues of men and angels and
[1:39:31] have not charity I am become as a
[1:39:34] sounding brass or a tingling symbol all
[1:39:38] right Paul says you got to have this
[1:39:40] above everything else
[1:39:42] and they'll have the gift of Prophecy
[1:39:44] and understand all Mysteries and all
[1:39:46] knowledge
[1:39:47] amen real smart and I understand all the
[1:39:51] Mysteries not even though you know all
[1:39:52] of that and have all Faith so that I
[1:39:55] could move mountains if I have not
[1:39:57] charity I am zero
[1:40:01] I hear nothing without it
[1:40:06] how many have you got to have
[1:40:08] it's got to be in your heart
[1:40:11] and though I bestow all my goods to feed
[1:40:14] the poor and though I give my body to be
[1:40:16] burnt how many knows Hollywood actors
[1:40:18] and all of these people that are wicked
[1:40:20] do all kinds of good things for food
[1:40:23] banks and all these things that they do
[1:40:26] huh that don't mean they're saved
[1:40:29] people do all kinds of things people
[1:40:31] actually burn their bodies they'll
[1:40:33] actually burn themselves set themselves
[1:40:35] on fire I read the other day where
[1:40:37] somebody put you know they didn't have
[1:40:40] the nerve I guess they burn their whole
[1:40:41] body they just burned their arms
[1:40:43] it burned their arm for certain cause
[1:40:47] my people get people very enthusiastic
[1:40:50] but Paul here said you can give your
[1:40:52] body to be burned if you ain't got the
[1:40:54] love of God in your heart it doesn't it
[1:40:56] it's gonna get a benefit tonight
[1:40:59] you've got to have profit of me
[1:41:02] not a little bit nothing Paul says
[1:41:05] absolutely nothing
[1:41:07] charity suffereth long now the reason I
[1:41:11] went back to this is because Paul I mean
[1:41:13] but the man talks about how that went
[1:41:14] love when Divine love comes to its end
[1:41:19] in other words it does all it can do
[1:41:23] that's what Jesus did when he comes hung
[1:41:27] on the cross he said it is finished
[1:41:30] all he could do he did everything he
[1:41:32] could and come to its end
[1:41:36] amen
[1:41:39] now notice I'm gonna read the quote
[1:41:40] again before I read the rest of this
[1:41:41] project when Divine love is protected it
[1:41:44] comes to his end till he can't go no
[1:41:45] more than Sovereign Grace will take and
[1:41:49] come in from there and take its place
[1:41:53] God
[1:41:55] I thought about Christ but what are you
[1:41:57] talking about mother Bob are you talking
[1:41:58] about Christ what enemy and that love
[1:42:01] came to an end that's all he could do he
[1:42:03] couldn't do no more we all know that
[1:42:06] isn't that right how many times I've
[1:42:08] taught Christ can't do a thing more for
[1:42:10] you if he was standing here in his suit
[1:42:12] isn't that right so he's done all that
[1:42:15] he can do
[1:42:18] but then what happens
[1:42:21] Grace steps in
[1:42:23] gray steps in and he begins to woo with
[1:42:27] the Holy Spirit by the preaching of the
[1:42:29] Gospel by telling you what Christ did on
[1:42:32] Calvary and you believing it that Grace
[1:42:34] takes over and doesn't work for you and
[1:42:37] you're never the same again
[1:42:39] touching Jesus is all that really
[1:42:42] matters and uh and your life will never
[1:42:44] be the same again
[1:42:46] Sovereign Grace has taken over and it's
[1:42:49] gonna produce him a party
[1:42:51] recovery name that is on that book it's
[1:42:53] gonna bring them back
[1:42:55] Grace will do that
[1:42:58] how many is glad to be a product of
[1:43:00] Grace how many
[1:43:02] the product of Grace
[1:43:04] the love of God produced the grace of
[1:43:07] God It produced forgiveness
[1:43:09] whoa
[1:43:11] how many knows my thought this morning
[1:43:13] is that God wants you to share his love
[1:43:16] he wants you to share his grace he wants
[1:43:19] you to share his Mercy
[1:43:22] huh share it
[1:43:25] well how do I shut brother bahler Jesus
[1:43:28] says if you do not from your heart
[1:43:30] forgive every man that trespasses
[1:43:32] neither will your heavenly father
[1:43:33] forgive you of your trespasses
[1:43:37] that's how you share the grace oh my
[1:43:40] Peter was said how much grace am I going
[1:43:42] to have for my brother for seven times
[1:43:44] in a day Jesus says no sir seven times
[1:43:47] seven 490 times a day you're gonna have
[1:43:51] to have Grace
[1:43:52] you're gonna have to share this Grace
[1:43:54] how many places we gotta share this love
[1:43:56] that God has expressed that God has shed
[1:43:58] abroad but his love
[1:44:02] folks it isn't just that bodies up there
[1:44:04] with the love of God and all the godla
[1:44:06] very very love of God the various
[1:44:07] essence of the love of God is in your
[1:44:10] heart
[1:44:12] how many knows we are the Temple of the
[1:44:15] Holy Ghost you are the Temple of Christ
[1:44:17] he became me so that you could become
[1:44:20] him how is he doing
[1:44:23] how is that going this morning church
[1:44:27] he became
[1:44:29] so I might become him shape Express his
[1:44:32] love to me so I can express it to other
[1:44:35] people
[1:44:36] if you can't express it to your brother
[1:44:38] your sister
[1:44:40] you're a liar
[1:44:44] John says you say you love God and you
[1:44:45] hate your brother you hate somebody
[1:44:48] nah
[1:44:49] you ain't got God's love
[1:44:51] I don't care how ugly they are I don't
[1:44:53] care if they take you out here in the
[1:44:55] tree and hang you
[1:45:01] I'm hearing a mouse squeak here folks
[1:45:04] that's right cause they went out there
[1:45:06] and they stoned Stephen

[1:45:10] it to their charge father he didn't want
[1:45:12] Noah animation he had nothing there
[1:45:18] let me tell you something Jesus what
[1:45:20] you're gonna have to have if you expect
[1:45:21] to go in the Rapture you can't have no
[1:45:24] bitterness you can't have no hatred you
[1:45:26] can't have no malice it's got to be pure
[1:45:29] right
[1:45:39] oh my
[1:45:42] God
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:46] this comes to mind
[1:45:48] my brother-in-law David
[1:45:51] Browning
[1:45:52] Church in Sarasota there's people that
[1:45:54] left
[1:45:56] and something happened I think between
[1:45:59] Danny and so forth
[1:46:01] I don't mind this going on the internet
[1:46:03] because I wanted to hear what I got to
[1:46:04] say
[1:46:06] but I think it was David
[1:46:08] says you know you've even if he did do
[1:46:10] something like that you got to forgive
[1:46:11] him and the man says oh
[1:46:17] right he got oh man no I don't
[1:46:22] now was he right
[1:46:24] he was wrong wasn't he
[1:46:26] that's why he's out of church that's why
[1:46:28] he's backslinters all over because he
[1:46:31] didn't forgive
[1:46:34] huh how about you and I here in this
[1:46:36] church I'm we wouldn't be sitting here
[1:46:38] if there's somebody who wouldn't forgive
[1:46:39] perhaps the church I'm like you got to
[1:46:41] forgive
[1:46:42] because God forgave us even as Christ
[1:46:44] has forgiven us amen we got to forgive
[1:46:47] every man that trespasses it don't
[1:46:49] matter what they do even Jesus
[1:46:51] does anybody said everything
[1:46:57] Freddie don't know what they do
[1:47:03] Glory
[1:47:04] that's where you and I are gonna come in
[1:47:07] oh my look at look at Philippians look
[1:47:10] at first and second Thessalonians and
[1:47:12] and first and second Timothy Paul is
[1:47:14] always addressing them and then may the
[1:47:16] God bring of you peace and grace and
[1:47:18] mercy peace and grace and mercy peace
[1:47:21] and grace and mercy be multiplied to you
[1:47:23] how many Grace multiplies Hallelujah
[1:47:27] Lord multiply Grace I need your grace I
[1:47:30] don't need your Justice I need your
[1:47:31] peace and I need your love I
[1:47:36] in my life
[1:47:39] oh if I don't get nothing else across to
[1:47:42] it remember this he became you so you
[1:47:45] could become him are you him
[1:47:50] the preeminist in your life
[1:47:53] everything you do every thought you
[1:47:55] think everything you say isn't Christ
[1:47:57] expressing or not
[1:48:02] huh
[1:48:04] how many has Room to Grow I know I'll
[1:48:06] get hands for that
[1:48:08] uh-huh
[1:48:11] think about it
[1:48:14] he expressed it
[1:48:16] that Grace came out of that love
[1:48:18] until he put a declaration made a
[1:48:21] declaration that whosoever believeth in
[1:48:23] him should not perish
[1:48:25] what a wonderful Lord whosoever
[1:48:29] he's not willing that any patient perish
[1:48:31] as I started out in the days of Noah and
[1:48:33] the way that they had gotten
[1:48:35] gave him 120 years to retain
[1:48:41] that's a lot of patience that's long
[1:48:43] suffering
[1:48:45] how many knows that this says charity
[1:48:47] suffers long
[1:48:49] as long-suffering it's not short like we
[1:48:52] get sometimes
[1:48:54] oh how many knows when we get to him we
[1:48:56] can be so short just those little things
[1:48:58] man we're all you know off the handle
[1:49:02] got to be long suffering and patient
[1:49:04] that's what love is
[1:49:07] and the Bible says Love Never Fails
[1:49:10] whether it's knowledge whether it's
[1:49:12] prophecy whether it's tongue fish or all
[1:49:14] fail they'll all see but the one thing
[1:49:16] never goes wrong and that's the love of
[1:49:19] God
[1:49:20] yeah
[1:49:22] because even when you come to the end
[1:49:24] like Daniel did how many knows Daniel he
[1:49:26] loved God and he didn't care what they
[1:49:28] was going to do to him he prayed to God
[1:49:30] three times a day amen they went out
[1:49:32] there and they were gonna throw him in
[1:49:33] the lines and over the wall he went
[1:49:37] he loved as much as he could and it
[1:49:39] hadn't met this in now I'm in the grace
[1:49:41] of God how many knows when he went down
[1:49:43] over the wall Grace kicked in
[1:49:45] Grace kicked in
[1:49:47] it would look up would have looked like
[1:49:49] it man it fell to eat with children
[1:49:51] right they love God so much we are not
[1:49:54] careful of how we answer you we're
[1:49:56] nothing about because we love God
[1:50:00] oh let's get
[1:50:02] it foreign
[1:50:22] come on that ain't near enough of an
[1:50:24] amen
[1:50:25] [Applause]
[1:50:26] isn't that right we should all say amen
[1:50:28] that's what the Bible said no but I say
[1:50:31] not my idea is what the Bible says
[1:50:34] [Music]
[1:50:37] Jesus said if you love me keep my
[1:50:38] Commandments
[1:50:44] amen
[1:50:46] praise the Lord
[1:50:49] and
[1:50:50] he also says a new commandment I give
[1:50:52] unto you that you love one another
[1:50:55] as I have loved you that you also love
[1:50:59] one another
[1:51:01] how many believe we as children of God
[1:51:02] we ought to love each other we hear this
[1:51:05] church ought to love one another more
[1:51:07] than you love almost your whole even
[1:51:08] your family member
[1:51:12] because if your family member ain't in
[1:51:13] Christ here probably just a little bit
[1:51:15] me
[1:51:16] they're a bit of contrary to you
[1:51:18] gotta love them and do love them
[1:51:20] but that brother and that sister that
[1:51:22] loves you back
[1:51:24] what does it say be good but especially
[1:51:27] to the household of faith not saying
[1:51:28] that you got to love them more or less
[1:51:30] hello but it's just special to have a
[1:51:32] brother and a sister that loves you and
[1:51:34] that you love and I believe we had
[1:51:35] evening night Tabernacle I believe for
[1:51:37] myself I need to love you more Brother
[1:51:39] Brad
[1:51:41] we need to love each other more
[1:51:44] everywhere you find it I'll love one
[1:51:46] another love one another children love
[1:51:48] one another
[1:51:49] because the devil wants you to hate one
[1:51:51] another
[1:51:53] Jesus never said that you know that you
[1:51:56] ought to bite and devour one another
[1:51:58] don't talk bad about each other don't
[1:52:00] tear each other down
[1:52:02] huh Paul said if you bite and devour one
[1:52:05] another be careful somebody might shoot
[1:52:07] somebody
[1:52:09] be careful that you'd be not consumed of
[1:52:11] each other
[1:52:12] to me that's what that means killing
[1:52:15] huh
[1:52:17] when you're fighting and fighting that's
[1:52:21] the devil in a church
[1:52:23] huh
[1:52:25] you talk about the love of God you know
[1:52:27] how many of the long suffering of God
[1:52:29] but Israel out of Egypt
[1:52:31] he loved them
[1:52:33] he brought them out
[1:52:35] and basically all God asked for is
[1:52:37] believe me and don't complain
[1:52:41] right
[1:52:43] believe me and don't complain
[1:52:46] complain I don't care if you come up
[1:52:48] against the Red Sea and you can't get
[1:52:49] around something can't get over it can't
[1:52:51] get around and you're in a box
[1:52:53] in a heart between a rock and a hard
[1:52:55] place God of fighting God
[1:52:58] anyway
[1:53:00] if you can't Praise Him for your present
[1:53:02] situation praise him for what he has
[1:53:05] done for you
[1:53:06] amen and he'll take care of your present
[1:53:08] situation
[1:53:11] look at where he brought you from
[1:53:14] this is where I get just a little
[1:53:16] excited because I'm telling you when I
[1:53:18] look down my path and I see everything
[1:53:20] in God has done for me I am he is worthy
[1:53:23] of praise and honor and worship
[1:53:27] I realize he has not be safe thus far
[1:53:29] and it's gonna be grace that takes me
[1:53:31] safely home it's gonna be Grace better
[1:53:34] and we're going to walk in that new body
[1:53:36] and then we're going to shout at him
[1:53:38] we're gonna lock the streets of gold but
[1:53:41] we're gonna worship Him
[1:53:43] cause he's starting to work he's gonna
[1:53:45] be able to finish it
[1:53:50] all because he loves you
[1:53:52] he loved you
[1:53:54] that made the difference
[1:53:56] you're the love The Sinner
[1:53:58] you're the love those that are mean to
[1:54:00] you
[1:54:01] and persecute you

[1:54:11] not like they said it has been said Thou
[1:54:13] shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine
[1:54:15] enemy
[1:54:16] but I say unto you love your enemies
[1:54:21] love your enemies bless them that curse
[1:54:24] you
[1:54:25] do good to them that hate you
[1:54:28] and pray for them that despitefully use
[1:54:31] you and persecute you
[1:54:34] that you might be my children
[1:54:37] so that you can be like I was

[1:54:41] that's uncorrected Jesus had corrected
[1:54:44] love he told people when they were wrong
[1:54:46] and that's why they hated him so bad

[1:59:00] Ephesians 4 says
[1:59:01] that God gave some Apostles and Prophets
[1:59:04] and evangelists and pastors and teachers
[1:59:07] for the imperfecting of the Saints
[1:59:10] now for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:59:14] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:59:16] edifying of the body of Christ till we
[1:59:19] all come in the unity of the faith and
[1:59:21] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[1:59:23] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:59:26] stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:59:32] how many desires for that to be new
[1:59:37] everybody here listen
[1:59:38] do you desire this morning
[1:59:41] to come
[1:59:43] to the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:59:48] let me put simple terms that means
[1:59:51] letting God in every door of your heart
[1:59:55] every part of your life
[1:59:57] Jesus has to have control or you're not
[1:59:59] in the foods
[2:00:05] how many is not there and needs it be
[2:00:08] honest now this is kind of tricky but
[2:00:10] not there but needed
[2:00:12] that's right
[2:00:14] that's what I'm up here for
[2:00:17] that's my job is to challenge you
[2:00:20] to see whether you're where you ought to
[2:00:21] be
[2:00:22] and to give you the opportunity to get a
[2:00:24] little closer to Christ
[2:00:26] that moral cars come into your heart
[2:00:31] Jesus it's the sweetest name I know
[2:00:34] amen
[2:00:35] that you be henceforth no more children
[2:00:39] tossed to and fro carried about with
[2:00:40] everyone the doctor by the slide them in
[2:00:42] and by the cunning craftiness whereby
[2:00:44] they lie in wait to disease amen
[2:00:50] back to other scripture
[2:00:52] that despitefully use you and persecute
[2:00:55] you that ye may be the children of your
[2:00:57] father which is in heaven for he makes
[2:01:00] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[2:01:03] good and send us Reign on the just and
[2:01:06] the unjust
[2:01:08] for if you love them which love you what
[2:01:10] reward have you do not even the public
[2:01:13] is the same if you sleep only your
[2:01:15] brothers only in other words if you only
[2:01:16] love the Brotherhood and not those out
[2:01:18] there
[2:01:19] huh
[2:01:21] you're no different than as I always say
[2:01:23] the Harley games
[2:01:26] don't mess with the heart Harley dude
[2:01:28] especially Hell's Angels right
[2:01:31] even cops don't like to mess with them
[2:01:34] huh because you're daily they stick up
[2:01:36] for each other
[2:01:37] huh
[2:01:39] what was it but bam said why do people
[2:01:41] become gangsters because your mom didn't
[2:01:43] give him love Dad didn't give him love
[2:01:46] those gangs give him love so they joined
[2:01:49] the gangs to get a little love
[2:01:51] we ain't got to go to gangsters
[2:01:54] just come to Christ
[2:01:55] if you want to load the love of Christ
[2:01:58] and if you salute your brother and only
[2:02:00] what do you more than others do not even
[2:02:02] publicans the same
[2:02:04] Hallelujah no notice he says be ye
[2:02:08] therefore perfect even as your father
[2:02:10] which is in heaven is perfect is not
[2:02:13] Christ identifying perfection in love
[2:02:18] that was a question
[2:02:20] now I want to say yes I believe it is
[2:02:23] don't you
[2:02:26] Christ identified love as being perfect
[2:02:29] that if you are perfect in love
[2:02:31] amen
[2:02:34] charity suffered long and His Kind
[2:02:36] charity envious not charity vaunted not
[2:02:39] itself it's not walked around

[2:03:36] out for each other

[2:05:49] be governed by how people do
[2:05:54] no sir
[2:05:56] listen to this this just comes to me do
[2:05:58] you realize being a son or a daughter of
[2:06:00] God that you're a minor Creator do you
[2:06:03] know that you create the atmosphere that
[2:06:05] you live in do you realize that the
[2:06:07] atmosphere that you dwell in you
[2:06:09] influence somebody else
[2:06:14] we're not to be influenced by the world
[2:06:16] you're not to be influenced by somebody
[2:06:18] out there
[2:06:20] uh you influenced them
[2:06:24] not them you
[2:06:27] boy you'll be in a bad shape if you let
[2:06:29] the world and those people influence you
[2:06:30] they'll take you the wrong direction
[2:06:33] amen all kinds of men the Son and
[2:06:36] Daughter of God you're the one that's
[2:06:37] influenced
[2:06:39] what makes people like do anything to do
[2:06:40] how many knows a lot of times but so
[2:06:42] many times people react to our action
[2:06:45] don't they
[2:06:46] when you get up and you say howdy to
[2:06:48] somebody how are you doing they might
[2:06:50] just say hi back
[2:06:52] hey me and my wife yo we go waving at
[2:06:54] people all the time some of them waving
[2:06:56] others won't and she's just that one
[2:06:58] didn't wave
[2:07:01] that one didn't wave well guess what one
[2:07:03] time I didn't wave
[2:07:07] and I said I was looking at my phone or
[2:07:09] something I was I I didn't realize wait
[2:07:11] I'm not mean uh I was just not paying
[2:07:14] attention
[2:07:15] but isn't it something but you talk to
[2:07:18] somebody that's harsh with you or a
[2:07:19] little upset with you this is a good
[2:07:21] lesson for us husbands and what
[2:07:23] huh
[2:07:24] use the same tone as your husband does
[2:07:27] use the same tone as your wife does to
[2:07:28] see where you get
[2:07:30] nowhere real fast
[2:07:34] but
[2:07:36] this is part of my message this is my
[2:07:38] party the Bible says that we ought to
[2:07:39] love our wives as Christ loved the
[2:07:41] church
[2:07:42] huh
[2:07:44] what have I got wrote down here
[2:07:45] something about uh uh oh that's what I
[2:07:49] even Paul said it Paul says that is uh
[2:07:52] uh a single person on us if you're
[2:07:55] single stay single because you're going
[2:07:57] to please the Lord and see how you can
[2:07:58] please the Lord but if you're married
[2:08:01] then the husband is going to see how he
[2:08:03] can please his wife
[2:08:06] and the wife she's married she's gonna
[2:08:08] see how she can please her husband I
[2:08:09] thought boy they would just if we would
[2:08:11] just do that more there'd be a lot less
[2:08:13] marriage problems
[2:08:17] huh if you tried to please each other
[2:08:20] make each other happy
[2:08:24] I thought about taking the time today
[2:08:26] hey I'm going hunting I got a happy wife
[2:08:27] I got a happy life
[2:08:34] ain't happy make sure your wife is happy
[2:08:36] for her
[2:08:38] amen
[2:08:40] and even Jesus said we we love our wives
[2:08:43] and why we love our husbands the way
[2:08:44] that the church says Christ a lot of
[2:08:47] problems will be solved how many knows
[2:08:50] the Bible said that love covers a
[2:08:52] longitude of sins
[2:08:55] love produces grace even the prophet
[2:08:57] says man if you if you don't like
[2:08:59] somebody you don't have any Grace for
[2:09:01] him you say anything bad about him that
[2:09:03] you can
[2:09:04] huh just like that person I was telling
[2:09:06] you about you go around and see how many
[2:09:08] other people they can turn against that
[2:09:10] person that they don't like
[2:09:12] of course they don't have no Grace they
[2:09:13] don't have no love it's not
[2:09:15] God it's a devil
[2:09:17] huh
[2:09:20] oh my but Lord help us to love each
[2:09:23] other and to love our husbands love our
[2:09:25] wives the way that God loved
[2:09:27] church and gave himself for it
[2:09:30] amen because that's the one thing that I
[2:09:32] will truly believe in the spiritual
[2:09:34] Realm
[2:09:36] even Paul said when he was talking about
[2:09:38] that he says I'm speak about Christ and
[2:09:41] the church
[2:09:43] even though he given natural type of it
[2:09:45] he says he was talking about the Christ
[2:09:46] and the church and if you love the Lord
[2:09:48] how many knows you're going to see how
[2:09:51] you can please him how many wants to be
[2:09:53] pleasing to the Lord
[2:09:55] amen it'll solve a whole lot of your
[2:09:57] problems your ifs and and commands and
[2:10:00] commandment this and law all that'll be
[2:10:02] taken care of if you just wanted to
[2:10:03] please the Lord
[2:10:05] amen how many believe that that's what
[2:10:07] divine love does
[2:10:10] just a couple more things how many knows
[2:10:11] a good example I really truly believe
[2:10:13] we're Divine love is projected Grace
[2:10:15] will take over
[2:10:17] brother Brandon one time he was out in
[2:10:19] the middle of that field and that killer
[2:10:20] bull that had killed a black man was out
[2:10:22] there in the middle there was no trees

[2:10:29] nose stomping them front feet and PAW
[2:10:32] and getting ready to come
[2:10:34] he says Oh my he reached for his gun he
[2:10:36] looked for the fence and looked for a
[2:10:37] tree he was a natural human being
[2:10:40] uh every one of us we looked for a tree
[2:10:42] look for a fence and gauge how fast we
[2:10:44] could run how fast uh

[2:10:50] he says Lord help me and begin the one
[2:10:52] place he says Lord help me to die don't

[2:18:25] jealousy no nothing nothing can enter
[2:18:27] there it's just perfection that's what
[2:18:29] I'm striving for that's what I'm placing
[2:18:32] for I believe this was about the prophet
[2:18:34] of God Amen Jesus Christ through his
[2:18:36] Prophet was trying to do and get to
[2:18:38] church I said oh Lord that's what I'm
[2:18:40] here at the church for trying to set the
[2:18:43] church in order telling you brother and
[2:18:45] sister there's only one thing that can
[2:18:47] enter there and that's perfect love
[2:18:51] not because you're loyal to random
[2:18:54] Tabernacle or should I say evening that
[2:18:56] Tabernacle or some Methodist Church or
[2:18:58] Baptist Church he says but friends not
[2:19:00] because you spoke in tongues or dance in
[2:19:02] the spirit not because you danced out
[2:19:04] Devils or moved mountains that's all
[2:19:06] right he says but still unless that real
[2:19:09] Perfection or love is in there
[2:19:14] amen
[2:19:16] then the next quote he says thus saith
[2:19:18] the Lord
[2:19:20] it'll take perfect love to put you in
[2:19:23] that place
[2:19:24] would it be safe to say this morning
[2:19:26] that it'll take perfect love in your
[2:19:28] heart to get you into rapture
[2:19:32] it'll take perfect love in your heart
[2:19:35] I don't know there is I don't think
[2:19:36] there is but if there's anybody in here
[2:19:38] this morning that's got a little
[2:19:39] bitterness got anything like that this
[2:19:42] is the morning to take care of it
[2:19:44] this is when you see God I still have
[2:19:46] this little thing here that I hold or
[2:19:48] whatever I want it gone amen

[2:19:53] say I still got that hope every one of
[2:19:55] you amen is it the place to wear no
[2:19:57] matter what anybody does to you you
[2:20:00] don't hold grudges you don't hold
[2:20:03] bitterness I'm not saying you can't make
[2:20:05] it right go to and make it right and all
[2:20:06] that you can but never allow that
[2:20:09] bitterness to come in amen because
[2:20:12] that's not going to be in there amen and
[2:20:14] give you an example earlier of somebody
[2:20:16] that did and they thought they didn't
[2:20:19] have to forgive but that's not the Bible
[2:20:20] that's why they are so miserable because
[2:20:22] God was holding all their sins against
[2:20:24] them
[2:20:25] amen
[2:20:27] no matter how many religious
[2:20:29] demonstrations how many Good Deeds
[2:20:30] you've done or whatever you've done that
[2:20:31] won't count nothing on that it'll take
[2:20:33] perfect love so whatever you do list out
[2:20:36] everything else until you're just so
[2:20:38] filled with the love of God till you can
[2:20:39] love those that hate you another place
[2:20:42] he says that till you can love those
[2:20:43] that would kill you if they kill you
[2:20:45] that's right
[2:20:47] that's right
[2:20:50] that would kill you
[2:20:52] love those

[2:20:56] to be
[2:20:57] amen
