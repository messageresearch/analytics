scriptures i'll read the first one and you know we'll repeat like we usually do psalms 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish

overrun and oh save are you glad this morning and oh say but i'm glad [Music] and [Applause] but i'm glad i'm glad for jesus has come and my cups override [Music] hey man let's get the lord to hand

i thought lord this morning it's going to be a special this morning because we're not going to have one special we're not going to have two we're gonna have three so i'm gonna cut my part very short this morning but i want to sing this song before we get into the specials this morning and and it was requested for brother woody and sister michelle and sister natalie to sing the song they sing last week and and i wasn't going to have them i'll just be honest because we had two visitors and we got back there to pray with brother william and he said he told me about brother joseph and brother caleb and he said are you going to have anybody else sing and said lord they need to sing this morning he said i want to hear somebody from your church saying so brother woody and him is going to grace us once more and he said we're wearing that song out but amen i'm thankful for his blood this morning aren't you that it was paid in full by the blood of the lamb and amen he abides well i'm

with us and the lasters and good to see hunter this morning and all the all the others here heard there's a couple of visitors this morning so just good to have you all with us if you can turn in your bibles this morning to john 11 verses 22 through 26 john 11 verses 22 through 26. i appreciate brother tom allowing me to come and speak this morning and impart the words of life in this day i appreciate a man who's stood the test of time not a fly by night but a man who's been through the storms and can stand and by the grace of god be a blessing to a little flock of people here in elkton kentucky amen turn with me if you have your bibles there john 11 22-26 but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this go to john 1 1. simple verse john 1 1. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god go to romans 6 verses 5 through 13 romans 6 5-13 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god likewise reckon he also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god amen may the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word let's pray before we're seated here this morning lord jesus it's good to be in your house lord it's good to feel your presence father it's good to see so many friends lord people that we've grown up with lord friends that have made a lasting impact on our lives lord and it's good to be gathered together lord no doubt i believe this meeting was ordained before the foundation of the world father if there be one here that needs to hear this message for salvation lord i pray that the message would come and do what you have intended it to be this morning lord jesus if there be someone who needs to draw closer to you father i just pray that you would come in your own special way i pray if there's someone who needs encouragement this morning father lord in a dark age when covet is on the rampant and politics and corruption in this nation lord but there's a people who are called by thy name father i pray that you administer to your children this morning fathers we're constantly hearing negativity lord but there's a positive gospel of the holy ghost here this morning that can encourage us father minister to your people we pray we love you lord jesus minister to us lord and bless each servant lord each deacon and brother tom and sister donna and everyone in this congregation that are fighting to uphold your kingdom in this last day bless them and be with us this morning we pray in your precious holy name the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you can be seated this morning keep your bibles close this morning there's a couple places that we want to go in the scriptures now if you go to romans chapter 6 and you read verse 11 romans chapter 6 verse 11 it says like likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord and as brother branham instructed us that there is only one sin and that's unbelief against the word of god and to be dead to sin is dead to unbelief in the word of god as john 1 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god so we are dead to anything that would cause us to doubt the word of god in this day and i i'm a hunter i love to hunt and i know brother tom got a nice buck this year in austin and those of you who got nice deer this year and as hunters will do just about anything to get the big buck as long as it's legal and ethical we'll do just about anything to get the big buck and i i'm more of a public land hunter so i like to hunt public land and there's thousands and thousands of acres to go out and and hike and i'll canoe back for a mile or two and i'll hike back and if you can quad for four-wheeler back four-wheeler back but you're searching for a deer there's a final destination in mind there's a final end point there's a final goal of while you're while you're out there hunting and what we look about today is i was out here recently uh this last week and i was canoeing in this creek and i was canoeing and as i was canoeing i realized right when i put the canoe in that there was a lot of water in this creek and the creek had risen so much that i was canoeing against a stream that was not just a stream anymore but a river that was flowing downstream so i began to just kind of wait on the lord i knew i had to preach this weekend and i began to see logs and i began to see debris that were flowing down the stream and as i began to see the debris go down i said what makes me different than all the debris that's flowing downstream and i realized the reason that i was going upstream was because there was a life inside of me inside of me and a desire to go upstream instead of flowing downstream with all the debris that was going down the river and as experienced hunters i'm not quite to brother byler's level yet but he's killed some nice bucks and if you go in his house you can see brother tom's trophies but as experienced hunters you're you're searching for a trophy you're searching for the one deer that you took all of your time and effort and energy in that year to get the one trophy and as i said before we'll do just about anything to get that and i began to think about this type of the canoe is a type of our lives in lady osea and how lady osea is constantly pushing all of the muck and the mire and the debris downstream and we're here fighting fighting against the current that's pushing downstream in this last day and we can even see with our fight and our desire to keep our families and go to the house of the lord and continue to keep a fight in the revival in our lives that it's not the same that it used to be in azusa street in 1909 when the holy spirit came down in 1906 and the holy spirit came down and brought such a revival to the united states and we realized then that it wasn't hard like it is today and they weren't fighting the battles that were fighting today but the lord came down and brought such a revival to our nation in the early 1900s and we saw even in los angeles california is i believe the lord is bringing judgment to los angeles because of the rejection of the word of god that was even in that area and we saw the supernatural blessings and even the people didn't have to push even too hard to get into the realms of the supernatural in the 1900s as god was pushing such a revival across our land and we looked even in the 1900s as the the group i don't know if you remember brother tom the young evangelist so the youth for christ it was a big push and a movement used for christ in our day and it involved billy graham and even in brother branham's meeting such a a revival around the power of god the pentecostal blessing the holy spirit moving in the churches in the early 1900s and i like to type the spiritual back to the natural and me being a hunter i see i look at national numbers and and people are are hunting much less than what they used to the the national numbers for hunters is declining dramatically and it's probably due to uh people just getting on their phones maybe instagram facebook and other things have taken the time of getting a gun and going out and hunting in the wilderness somewhere so we look at desire for hunting is beginning to to fall and decline and decline and it's been a consistent graph showing the the lack of desire and i think about even that in our lives as we see our nation and the lack of desire for the things of the supernatural we see the lack of desire for god to really do something in a people's life people aren't hungering and thirsting for god like they used to and as brother branham talked many times about being rich and increased with goods but not truly having a thirst and a hunger for what truly will satisfy what we're searching for in this life and as i compare today even thousands of people and brother branham's they would gather to hear and if you would try and get thousands of people together to hear the gospel it would almost have to be a rock concert or it would have to be a potluck or it'd have to be something of natural desire to get thousands of people together to to get them around christ and we we see how times have changed and even in this canoe trip that i was on it it brought me as brother branham did dramas many many times so i want to bring you into this drama here this morning and let's go on an elk hunt together so i don't know if any of y'all have elk hunted or thought about elk hunting that's something i've always wanted to do and let's imagine that we're way back in the day we don't have motors we don't have uh big sailboats we don't have big boats to travel the seas with a motor but we just have paddles and we have a canoe and where we're at it's a very mountainous terrain there's mountains on each side of the river and there's been a forest fire that's come through typing to our day there's been a fire come through that has burnt off all the vegetation that has burnt off all the life that is around us currently and now we're in a river and we're headed somewhere and we know that if we get to our final destination we know there'll be elk there we know that there'll be food there'll be sustenance there'll be something to keep us alive when we get there and we'll have eternal blessings let's say when we get to the final destination and as we see everything around us that is burnt that is completely lifeless around us it types even to our day as there was a fire that was lit in lady osea to burn out anything that was called god anything that someone even recently uh they're trying to take a pledge of allegiance they're trying to take god out of our pledge of allegiance to the flag and they're trying to burn out anything that's called god in our society now we we see here maybe you've got your family and you've got your wife and you've got your kids and you're all in this canoe together and you're all canoeing together and it's all harmonious everything's working on the same team and and let's say we're into mile one and we know that hallelujah we're gonna get to the elk camp and we're gonna be fine and we're gonna have sustenance and it's my one and everyone's on the same page we're all fighting we're all struggling because we want to get there and we all have an enthusiasm because we know that the master told us if we can get to our final destination then we'll have sustenance and we'll have life we'll have blessings forever now as we see even those around us is let's imagine all of our friends as we think about 20 30 years ago all of our friends that were alongside with us and we were all going together and you have all your friends around you that are canoeing towards the same place and we're going towards the out camp we're all headed down the river to the same place and about mile five you begin to realize that we're going upstream and this isn't just easy cheesecake anymore and we look around us and we see even some of the people that we thought were super strong and we're the best and we're the most enthused we begin to realize that they're starting to wane and in the times when you get weak in the times when you can't you feel like you can't really make it any longer there's there's little pull-off areas and there's little times when you can get alone and you can get sustenance and there's little places maybe you find uh some squirrels or you find some rabbits and there's places that you can pull off and we can type that even to going to church on a wednesday night or a sunday morning or a sunday night and as the bible says in acts 3 19 when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord and we have a time of refreshing this morning that we can pull up to the table and that we can refresh in this long arduous journey that we're going to reach heaven on the other shore and along the trip we can find that there's many side tracks there's maybe some beaver dams that really interest us and there's maybe some white tail deer on the side of the river and it begins to distract us from our true final purpose and our final goal of where our head it where we're headed maybe we find maybe a little tree stand or a little bungalow on the side of the river and it begins to deter us from the final goal of why we're here and why we've been rowing for all these miles to get to our final destination and when we started the trip we had all our friends around us everyone around us was ready to go and gung-ho and we were excited about the final destination but as we think about miles and miles the friends begin to say that their shoulders are sore and they begin to complain and they begin to say that this is too much and this is much more than what i expected and i didn't expect to fight this hard in this battle of where we're headed and they begin to complain and and soon you begin to see after all of these miles that their craft begins to turn and it's not headed the same direction that you're headed any longer but they begin to turn and go back downstream from the intended purpose of where they were going in the first place and you see there's an enthusiasm that used to be there in their hearts but it's not there anymore and they're beginning to go with the stream and as lady osea as the stream begins to push them down they're just turning into and letting ladies push them back and push them downstream away from their intended destination now here we are in the ends in sight and we know that there may just be one more corner and one more turn and we'll be at the destination we'll be in glory land we'll be in that place that we're all been fighting for for all these years and it may just be one more turn and you try and tell that to your friends that have gone with you and you trying to tell them oh it's just maybe one more turn in the road but they say i can't do this anymore i'm done i have to go i can't fight this fight that i used to fight even months ago or years ago and we see we're still rowing sunday to thursday wednesday which our church is on thursday and we're still rowing we're constantly weekly fighting this battle we're getting from wednesday to sunday wednesday to sunday wednesday to sunday and we're fighting towards the rapture we're fighting towards the catching away of the church in this day and brother branham said in a blushing prophet he said do you realize old men when we were boys our boys has got 10 times the temptation that we had and as we begin to row it begins to rain and the river begins to grow and we realize this isn't the same river that we used to roll but it's getting harder and ladies beginning to push harder and harder against us in this day it's not when we first started out and the lord was pouring out his blessing but as the spirit begins to retract and come off the earth we begin to realize it's getting harder to go against the current in this day but in our heart you know there's got to be a reason why i'm doing this why i'm fighting lady osea why i'm not giving into the temptations of this age and why i fought for so long in this day he said sister do you realize that your daughter has 10 times the temptation you had when you was a girl and we see after all we've rode through our ups and downs and we've come too far to turn around do you believe that we've come too far to turn around we've come thus far and we fought too many bad battles to just look back now in this day as the son says there's too many sunsets lie behind the mountain and there's too many rivers my feet have walked through and i believe that this morning we've walked through too many hard battles we fought too many trials to turn back now now a young person may say i can't hold my paddle anymore my paddle's starting to get wobbly i can't i can't overcome like i used to and i'm beginning to get weak and i keep trying to do what's right but i can't seem to overcome i can't seem to do this but i say to that young person even this morning and even to a middle age or an elder person who's beginning to struggle the reason that you're struggling proves that there's something inside of you that's not like every other lady is seeing in this age the reason that you even have a desire to fight the current and the reason that you're struggling is because there's a fight and a desire inside of you to overcome lady osea and not become just a wash somewhere down the stream or go over the fountain of the waterfall that's going to crush your family but there's something inside of you and you're struggling you say i'm fighting and i can't overcome this but in your heart you know that there's a desire to overcome whatever you're struggling in this day as first peter 3 9 says the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us we're not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance and i say this morning god cares about you this morning god cares about your trials god cares about your struggles god cares about your desires in this day at the parable of jesus he said if god had 99 sheep and one went astray god would bankrupt heaven and leave the 99 and he would go after the one sheep that had gone astray and you and your struggle and your trial this morning as you're fighting no doubt battles in ladies but god cares about you this morning and he's willing to leave all the 99 strong to come after you in your weakness this morning oh does he care yes he cares he's touched by the feelings of his people this morning now you're precious in his sight and for him to send a prophet and to open his word and to reveal his word to you it shows that he cares about a little bride in this day and he's not forgotten about you and your fight in this upstream battle in this day now we see in first corinthians 10 13 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it now we see that god didn't come to save us in our sin but he became he came to save us from our sin so when you say someone who says they're struggling and they're struggling but there's there's no desire to truly overcome then god didn't come to save you in your sin he came to save you from your sin and you see a young person who's constantly fighting and as i said before as long as you keep coming back to the well of grace as long as you keep coming back it proves that there's something inside of you greater than lady osea but those that are not really filled with the holy spirit or aren't truly children of god will eventually stop coming back to the well of grace and eventually fall away and go by the wayside so to see that you're coming to the house of the lord that you even have a desire that god woke you up this morning to come to the house of the lord proves that there's something inside of you greater than all the deadliest lady osea in our day there's no other friend so kind is he no one else could take this in in darkness from me oh how how much he cares for you and me no one else cares for us like the lord jesus nothing else can feel that desire in your heart you can have all the money in the world you can have all the political fame you can have all the wealth but they'll still be that little small voice inside saying i want more there's something more that i'm searching for in this day and we see that though the desire for truth is dying though the desire across the nation for truth is completely dying there's still a people who have a desire to overcome in this day there's still a people who will overcome in this day we don't know the number we don't know how great we don't know how small we know it's going to be a minority but we know that there will be people and i just want to be one of those people is that your desire this morning i just want to be one of the few this morning now there's one thing about a battle as we see even in our nation and so many people rallying around different political figures and in a battle you have a general and the men are behind the general if they're going to fight hard to win the battle they rally behind the general and then naturalistically speaking when a general dies you can see the morale of the army just die with the general but ours are struggling our trials much different than a natural battle because we had a general that died but he rose again and he came back and now he's living in all of the soldiers to overcome the battle that we're fighting on a day-to-day basis so the general that we have on our side is a supernatural general much stronger than any natural general that would die and go by the wayside and his inspiration is what's keeping us and pushing us up against lady osea in this day no i've never heard of a normal natural general that died and came back to life and eternally blessed his soldiers i've never heard of a general like that i think we're serving a very unique and almighty general this morning now we weren't meant as children of god to turn back to lady osea in this day and we see what is the reward if you're going to start a business if you're going to go somewhere to work what is the reward and what are the negatives maybe a mom um you know she's raising her kids and something comes along and she maybe would want to get a job or something and she'd say well what is the reward my time with my kids are a little more money or a father he maybe would have to work 80 hours a week what is the reward if i never see my family if i never spend time with my family what is the reward and we look at the reward for lady osea we see a lady osea that is dying that is going to die that is going to hell why would i go and conform to lady osea when i could get out of here in just a shoot a few short days and i could be raptured off the earth why would i stay here and conform to ladies and when i can get out of here in just a few moments of time now as we fight the current battle we see that there's dead things that will come and try and hit you in the battle as you're rolling upstream as debris will come and try and hit your craft and potentially even try and get inside your craft and we see that maybe for men as some men no doubt struggle and for men maybe it's it's pornography and the devil would come and hit your craft and try and capsize your craft or maybe it's money maybe a family's just so money oriented or a husband so money oriented and he stresses for money money money or maybe it's popularity where we want to be better than the joneses and all of this debris is coming in ladies to try and hit your craft to knock your craft off to turn you over from your original purpose and say it's not worth it i'm going to go back downstream now daily these dead things will hit you as paul said i die daily daily these things are going to come so don't expect tomorrow to be all roses and wonderful and lovely but daily satan's going to come against you and fight you but know that greater is he that is in you than all the stream and all the power of lady oc that would come and push against your craft in this day and we see even our nation at the core is gone his politics are corrupt as no doubt many people were looking to certain leaders to lead us into a revolution a republican revolution a democratic revolution and we see that honeycombed in all this is just corruption and filth in the society that we live in today it's even in the the dnc the democratic national convention they two times took out god in the pledge of allegiance in the democratic national convention and they're trying to take god completely out of our society as they took out prayers president kennedy was was there in office and they took out prayer from our schools and you look at now our schools are being shot up and people are dying well why is that because we took god out of the very foundation of our principle system and it seems as though we're not just republican versus democrat anymore but it's good versus evil it's not parties anymore but it's truly someone's trying to do good and evil has come in to break down every push for something that is good in this day and i say there's no hope in politics as we can see with the corruption and what's happened in this election and all that's gone on there is no hope in politics but the only hope is the coming of the lord for the bride of jesus christ if any man put his hope in making america great again if any man put his hope in the things of politics we now realize there is no hope in the things of the natural and if any man said oh well maybe we can get a few more years and and maybe we can just push on and brother brandon was right but maybe it's down the road well now those hopes for those things are gone our only hope is to be ready for the rapturing of the church in this day now we know the lord's going to come down the banks of glory one of these days and pull our vessels out of lady osea it's just another corner it's just another turn in the road in our vessels that we're fighting him we're struggling so hard eventually just gonna say well done my child my good and faithful servant and he's gonna pull us out of lady osea we won't have to struggle we won't have to go to school we won't have to go to college we won't have to fight anymore it'll be over and we can go on the other side with the lord now you you ask yourself well what is the reason why i'm why am i pushing so hard why am i fighting lady osea and you realize that it's christ the only reason that we wake up in the morning the only reason we breathe the only reason we have existence is because almighty god gave it to us in this day he's the only reason that i'm here is because i want to relay to you that christ is the answer in this day in 2020 of all falsehoods jesus christ is the answer to all of our problems in this day now it's a life that keeps our home clean it's a life that will pull you out of depression if you've ever dealt with depression or anyone who's dealt with depression you get so low and you get so down and the only person that can heal that you could try medicine you can try anything but jesus christ i present to you can deliver you from anything that you have in your life that's bringing you down and holding you in chains now it's a life that can give you a clear vision again as you started out the christian journey and you heard so much about god is good and god is wonderful and the rapture rapture's coming and the lord's here but satan comes to cloud your vision and christ is the only one that can clear your vision to make you realize that we are truly in the end time saints it's not a time to play around anymore we're in the end time there's only one or two more corners in the road and we're gonna be on the other shore so i say run and fight with everything that is within you not turn to turn around not time to look back oh what are they doing what are the jungles doing but no am i truly in a relationship with almighty god in this day it doesn't matter what family members we do it doesn't matter what friends may do and where all the masses they go we see people falling like droves but we see those who are standing for almighty god those are the overcomers in this day now i looked at the definition of alive it says having life not dead or inanimate still in existence force or an operation it's marked by alertness energy or briskness and in converse to that i looked up the definition for lukewarm it says moderately warm lacking conviction having or showing little ardor zeal or enthusiasm indifferent if you'll turn with me to revelation 3 verse 15 and 16 revelation 3 verse 15 and 16. and this is to lady osea he said i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou art cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth and we see lukewarm as moderately warm showing little arter zeal enthusiasm indifferent is lukewarm there's a little bit of a desire for god but there's not truly enough desire to overcome and to fight the battles of lady osea and even this morning you know truly in your heart as you draw close to the lord and as you fight the battles you know if you're lukewarm or if you're truly fighting with all of your heart you know if you've let things in your life you know if you've let things happen even in your family and in your personal life and you know am i truly lukewarm or am i truly filled with the holy spirit to overcome and am i overcoming as paul said am i dying daily to overcome ladocia and i believe we know each one which state we're in if we get down to the bottom of where we're at if we can just take a snapshot of our personal spiritual life lord where am i and many times satan with thomas he tries to cloud your vision and make you oh i don't really know where i am but lord may you clarify my vision where am i today where am i this morning am i an overcomer am i fighting lady osea or am i drifting with the tides toward the waterfall now satan's desire is to leave you powerless in ladies he doesn't want you casting out devils he doesn't want you speaking in your tongues he doesn't want the gifts of the spirit to be operating in your life he just wants you to be lukewarm lady ocean and without enthusiasm in this day he wants you to have no prayer life no overcoming life no life to say i'm i'm done with this thing i'm done i'm giving it to god i'm done but he just wants you to be oh it's okay we'll just get it another day we'll overcome it another day when today is your day of salvation today if you will hear his voice hearty not your heart is in the propagation now he just wants you to get you going nowhere he wants you not to look forward not to see the rapture not to see the future of the church he just wants you to float he just wants you to cast your paddle down in your canoe and just kind of drifts with the tides that's satan's desire in this day and we can see that that's satan's desire and that desire will get you nowhere but headed back to a lukewarm lady ocean lifestyle like everybody else in lady osea we know if we take a break from fighting we know that eventually we'll be downstream and we'll never get to our heavenly home we'll never get to our final destination if we stay in a lukewarm condition in this day and you see a young person or middle age or elder you'll see them start to get complacent and even in a service they'll stop to worship and they'll stop to really enter into the service like they used to and you see maybe country music starts to come in and lust starts to come in and things of the world start to come in as they begin to get lukewarm and complacent in this day and eventually as we see even in if we were stopped to stop canoeing and we were just to go off to the side eventually all of that driftwood begins to come up to the side of your canoe and you now have all of these dead things around you that if you would have stayed in the channel and fought ladies see it you never would have had all those dead things around you but you could have easily navigated those things as long as you were in the battle and fighting and now we see a canoe that's just pulled off to the side and there's dead matter all around the canoe because it stopped fighting for its intended purpose to get to its final destination but you see in this situation as taking it down to our spiritual lives as we pull up to the side and we've been there maybe for months or maybe we've been there for years in a state of lethargicness and we hear the lord's voice saying adam adam where art thou where are you where have you been why aren't you singing why aren't you coming to the house of the lord where is your desire why don't you read the word like you used to why don't you pray why don't you seek why don't you fast like you used to where is the desire adam where art thou and you find this little canoe off to the side and if this canoe can just break away from all of those dead things if you can fight back to the mainstream it can eventually get to the final destination but it has to break out of the lethargicness that it's been in with all of the dead matter around it in proverbs 29 18 it says where there is no vision the people perish and satan wants to alter our vision and take our vision of why we're here we wake up we go to work we wake up go to work we wake up go to church go to work go home go back what is our purpose as brother branham spoke he said you're not just here to have a job and get a nicer house and a nicer car but you're here to get a purpose from almighty god that he established before the foundation of the world and you're here to go to your job to be a witness for almighty god you're here to be a witness to the people around you to those at walmart to those who are at the grocery store but you're not just here to be like every other lady or seeing in this day if we don't have a vision then what is the reason that we're fighting for why are we striving why are we here this morning if we don't have a vision of the other side as second corinthians 6 4 says 6 14 what communion hath light with darkness and we see lady oceans who want to get buddy buddy with us and want to get close to us and we see this desire to just kind of blend in with the world but what fellowship does someone who has life in this journey of life going upstream what do they have in fellowship to a log that's just drifting downstream there's no fellowship with a canoe that's powered by a force inside that you can't explain that's going upstream that's going up with the current there's no fellowship because you see the log you know where the logs going but in you there's a fire i've got to get to my final destination now people will think you're crazy and people will stand there and no doubt a law going downstream will say it's so much easier for me to go downstream why are you fighting against the current why are you rowing so hard it's so much easier to just drift with the tides brother random said in identification he said but listen anybody that's living right is an oddball to this modern world and you see in your life if you're living right even to your closest relatives even to your closest friends and you're living right and they're not and they'll treat you like an oddball because you're fighting and they don't understand why you're fighting they don't understand why you're investing in your kids they don't understand why that you're doing all these things to have a spiritual home and they're just going by the wayside and they can watch whatever movie they want to i don't care about the convictions we can just let anything in the house and they don't understand and you're the oddball that's fighting lady osea but know that if they hated christ they will hate you as john 15 18 says if the world hate you you know that it hated me before it hated you and to our men they might call you old-fashioned to our uh to our our men even in business they might call you honest abe and to the ladies they'll say why are you wearing a dress why are you wearing a you know hair that's so long and they don't understand this oddball mentality that you've been in they'll call you all honest abe or an honest female because you won't go to all the parties and do the things that they want you to do but even on a surface level because you'll go to walmart and you know you'll go you'll have friends on a surface level and everything's fine because we relate with the world and we're in this world but we're not of it and there's no way you can be a witness to someone that's around you if there's no life of christ projected to an everyday person at walmart or at the gas station and if you don't have that touch then pray that god gives you that touch once you get past the first just hey we talk about deer hunting we talk about fishing and brother brahm talked about that he said if he wants to talk about fish and talk about fishing if he wants to talk about hunt and talk about hunting and know that it's leading into a conversation about christ but then you begin to get into well have you heard god sent a prophet and then oh prophet stuff that just sounds crazy and then maybe they visit your church and they see all the women with long hair and they see the skirts and then they begin to turn ever so rapidly against you and you wonder why you're trying to show them the greatest thing that ever hit the face of the earth and they begin to turn and it's not because they hate you but they hate the crisis inside of you because they don't desire to go to the same place that you're going to do they don't desire to fight the same battle that you're fighting in this day and they'll say well why don't you have television why don't you watch all the movies and i remember even being homeschooled is i'd go to school and i'd be around all my friends and they'd start throwing movie quotes and like i have no idea what you're talking about i have no idea because i wasn't feeding on the same things that they were feeding on they'd say well you don't know who this actor is and and paying i'll pay to cuss and all these things and i didn't know what they were talking about because that was wasn't the stuff that i was putting in my vessel that wasn't the thing that i was trying to draw strength from because you know if you drew strength from those things you would eventually be like a log that's going down over the falls because there's no way that you could sustain life if you're feeding upon things that are dead in in john 2 28 it says and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and we find in god's promised word that god's promised word is alive god's word in his spirit is the reason that we're still standing in this day that we're still going against all the tides of ladies we realize that it's his spirit that's kept us all of these years and we realize that his word as it said it'll come to pass afterward that he'll pour out his spirit to his true children in this day to his true children who he sees are fighting lady osea he will pour out his spirit and he will restore all the gifts and the manifestations of himself to those who are fighting lady osea in this day as we look at mary and the angel came to her and said blessed art thou mary you're highly favored among women and he told her that she would conceive not knowing a man and he said as mary she was just standing there and she said be it unto me according to thy word that was mary's desire when she heard the word is be it unto me according to that word it wasn't all well i don't see how that can happen but the true bride of christ the true child of god will say lord whatever you say to me be it unto me according to that word in this day as we see moses he esteemed the riches of christ more than all the treasures of egypt and we see moses he had it all man he had everything that he could have had as a man as a ruler a second in command to pharaoh he had it all but he saw that the mud daubers the chosen people of god that the mount sinai experienced that he had was worth more than all of the natural things in the natural kingdom that he could acquire and i believe each child of god has a vision of that for their lives but they see lady asia and they see the glamour and they see all the wonderful things of the world but they can also see truly in their heart they know it's all going to burn they know it will all pass away they know heavens and earth will pass away but the word of god will not pass away and they choose lord be it unto me according to thy word though family leaves no friend may leave but be it unto me according to thy word because i'm willing to surrender everything to your word in the state and we see rahab survive the great de destruction of her city because she received the word into her house brother branham even mentioned that they had slipped in some tapes to her and some tape boys had got to her and got her the message and she heard the message of that day and she accepted it and she hung the scarlet cord out of the window and she was saved because she heard the word she obeyed it she recognized it to be the truth and she acted upon the word that came forth to her in that day and the word was alive to her in 1964 the voice of the sign the son of man would be revealed in that day is that right what is revealed it's made known anything that's made known is revealed and we see that rebecca it was revealed to ellie azer that she would be the wife to isaac and it was revealed as eliezer was the type of the holy spirit in this day and rebecca came and watered the camels and eliezer instantly saw a desire to serve and he instantly just saw as he prayed and asked the lord lord if she comes and waters my camel and she watered both of the camels and it's interesting what he said in genesis 24 58 and they called rebecca and said unto her will thou go with this man and this was after he had revealed everything that had transpired everything that he had seen that esther that um that rebecca had had done everything that she had done and after that he told the family what she'd done and they called rebecca and said unto her will thou go with this man and she said i will go and we can type that to the bride of christ because the lord will say wilt thou lay down everything as the rich young ruler he was not willing to lay down everything but the lord will come to you and you listen to a message and you'll be all alone and the holy spirit will speak to you and they'll say are you willing to lay down that pride are you willing to lay down that phone number are you willing to lay down that lust are you willing to lay down that music are you willing to lay it all down and she would say i can give everything up for the holy spirit to be pleased in my life complete type of the bride of christ in her day and we can say i will go in no matter what the cost no matter what lady osea will offer us we can give everything that we have to christ knowing that in this battle on the other side when all the logs and they receive their reward and they receive their witches riches they receive their wealth and their fame but we know that on the other side that desire to give up everything will eventually pay off and our investment will reap dividends on the other side i will go and who is this he said know him then there is no question to it you know you've passed from death into life because you know him his spirit dwells in you you take his nature his word is alive in you everything he said is amen and you remember when you were dead in sin as many of you came out just straight from the world not even a denominational background but you just came straight from sin you came straight from even the bar stool and you remember when you heard the voice of god and completely changed your heart and you heard that god could come and change a vessel and came one that was so sticked in sin and completely revolutionized your life to cause you to be an overcoming child in this age he broke every chain and he made you a new creature and there's no other power that you know that you tried everything and you tried every drug and you tried every little town hall that you could go to but there was no power that could overcome the things that you were dealing with and christ was the only one that could reconcile you to himself and you used to doubt it but now you can't live without it as there's the song it says real real he's so real to me many people doubt it but i can't live without it and that is why i love him because he's so real to me and so many people they don't understand oh he's an oddball but to you it's been revealed my god is real he's real in my soul he may not be reeling their soul but he's real in my soul now if god's word takes preeminence his spirit takes full control and and god keeps his word in 1957 he said don't expect the road to be flowery and a bed of ease it's going to be a rough and ragged road but it's going it's going to be a blessed road because he promised he'd be with you and he promised he'd be with you and even in the struggle as you're rowing up the stream he promised that he'd be with you and if you know that he's in the boat you know you can't capsize and you know you can't go back and go over the falls and be a wreck and a heap somewhere because he's in the boat and as he promised he'd be with you i'll just give you some testimonies of even my personal experience and just of my pastors our pastor was running away from home and he was on a train and he was running away and he was gonna go do his own thing and they were coming up on a tunnel and he was just holding on to the side of a train and he was gonna be the cool i think he was 16 17 years old and he was going to be this great guy that ran away from home and on a train headed to where he was headed and a big tunnel came and he was holding onto the side of the train and he had a just a piece of glove to cover up his face and you can even remember the old trains how much smoke they had that was billowing back and they were inside the tunnel now and all that smoke was coming back and was blowing on our pastor and all he had was a little glove there and he almost let go and almost pass away but it wasn't god's time for him to die it wasn't god's time for him to let go and hit the side and completely die because god wasn't finished with our pastor at that time and even myself had a brick wall fall on me and completely gashed up my head underneath my hair and it wasn't god's time for me to die no doubt you've probably been in a car wreck or been close to some sort of accident and it wasn't your time and god's almighty angel was there with you in that time to keep you going because he knew in your allotted time that his grace would be sufficient and he would catch you even in a time of sin as i've heard so many testimonies of people out sinning and they almost had that time where they died and god kept them for a certain purpose and a certain reason there's a man in our church that came to the lord he shot himself two times in the head with the 45 caliber pistol and he didn't die and we just recently baptized him and if that doesn't grace i don't know what is to shoot yourself two times with the 45 caliber pistol god has a purpose for that man in his life and if god's not finished with us here then there's nothing that can take us until our time and as we've seen many many many times as god has taken ones and we wonder why but god was finished with their card and he pulled their card and it was their time to go but there's a reason why we're here this morning is one more time of grace to be allotted to a backslider to someone who's maybe away from god who's someone who needs encouragement to know that god is still on the throne to touch us this morning to encourage us in this day and he said each hair of our head is numbered and he knows the hairs of our heads and if he cares about our hairs doesn't he care about your life as well as some of us have more hairs than others but that's okay because he cares about your life more than your hair and you think about how many hairs are in the head does god care about each one he knows every number does he not care about your soul this morning does he not care that you came into the house of the lord to hear from almighty god he cares this morning as job came in and satan and god met together and god said do whatever you want to do to him but don't take his life and he took his children he took everything from him in the trial in the lowest part of job's life and he said the lord gave and the lord had taken away blessed be the name of the lord and many of us have no doubt been in times in our lives where there was nothing that we could do there is absolutely nothing we could do and um even this month as a deer hunter i was out in the woods and i had just gotten down from a stand at hunted hard slept like two or three nights in my truck and uh i got down on the ground and um i just fell asleep because i was exhausted and i was about 25 26 foot off the ground and for me to fall asleep up there it was almost just non-existent there's no way i could do that and i got down on the ground slept for about 15 minutes stood up look over to my left there's a massive 10 pointer standing and my bow was in the tree so there's nothing that i can do but watch this buck walk off and it was a very frustrating moment as you can tell and as you can even imagine being a hunter and thinking i can't do anything but we've all been in those times when even children have gone astray we've all been in those times where something has happened to our health and there is nothing that we can do but trust on almighty god even in the stream something might hit our vessel and something that we weren't expecting to happen and there was nothing that we could do in that moment but trust almighty god to keep our craft facing in the right direction and we all reach those moments in our life when we realize god is in control we don't know what god is trying to teach us we don't know what we're trying to learn in that moment but we can rest in almighty god to know that he is in control of our vessel as long as we're doing our part to fight the currents of lady osea and i believe god works in impossible things in impossible situations in impossible sicknesses god works and impossible someone you'd say god could never restore that person back and then you see much years down the road god restores that person back god works in impossible situations as the children of israel came to the red sea and it was a complete red sea in front of them and pharaoh and all of his army were coming behind them it was a completely impossible situation but almighty god sent the pillar of fire and opened the red sea in an impossible situation and we can see even in lazarus a man that had been dead for four days a completely impossible situation and martha said as we read if thou had us been here my brother had not died and jesus said i am the resurrection and the life i am the resurrection i am the life giver to your situation lord how can i be delivered how can i get out of this just come to jesus that's where satan tries to get us confused when just come to the source giver jesus come and deliver me from the situation that i'm in he said i'm the resurrection in the life and he said where have you laid him where is your trouble and i will i will completely deliver you out of your trouble where is your trouble give it to jesus and he can take it from you as we find the shunamite woman was given a son and the shunammite woman came to elijah and this is so amazing because we can even think of maybe this was like little jonathan or little emmy and you come to the man of god and you're holding your baby in your hands and you're you're to the man of god and he says it's all well and she says all is well when she reaches the man of god when she reaches the presence of the lord she knows all is well if we can just get in his presence as the woman with the blood issue if she could just have one touch one moment in the presence of almighty god we know that she could be made whole and in your life if we could just get in the presence for one time that thing that's been holding on to us that baggage that thing that we've been struggling with for years and months in our lives if we could just get in the presence of the lord and his special touch and he could cut that thing away from our life then we know that we could be in an impossible situation where you say i can't overcome this but god works in the impossible situations if god could do it for the israel for the hebrew children if god could do it for lazarus then why can't he do it for you and your emotional battle and your trouble and your temptation why cannot god do that for you this morning as the lame man no doubt he was depressed as he'd been lame for years at the gate and for years he'd been dealing with this thing in his life and he no doubt was completely in discouragement saying i am not going to be free but as peter came and said look on us and he said silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give to thee in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk and that thing that he'd been in depression and despondency for all of those years sitting at the gate and in one moment in the presence of almighty god he was completely delivered and made whole again we think about in our lives as we have those times where we get so low in our lives and almighty god comes by and delivers us instantly but we also have times where god chooses not to come instantly but we're battling we're fighting satan and as the footprints on the sands of time you've heard this many times of the parable the person seeing two footprints and two two rows of footprints in the sand and two people no doubt walking down the sand you and the lord jesus and i but there comes a point when there's only one set of footprints now and you get some person gets mad and says lord why weren't you walking with me he said no that was the time that i was carrying you that was the time when you were completely so low and you said i want to give up and i want to give up my aura and i'm done fighting lady osea but that was the time that almighty god steered your ship and he took over from you for you there in that time and there was only one set of footprints but that was almighty god coming in your lowest time as the children of israel right in the time when they needed almighty god that's when god came on the scene now in ephesians 1 1-2 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at episode ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ and we see here that god blesses the faithful those who are faithful to the house of the lord those who have been faithful to the people of god those who have been faithful in their ties in their offerings as he promised that he'd open up the heavens of heaven to open up all the riches of heaven if you were faithful in your tithes and your offerings you talked about robbing almighty god and the tithes and the offerings but there's a people who have remained faithful and we see paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are in ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus and there's a blessing to the faithful we all have our ups and our downs and but as the prophet instructed us to be in the house of the lord every time when the doors are open every time when those doors are open when there's a time that you can come to the house of the lord and you're there there is a blessing for those who are faithful and no doubt you see that man who came and was faithful to the house of the lord and his wife was faithful to the house of the lord and you see their children and they become faithful to the house of the lord and the lord blesses the entire church after years and years of faithfulness and that's a blessing from almighty god to god's children who are faithful in this day he said grace and peace be upon you grace and peace to you and through the ups and the downs if you've been faithful to the lord he said that he would reward you for that and he said even in that songs we sing it will be worth it all when we see jesus if you've heard that song life trials will seem so small when we see christ one glimpse of his dear face all sorrows will erase and this struggle and this trial of life as we're lowering and we're growing and we're trying to get through lady osea but you realize that it will be worth it all when we get on the other side when those temptations have come to you and you've continued to fight in battle and continued to come back to the well of grace and continued to draw closer to the lord there will be a time when the lord will reward you when everybody else was going astray and everybody was accepting accepting the societal norm and you stood and you said after me in my house we will serve the lord there will be a time of reward for you as you've chosen to put the lord first in your life now the bible says these signs shall follow them that believe and sons of god are led by the spirit of god and as on the day of pentecost as the life came into the church and the pentecostal blessings came into the church and god promised that he'd restore all of that back in this day as he promised through malachi 4 5 and all of these blessings that have come into the church but now here we stand and the signs have come back into the church so are we as the bride of jesus christ are we ready and that's my message even this morning is it alive to you as the bride of christ is it alive personally revealed to us are the signs following our lives are we led by the spirit of god god's life entered in but god's life has not left is brother random talked so many times about the signs and the wonders and people saying that the signs and the wonders are of things gone by but brother barum said where did god ever take those things out of the church where did god ever take the holy spirit moving with your heart in a service like this where did god ever take the freeness of the holy spirit out of the church his denominations are dead the world is dead the world is dying why are we faithful why are we desiring to be in the house of the lord because his holy spirit is drawing us it's drawing us in this last day not to go with the flow not to go with ladies but to press on unto the rapture philippians 4 13 says i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me and we can crest every way we can get through every storm as long as christ is at the helm of our boat as long as christ is at the helm of our ship and in a race it's not always about how you start it's about how you finish is no doubt in the canoeing trip as everyone's canoeing and we're trying to get to the elk camp and we're trying to get to our final destination and no doubt many of your friends and dear loved ones have lost their way and they started out so strong and there was such a zeal and such a fight and such a desire but now where are they as even a message maybe the lord will put on my heart is where are they where are all the people that you started with and where are they now where is their desire where where is the fight in the zeal it's not all about where we start but are we going to finish the race in this day are we going to finish the race that is set before us in this day and we think about even how few of people will be saved in this last days caleb and joshua had said brother brahm said it was one in a million two million people came out and only one was saved and i just did a simple calculation on that and as a point zero zero zero zero one percent of overcomers in that day that was a success ratio not one percent but such a small percentage of people that would overcome and those weren't even the egyptians those were the people who came out those were the jews who came out of egypt such a small percentage of people that would overcome in this day so don't get discouraged when you see people leaving and you see people going by the wayside and no desire for the things of god but realize that there's only going to be a few saves but make sure that you're one of the fews brother brandon talked about even one in a state but may we be that one may we be even a desire in our heart is not to go back and not to flow with lady osea but may there be such a fight and such a desire in our souls to not be part of lady osea and go with all the dead substances and matters but may we fight with everything that is within us he says fear not little flock and if the musicians would come this morning this afternoon in galatians 5 1 it says stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage be not entangled again with those things that held you bound when you were delivered of drinking when you were delivered of drugs when you were delivered of alcohol but be not entangled again with those things that held you bound in your life and to those who have maybe gotten away from the lord and maybe at one point you were close to the lord and you were right there every beck and plea god what do you want to speak to me what do i what's your purpose for my life but to those who are backslid if you can play draw me near to those who maybe have gotten away from the lord he says in verse 7 you did run well but who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth you did run well you did overcome at one point in your life but why are we not overcoming now why are we not fighting like we used to why is our vessel not going forward instead of just in a stagnant place well i'm not really going backwards but everything around you is dead and there's no movement towards your eternal destination of the other side why are we in this dead situation we know if we go back there's a false and if we know if we stay where we're at we're going to die and we'll never make it to our heavenly home so what did hinder you and those of us who are trying to take up our crosses and die daily the lord sees that to those who have let down and maybe gotten a little far away from the lord the lord sees that as well and he's saying come home why don't you draw nearer he said draw nigh to god and he will draw an eye to you in this day and there are those who become weary it's lady oseah it's a fight if you're not fighting if you're not fighting in a war in a battle then you're not in a battle you're just in a picnic somewhere but in this day if you're having a desire to fight but you're weary in the battle as satan comes to each one of us and tries to make us lukewarm and lady ocean and you can see all around you is just dead wood and you can see everything around you has died and you say lord i don't know what i've done to cause this to happen for me to be in such a stagnant place with you but lord i'm willing to pick up my armor i'm willing to take up my sword i'm willing to take up my cross once again and follow you for truly the hour is late and it's time to fight it's not a time to backslide it's not a time to go to the things of the world it's a time to fight with everything that is within you if you can just bow your heads today and let's just pray and let's just ask the lord if maybe the lord is dealt with your heart in regards to maybe you're not close to him like you used to be and maybe there was a time in your life where he dealt with you and he delivered you of so many things in your life and you reached a point where you just wanted to turn over to the side and you just turned your vessel and all of a sudden now these dead things of stumps and these pieces of wood are beginning to collect around your vessel and you knew you weren't intended to be in this condition but you were intended to fight you were intended to overcome you were intended to reach your final destination but you know in your current state that you're not going to reach your final destination if you can't get out of the dead things that are around you that have bound you for this period of time in your life and if you've been backslid this morning if you've been backslid today i say the lord is calling to you and he's calling why don't you just shake yourself as simpson he had his eyes put out and he was grinding at the mill but he said if you can just lead me to the pillars and he said once more lord and if you can say even today once more lord i know what you did for me long ago but i've been bound by something there's been something that's held me down and i feel stagnant in my spiritual walk but you'd say lord would you revive me would you say once more lord jesus if you say that if that's your desire here and you say once more lord once more would your presence come and would your presence deal with me would your presence move over my life once more father i know i've been stagnant in my spiritual walk i haven't prayed i haven't sought you i haven't really given my life to you i haven't listened to the word i used to but i don't anymore and now you're stagnant and the things of the world are beginning to overtake your vessel and you'd say even today lord once more father would your sweet holy spirit come by my vessel and you just raise your hand tonight and you say lord revive me lord once more you'd say once again today lord once more would you fill my vessel with your love would you get rid of all these other things would you get back in my vessel if i said would you politely leave my vessel and you'd say lord once more father would you get rid of all this trash that's around me i want to reach the rapture lord i know in my current state i can't make it maybe there's some of you who have been filled and you've been fighting you've been struggling but you've been weary and you're fighting and you're continuing to try and help your children and keep satan out of your home and you'd say lord i'm weary would you come lord and refresh me in your spirit let's just pray and just ask the lord that he'd come and refresh us he'd refresh our homes and refresh our desires that he get rid of all the unhealthy desires in our lives all the dead things in our lives let's just pray today lord jesus you see your holy spirit even here lord it's a unique service and unique message lord jesus father as i deliver these things that i felt that you laid out my heart lord is a simple little message lord jesus but father there are people who are dying lord they truly don't know how much longer they can take lady ocean they don't know how much longer they can fight as a mother who's fighting to keep her children consecrated as a father who's trying to apply the token to his home and they say lord i'm weary at times lord would you come even this morning and refill me father lord jesus we pray that you'd bless your children here father lord jesus may you shake them lord if they're lethargic father lord if they need a new touch from you if they feel like they've backslidden from you and they don't know how to get out and they don't know how to shake from the cove that they pulled into but father may your holy spirit go to them even now lord jesus in a unique way lord if this whole service was just for one to shake him or her from their position if there's just one who's been weary in the journey but knowing that there is a final destination there is a final place the resting place but now we must fight if we must win may you encourage the weary father lord jesus may you restore the backslid i pray father in the service we come to you lord jesus asking in your precious holy name the name of the lord jesus christ would you bless your people father if we would all stand this morning and just sing that song draw me nearer drama near draw me
