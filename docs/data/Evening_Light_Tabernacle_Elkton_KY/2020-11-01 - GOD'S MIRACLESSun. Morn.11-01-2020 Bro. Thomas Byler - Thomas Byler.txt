ears lord we love you lord jesus and ask god that you're blessed to reading the word the meditation of our heart now in jesus christ's name amen and amen praise the lord we will be having a couple of visiting ministers this month i know brother ted vanessa and he's going to speak for us on a wednesday night and then a brother heart from indiana the following sunday brother ted will be speaking us to us on a wednesday night i think it's the 18th amen and brother hart from indiana will be speaking on the sunday after that amen so we do look forward to hear and amen other of god's ministers speak to us if you will turn your bibles this morning let's go to the book of genesis and also the hebrews i just have about four or five scriptures this morning but we'll just read two of them to start with as we begin to speak about god's miracles god's miracles you know we realize that this is a time when everybody is thinking about election and all those politics and so forth but i ran across the place and i tried to find it again but i couldn't but i ran across the place where brother branham he says you know god don't care about who's president next you know he don't care about all this politics and all of that stuff you know we know we know he's in control of it all anyway but that's not what god's focused on that's not what god thinks about we're thinking about so much greater than who's going to be the next prize president amen amen because if it was up to me and you we wouldn't even endorse this president because he endorses homosexuality in that right and so but you know but we all have a right to vote and i don't want to discourage all of that and that's not not for me to say here but i'm just saying that when god looks he looks at a much bigger picture amen than the elections and so forth and amen i just want to say let's get our mind off of that and get it on god amen and i don't know about you but i've got my focus and my desire is to have a body change amen we're looking not for another president we're looking for amen our lord and our king our savior in disguise amen we're here listening for a sound to come up higher amen amen so god bless you this morning if you will we'll just turn to genesis the first chapter the first verse we'll read the first three verses in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and of course we all know that he spoke many many more things and created everything that is right the grass the fruit tree and all of these other things you created now turn with me if you will but go to hebrews 11. it's another another description of the creation amen amen hebrews 11 verse 1 through 3. now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were made of things which do not appear may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated you know as i begin to think about god's miracles god's miracles amen i thought about god's miracles in in several different aspects amen one of them is in god's providence and the providence of god and the miracle that is in just in god's providence the other one is in his creation amen we know that uh so many times we think of god miracles we think of it as something that's perhaps supernaturally happens to automatically change something but i believe there's many miracles that god does that if we aren't careful we don't even recognize them we don't even see them in that right amen and so i don't know which i really want to take first but amen i know that how many knows that god is in nature amen god is in nature amen he's in creation and so we read the first verse of genesis we realize that that in itself and also in hebrews 11 that in itself was a complete miracle because uh let me just let me just read you a quote i'm going to try to lay this out if i can right here let's talk about take the creation first and talk about creation brother branham began to explain you know creation because we know science they've been trying to figure out where things come from is that right how things are made and i'm just gonna read this to you because um uh it's it's the way that the prophet of god explained it he says now let's take a simple drop of ink but abandoning god in simplicity he says everything is for a purpose another man says you've gathered here this morning for a purpose amen now how many knows the world the world doesn't really understand that everything that was made and that just comes to mind now that over in ephesians and galatians how that paul talked about that he created all things for his purpose isn't that right and so i didn't think about that till now but but how did everything that was made it was made for the purpose of god so people that don't have a purpose it's a terrible life to have a life without purpose is a meaningless life how do you believe you've got to have a purpose in life and i think that's one thing that referendum god picks up here when he even begins to talk about this drop of ink and how that god begin to create he was he was beginning to explain how that uh how that uh you know how that i guess our moms and our dads and where we come from and and whenever we would get perhaps a splotch of ink on us or on our clothes how did we take maybe coal oil or gas or something right and they said they would rub that around and try to scrub it out and he talked about how that you know the only thing it really did was make it bigger it never really took care of the problem it made it worse and he said it's kind of like in the old testament people would try to get rid of their sustain of their sin and so forth and you know they never could really get rid of it isn't that right and so they could never really get rid of it but he was talking about that god had done the same thing that science has done and that is that they created what he called a bleach amen a bleach and that's right so first of all he says you know we're gathered here for a purpose amen now notice this church is erected for a purpose there's nothing without a purpose and a cause now bubba says part of the bleach water which is h2o which is uh which is hydrogen and oxygen i don't i don't have a great education but i think we all know that it's one part hydrogen and two parts oxygen right now what is that h2 oh that's not correct brother man h2o one part hydrogen just two parts oxygen i don't know all right well if you all don't know i sure don't know either so we'll leave that one hello but anyway h2o which is hydrogen and oxygen and both hydrogen and oxygen both are dangerous explosives now if water is made out of dangerous explosive aminos the prophet of god said that even the waters would explode so can you imagine the explosion if two-thirds of the world is water and if the water is going to explode what kind of an explosion it's going to be it's going to be quite an explosion because how many knows that there was no more sea on the other land over there there's no more amen you know i'm sure we've all wondered but we've all wondered how god is going to clean this off because we've made a real good mess out of it how's he going to clean this off and make it a fit millennium for us to live in but we also understand but obama brother brown talked about how that the volcanics will come forth from the center of the earth you know maybe bury it all burn it all bury it all but we know that when we come in the millennium it'll be a whole new paradise of god amen so look at that the hydrogen and oxygen both dangerous now notice he says and then hydrogen and oxygen are actually ashes ashes that's what it is a chemical ashes just chemical ashes now put it together and you got water break it up you got hydrogen and oxygen but just keep on going back just keep going back he was talking about creation and how they want to go all the way down and break things down down and i was thinking you know and i just go with what the probably god said and a lot of a lot of people here probably have went to uh perhaps be an assistant or medic medicine and so forth so you'll know a whole lot more about it but you know it goes down into the chemistry of the body and everything he begins to explain now getting into this he says listen there might become a sitting here i want to say because there would be chemists listening at it i don't know the formula but i just want to explain it to my own humble way trusting god will help me look if i drop that ink into a bleach what happens immediately the black stain is gone amen so through science they figured out how to make a bleach and something that if you put ink ink itself in it it completely eradicates completely gets it going it's completely gone amen no more smearing around and he was talking about the blood of jesus christ how did god had come up with the formula also amen by the blood of jesus christ by the blood of god that when your sins get dropped in that bleach they become completely gone i don't know about you but that makes me happy aren't you glad amen you asked me why i'm happy i'll just tell you why because my sins are gone let me tell you you can't have your sins gone and not be happy it makes you happy [Music] the whole world lacks happy people why because everybody's polluted there's no innocence there's not people that have been in dropped in that blood that god has created i mean not the very the the the um jesus christ himself in the womb of mary was a spoken word that which is conceived of her is of the holy ghost let me tell you it was not mary's egg hello amen it was not not god having a sex act with mary no it wasn't there was no sensation he was absolutely spoken word pure unadulterated god himself amen both parts both the egg amen and this germ it was god himself it was spoken word and that folks i want you to know it was god's own blood that we're washed by praise be to god this morning amen god amen creating a blood cell amen that you and i could be washed by the blood of jesus christ amen praise the lord so now notice he said that's what happens the black state is gone you can't find it again if you had to you can remember your past but god no if it's washed in the blood it's gone see it no more you won't have to come up with the white throne judgment and give an answer for all your things why because it's already gone it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness only those who have not sent their sins up beforehand have to give an answer for their sin praise the lord what happened you don't see nothing come up from that no because it's broke up now science would say that it turned back to its original acids amen back to its original assets back it broke it up whatever that ink was made out of it went all right back to its original assets and brother bam talk about creation and how that when we die amen in our skin goes and our body goes everything equals back to gases it actually goes back to chemicals and that right and chemicals that you couldn't see with your natural eye somebody noticed the creation was made of things that are not seen you can't see chemicals you might smell them you might feel the effects of them but it's in another it just you can't see it amen so we're getting into the creation and how god made things by faith we understand that the worlds were framed from things which are not seen comes from the invisible and it's a place where science can go so far they can find atoms and they can find molecules and so forth let me just read this now where now notice it went back to acids and then brother bam says now where what did acids come from where did those asses come from see it has to be from a certain thing let's say for instance like fumes made acids fumes made acids where did the fumes come from we'll say fumes was made by molecules where molecules come from from atoms where atoms come from from electrons where did that come from cosmic light amen hallelujah because of cosmic like see you're plumbed back of finding what the pres the chemists can't find praise the lord now i mean i'm talking about those martyrs those christians that were fed to lions that were burned at the stake until their bodies and everything is completely annihilated he says you know those even your body that god has created goes back to the gases perhaps that he come from amen but he says one day when god comes he will call every bit of that back he knows where your fumes he knows where your asses he knows where your chemist your everything he knows where it all this when he speaks it'll all come back together you know kind of like some people are people that like to be buried personally if i die go ahead and bury me i don't want to be burnt to a little crisp but others prefer cremation and that right to be cremated to where there's just a few ashes left you might you know you know i want my boys and my wife to be able to come you know and visit say hey my dad's body is down there amen but otherwise you do what they go back to the gases fire will put that body and it'll put it back into gases back where back where it was before he was made how many knows that god spoke he took the dirt the ashes or the dirt from the earth and he spoke adam and eve into existence he created the body out of the dust of the earth that's why we go back to the dust that we come from where did the dirt come from so much petroleum so much um different 17 elements of the earth better set that their bodies made from and then we go back to those elements that god created us by but god is able doesn't matter how far they are oh my i think that's why the prophet that's why i would consider it an honor to be a martyr for god you wouldn't mind giving your life for almighty god he's worth dying for he's worth living for although 68 million they gladly gave their life and guess what god will call one day and it doesn't matter how far they're going how much he'll call everybody's molecules everybody's atoms everybody's chemistry back to our life and he'll take him into glory they will live forever god is able to do it he created it once he can call it back that's the god of creation hallelujah how many knows it's an absolute miracle amen if you can't figure it out we can go back and know it comes from atoms it comes and balaam says even the molecules have so many or the atoms have so many molecules in them and you can go back so far but then that's about where they leave off because when it goes back to light you go back god speaking the word and it was amen just how god does it i don't know but he does it and it's a miracle it's a miracle one of the greatest miracles amen praise the lord the miracle of creation the miracle of nature amen just the miracle of nature now so he says now it shows that there was something back younger to begin with that's only common sense it's a creation it has to have a creator and it went out from the creator and it was determined and put into these different now he says now science cannot take and adam b 16 times 12 times 14 times whatever and make that but god is the one that has to do that then it's brought down to a place to where it's got down to the atoms and then on down science can't even begin to touch it amen all right now notice he says and then it comes out into molecules and then they could begin to see it a little better then it comes down into something else and then the first thing it comes into chemicals and then they blend all of these things together now brother brown did say he talked about how that uh how did uh scientists and so forth have actually discovered that adam and he says you know they know that everything is held together by adams i mean knows that listen maybe just read this he says like here some time ago they found an atom and they know that there was atoms he says and then the atoms form molecules and so forth and they got the search and someone believed that if the atom held everything together if that atom could be turned around that it would be what's holding it and breaking it apart because everything is helped by an adam we know that this post is held by adams you're held together with atoms the grass the tree everything is held together by atoms well if the atom turning all one way if it can be broken and turned back it would destroy amen now the scientists believed that they could be done and they worked and it worked they said hour after hour week after week year after year until they finally conquered it how many had ever seen the documentary of america and how we had a secret city and when we went to looking for and trying to create the atom bomb it was a complete secret and they worked hard for months and months and months to create that atom bomb and it's actually the bomb that actually won world war ii it defeated the chaps isn't that right because we dropped it on them amen and it was actually the power amen of the adam and now we realize that that atom and my my my what they won't do with that atom bomb called the animal amen but they turned around and realized that it'll destroy everything amen but listen everything is held together comes down to molecules and so forth held together by that amen scientists i mean that they could touch that but they can't touch the other so how many is glad this morning to know that it was absolute miracle by faith we understand that the worlds were framed together by god said let there be and there was now i want you to know something my friend that if you're a christian you live by the same faith that god had when he said let there be and where there was nothing before now there is something and you and i when we get into such situations and places god said whatsoever you shall ask in my name i will do it we live in the world folks where the world may be limited the natural world would be limited but you and i are not limited this morning we are unlimited this morning because with god all things are possible praise be to god we know that abel offered by faith a more excellent sacrifice than that of cain why because he had a revelation of what god wanted like i said one said wednesday listen when we come to church amen god either accepts our praise and our worship where he rejects our praise and our worship god help us at each one of us that god would accept our worship because that's what we come for we come to worship god in spirit and in truth we come to glorify god that's what i like to think about not some election and politics but get my mind on god amen it'll make your whole world completely different if you get your mind on politics in the world it'll be depressing but you get it on god and it's untold what you can do the blessings that come with it how many believes that amen god is good i love to have my mind on god just to think about it why is it just to think about god and his thoughts amen today just the miracles of god people don't believe in miracles they don't realize they're walking on a miracle they're living in a miracle just this body's a miracle just you being alive is a miracle you being here this morning it's a miracle brother man said the natural birth is a greater miracle than the new verse oh sure it's a miracle god speak amen you become born again it changes your nature it's a miracle but for you to be conceived in your mother's womb when there will be a million other people that god could have picked that could have been here but he chose you whether it was black whether it was redheaded whatever color you are be thankful for your color because god made you that way we take the miracles of god for granted you take yourself for granted well i'd like to look like so and so huh i'd like to look like this i'd look like that no god didn't mean for you to look like them brother troy what if we all stood beside each other in the mirror all of us are brothers and we'd all look like brother troy huh we wouldn't know who's who right there's a clear distinction there between brother troy and brother john brother gary i look at your face i look at your face you're all different god means for it to be different it means for you to be different that's right he makes some loud and boisterous he makes peters and he makes john's gentle and soft-spoken we're so glad everybody's here this morning god bless you now the love of god in our hearts and so forth some people just talk that way it's wonderful and other people glory to god hallelujah aren't you glad to be alive that's me you know and then there's some in between huh we're not the same how many stand for god's variety be glad who you are be happy with who you are watch young people listen to this quit looking at everybody else and admiring them huh think about yourself if you don't have a if you don't have a low esteem of yourself god you're special amen somebody might not like you or the way you look but you might say oh that's the way god picked me that's i'm glad to be here i want you to know i'm very special out of a million others he picked me to be here it was absolute miracle a walking miracle a talking miracle huh that's what we are i'm a miracle but it's even i'm a miracle twice over if you're born again you're twice the miracle not only chosen to be here but chose to be born again it's a miracle how did god could place a seed down on the inside and choose you out of millions of people to have received this grace in this knowledge of god here you are happy and free and sinless while other people are so tormented this morning no doubt people are putting guns to their head and ending it they're killing themselves how many knows it's going on all the time amen praise the lord so god in god in creation god in nature how many believe god is in nature sure god's in nature amen brother baby says you know it's glorious to be alone and to watch god in nature my first bible was nature [Laughter] oh my if you can just look around you'll find god anywhere you look for it i'll tell you when i begin to look at this sort of miracles i think about every aspect every everywhere it's all just a giant miracle everything's a miracle the world's a miracle why it's something that's unbelievable but yet true unbelievable the guy just said a word and bam there it is huh i believe in the big bang theory but not their version of it god said it and boom there it was that's right that's how i come brother bam even talks about this i'm not sure maybe even the quote here but he talks about how that you know here the world has been here for six thousand years and it never never misses a beat how many knows the sun don't miss me it's shining just like you did when adam was here when eve was here when all of those same patriarchs it's just still the same cycle praise be to god it's a miracle amen talk about god in nature doing miracles everybody see all them leaves fall this morning you know you're seeing a miracle you know why you know why you're seeing a miracle because you have are experiencing watching god telling those trees in that life go down quickly because ain't got their own prophet's head huh remember how that atheist up in the hills said that oh that's just nature brother man was witnessing to a to a man brother banks woods i think it was him and brother banks woods squirrel hunting they went up to this atheist but the banks went out there and began to talk to him and telling him you know they didn't want the squirrel hunt y'all know this story well and he says well that's wonderful thank you for giving me permission i also got my preacher with me do you mind if he hunts he said brother banks you don't mean to tell me you got so low down until you got to carry a preacher everywhere you go huh and when brother brandon finally come up there and talk to him he says well i better get out and go out there and talk he began to talk to him he says i ain't got nothing against you preachers i just think you're barking up the wrong tree in other words a lying dog huh he tells a bunch of lion dogs in a nice way but that's what he said and you know the story how that now a few weeks ago maybe a month ago before that over on his neighbors you know right his neighbors uh a woman over there and it was either the woman's sister or a relative of hers that went to the meeting and got prayed for amen and took that handkerchief but i'm saying take that handkerchief go lay it on her in the name of the lord she'll get well she'd come home and hate you for it ain't that right amen god completely upheld her she was bedridden and just about to die and and so forth of course uh one thing that this man said to brother bannon was you know but you know one thing that i would like to one thing that does puzzle me is not so long ago there was a preacher over here amen and they took that handkerchief and that woman i thought she was dead but i went over there and she was fine eggs or whatever and she was perfectly well that's the first time he had seen god he had never really seen god before amen did he begin to testify and brother bob says well i led him to preach to me now you know you don't mean to tell me she was actually healed and come yeah i'm telling you go over there and talk to her you know boy he's a preacher then brother man he's preaching to me it got down to the simplicity of it i mean this god is so simple that we miss him they're right by the time we see them trees the leaves come down and we never think god you talk to the trees thank you lord huh and i won't perhaps repeat it but graham says you know that even god god has a funeral procession amen for the lilies and so forth we watch him grow we watch him get older amen and then we see the leaves fall off the fall rains cry teardrops of of sorrow upon them the cold winter it buries him but in all of that and then it goes in there and completely rots the seed he says if a scientist tried to find that germ they couldn't find it but you let the sun rise you let the sun shine and that didn't come popping up how many is that going to be the resurrection well you may die you may be buried but when god that sunshine is when he realizes he'll call and we'll come back forth again every season testifies a miracle amen so this man he began to preach to brother branham and brother bam talked about a apple tree he took the apple tree says you know he says you know can i have an apple and he grabbed that sure have an apple or yellow jackets are eating them uh he grabbed the album began to eat him and so forth he says you know he asked the man what what what makes a tree like this apple tree what makes it go back the life go back into the roots it'll lose its leaves and so forth what makes him do that and the man said well that's just nature isn't that what we choose so many times we just think it's just nature just like you being here we think well i'm just here no you're not here by chance you're here for a purpose you're here for a reason i'm preaching this for a purpose i'm preaching it for a reason i hope our hearts are open to receive it amen and so he says listen he says that's right he says no he says well you know it's not just nature well why don't i put a bucket of water on the post out there and see if it'll go down now i know about you but to me i'm like as well is there's a metal container keep it from going down but that's the illustration probably got used come to find out he says uh you know there's got to be he stresses it to the man he says oh my how many is looking forward to talking to this man i forget what his name was but i'm looking forward to talking to him because i don't know about you but i believe you'll be in heaven i believe brother brahma actually led him to the lord jesus christ and his wife remember his wife and later on says you know he went a happy man he was happy wasn't this ever the same again he'll be able to tell you i never saw god i don't see god no man i didn't sell my miracles but he actually seen a miracle in me and by the way of healing on his neighbor but you and i as christians we see god everywhere isn't that right we see god i see god in you i'm looking at a miracle it's a miracle that people love god look at the world there's very few that really love the lord every time you open them doors every time you come in i'm looking at a miracle every amen every hallelujah i hear i see god i am sorry i mean please you can see god everywhere if you're looking but you gotta look he began to say no he says no it ain't just nature but he says you know he says you tell me you tell me what tells the sap in that tree to go down and hide itself so i don't die don't don't get killed you're telling i'll tell you who told me that she'd be well hey look at that whisker jaw brother no doubt whiskers and everything else squirrel guts all over him from what he said rugged look at hunter you know he says you're not that man how are you oh my i don't know about you but i do not understand how how that god could come down and discern the thoughts and tense of the people which is a miracle every time it's absolutely people will go to fortune tellers and hand readers and everything else they'll probably get enthused when they tell them hey you're going to have so many children you're going to do this that or the other you know you're going to be rich or you're going to be do that you know wow how do you know that they get enthused about that and that's half the time not even right but to tell have determined i have to come to sign of the messiah to happen and the people doesn't do anything for him they hear a miracle every time he don't do anything for him how can the world not amen he says you tell me that and i'll tell you it's the same it's the same intelligence that told me that woman would be healed [Laughter] led the man to the lord oh my why because god it is in his universe how many of god's in his universe god is in his word god is in his creation god is in you god isn't me how many breeds we ought to be able to see god in each other amen to our actions our kindness our love our compassion our everything if we're not seeing it clearly then we need another trip to the altar if we can't see christ in each other hello then we need another trip to the altar see god i need my mirror cleaned off so that people can see the reflection of christ in my life amen praise the lord all right let's go to another miracle shall we uh and i want to talk to you about let me see the miracle of god's providence that if we aren't careful we overlook it's found in matthew if you want to go with me to go to matthew how many believes god provides for us god provides for us and most of time we as christian i believe that we do i believe we see it it was stonewall jackson i believe it was that recognized god's providence so much until when somebody asked him why he could just stand there like a stone wall not move when bullets are flying by his head he would say look let me tell you i'll tell you why you know what brother bram says he kicked kick kicked like that he said i'll tell you why i don't take a drink of water unless i thank my god for it he had such a walk with god he recognized god so much and god's provided us until he didn't even drink the water knowing hey god gave me that cup of water thank you lord jesus for this cup of water matthew 6 jesus said verse 26 got us forward that time brother john behold the fouls of the air now let's go up one verse 25 therefore i say unto you this is talking about not serving two masters one or the other i say unto you take no thought for your life or what you shall eat or what you shall dream nor yet for your body and what shall put on is not the life more than the meat and the body than the raiment behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feed them every time you see a sparrow flying every time you see it eating something realize it's one thing and it's god feeding that animal thank god feeding the birds i mean oh god it's a miracle every time amen now notice in which of you taking thought can add one cubit to his stature and one take he thought for raymond consider the lilies of the field and how they grow they tall not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon is all of his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which is today and tomorrow's cast into the oven shall he not much more club yay oh ye of little faith every time sister every time brother you get to go to the store and you get to buy you that pretty dress every time you get the amen buy that hunting gear whatever it might be say thank you lord i know that you care about me and you have provided the means for me to buy my clothes do we do that hardly but we should because how many knows god cares about the clothes you wear whether you're dressed or not he cares about the food that you get to eat brother tommy like i said the other day he cares about whether you get game he cares about whether you shoot a d or not amen it's all in god's hands we can only do so much god has to do the blessing praise be to god listen to this oh my so he says take no thought saying what shall we eat and what shall we drink or where with all shall we be clothes for after all these things to the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these miracles are going to automatically be in your life amen that's why we sit at the table we say thank you lord for this food thank you for my house thank you for watching thank you for everything because you provided it many times we'll amen we'll god will bless us richly and everything we'll do this out on the other and god bless it and we say well i didn't decided this no you didn't you wouldn't even grow breath if it wasn't for almighty god it was god being good to you god is being good to you god is being good to me he's watching out over us he provided everything that we have need up how many believes that god supplies your daily needs event every job you get a job say thank you lord sister hannah testified last sunday talk about amen it had to take god to open the door god opens doors god shuts doors god wants you to have a job he'll give it to you if he don't want to amen then you don't want to go god knows whether you want things or not amen but god knows what you have a desire of whatsoever things you desire if you ask believing you'll receive them god knows what you like amen praise be to god amen so god supplies our needs how many loves him for that amen strength that you have and then the next thing i want to talk to you about for a few minutes is god's protection god's protection every 10 years hey if you get to live to be 20 thank the lord you get to live to be 10 20. if you get to live to be 30 thank the lord i say for every decade for every year for every month for every day hello that you never thank the lord god has given you so much time he has given you that to you and remember this that the angels of the god are camped around about them that fear him i mean at least there's a protection there against sickness against death folks somebody could just get hit a little bit and end up snapping their neck and dying others can demolish the car and you say hey nobody survived that and they walk away some people call it what the bubble or something huh well i don't know what bubble they're talking about but i guarantee you it's an angel got his hand around it said whoa that's as far in as that roof can smash as far as in that door can come god protects you because why our prophet has taught us that the satan can never take you unless god is finished with you and before anything listen oh hallelujah before anything bad can happen to you the devil has to go amen into god's office and get written permission so to speak he's got to have permission why how many knows that job amen he had a protection called a hedge how many believe you got a hedge now one place the bible does talk about then brother bam says you know those that fear the lord have it but he says you know i believe that even when i was a sinner god watched over you how many believes that even when you as a sinner because i'll tell you all that motorcycle crisis and all that crazy stuff i did by the time and that we did we should have been dead many times but god knew that you were a child of god you were one of his and do you think he's going to fail in his program no even the papadopoulos even then god watched over you he protected you and do we recognize it no not always we do but this morning i hope it helps you amen this is a faith building message to get you to believe that god is there watching over you amen praise the lord i feel blessed i'm almost 60 years old and i feel blessed to have made it that's not fussy thank you lord you make it to 50. you got to say thank you lord there's many many many many don't huh get to 30. many many many don't amen how many believes you ought to thank god for every day that you live for every moment that you have amen and you can live such a life that it doesn't matter whether you do live or whether you die you're the lord amen how many knows job he was the most righteous man he was a righteous man in the land most upright man in all the land and the devil come into the congregation of the lord isn't that right and god told the devil he says have you considered my servant job there ain't none like him he a truth evil amen making sacrifices to god amen he says his prayers in the morning and the noon he's got always it got his mind on god no matter how rich he is which he was very rich those weren't the first things in his life god was the first thing in his life god first our business is second our wealth all of that second god's first that's how job was have you considered him there's none like him yeah i know joe but guess what i know the hedge i can only get so close i can't touch him that's how it is with you and i this morning he can't touch you so remember children of god if something comes your way don't get upset say god you must have allowed this help me to take it in the way that i should amen amen and guess what he says i'll tell you what you can have him people sings and so forth do as unto him as you wish just don't take his life now he knows that the devil would have snuffed out his life like that what was it i think it was peter the same way didn't peter one time jesus said peter satan wants to sift you like wheat he wants to kill you dead he hates you but i have prayed for you jesus said they ain't never going to have you how many know that jesus prayed for not only for these sheep but for those that shall come after so jesus prayed for you he prayed for me how many thankful for the lord's prayer i'll tell you what leaning on jesus leaning on jesus safe and secure from all alarm because jesus prayed for me i gotta worry about it when my number is called we'll go i'll go you'll go but not before then and i thank god for every time the moments that we have folks you won't get to do this again how many knows we won't go through it like this again so let's make the most of it say thank you lord jesus do it with a with a with a good spirit amen and say thank you lord jesus it doesn't have to be a dread but god protects it's the miracle the miracle of god watching over us every day our daily life everything that happens amen god is always protecting his people amen amen god bless you this morning you love the lord and listen i truly believe that there is so much more of god out there so much more of god for us to have this morning how many believe there's more for you i don't know about you but i believe there's more for me there's more for you because well i don't know about you but i'm looking for a greatest miracle of all one of these days and that is for my atoms to change because folks when i walk amongst you'll be walking preacher's house maybe i mean you're gonna have a long walk out there to louis burger and that right rather that you might want to bring your car but and we'll be walking along and you'll feel this strange feeling come over here and the atoms will change but now before that happens before our atoms actually change i want to know that god i want to see all the miracles that god does in my life i could sit here and tell you many different miracles that god's already done but i want to be in a place to where i see god in every part of my life is that right in every part of my life i want to see god amen and know that when you pray and see god come and fulfill that just to take it for granted or most of the time this is the sad part not even see it i mean it was a whole world what we just talked about this morning the world don't even hardly see it they think we come from monkeys and a big bang theory you know it just happened brother brandon talking about the miracle of creation he began to talk about a ball that you throw up in the air and then he says and you throw that ball up in the air he says and never will that one ball make a revolution in the same spot never will it make it a revolution it'll always be moving either up or down he says but this ball this ball of the earth it makes a perfect revolution every time and he stays right there because if we got closer to the salmon all things went bad ain't no shooting stars he says or falling sausage if those stars got another place the whole thing would be out of cater but that all holds and people should really amen just praise god said we know that god had to be god had to make it but they're so blind in their hearts their hearts are so closed till they don't see it that's why we thought lord help us to see when god blesses you amen with the next meal when he blesses you with being able to have clothes amen have a nice car to drive say thank you lord jesus realize it's god god providing brother amen providing a job amen people that need a job and whatever it might be healing you need healing god is there for you but you got to open your heart up to receive it amen let's do one more and that is talk about opening our heart listen to this now we take like the key of knowledge a man has to if he's trying to accumulate knowledge there's a key to that there's a way that man has to open up all right he says no one can learn him they might teach him but he has to learn amen how many teachers tries to show you something get you to learn but there's a key to opening up your mind and learning what is being said the only way that can be done he has to catch that key that's something in there that unfolds something that unfolds because jesus gave us this to open up our hearts to then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast them out and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if you had the faith of the grain of the mustard seed you should say to this mountain remove hands to younger place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you how many say lord open up my heart nothing shall be impossible to you that's something that unfolds reveals him now notice like mathematics there's a key to mathematics you just have to get the hang of it i've seen men that could take four rows of figures and i won't never forget brother billy but billy last one time he i watched him do figures brother john's probably got it himself to where you can he could just take numbers and he could just add it up and just i'm like how did he come up with that number you know it's just you know but you just found that key could take four row figures and put their fingers each one of those fingers down that row of those figures figures and just come right on down like that maybe six figures deep and put the answer at the bottom figuring four rows at a time everywhere from that one from one to nine anywhere from one to nine he says i have a hard time figuring one row unless i have enough fingers and toes to count to get that one row figured out i just never could get find that key but you see some of them just has the key to it and know how to do it amen see there's a key to knowledge a man after knowledge there's a key to science and researchers there's a great key amen and then he goes to talk about the adam and so forth but listen there's only one door to healing and jesus is that door there's only one door to peace he says my peace i give unto you he's the only door to genuine peace i thought about something in the world that we're living in one place the bible says he that hateth me loveth death you know people don't love god do they they put love god our nation put love they put god out which means they love hate now they have hate and they got a whole lot of hate because they hated love amen jesus the only door now listen there's only one and that's jesus jesus he is our healing i am the lord thy god that heals all of thy diseases he is the door to heaven there's no other door and no other way but through jesus christ he is the door to heaven and now jesus is the door to all these things and faith is the key that unlocks the door now jesus is the door and all these promises of god faith in his finished work unlocks every door to every treasure there is inside the kingdom of god amen praise be to god amen i believe in the full gospel every word of god that turns the power of god loose that turns his blessings to the people it's the key to the door that unlocks like all these great heroes amen how we could go on like math i mean uh hebrews 12 talking about all the great heroes we won't take too much time but talking about all the great heroes where it was absolute god's miracle take a little david and a glass how many knows it wasn't david it was god it was a miracle they witnessed a miracle the three hebrew children god took the heat out of the fire was still there it was burning but god took the heat out hallelujah how many believes that god can take the heat out of your trial he can take it out he can just make it of none of none effect amen he can take it he can do things like that i believe he says same yesterday today and forever and brother brown he said one place god loves to show his power i mean god loves to do miracles not just in supplying for you not just in healing you not just in protecting you but in having a relationship with you having fellowship with you have an intimate relationship with god amen i love the lord don't you love the lord are you glad to be walking with the lord i'm just glad for the comfort of the holy spirit my comfort i leave you not as the world gives they don't have much comfort but i give you a comfort that is just unspeakable to know that you're a part of me i'm a part of you amen god one day called you he called me said son where are you son where are you and i heard him when i was down in pancraft sarasota when the lord poached on my heart said son son how many knows if i wouldn't have been silent i probably never heard it no never heard it but if you're a son you hear that call let me tell you something and i want to say this in in my own life when god god cares about the intricate parts of your life and you should still every day hear the holy spirit speaking to you the things that you have need of god wants to have fellowship but he did and he did a miracle in my life and it changed me from the man that i once was to born again experience how do you know he was born again well i'll tell you how i know better sean how i know is because god has begun to work if he begins at work he'll finish it and i'm not done yet but we're still go on the course he's helped me he's held you that's how you know because if you just go off and out father god said you never really had anything maybe you had emotion huh maybe you had it on the outside flesh but when god doesn't work in here it's a paradox you become from a creature of time to a creature of eternity i love to think about in a million years coming and shaking y'all's hands isn't this wonderful remember we sat down there in the evening i tower and we talked about it we dreamed about it we praise god about it but here we are we're over here now it's all over no more sickness no more death no more pain no more negative everything's positive everything's good amen we're gonna have a great time god bless you this morning you love him stand with me let's just give him a praise and thank him this morning for his goodness to us let this be a a praise service where we just say thank you lord raise our hands and thank you jesus for all the miracles lord in my life lord for providing for me for changing my life for calling me for lord giving me the new birth for filling me with your spirit god i can't even begin lord for every cup of water i drink for everything that i have lord i thank you we praise you this morning for your miracles because you're a god of miracles you're the god of the supernatural and we give you honor and glory this morning god lord we don't want to get that anything else in this world get us more excited and enthuses more than you lord you enthusiast the most father there is nothing as enthusias is nothing as inspiring lord is knowing god that we're yours and then we're growing from growing and going from glory to glory lord thank you lord for each one of my brothers and sisters thank you lord god for being able to see them again this morning lord for we know that we don't have no promise of seeing each other amen by next week god but we know that we're safe and secure in you thank you for your salvation lord thank you for all the miracles thank you for uh lord we stand upon your miracles god and we look at you father as a little eagle and say oh wow you are such an awesome god such an awesome god you are amen and amen praise be to god praise be to god hallelujah hallelujah blessed be your name lord blessed be your name thank you jesus once again lord we see fall we see another miracle god you have spoken to nature lord and now it's going to hide lord jesus and you have spoken to our hearts and even if we go by the way of the grave we

with a real appreciation and a thankfulness in their hearts to you for your goodness we worship you and adore you we love you this morning with all that's within us in jesus name we ask amen and amen
