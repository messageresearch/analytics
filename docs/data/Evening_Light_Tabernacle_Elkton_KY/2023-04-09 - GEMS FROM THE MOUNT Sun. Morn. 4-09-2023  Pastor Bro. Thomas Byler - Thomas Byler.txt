brother Willie to come you can turn to Luke 24 we're just going to read the whole chapter here now up on the first day of the week very early in the morning there came into the sub score bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from this and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the Earth they said unto them why seek ye to live and among the Dead he is not here but he is risen remember how he's spake unto you when he was yet in okay saying the son of man must be delivered unto the hands of simple men and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remembered his words and returned from the Sepulcher and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest it was Mary Magdalene and Jonah and Mary the mother of James and other women that were with them which told these and their words seemed to them as Idle as tales and they believed them not then a rose Peter and ran unto the supper and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wandering in himself at that which was to come to pass and behold two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus and which was from Jerusalem about three score four loans and they talked together for all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together in reason Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were holding that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad and the one of them whose name was cleopius answering said unto him art thou not only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known these things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty in the deed and word before God and all the people and how Chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done yea and the certain woman also of our company made as astonished which were early at the Sepulcher and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the Sepulcher and found it even as so as the women had said but with but him they said saw and on then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ who has suffered these things and to enter into his glory and being at the beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures that these things concerned in him self and they drew not into the village whether they went and he made it as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them and it came to pass as he sat and meet with them and he took bread and blessed it and breaked it and gave to them and their eyes were open and they knew him he vanished out of their sight and they said to one another do not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to his to us his the scriptures and they arose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them saying the Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon and they told what these things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking up bread and as the day thus beg Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them and peace be unto you but they were terrified and frightened and supposed that they had seen his spirit and he said unto them why are key trouble and why do thoughts arise in your hearts behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as you see me have and when he had thus spoken and showed him his hands and his feet and while they yet believe not for Joy he wondered he said unto them have ye hear any meat and they gave him a piece of a boiled fish and of in a honeycomb and he took it and he did eat before them and he said unto them these are the words which I speak unto that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoothed Christ has suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remissions of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and year witness of these things and behold a sin the promise of my father upon you but Terry in one city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with the power from on high and he led him out as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed him they came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy and were continually in the temple praising the blessing of God Amen just so glad that he arose again Brother David amen you love

we appreciate that and I believe God will bless him for it amen good song service this morning amen I really enjoyed the song seems like the holy spirit is here amen and amen and just amen and saturating uh the building so praise the Lord a happy Easter to each and every one of you amen amen so I just was praying Lord what do you want me to do and which way do you want me to go and I mean I did want that scripture read on the Easter amen the resurrection and so forth but I have the I feel like the last part of the series that I'd like to speak on Amen this morning amen amen I call it the last part but we're just praying amen and uh and what the Lord will have next I mean there's no telling what the Lord will bring next amen so how many has enjoyed the series I certainly feel like that it's been of the Lord amen amen it's been of the Lord amen in his leadership and it has opened up in my heart amen a Revival Amen in my life and I just disappreciate what God has done amen and so I do believe that a person does not have to stop with the Revival with a service or whatever it can go with you always always and forever amen that Christ amen when he's with you and fellowshipping with you you're always in a Revival amen or should I say you're never in need of Revival hahaha because we know what Revival means is to bring something back from the dead go and look at it amen amen we want to want to have to be brought back from the dead we want to be alive and well amen he's alive and well living in me to tell amenities the same yesterday today and forever amen so we want to take the final or at least what I feel like for now amen and also even with this uh it's kind of opened up more and I don't think we're going to have time uh to go into some of it but we'll just see amen and if you will let's just bow our heads before we open the word for we certainly need the author of the one that has wrote it to bring the inspiration amen amen so God bless each and everyone streaming this morning amen and uh just each one that's not can't be here God bless you amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you this morning on this wonderful Resurrection morning Lord and we just want to say that we're so grateful God that there's an empty grave the one that we're following his grave is not uh it's empty Lord Jesus and we're appreciative of you being with us even in us at the end of the age and Lord we ask God this morning that shall come in a special way Lord and and father do what we can't do Lord Jesus and father come in a special way and meet the needs of every person here this morning you know what we have need of Lord and help us to go from here better people to serve you and Lord no matter how long we've been a Christian we always need to improve we always need to get better Lord and we ask God that you just bless the meditation of my heart father and that which I feel that you've laid on my heart to speak to your church this morning I asked God that the spirit would speak to the church to think that is the things that it wants to say to them Lord so our hearts are open this morning Father for you to speak to our lives and changes from glory to glory and into your very image for we look for you to come soon in the Clouds Of Heaven bless the reading of the word now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen and amen amen let's go back to Revelations once again back to the Book of Revelations amen once again we want to read amen um and if you'll notice in chapter 5 how it talks about that there was a uh John Saul on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book that was sealed with it on the backside and so forth in the strong angel of course verse 2 proclaiming who is worthy to open the book and to loosen the seals thereof Amen in verse 2 3 it says and no man in heaven no under the Earth was able to to open the book neither to look thereon and John wept much amen and I thought about this scripture about how that John uh in between here he says nobody was worthy to open or even look on it and John began to weep and I thought it was a kind of a time of of expectation it kind of uh in between like when something was going to happen and we were all standing in awe and wondering what was going to happen here John was weeping because nobody was worthy to take this book amen and it was kind of like a resurrection between last Friday and the Sunday morning no doubt but there was much of distress that went on with the disciples and so forth and they were all wondering which way they're going to go which we know that they all were in their separate ways and they forsook Christ and man that they were all in some law but there was a time of wondering whether you know what he said would come come to pass when he raised from the dead and all of heaven and all of Earth was standing it on waiting to see if he would come up again and job I believe said you know what if a man dies shall he rise again and so forth he looked to the tree and he saw that when it goes down in the ground it comes back but but a man he talks about he goes away and he never comes back but all of creation was looking for a man that could say I have the power to lay my life down and I have time I have the power to raise it back up and it was kind of a moment of silence so to speak amen an expectation and that's kind of what I see this as an expectation and also weeping because nobody was found worthy because no man was found worthy to open or to read the book needed to look their own and one of the elders said unto me wheat not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld now notice his looks and look and I and lo and the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain amen praise be the God Amen having seven heads and seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the world and he came and opened a book rather took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints how many believe that your prayers don't go to waste amen amen and they sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy praise the Lord our Series has been on being worthy the worthy one amen how many believe that the lamb that was slain was Worthy amen and he talks about having been redeemed out of every Kindred tongue and nation and so forth verse 11 and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing now we've covered quite a few of them but the one that I want to take this morning is the first one after receiving power and riches amen so this morning we want to speak on riches and I titled this amen called I believe his true riches from the mount true riches from the mount praise be to God we're going to dwell on that for a little while with the help of the Lord amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated this morning amen I'll let you all take your chairs at your table and we'll see if the Lord won't serve you up a good meal amen praise the Lord how many come expecting let's continue to remember brother Brian I guess he's doing better sister Jeanette a man walking around more so we're just looking forward to it and so we talked to him yesterday a little bit you have a report or anything yeah okay amen but we're just amen praise the Lord so we're looking forward to him being healed amen we're getting different reports of how God is merciful to us amen but so now let's look at this for a while and riches he is worthy of riches we praise the Lord amen so we look at this and we find out that there's two kinds of riches amen first of all you know uh just that are of the world and and financial riches and so forth and uh but then their spiritual riches isn't there amen there's um what did Jesus say uh lay up not Treasures upon the Earth isn't that right they don't lay up Treasures upon the Earth where moth does corrupt and the thieves break in and steal but Jesus said lay up Treasures in Heaven where the thieves can't break in and so forth Everlasting Eternal and true riches amen amen so let's talk about these riches we realize that amen um you know of all the things and all the prosperity and all the blessings God does God bless us both The Sinner and US ain't amen I may know that sure they're all both blessed you know and so but you know just because you're blessed financially and so forth you know that's a wonderful thing but that's not why you praise God you praise God because of the spiritual riches that he brings to you amen let's turn at the same Bible if you've got it open yet I mean we don't have to go very far as we begin to look at riches amen because we truly want how many this morning would say the riches that God has and that is his we want amen you can have part of God's riches any riches you get from God it belongs to him but he wants you to be rich um I can't think of it amen but um anyway chapter three and verse 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that word cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm Beauty out of my mouth amen praise the Lord how many believe that God wants you to be hot or that's quite something in it wait wait let me make sure I read that right so then because our lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth amen either you're not either cold neither are you hot amen they are lukewarm so God warns us about being mediocre about your faith in God uh about being humdrum and melancholy amen he says either be hot or cold I would that word hot or cold amen there there's the word and I noticed I was looking for the word I would I didn't see it on that verse notice how I read that verse I said in verse uh um I read verse 6. 16. so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I was Beauty I was looking for the word where God wants you to be cold remember I didn't really find it but here I just now noticed and I feel like it was the Holy Spirit taking me back I know that thou art verse 15 I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold or hot I would that thou word cold or hot amen maybe I'm a little getting old but we just read it but I knew he said it but I didn't pinpoint it so there it is just right out of God's mouth I would thou word cold or hot amen either it be all for God or be against God 100 percent amen and now notice they were not cold nor hot they were lukewarm and they said about themselves verse 17 because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing amen this just comes to my mind but is it possible that when you are in a lukewarm state that you think you're okay that you're good that you got what you need you are what you want to be huh because let me tell you how many knows if you're really on fire for God you realize you're not what you want to be you want more you realize your shortcomings you realize in the areas and this is a big part of my message this morning is look at your life and look at the areas where you're still not what you ought to be because you want to be a full beneficiary of what Christ Rose for this morning isn't that the truth oh beneficiary he didn't come he didn't die on that cross he didn't take those stripes he didn't go to the depth of hell so you could be lukewarm or so that you could think that you are what you're supposed to be I don't care how long you've been the Christian you always strive for more strive for better thank you guys y'all were Amen in this morning I've got an amen corner all over the building and I like that you scare me to death when you get too quiet amen either I'm not the Holy Spirit or Through Me Maybe I'm in the way that not allowing the spirit to feed good or you're not where you ought to be one or the other isn't that right all right so this is going to be this is I really feel good about the message this morning it's good it's down to earth it's what we have need of amen and I'll I'll say it I'll say it I'll get ahead of myself would that be okay no matter how rich you get you could gain the whole world in the man but you're coming down to a place called Death and what you have at that time is the most important thing that you'll ever have that's how rich you are in God and what that riches is when you come in on that deathbed what that is is what we're going to talk about this morning amen amen so he says I now notice neither of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable now notice because they don't know it they need isaf when you can't see something you need ice half don't you no it's not uh and have need of nothing no it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked in other words you need clothes you think you're close but you're not I counsel thee to buy of me gold amen tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and so that you'll have clothes on I mean those it's boy we can sure dig people up before we put them in that casket can't we men their ties just right folks I have heard people talking and you know where they talk about their lips oh their lips look so natural their nose is so natural their eyes is so natural and uh the you know the funeral director did such a great job yeah but they're dead there's no life and it won't be so long and it's not going to be so pretty now is it the skin worms will destroy your body and as the brother Brandon describe it up through your nose and out of your eyes it'll be crawling worms and eating you not so pretty amen but we put the best clothes on them and get their best whatever this out of the other it's important that when they go they have some proper let me tell you it's important when you go that you are dressed with the right thing and what you're dressed with that's the only thing you're ever going to take with you you're not going to take one penny one dime you can take a hundred dollar bill you can take money you can take that stuff and put it into casket but it ain't gonna do you a bit of good now what's important this morning that's what I'm talking about it's important and God help us this morning amen the true Riches of God I'm gonna read this now I want to read this story I'm going to tell you a story of the band said and I want to change that story a little bit and that also expound by the help of God on this story all right now notice that thou mayest be rich I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white Raymond and that thou mayest be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear let me tell you when you profess to be a Christian and you don't have the garments of a Christian your shame appears everybody can see your shame amen when you claim to be a Christian and you don't have the works to follow it basically what is what is your clothing that you're going to take anybody that's right your character your character is the only thing you're going to take with you folks when the people look at you and you look in that casket the only thing they think about not so much about how you look and how well you're addressed they think about the character that you were personality that you was the kind of character that you was I believe it's very important that you have the right character amen and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou mayest see most of the time people that are not right don't see that they're not right folks I pray the Holy Spirit go into every one of our hearts and lives this morning and show you where you are wrong I'm here to tell you as a pastor I can tell you over the pulp at a hundred thousand times but people that don't have the Holy Ghost will never see their own they refuse to see their own it takes God to prick you to show you where you're wrong at that takes a Divine Act of God amen so Lord open my eyes open my eyes to my fault because I guarantee I got 20 20 Vision on your fault you got 20 20 Vision on my fault but the backwards the three fingers that go back well it's just pretty much blind you just about don't see that you're wrong amen all right so we need the Isaiah of the Holy Spirit to show us amen because when I come down to that door of death I want my ticket in my hand huh I want everything right don't you hey man well how old was brother Ivan when he left 56 I'm already about 61 I'm thinking five years older than he was Mary Jane around that age Timmy man around that age many of them dying 55 56 years old let me tell you something you get up in the age you better think about coming down to that what you got how rich you are he better not be the bank account that you're thinking about he better be your character that you're thinking about what kind of person are you I'll just go ahead and say if we spend 12 14 hours a day to try to make sure we get ahead in life we'll work and work and work but how often how much time do we spend on seeing how which we are on the inside how finally tuned we are and fellowship with almighty God how many please we need to spend more time Jesus says labor not for the meat that perishes but labor for the meat that endures unto everlasting life okay so we see here as many as I rebuke as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and stop with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I granted with me and my soul even as I also overcame and have sat down and my father in his throne I want to talk about three things that bring and cause us to have the gold that God is digging for you say God is is digging for gold yes God is digging for gold God wants you to have gold God wants to find in you amen he does let me tell let me read this story and I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you a little story here this is this is when I thought about this riches and so forth this is the story it comes to my mind and so I I pulled it up and we just want to go slow with the help of the Lord this morning now take this image just by the anointing of the Holy Spirit there's a little story one time he says this is come follow me Tucson 1963. there's a little story one time I heard a man who and he was poor he was poor and he always wanted and he says it's a little fairy tale like and this morning I want to talk make it a true story would that be okay not a fairy tale but a true story we're going to make this fairy tale a true story all right and it's always stuck with me and one day he picked the flower and the plot and the flower was magic and the flower answered him and he says you've been poor all your life man and he said now I ask now ask what you will and it'll be given to you praise be to God you know Jesus said of the poor he says blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven amen all right how many beliefs all of us were poor now didn't that but what Jesus said with laodicea you're poor and wretched and miserable naked but yet he said I still stand at your door no so he stands at the door of spiritually poor people poor in spirit in other words you don't you don't know which way to turn you're you know you're not you're not on top of the world you're not a Donald Trump and oh I can grab the World by the tail and so forth no you need help you need God you need to be a broken and a contrite spirit God says I love because I can work with you on that but when you're already good and you're good to go and all of that then God can't work with you God has to break you down first I will truly believe that we need a trip to The Potter's House where he can mold us and he can shape us and he take fiery furnace of Affliction and he can change us and mold us take that hammer and beat on us and beat on us until we are shaped in the image and the character that we're supposed to be amen so he says ask for you if you can watch you will now I just want to say you know that amen one day God come into my heart and he says if you'll accept me into your heart amen if you'll take me into your heart you'll be able to ask what you will and it'll be given to you I may believe that not a flower but Christ except Christ into your heart isn't that right then you can ask what you will and they'll be given to you and he says Yonder that Yonder Mountain would open up and I could go there in and find gold in that mountain and the flower says if you'll take me with you wherever you go you'll have to take me with you though remember that so wherever I am you can ask what you will and he walked up to the mountain and the mountain opened up and he went in and there were shelves that was full of gold and diamonds we will talk about that gold this morning I love how Brother Brad here some time ago talked about dying and what it makes he understands a lot better than I do but the pressure that it takes to make a diamond I mean those in order to make diamonds it takes pressure and this mountain this mountain is and I want to call up this Mount I call it Mount it's Mount Calvary how many leaves in Mount Calvary there's all kinds of gems there's gold they're Diamond there's Ruby there's all kinds of treasure on this mouth well I thought about it Oh My Liberty table and thought about I thought about bringing my briefcase in here he meant with five hundred thousand dollars that's right and give it to y'all one of y'all and I said this is this this briefcase contains five hundred thousand dollars now if I handed you that rich briefcase what Would You Do you believe there was five hundred thousand dollars in there amen you open it you tell me I have to tell you what if I had to do something like if you find that I'd rather I give him a great big kiss on the cheek guys I love you brother you're awesome and unfortunately I thought yeah I had opened it up and the only thing you find is something that says five hundred thousand dollars that's if I got a thousand dollars because I sure don't have if I find it down but I thought you know if you how happy you would be if there was great riches given to you now how many knows how happy you and I are to be when we know greater riches and Earthly Treasures have been given to you take longer spend five hundred thousand dollars no it would be gone perhaps you know but the treasure that God gives is eternal this morning praise be to God the shelves are full how many leaves the shelves are full of treasure gold and diamond what is the gold represent the gold represents D and T what is deity deity is God's own life that's what I want isn't that what you want out of the mouth maybe some of that gold God give me a christ-like character immediately I believe the first picture says add to your faith virtue and knowledge and templates and patience and godliness and oh my God brotherly kindness and perfect love let me have all of that those are all Treasures that are in the mouth they're inside of there whatsoever Jesus said whatsoever you will ask I will give it to you excited to know that amen not some Magic by the real Jesus Christ that rose from the dead has given you that said whatsoever you desire When you pray believe that you'll ask Kevin and you shall have them amen praise be to God you know this series in the word god I'll tell you what it's just the start of the fire in me amen a fire and I thought back there he says you know I don't I'm telling you right now I believe that as I look at this and I look at these Treasures that are here I look at what God's worthy of I look at the Bible I see how a man one of these days and then we're gonna be in that crowd that's worshiping him and praising him I look at brother Ron especially Last Night Live and he was talking about let everything that has breath praise the Lord and he's been preaching pretty much the things that I have preached across the ball but about it and everything that everything that has breath praise praise him on the loud instrument praise him with the dance praise him with the shout and so forth and you know so many times we are up here and we're telling what we ought to do amen we never really knew it I said I want it to be inspiration I want to actually dance for the Lord I want to shout for the Lord I just don't want to say that we ought to but I want so in the times we're just instructing us no this is what we want to do but it has to be in your heart you have to actually do it amen we worship God here like we worship over there how's it going to be how you doing amen oh my why because of how awesome God is the treasures that he's given how many believes that it's time to not just say that we ought to it's time to do it if you don't have joy unspeakable and full of Glory you don't have those times of the mountain we got enough valleys we got valleys we got down places but if you ain't got those top if you don't have those places that you just want to run around around the tree and shouting Glory Glory if you don't know what to better do with yourself sometimes you ain't living the way you are to be a living you have not reached your full potential [Laughter] Hallelujah amen the neighbors heard me screaming the other day no doubt amen I live a half a mile away and they're going to call the cop say hey this is disturbing the peace out here maybe that guy smile but a little ways across the hollow them collars carry pretty good Glory God is good isn't he how many believes it so we look at this open up the diamond says go God is going to bring me gold that's right in the fire amen I pity the poor how many bits you ought to pity the poor people that have not accepted haven't caught these gems Heaven God Christ haven't got joy in their life you pity him it's a Pity let me tell you it's a Pity the way to condition the worlds and the people in well they don't have to be praise be to God you believe that so we see Rich Leah they see a shirt maybe they have plenty of worldly things but how much of God have you got how what's up you got I'm Glory when you go to seeking you got to do what Jesus said sequence listen let's go to let's go see look at this for a minute in Matthew 25 26 and verse 25 says therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life or what you shall eat or what you shall drink or for your body what she shall put on for is not the life more than the meat and the bodied in Raymond behold the fouls of the air they so not neither do they read nor Gather in the barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they which of You by taking thought can add one cue but unto stature and why take ye thought for Raymond consider the lilies and Honeys uh grow and they tell not neither do they spin yet I say unto you that even Solomon was not a raid as one of these little ones whoever if God so clothed the grass at the field which is today and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall ye not much more clothe ye oh ye of little faith therefore take no thoughts saying well what am I gonna eat quit worrying so much about your natural things are you with me quit thinking so much about your natural things throughout these things verse 32 it says to the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things but seek ye first hallelujah what am I supposed to go into this mountain look for the kingdom of God and his righteousness mountain is the righteousness of almighty God you were born in sin shape you're nothing but a sinner but you have need of God's righteousness because without God's righteousness you're not going to have any peace without his righteousness no peace and in order to be righteous you need something else in your life how many knows what that is that's forgiveness you need God's forgiveness amen I'm going to stop there we'll pull back and come back into that but I want to go to Peter look at Peter for just a minute because different three different aspects that I want to look at with the help of the Lord this morning and getting the riches of God he's worthy of all riches because you wouldn't get any of this remember this I don't care if you're a billionaire you couldn't buy one ounce of God's peace not one bit of his true Joy not one bit of his love not one bit of his grace you couldn't buy any logs offering gentleness or meekness you can't but it can't be bought with a trillion dollars but it was bought on Calvary Jesus paid for it took the dying of a man somebody had to die and that man was the lamb Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world that's why we said take Worthy is the Lamb to receive riches and glory and salvation He's Worthy that lamb that was slain he is worthy then all you got to do is accept him into your heart receive him not can't be bought had to be paid for the only way that he could come was through the blood amen now notice what was the three trials chastisement and suffering that's Heisman or correction is how do things come one place the Bible says that he was protect perfected through sufferings one place to see Brother Band said that any church that's not suffering isn't of God amen God calls us to suffer he calls us to suffer you don't get it any other way you don't get it on a flowery bed of ease how do we get this gold these riches gold diamonds amen I want to dwell on that for a little help a little bit but notice in James that our first Peter if you want to go with me First Peter 1 verse 3 blessed be to God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which has which according to His abundant Mercy has begotten us unto a dead hope a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead yeah we're talking on the resurrection this morning God does a livelihood because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ Glory listen to this to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that faith is not away praise the Lord how many knows all these Earthly things they'll fade the rust in their fade buy a new vehicle there ain't no time that it'll be old and rusted and not everything else but this is something that faith is not a way reserved in heaven for you praise the Lord who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation need to be revealed in the last time wherefore ye great greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be Tried by fire amen we ask for this and we ask for that brother bam says the best thing God can give you is a good trial to try you test you best things that he ever gave us was trials and tests hardships and suffering amen now notice that perish is to be Tried by fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ folks when you meet the Lord there's one thing that you want to present to him you know what that is his righteousness his life the character your character that was molded by the fiery trials that he allowed to come your way whom having seen having not seen ye Love Now how many believe that no we don't that's naturally sleeping but we're here this morning because we love him in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory oh that's why we come with that song it is joy unspeakable and full look Glory Full Of Glory Full Of Glory it is joy unspeakable and full of Glory over the half has never yet been told I have found his Graces all come complete it's a Pious all my needs it is like a great overwhelming flood falling over my soul wait a minute can't cut remember it all how many believes it should we have a call altar call and ask you if you have some some of them times of joy unspeakable and you don't know what to do with yourself you just gotta jump or scream or something now remember this is the joy of the Lord we should have plenty of that around when you get into actual he comes down there's sacred times that I like to just my sacred time with the Lord but there's multiple times I believe that we have where it's Joy times of joy in the Lord amen so here he says the trial of your faith is more precious than a pure precious more precious than gold that perishes your tests and your trials they come your way to try you are more precious to you than if somebody give you a suitcase of five hundred thousand dollars more precious than that why because those trials that come your way is what forms you it shapes you now notice there's something else and the second one is God's chastisement is basically God's whippings and correction to you amen those are not easy no they're not easy ah but if you can't stand chastisement if God can't corrupt you crap sometimes some and you know that that's kind of terrible but sometimes that falls on my part the pastor sometimes has to correct the church bring correction oh yeah I hate when I have to do it I like when everything's running smooth like it is amen that's all I like everything's good nobody's acting up not you know everybody's loving one another and so forth ah but sometimes he does sometimes he has to correct this and oh it just cringes and oh I know he's preaching at me he's just picking on me and you can either get an attitude about I've had people walk out and I don't even want to mention that but yeah just you know just but either take correction or you're a bastard you know I looked up to the definition of bastard children one of them that says undesirable and Despicable or a person that's born out of holy wetnock where the parents weren't uh weren't married illegitimate an illegitimate child in other words you claim to be a Christian but you're not really you're not a God doesn't have bastard children no you're either son or a bastard amen so we don't want to be bastards we want to take the correction that God gives us amen but trials as I was saying God loves to dig for gold he looks tries to look for gold in your life how does he look for gold in your life the same way he did with Israel when he took the two million people out of Egypt brought them all out oh the Miriam and everybody was dancing they were shopping when they left Egypt isn't that right just great joy great shouts and a wonderful service then right after the service Monday came along they come down to a red sea and boy everything that could go wrong did go wrong is that right they come up against us see and I can just imagine now through these cliffs in this pathway through there and at the bottom of it they come to the bottom of it way down there somewhere and there's the water big old body water they can't even cross they ain't got no boats all the families the children the horses the wagons whatever they can't cross it and boy you talk about people really questioning their leader you know that's a good time whenever the church begin to question their leaders when really hard times hit the church rough well if he was of God he was if you just watch your mouth that's exactly what the Israelites I said who are you why did you bring us out here to die amen Moses didn't like it either I don't like it either but God brings us to those places amen he brings you to those uncomfortable places in your life and I got some really bad news according to the Bible and the prophet of God he says every son that cometh must be tried everybody gets to have to take that test everybody has to go through it Amen brother Danny I'll give him a heads up because he says I'm a young preacher and I know I got to go trials you better keep your head up buddy it'll come in the way you don't expect to from a person you would never expected you never know when you're going through it you just think oh this is just this is just this is just a success but you got to realize hey God give it in God's hands because let me tell you God has a unique way to try us it's not like a lot of times he's going to allow you to say well I I got this figured out no you ain't got it figured out you'll try to straighten it up and go through it and yourself and this out of the other huh can I give you a personal testimony you're talking to a man that has come that to that place that is tried tried and tried and that had many failures amen many times I've failed amen but eventually I learned that where I go about that is right here this is where I go when those come and learn to give it to God instead of letting it come in here amen that's right but I've learned it amen just because you don't pass it the first time second time third time 20th time don't mean you're not a child of God if you're his you'll pass it eventually can I tell you some good news if you're a child of God there's no time there's no limit on how many times you'll get this test he was gonna he's gonna give you test many times as you need it until you pass it amen Hard Times rough times things that you should think my this just couldn't be shouldn't be huh amen praise the Lord Brother Danny uh something else talk about you know you've seen we're stepping into walking in the steps of Jesus yeah I've been to I see that when you want to walk and you want to follow his steps and you're like wow do I do gotta do that how about how about getting scars from the house of your friends or being crucified and whatnot else by your own children and so forth but yes you got to be able to walk wherever Jesus goes in whatever it costs but we're following Christ amen just hope God helps you through all of those times but it's the molding times it's the hard times it means that mold you and shape you and make give you character or drive you crazy yeah and you won't be sitting in the views no more you'll be on that's right because if your son of God it's going to come amen and now I just want to say something you know from down the road but if you don't end up overcoming you're not a child of God because the Bible promised that thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy if you're a child of God you will possess the gates of everything the devil throws at you God will see to it in you that it happens I'm a witness amen he'll get you through it amen praise the Lord how many believes it was trials and those tests it's what molds and shapes you now I want to say this a lot of us have already went through those things and it shaped us it's formed us amen I still have tests I still have trials but not like I did have amen the Lord knows that if he puts it on to me again he already knows what I'm gonna do I'll go down on my knee and I'll commit it to God amen if you thought I didn't he'd probably do it again amen everybody understands that now to another story y'all have heard of the creeper y'all have heard of what brother bam said and I'll just read it now notice some years ago on patrol going through a cornfield I would think of a a limb that had I was thinking and I seen that there at a limb that had blowed off of a tree and it fell over a stalk of corn and that stalk was trying its best to get straight like it was supposed to be but it was deformed because there's something that had happened that stick was laying over it another cases whenever uh he says also we find the creeper in the field many of you men and women with a in Kentucky with the hose and so forth you'd have to them little creepers that creep up on them and manage deforms and all kinds of things he says now if you didn't get those Creepers out there with the corn was in the row like this then that creeper would reach over and grab a hold of the Corn wrap itself around gradually so easily it's Lively and that you would hardly could tell that it was rapping and finally it cooked stronger and stronger and it pulls at corn till it's deformed pulls it against itself wraps around its own Vine deforming it from what it was to something else amen Amino is When Trials and tests and suffering and this that and the other comes sometimes I mean if you allow those trials and testimony to come lean on you amen as a Christian man and you don't get those things that creep in your life and cause you amen perhaps bitterness ah suffering because somebody did you wrong or whatever it is huh you let that stay there and remember that bitterness it'll cause you to become deformed you'll and I thought you know it'll never grow any higher if there's something comes into changes you the only way you'll grow is sideways or down you'll never grow you'll never get any deeper in God if you like something like trials and tests to come your way and not to get the better to get victory over it one other thing the next thing that I want to bring out amen now uh and that is Grace or forgiveness how many knows that if you're ever going to have the very righteousness of God Amen you need the Forgiveness of God has to forgive you unforgiveness will absolutely if you're not forgiving and you've got sin in your life you are gonna be sad depressed knowing you're not right it's going to lay there but when you go on your knees and you ask God to forgive you and how many knows God is very gracious to forgive you I don't care if you've done that uh if you owe him a hundred thousand dollars so to speak remember the one old a hundred thousand the other one just a little you've been forgiven a much God will forgive you of much the woman that was caught in the very active adultery God forgive you neither do I can never condemn thee go and sin no more amen I'm thankful for that what a jewel amen what a gym what a wonderful God that he forgives us you'd be gone folks I believe it was a song called a gospel song history he says what if God held it against you you'd be in trouble wouldn't you turn with me to Matthew 6. Matthew 6. and verse 7. Matthew 6 and verse 7. but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the Heathen do for they think that in much they shall be heard in for their much speaking but be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you need have need of before you even ask after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in Heaven halloweth be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors amen look at that that's what I want to get to forgive us of our debts what a great treasure because how many knows that with the Forgiveness of your sins comes reconciliation the great Jewel the great Jewel of reconciliation being reconciled back to almighty God I mean one of the great things that I want to go into this mountain for I mean is to get fellowship with my heavenly Father Again being reconciled to God to have fellowship with again that's truly my and then this story I didn't finish the story I'll go ahead and finish it all you'll be asking me after service but after the it says that this man he says I gotta go tell my friends I gotta go tell my friends I'm rich I'm rich I'm rich hahaha I thought that's why the real believer does you got to tell everybody do you know Christ do you know Christ I'm rich let the poor say I am strong or Rich let the weak say I am strong Let The Sinner say I'm a saint let that sick say I'm Healed let the weak say I'm strong that's real jewels gotta go down gotta go tell but he left the flower he says I shut up the flower kept telling you got to take me with you gotta take me with you and he said I shut up I gotta go do this it's so busy with the treasures that he had he forgotten left him on a shelf folks let me just conclude with this as far as that story is don't leave him on yourself because you don't get so busy with this world stuff that you leave him on the Shelf somewhere don't get so busy with the things of this world trying to get happiness and riches that you don't get the true Riches of Joy folks if there's anything that you ought to look for it's Joy I believe Paul said the Kingdom of Heaven is not meat and drink but it's righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost that's the kingdom of heaven righteousness peace and joy in Christ you know I'm glad that man left him in that mountain he left him on the shelf and the Mountain closed out that was the end now he didn't get no more but you and I don't have to do that why because how many believe will you take him with us wherever we go and whatever we ever have native everything in that mountain that everything that he could ever dream of when you get the Holy Ghost you have everything that you'll ever need in this life Journey Amen in death in the resurrection and in the world to come you got everything that you have need of just don't leave him I'm not leaving him are you leaving him no not leaving him on the Shelf somewhere not putting him second in our life he stays first and then you can ask what you will he will supply every need that you have let's go a little deeper forgive us of our best as we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but to Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen oh you thought that was then no Jesus says a little more because new we need a little more are you with me after that for if you forgive men there trespasses wow how many beliefs this is the law of God this is God's law if you forgive men that trespasses you're heavenly father will also forgive you so if you want forgiveness forgive you want your sins retained don't forgive don't forgive those that do you wrong and then God won't forgive you how many knows when you don't do that you're going to live in a world of misery Satan will straddle your shoulders and he'll guide you and he'll make you do this and that and the other he'll torment you your comfort in bed is going to be bitterness hatred and variance because you don't forgive folks I have seen I have seen marriages where there was unfaithfulness unfaithfulness and there was an attempt made an attempt made for forgiveness but it just didn't seem to happen that marriage didn't last amen seen it fall apart there has to be genuine forgiveness amen you've got to forgive it'll tear families apart it'll tear friends apart it'll tear churches apart it'll separate you from your friends amen it's almost it's the Cesspool Satan unforgiveness is the Cesspool of Satan he loves it because he can work in that he can make you bitter and we make you bitter you want somebody else to be bitter you want to share your bitterness amen the Bible says that it defiles many you better get it off of you amen folks I'm here to tell you I thank God and I'm speaking to myself because I I'll tell you what I just know I've got enough reason for anything anybody to be bitter but I don't I'm not bitter at anybody it's you know I don't bring nothing up but don't want to talk about don't even don't even talk to me about it because if I can't forgive I won't be free I'll be a miserable creature I refuse to be miserable amen aren't you glad to be able to forgive it is a absolute Jewel for you to have the ability to forgive and here we're we're a church we're a group I guarantee you we're going to do each other wrong we're going to say something that somebody didn't like or you didn't like this that or the other and you can let it ease at you or you can say I forgive him I didn't even think nothing of it you remember brother Brandon one time where it was going to take him let me tell you it leads to destruction it leads to destruction unforgiveness leads to destruction of you your family it brings these it makes you deformed it deforms you keeps you from being a Christian and you can't grow you won't grow in the Lord wherever you held that bitterness that's where you stay right there you won't go any further until that is taken care of remember Jesus even said you know if you got all against your neighbor brother he says lay your altar out you leave your gift at the altar and go make that right I'm not accepting your gift until you make that right amen God doesn't allow you to prosper and grow until you first forgive that's so many times you say like brother Dan says a lot of times you know a lot of times our Scars come from the house of our friends our very best friends sometimes I as a pastor have caused scars but I try to make it right I try to get right I'm willing to repent anybody has any scars from kind of me I'm open I'll ask you to forgive me I don't have anything wrong amen forgive me I thought this Jim of being able to forgive and then you can live in peace say wow this is a great place to live I certainly wouldn't want to live in the other world it's a world of Torment amen for if you forgive man their trespasses your heavenly also will forgive you but if you forgive not men there trespasses neither will you that also means that you've got all of your sins on you how many knows that and then not only that it says the shame of thy nakedness do not appear amen whenever you have that it everybody can see it amen I wouldn't want brother Brad up here Danny up and I you wouldn't want me up here if I had had something against you or bitterness amen or Unforgiven you wouldn't want me up here you see you don't want to hear that amen so thank God thank God that we forgive one another even as Christ has forgiven you somebody that does something wrong to you forgive him amen because why one of the great Treasures that Christ came was to give you victory well I just can't I just can't I just can't you better go the only thing that I can conclude if you cannot ever forgive is I question your birth I question your new birth amen now I say that not lightly but I'm going to take you back into the context of what the prophet taught us he says when there's a squabble and the qualm comes up in church and you just stay out of church says I question your experience he questioned your experience just because you go out of church because of a squabble or something that's going on and if you can't ever overcome things that people have done for you I question your experience amen this is okay this is a little pastor this morning but we need it I need it we all need it because when we're playing volleyball and I step on your foot I'm gonna say I'm sorry brother I'm sorry sister that's just a small example of living together having to put up with us humans back of my story about the brand I'm hot it nearly destroyed his life unforgiveness almost destroyed brother Madam's life remember people would not listen to what he was saying it would not believe the sign that Christ was doing and he was finally done with people didn't he say later he was finished he was so tore up people have just so rejected him until he says I'm just going to go out in the mountain and when God has something for me I'll come in and I'll tell it then I'll go right back out remember where the vision finally left him he says he's seen he's seen a couple of his friends at some city dump in the vision and there they were around some bum fire and there he was with him he says you'll end up like them if you go down the road did you go on and brother Branham had to go off the field for a little bit and come back and says I need to get my feeling back I need to get my heart right so that I could have the feeling of the people anymore because we as human beings we are so full of mistakes so full of a fault amen that we need more of God we need more of his Spirit we need more of his character I want his character don't you his character that's molded by those things now remember this those hard things that come our way those things you say well that just happened no no no it didn't just happen God allowed those things to happen to see how you would react how you would act amen which side you would take and you can either have Christ's character he says well they even crucified him many places even as Christ suffered amen sometimes we he suffered because of our sin didn't he said forgive them and that's what we do to each other look it might be your sin it might be that we the fault of each other we suffer for our each other but he said forgive him we arm yourselves the Bible says I think I think in James with the same mind that Christ had even as Christ has forgiven you forgive others also amen praise the Lord amen because that's what makes well you say well I got perfect love I I want the perfect I want that gym without perfect love you're not going to be there are you how are we ever going to know if you have very glove or not riverbam says you know what we allowed to Pat the man on the back the Pat's our back but he says you know if you let a man slap you in the face and see if you want to still Pat him on the back or not he says yeah try it find out let's find out whether you got this real gem that it's going to be take to get you there amen don't just pray for those that pray for you pray for those that despitefully use you persecute you no matter what you do a lot of times uh let me just finalize let me finish it with this can I with what how Peter put it I like how Peter put it he says for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience sake Freeman for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience Towers God endure grief oh I'm so grieved I just so agree yeah endure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it when ye are buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently how many believe anytime I do something wrong and I know that's my fault I take it patiently that's right that's exactly right but but when you do well and suffer for it and you take it picantly this is acceptable to God wow when you suffer wrongfully and you take it and you don't have no bitterness you keep your composure you don't get that thing in your heart but if you get that thing in your heart don't act it's in there get it out right don't act but if in the heart it's you know for even here unto where ye called you know in the future the false mind and the world and what they're going to do to us ain't no telling what we're going to have to go through yet you know in the world order how that right is wrong and anything said anybody says they Twisted Plumb the other way you could say one thing and they'll say that you said the other I was looking at the news and and uh Fox News or one of them said that uh Melania Trump that's his wife is standing by Trump on this and then I read down here on this corner he says Melania Trump is not standing with her husband I'm like well well says she does one says you don't they kind of twist it around you know and that's what people do to you A lot of times you say something you do something twisted around and you have to get used to because how many knows Jesus suffered wrong he didn't I read in the Bible where it says remember where Jesus said he says who's who's coined what inscription is it on Caesars should we pay taxes he says yeah she says it sees us in scriptures give unto Caesar the things that are seized ran to God towards God later in the Bible you'll find that those Pharisees when the Judgment came to be they said that he's even saying that we shouldn't pay our taxes straight up lied about what he said they'll do it to you straight up lie and then remember brother when he was here there was a man that lied or tried to steal his tent or something and he says brother why don't you preach for me tonight I I've got a congregation I believe you'd have a little problem but yeah that's the kind of process you must preach for me you know offer him good do good to them that despitefully use you and so forth amen Lord Jesus I don't know about you but I want when I come to that place when the Rapture comes I want that character I want a christ-like character that has been molded by the fiery furnace of affliction are you with me this morning you better come brother bam says before it's too late saith the Lord and by of me gold God's very own life isn't that what that goal is that gold is God's very life that's tried in the fire and you will be truly rich amen are you getting it listen naked physically we came into this world but naked spiritually you will not leave it no we're going to take something with us and what that something is is all that we can take with us amen nothing less and nothing more so we had better be real careful now to see what we take with us that we take something that will make us right before God so then what will it what will we take with us we will take our character boy wasn't he a character no let them say boy wasn't he a Christian now that man that woman they were genuine Christian that brother was a Christian when they look at you let them say she was a Christian he was a Christian amen you love the Lord stand with me now what kind of character will you take with you will it be his whose character was molded by sufferings in a fiery furnace of Affliction or will it be the softness of this characterless laodicea people it's up to each one of us for in that day you'll bear your own burden how many believe that when that day comes nobody's going to be able to change you or help you it'll be what you have done yourself in life with our heads bowed different place I said I read where prophet of God said you know usually on Easter people will spend thousands and millions of dollars to put Easter flowers on the altar he says the altar is not made for Easter flowers the altar is made for you God wants humans he wants your heart he wants your life that's what we can give to Christ this morning how many of you are in here this morning with your heads bowed eyes closed I want you to think about the area in your life where you need to have more of Christ's character where you can still change and say God I need to change in this area of my life think about it if you don't know then you need to go to thinking because I'll raise my hands and says I know the things that I want to change I see where I need to change my character still when I need to let the Holy Spirit change it think about in your life what are you still doing what is it still where you need to change it do you have something raise it to him and say God I'm just still needing to change I'm still needing more of your character hands up all over the building God bless you God bless you I got mine up we're going to raise it all to Christ now Lord Jesus we come before you this morning Lord and we realize God that one of these days all Earthly Treasures will vanish your way Lord but there's only one treasure that we could take with us and that is our fellowship our relationship with you the character that has that we have the kind of persons that we have become because of the things that we have suffered in life that we have went through the kind of person that we have become is the only thing that we can take with us Lord and we ask God that we will be full of Faith Full Of Love full of patience full of long-suffering full of gentleness and meekness and love most of all one for another helping one another doing anything that we ever could one for another Lord living for the other person God I pray God this morning you'll take evening light Tabernacle changes more than what we even are this morning Lord father I know it's been a pastorally message Lord instruction but that's what God I believe God that it's your voice speaking God and I pray that you'll change My Heart Lord help me that I God help help our our husbands and our wives God if there's anything between him that they'll get things right Lord so their children are an affected Lord and Lord if there's families if there's friends whatever it might be God or take everything and put it under the blood God for we know Lord outside of the Holy Ghost we can't forgive we can't get it under the blood but Lord this morning we place our own faults and failures mind this morning God take it and put it in the sea of your forgetfulness Lord change my heart oh God and make it ever a true Lord we asked God this morning that you are continuing the changes Lord and you see those hands and every person Lord you seen when Thomas whatever they said that he's risen he's risen all disciples told him he's risen he's risen Thomas said I ain't believing it until I touch and put my fingers in his eyes the next time you showed up Lord you do Thomas's words you know what he said nobody told you but you heard him and he says now Thomas come here come put your hands in my side Thomas Lord you you have you know you have not seen yet you've not seen it and didn't believe and you believe now because you've seen but it's more blessed more blessed are those that have not seen yet believe Lord and we know that you know this morning every person God and the reason that they've raised their hands and the things that they desire to change and I asked God this morning you would give them Victory Lord they do allow them Father to change change is the hardest thing in The World God Only You Can Do father change your heart this morning Lord and make it every true God make it nothing but the character of Christ in our life Lord as we come close to the Rapture Lord the time of the going away father your bride calls to you saying God lord we have nothing we don't want anything else but your character in our lives so of course so let God when we come to that place we're ready to go Lord and father we many of us have already come through those places and the Lord You've mold as it is and you've shaped us Lord and we thank you Father for that we ask God above all we would never ask for trials and no things but we do ask for your character and you know best God we ask Lord did you chape us into your image then everybody under the sound of my voice I want everyone to be sheep saved Lord I want them all to be ready to be their lord and to meet you father than I ask in the name of Jesus Christ have him there Lord Grant it to me Lord in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you [Music]
