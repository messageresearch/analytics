[34:41] amen and amen we'll get right into the
[34:44] scriptures and then we'll uh amen just
[34:47] have maybe a testimony or two and then
[34:49] before we get started Zachariah if you
[34:52] will go to the book of Zechariah
[34:59] hey man we want to talk on a subject
[35:02] tonight that we will be talking about
[35:05] Amen in 10 000 years from now amen
[35:09] praise the Lord so tonight we want to
[35:11] talk about Grace amen well speak on
[35:15] Grace
[35:16] Zechariah 4
[35:22] amen a few quotes that I've pulled out
[35:24] of the message the prophet preached on
[35:27] and he used his scripture when he
[35:29] preached on the message of Grace amen
[35:32] and then I want to try to lay a little
[35:34] Foundation but Zechariah 4 1 and the
[35:36] angel that talked with me came again and
[35:39] wake me as a man that is awakened out of
[35:42] sleep I'm gonna move this down a little
[35:43] bit waking out of his sleep and said
[35:46] unto me what's seeth now and I said I
[35:49] have looked
[35:50] and behold a Candlestick all of gold and
[35:54] with a bowl upon the top of it and his
[35:56] seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to
[35:59] the seven lamps which are upon the top
[36:01] thereof
[36:02] and two olive trees by it one upon the
[36:06] right side of the ball and the other
[36:07] upon the left side thereof so I answered
[36:11] and spake to the angel to talk with me
[36:13] saying what are these my Lord then the
[36:16] angel to talk with me answered and said
[36:18] unto me know it's thou not what these be
[36:20] and I said no my Lord then he answered
[36:24] and spake unto me saying this is the
[36:25] word of the Lord unto zerubbabel saying
[36:28] not by might nor by power but by my
[36:31] spirit saith the Lord of hosts
[36:34] who art thou oh great Mountain before
[36:38] zeruba pulled out shall become a plane
[36:41] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[36:44] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[36:48] unto it amen may God add His blessings
[36:51] to the reading in the words you can be
[36:53] seated amen tonight
[36:55] amen just prayerful about what the Lord
[36:58] would want me to
[37:00] stay amen because I think a word in
[37:03] season is perhaps worth a lot more words
[37:06] out of season so we always desire the
[37:09] will of the Lord amen
[37:11] and so Amy I kind of got to thinking
[37:14] about the grace of almighty God Amen and
[37:16] how wonderful it is and so we uh was
[37:20] that went and visited our family down
[37:22] there was it the viewing down there or
[37:24] my uncle that passed away while we was
[37:27] going I got a call that my uncle had
[37:28] passed so we went to that viewing uh
[37:31] Saturday night a man got to talk to a
[37:33] lot of my families and relatives and
[37:35] different ones in my oldest first cousin
[37:38] which would have been uh Nevin Nevin was
[37:41] the name of the man that passed away he
[37:43] was 85 years old amen 85. and so his
[37:47] oldest son I go over the farm I got to
[37:49] talk a little bit about to his second
[37:51] second son I believe he was and he got
[37:54] to telling me about how that one he lost
[37:56] the two-year-old boy two-year-old boy 20
[37:59] 23 years ago he meant to a uh a combine
[38:04] accident I guess a horses ran away and
[38:07] he wasn't on it and he was his children
[38:09] were out there around that field and the
[38:11] one one little boy wouldn't come when
[38:12] his other sisters and brothers called
[38:14] him and so forth horses ended up running
[38:16] away and cutting the boy up real bad and
[38:19] and he was talking about how did the
[38:22] head went and got into uh Vanderbilt and
[38:25] how that they were there and of course
[38:26] they ended up losing him and I says you
[38:29] know what that's quite something because
[38:31] about 20 some odd years ago I remember
[38:33] being at Vanderbilt meeting my first
[38:36] cousins that were there and I've never
[38:39] before or after met any of my cousins
[38:40] that I know of at Vanderbilt and they
[38:42] said they were there I guess for their
[38:44] son I believe it was and so
[38:47] and I says I wonder if that was the time
[38:50] and that was pretty close to the time
[38:52] frame because it was Nevin's boy and
[38:54] child and I said you know it was kind of
[38:55] strange but I believe it was that same
[38:57] time I didn't know it but I didn't even
[38:59] talking to him and so forth about it and
[39:01] and then uh my cousin was telling me a
[39:04] little bit about his dad I didn't know
[39:05] him never well I know a lot of my others
[39:09] but there's a big Amish community out
[39:11] down there uh just down past hohen wall
[39:14] down there from Tennessee and and so
[39:17] come to find out that he had 16 children
[39:19] amen so I had 16 cousins that I had
[39:23] never once grow up you know as first
[39:26] cousins and so you know it just goes to
[39:28] show you how I have not gotten around my
[39:30] family and amen I've left my family
[39:32] pretty much you know years years ago and
[39:35] and anyway so I got to talk to a few of
[39:38] them there and he got to telling me how
[39:40] that he uh had 16 children and I said by
[39:42] the same wife and yes he was by the same
[39:44] woman you know so they had 16. and of
[39:47] course I already have 16 uncles and
[39:49] aunts that's just on my dad's side okay
[39:53] but a lot of those are half ants and
[39:55] half angles because he had eight by one
[39:57] mom woman and then eight by another so
[40:00] but it's anyway it's 16 and so I found
[40:03] just this one now this was a full
[40:05] full-blooded brother of my dad's Nevin
[40:08] was and um uh they said that he had six
[40:12] tuned children you know or 16 children
[40:14] and then he said he has 150
[40:16] grandchildren
[40:18] amen and uh so I'm believing that this
[40:22] is true and he had 300
[40:24] great-grandchildren
[40:28] so that's just by one of my uncles so
[40:31] that tells you a little bit about the
[40:33] relation I have that I don't know
[40:35] nothing about amen but amen I certainly
[40:38] you know and going back there and
[40:40] sitting in an old house you know
[40:43] sitting on the hard benches and shaking
[40:45] their hands and seeing my sister there
[40:47] and different ones you know it just
[40:49] brings back old memories you know of
[40:51] what it was like growing up amen and
[40:54] horse and buggy and uh you know the the
[40:56] staunchness of them and how they really
[40:58] don't change and so forth and you know
[41:00] it really your heart really goes out you
[41:03] know for him realizing you know that
[41:05] they're in that and believing that
[41:07] that's gonna it's gonna be what takes
[41:09] them to heaven and so forth and of
[41:11] course I asked my my first cousin the
[41:14] oldest one that's at the house he says
[41:15] well how was it with him and so forth
[41:17] and he says I guess it was all right you
[41:19] know and he had done a lot for him and
[41:21] he says I'm about it I'm sure he
[41:22] appreciated all that we've done for him
[41:24] but you know they they just kind of have
[41:27] a hope that you're gonna make it and so
[41:28] you really feel for them and I think
[41:30] about how that really you're watching
[41:33] all them little ones and all of those
[41:34] that are in that and if God don't do
[41:36] something to break you free from that
[41:38] most likely that's what you're going to
[41:39] be and of course once you marry and
[41:42] so forth and then you kind of get in
[41:45] ingrained in that and that's pretty much
[41:47] the course that you take but my heart
[41:49] went out to him to think about how that
[41:50] have that much relation and there they
[41:52] are to me trapped in a cage you can't
[41:56] get out
[41:57] don't realize what's out there don't
[41:59] realize the freedom that they could have
[42:00] the joy that they could have
[42:03] and have no Glimpse really of perhaps a
[42:05] lot of them even my cousins you know
[42:07] that they have never had a glimpse of
[42:10] this generation you know and I thought
[42:12] about how that it would sure be nice if
[42:14] I could take a bunch of books you know
[42:15] perhaps God sent a prophet and to South
[42:18] Africa life story anyway anything you
[42:20] could do you know for them you know but
[42:22] it's very hard because it doesn't take
[42:24] long once you get your foot in there or
[42:26] whatever the rumor will go around real
[42:28] quick you know that you don't listen to
[42:30] him and do this out of the other and and
[42:32] so forth but you know I just really feel
[42:35] for him and I've I kind of felt like
[42:36] Paul did talking about uh they're in
[42:39] Romans how that he wished himself a
[42:41] curse for his Brethren he loved him so

[44:23] amen
[44:25] amen by the grace of God we're in times
[44:27] past you walk according to the course of
[44:29] this world according to the prince of
[44:31] the power of the air the spirit did not
[44:33] worketh in the children of Disobedience
[44:35] among whom we also have had our
[44:38] conversation in times past in the lust
[44:41] of the flesh prevailing the desires of
[44:43] the Flesh and the mind and Word By
[44:45] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[44:48] others now I understand the prophet of
[44:50] God when he come along he says look you
[44:52] were not a child of the wicked one year
[44:56] or of the Disobedience but you just had
[44:59] their nature
[45:01] how many knows that because if you're
[45:03] actually a child of the devil there
[45:04] ain't no way you'll never come to it
[45:07] God could beg plead and do whatever
[45:11] you wanted to but you never desire you
[45:13] never want it
[45:15] amen just like Cain he didn't want it
[45:18] even though it was offered to him on a
[45:20] silver platter by God himself
[45:24] amen
[45:25] amen by the children of Wrath even as
[45:28] others all right we were my nature but
[45:30] God who is rich in Mercy praise the Lord
[45:33] I mean he's glad for his Mercy
[45:36] love mercy and Grace go hand in hand now
[45:41] brother bam said love and love and grace
[45:43] our twin sisters I believe tonight that
[45:46] Mercy is in there somewhere too
[45:49] amen cause love always produces Mercy
[45:53] mercy and Grace all go together and then
[45:57] even when we were dead in sins have
[45:59] quickened us together with Christ for by
[46:03] grace are you saved
[46:07] and as bases up together and made us to
[46:10] sit tonight in Heavenly places in Christ
[46:14] Jesus
[46:17] Christ amen
[46:19] Hallelujah
[46:20] he knows raised it up and made us to sit
[46:22] together that any ages to come he might
[46:25] show now notice that in the ages to come
[46:27] he might show the exceeding Riches of
[46:29] his grace in kindness to our us through
[46:33] Jesus Christ for by grace are ye saved
[46:37] through faith and not and that not of
[46:40] yourselves it is the gift of God
[46:45] praise be to God
[46:47] now notice
[46:48] if you'll notice here this headstone
[46:51] that we've already read a reading about
[46:52] in uh in Zechariah there was a headstone
[46:55] that that was to come this is what Madam
[46:58] says now right after reading those
[47:00] cerebral scriptures he says now we're
[47:02] all acquainted with this scripture that
[47:04] reads in the Bible we know that this was
[47:07] during the time of the preparation of
[47:09] the restoration for of the Temple
[47:12] was was a great Prince among the people
[47:15] who had laid the foundation of the
[47:16] building now I want you to put on your
[47:19] spiritual thinking amen anointing jacket
[47:24] this morning as we think and this great
[47:27] Prince had determined to rebuild the
[47:29] house of the Lord and then when he did
[47:32] he had laid the foundation stone
[47:36] and as we read further we find that at
[47:38] God that's rubable has laid the
[47:40] foundation with his hands he also shall
[47:43] bring forth
[47:44] The Headstone and then I want you to
[47:47] notice he never said that he shall bring
[47:49] forth the Cornerstone he shall bring
[47:52] forth the headstone
[47:53] and we know that the scripture said that
[47:55] Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone and he's
[47:59] also the headstone
[48:01] now it will think in it for a few
[48:05] minutes that the seventh church not like
[48:07] this
[48:08] praise the Lord because we can think we
[48:11] can read between the lines we can put on
[48:13] our thinking cap but when brother Venom
[48:15] explains it you don't have to do too
[48:17] much thinking anymore you know what he's
[48:19] talking about
[48:22] but we want to hear right not my
[48:25] thinking but we want to have the correct
[48:27] interpretation we want to understand
[48:28] what he's saying all right now that the
[48:32] Sabbath Church messenger was to restore
[48:35] the faith of the children back to the
[48:38] father there's in other words to rebuild
[48:40] the church again under the power of the
[48:44] spirit
[48:45] not by power nor by might but by my
[48:48] spirit saith the Lord not my
[48:50] organization not by denomination but by
[48:52] the holy spirit will bring forth the
[48:54] church in these last days now according
[48:57] to the prophecy there will come ahead
[48:59] Stone and one I want you to notice that
[49:01] when that headstone comes the prince is
[49:04] going to cry out the message will grow
[49:06] out Grace
[49:08] Grace Grace
[49:12] praise the Lord now notice when this
[49:14] capstone's coming how many knows this is
[49:16] a Capstone message
[49:18] this is the Capstone message and it's
[49:21] something that cries out in a million
[49:23] cries out in you that oh my oh my
[49:26] amazing Amazing Grace
[49:30] How Sweet the Sound that same Wretch
[49:32] like Me
[49:36] oh my
[49:38] Grace
[49:41] before we realize
[49:44] that God
[49:46] is the one that hands out Grace
[49:52] he gives it to whom he will
[49:55] to whomever he will
[49:58] oh my
[50:02] praise the Lord
[50:04] it's he's it's giving out Sovereign
[50:07] Grace
[50:08] now how many has heard that the meaning
[50:10] of Grace or what Grace is is Grace is
[50:15] unmerited
[50:16] favor
[50:17] with God
[50:20] in other words you don't deserve it you
[50:22] can't work for it you can't labor for it
[50:25] huh
[50:26] it's unmerited favor with God
[50:30] Grace is when you deserve to die but
[50:35] you're given lights
[50:38] you are a sinner you're lost you're
[50:41] undone but God picks you up and does
[50:43] something for you
[50:45] now I didn't go into all the quotes and
[50:47] things but you know that according to
[50:49] the prophet of God he didn't think it'd
[50:51] be a handful of people that'll make it
[50:52] to the rapture
[50:55] how many knows you read them and you you
[50:57] wonder if anyone would be saving you
[50:59] just Jesus said well I even find faith
[51:01] when I come back to the Earth
[51:03] I am and then he typed it he said you
[51:06] know according to Israel and when they
[51:07] came out and what they did is they came
[51:09] out two million strong and out of that
[51:12] original Bunch that went out only two
[51:15] made it
[51:16] now let me tell you those are uh what do
[51:19] you want to call an overwhelming
[51:21] inconceivable odds
[51:26] because I can't imagine a flood of
[51:28] people two million people and two people
[51:33] yeah
[51:38] had all these things but yet they all
[51:41] perished
[51:44] so brother baptized you take that type
[51:46] he says you killed go with one out of a
[51:49] million he says there's about a 500
[51:51] million Christians
[51:53] and if it was one out of a million about
[51:55] 500 people would go in the Rapture 500
[51:58] people left here and he says nobody even
[52:01] notice
[52:05] just a small number
[52:06] [Applause]
[52:08] Oh I thought about how that man you
[52:11] think about the people that are out
[52:12] there think about all the churches all
[52:14] the Amish world the Pentecostal the
[52:16] Baptist the methodists they think about
[52:18] all of those people
[52:20] who talks about how today would come in
[52:23] that day and they would say did we
[52:24] prophesy did we do this didn't we cast
[52:27] out devils and do Mighty things but he
[52:29] will say depart from me
[52:34] thank you
[52:39] oh my
[52:41] the time for meals and there's Millions
[52:44] but the Bible says there's millions and
[52:46] billions of mimics of Christianity
[52:50] so many people claim to have that Grace
[52:52] and no God but they really don't
[52:56] I want you to know something if you know
[52:58] and believe in your heart with all of
[53:01] your heart
[53:02] that you're a child of God you're a
[53:04] privileged person
[53:05] now I wrote down here what does it take
[53:08] to make you happy
[53:10] uh what does it take to make you happy
[53:12] as a Christian there's a lot of time
[53:14] people amen they want more knowledge
[53:16] they want more Revelation they want more
[53:19] uh you know understanding and a lot of
[53:21] times that knowledge a lot of times
[53:23] concept the Bible says it just brings
[53:25] Pride people want prestige
[53:29] they want to understand and know more
[53:31] even in the Bible next it talks about a
[53:33] certain group of people that they were
[53:35] always wanting to hear somebody else
[53:37] talk because they want to have more
[53:39] understanding of things
[53:42] then you have other people spiritual
[53:44] what that makes them happiest if they're
[53:46] standing in the spirit if they're
[53:47] speaking in tongues it's prophesying
[53:51] huh
[53:52] and that's what they like
[53:54] helps they like to dwell in the Realms
[53:56] of emotion
[53:59] is that right people like to be
[54:01] emotional
[54:03] that makes them happy they go on
[54:06] feelings other perhaps signs have enough
[54:09] Faith to move mountains or do spines do
[54:12] Miracles this out of the other
[54:15] but to me tonight
[54:17] what makes me happy
[54:20] is to know that I'm a son of God
[54:25] I was thinking doesn't the scripture say
[54:27] something about that you should be
[54:28] satisfied or with Grace
[54:32] you know Sonic Grace should satisfy you
[54:35] you should be settled with Grace
[54:38] amen
[54:40] Amazing Grace
[54:43] let me tell you something when I got to
[54:44] thinking about Grace it is absolutely
[54:46] amazing
[54:50] amazing
[54:52] praise the Lord
[54:54] Amazing Grace
[54:56] you think about it the Bible talks about
[54:58] Matthew 24.
[55:04] he says
[55:07] If any man come to you and say Lord here
[55:10] is Christ and there is Christ believe it
[55:11] not for there shall arise false christs
[55:14] and false prophets and shall sow great
[55:16] signs and wonders and so much that if it
[55:19] were possible it would receive the very
[55:21] elect
[55:24] how many knows we are living in a very
[55:27] deceiving age
[55:29] Revelation it talks about all who shall
[55:31] wander after the Beast they'll all be
[55:33] deceived whose names are not written in
[55:36] the last book of life from the
[55:38] foundation of the world
[55:40] right
[55:41] how many knows that tonight I want to
[55:43] say that Grace
[55:46] Amazing Grace
[55:48] brings you and it leads you to not be
[55:51] deceived
[55:52] [Music]
[55:53] because there'll be many people that are
[55:56] deceived
[55:57] I'm at least this message that God
[56:00] brought
[56:01] it's just don't take this Mark
[56:04] don't take it don't be deceived
[56:08] so my question to you tonight is how do
[56:10] you know
[56:11] you're not deceived
[56:14] well
[56:15] I got to thinking about that
[56:17] because you know you want to know you
[56:20] want to be sure about what you believe
[56:22] you want to be sure about where you
[56:24] stand
[56:25] for one thing the Bible says by their
[56:27] fruits you shall know them
[56:29] because we know that what did he say in
[56:31] Saul's in prison now and no no it was in
[56:34] 191 anointed ones at the end time
[56:36] remember as you know the Bible says the
[56:39] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[56:42] when you come to the Pentecost around me
[56:44] seeing this man sitting back there amen
[56:46] prophesied speaking in tongue and talk
[56:48] to Zion and so forth he come to pass
[56:52] and then he seen he shook his hand or
[56:54] something to see that he was living with
[56:55] a woman that he's not supposed to be
[56:56] with all messed up in his marriage
[56:58] limited sin
[57:00] and brother back to this truck or
[57:02] whatever and he says God how can this be
[57:04] I don't understand this
[57:06] God opened his Bible and showed him he
[57:09] says he says you know the rain falls on
[57:11] the just and the yeah
[57:13] what do we understand by the grace of
[57:15] almighty God he said he's got to go
[57:17] further than just your flesh
[57:19] it's got to go further than just
[57:21] speaking in tongues and being able doing
[57:22] all of that
[57:24] and having faith to move mountains to
[57:26] see the devil's cast out and all that
[57:28] he's got to go deeper than that
[57:31] It's gotta go all the way down to where
[57:34] It's gotta be down in your life cause
[57:37] your life is your soul
[57:40] you've got to be changed on the inside
[57:42] your very Nature has to be danger
[57:43] desires have to be changed
[57:47] and you're deceived
[57:52] if you know that God has come down and
[57:55] work in you and you know it's amazing
[57:57] grace is gonna make you the happiest
[57:58] person in the world
[58:01] cause y'all out of a million people God
[58:03] is Grace on you
[58:06] he asked
[58:09] the new Grace unmarily favor
[58:15] Grace never gets old
[58:17] [Music]
[58:18] even though brother Brown says it's as
[58:20] old as time
[58:22] why is it as always time because Grace
[58:24] is God because love produces Grace
[58:27] and God is love
[58:30] praise be to God
[58:32] aren't you glad
[58:34] I'm glad for Grace
[58:37] then I go back to my favorites my famous
[58:39] scriptures that I love so much
[58:41] John says behold
[58:44] behold what manner of love the father
[58:46] hath bestowed upon us
[58:49] Bill what matter of Grace that God has
[58:52] bestowed upon you that you should be
[58:54] called the son of God
[58:58] huh
[59:00] oh
[59:02] what great love
[59:04] ominous
[59:06] that God's grace and God's love
[59:09] looks to something
[59:11] before God just gives you Grace
[59:14] right before he just hands grace to you
[59:17] hands Mercy to you
[59:20] huh he don't do it to anybody anybody
[59:23] does it
[59:24] no there's millions that he don't
[59:28] over in Romans
[59:31] let's read here for a minute
[59:32] Romans 9.
[59:36] here is
[59:38] Paul
[59:40] certainly that's the scripture that came
[59:42] to my mind in the last week
[59:45] I say the truth in Christ I lie not my
[59:48] conscience also bearing me witness in
[59:50] the Holy Ghost that I have great
[59:51] heaviness and continual sorrow in my
[59:53] heart
[59:54] for I wish that myself would be a curse
[59:57] for Christ's sake for the brethren my
[59:59] Kinsmen according to the flesh who are
[1:00:02] Israelites to whom pertaineth the
[1:00:04] adoption the glory and the covenants and
[1:00:06] the giving of the law and the service of
[1:00:07] God and the promises
[1:00:09] amen man people will drive horse and bug
[1:00:12] and they'll live real strict all their
[1:00:15] lives because they think that's going to
[1:00:17] do something for them
[1:00:19] amen and according to denying of the
[1:00:21] flesh you think that surely God would
[1:00:22] get a hold of us
[1:00:24] you know and it was strange hearing from
[1:00:26] my my second first cousin the second one
[1:00:28] line of the 16 he says you know that day
[1:00:31] before all of this happened he said
[1:00:33] something
[1:00:34] told me
[1:00:35] something was going to happen today
[1:00:39] huh
[1:00:40] to hear something spiritual coming from
[1:00:42] them it's kind of different
[1:00:44] amen something was going to happen but
[1:00:47] he didn't know what and you know how he
[1:00:48] shook it off uh I don't know what it is
[1:00:50] and just go on you got to go on
[1:00:52] and he didn't of course he did
[1:00:54] all right whose are the fathers and of
[1:00:57] whom being at the flesh Christ came to
[1:01:00] whom who is over all God be blessed
[1:01:02] forever amen not as though the word of
[1:01:04] God had taken non-effect for they are
[1:01:05] not all Israel which are Israel praise
[1:01:08] be to God you know that was one thing
[1:01:10] that the prophet had to overcome man he
[1:01:12] had such a love such a passion for
[1:01:14] people and yet you know
[1:01:18] the last difference and everything he
[1:01:20] Continental word and they wouldn't do it
[1:01:23] got discouraged and wanted just to go to
[1:01:25] the mountains
[1:01:26] forget people
[1:01:28] huh
[1:01:30] you pretty much wanted to forgive people
[1:01:32] why because he was so discouraged
[1:01:34] because you put all that out and then
[1:01:35] nothing comes back and the people just
[1:01:37] just get it
[1:01:39] and he had to get his feeling back and
[1:01:41] realize you know not everybody's called
[1:01:43] he realizes not everybody's an eagle
[1:01:46] amen
[1:01:47] not everybody's blessed like what you
[1:01:51] and I are how many believe you're
[1:01:52] blessed
[1:01:54] if you're a child of God you are a
[1:01:56] blessed person
[1:01:58] folks I don't have to have great emotion
[1:02:00] I don't have to have this that or the
[1:02:02] other just let know that I am a child of
[1:02:04] God
[1:02:05] just let me know that I'm one of his and
[1:02:07] I'm Gonna Be Happy
[1:02:08] that's what makes me happy
[1:02:10] Amen on down these are because they are
[1:02:14] the Seed of Abraham are they all
[1:02:16] children but in Isaac shall thy seed be
[1:02:17] called that is they which are the
[1:02:19] children of the flesh these are not the
[1:02:21] children of God but the children of the
[1:02:23] promise are counted for the sea for This
[1:02:25] Is The Word of Promise at this time I
[1:02:27] will come and say I shall have her son
[1:02:28] and not only this but on Rebecca he goes
[1:02:31] right to another one Rebecca had
[1:02:33] conceived one even by Our Father Isaac
[1:02:35] for the children not yet being born
[1:02:37] neither having done any good or evil
[1:02:38] that the purpose of God according to
[1:02:40] election might stand not it works but of
[1:02:43] him that called
[1:02:45] so he was said unto her the elders Shall
[1:02:47] Serve the younger as it is written Jacob
[1:02:49] have a love and he so have I ate it
[1:02:52] where I'm going this evening is that
[1:02:54] disgrace
[1:02:55] looks back to the election
[1:03:02] Grace looks to election
[1:03:04] because God don't just give anybody
[1:03:06] Grace
[1:03:08] huh you really don't
[1:03:11] no
[1:03:13] you see how many knows God knows a man's
[1:03:16] heart
[1:03:17] he knows what's in man
[1:03:22] he don't make mistakes
[1:03:24] why do you think the people that claim
[1:03:26] to have the grace of God claim to know
[1:03:28] the grace of God
[1:03:30] they are the ones that make a disgrace
[1:03:32] if they don't really have the grace of
[1:03:33] God
[1:03:34] because the grace of God will clean you
[1:03:35] up the grace of God will make you do
[1:03:37] right live right amen
[1:03:40] and if it ain't God it's disgrace
[1:03:43] amen
[1:03:44] oh my
[1:03:50] all right let's go on what shall we say
[1:03:53] them verse 14. it's the unrighteousness
[1:03:56] with God God forbid he says for he saith
[1:04:00] to Moses I will have mercy on whom I
[1:04:02] will have mercy
[1:04:04] amen and I will have compassion on whom
[1:04:07] I will have compassion so it is nor him
[1:04:11] that about us but it's God that's great
[1:04:15] how many leaves that tonight
[1:04:16] praise be to God
[1:04:20] are you a recipient of his grace
[1:04:24] I'm not sure but it seems like the
[1:04:26] prophet of God said somewhere he says
[1:04:27] you know that I am a product
[1:04:29] I am a manifestation of the grace of God
[1:04:35] of the grace of God
[1:04:38] foreign
[1:04:41] Hallelujah aren't you glad to be
[1:04:43] associated with the grace of almighty
[1:04:45] God
[1:04:47] to think that there's billions there's
[1:04:49] Millions
[1:04:52] God could have chose beside you
[1:04:55] but if he picked you
[1:04:58] you are real special
[1:05:02] the most special thing you'll ever
[1:05:04] possess
[1:05:05] in this earth is to have the
[1:05:07] understanding to know that you are a
[1:05:09] child of God
[1:05:12] Christ be to God doesn't matter what
[1:05:14] else comes goes
[1:05:16] doesn't matter how horrible your death
[1:05:18] is
[1:05:19] as long as you know you're a child of
[1:05:21] God
[1:05:23] folks I was thinking today
[1:05:25] and I was looking at the clouds and the
[1:05:26] great creation that God has made and
[1:05:28] just enjoying it and I thought you know
[1:05:30] but this isn't even this real that's
[1:05:33] what it's like when you die and go to
[1:05:34] the other side
[1:05:35] that's what the prophet said it's more
[1:05:37] real over there than what this ever will
[1:05:39] be
[1:05:40] amen
[1:05:42] oh my Lord help us
[1:05:47] not him that will it nor him that runeth
[1:05:49] but it's God that shows
[1:05:52] Mercy I saw love mercy and Grace
[1:05:56] I saw love mercy and Grace
[1:06:00] that is so full of grace so full of
[1:06:02] Mercy
[1:06:03] I mean Lisa
[1:06:06] oh my
[1:06:10] God all right but that God just before
[1:06:12] he talks about Pharaoh even for this
[1:06:13] purpose if I raise the up so it looks to
[1:06:16] election God looks at election God looks
[1:06:21] at what's in you
[1:06:26] what's inside of you he knows what's
[1:06:29] inside of you
[1:06:32] what does that mean
[1:06:35] he knew you
[1:06:37] and what you do
[1:06:39] that you would have let's just be honest
[1:06:41] that you'd have that c Gene
[1:06:45] of God on the inside
[1:06:48] I mean please without that c Gene in the
[1:06:51] genetics of God
[1:06:53] a way that you'll ever come to the full
[1:06:56] surrender to God
[1:06:58] now you'll always be reserved somewhere
[1:07:00] that's why so many people can go so far
[1:07:02] with the word of God but can't go all
[1:07:04] the way
[1:07:06] huh because there's something wrong in
[1:07:07] the genetics something in the makeup
[1:07:10] praise be to God aren't you glad for
[1:07:12] that thing to think that God had Grace
[1:07:15] on you
[1:07:17] why do you think that as this headstone
[1:07:19] comes we have a better understanding
[1:07:23] better knowledge of what this The Riches
[1:07:26] of his grace
[1:07:27] isn't that what uh Ephesians said there
[1:07:31] all right
[1:07:35] verse seven that in the ages to come he
[1:07:38] might show
[1:07:39] exceeding Riches of his grace
[1:07:44] Amen in his kindness in Jesus Christ
[1:07:48] we've never understood even in front of
[1:07:50] God he could how can that man be such a
[1:07:53] hypocrite and still speaking talk

[1:10:54] testimony I'll be all right
[1:10:58] yesterday you know I was looking forward
[1:11:01] to it last last fall you know I did my
[1:11:04] audition and all that you know so I
[1:11:06] didn't have time to go out of the woods
[1:11:07] and just enjoy some relaxing time
[1:11:09] you know and so this year guess what
[1:11:11] everything's working out to where you
[1:11:14] know
[1:11:15] that we even got Mike and Mike and Grace
[1:11:17] out there and you know if we want to
[1:11:19] take him have them take care of our
[1:11:20] animals and go do something a little bit
[1:11:22] we can't praise be to God
[1:11:24] but anyway yesterday I was saying you
[1:11:26] know praise God everything's just the
[1:11:27] way I like it I'm gonna get to go to
[1:11:29] Juniors this afternoon hunt I got a few
[1:11:31] little errands to run I said life is
[1:11:33] great
[1:11:36] and I'll tell you what when I said that
[1:11:38] there was a thought with my mind I wish
[1:11:40] I hope you didn't hear that
[1:11:44] foreign
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:53] I got you know a hatch on the back
[1:11:56] wouldn't go up and he just wanted to
[1:11:57] fall down one fall down and hyped them
[1:11:59] hydraulic things are going bad you know
[1:12:02] so I says I'm gonna go to town anyway
[1:12:04] I'll just jerk one of these off and get
[1:12:06] a couple new hydraulic things you know
[1:12:07] but it wouldn't go up so I took the
[1:12:09] stick that's out to hold the hood up
[1:12:11] that metal bar and I popped that thing
[1:12:13] up
[1:12:14] now I got over here and I was taking one
[1:12:16] stick off
[1:12:17] and I popped that little hinge off there
[1:12:19] and all of a sudden when I did all the
[1:12:22] pressure was lit off when I took my
[1:12:24] screw and pop it off and it was way too
[1:12:26] much for my little thin stick over there
[1:12:27] it popped over there and the whole
[1:12:29] windshield crashed and smacked down over
[1:12:31] top of my head
[1:12:33] I had my hand up there in the crack all
[1:12:36] right it's not so swelled anymore but it
[1:12:38] come across there and almost completely
[1:12:40] crushed my hand
[1:12:42] and it would have but by God's grace
[1:12:44] it's somehow that just an angel of the
[1:12:46] Lord I believe help me just grab that
[1:12:49] lid before it goes any further because
[1:12:50] it was ready so bad it was swelling and
[1:12:52] hurting real bad anymore because it
[1:12:54] could have been really done some damage
[1:12:56] brother Tommy you know what it is like
[1:12:57] to have close calls
[1:13:03] too well
[1:13:05] praise God today she's going to get in
[1:13:08] your mind but anyway I said praise the
[1:13:09] Lord I said well praise God anyway Thank
[1:13:11] you lord for keeping your angels because
[1:13:14] I have a good hand today I it could have
[1:13:16] been cause he couldn't be much much
[1:13:18] worse but I thank God for watching over
[1:13:20] me
[1:13:22] and I thought you know that's just the
[1:13:23] devil and I thought they will talk back
[1:13:26] to me
[1:13:27] he says why you blame me for everything
[1:13:29] don't you think that was just your
[1:13:30] carelessness
[1:13:34] you should add something a whole lot
[1:13:35] more than a little old ride over there
[1:13:37] right I get the blame for everything
[1:13:42] oh well maybe I shouldn't blame you for
[1:13:45] everything I didn't see any wicked
[1:13:46] demons knocking that thing out and all
[1:13:48] of these other stuff maybe had nothing
[1:13:50] to do with it
[1:13:53] you know what I thought I had I had an
[1:13:55] answer for him this is what I told him
[1:13:57] no no if you were to cause Eve to fall I
[1:14:00] wouldn't have had this is it your fault
[1:14:05] I said it's your fault I said from now

[1:14:13] anything at all
[1:14:16] you get the blame
[1:14:18] and anything good that happens I'm
[1:14:20] crediting God for it
[1:14:23] oh thank you to God blame the devil

[1:14:29] bad if he wasn't for what he did any in
[1:14:31] regarding Choice oh his fault it goes
[1:14:33] right back to his head
[1:14:36] praise God but I thank God for Grace
[1:14:39] I may knows it was Grace he was he was
[1:14:41] bad but it could have been a lot worse

[1:20:11] wants to
[1:20:12] he can make the vile of Sinner clean
[1:20:15] let me tell you something right now the
[1:20:17] church and those prophets and so forth
[1:20:19] that were in the book of Acts whenever
[1:20:20] Saul was persecuting him
[1:20:23] even conscending to the stoning of
[1:20:25] Stephen
[1:20:27] huh
[1:20:29] taking people's thoughts while they
[1:20:30] stoned them
[1:20:32] what a cold-hearted mean person
[1:20:35] huh
[1:20:36] but yet God did what he reached down his
[1:20:39] hand
[1:20:40] even Paul said I'm the chief sinner
[1:20:44] why because he didn't just go out drink
[1:20:46] and smoke no he came after God's people
[1:20:49] and persecuted them even to the death
[1:20:51] you don't do much worse than that
[1:20:54] huh he was the violence he said on the
[1:20:57] word Setter but God realized I did it in
[1:21:00] ignorance
[1:21:05] he did it in ignorance

[1:21:11] of our blessings lay

[1:21:41] prophet in this generation
[1:21:42] that's you realize that should be to me
[1:21:45] that's one of the one greatest things
[1:21:47] you can tell in person
[1:21:53] ask this question what do you think
[1:21:55] about all these different churches
[1:21:59] claiming to serve the same God if that
[1:22:02] doesn't get their little mind going I
[1:22:04] don't know what will
[1:22:06] and then tell them that God has sent
[1:22:08] them Prophet to straighten it all out
[1:22:11] to let you know what is the right way
[1:22:15] and they have to choose whether they
[1:22:16] want to listen to you or not
[1:22:18] isn't that right then they have the
[1:22:20] truth well I don't believe God does that
[1:22:22] doesn't matter what you believe or think
[1:22:24] God did do it
[1:22:26] he did do it he said I sent you a lie to
[1:22:29] the prophet before the great deal is the
[1:22:31] grace of almighty God that pulled us out
[1:22:33] of those cages
[1:22:34] it's the grace of God tonight that
[1:22:36] you're not some certain denominational
[1:22:37] Church
[1:22:39] are you with me caged up
[1:22:42] the Bible says that dead become the cage
[1:22:44] of every unclean and hateful bird
[1:22:48] they're cages for the prime sister
[1:22:50] nothing but a bunch of cages
[1:22:53] he didn't have his farm

[1:22:57] why
[1:22:59] and deceived I mean those are deceived
[1:23:03] that's sad it's so sad but it's truth
[1:23:07] very few are gonna make it very few have
[1:23:11] their eyes opened you're a privileged
[1:23:13] person to understand you don't have to
[1:23:15] be Mennonite Amish Baptist Presbyterian
[1:23:18] Penny calls or any none of that you have
[1:23:20] to be a Christian
[1:23:21] [Music]

[1:23:24] evening light Tabernacle that don't do
[1:23:26] nothing for you
[1:23:27] huh
[1:23:29] no there's only one thing that does
[1:23:30] something for you only one thing that
[1:23:32] counts to you for anything and that is
[1:23:34] the grace of God and your relationship
[1:23:36] with Jesus Christ
[1:23:38] because our Prophet didn't point us to
[1:23:40] no church he clearly said it on the back
[1:23:42] of the tapes on the same he says I don't
[1:23:44] point you to a church I don't I'm not
[1:23:46] here to build a denomination
[1:23:48] start another church or another movement
[1:23:50] or this out of the other I'm here to
[1:23:51] bring man to a closer relationship with
[1:23:54] God
[1:23:55] how many of these side it was Grace to
[1:23:58] this generation they don't want that
[1:24:00] Grace but you and I do and I'm thankful
[1:24:02] for that Grace
[1:24:04] praise be to God
[1:24:06] it was Grace that saved me how many
[1:24:09] believe that it was Grace that called
[1:24:12] you it was Grace that elected you
[1:24:18] can't you see election
[1:24:21] that if God did something in your life
[1:24:23] you changed your heart change your soul
[1:24:25] change your desires
[1:24:28] and he's given you a fellowship with him
[1:24:30] that has told you that your name is on
[1:24:34] the book
[1:24:34] [Applause]
[1:24:40] everybody under the Earth on top of the
[1:24:43] Earth around the earth heard John scream
[1:24:46] her John praise God when he seen his
[1:24:50] name on the book
[1:24:52] he recognized who he was he found his
[1:24:55] true identity
[1:25:01] no my
[1:25:03] everybody heard him scream
[1:25:05] I believe it's John's a type of the
[1:25:07] church John's the type of the Bride when
[1:25:10] the bride realized who she is
[1:25:13] she can do the Greater Works
[1:25:17] because why
[1:25:18] it's not the chair
[1:25:20] she realizes him doing it
[1:25:25] I don't care what it is I don't care
[1:25:27] what my situation is
[1:25:29] amen it is God that is in control
[1:25:33] praise be to God that's how I want God
[1:25:35] in my life every aspect Lord I see you

[1:26:05] Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound
[1:26:08] that saved a Wretch like Me
[1:26:14] I once was lost but now I'm found I was
[1:26:19] blind and you still would be
[1:26:22] if it wasn't for the grace of God
[1:26:23] opening your eyes
[1:26:25] if it wasn't for the grace of God
[1:26:27] opening your ears
[1:26:29] you'd still be in the dark you'd still
[1:26:31] not understand
[1:26:33] you would be deceived amen because it
[1:26:36] would be so deceiving
[1:26:38] Matthew 24 24 says that if it was
[1:26:41] possible it would deceive the very elect
[1:26:44] Billy Graham I believe one place I'm
[1:26:46] made a statement he said it's so
[1:26:48] deceiving that even the elector being
[1:26:50] deceived brother Brown came back and
[1:26:52] corrected it
[1:26:54] praise be to God he says that's not what
[1:26:56] the word says the word says that if it
[1:26:58] was possible if
[1:27:02] it would only have to be worded just a
[1:27:04] little bit different
[1:27:06] it's because it says uh if it was not if
[1:27:09] but it could possibly deceive the very
[1:27:12] elect it is so deceiving that it can't
[1:27:14] possibly that gives it a possibility of
[1:27:18] happening
[1:27:19] but he says if it were possible
[1:27:22] hey man I'd be glad for that come on now
[1:27:25] hold your seat
[1:27:26] if it were popped it's not possible
[1:27:35] the light can't be deceived
[1:27:38] she's elected not to
[1:27:41] she's going to have her eyes open to the
[1:27:43] deception and say how many knows Satan
[1:27:46] Satan is coming in like a flood
[1:27:50] and it is the grace of God that holds
[1:27:53] you

[1:31:34] amen Amazing Grace
[1:31:38] God's grace is like this let me tell you
[1:31:41] a story in ending God's grace is like
[1:31:43] this one time there was a mighty king
[1:31:45] and this mighty king had a son and it
[1:31:48] was his only son and one day a murderer
[1:31:50] killed that boy
[1:31:51] and through that Kingdom when the
[1:31:53] delegates hunting for that murder and
[1:31:55] they finally found that murder and when
[1:31:56] they found him they brought back and
[1:31:58] imprisoned him and when they did it
[1:32:00] trial was set and the sentence was made
[1:32:02] oh it was a terrible thing he had
[1:32:04] murdered the King's son and he knowed
[1:32:06] but he was coming to him they put him in
[1:32:09] the inner cells locked him and locked
[1:32:10] the doors and put pads and so forth
[1:32:12] guards around it
[1:32:14] because we know what kind of a horrible
[1:32:15] punishment this was the boy was going to
[1:32:17] receive because he had killed the King's
[1:32:19] son the Royal King's son guards was
[1:32:22] placed all around the doors he was
[1:32:24] putting the Inner Cell stripped nothing
[1:32:26] but a loincloth and there he was set
[1:32:28] there in that condition starving
[1:32:29] wouldn't even give him nothing to eat he
[1:32:31] said in that condition and they brought
[1:32:33] him up to trial and he was found guilty
[1:32:35] and proven guilty and sentence was made
[1:32:37] and he was to be executed under horrible
[1:32:39] capital punishment
[1:32:42] he was to be killed by inches until his
[1:32:44] mortal life was gone sentenced by the
[1:32:46] judge and was to die and he begged and
[1:32:49] he cried and he says oh though I am
[1:32:50] guilty though I am guilty I am sorry
[1:32:52] that I did it I wish I had never done it
[1:32:54] I'm so sorry I did it in the moment in a
[1:32:56] rage of temper I did it I didn't mean to
[1:32:58] do it that way one day the king went
[1:33:01] down to the Palace to visit the boy to
[1:33:02] tell him talk him
[1:33:04] tell him about it killing his son ask
[1:33:05] him about killing his son the only son
[1:33:07] he had he killed that boy he says I'm
[1:33:09] going down there to talk to him and he
[1:33:11] went down there he looked back at that
[1:33:12] cage like a caged an animal he saw a
[1:33:15] little skinny body being there in a
[1:33:17] corner crying his face all sunk in this
[1:33:20] jaw sank back his eyes way back matter
[1:33:23] was all over his eyes and his mouth was
[1:33:25] Whited over no water thirsty laying
[1:33:28] there on his face crying and the King
[1:33:30] said stand up they come up to him he
[1:33:32] looked at him he says why did you kill
[1:33:34] my son
[1:33:36] what did my son do to you
[1:33:38] what did he do to Merit such a death as
[1:33:40] you killed him stabbing him to death
[1:33:42] with the spirit he said nothing my Lord
[1:33:44] not one thing just my own impotence just
[1:33:47] my own ways I killed him because I was
[1:33:49] jealous of him and I got in a temper fit
[1:33:52] and I killed him said I'm to die under
[1:33:53] the Earth Justice sir I realize and I
[1:33:55] deserve it
[1:33:56] only thing I'm crying for I'm just so
[1:33:59] sorry that I killed that Royal man like
[1:34:01] that Without a Cause
[1:34:03] and the King turned on his heels and
[1:34:05] walked out went back to the desk and

[1:34:10] forgetfulness destroy all the records

[1:34:29] Palace put the king's robe upon around
[1:34:32] his shoulder he said from henceforth you
