[12:58] good morning
[12:59] how y'all doing
[13:01] today y'all come to get ready to get
[13:04] fed I was on the way here and I was just
[13:06] thinking about you know the message of
[13:08] ours Jesus Christ you know and it said
[13:10] Jesus is that man that came down from
[13:12] heaven and I was thinking about you know
[13:14] brother Brad brother Tom all these
[13:16] ministers you know break the the Mana
[13:18] from Heaven the 1100 tapes yall break
[13:20] that bread you know we can't go back and
[13:22] listen to every one of y'all sermons but
[13:24] like Jesus did he breaks that bread
[13:26] gives us fresh Mana every day off tapes
[13:29] you know now because I was like I was
[13:30] just thinking about that this morning
[13:33] man you know it's so powerful but uh if
[13:41] y uh John
[13:57] 6
[14:02] then Jesus said unto them barely verely
[14:04] I say unto you Moses gave you not the
[14:06] bread from heaven but the father giveth
[14:09] the true bread from
[14:13] Heaven oh 30 32
[14:16] sorry what you say
[14:20] 6322
[14:26] sorry for the bread of God is he which
[14:29] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[14:31] unto the
[14:39] world and Jesus said unto him I am the
[14:41] bread of life he that hunger to cometh
[14:45] to me shall never hunger and he that
[14:47] believeth on me shall never
[14:53] thirst all that the father giveth me
[14:55] shall come to me and him that cometh to
[14:57] me I will no wise cast
[15:05] out and this is the Father's will which
[15:08] hath sent me and that of all
[15:11] which he hath given me I should lose
[15:14] nothing but should raise it up again in
[15:16] the last
[15:27] day and the Jews and they murmured at
[15:30] him because he said I am the bread which
[15:32] came down from
[15:43] heaven and Jesus therefore answered and
[15:46] said unto them murmur not among
[15:57] yourselves it is written in the prophets
[16:00] and they shall be all taught of God
[16:03] every man therefore that hath heard and
[16:06] hath learned of the father cometh unto
[16:16] me verily verily I say unto you he that
[16:19] believeth on me hath everlasting
[16:25] life your fathers did eat man and the
[16:28] Wilderness and our dead
[16:36] this this one together I am the living
[16:40] bread which came down from heaven If any
[16:43] man eat of this bread he shall live
[16:45] forever and the bread that I will give
[16:48] to my flesh which I give the life of the
[16:51] world brother B may be

[39:36] glad the Lord let Austin have Serenity
[39:38] so I get to see my buddy again it been a
[39:40] lot of years come ahead this morning
[39:42] brother Russell
[39:55] amen
[39:57] God bless you my
[39:59] friend good morning Saints God bless you
[40:02] Brother David asks me to sing every time
[40:03] I'm here and so today I said we worked
[40:07] late last night I said I thought about
[40:08] singing but I have a testimony so he
[40:10] gave me the opportunity to give you a
[40:12] testimony first of all I'm sorry to be
[40:14] so casual Brothers my dad didn't even
[40:16] let me wear jeans to school so this is
[40:18] really stretching it for me but but uh I
[40:21] came out on one of those
[40:23] $69 Frontier flights and but if you want
[40:26] to bring a sapcase it's another $69
[40:28] right so I put everything in a backpack
[40:30] so was just my work clothes so happy to
[40:34] see the tidwells haven't seen them for
[40:37] hope the kids still remember us we were
[40:40] they're our dear old friends and and I'm
[40:42] apologize ahead of time that I won't be
[40:44] here for service tonight my Ox is in the
[40:46] ditch and I didn't push him in the ditch
[40:49] to get him out on Sunday he's he fell in
[40:51] on his own and definitely have to work
[40:54] to to today till late
[40:57] uh because we fly out tomorrow trying to
[40:58] finish the electrical at Austin and
[41:00] Serenity's
[41:01] house
[41:04] so for the testimony I'd like to it
[41:06] could be a prayer request I'm in big
[41:08] trouble on my left knee here but really
[41:10] it is a testimony because in
[41:13] 1998 uh I was for mold injuries as a
[41:17] child I ended up uh blowing my knee out
[41:19] in 1998 I was on crutches for 6 weeks
[41:21] and then I ended up going in for knee
[41:23] surgery and serenity was 6 months old I
[41:26] had three boys so I had three boys
[41:28] Serenity was a little baby and uh when I
[41:31] went in for surgery when I came out of
[41:33] the surgery the doctor said that there
[41:34] was a lot of damaged cartilage and torn
[41:37] damaged and it doesn't apparently
[41:39] apparently won't
[41:40] repair so they cut it out so he said
[41:44] you're only going to get 10 years out of
[41:46] that knee so that was 1998 so just in
[41:49] the last few months I've had trouble
[41:51] with this knee it's been 25 years so I'm
[41:54] it's really a testimony I got 2 5 years
[41:57] out of a 10year KNE so I'm very thankful
[41:59] for that but I remember at that time it
[42:00] was an answer to prayer because there in
[42:02] 1998 when he said you're going to have
[42:04] 10 years and I wanted to hunt with my
[42:06] boys and I wanted to play sports with
[42:08] them and I know there's dads that can't
[42:10] but man I just besought the Lord Lord
[42:12] please let me be active with my with my
[42:15] boys and the Lord answered that prayer
[42:17] and it's kind of interesting to me
[42:19] because now 25 years later the kids are
[42:21] all grown and now my knees starting to
[42:23] to flare up again but it is testimon I
[42:26] got 25 years out of this 10 year near
[42:29] knee that the doctor told me so I'm very
[42:31] thankful so that's but really I realized
[42:33] I should be praying now Lord I got
[42:35] grandchildren that I'd like to play with
[42:37] and I'd like to go hunting with and and
[42:39] ask the Lord to answer that prayer but
[42:42] but I'm thankful for God's goodness amen

[53:26] I'm thankful to be here this morning and
[53:28] just count in an
[53:30] honor brother Bor I was talking with
[53:32] someone the other day and um he asked me
[53:36] where was I preaching somewhere this
[53:38] weekend I told him I was preaching at
[53:39] brother bers and he kind of laughed and
[53:42] he said the last time he saw you he's my
[53:45] age he's 46 or seven or eight uh he said
[53:49] it was in Virginia and y'all were
[53:51] playing football and he just remembers
[53:53] you were tackling everybody
[53:58] and
[54:00] 30s but um you still like look like you
[54:03] could do a few
[54:05] tackles still look like you got a few
[54:07] tackles in you amen I thought that was
[54:09] funny amen time just flies does it but
[54:13] you know when we're serving the lord it
[54:16] doesn't matter we just time flies and
[54:20] when it's our time to go home we go home
[54:22] but until we go home we're just going to
[54:24] enjoy this gift called life amen and
[54:27] just enjoy what he's given us amen if
[54:29] you have your Bibles let's turn to the
[54:31] book of Lamentations and we'll read the
[54:33] fifth chapter and we'll read a few
[54:36] verses we we'll read verse one through
[54:38] three and then we'll pray and you can be
[54:40] seated to to set the stage here the book
[54:44] of Lamentations
[54:46] is uh basically what had happened is
[54:50] Judah and Israel had split and Judah had
[54:54] Judah had fallen into ult idolatry and
[54:58] they had been overtaken by Babylon and
[55:01] the Book of Lamentations is said to be
[55:03] written by the Prophet Jeremiah and
[55:05] Jeremiah is considered the weeping
[55:07] prophet and if you ever read the book of
[55:10] re Lamentations you can understand why
[55:12] he was considered the weeping prophet
[55:14] because it just burdened him it brought
[55:16] such a sorrow so such a grief to see
[55:19] what had happened to Judah they had
[55:22] fallen into idolatry and once they
[55:25] fallen into idolatry they were overtaken
[55:28] by Babylon and the same pattern follows
[55:31] today when we F when we fall into
[55:34] idolatry when we fall into coldness sin
[55:38] creeps into our life When sin creeps
[55:40] into our life we even get colder it's a
[55:43] it's a cycle and this is the cycle that
[55:45] Judah was on and but I we want to read
[55:49] these verses and put that in context
[55:51] that this is just not some some language
[55:55] or some poems that the Prophet Jeremiah
[55:59] wrote but there was something that
[56:01] caused his heart to be so sorrowful that
[56:03] he's crying out to God one more time
[56:07] amen verse
[56:09] one remember oh Lord what has come upon
[56:14] us uh I'm sorry chapter 5 verse one of
[56:17] Lamentations remember oh Lord what has
[56:20] come upon us consider and behold our
[56:24] reproach
[56:25] our inheritance is turned to strangers
[56:29] our houses to aliens we are orphans and
[56:32] fatherless our mothers are as widows
[56:36] let's pray dear heavenly father we just
[56:38] thank you for another Sunday to come
[56:40] together we just thank you for the
[56:42] church here Lord and each one that has a
[56:45] burden to see others come closer to God
[56:48] that's what our desire this morning Lord
[56:51] that we'll leave closer to you may you
[56:54] just be with each one here and the
[56:56] different situations that arise in their
[56:58] life and we love you amen you may be
[57:01] seated I want to continue reading verse
[57:05] five our necks are under persecution we
[57:08] labor and have no rest verse seven our
[57:13] fathers have sinned and are not and we
[57:15] are Bor we have borne their
[57:18] iniquities I want to stop there because
[57:20] there's a good lesson to learn here sin
[57:24] is never
[57:25] isolated here uh the Prophet Jeremiah is
[57:29] saying we our have sinned not us but our
[57:33] fathers have sinned and we're having to
[57:36] Bear their iniquities and and that
[57:38] continues on especially fathers mothers
[57:41] we want to recognize that realize that
[57:44] the the the decisions we make could
[57:47] affect P future Generations that's why
[57:50] it's so good to bring our children to
[57:52] church and and create these habits these
[57:55] Godly
[57:58] habits that excuse me servants have
[58:01] ruled over us there is none that does
[58:04] Deliver us out of their hand verse 10
[58:07] our skin was black like an oven because
[58:10] of the terrible famine they ravished the
[58:14] women in Zion and the maids in the
[58:16] cities of Judah verse
[58:19] 15 the joy of our heart is ceased our
[58:23] dance is turned mourning the crown is
[58:26] fallen from our head woe unto us that we
[58:30] have sinned verse 20 wherefore does thou
[58:34] forget us forever and forsake us so long
[58:37] time 21 turn thou un us turn thou us
[58:43] unto thee yes I like how how Prophet
[58:46] Jeremiah said that it didn't he didn't
[58:48] say God come unto us but he said God I
[58:51] recognize the situation here I recognize
[58:55] the problem here it's not you God it's
[58:57] us so turn us back to you turn us back
[59:02] to you and you know sometimes in our
[59:05] life we need to be turned back to the
[59:08] North Star we need to be turned back to
[59:11] our father we need to be turned back to
[59:14] the truth because we all go through
[59:16] seasons of being cold and Jeremiah says
[59:20] here turn thou us unto thee Oh Lord and
[59:24] we shall be turned isn't it wonderful
[59:27] when God does the work nothing can stop
[59:31] it you say well I don't know if my
[59:33] family will ever serve God my children
[59:36] my parents if God does the work no one
[59:40] can stop it you don't worry about it
[59:42] don't have sleepless nights just put it
[59:44] in the hands of God because if God turns
[59:47] them to him no one can stop it no devil
[59:51] in hell can stop it amen
[59:55] but this is the part I want to focus on
[59:58] renew our days as of old renew our days
[1:00:04] as of
[1:00:06] old you know when we look at the words
[1:00:08] that we just read the word persecution
[1:00:11] came
[1:00:13] up uh the word mourning came up the word
[1:00:16] Joy had
[1:00:18] ceased they people are ruling over us
[1:00:21] this is how Jeremiah describes their
[1:00:24] situation
[1:00:26] but at the end this is what we want to
[1:00:27] speak on this morning renew our days as
[1:00:30] of old beginning of 2024 this is our
[1:00:34] first Sunday in
[1:00:35] 2024 let's not look back to yesterday as
[1:00:39] the good old days let's not try to
[1:00:41] recreate something we had let's just
[1:00:44] move forward and say God renew my energy
[1:00:49] renew my Zeal renew my passion renew my
[1:00:53] love for you as it was in days of old
[1:00:58] amen
[1:01:00] amen you know if you ever seen have you
[1:01:02] ever seen a bird that is missing a few
[1:01:04] feathers that looks kind of odd all
[1:01:07] right you know I used to have a parakeet
[1:01:09] when I was a kid man that bird was messy
[1:01:13] but uh that's beside the point but he
[1:01:14] was messy but anyway you know they they
[1:01:17] start they start getting to a point
[1:01:20] birds do where they can't fly as high
[1:01:23] they can't go as far
[1:01:25] it's a struggle for them to even fly a
[1:01:27] short distance so almost every year what
[1:01:30] a bird goes through is called a molting
[1:01:33] process and during this molting process
[1:01:36] they slowly not quickly but they slowly
[1:01:40] and intentionally pluck out the feathers
[1:01:43] that are
[1:01:44] damaged and then what happens is New
[1:01:47] Growth begin new feathers begin to grow
[1:01:51] and once those new feathers have grow
[1:01:53] have came to maturity flying is no
[1:01:57] longer a struggle they can go further
[1:02:01] than they could two months prior they
[1:02:04] can go higher than they could two months
[1:02:07] prior but what it took was a process
[1:02:10] called a molting process yeah and
[1:02:13] brothers and sisters we all go through
[1:02:15] seasons of life where we grow cold and
[1:02:19] what we need is to go through a great
[1:02:21] molting process time s in our life when
[1:02:25] we get so cold and we get so filled with
[1:02:28] anxiety and we become anxious what we
[1:02:31] need is just a slow down and let God
[1:02:33] begin to pluck up out the feathers amen
[1:02:38] we get so cold we're we're we can't fly
[1:02:40] as high as we could be we're not as
[1:02:43] Victorious as we should be amen we're
[1:02:46] not as joyful as we would be if we just
[1:02:51] allowed God to do the pucking allow God
[1:02:54] to take out those feathers that are
[1:02:55] keeping us
[1:02:57] Earthbound and allow New Growth to come
[1:03:00] into our life renew our days as of old
[1:03:04] Jeremiah the prophet cried out yeah amen
[1:03:08] and may that be our cry 2024 God renew
[1:03:12] my strength like as of the days of old
[1:03:15] renew my energy renew my joy renew my
[1:03:19] happiness amen life don't need to be a
[1:03:22] struggle brothers and sisters we need to
[1:03:24] quit talking about I just can't wait to
[1:03:26] leave God gave us this gift called life
[1:03:29] and until he's ready to call us home
[1:03:31] let's enjoy the
[1:03:34] ride
[1:03:36] amen
[1:03:39] amen CU when we start talking like that
[1:03:42] all the time I'm barely making it I
[1:03:44] don't know how I'm gonna get through
[1:03:46] another day but if you change how you
[1:03:48] look at things this is a wonderful gift
[1:03:51] from God he saw fit for me to be here in
[1:03:55] 2024 so why would I
[1:03:59] complain he he's he put me here so I
[1:04:02] might as well just enjoy
[1:04:04] it
[1:04:07] amen amen the prophet Isaiah said in
[1:04:09] Isaiah 429 he give giveth power to the
[1:04:13] faint and to them that have no might he
[1:04:16] increases strength yeah he does not me
[1:04:20] we're not strong within ourself we're
[1:04:23] not going to R any Devils by ourselves I
[1:04:26] don't care what people say we're not
[1:04:29] going to do it the Bible says flee from
[1:04:32] them the Bible says don't have anything
[1:04:35] to do with them you're not strong within
[1:04:38] yourself to to to beat any devil but the
[1:04:41] strength comes from God the strength
[1:04:44] comes from his promises the strength
[1:04:47] comes from
[1:04:48] him
[1:04:51] amen even the youth shall think and be
[1:04:55] weary so now it's speaking of the the
[1:04:59] the epitome of humanity the young it
[1:05:03] says even they will faint they will grow
[1:05:06] weary the young men shall utterly
[1:05:10] fail so even the epitome of humanity
[1:05:14] will fall naturally it only goes so
[1:05:18] far even the
[1:05:21] epitome of
[1:05:24] who we would consider great Giants will
[1:05:28] fall all right will
[1:05:32] fall without God right without God I
[1:05:36] don't place a lot of confidence in
[1:05:38] humanity I place my confidence in the
[1:05:41] Lord Jesus Christ he's never failed me
[1:05:45] he's never grown weak he's never lost
[1:05:49] his strength he's never lost a battle
[1:05:52] he's never been intimidated
[1:05:54] he's never lost confidence in his
[1:05:56] ability he's never lost confidence in
[1:05:59] what he promised thousands and thousands
[1:06:01] and millions millions of years ago
[1:06:04] before the foundation of the world he
[1:06:06] made the promise and he will keep it
[1:06:09] even if time stands to 2029
[1:06:12] 2042
[1:06:13] 2077 God is still on the strong Throne
[1:06:17] this morning amen don't you love
[1:06:20] him but they that wait upon the Lord
[1:06:24] shall renew their strength amen they
[1:06:26] shall Mount up with wings see there's a
[1:06:29] component here
[1:06:31] God God they shall run and not be
[1:06:36] weary even the young shall faint but
[1:06:40] they that wait they that wait David said
[1:06:44] in Psalm
[1:06:45] 51-12 restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:06:49] salvation he didn't say my salvation he
[1:06:52] said thy salvation it's all about God
[1:06:57] and uphold me with thy free
[1:07:00] spirit Samson cried in judges the 16th
[1:07:03] chapter and Samson Cried unto the Lord
[1:07:04] and said oh Lord remember me yeah I pray
[1:07:09] thee and you strengthen me I pray thee
[1:07:12] only this once oh
[1:07:15] God yeah Samson cried remember
[1:07:18] me you strengthen
[1:07:21] Me Prophet Jeremiah said renew me as of
[1:07:26] my days of
[1:07:27] old bring back God the things I used to
[1:07:33] hold so tight to me
[1:07:36] you that I felt was so precious But as
[1:07:40] time moves on we have this
[1:07:43] tendency to let go of those things that
[1:07:47] once kept us kept us brother Brandon
[1:07:52] said this he said I dedicate my life to
[1:07:55] him over his pull pit over his pull pit
[1:07:59] that one great desire in my life is to
[1:08:01] be more humble before God and before his
[1:08:06] people knowing that that's one of my
[1:08:08] major mistakes is having to deal with
[1:08:10] the public in such a way now notice what
[1:08:12] he says it took a lot out of me that
[1:08:15] used to be there it's taken a lot out of
[1:08:19] me he's praying he said his most major
[1:08:23] mistake was he was not humble he said I
[1:08:26] trust that God will restore again that
[1:08:29] Joy I once had all right not as I lost
[1:08:33] my joy but I mean I want more of it more
[1:08:37] humility to serve the Lord amen Jeremiah
[1:08:42] Isaiah sson David brother Brenham they
[1:08:46] they all cried the same theme and that
[1:08:49] is renew my days as of old when Samson
[1:08:54] with was in the Hall of gagon he knew
[1:08:57] what it was to be strong at one time but
[1:09:00] he had disconnected himself from God so
[1:09:04] he standing there and his mind begins to
[1:09:07] go back to those times when he had
[1:09:11] strength when he could fight the Lions
[1:09:14] when he could fight the Giants when he
[1:09:16] could slay many men at one time and he's
[1:09:20] standing there like a puppet and his
[1:09:22] mind begins to go back to what he once
[1:09:25] had yeah and he said God renew my
[1:09:29] strength as I once had renew me as of
[1:09:34] days of old yeah
[1:09:38] yeah thank you Lord Isaiah said the same
[1:09:41] thing David said the same thing all
[1:09:44] great men and women of God when they
[1:09:46] grew cold they went back to what they
[1:09:49] had yeah they went back to what had made
[1:09:53] them strong they went back to the
[1:09:56] absolute they went back to the anchor
[1:10:00] and this morning brothers and sisters if
[1:10:01] you're feeling cold on God if you feel
[1:10:04] like you've gotten to a season don't
[1:10:06] allow 2024 to be that way say God renew
[1:10:11] me as of days of old I admit I know I've
[1:10:15] grown cold on God I see it all over my
[1:10:19] life but God I'm just praying this
[1:10:21] morning my heart is crying out to you
[1:10:24] renew me as of days of old let me pick
[1:10:27] up this book and look at it with
[1:10:29] Wonder yeah oh let me listen to a sermon
[1:10:33] and just wonder and say God what are you
[1:10:36] feeding me this morning instead of oh
[1:10:39] I've heard this for 20 something years
[1:10:42] that's right it's not going to change me
[1:10:45] it won't change you with that
[1:10:47] attitude nobody can touch me I'm not
[1:10:50] changing well if you don't want to
[1:10:52] change brothers and sisters you're going
[1:10:54] to be left on the
[1:10:56] side cuz God is a transforming God which
[1:11:00] means somebody's got to change and it's
[1:11:03] not going to be God that's going to do
[1:11:04] the
[1:11:06] changing so somebody in that party's got
[1:11:09] to
[1:11:10] change so it might as well just be us
[1:11:15] amen
[1:11:17] amen has anybody ever heard of toys or
[1:11:19] us yeah when I was a kid it was a big
[1:11:22] toy store they had one in one out we
[1:11:24] didn't get to go well we got to go there
[1:11:26] some but we never got to buy anything
[1:11:27] there but we got to
[1:11:29] look uh it's so expensive but I guess
[1:11:32] that was part of the fun is just looking
[1:11:34] at what everybody else could buy but but
[1:11:39] anyway Toys are Us was considered one of
[1:11:43] the biggest companies in the 80s and 90s
[1:11:47] and their Heyday they had 1,600 stores
[1:11:50] 100,000 employees and 2000 and they
[1:11:53] signed a contract with Amazon to be
[1:11:57] their exclusive
[1:11:59] toy producer or or a toy the one that
[1:12:03] would everyone would buy toys from would
[1:12:04] be toys or us well of course as Amazon
[1:12:07] does they didn't really make good on
[1:12:09] that and they breached their contract
[1:12:11] and it ended up in court for many many
[1:12:13] years Toys R Us was suing Amazon for not
[1:12:17] doing their part of the
[1:12:19] contract but what happened in that
[1:12:21] lawsuit they lost Millions and millions
[1:12:24] of dollars fighting Amazon that these
[1:12:28] smaller companies came in and they begin
[1:12:31] to take a market share
[1:12:34] online but see Toys R Us was so fixated
[1:12:38] on taking Amazon down that they didn't
[1:12:41] realize they were going bankrupt doing
[1:12:44] it where am I going with that sometimes
[1:12:47] we get our eyes fixated on the wrong
[1:12:49] thing yeah we get our eyes on what this
[1:12:52] person's doing that church is doing or
[1:12:54] that person or that whatever more and we
[1:12:56] become so fixated that it becomes a
[1:12:59] distraction and that distraction keeps
[1:13:02] our eyes upon this person and then we
[1:13:05] don't see oursel growing cold we see
[1:13:07] everybody else growing cold but we don't
[1:13:10] see our s growing cold and we become the
[1:13:13] very thing that at one time we fought
[1:13:15] against and that is why happened to toys
[1:13:18] our us they closed their last store in
[1:13:19] 2018 because they went bankrupt because
[1:13:22] they became so stubborn that they were
[1:13:24] going to fight Amazon instead of putting
[1:13:26] that millions of dollars and creating an
[1:13:29] e-commerce website creating online
[1:13:31] presence and forgetting about Amazon
[1:13:34] they became fixated on their enemy that
[1:13:36] they were going to do whatever it took
[1:13:38] to win the lawsuit brothers and sisters
[1:13:40] some things are not worth
[1:13:42] fighting we need to pick our battles
[1:13:45] because some battles are going to wear
[1:13:47] you down down down and you're going to
[1:13:50] look back and I'm going to look back up
[1:13:51] my life and thought was that really
[1:13:53] worth it right that's right and see in
[1:13:57] life if we want to keep oursel warm and
[1:14:00] tenderhearted towards God we've got to
[1:14:03] realize some things are not worth
[1:14:05] fighting and some things are not so
[1:14:07] worth becoming fixated on yeah becoming
[1:14:10] hyperfocused on that we get our eyes off
[1:14:14] of this
[1:14:15] person this is the person I I mean I
[1:14:18] want all of us to make heaven but I sure
[1:14:20] want this boy to make
[1:14:22] heaven I want to walk the street I want
[1:14:25] to walk the streets of goat I mean I
[1:14:26] hope every one of us and I pray and I
[1:14:28] trust and I believe we're all going to
[1:14:30] be there but there's only one person I
[1:14:32] can change this morning that's
[1:14:35] me by God's help and God's grace so what
[1:14:39] happens is Satan gets us fixated on
[1:14:41] something it's like a little sore we
[1:14:44] begin to pick pick pick and it becomes
[1:14:47] bigger and bigger and bigger and then we
[1:14:49] look back on time and realize we have
[1:14:52] wasted so many years fighting the wrong
[1:14:56] battle when we could have spent that
[1:14:58] energy and that time on growing closer
[1:15:02] to God cu the closer we come to God as
[1:15:05] brother brandham said The more we start
[1:15:07] feeling sorry for our enemies the more
[1:15:09] we start feeling sorry for people that
[1:15:11] are not living right we're not going to
[1:15:14] change the
[1:15:16] world but let's just be Godly people so
[1:15:19] the people around us see something real
[1:15:22] and then they want to change they want
[1:15:25] to change let's be that light in our
[1:15:28] community amen I know it's simple but
[1:15:32] that's just kind of where I I
[1:15:34] live uh but you know if if Toys R Us had
[1:15:38] just went back to the basics they
[1:15:40] started in
[1:15:41] 1948 or
[1:15:43] 46 because they saw a need in the market
[1:15:46] for toy
[1:15:48] stores but by the 80s or 90s they were
[1:15:51] not willing to back up and go back to
[1:15:55] what made them what they
[1:15:57] were same thing with Kodak same thing
[1:16:00] with many other companies they got so
[1:16:02] fixated on on a one thing that they
[1:16:07] didn't realize the whole Market was
[1:16:09] changing like today you got these
[1:16:12] stores the Lego stores that create like
[1:16:15] an
[1:16:16] experience toy toys or us had the money
[1:16:18] to do those things but they got ran over
[1:16:23] by smaller
[1:16:24] companies because of their lack of
[1:16:27] having their eyes on the right
[1:16:30] thing you know sometimes to be renewed
[1:16:34] we got to go back to the
[1:16:36] foundation yeah you can perform you know
[1:16:39] I've learned as a song leader and as a
[1:16:42] minister you can perform the
[1:16:44] Motions right you can get through a
[1:16:48] service and you can go year after year
[1:16:51] like that you can do it as a late member
[1:16:52] you come to church you Clap the right
[1:16:55] time you amen but we don't we're not
[1:16:58] called to be
[1:17:00] robots yeah we're not called just here
[1:17:03] just to just to have a great service and
[1:17:05] everybody leaves
[1:17:07] empty but emotionally it was a
[1:17:10] 10 right but then everybody leaves
[1:17:13] feeling discouraged and still empty in
[1:17:15] their life and feel so cold from God I
[1:17:18] don't want you to leave that this
[1:17:19] service like
[1:17:21] that I'd rather shoot like a a shotgun
[1:17:24] where everything goes so many different
[1:17:25] ways and people leave and say God was
[1:17:28] here this morning I don't know exactly
[1:17:31] what he said but I I knew something
[1:17:33] changed in my life I've left challenge
[1:17:35] that God I want you to renew my days as
[1:17:39] of old yeah right you know one thing in
[1:17:43] life you know like look at brother
[1:17:44] Brandon when he was so transparent about
[1:17:48] he had he said I I've lost humility he
[1:17:50] said that was my major mistake he red he
[1:17:53] said I want to rededicate my life do you
[1:17:55] want to rededicate your life this
[1:17:56] morning I want to rededicate my life I
[1:17:59] want 2024 I I want it to be real and
[1:18:03] genuine with
[1:18:05] God Amen I want to look at the future
[1:18:08] with hope because my god holds
[1:18:11] it Amen brother Brandon did not have to
[1:18:14] share the expose this weakness in his
[1:18:18] life or that he was even rededicating
[1:18:20] his life he had preached enough sermon
[1:18:23] that when God came on the scene it
[1:18:25] didn't matter how he
[1:18:27] felt yes but as a human being like we
[1:18:30] all we want we want a true relationship
[1:18:35] with God yeah yeah not just word service
[1:18:39] not just good singing not all that but I
[1:18:42] want to know when I go to work tomorrow
[1:18:45] I feel
[1:18:48] God
[1:18:51] Amen he brother Brandon when he
[1:18:53] rededicated his life he was still
[1:18:54] preaching he was still traveling but he
[1:18:56] re recognized something in his life was
[1:18:59] a Miss yes he was doing the Motions but
[1:19:03] his heart totally wasn't in it so we
[1:19:05] want to separate it it's not about
[1:19:08] always doing the emotions but where is
[1:19:10] our heart
[1:19:12] today is our heart warmth by the word of
[1:19:16] God yeah are we overly critical or we
[1:19:19] feel like nothing is going right in our
[1:19:21] life we all have the Seasons but we want
[1:19:24] to recognize it and say God renew my
[1:19:27] days as of
[1:19:29] old you know one thing I don't like
[1:19:31] doing is turning around when I'm
[1:19:34] driving I hate turning
[1:19:36] around oh it's I'd rather go out of the
[1:19:39] way than turn around and that's what
[1:19:41] happened when we were in Canada a few
[1:19:43] years ago I was preaching in Canada we
[1:19:46] left we you know I told everybody after
[1:19:49] church we got to get on the road we're
[1:19:50] trying to get so far tonight and I took
[1:19:53] a wrong turn you know I I left now I was
[1:19:56] trying to make everything quick so we
[1:19:57] could get home in a decent time and I
[1:19:59] took a wrong turn and
[1:20:03] uh I believe my helpmate noticed it she
[1:20:07] tends to notice those things first in in
[1:20:11] our car so I won't where's she at maybe
[1:20:15] she's in the bathroom so I can keep
[1:20:19] talking it's always kind of a running
[1:20:22] joke cuz when she don't travel with me
[1:20:24] as much she used to so I I get a little
[1:20:26] bit more Liberty when she's not with us
[1:20:29] but this morning she's she's with us
[1:20:31] somewhere there she is yes yes how you
[1:20:34] doing this
[1:20:36] morning but she she noticed that we were
[1:20:39] we were on the wrong road but I was
[1:20:41] determined that we were not turning
[1:20:43] around so it took us extra three or four
[1:20:47] hours because I did not want to turn
[1:20:50] around because I hate turning around and
[1:20:53] I even can spin it in a positive way
[1:20:55] well at least we get to try a new way to
[1:20:56] go home I mean we're getting to see new
[1:20:59] things that we would never seen and then
[1:21:01] I can even
[1:21:03] spiritualize it well it must just been
[1:21:05] God's
[1:21:06] will you know you can spiritualize about
[1:21:09] anything right that's right but it end
[1:21:12] up costing us about three or four hours
[1:21:14] because I would not turn around and you
[1:21:16] know in life a lot of times there's
[1:21:18] warning
[1:21:19] signs yes and we just need to do a
[1:21:21] u-turn yeah and just mid up to it say
[1:21:25] God I'm cold cuz I've got on the wrong
[1:21:28] road yeah I'm cold because I've allowed
[1:21:31] things in my life or my home that are
[1:21:33] not pleasing to you I'm cold because
[1:21:36] every time the church doors are open I
[1:21:38] have an excuse for not
[1:21:40] going I'm cold because I've became
[1:21:43] critical of everybody in the church or
[1:21:45] everybody around me nobody does anything
[1:21:48] right and all these things begin to drip
[1:21:51] coldness into to our
[1:21:54] life amen instead sometimes we just need
[1:21:57] a mitt up God I'm cold I got to do a
[1:22:00] U-turn because I want you to renew me as
[1:22:04] of my days of old as my days of
[1:22:07] old because what keeps us a lot of times
[1:22:10] from turning around is is
[1:22:13] pride Proverbs 29:23 man's Pride shall
[1:22:18] bring him
[1:22:20] lowow a man's Pride shall bring him low
[1:22:24] pride is a destroyer it destroys
[1:22:27] countries it destroys families destroys
[1:22:31] churches businesses
[1:22:33] individuals it's a little felter word
[1:22:36] called Pride because it's often the
[1:22:39] block that keeps us from going
[1:22:42] back have you ever been in a discussion
[1:22:45] with your
[1:22:46] spouse and you know they're
[1:22:49] right but you keep digging a hole
[1:22:54] again I'm going to use that word
[1:22:55] spiritualize justify and you keep
[1:22:58] digging a hole because that little five
[1:23:01] letter word called Pride you just don't
[1:23:03] want to admit or I don't want to admit
[1:23:06] they're right that felter word keeps us
[1:23:09] from our Keeps Us
[1:23:12] cold keeps us from being renewed from
[1:23:14] God yeah God is
[1:23:17] willing God the Bible says is
[1:23:19] longsuffering he's willing but this
[1:23:22] felter word keeps us from from um from
[1:23:27] going back and saying God I just need
[1:23:30] help I am in a a situation that I got
[1:23:34] myself into nobody else did but I did
[1:23:37] and I need your grace and mercy to help
[1:23:39] me do a U-turn and get back on track
[1:23:43] that's right have you ever stood against
[1:23:45] something or fought so hard against
[1:23:48] something or for something all right but
[1:23:51] you know in your heart you're only stand
[1:23:54] Standing for or against it because of
[1:23:58] tradition you know down deep that you're
[1:24:02] and you got your scriptures you got your
[1:24:05] quotes but you know down deep that this
[1:24:08] is just a personal
[1:24:10] conviction nothing
[1:24:12] more you know the longer you
[1:24:15] live and quite a few of us can testify
[1:24:19] you realize that a lot of things we hope
[1:24:22] hold so dear to is nothing more than
[1:24:25] just personal
[1:24:26] convictions right it
[1:24:29] is read questions and answers and how
[1:24:31] many times brother brandham said I don't
[1:24:34] know he would say I don't know because
[1:24:36] he said I can't support it with
[1:24:41] this what a humility I I mean he could
[1:24:45] have spend something he could have made
[1:24:46] an answer up and everybody would have
[1:24:48] went with it I I I started counting it
[1:24:51] one time because I was just amazed how
[1:24:53] sometimes as a minister you feel like
[1:24:55] you got to know the
[1:24:56] answers but it's okay I don't
[1:24:59] know I don't
[1:25:01] know he said that quite frequently in
[1:25:03] questions and answers when there was a
[1:25:05] lot of questions asked he'd even
[1:25:08] sometimes say well this is what my
[1:25:09] opinion but I just don't know right so
[1:25:13] these things that that we hold so so so
[1:25:16] dear grow and we this what this is what
[1:25:19] happens we begin to stand up for him we
[1:25:23] begin to spend all our passion our
[1:25:26] energy our joy for fighting for
[1:25:29] something that if we just sit there and
[1:25:31] thought about it and prayed about it
[1:25:32] realize this is just my personal
[1:25:35] conviction and then focus our time our
[1:25:39] energy and our strength and everything
[1:25:41] else about Lord I just want to be right
[1:25:43] with you I just want to be right with
[1:25:46] you if there's something in my life
[1:25:47] that's is wrong you take it out somebody
[1:25:50] don't need to fight me about it somebody
[1:25:53] don't have to get angry but God you send
[1:25:55] people in there that really love me that
[1:25:58] that really want to see me change and
[1:26:00] help me to have a heart that is open to
[1:26:03] change so you can renew my strength as
[1:26:06] of days of
[1:26:08] [Applause]
[1:26:09] old oh those days of old when our hearts
[1:26:13] were so tender and if we found out
[1:26:15] something wasn't pleasing to God we just
[1:26:17] got rid of it yeah those days of old
[1:26:21] where there was a joy and there was a
[1:26:23] Zeal and there was an excitement for
[1:26:24] serving God those days of old where we
[1:26:28] thought God could come back at any time
[1:26:31] yeah see the Prophet Jeremiah realized
[1:26:35] Judah got off track because they got
[1:26:37] their eyes off that Simplicity of God
[1:26:41] just serving God day by day just Monday
[1:26:44] when you're at work you're serving God
[1:26:47] when things go wrong and you lose your
[1:26:49] temper you apologize and you go on
[1:26:51] sering in God when things don't go the
[1:26:54] way you thought they would go in your
[1:26:56] life you still just serve God when you
[1:26:59] don't understand what you're going
[1:27:01] through you still just serve God you cry
[1:27:04] out like Jeremiah renew my days as of
[1:27:08] old God I don't understand everything I
[1:27:11] go through God I don't even like
[1:27:13] everything I go through but I'm just
[1:27:15] putting my confidence in your
[1:27:19] word amen
[1:27:23] oh God help me we bring a lot of junk
[1:27:26] into our relationship with God we bring
[1:27:29] a lot of our past into our walk with the
[1:27:31] Lord we bring a lot of our tradition in
[1:27:33] our walk with the Lord and we become
[1:27:35] fixated on those things instead of
[1:27:37] coming fixated upon just the word of God
[1:27:40] and say God in a tender heart and
[1:27:42] humility change me oh God will you see I
[1:27:45] need changed
[1:27:48] yeah you know Jeremiah could have said I
[1:27:50] am a prophet I've already warned
[1:27:54] Judah but in
[1:27:56] humility he did not say renew their days
[1:27:59] of old he said renew our days as of old
[1:28:04] he put himself in there he put himself
[1:28:07] in there and that's what a Believer
[1:28:09] does they put their self where the
[1:28:12] battle is if another brother or sister's
[1:28:14] down they put theirself with
[1:28:16] them they don't care how it looks to
[1:28:20] other
[1:28:20] people or what people will say no they
[1:28:24] are there because they they want to see
[1:28:27] everyone have a walk with the Lord and I
[1:28:30] understand sometimes we have to cut ties
[1:28:32] for different reason I'm not saying that
[1:28:34] but I'm saying if our motive for not
[1:28:36] helping someone because we're afraid
[1:28:37] someone GNA think we look bad or weird
[1:28:40] that's a very shallow
[1:28:42] motive very shallow you know the other
[1:28:45] night
[1:28:47] um we were talking about some of our
[1:28:50] kids that all teenagers now but we were
[1:28:53] talking about when they had imaginary
[1:28:56] friends it's quite an interesting
[1:28:59] conversation uh I won't name any
[1:29:03] names but one of our
[1:29:07] kids I'll say they I won't say he or she
[1:29:10] but I'll say they they had an imaginary
[1:29:14] friend that actually we were flying
[1:29:16] somewhere that imaginary friend sit on
[1:29:19] the wing of the plane the whole trip and
[1:29:22] they saw it I mean it was like real they
[1:29:26] they saw him on the The Wing of the the
[1:29:28] the plane and and they watched him take
[1:29:31] off and everything else and they had
[1:29:33] this imaginary friend and what but what
[1:29:35] it got me thinking is how when we were
[1:29:37] kids we just enjoyed our
[1:29:40] life but then there's something about
[1:29:42] adulthood that brings calluses a
[1:29:46] hardness yeah but then my Jesus said
[1:29:49] come as little children yeah he said
[1:29:53] come as little children little children
[1:29:55] just enjoy their life they put their
[1:29:57] confidence in their parents none of my
[1:30:00] kids have ever came up to me said are we
[1:30:01] going to get to eat tomorrow they just
[1:30:04] accept the fact that there's going to be
[1:30:06] food they don't
[1:30:07] worry and then my Jesus said you know
[1:30:10] you come to me as a little child he went
[1:30:12] far to say you can't even make it into
[1:30:14] the Kingdom of Heaven unless you come as
[1:30:15] a little child so what is it that a
[1:30:18] little child has that us adults don't
[1:30:20] have does any of you little children
[1:30:23] want to speak up and tell us what you
[1:30:24] have that we don't have because we need
[1:30:27] what you
[1:30:28] got According To
[1:30:31] Jesus what they have is they just
[1:30:34] approach life with a
[1:30:37] wonder they approach life with faith and
[1:30:40] confidence in their parents' ability yes
[1:30:44] they don't sit up at night worrying if
[1:30:47] breakfast will be on the
[1:30:50] table they know when they come home from
[1:30:52] a hard day that they got their home to
[1:30:55] come
[1:30:56] to yes and all that creates a security
[1:31:01] in their
[1:31:03] life and for
[1:31:06] us we lose that with our walk with the
[1:31:10] Lord we sit up all night fretting and
[1:31:14] worried when God said I gave the birds a
[1:31:18] place to sleep yeah I'm going to take
[1:31:21] care of you
[1:31:22] right and we will stay up all night
[1:31:25] tossing and turning we all
[1:31:28] do throughout the day it will be the
[1:31:30] only thing that hits our mind some huge
[1:31:32] problem we're going through when God
[1:31:35] said I'll never leave you or forsake you
[1:31:37] yeah that's what our father
[1:31:40] said so we need if we want to renew our
[1:31:44] days of old we need to come back to that
[1:31:47] childlike
[1:31:48] faith I'm just going to accept you God
[1:31:51] for who you are and what you
[1:31:54] said I'm going to quit trying to figure
[1:31:56] everything out and just
[1:32:00] accept my kids have never sat down while
[1:32:03] we did bills and did bills with
[1:32:06] us now they they might have known times
[1:32:09] when things are a little bit more
[1:32:10] tighter but they've never sat down and
[1:32:13] done the bills with
[1:32:14] us except the fact that the house
[1:32:17] payment will be
[1:32:19] paid if we could just take this
[1:32:22] book and really apply it to our life
[1:32:26] when he said come as a little child if
[1:32:29] this morning we could come as a little
[1:32:30] child if you need
[1:32:32] healing just come as a little
[1:32:35] child it might you might say
[1:32:40] well what I have is very serious and
[1:32:43] that that's
[1:32:45] understandable but still come just as a
[1:32:47] little child and then let God determine
[1:32:50] how he's going to work it all out
[1:32:52] but God I'm just doing my part you said
[1:32:55] come as a little child just childlike
[1:32:58] Faith yeah childlike
[1:33:00] Wonder childlike
[1:33:03] believing amen I I was thinking of that
[1:33:07] you know a lot of times as adults we
[1:33:11] lose that we lose that in life just in
[1:33:14] life in general we become where we
[1:33:17] become very cynical very critical very
[1:33:19] callous I don't want that my life and if
[1:33:23] it's there I want God to remove it I
[1:33:26] want to approach 2024 and I challenge
[1:33:29] you this morning as God this is a
[1:33:32] gift I can't control what's in
[1:33:34] Washington but I'm not going to allow it
[1:33:36] to get my blood pressure
[1:33:38] up I can't even control what's going on
[1:33:41] in my little city and sometimes I feel
[1:33:43] like I can't even control what's going
[1:33:45] on in my
[1:33:47] house but God I'm just depending on you
[1:33:51] God I just want to come as a little
[1:33:53] child because I know you said the
[1:33:56] Prophet Jeremiah said renew me as of the
[1:33:59] days of
[1:34:00] old I want you to renew me as a child I
[1:34:04] want you to give me the strength to wake
[1:34:06] up in the morning and say this is going
[1:34:09] to be a wonderful day because this is
[1:34:11] the day that the Lord ha
[1:34:13] made
[1:34:15] amen hallelujah I don't care if it's
[1:34:19] Monday
[1:34:20] morning that's right
[1:34:22] don't go to work Monday morning said
[1:34:24] well it's just another Monday it will be
[1:34:26] just another Monday saying No this
[1:34:28] Monday God made God made this Monday and
[1:34:33] if God made this Monday I don't want to
[1:34:35] Grumble about it I want to say God just
[1:34:38] help me renew my days as of old help me
[1:34:43] to accept
[1:34:45] you
[1:34:47] amen
[1:34:50] amen let's look at humility and then
[1:34:52] we'll close in a few moments brother
[1:34:55] bernham said I've leaned heavy on the
[1:34:58] signpost and them he was talking about
[1:35:01] discernment he said Lord you show me
[1:35:04] about this for I pray for them cuz I
[1:35:07] don't know what I might do basically
[1:35:10] he's saying he's having a hard time
[1:35:11] having faith without God showing him
[1:35:13] what's going to happen he said how cruel
[1:35:16] that was I asked the congregation to
[1:35:20] forgive me
[1:35:21] the congregation of the world that's
[1:35:24] listening to this tape forgive me I was
[1:35:27] wrong I should have never carried it out
[1:35:30] like that that wasn't his Commission in
[1:35:32] the first place that was a sign pointing
[1:35:35] to the commission I should have prayed
[1:35:37] for the sick
[1:35:39] everywhere what he was saying God just
[1:35:42] renew me as of my days of old I got a
[1:35:45] little off track but God take me back
[1:35:49] take me back now Wonder let's just role
[1:35:52] play Here For a Moment wonder if he had
[1:35:54] so much pride he couldn't admit that
[1:35:56] this is what has happened in his life he
[1:36:00] would got further and further away from
[1:36:03] God and brothers and sisters that's when
[1:36:06] I'm talking about that Pride it it it
[1:36:09] takes us further away from
[1:36:10] God instead of just saying Adit
[1:36:13] admitting it I was
[1:36:15] wrong I was thinking in my own life a
[1:36:18] few years ago I was preaching somewhere
[1:36:20] and I I sit word from the pull pit that
[1:36:23] I didn't really think was
[1:36:25] bad but it could be I'm not going to say
[1:36:28] it cuz now I would feel bad saying
[1:36:31] it but anyway so I get I I I get a
[1:36:34] letter from a brother from that church
[1:36:36] and and he was nice and kind about it he
[1:36:40] he I could tell what he's getting to
[1:36:42] because he wrote this long letter and
[1:36:43] then he finally got to it he I just
[1:36:45] think you should not have used that word
[1:36:47] from the pull
[1:36:48] pit and and I so I called him up and he
[1:36:53] W he he's such a nice person matter of
[1:36:55] fact he we still talk from time to time
[1:36:59] and write letters he's a wonderful
[1:37:01] brother and he was just so kind and such
[1:37:05] a humility how he told me that he
[1:37:08] thought I was wrong so so I apologized
[1:37:10] and said well you know you might be
[1:37:12] right but you know I say that to say
[1:37:16] this that could have easily got off
[1:37:18] track very easy if we both had allowed
[1:37:22] Pride to get
[1:37:24] involved and there are times I've
[1:37:26] allowed pride and it's gotten off track
[1:37:28] yeah but this time by God's grace he
[1:37:31] gave me enough wisdom not to use pride
[1:37:34] and and I told him I said brother you
[1:37:35] might be right I apologize I shouldn't
[1:37:37] have probably said that from the pull
[1:37:39] pit and and he even apologized for even
[1:37:41] bringing it up he felt bad we were both
[1:37:45] apologizing but the thing is see pride
[1:37:48] can cause those just that little issue
[1:37:53] just that little issue could have been
[1:37:54] every time I go to that church I I was
[1:37:56] dodging him to preach and I don't want
[1:37:59] that right I don't want that in my life
[1:38:01] I don't want to go places where I have
[1:38:03] to dodge
[1:38:04] people I just want to be friends with
[1:38:06] everybody that comes my way and by God's
[1:38:08] grace may he just bless your life yeah
[1:38:11] but that little thing could have caused
[1:38:13] you know if Pride had risen and look in
[1:38:15] your own life we sometimes we fa at that
[1:38:19] and then we look back and wonder why
[1:38:21] this relationship or this thing went so
[1:38:23] off track a lot of times if you look
[1:38:25] back at something
[1:38:28] small as we get ready to close brother
[1:38:30] brandham shares a wonderful story that
[1:38:32] is a great example a couple's getting a
[1:38:35] divorce and they're going through the
[1:38:37] whole house arguing over
[1:38:40] everything this is mine and she say no
[1:38:43] it's mine they did that for hours then
[1:38:46] they got up in the attic and they're
[1:38:48] fighting over every single thing in the
[1:38:50] house they just couldn't stand each
[1:38:52] other they
[1:38:54] thought they get up in the attic and
[1:38:57] they come to a little pair of baby shoes
[1:38:58] and they both grabbed for
[1:39:00] them and they realized that neither one
[1:39:03] of them could claim honestly that it was
[1:39:07] theirs the story behind it it was a baby
[1:39:10] that they had lost when this little girl
[1:39:13] was just an
[1:39:15] infant and at that
[1:39:17] time they
[1:39:20] cried they fell into each other's
[1:39:22] arms and they decide not to get a
[1:39:26] divorce praise the Lord you know in
[1:39:29] life brother Brenham said it this way
[1:39:32] let me f he said he said it like this
[1:39:36] and and listen to it and then we'll
[1:39:38] apply it to the story he said look at
[1:39:41] he's talking about growing cold on God
[1:39:43] look at what you once were in your heart
[1:39:47] and mind and in your life think go back
[1:39:51] to it yeah look at what you were in your
[1:39:55] heart and mind and your life then go
[1:39:59] back to
[1:40:02] it in the Book of Revelations it
[1:40:05] says the Church of Ephesus that church
[1:40:08] age John said nevertheless or Jesus said
[1:40:11] nevertheless I have someone against thee
[1:40:13] because thou Hast left thy First Love he
[1:40:16] said remember therefore from whence Thou
[1:40:18] Are Falling remember and then he says
[1:40:21] repent and do the first Works remember
[1:40:25] repent do the first Works remember
[1:40:28] repent and do the first works when they
[1:40:31] were in the Attic they
[1:40:32] remembered they fell in each other's
[1:40:34] arms and they
[1:40:36] repented and then they went back to
[1:40:39] their first
[1:40:41] love those shoes brought back a
[1:40:45] memory and that memory made them
[1:40:48] recognize that they had loud Pride to
[1:40:50] get between them then they
[1:40:53] repented and then after they repented
[1:40:56] they fell in each other's arms and they
[1:40:58] went back to the first works or how it
[1:41:01] was before they had allowed Pride to get
[1:41:04] into their
[1:41:07] marriage amen think back when you fell
[1:41:11] in love with God I want to make it real
[1:41:14] personal this morning A lot of times we
[1:41:17] use these words and it's okay because
[1:41:20] there's
[1:41:21] it's true but it sometimes it
[1:41:24] takes a a part that we need back into it
[1:41:27] go deeper than I was just predestinated
[1:41:30] that is true I'm not I believe in
[1:41:33] predestination go deeper than I was
[1:41:35] raised in a home that believed God sent
[1:41:37] a prophet there's true to that but why
[1:41:42] because we know that was the
[1:41:44] beginning but do you remember the moment
[1:41:49] when you had all kind of things in your
[1:41:50] life life and your eyes was open to the
[1:41:53] fact that I'm a
[1:41:56] sinner I'm a
[1:41:58] drunk I like
[1:42:00] drugs I'm not honest in my
[1:42:04] marriage I'm looking my
[1:42:07] phone think back to that realization
[1:42:11] that God Drew you to
[1:42:16] him and when you begin to remember that
[1:42:21] when you're
[1:42:22] cold and you pray to God to take me back
[1:42:26] to
[1:42:28] that to
[1:42:30] that God was rich in
[1:42:34] Mercy even you young people you say well
[1:42:36] I never got
[1:42:38] out but you still need to walk with the
[1:42:41] Lord you still need to be filled with
[1:42:43] his spirit because one of the worst
[1:42:46] things is a religious spirit and it can
[1:42:48] be so hard to detect cuz as someone that
[1:42:50] grew up in church grew up believing
[1:42:52] brother Bron was a prophet and all these
[1:42:54] things if we don't watch it we don't
[1:42:56] have that defining moment sometimes and
[1:42:59] because we didn't come from a bar and
[1:43:01] stumble in and then God miraculously
[1:43:03] took alcohol in our life if you don't
[1:43:06] watch it when you get older you begin to
[1:43:08] question it so you don't want any of
[1:43:10] that because Satan likes to work in
[1:43:12] those things if you can't say God you
[1:43:15] have done a work in my life because
[1:43:17] something has been transformed into me
[1:43:21] you say well what does a religious
[1:43:22] spirit look like a religious spirit is
[1:43:24] always going to be usually be cloaked in
[1:43:26] what does other people
[1:43:28] think and you begin to live your life to
[1:43:31] make sure everyone else thinks you're a
[1:43:33] Christian we want to go deeper than that
[1:43:36] what does God think yeah what does God
[1:43:39] think this morning what does God think
[1:43:41] about when we look when we look on our
[1:43:43] phone at things
[1:43:44] right what does God think about whatever
[1:43:48] you plug it in and then then your life
[1:43:51] begins to become transformed because
[1:43:54] it's no longer about so and so's going
[1:43:55] to think bad about me this person or my
[1:43:58] parents if they find out they're going
[1:43:59] to kill me they
[1:44:01] might but get saved and you'll go to
[1:44:06] heaven but what does God think I don't
[1:44:09] care how young this morning start
[1:44:12] getting into that thought pattern what
[1:44:14] does God think about me this morning
[1:44:16] what does God think about when I'm on
[1:44:18] the playground saying those jokes or
[1:44:21] different things whatever it is what
[1:44:23] does God
[1:44:25] think and by doing that you take all
[1:44:29] those layers of
[1:44:31] religious spirit that can come upon
[1:44:34] us amen we all know as a preacher once
[1:44:37] told me we all know usually what to do
[1:44:41] the right thing to do it's just
[1:44:42] sometimes we fail to do the right thing
[1:44:46] so this morning as we prepare to close
[1:44:49] cry out like David
[1:44:51] like Jeremiah Samson brother Brandon
[1:44:54] renew my days as of
[1:44:57] old you know Christ and I getting ready
[1:44:59] to celebrate 24 years of marriage in a
[1:45:01] couple months in
[1:45:02] March we've been through ups and downs
[1:45:05] highs and lows goods and bads and but
[1:45:08] you
[1:45:09] know she's still the
[1:45:12] one and I I've realized after about 24
[1:45:15] years of
[1:45:17] marriage it gets even tougher because
[1:45:21] your patience with each other can come
[1:45:22] really quick or you become very
[1:45:25] impatient because you know what each
[1:45:26] other's going to say and all that and
[1:45:29] sometimes what you need is a
[1:45:31] reset you get through the mundane of
[1:45:33] life you're especially in our season
[1:45:35] where you're raising teenagers and
[1:45:36] different things you got a lot going on
[1:45:39] sometimes you just need to get away and
[1:45:44] reset and then you realize how much you
[1:45:48] mean to each
[1:45:49] other but just the mundane of life you
[1:45:52] can start taking each other for
[1:45:54] granted and you just need to get away
[1:45:56] for maybe a day or two or go out to eat
[1:45:58] Christ I like to go walking or just walk
[1:46:00] for an hour or two and just reset and
[1:46:03] then it comes back to why you married
[1:46:07] him or her and this morning if you've
[1:46:10] grown cold on God as we
[1:46:13] close think
[1:46:15] back think back to those
[1:46:19] times where you just loved serving God
[1:46:23] where he was your all in all when you
[1:46:26] had a decision you prayed about
[1:46:28] it and you really took in consideration
[1:46:30] or you had a question you might would
[1:46:33] ask the pastor or see what maybe brother
[1:46:36] Brenham said or read what the Bible said
[1:46:38] about it and and it this book was so
[1:46:41] precious to you you wouldn't put
[1:46:43] anything on top of it because it just
[1:46:45] meant something to
[1:46:47] you if you're cold this morning think
[1:46:51] back and then pray
[1:46:53] God reew my days as of old let's
[1:46:59] stand let's just
[1:47:01] pray dearly father we just thank you for
[1:47:04] this wonderful time
[1:47:06] together Lord we all go through cold
[1:47:08] spells in our life and seasons and
[1:47:12] sometimes Lord we just wonder how we're
[1:47:15] even going to get up or we just don't
[1:47:17] feel like it and we become overcritical
[1:47:20] and we become like well nothing good
[1:47:24] happens this is a terrible world and we
[1:47:27] know all that the Bible told us it was
[1:47:29] going to be like that in the end
[1:47:31] time but Lord our hope is in
[1:47:35] you you put us here for a
[1:47:38] reason so Lord help us change our
[1:47:41] thoughts in

[1:52:14] church that isn't suffering isn't of God
