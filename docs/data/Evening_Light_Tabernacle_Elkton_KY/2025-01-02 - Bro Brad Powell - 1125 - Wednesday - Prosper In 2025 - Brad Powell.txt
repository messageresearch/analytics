amen good to be in the house of the Lord what a place to start the new year this is exactly where we need to be so good to be here and and uh thankful that uh we're able to to help as our pastor needed and he have a little rest and relaxation and get away for a few days and and just enjoy himself and his wife and so just uh continue to pray for them that they just have the most wonderful time that they could possibly have and just just a wonderful time for them so we're uh definitely thankful to be here tonight we want to look uh if you want to get in your Bibles we'll get right into it because I don't want to keep you long tonight I know you're you're tired and it's been a busy week and busy last two or three weeks I guess you might say so how many's feeling a little little tired well I appreciate your honesty if you sleep I'll just holler how's that so turn in your Bibles we'll turn just just to one scripture but I'm going to read you a little thought real quick we're going to turn into John chapter 10 is where we'll read from tonight but just getting into the word here and in and into the message I want to read you this I want to speak tonight on Prosperity Prosperity that's a good thought on the first day of the year Prosperity now listen to what the prophet says he says now I'm sure that people doesn't come and stand up and jam in into the churches just to be seen he said you come because you love him he said and I am trusting that God will send you away tonight not empty he never sends anyone empty who comes to him and he will send you away with a full Heart Of Joy lightf footed and going down the street rejoicing and praising God As you move along he said now that can be done listen now that can be done if we take our right attitude towards him if we come to see him if we come and love him and we come to worship him then God is obligated to give us them things which we desire he didn't say the things that he desires or the things that your neighbor would like or the things your wife wants wants praise the Lord but he said the things that we desire you desire if you come with the right attitude if you come with with love and you come to worship him and you come to see him he's obligated to give the things which you desire he says and he will withhold no let's do zero no good thing from them that walk upright before him just remember that his promise if ye abide in me and my words abide in you and you ask what you will and it shall be given unto you what a promise unfailing promise so look if we stick with God if we stick with worship if we stick with love if we stick with giving of him all that we have we can stand on an an an unfailing promise that he's obligated to meet your not only your need but your every desire brother and sisters that's the infall infallibility of the word of God that's why the word of God is the truth that's why the word we can stand on the truth of the word of God you know there's a difference between true and truth I learned this week I can say a true statement it's 23 degrees outside that's a true statement but that doesn't make it truth because tomorrow it might be 46 degrees but this doesn't waver this doesn't change this is the truth and it's the in infallible word of God he said if the people can ever get in a place that their faith is centered listen to this if their faith is centered not upon present situations oh we've had some present situations how many's ever been discouraged how many's ever been depressed how many's ever been let down how many's ever have been disgusted with the way life is going and you say I don't know about this present situation if you can stay centered Faithfully centered not upon the present situations but what on but what upon what God has said about it and if you can remember that no matter what comes or goes or how impossible it may seem sometimes life looks impossible things look challenging and how will we ever get through it but if you can just remember that no matter what comes and goes and how impossible it is yet God's word will take its place every time so you're telling me if my faith is centered on healing and the word of God says that by his stripes I am healed and I stay Faithfully centered in that word God is obligated to the for the word of God to take his place and say that's my child and he's healed today you see he says in the face of every difficult nothing nothing can take its place it has preeminence because there is none other than God himself in the spoken word and it has to come to pass you can't stop it I can't stop it the pope can't stop it if God said it it's got to come to pass and what we have to get to a place as Believers that we believe those things that we believe in the word all my days he says I have tried solemnly to keep the people on the word of God I tried solemnly to keep the people on the word of God he says and that was his promise to me he told me he would bless me wherever I went he said it would prosper you mean is that simple you mean prosperity in 2025 is that simple that if we just keep God first and we keep on the word of God and we keep our eyes on the word of God that we're bound to be blessed we're bound to prosper we're bound to grow we're bound to have success we're bound to thrive come on church this is what he said this is what the word says I'm not making this up but somebody has to believe this but the word he says the work of the Lord should grow he said but that the word that I must be sure that the word was first in everything and he said I tried to keep humble I don't mean to keep you standing but stay with me I tried to keep he said I Tred to keep myself humble keep down to a place where I can keep myself yielded to him to hear his voice when he speaks and one thing sure I want to know him and the power of his resurrection you talk about a Prosperity message call me a Prosperity preacher because I'm telling you that everything in the word of God is here for us it's here to prosper the believer it's here to prosper God's children your health your wealth your finances your home your your your wife your husband your children your jobs well we better get to the word John chap 10 verse 10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I want to take a little lesson tonight and we'll just call it prosper in 2025 let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we come before you tonight with grateful hearts Lord just asking Lord that you would come down and speak to us and as we enter this church building that we we step into another year today and we've had the past behind us and I just heard somebody say that yesterday is is history tomorrow is a mystery but today's a gift and so Lord we just want to take the gift that You' given us and that's time tonight to come and and to dedicate before you to worship you in spirit and Truth to to to lift up our songs of Zion to you to hear from you Lord to read the word of God and to to dwell upon the goodness that you have for us Lord so we commit the next 30 40 hour whatever it takes us Lord however you lead to you father that you would speak to our hearts because we are needy people tonight we love you Lord in Jesus name amen you can have your seats so naturally when I think of the word or I say the word Prosper what's the first thing that pops into your mind thank you brother Tommy somebody was paying attention money we automatically we think Prosper we think of money we think of wealth we think of riches we think of success in our businesses and and and that is all Prosperity but I want you to notice that there is so much more to that word than just money and wealth and riches listen to what the word says the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy now to to what is he coming for what is this thief coming for when he comes he don't come and knock on the door and say hey I've got a package for you no he's a thief he's coming in in in hiding he's coming uh uh in seclusion of the night and he comes in and he looks at you and he says I'm going to take away all the things that God has given you so in 2025 it's the devil's goal it's his mission to take away your happiness it's his mission to take away your love love your joy now listen your commitment to the word he's here to take away to to steal and grab away your prayer life how powerless would you be without a prayer life so he looks and he says I'm going to take their prayer life I'm going to take their concern for others their empathy their compassion I'm going to take away all these things that God has given them I might just take his health I might take his desire to serve others I might take his commitment or her commitment to the local body to the church you say well how could he do that he puts a desire in your heart to stay home instead of be at church he's taking you away from your commitment to the local body the word says forsake not the assembling of yourselves as the day grows near and what gets me is these churches that are that think they don't have to go to church I heard stories this week that blew my mind I'm thinking why do these people think they don't need to go to church why do they think it's okay to stay home and not listen to the preaching of the word the moving of the Holy Spirit through man the way God intended it somebody help me preach I find it foolish so why is Satan so consumed on taking these things from you John why is he so consumed and taking your prayer life your concern for others what is it that makes him so have such a desire that he says I got to have what they got and take it so they don't have it I tell you what it is it's because he knows that if he can take these things from you you will no longer be able to serve others if he could take these things from you you will lose your power if he could take these things from you you will no longer to be able to live a Christian Life if he takes these things from you you will no longer be an example to those who need him do you see where this is going if he takes these from you it changes your whole makeup you can no longer have your life on the display for the world to see so by taking these things out of your life what is he doing he comes to steal to kill and destroy so when he takes these what is he what is he doing ultimately what he's doing is he's taking you a child of God who God looks down on and God depends upon and he's taking you out of position it says look at this child of God now we move him over here is somebody hearing me this is what his goal is in 2025 so if you can't be Jesus to the lost and Dying World let me ask you who will if if if you can't be the light in a Land of chaos and darkness who will do you see how important this is if he can take these things from you and now you're out of your position what did the prophet say if you can have your faith centered oh we you didn't forget that quote did you you didn't forget what we started with did you but if you could keep your faith centered but now Satan says oh I'll take this child of God and I put him over here now his world is out of control now his world we've just tipped him on his axis and the world that he once knew that he loved and was so comfortable in and the world of all the blessings and the world of of God moving on the scene and answering his prayers and worship and and feeling loved and joy now he's in despair woo I've stolen what God has given him and because I've stolen what God has given him I've now killed his influence I've killed his influence I've killed his influence to a world who is thirsty he's no no longer this man or woman this child son and daughter of God is no longer thirsty or no longer salty they're no longer a Savor to the world who is seeking let me tell you there are people who are seeking God today they're trying to find answers who will be Jesus today we have a responsibility as Christians in our lives in this hour the word tells us go the going throughout the world preaching the gospel you say well I Don't Preach you live don't you if you're living if you're a Believer you better be preaching every footstep you take every word you speak every song you sing better be preaching to somebody so you see if Satan if Satan could take away the Life of Christ in your heart today if he could come in and he could take away The Life of Christ in your heart and the Holy Ghost was robbed from your spirit brothers and sisters it would destroy you do you realize that do you realize the severity of this scripture this is his mission it started in the heavens and in the garden and here we see it today he comes to kill to steal kill and destroy because if you lose your influence you lose Lo your credibility you lose your joy in the Lord you lose your happiness do you see how it just keeps compounding it's like a Snowball Effect and you would lose your joy you lose your compassion you lose your patience and I promise you will lose your temper because when that little Dove flies away there's a nature change child of God nature change but aren't you thankful tonight that the word never leaves us hanging you know I I told Brother David he I heard him call for me man I was going through notes I was praying back there and I heard him call for me I was going through notes and I was praying I was highlighting and marking and saying God help us step on the step on the scene tonight God and brother Brad would come out I said buddy I'm sorry I left you hanging he said that's okay but let me tell you God don't leave us hanging the word of God never leaves us hanging the word of God never leaves us in despair there's never a time in the Bible that that that you you don't have to feel hopeless there is no reason to have despair the word leaves us not in desert places now you know you may have to walk through some valleys you may find yourself in a desert but you know when you walk through that Valley the good thing about it it takes two mountains to make a valley I'm going to get on top of one of them mountains I'm not staying in that Valley forever but I'm going to find myself in a higher Place why because there's something on the inside that says I'm a child of God and I can't live down here and dwell down here in the bottoms I Prosper on top of the mountain the word never gives up on us the word has power do you realize how powerful the word is just that the spoken word deaf ears are open blind eyes can see at the speak of the word dead people are Ro Rose back to life at the spoken word sickness has to flee do you realize that at the spoken word your kids have to come home can I get a witness don't tell me it don't work don't tell me it don't work because I've seen it with my own eyes kids young people so far out into into the world into drugs and alcohol and things that they that you think they would never get out of it because it had such a death grip on them and they come back say I can't do it anymore I can't do it anymore I can't live like this it's either I have to get live right or die but I can't do this anymore that's a god of prosperity in the word of God I promise you will prosper if you don't believe me stop listening to yourself I said stop listening to yourself and start talking to yourself you say What's the difference difference well when you listen to yourself you hear all the negativity when you listen to your to yourself you you begin to act you begin to listen to all your fears well I can't do this because or I I I doubt that this can happen I doubt that God can heal me I I I doubt that this can happen I I I have so much fear I don't believe some of you walked there before I've listened to myself way too many times and whenever I would listen to myself I found myself in the wowy Woos as brother juel would say poor pitiful me I can't make it I can't do it God said I can't do it God said my children can't make it God said my wife is this or that or the other you you've been there you've heard those voices stop listening to those and start talking to yourself because your mind brothers and sisters will come up with all kind kinds of excuses not to be who God positioned you to be well if I could just sing like sister so and so I'd be so full of joy I'd sing all the time no you wouldn't because you ain't singing now but the Bible says if you'll make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord you don't have to sing like a canary but it says Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord do you see how you listen to these excuses and and you allow Satan to rob you of worship come on Church well if I could just have a business like brother so and so does man he makes so much money and and look at him prospering if I could have a business like that people would see how God has blessed me I'd have so much money to give I could give to this cause and this this missionary and this person and to the needy no you wouldn't you say man you're hard and he looked up and saw the rich man casting their gifts into the treasury and he saw a certain poor Widow casting in thither two mites a fraction of a penny two mites come on Church a fraction of a penny and well you say well that's listen to what that was the truth I say unto you that this poor widow have cast in more than they are you don't have to be making $10 million a year to be given and blessing the way God wants you to be blessed come on somebody help me because the Bible says for those that had an abundance AB cast into the offering of God they gave an offering here God we're going to offer you a little bit of this oh but she of her penry hath cast in all the living that she had do you see do you see how the importance is on Prosperity well just don't go down those roads don't go down those roads because you're listening to things that's not true you're listening to things that's not true what you're doing when you go down those roads you're taking the word of God and you're twisting the word of God to make an excuse and a way out of why that you're not doing what God ordained you to do yeah you're twisting the word to say you know what I'm not going to be quite obedient to God's word because I don't have what this brother has I'm not going to sing the way I should sing because I can't sing the way this sister sings I'm not going to get up and pray because I can't pray like a machine gun away this brother prays come on Church we're getting down where the rubber meets the road now let me tell you I didn't get this till this afternoon so somebody was praying oh if I could just preach like so and so man people would know how much I love God and how passionate I am about God if they could if I could just preach like brother Bor and like Brother Brad and like brother Ron and like Brother D and all if I could just do what they do man people would know who I am I don't want people to know me because I'm a preacher I want people to know me by the life I live by the way I walk the way I talk the way I meet them out in public you want people to Know You by the way you are the life you live the because Prosperity is the gospel living through us that's what Prosperity is still have doubts I told you the word never leaves us hanging I might Fail You Tommy might fail you even your pastor might fail you there's people that won't go to church because of of brother so and so here or so and so there or they this happened when I was you're making an excuse twisting I come listen to the word I come that they may have life I come that that they may have life what is that that means that Every Breath You Take and every move you make you are living in God you're living in Christ he came to give you that life but he didn't stop there I came that they may have it more abundantly you know I looked up that word because sometimes the simple words can be so complex but the word abundantly says in large quantities plentiful you mean I can have joy joy joy joy and I can have peace peace peace peace peace peace you mean I can have all these things unspeakable you mean I can have it in abundance praise the Lord I looked up I it struck me Abundant Life and I thought I've heard that before I've heard that somewhere where have I heard that before so I looked up Abundant Life now listen to this this is on the on the on the Google web whatever you call that thing Abundant Life is a term used to refer to a Christian teachings on fullness of life it's not an organized movement it's not a unique Doctrine but it's a name applied to the teachings and the expectations of this group and people who follow the teachings of the Bible you mean you mean mean it's that simple you mean I can overcome depression I can overcome anxiety I can overcome fear I can overcome hatred I can overcome envy and jealousy and strife you mean I can have an abundant life to where these things of God just flow and flow and flow like a well through me that is Abundant Life Abundant Life may include expectations of prosperity and health but also includes form of fullness of life when faced with adverse circumstances that sounds like a Believer to me that sounds like a Believer to me somebody who's been down somebody who knows what it means to not be on top of the mountain but then those adverse circumstances I'm going to live an abundant life because no matter what happens in 2025 whether it's Trump Camala Biden no matter who's in that office no matter matter what happen listen to this no matter what happens in this world no matter what famine hits this land I'm going to live an Abundant Life why is that because it was promised to me I don't depend on government I depend on the word of God it says I shall supply all of your needs whatever you need I will give whatever you desire you can have you mean no matter what happens my family's not going to starve nope nope they're not going to starve they're not even going to be hungry let me tell you my father owns a cattle on a thousand hills surely to goodness he can put a steak on my table Abundant Life Abundant Life comes from this verse 10 10 John 10:10 Abundant Life refers to a life that is abounding in fullness and is full of joy and strength of spirit and soul and body you mean Abundant Life means my spirit there's more for me that this happiness This Joy this excitement that I have up here preaching there's more of that well the prophet told me that if you have a desire for more of God in your life in your heart then there is more of God to be had for you that is an abundant that is [Applause] prospering abundant life teaches teachings that God is a good god who wants to bless people spiritually physically economically and it was championed by Oral Roberts in the United States after World War II that's where I heard it you ever heard of Oral Roberts yep Oral Roberts University he had he he he kind of coined this term Abundant Life that was the name of his of his ministry Abundant Life television Abundant Life Magazine Abundant Life prayer group Abundant Life building that was his brand why because he knew what God could do he had a healing campaign too he had a Ministry too and so he look and he coined this and he said this is an abundant life living the life of Christ so what is what is life I know this is Elementary what is life the Bible says that life is a gift from God that God is the author of life that God gives life that God determines the length of your life and it goes on to say that he can Restore Life to the dead let me ask you this what are you going to ask Lazareth on that day did you live a prosperous life you better believe it twice why because God was a God In Action God was a God in a move God was moving on the scene and said hey Lazareth come forth let me show you an abundant life there's more for you in this life the Bible says that in life is is a vital principle that causes things to move and grow and reproduce What did the word say to Adam and Eve What did the what did God say what did the word say to Adam and Eve be fruitful multiply replenish that's life that is life when you see those things growing around you the life is a period of time in the scriptures the spiritual life is a is a place that death there is no death to the believer that is a spiritual life that when we die we step from this Dimension into another dimension we never quit living you talk about prospering you talk about prospering that's life so the prosperity when we talk about Prosper Prosperity is the lifestyle of a Believer so if you live a life of prosperity you no doubt have been successful at something right when you look up the word Prosper the word Prosper means to become strong flourishing success or thriving so we know when we look at Prosperity people prosper in different ways we talked about money so financially people can prosper Prosper we got to have Financial stability you can prosper in your health you can prosper in relationships in your career in your personal growth in your community you can prosper in all these things so in 2025 you've got a big table spread before you so I ask you what are you going to prosper in because if you if you're looking at Financial it means you're going to have a significant income to meet the needs and financial goals that you have if you got health and prosperity and health you're going to maintain good physical and mental health if you're going to prosper in your relationships you're going to build good relationships and you're going to fulfill commitments you make to others if you got prosperity in your career you're going to give yourself to your personal life your professional life and career to see it grow but what more than any of these things do we need we need to prosper more in God so when I think about prosperity in 2025 we all want to do good we all want our homes go we all want money we we need those things right how many likes money how many of you is going to quit lying in 2025 let me ask you again how many of you like money sure God wants you to be blessed in those areas don't think he don't that's right let me ask you another question how many knows Abraham was rich nope you're wrong Abraham was very rich he said he was very rich in s cattle silver and gold so don't think that God don't care about your financial situation because he does but keep God first but what I want I want my life to prosper and the things of God I want my prayer life to prosper you see when I go and get down and I begin to pray before God I want to know that somebody's hearing me I don't want to go to pray to God and feel like I'm praying into a void but I want that relationship between me and God to begin to communicate and to begin to prosper to when I say my Lord I have a need I have a situation I have a desire and he say my son what is your desire this ain't no Genie in a Bottle now this is what we call a relationship this is what I want my prayer life to be a relationship I want to my My Worship to prosper in 2025 when I come to the house of God I I I've loved the services we've been having I love the energy I love the excitement I love the positivity of what's going on but if if there's more of a desire for more that means there's got to be more for us you say man the pastor about about jumped over the pull pit the other day yeah I was looking I said man please don't hurt yourself I love the energy but I want My Worship to be pleasing to God when I come to the house of God or in my living room or in in my bedroom and I'm worshiping to God I want him to know that this boy really loves me when I serve others I want it to prosper when I serve others you say what do you mean I mean if you're a Christian you're going to be serving others Christ came to what serve are you a Christian what does what does christians do they're kind of like Christ right come on brother Tommy it's our whole mission to serve what can I do for you you know I I this I this came as a real Revelation to me some time ago couple years back you know I have I have a good friend that that I don't see him as much as I used to we did Coach together he's a Baptist preacher and and when he would come and he would say hey Brad how can I serve you you don't serve me a't got to do nothing for me and I would hear him go into into into into places and he would ask people how how can I serve you today and then it finally dawned on me he's just trying to live the life of Christ what can I do for you how can I serve you Michael John what could I do to make your life better what could I do to make you successful what can I do to get you closer to God how can I serve you don't have to answer it right now when I'm a witness for God I want it to prosper when I'm a witness for God what good does it do me to tell somebody about God if I don't even believe that they're going to come when I witness and when I talk to people and when I live the life before people I want it to prosper to where they look and they say man I need to know I need to go to a place like he goes to I need to know what he's listening to I need to know what he's reading I need to know how is he living that life I want what he's got so in 2025 how do you want to prosper how many of you man would like to be a more prosperous husband you oh boy you better you better uh some of you there through a you kind of oh was he fixing you try to throw up your hand for ask the question how many of you ladies like to be a more prosperous wife hey you ain't got to be embarrassed about that that's the way God set it up in the Garden of Eden there was Adam and Eve and a deep sleep fell upon Adam and he was both male and female he created he them both male and female and he pulled out of his side out of the rib a helpmate so there's no embarrassment in wanting to be a better prosperous wife a more prosperous father yeah man I I feel like I do a lot for my kids but I so feel like I fall short so many times a more prosperous mother sister brother you see we got to prosper so let me ask you this time stand still let me ask you this tonight what are you afraid of why are you afraid to prosper or what scares you about prospering in 2025 because there is no reason to fear Prosperity if you're in the word you're going to prosper if you're in the word you're going to thrive if you're in the word you're going to get stronger if you're in the word you're going to flourish if you're in the word life is good because my Bible tells me he created on this day and it was good and he created on the second day and it was good and he created on the third day and it was good and he created on the fourth day and it was good and the fifth he was good and the sixth it was good but on the seventh he rested I can rest in the word knowing that God is good and prosperity is for us so sometimes we might just need a little push a little nudge a little motivation or maybe just a shove get out there turn to Deuteronomy real quick while you're turning to Deuteronomy 32 I'll share a little story with you so some of you know it some of you don't I got scolded for not letting everybody know so I started a little Consulting business and so I work with businessmen I work with companies and and corporations and and individuals and and and I go in and I talk to them about biblical Bible faith-based scripture teaching and and and teamwork and Leadership setting goals how to accomplish goals how to get rid of negativity how to build a positive environment in in the workplace and in the works space and so I started doing this and I got this these clients that I'm working for and and one of the questions one of the first things they always ask or or they always tell me as I fear I'm going to fail every seminar I've been to people you talk to what is your what's your number one fear I'm afraid we're going to fail but you see I got the word I've got the word and I begin to look at this I began to look at this situation when they when he when he told me that and I had to go speak the other night I was I was asked to go to their dinner and be a keynote speaker for their little Christmas event and so me and my wife was invited and we went and I thought I got to bring something biblical because that's my mission I got to bring something encouraging because that's my mission I got to bring something that'll help them because that's my mission I got to bring something that will that will lead them down the right path because that's my mission and so I thought well I'm going to I'm going to speak out of Deuteronomy 32 as an eagle stirreth their nest because they're afraid they're going to fail are you with me now let me tell you don't you take the word of God for granted don't you take the message of the hour for granted I said I want to tell you a story about the eagle I want to rehearse the story about the eagle to you and I said how many of you know the story nobody did you are you hearing me how many of you can recite the story of the eagle yeah why because you're centered in the word of God your life your business your home your career your family your children everything is centered around the word of God God and so I begin to tell him I said listen there's a story about an eagle and it tells it in Deuteronomy 32 and it begins to tell about it it says as the eagle stirreth up her nest it flutter over her young and spread her wings and taketh them and beareth them on her wings and I said let me tell you how this story goes I was glad they didn't know it I thought here I've got an opportunity and I said here this mama Eagle she goes out and she gathers the the thorns and the twigs and the branches and everything that and she makes her nest and she she begins to build her nest but then she begins to take the feathers off her belly the soft feathers and the rabbits fur and she lines The Nest expecting these young babies you know I love Eagles Tommy been teasing me sending me pictures of these two big eagles that's eating a carcass in this field I'm going to scotsville tomorrow and I tell them and and they're looking at me in amazement and awe and they're looking and I said but you know there comes a day even though that mama wants everybody to be comfortable I said yep that's the way it is in life that's the way it is in business we want Comfort we want to know that we're content we want to know that everything is good cozy and comfortable I said but there comes a day when that mama bird she gets in there and she begins to pluck out those feathers and she plucks out those those furs the rabbit's fur and I said you know what she's trying to do in order to get her babies to grow and realize who they are and what their potential is she has to make things uncomfortable if you're going to prosper in 2025 you might have to get a little uncomfortable and I told him I said listen and then she begins to look at him and those babies they like oh this is so terrible this hurts mama why do you do this and she begins to push them to the edge and they push to the edge to where they can't go no farther and they look into the chasm ah ah are you with me sometimes you have to have somebody to give you a little nudge sometimes you have to give have somebody to give you a little little push in life and so here these little Little Eagles are here and they're going down through here and they're trying to make a decision what are we going to do how can we have faith over this fear and Mama comes up and looks looks at them they look over and they're like I don't know and she oh can you imagine I I can just see them Wings just at getting it buddy can you imagine that feeling that heart racing and Pitter Patter Pitter Patter Pitter Patter we're going to die Picks Them Up on the wings of an eagle and it said they grab her by the pinions they grab down deep into her arms God is not going to lose you don't let the fear of failure keep you from jumping out of the nest it's time that you have to get to a place that you sore when you look at this in Deuteronomy 32 what it is it's a song that God gave to Moses and it's a song that God gave to Moses so that he could sing to the people and say don't forget how good God is God he he will keep you from falling he will keep you from disaster he will feed you when you're hungry he will give when you need just don't forsake Him just don't forsake Him you see we got an inheritance we've got an inherited right we've got an inheritance in our life that we've inherited Faith over fear we've inherited victory over defeat we have inherited love over hate health over sickness salvation over death these are things that you've inherited and go and God told Moses tell the children of Israel they are my people I'm here to tell you tonight you are God's people sometimes we just have to make a decision you know there's a difference between a decision and a choice have you ever thought about it there's a difference between a decision and a choice and when you make a decision you got your mind made up I'm de decided I'm going to do this I've decided that I'm going to take this road and that's the road I'm going to take and I've started out on this road and I'm determined but a choice is different a choice is different when you make a choice you're picking or choosing you're trying to make a a choice of what you're going to do many times we we do it out of convenience or we do it out of comfort oh I'm going to choose to go this way because it looks easier well you're not the ex you're not the only one lot did it too lot did it too and Abraham said lot which way do you want to go you decide look over there look at those pastures look at that grass man we we raise Cattle Man we talking about surviving and thriving woo things look good over there are you sure that's where you want to go I'm sure are you very sure that's where you want to go I'm going that way Uncle thank you buddy well uncle had a different Vision uncle said it don't matter how good it looks over there how bad it looks over here how poor it looks over here how desolate it is over here my god reigns I don't need that green grass to grow my cows I don't need water to give them something to drink because my God said he supplies all of my needs so we've inherited these things but keep the word first keep the word first because God is Mo and they was telling Moses here God was telling Moses remind the children of Israel how much I love them but tell them don't forget me because when they forget me hard times come when they forget me hard times come you know that's what happened with Israel I just heard this today a preacher was preaching on it he said you know what happened in Israel Israel was over there God give them the land God give them the land modern day Israel they were thriving they were they were producing they were produc they were doing good well then the neighbors saw how good they were doing they want to come in and take it over so they come in the Palestinians come in took it over why did they take it over because the people started turning from God so they come in and took it over in 1948 they become a sovereign Nation again because they were doing what God wanted them to do and God said I will bless those who bless and I will curse those who curse so as long as we stay with the word of God as long as we are thriving in the word of God we can't lose that's one of my new mots and brother berer quoted me I felt privileged as Believers we can't lose so brothers and sisters it's time to quit watering our weeds and planting our seeds now let me ask you has anybody ever went out into your your garden and say man I'm going to go ah here and plant me some weeds they look so good when they come up I'm going I'm going to go out there I'm going to plant me some weeds no you don't have to plant that junk it just comes up you can beat at it you can burn it you can poison it it's coming back but if you'll plant seeds if you'll plant seeds of fruitfulness and you take care of those roots you know it's it's it's not the plant that produces the fruit it's the roots that produce the fruit so as we as Christians as our Roots grow and Our Roots get deeper and stronger and our roots go down Into the Depths and suck the nutrients that God has for us as we dig into the soil as we dig into the word of God we have no choice but to start producing fruits big ripe Christians big happy faces big joyful churches big worshiping crowds are you with me we can prosper in 2025 because the word tells me through the messenger that he never sends anyone empty who comes to him you remember the quote we started with he will send you away full of Heart full of joy lightf footed I'm a little lightf footed tonight I feel a little lightf footed tonight and and I he says and you'll be going down the street rejoicing and praising God he said why he said if you've come with the right attitude towards him how many come tonight how many come to see him if you came to see a man you've left heartbroken if you came to see a girlfriend or a boyfriend you're going to leave heartbroken but but if you came to see him if you came to see him how many came to love him you came here because you love him and how many want to say God I want to worship you so you mean to tell me everybody in here man we we are an Unstoppable Invincible Army of God because the word tells us if we come to see him we love him we worship him then God is is obligated to give you what you have deserve of or desire of you love the Lord tonight let's stand to our feet if you abide in me and my words abide in you you ask what you will and it will be given unto you what a promise an unfailing promise of God let's just bow our heads if we could Heavenly Father we are so thankful tonight to be one of yours Lord to be reminded of who we are of the Privileges of the prosperity that lays in front of us in the year to come the world can cry the world can moan and groan and see disaster on every corner and they can talk about how bad the world is getting but to the believer it's just getting brighter and brighter there's a land beyond the river I don't have to hope in this world I don't have to to to to have a a desire for the things of this world but because I love you Lord I you'll Grant every desire I have need of and that desire is to be closer to you lord lord we just ask that you bless the congregation here bless the church our pastor and his wife Lord in 2025 may we see proof of Deliverance and and proof of forgiveness and and proof of of your satisfaction Lord Jesus that that you're pleased as us as Believers as we're trying to serve you with all of our hearts may we see healings in 2025 may we see salvation given in 2025 may we see our hearts burn for more of you in 2025 Lord we just want to tell you we love you we want to start this year off right right and we ask that you walk with us hand in

we got something to praise him for you know and I just I tell you and to see what God's done my grandson's not here tonight he went with out of town today and they didn't make it back but to see what God's done in his life and to see what he's doing in my son's life it makes me want to jump up on top of this pull pit tonight because I know that that God's in control and you say well look where they go yeah but look where God's brought them to and I told Mark the other night the other day I saw to him I said Mark I said the enem is going to fight you and he's going to remind you of everything you've done I said but when brother Thomas baptized you the other day I said Mark Wade died and I said when you come up you was a new creation in Jesus Christ and I said don't argue don't fuss just thank God for what he's done for you you and I believe that's what we got to do when Satan tells us we can't do it just tell him say I'm already a winner amen let's sing that song when I'm tossed on a live sea amen I think brother Carson has the words to that and I know I need them you probably don't but I do amen it says F sister Natalie I don't know if that means anything well when
