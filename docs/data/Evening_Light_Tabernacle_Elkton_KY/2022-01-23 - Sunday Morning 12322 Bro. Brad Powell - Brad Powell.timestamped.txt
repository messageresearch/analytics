[10:50] opportunity to be into your house and
[10:52] for your love and your grace that you

[10:56] world lord

[11:00] shortcomings many faults and failures
[11:02] but lord through the blood of jesus
[11:04] christ
[11:05] you accept us lord we thank you for that
[11:08] lord we just ask today as the word goes
[11:11] forth that you would reach down deep and
[11:13] search our hearts that you would pull
[11:15] out any impurities lord jesus anything
[11:17] that would hinder us from walking close
[11:19] to you and and being welcomed by your
[11:21] lord jesus we just ask that you would
[11:23] just pull it aside and and and
[11:26] annihilate it from our lives lord jesus
[11:28] we know that you're a you're a healer
[11:30] you're a savior
[11:32] you love us lord and you're a provider
[11:35] you do all these things for us lord and
[11:37] we decide so that you move today in a
[11:39] special way that you go up and down the
[11:41] aisles and the hearts
[11:43] just to draw us closer and we want to
[11:45] tell you we love you and appreciate you
[11:47] and as the word goes
[11:49] bring blessings upon the hearts of the
[11:51] believers
[11:52] jesus name we pray amen amen good to be
[11:55] in the house of the lord this morning
[11:57] amen we've got one that's glad to be
[11:59] here
[12:02] i want to speak this morning if i could
[12:04] if you're turning your bibles to the
[12:06] book of james
[12:07] chapter one
[12:09] little rita read a portion of service
[12:11] there how many is happy to be a
[12:12] christian this morning
[12:14] and man that's that's a little better
[12:16] uh so help us out this morning and we
[12:19] will try not to hold you long it's a
[12:21] little
[12:21] uh just to be honest with you a little
[12:23] evangelistic style message on my heart
[12:26] this morning so
[12:27] uh you say well you're gonna you're
[12:29] gonna be playing around in our living
[12:30] rooms well if a preacher don't play
[12:32] around in your living room you might not
[12:34] make it in his living room so
[12:36] just take it with a grain of salt and
[12:38] and take it as from the lord and trust
[12:41] me when when preachers preach to you
[12:42] they're preaching back to themselves uh
[12:45] multiple times so that's that's where it
[12:47] all starts so
[12:49] uh bear with us as we as we look at this
[12:52] thought
[12:53] james chapter one
[12:58] i think we're going to have a
[12:59] another little testimony after service
[13:01] uh did you mention that brother yeah so
[13:03] we're we like testimonies that means
[13:05] god's moving in people's lives that
[13:07] means god's doing something for the
[13:09] people and people are being motivated
[13:11] and moved by god so we we really like
[13:13] testimonies
[13:15] in the book of james chapter 1
[13:17] james a servant of god and of the lord
[13:21] jesus christ of the 12 tribes which are
[13:23] scattered abroad greedy
[13:25] my brethren counted all joy when you
[13:27] fall into diverse temptations
[13:30] knowing this that we that the trying of
[13:32] your faith worketh patience that's one
[13:35] we don't like to read right there the
[13:36] trying of your faith worketh patience
[13:39] but let patience have her perfect work
[13:41] that you may be perfect and entire
[13:44] wanting nothing
[13:45] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[13:48] god that giveth all men liberally and
[13:51] upbraideth not
[13:52] and it shall be given him
[13:54] but let him ask in faith nothing
[13:58] wavering no wavering nothing wavering
[14:01] for he that wavereth is like a wave of
[14:04] the sea driven with the wind and tossed
[14:08] for let not that man think that he shall
[14:10] receive anything of the lord
[14:13] and the last one where we get our
[14:15] thought a double-minded man is unstable
[14:18] in all his ways
[14:20] let's pray
[14:21] heavenly father we just want to tell you
[14:22] once again we love you we thank you for
[14:24] the word we thank you for what you've
[14:26] done in our lives lord and we just ask
[14:28] now as the words went forth we asked uh
[14:30] the reading of the words went forth we
[14:32] asked that's the preaching of the word
[14:33] goes forth that it will prick our hearts
[14:36] lord to be drawn closer to your father
[14:39] and realize our shortcomings and our
[14:41] faults and that way we can get rid of
[14:43] those things in our lives and just walk
[14:44] closer to you we give you honor praise
[14:46] and glory in jesus name amen you can
[14:48] have your seats
[14:51] so i want to speak to you for just a
[14:53] little while this morning and i've
[14:55] probably got a couple of hours worth of
[14:58] notes but i don't think we're going to
[14:59] get to them all and we'll just go as the
[15:01] lord leads but i want to speak this
[15:03] morning on a simple thought of stability
[15:06] stability
[15:07] because i'm afraid that many christians
[15:11] this day and time we have a problem with
[15:13] being stable we have a problem with
[15:15] being stable in our word and we have a
[15:17] problem with being stable in our walk we
[15:19] have a problem with being stable in our
[15:21] life
[15:22] and and when you look at that you see
[15:24] that it's hard in this day we live in to
[15:26] be stable because satan has so much
[15:28] pulling against you and you can look and
[15:31] you see christians believers around the
[15:33] world around the united states around
[15:35] the world and you can look and you can
[15:37] see sometimes the core of their
[15:38] foundations
[15:40] being shaken and they begin to waver
[15:42] upon their beliefs they begin to waver
[15:45] upon what they've what they've taught
[15:47] what they've been taught what they've
[15:48] been what they think and what they
[15:49] believe for years and years they begin
[15:52] to waver and we might even say to the
[15:54] point of backsliding upon what god's
[15:57] word and his commandments are
[16:00] so when we look at this
[16:01] as we get closer to the coming of the
[16:03] lord
[16:04] it should be an urgency amongst us
[16:07] an absolute urgency amongst us that
[16:09] something would firm up our beliefs
[16:12] but satan being the mastermind that he
[16:14] is he comes in here and he begins to
[16:16] manipulate and work into our minds and
[16:19] he works overtime on our mind and if
[16:21] we're not careful we find ourselves
[16:23] going in two different directions and we
[16:25] find ourselves fitting into this
[16:26] scripture that james is talking about
[16:28] about unstable minds
[16:32] what is stability
[16:34] the definition of stability
[16:36] [Music]
[16:39] that has
[16:41] the strength to stand or endure
[16:47] the ability to stand and endure with
[16:49] firmness it says it says the property of
[16:52] a body that causes it when it's
[16:53] disturbed from a condition of
[16:55] equilibrium
[16:56] or a steady motion to develop forces or
[16:59] moments and i like this that restore it
[17:02] to its original condition
[17:04] we need stability in our lives
[17:07] because when we get in a place and we
[17:08] find ourselves unbalanced and we find
[17:11] our equilibrium you know that's in it
[17:12] naturally speaking it's in your in your
[17:14] between your ears and when you can't
[17:16] walk and you're out of balance but this
[17:17] tells us that's being stable there's
[17:20] something that calls you back to an
[17:22] original position when you can
[17:23] straighten up and stand fast
[17:26] that's god almighty
[17:29] and i like uh you say how do we find the
[17:31] stability
[17:32] i like what the prophet says here
[17:35] he says that's the way god does he's
[17:37] speaking in the uh as an eagle stir with
[17:39] her nest he says the way god does he
[17:42] fans the feathers out of you
[17:46] he fans the feathers out of you and he's
[17:48] got two wings god has
[17:51] he says you know jehovah eagle that's
[17:53] the new testament and the old testament
[17:56] do you see a balance
[17:59] we have to have a balance he says the
[18:00] old testament and the new testament and
[18:03] he finds them before you and he says i
[18:05] am the god of moses
[18:07] i'm the god of abraham and on this side
[18:10] he says i'm the god that raised lazarus
[18:12] from the dead i am he that was dead and
[18:14] alive and alive forevermore
[18:16] and he's fanning these wings amongst his
[18:19] eagles and the prophet said the eagles
[18:21] lay back there and they say how great
[18:23] thou are how great thou art how great
[18:26] thou art the old testament line up with
[18:30] the new testament i love that when that
[18:31] when that was revealed to me years ago
[18:33] that the old testament as a foreshadow
[18:35] of the new testament
[18:37] what a revelation and i thought there we
[18:40] was in the garden of eden the very first
[18:42] fall and there was a sacrificial land
[18:44] that was killed and lambskins placed
[18:46] around them as a covering as restitution
[18:49] for what they've done
[18:50] symbolizing what happened on calvary
[18:53] that's to come
[18:55] that a lamb will be slain and lamb is
[18:57] what we need for the stability in our
[18:59] life to make us stand firm
[19:01] and steadfast
[19:06] you know sometimes you look at this old
[19:08] and new testament
[19:10] if you're not careful
[19:12] you can get yourself in a little bit of
[19:13] a
[19:14] a pickle
[19:16] we we
[19:18] had baseball practice of the day one of
[19:20] our ball players his daddy's a pastor
[19:22] and he knows the word and he was just
[19:23] kind of
[19:24] making a little comment we were asking
[19:26] how he was doing stuff he said well
[19:27] coach i tell you
[19:29] he said i try to match myself or or pick
[19:31] out somebody to live behind the bible
[19:33] and he said i've been looking at these
[19:34] old testament guys and he said as soon
[19:36] as i get to doing good with them they
[19:38] fall off the wagon
[19:41] they say look at moses he didn't even
[19:42] make it in the promised land he said he
[19:44] looked at david he was a murderer and an
[19:46] adulterer
[19:47] and he said you look at sampson and he
[19:49] he cut his hair divided i said you need
[19:52] to start reading some new testament
[19:54] you need to start balancing out your
[19:55] life get a little bit of work and we
[19:56] were making a little bit like that but
[19:58] it's the truth we have to have the word
[20:00] old and new law and grace
[20:04] without the law how do you live
[20:08] ruthless
[20:09] uncaring
[20:11] without the law your rebels your
[20:12] renegades
[20:15] but because of the law
[20:18] you can walk a line it tells you what
[20:21] you should and shouldn't do but because
[20:23] we have grace now on the side
[20:26] and if you make a mistake it says
[20:28] i'm looking through blood-stained eyes
[20:37] brothers and sisters we look at what
[20:38] james was saying it's easy in our minds
[20:41] it's easy in our minds to look at what
[20:43] james was saying and say that's not me
[20:48] it's quiet didn't it
[20:50] that's not me
[20:52] i'm not unstable
[20:53] that's not me he couldn't be talking
[20:55] about me because i've been in this
[20:56] christian walk for years and years
[21:00] that's not me
[21:04] but let me ask you this
[21:07] are we
[21:08] are you
[21:09] further down the road
[21:11] than you were 10 years ago in your
[21:13] christian walk
[21:16] are you slipped have you slipped further
[21:19] away
[21:20] from where you was 10 years ago
[21:24] today we're going to be honest with
[21:26] ourselves if we're going to get closer
[21:27] to god
[21:28] because that's how we get closer to god
[21:30] so are you participating in things that
[21:32] 10 years ago you never would have
[21:34] participated in
[21:36] what changed
[21:39] did did god's word change and say you
[21:41] know what i've reconsidered this i've
[21:43] reconsidered this here and you don't
[21:45] have to live by this anymore
[21:47] i don't think god's word changed no man
[21:50] i don't think god's word changed i don't
[21:52] think he wants us participating in
[21:54] things that we've allowed to come back
[21:55] into our house
[21:57] why is it as christians this morning
[22:00] double-minded it means having the uh
[22:03] opposing views at different times
[22:09] so we can apply this to many areas in
[22:11] our life
[22:13] yeah we can apply this to many areas
[22:15] like i said why was it wrong 10 years
[22:18] ago but today it's okay
[22:23] why is it okay for me and not okay for
[22:25] you
[22:26] oh that's pitchfork there
[22:32] you can't look at this message today
[22:33] with a pitchfork you better be looking
[22:35] at it through the mirror
[22:37] because this is what god has called us
[22:39] to do to a higher calling we have we
[22:41] can't be double-minded because that's
[22:43] the same as having a double heart and
[22:45] the scripture tells us we can't be that
[22:47] way we can't have a double heart
[22:50] double-mindedness to the christian is a
[22:52] sickness
[22:54] it's a spiritual sickness
[22:57] and there's not a medication there's not
[22:59] a procedure there's not a surgery
[23:01] there's not a doctor in this world
[23:03] outside of the great physician
[23:05] that you can go to and say heal me of
[23:07] the spiritual sickness
[23:11] heal me of this
[23:13] instability in my life that i'm
[23:15] experiencing my christian walk
[23:18] if you find the pill i want it
[23:22] i'll be the first to take it jab me
[23:23] right here
[23:25] it's not there
[23:26] but it's something that has to happen
[23:28] deep down inside of here it's outside of
[23:30] a medical procedure but it's something
[23:32] that happens in our heart and we have to
[23:34] recognize and address when god has dealt
[23:36] with us
[23:37] then we have to step up and take action
[23:38] into what god has done
[23:42] because if not
[23:44] you know what happens
[23:47] we find ourselves slipping
[23:50] and you slip some more
[23:52] and you slip more and more and more
[23:55] until one morning you'll wake up and
[23:57] you'll say how
[23:58] did i get in this backslidden condition
[24:02] how did i let myself get so far away
[24:04] from god
[24:06] how did i lose my fire for god how did i
[24:08] lose my zeal for god how did i lose the
[24:11] passion and the love that i have for the
[24:13] day he saved me where did he go why am i
[24:15] dabbling in the world
[24:20] and when you wake up on that day
[24:23] you're gonna have to start going back
[24:24] through your mind what happened
[24:26] what happened
[24:28] where did this happen at it's subtle
[24:30] that's the way satan works it's so
[24:32] so subtle he begins to slip in here just
[24:36] little by little by little
[24:39] and brothers and sisters don't be so
[24:40] naive
[24:42] to think that it can't be
[24:44] you maybe it is you this morning
[24:48] maybe you're sitting here and this
[24:49] message is already starting to prick
[24:50] your heart and say man he is really
[24:52] running down my avenue today
[24:57] double-mindedness
[24:59] is a disease
[25:02] and it comes with symptoms
[25:06] the symptoms of instability
[25:09] and james tells us it's like a wave of a
[25:12] sea driven with a twin tossed
[25:15] and tossed
[25:16] and tossed
[25:18] you see they had to go back to stories
[25:20] and things that they understood
[25:21] and he knew what it meant to be out on
[25:23] the sea and the wind be tossing and
[25:25] tossing
[25:26] instability when you don't have your
[25:29] feet under you
[25:30] have you ever been in a boat
[25:32] it's not a fun experience when the boat
[25:34] is going up and down up and down and you
[25:36] don't know there's no stability there
[25:39] i've told the story before when we were
[25:41] out in the uh gulf there 30 miles off
[25:44] the coast and the storm come up and most
[25:46] of you know me know the story
[25:48] but my legs i come home with my legs
[25:50] that my ankles were this big around
[25:53] i look like i was eight months pregnant
[25:57] my legs were so swollen because of the
[25:59] pounding that we took instability of
[26:01] that boat up and down up and down and
[26:03] that's what james is saying
[26:05] it's no fun when your life is being
[26:07] tossed
[26:12] double-minded
[26:14] symptom is inconsistent
[26:18] are you consistent in your christian
[26:19] walk this morning
[26:22] or do you act one way today in another
[26:23] way tomorrow
[26:25] you know one of the greatest compliments
[26:26] i
[26:28] think
[26:28] anybody could ever pay me
[26:30] and i don't i don't know that i've
[26:32] arrived there yet but this greatest
[26:33] compliment that anybody could ever pay
[26:35] me was
[26:36] anytime i see you you're the same day
[26:38] after day after day
[26:42] that is a compliment
[26:44] there's very few people that can that
[26:46] can be said about
[26:47] because we live in a world
[26:51] where satan is constantly pulling
[26:54] and our anger
[26:57] and things that are going wrong in your
[26:58] life
[27:00] but can you stand firm in it
[27:03] in your day-to-day living can you stand
[27:05] firm
[27:06] when your life is unstable and your
[27:08] mind's unsettled you lack conviction
[27:13] if you find yourself not focused on the
[27:15] word
[27:16] you're going to lose your convictions
[27:19] if you don't focus your time daily upon
[27:21] the lord and upon the word and reading
[27:23] of the word and studying the word you're
[27:24] going to find yourself losing
[27:25] convictions
[27:27] because that's your private time that's
[27:28] your time that you get to sit down and
[27:30] you get to get quiet with god i'm going
[27:31] to get into that more in a minute and
[27:32] you'll see how important it is
[27:36] we need our quiet time
[27:43] he talks about that being tossed at sea
[27:46] and how unpredictable and how unstable
[27:48] it is
[27:50] but you know what they do
[27:52] you know what they do this is nothing
[27:53] new they drop that anchor at the first
[27:56] sign of a wind at the first sign of
[27:58] anything beginning to get terminus out
[28:00] there they drop the anchor and let that
[28:02] anchor take a hold of that seed bed
[28:05] and that's anchor holding onto the
[28:07] seabed begins to stabilize that ship
[28:10] and it begins to hold it through the
[28:11] waves where it rides the waves out
[28:13] calmly
[28:14] and you don't beat yourself to death
[28:17] we need an anchor in our life and that
[28:19] anchor is jesus christ we need an anchor
[28:21] to take a hold of our life i heard a guy
[28:23] say on almost a
[28:26] song
[28:28] the other day he said
[28:30] god says i let you off the line
[28:33] when god sets that hook in your jaw he's
[28:36] not going to let you off the line he's
[28:38] not going to lose you he didn't bring
[28:39] you this far to let you fall
[28:41] he didn't bring you this far to lose you
[28:43] to satan he's not going to lose one
[28:46] single soul to the pits of hell
[28:49] you can bank on that
[28:54] i was thinking about airplanes
[28:57] you know airplanes have to have a
[28:59] balance
[29:01] if they're not balanced they don't fly
[29:03] real good
[29:04] if you put too much weight up in the
[29:06] front you may not see it on a 747 but go
[29:08] get you on a little cessna 150 or 172
[29:11] something like that and you let all the
[29:13] weight shift up to the nose of that
[29:14] plane you know what they say the plane's
[29:16] got
[29:17] attitude
[29:19] what's the attitude of the plane i'll
[29:21] tell you what the attitude of the plane
[29:22] is it's going down
[29:24] but if you'll balance out that weight
[29:26] into that plan it'll basically fly
[29:28] itself
[29:29] and that's what we have to do in life we
[29:31] have to be able to take and take the
[29:32] word of god and apply it to our life and
[29:34] balance us out
[29:37] sometimes people get so out of balance
[29:40] they get on the verge of fanatical on
[29:42] one way
[29:44] so far one way they can't see nothing
[29:47] but their way and only their way
[29:50] and everybody else is doomed to hell
[29:54] fanatical
[29:56] and then on the other side you've got
[29:58] the guy over here that says well we can
[29:59] do whatever we want
[30:02] and we don't have to have the word we
[30:03] don't have to have the message we don't
[30:05] have to have god it's because we've got
[30:06] god we've got grace
[30:09] fanatical but somewhere you have to find
[30:11] yourself in the middle of the road
[30:13] you have to be able to set your wings
[30:15] and fly
[30:18] i want to read to you some some little
[30:20] facts y'all know i read a lot
[30:23] but i want to read to you some little
[30:24] facts here
[30:26] this was a book i'm reading a little
[30:28] pamphlet little book it's god has a
[30:30] wonderful plan for your life
[30:33] and in this book this is talking about
[30:35] denominational world and and and so
[30:37] forth and it's talking about uh
[30:40] the mega churches that you see going on
[30:41] in the world now and the move of god and
[30:44] how and in a six year i think it's a six
[30:47] year span
[30:48] 45 million people professed to give
[30:50] their heart to the lord
[30:52] in these mega churches and churches and
[30:54] so forth
[30:55] but let me read to you what the survey
[30:58] the facts says and you said you're gonna
[30:59] think well this don't apply to us we're
[31:01] so far much farther down the road be
[31:03] careful
[31:05] be careful
[31:08] 45 percent who profess to be born again
[31:11] christians believe that gambling is
[31:13] morally acceptable
[31:17] 49 believe that living with someone of
[31:19] the opposite sex without being married
[31:20] is morally okay
[31:22] these are born these are these are
[31:24] professed christians
[31:28] 49 say they're comfortable with enjoying
[31:30] sexual thoughts and fantasies about
[31:32] someone uh one-third which is 30 33
[31:37] of those professed to be born again
[31:39] thought it was okay to kill a baby while
[31:41] it's still in the womb
[31:43] one in eight abortions
[31:46] is by a professed born-again christian
[31:50] you think woo
[31:53] how could that happen how could we how
[31:55] could the world get in such a place like
[31:57] that
[31:58] yeah listen 46 percent
[32:02] of born-again adults believe the
[32:04] existence of absolute moral truth
[32:06] but 54 so at least 54
[32:10] don't think that god has moral absolutes
[32:12] which explains why they live their lives
[32:14] as though there's no moral
[32:15] accountability at all
[32:18] you see what's happening here
[32:20] they begin to waver on what is morally
[32:22] acceptable
[32:23] they begin to wave around does god
[32:25] really have moral accountability and
[32:27] standards
[32:30] where are we at in the where are we at
[32:31] in the message as believers
[32:35] let's be careful
[32:37] we shouldn't be going back
[32:40] back god's calling us to come back to an
[32:43] original
[32:45] we're going back all right we're going
[32:46] back to the days of pentecost
[32:48] when that was that group in the upper
[32:50] room that's what god's looking for
[32:52] listen to what this guy this guy here he
[32:54] he's just he's just doing the survey
[32:56] this is his conclusion
[32:58] although most americans could consider
[33:00] themselves to be christian and say they
[33:02] know the content of the bible less than
[33:05] one out of
[33:07] ten americans demonstrate such knowledge
[33:10] through their actions with over 173
[33:13] million christians in the u.s there are
[33:15] 10 millions tens of millions who say
[33:18] they love god and yet they're
[33:20] locators adulterers child murderers
[33:23] and paul's wanting to tithe its titus
[33:26] seems to be true in the modern church
[33:28] when they profess to know god but in the
[33:30] works they deny him
[33:34] that's an amazing introduction in a book
[33:36] i hadn't got to chapter two yet but when
[33:39] i read that i thought man this guy
[33:40] because the the title of the chapter was
[33:42] phenomenal growth
[33:46] and the world is having phenomenal
[33:47] growth the church denominations are
[33:49] having phenomenal growth 45 million
[33:51] people professor christianity in a six
[33:54] year period that's a lot of people
[33:55] and it looks like phenomenal growth
[33:57] until you look at what they're growing
[34:02] a person with a double mind lives by
[34:04] double standards
[34:06] and we say that person is two-faced
[34:08] double tongue four tongue deceitful
[34:10] treacherous
[34:15] people who are double-minded or not
[34:17] sought out for service in any capacity
[34:21] because they're not faithful
[34:24] so these people proclaim christianity
[34:26] and claim to be professing this if god
[34:29] can't use them who is
[34:32] if god can't trust them because they're
[34:34] double-minded who's using them satan is
[34:37] satan's having his way with them i mean
[34:39] the bible says that confidence in an
[34:40] unfaithful man in a time of trouble is
[34:42] like a broken tooth or a foot out of
[34:44] joint
[34:44] have you ever broke a tooth oh
[34:48] that's not fun
[34:49] you ever turned an ankle
[34:51] that's not fun and that's what kind of a
[34:53] trust and ability you can put these
[34:54] people they're going to waver because
[34:56] they're double-minded
[34:58] double-mindedness was a problem the
[35:00] early christians and james had to
[35:02] address it
[35:03] and it implies when you look at what
[35:05] james is saying he says they have a
[35:07] half-hearted allegiance
[35:11] a half-hearted allegiance
[35:14] now we stand to the flag of the united
[35:17] states or whatever country you're from
[35:18] and you have an ant
[35:21] and in ours we say i pledge allegiance
[35:26] what are you saying when you say you
[35:28] pledge allegiance you say i'm going to
[35:29] be loyal
[35:31] i'm going to be fully committed
[35:33] to this i'm going to be subordinate to a
[35:35] superior
[35:38] so when we pledge our allegiance to god
[35:41] we're plagued in our life we're pledging
[35:43] everything that's within us so when you
[35:45] have a double minded and you have a
[35:46] half-hearted allegiance
[35:49] you're saying god i halfway
[35:51] love you
[35:53] god i halfway believe you god i halfway
[35:56] trust you god i halfway want to live for
[35:59] you
[36:09] jesus says no man can serve two masters
[36:14] these are these are familiar scriptures
[36:15] aren't they
[36:17] no man can serve two masters for either
[36:19] he will hate the one and love the other
[36:20] or else he will hold to one and despouse
[36:22] the other you cannot serve god and
[36:25] mammon
[36:28] you can't have it both ways
[36:31] and what is mammoth
[36:33] man if you look it up it's it's the word
[36:35] that was given to a an object of false
[36:38] worship and devotion
[36:41] monetary
[36:43] how many people
[36:45] how many people
[36:47] let money
[36:49] drive their walk with god
[36:54] they let the dollar drive their walk
[36:56] with god
[36:59] everything is about the dollar they pray
[37:01] for the dollar they pray for for
[37:03] business they pray for this and it's
[37:05] constantly business business drive drive
[37:07] dollar dollar
[37:10] they're putting them in the church
[37:12] where is it putting them with people
[37:14] where is it putting them witnessing
[37:16] where is it putting them doing these
[37:17] things are they still in love with god
[37:19] the way they were before the dollar
[37:24] are they still attending church the way
[37:25] they did before the dollar
[37:29] because you know the prophet said if you
[37:31] let the love of god in your heart
[37:33] you can finish it
[37:35] you know it you'll be in the church
[37:37] every time the doors are open
[37:41] there's times i don't want to come
[37:44] i'm going to i'll be honest with you i'm
[37:45] an honest preacher that's one thing i'll
[37:47] tell you but i'll tell you the way it is
[37:50] if if it's happening to me i'll share it
[37:52] with you because maybe you're going
[37:53] through the same thing there's times i
[37:54] just don't want to call i think
[37:56] oh how can i get out of it
[38:01] i think my big toe hurts
[38:05] i might need to prop that up tonight
[38:09] but that's not what god is looking for
[38:12] god you may have those thoughts but god
[38:14] is looking for the person that says i
[38:15] don't care if my knees are broke i'm
[38:17] going to try my best to be in the church
[38:19] house
[38:20] because that's where he works on us
[38:23] that's where he builds us that's where
[38:25] he molds us and makes us and we grow in
[38:27] christ it's right here in this church
[38:29] house
[38:31] we need preachers that are on fire
[38:33] for god and will tell us this kind of
[38:35] truth we need preachers who will stand
[38:37] for the old gospel religions who will
[38:39] preach the word of god and draw us close
[38:41] to him and get sin out of our lives
[38:45] sin should have
[38:46] no place in a christian's life you say
[38:48] well you're saying we're thought that'd
[38:49] be faultless no i'm saying you need to
[38:51] be forgiven you need to be the caliber
[38:53] you need to get to the bottom of that
[38:54] cross and let blood run down over you
[38:56] and you say god i'm sorry for what i've
[38:58] done help me to never do it again
[39:11] so double-mindedness
[39:15] we got to get away from that thought
[39:17] we got to get away to a thought of
[39:19] singleness of heart
[39:21] and a mind you know acts and ephesians
[39:24] colossians speaks about that we have to
[39:25] have a single mind or a heart that is in
[39:28] service for god a heart that will seek
[39:31] god and serve god with our whole heart
[39:33] and our whole being
[39:35] read through the psalms he'll see it
[39:36] over and over and over again talks about
[39:38] seeking the lord with all that's within
[39:40] you
[39:40] and the bible says to seek and serve god
[39:42] wholeheartedly love the lord thy god
[39:44] with all thy heart
[39:46] with all thy soul and with all thy might
[39:51] he didn't say a portion
[39:53] it didn't say i'm going to give this
[39:54] half to god in this half to satan
[39:57] one heart servant with all that's within
[40:00] it
[40:03] the double-minded person don't do that
[40:06] the double-minded person can't love god
[40:08] with all this within him
[40:10] but i want to be that person that says
[40:12] god everything i have is yours
[40:15] everything i live for
[40:17] is to live for you that's what i want to
[40:19] be and if you're not in that place
[40:21] here's how you get there
[40:25] james tells the christians who are
[40:26] double-minded
[40:28] purify
[40:29] your hearts
[40:31] you that are double-minded
[40:33] purify your hearts
[40:36] come to a place where you fall down
[40:38] before god
[40:39] and ask for the blood to cover you you
[40:41] know a lot of times and it's easy around
[40:43] message churches we leave god out of
[40:45] stuff we need jesus christ we leave
[40:47] calvary out of stuff
[40:49] and when we get away from our churches
[40:51] get away from jesus
[40:53] we're in trouble
[40:55] every preacher every sermon i personally
[40:58] feel like ought to preach the cross
[41:00] jesus christ bloodshed on calvary shall
[41:03] be preached every single service in the
[41:05] church house because that is what we're
[41:06] here for that's what saved us that's
[41:09] what doesn't place in a position we're
[41:11] in it's jesus
[41:13] it was his decision his choosing
[41:17] how do we do that how do we get how do
[41:19] we get good we get rid of the carnality
[41:21] in our lives
[41:23] we get rid of the carnality in our lives
[41:25] we get rid of the worldliness
[41:28] you say what is that we hear this but
[41:30] what is that
[41:32] carnality is your passions
[41:34] it's just things that you're sensual
[41:36] about it's your appetites it's the
[41:38] things that you think i got to have this
[41:39] it gives me pleasure and i'm not talking
[41:41] about spiritual pleasure that's
[41:43] carnality carnality is wanting things of
[41:45] the world
[41:48] we need spiritual minded people not
[41:51] temporal
[41:52] not temporal minded things
[41:54] you know every every bit of things we
[41:56] got right now you tell me one thing
[41:58] you're going to take with you
[41:59] [Music]
[42:00] yup tell me one thing
[42:04] i'll give you the farm if you tell me
[42:06] one thing you're gonna take with you
[42:06] outside of your soul
[42:10] yeah
[42:12] but it's only when christians seek and
[42:14] serve god in a singleness of mind and
[42:17] with all their hearts and seeking and
[42:18] serving in sincerity
[42:20] is when we get closer to god and i have
[42:22] to venture out and say anything outside
[42:24] of that you're lukewarm
[42:28] yeah let me say that again maybe i'll
[42:31] get some help anything outside that
[42:32] you're lukewarm
[42:35] thank you
[42:37] prophet says this listen to this this
[42:40] he says when i first came to you amongst
[42:42] your groups 10 years ago
[42:46] notice the time 10 years ago it looked
[42:48] like a church
[42:51] in 10 years time
[42:55] you know 10 years is a flash
[42:58] [Music]
[43:02] happy birthday brother baller
[43:04] we were just talking in the study it was
[43:06] his birthday yesterday so everybody make
[43:07] sure to tell him happy birthday
[43:09] but we were talking about in a flash
[43:12] he said 50 to 60 went by
[43:15] in a flash
[43:17] he said i know 60 to 70 is going to go
[43:19] by even faster
[43:21] so the prophet says in 10 years time it
[43:23] looked like a church but today it looks
[43:25] like the world
[43:29] he said because something happened
[43:31] somewhere you got to wearing better
[43:32] clothes now he wouldn't talk about
[43:34] upping your dress code
[43:36] he's talking about upping your style
[43:39] you got to wearing better clothes you
[43:41] got to make a little more money
[43:44] and it made a sap out of you
[43:48] in 10 years time he said now that's the
[43:50] truth he said you're trying to act like
[43:52] the rest of the world because he says
[43:55] today is a compromising time
[44:00] you paint your steps red and watch what
[44:02] the neighbor paints their steps
[44:06] you've heard this story but how much
[44:08] more true is it today in the day we live
[44:10] in
[44:11] everybody wants to one-up somebody
[44:19] you wear a little round church with a
[44:20] feather he says and all the women wear a
[44:22] little round hat with feather
[44:25] they're trying to look like each other
[44:27] somebody they all want to look like each
[44:29] other he said it's matching time you
[44:31] know he said it's matching time he said
[44:34] that must have went went home he said
[44:36] because it's true and i'm going to tell
[44:37] you my brother i don't care whether my
[44:39] shoes match my trousers or my trousers
[44:41] match my coat i want my experience to
[44:44] match god's bible
[44:47] that's matching time
[44:49] i sent something on the on the internet
[44:51] the other day and it was morgan
[44:52] freeman's quote
[44:55] probably knowing if you've watched any
[44:56] movies at all
[44:57] but he said you know he said it don't
[44:59] matter he's talking he's a realist in
[45:01] his mind he really thinks like a realist
[45:03] he's you know it don't matter if you
[45:05] don't wear name brand clothes
[45:07] because you got to put your children
[45:09] through school
[45:12] and i thought whoa that's that's a big
[45:14] statement come from somebody who's got
[45:15] more money he could burn a wet mule with
[45:20] a millionaire he says it don't matter if
[45:22] you wear name brand clothes
[45:24] but church some reason we think got to
[45:26] keep going one up and one up and one up
[45:28] but brother branham says what we need
[45:30] today is a matching time with paul's
[45:32] faith
[45:34] we don't need to match each other we're
[45:36] all different we all have different jobs
[45:38] different different abilities different
[45:40] gifts we don't need to match each other
[45:42] we need to match what god done we need
[45:44] to match what paul's word says and find
[45:47] ourselves matching there he said if
[45:48] you're a saint act like a saint
[45:51] if you're a saint walk like a saint if
[45:53] you're a saint dressed like a saint talk
[45:55] like a saint pray like a saint believe
[45:57] like a saint shout like a saint
[45:59] live like a saint die like a saint and
[46:02] go to heaven like a
[46:05] amen
[46:09] but it's separating time
[46:12] he says there's no more time for this
[46:13] lukewarm
[46:15] halfway
[46:16] christian
[46:17] and that's that lady i'll see a church a
[46:19] spirit that come in and it makes god so
[46:21] sick at his stomach
[46:24] i don't want to be that person that
[46:26] makes god sick at his stomach
[46:28] i i've done it out of curiosity one time
[46:31] i can drink cold water and i can drink
[46:34] hot water
[46:36] but you give me that warm water
[46:38] oh boy it makes
[46:40] me just oh right here thinking about it
[46:43] there's something about that luke
[46:45] warmness
[46:46] that you just can't stomach it and so
[46:48] god you can be on fire for god or you
[46:50] may be in the gutter for god
[46:53] and he'll he can deal with you but when
[46:55] you come to him and you act like you're
[46:56] somebody that you're not
[46:58] and you've got this double mind going
[47:00] that i'm living here one day and here
[47:02] one day and people think i'm this but
[47:03] i'm really this
[47:05] you're really upset in his stomach
[47:08] you're really upset in his stomach and
[47:10] he's coming to a place that he's just
[47:11] about to respew
[47:13] because laodicea it's just enough
[47:15] religion he says to make you sick
[47:20] and he said the problem is we're still
[47:22] longing for things of the world and say
[47:25] i better not do that
[47:27] so he didn't say they did it
[47:30] he didn't say they was doing the things
[47:32] of the world
[47:33] he said they were longing for things of
[47:35] the world
[47:36] he said they were longing to say ah
[47:38] better not do that they're questioning
[47:40] in their own lives but
[47:42] you see well you see how tender this is
[47:44] you see how how easy we have to walk
[47:46] around this because if we're not careful
[47:48] in our minds what's going on
[47:52] come on
[47:56] things of the world go on up here
[47:57] because this is a battleground
[48:00] and things of the world is going on up
[48:02] here but you got to get to a place that
[48:04] you don't even question it you say
[48:05] that's not me
[48:06] because i'm a saint i'm one of god's
[48:08] children i'm going to do the things of
[48:09] god i don't do that kind of stuff
[48:15] he says it
[48:17] you don't see people singing them
[48:18] old-fashioned songs the way they used to
[48:20] sing
[48:21] you don't see their faces light up
[48:23] anymore and sing and clap and raise
[48:24] their hands and praise god and pray all
[48:26] night and lay out in the cornfield and
[48:29] things
[48:32] wow you can't even sit in church 30
[48:34] minutes without grumbling and gross
[48:37] don't raise your hand how many looked at
[48:38] you watch just kidding
[48:43] he says you can't stay in church 30
[48:45] minutes without grumbling and growling
[48:48] it's the truth because we're living on
[48:50] the borderline lukewarm layout to see it
[48:52] and shame on you
[48:58] you say why does it matter so much
[49:01] because we are god's mouthpiece
[49:04] you say well i'm not a preacher i didn't
[49:06] say you was i said you was god's
[49:07] mouthpiece
[49:09] when trials come your way
[49:12] when struggle hits your life
[49:14] when cancer hits your family when
[49:16] financial troubles take you down
[49:20] people look to see how you react
[49:26] they want to know how does that guy at
[49:28] evening light tabernacle
[49:30] how does he handle those situations
[49:34] he talks a big game
[49:37] but does he walk a big game can he play
[49:39] a big game
[49:43] hmm
[49:45] people look at you and they say okay
[49:46] here we go he's either fixing to have to
[49:48] put up or shut up
[49:51] yep
[49:52] that's the way they look at you
[49:54] well they want to see what you're doing
[49:56] so that's why it's so important that the
[49:57] world when things come our way they see
[49:59] jesus
[50:01] they see that you turn to god that you
[50:03] don't turn to alcohol
[50:06] you don't turn to to drugs you don't
[50:09] turn to pornography
[50:15] i didn't read everything that's in there
[50:16] because i skipped it but it just come to
[50:18] my mind i think i'm going to share it
[50:20] and this little booklet's talking about
[50:21] listen is this
[50:24] promise keepers they promised to be
[50:26] committed and practice spiritual moral
[50:28] ethical and sexual purity
[50:31] in this poll they took
[50:32] 53 percent of those men visited porn
[50:35] sites every week
[50:37] and you're going to tell me i think real
[50:39] why do people want to dance and tiptoe
[50:41] around that
[50:42] a lot of people want to tiptoe around
[50:43] let me tell you pornography will ruin
[50:45] your life
[50:47] it'll ruin your marriages it'll ruin
[50:50] your children
[50:52] and it's not just man it's women too
[50:55] i've read the stories in the articles
[50:57] where women are so intrigued and so
[51:00] taken in by the spirit pornography that
[51:02] they're bound and they they they ruin
[51:05] their lives
[51:07] i read a story of a young teenage girl
[51:09] who started in pornography at 13 years
[51:12] old and she was addicted every single
[51:15] day to watching pornography till she was
[51:17] 20 years old
[51:21] she couldn't get married because she
[51:22] didn't feel worthy
[51:25] she felt trashy
[51:27] she lost her friends
[51:30] all in a hidden secret life
[51:34] and you say well we're in the message
[51:38] wake up
[51:40] wake up people
[51:43] it's one of the biggest things that the
[51:45] satan has used in this century
[51:48] is the cell and the prostitution of
[51:51] women and men on screens
[51:56] it's the truth
[51:59] you don't believe me
[52:01] you got tick-tock you got facebook you
[52:03] got those what kind of slides pop up out
[52:05] of the blue
[52:09] yeah
[52:10] you ain't done nothing wrong
[52:12] but just out of the blue here comes
[52:14] somebody half dressed
[52:18] yeah it goes back to what brother daniel
[52:20] was preaching we got to be careful with
[52:21] them phones
[52:23] we got to be careful with this
[52:25] technology because satan is the master
[52:27] of technology
[52:30] we use it as christians as believers
[52:32] it's a wonderful thing
[52:33] [Music]
[52:35] but let satan get ahold of it
[52:37] and you've got visions in your mind that
[52:39] you cannot get rid of
[52:43] i'll tell you from
[52:45] experience as a young man i've seen
[52:46] things i looked at things i shouldn't
[52:48] have looked at as a 16 17 year old i
[52:51] looked at those things
[52:53] you think those visions don't still pop
[52:55] up
[52:56] you think you still don't have to fight
[52:58] that you'll find it till the day you die
[53:00] and if you don't and you've done it
[53:01] you're telling a story
[53:05] you have to fight it
[53:06] and it's a scar
[53:08] and it's a battle that you carry in your
[53:10] life
[53:14] kind of got off there but somebody must
[53:16] have needed it
[53:17] if you're involved in it get away from
[53:19] it as fast as you can
[53:20] [Applause]
[53:25] but god in all times in all
[53:28] circumstances never gets unstable did
[53:31] you think about that
[53:33] in all times in all circumstances
[53:36] god never gets unstable
[53:42] you think about in the garden of
[53:43] gethsemane
[53:46] when he goes down there and he tells
[53:48] his disciples
[53:49] pray for one hour
[53:51] i need one hour power
[53:56] and he goes in and he begins to pour out
[53:58] his heart
[54:01] knowing what's fixing to happen
[54:03] and god is sitting there unwavering and
[54:06] standing upon the promises
[54:09] it's a promise he was gonna die
[54:11] yeah
[54:12] but he was also standing on that promise
[54:14] that if i die i'll save millions
[54:17] and he stood there stable and
[54:19] unstaggering and unwavering as he sat
[54:22] there and prayed in the garden of
[54:23] gethsemane
[54:26] and all he asked is for the others to
[54:27] give one hour
[54:30] what they give 15 minutes 10
[54:33] and they were out
[54:37] but not jesus
[54:41] so with jesus there's no reason
[54:44] there's no reason for you to be anxious
[54:47] about your future
[54:49] you say i've got all these instabilities
[54:51] in my life
[54:53] the country is going to the pots what
[54:55] are we going to do
[54:57] you know we preach this a lot because
[54:59] it's a real
[55:00] thing
[55:02] we really do have problems
[55:05] we really have problems when we haven't
[55:06] really had no natural outside of the
[55:09] tornado that come through here but that
[55:10] didn't affect what i'm about to say
[55:12] we have we have problems when you go to
[55:13] the grocery store and there's no meat on
[55:15] the shelves
[55:16] and there's no eggs on the shelf and
[55:18] there's no milk on the shelf
[55:21] we got problems when nothing spurred
[55:23] that
[55:25] have you been shopping lately
[55:27] it's tough
[55:29] we went to walmart and man walmart's
[55:31] supposed to have everything right
[55:34] we went in there and they didn't have a
[55:35] chicken wing
[55:39] i don't know if they had liver and
[55:40] gizzards
[55:43] people don't got desperate
[55:48] but with god
[55:49] with a stable god we don't have to worry
[55:51] about those things you don't have to
[55:52] worry about your kids you don't have to
[55:54] worry about your family you don't have
[55:55] to worry about struggling in your own
[55:57] personal relationships
[55:59] you don't have to worry about the
[56:01] balance in your bank account
[56:04] you know without worry it's a fun place
[56:06] to live
[56:09] and i try my hardest not to worry
[56:13] i mean i really try my hardest
[56:16] and my dad bless him he's probably
[56:18] watching
[56:20] and he says he he wonders what i'm
[56:21] what's going to come out of my mouth
[56:23] when i call his name
[56:27] but he's always conscious of everything
[56:32] because he's been through sometimes
[56:37] but we have to all get to a place to
[56:39] where worry
[56:42] i can't take thought of what tomorrow
[56:44] will bring
[56:45] i don't know what's going to happen
[56:46] tomorrow
[56:47] i may not make it through the night
[56:49] i may not make it one mile to the house
[56:51] i don't know so why do i worry about
[56:53] what's about to happen
[56:55] yeah we have to do our business we have
[56:57] to have concerns but i have to put my
[56:59] stability in what god said that he'll
[57:01] never leave me or forsake me he'll be
[57:03] with me even in me to the end of the
[57:04] world so what is there to worry about
[57:08] believers have no cause to worry so
[57:10] whatever it is in your life that you're
[57:12] worrying about and you're feeling
[57:13] unstable give it to god keep looking up
[57:16] to god look up to god and not to
[57:18] ourselves and there you'll find
[57:19] stability
[57:22] there's a song that says if you've got a
[57:24] problem it's too big to solve stop
[57:26] looking the man start looking to god
[57:29] because i know for certain there's not a
[57:31] thing i can do but there's not a
[57:33] mountain that my god can't move
[57:38] those are inspiring words i've not seen
[57:40] a mountain that god cannot move no i've
[57:43] not seen a problem he won't carry you
[57:44] through
[57:45] i just call on the master and watch what
[57:48] he'll do because i'm not seeing a
[57:49] mountain that my god can't move
[57:51] why worry
[57:54] why
[57:55] worry
[57:58] the bible says that
[58:00] i've set the lord before me always
[58:03] because he is at my right hand
[58:05] i shall not be
[58:07] shaken
[58:12] he didn't get that not walking with the
[58:13] lord
[58:14] notice what he said
[58:16] i said the lord always before me
[58:20] always before me
[58:21] god is first god's my priority
[58:25] you know i found out in life i'm pretty
[58:27] insignificant when it comes to myself
[58:30] because god's first
[58:32] then my family my wife my kids
[58:35] then if there's anything left for me
[58:37] there it is
[58:40] responsibilities
[58:45] but if you set god before you he's at
[58:47] your right
[58:48] hand and you will not be shaken
[58:50] therefore my beloved brethren listen to
[58:52] this be steadfast immovable always
[58:54] abounding in the work of the lord
[58:56] knowing that in the lord your labor is
[58:58] not in vain
[59:01] that's assurance
[59:02] that's assurance when you get up in the
[59:04] morning and you know that you're going
[59:05] to do something for god and you're
[59:06] sitting there and you feel like you're
[59:07] all alone but it says god your labor in
[59:10] him is not in vain that he's there with
[59:12] you
[59:16] jude says
[59:17] now to him who is able to keep you from
[59:19] stumbling and to present you blameless
[59:21] before the presence of his glory with
[59:23] great joy
[59:24] to the only god our savior through jesus
[59:26] christ our lord be glory majesty
[59:28] dominion and
[59:31] authority before all time and now and
[59:33] forever
[59:36] wow
[59:40] just a couple more and then we're going
[59:42] to quit
[59:44] i'm about halfway through
[59:48] prophet says if a man ever anchors his
[59:50] heart
[59:51] against the heart of calvary
[59:55] listen now
[59:56] you know i talked about going to the
[59:58] foot of foot of calvary
[1:00:00] right there grab a hook of that cross
[1:00:02] and don't you ever let go of it
[1:00:04] if you hear your heart right there at
[1:00:05] calvary all devils in hell will never
[1:00:09] ever
[1:00:10] shaking
[1:00:11] no more
[1:00:15] what an assurance we have
[1:00:17] at calvary
[1:00:19] i'm talking about a real born-again
[1:00:21] bloodshed tear shed experience where you
[1:00:24] know that you know you've come in
[1:00:25] contact with god
[1:00:27] not just a profession not one of the 45
[1:00:29] million that said i'm going to give my
[1:00:31] heart to god and i'm going to go sin i'm
[1:00:32] going to do whatever i want i'm never
[1:00:34] going to have a change i'm not talking
[1:00:35] about that i'm talking about a real
[1:00:37] born-again experience
[1:00:39] when god pricks your heart and you get
[1:00:42] closer to god
[1:00:49] don't be tossed about with every wind of
[1:00:50] doctrine
[1:00:52] believe god's word get stable get it he
[1:00:54] said how you do it brother branham here
[1:00:57] it is he said many remember in the old
[1:00:59] testament the outer courts of the fell
[1:01:03] you remember that the manna fell the
[1:01:04] children of israel were hungry they were
[1:01:05] on a wilderness journey they were hungry
[1:01:08] god feed us moses cried out and manna
[1:01:10] fell
[1:01:12] well they picked up that manna and they
[1:01:13] would nibble on that manner he said it
[1:01:15] was kind of like a little honeycomb
[1:01:17] and when he says that i picture the
[1:01:18] cereal honeycombs
[1:01:23] so here they are picking up honeycombs
[1:01:27] and they're eating them
[1:01:29] he said they're having a real experience
[1:01:31] they're eating these little honeycomb
[1:01:33] manna and they're eating them and
[1:01:34] they're eating them or eating them but
[1:01:35] he said you know what happens
[1:01:37] they find themselves hungry
[1:01:41] and the manna has perished
[1:01:44] in a 24-hour period all the manna has
[1:01:46] perished
[1:01:48] but he said he told moses
[1:01:50] you go and you take this little golden
[1:01:52] armor
[1:01:53] and you gather up that
[1:01:55] manner and put it in that armor
[1:01:58] a little chalice a little cup of some
[1:01:59] sort
[1:02:00] fill that up and when you get that full
[1:02:02] i want you to take it into the holies of
[1:02:04] holies
[1:02:06] and i want you to put it in the holies
[1:02:07] of holies and you said it right behind
[1:02:09] the ark of the covenant
[1:02:15] and it never
[1:02:16] did perish
[1:02:20] the whole time that armor of manna of a
[1:02:23] little honeycomb
[1:02:25] was sitting there ready to be eaten
[1:02:29] why is that because when you get
[1:02:31] yourself into a place with god in the
[1:02:33] inners of inners in the holies of holies
[1:02:36] there's no death that can come in the
[1:02:38] presence of god because only life is in
[1:02:41] front of god
[1:02:48] aaron
[1:02:49] the high priest listen to this he walked
[1:02:52] into the curtains he walked into the
[1:02:53] holies of holies and the curtains fell
[1:02:55] behind him
[1:03:00] he was surrounded all in a place all to
[1:03:03] himself
[1:03:04] and god alone
[1:03:07] and he was in a sacred place
[1:03:09] aaron was in a place that if anybody
[1:03:12] entered without the permission of god if
[1:03:14] you went in the high priest they drug
[1:03:15] you out by the heels of your feet
[1:03:19] but aaron found himself in there as the
[1:03:22] high priest and he goes in there and he
[1:03:23] gets with god and the prophet said
[1:03:25] that's where any man and woman that's
[1:03:28] been born again should find themselves
[1:03:31] we got to get ourselves into a place
[1:03:33] that we go into the holies of holies in
[1:03:35] the inner court and let the curtains
[1:03:36] come down around us and it doesn't
[1:03:38] matter what's going on around us it's
[1:03:40] you and god and you and god alone so
[1:03:43] that god can speak to our hearts
[1:03:49] consecrated
[1:03:53] we don't like to hear that
[1:03:54] because i'm going to tell you that takes
[1:03:56] time
[1:03:57] that takes commitment
[1:03:59] it takes dedication
[1:04:02] but if we could get ourselves in there
[1:04:05] and quit fashioning ourselves after the
[1:04:07] world he said
[1:04:08] because christianity is a sacrificed
[1:04:11] life
[1:04:13] and that sacrificed life is hidden
[1:04:15] through god
[1:04:16] through christ and sealed by the holy
[1:04:19] ghost
[1:04:20] that's what a christian life consists of
[1:04:23] listen now as i'm closing
[1:04:26] it's not how well you do this it's not
[1:04:27] well how you how well you sing it's not
[1:04:29] how well you preach all those things are
[1:04:32] good we like good singers we like good
[1:04:33] preachers he said but it isn't that at
[1:04:36] all it's hidden life
[1:04:39] consecrated
[1:04:41] to god it's a hidden life consecrated
[1:04:44] the veil the curtains dropped around you
[1:04:46] and you're dead in there you're buried
[1:04:48] and you're hidden god through christ
[1:04:50] sealed in there by the holy ghost
[1:04:52] brothers and sisters we all need that
[1:04:54] experience
[1:04:56] i don't mean just once
[1:04:59] i mean on a day-to-day basis we've got
[1:05:01] to find ourselves hidden away with god
[1:05:03] if not we lose our convictions
[1:05:06] i'm telling you it don't take but one
[1:05:08] day to get away from it and it's you
[1:05:10] start slipping
[1:05:12] because it's the age we live in you
[1:05:13] might have got by with it in the 40s and
[1:05:15] the 50s and 30s and the 20s
[1:05:18] living out on a farm somewhere
[1:05:21] but you know brother brown told the
[1:05:22] story about the old man that raised hogs
[1:05:25] and he said that old man come to him and
[1:05:27] he just kept talking about his hogs we
[1:05:29] raised hogs my granddaddy raised hogs my
[1:05:30] daddy raised hogs i raise hogs i'm
[1:05:33] teaching my kid how to raise hogs we pay
[1:05:34] the bills raising hogs and brother brown
[1:05:36] said did you ever think god set you here
[1:05:37] to do something besides raising hogs
[1:05:43] he said it don't matter if you're a
[1:05:44] factory worker
[1:05:46] it don't matter if you work in the log
[1:05:48] woods we do things around we don't
[1:05:49] matter if you farm it don't matter if
[1:05:50] you're a carpenter or if you work at a
[1:05:51] school it don't matter if you work in
[1:05:53] scrap metal it don't matter did you
[1:05:54] think god may have sent you here to do
[1:05:55] some more than that
[1:05:58] because i can guarantee you that's not
[1:06:00] god's number one objective to say i'm
[1:06:02] gonna make him the most successful
[1:06:04] registered nurse that i ever walked
[1:06:06] that's not what he said about me
[1:06:08] that may be my trade that may be what i
[1:06:10] learned to do that may be what puts a
[1:06:12] little food on the table but god didn't
[1:06:14] call me here to do just that
[1:06:17] god called each and every one of us here
[1:06:19] to be a witness to give a testimony to
[1:06:22] be something that he wants you to be to
[1:06:24] be a shining light in a sick and dying
[1:06:27] world that's what god wants he wants
[1:06:30] stable
[1:06:33] let's stand
[1:06:36] i'm just going to have to quit
[1:06:45] it's just by our heads
[1:06:47] musicians if you'd like to come
[1:06:53] spout our heads
[1:06:57] let's just take a moment to just get
[1:07:02] serious with god
[1:07:05] you know this kind of preaching
[1:07:06] sometimes steps on our toes and
[1:07:08] it pricks our hearts
[1:07:10] but if we're not challenged by the word
[1:07:12] of god and the life we're living
[1:07:14] we're not going to move any farther with
[1:07:16] god
[1:07:18] that's why there's a call that keeps
[1:07:20] calling come up higher come up higher
[1:07:22] come up higher
[1:07:24] we can't be
[1:07:25] satisfied
[1:07:28] with worldly things
[1:07:31] because if you're not careful that
[1:07:32] becomes your priority that becomes your
[1:07:35] first and foremost and all the things
[1:07:37] that god begins to be put on the side
[1:07:39] burner
[1:07:41] so we have to find ourselves in a place
[1:07:43] that no matter what happens no matter
[1:07:45] what we go through no matter what the
[1:07:47] temptations what the trials we find
[1:07:49] ourselves steadfast and strong and
[1:07:52] stable
[1:07:53] and stable in the word of god because
[1:07:55] that word never fails that word never
[1:07:58] wavers that word never will hinder but
[1:08:01] that word will make you stand fast and
[1:08:03] strong
[1:08:04] if anybody here this morning would like
[1:08:06] to just raise your hand to god and say
[1:08:07] god i need this morning to find myself
[1:08:10] more stable i need to find myself
[1:08:12] letting go of some of the things
[1:08:15] that's been pulling at me i find myself
[1:08:17] need to let go of some of the things
[1:08:19] that's been hindering my thoughts and my
[1:08:20] walk my family life my walk with my
[1:08:22] children my walk as a father my walk as
[1:08:25] a mother
[1:08:28] but first and foremost i need to get rid
[1:08:30] of those things that are hindering my
[1:08:31] walk with you god
[1:08:33] and i raise my hand god and i say pull
[1:08:36] the curtains down around me god
[1:08:38] pull those curtains down around me where
[1:08:40] i can find myself in the inner court and
[1:08:42] just come down and speak to me lord talk
[1:08:45] to me gently
[1:08:47] talk to me in such a way god that we
[1:08:49] commune lip to ear
[1:08:52] so that i could be what you would have
[1:08:54] me to be hands all over the building
[1:08:56] this morning
[1:08:57] there's a group of people here that
[1:08:59] wants to get closer to god there's a
[1:09:01] group of people here that's longing for
[1:09:03] a home
[1:09:06] a city whose maker and builder is god
[1:09:09] that's the way we get there
[1:09:12] it's a daily consecrated life
[1:09:15] with god
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:18] lord we just dedicate ourselves to you
[1:09:20] through the
[1:09:21] preaching of the words that went forth
[1:09:23] this morning
[1:09:24] may it just continue to burn and prick
[1:09:26] our hearts and burn in our hearts
[1:09:28] through the weak that if we find
[1:09:30] ourselves slipping then we just march
[1:09:32] right back in time march right back in
[1:09:34] order get ourselves back in line
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:38] not just on sunday morning
[1:09:40] not just on a wednesday evening service
[1:09:43] but on a daily consecrated
[1:09:46] living schedule of life
[1:09:48] living for you on a day to day basis
[1:09:50] lord
[1:09:52] lord we love you with all of our hearts
[1:09:54] this morning
[1:09:55] we wouldn't preach these kind of
[1:09:57] messages if we didn't love you lord
[1:09:59] because it's our desire to never fail
[1:10:02] you lord
[1:10:04] we fall short so many times lord
[1:10:08] lord
[1:10:10] in our faults and our failures
[1:10:12] we anchor to calvary
[1:10:16] because as long as you can see
[1:10:18] the blood-stained eyes
[1:10:20] that barrier that wraps around the world
[1:10:26] my life is as white as wool
[1:10:29] [Music]
[1:10:30] free from sin
[1:10:32] as though i've never done it
[1:10:34] and that's an assurance we have lord
[1:10:37] forgive us when we fail you lord draw as
[1:10:39] close we pray we love you with all of
[1:10:42] our hearts this morning lord in jesus
[1:10:43] name we pray amen
