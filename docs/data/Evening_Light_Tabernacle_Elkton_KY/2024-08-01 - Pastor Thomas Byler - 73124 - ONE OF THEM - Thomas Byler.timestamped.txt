[44:18] inspiration of God and the holy spirit
[44:20] amen it uh uh it it it is going to be
[44:22] there as long as there's a church that
[44:25] God is dwelling in amen that inspiration
[44:27] is uh to all generations amen and so if
[44:32] you will we'll turn to the Book of
[44:34] Matthew tonight to the Book of Matthew
[44:36] 26
[44:41] amen
[44:55] amen 26 in we'll begin with verse
[45:00] 69 Matthew
[45:02] 26 and
[45:08] 69 now Peter sat without in the
[45:12] palace and a damsel came unto him saying
[45:15] thou also was with Jesus of Galilee but
[45:19] he denied before them all saying I know
[45:21] not what thou
[45:24] sayest and when he was gone out of out
[45:27] into the porch another maid saw him and
[45:30] said unto him that were there this
[45:33] fellow also was with Jesus of
[45:36] Nazareth and again he denied with an
[45:38] oath I do not know the man and after a
[45:42] while came came unto him they that stood
[45:45] by and said to Peter surely thou also
[45:50] art one of
[45:52] them one of them for thy speech
[45:56] betrayeth the then began he to curse and
[45:58] to swear saying I know not the man and
[46:01] immediately the crew and Peter
[46:04] remembered the word of Jesus which said
[46:07] unto him before the Crow Thou shalt
[46:09] deny me Thrice and he went out and wept
[46:12] bitterly may God add His blessings to
[46:14] the reading of the words you can be
[46:15] seated this evening
[46:20] Amen in Romans 6 and I'll read Romans 6
[46:24] 1-5 also
[46:27] what shall we say then shall we continue
[46:29] in
[46:30] sin that Grace May abound God forbid how
[46:34] shall we that are dead to sin live any
[46:37] longer therein know ye not that so many
[46:40] of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ
[46:42] were baptized into his death therefore
[46:45] we are buried with him by baptism into
[46:47] death that like as Jesus a Christ was
[46:50] raised up from the dead by the glory of
[46:53] the father even so also we shall walk in
[46:55] newness of light
[46:57] life for if we have been planted
[46:59] together in the likeness of his death we
[47:01] shall also be in the likeness of his
[47:04] resurrection amen and I was going to
[47:06] hold off on this other scripture but I'm
[47:07] going to go ahead and read it 2 Timothy
[47:09] 2 and 11 it says it this well it says it
[47:12] this way 2 Timothy 2 and ver1 it is a
[47:15] faithful thing saying that if we be dead
[47:19] with him we shall also live with him
[47:22] amen if we suffer we shall also reign
[47:26] with him and if we deny him he will also
[47:29] deny us
[47:32] amen
[47:34] amen Peter here we find that he was in a
[47:38] very very hard place isin't that right
[47:43] because no doubt but what they were
[47:45] doing with Christ with Jesus their
[47:47] Master at the time wasn't a very
[47:49] pleasant thing isn't that right I mean
[47:51] they had taken him off and they was
[47:53] going to crucify him and bad things were
[47:55] going to happen to him and people Peter
[47:57] amen with just a uh you know he he was
[48:00] not converted yet and he did wasn't
[48:02] filled with the Holy Ghost is that right
[48:04] and he didn't have the courage and he uh
[48:07] uh it was he was told by even Jesus
[48:09] himself because Jesus knew what Peter
[48:11] would
[48:12] do is that right I told him n you know
[48:15] because he was very very exuberant is
[48:18] that right Peter was you know and so
[48:20] amen
[48:23] amen but anyway so
[48:28] very zealous for the Lord and when the
[48:31] Lord told him that he was going to be
[48:33] betrayed into the hands of sinful men
[48:35] and they're going to crucify him and all
[48:37] that you know and uh he said Lord don't
[48:40] know and that that never happen and when
[48:41] they came to get him ain't that right
[48:44] when they came to get Jesus well Jesus I
[48:46] don't know where Peter got the sword
[48:47] from but he grabbed the sword a't that
[48:49] right amen and so um he went went Troy's
[48:53] going to of course I don't think he was
[48:55] aiming for the year amen that's why I've
[48:58] nicknamed the Trump shooter
[49:00] Peter aimed for the head and only got
[49:03] the
[49:04] ear so but anyway so you know he was he
[49:08] was he was willing to kill somebody for
[49:11] his master and so forth he was very much
[49:13] that way and here he finds himself they
[49:15] had taken him anyway it didn't go the
[49:17] way that he planned and I think one
[49:19] place brother Bram talked about how that
[49:21] uh all of his followers you know and and
[49:25] they were in a absolute
[49:28] horrible place of depression and I don't
[49:31] know just how I'd have to go back and Pi
[49:33] pull it up where brother Brandon
[49:34] describes it but they had been
[49:36] completely disappointed because of how
[49:38] things had
[49:40] went I mean you talk about a church
[49:42] falling apart ain't that right I mean
[49:45] they just completely fell apart and
[49:47] everybody went their own way and went
[49:49] fishing and everything else and they had
[49:51] questions about wow I we thought that he
[49:53] was going to be the Messiah going to do
[49:54] all this and it wasn't the way they
[49:56] thought it was going to be amen and you
[50:00] know I think that's such an important
[50:02] lesson for all Christians and all
[50:05] religious people to understand that a
[50:07] lot of times God is going to do things
[50:10] the way that you don't think he's going
[50:11] to do it and if you aren't open to God's
[50:15] way amen and for changing your mind amen
[50:19] you're going to be actually found in a
[50:21] bad place of No Doubt persecuting or
[50:23] coming against God Amen so you have to
[50:26] keep a comma behind what you believe
[50:28] amen because God will do things and it
[50:30] didn't even brother Bram said you know
[50:32] it said but as soon as you think you got
[50:33] it figured out no there's one thing
[50:35] you're going to be
[50:37] wrong so we in the message even oh we
[50:40] got it all figured out you better just
[50:41] be careful you ain't I got it all
[50:43] figured out amen we're living by faith
[50:46] one day at a time isin't that right amen
[50:49] but Peter here and we look at that and I
[50:51] like that verse there because he said
[50:53] you're one of them
[50:56] so he was identified with a certain
[50:59] group and tonight we're going to focus
[51:02] on that talking about identity for a
[51:03] little bit because you know there's a
[51:05] lot of different groups of people a lot
[51:07] of different categories of people isn't
[51:10] that
[51:12] right amen we want to look at some of
[51:14] those categories for a little bit if we
[51:16] could amen we want to look at the 70
[51:18] amen that uh followed him for a while
[51:20] but then they didn't is that right and
[51:22] mean we want to look at just Judas even
[51:24] even Judas who was with him for a while
[51:26] then betray him so let me just start
[51:28] with reading a quote brother bam says
[51:29] many of them followed him because the
[51:32] first part of his ministry he went from
[51:34] church to church and though they gladly
[51:36] received him and they gave him a great
[51:38] hand oh Rabbi you're a great fellow
[51:40] isn't it about what we did in our
[51:43] generation as long as there was healing
[51:45] campaigns thousands upon thousands of
[51:47] people followed Ain that right my
[51:51] Arkansas and you Missouri all those
[51:53] places just so many people but when he
[51:56] begin to preach the
[51:58] seals talking about
[52:00] denominationalism is the mark of the
[52:02] beast he got really really really strong
[52:04] in the seals ain't that right says
[52:06] denominationalism is actually the mark
[52:08] of the beast because denominations don't
[52:11] go on with God they stop at a certain
[52:14] place and when you stop at a certain
[52:16] place amen you stop with God and you
[52:19] take the mark of unbelief and so after
[52:21] that we find after 63 that one place in
[52:24] Phoenix I believe it was brother B said
[52:26] you know he's been there for uh three
[52:28] years and hardly had any place no place
[52:31] open cuz they had put him out completely
[52:34] amen so we find that same thing even
[52:37] today you know because you know because
[52:39] and and this is one thing that brother I
[52:41] find here brother Brandon when he was
[52:43] speaking about this I'm going to speak
[52:44] to kids now teenagers could you identify
[52:48] yourself today is that right because we
[52:50] know as our teenagers grow up and amen
[52:52] they come to 18 20 years they have to
[52:55] they have to decide what they're going
[52:56] to
[52:57] be they have to find their identity so
[53:01] to speak cuz we certainly have an
[53:03] identity crisis today don't
[53:08] we and you and I we can smile because
[53:11] why because you don't have an identity
[53:13] crisis I don't have an identity crisis I
[53:17] am so thankful that I know who I
[53:20] am right I'm glad that I know who I
[53:24] follow because you're going to be
[53:25] somebody's fool so whose fool is he
[53:27] going to be you're either going to be
[53:30] God's fool or you going to be the
[53:31] devil's fool one or the other there's
[53:33] only two that you can be a fool for Paul
[53:36] said I'm a fool for Christ amen and so
[53:39] you have to decide you have to make that
[53:41] decision in your teenage
[53:44] years what are you going to
[53:48] be amen and it all depends on what God
[53:51] has placed down in your
[53:53] soul ain't that right
[53:57] oh my how many's glad that you go you
[54:00] don't have a problem with
[54:02] identification amen so I'm not notice
[54:05] here that's right so he says that's
[54:06] right as long as he was everything going
[54:08] good you know but one day he sat down
[54:10] with scriptural truth and then he
[54:13] identified himself not as only as a
[54:15] Healer but as a man sent from God with
[54:17] truth and life he identified himself oh
[54:20] that uh and that was against their
[54:22] tradition even to many that followed him
[54:25] the 70 turned and went
[54:28] away isin that right he says then
[54:32] brother ask says what would you have
[54:34] done think of it when a man that you've
[54:37] seen done mared the signs of the Messiah
[54:40] know that the Messiah was coming
[54:42] prophesy this was all going to happen
[54:44] even to John to Baptist in them and he'd
[54:46] expressed it thoroughly and you'd
[54:48] followed him and seen the Great Signs of
[54:50] the Messiah proving that none of the
[54:52] pastors could withstand the message at
[54:54] all and then all once he says he comes
[54:57] around and teaches something that's
[54:59] contrary to the uh that's exactly
[55:02] according to the word of God but
[55:03] contrary to the way that you've been
[55:06] taught then you hold to your tradition
[55:09] would you go with the 70 see the
[55:12] scriptures it's a clear-cut word but
[55:14] would you go with the 70 or can you see
[55:18] now your
[55:21] identification now we know that Jesus
[55:23] said that anybody that would deny me I
[55:25] will deny him now we know Peter denied
[55:27] him didn't he did him three times he
[55:30] denied him but how many how know no
[55:33] wonder Peter could be real happy because
[55:35] guess what it went now he went out he
[55:37] didn't want to but he just couldn't take
[55:39] he just couldn't uh confess him at the
[55:42] time it was too hard for him but he went
[55:45] out and wept bitterly there was
[55:47] repentance there God knew his heart
[55:49] isn't that
[55:50] right oh he knew he would do it but
[55:53] Peter oh you know we know that God Amen
[55:55] had him to be one of the main pillars of
[55:57] the church ain't that right praise the
[56:00] Lord
[56:02] so and and and of course we know after
[56:04] the day of Pentecost he wasn't so
[56:06] ashamed anymore he wasn't so afraid
[56:08] anymore it's kind of like a lot of
[56:10] people you know if you're not truly born
[56:12] again and and and and and and people ask
[56:15] you you know one of the first things
[56:18] people ask you if you talk god or
[56:20] scriptures what what church do you go
[56:24] to what church do you go to

[56:54] who you are that's right
[56:57] it absolutely you can't get away from it
[57:00] and you are in one of these categories

[1:04:47] following a false
[1:04:52] prophet woo Glory they called my master
[1:04:56] the chief of devils so if you get called
[1:04:59] one
[1:05:01] Rejoice the Bible says if they persecute
[1:05:04] you and if they despitefully use you
[1:05:06] rejoice that you're count it worthy to

[1:05:15] the back the world ain't going to do
[1:05:20] that they'll cast your name out as evil
[1:05:23] the Bible says

[1:05:30] hello but says if you can't say
[1:05:32] something good about somebody don't say
[1:05:33] nothing at all so when you find somebody
[1:05:36] cutting somebody else fell down and
[1:05:37] almost saying all kinds of ass thing
[1:05:39] that that remember where they're
[1:05:40] identifying themselves
[1:05:43] as amen because the Bible says as you
[1:05:46] have done one of these my little ones
[1:05:48] you've done it unto
[1:05:49] me how many believes
[1:05:52] that all right let me back up just a
[1:05:55] little bit
[1:05:56] we're going 150 M hour we're going to go
[1:05:58] down to about 30 all
[1:06:00] right we're going to slow this thing
[1:06:02] down and bring it back down to amen
[1:06:05] where we need to be with the help of the
[1:06:07] Lord in Matthew 13 I want to go look at
[1:06:11] a group in Matthew 13 a group of
[1:06:15] people
[1:06:16] amen got some good stuff right
[1:06:24] here Matthew 13 we'll begin with Verse
[1:06:29] 18 actually let's just uh go back to
[1:06:32] verse three and he spake many things
[1:06:34] unto them in Parable saying Behold a
[1:06:36] swer went forth to sew and when he sowed
[1:06:39] he SED a seeds fell some feed self by
[1:06:42] the wayside and the fowls that came and
[1:06:44] devoured them up some of them fell on
[1:06:46] Stony places where they had not much
[1:06:48] Earth and for with they sprung up
[1:06:50] because they had no depth of Earth and
[1:06:52] when the sun was come up they were
[1:06:54] scorched and because they had no root
[1:06:56] they withered away some fell among
[1:06:59] thorns and the Thorns sprang up and
[1:07:00] choked them but others fell into good
[1:07:02] ground and brought forth fruit some 100
[1:07:05] fold and some 60 amen remember they
[1:07:09] desired that he would explain this to
[1:07:11] them why do you speak to us in terrible
[1:07:13] Parables and so forth in verse 18 hear
[1:07:16] ye therefore the parable of the S when
[1:07:18] anyone heareth the word of the kingdom
[1:07:20] and understandeth it not then cometh the
[1:07:23] wicked one and catch away that which was
[1:07:24] sown in his heart heart and this is he
[1:07:26] which had received seed by the
[1:07:29] wayside they barely get out the doors
[1:07:32] before they forget what they
[1:07:34] heard hello I don't know about you don't
[1:07:37] you like uh who was
[1:07:40] it I think it was brother Jesse talking
[1:07:43] about brother brandham having gotten a
[1:07:44] revelation on how he lived on it for
[1:07:46] about a week ain't that right or lasted
[1:07:50] two weeks that man I just I just fed on
[1:07:52] that for a couple of weeks
[1:07:56] some people don't even feed on until
[1:07:57] they get home they don't forgot what was
[1:07:59] said I don't know about you but don't
[1:08:01] you like to hear something and me come
[1:08:02] down into your heart that you can feed
[1:08:04] on it for a while it lasts for a while
[1:08:07] that really means something to
[1:08:09] me don't let it just fall by the wayside
[1:08:12] don't be in a category of those Fall by
[1:08:15] the wayside or amen it's just taken
[1:08:20] away amen then of course he says next of
[1:08:24] all but not
[1:08:27] notice verse 20 but he that receiveth
[1:08:30] the seed into the Stony place is the
[1:08:32] same as he that Hearth the word and ano
[1:08:35] with joy receiveth it woo
[1:08:40] Glory kind of like the children of
[1:08:42] Israel when they amen was over across
[1:08:44] the Red Sea isn't that right they got
[1:08:46] over there and Miriam and all of them
[1:08:47] boy they
[1:08:49] rejoiced dancing and all all of these
[1:08:53] things oh they had Joy
[1:08:57] receive it yet hath not root in
[1:09:01] himself amen but doth for a while for
[1:09:06] when tribulation and persecution arises
[1:09:08] because of the word by and by He Is
[1:09:14] offended now the Bible says it is
[1:09:16] impossible but that offenses will come
[1:09:19] for a
[1:09:20] Christian that right but W by whom the
[1:09:24] offenses come the one that's causing the
[1:09:27] offenses woe to
[1:09:29] him but you are going to get offense
[1:09:33] offenses are going to come we even as
[1:09:35] good Christians sometimes offend each
[1:09:38] other is that
[1:09:41] right and if you ain't got
[1:09:44] root amen I call it the buy and buy
[1:09:49] group or the babby group
[1:09:55] huh there's a group that I call the
[1:09:57] bye-bye group they just don't last very
[1:10:06] long I don't care what you do you
[1:10:11] know all right bye-bye group just by and
[1:10:15] by they're
[1:10:17] offended off they go remember the
[1:10:20] illustration brother and I think is even
[1:10:22] the Bible talks about casting a net into
[1:10:24] the ocean catch all
[1:10:26] kinds amen Turtles and and lizards and
[1:10:29] fish and this that or the other and you
[1:10:31] know some of them come up there and sit
[1:10:33] down there and say that's right praise
[1:10:35] the Lord I thank God for p picking me up
[1:10:38] for for delivering me out of the ocean
[1:10:41] and that right oh they Rejoice for a
[1:10:42] while but then it don't go the way they
[1:10:45] think and wiggle their way back out into
[1:10:47] the
[1:10:48] ocean buying buyers end up going back
[1:10:51] where they were before they ever come
[1:10:57] amen I don't know about you but I don't
[1:10:59] want to be one of
[1:11:01] them no I don't want to be one of
[1:11:06] them no
[1:11:09] root but he that receiveth seed among
[1:11:11] the Thorns is also he that heareth the
[1:11:13] word and the uh and the cares of this
[1:11:15] world and the deceitfulness of riches
[1:11:18] choke the word and becometh
[1:11:20] unfruitful Lord I don't want to be one
[1:11:23] of them don't let my money don't let my
[1:11:26] Prosperity get the better of me don't
[1:11:30] let my good business or whatever it
[1:11:32] might be am me cause me not to be able
[1:11:34] to come to
[1:11:35] church not be able to worship the way
[1:11:38] that I ought
[1:11:39] to get away from God no don't let those
[1:11:42] things choke
[1:11:44] out oh my I was telling my wife and
[1:11:47] sitting on the front porch I says we're
[1:11:48] blessed people you know and this
[1:11:51] persecution that's coming upon the
[1:11:53] Christians and that's right by our own
[1:11:54] government and everything else that's
[1:11:56] coming I said you know man they used to
[1:11:57] live in caves and in dens of the Earth
[1:12:00] for a thousand years they gave their
[1:12:02] lives and had to dive a't that right we
[1:12:05] get that have it pretty good prosper and
[1:12:07] everything
[1:12:09] else hello we've got it nice in that
[1:12:15] manner amen so let's serve him with all
[1:12:18] we got let's not be in the lukewarm
[1:12:21] group how many believe there's a
[1:12:23] lukewarm group there's a Le out ofia
[1:12:25] Rich increased with goods and have need
[1:12:27] of nothing but
[1:12:31] spiritually they wretched miserable poor
[1:12:35] blind and
[1:12:36] naked and the worst part of it all is
[1:12:40] they don't know
[1:12:43] it isn't that something that's the
[1:12:46] craziest part is they're all of that and
[1:12:48] they don't even know
[1:12:50] it that's why when they come up there
[1:12:52] before the father they'll say look I
[1:12:54] spoke in tongues I I did this out the
[1:12:56] other yeah but I sent you El Elijah the
[1:12:59] prophet and you wouldn't even hear
[1:13:03] him I'm afraid for anybody that is
[1:13:07] ashamed of God's
[1:13:09] angel that was God's
[1:13:12] messenger the angel of the Lord was with
[1:13:14] him 247 watching out for him he'd never
[1:13:18] come to this platform in this pulpit and
[1:13:20] then God forsook him no he didn't come
[1:13:22] did you ever read a tape listen to a
[1:13:24] tape where he said says no he didn't
[1:13:26] come
[1:13:28] tonight I thought he was going to come
[1:13:30] but he didn't come never never will you

[1:13:34] that why cuz he always came God always
[1:13:39] came oh my now I'm here to tell you just
[1:13:42] because amen some people have their own
[1:13:45] ideas they lean to their own
[1:13:48] understanding they want it their own way
[1:13:52] I wish they'd be listening
[1:13:54] tonight it's going to be bad for you on
[1:13:56] the Judgment Day real bad when God took
[1:13:59] his own picture with him the pillar fire
[1:14:01] took his picture with him when he's
[1:14:03] being criticized and that that that that
[1:14:06] man was trying to put his finger up
[1:14:07] there and trying to get a picture and
[1:14:08] show Mr best I believe it was and me
[1:14:10] show that he's the big one and that's

[1:14:32] and cry amen for the Abominations that s
[1:14:35] said they put a mark in their head amen
[1:14:38] over there in Revelations 12 I believe
[1:14:40] it is say it says put a seal upon their
[1:14:42] forehead over in Revelations 22 he says
[1:14:45] then said they've got their they've got
[1:14:47] his name in their foreheads God help us

[1:14:59] everything to
[1:15:03] us he's everything he's everything to
[1:15:06] me and that name we don't go by anywhere
[1:15:09] identified with acts

[1:15:14] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:15:16] the remission of your sins and you shall

[1:15:26] here some will get mad at you they want
[1:15:28] Father Son and Holy Ghost they want to
[1:15:31] go back to
[1:15:31] titles
[1:15:34] hello like brother Braham says she said
[1:15:36] you know uh come to that uh I believe it

[1:16:32] to
[1:16:33] be I'm so
[1:16:36] thankful for this next
[1:16:42] verse but he that receiveth seed into
[1:16:46] the good ground is he that heareth the
[1:16:49] word and understandeth it which also
[1:16:52] bringeth forth fruit amen
[1:16:59] some and bring it forth some hundredfold
[1:17:02] some 60 and some
[1:17:07] 30 you don't want to be
[1:17:10] identified as a
[1:17:12] quitter identified as somebody that lets
[1:17:16] the cares of this world choke out the
[1:17:18] word in
[1:17:22] you amen
[1:17:28] and I thought as I was studying
[1:17:32] this why is it this
[1:17:34] way what is the
[1:17:37] problem the problem is not with the
[1:17:39] seed in each one of these it's never the
[1:17:42] seed's
[1:17:45] problem it's always the soil's
[1:17:52] problem the soil is not deep enough and
[1:17:54] anybody that brother Brad he does Plants
[1:17:56] anybody knows that you got to have so
[1:17:58] much soil for those roots to
[1:18:00] grow you've got to have depth of
[1:18:04] Earth amen hallelujah well brother about
[1:18:08] how can I know that I'm in this
[1:18:11] part well first of all you're going to
[1:18:15] bear
[1:18:18] fruit Jesus said by their fruits she
[1:18:21] shall know them by what people do you
[1:18:24] know them
[1:18:25] by what you do you can know
[1:18:29] yourself is that right we need to
[1:18:32] inspect
[1:18:37] ourself so much easier to see either
[1:18:40] everybody
[1:18:42] else
[1:18:44] amen but putting them glasses on
[1:18:49] backwards now that's the hard
[1:18:52] part amen me said me seeing out there
[1:18:55] turn that thing around and let me look
[1:18:57] at myself here is that
[1:19:00] right that's so hard it gets all
[1:19:03] blurry because for some reason everybody
[1:19:06] thinks that they're all
[1:19:07] Angels They're All
[1:19:10] Saints we in our own eyes we see
[1:19:13] ourselves too righteous
[1:19:16] sometimes and I'm here to tell you it
[1:19:18] takes the isav of the Holy Ghost on your
[1:19:22] eyes to make you realize what you really
[1:19:24] are
[1:19:25] how you really are whether you're
[1:19:27] lukewarm or not whether you're kind of
[1:19:29] naked now is't that right not really
[1:19:32] dressed in the robe of his
[1:19:34] righteousness remember there was a
[1:19:36] wedding ceremony given invitation given
[1:19:40] and I was a whole group of people they
[1:19:42] were all invited and they came in with
[1:19:44] their
[1:19:46] invitation amen is that right isn't that
[1:19:49] how you come Lord you said whosoever
[1:19:52] will let him come I'm bringing my
[1:19:55] invitation Here I Am Lord am mean I come
[1:19:58] to your supper I'm coming to your
[1:20:02] wedding
[1:20:03] amen but when the Lord come and he
[1:20:06] checked everybody else there was
[1:20:07] somebody in there didn't have the
[1:20:09] wedding garment as brother bam said in
[1:20:12] the orience and so forth when you come
[1:20:14] to that wedding you give them the
[1:20:16] invitation and they bring you in and
[1:20:18] they put a robe on you they put a
[1:20:21] certain robe on you and I don't care if
[1:20:22] you're rich poor I don't care what you
[1:20:25] are you look like everybody
[1:20:27] else y all look the same how many knows
[1:20:30] that's the way with the baptism of the
[1:20:32] Holy Ghost when God puts a robe on you
[1:20:34] there's no big eyes and no little
[1:20:37] use we're all one
[1:20:40] group but there was a one in there that
[1:20:42] did not have the robe and he says how
[1:20:44] did you get in here sir and he was
[1:20:46] speechless how many knows there's a lot
[1:20:49] of people that is trying to get into
[1:20:50] heaven their own way and boy are they
[1:20:54] going to be
[1:20:55] disappointed when he comes up there I
[1:20:57] never knew you depart from me you
[1:21:00] haven't got the robe
[1:21:02] on and Lord help me to wear the robe I
[1:21:06] want to be a robe
[1:21:08] wearer robe of his
[1:21:11] righteousness dress in his righteousness
[1:21:14] back to our
[1:21:15] thought how do I know well first of
[1:21:21] all how long have you been a Christian
[1:21:26] how long have you been a
[1:21:28] Christian how many trials have you
[1:21:33] had how hard has it
[1:21:36] been what all did you go
[1:21:39] through and then the final
[1:21:42] question where are
[1:21:44] you where are you a lot of people ain't
[1:21:47] nowhere to be
[1:21:49] found but if you're still there you
[1:21:52] still love God that means that he had to
[1:21:56] have some root tribulation distress and
[1:21:58] everything else couldn't shake you from
[1:22:02] it and you're part of that group that
[1:22:04] brings forth a hund fold that's the
[1:22:06] group I want to be with I want to be one
[1:22:08] of them that bring forth a h
[1:22:11] hundredfold and that has Deep
[1:22:14] Roots when I think of that with deep
[1:22:16] roots brother brand I think you know oh
[1:22:20] my a mule brother Braham says mule
[1:22:23] little you know he's he can't breathe
[1:22:26] himself back he can't have any children
[1:22:27] he can't go anywhere he's just dead he's
[1:22:29] just done he'll wait for his dying day
[1:22:31] to kick
[1:22:32] you ain't that
[1:22:39] right he's trying to wiy like a
[1:22:43] horse don't sound too good does it no
[1:22:47] but Braham said but you talk talk about
[1:22:49] you know the old the old
[1:22:53] meal days of Miracles is
[1:22:56] passed no more miracles there's no Holy
[1:22:59] Ghost but for the
[1:23:04] 12 so
[1:23:06] sad going to a church where there's a
[1:23:10] bunch of
[1:23:11] mules
[1:23:14] hybrids

[1:23:20] Church they don't want none of these

[1:23:26] ones around her is that right amen
[1:23:30] aren't you glad you're one of them I'm
[1:23:33] glad I'm one of them they don't want you
[1:23:35] around but God
[1:23:37] does they don't want no screaming
[1:23:39] shouting young acts 238 because that's
[1:23:42] the only kind of word brings
[1:23:44] forth
[1:23:46] amen but you take a genuine horse when
[1:23:50] he's like a horse you know comes up to
[1:23:53] you and snuggles on you like a horse
[1:23:56] amen runs like that you
[1:23:59] know boy I like to see my Donna's horse
[1:24:02] run sometime even that Little Pony man
[1:24:05] he can go 100 mile hour that little guy

[1:24:24] great grandfather your name was written
[1:24:26] in the Lamb's Book of Life from the
[1:24:28] foundation of the world when God when
[1:24:30] John John the Revelator identified

[1:24:54] subject to him he says don't worry about
[1:24:56] that don't be so happy about that but
[1:24:58] Rejoice because your names are written
