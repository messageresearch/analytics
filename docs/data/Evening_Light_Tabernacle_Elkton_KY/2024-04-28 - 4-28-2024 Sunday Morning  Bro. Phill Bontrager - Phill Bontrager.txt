[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning am I know there's some missing and some out lot traveling but there's more than two or three here this morning and he promised us that he wouldd be in our midst so if we'll just all stand this morning maybe brother uh Joe will open us in prayer this morning today a day faces people seat we St people how that happen we're blessed this morning Lord Jesus but Lord we need you more time in this building for all of us this is where the house of judgment is we're in court this morning going realize right headed in the right it't looking good but they have something the their heart realize this is where you change this is where you start and we know Jesus eventually there a't no and we it's all aroundin we used to be all our looking way now it's here Lord I pray that you come this day Lord that you help not only me but all my friends also we commit this service you already know everything we don't even have Lord here dayus amen amen the children can be dismissed for Sunday school and if you go with me in the Psalms to Psalms 37 going to read a few verses in Psalm 37 like brother Joe prayed talking about the end times for a long time but it looks like we have arrived so Psalms 37 we're going to start in verse one and we're going to read up to verse 13 here fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity trust in the Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the Lord they shall inherit the Earth but the meek shallan her the Earth and shall Delight themselves in the abundance of Peace this one together the Lord shall laugh at him him for he seeth that his day is coming God bless you you may be seated brother Brian Lord bless you all if you would uh turn with me to I'll try to get this mic right uh to the Gospel of John the first chapter I you know you could just spend U hours just in this 37th Psalm here and as you read this first verse here as you turn to the uh first chapter of the Gospel of John it says threaten not thyself because the evildoers neither be thou evance against the workers of iniquity and you know we we're in an age now where after several generations of given out participation trophies to people and not holding people accountable for their actions and the way they treat other people we're at where we're at this morning you know and I was just thinking and it's it's it's simple but you can't it's really simple out what's going on out there in the world they refuse to accept truth when it's presented to them and they've gone on for Generations not accepting the simple truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and that's where we're at this morning that's where we're at today you know those people that are fussing with you you tell them the truth and I I'm not trying to be funny you you express the truth out of God's word to them what do they say to you well that's your truth I have my own truth that's exact that's exactly what they're going to say to you and to a point that they'll laugh at you they mock you they don't believe it and you can't force people to believe the word of God and um I never I I know I say that I won't say it but can it get worse yes it can get worse can it get better no it's not going to get any better out there it's only going to get worse the prophet of the age told you that as they continually to turn their backs on the Living God and refuse to do what the word of God tells them to do it only gets worse so where we're at this morning it's only going to get 10 times worse or fast than it was yesterday or today so it's not going to get any better but it should drive us as Christians and as Believers to want to get closer to the word of God and get closer to Jesus Christ and it's really simple they want a savior but they don't want a lord it's the Lord Jesus Christ it's not just the Savior but he has to be the Lord of your heart and of your life and that's why the world isn't the way it is this morning because they just want the Savior part they don't want anything telling them what they can and cannot do now is it legalism or is it law no it's love but to them it's legalism it's not love and it's a crazy place this morning but it going to the Gospel of John I was just going to read this is I've read this out of this before I'm not used to holding a mic but this is a World War II devotional that I I read every morning and this was an Evangelical Church preacher this is what they had for a devotional the men during World War II so this is 80 plus years old and I was Wren reading this what this man had their wife for this day for these and the uh scripture was Philippians the 4th chapter which is a really important chapter but I'll just read what he had to say and this was in 1940 1941 so brother and this is before brother Brandon preached that final message so we're several years before that in the 1950s but this is what this man had to say Christianity is the power of God in the soul of man and that's the truth the word of God Christianity is your power it's what needs to abide in your soul and your life this morning and then a personal experience of the Christian it ought to provide an inner resource of spiritual power for daily living and that all f is in one simple thought you have to be baptized in the Holy Ghost that's the only way this true Christianity is going to express itself through you and your life and he goes on to say hoping I don't lose my place for daily living it if it it doeses not do this for us our Christianity is not functioning properly and we have failed to respond with adequate Faith to what God in Christ has freely offered to us that that's just as true this morning as it was in 1941 and down the centuries multitudes of folks of every condition and every station found through Christian faith resources for the Triumph of daily living and we're no different this morning it's through the word of God this morning that you'll be successful that you'll have Triumph in the world this morning not in the world itself but in what God does for you in it and um I lost my place again I hope I don't keep Brea beset with difficult suffering trials desasters toss hither Yonder by life's changing circumstances that could not be beaten in every situation they endured as seeing him who was invincible and this goes back to you can take this right back to uh Hebrews the 11th chapter what he's saying here listen to one of these Heroes of Faith I have learned in whatsoever State I am and he's talking about Philippians the fourth chapter here I've learned in whatsoever State I am therein debound in everything in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to hungry and both to abound to be in want I can do all things in him who strengthened me so completely that the great Apostle learned the secret at the close of the s looking back he could say I have fought the good fight and this goes back to Timothy in the in the go in Timothy good fight and I have finished the course and I have kept the faith what Christianity meant for Paul it mean it means for us in increasing measure if by faith trust and prayer and communion with Christ will they hold upon the manifold grace of God so he wrote this for soldiers going in to battle in 19441 and 42 well it's no different as you as a as a Christian shoulder this morning that's the same thing that'll make you successful tomorrow or today is putting everything that you are every little bit of yourself into the word of God and into Jesus Christ this morning will make you successful can you do it in yourself no I can't do it in myself but as long as I have Christ abiding in me I can do it through him be successful and I was um I'll just read and I was I'm not it's just a crazy world out there but it's a serious time but I I was noticing if you're not careful there's a spirit that'll put you asleep in the age that we're in it'll put you totally asleep and the things that are going on won't mean anything to you but I'll just read what uh in the I'll try not to read this whole chapter I know I read a lot in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God God and the same in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and it's no different today for us everything that we are is in him this morning and I I'll promise not to reread the same verses time and time again in him was life and the life was the light of men and that's no different for us this morning 2 years ago when John wrote this gospel it's just as effective for us this morning as it was all the way back you have to believe that though I can say that a minister can say that anyone can say that but it has to be made real to you and your heart and life or it doesn't mean anything and uh there was a man sent from God whose name was John and the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe and he was not the light but was sent to Bear witness of the light and that was the true life which lith every man that cometh into the world for he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not excuse me and that's no different today we have the word of God this morning we have this the very Holy Ghost the presence of God living in hearts of men and women this morning and they still don't see it this morning like they didn't see it 2,000 years ago and I was thinking I was reading I'm I won't read all this I I was in this uh listening to a message this morning but I'll just read a few few more verses and then read what I had in here and then I'll sit down but as I was thinking of everything gone on in the last week in the last months you know I was thinking I was sitting there this morning and I was thinking of when Christ was talking to the Sadducees and the Pharisees and the lawyers and they really couldn't see who he was their religion their thoughts their ideas had so bound them that they couldn't see the truth or the hour that they were in 2,000 years ago and it's no different this morning in our day and age they people are just Bound by their ideas by their thoughts that they can't break through and they can break through but the only way that you can break through is by Jesus Christ getting in your heart and life and making the difference but I'll just I'll uh I lost my place I don't mean to re read all this again and he was the light but the light was sent to Bear witness of the light that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world and he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him he came onto his own and his own received him not and same thing in our day and age he came again and the world didn't receive him again and you see what's going on out there in the world it's the same it's no different you know it wasn't 40 years after this gospel was preached that the second temple was destroyed and the Romans totally destroyed the Jewish Nation and in the 12th verse but as many as received him he gave power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which are not which were born not of blood nor will but of the or of the flesh but of the will of man but of gods and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace but we have it a little bit different this morning you can actually have the presence this morning in your heart and life and I'll just read this quote and then I'll sit down I I promise not to go another 10 minutes after what I just said and and I was just listen this is um this there is only one provided only um I'm not reading there's only one way provided by God for anything and that's true this morning there's only one way God has provided for us this morning to be successful and be there on that day and I'll just I'll just read uh there's these three quotes it's 142 in this message down to 144 these are one of these old spoken word books that have a concordance at the end at the back of it but I'll just read these three and sit down the accepted they accepted God's provided way he kept the fire off of them there wasn't even a smell of fire on them they went God's in up talking about the Hebrew children there provided way and the wise men that needed accompass to guide them to the newborn babe but God provided a star see they took the star that's all they needed and we have a way we have a star this morning we have guidance this morning and it's the word of God and the message for the hour this morning excuse me here and the world needed a savior God provided a son amen and this this is the quote I was thinking about talking about this morning the church needed power and God provided the Holy Ghost and that's really important this morning it's not a man's idea it's not a man pushing a program or a away the way the Church of God is successful was by the power of the Holy Ghost this morning he didn't provide a book of Ethics he didn't provide a Christian government he provided the holy ghost that was God's provided that's what God provided he never said go up there and study at Jerusalem up there until I get a certain amount of Education in you until you're indoctrinate indoctrinate you and so and so and it's the same way you can you can study all the message books you can study all the books in the Bible but if you don't get that Holy Ghost in you it won't profit you any on that day and so M to you and document and so he said waiting to you and DED with power on high after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and then you shall be my Witnesses in Jerusalem M Samaria in Chicago Illinois and so forth and see all the world that's God's provided witness is the Holy Ghost God didn't provide a book of Ethics he didn't provide a denomination I was thinking this morning and that's true this morning a denomination won't save you an idea won't save you but the Holy Ghost and Jesus Christ will save you this morning brother David or oh brother Josh and let's stand this morning we just have one announcement this morning Austin asked food announce uh if you could please RSVP by Tuesday if people can make it

amen amen God bless you we're going to read out of John the 10th chapter uh several verses John 10 we'll start at verse 30 John 10 and 30 I and my father are one then the Jews took up stones again to Stone him and Jesus answered them many good works have I showed you for my father for which which of those Works do you Stone me the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy because that thou being a man makest thyself God drop down to verse 37 if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do though you believe not me believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of their hand you may have a seat this morning if you like to today I want to speak on the thought stumbling over a body stumbling over a body so we want to look at what this body is we know we're talking about the body of Christ this is what people stumble over so we're going to read out of Hebrews if you want to turn to Hebrews 10 we're going to read several verses here also we just go down here and we're going to make some comments here this is just kind of a foundation for what I want to speak on so let's put this foundation in here Hebrews 10 and one it says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect so what we're seeing here is God gave him the law he gave him the sacrifices but there is a fault with them because they could not eradicate sin they could only cover sin for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sin what happens friend is when you once purged from your evil desires your nature is changed and all of a sudden you find out that these things you used to desire you don't desire them anymore it's an amazing thing to go through it is the greatest miracle God ever performed to take you and I in this frail weak Fallen condition thank you Jesus and he says I want to be one with you I'm going to change your nature so I can indwell you and you say but I am so weak you know what you're doing stumbling over a body you're very own I just preach my whole Ser go that's the whole Point verse three but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goat should take away sin it only covered it it only covered sin that's very important he said wherefore when it cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me why because those sacrifices weren't enough he had to have a body to do what to restore the fellowship that had been lost at Eden brother and sister the one the main purpose God has of everything he's done since back before time all the way down to this time like the brother said we've been hearing about the end time our whole life and here we are the whole purpose friends was just to have fellowship with his kids that's the whole thing anytime you get your focus off of that you are focusing on the wrong thing all he wants is your heart that's all don't give him anything else don't offer him anything else just your heart a body hast thou prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou had no pleasure he did not have pleasure he said but it's what he gave yes he gave him it it was to a space fer it to restore a a level of Fellowship because sin is what what sin is what separates us from God it's the only thing sin nothing else all right and so what he had to do he had a whole plan all the way back from Eden all the way up to now he had a whole plan and that whole plan is's going to go through time and he's going to show himself and reveal himself reveal his attributes until all the way down at the end so we know exactly who he is but back during that time he said now I'm only going to cover sin the the the animal blood is only going to cover sin so I can Fellowship you but from a distance from a distance it's got to be a distance but I had no pleasure in that he had to put up with it and we put up with it but but but what it was brother and sisters he was saying we're going to do this for a while that's that dispensation but the thing is there's a body coming there got a body that I no longer have the you cover sin I'm going to eradicate sin so I can be one with you like you've never had all the way back to the time of Eden friends if that would drop into our hearts right now we would literally go through this roof oh my just the reality of that and not saying you don't know this you don't realize it but there's so much layers there's so much depth to that Revelation that what God wants for you as an individual in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin that thou had no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me what he saying it's God's word that I'm going to come he said to do thy will oh God what is this to do thy will it's because he is not going to be he's going to be the sinless sacrifice to do his will is not to be sin it's not to be sinful so brother and sister the way he could be our sacrifice because he did the will and it's talking about his sinlessness and brother and sister when you leave that on him you're stumbling over your body don't you do it don't say well he was a sinless one so now here I am I'm good to go brother and sister you must recognize that you also are sinless amen praise the Lord that's the trth I tell you what brother and sister that just gets all over my flesh because I said but I make mistakes every day I've been up for what I got about five or six or whatever and that's what 10 five hours how many how many bad thoughts have I had in the last five hours how many things have I like thought the wrong thing or and I don't think I've said too much bad things yet but I probably will before the end of the day maybe if I'm by myself I won't but it's just the truth we're going to find out if you can if you can conf conf this by the time we get done today Lord willing above when he said sacrifice and offerings and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither had pleasure the him which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will oh oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all my that's enough friends it's once for all that's all it takes you have one sacrifice and that blood has never lost its power it will never lose its power it will put you in a Rapture it will take care of every problem that you have if you will accept it if you will accept it well I accept the blood then why are we trying to be so legalistic and trying to live such a holy life if we think the blood of Jesus Christ is what cleanses us and then we offer the blood plus our own Holiness like the brother said this isn't legalism it's love and when we can get past all that legalistic aspect and realize that it's God's completed work on Calvary we can walk free from a lot of the stuff that kind of binds us down amen that's my Foundation now we're going to read out of Acts we're going to start preaching acts 7 and verse 45 this is Stephen right before he got stoned he's preaching and he's making him so mad he knows he's making him mad he probably knows he's about to get killed but you know what he did he did it anyways because he was called for this job this purpose and how we how many times has this this this sermon he preached how many times has been used down through the centuries just for us God put it in there what a sacrifice he gave so we can have this today so he's talking about he's talking about Israel he said verse 45 which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus that's Joshua into the possession of the Gentiles who God dve out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David and David who found favor before God desired to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him his house so what is it was David said you know what here he is I got this beautiful palace I'm living in we got all this going on but he's got his his Temple is his tabernac still attend he says let's build a house for him and God said okay he said but you can't do it you got too much blood we'll have Salomon build it there's so many types in there we're not going to get into all that but Solomon buil a magnificent place to live it's just one of the most amazing buildings of his ever built literally it's just because of spirituality that went into it how be it now he built him his great big wonderful what we call it church today right he said how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as sayith the prophet Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot still what house will you build me sayith the Lord and what is the place of my rest so what we see here brother and sister is just like the law the sacrifices God said yeah go ahead and build me this house but let me tell you something that ain't my final resting place that is not what gives me pleasure he could send the same thing he did about the sacrifice he said I like it Solomon thanks but it gives me no pleasure because it just tells me that I'm not reached the end what I'm looking for yet I'm going to find a place of rest not built with hands no man can build me a church for living no one can give me a religion I can live in I want your heart and that's the only thing I'm ever going to find pleasure in is when I have you your heart individual not as a group he don't come in oh I got all you no it's you as an individual that he wants fellowship with that's all he's ever looked for that's why we get so discouraged because we see well I I'm just not worthy to be to Fellowship God I'm not worthy of this of course you're not worthy get over your bad self you're never going to be worthy he didn't ask you to be worthy he said I am the worthy one I'm the son one I'm the one who did God's will now you just accept what I did for you and quit getting so discouraged when you make mistakes Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me sayith the Lord what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things it it's sort of like this it's sort of like this uh birthday right and so dad has a birthday so little Susie wants to get him a birthday present but she ain't got no money Daddy can I have some money okay here Daddy I bought you the birthday present well yeah but I gave you the money for it that's what we have to offer god well we build you as a beautiful Church by the way I love this church it's beautiful God loves that you did this but he gave you to you to build give it back to him see what I'm saying so when we think we've done something cuz oh we go go to church all the time oh wow let's focus on your purpose Fellowship that's what he wants from you now we use the church we use all this stuff we do to get that Fellowship but recognize that he whatever you give back to him he already gave it to you right so it's not like we're doing some great thing or something we're just accepting what he's done hath not my hand made all these things verse 51 this what we want to get to he really tore into him that he said ye stiff neck and uncircumcised in heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye resisting headship why do they resist headship headship for their preferred religion you can go all the way back look what look what Adam did he fell and what did he do he offered God a religion Cain and Abel Cain comes along offers God religion Abel was accepted because he offered God blood he offered by Revelation he knew what God would accept Cain didn't have that Revelation he offered the wrong thing but he got mad when God wouldn't accept it resisting the Holy Ghost all the way down through time God has always given the word for that day do this do this and people some will do it the Believers do it but how many people resist it because it's not what they want why did Cain not do what Abel said what Abel did he could have been accepted but he said no I am not going to have that kind of religion I have my own religion I'm going to take my religion and that's the same the same attitude people have ever since then all the way down to now that's why this church is not packed out with more people there's plenty of people out in church today all around this area but you know what they have their own religion because they refused God's provided way for Fellowship they said no God we're going to worship you the way I want to now let's not go too far out these doors cuz there's a lot of us in here still have some of those same ideas that's why we keep coming to church CU this is God provided way to expose that devil to expose that false religion that hybrid religion and get rid of it so you can have what a closer relationship with Jesus Christ which is all he ever wanted what are we doing we want to cover our sin you know that's why that's why when Jesus came I'm so ahead of myself that's why when Jesus came they didn't want to accept him because they had had the law and that law with those sacrifice could cover their sin but it didn't have to change their nature that's why so many message Believers sit in the pews and they preach and they sing and they worship and they're the most wonderful people in the world but they don't want the new birth because you got to die to yourself and it's got to change your nature and so you can sit in a Pew and pretend like you're a Believer and really be sincere about it but you know what you're just never going to come to that place of death to yourself because not b I like the way I am I don't want to change change is very difficult for human beings well I'm I'm popular with the kids I hang out with I'm popular at school I don't want to be one of those Fanatics and people look at me like I'm some crazy person they're not going to like me as well praise the Lord but I went to The Altar and I prayed and I shouted and I danced and you didn't change a bit that's right that don't change you friends your change is when you humble yourself and you accept what God said about you and you allow him to burn all that stuff out of you and you go ahead and walk like one of these weird Fanatics around [Music] here that's what God's looking for God provided a way for Fellowship it's a sacrifice it's that body he prepared and that body is still in account it's still uh uh what's what I'm looking for it still is a effective today but Satan causes us to lose focus he says focus on your religion focus on your Holiness focus on your mistakes focus on your ministry focus on all this other stuff focus on how many people come to church focus on what you're doing for the body focus on all these other things but don't focus on your relationship with Christ that scares him when you will when you will get rid of all the distractions oh my get rid of all the distraction actions and all you see all you say I just want to see you Jesus Christ you're all I need and brother and sister you say oh he is all I need and when that becomes more than a song but your very life you know you're getting somewhere with God because nothing else matters besides that and you do all the rest of the stuff you have to do but there's one thing I have desired and that's to dwell in the house of the Lord not in this church in his presence yeah then do everything else you want to do enjoy this life but make sure Christ is first amen cuz Satan will do all he can to persuade you to alter God's sacrifice to alter his word to alter anything to get you distracted on the main thing that's all he's trying to do just get you to to be on the m and just take a little time just stretch I got a little bit more time I can enjoy this a little bit longer okay but do you look around lately do you see the signs of their tribulation you see the people out there they're they're chanting gas to Jews gas the Jews death to America these are Americans that's the very thing that the tribulation period is going to be killing everybody off that spirit so if you all want to not get born again stick around for the tribulation period look around you're going to be the target you will be the target of those people they w't be saying gas the Jews are going to say gas those message Believers I ain't playing and neither is God I'm gonna I'm gonna get way out of order here not out of order about what I was going to preach let's talk about David David was a man after God's Own Heart and I've heard it said many times it's because David could repent and I I go along with that to an extent and let me explain why when he says David is a man after God's Own Heart that means he is a heart like God according to God's heart God did not have to repent and so you say well God didn't David's heart to repent wasn't like God's to repent so there got to be something a little deeper than that making sense Adam when he made a mistake when he fell what did he do he covered his sin when David did something wrong what did he do he repented why why did David repent why was such in his heart to repent no matter what it was he'd humble himself he let the whole Kingdom know what the mistakes he made Saul didn't have that approach when Saul made a mistake he went he he made excuses he blamed other people he did not repent why not because David's heart was like God's heart as the as the the heart panth after the Waterberg so panth my heart after thee Oh Lord when will I appear before you why because David his his desire was to be in God's presence he had that fellowship with God and nothing else mattered and he knew when he made a mistake when he sinned he was separated from God's presence and he had to get back in there and it didn't matter how humble he had to get he said I've got to be in your presence that's why he had a heart a heart after God the same kind of heart why because nothing's going to keep him out of God's presence look at Jacob and Esau Esau was a good guy he took care of his dad he was a a deacon in the church he was very sincere you look at him say what a wonderful person he was but he didn't have a lot of care of respect for the god of his his grandfather Abraham he really didn't care too much about that yeah I'm religious that's enough for me but what is Jacob's approach Jacob said I will lie I will cheat I will steal I will do whatever it takes but I'm going to know this God of my grandfather Abraham God had respect to that he said that's just like me I will do anything I have to to be in your presence I will I will humble myself I will come to Earth in the body of a man I will be tortured I will be beat I will die I will become sinned I will go to hell but nothing is GNA keep you out of my presence little bride you know what he's saying to you right now he's saying as a heart pth out of the waterbrook so pth my soul after my little bride he has the same attitude David had he has the same attitude you Believers had is that nothing is going to stop me from fellowshipping with you think about that you think oh I'm seeking God I'm just I'm just praying I'm just hoping you're not giving anything back to him he ain't give to you if you have a desire for him it's cuz he put that desire in there if you have a longing for God he put that longing in there and nothing can take it out of there if it's anchored in there because it comes from the seed that was put in there before the foundation of the world that's his attitude towards you then what are you going to offer him oh well God I prayed 30 minutes yesterday and I read my Bible for two chapters you see where religion gets really lame empty it's no wonder so many people are just looking for this and looking for some kind of entertainment running here and running into that because all we have so much is just not all we have but so much we offer is just religion it's just religion God said I have no pleasure in your religion why are you living that way what's the purpose well I'm doing right friend is oh my goodness friend if you're only doing right just because it's the right thing to do you need to fall in love with Jesus Christ because all you have is an empty legalist religion my look at look what God does he sends preachers he sends your mom and dad to raise your he sends preach and what's he doing he's almost begging you he repent repent and what happens we have besetting sins we have addiction we have things we can't get over and we go and we repent and we pray you know get back in the presence of God and then we do it again and we do it again and and three years later we're still having this problem and we get to the point like I just I just feel like such a hypocrite I just feel like SE I I just don't know what to do I trying to overcome this I'm trying to overcome I just can't get over I have this bad attitude I I keep doing this I keep doing that and God is saying repent but I just repented yesterday of this I feel like a hypocrite repent again please he's begging you repent why because he wants to be in your presence he wants to have fellowship with you and he can't do that over sin so all he's saying is just keep repenting keep coming back to The Well of Grace my Mercy endures forever it will not run out all I need you to do is just keep repenting until you get it right what keeps bringing you back because you have to be in his presence because there's something about it that just keeps drawing you back but I feel so bad I have this weakness brother and sister can let me just give you something this is some how you overcome it when it becomes love when your love for God is so strong that it's stronger than that Temptation say is throwing at you when your love your need to be in his presence is so great that when Satan comes and knocks on your door hey would you like this you like no I don't want that anymore lock the go away I have no need for you anymore because I have found a greater satisfaction something that you and your worldly attractions can't even touch brother and sister I hope you know what I'm talking about because if not you got to get there friends that presence is your satisfaction that presence is so amazing that when when Satan comes to off you this off you that you say no you say I'm not there yet well this is what you do friends you fall on this Stone we're going to talk about we'll get there you humble yourself you know how you be humble oh I'm trying to be so humble God I'm so weak I'm I'm so weak I'm I'm just just a miserable Sinner and I that's not humble the way you be humble is to be honest you know what we pray so many times God I'm trying so hard to overcome this I'm just trying so hard and I'm doing all he said that's not what I ask for first of all just accept what I did for you and then be honest with him I'm G get really a little bit kick in the gut here the reason we have these besetting sins that things the addictions whatever you want to call them the things we stumble over our weaknesses is because we don't love God enough yet there's your humility instead of God I'm trying so hard to overcome God I don't love you enough yet try that on for size that hurts but I love God I love it with all my heart heart then why are we still going to this thing and going to that thing and going to that it's your choice it's your choice he said but the Temptation is so strong yeah because you don't love him enough otherwise all you're doing is dos and don'ts and I quit doing this brother Phil I feel so much better that's wonderful I'm glad you quit that but why why did you quit it so you can live holy enough so you don't feel like a hypocrite coming to church or because you love Jesus Christ chist so much that that thing lost its attraction to you there is the difference between going in the bride and stay in here for the tribulation period let's let's pretend I'm going to pretend a little bit I get married and I come home from work and my wife's not there she left me a note she said I'm hanging out with Bob Bob he's your old boyfriend well you know we're just going to do dinner not going to do anything I me I'm not going to kiss him probably what kind of a husband what am I going to be thinking about my wife and yet when we go and do these things we know we're shouldn't be doing it's exactly what we're doing to Jesus Christ we claim him as our husband but we're still out here flirting around with our old boyfriends but you know what kind of husband he is he gets on the phone he says honey please come home I'll forgive you I'll forgive you come home I'm longing for you I can never quit loving you come home friends can't you trust a guy like that can't you trust can't you love a guy like that he'll do anything for you hasn't he proved himself he hasn't he proven that he will do anything look what he's brought you through what we need friend is our love perfected not our Holiness not our Doctrine not our church going not our tithe pan we don't need those things perfected we need our love perfected how does that happen brother and sister because he takes through hardships and through every hardship if you have the right attitude you come out on the other side and your love is greater than it was Hallelujah every time that he puts you through something he allows something to happen is so that afterwards he will have a closer relationship with you than you did before that's what every trial is about every time you've been sick every grief every sorrow every loss every stumble that you did is so that he could prove to you how much he loves you he's wooing you come to me can't you see how much I love you can't you see that I'm faithful I have never failed you you can find no fault in me find fault in him if you can but you can't he's talking taking you through everything that you've been through every hardship every fear all the trauma you've experienced all the abuse you've experienced God is bringing you to a place that said hav not I taken care of you through it all show me where I've been unfaithful show me where I haven't taken care of your situation oh man oh Lord Jesus let me tell you what Jesus the the whole purpose of Jesus existence is to restore Fellowship between God and man you give him a purpose for being without us he had no purpose he had no reason to come he had no reason to die on the cross he has no purpose of coming in that body that body prepared except for you thank you Lord that's the only thing that's the only thing that gives him purpose he did not come just to enjoy the the beautiful Outdoors he didn't come just to walk the mountains he didn't come just to hang out and eat and drink and be married he came because he said I need a fellowship with you the individual person don't try to hide in the Pew in a group don't try to well I'm just part of the group here I just kind of listen to that no no no no you got to have it individually friend it's not an emotion it's not an emotion this world has taught us that emotions are our truth what the brother was talking about your emotions are not the truth you could say well brother Phil I really want this relationship I'm going to really get sincere I'm just really no no you don't I mean you might try but that ain't going to get it that's just more religion all the effort look how sincere you've been some of I the sincerity sometime amazing I've seen the most sincere people and they're completely wrong sincerely wrong those people who are protesting against Israel they're very sincere they're willing to go to jail God don't care about that sincerity that don't mean anything to him you know how you get sincere is you fall in love with him that brings sincerity that's how you do it all right let me move on now we see brother brand speaking he now we see we are building a building not a wall the builders want to take a line of blocks and just go straight down any Builder can build that it takes a real matched mechanic to turn the corner when you got to cut the corner that's the time it shows whether you're really a stonem or not when you can turn the corner with it and keep the continuity of the rest of the building but turn the corner now it's on these Corners is when troubles come the builders want to keep building on down but we're not building a building but I'm building a wall but a building so what we have here brother and sister is down through time and we can see it through the the Bible we see it uh in the church ages when God gives a word for an a day for that age and they walk down there and they're going along and you know it's a new word and they're fine and then what happens it starts becoming conventional wisdom conventional conventional religion and they get relaxed and they say well yeah let's go down and offer our sheep for sacrifice and what happens it just becomes a dos and don'ts instead of a relationship with God and so what God does he comes he says it's time to turn a corner and they resist and that's where the Trouble Comes because we get comfortable we don't like change amen we're comfortable in our religion and God said anytime you get comfortable in your religion you're lukewarm your backslid and you don't love me the way you should that's what happened down we we can look at the church ages the you know the the word came to Paul and all those people back there but then it went off into the first church age and they started hybriding the word and they're going down building the church and then God says Let's Make a Difference here we got to make a move and so Luther comes along and they take a left turn a right turn whatever and they turn and go this way but all those people who refused to walk with Luther they kept on building the wall and that wall goes all the way down they fall into the pit they're Blinded By the Light that was in Luther and so what happens lutherans are going along and they're the Bride of the age they're walking in all the light they see and then all of a sudden God comes along says okay now you got two you're so backslid you don't you're you're you lost your heart you don't love me anymore the way you should so I got to show more light I got to turn the corner and so the next Reformation come along and there's Wesley and the Methodist and they turn the corner but the Lutheran keep on going down straight and then Pentecost comes the same way and they keep going like and they got light and they think this is it they think this is the last move because they had the restoration of the gifts they think it's the Total Restoration but then God sends us a prophet he got a message and the Pentecost will say no I'm going to keep going this way because I don't like what you're doing Psalms 118 it says the stone which the builders refuse to become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes that word marvelous means wonderful surpassing be to be Beyond one's power be difficult to do difficult to understand why because we got to the place we start leaning to our own understanding we have our own religion and God said I'm doing something different he said that don't make sense according to my religion that's not making according to what I believe he said yeah I know that's why it's marvelous it's my doing and it's not yours it's a body that no handmade it's my body and I'm the Constructor of this thing my building I'm building it Isaiah said therefore thus sayith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone a tried Stone oh it's been proven a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation what is it it's the word for the day made manifest and you can rest your soul on it he that believeth shall not make haste oh my you you can rest on it you you you he's he's faithful to his word friends that's what he's saying every corner friends God turns Corners is for a place to increase Fellowship to get get closer to his people he doesn't just turn a COR just for the fun of it he's building a building where he can rest and every time he turns the corner it's so that the people can have a closer walk with him so he can have a closer walk with them and people love their religion more than they love him and so they stay in their own wall and keep going said I don't need to change I don't need to change it's just human nature instead of an opportunity to increase Fellowship they just stay in their old religion we're going to look at this how this played out in John 1522 Jesus is speaking to these folks if I had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin what's he saying he's saying there's Pharisees the Levites the priests all these folks and they were walking in the light that they had and they were just fine they were Believers if they would have died in that they would have gone to heaven but he said then I come along and I spoke the word for their day for the new age to turn the corner getting them out of Law and into Grace that's exactly what he said and I came and I told him the right word the word for the day but they refused to walk in it now they have no excuse for their sin anymore if I had not come they would have had no sin but because he came now they had sin but then he doesn't go on he that hateth me hateth my father also wait a minute he said they hated him because they didn't follow his religion he said well that's kind of strong isn't it I mean just because you don't follow that religion no it's hate we're going to see more about that then he goes on to say this verse 24 if I had not done among them The Works which none other man did they had not had sin now they have both seen and hated both me and my father so he said I came and I spoke to them and then the works I did backed up and witnessed that I was telling them the truth and they still hated me because they love their religion more than they love the light they wanted to walk on in darkness instead of turning the corner into more light if you go to John 3 it says this for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever whoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he said I'm giving you an opportunity to be saved he didn't come to condemn he didn't come to send people to hell he came to say it's time to turn the corner it's time to have a close relationship with me come with me follow the new light turn the corner and this is the condemnation that light is comeing to the world and Men loved Darkness rather than light because they are fornicators and drunkers and murderers no no no they were holy people because their deeds were evil now there's your Holiness those priests and all sudden run out and start sleeping around and and doing all kinds of horrible stuff stealing and all that no they still live that very holy life but they refus to walk in the new light why because they Deeds were evil and that darkness that light exposed the deadness of their religion it exposed the deadness it's time for more light it's time for more word to be manifest and he proved that by his words his his his deeds backed up witnessed his true and yet they love Darkness rather than they love light for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light L his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth come to the light that his needs may be made manifest that they are wrought in God god brother and sister that's why we come to church that's why we Fellowship that's why we do the things we do to serve God because we want to see we want the light to witness that it's it's in me that word is living through me I need that witness in myself I need that light because I can sit on a Pew I can say Amen at everything the preacher preaches I can shout I can sing I can worship I can live a good life but I need a witness I need the word to be proven it's got to be more than just the words I say it's so important what you say but the holy Spirit has to witness that what I'm saying is actually happening cuz I have come to the light and if it's not there I need that exposed so I can get rid of all that Darkness I need to get rid of all the darkness I got to get rid of everything in there that's not light especially in this age because you have no excuse in this age to keep any of that false religion in fact if you keep it and you keep HB reading the word you will not go into Rapture cuz he will only marry a virgin bride Hallelujah and this is your privilege to be in the the bride in this age when all the culmination of everything comes together and you have the opportunity to be one with him like no other age has had the pentec example Pentecost they had they had camped down on that that speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost you're born again right well the prophet came WR and said that's not true what did he do he show light the word it wasn't the prophet it was the word show light on the error of that Doctrine what did they do brother Bram is a false prophet we're not going to listen to that we got all these people we have the sins we have our our assembly our Council come together and we agree speaking in tongues is the evidence of the baptis Holy Ghost building their wall fall into the pit blinded by that light because they love their religion more than they love the light and Jesus said they hated the light right well we don't hate you we just disagree with you no it's hatred that's a strong word but I didn't say it see because when the new light comes the old light goes out and they prioritize their religion over Fellowship it's so much easier to do so much easier than to die to yourself than to humble yourself every day I'm a good person brother Phil I follow the rules so did Esau all right I'm getting I'm gonna get done here in a second so he said well how does this apply to us what's this all about stumbling over a body well they stumbled over the body of Christ because because they could not accept that he was their sacrifice because they love their animal sacrifices they stumble over that you as a you as a man make yourself God let me just read this again I and my father are one then the Jews took up stones again to Stone him why because you make yourself equal God he said they said for good works we Stone thee not but for blasphemy because that thou being a man makest thyself God Jesus didn't make himself God God made him God right John 17:11 Jesus said now I am no more in the world but these are in the world I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name Those whom thou Hast given me that they may be one as we are so Jesus is not only saying I and my father are one he says I and my kids are one I and my bride are one make us one like we are like I and the the father and him are one make us one the same way can you keep going me on this John 17:20 says neither pray I for these alone but also for them which Shall Believe on them through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me you hear what he's praying he said I want to be one with them the way I'm one with the father and if you're one with him the way he is with the father and he said I am my father are one what's your testimony do you dare say it I and my father are one you make yourself God you make yourself equal with Jesus Stone me that's the thing that wanted to Stone Jesus over and yet the revealed word for this day has restored us to that very thing that he was praying for and yet we want to sit around and conf we're some kind of Sinners or something no you're not I'm not talking about this old flesh of course this old flesh is but the real you the real you that's been born again is in eternity right now it's already been raptured it's just waiting for the rest of this to catch up with it it's sinless your soul is sinless before God right now because he has married with you he's one with you and you and that and the the Holy Spirit and you and that Soul have become one one and your testimony is I and my father are one if you dare confess it I have a hard time when I look at myself when I Stumble over this body how dare you say you're equal with Jesus Christ I'm not talking about him being God and all that I'm talking about him and I are brothers and he's not ashamed to call me his brother because we're the same family I'm just as Eternal as as he is I'm just as much a Son of God as Jesus Christ is brother Phil that's really strong who do you think you are why did the message come in this day is to produce this kind of a bride Hallelujah this is what it's for not just so we can have a good bunch of people sitting in church just being a nice bunch of people we've had that all the way down through time he said no this great in this day in this age this word is going to come to such a fulfillment that I am going to be so one with them I'm actually going to Rapture them off the earth now how do you think you're going in a Rapture if you don't confess who you are you confess it you say the word and you watch him back it up you say the word and you watch that light shine out from you and you're going to look at yourself and say I cannot believe look what's happening to me that's not my attitude those are not my words that's not my love that's not my Mercy that must be someone else inside of me that's not fil Bond treger and it's taking control [Applause] oh taking control you said brother Phil I need something back let me tell you what the prophet said he's talking about he's talking about the denominations they want to become one all the denominations gathered together right he said well Jesus pray that we all should be one brother Bram says then he also said how can you walk together how can two walk together L they be agreed he said one like he and the father are one and the father was the word and he was the word made manifest he was one with the father because he was a manifestation of God's promised word you are one with the father one you are the manifestation of God's promised word for the age you live in he said as so it is today or any other day yes sir that God is one he wants us to be one the same way he was one with the father he wants to be one with you and that's why when you say I and my father are one you are not blaspheming you're confessing who you are a lot of people can say that and it's just a Doctrine they believe it's just up here you got to get it here so you know what you're talking about because you say it from your mouth you say it from up here and you're going to be shown to be a hypocrite because people see right through that the life you're living is not the life life of Jesus Christ oh I know it's because I make mistakes have you been listening to me not because you make mistakes how do you react to mistakes well if I am the father one I don't need to repent okay Pharisee yes you do you will be the one who repents more than anybody else because you cannot stand to be out of his presence you cannot stand to allow sin to separate you from that present he said I am so sorry I am so sorry have you ever repented someone they didn't even know you did anything wrong I I'll just telling myself a little bit I was at some restaurant and there without a lot of detail I just kind of smart out to the person the the worker there she never thought about it she's so used to being smart I like to I went back to Hey listen I'm sorry what you said she's looking at me what I don't care I knew I was supposed to do that right because that was grieving me he say is that it is that all it takes well it's a start it's a start you got to you got to get rid of that sin and those those all that junk out of the way so God and you can have that fellowship and then you start growing in love that's the thing to grow in friends grow grow everything grow everything but make sure love is the main thing that's the core to the whole thing because it's going to take perfect love to go into Rapture well how do you do that just surrender yourself to God and let him do it you can't you can't do it well I'm going to start loving everybody brother Phil well you should have been doing that anyways but that's not what I'm talking about it ain't human love it's the love of God projecting through you and you cannot control that you cannot do that you cannot express it you cannot control it it's him doing it through you but he needs a surrendered vessel surrendered vessel and it's today do you stumble over this body because what he can say we can read that that same scripture we read he said sacrifices and offerings had no pleasure denominations and organized religion I had no pleasure I put up with it that's all they had but a body I have prepared a body I prepared you know where that body is I'm looking at that's right the body he has prepared in this day is you it's you can you accept that's who you are he said that's talking about Jesus exactly that's what I'm telling you you and him have become one the Christ and bride she has become him you have become so Christ in this day you're not Jesus Christ the one who died on the cross but that same spirit in you is fulfilling the word for your day manifesting the word for your day it manifests the word through that body and his day and that made him one with the father it's manifesting the word for this day that makes you one with the father he that was the alpha expression of Jesus Christ in that body this is is the Omega expression in this body these are the people who are going in the Rapture these are the people brother Ram said this I think in the building today of the spiritual house that God worships in I think that's been a great big failure today among the Bel the builders we try to build it out of man-made material education seminaries scholarship we try to build upon education denominations all these things will not work as long as we have not accepted that Odd Stone that peculiar Stone as the building begin to materialize they realize that the hole that was left the Odd Stone fit it to the dot that's where the spiritual Builders today that's why the bride building of Christ is not ready for the bridegroom the bride building of Christ his place of rest the place were not made with hands the bride building he's putting this together but the builders are taking the word and building a wall God sent a prophet we believe what he said God sent a prophet we believe what he said God sent a prophet and fall into the ditch because they didn't keep turning corners and brother and sister this is you personally turning Corners in your life because every time God comes and reveals something to you recognize hey there's a new brick there's a new corner I got to walk more here I got to walk more here because he's not doing this as a group anymore he's doing this as an individual in your life and you can see more Christ and more Christ and you just keep turning corners and you're coming closer and closer and those corners getting quicker and quicker and you're getting dead and dead and all of a sudden you're going to realize hey I'm not even on the earth anymore I've taken off out of here why cuz you kept walking in the light as it was shown to you he said well my family doesn't see it okay so you love your family more than God there's an idol well people in my church think I'm I've gone off The Rocker they think I'm wrong okay there's your idol are you willing to stand by yourself on what God told you personally it's it's an individual individual that's why the bride building of Christ is not ready for the bridegroom is because the builders has rejected the Chief Cornerstone listen to this that was laid on the DAT of pentec day of Pentecost which is the baptism of the holy spirit it's the new birth friends that's what they're rejecting because you got to change and you can't do it yourself you can't change on your own all you can do is hear the word of God let that thing listen for the voice of God and he speaks to you he drops it in there this is for you and believe that and if you would just believe that why watch him start changing your life in ways that blows your little mind it will but what we try to do is well I want to be born again so I'm going go try to be born again go go offer your sheep and goats on the sacrifice that's all you're doing well I'm gonna go to a a meeting I'm gonna go to youth camp I'm going to do this that's wonderful I love I wish we all could be in that meeting in Virginia this morning but you can you can go to a thousand meetings and it's just you might as well go to Mecca with the Muslims I know that's pretty rough isn't it but if you go with the wrong approach you are wasting your time and you're hurting your faith that you do have well I try to I tried went to the altar didn't get it went to the altar I didn't get it went to the altar didn't get it that's not Faith you don't run around with a hope so you listen for the voice of God to speak to you and he tell you I am talking to you you and then you have something to stand on then when you go to prayer you say God I know you talk to me and I'm just going to wait here until you tell me what to do next and he will just keep your hands off of his salvation well I'm going try to do this now God I'm gonna try to do this I'm gonna try to do this how about confessing God I want to love you I want to love you the way you love me but I can't I don't have the capability of loving you the way I want to but there's a desire in my heart to love you that way and I know if there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond hallelujah oh that thirst in your life there can't be a thirst if there's not something to to to satisfy that and if you have a desire for God that's not being satisfied recognize there is a satisfying portion somewhere for you that deep is calling the heart of God is calling to hear and it's got to match they match it's the same Des desire his desire for you matches your desire for him and those two have got to come together or else his word is alive he said it's been odd people act funny they don't come into the order of our psychology our education our learning our Creeds that don't fit in there and they kicked it out because it was too odd too peculiar too disagreeable with the plans that we as men and ideas of what the church had the church should be it doesn't line up with our religion it doesn't line up because we got the prophet we got the message y we're living a holy life we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost falling on our on our services and we just all ready to go it don't work that way it doesn't friends there's got to be a manifestation of the word for this hour in your life and you say what are you talking about you keep saying the word for this age what is that about I don't know for you I know what it is for me you want to know what it is for you go to the one who can tell you no one can tell you what you're supposed to be doing what your purpose is except for God you got to know for yourself it's an individual thing it's not we all got together and had a great big service that's not what God's looking for he's looking for a heart a place of rest that's all he's ever wanted he said what I had with Adam and Eve before the fall I so long for that I've got to have it back you know what he's saying now I got it it's back the only thing he's waiting for is these old bodies to be changed if you stumble over the body it's easy to people you know all kinds of Christians they recognize yeah that was Jesus Christ the son of God back there people don't don't stumble with that body anymore but he's the same today if he's oh God if he's the same today they got to stumble over a body today they've got to reject a body today they've got to crucify the body today theyve got to crucify the word made flesh today and I'm not talking about the denominations they have clueless they don't know what's going on at all brother and sister let's go ahead and bring it home this is message believers who are crucifying Christ aesh but not allowing that word to manifest the word for this age that is supposed to be happening but they're just good message Believers listen to tapes all day long but twist a little word here and twist a little word there and do a little bit different here and do a little bit different there to follow what they want the religion they want they hate the light oh I don't hate anything you hate the light if you refuse to walk in it it's because you hate it because it exposes the deadness of your religion you always resist you stiff neck and heart and ears always resisting the Holy Ghost I'm not talking to you you're not doing that are you that's good question yes sir God's asking you he's he's talking to each individual he's not just oh this is for everyone in the church I'll just sit in and hide in my Pew and just let it go over my head you'll answer for that that's right that's right this is real God don't play do you realize what he did I am done let me just get done here do you realize what he did for you anything it took he'll destroy Kingdom he would turn the waves of river he would did all that he did because he don't play church he allowed all those horrible things to happen to the martyrs down Through the Ages look what he did with Israel and the Holocaust the Jews he allowed that why because he had to get them back to the Homeland so he let those people be horribly tortured murdered all this things so they could have a Homeland because it had to come to pass to bring forth his word if he's going to allow that that to them to get their attention what's he going to do to you how's he going to treat you if he needs your your fellowship he will chew you up and do whatever he has to because I am G to get all mine all the father had given me are mine I got them written here right on my hand and they're not I'm not going to lose a single one of these That's how much he cares and then we want to just offer some religion we're playing church too much right playing Church you want to know if you're playing Church sometime complain about what's going on in church complain about it well I don't like the way the song service goes well I think brother Phil preaches too long I don't like the way brother Thomas screams and shouts well I think I should do this right you're playing church because all you're offering to God all you're offering to God is some religious idea that you thought you was going to have to run the church that's right there are people in offices to do these things they're elected and God anoints them for that job if you have a problem with something go talk to them in the right Spirit but if you want to sit at the dinner table and trash somebody or Fellowship around sister Becky I wish someone knows to play piano I get to pick on her she's my sister you understand what I'm saying we play church so much we want it to be just the way we want it it's too hot in this church it's too cold the church I go in Dixon it's freezing I had to wear a jacket in the summertime I hate it you know what who cares how many of my brothers sat in caves to go to church my goodness we're soft So Soft well I think that you got my point let me keep going flirting with old boyfriends what do we want to do let me finish with this this quote this scripture Jesus said Matthew 21 Jesus saith unto them did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same as become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing is marvelous in our eyes therefore say I unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof and whosoever shall fall on the stone shall be broken but on whosoever it shall fall it will grind to powder you have two choices you're either going to fall on the stone in Repentance or it's going to fall on you and grind you to powder and destroy you you have two choices there's the only two choices you have how do you fall on that stone repent repentance is how you fall on that stone and be broken and be honest with God be honest with God God I still love this thing of the world I still this is sin and yet it has such an enticement it's something that I still can't give up it's still something that I want that I want I want my own nature is too strong I can't get get over it don't go in there say God I'm trying so hard I'm praying I'm reading why are you not keeping your end of the bargain you're supposed to set me free from this oh quit you calling him a liar you find him fault in the way he's handling you he's looking for true repentance that only comes to honesty I love this thing I don't want to give it up but I need to because I know it's separating my fellowship with you I need you to step up this is your promise to me I'm holding you to this promise I know you're going to do it I need to love you more than I do I said that was the last scripture I lied to you I'm sorry Romans 9:30 what shall we say then that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of Faith but Israel which followed after the law of righteousness has not attained to the law of righteousness so here is Israel with the law and God is saying you know they're good they're walking in the light but it was time to turn the corner and they refused to turn the corner but the Gentiles he came to the Gentiles said now I'm going to offer you Grace they said I'll take it it's just by faith I'll take it but they so loved their religion the Jews did they could not turn and follow after Grace after faith and so the Gentiles got it and the Jews have gone off when we see the last 2,000 years here's what's become of them but they're back they're back wherefore why did they not attain to it because they sought it not by faith but that were the works of as it were the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling Stone behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed all God is asking for is belief when I speak to you recognize my voice and believe it and if you believe it you'll do it you see see God still wants a sacrifice tell you what we are going to quit go ahead and stand I got one more scripture if you stand I'll have to quit soon you've been a great group this morning very I appreciate it God does have a sacrifice he wants from us he absolutely does so in 1 Peter 2 and4 it says to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious so we're coming to this living Stone ye also as Lively stones that means you're a living Stone you're not just a dead Church sitter are built up a spiritual house a house built without hands God has built you up a house not a wall a holy priesthood you're a holy priesthood God does not accept sacrifices from a sinning hands it's got to be a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices accepted to God by Jesus Christ what is your spiritual sacrifice your heart you say well how do I offer my heart you offering the sacrifice of praise no matter what you're going through no matter what's happening no matter how painful things are no matter how you're grieving no matter how much loss no matter how things are falling apart your whole life is just shambling and yet the only thing coming out of your mouth is praise to the faultless God who did all he has for you already that's all's looking for can you give me that sacrifice of praise Phil I'm tired I don't feel like it I don't want to go to church go ahead and offer that sacrifice at praise because all the rest of your sacrifices mean nothing if you don't start with that it doesn't he's looking for a spiritual sacrifice that that sacrif sacrifice giving something you don't want to give so I don't feel like worshiping I don't feel like going to church I don't feel like confessing the truth I don't feel like repenting I don't feel like claiming that I'm Overcomer when I keep stumbling but the word says I am so I'm going to go ahead and just worship him anyways amen amen praise the Lord [Music] isn't he wonderful wonderful wonderful is in Jesus my Lord wonderful have seen ears have heard what's recorded in God's word isn't Jesus my Lord wonderful is a king wonderful [Music] wonderful [Music] wonderful eyes

just going to break I'm going to try and but what is it mean to be like Jesus it means that we are fulfilling the word for our day that just the same as he fulfilled the word in his day and when you fulfill the word in your day like for him you are going to be a stumbling Stone you're going to be a stumbling Stone to the people you work with to your own family they're going to look at you say why do you have to be so different why do you have to be so odd why do you have to believe these crazy things you believe you're going to be rejected you're going to be persecuted you're going to be vilified are you sure you want to be like him but this is one more scripture one more verse that he wants to tell you if you're willing to bear that reproach if you're willing to be that stumbling [Music] Stone he said but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness into his Marvelous Light that word marvelous there means passing human comprehension causing amazement joined with Terror striking and surprising and wonderful admirable and excellent you don't make sense to
