amen we just have a new message tonight amen so I call it a new one if I don't they don't think that I preached it before amen that's hard to do amen God praise the Lord amen all right God bless you let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you Lord and we want to thank you Lord for this opportunity Lord of being able to assemble ourselves together again Lord to open up your pure perfect unadulterated word Lord Lord Jesus to feed father on the body word of the son of man Lord and let us become it father by eating it and we thank you Lord Jesus father for all of the help that you have given each one and the strength and Lord for the joy that you said in each heart the peace that you've given for washing our sins all away and father we just ask God that you would just be in every part of the service now thank you Lord for the worship service and we ask God that you just helped me to get us Lord out of the way that you might use my heart my lips and my mouth if I were to speak to words that you once spoken father for we know that Lord Jesus if your word will go forth it'll accomplish its purpose for we ask these blessings in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen turn to the Book of Joshua if you will the first chapter of Joshua foreign amen Joshua 1. and we'll probably go ahead and read Ephesians and Hebrews also that's my three scriptures tonight usually I have so many I can't get through them but tonight I only got three amen Joshua 1 and um one through seven and now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is death not therefore arise go over this Jordan down and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread that have I given you unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and and this Lebanon even into the Great River the Great River river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea Towers the going down of the sun shall be your Coast and there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be thou of good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong very courageous that thou mayest observed to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded teacher not from it from the right at right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper with us whoever thou goest amen may God has blessings to reading of the word let's go over to the book of uh Ephesians Ephesians in chapter six and verse let's start with uh verse 10. finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual places spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having gone all to stand having done all to stand stand therefore having your line scared about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God may God that is blessings to the reading a word let's read the next one Hebrews 13. I'm going to say that after each scripture so there so be sure to be blessed amen amen Hebrews 13 and verse 5. let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee amen may God add His blessings to the reading word you can be seated amen amen I will read the next verse I didn't have a line to do so but I just happened to catch catch it with my eye if you'll notice that he says nor forsake thee so that we can boldly May boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me amen amen the reason that I read that in uh Hebrews uh the point was I will never leave thee nor forsake he was is found in Joshua the fifth verse where he says I was as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee amen trying to make sure we understand that the promises back there are amen that applies to us also that God is speaking to us even as he did Joshua brother Ben I believe it was in Ephesians parallels Joshua amen he talks about how that Joshua parallels Ephesians and so forth amen and it's amazing how that especially all of these actually all of these scriptures especially here in the first part amen how that it applies to us in such a great way especially in places like forever The Souls of your feet shall tread that have I given to you as I said to Moses we know that Footprints means possession amen amen in the whole Bible amen the land that he was talking about is all of the word of God isn't that right that's the promised land amen so as much as this as you can possibly accept and receive it's yours amen amen now I want to take my I want to take a title amen and and I want to call it in line of duty in line of duty amen praise the Lord because you'll notice here and I Tuesday chose that as I begin to think about it because the one scripture actually the thing that kind of uh caught my my attention didn't be directed in the way that we wanted to go was what brother banham said about Israel he says and we're told one time in the scriptures when the children of Israel was following their commission going straight in the lion of Duty that the Red Sea got in the way of the line of duty of the children of God Amen going to a promised land and God looked down through the pillar of fire and the Sea got scared now if you looked at many different places Brother Band talks about a writer once said this amen so but apparently like the writer that wrote about God looking down upon the sea in that sea getting scared because brother Madam uses as many a lot of times and especially later in his years later from 60 years Sauvignon up perhaps uh I mean that's 67 but 57 on up amen he many times talked about news this whenever he talked about the line of duty he many times referred to this amen but my thought was this here now he said that she got scared and up and up the way and they crossed over as on dry ground amen praise the Lord so as we think about it brother and sisters we think about God's line of duty and what God told uh Joshua that would happen that nobody would be able to stand in your way as long as he was in the line of duty amen now I'm gonna go ahead and I want to read something I was going to wait on this but I'm going to go ahead uh now notice here brother bam says it this way he says Joshua after he crossed over into the land God gave him a promise now if you'll notice first of all the one thing that got one one thing that the only way that you'll actually ever be in in the perfect line of duty is if God commissions you to do something if God tells you to do something amen I believe when I was studying this mother bam says first of all whatever you do it's got to be according to his word and then it's got to be God telling you to do it amen it's got to be a commission that you follow up and when you follow that commission out just like he did with Moses long ago and we want to maybe maybe step back here in the middle we're talking about Moses we want to talk about David and different ones but let's finish the story of Joshua Joshua here and I'll notice he said he was given a promise now notice God gave him a promise that you know and part of that promise was that he was to meditate upon his law day and night and so forth that God would never leave him nor forsake Him Amen in every place if all of his foot would go amen he would conquer it amen now notice after he did after he did cross over we know what happened amen as he sends spies over amen into the promised land and it come across Jericho and how many knows that Jericho's walls were so big that they could run chariot races on top of it now I don't know about you but I don't know but you know that they've got to be at least wide enough I don't know just how wide it was but it had to be at least wide enough for two Chariot Swifts is the way I figure it because you can't run a race if you can't pass right so it's got to be at least two Chariot with you know maybe not much more I don't know but anyway they were ready to check you can imagine running traces up on top of that wall and and we all know the story of what happened and how that they went over there amen and brother bam says now notice he says that they fought an entire campaign without losing a man not one man lost not even getting a scratch no nurse no first aid no Band-Aid no you know the land he said the land is yours go fight think you're fighting in the com a complete campaign amen and nobody ever got hurt nothing ever happened bad as long where everybody was he perfectly in that line of duty now I know what's preachers and I've done it in the past that's how I preached and hey that's where you want to be you want to be in that place or a guest spot nobody ever gets you scratched nobody ever needs a Band-Aid unfortunately that's not how life is I hardly know of any scenario I can give you many and I will give you many scenarios of people who were at Mighty Vic if you want to talk Mighty victories because of people that were in the line of duty and also a lot of defeats that happened in the line of duty and the reason why hey man praise the Lord so there they were and brother Branham of course he'll use this as an illustration and so forth and he says and they slayed the ammonites the Hittites and there wasn't anybody heard among them until sin came into the camp amen how many knows that they did that and my they had such a victory and then of course we know what happened was one lie one person stepped out of line one person stepped out of mind and he said 36 men died we all know that I believe it was the Twisted the children of AI amen that they went up there I believe it was and they just sent a small number because they're just small wait no need of all I was going but all of those men that did said they come back blood hinge oh man think about it Dad that's 36 funerals because one man didn't do what he was supposed to do he come out from behind the line of duty and when we come out of the line of duty that's when trouble sets in isn't it that's when you get defeated I mean no matter how much it's God's people it's God's commission notice nobody will be able to stand before you isn't that what God told Joshua nobody's going to be able to stand before you but here he's defeated is that right so they came with hey he came with an attack law so to speak that you know if everybody stays in line the way they're supposed to do if you meditate the way it's supposed to do amen because unfortunately we're living in that we're living in an imperfect world we like the flipping Christianity are you going to be victorious you're going to be victorious every time and every time and all the time watch out you're still a human being you're bound to fail amen oh my but that's right so we look at that and so now notice now uh so he says if until sin came into Camp why they did hide these innocent man because one man stepped out of line you see this is why it needs to be taught the church lining up lining up with the word of God lining up with each other perfectly walking upright soberly before all men fearing God Amen as long as you're in that way this is what the prophet says as long as you know when a man is in line of duty for God there's no gate there's nothing that can stand in his way there's nothing I can stand nasty wow hello t-h-i-n-g my spelling is correct nothing is gonna stand in your way as long as you're in the light enough Duty no wealthy you come in front of you oh yeah things will come up against you you can't just expect an easy path with no obstacles obstacles are gonna come up amen how many knows the prophet talk we all know the Bible says on Adam and Eve amen there were four to five behind the word of God as long as he was in the place where she was being supposed to be as long as adamus was here he's supposed to be amen the tree would obam the three flowers oh the lion would obam every animal with no bam which one Eve step it brought fear and brought everything in the book They're the first ones that starts got out from the fortification of the word of God they got out of line hey man that was the first one way back there we see where they got out of line we think about oh my God but I want to talk about a little bit let's talk a first of all a few victories before we talk about some of these things here amen we bring it on down let's talk about Moses for a minute we know that God came down to Moses Amen on the uh on the mountain and he says you know amen I have remembered my promise to Israel and I have come down to deliver them isn't that right that was the promise after 400 years of them being in bondage God said I've come down and I'm going to deliver my people and he's gonna deliver them amen but there's some things that were in his way aren't you glad that it doesn't matter when God sets out to do something it don't matter what's in the way it's gonna get put to the side y'all it's going to overcome Pharaoh was the first one that was in his way amen and we know what happened to him isn't that right God actually overcome pharaoh don't ever think that God won't overcome it for every victory that I have I give God the the blessing I give him amen at the reward so to speak I give him the honor and for every defeat that I have I blame myself don't blame God no God don't the god ain't defeated but we get defeated so when you get defeated don't blame God amen so listen though listen to that amen oh what a great Victory Israel had isn't that right finally they overcome though it out oh we can see it read it again we're all rejoicing and shouting and all them and praising God and took all their luck it's the clanging of the pots and the pans and all the animals they were all heading out of Egypt a long string of two million people all rejoicing because guess what they're obstacle was out of the way now because they had a line of duty and that was that God was going to deliver to his people and take him over into the promised land now anything that was going to come in the way of them coming into the promised land had to get put out of the way amen praise the Lord and I noticing they were on their Road marching then coming out there was a pillar of a fire before them and they marched on to the Red Sea and when they got there right there in the line of duty laid an obstacle amen and the first thing you know fear struck them and they didn't know what to do I mean oh sometimes we as Christians and everything sometimes an obstacle come our way they're bound to come our way that's the way people does today when fear strikes them when they're right in the path of Duty listen brother let me say this if you're walking in the light having fellowship with God I hope that's where you're walking everybody walking like that everyone walking in the light a lot of y'all Darkly walk in the darkness if I'm looking for a hand to go up huh walking in the line having Fellowship everything's going good all them times clear everything gone good walking in the light having fellowship with almighty God amen with his people and the Holy Spirit is upon you and then sometimes you'll meet an obstacle right there in the path of Duty what do you do amen what do you do listen he says don't stop just keep pressing on God Will Make A Way Through It praise the Lord gotta make a way through it that's one of the greatest experiences of my life is to see God Amen and when I can't get over it under door honored or anyway God opens up a way and I go through it somehow or another his face is sufficient to carry us through that's why we read the scriptures when I know that God is my helper I will not cheer what man will do to me or trust you ain't gotta worry in the world as long as you're in the line of duty you've got every worry in the world every fear every problem amen if you're out of the line of duty amen praise the Lord amen really this is for believers amen this is for believers who are already lined up with God amen and for unbelievers well guess what unbelief is in your way so you can even say Lord help me get me in the line of duty and that is to believe your word and that Spirit of unbelief will have to get out of my life well I've been seeking even brother but I'm talking about the line of duty people why I've tried for 10 years to get the Holy Ghost well guess what just stay in line with the word keep believing God will bring you through aren't you glad for that God Will Make A Way sure nothing they could do but still Moes are there and also I've read many places where brother man preached on this and talking about having conferences with God whenever you get into this place to where I can't get over it can't get under it and then you know yourself doing what you're supposed to do amen and then things happen that you ought I read one book word but events it seems like you know without an understanding he says you know seems like the spiritual walk with God is amen it's a very hard hard walk because things happen to you you think they ought to happen he says but that's God's way of doing it amen all right praise the Lord oh my fear strike there now notice he says you'll meet don't stop just keep pressing on Amen because God Will Make A Way he's mixed away no matter what how big the obstacle is if you're Christian and you're in love with the Lord no matter how big it is because that Red Sea was big hello that was a big problem but God took care of it not didn't he because they were in the line of duty amen I mean I want to finish tonight with talk a little bit about your post of Duty amen I might as well have a positive duty but God places you and if you're at your post of Duty then you're in line the duty amen praise the Lord all right so let's look at this Joshua Joshua he of course you know he had a lot of obstacles he had to get that Obstacle of Aiken out of the way boy oh boy find a way to get rid of the problem huh stoned them and burned them with fire from what I understand get that unbelief out of there Lord help us get that unbelief out of there amen Joshua Moses amen are both of those now let's talk about Daniel for just a minute how about Daniel how many knows that uh Birdman talks about he's been actually mentioned seeds when he talks about but he said Daniel he was in the line of duty because even though he was in Babylon and so forth he had committed himself not to defiled himself with the things everybody else was and he had committed himself to praying what three times a day you know and there was some man that didn't like Daniel they wanted to trap him and of course they made a lot it says if anybody traced anybody up but their God for about a week I guess it was amen let him be thrown into the lion's den and that Governors foolishly signed his name to it can't be changed couldn't be changed and they should have caught him but what is it Daniel he didn't care amen he went in the line of duty God come on the scene because he was doing what God wanted him to do if you haven't experienced it I I have I know what it's like to have God put you somewhere it doesn't matter what man woman or whatever comes your way if you just stand there and committed to God watch God take you through [Music] but you got to be in the you got to know you got to have a revelation of your church you gotta have a revelation of your pastor you gotta have a revelation of where you're supposed to be amen because if you don't there's no way to have any confidence but what happened we know that God stop the mouth of the Lions now let me ask you this I thought about this what about those who can hide all this were they in the line of duty they weren't in line of duty when they throwed him in they got child on to eat him up why because they were not in the line of duty my Daniel another one I want to talk about for a minute let's talk about some examples of people who were in the line of duty and did great things step out of that line and had the suffering because how many knows that whenever sin there's one thing that if he comes in to your life it's an obstacle amen it's something that will not cause God to bless you anymore amen I don't care how much Holy Ghost you got how much Christian you are if you let sin come in you get out of the line of where you're supposed to be you're not in the place that you ought to be remember the Bible close if Israel never left their Homeland amen they would be cursed they got to stay in the Homeland that's what you and I gotta do stay in the Homeland David think about it he was back on the backside of the desert praying and having his uh Jubilee and praying and reading his Bible and having fellowship with God and everything was going great until a bear came and took his little sheep huh I don't know about you but it'd take a lot of man to attack a bear huh I don't know how big this bear was maybe we'll get to see it someday Lord play us to take amen of of David and how big this bear was I want to see where he stabbed him I want to see what he did amen would you like to see that amen David went out there he says I'm in the line well that's supposed to be you're taking you're not getting you get your grumpy pause up my property [Music] I believe that's what a lot of Christians ought to be saying if you ain't got the joy of the Lord and the devil's coming sold that from you now obstacle Scott and your way of your walk with the Lord and your pizza you said devil you get your grabby hands up you ain't got no right here I'm in a lot of Duty all right went out there and killed out there was that it oh God allowed a lion to come his way oh my can I just say what comes to this gray matter I wonder what guy would do that why would God all of a sudden just let a bear come and take David's little sheep why wouldn't God allow a lion to come and take a sheep huh that's good that's the correct answer because I'm ready for Goliath he was getting ready for bigger things let me tell you something you wonder why you have the little problems that you do oh this just irritates me well were you gonna have to do a whole lot better than that down the road all right God I wish there would no have to go through some of the things I've had to go through in my life I'd rather not do it Austin but now what can I say at the end of it all I can have a whole lot of compassion now for people that are going through stuff I can feel for people a whole lot more and all this petty little stuff that's just little bitty what are you talking about you give me a big trial if you're gonna give me one [Laughter] oh my you have a flat tire and you want to get upset you have a little bit this Saturday under a setback and this out of the other one come on folks you're gonna have to be a lot worse than that that's the way David felt he says what did he say what did David say I believe in he says look your servant was in the field and there was a lion and a bear I took care of them I took care of them who's this big old uncircumcised Philistine he's in the line of Israel's Duty he's standing in the way God help us anything that's standing in your way bring it down [Applause] he said I'll cut his head off that's what he referred to his experience amen but what was it Goliath was standing in the lion of Israel's Duty amen God magnify David because of it is that right mine that's right he was in a lot of Duty did great things they sang songs about David help swell Saul killed her thousands Dave about his ten thousands huh Saul heard this what he said thousand times to get a thousand that what day it saw was saw was a whimper folks he was a general James he was a jealous cry baby you know how many times he got mad and Sewer Spirit David because man he's better than I am and this added the other he had a complex whining about this out of the other he should have said that's all well he had to try to get rid of him he wanted to be the greatest anyway praise the Lord there he was and David look what he did after a while the song wasn't so pretty anymore because David stepped out of line is that right from the Lord with Bathsheba and whoa whoa whoa man his enemies did all kinds of things isn't that right Oh my he suffered greatly great terrible things happened to David man when I read that about all the things that happened to him it'd be enough to make somebody want to shoot their self he was terrible his name was dirt and when they thought about David they thought that dirt you know you know what I've heard said by message believer that David he was such a rasque he had a real terrible name for David and that's what he felt about David now David did some raunchy terrible things didn't he but for a message believer to still think that of David uh uh man I don't think so because how many know God forgive him God raised that man back up amen he held that man somebody that has that kind of an attitude I believe needs Deliverance by almighty God could help with their own attitude amen it stinks that's right because even though he did all that he was the man after God own heart he would repent at the drop of a hat the second that he was reproved the second amen he was found out he's God help me Forgive Me Lord amen amen he was an example great wonderful man but because he stepped out of line amen all these things happen many people died his own son isn't that right his favorite son died got hung on a tree and somebody killed him speared him through I'm thinking that he killed the man that killed him is that right he came and says I killed him you shouldn't have said that you killed my son he killed him if I'm not wrong that's right why because you don't touch you don't touch God's Prophet son amen let me tell you something I'll say this a lot of people and I I want to be careful here a lot of people disagree with what's going on in Jefferson perhaps Joseph is doing stuff but this man's mouth is very careful about what he says about any of God's children Apophis kids why because guess what I I haven't got nothing to do with it they'll answer to God for it if you're doing something wrong you know amen all right let's go on so David's how about Samson Samson wow he had a lot of obstacles came in his way isn't that right whenever an Ops they come coming his way it talks about I believe Brother band was talking about he said they had ropes man that horses couldn't pull the ropes apart horses couldn't wrote the pulse apart whenever he got a hold of him [Music] that's right just tore it like a thread every time he get in the pen she was in the line of duty it wasn't this The Celestine couldn't stop him and Donaldson couldn't have because he was getting this Supernatural I don't know about you or brother Tommy or any of the strongest of us after killing us a thousand Philistines we would probably be wore out we'd probably get the five other and say that's it somebody else take over but he killed a thousand and somehow he supernaturally had the power isn't that right that God come down and he imparted him because why because Samson was in the line of duty he was where he was supposed to be I'm going to say that tonight if you're sure you ought to be and that what we said when you were in a line of duty there's nothing that you can't overcome according to the prophet of God nothing because you can't stand in your way this is stand in your way look marvelous can't stand in your word depression can't stand in your way nothing will send you away if you are where you are if he was gone [Music] get back in line foreign amen come on I wonder if People's lit Sloth from The Skin in their way lay spiritual drogginess I just don't feel like going to church tonight you're sleepy you need some wake up juice that's right it ain't no Powerade or Gatorade it's called gospel Aid some aid from the gospel that's right you need some neology mixed with gospels and you're going to be fired up some more gospels amen let's go to church let's praise the Lord but the ball ain't gonna tell me man bye-bye you guys tell me to say hallelujah [Music] hey man why but my so Samson we see how he was and my anything that got in his way let me just say this Gaza he got trapped in Gaza one time and they closed the gates on him I think better Maps out there four or five tons he said that today four or five times he says I'm about to buy it before five tons one time it's about a car right two thousand pounds something like that two four six eight eight to ten thousand pounds that's just what he said I can show you the quote but he got a trap listen we got him now what did they have him by no means a dad it's Anthony come on up there and he grabbed the gates pulled him out of their socket did he walk 10 feet and drop him where'd he go up on the hill my goodness I don't know about you but I didn't drop them as soon as they could but the Bible that he cared about you but what stupid idiot gonna follow a man that Gary's about to the next bill so I I don't know he could go I'd say he's fine just let him go oh my that's the kind of strength that he had how about you don't you realize you got some dates against you the Bible says the gates of hell are against you tonight understanding in your land the Bible says that I believe her amen when they get a revelation from God the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against you gonna Prevail against you if you're walking in a line of duty just chilling is loud as he ages stuck in the Prevail against you we're not all gonna just go into the circle of life for The Circle of Death huh it's called The Circle of Death didn't but a man call it the cycle of death and Revival Revival and death that has happened to every other Church age every one of y'all to be sitting there just well it's another service well I heard it before this is so boring I didn't really want to come to church but I did because guess what some Deacon might call me if I didn't and I missed too many I preach they ain't here half the time anyway come on folks yeah yeah you know you'd have he'd be calling all the time that might sting a little bit but we need it you need it that's right because you ought to be that way you think you're going on the Rapture you got me wondering which everything else is first before to church before God before the word everything else no we can wait on church we can wait I gotta do what I gotta do where's your priorities damn yeah I don't know if I should say it but I will iron don't you ever listen when I talk about putting God first when I'd give you the word of God and anything you put before God's an idol that should be enough to make sure all of us hey I don't wanna know why those I went for a God first in my life we're not a bunch of ducks repel water the water just flown right off of them we're not dogs the water don't fall off of us we absorb it it comes on the inside of it and we become the word amen Lord help us this evening that's all right that's more than what I was going to say but he sells me to say it came to my mind so I take it as the inspiration of the Lord is that okay it might sting a little which one of your gifts your child a weapon that we already barely even feel it huh I'm scared to grab my grandchildren a weapon because if I know if I do Elena I know if I do your mom and dad might find a mark on their backside they might say Grandpa now you can't hit that hard they are girls after all the lady number one could probably count on one finger how many times I've hooked them if that many amen Donna does a great job praise the Lord [Laughter] [Applause] hahaha Hallelujah I got it good isn't it amen praise the Lord so look at that now where we were Samson that's right and then afterwards think about the shame isn't that right when Samson stepped out of line and let me tell you something any Christian any of you people coming to church here if you step by the line you remember you will only bring shame it only brings shame When anybody carnal anybody that's carnal and not truly filled with the Holy Ghost you'll bring shame upon this evening like the Tabernacle upon the cause amen the only way you'll not bring shame is to be filled with the Holy Ghost to be led by the spirit and then it'll cause you like I said Sunday the love of God will cause you to do the thing that's perfect the love of God will never do their own thing that's why we need more of the love of God because it won't do the wrong things it'll always do the right thing amen praise the Lord Hallelujah brother random let's go on the brother Brandon for a minute how many knows that he was in the line of duty Letterman he said he always prayed they always try to make sure he prays about going to here or going to there because he just don't want to go there presumptuously he didn't want to go there on his own and if the Lord tells him to go guess what he says then God's going to back me up because remember he went to Germany I believe it was that one time and he's witch doctors and witches and said they will blow your tent away and sure enough they got the chant and this that and the other here comes the storm and it was getting windy and it was starting to blow but he was in the line of duty went away why because he was in the line of duty comes about you and I before we do stuff make sure it's God's will and then whatever you come up to if there is an obstacle you can get through it you'll go through it God will help you right over comment amen my he was always whenever he was going across the field him in to pray for pray for somebody and that blue showed up isn't that right and he said first I am a servant of the Lord and I'm going to pray for one of his people one of his children now what he said that's what he said and that's what he amen the anointing hit him he said that he said now go back and lay down [Applause] think about it that big bull he was an obstacle I mean he was a mean looking obstacle I'll tell you right now it was a frosty fall Day by the time it was a frosty fall day he says he was digging his heels I believe that and that what do you call that Miss coming out of his nose perhaps in the wind and him looking at him he says I'm coming to get you he had every reason to be scared but he was in the line of duty and he told that bull where to go go back and lay down aren't you glad that we've had such an example that whenever uh Adam before he lost his commission before he stepped out of line he could say the same thing to animals he could tell him what the names were he could do whatever and you know I have a message like that a message hit me in a messenger that God used in such a way amen that you can believe that that's not just for him but that's for you too no matter how big the animal no matter how big the Beast that you're facing if you're in the line of duty you speak to it you know how many times I read about this in the line of duty where God told him he says now Moses now you know even God said didn't I commission yet didn't I tell you to go then why are you crying to me many times she says God would always tell you if you get to these places where these obstacles are and they don't whine and cry just speak the word have a conference with God speak the word and don't retreat don't give up go forward he said [Applause] there is no retreating God feed the word and go forward by your slots I'm Healed oh my because God said so speak the word and go forward tell the devil what the word is and go forward don't worry about it God will take care of it can't get over can't get under can't get around us God Will Make A Way Through It just as sure as the world remember remember he was so low in his yard not all about you but you've got more in a yard may not seem like a big Commission but he needed to get the yard mode I don't know about yours but mine grows and we got to cut it every week otherwise it's going to look like some of them houses that I go pie down but soon over to Russellville but John probably knows him they never mow their yard I mean their windows are almost covered up with little trees and stuff I'm like the covered honey is this boy honey I'm glad we weren't lazy are we living there but anyway he was he was there doing a thing praying for the sick in the meantime remember how he said he'd go mow a little bit and somebody could have a sick call come in there and and go and pray for him go back out there try to get this yard bro bumped up into a bunch of hornets here they go huh here they come another brand beginning man you know the brother Madam was the most apologetic man that I know of he wasn't all Hardy and this out of the other when the love of God come into his heart he says not Bull look I am sorry that I intruded on your territory God gave you an instinct that put me down if I'm on your ground that's God's given instinct is that right and I'm sorry I Disturbed you but I'm a servant of the Lord and I go back in that right Penny apologized to the harness I think I could find an apology I'm saying that I bump against you and disturbs you nice peaceful afternoon nap now you're all mad if you come on to me I'll die right that many Hornets coming honey they started circling around and he told them to go back where they were is that many times across the ball clear I don't know what language they heard it in but they heard it I don't know what funny noise they make to tell each other to get back in the hole but that's what they heard it was you you everybody go back right back you're the leader here we go God knows how to talk in unknown on tongues isn't that right unknown languages he gave them the language he can make the sound they need to hear but I love the Bull story I may be wrong but while bull would look this way and look that way to me it's like boarded that guy go es I'm not I'm not sure he kind of looked dumb puddled and he turned around right back there boys I don't know what it was but God put him back in his place aren't you glad that even line a dude he got omelet is just rejoicing for that thank you Jesus if I'm walking in the way that I'm supposed to walk in the line of duty it don't matter what comes along I don't have to cry about it I can say that's what the word says here we go amen we're going right straight on Eve Samson Moses even how many knows he even had a little problem getting in his way called a temper amen his temper kept getting the best of him and everything and he smoked that rock twice when he wasn't supposed to do that amen cause him to keep say out of the promised land they'll blame me so to speak oh my praise the Lord all right 15 after let's take a few minutes on Jesus shall we let's talk about Jesus now how many knows that when did Jesus come he had a commission I come to do the father's will I mean praise the Lord how many could say that I am here to do the father's will I'm here to do the father's will and as long as you're here to do the father's will every angel in heaven is backing you up all those chariots that Elijah saw on him they're all behind you just stay seated if you possibly can but all those chariots are behind you euphoria amen Dear Dad you make it good what did the prophet say one place he says gobble bankrupt Heaven before One Promise will drop to the ground he'll keep every promise that he has made boy that's and he owns a cow to cattle on a thousand hills I don't know how in the world you're going to bankrupt somebody to create more no it's never gonna get bankrupt amen Lord help us our help our faith isn't that right amen help our faith Jesus come amen he had some obstacles let me see what he had here he had obstacles the first of them was sin amen his objective was to come back into fellowship with his children isn't that right but sin was in the way guilt was in the way everybody was guilty oh my I'll tell you what you know what's depressing brother Glenn when you're guilty being guilty is depressing now why do you think these kids can run around on the wall scream shout and holler and clear my they're the happiest little guy in the world right why because you're innocent you're not guilty innocence it's a great thing [Music] amen how many believes in every Son of God my sins are gone I've been set free amen you asked me why I'm sad no you ask me more about that because my sins there were they weren't obstacle but they're not obstacle anymore because they got into passive Christ and in between you and your fellowship with God is not in the past and that death was gotten the past Helen the grave was in the past himself went down there even the hill to devil I know you got your own key to your house to give him here now huh give me the keys to your house give me the key to Hell give me the keys to death took the keys and brought them up came to his church huh Paul looked at the Devil said oh death where's your sting oh grave where is your Victory but I think that God who gives us our secrets through Jesus Christ Our Lord and I am afraid to die okay put it he got rid of it he made sure he got real good and rhythm because he knew he had to pay the prize you had to die so he says I Gotta Die huh the devil didn't want him to die so he offered him all the kingdoms of the world all of y'all he offered all of y'all you can have them all if you'll just fall down about me but he said no I don't want him like that because if I hit him like that there'd be a bunch a muck a bunch of mire they're gonna shoot each other hate each other kill each other stab each other never get along huh that's right but no I'm gonna get him I'm gonna clean him up I'm gonna change your nature I'ma change their desires oh Hallelujah my life she was we was talking on the front porch today and then she said she's so glad for the Holy Ghost because if it wasn't for the baptism of the Holy Ghost those sacrifices that the Israelites made every year they still kept coming back every year with the same desire and I said yes that's right if it ain't for the Holy Ghost we'd be just like Israel was your appetite and it's the same thing as they had we're no better off that's the truth God came to changes amen all right we're trying to get used to this little thing Micah said the other one I'm always doing different things so I'll try to keep it on there amen I figured out I don't need this I can heal myself think perfectly well without the little thing in my ear but now if I'm back there or something like that it helps you love the Lord that's right sin was in the way death the hell the grave was in his way guilt was in the way praise the Lord my but he conquered it all to the Jew could have a relationship and fellowship with him amen in closing let's talk about the post of Duty for just a minute I know that I've looked this up and brother Brandon many times he would preach at a lot of different places he'd have services and things like that you know and churches would get together and sponsor it and cancel their service but if the church would have its own church so many times he said now we might we're going to have a little bible study here tomorrow but you be at your post of Duty that's where you're supposed to be amen I thought you know we all have a post God how many knows God saved you God placed you in Christ God places you in a church amen and I thought you know it's kind of like brother bam said about a football team talk about support your pastor support your church amen because that is your place of Duty amen I thought well you know when you break that when you do something different than that you think God's Gonna bless that I don't think so amen well we have a post of Duty and I thought of it like a quarterback or whatever and the preacher's the quarterback I thought you know not just saying this about me but any church should be 100 behind their pastors didn't they right that's your positive Duty because you're what you're backing him up you know how hard it is to preach to people that don't want to hear you don't like you not not for you you I can do it don't say it's easy but I can do it because I know where I stand but God's called me to do amen but I'll tell you what it makes it so much easier and God is so much happier when everybody's to get it like a football team I mean those on their football team they get the biggest meanest ugliest dick on fridges and everything else number 72s and you know they get the biggest guys on them they're called lineman how many knows that line is so important because if you don't have that line of defense what's going to happen to the quarterback he gonna get shot that's right and I believe that's the way it is in church amen when you've got the amen card or you got people supporting saying they're not trying that quarterback ain't never going to get sacked devil ain't gonna get his bed I don't care if there's somebody sitting in the back seat there man crying every chair they're picking up every kind of a bad attitude bad Spirit how well do you think the brother Banner was saying I take every Spirit under here eat it under my control for the glory of God because sometimes Services man you just feel the resistance you just feel feel that amen it all has to be brought under the control of the Holy Ghost and when he has Liberty if the quarterback has plenty of time there's a lot I'll tell you what it is wide receiver runs deep because you gotta have plenty of time for a deep man to go otherwise you're flinging it up in the air you're gonna Hail Mary we don't want no Hail Marys we want something that's sure right well let's have run this course before let's have done this practice before let it work according to the practice amen I forget his name now but the guy that just I guess retired and he had five footballs whatever you know and he just divorced his wife Dwight finally divorced him and I heard some stories about him I've got it football was before his wife or family or anything I mean he put it all in the football amen no wonder he went five times right but anyway the wide receiver back to the wide receiver he goes out he goes deep and guess what those linemen you just can't get through them face be to God I like when the devil just can't break down the Holy Ghost meeting just can't get you depressed just makes it better and better all the time he goes back picks that ball up and fires it boy oh boy brother Joe I don't know but it was probably 10 years ago since I saw it but the Titans we were all rooting for the Titans amen and they did a run they did the last run and the only Almighty was last last minute last second last fight and then he goes and he finally talking to him at the one yard line if you got any idea how discouraging that is when you're wanting to make it cost that you're a backyard ah no wonder people punch that screen and everything else they get all in it came in the same way with Moses how many knows that when Moses lifted up his hand there was Victory it was that Victory whenever Moses said they would say hey we can't let it go hang on didn't they hold his arms up he was like he could be lazy hey you got a chair for me here or something he never sat down he had to stand today held his hands up until I even gotta do nothing they're holding up and let me tell you something there was plenty Israelites is that right there's plenty Israelites for no good fighting with this I'm gonna get the fight so they could replace them guys many times over amen but they were support how many beliefs of support we support one another we're a team people let's stay that way and our post the duty of God placed you somewhere and He blesses you in there don't you let the devil get in between that place that you God has placed you in there he'll sure try folks he'll don't think there won't be obstacles he will praise the Lord and I I'm telling you I'm here to testify on my own my own testimony for the last 30 years you know I've had a revelation that this is where God wants me amen until you don't want me a guy called me somewhere else or do something this is where I'm gonna be and I don't believe there's enough Devils out of hell to ever stop that amen amen I like what brother Russell told me on Monday morning when they were there to help them a little bit and he he mentioned something and he says and I believe he was talking about Stonewall Jackson or something somebody said he says how can you just stand like that he says well my religion he says the reason I don't get Disturbed when I'm out there he said because I'm a safe here as I would be in my bed my T My Religion teaches me I'm a safe and not on the battlefield as I am in my bed because he has my point in my day he has appointed my time and so I ain't got to worry about it until my time comes ain't nothing cool for me I thought that was so good you don't have to fear I mean those you aren't gonna go until God brings you home until it's God's time You Don't Have To Fear I thought about one more think about Joshua how many knows that one time there was an obstacle God in Joshua's way and it was time itself time got in its way he says I don't have enough time need more time can you imagine somebody calling for more time because Cayenne got in the way of his victory because he was in the line of duty defeating the enemy like he was a he says man if that sun goes down they're gonna go overnight they're going to reinforce search theirself and we're gonna lose so many more men and I'll tell you what I want to ask Joshua one of these days what got over to you brother what come down why did you say that what made you say that huh no doubt but it'll be probably something like this I don't know something just came over me and I just said thought said still mood you stand the valley of agalon or whatever it was did you stay there too I need more time and God heard from heaven and stopped the whole thing and said hey he's in the line of duty I'm gonna make sure this happens I mean God is there to make sure that it happens for you if you're in the line of duty amen praise the Lord we will roll this gospel Chariot along we will roll the gospel Chariot along we will roll the gospel Chariot along with the our brothers in the way we will stop and pick him up come on musicians he found it hey you found my song all right let's sing a song shall we stand with me how many has Faith to believe that during the line of duty doesn't matter tomorrow what comes your way amen speak the word and go forward I'm inspired to be in the lion of God's duty tonight amen praise the Lord now make sure you go to the next line honey amen because I hope well I'll come up with some if you can if we don't have them back all right let's sing it we will roll the gospel chariot [Music] along behind uh if our brothers in the way we will stop and pick him up if our brothers in the way we won't stop and pick him up give our brothers in the way we will stop and pick him up we will rock if our sisters in the way we will stop and pick her up if our sisters in the way we will stop and pick him up if our scissors in the way we will stop and pick him up and we won't take a long behind well if the devil give no way we will yeah [Applause] we will roll right over him if the devil's in the way we will roll right over him and father [Music] fathers in the way we will stop and pick him up if our fathers in the way we will stop and pick him up if our fathers in the way we will stop and pick him up and we won't tackle along Glory praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hand thank you Lord Jesus praise the Lord amen amen just a minute I feel just feel a little something here let's just close our eyes
