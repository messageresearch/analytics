[46:46] him amen and so it was hard to find him
[46:49] and we didn't find him until his insides

[48:36] well on a little more serious note if
[48:39] you would stand with me this morning we
[48:40] want to remember uh Viola I believe it
[48:44] is Viola and that would be Martha's mom
[48:48] brother Troy's grandma amen and I think
[48:50] that's the last of the grandparents
[48:52] isn't
[48:53] it so she was the last of the
[48:55] grandparents to go so
[48:57] she died in her sleep a few days ago I
[48:59] think it was about the same time that
[49:01] sister uh Vicky tidwell's mom passed
[49:03] away so we'll remember her at the same
[49:05] time everybody remembers sister Vicky
[49:07] tidwell's mom amen and so but we just
[49:11] want to have a moment of silence for
[49:12] those two people if you would amen this
[49:14] morning and remember them let's bow our
[49:17] heads
[49:31] Lord Jesus we just come before you this
[49:34] morning Lord and while we believe and
[49:37] know that both of these mothers were
[49:39] Godly women and we truly believe that
[49:42] they're on the other side in that
[49:44] dimension in a better place but yet
[49:46] those families Lord Jesus they still
[49:48] have to deal with not having them around
[49:51] anymore and we just pray father both for
[49:54] the Miller family and for the well
[49:57] family just now God that you would bring
[49:58] Comfort to their hearts Lord Jesus even
[50:01] though they're separated and have to go
[50:03] through this Lord I believe as Paul said
[50:06] that we through comfort of the
[50:08] scriptures don't have to grieve as those
[50:10] who have no hope Lord for we do believe
[50:13] that we will see him once again Lord and
[50:16] father we thank you for this hope that
[50:17] you give us by dying on the cross on
[50:20] Calvary and for raising from the dead
[50:23] once again and showing us that there is
[50:26] life after death there will be a
[50:28] resurrection there will be a heaven to
[50:30] go to Lord Jesus there will be eternal
[50:33] life Lord Jesus where we'll never grow
[50:35] old and we where these uh mothers which
[50:39] were way up in their eight years father
[50:42] no doubt but they're 20 years old again
[50:45] father they've turned back young Lord
[50:46] and we believe that's what we'll do one
[50:48] of these days each and every one of us
[50:51] father and Lord that's what we come
[50:53] together for us for the hope of the
[50:55] Resurrection the hope of the Rapture The
[50:57] Hope father if we have not of this world

[53:23] want to say God bless you to all of our
[53:25] young people here this morning morning
[53:26] amen amen good to see everybody so
[53:30] praise the
[53:33] Lord all right so I think we've got it I
[53:37] know last Sunday I hated that we didn't
[53:39] get that message last Sunday uh because
[53:42] we had one little technical problem I
[53:44] think it was and so uh we didn't get to
[53:48] have any sound on it is that right so
[53:50] anybody was streaming I don't think you
[53:52] could hear it but um anyway so amen I
[53:56] certainly you know I pray the Lord will
[53:58] help us to maybe get somehow right now
[54:00] we're doing the best we can on streaming
[54:02] so hey you know if you don't get to see
[54:04] it very well or whatever I think you
[54:06] just get what you can out of it right
[54:09] and so as long as we're getting fed and
[54:11] we getting it I think that'll have to do
[54:12] until they get perhaps a better faster
[54:15] service through here in this area they
[54:18] just don't have anything here right now
[54:19] so amen and so you just we just commit
[54:23] that to the
[54:24] Lord amen if you will open your Bibles
[54:26] this morning we'll go to the Book of
[54:34] Matthew
[54:36] amen Book of Matthew
[54:59] Matthew
[55:07] 14 and we'll begin with verse 22 and
[55:10] read down to 31 and straightway Jesus
[55:14] constrained his disciples to get into a
[55:15] ship and to go before him unto the other
[55:18] side and while he sent the multitudes
[55:21] away and when he had sent the multitudes
[55:23] away he went up into a mountain apart to
[55:26] pray and when the evening was come he
[55:29] was there alone but the ship was now in
[55:31] the midst of the sea tossed with waves
[55:34] for the wind was
[55:36] contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the
[55:39] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[55:43] the sea and when the disciples saw him
[55:45] walking on the sea they were troubled
[55:47] saying it is a spirit and they cried out
[55:50] for fear but straightway Jesus spake
[55:53] unto them saying be of good cheer it is
[55:56] eye Not Afraid and Peter answered him
[56:00] and said Lord if that if it be thou bit
[56:03] me come unto thee on the water and he
[56:06] said come and when Peter was come down
[56:09] out of the ship he walked on the water
[56:11] to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind
[56:14] boisterous he was afraid and began and
[56:18] beginning to sink he cried saying Lord
[56:20] save me and immediately Jesus stretched
[56:23] out forth his hand and caught him and
[56:26] said unto him oh thou of little faith
[56:30] wherefore this thou doubt amen and when
[56:34] they were come into the ship ceased amen
[56:37] praise the Lord may God bless add His
[56:40] blessings to the reading of the words
[56:41] you can be seated this
[56:44] morning I think this will probably last
[56:46] I don't know if Donna if you changed the
[56:48] batteries in it or not but I think we
[56:50] might be all right amen praise the
[56:54] Lord so there's a little thought that
[56:56] came to me here this week amen and just
[56:58] something that
[57:00] um
[57:02] um I've wanted to perhaps share with you
[57:05] and I've spoken on this subject several
[57:07] different times but I trust that it'll
[57:10] be a blessing and perhaps we'll be able
[57:13] to look at it in just a little bit
[57:16] different direction or a different
[57:18] way so we find
[57:21] here uh
[57:23] that Jesus of course you know
[57:26] uh came upon the waters and they thought
[57:29] it was a spirit and it says that they
[57:31] were they cried out for fear they were
[57:33] scared right they were scared and that's
[57:36] where Jesus said be of good cheer it is
[57:39] I don't be afraid this morning with the
[57:43] help of the Lord I'm going to speak a
[57:44] little while on fear or faith
[57:49] fear or
[57:51] faith
[57:54] Amen brother he makes a statement when
[57:57] he was speaking on on this same subject
[58:01] talking about this same story he says
[58:04] you know there's two elements that
[58:07] control the entire human race in the
[58:11] world one of them is fear and the other
[58:15] one is Faith amen now now there he says
[58:21] it's either fear or faith that controls
[58:24] every nation
[58:26] every denomination and every
[58:31] individual amen you're either fear or
[58:34] faith that controls you again in
[58:36] expectation he makes a statement now
[58:39] there's only two elements in the world
[58:40] that controls the whole world tonight
[58:43] that's fear or faith amen makes a
[58:46] statement talking about all churches all
[58:48] individuals all of these is simply one
[58:52] or the other and this morning with the
[58:55] help of we want to talk about perhaps
[58:57] where fear comes from where fear takes
[59:00] you and then where faith comes from and
[59:03] what operates it and and where it takes
[59:06] you so now we've already been uh uh been
[59:11] taught by the prophet how that our our
[59:14] being here our existence here that we're
[59:16] a Triune being amen we're body we're
[59:20] spirit and we're soul is that right Body
[59:23] Spirit and soul amen and the most of you
[59:26] that's raised in this mes especially you
[59:28] we've had diagrams of it and things and
[59:30] so forth that the outer senses of course
[59:33] the body being see taste feel hear and
[59:35] smell the spirit being conscious reason
[59:38] imaginations memory and so forth and
[59:41] then down in the soul we realize there's
[59:43] only two factions in the soul you'll
[59:47] either do one thing or the other and the
[59:49] ultimately your see taste feel here and
[59:52] smell your conscious reing memory and
[59:54] all of those things all of your complete
[59:57] body your complete World basically that
[1:00:00] you live in is controlled by only two
[1:00:03] things that's down in your soul and
[1:00:05] there's only one or the other that you
[1:00:06] can control by and that's either Faith
[1:00:10] or
[1:00:11] doubt amen Faith or doubt you either
[1:00:15] believe or you'll not believe praise the
[1:00:19] Lord all
[1:00:21] right so there's only two factions only
[1:00:24] two ways that you can look at it one of
[1:00:26] them of course we realize that uh doubt
[1:00:30] now how many knows that doubt or what we
[1:00:32] might call unbelief amen now Jesus said
[1:00:36] that go into all the world and preach
[1:00:38] the gospel and you know he that
[1:00:40] believeth shall be saved but he that
[1:00:43] believeth not shall be damned so we see
[1:00:46] the results of unbelief or
[1:00:49] doubt now you and I are living in the
[1:00:52] world okay we're living in the world and
[1:00:55] most most everything around us amen the
[1:00:59] world is being governed by that unbelief
[1:01:03] or
[1:01:04] doubt that's the reason that people are
[1:01:07] in the condition that they're in and
[1:01:09] right now more than at any other time
[1:01:11] because of the virus people are playing
[1:01:14] on your
[1:01:17] fear is't that right we're being played
[1:01:20] on by our fear like never
[1:01:23] before cuz even some of our Supreme
[1:01:26] Court Justices are amazed at how much
[1:01:29] we're willing to give
[1:01:31] up how much uh uh we allow people to
[1:01:35] break the Constitution break laws make
[1:01:38] new laws make their own laws up and make
[1:01:40] you live by their laws not laws at all
[1:01:44] they're even
[1:01:45] amazed huh and so you see how that you
[1:01:49] know and we know we know that that it's
[1:01:50] a play to devil is in it all now it
[1:01:53] doesn't matter what government is we
[1:01:55] know that all government are controlled
[1:01:56] by the devil and so and as we look at it
[1:01:59] we look at the world we look at the
[1:02:01] condition that's out there amen and I'll
[1:02:03] tell this right now as we go into 20 and
[1:02:06] 21 amen and we go into this new year you
[1:02:09] know that fear and that doubt will only
[1:02:13] get worse and worse and
[1:02:15] worse amen so we see that we're are
[1:02:18] Liberties and different things that
[1:02:19] people and the devil wants to take that
[1:02:21] from us isn't that right and so if
[1:02:23] you're thinking brothers and sisters if
[1:02:25] you're thinking that it's going to turn
[1:02:28] around that it's going to get better
[1:02:31] amen and I thought well I got got some
[1:02:33] good news for you this morning it's not
[1:02:36] going to get better it's going to get
[1:02:43] worse how in the world is that good
[1:02:47] news
[1:02:48] huh
[1:02:51] huh come on be of good cheer now don't
[1:02:55] fear
[1:02:56] why because we know that the scripture
[1:02:58] says the scripture says that the
[1:03:01] Antichrist system amen it is going to
[1:03:04] get so bad that no man can even buy or
[1:03:08] sell you talk about your right say you
[1:03:10] can't go to the grocery store and by
[1:03:12] groceries you can't sell unless you
[1:03:16] receive that
[1:03:17] Mark so there's a squeeze coming isn't
[1:03:21] that right but the Bible says that we're
[1:03:23] not going to be shut up we're going to
[1:03:25] be taken up so that's the good news it's
[1:03:27] finally coming to
[1:03:31] pass because we've got to get out of
[1:03:34] here so it has to get worse it has to
[1:03:36] have more doubt it has to have more
[1:03:39] fear but that's not what controls
[1:03:46] us the world I mean you think about the
[1:03:49] unbelief look at how people dress look
[1:03:51] how people look look they won't even
[1:03:52] wait there's more you know drugs and we
[1:03:55] have a a drug pandemic and everything
[1:03:58] else all kinds of things because it's
[1:04:00] all under doubt they've created a world
[1:04:03] under doubt and
[1:04:07] fear I want you to know that one thing
[1:04:10] that automatically comes with doubt is
[1:04:14] fear and
[1:04:17] scare huh because if you'll notice Peter
[1:04:20] here he was told look come come you want
[1:04:23] to walk on the water come on did Jesus
[1:04:25] said
[1:04:26] come now I don't know about you but if
[1:04:28] Jesus himself looks you in the face and
[1:04:30] say come
[1:04:32] on yeah that's what you probably want to
[1:04:35] do just come on
[1:04:38] down but even Jesus himself couldn't
[1:04:42] keep Peter from
[1:04:45] sinking you know because he wasn't well
[1:04:48] no matter how much I doubt no matter how
[1:04:50] much I look at my symptoms I'm getting
[1:04:52] no he begin to sink when he begin to
[1:04:55] look at the symptoms how many knows when
[1:04:58] you begin to let even a little bit of
[1:05:00] Doubt come into your life you are on the
[1:05:02] road to
[1:05:05] sinking amen but Jesus did reach out his
[1:05:09] hand and saved him amen come on don't
[1:05:13] look at your symptoms they're full of
[1:05:15] Doubt don't look at the surroundings
[1:05:17] don't look at the world it'll bring fear
[1:05:20] in your life it'll bring doubt in your
[1:05:22] life look at this world is going down
[1:05:27] amen this ship is going
[1:05:31] down the whole world it's going down
[1:05:34] it's
[1:05:35] doomed ain't that right but we don't
[1:05:43] fear every one of us is as good as
[1:05:50] dead
[1:05:52] amen I put that a little bit different
[1:05:55] than part brother brandham did Brother
[1:05:57] Bram said I'm looking I'm a dying man
[1:06:00] looking at dying
[1:06:02] people a that right it's just a matter
[1:06:04] of time that's
[1:06:06] right that's right our mothers just a
[1:06:10] matter of time they're gone our uncles
[1:06:12] and ants now we're the uncles we're the
[1:06:13] ants we're the ones going up there it's
[1:06:15] just a matter of
[1:06:18] time isn't it
[1:06:20] something God put us on a sinking ship
[1:06:28] sure he did he allowed us to get on this
[1:06:30] sinking
[1:06:33] ship I don't hear no praises the
[1:06:37] Lord
[1:06:39] huh but you know as well as I do before
[1:06:42] even telling you he give us a
[1:06:45] Lifeline how many knows he didn't just
[1:06:48] put us on a sing ship without having
[1:06:50] some lifeboats on the boat how many
[1:06:53] believe there's a Lifeboat
[1:06:56] and you can come God has given I want
[1:06:58] you to know when you climb up into the
[1:06:59] fears of faith and I'll show you toward
[1:07:01] the end of the service that you don't
[1:07:04] even have to fear death I'm going to
[1:07:06] give you illustrations and examples of
[1:07:09] people's footprints that we can follow
[1:07:11] how many knows we want to follow
[1:07:13] people's Footprints people who've had
[1:07:15] faith and walked by
[1:07:18] faith
[1:07:20] amen I believe it's
[1:07:22] Romans the first chapter in verse 7 says
[1:07:26] for therein is the righteousness of God
[1:07:28] revealed from Faith to Faith and is as
[1:07:31] it is written the just shall live by
[1:07:37] doubt no the just shall live by
[1:07:42] faith praise be to God our Prophet
[1:07:45] taught us that there is absolutely no
[1:07:48] value
[1:07:50] whatsoever in doubt and fear right
[1:07:57] the first person that ever be to have a
[1:07:59] little doubt what happened it was Eve
[1:08:03] she doubted God's
[1:08:05] word well God didn't really mean what he
[1:08:08] said that's what the devil told her nah
[1:08:11] Down You're Not Really Gonna Die God
[1:08:13] didn't mean what he
[1:08:15] said oh
[1:08:17] my listen this atmosphere in this world
[1:08:21] and doubt and fear it goes all the way
[1:08:24] into
[1:08:26] churchianity churches the deceiving part
[1:08:29] is those who have just so much but they
[1:08:31] still reject the truth amen now I want
[1:08:35] to tell you something that your faith
[1:08:37] you cannot rest in anything else outside
[1:08:40] of the word of God this is where your
[1:08:42] faith
[1:08:43] rests I don't know how many heard
[1:08:45] Wednesday night we were talking about
[1:08:47] the arm of
[1:08:50] Faith amen the arm of Faith every last
[1:08:53] one of these promises even even Jesus
[1:08:55] said nothing shall be impossible for you
[1:08:58] if you have faith as the grain of a
[1:09:00] mustard seat you could say to this
[1:09:02] mountain be plucked up and moved into
[1:09:04] the ocean if you had that kind of faith
[1:09:06] it can happen Joshua had Faith he
[1:09:09] stopped the universe all these things is
[1:09:11] that right and whatsoever you ask in
[1:09:14] anything in M I will do
[1:09:17] it but there's a condition you remember
[1:09:21] the woman that touched the ham of His
[1:09:22] Garment remember the woman that he
[1:09:24] called a dog he says according to your
[1:09:27] faith be it unto you it just takes a
[1:09:31] strong arm it just depends on how weak
[1:09:34] or how strong the arm of faith is to
[1:09:37] grab that sword and cut those promises
[1:09:39] out of the Bible you'll never get saved
[1:09:43] unless you believe that he died for you
[1:09:45] and that that it was for
[1:09:47] you you can come to the alt and repent
[1:09:50] for two weeks and unless you accept what
[1:09:52] he did you have to accept what he
[1:09:58] did amen it has to be a strong arm of
[1:10:02] Faith to cut your salvation out
[1:10:06] amen praise the Lord so many wonderful
[1:10:11] promises well I've got need of this and
[1:10:13] I got I'd like to have a job and I'd
[1:10:16] like to have a mate and I'd like to have
[1:10:18] a home and I'd like to have I'd like to
[1:10:20] be taken care
[1:10:21] of Jesus says you know if you'll seek
[1:10:23] the kingdom of God and my right
[1:10:25] rightousness food and
[1:10:27] reignment all these things shall be
[1:10:29] added unto you I like when he's taking
[1:10:32] care of me don't you he does a lot
[1:10:35] better job taking care of me than I can
[1:10:37] take care of
[1:10:39] myself amen so so
[1:10:42] many so to just those that are
[1:10:45] Christians are to live every day let me
[1:10:48] say this that that's what we want to do
[1:10:50] in 2021 we want to live by faith
[1:10:58] to live by
[1:11:01] faith now how many knows that faith has
[1:11:04] to be governed by
[1:11:05] something faith has a
[1:11:08] governor it's got a governor and it's
[1:11:11] found in
[1:11:14] Galatians in Galatians 5 and verse 6 it
[1:11:18] says for in Jesus Christ neither
[1:11:21] circumcision availeth anything
[1:11:26] nor
[1:11:27] uncircumcision but Faith which worketh
[1:11:31] by
[1:11:34] love
[1:11:36] amen so faith is governed Faith
[1:11:41] Works by
[1:11:44] love praise be to
[1:11:51] God and so
[1:11:53] fear fear
[1:11:56] works because of unbelief and
[1:12:00] doubt because of
[1:12:02] doubt we're living in a whole world of
[1:12:07] Doubt yet in the midst of it
[1:12:11] all think about it think about this
[1:12:15] Malachi 4 the prophet in this generation
[1:12:17] many times he would come say Allah you
[1:12:19] know who I'm waiting
[1:12:20] on he said now if I've preached the
[1:12:22] gospel and Jesus don't come and back it
[1:12:24] up you ain't got a B to believe the what
[1:12:26] I said and let me tell you something how
[1:12:29] many you knows one thing he taught us
[1:12:30] that if he taught something was contrary
[1:12:32] to B I wouldn't believe the
[1:12:34] prophet but Brandon would see visions
[1:12:36] and he see things and he'd go back to
[1:12:38] the scripture and make sure it's
[1:12:40] scriptural it all has got to be
[1:12:42] scriptural that's a good part of it it's
[1:12:45] scriptural but then Jesus would come
[1:12:46] down and do exactly what he did 2,000
[1:12:49] years ago a million more times millions
[1:12:53] of more times than he did when he walked
[1:12:54] the
[1:12:55] Earth he discerned a woman at the well
[1:12:58] thoughts and intents of her heart Jesus
[1:13:00] can come do that all of that and guess
[1:13:02] what this place still isn't
[1:13:04] full this place ought to be packed out
[1:13:08] brother Phil we ought to have a a super
[1:13:11] church but people don't
[1:13:13] believe every Church would be right here
[1:13:15] if they truly believe Jesus Christ
[1:13:18] because it wasn't brother bam doing it
[1:13:20] was Jesus Christ himself coming and
[1:13:22] doing what he's always done
[1:13:25] that woman that was discerned the
[1:13:26] thoughts of her heart she says went into
[1:13:28] the city after he told her that she had
[1:13:30] five husband one amen you know and the
[1:13:33] people believed her testimony said isn't
[1:13:35] this what the Messiah is going to do the
[1:13:38] prophet of God said this is him again
[1:13:40] this is the Messiah
[1:13:42] again and we all know the world's going
[1:13:45] to burn but God has sent the last
[1:13:48] prophet to the world other than the two
[1:13:50] Jew the two ones that's going to Israel
[1:13:53] amen but see the doubt look at where the
[1:13:55] doubt is today look at where the doubt
[1:13:58] takes churches it's a deceiving thing
[1:14:00] amen but in the midst of it all let me
[1:14:02] tell you
[1:14:03] something I believe that God has a group
[1:14:06] of people
[1:14:07] amen every one of his bride members
[1:14:10] those who truly love this because listen
[1:14:12] to this how many knows that one thing
[1:14:14] the prophet taught us that Eve
[1:14:15] disbelieved one word and took her down
[1:14:18] into the pits of death and fear
[1:14:27] if you lack the love of God it'll cause
[1:14:30] you to have a
[1:14:32] complex huh that's right and they they
[1:14:37] likeed the love of God after they did
[1:14:39] what they did after Adam and Eve did
[1:14:41] what they did what did they do they went
[1:14:44] and hid
[1:14:45] themselves they were ashamed themselves
[1:14:48] they knew they were guilty they tried to
[1:14:51] hide they had fear fear set in
[1:14:55] anybody that's not saved anybody that
[1:14:57] ain't got the Holy Ghost you got fear in
[1:14:58] your heart whether you believe it or not
[1:15:01] because guess what you've got
[1:15:02] condemnation in your heart and if you've
[1:15:04] got condemnation in your heart it's hard
[1:15:07] for you to have any kind of Faith isn't
[1:15:09] that right the only thing that you can
[1:15:11] possibly believe for is Lord forgive me
[1:15:13] of my sin make me right before you God
[1:15:17] will hear your prayer right amen but it
[1:15:21] brings fear it brings
[1:15:23] doubt amen it did it did Adam he brought
[1:15:26] fear in
[1:15:28] scare a
[1:15:30] complex
[1:15:33] amen and that's how Humanity was for
[1:15:36] 4,000 years man was having a
[1:15:39] complex they were scared of
[1:15:42] death but how many are glad that even
[1:15:45] during that time period there was some
[1:15:47] folks that did love the Lord there was
[1:15:50] some people that led the
[1:15:52] Lord amen and that love governed and
[1:15:58] caused them to have faith in God in the
[1:16:02] face of death
[1:16:05] itself
[1:16:07] amen that's right even in the face of
[1:16:12] death so what does do what does faith do
[1:16:15] for you first of all it puts it makes a
[1:16:19] man out of you it gives you
[1:16:23] courage the opposite opposite of scared
[1:16:26] is
[1:16:28] courage can I just say what comes to
[1:16:33] mind how many sometimes you know you
[1:16:36] feel like raising your hand or a you
[1:16:38] feel like saying Amen brother preach it
[1:16:42] huh or praise be to God or how many
[1:16:46] times think about it now that you pull
[1:16:49] back that you pull back from even
[1:16:51] worshiping the Lord because what go
[1:16:55] through your mind is what's somebody
[1:16:57] else going to
[1:17:05] think what's the next guy gonna
[1:17:09] think well the devil will put it in your
[1:17:12] mind well you wasn't quite perfect last
[1:17:15] week huh you wasn't quite
[1:17:18] perfect and if I say Amen all the rest
[1:17:21] of the Young Folks are going to look at
[1:17:23] me and thinking hey you know
[1:17:25] is he really holy is he a Christian you
[1:17:27] know and he's going to live up to his
[1:17:30] shouting in church here because we know
[1:17:32] you're not supposed to shout any louder
[1:17:34] than you live all kinds of things going
[1:17:37] but really when you just let go and
[1:17:39] don't worry about the next person if
[1:17:41] that bothers you tell hey praise be to
[1:17:44] God
[1:17:45] hallelujah just scatter that doubt don't
[1:17:48] worry about what everybody else thinks
[1:17:50] Worship the Lord he's worthy to be
[1:17:53] praised you wouldn't even draw your next
[1:17:56] breath if it wasn't for him you wouldn't
[1:17:58] have anything that you have if it wasn't
[1:18:00] for him and we come quiet as a
[1:18:03] mouse huh we hold back cuz the devil
[1:18:07] plays in our mind
[1:18:10] fear
[1:18:12] scare
[1:18:15] huh that's I'll tell you what the
[1:18:17] prophet of God didn't have much for a
[1:18:20] no in church that's right no Hallelujah
[1:18:24] no praise the Lord where's the
[1:18:28] freedom oh my I'll tell you
[1:18:31] what you get a young little girl out

[1:18:37] there what are you gonna do they're
[1:18:39] happy they're

[1:18:46] time and fight really big you know
[1:18:48] whatever they do who do hardly land to
[1:18:50] the Lord but listen amen they're free
[1:18:54] and brother B says Americans in America
[1:18:56] people aren't free people say they're
[1:18:57] free but they're not really
[1:18:59] free people are bound by things God came
[1:19:03] to give us
[1:19:05] Liberty the whole world is getting bound
[1:19:08] and they want to bind us and they want
[1:19:09] to bind everything now but there's a
[1:19:11] group of people who have been set free
[1:19:14] by the Holy Ghost we don't live by fear
[1:19:17] we don't live by
[1:19:19] doubt faith will take you into Heavenly
[1:19:21] places doubt doubt will take you in
[1:19:23] despair amen it'll take you into

[1:30:28] individual you're either governed by God
[1:30:30] or you're governed by the devil either
[1:30:33] by faith or by
[1:30:35] doubt one or the other governs you it
[1:30:39] makes you what you
[1:30:43] are there's people who just have a
[1:30:45] certain Aura the prophet of God said
[1:30:48] around them just something about
[1:30:50] them yeah some people you like to be
[1:30:53] around and some people you just would
[1:30:55] rather
[1:30:59] not that's right why because of the
[1:31:02] atmosphere that they create how many
[1:31:05] believes we are all creators let me say
[1:31:08] this
[1:31:11] 2021 is for your
[1:31:16] creating it's for you to create that's
[1:31:19] right that's right it's why it's a open
[1:31:22] book huh we're just on the the first or
[1:31:24] second page is't that right it's for you
[1:31:26] to write well I tell you I'm so frust is
[1:31:29] that what you want to write well I need
[1:31:32] a job but should nobody ever hire me you
[1:31:35] know I'm just too ugly I'm not smart
[1:31:38] enough I'm not no don't write all that
[1:31:41] stuff I am a child of God and Hallelujah
[1:31:45] God said that he was going to provide it
[1:31:46] for me when I get a job it's gonna be a
[1:31:49] good job hello and they create an
[1:31:53] atmosphere
[1:31:54] we're all
[1:31:57] creators that's right I believe it I
[1:32:00] don't care if a California sinks I don't
[1:32:03] care what happens you're still in
[1:32:06] Heavenly Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:32:09] we don't rock when the world rocks this
[1:32:11] place was to start
[1:32:13] shaking
[1:32:15] earthquake the Bible says we have a
[1:32:17] kingdom that cannot be
[1:32:19] shaken you have a kingdom on the inside
[1:32:21] of your heart it don't matter what comes
[1:32:24] it don't matter what goes oh and God
[1:32:27] loves to test Us in those places to see
[1:32:29] whether we're living by faith or whether
[1:32:31] we living by doubt right why do you
[1:32:34] think he put Israel down at the Red Sea
[1:32:37] and led him to a dead end
[1:32:42] Street and he
[1:32:43] had the sound of Chariots the dust
[1:32:47] rising up of the mightiest Army on the
[1:32:50] earth coming to take him back
[1:32:56] cuz he wanted to find out what they were
[1:32:58] governed
[1:33:00] by was it going to be Faith or are it
[1:33:03] going to be doubt because doubt
[1:33:06] automatically causes you to do what the
[1:33:09] first thing that you're going to do is
[1:33:13] complain it's going to gripe about your
[1:33:16] condition and where you're
[1:33:18] at if you want to find a person that is
[1:33:21] doubtful amen one lady was so positive
[1:33:25] always saying good things about
[1:33:27] everybody and somebody was going to get
[1:33:29] her I'll get her she said she asked the
[1:33:32] lady he says well what about the devil
[1:33:34] isn't he
[1:33:36] terrible what' she say she says no he's
[1:33:39] just a real good
[1:33:44] adversary that's some good to say he's
[1:33:46] good at his
[1:33:48] job huh wow you talk about the Holy
[1:33:51] Ghost how many knows bam taught us that
[1:33:53] the the Holy Ghost is never negative he
[1:33:55] is always
[1:33:58] positive praise be to God that's why we
[1:34:02] try to push that's why we try to get
[1:34:04] everybody in the Holy Ghost there won't
[1:34:06] be no complaining Among
[1:34:10] Us amen no matter what comes or what
[1:34:13] goes God was trying them testing them
[1:34:16] see whether they would be operated by
[1:34:18] faith or whether they'd be there was how
[1:34:20] many knows there was two of them
[1:34:24] when all of those 10 spies came back
[1:34:26] from from across the from across the
[1:34:28] river Amen to bring back a report of
[1:34:30] what Jericho and all these places amen
[1:34:32] the T spies didn't have the Holy
[1:34:35] Ghost man I want you to know that we
[1:34:38] went to a race yeah we went to a chariot
[1:34:41] race we watched The Chariot race we
[1:34:43] heard it and guess where it was it was
[1:34:45] on top of their City
[1:34:47] walls they got enough room to run
[1:34:50] chariot races over on top of them walls
[1:34:53] that's how they are you ain't never
[1:34:55] going to make
[1:34:57] it we'll never make it and guess what we
[1:35:01] peeped around the oak tree and we looked
[1:35:03] down there and there was this great big
[1:35:05] Goliath and
[1:35:07] Giants scared the liver out of
[1:35:12] us that's right tell it sister wo think
[1:35:17] about it scared us to
[1:35:21] death listen came back with a negative
[1:35:25] report she says if the preacher can yell
[1:35:27] so can
[1:35:32] I I love to sound of children we got
[1:35:34] life
[1:35:36] amen but so what was it think about it
[1:35:38] and there was two of them that had a
[1:35:41] different
[1:35:43] Spirit about them H how many know
[1:35:45] brother pH you know when you meet
[1:35:47] somebody you can always tell when
[1:35:49] there's just a different Spirit about
[1:35:51] him
[1:35:54] huh like brother Braham says there's
[1:35:56] poor folks that think they're so much
[1:35:58] better than
[1:35:59] you huh you going up to somebody that
[1:36:02] thinks they're better than you it's not
[1:36:04] going to be the best Vibes folks
[1:36:08] sorry they're not going to give you the
[1:36:10] time of day or think anything of you but
[1:36:14] then he's been with rich people he's
[1:36:15] been with wealthy people he says who
[1:36:18] make you feel like you're something he
[1:36:20] said now that's a real
[1:36:22] man why because when somebody can make
[1:36:25] you feel like the big man whether
[1:36:26] they're the big man or whatever
[1:36:29] amen it's about the
[1:36:31] atmosphere amen so folks let's create
[1:36:40] 2021 not by
[1:36:42] oursel but by this how me believe this
[1:36:45] is true nothing is solid in this world
[1:36:48] is this not even close there's no
[1:36:51] absolute outside of this there's nothing
[1:36:54] that you can have faith in outside of
[1:36:56] this I don't have my own message I
[1:36:59] preach Jesus's message I got to say what
[1:37:01] he said amen because when I inject my
[1:37:04] own ideas my own thoughts hello then I
[1:37:08] make the word the null and void and
[1:37:10] God's not GNA be in
[1:37:12] it lean not to your own understanding
[1:37:16] lean to the word of
[1:37:19] God it's all right let's go a little
[1:37:22] further
[1:37:24] people who
[1:37:26] lived by love lived by faith because of
[1:37:32] their love how many know Daniel Prayed
[1:37:35] three times a day he had a good
[1:37:38] relationship with God he must have had
[1:37:41] love in his heart because the Bible says
[1:37:44] in St John there he says perfect love
[1:37:47] casts out
[1:37:52] fear it takes doubt and locks it up say
[1:37:55] don't you try to get me into
[1:37:58] disbelief and any kind of scare any kind
[1:38:00] of fear it takes away any kind of fear
[1:38:04] makes you fearless and Daniel how many
[1:38:07] know that he faced
[1:38:10] death he faced the death with that faith
[1:38:15] that God had given
[1:38:18] him it was his life is on the line
[1:38:24] that's how real it
[1:38:26] is and because of the love that he had
[1:38:29] for God he had faith in God live or die
[1:38:34] he served God how many believes that
[1:38:37] that's how you need to love God more
[1:38:39] than your very
[1:38:42] life and as a result God honored him and
[1:38:45] shut the lion's mouth said nah this guy
[1:38:48] here he's got the love that he's
[1:38:49] supposed to have it produced Faith how
[1:38:53] many May believe that when you got the
[1:38:54] right kind of love for God it will
[1:38:56] produce the faith that you have need
[1:38:59] of it absolutely will produce the right
[1:39:02] kind of Faith three Hebrew children the
[1:39:05] same way they face death
[1:39:09] amen and whether you know it like it or
[1:39:11] not remember what I said earlier we're
[1:39:12] all we all face death we're all coming
[1:39:16] down to that door if time terries if
[1:39:20] time terries we come up to that door
[1:39:22] they came to that door and they believe
[1:39:25] God no matter what what did it do that
[1:39:28] Faith Delivered Daniel and that Faith
[1:39:30] also delivered the three Hebrew children
[1:39:32] out of the fiery furnace but B says a
[1:39:35] doubt and unbelief has no value
[1:39:37] whatsoever even if he was going to be
[1:39:39] taken out and shot tomorrow to have
[1:39:41] doubt and fear wouldn't do you a bit of
[1:39:44] good it wouldn't do you one bit it has
[1:39:47] no strength in
[1:39:48] it whatsoever
[1:39:53] people live by doubt many of them end up
[1:39:56] committing suicide that's how miserable
[1:39:59] it makes them how many knows the world
[1:40:01] is in a miserable
[1:40:04] condition why can't people just live
[1:40:06] decent dress decent love God and stay
[1:40:08] the
[1:40:09] same but people are changing all the
[1:40:11] time because you're not
[1:40:13] satisfied you're not satisfied that's
[1:40:16] right David how many knows David when he
[1:40:19] came up to Goliath when all of Israel
[1:40:21] was living by fear they were scared of
[1:40:23] that that
[1:40:24] Goliath but David had Faith he lived by
[1:40:27] faith and he did not have one bit of
[1:40:30] fear of that Goliath even though his
[1:40:32] very life was at
[1:40:34] stake it was a life and death situation
[1:40:37] for David and yet he had Faith to
[1:40:39] believe that God is more than able oh I
[1:40:42] hope this goes deep that this year may
[1:40:45] we come to that place that it don't
[1:40:46] matter if you're up against a rock wall
[1:40:48] I don't care if you facing a lion I
[1:40:49] don't care if you're facing a fiery
[1:40:51] furnace or whatever that is put your
[1:40:54] faith in
[1:40:55] God and
[1:40:58] rest and
[1:41:01] rest that's how I want to live this year
[1:41:04] it's more and more than I ever have
[1:41:08] before no matter what comes your way
[1:41:10] what problems you face young people I'm
[1:41:13] here to tell you you'll face a lot of
[1:41:15] difficult things sure you sure will but
[1:41:18] let me tell you one of the greatest
[1:41:19] lessons you'll learn quick is that you
[1:41:21] learn to give it to God amen try to
[1:41:25] handle it yourself and see how bitterly
[1:41:26] it fails but they commit it to God and
[1:41:29] watch him bring you out the other side
[1:41:32] praise the
[1:41:33] Lord all
[1:41:36] right amen how about Paul let's talk
[1:41:40] about coming up to this door of death
[1:41:42] for a minute Paul he said he come up to
[1:41:45] the because let me just say
[1:41:47] this there's many battles that we Face
[1:41:50] many things we have to overcome in life
[1:41:53] right right but one of the greatest
[1:41:55] enemies one of the greatest things that
[1:41:57] you'll face in this world is coming to
[1:41:59] the door of
[1:42:00] death
[1:42:03] amen having to face that place of going
[1:42:05] over to the other side and like I said
[1:42:08] faith will actually lift you up in such
[1:42:10] a place that you don't even have to fear
[1:42:14] death
[1:42:15] itself Paul was one of them I'm GNA
[1:42:17] start with Paul I me knows Paul amen he
[1:42:20] says oh death where is your sting oh
[1:42:22] grave where is your Victory he didn't
[1:42:26] have a problem laying his CH head in The
[1:42:28] Chopping Block I know maybe one of those
[1:42:31] things that come sliding
[1:42:34] down he was more I'm more than willing
[1:42:36] to die death where is your sting grave
[1:42:40] where is your Victory but I know the one
[1:42:42] that gives me the Victory and it's Jesus
[1:42:44] Christ Our Lord he didn't
[1:42:47] hesitate why because he lived by
[1:42:51] faith amen
[1:42:54] praise the Lord how many knows brother
[1:42:56] brah said that whenever uh he was in the
[1:42:58] middle of that field and that killer
[1:43:00] bull came at him and had killed some
[1:43:03] other man already because that's why
[1:43:05] they put him in that field and he didn't
[1:43:07] remember that he was in there and he was
[1:43:08] going across that field to go pray for
[1:43:09] somebody and here that bull rose up in
[1:43:11] the middle of the field brother Brandon
[1:43:14] was a game W and brother Brandon went
[1:43:15] like this where's my gun reached for his
[1:43:19] gun ah I left it in the truck
[1:43:24] I'm done that's it I'm going to be
[1:43:27] ground in the dirt by this bull reach
[1:43:31] for the gun what he do next no gun me
[1:43:35] look around where is that tree where is
[1:43:39] that tree where is that fence tree
[1:43:41] there's no tree the fence is too
[1:43:44] far this guy he's gonna be a lot faster
[1:43:47] me
[1:43:48] huh and he begin to say Lord if this is
[1:43:51] how I'm supposed to go
[1:43:53] let me go bravely huh and he said
[1:43:56] something come down over him amen don't
[1:43:59] you want that to H happen when you are
[1:44:01] faced with a very hard situation just
[1:44:04] let something come down over you let God
[1:44:06] take over that's where God Specializes
[1:44:10] is in places where you really need him
[1:44:12] like that that's where you really see
[1:44:13] God it's no time to lose it it's no time
[1:44:16] to be scared like the disciples were
[1:44:18] remember they were scared they were
[1:44:21] afraid says they were afraid and what
[1:44:23] did Jesus have to say fear
[1:44:25] not be of good cheer you're not seeing a
[1:44:29] ghost it's
[1:44:30] me isn't it something how did Jesus send
[1:44:33] him on beforehand to the ship and then
[1:44:35] he went up to pray I think there was a
[1:44:37] plan in it the whole time don't you yeah
[1:44:39] I think there was a plan in the whole
[1:44:41] time and about the Fourth Watch which I
[1:44:43] understand perhaps if I'm okay with my
[1:44:45] understanding Fourth Watch would be what
[1:44:46] from 3:00 midnight or 3:00 in the
[1:44:49] morning to about
[1:44:51] 6 you know 6 to 9 9 to 12 12 to 3 3 to 6
[1:44:55] somewhere in there the Fourth Watch of
[1:44:57] the night I don't know about you but I
[1:44:59] see somebody coming about 3 4:00 at
[1:45:02] night
[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:04] dark and walking on the water I'll be
[1:45:07] the first to admit I'd probably be a
[1:45:09] little scared
[1:45:12] myself who wouldn't
[1:45:15] be I'd rub my
[1:45:19] eyes D rub what is that but as he came
[1:45:23] Closer
[1:45:25] Closer hey we know
[1:45:28] him that's
[1:45:30] Jesus ain't that right that's
[1:45:33] Jesus Peter should have said y'all calm
[1:45:36] yourself down it's Jesus don't you worry
[1:45:38] about
[1:45:40] nothing but the Bible says they were all
[1:45:43] screaming for fear they screamed out for
[1:45:46] fear my's gonna get
[1:45:50] us all screamed out for fear
[1:45:53] Jesus had to talk to them fear not be of
[1:45:57] good Che it is I Be not Afraid brother
[1:46:03] Brandon took the same type and he
[1:46:05] preached a message on it his ey Be not
[1:46:06] Afraid when discernment went forth some
[1:46:09] people call it mental telepathy reading
[1:46:11] their minds and everything else he says
[1:46:13] no this is Jesus and he's saying the
[1:46:16] same thing to our generation it's me
[1:46:19] don't be afraid of
[1:46:20] me it is I be not afraid this is this is
[1:46:24] me this is Jesus spoke to us that way
[1:46:27] aren't you glad for Jesus that did that
[1:46:28] for us in this generation it is I Be not
[1:46:32] Afraid amen and then when Peter actually
[1:46:35] saw that it was him and believed he said
[1:46:38] if that's
[1:46:40] you huh bid me come to
[1:46:44] thee and he said
[1:46:46] come come how many believe Jesus is
[1:46:49] still telling every one of us come I'm
[1:46:52] here I haven't forsaken y'all I didn't
[1:46:55] die in the Dark Ages I didn't the
[1:46:57] denomination sins cross me I'm still
[1:46:59] here I'm still
[1:47:02] alive amen I'm here separate from all of
[1:47:05] them say here come to Christ Baptist

[1:47:26] last I am he which was which is and
[1:47:30] which is to come he which was dead and
[1:47:32] now I am alive forever I'm not dead how
[1:47:35] many believe he's not dead he's here
[1:47:38] what whatever your situation whether
[1:47:40] it's lions or whether it's tigers or
[1:47:42] whether it's problems or whatever it is
[1:47:44] it just just hang in there amen he's
[1:47:47] with
[1:47:49] us let's look at two people perhaps
[1:47:53] brother brah talked about FF Bosworth he
[1:47:56] was about a hundred years old he had
[1:47:58] been a
[1:47:59] missionary he had been a great
[1:48:02] missionary in the
[1:48:04] 1800s I guess early
