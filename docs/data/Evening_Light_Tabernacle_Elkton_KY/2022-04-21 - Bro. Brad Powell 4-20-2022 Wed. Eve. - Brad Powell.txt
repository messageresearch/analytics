of all and he is the kingdom of your heart this this night this evening good to be in the house of the lord and uh it's kind of another rainy dreary night but uh praise god we're able to be here and you know last wednesday we wasn't able to to meet and it's uh it's always frustrating uh when you you're prepared and you're wanting to be in the house of the lord and then something like that happens but you you kind of have to use judgment and and look at the protect the people and make sure that you know try to do the best you can and uh we're thankful for deacons that that think think ahead and and you know look out and and take care of those situations like that so good to be in the house lord we won't keep you standing long i just do want to kind of finish and where i started the last sunday that i preached i guess it was and i just want to say i appreciate the message brother byler preached on sunday on i believe and you know i thought man the more i thought about that i thought i believe and you know if more people just believed what kind of world would we live in you know brother branham he made a statement he talked about if i think if he said if he got to the end and they said he couldn't even enter into heaven he would live just like he is today and i thought man if i could just if people would just live a christian life what kind of world would we live in just the simple rules you know the it it you know just uh just following the the commandments of the of christian living there'd be no murder no adultery no you know sin i mean people would just get along you you'd never have a a rift with your neighbor you know everything would just be great but that's not the world we live in so turn with me if you would in your bibles and and we're going to look into exodus and i'm going to also read a portion of scripture out of mark and uh out of the book of hebrews so if you want to just kind of tag those and i'm gonna try not to stay keep you too long and we spoke last time on changing clothes and we looked at esther and mordecai and we brought out there in isaiah 61 and luke 4 where jesus was reading the prophecies it was given about him and and and we talked about the garment of praise and and what what mordecai when he was you know in the land there and he rented his clothes he had ashes and so forth put on him and sackcloth so we're going to look at it a little different tonight and and try to apply it to us and and jesus and we want to title this living behind the veil and we know a veil is a covering and and so in the very beginning there in the garden of eden you have adam and eve and uh covering was given to them to hide their nakedness and and because they had fallen and and it served as a barrier kind of so to speak between them and god and when any time you're talking about a veil in the bible that's kind of what you look at so um looking here i want to read you this quote brother brown said men and women he said how could you turn such a one down when he is sitting there clothed in his majesty he sits in glory this morning what do you do he came here to the world homeless to make a way for homeless men and women where men and women who has no hope for men and women who has no place to go where homeless wanderers and those who are pla or pleasure crazy walking down the streets today horse races gambling and so forth trying to find comfort he made a place for him every man it's just as free as the water runs whosoever will let him come now listen to what he says he says you can't walk outside of this veil he said you've got to come in here you've got to come in here you've got to find out you've got to get here where there's nothing between you and god so adam and eve as we said they started out and they had this cover in between as a barrier kind of hiding between them and god but he says you can't stay there we got to get into we got to get in here where there's nothing between you and god he says where the angels of god can descend and ascend back and forth bringing the messages of god and back and forth to who he says the individual he didn't say this church or that church or this group or those under this pastor or that pastor no the individual it's between you and i and god the individual he says and there he sits nothing between my soul and my savior there he sits the mighty conqueror and he rent every veil in two he rent the veil that you could be saved he rent the veil that if you've committed adultery if you've cursed if you've done anything wrong those are some big things if you've done anything wrong he rent that veil for you that stick that satan holds over you how many has ever had satan beat you in the head with a stick he rent that veil for you he said he rent it all you have to do is receive him if you're sick today and the doctor says you can't get well he rent that veil into and everything is broken before god he rent every veil he tears down every domain there's nothing satan can do that can hinder you if you stand behind the veil if you're living behind the veil with god he tears down every domain he sits there today the mighty conqueror since he rent the veil into exodus 26 moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twine linen and blue and purple and scarlet with cherubims of cunning works shout thou make them let's just bow our heads heavenly father we thank you lord for this day you've given us for your grace and mercy and for allowing us to gather tonight and freedom and to worship you in spirit and truth uh there's many around the world that can't gather like this tonight and brothers and sisters in china and different places that have to have little hidden fellowships and hidden communions and but lord we've been granted freedom that we can come and worship worship you tonight with boldness and we can lift your name up and praise you and we can gladly say the name of jesus to the world so that the world can hear it lord and we're thankful for that lord we just ask tonight as we look at this little thought that you would bless the meditation of our hearts and mind and that you would just lead us and guide us and open our hearts to receive open the ears of the hearers and anoint the lips of the speaker lord as i commit myself into your hands now in jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated sorry to keep you standing so long i'm also going to read out of mark 15 and i'm going to read kind of a lengthy lengthy portion of scripture here but i think it's to to draw a picture that we need to look at tonight and and see exactly what this veil means and what this relationship with god means mark 15 and straight way in the morning the chief priest held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council and bound jesus and carried him away and delivered him to pilate and so pilate willing to to content the people released barabbas unto them and delivered jesus which he had scourged him to be crucified so we've got a murderer and a savior what a combination released a murderer and imprisoned and and crucified a savior and the soldier led him away into the hall called praetorium which i want you to notice this is just means a common hall this is a common place that the governor would have been in the in in the in the palace or in the rank there so it's a common place and they call together the whole band and watch now they clothed him with purple royalty and planted a crown of thorns and put it about his head and they began to salute him hail king of the jews they smote him on the head with a reed and did spit upon him and bowing their knees worshiped him and when they had mocked him they took off the purple now we've been talking about clothes and covering and colors and different symbolism and going on in the bible so look how they looked at him first they mocked him by putting purple on him then they mocked him by taking purple off of him and then they put back on his own clothes it says and they let him out to crucify him and they compel one simon the cyrenian who passed in the coming of the country and we'll skip on down and they bring to him to a place called galgotha which is being interpreted the place of the school and they gave him to drink wine mangled with myrrh but he received it not and when they had crucified him now watch what they did they parted his garments casting lots upon them of what every man should take and it was the third hour these are all important the third hour it's important with what we're going to talk about here in just a minute and they crucified him and the superscription of the accusation was written over the king of the jews and with him they crucified two thieves the one on the right and one on his left and the scripture was fulfilled which saith he was numbered with the transgressors and they that passed by rallied on him wagging their heads and saying ah thou that destroys the temple and build it in three days save thyself come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking said unto themselves with scribes he saved others himself he cannot save let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross that we may see and believe and they that were crucified with him reviled him and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour and the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying iloilo which is being interpreted my god my god why hast thou forsaken me you realize that was for you and me why have you forsaken me my god why have you forsaken me and some of them stood by when they heard and said behold he calleth the lies and one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him a drink saying let alone let us see whether our lies come to take him down and jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost and the veil of the temple was rent and twain from top to bottom and when the centurion which stood over against him saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost he said truly this man was the son of god brother brown said you look at that roman soldier that stood there and pierced his pierced him messiah pierced his heart with the sword and the spear and he looked up at him and he saw the earth turning black the buildings begin shaking the temple veil was rent from top to bottom and he throwed his hand over his heart and he said truly that was the son of god he said yes sir he said his own arc enemies at the time had to testify of who he was the roman centurion his arc enemy who would pierce him now had to stand before him and say my this truly was the man of god what significant is that it's amazing turn with me to hebrews 10. hebrews 10 19 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful but promised amen we look here and we see at the beginning of jesus's ministry and we talked about this in our last service when jesus goes into isaiah 61 and he begins he visits the synagogue in his hometown of nazareth and he goes in there and they he picks up a piece of the scroll and they hand they where they hand him the scroll and he opens it up into messianic prophecy he begins to look at it and he begins to read there in the scripture and he begins to tell isaiah 61 who he is and he's beginning to proclaim that i am the one that one day is going to take away the spirit of despair and i'm the one who's going to give the garment of praise so jesus is here and he's reading that and he's telling the prophecy back in luke 4 now and he's proclaiming i'm the one you've been looking for i'm the one you've been waiting for i'm the one you've been longing for i am that very messiah that you've been talking about when he read those scrolls and he opened them up he didn't pull any punches he wasn't afraid to stand there and say this is me i'm telling you who i am i'm the one that can take away all the despair in your life and give you a garment of praise that you can have joy and peace and love in this synagogue here he's making a distinction between his first coming and his second coming and we look at that he's proclaiming the year of the lord's favor and but he's also saying that the day of vengeance of our god is upon us now today we live in a place that we have a foretaste of what this garment of praise is all about we don't have to live under a fainted spirit we don't have to live under a dreary or a dreaded day that we live in even though the world around us is falling apart we don't have to live that way because he came into isaiah 61 and said this is who i am and i give myself to you the garment of praise isaiah is prophesying time and time again here that we have to have joy we can have joy we don't have to have sackcloths we don't have to be like mordecai we don't have to have ashes upon us because there was a work that was done on calvary i said there's a work that was done on calvary that we don't have to live under that kind of bondage anymore brothers and sisters god elohim the self-existing one when he was out there all alone and he wanted to be worshiped he wanted to be loved he wanted to be glorified and lifted up and praised because he was an object of worship and he began to create the angels the seraphims the cherubims and all these different ones that would just sit there and worshiping day after day after day but he needed more he wanted something flesh so he creates adam and eve and then we see it here that adam and eve we know there's something very wicked happened there in the garden we don't have to go into tell we know what it was but now there's this barrier that comes up between god and those he created to worship him the very ones that should be given and love and the other brother brown said he would come down in the cool of the evening and they would have fellowship what what a wonder what a wonderful way to worship god it's just a fellowship with him and here they would come down there in the in the cool of the day but now there was a barrier between them but you know god couldn't settle for that god couldn't settle for that he said you know what i'm gonna have to come and make an atonement for that sin i'm gonna have to come down and i'm gonna have to find a way to restore this fellowship between me and my people that's you and i and he said i'm going to have to come down here and he longs to turn the faith of people and fill us with joy brothers and sisters part of the fulfillment of jesus's ministry was the pouring out of himself the holy spirit and filling his followers or his disciples with it that was one of the main fulfillments in jesus's ministry he wants us to be so like him he wants us to be so full of the holy spirit that we cannot help but praise him we cannot help but to lift him up we cannot help but to love him we cannot help but to exalt him and magnify his name and when we fall short of that god's not happy many times we're the ones that put up the barrier between us and god we put up the barriers between us and god and the things we listen to and the things we see and the things we do we put the barrier up because god came to take it down he wants that fellowship so the believers today who know the joy of the lord who know salvation who know forgiveness who's been filled with the holy ghost those people have and should be wearing the garment of praise stay with me now and those people are always seeking ways to honor god they're always seeking ways to please god to honor god they're busy serving others you ever notice most christians have a servant's heart yeah what did he deserve so what's this what's his believers what's his followers going to do but serve they have a loving heart they're not always looking to pick and criticize and poke and have hatred towards others i can't find anywhere in the scripture where jesus done that towards any human being no he came to love and they find grace in each other they find grace and they're merciful and they're kind do you realize that jesus came to earth to live an example life before his disciples he come to live that life and so that when he died and he returned in spirit form and distributed himself amongst his people in the book of acts on the day of pentecost they would know exactly how to act everything he done was to set the stage for what we're to do think about this he want he knew he wanted him to know how to act we ought to know how to live by the life he lived we should know how to behave by the way he behaved yeah we should know how to conduct ourselves as christians because he conducted himself as a christian he was christ-like because he was christ because let me tell you i hope you're filled with the holy ghost but the holy ghost doesn't change you realize on the day of pentecost that's the same holy ghost that's here today [Applause] it didn't change it never has changed it never will change the spirit is still going to act like jesus but the problem is when we don't act like christians it's because we allow things into our lives we allow things into our lives and then our spirit begins to change you know there's a there's there's days you walk and you feel like you're just walking so close to god that you could just put your arm around him but then you know he says you start doing things you let the bars down and you begin to compromise now this is not me this is him and you begin to get little clicks amongst you and you know pastor so-and-so and deacon so and so and before you know you've listened to this and that and that's the reason we've got trouble is we listen to the devil we listen to the devil and he said you begin to listen to him and you get a snarl instead of listening to that gentle dove that holy spirit you begin to snarl instead of listening to that dub that would lead you and guide you and love you and bless you why do we do that why do we do that why do we allow ourselves to fall into the trap to where we begin to listen to things we begin to gossip about things we begin to look at things we begin to hear things we begin to act different than what christians act why do we do that because he says what it does next thing you know you have those little temper spasms and then he says you know that little dove just flies right away she can't stand it that dove can't stand it her nature's different she can't stand it at all you go to talking about your neighbor she can't stand it she won't put up with it she takes flight and goes away he just can't stand it any longer the dove is gentle the dove is meek and it can't stand anything except it's got the same kind of nature so well where do we have to find our nature today where do we have to find our nature today we have to find our nature in that heavenly that doves nature that heavenly nature because if we find ourselves under any other nature we begin to snarl what causes the snarl pressure yeah most people are just fine until pressure comes and they begin to feel the squeeze maybe it's a job maybe it's a boss maybe it's it's a just financial maybe it's the home maybe it's your children but you feel that pressure come on and next thing you know [Music] it's such a fine line it's such a fine line that's why the garment of praise is so important that's why the garment of praise is so important because people who wear the garment of praise they're always praising the lord for what he's doing in their life no matter what they're going through i had somebody tell me i can remember where i was i was in florida and i gave a little a little testimony a little exhortation to the young people at last last year in florida for our baseball team and i'm talking about some hardships and i was talking about how you still praise god and you're going through things but you still praise god and they said are you one of those that's always praising god no matter what's happening yeah yeah yeah is it easy no no there's nothing easy about when you're going through the hardest trials of your life to say god thank you i love you i know i need this that's not easy but when you wear that garment or praise no matter what your hearts love to sing your hearts love to make music to the lord your hearts you face the challenges with expectations of provision like we talked about knowing that no matter what you're going through god is going to provide some way somehow over the mountain under the mountain around the mountain through the river it doesn't matter god's going to get you there people wearing the garment of praise they enjoy worshiping with other christians these home believers almost said homeschoolers i'm sorry these home believers i'm just going to say it that are pushing play and never going anywhere i i can't understand that there has to be a fellowship to take place and if you love god if you're a christian and you're wearing the garment of praise you love to fellowship and you love to worship in the house of god and the passion that's within you calls you and makes you grown to come to the house of god amen i have to be honest to say i felt horrible last wednesday because when i seen what the weather had done i thought man we could have been there and i had that in my heart just thinking did we make the right decision but you know those saying you can't turn back time but my point is there should be a longing to be here to hear what god has placed on his anointed the pastor of the church who's been inspired and led by god to make sure that you get there god puts these people in place to make sure that we have a road and a path and that we don't waver and deviate off of that road the believer with a garment of praise they want every moment on this earth to account for eternity because they've discovered a joy in walking hand in hand like i said when we started i don't know what i would do if i didn't just believe in god [Music] my whole life revolved around what i've been taught what i believe and what i trust that god is going to do in my life my very thoughts my actions the way i treat people if i didn't have this i would be a mean mean person i know my old nature i know how mean i would be without god i'm gonna give you a little conf i don't know if i should do this i'll give you a little confession i've always said if i wasn't a christian i think it'd be neat to be one of these heist people that goes in and hides stuff i'm talking mission impossible kind of stuff you know how thoughts go through your mind sometimes i thought man to go in and steal the greatest piece of art off of a wall and walk out and nobody can find you or see you and know it but thank god something got a hold to me at a young age thank god that the holy ghost come down and spoke into my life or i would probably be living some kind of life of crime or hatred or murder or gangster dramatic drug dealer but all of this is only possible through the death burial and resurrection of jesus christ when you look at isaiah 61 and you read what jesus was saying to the people when he stood there and he said i preached good tidings to the poor jesus was announcing that i'm here to heal the damage that sin brings because sin brings damage in all of our lives if you've lived a sinful life there's a lot of damage there's a lot of scars there's a lot of cuts there's a lot of hurts but he says i've come with a work of redemption to bring good tidings to the poor he says i've come because sin impoverishes you know sin just pulls it out of you sin just depletes you of a human to be a human being you are you've all seen the pictures of people that are drug addicts at 20 they look like they're 40 50 60. beautiful was once a beautiful young woman or beautiful or a handsome handsome young man and they get on get on drugs they begin to sin they begin to drink they begin to do meth and and all these different uh abuse abusive things their bodies begin to wrinkle their hair falls out their teeth falls out they become a skeleton and death has taken over but jesus says i'll heal the brokenhearted aren't you thankful that if you was once that person or if you know a person that is that person that jesus says i can come and i can take away your sin i can heal your body i can take away those dirty filthy desires i'm here to heal the brokenhearted i'm here to set the captives free because sin makes us captive if you don't think so you're deceived because once you find yourself dabbling into a world of sin every day that you dabble and dabble and dabble it's that many more days harder to get away to get away to get away he says i've come to proclaim liberty to the captives and to open the prison to those that are bound and to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and if you look in your bible there in isaiah 61 where he's reading that there's a comma place there and that's an important comma because he's saying i'm doing this now while i'm here and then he pauses and he's pausing and looking out amongst these people these sadducees and pharisees and as he's reading in this temple and he pauses right there before he says and to proclaim the day of vengeance of our god what does that pause for it's to tell us that even though he came and he was there their very presence comma there is a day of vengeance and that is going to be the second coming of the lord and that's when you can have the full fulfillment of everything that i've ever ever promised you did you realize that that oh that comma in the year of the lord and the before the day of the vengeance stood for over 2 000 years and it's still standing there today someday that comma is going to be erased let me tell you brothers and sisters someday the biblical prophecy tells us there's coming a day when we're going to shift gears there's going to be a change in speed i'm going to speed up this world's going to slow down and in a minute an instant in a moment in a twinkling of an eye there's going to be a transformation to take place and they were going to be right there at that land beyond the river it's just waiting there it's just sitting there waiting can you imagine that everything you've dreamed of everything you've hoped of it's not often some dream or some fairy tale it is in reality right now sitting there waiting for us to step from this dimension into that dimension he has sent me because sin brings grief and i will comfort those who mourn and i will give you instead of ashes of mourning i'm going to give you people beauty instead of mourning itself i'm going to give you the oil of joy and instead of the spirit of heaviness i'm going to give you the garment of praise so why if he said he was going to do that why do we find ourselves set so many times covered in ashes why do we find ourselves so many times with a sac claw phone when jesus is alive you know we just went through easter they didn't find him the tomb was empty he came and he broke bread and expose the wounds in his hands and they said oh he's alive [Music] vanished he's alive today are you hearing me there is no reason for any of us sitting here to be sitting in any kind of ashes any kind of mourning any kind of sackcloth because there's so much that god has in store for us don't let this become common to you don't let this don't let this church service don't let your pastor don't let your brothers and sisters don't let god become common to us we need each other we need our pastor we need the church we need the message we need god more than we've ever had him before the word beauty when you look there it talks is talking about a beautiful crown or a headdress you're going to take off those ashes and they're going to give you a crown upon your head that they may be called the trees of righteousness oh i like this one because these trees of righteousness when we look at street trees what do we think we think of strength we think of strong beautiful standing trees that stand there strong and beautiful righteousness is what he's saying and when we look at these trees we can see that these people are planted by god and brothers and sisters as the song says like a tree planted by the water brothers and sisters there's a tree that is planted by the water and it is planted by the feeding off the river of life that's a special kind of tree that tree that's planted by the water it has root run deep it has roots that run really really deep and let me tell you that tree won't be shaken that tree that's planted by the river and drinking water from the life from the river of life every wind of false doctrine that tree won't be shaken every six it comes its way that tree won't be shaken every hardship that comes that way that tree won't be shaken show me a christian that is planted by the river and feeding off the water the living water of life and i'll show you a christian that cannot fall i didn't say you wouldn't fail i said you won't fall let's get to this veil exodus 26 it says and thou shall make a veil of blue and purple and scarlet entwined linen of cunning work with cherubim shall it be made i want to break down kind of what we're looking at when we look at this veil give me just a few minutes here to to break this down we're looking at the colors here we look at blue the color blue is a primary color we know in it found in the rainbow we can find the color blue it's a primary color and so when we look at blue blue signifies the healing power of god blue signifies the sky blue signifies that everywhere you look when you step out of your house in the morning and you see the blue skies and you're looking around saying my goodness that's beautiful you're seeing god blue signifies healing there was a woman in the bible that had a blood issue for 12 years and you know what she said if i could just touch the hem of his garment do you know what color the hem of his garment was take a guess blue if i could just touch the hem of his garment i know i'll be made whole so blue signifies healing and god all around us we look at red also a primary color the color of red signifies blood the color blep of red also signifies earth so when we talk about adam we talk about earth we talk about blood we talk about red the decorations of this tabernacle had all the symbolism in it and it's telling us that adam who's created from the dust of the earth with sin in his life or it's susceptible to sin but through the lord's holy power can be made pure so you got blue which is healing and god and red which is earth and blood and sin and the two come together what do you get when you mix blue and red purple you get royalty purple means royalty purple is not a primary color purple is a secondary color so you take you got to take sin that's filthy and nasty and dirty and you got to go over here to god where it's blue and there's healing and there's there's strength right there in god and you bring the two together and you find yourself a royal priesthood that's not too deep for you is it and here you see living in this royal priesthood as you walk into this tabernacle where this veil hangs is the barrier between man and god the holies of holies here hangs this linen veil of red blue purple and cherubims you know why it's hanging there it's hanging there to protect the people from god it wasn't hanging there to protect god from the people let that sink in for a minute it was there to protect the people that were filthy and dirty and unclean from coming into the presence of the holies of holies because inside that holies of holies is where the ark of the covenant was it's where the mercy seat was it's where the shekinah glory was and this was a sight to behold think about it what will it be when jesus comes back think about that second coming what would it be when jesus comes in all of his glory and we the church the bride of jesus christ we're going to welcome his appearing right and we're going to be singing praise and glory and we'll fall to our knees who knows what we'll do i can only imagine the song says what will we do when we see him come and what will we do but you know there's going to be another group of people that won't be looked at looking at him that way there's going to be a multitudes of people that's rejected him there's going to be a multitudes of people that don't even want to see his face and they're going to cry for the mountains and the rock to fall upon them but you know what it says it says that they'll be forced to stand there and behold his face as a righteous judge [Music] so inside this tabernacle inside this tabernacle this veil with blue and scarlet and purple hanging there embroidered with the cherubs hanging there gazing over every move these priests made can you imagine what a heavenly sight that was as you enter into the temple and you walk through the holy chamber then you go in and if you're the priest you're able to go into the holies of holies and when you walk in it must have been a heavenly sight to look see the blue all everywhere the sky and you feel god's presence all around and you see the the red and and the purple the royalty and you see the cherubims that are that are embroidered on the inside of the tabernacle on the inside of the tapestry and they're just gazing over everything that's going in it kind of reminds me of exactly what it would be like if i was standing in the presence of god in heavenly places and the cherubims and the angels and the seraphims all around and here this tabernacle hangs with these cherubs the same creatures that were placed at the entrance of the guard eden when adam and eve fell when they were driven out to protect the tree of life these same images these same cherubims are woven into the tapestry on the inside as to say you have now entered into heavenly places and you're in god's mist and this veil that hung so majestically was ripped from top to bottom at the death of jesus on the cross before that mankind had no access to god's presence adam and eve had no direct path anymore between them and god we had no direct path to get to god but in his death jesus brought forth the resurrection and all those believing in him the son of god and that he could take away the sin of the world now they are created an open door think about this an open door into the very presence of god an open door that we could go to him at will and we don't have to depend upon a man we don't have to depend upon a doctrine we don't have to depend upon a creed we don't have to get anybody's permission can you imagine if we had to go to our pastor say pastor do you think i'd talk to god today you think it would be okay if i talk to god today no we don't have to live that way there was a direct door that was now opened up between man and between god and matthew mark and luke all recount that when jesus when he cried out with the loud voice yielded up the ghost and the veil was rent from top to bottom and the earth began to quake and the rocks ran the graves were opened and the prophet said abraham and sarah went walking through the streets look here i remember them do you do you know do you know them do you know you remember this yeah i remember it this is reality this is what really happened and but then they were recognized and they vanished jesus is death now watch this and follow the tearing of the veil took place in the ninth hour about three o'clock in the afternoon you know what's significant about that because that was the time of the evening when sacrifices were happening so there was hundreds of people if not thousands of people gathered around the tabernacle around the temple and they were there to give their evening sacrifice i just wonder what they thought when this miraculous event happened when this veil was rent in two i wonder what they thought i wonder what the priests who were serving in the temple must have thought when they watched an unseen hand ripped this veil in who and exposed god to the entire world do you realize that's what happened something that was so much so hidden so secretive that only a priest could get in there once a year for a few minutes at a time dressed in holy garment through a holy ceremony through a holy sacrifice that they had to make now this whole thing this whole god that we've been hidden been hiding away so long that we can't get in touch with now he's exposed himself to the entire world and let me just tell you how much god loves you talking about this veil when jesus died and that veil and that temple was there this was 60 foot high 30 foot wide four inches thick yeah of hides badger skins fine linens overlaid four inches thick josephus said that 300 priests were required to move it and he said two teams of oxen could not have torn it in half that's how much god loves you that he reached down from the portals of glory and grabbed a hold of this side and this side and shred it like a piece of paper and said here i am for you here i am for you tearing that veil was removing a barrier into the presence of god as believers as believers we have truly a high and wonderful privilege to know that christians can only enjoy this you know i said wouldn't it be just wonderful if the whole world lived a christian life if that was a case we wouldn't have a need for this but it's a privilege that only christians can enjoy but because before that entering into god's presence you had to show full obedience i don't know about you but i'm not always fully obedient um i can admit that i have to probably say i've been a little bit fearful to peek into that holies of holies you know there was a time when there was two i think it was two of aaron's sons they said we're going to go into the holies of holies and we're going to create a fire like nobody's ever seen they didn't do it the way god said do it they found themselves burnt to ashes pretty much yeah how would you like to have been the ones that uh they called down and said hey we need you to go in there and get those two guys out my brother jeff said nope not me this was how serious it was i couldn't step into that veil but yet my heart longs to live behind the veil it's amazing to think that the pharisees and sadducees were standing there that day when the veil was rent and it was torn from top to bottom and they're standing there in the temple trying to go into the holies of holies and they had the holies of holies right before them you see how people can get so much misunderstood of where they're at there was a 1896 juts judson van deventer i read a story in the the author of this little story said he put a veil up in his life and he he then got cold in spirit he done got cold and spirit and he was singing in the choir during a revival did you hear what i said he was cold in spirit singing in revival and he heard god calling him and calling him back and so he responded and he went to the old-fashioned altar and said he committed his life new to the lord and he forsook everything got got on fire for god again become an evangelist began ministering in america and england and scotland and he wrote a song and says all to jesus i surrender all to him i freely give and that's where we as believers if we're going to step into that holies of holies veil or no veil we have to find ourselves fully surrendered to god in his presence daily in his presence daily i surrender all that's the kind of commitment we have to make these high priests of israel they entered in behind they came into the very presence of god and looked into the light of god's glory and i can only imagine that they trembled in fear facing the shekinah glory trembling in fear sprinkle their little blood sacrifice two or three five minutes at the most get out of there not allowed to go back until the next year but when jesus came in flesh you know the bible tells us we read where it says when the veil was rent as his flesh his flesh that was torn as he went up on calvary he broke down all the barriers that stood between mankind and access to the father through the blood of jesus christ our great high priest there's a finished work that's been done once and for all what privileged people we are tonight we don't have a veil we don't have a veil that's blocking our entrance into the presence of god there's been a way made the door's open and we're even encouraged brothers and sisters to march right into the presence of almighty god he invites us to come to him there's an invitation that goes out to his people that whosoever will come to me come to me and i'll draw you come to me there's been a way that's been made for you and i and the prophet said that souls that were once condemned to death to die and go to a devil's grave the devil has now been conquered do you realize that though when the veil was rent brother baller quote that brother branham used and i love it when he says he went down there into the into the pits of hell and he talked to satan and said oh you finally arrived have you he said i thought i had you when i had the three hebrew children i thought i had you with daniel in the lion's den you know when that happened that all took place right after that veil was torn that's when he went down there and he began to battle for you and i and brother branham said when the when that veil was torn that's when he became the mighty conqueror that's when he became the mighty conqueror and he said the grave that has been conquered sickness has been conquered superstition has been conquered malice has been conquered hatred has been conquered indifference has been conquered starchiness has been conquered self-styles has been conquered everything has been conquered because christ is the conqueror he ripped that veil that hid god from man we don't have a mysterious god today we don't have to wonder what god is we don't have to wonder what his blessings are we don't have to wonder what salvation is [Music] it's all been given right there for us he ripped that veil and now god dwells above among men he rent that veil that kept off god's healing do you see how important it is that we have a direct line because when that veil was up you couldn't have healing he ran that veil off that kept god's blessings from you when that veil was up you couldn't be blessed you can be healed you couldn't be blessed you couldn't have salvation he rent that veil that kept off god's peace man where would we be if we didn't feel god's peace now the veil has been ran into with his own blood he walked a conqueror the battle is over and he proved to us in his resurrection and now the holy ghost is a witness sent to goddess watch what he did and i'm closing watch what he did when he was on earth he conquered and possessed every gate the enemy had the royal seed he promised it by the word he conquered it he conquered the gate of sickness for us that's what he came to do remember sick people he conquered that gate you don't have to conquer it he conquered it the other man had to conquer their own gate but you don't have to conquer it's already conquered he conquered the gates of sickness he conquered the gate of temptation how did he do it by the word he conquered the gate of temptation and the keys was resist the enemy and he'll flee from you he conquered it all he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered death and hell and the grave he conquered because thereof natural seed he conquered the gate of the grave and rose up on the third day for our justification and he says and now we are more than conquerors when that veil was ripped when that veil was torn he not only became the mighty conqueror but he says now you are more than conquerors we just need to walk into it and he says i wish i was twice my size maybe i would feel twice as good let's stand our feet one of the best things i think about the veil being rent was just the very fact that he fully identified himself who he was what he came to do what he came to give the blessings he gave for us none of us are worthy none of us are deserving but it was all because of a man named jesus let's just bow our heads heavenly father we're just so thankful for this day you've given us lord and thankful for a very attentive congregation that pulled on the gift tonight lord and just wanted to hear from you father and we're just thankful lord jesus that you spoken to us tonight lord thinking about this veil that was rent just knowing that that was for us we we talked so much about calvary and salvation and lord we're so dependent upon the calvary and salvation and and the blood that was shed but there's another side of that that that when that veil was torn that barrier that a sinner like myself could come into your presence and accept the salvation except the blood that was shed on calvary and knowing that on the third day you rose again and that you was alive and you became a conqueror to show us that we are more than conquerors we thank you for that lord lord if there's anybody in here tonight that maybe there's something sick that's weary that's maybe battling depression maybe they're fearful of an event that's up up and coming lord may you just send peace down into their heart tonight knowing lord that they can stand in the very presence of the almighty the almighty who heals us of all of our infirmities the almighty who provides all of our needs the jehovah jihad fits a provider for us all and may we stand there knowing as the song says we've been made more than conquerors through that blood and through that veil that was rent we just want to tell you how much we love you tonight lord we ask lord as we go our ways this week and prepare to come back on sunday that you would just constantly deal with our hearts prick our hearts show us where we're our failures our shortcomings so that lord we could find lord jesus that we can come to you father and know that we can be made whole [Music] lord you're so good to us [Music] and words can't express it we love you lord with all of our hearts in jesus name we pray amen let's just sing that little chorus that she's playing we've been made more than conquerors
