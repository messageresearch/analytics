what when fishing's hard whenever you get just one on it's oh my somebody even says it act like he got a jerk back here and by you know everybody knows you do you do you do yeah we got one bite amen i think that well this is birthdays isn't it is this the first sunday yeah this is for sunday you can be seated for a minute amen so anyway we'll get off the fishing story and let's have happy birthdays

april amen brother david is this the channel all right anybody else no amen god is good isn't he god is good we have i feel like i have a real good message from the lord first this morning amen but you know how it is you just want to yield to the holy spirit and see what he'll say amen 40 years well congratulations praise be to god a happy anniversary to you a happy anniversary to you may you be all jesus anniversary to you and the best one you've ever had amen amen god bless you this morning thank you all that'll be all for the music amen this morning let's just amen change the order of service get into the word of god this morning would that be all right amen stand with me i'll tell you what yeah i hope that the lord just anointed the way that he did when he gave this to me amen i don't know just how it will be but i think it was friday night i think it was friday night maybe or thursday night about two o'clock i woke up and i had been praying of course for a message and as i usually do and so then he just began to lay pour something on my heart was up for about an hour probably just trying to you know i was laying on the bed there after i got up and laying there and meditating on the lord and uh he began to just kind of pour it out and i says well you know if you don't get up and write this down you won't remember it for sure you know so i got up and began to write things down and so you just i know that you're praying for me and help for the lord's help amen because this you know being in the place of a minister the more i the older i get i'll say this as the older i get i feel i feel the gift of god in my life i feel that pulling stronger amen it's getting stronger and pulling harder amen it really is because i believe that we're living in a late hour amen and and so i just pray that i can yield myself and meant to god in a greater way that he can use me in a greater way amen but this morning and i know that michael i think hawbaker had that he said told me one time that he kind of wanted to he wished he but i maybe sometime would give my life story amen and this won't be my life story but it is will be a testimony i mean about my life amen and so forth but um we'll just pray and then we'll read the word of god and see what the lord will have for us but as i begin to look at this and study this i realize that we could be here a long time amen because if i wanted to try to say all that i want to say and and the lord began to pour out to me we would be here a while but amen we'll just try not to go you know longer than the holy spirit will have us go but uh i believe that on this easter day i mean you know this is easter day which we say easter but that's the resurrection day amen this is the day that he rose from the dead i mean it was really a big day that right because if he didn't raise from the dead everything he said didn't mean a thing but because it arose from the dead everything that he said meant everything it meant everything and let me tell you something it's true every word of it is true it's the only truth that we have because as you know the world is taking truth and making a lie and they're making a lie taking the lie and making it truth they're switching things around but they can't take this and make it a lie they'll never change this amen oh my so let's just bow our heads father we come before you this morning once again thankful to be able to assemble ourselves together lord and i do feel this morning that this will be a solemn assembly lord jesus a sobering solemn time father for us and and lord jesus we just ask god that is i feel that you've moved upon my heart in this way we ask god that you would just take the meditation of our heart father and the thoughts of our heart lord and father we desire god that you'll have your perfect way in everything that is said and done lord most of all we ask god that you would be the speaker lord jesus and father the gift that you've placed in my heart lord jesus just to be able to get myself out of the way and let you do the speaking father and then lord not just speaking but also to have your presence to come down lord jesus and to anoint both the speaker and the ears of the years lord for we know that outside of your presence lord jesus the word of god will seem like the newspaper that we might pay 25 cents for in the morning but lord when your spirit comes down it makes it alive to us lord jesus and it causes it to live and that's what we truly desire is that that word will live lord in our hearts and in our lives and be real to us and that your resurrection will be real to us father and that that same spirit that raised christ from the dead that it would also quicken our mortals body amen cause us to be alive father lord as i attempt lord jesus just to give a witness and to be a testimony for you this morning we ask god that you to be in everything that is said and done lord and we know that father every person that's in here lord we truly believe that it's been ordained of you this setting is unique father every setting is unique lord and we just ask god for you to have your way now in the name of jesus christ we ask it amen and amen amen turn your bibles if you will to the book of acts and we'll just go to the very scripture that i felt laid on my heart amen when i began to study this amen when it began to come to me amen i certainly have enjoyed the things that the lord has given us you know here lately amen i believe it was wednesday night we spoke of the wages of sin is death isn't that right but the gift of god is eternal life amen and and i think probably everybody here was there for that but the lord just really kind of anointed that thought and amen and give us a real description of what debt how that sin will take us further than what we want to go it'll take keep us longer than what we want to say and it will certainly cost us a whole lot more than what we want to pay amen and so you know and that goes for everybody i mean you know how many knows that people might be able to sin and sin and sin and and disbelieve the word of god you know but eventually at the day of judgment they'll pay and it'll cost them a whole lot more than they would have liked in uh acts the first chapter and we'll just go and i thought you know and i do have a couple of scriptures here that i'd like to perhaps read that has to do with the resurrection and has to do with easter but as i read this scripture i thought well you know this isn't this is really a easter message also so easter scripture amen now in acts 1 the former treaties have i made o theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and to teach unto the until the day in which he was taken up after that he uh through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs amen now keep in mind that jesus has done this very same thing in our generation amen that he has shown himself alive with many infallible proofs amen being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things that pertain to the kingdom of god amen and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they were therefore come together they ask of him saying will thou at this time restore again the kingdom of israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times and the seasons which the father hath put his own in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnessed this unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and unto the other most parts of the earth and when he had spoken these things they have they while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received them out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly towards heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven as i said before i had been one gazing is that right but has seen that i'd have been looking wouldn't you have he says why are you looking so engaging this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven may god add his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning what a powerful scripture amen and you know ever since jesus left even the disciples thought that he would come back any time even they thought that it would be we call this their second his second coming is that right where he comes back amen and for 2 000 years every generation of christians their anticipation their expectation their vision their goal their ambition has been to see him come back amen coming into clouds of glory as many wrong songs amen have been wrote about amen when he comes in the clouds of glory and so forth amen and we're expecting him to return but what i want to take not so much in that aspect this morning amen but i want to start with the eighth verse where he talks about ye shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you amen and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in judea and unto the other most parts of the earth praise be to god god now we know that he told the disciples he told them that they were supposed to go into the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen now let's look at first of all we realize is that i want to talk on i want to call this i am a witness is that okay i am a witness amen and that's what we'll talk about with the help of the lord you know and a witness in the court of law we know that a witness is somebody that they will use as evidence isn't that right a witness can be used as evidence against somebody in other words if somebody testifies hey he did it to me it happened to me i was there i experienced it so in order to be a proper witness you have had to have experienced it praise be to god amen brother tommy wasn't you there whenever that one man was raised from the dead and by the brandon meeting saw it we have this man sitting right here that's seen a man raised from raised from the dead in brother branham's meetings see he's a witness he saw this man here he could tell he already told i love to have lunch with him because he can tell you story after story after story of things that he saw places that he spend and things that he's experienced brother branham's children they can tell you story after story after story of what god has done dear witnesses see it'd be different if everybody was gone but so hundreds of thousands of witnesses and you and i become a witness i believe every christian becomes a witness amen and you know it isn't always about just seeing things hello i mean that was because even thomas he wouldn't believe unless he saw it but even jesus said you know what is better for you not to have seen and still believe amen but this here when it comes to the power of the holy ghost when it comes to talking about the lord when he talks about the salvation is what he really wants us to testify about it's the plan of salvation and what god has done amen now we know that he told them over i believe it in mark he says you know mark 16 he says he says you know afterwards he appeared unto the eleven that sat at meat and operated them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they would not believe on them that had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned amen so salvation is based on faith in god people that believe the gospel amen shall be saved they didn't believe not shall be damned this brings me to my story amen that's what a lot of you know igual de edchikiboda i was born dutch or amish born amongst the amish and you know i have a lot of respect for amish homies folks are some of the best in the world very kind you know and you know but you know in their group it's the same as another group there's good and there's bad you know i was born raised that way and you know i want to say it's good it's a good way to have been raised is that right becky it's a good way to have been raised man we didn't have the soda to pop we didn't have the nintendo game we didn't have the music we wasn't messed up at eight years old like most of them are today huh it's true even the prophet of god he says you know they're very holy they live very holy in other words they have very strict rules and and no unholiness you know but we find out that holiness isn't just about the outward even though it does have to do with what you do and don't do amen of whether you stay clean or not amen but anyway so you know i was that way until i was about 14. i'm not going to go so much on that but i just maybe say it's a good way to have been or to be from amen i don't care if it's amish i don't care if it's mennonite i don't care if it's baptist i don't care what it is we all look back and we realize that in those churches they have certain things they believe and if you're going to be in those churches you have to believe what they believe and if you go beyond that guess what you're in trouble that's where the problem is not which establishment and so forth them but most with all churches they put a period behind what they believe they create offense and god doesn't stay in any of that amen but anyway we'll get into that a little bit later perhaps but let's go on amen and while i was about 14 years old you know most of my my uh you know like i said i can't go into the full depth of it but i know that my dad he had gotten a revelation of the word and he believed the word and he be forget the holy ghost or whatever you know and he began to talk to them about the word and so forth and of course immediately if you uh you know come against him in any way you're going to be sean put in the band and all these other things and and so forth and he was looked down upon him as a result as his kids looked was looked down upon you know and kind of persecuted and and and you know it just didn't like really fit in and of course i think money he was the first one to you know run away from home and so forth him and moe's and and you know they went up in the top of the barn i guess it was and they cut each other's hair and you can imagine what that looked like that was a real mess they decided they didn't want it to be cut hair like that they wanted an english haircut and they ran away from home and of course the police caught him and brought him back home and and you know it was a sight to behold i'll never forget when i was in that a schoolhouse i was in the schoolhouse and they sent them to school and they come down over that over to gravel the road down through there and of course everybody in the school then was all looking out the window here they come here comes them little runaways you know and when they come in they'll thought your hair was still cutting it wasn't right there was no fixing that you know but anyway and so they begin to do that and it wasn't too long after they jumped the fence so to speak that they kind of like fence jumping and they didn't last long they ran away again and so forth but anyway they ended up ended up all of the kids ended up going away from home so forth and i was one of the last ones if i'm i think maybe one more after me but i was one of the very last ones to go amen and my sister placed me in the mennonite home amen because she was men and i and i just lived with a mennonite preacher for a little while amen and and so i think it was a year perhaps uh i was 14 when i left amen 14 years old that's pretty young isn't it i'll never forget the first two weeks i was going i'll tell you what i got homesick and i cried for mom you know i really cried for mom and dad and at home you know how it is but after that two weeks it kind of broke off and i lived with this guy and his preacher of course he was they were pretty much nice to me overall you know but i was a really really backwards guy because if you raise the homies most of the time that's what you're going to be you're going to be pretty backwards you know you don't talk too much you don't have a lot of conversation you're just quiet bashful you know and that's just how i was and i didn't talk too much and and of course he didn't like that too well he wanted me to open up and perhaps get close to me as anyone would but i just didn't really know how to go about all of that but anyway and we did all right i helped him on the farm and so forth and and uh and but he you know he did have a temper and he he boy i'll tell you what he got so mad at once i mean he tried to give me a whooping i was 14 i was pretty stout he didn't quite get it accomplished but anyway so anyway after after a while uh you know i come to the place he'd get upset and get mad you know finally brother moani you know he was he was already english and laying block and doing masonry work and so one morning i decided i don't think this is for me so i packed my bags and while he was down there milking the cows i went in the house dropped my bags out of whatever belongings i had dropped the doctor when the graft and then went up through the woods i went i don't think i could even i don't think i even knew how to find delton i don't know how y'all know that and anyway i was you know but i was up through the woods up through the field and i found my brother at 16 years old he got me a job hello mixing mud wheeling wheelbarrows carrying brick laboring hard keeping them guys supplied and i worked hard and many a days i would have to mix black mud with the mortar i'd come with that stuff i was a black man for the red end of that day you know but worked hard and i learned to work hard and i think by 16 or 16 and a half and then i met some other buddies and i just went out into the world amen and uh you know live with my brother and so forth and of course you know uh you you just once you get out of that and you're free you feel like you're free right and so the scripture came to me i want to read uh i'll read you a scripture of of the first status of how i felt like i was and it certainly was that way and i think i read it uh last wednesday and so you know it was it was here and i like i said i began to live with my brother for a little while and while i was with my brother before i've got some buddies together we actually got together and rented an apartment or a trailer for ourselves you know it wasn't long before you know you get into sin you get into the things of the world isn't that right whether it's drinking and so forth and smoking and we won't get into that because none of that is anything that is to be proud of in that right but uh you know because i'll tell you what if you have a christian parents that raise you in the nurturing admonition of god and you can just fall right into it and you can get into the baptism of the holy ghost and give your life to god that you just save yourselves a whole lot of trouble because i still have to hard times once in a while some song will pop into my head that i gotta resist get out of here because the flesh might like it if flesh likes that rock and roll but the spirit don't hey you gotta block that out but yet that's so engraved because of those years that i spend listening to those things amen and it affects you and you if you don't have that trouble you're a blessed person but you know paul said you know that when we were in sin and we were he says i speak after the man and this is in romans 6 and verse 19. i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh and as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity and to iniquity and that's the way i was living now i was going to live in the flesh i was going to sin i was going to do whatever i wanted to do and i did everything i wanted to do huh and let me tell you something i'm still doing everything i want to do i'm a christian and i do everything i want to do because those things are different now my appetite is different i want to do different things and folks if you if you're doing something because you feel like you have to you haven't got it like you should have it yet no it'll give you a desire blessed are those that hunger and thirst after righteousness but anyway unto iniquity even so now paul says yield your members as servants unto righteousness unto holiness for when ye were servants of sin you were free from righteousness now let me know that sin has a certain amount of pleasure there is a certain amount of pleasure even moses he says you know he pursued the pleasures of egypt isn't that right the pleasures that he could have had sin is beautiful sin may be very pleasurable but let me tell you sin will leave you empty inside it will leave you dead the only real thrill that it has is what it can give your body because it'll leave you with no spirit in here amen but i was that way i was to wear you know and like i said it started with the johnny cash i fell into the ring of fire and that right i went down and the flames went higher well thank god he saved me from the flames praise be to god but he went from one thing to another all the way to ac dc and that inhale and as hard as you could get you know and you know in my time you know if you perhaps shot up with a needle or something and maybe maybe with some kind of i don't know what it was but i only shot with a needle one time and it certainly certainly made you feel good in that out but you know we have here people to this morning that went into this crack cocaine and what they have nowadays was is way stronger than what i experienced my time amen and it has a lot stronger hold on you it is a lot worse for you if you survive it you're a blessed person isn't that right and i thank god they didn't have that stuff back then in my day amen because what i had was bad enough but anyway notice here it says you know we were free from righteousness paul says when you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness and what fruit had ye then indo things where you are now ashamed that's right those things are shame how many believes that amen like the bible says you know we did those things people do things things in darkness that you don't even want to talk about that it is a shame to even speak of some of those things that we did amen but you know you think about that he says for the end of those things is death amen but now being free but now being made free from sin we become servants of god ye have your fruit unto righteousness and the end everlasting life the one thing i liked about my youth the one thing i liked about the freedom that i thought i had is man i could just i thought i was living huh like brother bam talked about when he went in a hotel room and seen all of those women going are half naked and everything else you know and and they thought they were having a good time they thought this is life it's not really life he might think that it's life but it's not life it's death amen i mean it's death because we have a tendency you know if you've been bound up real tight all your life you have a tendency to go plumb way out there let me tell you something where there's a lot of churches that ain't christian that are not really right the world isn't right either it's going to the same place a lot of churches a lot of church folks are going yellow but i'm thankful that god has provided us a way he has got us made his way so i was the servant of sin amen lived and i thought you know but you know whether you was alcohol whether it was drugs whether it was girls and whatever you wanted to do and all of those things at the end of the day the next morning it would leave you with a headache and totally empty inside the only thing you had to look forward to was another budweiser at the end of the day to try to make you feel a little better and it never did make you feel feel good now i remember working when i was still up in ohio before i moved down to still work in ohio there amen and i i was working with a christian young man and he tried to lead me to the lord he tried to testify to me you know later in my sermon i will talk to you about how that jesus says no man can come to me except my father draw him i've got good news and i got bad news for you this morning bad news is you're not coming unless god draws you you're not coming to jesus unless god draws you you won't have no desire to there's a lot of people have no desire i don't want nothing to do with religion i don't want nothing to do with god if you're in that place you're in a sad place because you're blessed amen if god knocks on your door and i thank god that later on amen later on that changed for me that changed for me even though that boy tried to leave me the lord and i didn't want nothing to do if anything i was going to make fun of it or whatever i didn't want nothing to do with it didn't really want anything to do with the lord or anything like that amen and i ended up my brother moved to florida because there was work down there there was masonry work a lot of masonry work back in the 80s building condominiums and so forth so we went down there and worked down there for a while once again living in sin for about the thank you i'm so thankful though god by the grace of god it was from 17 18 19 20 no more than about four years before god got a hold of me amen before something began to move in my heart amen but you know you thought you know i thought boy this you know i just want to live i love life the bible says if he that will love life and if you want to see good days let his tongue refrain from evil and a true that which is evil amen how many knows who doesn't but want to live everybody like being alive i like living i like the life that god has given you how many knows each and everyone in here this morning if you are alive this morning you have been chosen by god because in the conception between your mom and dad there could have been a million others that he could have chose for the conceived could have been red head could have been black it could have been could have been any of that but we know that through that there is a predestinated one that ends up being conceived amen and we are chosen alive god chooses us to life you know right chooses us alive amen and i begin to it means something begin to pull me and you know you might think well i began to seek god i found out that it wasn't me seeking god if it was me i didn't want nothing to do with it but god began to draw me he began to knock on my heart's door but you know i had done been amish i had done been mennonite and i had done been all of these others and i looked at all the churches around look everywhere and i began to say well what is right what can you believe what is the truth huh and of course does that begin to multiply in my heart and so forth i made my repentance on my own in the little old trailer that i was living in and say god i want to find you god i want to serve you but i don't know what to do i don't know where to go and i didn't even really want to read my bible at first because of all the confusion that is around it how many know i'll tell you if you're not going to be a christian because of all the hypocrites that are around because of all the false people that are around and you're just never going to be a christian because there's all kinds of stuff all around but there's a real true kernel there there's the real truth there amen praise be to god and something began to draw me some begin to call me not begin to wonder what was the truth and i made my commitment my repentance and i began to then after a bit something said you know pick that bible up and believe it from one end to the other believe all of it you have to believe if you're son of god you have to believe that this is the truth that this is god's word because if you don't believe that you have no real ground to stand on amen now of course i take the scriptures and all of a sudden i found myself in spiritual debates with people talking to this preacher or that group or whatever in minecraft sarasota you know searching for something searching amen and there are some people that come with robes on white robes on and but i was all over them i was like hey y'all tell me what you believe i don't know what to believe you know and they begin to talk a little bit you know and they look down at my shoes that i was wearing and they said you know god will damn you for that you're condemned for that i was like what are they cleaning up my shoes a cow had to die to get that hide and the bible says thou shalt not kill woo well i'm sorry i didn't realize that tell me more i don't want to do anything that god's not happy with you know they didn't have a whole lot to give how many knows if you're going to have you got to have something to give before you can give anything didn't have a whole lot but they said well we're going to be back at the pinecraft park here after a while and so forth later tonight i went back to that park i mean that night i went to find the truth i was hungry i wanted so i went way back there and i didn't see them nowhere cold by god's grace it's that same ramp brother irvin it's boat ramp the philippine creek boat ramp and you you go right down to that ramp you go back in the park and there's a little woods way back in there little trails back there you know and i got down there and later on brothers and sisters i got baptized in the name of jesus christ down in that philippi creek god filled me with the holy ghost anyway we'll get there in a minute is that all right but i went back there i found them back there you know and they were worried about finding a laundry mat this side or the other i got there to talking about them i wanted to share i wanted to find out what they believed because i wanted god was full of my heart there's got to be a truth somewhere and there i got to be a truth somewhere and uh different stories and i could make a long story but i i i won't go down the full version but listen so i went back there and they they begin to you know when i begin those whole you know they didn't really they didn't really i really don't think they knew what to believe but anyway one of them said something about you got any papers to roll some of that tobacco and i'll tell you right now i figured out right quick i don't care which kind of deback it was i didn't want no part of it because i done that and didn't want to do that anymore i was trying to get away from all that no more wacky tobacco you know no more cigarettes and things like i want to get away from i want to be holy i want my temple to be holy before god am i right but i searched and i looked then one day one day there in minecraft amen i met john steeman pastor of that church down there and uh also sam golden they were out there witnessing the ivan brother irvin they was there ivan was there and different ones were there and they were over there and i think it was david miller and and i i was over here by the uh the fruit market and over here was the saw shop the sauce up where where they sharpened songs and things and they were over there and then brothers were clean cut you know and they were just as testifying as this boy and i looked over there and something said in my heart now there's some real brothers they're some real brothers so i went over there and i tested them with the same scripture that i had tested everybody else with where the bible says he that is born of god does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him he that sinneth is of the devil and so forth you know and that unbelief we know that that sin is the unbelief to disbelieve the word of god is sin you'll go to hell you will burn in hell for one thing alone and that is not to believe what god said that's good enough that's all you have to do is not believe what god said he that believeth not go preach the gospel he that believeth and he's baptized shall be saved he'd believe in that shall be down pretty simple all these other things that people do are attributes because they don't believe amen so that i i brought that out wednesday talking about the whole world it'll be condemned all god has to ask on the day of judgment did you believe what i said did you believe what i said all right there's europe what did the bible say if he believeth not shall be damned off into the lake of fire you go that's all he has to do because he listen what he did on calvary what he did on this weekend for us hello it was the secret to the whole mystery of the gospel oh my the whole gospel i'd love to get into it for a minute maybe i will but what is to preach the gospel to preach the gospel is to tell the story the mystery that has been hid from ages and from generations paul said in colossians 3 i believe it is has now been made known unto the church what is the mystery of god what is the real mystery of it all and how how all of creation everything it's all been made known how did god would allow us to get into a sinful state how that eve would fall and how that we would get to where we are actually born in sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking like we were born in sin we didn't have a chance god knew all of that before there was even one star thus created he knew exactly how it would all be he knew who would have that seed on the inside of them that god would call didn't i i told you i had good news and bad news i haven't given you the good news yet the bad news is that you can't come unless the father draws you no man can't come unto me except my father draw him let me just read that scripture would that be okay i've got it here gonna take our time this morning is that okay i believe it's in saint john all right saint john they were asking him they said in verse 42 of verse chapter 6 is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he said i came down from heaven in other words he had to say i had come from god and i go back to god and so forth you know oh my jesus therefore answered and said unto them why murmur not amongst yourselves now he's going to get real strong he's going to get real strong they can't believe that he came from heaven because we know his mom and dad and do you realize most of the time the bible says that a prophet or a person of god is usually not accepted they are usually accepted except for by those of their kin folks and in their own country usually that's the people that reject what god sends them and so then he says to them no man can come unto me except the father which has sent me draw him i can preach all morning we can read the word of god and everything else but you know unless god draws you that's right it's going to be nothing to you i was at that place i was at that place in my youth whenever trying my tried to witness to me i was like you know i just didn't have no drawing i had no interest huh and it's not a good place folks i thank god that he didn't take me in all of those for those bikes that i was riding around and driving around illegally and dodging cars and flying through graveyards and trying to miss the tombstones instead of bashing my head into one of them or you know coming up the stop sign and it's wet roads and i can't stop and i gotta go take the ditch and almost take my head off on the guide wire on the telephone poles and everything else brother tommy i'm glad to be alive aren't you thank god that he spared us during those times amen no desire but you know i'm thankful that god began to fordraw me amen but listen so he said no man can come except my father and i will raise him up at the last day are you ready for the good news the good news is that he says in the same chapter a little bit earlier he says in verse 35 and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst that life that i was thirsting for it just wasn't in budweiser it just wasn't in drugs it wasn't in pleasure it wasn't you know how many knows it would never satisfied those things never satisfy well i'll give me a husband and i'll be happy no you won't i'll give me a wife and i no you won't there's only one thing that'll really ever satisfy a son and daughter of god and that is jesus christ the baptism of the holy ghost that's the only thing that'll ever satisfy that's not really where i was going but let me go on but i say unto you that you also have seen and believe not all the father hath giveth me shall come to me hallelujah how many believes all that the father hath given him that he has predestinated and knew before the foundation of the world that they would comment that they would have a desire in their heart all that the father will come will come to me folks i wish i had wings to fly to think that i was one of those that he knew would come you will come if you're god's child you will come listen let me let me read this wrong for just a second second and all that he has given me i should lose some of them folks i'm one that believes that when god saves you at 20 years old at 59 you're still going to be saved he holds you it's for time and eternity there's a lot of people that just get a taste of it just a little bit just enough just to make them more hungry or whatever it is but if you ever get really genuinely born again it is not something you did in the first place it's something that god did in you thing i want to do is live i wanted to live i still want to live and not just live as the world might think but i want to live eternally eternally in one we can't imagine but in a hundred million years from now thomas byler believes that he'll still be alive living in the presence of almighty god and listen folks just as sure as we're sitting here i'm gonna enjoy some beautiful sunshine isn't it beautiful out really nice we get to enjoy it but i'm here to tell you that one of these days the place is gonna be burning it's gonna be on fire not going to be such a good day amen behold the day cometh both cruel amen their elements shall the heavens shall be on fire and the elements shall melt with fervent heat all that do wickedly shall be ashes under the soles of your feet when i was still out in the world living in sin i look at the sun and look at the clouds that look around and i'd realize you know that sun just don't make a perfect circle by itself every time the seasons all of these things they just don't do that by themselves there's got to be a god somewhere god has to be somewhere he's got to be real and i realize you know i may be young now but i have no promise of tomorrow you don't know when you're going to get killed or die and sure maybe you'll get old maybe you'll live to get old but today folks just like from there to now it's just to snap a finger time goes really fast and the holy spirit is beginning to make me realize hey you know we're so temporal here this is just a temporary place that we are and it's like we are on uh in the water we're like it's like we're in the water heading carts and niagara falls all right and maybe maybe we can just hear it just a little bit a little bit of a [Music] way up ahead you hear a roar like huh [Music] you're not going to live forever folks you're going to come to the judgment you're going to come to the place where you'll give an account for everything you've ever done there's something in your soul says there's got to be a way there's got to be a way that i don't have to be condemned there's hellfire waiting that we've been preached to for a long time how about how that you know every man who's going to stand before god and give an account for what he's done is that right and they got to begin to pull on me and i begin to say god help me show me what's true and let me go on with my testimony and then we'll get into some of these things but you know i met those brothers and i went over there and i tested them with the with the word of god and and they begin to say that's exactly right brother tom that's exactly right tom i believe that if the bible says it's the truth how many believers i don't matter if you understand the bible's the truth anyway and they begin to tell me you know that's right you know and he just began to talk about the antichrist system and the mark of the beast is coming in and how the america is going to get in the financial bind and how that catholics are going to pay off the debt you know we i don't know maybe it's already done i don't know but we got to borrow all these trillions of dollars from somebody isn't that right just as sure as we're sitting here folks it's happening and it's going to happen we're here this morning that's why i say a solemn assembly because we search and we look at our souls and whether you're going to live or whether you want to become extinct because that's exactly what's going to happen and you can't come you can't have eternal life outside of jesus christ outside of the baptism of the holy ghost and the new birth and the new birth is much more simple than what people figure but here i go let me pick that up a minute again so i talk to the brothers i begin to they begin to challenge me they begin to talk about all these things you know and then they tell me you know the bible says in malachi 4 you know that before the great and dreadful day of the lord that god's going to send us a prophet that he's send a prophet and he'll turn our hearts back to the fathers again amen and i says well i don't know about that people get awful scary and he came and jesus christ they began to tell me how that jesus christ in his ministry would come and he would do this very same messiah sign as what he did when he was here on the earth he would discern the thoughts and tense of the people's heart and that woman when he did that to her heart he says you've had five husbands and the one you're living with now at yours she ran into the city and said isn't this the messiah come see a man who has told me everything i've ever done isn't this the messiah and it says that the people believed on the lord because of her testimony do you realize that the human beings we as human beings we tend to be hard-headed we tend not to believe it's hard for god to get us to believe even his disciples let me i'll pick up my story with the help of the lord in a minute but let's talk about just how hard it seems to be for people to believe god because for one thing we know that he does it always in such simplicity that if you ever find jesus remember you're gonna find him in some humble little person you're going to find him in whatever is humble and most of the time it's going to be called the elzebab but we all in every generation comes to the place where you got to decide whether he's beelzebub or like pilate says what do you want me to do with this man called christ everybody has to decide what you're going to do with this jesus christ amen let's look at how humanity and how that we can be so hard-headed it's in mark this has to do with the resurrection and when jesus was early in the first day of risen early in the first day of the week he appeared first unto mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils so mary was the first one to see jesus after he was resurrected and when she came and told them that he had been that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believe not huh how would you like to have a friend come say i saw him he's alive i don't believe you thomas was that way that's why my name has such a reproach on it because outing thomas he called him i just wouldn't believe well i wasn't the only one doubter well me or thomas this thomas wasn't the only doubter amen and afterwards he appeared in another form unto two of them and the bible talks about those two disciples coming from the road of emmaus remember and he talked to him and he did something that he had done before and they knew that it was him because of him doing something that he had done before see in this generation brother branham amen he preached he would preach the messages you know just like that and on that how that he had done something he had done before and they believed him but now jesus comes in our generation does exactly what he did when he was alive here on earth to prove that he is alive how many knows that's what the message is all about it's about showing to the world that he's alive when he was in front of india hindu and the 500 000 people he challenged all them priests he says you know if your god can open this blind man's eyes up i'll come and believe believe you whoever can do it i'll believe your religion huh i'm following religion but he says i can't do it either but jesus christ who i represent who rose 2 000 years ago he's here if he don't raise if he don't open this blind man's eyes you run me out of town and call me i put a sign on my back false prophet but if he'll open his eyes will you receive him amen they all said yes amen and i'll tell you what god opened that blind man's eyes to prove that he was risen take a moment see we're living the hour folks when the whole world is in darkness the bible says there'll be a day that's neither dark nor light i believe it's an amos but in the evening time it shall be light in that in the evening time god will come and he will show himself a life like he was two thousand he had done it in 2000 years but here jesus comes again amen in the prophet of malachi 4 and he began discerning the thoughts in the states of the heart and people it's so hard for them to believe it that they do what dude let me tell you what they do and afterwards she appeared into the form of two another form and to the two of them as they walk and went to the country and they went and told it to the residue and they didn't believe it you tell but jesus is risen you tell him that he's not in the churches anymore that he has come out amen they they absolutely had him they absolutely crucified him afresh and put him in the opener shape but about where do you find that jesus isn't even in the churches anymore well we all know that most of the churches that we go to you can't be a real christian they won't accept they'll put you out if you're a real christian you must speak in tongues or prophesy in some skirts churches if you want to clap your hands and shout a little or say amen come on and even the pentecostals remember even the pentecostals in 1963 got to the place even though they had sponsored and believed and come to the meetings where jesus christ was coming and discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart it got to the place because that the prophet said denominationalism and churchianity like that is the mark of the beast it'll come to where if you belong to one of them you have taken the mark of the beast it might have been okay in day just passed to kind of not for sure know but now we know for sure jesus has come and he has vindicated and proved himself now our sins open i don't know not without abuse anymore and to disbelieve after god shows himself like that is absolute sin it's unbelief okay now notice told to the rest and they didn't believe him either i'm dumping around too much i said show me where he's outside of the churches see those stars look at those stars look at the church ages okay in revelations 1 and verse chapter 1 verse 20 20 it says the mystery of the seven stars which thou saws in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou saw us are the seven churches and he goes to talking about all these different churches and so forth and that we know that by the revelation the prophet that that was the last two thousand years we have lived out each one of those ages in other words when brother bennett preached his message of the seven church ages when he was there after he preached him had brought out the attended the angel of the lord i don't know if tommy was there or not but he could tell you about it people that was actually there an angel of lord came like into the back of the church i believe it was and you know it he said the back of the church i guess it would have been back there i don't know but listen it says and the angel came and drawed it out supernaturally exactly like that it was that's how much god proved that that was the truth amen but we find in the last church age okay the layout is your church age they were rich they were increased with goods they didn't think they had needed nothing people's going to go do what they want to do how they want to do it they think they got everything but the bible says they're wretched miserable poor blind and naked and they don't know it homosexuality is endorsed anymore in our churches it's the cage of every unclean spirit and a foul bird oh my and you how does this tie in with your testimony brother see i didn't know what was right i come to find out later that these churches and so forth are actually full of unclean and hateful birds the way i the only way you'll really find christ is to come out of it get out of there get out of there why i'll show you what in verse 20 it says behold this is the only place that he ever says to any of the churches i stand at your door and knock jesus was outside the churches knocking trying to get in and i believe this was fulfilled in around 1963 when they wouldn't even allow their members to come to brother bannon's meetings again where jesus would come down after he would preach he would discern the thoughts and tense of people would get healed blind would be open and receive their site miracle after miracle and they would absolutely excommunicate somebody that would participate in it they put him outside now he's outside trying to get back in but he doesn't get into churches again and they don't let him they have never let him in now he's knocking on people's hearts door how many know that jesus loves you this morning let me tell you something you may not have a friend in the world because i when after i got saved after i come and i talk to those brothers and i actually come to begin to uh you know you know they showed me acts 2 38 the real way to get born again you know because it says in acts 2 that they were pricked in their hearts the men of israel said to peter them he did that they were pricked in their hearts and said what must i do to be saved and peter said repent everyone of you and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the holy ghost the promise is to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as our lord our god shall call see that's the true plan of salvation some churches will have you you know and i was when i was men and i thought i became a church a member of the mennonite church and i had to go to uh because instruction class what they called for six months i didn't read that in the bible the way the true way of salvation is for you to accept the word of god in your seat right where you sit like cornelius in his house when peter coming he preached to them it says while he yet spake these words the holy ghost fell upon them amen and then peter says i command you get baptized if you get the baptism the holy ghost on your heart i command you this morning you better get baptized in the name of jesus christ for there's no other name given under everywhere by you must be saved and how many more how many people came to christ that day over 3 000 people come to christ on the day of pentecost why because they accepted it instantaneously oh my how many believes we don't have church memberships the only church membership our prophet brought us was according to first corinthians by one spirit are we all baptized into one body and members in particular praise god how many knows that's the only way you really come into the body of christ is through the baptism of the holy ghost amen but notice here he was standing outside of the door knocking trying to get him come in a minute and i believe that jesus loves he the only reason we're still here is because still i believe that jesus is calling just like he called me like he called you and i you know i'm gonna make a couple more points this morning after i did get baptized that says look if that's the way you're supposed to be baptized if you're supposed to re accept the lord that way and i didn't understand about a prophet and all of that i kind of had to begin to listen to the tapes and so forth because if you'll remember the angel of the lord told the prophet you you store up those tapes you record those tapes but because in a later hour it's what's going to sustain you'll have food later on so that we could actually feed on it otherwise every one of us would look like them people out there we'd all be having perhaps earrings and all kinds of tattoos looked like the world we'd be lost if it wouldn't have been for what god did and the food that he stored up aren't you thankful for the food he stored up amen so i began to get baptized and i went down to philippi creek got baptized amen come up out of the creek and i was there on the banks and something happened very special i don't know how much of the holy spirit i had before that but i'll tell you what philippi creek is a slow running creek it goes real slow real slow and me and brother john he went and baptized me in the name of jesus christ i come back up and prayed i come up out of there and i sit there and i thought i was just going to float away all my sins all my cares all my wicked doings all washed away folks if you don't know the washing power of the lord jesus christ you don't know nothing he can wash every stain away put it in the sea of his forgetfulness aren't you glad for that and afterwards after i got the baptism in the holy ghost i was saved i love the lord i was such a peaceful feeling my buddies i think it was brother ivan and different ones they gathered over at the saw shop because that's where we'd hang out as young folks we'd hang out we'd get together birds of a feather flock together isn't that right well my feathers are changed better dad they really changed i got a bag of oranges like i went over there and they were like hey tom there have a bud i'm like nah i don't drink anymore no i got saved praise be to god here let's eat some oranges from my daughter i lost all my friends in the next three minutes oh my friends jumped in the car they got out of there yeah from the one telling everybody let's go party let's go do that and you know i became let's have some oranges and praise god praise goodness they don't want me no more living i was there by myself by myself i'm gonna do now you might not have any world friends but you'll have a friend that meant more to me than all the worldly friends i ever had because you've got a friend in jesus he'll stick with you through all eternity i'm a witness this morning brothers and sisters that god can change your life forever he can give you eternal life and that ghostly scary feeling in your life of condemnation and damnation you don't have to fear ferret anymore you don't have to be afraid why because he throws a life line in grab hold of this lifeline and you grab all over that lifeline right i gotta worry about it no more the day of god comes both cool and very vicious it's gonna be a horrible thing on the day of the lord but you don't have to fear judgment because paul said the saints will come the saints shall judge the world daniel said he comes with ten thousands of his sakes to judge the world we're there with christ when the ju when the world gets judged paul said you know and even jesus says there is now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit we've passed from death unto life and there's no judgment there's no condemnation to the believer why because you ever really stood the wrath of god jesus when he was died when he died last friday so to speak when he died on friday and when he was crucified that was god's wrath being poured out upon him and it should have been poured out on you and me the judgment of almighty god for our sins and he took our judgment for us we don't have to worry about that horrible sound that lonely feeling and that scary feeling of being condemned one of these days you don't have to feel that you can have peace jesus says i come to give you peace not like the world gives and jesus said come unto me all ye who are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest there's no church should give you that not this church can't give you that only jesus christ can give you that rest and that satisfying drink that you'll drink from him and you'll never thirst again you'll never want to smoke and do all those things again you won't want to live for the world the only thing that you really care about after you get born again is doing what jesus said if you love me keep my commandments amen the commandments don't save you keeping the law don't save you but it shows that you love him amen the other thing about it when you come to the lord like i did when you come to the lord jesus christ i didn't go over there to my friends and say well now i just i don't want to tell you why but i can't do it i don't tell you why i don't want to drink but i want to do it now this is how i felt let me see if i can end it here in mark 8 and verse 34 whosoever will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow him when you come to the lord you've got to be willing to forsake all when you come to the lord you can't worry about what mama daddy well if i come to the lord jesus my husband won't like me my wife won't like me for my boss it might fire me huh you can't worry about anybody else when you come to the lord jesus christ and you even got to die to yourself and i remember when i gave my heart to god i said lord jesus wherever you want me to go whatever you want me to do i'm willing to do it because that's what it takes for god to really be able to take you a complete sacrifice whosoever will save his life amen you want to do things your way yeah you can do it your way you can do whatever you want to do however you want to do it however long you want to do it but if you have that life you're going to lose it you'll come to an end but whosoever will lose his life for my sake in the gospels the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose your own soul how many beliefs that's what we're here about this morning that's why we assemble this god what about my soul what about the you my brother our prophet went beyond the curtain of time god picked him up he's seen all the saints he's seen them all huh how many believes in there paul is gathered with his group irenaeus is gathered with his group their body may be in the grave some of them are eaten by lions many of them are burnt at the stake all those people their bodies are all gone but their soul is alive forever that's what we're concerned about this morning how is your soul where where will you spend eternity amen so i know notice here let's get to the point and lose his own soul or what will it give man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous generation amen of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father and all the holy angels one thing i'm not ashamed of never will be any that's why i proclaim the message they are because it isn't just about a man not just about a part but it's actually jesus christ that came and showed himself alive after 2 000 years and going down through the dark ages catholicism almost had it all swallowed up they even burnt books you couldn't read you can do anything unless you was a catholic amen in this 1400s martin luther broke free and he says no i don't have to pay for my sins the just shall live by faith and he hacked the thesis on the wall and we had a reformation amen and we began to come out and believe the bible again and so forth in that right and here we are being able to believe the full word and not just a full word but in the midst of a place in the world where there's so many different ways god comes and he proves it with signs and infallible proofs that it's the truth and most of all the thing that makes it so infallible is it's 100 according to the word of god it doesn't matter whether it's salvation baptism or whatever it might be it's all exactly the word of god and jesus commonly proved it he proved it over in africa he proved it in india proved it to 70 america went about 70 preachers here in america well known well renowned ministers that wanted to question brother branham on serpent seed in the godhead and so forth amen and then brother bannon was shown a vision of who would sit where and all of these other things and he told the brother amen he says you're not going to have the room that you think that you're going to have but there's going to be a certain person a certain and if that be exactly how it was they had that meeting and and and that brother come up he says now you might question about the ban doctrine and so forth but i'll tell you this one thing he told me that person would be sitting there that we wouldn't have that room long before we didn't even have it huh and brother baby says you know you come up and show me where the baptism is wrong or the godhead is wrong or these things and stand by my side because the angel of lord had told him come go ahead go and talk to him he says it's trap set for you but i'll be with you i'll be by your side by his right side amen but abram says you know the angel of the lord he believed that he would have struck him dead if they had come forward but it was a quiet bunch let me tell you something we have arisen corrupt we have arisen resurrected jesus christ thank the lord for it we can know what's right we can know the direction that we're going amen i'm so thankful for that oh i'm so thankful for that aren't you i'm not ashamed of the gospel i want to be a witness i want to testify that's what a witness does right he testifies of what god has done that god still calls god is still drawing oh god help us this morning i pray there's something in our hearts that want to say that's what i want brother bob i want jesus in my heart i want him like you have him that'll hold you through every kind of trial all kinds of tests amen for 40 50 years and he still takes you right through still cares about you he cares about the food on your table he cares about your welfare he cares about your future he cares about your happiness he cares so much he cares more than we realize that he cares about us but the question is do you care i couldn't comfortably call but folks i don't care where it is when he calls you answer when he calls when he knocks on your heart's door you make sure that you answer the call that's god bless you let's stand this morning amen that's how i got saved the lord has helped me for all these years through all these things and i'm a witness this morning to the grace of almighty god he can take the vile sinner he can set you free he can give you a song in your heart doesn't matter if you're driving down the road if you're working whatever you are he'll put a melody in your heart and you don't have to fear death you don't have to fear anything as long as he's with you with our heads bowed this morning i trust everyone in here knows the grace of god knows what it's like to have a personal experience with the lord jesus christ don't be ashamed don't make excuses i began to try to testify to everybody i could everywhere i went i'd have a bible under my hand trying to tell everybody about the grace of god that you don't have to do those things of the world you don't have to look for joy somewhere else it's right here it was part of the whole plan of salvation the gospel that jesus christ came that he died for you that he rose again that he's willing to forgive you of all your sins and all your failures if you'll just turn your life over to him play something just as i am without one plea perhaps play something softly right now i want you to listen listen to the holy spirit if he is drawing you if he's pulling you young or old it doesn't matter who you are maybe it's a backslider this morning maybe you're far away from god but you don't want to step out you don't want to come to the altar and give your heart to god because listen this is what god and his minister has been doing for the last two thousand years he's been calling his children to himself if you know where you ought to be don't be ashamed step out if you're not where you ought to be and say i want to come to jesus this morning i feel the pull i feel the call amen maybe a rededication may be a sinner never give his heart to god folks we'll come back this afternoon we'll fill the fill the water baptism up if you want to get baptized in jesus name doesn't matter what it is this is our chance this is our call this morning i hope that god is calling i hope god is drawing amen say honest step i want everybody to know that i want to give my life to god most of all i want to come and i just want to throw my life down before him here i am lord i lay it before you father take me lord jesus and use me however you can lord jesus we come before you now god and we just ask god if there's anyone out there that's not what they ought to be lord if there's any sinners out there that don't know that you have been drawing them that is you are pulling them the father is drawing them to you lord the holy spirit is there tugging at the heart lord jesus don't let them leave this place but what they have given their heart to god this morning god bless you god bless you lord jesus you see one here at the altar he truly wants to love you with all of his heart he wants to give all of his life to you and i pray god this morning that you would grant him lord the forgiveness of his sins that he be washed white in the blood of the lamb and lord did you make him a real man of god who knows what the future will hold for him and what you'll do and how you will work work and use him for your kingdom lord we ask god to choose to work in each and every one of us and father as i have just tried to share my testimony a little this morning father to encourage somebody else lord jesus that you're real that you're still alive that you're still touching people's hearts you're still knocking on people's doors you're still saying come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden you've tried everything else and it doesn't satisfy the lord jesus i just pray god touch every heart this morning in a special way and we do want to thank you for this easter morning god this resurrection morning lord jesus even as i and god have witnessed lord jesus that i truly believe you've done a work in my life lord i'm a witness of the power of god one of these days i want to witness lord jesus a resurrection take place our loved ones coming forth the rapture taking place i do not want to be a witness of the tribulation period and when your wrath is poured apart on the earth and all those that do not believe and do not receive who reject your mercy the lord i want to experience and i want to be a witness
