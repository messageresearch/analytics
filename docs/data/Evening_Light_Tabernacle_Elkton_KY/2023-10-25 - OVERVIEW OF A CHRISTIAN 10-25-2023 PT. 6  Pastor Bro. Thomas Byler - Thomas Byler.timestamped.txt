[35:12] physician Lord that we just pray God
[35:15] that you would take Lord Jesus and
[35:17] father Lord as you know father exactly
[35:20] what is wrong with us Lord that you
[35:22] would bring Lord the antidote so to
[35:24] speak father and that the medicine that
[35:26] we would re receive would give us the
[35:27] cure for what we have need of to make us
[35:30] the kind of people that we should be
[35:31] Lord father we ask God that you just
[35:34] bless the meditation of our heart that
[35:35] which we feel you've laid upon the heart
[35:37] to speak now in Jesus Christ's name
[35:41] amen amen praise the Lord
[35:49] amen all
[35:51] right let's turn our bibles if you will
[35:54] to the book of
[35:57] um let me see which one I wanted to go
[36:00] to
[36:02] First amen and I believe it
[36:05] [Applause]
[36:07] was first Timothy First
[36:12] Timothy put this down a little bit like
[36:15] okay amen I know when I adjust it they
[36:17] have to adjust it so we want to try to
[36:19] let them
[36:24] know first Timothy
[36:33] amen First Timothy
[36:39] 6 and verse 12 1 Timothy 6 and
[36:46] 12 and then also second
[36:50] Timothy 4 and
[36:53] 7 says fight the good fight of faith
[36:57] lay hold on eternal life where unto thou
[37:00] W also called and H has professed a good
[37:03] profession before many witnesses second
[37:06] Timothy 4 and verse 7 it says it this
[37:10] way second Timothy
[37:15] 4 and verse 7 I have fought a good fight
[37:19] I have finished my course I have kept
[37:22] the faith henceforth there is laid up
[37:24] for me a crown of righteousness which
[37:26] the Lord Lord the righteous judge shall
[37:28] give me at that day and not only to me
[37:30] not me only but unto all them that love
[37:33] his appearing may God add His blessings
[37:36] to the reading of the word you can be
[37:38] seated
[37:39] tonight
[37:41] amen so my thought is I'm not sure which
[37:44] part this will be but amen this is going
[37:47] to kind of once again speak about an
[37:50] overview of the Christian amen and I
[37:53] want to speak on two aspects of it with
[37:55] the help of the Lord tonight amen I want
[37:57] to speak on what a Christian isn't and
[38:00] what a Christian is amen amen and so
[38:04] we're going to try to help with the help
[38:05] of the Lord uh just to speak for a
[38:08] little while and and uh try to take it
[38:10] as slow as we can amen and we want to
[38:12] first start with what a Christian isn't
[38:16] amen what a Christian Isn't So praise
[38:20] the
[38:21] Lord amen so I've got several things
[38:23] wrote down here amen and uh I want to
[38:27] start with a quote amen a quote that
[38:30] brother Benham made and then we'll try
[38:32] to get a scripture for it amen certainly
[38:35] he thought Brother Brad did an
[38:37] outstanding job Sunday morning didn't he
[38:39] amen of course he always does so that's
[38:42] nothing new amen really appreciate Amen
[38:45] brother Brad's Ministry amen amen
[38:49] certainly you know and I want to kind of
[38:51] start here from this quote you people
[38:53] here from the Farms many of you know it
[38:56] you can take a hand and you can lay a uh
[38:59] it can lay an egg but if the male bird
[39:01] hasn't been with her it'll never hatch
[39:04] it's not fertile Amen in the old mother
[39:07] bird in the springtime he says the old
[39:09] mother bird can get out and make her a
[39:11] nest and lay a whole nest full of eggs
[39:14] and she can sit on that nest and hover
[39:16] over those eggs and turn them every few
[39:19] minutes and sit there until she gets so
[39:22] poor she can't even fly off the nest and
[39:25] if she hasn't been with the male bird
[39:27] that mate those eggs will never hatch
[39:30] that's right they're rotten right there
[39:31] in the nest that's correct and it
[39:33] reminds me of some old cold formal
[39:35] churches that we got around in Indiana
[39:38] here he says just a nest full of rotten
[39:40] eggs you can Pat them and please them
[39:42] and join them into the church shake
[39:44] their hands and everything else but all
[39:46] you got is a nest full of rotten eggs
[39:49] what we need tonight is men and women
[39:51] with an experience of God that come in
[39:54] contact with the mate of the church
[39:56] Church Jesus Christ has so germanized it
[39:59] by the Holy Ghost amen has got faith to
[40:01] believe the word of the Living
[40:04] God Amen so the one thing the first
[40:07] thing I want to say is that how many
[40:09] believes that a Believe real genuine
[40:11] believer is not amen a
[40:14] unitized seed or AEG they're not a
[40:17] rotten AEG amen where we know that the
[40:21] prophet taught he says you know that if
[40:22] you have an egg amen you can take an egg
[40:25] and you can put it of course an
[40:27] incubator we know that keeps the right
[40:28] temperature all about the warmth and the
[40:31] atmosphere that brings that hat that hat
[40:33] set now I've got a few several
[40:35] incubators myself amen and it has a
[40:37] after so many weeks or whatever amen
[40:39] that incubator will go this way and
[40:41] it'll kind of slowly go that way and
[40:43] they go over this way and over that way
[40:46] I don't know why but I guess I get tired
[40:48] of laying on one side too wouldn't
[40:51] you yeah that's supposed to be funny but
[40:54] anyway yeah you know and and rotates it
[40:57] you know and uh but you know was the
[40:59] atmosphere that does it but notice how
[41:02] that with with with somebody that is
[41:04] unitized without that germ of life amen
[41:08] it doesn't matter how warm it is how
[41:11] long it is
[41:13] warm
[41:15] right it don't matter how good the
[41:17] preacher preaches how many shouts and
[41:20] Hallelujah and praise gods and
[41:22] everything
[41:23] else and then they just sit there amen
[41:26] it really doesn't do anything for
[41:29] him amen but now I want to maybe perhaps
[41:33] with the help of the Lord maybe talk
[41:34] about the other side here in a minute I
[41:36] got two pages one is for the Christian
[41:38] amen and what he is but the Christian
[41:40] amen isn't like that how many knows he's
[41:42] not like that Christian has been with
[41:44] the male bird amen and he uh amen
[41:47] whenever the right temperature comes and
[41:49] brother bam says you know when the light
[41:50] strikes across a real genuine seed of
[41:53] God that seed comes to it quick it
[41:57] hatches so to speak amen how many
[41:59] believe that whenever it comes forth and
[42:02] amen that mother has something to mother
[42:04] it's isn't just sitting there amen and
[42:06] beating its head off and man starving
[42:08] itself to death amen trying to make sure
[42:10] and Curry out go up there I go out there
[42:12] and eat a little bit come back and sit
[42:14] down until my just gets puny amen but
[42:17] that's not how a Believer
[42:19] is
[42:21] amen so in other words it's just
[42:24] something that you can't people amen
[42:26] some people you just can't do anything
[42:29] with and it goes back to genetics isn't
[42:32] that right goes back the seed line
[42:36] amen amen I think it's uh uh 13 let me
[42:40] see in
[42:42] 36 amen I've got a few scripture here
[42:46] amen let's first go
[42:49] to John 3 John 3 and 19 I thought this
[42:54] scripture would go along with with
[42:56] talking about how that
[42:59] um the the emphasis tonight is on the
[43:02] fact that it doesn't matter how much
[43:04] warmth they get or atmosphere they get
[43:08] amen it doesn't do anything for them
[43:11] it's like water off of a duck's
[43:14] pack amen I like what the prophet of God
[43:17] said one place he talks about a
[43:18] Christian like a sponge amen and we just
[43:21] absorb everything that God has for us
[43:24] amen yeah a a a sponge absorbs it that's
[43:28] the way a Christian is he's
[43:30] absorbent amen when we come to the house
[43:32] of God the preachers preaching we try to
[43:35] absorb it right take it in amen and you
[43:38] get as much out of it as what you really
[43:41] want amen it just depends if you're
[43:43] absorbing amen but now we know amen
[43:46] there's those that do not have that seed
[43:48] and not me just before we read this um
[43:52] in John let's just go to the woman at
[43:54] the well the brother B talked about he
[43:56] said she had that germ of life in there
[43:58] didn't she she had that germ of life and
[44:01] when that light struck amen she come to
[44:04] life right quick didn't she amen she
[44:07] went into the City and almost the whole
[44:09] city was converted believed on him
[44:11] because of her report because of what
[44:13] she had said but he said the Pharisees
[44:16] and scribes they weren't that way amen
[44:20] amen and we'll take our uh look here
[44:24] first of all talk about the light
[44:26] shining and so forth and and the
[44:27] atmosphere that is there amen for uh
[44:31] even It Shines on the unbeliever now let
[44:35] me
[44:36] see um St
[44:40] John I mean in Matthew here I've got
[44:43] quite a few scriptures so just bear with
[44:47] me
[44:49] three St John
[44:53] 3 and you know I you could bring this
[44:56] into you know the favorite I guess the
[44:59] golden scripture for God so Lov the
[45:01] world that he gave his only begotten son
[45:03] that whosoever believeth in him should
[45:05] not perish but have everlasting life
[45:09] amen but let's go over to uh verse 19
[45:13] and this is the
[45:15] condemnation am mean this is the
[45:17] condemnation that light is com to the
[45:19] world Amen and Men love Darkness rather
[45:24] than light
[45:26] amen amen because their deeds are evil
[45:31] how many know a Christian loves the
[45:34] atmosphere of God loves amen the
[45:37] atmosphere of the Holy
[45:39] Ghost but not everybody likes that not
[45:42] everybody likes to be called out in
[45:48] church amen that everybody likes the
[45:52] light because their deeds were evil amen
[45:55] amen and everyone that doeth evil hateth
[45:59] the light neither cometh to the light
[46:01] least his deeds should be reproved
[46:05] amen now notice there how it says you
[46:08] know even though God how many knows
[46:10] God's lighten is to whosoever will let
[46:13] him
[46:15] come but there's some bad eggs in the
[46:17] world how many know we have some bad
[46:20] eggs so Topic in the
[46:22] world
[46:23] Amen the next one's going to be John
[46:27] 8:42 a John actually let's go first
[46:30] before we go to John 8 let's go to
[46:32] Matthew 13 Matthew 13 I think this one
[46:35] would be even better into describing why
[46:39] some eggs just don't seem to hatch it
[46:42] just doesn't have any effect on it Ain
[46:45] that right first of all we go back to
[46:47] the mystery back to the mystery of
[46:52] uh things that people just don't even
[46:55] believe it nowadays but it's true
[46:57] nonetheless all
[46:59] right
[47:03] 13 and
[47:05] 36 this is where Jesus had talked about
[47:08] the Harvest uh the swer the enemy that
[47:11] swed them and so forth the wheat and the
[47:13] tears Jesus sent the multitude away and
[47:15] went into the house and his disciples
[47:17] came to him saying declare unto us the
[47:19] parable of the tears in the field amen
[47:23] he answered and said unto them he that
[47:25] soth The Good Seed is the son of man the
[47:28] field is the world and the good seed are
[47:30] the children of the Kingdom but the
[47:32] tears are the children of the wicked one
[47:34] the enemy that sowed them is the devil
[47:38] the Harvest is the end of the world and
[47:39] the reapers are the Angels amen as
[47:43] therefore the tears are gathered and
[47:45] burned into fire so shall it be at the
[47:47] end of this
[47:49] world now this is a scary thing almost
[47:52] for people that don't know God isn't
[47:54] it
[47:56] cuz you know remember one time two
[47:58] people were in brother braham's meetings
[48:00] and brother Bram preached on a buzzard
[48:02] and he preached on an eagle and is that
[48:04] right and one man after service says man
[48:06] he called me a buzzard well that's funny
[48:09] he called me an
[48:10] eagle how many Eagles have we got
[48:12] tonight amen it just depends on which
[48:15] side of the fence you're on just depends
[48:18] whether you're receptive to it or not
[48:20] amen whether you've come to the light to
[48:22] or not
[48:24] amen amen and not only that but it's
[48:27] clearly declares amen where the people
[48:30] amen uh are going to end up at the tears
[48:33] where they going to end up at the son of
[48:35] man shall send forth his angels and they
[48:37] shall GA out of his kingdom all things
[48:40] that offend and them which do iniquity
[48:43] and cast them into a furnace of fire
[48:45] there shall be wailing and nashing of
[48:47] teeth amen then shall the righteous
[48:50] shine forth as the son in the Kingdom of
[48:53] their father who have ears to hear
[48:56] let him hear now we go back to John
[49:01] 8 back to John 8 we want to look at
[49:06] this
[49:08] ineffectiveness of the atmosphere and
[49:10] the word of God to people
[49:13] amen how many's glad that the word of
[49:16] God has had an effect on
[49:20] you it has an effect on you every time
[49:23] you come to church every time you hear
[49:25] amen John 8 we'll begin with verse 42 it
[49:29] says it this
[49:30] way verse 42 it says and and then now he
[49:35] he they were talking about where the
[49:36] children of Abraham and all this all the
[49:38] stuff he said but now they were looking
[49:40] they were trying to kill Jesus in verse
[49:43] 40 but now you seek to kill me a man
[49:45] that has told you the truth which I have
[49:47] heard of God this did not Abraham you do
[49:50] the Deeds of your father then said they
[49:53] to him we be not before for be we be not
[49:57] born of fornication we have one father
[50:00] even God M how many knows just because
[50:04] people are religious just because people
[50:06] believe that God is their father don't
[50:08] make it their
[50:11] father
[50:12] amen oh my we're going to find out just
[50:15] exactly why and who is amen a child of
[50:18] God and who is not a child of do God
[50:21] find out who is Quicken and who has a
[50:23] German in there and who don't have a ger
[50:25] in there now notice Jesus said unto him
[50:29] if God were your father you would love
[50:33] me how many believe that one thing if
[50:35] you're a child of God if you're
[50:37] Christian you're going to love Jesus
[50:40] you're going to love God Amen my sheep
[50:45] hear my voice another they will not
[50:50] follow boy we try to persuade people and
[50:53] encourage people and coax people in into
[50:55] it and sell people you know that all
[50:58] that don't
[50:59] work you just tell them the truth and if
[51:01] they're of God they'll hear it in that
[51:04] comforting brother Brandon B racked his
[51:06] brain he was ready to go off the field
[51:07] people just won't you hear me but he
[51:09] realized hey not all of them supposed to
[51:12] hear it not all of them were he had to
[51:14] come to that realization before he went
[51:17] berserk almost hello man the people just
[51:20] won't hear me I'll just go out and live
[51:21] in the woods huh come out when God wants
[51:25] me

[51:28] people were still it was just running
[51:30] off of people's back like water off of
[51:32] Duck's back amen if God were your father
[51:35] you would love me for I proceeded forth
[51:38] and came from God neither came I of
[51:40] myself but he sent me why do you
[51:43] understand my speech even because you
[51:46] cannot hear my
[51:50] word amen now this is what we're not

[52:14] God W come on folks because if you are
[52:17] of God you will hear God's
[52:21] words amen even because you cannot hear

[52:32] devil amen that's why you never
[52:37] hatched that's why you never come to it

[52:43] because you don't have the germ of God
[52:45] in there The Germ of God in there you
[52:47] come forth just as sure as the
[52:50] world because how many knows God's going
[52:53] to see to it that every one of his
[52:55] children comes forth first forth in new
[52:59] life

[53:22] not how many knows brother baham says
[53:26] evidence of the Holy Ghost is receiving

[53:31] that word or not I don't care if you're
[53:33] sensation tongues whatever you might
[53:34] want to see Faith to move mountains that

[1:02:42] YouTube or not I wanted to I almost
[1:02:44] wanted to show you but there was a
[1:02:45] couple scenes there that were not really
[1:02:47] appropriate amen for the little kids but
[1:02:50] there was a young guy that got on on
[1:02:52] there in the broadcast and he was just
[1:02:53] mocking the other guy's religion just
[1:02:55] hammering Jesus B and he said man he
[1:02:58] ain't never he said they got another
[1:03:00] interview afterwards he says well what I
[1:03:02] said to him he said uh you know he says
[1:03:05] he said well I ain't even I ain't going
[1:03:07] to say I ain't going there again he said
[1:03:09] he had about three weeks where he drank
[1:03:11] I guess he got drinking poisoning he
[1:03:13] almost died he said he was the worst
[1:03:15] nightmare of his whole life when he
[1:03:16] spoke against Jesus Christ he said when

[1:03:21] going to say what I said I don't he said

[1:03:45] their lives many a thousands were
[1:03:48] displaced mudslides that City almost

[1:03:56] a judgment on upon people that do it
[1:03:58] right there and then how much more do

[1:10:53] is against
[1:10:54] you as long as You' got the one that
[1:10:58] counts for you right how many believe
[1:11:02] that I thought that was such a
[1:11:04] revelation God it doesn't matter if the
[1:11:06] whole world's against you as long as
[1:11:08] God's for you not that's another one of
[1:11:10] those thing why wouldn't you want to be

[1:11:15] God's for you it doesn't matter what's
[1:11:17] against you got God on your side amen
[1:11:21] just like Moses when he went to Egypt
[1:11:22] Egypt all of Egypt was against him but
[1:11:25] God was with him me there was a thousand
[1:11:28] Philistines against Samson it didn't
[1:11:30] matter he had God on his side there's
[1:11:33] millions of devils against you but it
[1:11:35] don't matter you got God on your side
[1:11:38] you're a genuine Christian that's what
[1:11:39] it means that's the overview of a
[1:11:41] Christian that's why we ought to be
[1:11:43] happy like we
[1:11:48] are cuz you got God on your
[1:11:52] side don't oh don't not go with me still

[1:12:20] Lord you know you take an old Herford

[1:12:27] turn him out here in the pasture and
[1:12:29] turn their Longhorn out there that
[1:12:31] longhorn can make his own way because
[1:12:35] he's original breed but you take a a
[1:12:38] brangus and or a herfor that's a cross
[1:12:40] breed and a hybrid it's a better car to
[1:12:44] look at sure fattier healthy healthy
[1:12:48] healthier but you turn them out there
[1:12:49] and they can't make their way they'll
[1:12:51] die cuz they got to be babies that's
[1:12:53] what's the matter with the church today
[1:12:55] you got a better dress punch of
[1:12:57] Christians a bigger Church a better
[1:12:58] education a lot of theophany uh theology
[1:13:03] but they have to be babed all the time
[1:13:06] you have to look through their glasses

[1:13:10] we need is some
[1:13:11] Thoroughbred
[1:13:13] Christians I you need some thorough some

[1:13:32] wrong like Paul says we're persecuted
[1:13:35] but not forsaken we're forsaken but as
[1:13:37] long as he don't forsake us we're all
[1:13:39] right cast down all of this stuff that
[1:13:41] Paul's po to Paul it didn't matter he
