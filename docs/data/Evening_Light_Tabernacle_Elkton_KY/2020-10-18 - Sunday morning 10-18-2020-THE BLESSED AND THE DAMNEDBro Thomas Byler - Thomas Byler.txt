[Laughter] all right amen so i know i know i prayed i said lord you know because sometimes you like for the lord to know that he's hearing your prayers and that was what wednesday went missing wednesday and by friday it is happened right today i said lord i said i'm just praying that you'll bring that truck back and just to show you to show me that you hear my prayer i said let it be quick you know and i said well i don't know about you but that sounds quick to me so let's give the lord a hand say thank you lord jesus amen amen god is good isn't he amen god is real amen we'd say that the guy was unlucky but he's just unblessed amen because i'll tell you what he's not blessed amen when the lord comes after you you better watch out isn't that right praise the lord god bless you this morning it's good to be in the house of the lord amen stand with me stand with me and amen let's just bow our heads and go before the lord in prayer we do want to amen uh tell sister jeanette amen that we're praying for her for tuesday for that operation that it'll go good amen we're certainly looking forward to that problem being taken care of amen and so we just pray that god will touch her and heal her in a special way amen amen so praise the lord let's bow our heads kind of heavenly father we come before you lord jesus and we do pray god come to the lord jesus and that you'll be with the physician's hands lord and be every with every portion father and everything that is done lord and they do for sisters and that to take care of our problem lord we ask god we know that your prophet taught us they can cut they can do this that or the other but it takes your healing all healing comes from you lord so we just ask god that you would just help that operation to go really well father and lord we want to thank you lord for all the prayers that you have answered god and for the wonderful god that you are we just can't express in our hearts how much we adore you how much we love you and i praise you lord we just think of that song says oh how i love him how i adore him my breath my sunshine my all in all father you truly are are all in our your everything to us lord jesus and we just want to worship your father this morning in spirit and in truth and we ask god you'll bless everyone lord that's made the effort to be able to come out lord jesus to worship you and those who can't but if steve's not feeling well we ask god you would touch him this morning and just raise him up lord jesus give him strength lord jesus this morning father and lord just bless the congregation that's assembled we ask god that you bless the meditation of our heart now the reading of the word now in jesus christ's name amen and amen i had a little thought on my heart last evening as i was just studying and asking god if what he wanted me to speak on and it just didn't seem like you know something didn't click right off the go gator or whatever and so i went to bed last night and said well lord i'm just leaving it in your hands and then i woke up about a little bit before 12 i guess it was and began to think and uh and and i close my eyes again and all of a sudden just some of these thoughts begin to just come to me like it does whenever the lord seems to give me a message and i says well i wonder what time it is and i opened my eyes my eyes and looked at the clock and it was dead midnight 12 o'clock in midnight when and i felt like the lord gave me a minute i said well what is the significance of midnight amen and so amen it's just i've gotten the messages in many different places many different ways but midnight i mean that was a first so amen i perhaps we're at the midnight hour amen how many knows that uh and it'll certainly be a midnight message but way back in the 50s and the 60s brother bram said that even science and scientists and so forth amen are saying that we're like three minutes before midnight amen how many knows at midnight a cry went out behold the bridegroom comes amen and so it is certainly the hour i believe very timely it'll be this morning amen for the message that we have so if you will turn your bibles to mark if you will amen and it'll just take the lord to really put this together amen but i want to speak out of the book of mark and it's a peculiar message actually kind of different but it's certainly uh i believe that it's what the lord would have amen and the title of it is going to be rather different mark the 16th chapter and i want you to kind of imagine this being read perhaps at the white throne judgment amen because how many knows that this bible is what is going to judge the world god is going to use this bible to judge the world by every soul will be judged by the bible amen so whenever uh you know whenever they they read uh in the courthouses and so forth they'll refer to a certain law on a certain page on a certain area and so forth that's what they'll refer to you know and that i believe in the bible god will use the bible to refer amen to make his judgments he'll use it and isn't it quite something how that in our courthouses how many knows that when the judge comes out amen they always say all rise isn't that right and i truly believe it types the great judgment when jesus christ shall call all out of the grave isn't that right he'll call all to rise amen when the judge comes forth to judge the world amen so you know you just you just think about this here i believe what we're about to read will be the judgment of the world okay mark 16 verse 9 now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believe not after that he appeared in another form unto the two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it to the residue and neither believed they them afterwards he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and operated them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils and they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recall cover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat at the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following everybody said amen may god has blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated my title this morning is the blessed and the damned the blessed and the damned how many believe there's only two kinds amen and when you think about it this certainly is something that uh god could use in the day great day of judgment because he first of all testified that he had risen you know right in this scripture he testified that god had risen from the dead that jesus had risen from the dead amen and he began to talk a little bit about those that heard it and how they were hard-hearted and really didn't want to believe it but yet he appeared to them even those that couldn't believe it he personally appeared to them and abraded them for their hardness of heart in that and then after he did this he commissioned them to go into all the world and to preach the gospel amen how many believe that's happening this morning to all the world to every generation amen all the way from paul in our day during brenda branham's time we know that there'll be a lot of people that say well the days of miracles is past there's no such a thing as the holy ghost anymore it was just for the 12 apostles it was just for this one or for that one but he says you know i'll tell you where he put it in it you show me where he took it out and then where he put it in it it was acts 2 38 they were pricked in their hearts and said men in brethren what shall we do isn't that right he says repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god so call it's going to be good all the way until he leaves that mercy seat amen go and preach the gospel tell them the gospel amen to every creature he that believeth and is baptized amen shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned amen now we're going to use that quite a bit this morning but you know in other words for that damn word could be condemnation and amen now let's go to i'm going to go to saint real quick let's just talk about what the gospel is amen what is the gospel the gospel is that jesus christ died for our sins that jesus christ died and he gave his life so that you and i can have eternal life if you believe that you will be blessed but if you don't believe that and don't accept that there's only one place for you and that's damnation amen how many knows that there's only two locations we're either going into the land of heaven which is the land of the blessed or we're going to hell which is the land of the damned the place of the damned amen what a terrible place for people to go john 3 16. this is the gospel that we're going to preach we're to tell them about how that uh you know in john 3 16 how did god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish they should not be damned but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to damn the world or to condemn the world amen how many know that when you are condemned amen they are damning you to death that's right they're condemning you he came not to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is the name of the only begotten son of god and listen to this and this is the damnation or the condemnation okay that light is come into the world all right and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil my so the condemnation comes with not accepting the light that god sends you away now we know that this word of god this is just the reading of the word just that right there just reading that word either sends your soul to hell or take it to heaven that's all god is obligated to give you his word never that's all he has to give you but god does more don't he he shows signs and wonders he sends prophets does miracles and and signs and wonders to get people's attention to make him know hey this really is true amen try to get the people to believe we know that's what signs are for that's what miracles were done that's why uh in our generation brother bam says you know uh these this gift that god has given me of of telling you who you are where you come from what your problem is and the discernment that god comes and does that's really that's just to build your faith that's just to get you to cause of you to believe that jesus really is here that he is really alive that he has resurrected and showed the world that he has resurrected in this generation then it builds their faith to believe well i believe that then they accept and receive what they have need of so god goes to great extent to try to get us to believe is that right because that's the trick right there that's the magic thing is right there is to believe because if you don't believe just because of the fact that you disbelieve the truth you'll be a blessed people we're blessed i want to go to uh go to matthew now and let's talk about the blessed amen how may believe that come on when we think about it a christian a christian that has accepted the lord and this really has to be thought about telling you know i got some good news and some bad news which one do you want to hurt bless it huh blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven some people have such a proud spirit such a strong spirit oh you can't tell me you know that's a strong spirit that's not a poor spirit that's not a giving spirit but it's a really terrible spirit to have so he says blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven number two verse four once again he says blessed our brother man calls blessed says that blessed means happy right blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted amen another place in the bible it talks about over in john i believe it was he interpreted as he says bro he says woe to them that are full now for they shall be empty amen uh 99 verse 5 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth amen blood how many believe says you're a blessed person blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled the biggest problem today is people do not have a hunger they do not have a thirst you are blessed if you have a hunger and a thirst i've been a christian now for i don't know how many years 30 some odd years the lord has been as good to me until i feel i could need a second person just to fill out and spill up some of the goodness of almighty god but there's still something down on the inside and he says that this world and this life is still not good enough i still want more i want a body that won't get old i want to live in a world where there is no negative there's no bad days and good days i want all good days hello i'm still hungry and i'm self-thirsting there's still something in me that calls for that land beyond the river [Music] anybody with me this morning amen this world is not my home i'm just not content here i love it that i'm here with the lord i'm glad for the comfort of the holy spirit you're a blessed person have you got the comfort of the spirit this morning because the whole world is groping in discomfort this world is totally annoyed people are not happy they don't have a comfort they don't have something to give them a smile but you if you're a christian you're the most blessed person up on the face of the earth our prophet said many times we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth god help us come on folks let's admit it i know you know why we're not as happy as we should i'm gonna just i can say this of the lord the reason we're not as happy as we should be is because we're still too bogged down with the things of this world that's why we're not as happy as what we should be you realize you would probably be happier with less than what you got because we constantly think we got to have more amen it doesn't bring more joy hello this brings you joy knowing where you're going brings you joy knowing who you are brings you joy it brings you peace amen oh my praise the lord blessed are they merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god oh my i should use happy every time happy are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god and happy are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all men are of evil against you for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad hallelujah i don't know about you but if he would have said look if people are persecuting you and if people are hey man dear reviling you and saying bad things about you you could just know one thing you're not on the right path and you need to be very sad if it said it that way if people persecuted me hey man it said bad things i would be like oh boy the bible says i better be sad huh you know the bible actually sells sis the opposite one place he says what one to you when all men speak eat i mean it's good of you huh because so did they the false prophets when you're a false prophet oh you're really a fine guy but you take the height off of people and you tell us how it is and huh didn't like you so well let me tell you something so i mean stephen he preached the gospel to the pharisees until they got so mad they stoned him to death they didn't like him they didn't labor reviled them they hated him they murdered him they persecuted him but when they're persecuted when you suffer because of the righteousness that you're doing amen you fit right in this category and you say well praise be to god i'm on the right path praise be to god that i'm worthy to suffer for the man that suffered for me praise be to god because life christian life is not all joy it's not all uh no tribulation no persecution but it is in the midst of all of that you have the joy and the peace of god in your heart amen praise be to god oh my i don't know why we don't think that you're not blessed how many believes that you're blessed you're a blessed person a person oh my all right that's right rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you you are the salt of the earth praise be to god over in matthew 13 there's some more blessings that comes along with the believer those who accept christ those who receive what he said one place he said amen he says blessed are those who are not offended in my word i mean it means it's a blessing when you're not offended because of something that jesus said any part of the bible when it does not offend you you're a blessed person amen because most of the time a lot of places people are offended because of the word oh it condemns me you're offended no it shouldn't condemn you it should bless you amen and this is a very familiar scripture with us i think i read it last sunday it talks about it talks about isaiah prophesied of these people how did they would have hearing and they shall not hear they shall not underst even though they hear they shall not understanding seeing they see but they don't get it amen amen because their heart is wax gross their ears are dull of hearing in their eyes if they close at least at any time i should see that they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear amen praise the lord how many how many has blessed ears you have blessed eyes when you can see the truth and when you can receive the truth in your heart you're a blessed person why because you're in the category of those that are believers and that are blessed not in the category of the damned and the condemned praise be to god oh my this kind of stuff ought to make us run around the aisles it just don't mean enough for it you know if i if i tell you what we don't get excited about things like we should but if i come back here one of these mornings and i tell you but it's even yesterday i've seen my mom i seen my dad huh what about y'all if you see your dad she billy brother uh brother billy or you know yeah what would you do you'd be i thought are they real the rapture's about to happen we're about to leave this or would you just say well i just saw my loved one you know yesterday i guess you know huh no it's going to do something it's going to propel our faith it is going to be something amen you talk about peter when he heard that jesus christ rose from the dead and then they ran they went they're running i believe there's going to be some running going on pretty soon when we see our loved ones appearing amen when we begin to see the dead in christ rising first we see him amen like abraham went into the city and showed himself they saw and they saw jesus amen it's going to be a whole lot of excitement going on unless you're tied to this world so much that you don't want to go yet huh how many believe this should mean everything to us blessed are your eyes for this e blessed are your ears that they can receive it because how many knows not everybody can accept it not everybody receives it amen let's look at look at it for just a minute amen so we find brothers and sisters that the gospel preached just the fact that jesus christ came to save the whole world amen and that's really all he has to read really in the judgment that's all he'll have to read that he rose from the dead that he said to go preach the gospel he don't believe us shall be saved he that believeth not shall be that that's what i said did you believe it that's all he has to ask did you believe it no well then you know the alternative you got a choice you had a choice did you want to believe it or did you want to be damned huh pretty strong man but that's the truth that's how it'll be amen god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish it didn't say jews gentiles blacks whites it didn't say anybody any colorado whosoever brother bam said he would i would rather he said that than say you know if brother branham if william bram or if you're put your name if you if you believe you'll be saved if thomas byler will believe he'll be saved no there's a lot of thomas spiders it might not be me but he says whosoever will well i can put myself in there whosoever believeth shall be saved he believeth not shall be damned period amen and that my friends is why brother bam says committing adultery smoking cursing all that stuff he says that's not sin that's not sin that's attributes of not believing because if you truly believed amen you wouldn't do those things he says you'll not be condemned for all that you'll be condemned because you didn't believe because your belief would have taken care of all that amen how many believes they would have taken care of all that and then it is the disbelief because of the disbelief because of what he did because he they have not believed this is a condemnation let me read it again before i go over into this area this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and men love darkness rather than life all right and also verse 18 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the son of god god said it you didn't believe it and he says if you don't you'll be condemned amen now how many believes that each one of us in our daily lives in the way that we live we live either by the blessings of god or you live by condemnation and damnation either the blessing of god is on you or the curse of god is on you how many knows the way of a transgressor is hard i'll talk to you about two classes of people this morning that is people that actually serve god amen have a covenant with god and backslide on god and those are actually foreordained like pharaoh was and like judas was all right that were before ordained unto condemnation right because god knows all things isn't that right let's go back into deuteronomy let's look at the blessings and the cursings of god now i'm going to do a bit of reading this morning is that okay i want you to follow with me and then whenever it sells and the people say amen i want you all to amen we're going to work on our amens this morning is that all right this is to show you that god does believe in the congregation saying amen all right now moses in the 27th chapter i just want to read the first three verses before i jump all the way down to uh verse 14. and moses with the elders of israel commanded the people saying keep all the commandments which i command you this day and it shall be on the day when ye pass over jordan unto the lamb which the lord thy god giveth thee that thou shalt set thee up great stones and plaster them with plaster and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law when thou art passed over the thou mayest go in unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee a lamb that floweth with milk and honey praise the lord now let me ask somebody this morning class tell me what our promised land is this morning the holy ghost is the correct answer the holy spirit for the promise is unto you the promised land it's unto you the holy ghost you shall receive the holy ghost amen the promise is to you to your children to them that are off of even as many as the lord our god shall call amen invented men have not the spirit of god he is none of his amen so our promised land our land of milk and honey is the holy ghost how many believe that it's a beautiful land full of huge fruits how many believes in this land there's some big fruit just like when they came back with them grapes they were so big it took men on six and two and so forth just to carry one cluster of grapes took two guys you know hey man you could probably go into the on the table and cut one up and everybody gets a good little part of that one little clump one grape will probably go a long way and our land is full of milk and honey it has got great great wonderful fruit on it amen amen what kind of fruit is it what kind of fruit now the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace amen long-suffering gentleness one of it is what joy joy bible says that we have joy unspeakable and full of glory we've got the peace that passes understanding down in our heart all of these great joys and great fruit that comes with this but the devil wants to rob you of it isn't that right and one what happens when you get away from the holy ghost what happens you get a little lose your joy you lose your peace now i'll tell you what kind of a miserable person you're going to be here in a minute okay we're going to talk about the curses for a minute and we're going to talk about the blessings and then we're going to get back on the cursings of god and then i'll show you that it's not just in the old testament but i'll bring it into the new testament and show you in the new testament how did it's carried over that's a new one for you ain't it all right so he says thou shalt write them upon all the words the of this law when thou passes over the thou mayest go in unto the language that lord thy god giveth thee a land that flows with milk and honey as the lord god then thy fathers has promised thee now notice down here he says verse 14. let's go to 13. and these shall stand upon modern evil and to curse reuben gad echar zebulon dan and naphtali and the levites shall speak and say unto all the men of israel with a loud voice cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molden image an abomination unto the lord the work of his hands of the craftsman and putteth it in a secret place and all the people shall answer and say that's right how many knows thou shalt have no other gods before me i mean please you got to put god first it could be your car it could be your wife could be anything that you put before god it is an idol and all the people said amen and cursed be he that sent us by the light of his father or his mother and all the people shall say cursive be he that removed his neighbor's landmark amen it's crooked amen and all the people shall say

amen and it's no witch putting nut on you some sooths here it's god putting it on you when he puts a curse on you you got a curse on you cursed be he that lies with his mother-in-law and all the people shall say verse 24 curses he that smiteth his neighbor secretly and all the people shall say cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person and all the people shall say [Music] cursed be that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them and all the people shall say amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and the people said i may believe he got left by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god the prophet of god said full obedience to the full word of god entitles you to the token praise the lord all

god let's find out what happens when you obey and hear truly the voice of god verse 28 and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god shall set thee on high above all nations of the earth amen what did peter say that you are a peculiar people a chosen nation a royal priesthood to show forth the glory and the of god isn't that right how many believes we're a chosen generation we're put above all the nations in the world you have a higher calling than anybody in the world amen over in deuteronomy here i'm just going to read this this day the lord thy god hath commanded thee to do these statues and judgments thou shalt therefore keep them and do them and with all of their heart with all of their soul verse 18 and the lord hath avouched the this day to be his peculiar people how many know the children of israel were peculiar people because god had been chosen by god if you're a son of god if you're a christian you are a peculiar person a royal nation listen so he says a peculiar people as he has promised thee and that thou should just keep all of his commandments verse 19 and to make thee high above all nations which ye have made in praise and in name in honor and that thou mayest be and holy people unto the lord thy god as he has spoken verse 2 again of chapter 28 thee on high above all nations of the earth and these are the blessings that shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shall hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god how many believe that there is absolute amazing blessings that come with adhering to the word of god i was trying to find that uh where the bible says something about uh uh here and here is prophets and so shall not prosper and so forth and it's in jeremiah not jeremiah ii chronicles where uh jehoshaphat amen the children of moab and the children of uh the moa children of moab and another one of the tribes had come up against jehoshaphat and he found out there was a great multitude coming against him amen and he went and sought the lord and ashes and sackcloth and all the people sought the lord and so forth and when he went and began to speak he says you know he talked about if you want to prosper him in and you listen to what god says amen now notice and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god blessed shall thou be in the city and bless it shalt thou be in the field amen how many is

are the head and you're not detailed thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if thou hearken unto the commandments of the lord thy god which i command thee this day to observe and to do them how many please when you follow christ you're a blessed person even jesus christ is called the son of her prosperity amen everything that christ does prospered whatsoever he doeth shall prosper nothing shall stand in the way how many knows that's one thing that the angel of the lord told letter man he says nothing will stand in your way same as he did moses nothing will stand in your way oh my wonder which doctors over there in uh germany and different places had the winds and the storms coming almost blowing it away he'd say thus saith the lord when be still isn't that right all these different times that you know these things happen nothing's ever stood in their way praise the lord amen what a wonderful lord we serve and that shall not go aside from any of the words which i command thee this day to the right or to the left or to go after other gods to serve them but it shall come to pass that if thou will not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all of his commands in his stat come upon thee and overtake thee cursed shall thou be in the city and curse it shall thou be in the field amen folks i'm here to tell you anybody that's had the holy ghost been in the land of the free with the child of god when you get away from god there is nothing perdy about it it's a horrible horrible place to be we have a transgressor it's hard we probably all have we've all grieved the holy spirit a time or two in our life now haven't we we've been out there amen and oh condemnation we'll sit back in and you'll feel horrible folks that don't feel horrible not having the holy ghost i dare say that he never had the holy ghost but when you father that only when you have god lead your new backslide guess what you find out it's a horrible place to be i don't care you ain't happy when you come in you ain't happy when you go out you don't want happy when you get up or you ain't happy when you lay down just condemnation in there fear is in there it's a terrible place to be how many knows him with an example of that amen of david david when he got away from the lord and when he disobeyed when he had the affair with bathsheba it doesn't matter in his house and everything everything it was all cursed it was a horrible time for david a horrible place to be when you get out of the will of god it's a terrible place to be that's why one wonder why people can just walk away from god and never look back if you're god's child god don't let that happen amen but like brother baby says you're gonna get it if you walk away from god you'll be corrected and you'll come back to god you never had nothing to begin with if you can walk away and never have any feeling about it amen oh my but when you have made it made a walk with the lord and you backslide it was like david you know he was a terrible he dated terrible he he talked about his soul being in hell it was a terrible place to get out of the will of god and not to listen to the voice of god amen oh my it's a terrible thing okay so he says look cursed shall thou be in the city and curse it shall thou be in the field cursed shall be thy basket and thy store curse it shall be the fruit of the body and the fruit of the land the increase of thy kind and the flocks of thy sheep curses shall thou be when thou cometh in the curses shall thou be when thou goest out oh my the lord shall send upon thee cursing vexation and rebuke amen in all that thou sent us thy hand unto for to do it until thou be destroyed how many knows how many times israel went into the promised land amen they took jericho without even a band-aid having to be put on one finger nobody even got a scratch oh they added wonderful but when a concent isn't that right ben 236 men died in the next battle fighting somebody they didn't even barely have just a little group that they could wipe out easy and they ended up being defeated it was a horrible place it was vexation of spirit whenever they took aiken and his wife and his children and all kill them and burn them all is that right put them on rocks and so forth what a horrible thing it was to break the law and the commandment of god not to listen to the voice of god until thou perish because of the weakness of thy doings whereby thou has forsaken me and the lord shall make pestilence to cleave entity until they have consumed thee from off the land whither thou goest to possess it and the lord shall smite me with consumption with fever with inflammation and with extreme burning with the sword and blasting and mildew and they shall pursue thee until thou perish and the heaven that is over thee shall be brass you remember all the good times and now it's nothing but heaviness and brass hardness coldness horribleness experienced it he knew what it was like to get away from the lord amen and to disobey god amen listen how many knows you just can't do some anything to a child of god without a recompense brother brahm talked about how that him and another brother was crossing a street from a hotel amen going across the street and they just jaywalk just when the walk anywhere and there was a overly re is overly zealous policemen on the corner that just railed them and railed them and reeled them and he says well back in louisiana we just crossed wherever we want to you know we didn't think nothing of it we didn't realize you had to cross down here at the crosswalk and he was really belittling because they were ministers and he says you know because of that they found out they came back this afternoon and found that man ran over by a truck had no respect when you cross god watch out god god is watching amen i mean because god is watching what we do amen the other the other man that he went to the garage and began to testify about christ about god he just you could come over here but don't bring that jesus and stuff you know and the truck ran down on him and smashed him in the ground amen so just bad things happen woman that says brother brandon i wouldn't have my cow follow your religion she was in the hospital screaming for brother bannon to come and ask and forgiveness he said there was no forgiveness amen died eyes bulging out the freckles on her face bulging out where she had freckles and so forth it was a terrible thing amen so listen you can read the rest of deuteronomy 28 when he come home but i don't want to stop there because he goes the whole chapter it's a long story but i told you i want to go over to the new testament how does this apply how does this come into the new testament amen let's turn with me let's look at paul for just a minute amen what paul said over in romans let's see how this applies amen today amen and before i get to the point i want to first of all we'll read in chapter one in verse 20 we'll begin to read and this is about people that actually knew god they see god in creation and so forth but they glorified him not as god and became vain for the invisible things verse 20 romans 1 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made amen in other words you can just look around and know there's got to be a god the moon the stars all of those heaven and keeping all their place that just can't be by chance that he had divine power working over it isn't that right period what was it einstein but the man says that came to the conclusion of the matter in the beginning god created amen that he actually made it all that's what einstein came to the conclusion of or was it it wasn't it wasn't in the beginning it was by faith we understand the worlds were created there's something over there in hebrews i believe he quoted that was the only explanation for the world smart as he was amen that that's the smart thing that i know of that he ever said even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse i gotta stop there for a minute but god i never could see i never knew anything what did you see the sun did you see the moon did it come up every morning on time did it go down every morning on time did the star in the galaxies i'll rotate this right yeah that was that was enough to tell you there's a god i mean i put you right on time in the middle of my creation you know and made it impossible for you not to know that there's got to be a higher power that's governing these things amen and then people want to say it was some kind of a big bang theory or it was evolution huh oh i can hear him have a good good judgment on that can't you but because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god and neither were thankful folks i'm here to tell you if once you start beginning to lose your thankfulness of god you begin to lose god amen amen but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools in other words they began the thinking that they were smart and as the smarter they thought they were the more of a fool they become and boy i'm here to tell you right now if that isn't our government and those who don't know what sex they come from and everything else they claim to be so smart they're showing themselves to be fools the bible says a man that says there is no god is a fool all right change the glory of the corruptable uncorruptable god into an image like unto corruptable man and of birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things wherever god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of god into a lie amen and worshiped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever go ahead amen see folks i know how many knows america was once a christian nation based on christian principles and when you turn your back on god what happens every curse in the book comes upon you that's what you and i are seeing we're seeing every curse in the book coming upon america they could try to fix it the best they can they'll never fix it god's curse is upon it until the fire is going to fall from the skies and burn it up oh my and for this cause god gave them up unto vile if not acceptable affections but violent affections for even their women to change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lusts one towards another men with men working that which is not seemly it's unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of reward error which was meat and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a repropate minds amen you have lost your mind yes you are crazy huh that's exactly the truth a reprobate mind to those to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignant and whisperers read this up in our congress and somebody probably want to shoot you it's exactly right they would hate you with a passion for just reading god's word amen backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god the day which commits such things are worthy of death that's what paul said people that are like that are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them amen let's go down to verse let's say uh it's verse six listen who will render unto every man according to his deeds to them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality in eternal life that's what you and i do isn't that right now here's where it brings over into the new testament but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish hello upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jews first and el sol of the gentiles so paul says anybody that does evil may this come upon them indignation wrath tribulation anguish upon every soul that does this amen but glory amen honor peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile for there is no respect of persons with god amen jesus and not jesus but god said to cain even to came when he had killed his brother amen he says do or it was before listen he says if you do the works of your brother you'll be accepted even to serpency the devil's own son cain the wicked one who's not the wicked one amen the bible says that he had no respect to persons he gave him that opportunity isn't that right to do right even the nations he says he's no respecter if they do right i'll accept them they do wrong i'll reject them and they'll be cursed amen one more well let me just talk about saul how many knows that paul i mean saul saul he was chosen to be the leader of israel and what happened when he disobeyed the commandment of god god had told him to go into that city and utterly destroy everything don't take anything don't leave man one woman or child alive is that right and i believe it was either a.i or one of those kings said it was and he had taken the kings alive and i'm i'm thinking that samuel or one of them went in there into the cave and killed them guys rather what are they breathing for god said kill them what are they what did you bring them back for why are they breathe drawing breath how many days that's the way it is with us god said not to do this nothing why is it still in life huh amen and because of that god allowed a spirit to come upon us all that what tormented infects his soul and he would have to have people nowadays have to drink or smoke or something to calm their nerves because of the vexation and the anguish that's in their hearts and in their souls because they don't have god because they're living under a curse and not the blessing of god they're living under condemnation people are never people that live under condemnation they're not happy people not happy no matter how much no matter what it is amen nothing's good enough the job ain't good enough their wife isn't good enough their husband isn't good enough nothing's good enough because why they have condemnation in here and saul he was miserable he was a miserable person all the way to his death he was miserable because he had disobeyed god amen how many know brother branham this will be god brother man disobeyed god at the beginning when he got all these invitations to go to the pentecostal realms and so forth his mother-in-law says you know don't you drag my daughter out amongst that trash them holy rollers and so forth don't you drag myra and his wife said i'll go with you i married you i'll go with you he said no she feels that way i won't go his wife got sick there's a flood that came she got sick his daughter got sick both died and as many healings as god had done through the prophet and so forth when he came to his own family god turned a black sheet in front of him refused to hear his prayer took him home he paid a dear price he was terrible and he was there i'd leave you there and and and in jeffersonville on that on that river there and there's a big falls up ahead amen his boat wouldn't start and he was there for because he was trying to rescue people and so forth and he was heading for that fall and he couldn't start it and that came to his ear real loud uh you know there's a he called you know you call him a bunch of trash huh he thought about a bunch of trash you know they weren't trash you should have went and preached to him amen he said god if you'll get me out of this i'll go preach i'll do whatever you want me to do but you talk about anguish you talk about sorrow amen the wild the love of his life amen the wife of our youth is the love of our life nobody ever like it nothing like it amen i don't know how people can be married 20 30 years and then separate the devil is what it is nothing but the devil and it seems to be easy nowadays isn't that right i told my wife yesterday we were talking about all the people and the marriages we've seen broken up you know that says you know i said it's so much selfishness nowadays people are so selfish and that's why you have those divorces and everything because people are selfish it's well if it isn't enough for them or whatever it is they're not willing to die to their self they just separate amen but anyway brother branham is we know he he disobeyed but then god of course he forgave him but he took his wife and his child and all of those days brother bam always look good seeing them on the other side amen let's talk to a and one more one more group and we want to talk about the regions actually the regions of the damned how many knows that there's a place that when you die if you're not a christian that you go into a place of torment it's not a place that you burn but it's a place like a nightmare where you get stuck in there you're in the realms of the damned amen and there's actually verse 4 of jude let's just begin reading in verse 4. for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation my now there the bible talks about people actually being ordained to condemnation we know that is because god knew what they would do to begin with romans the 8th or 9th chapter he talks about pharaoh for this reason have i raised you up that i might show forth my power in thee amen ungodly men turning the grace of our lord into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god in other words to turn away from and our lord jesus christ therefore i will put you in remembrance though you once do this how did the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterwards destroyed them that believed not how many knows every one of those israelites were out there in that wilderness wandering until they died because they would not believe all the miracles they would not be he couldn't get him to believe god couldn't get him to believe amen and also the angels which kept not their first step estate but left their own habitation that was open heaven i believe it was he had reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day even sodom and gomorrah and the cities round about them giving themselves over the fornication going after strange flesh are set forth for example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh they despise dominion they speak evil of dignities yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses thirst not bring against him a railing accusation said the lord rebuked you but these speak evil of things they do not but what they know naturally is root beasts indo things they corrupt themselves woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain they have ran greedily after the heir of balaam amen people that did not believe people that did not follow god's rules and laws one of them was cain one was balaam what happened with balaam amen and dathan and korra being swallowed up alive amen perish in the game saying of course these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water carried about with winds trees whose fruit withered without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame their wandering stars who to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of thee saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their heart speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him these are murmurs complainers walking after their own flesh lust and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having immense persons in admiration because of advantage but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before the apostle of our lord jesus christ how did they told you there would be mockers in the last times who would walk after their own ungodly lust peace be they who separate themselves sensual and not having the spirit but ye beloved i like this part building up yourselves in your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keep yourself in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life and if some have compassion making a difference and others save with fear pulling them out
