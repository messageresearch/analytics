[0:00] Verse 15 says, "See then that we walk
[0:03] circumstantially not as fools but as
[0:05] wise." Verse uh 16, "Redeeming the time
[0:10] because the days are evil." And I just
[0:12] want to speak a few minutes on this on
[0:14] this thought, redeeming the time. I
[0:17] believe we live in a time that time is
[0:20] going so fast you can't keep up. I
[0:22] believe we're living in such a busyness
[0:24] of life. The devil keeps us busy, young
[0:27] people. He keeps you busy with social
[0:30] media. He keeps you busy with social
[0:32] your phone. He keeps you busy. I tell
[0:34] you, I was at a store the other day,
[0:36] Brother Ber, and this young kid was
[0:38] doing this and literally hit the wall.
[0:41] Hid the wall. He didn't even look up. He
[0:44] just hid the wall. And I said, "That's
[0:47] the time we live in." That go that the
[0:49] devil wants to keep you so busy, young
[0:51] people, that you don't have no time for
[0:54] God. And God is still waiting for you to
[0:57] come back to your first love.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; He We're in a time that everything's
[1:02] running fast. We're We're in a time that
[1:04] it's busy. And I said, "You know what
[1:07] stands for? Being under Satan's yoke.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Being under Satan's yoke. God, the devil
[1:14] wants to keep you so yolked up in even
[1:16] your job or whatever you're doing that
[1:18] you'll even miss Wednesday nights. Oh,
[1:21] it's okay to miss a little Wednesday
[1:22] night here and there. It's okay to not
[1:25] maybe miss a Sunday, but no. Have you
[1:27] ever missed a gas station when you went
[1:29] by when it was almost on E?
[1:31] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:33] &gt;&gt; I have. I'm gonna be honest,
[1:36] &gt;&gt; my car didn't run that good, brother
[1:38] Ber. I I kind of started putting, but
[1:41] maybe some of you felt like I barely got
[1:43] here today, but you're here. And maybe
[1:45] you didn't feel like getting out of the
[1:47] bed today. And maybe you feel like you
[1:49] just put a bomb in life. But I'm here to
[1:51] tell you, let God come on and change
[1:54] that attitude. Let God fill you up.
[1:56] Maybe you say, "Brother Cris, my joy is
[1:59] empty." Well, guess what? He'll give you
[2:01] some more joy today. Whatever you need
[2:04] today.
[2:06] Well, I tell you, aren't you thankful
[2:07] that we got a little gauge? And
[2:09] sometimes, I mean, there's not every day
[2:11] that I feel like waking up. And there's
[2:12] been days I'm like, "Oh gosh, I got to
[2:14] preach today. Oh my, I barely can feel
[2:16] my body. I'm not feeling good." But I'm
[2:18] here to tell you, it's not about your
[2:20] feelings today.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; It's not about how we feel. It's it's
[2:24] about we just come here and say, "God,
[2:25] you have control. You have control of my
[2:28] life." But are we living in a time that
[2:30] we need to redeem our time back? The
[2:33] devil's trying to steal your family's
[2:34] time, your devotion time, your prayer
[2:37] time, your everything in your life. The
[2:40] devil wants to take up in your family's
[2:42] life, fill it with games, and hey,
[2:44] they're all good in their place. In
[2:46] volleyball, I saw all that's good in his
[2:48] time. But God wants to fill the young
[2:50] people, he wants to feed you with the
[2:52] Holy Ghost.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; He wants to give you a life that's worth
[2:55] living. Maybe you're maybe you say,
[2:58] "Well, my family don't do this. My dad
[3:00] don't pray. My mama don't read the
[3:01] Bible." Well, guess what? You ripped the
[3:03] Bible.
