And he said, "It just really tore me up." But he said, "I realized that, you know, that's not it's not that big a deal.

There'll be no service this coming Wednesday as usual on Thanksgiving. We don't have it on our midweek. So, we want everybody to just remember that. Also, um, sister Betty's arrangement. Uh, let's start with the, uh, viewing. The viewing will be held this afternoon from 2 to 4 and from 6:00 to 8 at 102 Menanite Church Road, Franklin, Kentucky. Amen. 102. Everybody say 102. And you can Menite Church Road. Amen. And that that's all you got to punch in or I believe anyway. Amen. So, uh, to get you over there, it's probably just on the other side of Russellville, a little bit past Mary, Jane, and them. Amen. Just a little past there. So, anyway, anybody wants to go to Ever this afternoon, I'll be going over there for a little bit today and then speaking a little bit at it tomorrow also at the funeral, which will be at 11 o'clock in the morning. Amen. So, 11 o'clock. So, we certainly are going to miss Sister Betty. Amen. Amen. So let's stand if you will. We'll just have a moment of silence to remember her. 82 years old I believe she was. Amen. And so Amen. And always something special when God takes mothers. Amen. Because they have a very very special role in this world. So let's bow our heads and remember Sister Betty. Kind heavenly father, we come before you, Lord, and we want to remember brother David, Lord Jesus, her husband, father, as she's dealing, Lord, with a very deep pain. And our heart goes out to him. Father, we pray you'd bring comfort, Lord, through your word and through your scriptures. Father, that he might have consolation knowing, God, that it's not the end. That your word just as sure as you rose from the dead, you're going to raise all those that are in Christ. We're going to meet once again, Lord. Our bodies will come from the dust of the earth, changed to immortality. into eternal beings and not creatures of time. So when we ask God that you would just comfort him Lord Jesus, the rest of the family, brother Woody and Michelle and all of them, all of their children, Lord, just bring comfort to them, Lord Jesus, for we know truly that there's only one truly that can comfort them and that's you. That's your word from us, a promise that you have given us, Lord. And we ask God that you be with that family now in a special way in Jesus name, Father. And also we ask God that as we open your Bible this morning, we ask Lord Jesus that you would help me get out of the way that you would speak to our hearts, Father, directly. We know that you deal not so much with the church as you do deal with individuals. So uh Father, we believe God that you'll deal with individuals this morning. Individual hearts you'll speak to. Father, we ask God that each one would have a ear to hear what the spirit saith to the church this morning, Father. And Lord, we ask God for you to come in a special way now in this thanksgiving message. Just take every part of the thoughts that I've thought and what I feel like you've laid upon my heart to speak. We ask your blessing, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. my my thanksgiving message as I want to call it this morning. It's going to be Amen. Also, if you want to put it up, Amen. I just this came to me, Amen. when I begin to think about this was actually about a week ago. Uh I thought about calling it turning points. Have you got the rest of that title or no? All right. All right. And I also wrote there it's going to be a study a study teaching perhaps however the spirit leads on brother Brandham's thanksgiving message. Brother Brandham brought us a thanksgiving message. Amen. And so I want to kind of bring some quotes out of that and go from there. And amen. It's it's quite a message. Amen. The same as shalom was. And uh so we just pray that God will bless it in a special way. If you will turn your Bibles this morning, I think we'll begin and I want to begin with with thankfulness. Amen. Thankfulness since we're celebrating Thanksgiving. Amen. Here in a few days. So let's turn to Romans 1. Romans 1. I called it turning points because we spoke a little bit Wednesday on navigation, how to each one of us, our vehicles and if it wouldn't be for maps or navigation, we wouldn't know how to get from one place to the other. And Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man comes to the father but by me." Amen. And all that are led by the spirit of God, they are sons of God. So that Holy Spirit, amen, navigates us and help us na navigate through all the different twists and turns of life, the hardships and things that come. Amen. And so, and I said a lot of times that people fail to make turns when God turns because as the prophet of God brought out, he says, you know, we're not just building a straight wall. We're, you know, we have to make turns. Amen. And same way with the roads. If if you're going down the road, you can't keep going straight if there's a curve there or you're going to wreck up. And that's unfortunately what a lot of uh people have done through time. Ain't that right? God would send an angel. He would send a messenger. Ain't that right? Amen. And and uh I think uh y'all remember I don't want to bring up a sore subject, but y'all remember uh there is even a group called Pettes. The Pette group. Hell. Have you heard of that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Plet groups. Leonard and them. They got all deceived by all of that. Amen. And so, and I went and heard them one time and heard heard heard it. And so, they Anyway, we won't go down that road, but just people denominate on just a certain thing and they stop there. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And they don't keep going. It happened in Luther's day. It happened in Wesley's day. happened in Pentecostals. They were they got so much of the truth and they put a period behind what they believed and that's where they stopped. But God keeps moving on. He gives more deeper and greater revelation. Ain't that right? And when you stop like the Pharisees did. Ain't that right? They had absolutely what God ordained them to do, but they become a tradition and they added their own ideas, their own uh what did Jesus call it? He says, "You teach the doctrines of men, you know, as the commandments of God, and you make the word of God of none effect." And look at the condition they got into. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Because they feel failed to go on with God. So, it's a it's it's it's a it's a even Jesus expressed it when he says, you know, you can discern the signs of the time. I mean, the sky, but you can't discern the signs of the time. Amen. And we'll get into some of that here in a little bit. Amen. and when talking about why people miss God. Isn't that right? Amen. And we don't want to do that. We want to say, "God, don't never put me a period behind what I believe, but Lord, show me more." Amen. Because there's more to be shown. Okay. Let's talk about thankfulness for just a minute. Amen. Amen. Amen. I called it uh let me see what I did here. Thankfulness, gratefulness, appreciation, an attitude of gratitude is part of worshiping God. Amen. How many know thankfulness is part of worshiping God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, let me just give you real quick. I won't keep you too long standing. Okay, bear with me. Amen. If I can find it. Amen. And I believe it said in for Revelations 4, just bearing out that thanks is part of worship. And when those beasts gave glory and honor and thanks. Amen. Part of worship. And and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth forever and ever. Amen. 1 Thessalonians 5:18 Paul says, "In everything give thanks for this is the will of God of God in Christ Jesus concerning you." Amen. How many believe we ought to be thankful? Amen. Romans 1 and verse 21 says, "Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God and neither were thankful." How many knows that the an attitude of unthankfulness takes you down a terrible road? Amen. It become you become unappreciative, ungrateful, grouchy. You become a complainer, a murmurer. Amen. Now, how many knows that the devil when he was God's right-hand man, when he was up in heaven right beside God, he became unthankful. &gt;&gt; Amen. He became unthankful. He didn't appreciate it anymore, the position that he had and where he was at. Amen. He wanted more. He become jealous of God. Want it more. Look at where he's at today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. And neither were thankful, but became in their vain, in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools. May God add his blessings to the reading of the word. You can be comfortable. Amen. Second Timothy says, 'I know this also, this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves. Amen. Covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despises of those that are good, heady, I mean traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God. What is the great commandment? There is one God. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy strength. One of the first commandments ever given was that you're supposed to love God above everything else. &gt;&gt; How many appreciates? Amen. A God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was driving down my driveway today and I said, "Honey, I tell you what, I thank God for another day. When you get a little older, you thank God for every day that you have &gt;&gt; cuz like Sister Betty, one of these days, we won't have any more days. &gt;&gt; No, you come to your last day. You're done. You're done in this world." Amen. And we want to prepare for that time. WE WANT TO BE READY FOR THAT TIME. I don't care what age you are. Be ready for that time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And be thankful for every day that God gives you. &gt;&gt; And not just for every day, but everything. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING THAT GOD GIVES US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he created all things and without whether his principalities or powers or dominion, things present, ALL THINGS WERE CREATED FOR HIM AND BY him and without him was not anything made that was made. &gt;&gt; Amen. HOW MANY KNOWS EVERYTHING WE SEE, everything material, he made it all. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. HE MADE MY ELBOW. HE MADE MY WRISTS. HE MAKES MY FINGERS. He made my mouth. HE MADE EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE. WE OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL. Thank you, Jesus. That's right. Amen. An attitude of gratitude WILL GO A LONG WAY. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, THIS WORLD DOESN'T APPRECIATE GOD. &gt;&gt; Jesus with DIRTY FEET. REMEMBER, EVEN Simon mistreated him. AMEN. THE PHARISEES TRIED TO KILL HIM. &gt;&gt; ARE THE MOST RELIGIOUS PEOPLE OF THAT DAY. AND WE WANT TO talk about that a little bit because we know that Satan's in the realm of religion. This morning, WE WANT TO COVER COVER SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENED IN OUR DAY. WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN OUR DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. What Jesus did in OUR DAY. IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE REMEMBER IF YOU MISS WHAT GOD IS DOING IN YOUR DAY, you miss God. &gt;&gt; THOSE PHARISEES MISSED IT. AMEN. Even Jesus SAID, HE SAID HE WEPT. AMEN. AND SAID, "OH, JERUSALEM, JERUSALEM, HOW I WOULD HAVE HELD THEE AS A HAND DESERT BROOD, BUT you would not." MAY I SAY AS A SERVANT OF GOD THIS MORNING, THIS WORLD, THIS GENERATION, HE WOULD HAVE HOVERED YOU. HE SHOWED YOU INFALLIBLE PROOFS THAT HE WAS ALIVE. HE DISCERNED THE THOUGHTS INTENTS OF THE HEART. HE TOLD PEOPLE WHERE THEIR NAMES WAS AND ALL WHERE THEY COME FROM. AMEN. THERE WAS NO QUESTION JESUS MADE HIMSELF.

THE GOVERNMENT SAID THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THAT'S I DON'T SEE A MAN. I SEE GOD ALMIGHTY. THE SAME PILLAR OF FIRE. AMEN. THAT LET THE CHILDREN THAT'S WHY I'M NOT ASHAMED TO HAVE MY GOD HANGING ON MY WALL. THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. THE SAME PILLAR OF FIRE THAT PAUL SAW WHEN HE SAID THAT IT WAS STRUCK DOWN BY THE GREAT LIGHT. THAT'S THAT SAME LIGHT. &gt;&gt; Nothing but the truth. Right, brother Joe? &gt;&gt; That ain't nothing but the truth. I People have gotten healed believing that picture. People have been con completely condemned by condemning that picture. So be careful what you do with it. &gt;&gt; God didn't let all the other pictures not be developed except that one for no reason. Right. &gt;&gt; He was vindicating. I'm with this man. &gt;&gt; I'M LIKE WITH HIM LIKE I WAS WITH MOSES. &gt;&gt; MARY AND AARON SPOKE A LITTLE BIT AGAINST MOSES. MADE A LITTLE FUN OF HIM AND THEY GOT LEPROSY OR SICKNESS. Isn't that right? I believe IT WAS LEPROSY. THEY WERE FIXING TO DIE. OH, if there's a prophet in the land, I might speak to him in visions. This that or the other. But there's NONE LIKE MOSES. I SPEAK to him lip to hear. How many KNOW BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE GOT SPOKEN TO LIP TO EAR. AMEN. BEFORE GOD IS GOING TO BURN THIS WORLD BEFORE THERE'S GOING TO BE AN UNMERCIFUL WRATH OF GOD POURED OUT UPON THIS WORLD LIKE YOU AIN'T NEVER SEEN. AMEN. HE GOT SENDS HIS ONE FINAL PROPHET AND VINDICATES HIM OVER AND OVER and over and OVER AGAIN. AMEN. SO THAT you wouldn't HAVE TO HAVE ONE DOUBT. OH, I DON'T HAVE ONE DOUBT, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH. WHY? BECAUSE WE POINTED US AND BROUGHT US BACK TO THE WORD OF GOD, NOT HIMSELF. NOT JUST TO START ANOTHER EVENING NIGHT TABERNACLE. NOT TO DRAW PEOPLE AFTER HIM, BUT TO POINT YOU TO CHRIST. Point us to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'm thankful for the to God for that. HOW MANY I'M THANKFUL. THANK YOU, LORD, FOR SENDING US MALACHI 4. BEHOLD, I'LL SEND YOU ELIJAH THE PROPHET BEFORE THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD. AND HE'LL TURN THE HEARTS OF THE CHILDREN TO THE FATHERS, AND THE HEARTS OF THE CHILDREN BACK TO THE FATHER. HEART OF THE FATHERS TO THE CHILDREN, AND THE CHILDREN BACK TO THE FATHERS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AM I LOOKING AT A PRODUCT OF THAT OR WHAT? &gt;&gt; Come on, PEOPLE. I'M LOOKING AT A PRODUCT. I AM LOOKING FOR THE MANIFESTATION OF THAT SCRIPTURE FULFILLED. I WILL RESTORE ALL THAT THE PALMER WORM HAS EATEN THE CATERPILLAR. AMEN. I WILL RESTORE, SAYETH THE LORD. HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT I'M LOOKING AT A RESTORED PEOPLE? WE HAVE BEEN RESTORED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand something. This is a message that God sent is the clothes that's going to be fit to go in the rapture. It's going to dress you in the clothes that you need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO WASH US WHITE. IT'S GOING TO MAKE US PURE. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO BE PURE WITHOUT SPOT, WITHOUT WRINKLE. CUZ THAT BIBLE SAYS IN EPHESIANS THERE THAT CHRIST DID THAT FOR US. Oh my. I'm going to go ahead and take time to read that. Would I would that okay? I just don't have it wrote down, but I think it would be very good just to read it because it's part of my message this morning. Amen. Listen to this. Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word. We could stop there for the rest of today. How many believes if you don't have a clean word? IF YOU GOT, WELL, GOD DON'T REALLY MEAN WHAT HE SAYS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET CLEAN. THIS DON'T REALLY MATTER AND THAT DON'T REALLY MATTER. QUIT LYING, DEVIL. YOU TOLD EVE THAT SAME THING. THAT AIN'T GOING TO CLEAN NOTHING. BUT WE'RE HAVE A PURE WORD THAT TELLS YOU THAT GOD COME TO CLEANSE YOU. THAT WHEN HE DIED ON CALVARY, THAT BLOOD WAS FOR THIS REMISSION OF YOUR SIN. THAT IF YOU ACTUALLY CONFESS YOUR SINS, REPENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND LET GOD COME DOWN INTO YOUR HEART AND WASH YOU WHITE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE CLEANSING AND THAT IS BY TELLING YOU THE WORD OF GOD. THE WORD OF GOD THAT SAID HE DIED FOR YOUR SINS. IF YOU'LL REPENT EVERY ONE OF YOU AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION OF YOUR SINS, GOD WILL WASH YOU CLEAN AND HE'LL FILL YOU WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. THE PROMISE IS TO YOU TO YOUR CHILDREN TO THEM THAT ARE ALL THE WAY DOWN IN 2025. IT'S FOR US THIS MORNING. IT'LL BE FOR TOMORROW IF GOD CARRIES. THAT'S THE WAY. THAT'S SALVATION. THERE'S NO OTHER SALVATION IN ANY OTHER NAME except for in Jesus Christ. There's no name given under heaven whereby you must be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Washing of the water by the word that he might present it to HIMSELF A GLORIOUS CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVES WE'RE PART OF THAT? &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE GOD SENT A PROPHET TO RESTORE US BACK TO WHAT PAUL SAID. AND WHEN HE WENT ON THE CURTAIN OF TIME AND HE SEEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND HE THE ANGEL TOLD HIM, HE SAYS, "YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE JUDGED FOR WHAT YOU PREACHED, MAN. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE JUDGED FOR WHAT YOU PREACHED." Brother Bam said, "Will Paul have to be judged for what he preached?" &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Angel said, "Yep, he's going to HAVE TO BE JUDGED FOR WHAT HE PREACHED. EVERY ANGEL'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE JUDGED FOR WHAT HE PREACHED." AND VAN SAID, "WELL, PRAISE BE TO GOD. IF HIS GROUP MAKES IT, MINE WILL, TOO, BECAUSE I PREACH JUST WHAT PAUL PREACHED." WOO! And millions, MILLIONS. WOO! HERE'S A LITTLE GROUP RIGHT HERE. MILLIONS CRIED OUT, "WE'RE RESTING ON THAT. WE'RE RESTING ON THAT." HOW MANY OF THESE WE'RE RESTING ON THAT HE PREACHED WHAT PAUL PREACHED? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm going to have to get more comfortable. I can't work in these clothes. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. AREN'T YOU GLAD FOR THAT? OH, millions cried out. You dropped dead. You're a message believer. Follow the message. Amen. Cuz remember what the angel said? He says, "This is your people that you've been gathered to. These are all brandoms." He said, "Your people." I don't know how Bill Brandham couldn't mistake it. That's a bunch of Brandhams. He thought that was his family. I must have, right, Brother Brad? It's only logical to think he THOUGHT THESE WERE YOUR PEOPLE, YOUR FAMILY. A lot of your family MADE IT. NO. THE ANGEL SAYS, "UH-UH. That's not what we're talking about. These are your coverage." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That you led to the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THAT'S ONE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY COME UP, GIVE HIM A big hug, and the angel said, "Do you remember her?" No, I don't remember her. She was past 80 years old. Hello. She wasn't young and beautiful then. No, she was old and wrinkled AND EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT SHE WAS SO OLD. AMEN. AND SHE SAID, "OUR PRECIOUS BROTHER, THAT'S WHY SHE YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO HER BECAUSE YOU LED HER TO CHRIST ALL THOSE YEARS. FOR 80 YEARS, SHE didn't know you, BUT HE LED HER TO CHRIST." &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY PRECIOUS BROTHER. AMEN. See folks, how many knows? Read Revelation. Seven stars, seven church ages. The seven stars are my seven angels. Ain't that right? Seven messengers. I am so thankful this morning that I haven't gotten my own message. &gt;&gt; Hello. Brother Bam didn't have his own message. No, he had to come and re and deliver God's message. &gt;&gt; How many believes what I say has to be God's message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we don't have to WORRY ANYMORE. WE DON'T HAVE TO AMEN. PUT ANYTHING OF OUR OWN TO IT ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; Don't put anything of your own ideas. THAT'S WHY WE GOT TRACTORS OUT HERE WITH STEEL WHEELS RUNNING AROUND. THAT'S RIGHT, MENANITES. LISTEN CLOSELY. YOU'RE RUNNING AROUND WITH STEEL WHEELS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOUR BISHOP SAYS. THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL SAID. THAT'S NOT WHAT THE BIBLE SAID. AND THEN DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TODD COUNTY, THEY CAN HAVE TIRES AND AND IF YOU AIN'T CAREFUL, THEY'LL PASS YOU ON THE ROAD JUST A WOO SINGING TIRES. WOO! WOO! WOO! WOO! WOO! WOO! WOO! WOO! HELLO. I'LL NEVER FORGET COMING OUT OF CLARKSVILLE. THERE WAS A LADY I mean there was a tractor with a trailer and they were in packed up in the BACK AND I DON'T KNOW IT LOOKED LIKE THEY RAN OFF THE ROAD A LITTLE BIT AND THAT BACK WAS JUST BOUNCING AND I LOOKED AND IT WAS A LITTLE OLD LADY DRIVING WITH A BIG OLD BONNET LIKE YOU know she was just kind of hunched over. I'M LIKE, "OH MY LORD, THERE THEY GO." HEY, at least they CAN HAVE FUN DRIVING A TRACTOR. THEY AIN'T GOT TO BE ON THAT HORSE MUGGY ALL THE TIME. HELLO. BUT ALL OF THESE TRADITIONS OF MAN, ALL THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE put in it, how many believe WE NEED THE PURE WORD OF GOD AND IT'LL PRODUCE PURE WORD RESULTS? &gt;&gt; THAT'S what we HAVE BACK TO THE PURE UNADULTERATED WORD of God. Amen. Praise be to God. Let me tell you something. That's why I don't remind that that's why I don't mind and I'd almost rather read brother Brandham's quotes if I'm going to quote anything. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he would say, "Now, if I've told you the truth and Jesus Christ don't come down here and bear record of it, you don't have to believe it. But if Jesus himself will come down and he'll bear record of it by doing what he did with the on the shores of Galilee with the woman at the well, you've had five husbands. The one you're with now ain't yours. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. She wanted a drink of water to what I give you. Amen. It'll be of in you a well of water springing up into everlasting life. He says, "We know that when the Messiah comes, he'll show us these things." And he said, "I am he that speaks to you." BROTHER, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT JESUS JUST DIDN'T TELL THAT to anybody. BUT HE FELT LED TO TELL HER AND she believed him. Ain't that right? AMEN. AND AFTERWARD, SHE HAD SUCH A FLOWING WELL OF WATER IN HER UNTIL SHE RAN INTO THE CITY AND SAID, "NOW, COME MEET A MAN THAT HAS TOLD ME EVERYTHING I'VE EVER DONE. ISN'T THIS THE VERY MESSIAH?" IT WAS THE MESSIAH SIGN THEN, IT WAS THE MESSIAH THEN, AND IT'S THE MESSIAH NOW. AND HE WENT ROUND AND ROUND ALL OVER. BROTHER RANDOM MINISTRY ALMOST EVERY SERVICE HE'D EVER HAVE HE'D HAVE DISCERNMENT OF discernment he'd have healing OF THE SICK AND JESUS CHRIST WOULD COME DOWN AND PERFORM THESE THINGS HE SAYS NOW look Brown you know what I'm waiting on right &gt;&gt; you know I'm waiting on because I'm helpless &gt;&gt; I can't do anything myself Hello. He has to come. And when he comes, HE BEGINS TO USE MY EYES. HE BEGINS TO SHOW ME VISIONS. HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO PEOPLE. HE SAYS, "THUS SAY THE LORD, YOU'RE HEALED." GOD GETS ALL THE GLORY. I MEAN, JESUS GETS ALL THE GLORY. &gt;&gt; WHY? WE'RE ALL JUST A MICROPHONE. WE'RE JUST A MICROPHONE. WITHOUT IT, we're mute. &gt;&gt; Can't do nothing without Christ. She went into the city and said, "Is this the very Messiah?" When I think about how unthankful, ungrateful that people are. People are ungrateful. They're unthankful. The Pharisees, THEY WERE SO UNTHANKFUL THAT WHEN GOD RAISED LAZARUS FROM THE DEAD, THEY THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING LAZARUS. CAN YOU IMAGINE how ungrateful? Yet in their heart, Nicodemus knew. We know THAT YOU'RE A MAN OF SENT FROM GOD. YOU CAN'T YOU COULDN'T DO these things unless YOU WAS OF GOD. EVEN JESUS SAID, "You you blind leaders of the blind." He said, "You you know, you're white at sephilicurs. You paint the outside of that coffin white and it's all PRETTY LOOKING, BUT INSIDE OF THAT COFFIN, IT'S BUNCH OF DEAD MEN'S BONES. HE SAID, "IF YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ME, BELIEVE THE WORKS." &gt;&gt; HE TRIED HIS BEST TO CONVINCE THEM. &gt;&gt; OH, and my message this morning is maybe those streaming. HELLO. GOD CAN ABSOLUTELY COME DOWN AND WE CAN TELL YOU GOD SENT US A PROPHET. WE CAN SHOW YOU THE PICTURE BACK THERE OF A OF THE HALO. WE CAN TELL YOU THE STORY BEHIND it and you don't give a hoot. You don't care enough to really check those tapes out. YOU DON'T CARE ENOUGH to get you a a listen to a sermon AND SEE IF THAT WAS REALLY JESUS DOING THAT. BECAUSE I'M HERE PROCLAIMING THAT THERE'LL BE NO MORE MESSAGES GIVEN TO THE GENTILES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE'VE RECEIVED THE LAST ONE. THE NEXT THING TO FALL IS Putin's nukes. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOWS THAT'S NEXT IN ORDER? &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO BOMB THIS PLACE. HE'S GOING TO BOMB ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE THAT IN ONE HOUR ROME WILL BE BURNT UP. &gt;&gt; AMERICA'S GOING TO BE BURNT UP. &gt;&gt; THE FIRE'S GOING TO FALL. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THEY REFUSED. THEY REJECTED CHRIST. This generation has absolutely rejected Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; THEY REJECTED MERCY. I DON'T CARE IF YOU WERE MARRIED TWO OR THREE TIMES, YOU WAS ALL MESSED UP IN YOUR MARRIAGE. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT AS LONG AS A WOMAN'S HUSBAND, FIRST HUSBAND'S LIVING, SHE CAN'T BE REMARRIED OR SHE'LL BE CALLED AN ADULTERESS. &gt;&gt; HELLO. But there was even mercy for people like that. God himself says, "Don't you ever do it again. You can be forgiven that, but don't you ever do it again." That right? MERCY. HOW MANY GLAD FOR THE MERCY THAT GOD SHOWS US? &gt;&gt; That would have put a lot of people out ungrateful. Jesus can come along and tell you stories of a rich man in Lazarus. One had it bad and one had it good. By and by they both went by the way of the grave. And the rich man lifted up his eyes and hell. Ain't that right? And he says, "Man, just let Lazarus COME OVER AND DIP A LITTLE WATER ON MY TONGUE CUZ IT'S SO HOT. It burns so much." How many has ever burnt their tongue? Boy, isn't it painful though? &gt;&gt; It is painful. AND HE SAYS, "HAVE SOMEBODY GO BACK. SOMEBODY GO TELL MY BROTHERS NOT TO COME TO THIS TERRIBLE PLACE." THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO DO THIS MORNING. DON'T GO TO THAT TERRIBLE. YOU AIN'T GOT TO BE LOST. YOU AIN'T GOT TO GO TO HELL. &gt;&gt; If you go to hell, YOU GO THERE. PERSEVERANT. &gt;&gt; DETERMINED. EVERY BARRICADE. THE VOICE OF EVERY PREACHER. The voice of EVERY SONG. GO over top of your conscience. &gt;&gt; You have to go over all of these barricades God puts in front of people in order to finally get there. &gt;&gt; When I think of the goodness of Jesus and all he has done for me, he brought me on out of Amish Menonite or Baptist. Amen. How many GLAD TO BE BROUGHT OUT? HE HAS BROUGHT ME out and he has set me free. &gt;&gt; Free from condemnation. &gt;&gt; Free from judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. And why? It's because I believe the pure unadulterated word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but it should be holy and without blemish. All right, let me read you a few quotes. Is that all right? All right, devil, get out of my iPad. It's not supposed to close for 15 minutes. And it's not supposed to jump upside down every time, right? Brother Bam says, "I want to pass greetings down the line now." 1965. Amen. His message, his thanksgiving message. Amen. He says, "Greetings down the line. Church is now hooked up in the states across the states where telephone hookup is where this little system we have got to through brother Perry Green." He says, "From Bumont, Texas." Amen. and the churches completely that's following the message all the way across the United States is hooked up tonight. We sent greetings up down the west coat all the way to Vancouver down to Tijana I guess Tijana Mexico through San Joe's Los Angeles all the groups over there we greet you from Shriport also all the way to Prescott Arizona to the groups up there that's waiting on the Lord we sent greetings to you Tucson Sarav Vista all the way to New York down across the nation the Lord bless each one of you wish you were here tonight this beautiful state of Louis Louisiana so he was greeting the people all over the United States. He was making a proclamation. Amen. He had a message from the Lord. How many believe? How many likes that? When he's got a certain message that he brings to the people. Amen. Because we know there was a time when brother Brandham would preach to the Baptist and the Methodists to all of them. HE'D GO EVERYWHERE, EVERYWHERE HE COULD COULD GO. AND HE SAYS, "NOW FIND YOU A GOOD CHURCH HOME. FIND YOU A PLACE TO GO." BUT AROUND 1963 and after the seals because brother Brand mentions the seals that after the opening of the seals you know there was a change in the ministry there was a change that took place there was a turn because the denominations denominational churches turned him away Jesus could come and discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. They didn't care. If you go to that church, we'll excommunicate you. And they did. Some of them. They got to that place. And you know, sometimes we might think, well, you know, brother preacher, you're so hard on churches and stuff. But listen to what God said in the to the age of the church of the Lelayans. He says, "The things writ the amen, the faithful, true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot. I would thou art cold nor hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. This is what God says about this last age church. BECAUSE THOU SAYS, I AM RICH AND INCREASE WITH GOODS, I HAVE NEED OF NOTHING. I DON'T NEED YOU. I DON'T NEED A PROPHET. HELLO. When how MANY KNOWS WHEN GOD SENDS A PROPHET, IT'S FOR A PURPOSE? IT'S FOR A REASON. &gt;&gt; IT'S FOR YOUR BLESSING. AND TO REJECT IT IS TO BE UNGRATEFUL. UNTHANKFUL. &gt;&gt; Remember in Tim TIMOTHY THERE IT SAYS UNTHANKFUL UNOLY. AMEN. IT SAYS HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS BUT DENYING THE POWER THEREOF. IT WAS A CHURCH GROUP THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; WOO. HELLO. Pretty bad. &gt;&gt; So he SAYS RICH AND KNOWEST NOT THAT THOU ART WRETCHED AND MISERABLE AND POOR AND BLIND AND NAKED. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT'S THE CONDITION THE WORLD'S IN? &gt;&gt; BLIND, WRETCHED, MISERABLE, POOR, NAKED, spiritually naked. Another one in Revelations 17:1, he says, "And there was there came one of the seven angels which had seven miles and talked with me, saying unto me, come hither and I WILL SHOW YOU THE judgment of the great that siteth upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication." NOTICE A FORNICATION'S A LITTLE HEAVY FOR OUR SMALLER YOUNG ONES EARS, BUT IT'S A TRUTH. GOD SEEN THIS woman as that. Listen, the earth kings of the earth have committed fornications and the inhabitants of the earth have drunk of the wine of her fornication. When the pope has a big gathering, don't all THE WORLD LEADERS COME TO HIM? &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HAVE AN AUDIENCE WITH HIM WITHOUT KNEELING AND KISSING HIS RING, giving him worship, COMMITTING FORNICATIONS WITH HIM. AMEN. And he carried me away in the spirit in the wilderness. And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and 10 horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, FULL OF ABOMINATIONS AND filthiness of her fornication. AND UPON her head WAS A NAME WRITTEN, MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER of harlots. HELLO. THE MOTHER OF harlots and abominations of the earth. Notice that's the Catholic Church. She was the first organization, first denomination. They bow down and kiss the toes off of the Peter's image. Isn't that right? Pray to marry. THAT'S SPIRITUAL FORNICATION. CLAIMING TO BE MARRIED TO CHRIST, THEY'RE THE BIGGEST BUNCH OF FORNICATORS THERE EVER WAS. &gt;&gt; GOD CALLS HER A &gt;&gt; THAT'S exactly right. &gt;&gt; He's playing. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he said that she's A MOTHER OF HARLOTS. ANYTHING YOU ADD TO GOD'S WORD MAKES YOU AN ADULTERESS. YOU BETTER NOT ADD TO OR TAKE AWAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOUR POWER WILL BE TAKEN OUT. GOD WANTS YOU TO BE HIS WIFE. &gt;&gt; How many believe we are turning a corner from just being a church to being THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST? IT'S BRIDE TIME. Revelation 19 says, "And I heard another voice, and and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as THE VOICE OF MIGHTY THUNDERING, SAYING, HALLELUJAH, THE LORD OUR GOD OMNIPOTENT REIGNTH. LET US BE GLAD AND REJOICE AND GIVE HONOR TO HIM, FOR THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB IS COME AND HIS WIFE HAS MADE HERSELF READY." HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING? AMEN. And we're saying, "God, clothe me with your righteousness." This is a group of people, amen, in the message OF THE HOUR THAT'S NOT MARRIED TO BROTHER BRANDHAM, NOT MARRIED TO SOME DENOMINATION. WE'RE GETTING MARRIED TO JESUS CHRIST. HE WAS OUR ELEASER TAKING us to Isaac. HALLELUJAH. HOW MANY IS GLAD FOR THAT? &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Back here, listen. Mystery, Babylon, the mothers, and abominations of the earth. And I SAW THE WOMAN DRUNKEN WITH THE BLOOD of the saints and with blood as of martyrs of Jesus. AND WHEN I SAW HER, I WONDERED WITH GREAT ADMIRATION, HOW MANY KNOWS THAT THOSE 68 MILLION CHRISTIANS WERE KILLED BY CATHOLICISM? YEAH. You say this a little bit later in the tribulation, they'll come in here and drag your self out and shoot you. They killed 68 million. And you wait until that great that devil is kicked out of heaven. Hello. He knows he has but A SHORT TIME. WOE UNTO THE INHABITANTS of the earth. Then it says, "For the devil has God come down to you and he knows that he has but a short time." Prophet God said they'll shoot you just for praying for somebody if you don't belong to them. Hello. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Hallelujah. But here, Revelations 10:7, but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin the sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared unto his servants the prophets. Revelations 1 and3, it says, "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things that are written therein, for the time is at hand." Man, how many believed? DID YOU AND I ARE BLESSED TO HEAR THE WORDS OF REVELATION? &gt;&gt; That's right. WE KNOW WHO THE ANTICHRIST IS. WE KNOW WHO THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS IS. WE KNOW WHO THE HARLOTS ARE. &gt;&gt; IT'S ANY CHURCH THAT CLAIMS TO BE MARRIED TO CHRIST AND will take their own belief over the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip around here. Maybe I can find something here. Brother Bam says, "Well, they say, well, my church, well, my church, I don't care what your church believes. If it's contrary to the word, stay away from it." &gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S CONTRARY TO MY FAITH. IT'S NOT WHAT I BELIEVE. WELL, WHO YOU MARRIED TO YOURSELF? YOU'RE GOING TO BE MARRIED TO SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; Either God or the devil. &gt;&gt; WELL, MY CHURCH DON'T TEACH IT. That's right. The Bible said that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. MARK 16, THESE SHINES SHALL FOLLOW THEM THAT BELIEVE. IF A CHURCH PREACHES DIFFERENT FROM THAT, DON'T YOU? YOU DIE TO THAT THING. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says, "I'm not just speaking to this local assembly. I'm speaking all across the nation. You must be dead to your first husband." Amen. Now, we're getting into the message just a little bit. Yeah. All right. I want to read it here. Time's going slow. I must be going fast. Romans 7. Romans 7. We'll just lay our foundation now. Is that okay? Paul says, "Know ye not that, brethren, I speak to them that know the law, how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth. For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law of her husband as long as he liveth. But if her husband be dead, she is loose from that law of her husband. So if then, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress. But if her husband be dead, she is free from that last law loss, so that she's no adulteress, though she be married to another man. Amen. Praise the Lord, brethren. Wherefore, my brethren, now notice, brother Paul is saying this now. He is really going to get to where he's really what he was really meaning. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law BY THE BODY OF CHRIST. that you should be married to another. Amen. Even to him who is raised from the dead. How many HAD TO BE MARRIED TO HIM? &gt;&gt; THAT WE SHOULD BRING FORTH FRUIT UNTO GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, let's read a few things that brother Bam said. Paul here giving illustration. He says about the scripture. He says, "This passage is seldom ever preached on because it's like marriage and divorce, but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce of how that he's trying to set in order a church. Can nobody more be married to the world than to Christ at the same time and to be legal about it?" He says, "May I add," and he was talking about DL Moody going out in the street, "DO YOU KNOW GRACE? DO YOU KNOW GRACE? GRACE WHAT? AMAZING GRACE. HOW sweet the sound. And brother Bram says, "May I this woman grace? May I place HER IN THE BIBLE?" She's also called the ELECT LADY. THIS MISS GRACE I'M going to talk about. The Bible declares that she is the elect lady. Notice elect comes from elected lady like the virgin forth that was SUPPOSED TO BRING FORTH THE BODY OF GOD ON EARTH. SHE WAS AN ELECTED WOMAN. AND ALSO GOD HAS chosen an elected lady WHICH IS HIS BRIDE. She's elected. I hope that we're members of that tonight across the world across the nation rather rather. Now Paul says here listen young girls listen to this carefully. You're going to be accountable for what you're fixing to hear because I'm here to tell you that there's a lot of message girls that have been raised. They've heard this and they have broken this. All right? So be very careful. Make sure that the man that you choose is the man you want to live with. And if you marry him, if it's bad or good, you better make the best of it. Hello. &gt;&gt; But Paul says here saying that a woman cannot remarry until her host first husband is dead. She cannot remarry as long as her h first husband is living. And she by no circumstances at all she must remain single as long as her husband is living. If she should do such a sin, she shall be called an adulteress. He says, "And I'm speaking of the natural nile." Now, to type it with the spiritual, we'll get into that in a minute. If this woman would commit such a thing that she is marked an adulteress, if she has two living husbands at the same time, therefore she has forfeit it. And by DOING THIS, HER RIGHTS to God in heaven. By doing so, she has she IS AN OUTCAST FROM THE ECONOMY OF GOD ACCORDING TO SCRIPTURES THAT I'VE JUST READ. HELLO. How in the world are you ever going to straighten something like that out? Let me tell you something. I don't say that God can't save you. I don't know. Now, according to this, you're done. Hello. It's pretty strong, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It's what Paul said. So is this church. Listen, when she tries to mix creeds and denominations with the word of God, she can't be married to a denomination and be the bride of Christ at the SAME TIME. SHE'S GOT TO BE DEAD TO ONE OR THE OTHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Y'all are getting quiet on me now. &gt;&gt; It's right there. It's not my word. &gt;&gt; It's what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. I may not like it. You might not like it, but it's still the truth. &gt;&gt; Listen, ANOTHER QUOTE NOW. YOU CANNOT MIX DENOMINATIONAL CREED WITH THE WORD BECAUSE THEY'RE CONTRARY one to another. &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SATAN TRIED TO DO IN THE INTELLECTUAL conception of Eden, EVE. ISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHAT HE DID to Eve? &gt;&gt; That's right. He mixed it. Just put a little bit of his own in there. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone. Jesus said, "But by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God shall man live by." &gt;&gt; In the end of the Bible, he says, "If any man adds to this word or takes away, HIS PART WILL BE TAKEN out of the book of life." Amen. All right. So now notice and that's what creed has done tonight. Denomination has separated the people from the word of God. Even Jesus says through haven't you through your traditions made the commandments of God of none effect to the people. &gt;&gt; AMEN. PEOPLE TELL YOU OH WELL WE DON'T BELIEVE IN PROPHETS. WE TEACH OUR PEOPLE THAT JESUS WAS THE you just made the word of God of none effect to them people. &gt;&gt; Now they won't believe in it. They'll never receive the benefit of it, the blessing of it. Amen. Oh my. Now notice he says now she as a woman if she is married to Christ the word she cannot be married to a church denomination at the same time for she's bound by it. SHE CANNOT LIVE WITH both husbands at the same time. They're contrary one to the other. ONE IS GOD sent and the other one is man-made. So they're contrary. See let every word's man's man's word be a lie and mind the truth. They're just as contrary one to another as law is from grace. Paul's speaking here. One must be dead to have the other. If she tries to mix them, she shall be called an adulteress. Oh, think of it, New York, Arizona, across the nation. Think of it. GOD SAID IF SHE'S MARRIED TO TO TWO AT THE SAME TIME, SHE SHALL BE CALLED AN ADULTERESS. WHAT ADULTERESS CAN ENTER HEAVEN? GOD IS NOT GOING TO MARRY AN ADULTERESS. YEAH. &gt;&gt; Now some of these MESSAGE YOU DIDN'T HEAR THIS BEFORE 63 AND BEFORE AMEN. CHRIST WAS PUT OUT. &gt;&gt; HE SAID FIND YOU A GOOD CHURCH. THERE'S PLENTY OF GOOD CHURCHES TO GO TO. BUT THE AFTER THAT AFTER THAT THEY TURNED CHRIST OUT. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? THEN GOD SPEWED THEM OUT. Oh that's right. And then it was time to come out. &gt;&gt; How many believe? then it was time to come out. Don't think that you're going to be in a denominational system and be the bride of Christ at the same time. It's contrary to prophet of God, contrary to the scriptures. &gt;&gt; No, you're going to go into tribulation period. Amen. All right. Arizona nations, she can't be married to both at the same time. He won't marry an adulteress. And then he said, "Well, you say my church says, I don't care what your church teaches. What does the word teach?" Amen. Listen, I'm sitting here looking at a dear old woman, Sister Shreder. Many of you women back there and Sister Moore over here, older sister remembers a few years ago. If their mother even if their Hold on. If their MOTHER OR EVEN THEM WOULD HAVE WALKED OUT IN THE STREETS THE WAY THAT THESE WOMEN do today, church members, they'd have them locked up them women for being insane. She forgot to put on her skirt. Well, better was saying, "Look at the conditions of the women and you'll see THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH." &gt;&gt; AMEN. She put forgot to put on her skirt. Well, if it was insane then, it's insane now. This is where he SAYS THAT WE WELL, LOOK, THE WHOLE world proves it's insane. &gt;&gt; How many believes he believes that the world has gone insane? &gt;&gt; Complete insanity. &gt;&gt; You know, I wonder something. I wonder if God would have never said uh that he created male and female, man, and woman created he them. If he'd have never said that, they'd have probably not never tried this transgender stuff. Why? Because all these transgenders just again, brother Bam says the devil hates Genesis and Revelations more than any two books in the Bible. Because Genesis proves, you know, the beginning and how things were made. And what does he do? There is no certain gender. Yes, there is. &gt;&gt; Why? All they're trying to do is this. It's the devil is what it is. &gt;&gt; It ain't nothing but the devil. Why do you think the leftist people, AMEN, WOULD LIKE TO SHOOT YOU? THEY WILL shoot you. They did. Kirk tried to Trump. Hello. HOW MANY KNOWS THIS SPIRIT THAT'S ON THEM, IT'S an evil, wicked spirit. &gt;&gt; YOU LET A YOU LET SOMEBODY DOING A DOCUMENTARY or just SEEING HOW BOTH SIDES ARE AND THEY'LL GO OVER TO THE left side in this in a certain street and see how they are and maybe disagree with them A LITTLE. GET OUT OF HERE. YOU YOU GO GO SOMEWHERE AND DIE OR WHATEVER IT IS, RIGHT? THERE'S LIKE this and go over to Trump's side or the other SIDE AND THEY'RE LIKE, "COME ON IN. SOMEBODY WE I KNOW YOU MIGHT SEE IT A little bit. Come on in here. You know, just be, you know, they're nice and friendly folks. That tells the spirit behind it. Ain't that right? See what kind of spirit it is. But I'm here to tell you, THE WHOLE WORLD IS GOING IN. LOOK AT THE murders and things that's going on now in the world. We've had one not so long ago. Ain't that right? He see it's insanity. He says, and then he MAKES A STATEMENT, THE COMPLETE TOTAL INSANITY OF this world that we're going into RIGHT AWAY. IT'S ALMOST THERE NOW. And it's marching right out in the street and it's coming right into the church pew. Total insanity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I don't want no woman coming in here in her spandex or her tights and stuff without the skirt. &gt;&gt; That's right. You sisters don't make me do it. You go take her in the back room and says, "Let me give you a skirt." Why? Because it's insanity coming right into the pews. Did you forget to put your skirt on? How many knows you go anywhere almost out there anymore? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Insanity. And where is it? Did preachers come up here and they don't preach against it? &gt;&gt; Do they come up here and say, "We don't want that kind of stuff in here. We want you in here, but dress right? Dress like you're going to meet God." That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. Because you're not going to a prostitute's house. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; I know you do. All right. Complete insanity this world is going into right almost there right now. Amen. Doing things that human people wouldn't think of doing. Ain't that right? Praise the Lord. Brother Bam says, you know that he goes to talking about a woman, how to if she won't have a baby for her husband, she'll take a dog or a cat or something. Amen. That's if she won't ain't there ain't no sister that ought not to have a baby for her husband. Ain't that right? Nothing wrong with have a dog or cat, but don't refuse to have babies by your children. I could talk to you later about that. You could be in a whole lot of trouble for it. &gt;&gt; A whole lot of trouble for it. Amen. But anyway, and so he says, "Look, Hollywood teaches that you don't want to be a mother. Why? Because it'll disfigure you. You won't look as good as maybe what you did before and all this, that, or the other." And he says that's a true picture of the modern church. You know, neither does this modern church want any of these screaming and shouting and tongue speaking. Acts 238 youngman's around her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? WE DON'T MIND A LITTLE SCREAMING. We don't mind A LITTLE SHOUTING. THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S GOING TO GET NOISY AT THE HOUSE AFTER A WHILE, Brother Gersham. AMEN. THINK ABOUT IT. THAT'S RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CHILDREN AND MAN, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THEY GET NOISY. WOO! I don't mind IT WHEN THEM KIDS GO OUT HERE AND THEY SCREAM A LITTLE, HAVE A LITTLE FUN. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. THAT'S THE WAY YOU AND I DO WHEN WE COME INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD. WE ENJOY THE PRESENCE OF GOD. WE ENJOY THE WORD OF GOD. And I ain't got to worry about preaching it too hard for you. You think I preach it hard? LET ME PLAY YOU A tape &gt;&gt; cuz that's where I read it out of. Brother Brandham was hard. Now &gt;&gt; folks, I ain't never taken a bar of barrel slat and beat my son so that he couldn't get up off the bed for two weeks. And that some of the things better said. Mama would to get a hold of her daughter if she got out there and come home all twisted up and everything else. She wouldn't get up out of bed for a while. He preached it hard. &gt;&gt; Can I preach? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. GOD SAID IN THE LEODYSIA CHURCH, HE SAYS, "AS MANY AS I LOVE, I REBUKE AND I CHASEN." SO WE DON'T MIND CORRECTION IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. WE DON'T MIND THE SAME PREACHER STEPPING ON OUR FEET A LITTLE BIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. I DON'T MAKE YOU MAD AND CAUSE YOU TO WALK OUT. YOU CLAP TO THE TRUTH. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ELECT. YOU'RE THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; ONLY THE BRIDE CAN TAKE THIS KIND OF DOSE. WOO! GIDEON, THIS MEDICINE IS POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOOD. IT'S PURE. I WANT THE good stuff. DON'T GIVE ME NO WATERED DOWN VERSION. DON'T GIVE ME A SYNTHETIC BRAND. GIVE ME THE GOOD STUFF. &gt;&gt; GIVE ME THE PURE STUFF. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll make you jump up and click your heels together. &gt;&gt; All right. We don't mind it. She may not want it. And it is hooping and crying and screaming and amen and hallelujah. That around says amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; MAN, I AM SO THANKFUL, BROTHER GERSHAM, to have a church that's alive. &gt;&gt; A CHURCH THAT'S GOT THE HOLY GHOST. I'M THANKFUL FOR EVENING NIGHT TABERNACLE. I'M THANKFUL FOR WHAT GOD IS DOING IN YOUR LIFE AND IN MY LIFE. GOD IS REAL. BROTHER BRAD MENTIONED, "YOU AIN'T GOT TO WORRY. JUST TRUST THE LORD. COMMIT YOURSELF TO GOD." HOW MANY DAYS GOT DONE THAT WAY? AMEN. COME ON. JUST PUT IT ON uh not cruise control. What's &gt;&gt; autopilot? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRAD ON AUTOPILOT. WE BROTHER SAYS, YOU KNOW, BUT WE GO CHRISTIANS JUST DO THINGS AUTOMATICALLY. &gt;&gt; NOT MANUALLY, BUT AUTOMATICALLY. AND I SAYS, MAN, WE WENT BEYOND AUTOMATIC. WE WENT AMEN TO AUTOMATIC CONTROL. &gt;&gt; Just put it on autopilot. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; People scared of autopilot. &gt;&gt; Scared of all of I probably would be. I'll probably be one that says, "Hey, you get that off of there. You know, I'll be honest with you. They have these brake systems that are that won't let you stop real quick, right? Anti-skid. AND GUESS I I NEEDED TO STOP QUICK, FOLKS. And I CAME TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THEM BOUNCY THINGS HIT IT AND I WAS I I hit that BRAKES AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO HIT. WHAT I WAS GOING TO HIT CUZ IT WOULDN'T LET ME STOP. I said I was JUST LET ME SQUEAL MY TIRES. JUST LET ME SLIDE, BUT I WANT TO GET STOPPED. &gt;&gt; That's one time I HATED THAT AUTOMATIC ANTI-SKID STUFF. COME ON, PEOPLE. I can understand it, I guess. Trying to be a little bit smart here. If it was wet, right? If it was wet, you might want that to where you don't just hydroplane, you know? But if it's dry, I don't mind sliding. I guarantee you it's going to stop faster than the anti-skid stuff will let me do. Amen. That was totally free. But I like that. I thought, Lord, help us. When we come up the Red Seas, put it on autopilot. When you don't know how to get over it, get under it. You can't do no more. Get your hands off of it &gt;&gt; AND LET GOD DO IT. BROTHER SAYS, "JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH GOD TAKE YOU THROUGH." &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT A CONGREGATION LIKE THAT, BROTHER BRAD. AMEN. AND WHEN YOU COME UP TO GREAT TRIALS, AMEN. THINGS YOU CAN'T GET OVER, YOU CAN'T GET UNDER, THEN JUST TRUST GOD. &gt;&gt; JUST COMMIT IT TO GOD. DON'T GO ON A RAMPAGE. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to go there. That's a little personal. But people when you don't do like what they want to do, they're come at you almost. Hello. &gt;&gt; Don't go at them. Just commit it to God. &gt;&gt; If you want something, trust God in it. &gt;&gt; I give you a little p taste of it anyway. All right. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's go on. We're not supposed to go as long since we don't have Sunday school, but that's okay, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Get you more food. NOTICE WHO SHE LOVES. WATCH her lover. You want to see who she's in love with? The word says this, BUT SHE SAYS, "MY CHURCH TEACHES THIS." HELLO. I MEAN, ANYTIME A PERSON THAT SAYS, "I KNOW THE WORD SAYS THAT, but I no." Who are you IN LOVE WITH? &gt;&gt; WHO ARE WE IN LOVE WITH THIS MORNING? WE'RE IN LOVE with the word. WE DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAYS. I DON'T CARE WHAT COMES THROUGH MY MIND. JUST GET IT ON OUT. LET EVERY THOUGHT IN MY MIND BE A LIE IN GOD'S WORD. THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; We can tell who she loves. My church says this. Then who is she in love with? Who is her husband? Her fruits proves who she is. Exactly right. Shows who she is. And another thing, notice what kind of children she's bearing. That tells her who her papy is. LIKE THE FIRST ADAM OR THE SECOND ADAM. AMEN. LISTEN, her daughters, THEIR PAINTED FACE, BOBBED HAIR, WOMEN CLOTHES, TROUSERS, CUTS her hair, AND IT'S A SHAME FOR HER TO DO SO. BROTHER RANDOM goes on, LOOK AT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. LOOK AT WHAT THEY ACT LIKE. SH. She says sh. She don't like none of this screaming. The preacher, you ain't got to scream at me. I got perfectly 2020 hearing. 2020 hearing. You know what I mean, right? Yeah. It's supposed to be vision, but in other words, I can hear perfectly good. Some old lady comes and visits a Baptist church or something on the back, remember? And the daughter married some boy from the city and there they went to a city church and and she they didn't want to take her, but they, you know, just let's go over to their church. And they went to their church and preacher says, "Now Jesus Christ came to save sinners." Amen, preacher. That's right. wants them to be quiet. &gt;&gt; They like quietness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Did that BOTHER ANYBODY? &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; OH, I'll tell you what. When that woman screamed in the back of the church, the man said, "It sends shivers up my back." But when he goes to the ballpark, he'll pull hats DOWN OVER HIS HAT. SENDS SHIVERS. IT MAKES ME FREEZE when somebody screams or holler or some woman goes. &gt;&gt; Sorry, it's not quite sharp enough, but anyway. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BROTHER? SAID, "MAN, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ONE THING. IF YOU GET TO HEAVEN, YOU'RE GONNA FREEZE TO DEATH. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MORE CHILLS COMING UP YOUR SPINE YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. &gt;&gt; But don't you worry about being there." Hello. We ain't going to have no chillers in heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. Ain't nobody going to be THERE WITH CHILLS RUNNING UP THEIR SPINE. WHY? CUZ THEY AIN'T GOING TO BE THERE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING TO BE DOING. THERE'S GOING TO BE SCREAMING. THERE'S GOING TO BE SHOUTING. THERE'S GOING TO BE REJOICING. THERE'S going to be dancing. THERE'S GOING TO BE SHOUTING. WOO! THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN HEAVEN. THERE'S GOING TO BE JUMPING. WOO! YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN HEAVEN. BROTHER, DADDY, WE'RE GOING TO BE OURSELVES. BROTHER SEAN, WE'RE GOING TO JUST BE OURSELVES. BE OURSELVES. My mama, I got to quit. I'm going to get carried away before I get carried away. Oh my. Don't you believe that though? &gt;&gt; But they want it stagnant. They love stagnation. Brother Ram says they love sistns that's got wiggle tails in it. When they go to church, here's a new one fresh. When they go to church and the preacher pours out a glass of water for you, brother Sean. Here's a cup of water. And there's a bunch of little wiggle tails. Boom. Bunch of them things in there. Few of them little water spiders. Let me explain what that water wiggle tail is. That wiggle tail is now God don't care how you dress. God looks at the inside. He looks at the heart. Now it doesn't really matter if you trim your hair. There's a real wiggler right there. Now it's okay for you to wear some makeup. Another wiggler. &gt;&gt; Amen. I LIKE THAT PREACHER IS WHAT a lot of THEM SISTERS BACK THERE. I LIKE THAT GUY. LET'S VOTE HIM IN. Let's keep that preacher. I like him. Bible never did say that, you know, women couldn't wear trousers. Liar. Right. &gt;&gt; Woman that woman that wears a garment pertains to man's an abomination in the sight of God. What did brother Bram said? It was an abomination. I believe he described it as one of them filthy bathrooms you go into that you just you really got to use the bathroom. But man, let's go down another exit. Let's find a good truck stop where maybe they'll keep it a little cleaner cuz this place right here, they don't care nothing about their bathrooms. An abomination. That's what it smells like to God. It's an abomination in the sight of God. Let me tell you something. How many believes that these churches that don't have any enthusiasm, they don't have any zeal anymore. Amen. It's just become A TRADITION. WHAT DID GOD SAY? You come to church. Well, I guess it's Wednesday. I guess it's Sunday. We better go down to church. God says, "That stinks to me." When you just do it out of a tradition, it come a stench in my nostril. Sure, it's the right thing to do. Sure. BUT YOU AIN'T GOT IT. YOU GOT A STINKING ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; AN ATTITUDE THAT IT'S JUST, WELL, WE'RE JUST GOING TO HEAR BROTHER BER AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR BROTHER BRAD. NO, COME ON. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, IF YOU REALLY PULL FROM GOD, HE'LL HE'LL CHANNEL THIS. HE'LL CAUSE ME TO SAY SOMETHING YOU NEED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S RIGHT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, BOYS? The Lord spoke to me back there. I feel like he did. Impressed upon my heart. Wayne kids, all of our young people, I've got something for you. &gt;&gt; You know what it is? You need to learn to snuggle with Jesus. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember John the Revelator, how that he got leaned on the bosom of Christ. &gt;&gt; What is that on his chest? &gt;&gt; Would that be his chest? &gt;&gt; We scoot over a little bit. So he loved Jesus so much he just Oh man, I love you, Michael. I just love you. You forgive me. Correct me after church if I'm wrong. I'll repent next service. But he said he went to the lady on the bosom of Christ. He was laid on his bosom. He loved Jesus. He was a person of love. He didn't mind expressing. You didn't see Peter doing it. But why? And you know what what I'm meaning by that is your parents probably pray with you. Mom and dad pray with you. But I'm here to tell you as soon as possible, you want to have your own little quiet secret prayer place. that little place that you go by yourself somewhere and say, "Jesus, I just want you to know I love you, Lord. I got to go through school. I got to do this. I got to do that. And I want you to just be with me." Man, I'm telling you, some of them kids are mean, and I I got to I got to keep my Holy Ghost. So, Lord, help me. Hello. I'm being cuddled by having your own prayer life. How many will do that? Say, have your own little experience, your own prayer life. Thank you, Lord. cuz that's where your strength lays. Can't just go off mom and dad's experience. You got to have your own experience. The sooner you do that, the better off you'll be. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it'll make you stronger in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Y'all about ready for the good stuff? &gt;&gt; All right. All right. So there the towards the end is when he was speaking make the statement I'm not just talking to my local assembly here but across the nation you've got to be dead to your first husband if you're united to Christ and married to a denomination you're an adulteress you are leadya amen in other words you're still in them churches you still held to their traditions and you're leadyan wretched poor miserable blind and naked it and don't know it. Amen. &gt;&gt; A church across the nation, we're following Jesus Christ, the word. &gt;&gt; How many believe that that's what brother Brandon came for is to bring us back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be the bride, you have to be remarried to the word of God, which is Christ. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God, and the word was God. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Amen. I read this to our brothers up in Ohio. It's the old I dress Amish and everything. I said, "As long as you hold to man's tradition of denominations, you are called in God's word an adulteress." How many believes this? You got to get away from traditions of man. &gt;&gt; You are God's bride now. You'll dress the way God wants you to dress. You'll think the way God wants you to do, not the way you want to do. Amen. And as long as you're a denomination seeker belonging to denominational church that denies the word, you are an adulteress. You see why brother Benam IS SAYING ALL YOU I'M GREETING YOU ALL THE WAY ACROSS EVERYWHERE. I WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS. AS LONG NOW AS LONG AS YOU'RE A PART OF THAT, YOU'RE AN ADULTERESS. THAT WAS A WHOLE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. How many believes he was a stronger language? &gt;&gt; And yet it was his thanksgiving message. His thanksgiving message. Amen. Jesus says you can't serve God and mammon at the same time. You can't be virtuous to Christ, the word of God, and serve a man-made denomination at the same time. Those were strong words for that day. How many believes that Pentecost and all them still in full swing? And then he comes and makes these statements in the midst of it all. They put him out and I and I I'll I'll read you a quote and this quote almost matches perfectly in uh not thinking man's filter or lean not to your own understanding when he spoke about how that they had put him out in in uh Tucson wouldn't have him back but he or this brother did over here in Louisiana. Okay. You can't be to Christ the word and serve a man-made denomination at the same time. It's contrary to the word. Paul sit there. Now notice then he says take a good look for a moment. Here he is brother Brandham trying to get them to have a conscience and think a little. He says look for a moment with your own spiritual EYESIGHT AT YOUR SOUL. JUST look around. I'm speaking across the nation now. Just look a few minutes. You out at Brandom Tabernacle. You out at the Tabernacles West Coast, Arizona, wherever you're at, look at yourself for a few minutes. I'm going to stop right there and say, how many believes that I want to God does it to me. I thank God that that Holy Spirit in my life, I hear his voice much plainer than I used to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray that God will allow you to look at yourself. How many believe every one of us need the Holy Spirit to get you to look at yourself &gt;&gt; to see where you are? Now, I'm not saying that you look at your faults and get all down. No. Look, the Holy Spirit will show you the condition that you're in. &gt;&gt; The preacher can't do it. You have to search that out yourself. The Holy Spirit, that still small voice, will tell you where you're at. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many knows that it is of absolute utmost importance that you listen to that voice? &gt;&gt; Young people get used to that voice. That little voice that tells you what's right and what's wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. What you should or shouldn't do, should or shouldn't think. He was telling them, "Look at yourself for a few minutes." You say, "The message you're preaching, Brother Brandham, IS WRONG." LOOK at yourself a little bit. Let the Holy Spirit search your minds with the word. You'll agree with the message that let Christ, the anointed word, search out your own conscience. Let him get into you. See if that's right or not. That's just one thing of many that I've mentioned with hundreds of them, mentioning women bobbing their hair, wearing pants, and all these other things that they were. Look at yourself. Does the Bible agree with woman bobbing her hair? &gt;&gt; No. The congregation says, "Does the Bible believe in three baptisms of Father, Son, the Holy Ghost?" Congregation says, "No. No such a thing. The Bible agree with women wearing clemen's clothes?" NO. WELL, JUST TAKE THEM THREE. There's hundreds. Just search it out with God's word. Next, he says, "Now you say, well, what's this all got to do with thanksgiving? What are you talking about, Brother Benham? Here it is. Quarter in the nine. You didn't say nothing about Thanksgiving. What a message. What a message for the occasion to me. Yes indeed. The pilgrims fathers were very thankful for their newfound way of life. &gt;&gt; How many glad we are like pilgrims coming out of a Amen. a bunch of England tradition traditions of churches and everything else. Now we found the new way. &gt;&gt; Amen. The right way. being separated from the old English denominations decreed they would marry to the new anointed word for their age. That's right. He says the new new anointed word of the age. So can we be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separated ourselves from the things of the world all of our associates. Abraham was a pilgrim. God has separated us from all the dead religions. Amen. I'm speaking across the nations now. All the dead creeds. AND TO WHAT? TO SEPARATE US AND OPEN US TO GO INTO A NEW LAND, A NEW MESSAGE FOR a new day. &gt;&gt; How many believe, man, I'll tell you what, I've got another whole page on on what he's brought us into. How many are so thankful what God has taken us out of and what he's taken us into. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. you separated from your first union by spiritual death. Now you are born again or be uh or remarried again to the new spiritual union. NOT THAT OLD NATURAL life of the things of the world, but the eternal, the gene that was in you from the beginning. And he goes to talking about the old book is gone. Amen. And the old life is gone. It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness. How many believes that? He says, "And then now he says, Amen. Now the word justified is that you never done it in the first place. Here's a little heavier part even. IT'S NOT EVEN REGARDED AT ALL. &gt;&gt; How is it done in God's book of sea of forgetfulness? Your old book of marriage of is divorced and dead. It's not even in memories of God. You're justified. Amen. You was accused. YOU WAS ACCUSED. BUT YOU NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HOW MANY WE WE WEREN'T TAUGHT THIS IN PENTECOST. WE WEREN'T TAUGHT THIS IN THE AMISH or the Menanite or this the other. BUT WHEN WE COME OUT TO THE PURE WORD OF GOD, THEN THE PURE WORD OF GOD TAKES OUR SINS. HE TAKES OUR ENTIRE PAST. AMEN. HE PUTS IN the sea of forgetfulness and he MAKES IT AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT'S THE GREAT MESSAGE OF THANKSGIVING THAT BROTHER RAM SAYS THAT'S WHAT I'M MORE THANKFUL FOR THAN ANYTHING THAT OUR SINS ARE GONE. OUR PAST IS GONE. WE'RE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST NOW. WE ARE HIS. He bore my shame. It wasn't your fault. Eve is the one that did it. The devil and you were trapped into it. You were deceived in it. Let me come back to this. Listen. And he could say this. Now, I might just I don't really like to, but my thought, let me let me put my thought on it. How could Brother Brandon preach this as long as denominations were still alive? Huh? How many knows Christ was in those churches? God Christ was working in the churches. They were pe people was coming in. Whole colleges would come in. In other words, the old husband wasn't dead yet. But he makes a decl declaration. Now know and so do every one of us know that the whole rank, he didn't say this earlier in his ministry. The whole rank of denominations, Pentecostals and all are dead. They're dead. That's what he said. That is to the bornag again Christian message. Your husband is dead. YOU KNOW HE'S DEAD. GOD LET IT DIE. IT'S FINISHED. All the scientific, educational, intellectual, scientific ways, Bible schools and things is perished. Amen. So, Brother Brandham declares that that husband that we were married to is dead. Now, now, how many knows that in order for that to really be dead to you, you got to be coming out of it? &gt;&gt; Didn't Brother Bam say that they're morgs? &gt;&gt; Those churches are morgs. God help. Have mercy. God wake somebody up that listens to this streaming that's in a denomination. &gt;&gt; God has declared that it's dead. The prophet of God vindicated prophet of God declared it's dead. Amen. Now, in closing, it's getting late. He says, and so forth, we're going to have to be out in 30 minute minutes. this saying this saying this now this goes across the nation New York it's 25 minutes till 11 way up in Philadelphia around up in there those dear saints sitting there listening right now IN CHURCHES ALL AROUND WAY UP WAY UP IN Mexico and Canada and all around across 200 miles within North America and continent almost people as it IS LISTENING NOW THOUSANDS TIMES THOUSANDS LISTENING that's my message to you church you that's in a union a spiritual union with THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY ALL THE WAY TO EVENING NIGHT TABERNACLE ALL THE WAY TO 2025? I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE IN A UNION WITH THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; That you're DEAD TO YOUR OLD HUSBANDS. YOU'RE BORN A NEW. DON'T TRY TO DIG HIM UP. &gt;&gt; FOLKS, I've been in churches where they say, "Yeah, we believe Brother Brandham. Yeah, we believe the message, but we don't mention his name because people would be offended. Who was it? Some preacher said that some of these ministers that were told that Brother Brandham was wrong on this and wrong on that and that if they would just not teach Brother Brandham's ministry, their churches would grow and they PEOPLE WOULD FLOCK TO THEM. Now they just got a smaller group yet. They got nothing. Can I say you've been scammed? &gt;&gt; You have been scammed by the devil. Don't try to dig him up. DON'T TRY TO HAVE HIM ALIVE YET. Be married to that denomination AND MARRY A MET. NO, YOU DECLARE THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR. IF IT OFFENDS SOMEBODY, WELL, I'm sorry. Not really. But I'm not sorry for preaching the message. You want to be offended, be offended. That's up to you. I REALLY DON'T CARE. I CARE ABOUT ONE THING, AND THAT'S TELLING THE TRUTH. I'M MARRIED TO CHRIST and I ain't married to nothing else. I DON'T WANT NOTHING ELSE. YOU SHOULDN'T WANT NOTHING ELSE. AND IF YOU'RE ASHAMED OF IT AND YOU'RE TRYING TO COMBINE THE TWO, YOU'RE AN ADULTERESS. &gt;&gt; Come on. Get out THERE AND HAVE SOME BACKBONE. IF IT'S THE TRUTH, SAY IT. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE ASHAMED OF IT. &gt;&gt; You know what? I'd like I think we have a I'll say it at this time. We have an average about 60 or so streamers. I'd like to hear I'd like to have some feedback from those streamers. Amen. I know my brother Moes, Andrew, his son, and I greet them this morning. They've been listening to me regular giving comments on it. I led Moes to the Lord when we was first come into the message, him and Mooney. But there's a lot of them out there. Now, I'm curious. How many How many here cares about our streamers? &gt;&gt; That's right. We care about our streamers. You wouldn't be streaming this if there wasn't something down in your heart. I trust there's a rebound &gt;&gt; to our streamers. Something that bounces back that says, "Yeah, that sounds right. That's the truth." &gt;&gt; Cuz that's ALL I WANT IS THE TRUTH. IF I'M WRONG, HOW MANY BELIEVES IF I'M WRONG, I'M YOU obligated to correct me. I want to be right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz I'm not deserving of correcting unless I'm willing to be corrected. But that's what he said under a vindicated prophet. Listen, he says to Philadelphia, all of them, a union, you're dead to those husbands, born a new, don't try to dig him up. He's dead. IF YOU'RE A BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN, THAT LITTLE GERM that was predestinated IN YOU, IT'S WORD COMING TO WORD ON word on word on word, COMING TO THE FULL STATURE OF CHRIST. THAT'S RIGHT. SO THAT HE CAN COME AND GET HIS BRIDE. NOW WE'RE JUST READY FOR ONE THING AND THAT'S THE COMING OF THE LORD. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE WE STAND? LOOK AT HOW MUCH PROGRESS WE'VE MADE. LOOK AT WHERE WE'VE COME FROM THE 1965. AMEN. IT'S WORD UPON WORD. THAT'S WHY I WANT TO SAY I WE NEED THE STATUE OF THE PERFECT MAN. WE NEED AMEN PAUL A PRISONER. WE NEED THE GREATEST BATTLE EVER FOUGHT. WE NEED THESE MESSAGES. THESE MESSAGES IS WHAT PERFECTS US. IT'S WHAT BRINGS US TO A CLOSER WALK WITH GOD. WE BECOME A COMPLETE PRISONER TO JESUS CHRIST. WE'RE MARRIED TO HIM. He's our lover. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Final quote. Brother Bram says, "And you ministers down there in Tucson tonight, I don't hold you responsible for that. God does. I was there three years. I told you I wouldn't start a church. I didn't. Brother Perry Green started it. I was there three years. Let me just give you a little background on that. See, when Brother Brandon went to Tucson and was preaching, they didn't want him to start a church. Why? Because they had their little groups and they didn't want them no more. Jealous, greedy. What in the world was the attitude about? Why wouldn't you want a prophet of God to start a church? So, Brother Brandham didn't do it, but he was very glad that Perry Green did. And so, he could say, "I didn't start it, but if Perry Green started it, but for them to be that way, it just shows Pharah's sake, jealousy, pride." Okay. I was there three years and not one time did you invite me to your pulpit. I said in Tucson nearly three years, God will take me from the desert one of these days. This message must live. I tried my best to get into you. I know the reason you did it. You here? Only reason you did it. Your denomination would kick you out. And you know many of you has talked that I've talked to at the first restaurant and so forth. You know that's the truth. And the very next quote that brother Ram says when he's speaking, Amen. this morning, my message was both to hear and to those listening. He says the next quote he says after knowing that they had would not invite Jesus. How many knows brother Brandham could preach but then he'd have to wait for Christ to come on the scene &gt;&gt; and discern. And they didn't want that. It wasn't when they turned down the prophet, they turned down Jesus &gt;&gt; because that angel would never leave. Brother Brandham, how many knows he left or left him whether he was in his bedroom or wherever he was, that angel followed him everywhere. Amen. And if he he had to wait at the service and just until he began to move on him. Next quote, final quote that we're closing with, we won't keep you any longer. HE SAYS, "COME OUT OF IT. GET OUT OF THERE. COME OUT OF IT. GET OUT OF THERE, BROTHER. IF THERE'S ANY LIFE IN YOU, you'll be like that little eagle that I spoke of. You'll hear the word of God. Remember, you're going to hear this the last time one of these days. We're real close now. Amen. Amen. We're real close now. Come out of her, my people. Revelations 18. I don't know if I finished reading that, but he talks about that message that she has become the cage of every foul and unclean spirit. And he says, "Come out of her, my people." How many is glad to have heard that voice? "Come out of her, my people, that you receive not of her plagues, that you partake not of her sins. Don't be an adulteress like she is committing spiritual fornications against the word of God." God bless you. Stand this morning. How many wants to live pure and clean to the Lord Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you see the hands that are raised now, Father, and our hearts are bowed to you, God. We truly know that you have sent a message that was pure, that was clean, that was holy. It was your message, Lord. Your message of grace to the whole world, but they didn't want you. They don't want you. There's so many people, Lord, that don't want you. And when I think about that, God, all the different excuses people, oh, God, help those perhaps streaming this morning. Don't let the devil give you an excuse not to follow Christ with your whole heart. There is no real good excuse. The rich man, he had an excuse. He just couldn't do it. Give up his riches. God, help us this morning, Lord, to give everything up for you. We're not ashamed of you, but to give it all up for you, Lord Jesus, so that we can follow you holy, Lord. I pray for this congregation here this morning, this little church, Evening Light Tabernacle, every saint, every person, those streaming, God, that you'll help them search their hearts. Lord, prick their conscience. Help them ask themselves if they have added to taken away, or if they're more of a lover of themselves more than they are lovers of God. Help us to be, so to speak, fanatical about loving you instead of being fanatical about being a boaster and proud and and selfish, lovers of oursel. God, I pray, Lord, this morning, Lord Jesus, that you would help each one this morning under the sound of my voice, Lord, to rededicate their lives and say, "Lord Jesus, I rededicate myself a new, aresh to you, Lord. I'm your wife, Lord, and I won't let any thought come into my life. I won't be obedient to anything the devil tries to tell me. And he thought that he puts into my heart. I won't follow man's tradition. I won't follow my own ways cuz I want your ways. I will not be like Cain who worshiped you. But he offered up what he wanted to offer up. And if God didn't accept it, well, that's just the best that he could do. Lord, that's not the way we want. We don't want our way. We want your way. Lord, today we ask God that you would take, Lord, this congregation of group of people, Lord. Father, form us and mold us, Lord, into the image of Jesus Christ. Have us ready for that rapture that could happen just any day now, Lord. Lord, we believe that these scriptures, Lord, lightning's flash, the thunders rolled as it was in the days of Noah, Lord, if that door would have still been open, no doubt, but people would have run to that door and say, "I hear the thunder. I hear the flashing." And Lord Jesus, we see the signs around us. We see the woman in purple. We see the nations falling apart. We need we hear the lightning. We see the thunder and the mercy's doors still open. God, help people to run for mercy. Help them to run into the doors. Come into Jesus Christ quickly before it's too late, Lord. And then there will be those who have heard it that'll be in the tribulation period. and they'll say, "Oh, if I would have just accepted, if I would have just received it, I had my chance." Lord Jesus, I just pray, God, keep and bring everyone of your children into the fold just now. There's any in here that doesn't have the Holy Ghost, may they raise their hand and say, "God, I want the Holy Ghost right now. I need the Holy Ghost right now. I pray, Father, you'll come down as my hands go up. You come down into my heart. Forgive me of all my sins, my failures, Lord, and draw me closer to you, Lord. Father, in this Thanksgiving, Lord Jesus, as we're enjoying our times around our family, Lord, Father, we'll have a time, God, be the morning and we won't miss our prayer meetings, we won't mere miss our time with you, Lord Jesus. We won't get so carried away with the with the the holiday, God, that we neglect you, Lord Jesus. But we'll keep you alive. We'll keep you really fed, Lord Jesus. We'll feed on you. Amen. Let the Holy Spirit feed on the word God. Help everyone God today Lord to be so thankful Lord Jesus for what you have done in our generation Lord how you brought us out God. How you called us out. How did you forgave us and even AS YOUR PROPHET HAS said if you are believing every word, every jot, every tit. You are the virtuous bride of Jesus Christ. Not one sin, not one blat blot against you. But father, I believe that this message has come to bring us to that place that we are without spot according to Ephesians and without wrinkle. Lord, and that's what every hand that's up wants to be, God. We want to meet you, Lord. Not having our own righteousness, but yours, Father. We ask, God, that you bless now in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. God bless you. Amen. You love the Lord. Thank you for letting me go along, being patient. I trust the Holy Spirit. How many How many was spoken to this morning by the Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Now, let's give the Lord a hands for speaking to us. Say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus." Thank you, Jesus, for speaking to us this morning, Lord. God bless you. Have a wonderful thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's sing that little song. Do you know that? Are you washed by the water of the word? Do we have the words to that, brother Micah? Well, are you washed? Help me. By the water, oh my. Washed by the water of the word. Oh, are you washed by the water? Washed by a man. Once again, well, are you wash by the water? Oh, wash by the water of the world. Amen. My my voice and my memory are both gone this morning. Amen. It's been good to be in the house of the Lord. Remember us. We'll be going to Arkansas uh Wednesday for Thanksgiving and pray the Lord will give you all a a very wonderful Thanksgiving. And and you know, I I try to thank the Lord every day for his goodness and his mercy that he's done for me. And Amen. And you know, I I always think of that song that brother Steve and sister Becky sung that he give us another day. And he's just been so good to us this morning. And Amen. And Amen. God bless you. And also, I meant to make the announcement Sunday uh or this morning, the 21st of December will be our Christmas dinner. So remember that also. And Amen. God bless you and have a happy Thanksgiving. God bless you. And as you go and let's sing that little chorus, that song. Well, I've got so much to thank him for, so much to praise him for. You see, been so good to me.
