house of the Lord tonight we certainly uh thankful for the opportunity to be here it's been a been a week and Trust has been a good week for you but it's been a I guess you would say a hectic week for me just seems like one thing after another after another and maybe that's what we needed for this message tonight so uh you know we didn't didn't know what we were going to really speak on I had a thought on my mind and and then the Lord laid this on my mind so turn with me if you would uh we'll read just a quick portion of scripture and I'm going to let you have your seats uh we'll we'll read a quick portion of scripture out of Deuteronomy uh 18 and 15. just to kind of lay a foundation it's not going to be the core of our of our context tonight and and I don't plan on keeping you long so uh we're going to just kind of break down the word and study a little bit tonight and and see what the Lord what happened store for us so Deuteronomy chapter 18 and verse 15. it says the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy Brethren like unto me unto him ye shall hearken let's pray Heavenly Father we're just thankful Lord Jesus to be in your house tonight we're thankful for the word uh that that strengthens us it it leads us it guides us it teaches us the ways that you would have us to go there's nothing in this world that we can face that we can't find in this scriptures in the word you've laid it out before us as a road map and we're thankful for that Lord then another portion of the life of David and what David had went through through one of the most tremendous trials that that he could ever experience or ever did experience and and we can't even imagine but Lord we'll see that he he was the Lord and Lord we just want to want you to make us triumphant in our trials and Lord we just want to tell you we love you tonight we dedicate the service to you and we give you honor praise and glory in Jesus name amen you can have your seats as I said when I was praying I want to look at just a portion of David's life tonight and if I were title my message it would be Triumph in the trial and you say well you sure preach on that a lot well I've come to find out I've come to find out over time of studying the word for 25 years and and kind of digging in the word that our lives are in a cycle it's good it's bad it's good it's bad it's good and bad and I don't think we can ever get enough of that because I've come to realize that there's there's good and evil and and ups and downs and and today you may be on the Mountaintop and tomorrow you may be you may be crawling in the lowest Valley of your life we just don't know what tomorrow holds but one thing we do know we know the one that holds it and we can have confidence when we lay down at night that tomorrow is going to be another day and it may be another battle it may be another Victory but one way about it we win the war all right looking at David here and I'm going to start with what the prophet said in the in a message I'm going to read to you just a little bit here to to get started and and he's reading the identified Christ of all ages and he says he goes back to Deuteronomy 18 and he says the Lord your God shall rise up a prophet like and unto me so that scripture cannot be broken he said he had come to the son of man now that was for his age he was here on Earth and when he died and Rose and ascended he sent back the Holy Spirit and that was the son of God God is a spirit and through the Church age he's been Son of God and then the Millennium it's son of David sitting on the throne ruling he has ascended up he that overcomes shall sit with me on my Throne as I have overcome and sat down on my father's Throne he is sitting on the father first Throne now but in the Millennium he sets up on his own Throne because he is the son of David he's the son of man the Son of God the son of Davis see it's perfectly now we find out he had to come as a prophet the unchanging of his word god changes not like I said we're in a cycle we're constantly going and rounding around and God changes not if he was a Healer then he's a Healer now if he was a deliverer then he's a delicious savior the loss then he'll save the lost now he changes not but we can't forget that Satan also changes not he's here to defeat us it's his constant battle just to defeat us and he says David the great man made a mistake a man after God's Own Heart yet took Bathsheba thinking he could hide that from the very God that he had served all of his life but God exposed him by Nathan the prophet and he says yet look at David when he's going out and this is where we're going to get to our story exiled from his own people rejected King a rejected King now remember the types he said he had to be son of man Son of God and Son of David and he said well look at this he said he's the rejected King his own daughter had been ravished by her brother and the other brothers killed him and they was Absalom had raised up and separated had separated the Army calls in a revolution and David his own father was excommunicated we're talking about a serious hardship we're talking about some real stress here and he's been taken away and rejected by his people going out of the city this little crippled like fellow dragging along there making fun of him spitting on him do you see the relationship a rejected King being spit upon being mocked being made fun of David had to go through this by making fun of him and David's guard pulled his sword and said I let him alone let him alone God told him to do that whoa God told him to do that no doubt David didn't know what he was doing but he was walking up the same mound of Olives there and looked down weeping as a rejected King just like Jesus Christ it would come 800 years later a rejected King who sat there and watched him say father forgive them they know not what they do God told them to do that here he is he said a few hundred years after that Jesus on that same Mountain you see these things just portrayed he was part of it God doesn't change his nature doesn't change his character doesn't change he's still the word and Malachi 3 6 proves that he just changed his form from each age each age as a loved part of the word has been prophesied what happened for a certain day well as that age comes along God just moves into another form so we might say that if he's just moving into another form and David had to go through all those trials and David had to go through these hardships and God put him there to go through that and he's moving into a form into another age here we are at the End of the Age where does that put us what is God going to do he's going to move into you he's going to see if you're made to stand the test of time he's going to check and see can you Triumph in the trial can you and I make it through how are we going to make it through how did David make it through we'll find in the scriptures tonight and we'll see very clearly how David could lay his head down at night and sleep Psalms 3 if you'll turn there with me and this is where the bulk of our scripture will come from I found it kind of uh intriguing that I never seen where the Prophet preached on Psalms 3. he preached about the rejected King he preached about David he preached about Absalom and everything that led up to this but when we look at this scripture we'll read this we'll understand after tonight I hope we understand more I hope I hope you're blessed the way this scripture has blessed me Psalms 3 says Lord how are they increased that trouble me there are they that rise up against me how Satan loves to rise up against us how he loves to increase our troubles and how he loves to increase our trials he says many watch this many there be would say of my soul there is no help for him and God say that how many knows what sayla means it means pause and reflect on what was just said it means pause and reflect on what was said raise your hands to the sky and take notice and praise God and think about what just was said in the scriptures and he says there's people that's saying there's many that say of my soul there is no help for you and God how many of us have been in a place that we could say people looked at us and said God can't do nothing for them God can't fix their problems they just don't know my God and he says but thou O Lord are a shield for me you are my glory you're the lifter of my head will he read Glory here what David is saying it's a different kind of Glory than when we talk about the Magnificent God and the glory of God and the Throne of God the glory here when it guitars who a man is talking about confidence God you are my confidence you're what gives me strength you're what gives me my confidence God you are the lifter up of my head [Music] and he said I whispered unto the Lord no he said I Cried unto the Lord with my voice and he heard me out of his Holy Hill say lie I laid me down and slept I awake for the Lord sustained me I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves round about arise O Lord save me oh my God for thou has smitten all my enemies upon the cheekbone I like this next part thou has broken the teeth of the ungodly you ever wondered where that sound was I'm Gonna Knock your teeth out come from just found it he's broken the teeth of the ungodly salvation belongeth unto the Lord thou blessing is upon thy people say that so as we begin to look at the psalm here and we begin to read and we see this Psalm written by David and we're reading it already just we just by reading we find inspiration we find encouragement and we find that King David living a life of complete confidence in God during what was no doubt one of the greatest trials that he had ever faced in his entire life and brothers and sisters this very trial was the consequences of David's own actions sometimes we try to blame our trials on Satan sometimes we try to play blame him on God God just given me a trial to go through but many times it's ourself it's our own stinking thinking it's our own ways to get us into trouble and here is David finding himself and the suffering the consequences of his actions and into order to fully understand the extent of David's trial we have to look back into the book of second Samuel second Samuel chapter 13 through 18. it picks up where this Psalm originated if you want to study it out I all right I urge you to study it and read and take and and break it down because of chapter 13 of second Samuel M9 one of David's Sons he fell in love with what would have been his half-sister Tamar and he falls in love not so much a love like a husband and wife love but it was a passion it was a desire that he had that he had to be with Tamar and Tamar was the full sister of Absalom and so here we are Tamar is tricked I'm not says I gotta figure out how to get her into my Chambers so I'm going to play like I'm sick I'm going to play like I'm Ill and I'm going to tell my dad David I need somebody to come fix some food for me I'm not feeling well and I'm it can you send Tamar in here to make me some biscuits I need nourishment so David being the good dad since Tamarin Tamar begins to whip up some meals some fiddles some biscuits to feed him and as this is all happening she begins to take the the food over to him and amnon then looks at her and he grabs her and the Bible says he forces himself upon her and she says no don't do this don't force yourself on me this is not not legal this is not right by the laws this is not right at all Stop Don't Force he ravishes Tamar she leaves scarred broken and hurt Absalom her full brother then comes on the scene and says what has happened did he force himself on you yes so now Absalon seeks out to kill and to find and kill him not do you see how this plot is all going how did all this start with Bathsheba Take It on Back take it on back into the scriptures and it all started right there and David now David comes up here and he begins to look at this and he sees what happens he sees it Absalom has now killed and gone and it says that David well continually for his son and he can't get over the law of the Sun and so he vanishes and excommunicates absolutely out of his presence NOW Watch What Happens second Samuel 15. and it came to pass after this that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses and 50 men to run before him watch What's Happening Here and the Bible it tells us that there is none to be much as praised as Absalom I want you to see the character and the kind of Beauty and the person that this Epsilon man was and then you'll begin to realize how beautiful and how perfect it seems it seems that the devil is Satan is spy he's slick and the Bible tells us that Absalom was to be much praised because of his Beauty was from the soul of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him we're talking about handsome hunk here and this guy here has got everything going in his favor and it says Absalom watch how he begins to Snooker his way in he goes into the early in the morning he goes to sets at the gate and he sits at the gate and he waits for the people to come in who is going to go see the King King David and he sits outside the gate and he waits for him to come by and he says hey aren't you from one of the tribes of Israel yes I am I'm here to see the king and if you read on through you'll find out that he says oh I see see that I matters of good and right there's no man to depute but the king to hear thee and Absalon then says if I were judged in the land you see what he's doing if I were judged in the land every man which had a suit talking about a case or a lawsuit or a judgment something that he was coming to bring before the king he said every man might come to me and I would do him Justice you see how Satan slips in there David no longer is good enough they don't want it the absolutely I'm saying David can't do what I can do I can give you justice and Satan comes into our life and says God can't give you everything you want I can give you this I can give you happiness I can give you Joy I can give you pleasure I can give you peace I can make your life good and Absalon is saying the very same thing here I can do what David can't do so it tells me he's the greatest fine politician there ever was he's a politician standing out there he's he's looking for new new people to come and follow him and it says even so much that when people would come and put out their hand to him to shake his hand or to greet him he would kiss him you know oh yeah you're oh brothers You're so just pull him in reel them on in with his kindness and in the next part of the scripture says that Absalom stole the hearts of Israel hmm men who were who were devoted to King David men who served King David men who gave everything has now had their hearts stolen that's the way Satan does us if we're not careful we say we're Christians and we go to church and we do this and we love God and we serve God and we give our lives to God and then the absolute I say whatever comes sneaking in and he seals our hearts away and we have to be careful that we keep our governed up to say hey I'm a Christian and I do what God says and he stole their hearts away and Absalom continues his plot and continues his theme and he he leaves the country there for a little bit and it says he sent out spies you ever felt like you're being spied on just just say toilet paper in around your phone and you'll have Charmin and Huggies and everything will pop up on your on your ads I don't know where that came from but it just came but you ever feel like you're being spied on because that's what Satan does he begins to get into our lives he begins to look he begins to to tear us apart and kind of pick and say I wonder where he can fall here I wonder where I can get him to trip up over here I wonder if I put this out there yeah yeah yeah that catches his attention right there and the next thing you know things are beginning to be a broadcast that's you that you had no business being a part of and you find yourself captivated by what Satan has done by sending out spies to look into your life on a day-to-day basis they send out these spies now watch what he does Epsilon sent for a hit the field David's counselor David's right hand man the one David trusted with everything I think you'll find in one part of scripture I don't have it in my notes but I read it that David pretty much said God erase his memory because David didn't want this man giving everything that he knew because he knew everything there was to know about David he didn't want him giving Absalon all the information and now all of us now this is all coming around and the Bible says the conspiracy was strong the good and evil the good versus bad the conspiracy was strong in Absalom now is in the middle of this conspiracy and it's strong and it says the people increase continually with him so this Rue this Rebellion to overthrow the kingdom now comes to the attention of David one of his Messengers come to him and says David you're not going to believe this he's going to catch you so completely off guard I can promise you you have no idea what I'm about to tell you but David the hearts of the man of Israel are after Absalom now how would you feel if you were the king of a kingdom that God had given God had had placed you at Reign Over and now here comes somebody has come and began to take all the people and build it up against you and now all of a sudden all the hearts that once loved you and served you now they're going after the person who's out to kill you brothers and sisters is easy to see here that there is a major conspiracy and Absalom is not happy with David because of the way he handled the situation with Tamar so now he's out and he's determined I'm going to bring my father down and it's going to be to the death I'm going to kill him because that's the only way I can take over the kingdom he's got to die and so let me tell you tonight brothers and sisters let it be known that Satan is not happy with you or I either and Satan is determined that he's going to bring you down tonight just like Absalom was determined to bring King down so if you've ever found yourself at a point in life to where you're so beaten and so discouraged and you're so let down that the good news don't even encourage you have you ever been to a place like that you can be so down and so much in the gutter you're in that Valley I was talking about that somebody can come tell you some of the greatest news in your life huh because you're so beat down yours so hurt and there's no encouragement to be found David has to have found himself in this place and maybe I'm describing you today you know sometimes when it rains it pours it's one thing after another after another I'm not talking about the mountain we've all been on the mountain how many has been on the mountain those are fun times those are good times I'm talking about when you're down here scratching and you're digging in your clawing and you're thinking I don't know if I'm gonna make it through this and here's David in that very soon and and maybe you're in that same spot but I want you to know you're in love tonight because God wants you to lift up your head and he's lifted up the head of David and he said I want you to know that God can lift up your head and know that no matter what you're going through in life that God Is Bigger you can put anything in there you want God Is Bigger Than cancer God Is Bigger Than depression God Is Bigger Than anger God Is Bigger Than Temptation God is is bigger than marriage troubles God Is Bigger Than than death I said he's bigger than death because we live eternal and you can lay your head down with confidence knowing that the Lord will sustain you when we look at the Psalms chapter 3 here one of the only Psalms that you can tie to a specific incident in the life of David we can pinpoint exactly what David was going through when he wrote this song and when we look at this Psalm we look at this Psalm and we know that the Lord helps his troubled people okay there's an assurance there that simply says that God cares that God hears God does it forsake and in our lives we encounter these troubles and difficulties and discouragement is natural it's a natural response to these and and and to feel defeated and David is sitting here he has reason to feel that way but today God is sending a message to each one of us through the message of the hour and through this Psalms 3. if God don't change and God sees us and God cares for us and if your heads are hung low and you're beaten and discouraged God still loves you sometimes the hardest thing to go through in a trial the part of a trial is to understand and realize that no matter how big the trial is no matter how big the problem is God still loves us [Music] David done some terrible things God still loved it David is going through a most traumatic experience in his life God didn't say you're on your own buddy no he still cared when we look at this Psalm I want you to notice it's the first Psalm with a title when you look at the book in your Bible it will say a Psalm of David when he fled from Absalon his son that is part of the scripture that's part of the the wording it's a title it's written in the Hebrew text it's there for a reason it's to show you how important and how discouraging that this must be just imagine just take Absalon out of it Psalm where David fled from his son how would your fathers feel knowing you had to run for your life from your son that the one that you raised the one you fed the one you sheltered the one you clothed the one you sent to school the one you give your whole life for is now hunting you down like a dog um you see the life events that set this in place we found in second Samuel but the heart of David we find in the Psalms 3. in the heart of David we find here the challenges we find the hurt we find the pain we find what he was going through and when he cries out here Lord how are they increased that trouble me me are they that rise up against me at the re at the writing of this Psalm here David in this great deal of trouble he's looking out here his son is leading a successful Rebellion against him and his previous friends and Associates have now joined the ranks of Absalom and it's obvious that David starts this song by crying the Blues the first sentence is a Cry he's whining well maybe you have never whined to God maybe you've never cried the blues to God but I'll tell you it's okay David says how Lord increase they that trouble me and rise up against me God look at what's happening to me now I Loved You Lord I served you with all my heart I've given my entire life and now all these troubles are all the way around me everywhere I look there's trouble trouble trouble brothers and sisters these forces are increasing all around him and some of his greatest friends have become his foes um that hurts when those you trust those you believe in those that you thanks got you now they're chasing you they're hunting you down and they're increasing like I said when it rains it pours crying the Blues your car breaks down your dog gets run over you your wife loses your your billfold full of money it's never happened thank the Lord I don't have any money but you know what I'm saying one challenge after another and you think man how can I take any more of this how can I think any take any more of this and here is David now his entire life turned upside down and not only is his life turned upside down and it's increasingly they're getting worse and worse and worse now listen to what they're saying about him listen to what they're saying about him many of they which say of my soul now we're not talking about flesh and blood we're talking about David's Soul something that's so connected to God this has now become a spiritual warfare and people saying he's lost it David doesn't stand a chance if there is no help for him and God he's crossed the line oh how many times have we heard that some self-righteous well they can't come to God no more they've crossed the line did you see what they did I would hate to know I had that attitude towards somebody so I I can say this I've been around here for a long time I've known a lot of you for a long time you've known me for a long time and I think if we were honest with one another we could look out across the crowd and say probably none of us deserve what God has done for us and these people now are looking at David's situation that was so bad so bad can you imagine being in that place in your life where people look at you and say God won't even be willing to help him these people were there were people of Israel so they knew that God was able but they began to look at David they began to look at his situation and said nah not God won't even intervene for him they looked at David's past like I said we know each other that's one of the drawbacks of a small Church it's easy to know what each person does and they they remember David and Bathsheba do you remember do you remember David murdered her husband so that he could take her as his wife do you remember it was no long ago anything about it and they begin to bring us up and they begin to look and they begin to figure this all out and then they end up saying this is what he deserves from God there's no help for him and God he's just getting what he's got coming consequences consequences there was a there was a little girl whose mother was telling her and teaching her about consequences he said if you don't quit disobeying you're going to live with the consequences and that little girl looked up at her mother with trembling eyes and said Mom I don't want to live with the consequences I want to live here with you and Daddy we laugh at that but I want to get your attention with it because the consequences are the from the actions of Our Lives and David now is suffering for these consequences he's going through these concerts quinces one after another after another but they don't change you've heard the story about another little boy another little boy every time he done something wrong every time he was disobedient his dad went and drove a nail in the door hundreds of nails on the door and when his son comes down and said Dad I'm sorry I shouldn't have shouldn't have done any of these things I'm sorry for what I've done can we remove the nails he said yeah so he went he began every nail out of the door that he had driven at her for everything he had done wrong every lie he had told every bad word he had said every time he had mistreated somebody and the little boy looked up at the door and he began to cry and he said what are you crying for the never gone he said yeah but the holes remain hmm that can be our lives and here is David going through these consequences and these people rising up against him and here is a guy by the name of shimia and shimmy I always see in the Bible and he looks down at Dave this man was a terrible terrible angry man and he's angry because he felt like David had mistreated Saul and he'd done Saul wrong and he wanted Vengeance for Saul and he looks out there and he's wanting this reconciliation and it's not going to happen and he comes out there and he looks out there and he looks at across David and he begins to mock him and he begins to curse at him and he begins to look at him and shimmy our stands up and he says come out come out you bloodthirsty man you Rogue now the word rogue means scoundrel the word rogue also means Belial which is in the in the Bible is tied to Satan what did they call Jesus Beelzebub the chief of devils now here David is going through the same thing from a Mountaintop this man is up on the Mountaintop and he's he's sitting up there and he's crying crying out in everywhere that David steps he's throwing rocks at him and he's cursing him and he's throwing rocks at him and David's servant is this is the place where he looks at him he says I should go over there and take his head off and he says let him alone you know sometimes in life we all need friends like that we need friends like David had there that was ready to take off this guy's head and help fight David's battles because no doubt he looked at David and knew that he had to be at the lowest point of his life and he's looking at he says he came for it fight for himself so I'm gonna fight for him sometimes we need that you know sometimes you know I coach baseball and sometimes I wonder why I coach baseball but I'll tell you why be careful when I say when I tell this story I don't want to anyway we have a young man who struggles with anxiety and fear terrible can't come out of his room can't be around crowds he decides he wants to play ball doing a great job average average kid average player not gonna not gonna win the World Series but he's having fun his mama's crying in tears because he's he's entered into a group now and he's a part of something we have another young man you know I'm tender so bear with me I have another young man comes to us one day we have to have physicals you know the kids have to have physicals to play he comes to us he said coach we got a problem I said what's your problem he said it's a big problem I said what's the problem he said when I was born I had two holes in my heart he said my doctor won't let me play because they heard a murmur she won't clear me to play I can't get my physical she's going to send me to a specialist to a cardiologist in Nashville I said okay I said hey it's going to be okay he said I just want to play I said I know you do just a little kid I said it's gonna be okay I said just set out today we'll deal with it at the end of every practice we pray at the end of every practice we pulled the team together and I said listen guys we got a serious situation here I said is it okay if I tell them your story so he said yeah so I told him the situation I said this is this is a this is a real serious situation we need to be sincere when we go before God and we need to lift up we need to lift him up and pray that God would come and move on his body and can deliver him from this heart murmur who wants to pray who do you think raised their hand the one with anxiety he says I got this coach he was ready to fight a battle for his brother when he'd been fighting so many battles of his own and he says I got this coach and I said let's do it and we bow our heads and he began to pray and you never heard such a sin more sincere prayer in you all your life and we waited and I said now we're believing and we're going to receive what we have need of right here I said you're going to be fine he goes to the doctor and he he he sends us a text to the two days later he goes to the doctor on his way home and he sends us and he says I'm back with the muscle emoji we've been again to hand out the uniforms the next day and I said I've got a very special uniform to hand out today I said it's number three he said that's my number and the kids just erupted him to clap and then just praising God because he stood in the gap for his brother don't thank God don't answer your kids prayers sometimes and I'm off on a tangent sometimes we we don't give kids the opportunities to be Christians we don't give kids the opportunities to prove the prayers you say well how old was too old how Young's too young all I know is Mary conceived when she was 13. David was 12 when he was called to be king he wasn't anointed king but he was called to be king we don't need to let down on our little guys they're powerful I got to get back on my text somewhere Spurgeon said it this way talking about David here he said if all the trials which Come From Heaven all the temptation will just sinned from hell and all the crosses which arise from the earth could be impressed together they would not make a trial so terrible as that which is contained in this verse it's the most bitter of all afflictions to be led to fear that there is no help for us in God um what did God do for David in the midst of the trouble it says but without our shield for me when everybody else said God can't help you God can't defend you God can't hold you up God can't support you God can't fix your problems he says now Lord You're a shield for me see David was a warrior he was a king he was a warrior he knew what battle was and he knew he couldn't do nothing within himself and only God could protect him thou O Lord are my shield I'm under attack of this ruthless cunning enemy I need a shield David needed a shield you and I need a shield we need God in our life on a day-to-day basis and we need to cry out and declare the fact that you God are my shield he wasn't asking him to be a shield he declared it God you are my shield he knew where he stood you're my glory you're the one that gives me the confidence and the courage I need you're the lifter up of my head you know man find glory in all kinds of things Fame and power Prestige possessions that's not what David was looking for David found his glory in the Lord and said oh my soul I Cried unto the Lord with my voice you know sometimes we we run into problems and we say I need to go pray about this and we go into our little chamber and we whisper prayers nothing wrong with that but sometimes you have to get to a place silent prayers are fine but I will tell you some of my greatest Triumph moments when God moved on the scene is when I had to go up into the top of the hill and get in a deer stand and I cried unto the Lord and I said Lord I need you to hear my prayers I need you to listen to what I'm saying I need you to be vocal with you I don't know how far you are up there but I'm gonna make sure you hear me and I'm crying unto the Lord and David finds himself crying unto the Lord and what does the next verse say and he heard me out of his Holy Hill he burned me from the very portals of Heaven the windows of Heaven been opened up and God said I hear you David I hear you Peter I hear you Joe I hear you Becky I hear you Tommy when we cry the Lord he hears our voice and I laid down and slept I'll wait you know to be able to sleep in a trial like this David had a special kind of confidence how in the world could he sleep with his life on the line when we get ready for bed at my house my lovely wife will ask me did you check the back door y'all do it too sometimes I say yeah it's all right and she'll say you didn't check it did you and she'll throw them covers off and she'll go check it herself they have no security system David didn't have two vicious dogs sitting outside of his door got it here's when to learn tomorrow is going to come and God was going to see him through and we need the same kind of confidence because he says you will sustain me God sustains us in our sleep we take it for granted many times but when we're asleep we're dead to the world sometimes you don't know who's coming through the door but when I lay down God knows foreign he will sustain you so when the devil is hot on your heels it's time that we begin to remind ourselves who God is that God is our sustainer he's our great physician that God is our counselor he's our Banker he's our conqueror that God is all of these he's my best friend that's the one I like the most then I've got a friend in Jesus that nobody else can compare to David refused to let fear control his life and I'm hurrying now he says I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people let me tell you brothers and sisters ten thousand people is a lot of people hunting you down the Army has people the Navy has people they have one person can hunt down any body around the world can you imagine ten thousand trained Warriors and soldiers men who knew how to fight in battle are hunting you down but David says I will not be afraid of them I refuse to let fear control my life he didn't say fear wasn't present anybody tells you they don't fear nothing they're lying if they tell you that I don't have any fears um but David found courage in the Lord I read I run across this little sentence here and I hope it stands out to you the way it did me it says courage is fear that has said its prayers that's a good what's going on courage is fear that has said its prayers there's many times in my life even this is past week that when life gets hectic and stress comes on you can begin to feel the pressure and you can begin to feel the tightness and you can begin to feel a little bit of fear and anxiety and you just have to take a deep breath and say I'm not afraid just as David has done I'm not afraid arise O Lord for you have struck all of my enemies David's mind here is trusting God to do what he's already seen him dying he is already seen God In Action multiple times and let me tell you brothers and sisters we are too and I wish I would start doing it and I encourage all of us we ought to start keeping a journal and you want to write down every single day before you go to bed what did God do for me today because sometimes we get into places in our life and we think I know if God hears my prayers you know what you could look back on January the 10th you could look back on January the 9th you could look back in 1980 you could look back in 19 whatever God done something for you every single day of your life and David by having these journals David's Psalms are nothing more than a journal of the life that he's been through and delivered of God God delivered him of his adversaries over and over and over and he's he's sitting there he's now he says you've struck my enemies I know you can do it again so I'm Not Afraid arise oh Lord and move into action when he says arise that's a military word and Moses used it back when the children of Israel he said arise and he began to call up an army and David here is telling them hey arise Lord go fight my battle sometimes we're not assertive enough we should never demand God but when we know what God is going to do for us when we know what he he eagerly presents for us we ought to just saying gosh go fight this battle I don't have I'm not going to worry about this God go fight my battle and that's what David is saying arise God don't fight my battle knock their teeth out I seen you do it before and I know you'll do it again go fight my battle he's Ford he's he's foretelling what is going to happen at Calvary and when we look into the New Testament it says oh death where is thy still thing the Stinger's gone crave where is thy victory David is saying you're not the teeth out of my enemies and salvation it said Belongs to the Lord what did they sell David all they say for my soul there is no help from me and God and David now has quit crying the blues and he says oh I'll remember what you said salvation Belongs to the Lord it belongs to the Lord it isn't somebody else's property they can't take it away from me it's something between me and God and God give me salvation so they can't take my soul David makes this Con confession of trust when no one would help him God was his shield when David had nothing to treasure god was his glory when there was no one to encourage him God lifted his head when David cried out God heard him so if your head's hung low you've been beaten by trials you've been talked about mocked spit on rejected and people tell you there's nothing God can do to fix you I say that God comes down and he'll stay right there and he'll deliver you the Wolves sometimes nip at our heels the Wolves of the world running you down and maybe you'll be losing sleep and you're discouraged and it seems like the light cannot shine in the pit God will get in the pit with you I'm gonna close with this little story so you were so you'll remember the message there was a man a grandpa went to visit his little two-year-old toddler granddaughter the mother lays the baby down to sleep puts it in the pen there puts the baby a little town the baby cries and cries you know how they do they cry she says she just needs to cry it out leave her alone and Peppa goes over there and reaches into the pen pulls her out of the pen and pass her loves owner and the Mama comes back what are you doing I told you she needs to cry it out she needs to just cry it out and she'll be fine this is my baby I'm gonna raise her the way I want to raise her so let me have her and put her back in the pan puts her back in the pen she leaves the room wow you know they do instantly crying again and crying crying crying and Peppa was in a pickle because he's looking and the baby's crying and he's trying to figure out what am I gonna do she told me not to get her out of pen is in the pen with her and he coddles the baby and that's the way Jesus is with us when we cry the wowzy wowzy Blues he gets in the pan with us let's stand to our feet I trust you you received a blessing tonight from the word certainly encouraged me and I I've been wanting to preach on Psalms 3 for a while and there's
