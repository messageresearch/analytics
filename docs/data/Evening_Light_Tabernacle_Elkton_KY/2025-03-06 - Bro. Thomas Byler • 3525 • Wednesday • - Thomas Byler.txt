Jesus Jesus name amen and amen amen praise the Lord if you will let's just turn to and I W to I want to do one more sermon on God's God uh uh God's cookbook amen amen God's cookbook and I I was going to call it the the uh the great chef the great chef but amen I decided to call it come and dine instead amen come and dine in instead so amen let's just read that scripture over in St John St John 21 after these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of tiberias and on this wise showed he himself there were together Simon Peter Thomas called timus and Nathaniel of canaa of G in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two other of the disciples amen Simon Peter saith unto them I go fishing I go a fishing I think but brandom described this as having been kind of discouraged and everything with the way everything everything went he just decided to go fishing amen and they say unto him we also go with thee and they went forth and entered Ed into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing amen not only they discourage but they can't catch nothing that's got to be a bad day amen praise the Lord and when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus then Jesus said unto them children have ye any meat they answered him no and he said unto them cast a net on the right side of the ship amen and you shall find and they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes therefore the disciples that disciple whom Jesus loved called said unto Peter is it it is the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he GT his Fishers Fisher coat about him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea and the other disciples came in the little ship for they were not far from land but as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes as soon as they came they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid there on and breed and Jesus said unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught Simon Peter went up and Drew the net to the land full of great fishes 150 and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken and Jesus saith unto them come and dine and none of the disciples darest ask him who art thou knowing that it was the Lord amen and then cometh then Jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated tonight amen we know that there's a several times that Jesus quite literally amen fed the people isn't that right fed to people amen and the other time of course we know it was when in St John 6 or five in that area where you know he took those uh fishes and Loaves couple fishes and Loaves and turned it and fed 5,000 I guess that was men and I'm not sure what the great number was I think brother Brad said what it was 20,000 maybe with all the children and everybody a lot of people fed him then took a bunch of basket full up am mean that's what happens when God goes to cooking there's plenty left over amen amen plenty left over and here he was cooking for them and I can only imagine that it was good amen now how many knows that when it comes to cooking and amen and and food and and things that make you feel good and vitamins and everything like that of course we know he's the creator of it all and you know when you and I go to a restaurant we uh most of the time and we know you know there's some of them that you might call well they're just kind of slopping the Hogs or or something you know a that right so there a couple of us you know kind of think that you know no but anyway it's just have a mass bunch of food and it don't taste very good and it's not the best but you go old Charlies or somewhere like that you know and somewhere where the food's good and you know you're not going to find your salad you know all wilted and a little brown on it and slimy e right you nobody wants slimy salad right and so but anyway you know when you think about that how that we love good food you know and God we do and amen and God just knows how to bring things about and and talk about eating amen and talk about uh eating we know that all the way back in Genesis you know that God said told Adam and Eve not to do could that they could eat of every tree but not of the tree that's in the midst of the garden ain't that right but don't eat of that tree because that the day that you eat that that's the day you die you know there's two essential things in our lives two things that you've got to do got to have amen not maybe on a daily basis but you should have if you're going to be healthy that's food and water amen amen food and water that's the thing two things you got to have and it types the spiritual is that right it types the spiritual but we know that Adam and Eve of course they took up that tree amen of the knowledge of Good and Evil amen and we know that because of that they got poisoned they got death amen death set in because they ate of the wrong fruit amen and we know in Genesis 1 and 3 and verse 22 he says it this way and the Lord said now behold man has become as one of us to know good and to know evil and now least he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever so how many know there a Tree of Life there also that if you could partake of that you could have eternal life amen praise the Lord so ever since the dawn of humanity it's been about what we eat amen what you eat and I certainly don't mean it naturally because I think even the disciples got come to Jesus and they said you know to Jesus well they don't you don't they don't eat the right thing you don't wash their hands and so forth he says but it's not what goes into the mouth and goes out into the draw that defiles a man but it's what comes out amen but this eating that we're talking about of course we know that when e e partook of this tream she partook actually of what the devil had to say a't that right she agreed she agreed with what the devil was saying so out of this sermon I got today I said be careful who you agree with that's right amen because that means you're believing what they're saying and what they're saying is certainly better be right it also brings into EMP emphas emphasis amen how important it is that you have a Right leader leadership it's vitally vitally important even around this message look at the the different different doctrines that went out and man you know talk about inspiration and anointed like you ain't never seen folks amen but they yet they would preach perusia hello or Thunders and if you didn't belong to that well I don't you know they didn't think you was in you know and we find out you got to be careful ain't that right because everybody has a version you know everybody has a way to bring it out and you got to make sure that it's according to the word so it's very very vital and how many know that's why it was so vital amen and when you're following the prophet of God Amen how many know it's very vital of whether you do or whether you don't if he's false you better not but if he's true you better amen it's vital amen because we find that this type of eating was partaking coming in through the womb of the mind so to speak amen amen your mind goes to feeding on things and she she believed that the devil when he said Thou shalt not surely die right there when she pered that believed that she committed adultery against almighty God before the natural act ever taken place there was already a spiritual light that had taken place amen amen and she take of that tree and she brought death until now here we see a tree standing amen that was said that if you eat of this tree you'll live forever amen praise the Lord you know I'll just read this it's in front of you you know even pet I mean uh James Peter John Paul David there we go you know David said thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies amen thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over now I want to go to oh New Testament chapter U another another scripture in the New Testament where Jesus talks about um amen this is in St Luke I'm sorry St Luke 14 St Luke 14 if you want to go with me I'm going to read this here whole thing and when uh verse 15 and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard the things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God that's what Jesus said amen blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and B many and sent his servant at supper time to come and to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready amen praise the Lord and they all with one consent began to make excuse and the first one said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go see it I pray thee have me excused and another said I have bought five Yol of oxen I must go prove them I pray that you have me excused and another said I have married a wife I therefore cannot come so that servant came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and into the lanes into the of the city and bring hither the poor the Mame the Halt and the blind amen praise the Lord why you reckon they all needed to come to the supper huh why because at this supper they're liable to get their eyes open they're liable if they're lame to be able to walk again praise the Lord that's the kind of dinner I'm talking about praise the Lord now notice and the servant said Lord it is done as thou Hast commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto that servant go out into the highways and the hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled how many believe that Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed he invites his chosen people come and D come and D the master call us come and D you may Feast at Jesus tle all the time amen and there's always more room how many believes God is a more room hey there this table isn't full yet there's still room for more how glad tonight to be feasting at this table you're not one of those that have made an excuse no people get all kinds of excuses not to come and it's sad too because the Lord said unto the servant go into the highways hedge and compelled them to come in that may my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were bid shall taste of my supper glory amen if you don't come you'll never taste of his supper praise the Lord how many believes that the Lord the Lord himself can be tasted in Psalms 34 and8 says oh taste and see that the Lord is good amen blessed is the man that trusteth in him Revelations 22 the very end of the whole Bible when it's almost wrapped up within the few verses of the very end the spirit and the bride say come in verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come and let him that's here say come and let him that a thirst come fill my cup Lord come and quench the thirsting of my soul how many believe blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness woo Glory just to have that thirst you're a blessed person remember what what we read earlier blessed is he that shall eat in the kingdom of God praise the Lord eat bread in the kingdom of God come and who and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him come and take of the Water of Life freely praise be to God you know I told my wife on the way to church I said give me that phone I want to remember the thought you know and and I said you know I spoken to the phone I says you know that scripture says in Revelation there let him come let anyone he bits everybody to come anybody that's a thirst come but you know you can bring a horse to water but you can't make him drink they got a big neck you know right anybody ever grab of a hold of a horse sted to pick you up off of your going off the ground you're coming up off of there and you ain't going to get up there in that trough going to jump on top of his head and push his nose down into the water no no no no no you are going to be in for a real ride is that right why because he's so much stronger amen but that's the problem the problem is that people aren't thirsty people aren't hungry they're not hungry after righteousness they're not worried about whether they're right or not with God they don't want to be right with God but that's why you said here that's why I said here that's why we make the effort to come on a Wednesday night to say Lord if there any be any unrighteousness me take it out Lord why because I'm hungering and I'm thirsting for the righteousness of God cuz I know what it's like to sit at God's table amen and to Feast on his righteousness I love to see this feast on his justification how many glad for his righteousness that you can eat at the table the Forgiveness of your sins that you can get at the table of almighty God woo when did Jesus finish the supper and say it's ready now come when did he do it I say it was on couch when he said it's finished it is finished he did his part he got it ready amen and now he can't even do anything for you if he was here brother bam said Not until you accept that it's already done that it's already finished you have to accept that I have learned through me and my wife's experience that as long as you're still hoping for it you don't got the faith to have it cuz if you're looking for it to happen and saying Lord I'm looking for it to happen you're still hoping you're still not at the place that you need to be but when you get it in your heart and in your mind hey it's already done W Glory then God will do something cuz that's Faith makes it so Faith don't hope so Faith makes it so that's what we need amen little things like that the Lord will teach you in hard times amen praise the Lord how many's glad to be a church tonight amen just another little thought just kind of start out with here what does the Holy Ghost what is the only thing the Holy Ghost feeds on the word ain't that right what's on the table what's on the menu right here this is on the menu would you like to see the menu how many's ever been asked that would you like to see the menu would you like to have a menu how many believe that God has amen you if you need healing he's got Isaiah 56 53 3 to6 amen by his stripes I was healed he was wounded for our transgression bruised for in our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we were healed that is a menu that I like to eat from that I like to read from glory for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that if anybody should believe in him he should not perish I I'll have some of that give me some of that give me some predestination give me some forign knowledge give me some Revelations 13 and8 amen and All Shall wander after him whose names were not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb lame from the foundation of the world how many beli you've got your name on the book from the found give me some more of that that's some good food it'll make you strong it'll make you realize you didn't get saved on a certain day on a certain time you always was saved you just recognized it he was saved 2,000 years ago when he died on Calvary you was saved in the mind of God before this first Stardust was ever created he knew everything he knew every person ever would be saved amen praise the Lord get thee behind me Satan amen that old Kink and a little old knot or something back there one not up on me but I rebuke it in Jesus name by his stripes I was healed amen so we look at that he's got a table spread praise the Lord he's got food for us amen remember the woman at the well is that right came to the woman at the well ask her for a drink you know and she said how is it thou being a Jew ask me to drink being a Samaritan we have no dealings with each other other Jesus answered unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith unto thee give me a drink thou wouldest have asked him and he would have given thee Living Water praise be to God how many believe there's living bread there's Living Water amen then he the woman says I ain't got nothing you ain't got nothing to draw with this that and the other Jesus said to her whosoever drinketh this water shall thirst again how many know oh boy you might drink methodus water you might drink Amish water you might drink menite water you might drink Church water you might kind of drink all kinds of water but it'll never satisfi it but when you drink his water the water of Jesus you're satisfied forever it really does satisfy amen order natural water you'll thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall for give him shall never thirst amen but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life and the woman saith unto him sir give me this water water and bread amen let me ask you something how how many knows what the water represents it represents the word of God and also represents the spirit hello the spirit of God Amen give me this water I believe that's what a lot of people ought to be doing is Lord give me this water I want this water and what does he do he begins to discern her thoughts and intensive her heart and so forth amen and then it says God is his spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth and the woman saith unto him I know the Messiah cometh which is called Christ and when he has come he will tell us these things Jesus saith under her I that speak thee am he is that right and she left her water pop and ran into the City and said to the men of the city because she said we know the when the Messiah comes he'll tell us the thing he says man look what they've done and the man of the city came and believed on him because of that woman's report why she knew more about what the Messiah was than this generation of people all right let's let's look at what's on the table let's look at the table y'all want to look at what's on the table to eat what's on the table that we can eat St John 6 will begin and then we'll get right to our point in chapter 7 now right after he had caused the men to sit down in the grassy place and he gave him all those fishes and Loaves after all those things the multitude followed him in a ship chapter 6 and verse 26 says and Jesus answered them and said verily I say unto you you seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you did eat of the Loaves and were filled then he says labor not for the meat which perishes but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God sealed let's go on down to verse 30 there said therefore unto him what sign showest thou then that we may see and believe thee what do thou work my goodness he had just showed him you know about the Loaves and the fishes n our fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus saith unto him verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that meat from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread amen the true bread for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life his life unto the world they said unto him Lord ever more give us this bread Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst amen so what is it this hungering this feeding this taking in of Jesus is by believing him by receiving him by receiving his word that's what it all hinges on whether or not you receive that word into your heart that's the true eating of God is believing God Amen over in the same chapter over in verse 48 again he says I am the bread of life your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead but B says that man that dead means eternally separated from God he didn't say Sleepless or anything like that are dead and this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die heyen how many's glad they have eaten of that bread that you'll never die never be separated from almighty God if you bu if you die if you take your last breath if you gasp I don't care what way you might die you might die a horrible way but just beyond that last breath you won't go out into a lost State somewhere you'll go and stay right in the presence of almighty god for death means separation from God you'll never be separated from God you'll go right into his presence you'll never see death amen separation from God thank you Lord so here we see where you can eat of a tree amen that's why Jesus is the tree of life you eat of that tree you will live forever amen praise the Lord all right I might as well say it while I'm thinking it you've heard the phrase you are what you eat huh you are fart you eat and I don't understand all the other stuff about it brother Brad but I know is one thing that if you eat God you become God you're going to have the same fruits you're going to have the same actions you're going to have the same words you're can have longsuffering you can have gentleness you're going to have patience you can't eat God and not act like God are you with me you truly do become an amateur God that's right Son of God a daughter of God God Amen praise the Lord amen amen now notice I am the bread of life they dead this bread which cometh down from heaven that I may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread amen I don't care don't eat for a while don't eat for a while see how weak you get oh man I am so weak I've got to eat something and then you go and you eat a good meal my you get some energy again and it gives you life you lack up on prayer for a while you get backslid up God a little bit come on folks you get weak you don't read you don't pray like you ought to you're going to get weak amen and then you begin to get back in the word and say God forgive me start to eat again you get your strength back again amen you got the Holy Ghost the more you get of the Holy Ghost brother bam says you can't wait to get the church to fellowship with your brothers and sisters I thought that other thing another thing that is wonderful on the table of God Amen is the fellowship how many believe that we have Fellowship that wonderful fellow Fellowship Divine with almighty God is on the table of God that he's offering to the world I can I say something let me say something let me not say something and then forget what I was fixing to say but listen God did not allow us to get a disease to get poisoned to get Co huh without having an antibody for it he's already got the cure for it ain't that right he didn't let Humanity go into darkness without a plan of bringing them back isn't that a awesome God thank you Jesus he made a way back he had a table spread he said he did made a great supper invited everybody oh my when I think about what God Did In Our Generation through the prophet of God open up the eyes of the blind things that hadn't been done for 2,000 years hello opened the eyes of the Blind and healed the sick and infallible proofs and stayed right with the word took us right back the word of God ain't that right and then people make excuse I manyan those people that make excuses they're going to regret making excuses one day they're going to make going have serious regrets having make it excuses not to come to God not to accept what he before before this before this Earth completely Burns God was so merciful that he even had his own picture taken with the prophet the pillar of fire was seen multiple times the power of God was demonstrated by like never at any other age how many knows he went what seven times over ain't that right over and over and over and over and over the world Amen mercy and mercy and mercy and mercy and mercy God reached out his [Applause] hand to save people amen he's not going to burn it without giving everybody a warning without giving everybody every chance that you could possibly have according to the prophet but God's word was enough God said it there's your chance but then God does is merciful he comes and does signs and wonders how many knows the healing the healing of people when brother bam was Discerning the thoughts and intents of the people that was not for their healing he said that was to build their faith that God is there that God is real and then accepted now will you believe that you are healed why because that it get inspires their faith of course if he had a vision of them being healed he would say it and so forth but a lot of times he would say now you're so and so from so and so your name is so and so it's also kind of so strange that the angel said if you can get the people to believe you how many times you you know how many times this seems to be on the side here but maybe somebody needs it how many times he would Des he would he would uh he would say now do you believe me to be his servant because how many believes if your pastor preached for you if your brother Brad prays for you you've got to believe that he's a servant of God and when he lays his hands on you that you're going to be healed otherwise you might as well sitting in your seat but on the case of brother bandham he said if he could get the people to believe not even cancer would stand in their way amen one woman I y'all remember I read it just about a week or so ago it's because she did not believe it now he told her get dick either crutches or something not take your crutches off and go she says I've been on these all my life and you're going to tell me I he said because you didn't believe you'll stay on them she didn't get her healing because she did not believe what he told her he told her to do it if she tells you to go and take it that's exactly what she should have done but she doubted I've been on the this for all my life you're going to tell me that I just take up it was doubt speaking wasn't good how many know doubt is never good amen why God do you take doubt into your heart you disbelieve he that believeth not shall be damned go you into all the world and preach the gospel he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved simply by eating it and believing it you will be saved don't have to have any works just believe you ain't got to crawl on your knees you ain't got to do a rosary you ain't got to do all all this other stuff just believe this Bible whosoever believeth in me shall not perish but have everlasting life ain't that right the simple Faith just take it and believe it amen amen I am the living bread verse 51 which came down from heaven if any me man eat of this bread and he shall live forever for the bread that I will give he give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then said Jesus unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you whoa this was a new doctrine this was no amen eat flesh what are you some kind of bunch of zombies drink blood but said human vampires in their logical mind that's what in the world is he talking about but if you don't eat Jesus you cannot live forever if you do not eat his flesh and drink his blood you have no life In You whosoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed amen what did Eve eat she believed the devil's lie what do we eat we believe Jesus's truth in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt among men what do we eat we eat the word of God that's how we eat his flesh we could say this is his flesh this is his body this is God this is what we eat his word he is the word amen amen our monthly communion scripture says and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me I should have read the other verse verse Paul said for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he bet in the same night in which he was betrayed took bread is that right after he had broke that bread he said take eat this is my body which is broken for you how many know it's his bread that bread was broken for you you accept that you accept what Christ did for you hallelujah praise the Lord as the living father now wait a minute he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him how many knows that's how you partake of his of eating him is he comes on the inside of you into your heart you're one you become one with what you eat it's so important how many knows it's so important what you eat spiritually what you allowed to go through your mind spiritually how many knows our young people are college kids all of those kids that are indoctrinated in the way that they are is't that right it's because of the teachers that they have the way that they're being taught is what's causing them to be the way that they are amen that's right why do you think it's so important to have Godly Parents that teach their children the right way the right thing amen then not no listen that's right he so he says he says as the father as the living father has sent me and I live I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me amen amen this is that bread

feeding on the body of Christ brother Bram says it this way I want you to know this sure and you that listen to this tape you might not have you might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself all the things that God has done coming down to the Ohio river and all that being that I'm packing the message I have no more to do with it than nothing how many glad that brother Brandon was just a vessel that Jesus used that's right no more than just a voice a voice against my better judgment I want to be a Trapper see you know it's the will of the father that I declare to you I'm determined to do it I wasn't the one that appeared on the Ohio River I wasn't only standing in where he appears I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are I'm only the one that's near when he doesn't he just uses my mouth God help us all is that how it ought to be God ought to be so close to us that that's all we do is he just speaks through our mouth he just loves through our hearts he just has compassion through our lives I was only the voice it wasn't what I knew it's just what I surrendered myself to he spoke through through me it isn't me it's not the seventh angel it was a manifestation of the son of man amen Luke 17:30 as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the days of the son of man shall be revealed a prophet age is that right it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man the angel was not the son of man he is a messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one you are feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man's word will fail but you're feeding on the UN failing body word of the son of man if you haven't fully fed on every word to give yourself strength to Fly Above these denominations and things well I I guess it's time for you to go to eaten how many believe that that's our biggest problem baby we don't even eat spiritual enough we don't sit at this table that God has offered to us and brought us to come and D come and eat Jesus said come the tables ready come and eat amen pass the potatoes pass the meat pass this pass all these things pass Grace pass forgiveness give me some more of that Faith give me some more of that love of God over there Amen Let me give me a big old spoon am me I don't care if I can't barely shove it in my mouth I want a big spoon when I go to eating this he said go ahead eat yourself full and he said go ahead and let your soul get fat woo that's right let your soul Delight itself in fatness being satisfied IED how many is glad that we're living we're a privileged people folks we're a privileged people God still has the buffet even God told Brother B Store up the tape store up food store up the food we're going to need it amen what do you think we're feeding on we're feeding on that stored food amen it's given us strength when everybody's dying and everything else it's given us strength when those places thirsting and dry thirsty land amen amen we're eating on Malachi 4 Malachi 4 behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord what's he'll do turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers in other words he's going to give turn this back to the original not hbrd food not mix food not my idea mix in it not any other message preachers mix in it not Pentecost or any other no this is back to the word of God we're back to the original because why if they have stayed with it brother B said the Rapture would have take place the Ephesus Church they fell amen but this church is predestinated not to fall we're going to stay with the word we have been sprad back into the fullness of the word amen and I'm telling you right now you're going to act like what you hate there's Rapture in this message taking us back to the faith that the fathers the life of the fathers the power of the fathers Malachi 4 eating on Malachi 4 Revelations 10:7 and what's it producing it's producing Ephesians 4 I'm going to close with this Revelations 10:7 Luke 17:30 all of that is produced Ephesians the book of Ephesians that he might sanctify he said husband loves your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word how many believe that when we come to church when you drink of this water it cleanses you this water that he's got it cleanses you from the inside out it's washing a water that washes you what is this water this water it says that we are now Justified who we who believe in Christ are now justified by faith isn't that right justification means your sins are gone as though you never did it in the first place I can accept that give me some more of that to drink amen the devil tries to bring it up no it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness amen amen listen I won't go to preaching on all of this but listen Washed by the Water of the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church is't that right not having spot or wrinkle no man's tradition no man's ideas pure the word of God brother brah says Eve disbelieved one word and it caused all this if we're going to make it back we got to believe every word amen how many believes we are I heard brother bam say you know yesterday I wanted to I wanted to click it on my phone get it but he said he makes a statement he says you know what we need to do is get enough of the spirit of God may God bring his Spirit down upon you enough to make you say I believe every word of God I believe it's all true I was like you got to have the Holy Ghost to say that yeah he said made the Holy Spirit come down when you oh I I even long before I ever come into the message when I give give give my life to God I says I believe this I believe every word of it I believe it why why could it look where I come from and all the confusion is everywhere isin't that right I could have at first I was like well I don't know so much confusion but then the holy spirit says you believe that you take that and you believe every word of it many stories come from that amen but anyway give us the spirit to believe every word not without spot wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish amen how many believes that's what this message will produce it will produce a bride that's stressed and ready for the Rapture God bless you stand with me tonight pull that song up if you would come and dine while we bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you Lord and we want to thank you Lord for your Holy Spirit we want to thank you Lord for the bread of life that we have and possess in our souls in our hearts father we're not we're not interested we're not hungry for
