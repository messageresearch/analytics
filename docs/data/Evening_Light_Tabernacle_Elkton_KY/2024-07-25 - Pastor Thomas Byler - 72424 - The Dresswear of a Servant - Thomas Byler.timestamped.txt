[37:57] upon the Throne high and lifted up and
[38:00] his train filled the
[38:02] temple above it stood the seraphim each
[38:05] one had six
[38:07] wings with Twain he covered his face
[38:10] with Twain he covered his feet and with
[38:13] Twain he did fly and the one Cried unto
[38:16] the other and said holy holy holy is the
[38:20] Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of
[38:23] his glory now REM remember that the
[38:26] whole earth is full of his glory amen so
[38:30] if you're in the earth you are around
[38:33] his glory
[38:36] amen one and uh verse four and the posts
[38:40] of the door moved at the
[38:43] voice that cried of him that cried and
[38:46] the house was filled with smoke then
[38:49] said I woe is me for I am undone because
[38:51] I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell
[38:54] amongst the midst of a people of unclean
[38:56] lips for mine eyes have seen the king
[38:59] the Lord of hosts then flew one of the
[39:01] seraphim unto me having a live coal in
[39:04] his hand which he had taken with the
[39:06] tongs from off the Altar and he had laid
[39:09] it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath
[39:11] touched thy lips and thine iniquity is
[39:14] taken away and thy sin purged also I
[39:18] heard the voice of Lord saying who shall
[39:20] I send and who will go for us then said
[39:23] I here am I send me may God add His
[39:28] blessings to the reading of the words
[39:29] you can be seated tonight amen we
[39:33] will amen I was thinking of trying to
[39:37] condense this a little bit amen the
[39:39] message tonight and I thought back there
[39:42] if you was a good preacher amen I
[39:44] thought you'd uh you wouldn't get past
[39:47] just the first step amen but anyway
[39:51] we'll just say what the Lord wants us to
[39:53] say and go from there is that okay amen
[39:57] so tonight amen and I want to read uh
[40:00] let me just read a quote here if I
[40:05] may amen we'll start right there how
[40:08] about
[40:09] that she found that in my pictures today
[40:12] and put it oh my gracious this ain't
[40:14] supposed to go off for 15 minutes amen
[40:18] but anyway she put that up there let me
[40:20] just uh start with a quote before I tell
[40:23] you my my title amen and the sermon that
[40:27] we're going to basically teach out of
[40:29] tonight is going to be an influence
[40:33] 1963
[40:35] 0803 amen 0803 and 63 brother Brandon
[40:39] preached a message called influence and
[40:41] we want to just do a little study with
[40:43] the help of the Lord out of that and I
[40:46] say that because for some reason I don't
[40:48] know why but amen I it came to my heart
[40:51] came to my mind about this scripture
[40:54] amen and those wings that those angels
[40:56] had and I was like well what what does
[40:58] the Lord want me to preach on and so I
[41:00] begin to study that and it just begin to
[41:02] flow so amen for some reason or other
[41:05] amen it's a certainly a subject that we
[41:07] all know well amen amen the subject of
[41:09] influence amen but we just want to go
[41:12] over it amen and just study it for a
[41:15] little bit for tonight amen and maybe
[41:17] maybe somebody needs it is that right
[41:20] how many believe that's how God works
[41:22] amen surely there'll be somebody that
[41:24] needs it amen and so we're thankful that
[41:26] God does work that way we believe that's
[41:28] how church works I mean that's why we
[41:31] have a live Ministry isn't that right so
[41:33] that the Holy Spirit can get right down
[41:35] where we live and speak to who he wants
[41:37] to speak to amen amen and say what he
[41:40] once said amen so now and this is way in
[41:45] this is 13 23 paragraphs in in already
[41:48] but I thought it was a good way to start
[41:51] now what a real servant that is of god
[41:54] he see he showed the prophet how his
[41:58] prepared servant should be what should a
[42:02] prepared servant be now these servants
[42:06] uh look at he says he looked at a man on
[42:08] Earth here and see what a failure he had
[42:11] made then God showed him a Kingdom in
[42:14] Heaven a throne that's the one to look
[42:16] at then he showed him what a real
[42:19] servant ought to be that served in his
[42:24] presence and here was the seraphim then
[42:26] covered their holy faces covered their
[42:28] feet and with two Wings they went into
[42:31] action reverent humble and in action
[42:35] amen if that ain't a dressed up servant
[42:39] I don't know what
[42:41] is amen humble and in action oh my I
[42:45] tell you so my title is amen the servant
[42:50] of God's the the dress Weare of a
[42:52] servant the dress Weare of a servant
[42:58] amen and you know I like I like this
[43:01] because it's it's it's it's not real
[43:03] deep you know it's not really hard it's
[43:06] not it's just three different things one
[43:08] is humble reverent and in action amen
[43:13] and so if God so seen fit to create
[43:17] seraphim which brother Braham said
[43:19] there's cherubims then there's sarap
[43:21] which I think he said somewhere in here
[43:23] amen that they were like handlers of
[43:25] fire or burners burn ERS and so forth
[43:28] amen that that's what they were and of
[43:30] course we know what they did there is
[43:31] they got a coal of live fire and they
[43:34] touched the prophet amen and that fire
[43:37] made him pure as could be amen and so
[43:41] brother bam says you know of course we
[43:42] understand that it takes the fire of the
[43:45] Holy Spirit to clean you and I also how
[43:48] manyan believes if that fire doesn't
[43:50] ever touch you amen you can't really
[43:53] exper uh uh expect to be clean takes the
[43:56] five of God to burn out any filth that's
[44:00] in you but here um and let me just give
[44:03] I'm I'm going to read a little bit that
[44:05] okay amen and we're going to try to
[44:08] follow some of my some of my numbers and
[44:11] the way that I've got it down first
[44:12] let's find out a little bit about Uzziah
[44:15] Uzziah the king isn't that right because
[44:17] this is in the year that King Uzziah
[44:19] died amen it was talking Isaiah was
[44:22] talking here and he had that how he went
[44:24] into the temple of God and he begin to
[44:26] see am mean see what was was there God
[44:29] opened up his eyes now let's go back in
[44:32] the background of Uzziah brother bam
[44:34] says it this way Uzziah the King was a
[44:36] Shepherd boy he was a very young
[44:38] fellow amen and a King's son that loved
[44:42] the outdoors the woods and he was a
[44:45] herdsman and he also liked The Vineyards
[44:48] and he liked to see things grow and this
[44:50] young F was brought up under a real good
[44:54] influence amiah his father had been a
[44:57] great man in his last days he let down a
[45:00] little bit and picked up some Gods from
[45:03] another country and the Lord had taken
[45:05] him off the Earth but this young fellow
[45:07] had a good influence because his mother
[45:09] was a daughter of Jerusalem and his
[45:11] father was a Believer and therefore the
[45:13] boy had been raised
[45:15] up with a good influence amen and that's
[45:19] the good way to bring up your child he
[45:21] says in the way that it should go and
[45:23] you know what your children of the one
[45:25] of the main ones that's watching you
[45:27] they watch what you do whatever you do
[45:29] they copy after you because you're
[45:30] sitting the example before them amen a
[45:33] little bit more here now notice he says
[45:36] now that's what was made him such a
[45:38] great example to this young Prophet at
[45:41] the same time Isaiah now Isaiah the
[45:44] prophet lived in the days of Uzziah the
[45:46] king and both of them being young
[45:49] together the prophet and the King they
[45:51] were great Chums together and Isaiah
[45:54] stayed in the palace and leaned upon the
[45:57] arm of the king and we find out that
[45:59] this young fellow's influence influenced
[46:02] Isaiah he says and he become a hero to
[46:05] Isaiah because it made no difference to
[46:07] the uh to in the people whatever he
[46:10] never let anything sway him from one
[46:12] side or to the other he was determined
[46:14] to serve God and to serve God alone and
[46:18] that's a good person to take an example
[46:21] of Praise the
[46:24] Lord
[46:25] amen and we find out that he never
[46:28] compromised with any of the Heathen
[46:30] Worlds the Heathen world and so forth
[46:32] after they seen him build his kingdom so
[46:34] great and God was with him in blessing
[46:35] him and God will bless any man that'll
[46:38] stay with his word that's right God is
[46:40] Duty bound to do that to bless any man
[46:43] that will stay with God's word so we see
[46:47] how that Isaiah
[46:51] um Isaiah and Uzziah grew up together
[46:54] and I don't think I've got it here but
[46:56] we know I I think brother bam said that
[46:58] Uzziah became king at like 16 years old
[47:02] and we know that he became a great man
[47:04] isn't that right and we know the story
[47:06] of him and how that he lived and become
[47:08] very very prosperous amen but you know
[47:10] he got lifted up is't that right he got
[47:12] lifted up Amen in
[47:15] Pride amen he got lifted up in Pride
[47:19] amen listen that's where he got in
[47:23] trouble we'll get into the thought of
[47:26] humility
[47:27] tonight and then we want to get into the
[47:29] thought of reverence and then also with
[47:31] the help of the Lord we'll try to get
[47:33] all the way over in and into action amen
[47:37] now let me back up just a little bit
[47:38] before we go on talking about this man
[47:41] that got lifted up and so forth amen uh
[47:45] first of all I can only imagine you can
[47:48] only imagine in your mind these
[47:51] seraphim amen with wings that covered
[47:56] their feet
[47:57] feet is that right I don't know where
[48:00] they would be attached to amen maybe up
[48:02] here and reaching
[48:04] down
[48:06] right and then perhaps of course you
[48:09] think about maybe a Wings being right
[48:12] here by your arms cover their face is't
[48:14] that
[48:16] right or maybe there's maybe they're up
[48:19] up a little higher because maybe we
[48:21] could let's just say that the wings for
[48:23] flying is your arms that would make more
[48:26] sense wouldn't it we're just doing a
[48:27] little imagining here is that all right
[48:29] to try to figure out what we're going to
[48:31] do with all six wings that's a bunch of
[48:33] wings on a person ain't it or an angel
[48:36] six wings that's a lot of flying ability
[48:40] right there but with two of them they
[48:42] covered their feet there two of them am
[48:44] me they covered their face and with two
[48:47] they did
[48:50] fly and you know God doesn't make things
[48:53] uh that doesn't have any significance
[48:55] everything that he makes is very very
[48:57] significant the prophet here picks this
[48:59] up and he begins to preach many sermons
[49:01] on influence and so forth and and what
[49:05] can happen to a person amen and we want
[49:08] to want to first of all we want to go
[49:10] down the road of
[49:13] humility amen if you're going to be
[49:15] God's servant the first thing that we
[49:17] have to have is
[49:21] humility now humility is the opposite of
[49:24] what Pride
[49:27] there's pride and then there's
[49:29] humility now Uzziah stayed humble for a
[49:32] very long time but he was very
[49:35] blessed he was very blessed of God and
[49:38] he prospered greatly but one day he got
[49:41] lifted up one day he allowed Pride to
[49:45] come
[49:48] in brother BR Bo about have to listen to
[49:51] this talks about preachers that you know
[49:53] perhaps be get famous or be have a
[49:56] congreg and they think they can do
[49:58] anything they want to and get away with
[49:59] it no no no no they get lifted up in
[50:02] Pride he says be careful it's one of the
[50:04] dangers isn't that right same way with
[50:07] uh
[50:09] uh uh anyway so let me go on and when
[50:12] they now listen when a man or a woman no
[50:14] matter whether he's a bishop or a
[50:16] cardinal or whatever he might be when
[50:18] you begin to feel that yourself Reliant
[50:22] then you better begin to watch and to
[50:24] take heat because see God won't let you
[50:27] go on like that because he will not
[50:28] share his glory with another no sir God
[50:32] takes his glory how many believes that
[50:35] to God be the
[50:37] glory and God
[50:40] alone sometimes God can bless a man and
[50:42] give him a little ministry that's been a
[50:44] little better than his brothers or maybe
[50:46] not better but just something a little
[50:47] different from his
[50:52] Brethren amen think about around the
[50:55] message now little better than his
[50:58] Brethren and the first thing you know
[51:00] that man becomes exalted with his chest
[51:03] out and Oh my he would he would brush
[51:06] you off in the street see that's the
[51:08] time that I believe that man is started
[51:10] out the door cuz God can't use a person
[51:14] like that amen and though this King
[51:17] though he'd be a Godly Man as he was he
[51:19] felt self-sufficient he felt like that
[51:21] he could hoist himself up in Pride and
[51:24] that he could take over and do whatever
[51:26] that he wanted to do and he didn't have
[51:29] to ask
[51:31] anybody
[51:33] amen my my my he got lifted up in Pride
[51:36] didn't he not something that you want to
[51:40] do
[51:42] see the problem with the world is is
[51:45] they have a pride
[51:51] problem and I was thinking of how when
[51:54] you're younger when you're a
[51:57] teenager when you're 20 30 40 you're in
[52:01] a peak of health and strength and boy
[52:04] you can just become proud and think
[52:06] you're invincible and is that right you
[52:08] feel like you're invincible and if you
[52:10] aren't careful you'll be Li get lifted
[52:12] up in Pride when when you get a little
[52:14] older and you begin to lose your
[52:16] strength and you get feeble humility
[52:19] begins to set in you realize you're not
[52:22] what you used to
[52:24] be amen but but the thing of it is that
[52:27] we got to remember is that even though
[52:29] you're maybe in the prime of Youth and
[52:31] the prime of strength amen the secret to
[52:35] absolutely being able to serve God
[52:37] successfully and I hope this is what we
[52:39] get across to everybody and I'm sure we
[52:41] all are here tonight Desiring to be used
[52:46] of God isin that right to be God's
[52:48] servant and to be successful at it and
[52:52] so the one thing that you must have is
[52:55] recognition
[52:57] of what you
[52:58] are of who you are you have to put
[53:01] yourself in the right place humble
[53:04] yourself under the mighty hand of God
[53:06] and he will exalt you in due season but
[53:10] first you have to be brought
[53:12] down you have to realize how how what
[53:16] you really are that's just a little bit
[53:18] of
[53:21] dirt you're some you're dust you made
[53:23] out of the Dust of the Earth
[53:26] and so now and I and I I be I thought
[53:29] that and when I when I was thinking
[53:30] about it then when I studied this
[53:32] brother bam came across this and I
[53:33] thought it was such a good example that
[53:35] I want to just read you what he said see
[53:37] even brother bandam says a man that's
[53:39] born of a woman is a few days and full
[53:41] of
[53:42] troubles and the living now know that
[53:45] they have to die ain't that right and we
[53:48] know that it was once appointed to man
[53:49] to die and after that the Judgment so so
[53:53] we know that we must he says I don't
[53:56] want to live in this old pest house that
[53:58] I'm living in it catches every disease
[54:00] that floats through I want one that's
[54:03] not made pans fashioned after God that's
[54:07] not a hybrid plant like this I want one
[54:10] that's made by the hands of God that
[54:12] diseases and sickness and death goes
[54:14] from it that's right whenever he s
[54:18] summons me I'm ready by the grace of God
[54:20] believing that when this Earthly
[54:21] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[54:23] already waiting that we move into it
[54:26] that cannot die no
[54:29] more
[54:31] amen all
[54:33] right we're going to go on to the next
[54:36] one here and we look here we see that
[54:40] we're they're just a shadow anyhow we
[54:43] are a shadow I look on the platform I
[54:47] see men that moves I look in the streets
[54:51] and see women that moves they got life
[54:54] but yet it cannot be real life brother
[54:58] bam says that it's just a
[55:02] shadow I think Peter said it's a vapor
[55:06] that appears for a while and then it
[55:07] vanishes away brother bam says the life
[55:10] that we're now living in it's just a
[55:15] shadow amen before you can ever become
[55:18] humble you got to look at something you
[55:20] got to recognize that you're not always
[55:22] going to be here that you come and that
[55:25] you're going to be gone and it won't be
[55:26] long and you'll be just basically in the
[55:29] grave so get the right to put things in
[55:33] perspective don't
[55:36] it and then something how he brings this
[55:39] out my my where how much better off
[55:42] everybody would be if they' put things
[55:45] in
[55:46] perspective realizing that they're just
[55:49] amen it's just a sh people wouldn't do
[55:51] the stuff they
[55:53] do amen if they get a little bit of
[55:57] humility but they live like going to
[55:59] live forever
[56:01] amen all right so I don't
[56:07] know all right thought I made some
[56:10] examples now listen to so what he says
[56:14] he says and David like David said
[56:15] because death's it cannot be real life
[56:18] because it's
[56:19] death in it David said I'll walk through
[56:23] the valley of the shadow of death now it
[56:26] takes so much light to make a Shadow
[56:29] there has to be so much light if it's
[56:30] allog together Darkness it don't make a
[56:32] Shadow see it has to be so much light in
[56:35] the dark to make a
[56:37] Shadow if I see a man walking fin
[56:40] looking young man in a few years his
[56:44] hair turns gray and slips out his
[56:48] shoulders droop
[56:53] down if you don't mind brother Glenn
[56:56] you're 70
[56:58] what uh come on up
[57:03] here Michael come up here would you
[57:06] stand up here amen now they're a little
[57:09] bit they're a little bit different
[57:11] they're a little bit different heights
[57:12] but let's just say we don't know you
[57:15] don't know what uh uh brother Glenn
[57:17] looked like when he was his age do we
[57:20] we'd have to have a picture but let's
[57:21] just look here's how you doing brother
[57:23] Glenn we're going to call him Glenn for
[57:25] a minute boy brother Glenn you look
[57:27] awfully good you ain't got no wrinkles
[57:29] no gray hair you're Stout you're ready
[57:32] to go look at that belly there that
[57:34] right looking
[57:38] good huh that's right but what happen
[57:41] but I'm looking at a young man young man
[57:44] a few years his hair turns gray slips
[57:47] out in just a few years brother fam says
[57:49] look at what
[57:50] happens ain't that right wait till we
[57:53] get our new body that's right we're
[57:55] going back to that h aren't we right but
[57:57] brother bam says see see s you might
[57:59] think oh and look in that in the same
[58:01] amount of years this brother here he's
[58:03] probably going to look a lot like him
[58:05] ain't that right give it give it a
[58:07] little time folks and then man it all
[58:09] turns it changes don't it amen so get
[58:13] right look at it in the right
[58:14] perspective thank you brother Michael
[58:17] amen Glenn amen so brother B says look
[58:21] at that a beautiful young girl standing
[58:23] with a saintly Godly face on her
[58:28] who can we
[58:31] use sister Sherry are you GNA be the old
[58:39] version Elena Elena let's get Elena up
[58:43] here she's real young yet ain't that
[58:46] right you all are about the right height
[58:48] so what I'm preaching might match up
[58:50] pretty good amen now we we you know we
[58:54] don't know what sister Sherry looked
[58:55] like back then that we now but let's
[58:58] just say hi sister share you boy you're
[59:00] look at look at that turn that way a
[59:01] little bit look at that nice flower just
[59:04] just beautiful brother M say a beautiful
[59:06] young woman standing there with saintly
[59:08] Godly face amen standing there and
[59:11] praise God and come back in a few years
[59:13] find out we're stoop shouldered ain't
[59:15] that right stoop shouldered packing two
[59:17] or three children well now that's down
[59:19] to the road yet Ain that right but any
[59:21] it shows that that body there is death
[59:23] in it no matter how well it's taken care
[59:25] of how lovely look it still got death in
[59:28] it thank you sisters I appreciate it
[59:31] amen so how many know look at life
[59:33] people if you just realize hey you're
[59:35] not always gonna be I'm not always going
[59:36] to be here I'm not always going to be
[59:37] preachers I think of many times of
[59:39] brother bandam how hard he preached we
[59:41] listen to his tapes but look at where he
[59:43] is today wouldn't it be nice to have him
[59:46] come and preach for us still no but he's
[59:48] gone the work is done and he realized
[59:50] that work was done so he did all that he
[59:52] could while he was here how many
[59:54] believes that's what we need to do we
[59:55] need to have the right
[59:57] perspective realize hey folks it ain't
[59:59] going to be long amen isn't long before
[1:00:04] amen it'll cause you to Humble it
[1:00:06] humbles you realize hey you know don't
[1:00:08] be so proud don't think you're
[1:00:10] invincible and everything else amen but
[1:00:13] get the right perspective on things amen
[1:00:17] shows that there is death in the body
[1:00:20] now another point now I want you to
[1:00:22] watch which way the spirit in there
[1:00:24] leans
[1:00:26] amen yeah how many believes it's
[1:00:28] important which way the spirit of
[1:00:31] anybody leans if it's a spirit
[1:00:33] representing light speaking of light
[1:00:35] talking of the light will walk in the
[1:00:38] light touch a beautiful light preach it
[1:00:41] brother hello anden it shows there's a
[1:00:44] reflection coming it's going back to the
[1:00:46] light but if something in there is of
[1:00:49] the darkness and influence by the world
[1:00:51] brother baham says there's nothing but
[1:00:53] for it to turn back into darkness when
[1:00:55] it dies
[1:00:56] into outer Darkness so you
[1:01:02] see so you see what we are we must
[1:01:05] remember that we are only what we are by
[1:01:09] the grace of God none of us can brag
[1:01:12] about it we can only bow in adoration
[1:01:16] and humility before God and give praise
[1:01:19] to him for his
[1:01:23] goodness wouldn't it be nice if
[1:01:25] everybody in the world would do
[1:01:27] that be humble and realize you were
[1:01:30] coming back going back to the dust that
[1:01:32] we came from but our spirit's going back
[1:01:35] to God where it come from and we ought
[1:01:38] to give him praise we ought to give him
[1:01:40] glory and the honor that's do
[1:01:43] him that's what God created man for and
[1:01:46] there's just a small group here doing
[1:01:50] it my isn't it sad
[1:01:54] amen now adoration and humility and we
[1:01:57] find that as long as this King felt that
[1:01:59] way God blessed him but when he got to a
[1:02:02] place that he wanted to not abide in his
[1:02:04] own calling but he wanted to take the
[1:02:06] calling of somebody else and he thought
[1:02:08] because that God had blessed him that it
[1:02:10] was all right that he could do it but
[1:02:12] how sadly we make that mistake oh how
[1:02:16] bad my he says You must absolutely be
[1:02:18] honest you mustn't you mustn't do
[1:02:21] anything unless God has directed you to
[1:02:24] do it and proves it and vindicates it
[1:02:28] and you know that it's God that done
[1:02:31] it
[1:02:33] amen somebody believe that when God
[1:02:35] calls you to something when he places
[1:02:37] you in something stay
[1:02:41] there don't take somebody else's calling
[1:02:44] now brother bam had a real problem with
[1:02:45] that Ain that right because he had the
[1:02:47] businessmen trying to get into Pulpit he
[1:02:50] said even in this message there's a lot
[1:02:52] of preachers out there ought to be in
[1:02:53] the Pulpit he say you businessmen stay
[1:02:56] out of the puppet why do you ain't got
[1:02:58] got a hard enough time keeping it
[1:03:01] straight
[1:03:03] amen otherwise what happens there's a
[1:03:06] lot of impersonation that comes around
[1:03:08] ain't that
[1:03:09] right all
[1:03:12] right praise the
[1:03:16] Lord so we see and we notice that this
[1:03:19] King and another thing we learned from
[1:03:21] here from Uzziah that when he was called
[1:03:24] down by the man
[1:03:26] who had the authority to take the sensor
[1:03:28] in the consecrated man for the service
[1:03:31] when he called him down he got angry
[1:03:33] with
[1:03:34] him amen oh what a cursive thing that
[1:03:37] would be when a man tries to point out
[1:03:39] to a fellow that you're in the wrong and
[1:03:42] prove it to him by the word of God
[1:03:44] you're in the wrong and then that man
[1:03:46] because he feels in himself he'll do
[1:03:47] what he wants to he won't submit to the
[1:03:50] word then he gets
[1:03:53] angry amen
[1:03:56] praise the Lord if you'll notice what
[1:03:58] happened to the king leprosy broke out
[1:04:01] on his face while he was still in his
[1:04:02] anger lepry struck Isa Uzziah in the
[1:04:06] face and the priest and those recognized
[1:04:08] and threw him out of Temple and he died
[1:04:10] a leper that great life that started out
[1:04:13] so well ended up be to be a leper cast
[1:04:16] out and had to live in a separate house
[1:04:18] out to himself all the days of his life
[1:04:20] that man and theight in God had once
[1:04:23] influence amen one once an influential
[1:04:27] life now he was an outcast and
[1:04:30] everything and I'd say with respects we
[1:04:33] got men today in the field young men
[1:04:34] middle-aged men old men who started out
[1:04:37] on a good run and tried and made a go
[1:04:40] good shto God but we find them today out
[1:04:43] y under alcoholics and broke up amen
[1:04:47] there in the other away from us some of
[1:04:49] them backslid all together some of them
[1:04:51] me money crazy some of them went women
[1:04:54] and crazy and married other women that
[1:04:56] wasn't their wives all the things and
[1:04:58] the the disgrace that's been brought on
[1:05:00] every denomination we one can't tell one
[1:05:03] from the tell the other bad because
[1:05:05] they're all
[1:05:07] guilty every denomination we found men
[1:05:09] like that that's once influenced by God
[1:05:11] had a great influence to the people and
[1:05:13] yet they felt
[1:05:14] self-sufficient how many knows that part
[1:05:17] of humility is submitting yourself to
[1:05:20] the word of God submitting yourself to
[1:05:23] the truth how many those those Pharisees
[1:05:25] did had too much
[1:05:28] pride amen and pride brought what what
[1:05:32] did Pride they were they thought they
[1:05:33] were something they want the when they
[1:05:36] made prayers they made long prayers to
[1:05:38] be heard of men they love the uppermost
[1:05:40] seats in the
[1:05:42] synagogues and to them when Jesus come
[1:05:44] along he was some some woman that wasn't
[1:05:48] married when she got
[1:05:50] pregnant and she he was an illegitimate
[1:05:53] child to them that's what they thought
[1:05:54] of him and and when he come doing
[1:05:56] Miracles and and wonders Amen in a
[1:05:59] humble humble like he was they just
[1:06:03] couldn't receive it because of the pride
[1:06:05] that they had cuz how many knows that
[1:06:07] when the truth comes from all those
[1:06:09] churches out there with the prophet of
[1:06:11] God when God came they should all
[1:06:13] humbled themselves and said yes that's
[1:06:15] the truth but they had too much
[1:06:18] pride pride is a terrible thing
[1:06:22] folks it kept let me just say this this
[1:06:25] Pride led the Pharisees to jealousy
[1:06:28] their jealousy LED them to hatred and
[1:06:31] their hatred LED them to
[1:06:33] murder is that where it goes that's
[1:06:36] where Pride takes you that's where
[1:06:38] sometimes when you're telling people
[1:06:40] about the baptism and the the father son
[1:06:42] the holy ghost that nobody ever was some
[1:06:44] of them people some of them that you'll
[1:06:46] meet they'll get Plum mad at you you
[1:06:50] recognize right then that that's not the
[1:06:52] spirit of God that's a devil in there
[1:06:55] amen
[1:06:56] amen a spirit of Pride they they don't
[1:06:58] want to Humble themselves to the
[1:07:02] truth you got to humble yourself to the
[1:07:05] truth where would they be at today if
[1:07:08] they had just humbled themselves to the
[1:07:11] truth I believe that's what every one of
[1:07:13] us come to church for and if the word
[1:07:16] says it prophet of God said it we say
[1:07:19] amen I don't care if you're doing
[1:07:22] something contrary to don't try to
[1:07:24] justify yourself
[1:07:26] cuz that's a lot of people do it people
[1:07:28] in the message they'll find a quote
[1:07:29] they'll find this that or do they to
[1:07:31] justify themselves but they're still not
[1:07:34] right they're just too proud to
[1:07:40] submit my my all right we won't go down
[1:07:43] that road too far Pride came in
[1:07:47] amen oh my 61 where we're
[1:07:50] at praise the
[1:07:53] Lord many disgraces come
[1:07:56] many
[1:07:59] disgraces from people who still want to
[1:08:02] have their own way and won't humble
[1:08:04] themselves ain't that
[1:08:06] right listen when a man gets to a place
[1:08:09] where he can influence for God he ought
[1:08:12] to Humble himself all the
[1:08:15] time
[1:08:22] constantly how many knows God dwells in
[1:08:25] humil
[1:08:27] and we are to clothe
[1:08:29] ourselves the way he did with
[1:08:32] humility that's supposed to be our dress
[1:08:34] wear what we clothe ourselves with is
[1:08:38] humility and the one thing that God
[1:08:40] helped the prophet of God to do all of
[1:08:42] his life is that
[1:08:46] right was stay
[1:08:50] humble when I was back in the
[1:08:53] office I was thinking about this
[1:08:56] and I remember brother brandham saying
[1:08:57] something to his children about great
[1:09:01] men that came out of
[1:09:03] Kentucky was it one of them Abraham
[1:09:06] Lincoln who was the other
[1:09:09] one Daniel Boone maybe all right Daniel
[1:09:13] Boone and and Abraham
[1:09:16] Lincoln and then he went to say and your
[1:09:20] dad y'all now brother baham said that
[1:09:23] but he says no no that that's not right
[1:09:25] I don't need to feel that way ain't that
[1:09:28] right go listen to it he says no no no
[1:09:31] don't don't start getting lifted up in
[1:09:33] Pride even though we know that's the
[1:09:36] truth ain't that right even though we
[1:09:38] know the truth but there was a thought
[1:09:40] trying to come in to try to make him get
[1:09:42] lifted up amen how many believ we all
[1:09:46] got to watch that got to watch that
[1:09:49] Pride coming in
[1:09:52] amen all right
[1:09:56] now and we find out that this King died
[1:09:58] in disgrace a leper leper and he was a
[1:10:02] lesson to the young Prophet not to put
[1:10:04] hopes upon any man but to look to God
[1:10:09] only when he begin to look at a man for
[1:10:11] an example this man failed yet being a
[1:10:15] good man and we find out that the king
[1:10:17] died in disgrace of leper leper and he
[1:10:20] was a lesson to the young Prophet not to
[1:10:23] put his hopes upon any man but to look
[1:10:26] to God only now how many knows we do
[1:10:30] brother Bram taught he knows that we all
[1:10:32] are influenced by each other we
[1:10:34] influence each other isn't that
[1:10:39] right people around the message have
[1:10:41] great preachers and this great preacher
[1:10:44] never ever put your confidence in a
[1:10:47] man amen you have confidence in him as
[1:10:50] far as you know you're trusting he'll
[1:10:52] stay true and but brother B says man is
[1:10:55] so full of
[1:10:57] failures do you realize when brother
[1:10:59] bham said that told the story of how
[1:11:01] that he married a couple of couples and
[1:11:03] and later on he was going and checking
[1:11:05] on them seeing how they was doing ain't
[1:11:08] that right and they came up close to the
[1:11:09] house and he heard him inside and he
[1:11:12] just kind of hung
[1:11:13] outside and listened to him a little bit
[1:11:16] well that woman never he she completely
[1:11:18] rejected the message because she thought
[1:11:21] he was like a Peeping Tom or a you know
[1:11:24] this side or the other
[1:11:29] can you imagine he was being honest no
[1:11:32] he just stopped for a minute to listen
[1:11:33] to see how their conversation really was
[1:11:36] remember he said that to the rich the
[1:11:37] Richer ones he stopped at their house
[1:11:39] and boy they were even there fussing
[1:11:41] about this that and fussing about that
[1:11:43] he knocked on the door finally and they
[1:11:45] opened up and said oh how you doing
[1:11:47] brother bam how y'all getting along oh
[1:11:49] we're doing just
[1:11:50] wonderful but said no be honest
[1:11:56] but the other couple you know the poor
[1:11:57] couple as we know he says oh honey I
[1:11:59] really wanted to get that dress for you
[1:12:01] with the money that I had this week but
[1:12:02] I just can't quite do it and she says oh
[1:12:05] I don't need that we're just I'm just
[1:12:07] fine yeah but I really wanted to get he
[1:12:09] says now there's a real couple right
[1:12:10] there is know
[1:12:12] right it wasn't anything evil about it
[1:12:16] he's just wanted he cared for people
[1:12:18] amen but because of of person's pride
[1:12:21] and everything else look where it got
[1:12:23] him look at where it got them Pharisees
[1:12:25] and the scribes even though they
[1:12:27] realized Jesus couldn't do these things
[1:12:29] unless God was with him but it just
[1:12:31] didn't fit their criteria and their
[1:12:33] frame of mind in the way that they were
[1:12:35] thinking they weren't ready willing to
[1:12:37] Humble their minds down to hey you know
[1:12:39] what we're wrong he's
[1:12:41] right
[1:12:43] amen boy that goes for this generation
[1:12:46] a't that right that goes for this
[1:12:48] generation what a lesson for the young
[1:12:50] Prophet all the hopes look to God I like
[1:12:52] that as you see for a long time he had
[1:12:55] influence he influenced Isaiah and
[1:12:57] Isaiah had confidence in Uzziah and all
[1:13:00] this but then that all fell apart and he
[1:13:02] went into the temple and he learned what
[1:13:05] he's supposed to look at doesn't matter
[1:13:07] what preacher we don't want any preacher
[1:13:09] to fall we don't want anybody to fall
[1:13:11] but if they do then where do you stand
[1:13:15] is't that right then is your real
[1:13:18] confidence in a man or is it in
[1:13:20] God Amen brother brandom how many knows
[1:13:23] he had faults he had failures amen that
[1:13:26] he told what the failures and the faults
[1:13:27] were amen sure we're full of failures
[1:13:31] and faults my un so
[1:13:33] listen so that's a lesson to us tonight
[1:13:36] to keep our minds upon
[1:13:39] God regardless of what man it is let him
[1:13:42] be Cardinal or priest or Prophet or
[1:13:45] whatever it might be he is not immune
[1:13:47] from M from mistakes and error and even
[1:13:50] death and sin but there's one who is and
[1:13:53] that's Jesus Christ he's immune from all
[1:13:56] of that amen but this Isaiah learned a
[1:13:58] lesson God orders his man to his place
[1:14:01] amen listen and the man no man has a
[1:14:03] right to take up and say well I'd make
[1:14:05] an easy living if I was a minister I
[1:14:08] believe I'll study the ministry I
[1:14:09] believe I'll do this that or the other I
[1:14:11] believe if I would impersonate this gift
[1:14:13] of God has given brother Bram said many
[1:14:15] of them impersonated him ain't that
[1:14:17] right I'll have great compan compa so
[1:14:20] forth we see so much of that today amen
[1:14:25] now listen so what a
[1:14:27] change where are we at number
[1:14:29] 70 what a change what a
[1:14:35] change what an influence this must have
[1:14:38] been upon this young Prophet when he saw
[1:14:40] the failure of man and though although
[1:14:44] good men would fail but now he sees God
[1:14:49] and he sees these
[1:14:51] seraphim and notice the special covering
[1:14:53] of these seraphim had they was covered
[1:14:56] with two Wings over their face two wings
[1:14:57] of their feet and two was for flying
[1:15:00] wings God is all together holy think of
[1:15:02] it even angels has to cover their holy
[1:15:04] face to stand in the presence of God I
[1:15:09] wonder my brother I wonder my sisters if
[1:15:11] we'll look at that when Holy Angels has
[1:15:15] to cover their face to stand in the
[1:15:17] presence of God in reverence and respect
[1:15:22] amen and I thought of that I thought you
[1:15:24] know
[1:15:25] before I even begin to study I thought
[1:15:27] what is reverence I thought to me
[1:15:30] reverence is respect so when I heard
[1:15:32] brother Bram said I thought well my mind
[1:15:34] must be on the right Channel with
[1:15:36] reverence and in respect but today we
[1:15:40] find people who call themselves
[1:15:41] Christians even has no respect at all
[1:15:44] for God or his word or his people or his
[1:15:46] ministry or nothing where are they going
[1:15:48] to come up at in the Resurrection the
[1:15:50] Bible says if the righteous scarcely be
[1:15:52] saved where will the Sinner and the
[1:15:55] ungodly
[1:15:56] appear so how many believes it's
[1:15:58] important to Keep Your Eyes Upon Jesus
[1:16:02] keep your eyes on
[1:16:08] God how many believes that we can see
[1:16:11] God we can see God in his Universe all
[1:16:15] the Earth is filled with his glory you
[1:16:17] can see him in the trees you can see him
[1:16:19] in these things and as I was studying
[1:16:21] today something unique happened
[1:16:23] something happened that I never had
[1:16:25] happened before and I just kind of
[1:16:27] followed it and I begin to write what
[1:16:31] it's like to see
[1:16:32] God Amen and so I don't know if it's a
[1:16:36] Psalm or if a song or a Psalm or what it
[1:16:39] is but I'm going to share it with you I
[1:16:41] told my wife on the way to here I said I
[1:16:43] feel like the Lord just give me
[1:16:44] something I don't know what it is but
[1:16:46] I'm going to share with everybody
[1:16:47] tonight amen this is what I wrote right
[1:16:50] here in the middle of my sermon today
[1:16:55] as I begin to thinking about when you
[1:16:57] look at
[1:16:59] God can you see God all around you it
[1:17:03] says look at God in the
[1:17:06] oceans
[1:17:08] amen the fish the great whales all that
[1:17:13] there is out there so unique isn't that
[1:17:15] look at God in the oceans and in every
[1:17:19] motion because this week I was thinking
[1:17:22] of the uniqueness of how God has
[1:17:24] designed
[1:17:27] everything every
[1:17:30] motion every
[1:17:32] motion was designed by
[1:17:36] God the
[1:17:38] smile moving of the
[1:17:41] hands every
[1:17:45] motion look at God in the oceans look at
[1:17:48] the fish to see and in every motion
[1:17:51] every
[1:17:53] fiber and
[1:17:55] Divine
[1:17:58] Design
[1:17:59] amen knowing that it wasn't yours or
[1:18:05] mine makes me fall on my knees to give
[1:18:08] reverence and respect and
[1:18:12] humility amen now let me speak of your
[1:18:17] Divinity because of the fire that you
[1:18:20] have placed in
[1:18:22] me like the woman at the well
[1:18:25] let me also live to tell of your love
[1:18:29] for those who
[1:18:30] fell
[1:18:33] amen amen and that's as far as it
[1:18:36] went amen it has three
[1:18:39] paragraphs
[1:18:41] amen I thought that's right Lord let me
[1:18:45] live like the woman at the well because
[1:18:47] brother brandham in this message says
[1:18:49] you know she went into
[1:18:51] action ain't that right when it came to
[1:18:54] action and he she saw the sign of the
[1:18:56] Messiah amen she ran into the City and
[1:18:59] it says the city believed on on him
[1:19:02] because of what you had
[1:19:04] testified amen says you can't put it out
[1:19:07] amen when there's a fire oh boy here I
[1:19:09] go all the way back to the end of my
[1:19:11] sermon amen when whenever there's a fire
[1:19:14] lit amen it's like trying to put a fire
[1:19:17] out brother bams has a house fire on a
[1:19:20] windy
[1:19:22] day woo so let me lift to tell of your
[1:19:26] love for those who
[1:19:30] fell amen now
[1:19:34] notice all
[1:19:36] right people don't have any respect do
[1:19:39] they to have God all around the glory of
[1:19:45] God the Sun
[1:19:48] going oh my wouldn't it be something
[1:19:51] brother Tommy if we'd say now we don't
[1:19:53] know for sure if it's going to be 7:15
[1:19:56] 5:15 or just what time the sun's going
[1:19:58] to come up tomorrow we're going to go to
[1:20:00] we're going to wait till the sun comes
[1:20:02] up and then go to work cuz it might be 9
[1:20:07] 9:30 you know the next day it might be
[1:20:09] 4:00 in the morning Roost is
[1:20:12] CW lights up the next day it's not till
[1:20:15] noon the sun comes
[1:20:19] up that's these atheist philosophy of
[1:20:22] the Big Bang of something just happened
[1:20:25] happened but we know how many knows that
[1:20:27] it takes a Divine Creator a Divine
[1:20:31] designer to make it absolutely in a 100
[1:20:35] years from now they can tell you when
[1:20:37] that Sun's
[1:20:41] Rising wo when I think about his Divine
[1:20:46] Design oh it's
[1:20:49] divine all around God everywhere but
[1:20:52] they ain't got no respect
[1:20:55] that's why they live like they do they
[1:20:58] ain't nobody worth a time that ain't got
[1:21:00] respect for God how do we ever how does
[1:21:03] the world expect people to have any kind
[1:21:05] of character outside of the Bible and
[1:21:08] outside of Jesus
[1:21:10] Christ that's why we come to church to
[1:21:12] work on our
[1:21:14] character to work on our morals to work
[1:21:17] on what we're supposed to work on they

[1:23:14] women's sports isn't that something

[1:23:19] people will just say well if they want
[1:23:20] this give them if they want that give
[1:23:22] them they said no he says let's give
[1:23:24] some men who have some backbone and
[1:23:26] stand for something how many knows it's
[1:23:29] a real breath of fresh air to hear
[1:23:31] somebody say we're going to take the men
[1:23:33] out of the women's
[1:23:37] sports we'll probably get a lot of hits
[1:23:39] on this one probably some angry
[1:23:42] hits that's all
[1:23:44] right you don't know what side of the
[1:23:46] fence belong on you've lost your
[1:23:50] mind back to our thought we got a couple
[1:23:52] good things here can we go a little
[1:23:54] longer tonight this is a Sunday morning
[1:23:56] one but we've had all Sunday mornings
[1:23:59] lately isn't that all right is't that
[1:24:01] good have all Sunday morning
[1:24:03] Services that's right praise the
[1:24:06] Lord
[1:24:08] okay all right what a change now where
[1:24:11] we're at
[1:24:12] 71 praise the Lord no reverence people
[1:24:15] ain't got no reverence do they no
[1:24:17] respect that's what the world lacks
[1:24:21] reverence first you got to be humble
[1:24:24] then you got to have some respect for
[1:24:28] God if you really want to be a man you
[1:24:31] really want to be a
[1:24:33] woman have respect for
[1:24:36] God realize he's here he's
[1:24:40] everywhere he's watching you he's not
[1:24:43] off somewhere on a distant land he's
[1:24:46] right here oh I got a few more points I
[1:24:49] got to make we notice today that because
[1:24:51] that people they have no reverence to
[1:24:53] come to church people will come to
[1:24:55] church and cut up and laugh how many
[1:24:56] knows that's why we have church
[1:24:58] order that's why we try not to talk in
[1:25:01] the congregation in the sanctuary
[1:25:04] here out of
[1:25:08] respect they'll talk they'll chew cheing
[1:25:11] um sitting where the gospel is being
[1:25:13] preached no reverence at all and meet
[1:25:15] you in the street you don't any expect
[1:25:18] any respect from people we must do that
[1:25:20] but yet it shows Christian dignity to at
[1:25:24] least honor the people and say good
[1:25:28] morning brother Brandon when he went
[1:25:30] down the road he waved at everybody
[1:25:31] didn't he did you ever try that I have
[1:25:35] just wave at everybody you're still in
[1:25:37] Kentucky we're back on 106 people will
[1:25:40] actually wave at you once in a
[1:25:44] while the rest of them are
[1:25:48] like what in the world I don't know
[1:25:52] you look at you funny
[1:25:55] huh but some of them wave anyway brother
[1:25:58] that's just Christian
[1:26:00] dignity what do you do when you go to
[1:26:03] Walmart brother
[1:26:04] Matthew passing everybody out I'll tell
[1:26:07] you what if I don't want to salute
[1:26:09] everybody I just kind of keep my head
[1:26:10] down and keep going what I'm doing I'm
[1:26:12] I'm just doing my
[1:26:15] thing but if I happen to pass you how
[1:26:18] you doing how you
[1:26:20] doing
[1:26:22] hey they'll look at you like
[1:26:26] do I know
[1:26:27] you most of them some people here in
[1:26:29] Kentucky yet they'll not to you how many
[1:26:32] believe that have have a little bit of
[1:26:34] dignity at least recognize people people
[1:26:37] don't recognize each other
[1:26:41] anymore that's right people won't say
[1:26:44] good morning hello can you imagine going
[1:26:46] to Walmart and everybody you pass by
[1:26:48] hello
[1:26:50] hello
[1:26:51] hello hello
[1:26:55] you'd be considered a
[1:27:00] weirdo but it's human dignity Christian
[1:27:04] dignity how many believes we need to
[1:27:06] have
[1:27:08] respect amen that's what's happened with
[1:27:10] our politics no respect isn't that
[1:27:15] right all
[1:27:17] right you don't listen say good morning
[1:27:20] brother or whatever you wish to some of
[1:27:22] them will Pro hell well hello preach oh
[1:27:26] if that ain't common but Bram didn't
[1:27:29] like that too
[1:27:30] well remember Jesus says As you do Under
[1:27:33] the one of these you've done it unto me
[1:27:36] amen and the irreverence you know what
[1:27:38] it is De not conscience of the presence
[1:27:41] of God the world has become so common
[1:27:44] and religion has become such a lowb
[1:27:47] until there's no respects just as it's
[1:27:50] always been how many knows if the
[1:27:53] Pharisees had a real respect for God
[1:27:55] when they knew that your man couldn't do
[1:27:57] that outside of God they they went they
[1:27:59] went and listen to him s Nicodemus isn't
[1:28:02] that right Nicodemus came to him but
[1:28:04] night he had enough respect to at least
[1:28:07] sneak to him none of the others did huh
[1:28:12] to come to him at night and ask what is
[1:28:14] the way what must I do and so forth is
[1:28:17] that
[1:28:20] right that's right but not conscious and
[1:28:22] I wanted to say this that God is
[1:28:25] everywhere God is
[1:28:26] present many knows God is everywhere God
[1:28:29] is
[1:28:31] here but people can't feel it in their
[1:28:33] conscience can
[1:28:36] they he can be right up against people
[1:28:38] he can be
[1:28:41] everywhere the air that they breathe is
[1:28:44] the glory of God how many know he has
[1:28:47] those trees out there making so much
[1:28:49] oxygen he created the world with the
[1:28:52] right oxygen level and everything so you
[1:28:54] could live not have to wear a mask but
[1:28:58] they don't recognize it God is almost
[1:29:00] everywhere except for people's
[1:29:04] heart except for people's heart and
[1:29:07] their
[1:29:09] conscience they're not conscience of God
[1:29:13] conscious of God because let me say it
[1:29:15] this way because God isn't in their
[1:29:19] conscience how many believes God needs
[1:29:21] to be in your conscience then you'll be
[1:29:24] conscience of God and then you'll be
[1:29:26] like the prophet and you'll see him
[1:29:28] everywhere you'll see him in the trees
[1:29:31] you'll see him in the wolf you see them
[1:29:33] everywhere why because you're in the
[1:29:35] presence of God because the presence of
[1:29:38] God is where in you how many believes we
[1:29:41] as children of God Amen are in the
[1:29:44] presence of God and then we have to stay
[1:29:46] humble and realize that even Paul amen
[1:29:50] thought about getting lifted up and he
[1:29:51] wanted he wanted to get highing God and
[1:29:53] he wanted to go up and God kept him
[1:29:56] humble isn't that right kept him
[1:30:02] down
[1:30:04] wow God keeps us
[1:30:08] down keep us as
[1:30:10] humble oh boy I missed some but that's
[1:30:13] okay didn't even
[1:30:15] Jesus with the Rich Young Ruler try to
[1:30:18] Humble him one place he says if a man
[1:30:21] isn't willing to forsake all to follow
[1:30:22] me can you can you imagine that Rich
[1:30:24] Young Ruler he just say you want me to
[1:30:26] sell everything I got I'll have nothing
[1:30:29] I'll be a
[1:30:31] nobody huh it was more than he could do
[1:30:36] Jesus was trying to Humble
[1:30:38] him he needed to become a
[1:30:42] nobody so that God could make something
[1:30:44] out of him because we got to recognize
[1:30:46] true humility is recognizing that it's
[1:30:48] not about
[1:30:50] you hello it's about him and what he
[1:30:53] does through
[1:30:56] you the way up brother baham says he's
[1:30:58] down he took Paul that proud Pharisee he
[1:31:02] said I was a Pharisee of the Pharisee I
[1:31:04] was zealous for Israel and so forth and
[1:31:07] he persecuted the Christians but after
[1:31:10] Jesus come and talk to him he humbled
[1:31:11] him isn't that right then God could use
[1:31:15] him he had to become the very thing that
[1:31:18] he
[1:31:19] persecuted and he had to confess with
[1:31:21] his mouth the thing that I persecuted I
[1:31:22] have become real realizing that I did it
[1:31:25] in my ignorance Moses the great man of
[1:31:28] God remember he was to be the next
[1:31:29] Pharaoh God had to Humble him he had to
[1:31:33] take him on the backs side of the desert
[1:31:34] for 40 years to take that out of him God
[1:31:37] help us take all of me out of me help me
[1:31:41] realize it's not me
[1:31:44] amen you're not the designer I'm not the
[1:31:48] designer he's the designer we come into
[1:31:51] His design not him into our design
[1:31:54] that's what the churches in this world
[1:31:56] and the denominations of this time they
[1:31:58] should all recognize that that was of
[1:32:00] God they should all humbled themselves
[1:32:03] because it lack of humility it was a
[1:32:06] matter of Pride and things that caused
[1:32:08] them not to accept the message this
[1:32:10] hour amen all
[1:32:14] right we'll hurry they're not conscious
[1:32:17] of the presence of God Amen look at them
[1:32:21] soldiers we could think tonight what a
[1:32:24] irrational and a horrible thing it was
[1:32:26] for those soldiers put a rag over his
[1:32:29] face of the Lord to make fun of him
[1:32:31] being a prophet and could know the
[1:32:34] secrets of the heart they put a rag over
[1:32:36] his face set him in the courtyard took a
[1:32:38] stick and struck him on the head and
[1:32:40] passed it one to another said if you be
[1:32:42] a prophet tell us which one of us hit
[1:32:44] you see no respects at
[1:32:48] all how many know that's why people
[1:32:50] don't get God is because they ain't got
[1:32:52] no respect for him
[1:32:54] buddy Robins said he has so much respect
[1:32:56] he says God if you don't come and fill
[1:32:58] me with the Holy Ghost amen you'll F me
[1:33:00] dead these bones in this cornfield
[1:33:03] you'll find me on my bones had that much
[1:33:05] respect that's how much respect that
[1:33:07] people need that's how much
[1:33:10] reverence that we need if you really
[1:33:12] want to get a hold of God the woman at
[1:33:14] the well she had such respect not the
[1:33:16] woman at the well but the woman with the
[1:33:18] blood isue remember
[1:33:20] her oh they touched him they hit him and
[1:33:23] pull his beard out they didn't get
[1:33:25] nothing but the woman just Touch the Hem
[1:33:27] of His
[1:33:28] Garment how many believes that's the way
[1:33:30] it is you come to church come to church
[1:33:35] have
[1:33:37] reverence say Lord let that preacher say
[1:33:39] something that I need you know what I
[1:33:41] have need of and when God speaks to that
[1:33:44] need raise your hand say Lord I accept
[1:33:47] it touch the ham of His
[1:33:50] Garment and be made whole all you got to
[1:33:53] do is Touch the Hem of His Garment it's
[1:33:55] about respect people haven't got no
[1:33:57] respect living in his glory well I just
[1:34:00] finish tonight out on this living in the
[1:34:02] sunshine a't that
[1:34:05] right living in the
[1:34:08] warmth drinking water all from God
[1:34:13] enjoying
[1:34:14] Health enjoying life all come from God
[1:34:17] but they won't even recognize him say we
[1:34:20] come from monkeys
[1:34:26] can you
[1:34:28] imagine brother Joshua it's probably a
[1:34:31] good thing we ain't
[1:34:35] God get him a
[1:34:38] tail we have him Ching like a monkey in
[1:34:40] the drop of a hat you want to talk about
[1:34:42] a monkey I'll make you a
[1:34:48] monkey that's
[1:34:50] right oh my I could preach now
[1:34:55] can you do you realize how easy it would
[1:34:57] be for God to convince the whole world
[1:34:59] that he is God oh he could in a
[1:35:03] heartbeat he could do it in a
[1:35:06] heartbeat amen just like that that one
[1:35:10] guy that said a bunch of bad stuff about
[1:35:12] his friend's religion and Jesus Christ
[1:35:13] and all those bad things happened he got
[1:35:16] back up there says I ain't even GNA say
[1:35:17] him ain't that
[1:35:20] right that's right God convinced him and
[1:35:23] right and he could do that to the whole
[1:35:26] world can you IM imagine if people up
[1:35:29] there am mean says no we come from
[1:35:31] monkeys and right there in front of
[1:35:33] everybody zap he turns into a
[1:35:36] monkey and everybody every maybe
[1:35:40] everybody maybe a bunch of them B say
[1:35:42] yeah that's right they all turned into
[1:35:43] monkeys everybody rais your hand believe
[1:35:45] that they all turned into
[1:35:47] monkeys can you imagine the rest of them
[1:35:49] that didn't they'd
[1:35:51] say whoa there is a God
[1:35:56] there is a God God could convince this
[1:35:59] world but guess what he don't want you
[1:36:02] to have to he don't want you to believe
[1:36:04] that way no he wants you to have faith
[1:36:08] he wants you to have faith to believe
[1:36:11] whether you see anything or not God is
[1:36:13] still
[1:36:15] God that's what pleases God you don't
[1:36:18] have to see it you believe it
[1:36:21] anyway even doubting Thomas got rebuked
[1:36:24] isn't that right unless I touch his
[1:36:26] hands and unless you put my nail scar in
[1:36:29] his hands and he decide I'm not going to
[1:36:32] believe W thank God for Mercy for Thomas
[1:36:36] ain't that right Jesus showed up and
[1:36:39] says come here
[1:36:40] Thomas put your hands in
[1:36:43] here but you here you
[1:36:45] go amen
[1:36:54] this is what comes to my mind in that
[1:36:57] situation
[1:36:59] Thomas this is just me felt so bad about
[1:37:03] what happened he loved the Lord so much
[1:37:07] he didn't want him to go but he did and
[1:37:09] he wanted to see him so bad that he says
[1:37:11] I'm not going to believe it unless I see
[1:37:13] it I want to see him you see God knew
[1:37:17] what was really in Thomas's heart that's
[1:37:20] why he forgive him because if he would
[1:37:23] have been a unbeliever it had been a
[1:37:25] different
[1:37:26] story Thomas was not an unbeliever he
[1:37:29] believed but there's a reason just like
[1:37:31] Paul he persecuted and so to speak
[1:37:35] blasphemed against the Church of God God
[1:37:38] should have taken him for what he did
[1:37:39] against the Church of God ain't that
[1:37:40] right for what he did against the works
[1:37:42] of the Holy Ghost but Paul later come
[1:37:44] and says he says you know the reason God
[1:37:45] forgave me is because I did it in my
[1:37:47] ignorance and God seen that I did it in
[1:37:50] my
[1:37:51] ignorance but let me tell you this
[1:37:53] generation of people who seen the power
[1:37:55] of God it wasn't in their
[1:37:58] ignorance amen and God is the judge of
[1:38:02] who does it in their ignorance and who
[1:38:05] don't I got one more good point to make
[1:38:07] you want me to go a little bit
[1:38:09] longer oh
[1:38:14] my I think this
[1:38:16] is two
[1:38:21] more but that little woman within that
[1:38:23] Faith That Could Touch His Garment she
[1:38:25] got her desires you see we've got to be
[1:38:28] we've got to become conscious conscious
[1:38:31] of God's presence these little five
[1:38:34] senses that we live in that's just a
[1:38:36] little world of our own
[1:38:39] see that's we was only given those so
[1:38:42] that we could c contact this Earthly
[1:38:45] home but there is senses beyond that
[1:38:49] from other
[1:38:52] dimensions and another
[1:38:55] dimension I thought about what I
[1:38:56] preached on that the last time I
[1:38:58] preached on am me believing in Aliens
[1:39:00] and other
[1:39:02] worlds amen other
[1:39:06] dimensions so what is this sense what is
[1:39:09] this sense that's From Another
[1:39:12] Dimension and then Faith that's right
[1:39:15] we've got a sense of Faith it's not from
[1:39:18] this dimension
[1:39:24] what came to my mind when I was studying
[1:39:31] this it's from another
[1:39:33] world From Another
[1:39:36] Dimension God is always present we must
[1:39:39] remember that if we could only remember
[1:39:41] that that angels of the Lord are
[1:39:44] encamped about those that fear Him in
[1:39:47] this building tonight stands Jesus
[1:39:50] Christ in this building is hosts of
[1:39:54] Angels thousands of them gather around
[1:39:58] you don't see them but you can feel the
[1:40:01] influence of
[1:40:06] them how many believe we need to open
[1:40:09] up we need to open up our
[1:40:12] heart we need to be humble and we need
[1:40:15] to be
[1:40:16] respect realize God is
[1:40:19] here in one of the later scriptures that
[1:40:22] quotes just that down from maybe I have
[1:40:24] it here I'm not sure but he says that's
[1:40:25] what I try to get people to believe that
[1:40:28] Jesus is here that God is here if you
[1:40:32] have need of something he's here to
[1:40:34] minister to you how many believe that
[1:40:37] that he's ever
[1:40:40] present
[1:40:42] amen gather around but you can feel the
[1:40:45] influence of them telling you that they
[1:40:47] are here if that isn't so the scripture
[1:40:49] isn't so if the scripture isn't right
[1:40:51] then God isn't right the Bible isn't
[1:40:54] right the angels of God are encamped
[1:40:57] they don't leave they stay right near
[1:40:59] those that fear
[1:41:01] Him Jesus said wherever two or three are
[1:41:03] gathered in my name I'll be in their
[1:41:06] midst that makes him in the world that
[1:41:09] we cannot see that our five senses
