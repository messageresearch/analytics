[1:00:50] that we can boldly May boldly say the
[1:00:52] Lord is my helper and I will not fear
[1:00:55] what man shall do unto me amen amen the
[1:00:59] reason that I read that in uh Hebrews uh
[1:01:05] the point was I will never leave thee
[1:01:09] nor forsake he was is found in Joshua
[1:01:13] the fifth verse where he says I was as I
[1:01:15] was with Moses so will I be with thee I
[1:01:18] will not fail thee nor forsake thee amen
[1:01:22] trying to make sure we understand that
[1:01:24] the promises back there are amen that
[1:01:27] applies to us also that God is speaking
[1:01:30] to us even as he did Joshua brother Ben
[1:01:33] I believe it was in Ephesians parallels
[1:01:35] Joshua amen he talks about how that
[1:01:38] Joshua parallels Ephesians and so forth
[1:01:40] amen and it's amazing how that
[1:01:43] especially all of these actually all of
[1:01:45] these scriptures especially here in the
[1:01:47] first part amen how that it applies to
[1:01:50] us in such a great way especially in
[1:01:52] places like forever The Souls of your
[1:01:55] feet shall tread that have I given to
[1:01:57] you as I said to Moses we know that
[1:01:59] Footprints means possession amen amen in
[1:02:03] the whole Bible amen the land that he
[1:02:05] was talking about is all of the word of
[1:02:07] God isn't that right that's the promised
[1:02:09] land amen so as much as this as you can
[1:02:13] possibly accept and receive it's yours
[1:02:16] amen
[1:02:18] amen now I want to take my I want to
[1:02:20] take a title amen and and I want to call
[1:02:24] it in line of duty in line of duty
[1:02:28] amen
[1:02:30] praise the Lord because you'll notice
[1:02:32] here and I Tuesday chose that as I begin
[1:02:34] to think about it because the one
[1:02:36] scripture actually the thing that kind
[1:02:38] of uh caught my my attention didn't be
[1:02:40] directed in the way that we wanted to go
[1:02:42] was what brother banham said about
[1:02:44] Israel he says and we're told one time
[1:02:46] in the scriptures when the children of
[1:02:48] Israel was following their commission
[1:02:50] going straight in the lion of Duty that
[1:02:53] the Red Sea got in the way of the line
[1:02:56] of duty of the children of God Amen
[1:02:58] going to a promised land and God looked
[1:03:01] down through the pillar of fire and the
[1:03:03] Sea got scared now if you looked at many
[1:03:05] different places Brother Band talks
[1:03:07] about a writer once said this amen so
[1:03:10] but apparently like the writer that
[1:03:12] wrote about God looking down upon the
[1:03:15] sea in that sea getting scared because
[1:03:16] brother Madam uses as many a lot of
[1:03:18] times and especially later in his years
[1:03:21] later from 60 years Sauvignon up perhaps
[1:03:25] uh I mean that's 67 but 57 on up amen he
[1:03:29] many times talked about news this
[1:03:31] whenever he talked about the line of
[1:03:33] duty he many times referred to this amen
[1:03:35] but my thought was this here now he said
[1:03:38] that she got scared and up and up the
[1:03:40] way and they crossed over as on dry
[1:03:43] ground amen praise the Lord so as we
[1:03:47] think about it brother and sisters we
[1:03:48] think about God's line of duty and what
[1:03:51] God told uh Joshua that would happen
[1:03:54] that nobody would be able to stand in
[1:03:58] your way as long as he was in the line
[1:04:02] of duty amen
[1:04:04] now I'm gonna go ahead and I want to
[1:04:06] read something I was going to wait on
[1:04:08] this but I'm going to go ahead
[1:04:10] uh now notice here brother bam says it
[1:04:12] this way he says Joshua after he crossed
[1:04:15] over into the land God gave him a
[1:04:18] promise now if you'll notice first of
[1:04:19] all the one thing that got one one thing
[1:04:21] that the only way that you'll actually
[1:04:23] ever be in in the perfect line of duty
[1:04:26] is if God commissions you to do
[1:04:28] something
[1:04:29] if God tells you to do something amen I
[1:04:31] believe when I was studying this mother
[1:04:33] bam says first of all whatever you do
[1:04:35] it's got to be according to his word and
[1:04:37] then it's got to be God telling you to
[1:04:39] do it amen it's got to be a commission
[1:04:41] that you follow up and when you follow
[1:04:43] that commission out just like he did
[1:04:45] with Moses long ago and we want to maybe
[1:04:47] maybe step back here in the middle we're
[1:04:49] talking about Moses we want to talk
[1:04:50] about David and different ones but let's
[1:04:52] finish the story of Joshua Joshua here
[1:04:54] and I'll notice he said he was given a
[1:04:56] promise now notice God gave him a
[1:04:57] promise that you know and part of that
[1:05:00] promise was that he was to meditate upon
[1:05:02] his law day and night and so forth that
[1:05:03] God would never leave him nor forsake
[1:05:06] Him Amen in every place if all of his
[1:05:08] foot would go amen he would conquer it
[1:05:11] amen now notice after he did after he
[1:05:13] did cross over we know what happened
[1:05:15] amen as he sends spies over amen into
[1:05:18] the promised land and it come across
[1:05:20] Jericho and how many knows that
[1:05:22] Jericho's walls were so big that they
[1:05:24] could run chariot races on top of it
[1:05:27] now I don't know about you but I don't
[1:05:29] know but you know that they've got to be
[1:05:31] at least wide enough I don't know just
[1:05:33] how wide it was but it had to be at
[1:05:35] least wide enough for two Chariot Swifts
[1:05:39] is the way I figure it because you can't
[1:05:41] run a race if you can't pass
[1:05:43] right so it's got to be at least two
[1:05:45] Chariot with you know maybe not much
[1:05:47] more I don't know but anyway they were
[1:05:50] ready to check you can imagine running
[1:05:51] traces up on top of that wall and and we
[1:05:54] all know the story of what happened and
[1:05:55] how that they went over there
[1:05:58] amen and brother bam says now notice he
[1:06:01] says that they fought an entire campaign
[1:06:03] without losing a man
[1:06:06] not one man lost not even getting a
[1:06:10] scratch
[1:06:11] no nurse no first aid no Band-Aid no you
[1:06:16] know the land he said the land
[1:06:18] is yours go fight think you're fighting
[1:06:20] in the com a complete campaign amen and
[1:06:23] nobody ever got hurt nothing ever
[1:06:25] happened bad as long where everybody was
[1:06:28] he perfectly in that line of duty
[1:06:31] now I know what's preachers and I've
[1:06:33] done it in the past that's how I
[1:06:34] preached and hey that's where you want
[1:06:36] to be you want to be in that place or a
[1:06:37] guest spot nobody ever gets you
[1:06:39] scratched nobody ever needs a Band-Aid
[1:06:41] unfortunately that's not how life is
[1:06:46] I hardly know of any scenario I can give
[1:06:49] you many and I will give you many
[1:06:50] scenarios of people who were at Mighty
[1:06:53] Vic
[1:06:53] if you want to talk Mighty victories
[1:06:56] because of people that were in the line
[1:06:57] of duty and also a lot of defeats that
[1:07:00] happened in the line of duty and the
[1:07:02] reason why
[1:07:04] hey man praise the Lord
[1:07:07] so there they were and brother Branham
[1:07:09] of course he'll use this as an
[1:07:10] illustration and so forth and he says
[1:07:12] and they slayed the ammonites the
[1:07:14] Hittites and there wasn't anybody heard
[1:07:17] among them until sin came into the camp
[1:07:21] amen how many knows that they did that
[1:07:23] and my they had such a victory and then
[1:07:25] of course we know what happened was one
[1:07:27] lie one person stepped out of line
[1:07:33] one person stepped out of mind and he
[1:07:35] said 36 men died we all know that I
[1:07:39] believe it was the Twisted the children
[1:07:40] of AI amen that they went up there I
[1:07:42] believe it was and they just sent a
[1:07:44] small number because they're just small
[1:07:46] wait no need of all I was going
[1:07:48] but all of those men that did said they
[1:07:50] come back blood hinge oh man think about
[1:07:53] it Dad that's 36 funerals
[1:07:57] because one
[1:07:59] man didn't do what he was supposed to do
[1:08:01] he come out from behind the line of duty
[1:08:04] and when we come out of the line of duty
[1:08:06] that's when trouble sets in isn't it
[1:08:09] that's when you get defeated I mean no
[1:08:12] matter how much it's God's people it's
[1:08:13] God's commission notice nobody will be
[1:08:16] able to stand before you
[1:08:18] isn't that what God told Joshua nobody's
[1:08:20] going to be able to stand before you but
[1:08:22] here he's defeated
[1:08:25] is that right so they came with hey he
[1:08:28] came with an attack law so to speak that
[1:08:30] you know if everybody stays in line the
[1:08:32] way they're supposed to do if you
[1:08:34] meditate the way it's supposed to do
[1:08:36] amen
[1:08:38] because unfortunately we're living in
[1:08:40] that we're living in an imperfect world
[1:08:43] we like the flipping Christianity are
[1:08:45] you going to be victorious you're going
[1:08:46] to be victorious every time and every
[1:08:48] time and all the time watch out
[1:08:51] you're still a human being you're bound
[1:08:54] to fail
[1:08:55] amen
[1:08:57] oh my but that's right so we look at
[1:08:59] that and so now notice now uh so he says
[1:09:03] if until sin came into Camp why they did
[1:09:06] hide these innocent man because one man
[1:09:09] stepped out of line you see this is why
[1:09:11] it needs to be taught the church lining
[1:09:13] up lining up with the word of God lining
[1:09:16] up with each other perfectly walking
[1:09:17] upright soberly before all men fearing
[1:09:20] God Amen as long as you're in that way
[1:09:22] this is what the prophet says as long as
[1:09:24] you know when a man is in line of duty
[1:09:27] for God there's no gate there's nothing
[1:09:30] that can stand in his way
[1:09:34] there's nothing I can stand nasty wow
[1:09:39] hello
[1:09:41] t-h-i-n-g my spelling is correct nothing
[1:09:44] is gonna stand in your way as long as
[1:09:47] you're in the light enough Duty
[1:09:51] no wealthy you come in front of you
[1:09:56] oh yeah
[1:09:57] things will come up against you you
[1:10:00] can't just expect an easy path with no
[1:10:03] obstacles
[1:10:04] obstacles are gonna come up amen how
[1:10:07] many knows the prophet talk we all know
[1:10:09] the Bible says on Adam and Eve amen
[1:10:11] there were four to five behind the word
[1:10:13] of God as long as he was in the place
[1:10:15] where she was being supposed to be as
[1:10:17] long as adamus was here he's supposed to
[1:10:19] be amen the tree would obam the three
[1:10:22] flowers oh the lion would obam
[1:10:26] every animal with no bam which one Eve
[1:10:30] step
[1:10:36] it brought fear and brought everything
[1:10:38] in the book
[1:10:39] They're the first ones that starts got
[1:10:42] out from the fortification of the word
[1:10:44] of God they got out of line
[1:10:48] hey man that was the first one way back
[1:10:51] there we see where they got out of line
[1:10:53] we think about oh my
[1:10:56] God but I want to talk about a little
[1:10:58] bit let's talk a first of all a few
[1:11:00] victories before we talk about some of
[1:11:01] these things here amen we bring it on
[1:11:04] down let's talk about Moses for a minute
[1:11:06] we know that God came down to Moses Amen
[1:11:08] on the uh on the mountain and he says
[1:11:10] you know amen I have remembered my
[1:11:12] promise to Israel and I have come down
[1:11:14] to deliver them isn't that right that
[1:11:16] was the promise
[1:11:17] after 400 years of them being in bondage
[1:11:22] God said I've come down and I'm going to
[1:11:25] deliver my people and he's gonna deliver
[1:11:27] them amen but there's some things that
[1:11:29] were in his way
[1:11:32] aren't you glad that it doesn't matter
[1:11:35] when God sets out to do something it
[1:11:37] don't matter what's in the way it's
[1:11:39] gonna get put to the side
[1:11:42] y'all it's going to overcome Pharaoh was
[1:11:44] the first one that was in his way amen
[1:11:47] and we know what happened to him isn't
[1:11:49] that right God actually overcome pharaoh
[1:11:52] don't ever think that God won't overcome
[1:11:55] it
[1:11:56] for every victory that I have I give God
[1:12:00] the the blessing I give him amen at the
[1:12:05] reward so to speak
[1:12:06] I give him the honor and for every
[1:12:09] defeat that I have I blame myself
[1:12:13] don't blame God
[1:12:15] no God don't the god ain't defeated
[1:12:18] but we get defeated so when you get
[1:12:21] defeated don't blame God
[1:12:23] amen
[1:12:25] so listen though listen to that amen oh
[1:12:29] what a great Victory Israel had isn't
[1:12:32] that right finally they overcome though
[1:12:34] it out oh we can see it read it again
[1:12:39] we're all rejoicing and shouting and all
[1:12:42] them and praising God and took all their
[1:12:45] luck it's the clanging of the pots and
[1:12:47] the pans and all the animals they were
[1:12:49] all heading out of Egypt a long string
[1:12:52] of two million people
[1:12:54] all rejoicing because guess what
[1:12:57] they're obstacle was out of the way now
[1:13:01] because they had a line of duty and that
[1:13:03] was that God was going to deliver to his
[1:13:05] people and take him over into the
[1:13:08] promised land now anything that was
[1:13:10] going to come in the way of them coming
[1:13:11] into the promised land had to get put
[1:13:14] out of the way
[1:13:15] amen
[1:13:17] praise the Lord
[1:13:19] and I noticing they were on their Road
[1:13:20] marching then coming out there was a
[1:13:23] pillar of a fire before them and they
[1:13:25] marched on to the Red Sea and when they
[1:13:28] got there right there in the line of
[1:13:31] duty laid an obstacle
[1:13:34] amen and the first thing you know fear
[1:13:38] struck them and they didn't know what to
[1:13:41] do
[1:13:43] I mean oh sometimes we as Christians and
[1:13:45] everything sometimes an obstacle come
[1:13:47] our way they're bound to come our way
[1:13:52] that's the way people does today when
[1:13:54] fear strikes them when they're right in
[1:13:57] the path of Duty listen brother let me
[1:13:59] say this if you're walking in the light
[1:14:02] having fellowship with God
[1:14:06] I hope that's where you're walking
[1:14:07] everybody walking like that everyone
[1:14:09] walking in the light
[1:14:11] a lot of y'all Darkly walk in the
[1:14:13] darkness if I'm looking for a hand to go
[1:14:15] up
[1:14:16] huh
[1:14:18] walking in the line having Fellowship
[1:14:21] everything's going good
[1:14:25] all them times clear everything gone
[1:14:28] good walking in the light having
[1:14:30] fellowship with almighty God
[1:14:33] amen with his people and the Holy Spirit
[1:14:36] is upon you
[1:14:38] and then sometimes you'll meet an
[1:14:40] obstacle right there in the path of Duty
[1:14:43] what do you do
[1:14:45] amen what do you do
[1:14:49] listen he says don't stop just keep
[1:14:52] pressing on
[1:14:54] God Will Make A Way Through It
[1:14:58] praise the Lord
[1:15:01] gotta make a way through it that's one
[1:15:03] of the greatest experiences of my life
[1:15:05] is to see God Amen and when I can't get
[1:15:08] over it under door honored or anyway God
[1:15:10] opens up a way and I go through it
[1:15:12] somehow or another his face is
[1:15:15] sufficient to carry us through that's
[1:15:18] why we read the scriptures when I know
[1:15:20] that God is my helper I will not cheer
[1:15:24] what man will do to me or trust
[1:15:28] you ain't gotta worry in the world as
[1:15:31] long as you're in the line of duty
[1:15:33] you've got every worry in the world
[1:15:36] every fear every problem amen if you're
[1:15:38] out of the line of duty
[1:15:42] amen
[1:15:45] praise the Lord
[1:15:48] amen really this is for believers amen
[1:15:51] this is for believers
[1:15:53] who are already lined up with God
[1:15:56] amen and for unbelievers well guess what
[1:16:00] unbelief is in your way
[1:16:03] so you can even say Lord help me get me
[1:16:05] in the line of duty and that is to
[1:16:07] believe your word and that Spirit of
[1:16:09] unbelief will have to get out of my life
[1:16:10] well I've been seeking even brother but
[1:16:12] I'm talking about the line of duty
[1:16:13] people why I've tried for 10 years to
[1:16:16] get the Holy Ghost well guess what just
[1:16:18] stay in line with the word keep
[1:16:20] believing God will bring you through
[1:16:22] aren't you glad for that God Will Make A
[1:16:24] Way sure nothing they could do but still
[1:16:27] Moes are there and also I've read many
[1:16:30] places where brother man preached on
[1:16:32] this and talking about having
[1:16:33] conferences with God whenever you get
[1:16:35] into this place to where I can't get
[1:16:37] over it can't get under it and then you
[1:16:39] know yourself doing what you're supposed
[1:16:40] to do
[1:16:41] amen
[1:16:43] and then things happen that you ought I
[1:16:45] read one book word but events it seems
[1:16:47] like you know without an understanding
[1:16:49] he says you know seems like the
[1:16:50] spiritual walk with God is amen it's a
[1:16:53] very hard hard walk
[1:16:55] because things happen to you you think
[1:16:57] they ought to happen
[1:16:59] he says but that's God's way of doing it
[1:17:03] amen all right
[1:17:05] praise the Lord
[1:17:07] oh my
[1:17:09] fear strike there now notice he says
[1:17:12] you'll meet don't stop just keep
[1:17:13] pressing on Amen because God Will Make A
[1:17:17] Way
[1:17:18] he's mixed away
[1:17:21] no matter what how big the obstacle is
[1:17:24] if you're Christian and you're in love
[1:17:26] with the Lord no matter how big it is
[1:17:28] because that Red Sea was big hello that
[1:17:31] was a big problem but God took care of
[1:17:34] it not didn't he because they were in
[1:17:36] the line of duty
[1:17:38] amen
[1:17:40] I mean I want to finish tonight with
[1:17:42] talk a little bit about your post of
[1:17:43] Duty amen I might as well have a
[1:17:46] positive duty but God places you and if
[1:17:49] you're at your post of Duty then you're
[1:17:51] in line the duty
[1:17:53] amen praise the Lord
[1:17:56] all right
[1:17:58] so let's look at this Joshua Joshua he
[1:18:01] of course you know he had a lot of
[1:18:03] obstacles he had to get that Obstacle of
[1:18:06] Aiken out of the way
[1:18:08] boy oh boy find a way to get rid of the
[1:18:10] problem huh
[1:18:13] stoned them and burned them with fire
[1:18:15] from what I understand get that unbelief
[1:18:18] out of there
[1:18:20] Lord help us get that unbelief out of
[1:18:23] there amen
[1:18:25] Joshua
[1:18:27] Moses amen are both of those now let's
[1:18:30] talk about Daniel for just a minute how
[1:18:32] about Daniel how many knows that uh
[1:18:34] Birdman talks about he's been actually
[1:18:36] mentioned seeds when he talks about but
[1:18:37] he said Daniel he was in the line of
[1:18:39] duty because even though he was in
[1:18:41] Babylon and so forth he had committed
[1:18:43] himself not to defiled himself with the
[1:18:45] things everybody else was
[1:18:47] and he had committed himself to praying
[1:18:49] what three times a day you know and
[1:18:52] there was some man that didn't like
[1:18:54] Daniel they wanted to trap him and of
[1:18:56] course they made a lot it says if
[1:18:57] anybody traced anybody up but their God
[1:19:00] for about a week I guess it was amen let
[1:19:03] him be thrown into the lion's den
[1:19:05] and that Governors foolishly signed his
[1:19:08] name to it can't be changed
[1:19:11] couldn't be changed and they should have
[1:19:13] caught him
[1:19:14] but what is it Daniel he didn't care
[1:19:17] amen he went in the line of duty God
[1:19:21] come on the scene because he was doing
[1:19:22] what God wanted him to do
[1:19:26] if you haven't experienced it I I have
[1:19:30] I know what it's like to have God put
[1:19:33] you somewhere it doesn't matter what man
[1:19:36] woman or whatever comes your way if you
[1:19:38] just stand there and committed to God
[1:19:40] watch God take you through
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:44] but you got to be in the you got to know
[1:19:47] you got to have a revelation of your
[1:19:49] church you gotta have a revelation of
[1:19:50] your pastor you gotta have a revelation
[1:19:52] of where you're supposed to be
[1:19:54] amen
[1:19:56] because if you don't there's no way to
[1:19:58] have any confidence but what happened we
[1:20:01] know that God stop the mouth of the
[1:20:03] Lions
[1:20:04] now let me ask you this I thought about
[1:20:06] this what about those who can hide all
[1:20:09] this were they in the line of duty
[1:20:12] they weren't in line of duty when they
[1:20:14] throwed him in they got child on
[1:20:17] to eat him up why because they were not
[1:20:19] in the line of duty
[1:20:22] my
[1:20:25] Daniel
[1:20:27] another one I want to talk about
[1:20:30] for a minute
[1:20:32] let's talk about some examples of people
[1:20:34] who were in the line of duty and did
[1:20:37] great things
[1:20:38] step out of that line and had the
[1:20:41] suffering
[1:20:42] because how many knows that whenever sin
[1:20:44] there's one thing that if he comes in to
[1:20:46] your life it's an obstacle amen it's
[1:20:50] something that will not cause God to
[1:20:53] bless you anymore
[1:20:55] amen I don't care how much Holy Ghost
[1:20:58] you got how much Christian you are if
[1:21:00] you let sin come in you get out of the
[1:21:03] line of where you're supposed to be
[1:21:04] you're not in the place that you ought
[1:21:05] to be remember the Bible close if Israel
[1:21:08] never left their Homeland amen they
[1:21:11] would be cursed they got to stay in the
[1:21:14] Homeland that's what you and I gotta do
[1:21:16] stay in the Homeland
[1:21:19] David think about it
[1:21:22] he was back on the backside of the
[1:21:24] desert praying and having his uh Jubilee
[1:21:28] and praying and reading his Bible and
[1:21:30] having fellowship with God and
[1:21:32] everything was going great until a bear
[1:21:34] came and took his little sheep
[1:21:37] huh
[1:21:38] I don't know about you but it'd take a
[1:21:41] lot of man to attack a bear
[1:21:43] huh
[1:21:44] I don't know how big this bear was maybe
[1:21:46] we'll get to see it someday Lord play us
[1:21:49] to take amen of of David and how big
[1:21:51] this bear was I want to see where he
[1:21:53] stabbed him I want to see what he did
[1:21:55] amen
[1:21:56] would you like to see that
[1:21:59] amen David went out there he says I'm in
[1:22:02] the line well that's supposed to be
[1:22:03] you're taking you're not getting you get
[1:22:05] your grumpy pause up my property
[1:22:08] [Music]
[1:22:10] I believe that's what a lot of
[1:22:12] Christians ought to be saying if you
[1:22:13] ain't got the joy of the Lord and the
[1:22:15] devil's coming sold that from you now
[1:22:17] obstacle Scott and your way of your walk
[1:22:19] with the Lord and your pizza you said
[1:22:20] devil you get your grabby hands up you
[1:22:23] ain't got no right here
[1:22:24] I'm in a lot of Duty
[1:22:27] all right
[1:22:29] went out there and killed out there
[1:22:32] was that it oh God allowed a lion
[1:22:36] to come his way
[1:22:38] oh my
[1:22:40] can I just say what comes to this gray
[1:22:43] matter
[1:22:44] I wonder what guy would do that why
[1:22:46] would God all of a sudden just let a
[1:22:48] bear come and take David's little sheep
[1:22:51] why wouldn't God allow a lion to come
[1:22:53] and take a sheep
[1:22:58] huh
[1:23:00] that's good that's the correct answer
[1:23:02] because I'm ready for Goliath he was
[1:23:05] getting ready for bigger things let me
[1:23:07] tell you something you wonder why you
[1:23:09] have the little problems that you do oh
[1:23:11] this just irritates me well were you
[1:23:14] gonna have to do a whole lot better than
[1:23:16] that down the road
[1:23:19] all right
[1:23:21] God I wish there would no have to go
[1:23:23] through some of the things I've had to
[1:23:25] go through in my life
[1:23:28] I'd rather not do it Austin
[1:23:31] but now what can I say at the end of it
[1:23:33] all
[1:23:34] I can have a whole lot of compassion now
[1:23:36] for people that are going through stuff
[1:23:39] I can feel for people a whole lot more
[1:23:42] and all this petty little stuff that's
[1:23:43] just little bitty what are you talking
[1:23:45] about you give me a big trial if you're
[1:23:47] gonna give me one
[1:23:50] [Laughter]
[1:23:56] oh my you have a flat tire and you want
[1:23:58] to get upset you have a little bit this
[1:24:00] Saturday under a setback and this out of
[1:24:02] the other one come on folks you're gonna
[1:24:04] have to be a lot worse than that
[1:24:06] that's the way David felt he says what
[1:24:09] did he say what did David say I believe
[1:24:11] in he says look your servant was in the
[1:24:14] field and there was a lion and a bear I
[1:24:16] took care of them
[1:24:18] I took care of them who's this big old
[1:24:21] uncircumcised Philistine he's in the
[1:24:23] line of Israel's Duty
[1:24:26] he's standing in the way
[1:24:30] God help us anything that's standing in
[1:24:33] your way bring it down
[1:24:35] [Applause]
[1:24:36] he said I'll cut his head off
[1:24:40] that's what he referred to his
[1:24:42] experience
[1:24:44] amen
[1:24:45] but what was it Goliath was standing in
[1:24:47] the lion of Israel's Duty amen God
[1:24:50] magnify David because of it is that
[1:24:53] right
[1:24:55] mine
[1:24:57] that's right he was in a lot of Duty did
[1:24:59] great things they sang songs about David
[1:25:04] help
[1:25:05] swell Saul killed her thousands Dave
[1:25:11] about his ten thousands
[1:25:14] huh
[1:25:15] Saul heard this what
[1:25:17] he said thousand times to get a thousand
[1:25:23] that what day it saw was saw was a
[1:25:26] whimper folks he was a general James he
[1:25:29] was a jealous cry baby
[1:25:31] you know how many times he got mad and
[1:25:34] Sewer Spirit David because man he's
[1:25:36] better than I am and this added the
[1:25:38] other he had a complex
[1:25:42] whining about this out of the other he
[1:25:44] should have said
[1:25:48] that's all well he had to try to get rid
[1:25:51] of him he wanted to be the greatest
[1:25:53] anyway
[1:25:56] praise the Lord
[1:25:59] there he was
[1:26:01] and David look what he did
[1:26:04] after a while the song wasn't so pretty
[1:26:06] anymore
[1:26:08] because David stepped out of line
[1:26:11] is that right from the Lord with
[1:26:13] Bathsheba
[1:26:15] and whoa whoa
[1:26:18] whoa
[1:26:20] man his enemies
[1:26:23] did all kinds of things isn't that right
[1:26:27] Oh my he suffered greatly great terrible
[1:26:31] things happened to David
[1:26:34] man when I read that about all the
[1:26:35] things that happened to him it'd be
[1:26:37] enough to make somebody want to shoot
[1:26:39] their self he was terrible
[1:26:41] his name was dirt
[1:26:45] and when they thought about David they
[1:26:46] thought that dirt you know
[1:26:48] you know what
[1:26:50] I've heard said
[1:26:52] by message believer that David he was
[1:26:56] such a rasque he had a real terrible
[1:26:58] name for David
[1:27:00] and that's what he felt about David
[1:27:03] now David did some raunchy terrible
[1:27:05] things didn't he but for a message
[1:27:07] believer to still think that of David uh
[1:27:10] uh man
[1:27:12] I don't think so
[1:27:13] because how many know God forgive him
[1:27:16] God raised that man back up
[1:27:18] amen he held that man
[1:27:21] somebody that has that kind of an
[1:27:23] attitude I believe needs Deliverance by
[1:27:25] almighty God
[1:27:26] could help with their own attitude amen
[1:27:28] it stinks
[1:27:30] that's right because even though he did
[1:27:32] all that he was the man after God own
[1:27:34] heart he would repent at the drop of a
[1:27:37] hat the second that he was reproved the
[1:27:39] second amen he was found out he's God
[1:27:42] help me
[1:27:43] Forgive Me Lord
[1:27:45] amen
[1:27:48] amen he was an example
[1:27:51] great wonderful man but because he
[1:27:54] stepped out of line
[1:27:55] amen all these things happen many people
[1:27:58] died his own son
[1:28:00] isn't that right his favorite son died
[1:28:02] got hung on a tree and somebody killed
[1:28:05] him speared him through I'm thinking
[1:28:07] that he killed the man that killed him
[1:28:11] is that right he came and says I killed
[1:28:13] him you shouldn't have said that
[1:28:16] you killed my son
[1:28:18] he killed him if I'm not wrong
[1:28:20] that's right why because you don't touch
[1:28:22] you don't touch God's Prophet son
[1:28:27] amen
[1:28:28] let me tell you something I'll say this
[1:28:30] a lot of people and I I want to be
[1:28:33] careful here a lot of people disagree
[1:28:34] with what's going on in Jefferson
[1:28:36] perhaps Joseph is doing stuff but this
[1:28:39] man's mouth is very careful about what
[1:28:41] he says about any of God's children
[1:28:42] Apophis kids
[1:28:44] why because guess what I I haven't got
[1:28:47] nothing to do with it they'll answer to
[1:28:49] God for it if you're doing something
[1:28:50] wrong you know
[1:28:52] amen
[1:28:54] all right let's go on
[1:28:57] so David's how about Samson
[1:29:00] Samson wow he had a lot of obstacles
[1:29:03] came in his way isn't that right
[1:29:05] whenever an Ops they come coming his way
[1:29:07] it talks about I believe Brother band
[1:29:09] was talking about he said they had ropes
[1:29:11] man that horses couldn't pull the ropes
[1:29:13] apart horses couldn't wrote the pulse
[1:29:15] apart whenever he got a hold of him
[1:29:17] [Music]
[1:29:20] that's right just tore it like a thread
[1:29:23] every time he get in the pen she was in
[1:29:25] the line of duty it wasn't this
[1:29:28] The Celestine couldn't stop him
[1:29:31] and Donaldson couldn't have
[1:29:33] because he was getting this Supernatural
[1:29:35] I don't know about you or brother Tommy
[1:29:36] or any of the strongest of us after
[1:29:38] killing us a thousand Philistines we
[1:29:41] would probably be wore out we'd probably
[1:29:44] get the five other and say that's it
[1:29:45] somebody else take over
[1:29:49] but he killed a thousand and somehow he
[1:29:51] supernaturally had the power isn't that
[1:29:53] right
[1:29:54] that God come down and he imparted him
[1:29:57] because why because Samson was in the
[1:29:59] line of duty he was where he was
[1:30:01] supposed to be
[1:30:03] I'm going to say that tonight if you're
[1:30:05] sure you ought to be and that what we
[1:30:07] said when you were in a line of duty
[1:30:09] there's nothing that you can't overcome
[1:30:11] according to the prophet of God
[1:30:13] nothing
[1:30:15] because you can't stand in your way this
[1:30:17] is stand in your way look marvelous
[1:30:19] can't stand in your word depression
[1:30:21] can't stand in your way nothing will
[1:30:24] send you away if you are where you are
[1:30:25] if he was gone
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:31] get back in line
[1:30:35] foreign
[1:30:37] amen
[1:30:40] come on
[1:30:42] I wonder if People's lit Sloth from The
[1:30:44] Skin in their way
[1:30:45] lay spiritual drogginess
[1:30:50] I just don't feel like going to church
[1:30:52] tonight
[1:30:53] you're sleepy
[1:30:55] you need some wake up juice
[1:30:58] that's right it ain't no Powerade or
[1:31:00] Gatorade
[1:31:01] it's called gospel Aid
[1:31:03] some aid from the gospel that's right
[1:31:06] you need some neology mixed with gospels
[1:31:10] and you're going to be fired up
[1:31:13] some more gospels amen
[1:31:16] let's go to church let's praise the Lord
[1:31:18] but the ball ain't gonna tell me man
[1:31:22] bye-bye you guys tell me to say

[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:27] hey man why
[1:31:30] but my
[1:31:32] so Samson
[1:31:33] we see how he was and my anything that
[1:31:36] got in his way let me just say this
[1:31:38] Gaza he got trapped in Gaza one time and
[1:31:42] they closed the gates on him
[1:31:44] I think better Maps out there four or
[1:31:46] five tons he said that today four or
[1:31:49] five times he says I'm about to buy it
[1:31:51] before five tons one time it's about a
[1:31:53] car right
[1:31:54] two thousand pounds something like that
[1:31:56] two four six eight eight to ten thousand
[1:31:59] pounds
[1:32:02] that's just what he said I can show you
[1:32:04] the quote
[1:32:06] but he got a trap listen we got him now
[1:32:09] what did they have him
[1:32:12] by no means a dad
[1:32:15] it's Anthony come on up there and he
[1:32:18] grabbed the gates pulled him out of
[1:32:20] their socket
[1:32:22] did he walk 10 feet and drop him
[1:32:26] where'd he go
[1:32:28] up on the hill
[1:32:30] my goodness I don't know about you but I
[1:32:33] didn't drop them as soon as they could
[1:32:34] but the Bible that he cared about you
[1:32:38] but what stupid idiot
[1:32:40] gonna follow a man that Gary's about to
[1:32:42] the next bill
[1:32:45] so I I don't know he could go I'd say
[1:32:48] he's fine just let him go
[1:32:55] oh my that's the kind of strength that
[1:32:57] he had
[1:32:58] how about you don't you realize you got
[1:33:01] some dates against you the Bible says
[1:33:04] the gates of hell are against you
[1:33:06] tonight
[1:33:07] understanding in your land the Bible
[1:33:09] says that I believe her amen when they
[1:33:12] get a revelation from God the Gates of
[1:33:14] Hell will never Prevail against you
[1:33:18] gonna Prevail against you if you're
[1:33:20] walking in a line of duty just chilling
[1:33:23] is loud as he ages stuck in the Prevail
[1:33:25] against you
[1:33:27] we're not all gonna just
[1:33:31] go into the circle of life for The
[1:33:34] Circle of Death huh it's called The
[1:33:38] Circle of Death didn't but a man call it
[1:33:40] the cycle of death and Revival Revival
[1:33:42] and death that has happened to every
[1:33:44] other Church age
[1:33:47] every one of y'all to be sitting there
[1:33:49] just
[1:33:50] well it's another service well I heard
[1:33:53] it before
[1:33:56] this is so boring I didn't really want
[1:33:58] to come to church but I did because
[1:34:00] guess what
[1:34:01] some Deacon might call me if I didn't
[1:34:03] and I missed too many
[1:34:09] I preach
[1:34:12] they ain't here half the time anyway
[1:34:17] come on folks
[1:34:19] yeah yeah you know you'd have he'd be
[1:34:22] calling all the time
[1:34:24] that might sting a little bit but we
[1:34:26] need it you need it
[1:34:30] that's right because you ought to be
[1:34:32] that way you think you're going on the
[1:34:34] Rapture you got me wondering
[1:34:37] which everything else is first before to
[1:34:39] church
[1:34:39] before God before the word everything
[1:34:41] else no we can wait on church we can
[1:34:43] wait
[1:34:44] I gotta do what I gotta do where's your
[1:34:47] priorities
[1:34:50] damn
[1:34:52] yeah I don't know if I should say it but
[1:34:55] I will iron don't you ever listen when I
[1:34:57] talk about putting God first when I'd
[1:35:00] give you the word of God and anything
[1:35:01] you put before God's an idol
[1:35:04] that should be enough to make sure all
[1:35:06] of us hey I don't wanna know why those I
[1:35:08] went for a God first in my life
[1:35:18] we're not a bunch of ducks
[1:35:22] repel water the water just flown right
[1:35:25] off of them we're not dogs the water
[1:35:27] don't fall off of us we absorb it it
[1:35:30] comes on the inside of it and we become
[1:35:32] the word
[1:35:35] amen Lord help us this evening that's
[1:35:39] all right that's more than what I was
[1:35:40] going to say but he sells me to say it
[1:35:42] came to my mind so I take it as the
[1:35:44] inspiration of the Lord is that okay it
[1:35:47] might sting a little
[1:35:53] which one of your gifts your child a
[1:35:55] weapon that we already barely even feel
[1:35:56] it
[1:35:59] huh
[1:36:03] I'm scared to grab my grandchildren a
[1:36:05] weapon
[1:36:11] because if I know if I do Elena I know
[1:36:14] if I do your mom and dad might find a
[1:36:16] mark on their backside
[1:36:18] they might say Grandpa now you can't hit
[1:36:20] that hard they are girls after all
[1:36:27] the lady number one could probably
[1:36:29] count on one finger how many times I've
[1:36:32] hooked them if that many
[1:36:35] amen Donna does a great job praise the
[1:36:37] Lord
[1:36:39] [Laughter]
[1:36:40] [Applause]
[1:36:42] hahaha
[1:36:44] Hallelujah I got it good isn't it
[1:36:47] amen praise the Lord so look at that now
[1:36:50] where we were Samson that's right and
[1:36:53] then afterwards think about the shame
[1:36:55] isn't that right
[1:36:56] when Samson stepped out of line and let
[1:36:58] me tell you something any Christian any
[1:37:00] of you people coming to church here if
[1:37:02] you step by the line you remember you
[1:37:04] will only bring shame
[1:37:07] it only brings shame When anybody
[1:37:11] carnal
[1:37:14] anybody that's carnal and not truly
[1:37:15] filled with the Holy Ghost you'll bring
[1:37:17] shame upon this evening like the
[1:37:18] Tabernacle upon the cause
[1:37:22] amen the only way you'll not bring shame
[1:37:25] is to be filled with the Holy Ghost to
[1:37:26] be led by the spirit and then it'll
[1:37:29] cause you like I said Sunday the love of
[1:37:30] God will cause you to do the thing
[1:37:32] that's perfect
[1:37:33] the love of God will never do their own
[1:37:35] thing
[1:37:36] that's why we need more of the love of
[1:37:38] God because it won't do the wrong things
[1:37:40] it'll always do the right thing amen
[1:37:43] praise the Lord
[1:37:45] Hallelujah
[1:37:47] brother random let's go on the brother
[1:37:48] Brandon for a minute how many knows that
[1:37:50] he was in the line of duty
[1:37:52] Letterman he said he always prayed they
[1:37:54] always try to make sure he prays about
[1:37:57] going to here or going to there because
[1:37:59] he just don't want to go there
[1:38:00] presumptuously
[1:38:02] he didn't want to go there on his own
[1:38:04] and if the Lord tells him to go guess
[1:38:06] what he says then God's going to back me
[1:38:08] up
[1:38:09] because remember he went to Germany I
[1:38:11] believe it was that one time and he's
[1:38:13] witch doctors and witches and said they
[1:38:15] will blow your tent away and sure enough
[1:38:16] they got the chant and this that and the
[1:38:18] other here comes the storm and it was
[1:38:20] getting windy and it was starting to
[1:38:21] blow
[1:38:23] but he was in the line of duty
[1:38:27] went away why because he was in the line
[1:38:30] of duty
[1:38:31] comes about you and I before we do stuff
[1:38:34] make sure it's God's will
[1:38:36] and then whatever you come up to if
[1:38:37] there is an obstacle you can get through
[1:38:39] it
[1:38:40] you'll go through it God will help you
[1:38:42] right over
[1:38:43] comment amen
[1:38:46] my he was always whenever he was going
[1:38:50] across the field him in to pray for pray
[1:38:53] for somebody and that blue showed up
[1:38:55] isn't that right
[1:38:58] and he said first I am a servant of the
[1:39:00] Lord and I'm going to pray for one of
[1:39:02] his people one of his children
[1:39:04] now what he said that's what he said and
[1:39:06] that's what he amen the anointing hit
[1:39:08] him he said that he said now go back and
[1:39:10] lay down
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:14] think about it that big bull he was an
[1:39:16] obstacle I mean he was a mean looking
[1:39:18] obstacle
[1:39:20] I'll tell you right now it was a frosty
[1:39:22] fall Day by the time it was a frosty
[1:39:24] fall day he says he was digging his
[1:39:26] heels
[1:39:29] I believe that and that what do you call
[1:39:32] that Miss coming out of his nose perhaps
[1:39:34] in the wind and him looking at him he
[1:39:36] says I'm coming to get you he had every
[1:39:38] reason to be scared
[1:39:40] but he was in the line of duty and he
[1:39:42] told that bull where to go go back and
[1:39:44] lay down
[1:39:45] aren't you glad that we've had such an
[1:39:47] example that whenever uh Adam before he
[1:39:50] lost his commission before he stepped
[1:39:51] out of line he could say the same thing
[1:39:53] to animals he could tell him what the
[1:39:55] names were he could do whatever
[1:39:57] and you know I have a message like that
[1:40:00] a message hit me in a messenger that God
[1:40:03] used in such a way amen that you can
[1:40:05] believe that that's not just for him but
[1:40:07] that's for you too no matter how big the
[1:40:10] animal no matter how big the Beast that
[1:40:13] you're facing if you're in the line of
[1:40:14] duty you speak to it
[1:40:17] you know how many times I read about
[1:40:19] this in the line of duty where God told
[1:40:20] him he says now Moses now you know even
[1:40:22] God said didn't I commission yet didn't
[1:40:24] I tell you to go then why are you crying
[1:40:26] to me
[1:40:28] many times she says God would always
[1:40:30] tell you if you get to these places
[1:40:31] where these obstacles are and they don't
[1:40:34] whine and cry just speak the word have a
[1:40:36] conference with God speak the word and
[1:40:39] don't retreat don't give up go forward
[1:40:41] he said
[1:40:42] [Applause]
[1:40:43] there is no retreating God
[1:40:46] feed the word and go forward by your
[1:40:49] slots I'm Healed
[1:40:53] oh my
[1:40:59] because God said so
[1:41:03] speak the word
[1:41:04] and go forward
[1:41:05] tell the devil what the word is and go
[1:41:07] forward don't worry about it God will
[1:41:09] take care of it can't get over can't get
[1:41:11] under can't get around us God Will Make
[1:41:14] A Way Through It
[1:41:15] just as sure as the world
[1:41:19] remember remember he was so low in his
[1:41:21] yard not all about you but you've got
[1:41:23] more in a yard may not seem like a big

[1:41:33] of them houses that I go pie down but

[1:41:46] the covered honey is this boy honey I'm
[1:41:48] glad we weren't lazy
[1:41:50] are we living there
[1:41:54] but anyway he was he was there doing a
[1:41:56] thing praying for the sick in the
[1:41:58] meantime remember how he said he'd go
[1:42:00] mow a little bit and somebody could have
[1:42:01] a sick call come in there and and go and
[1:42:04] pray for him go back out there try to

[1:45:05] I am here to do the father's will I'm
[1:45:08] here to do the father's will
[1:45:10] and as long as you're here to do the
[1:45:12] father's will every angel in heaven is
[1:45:15] backing you up
[1:45:17] all those chariots that Elijah saw on
[1:45:20] him they're all behind you
[1:45:23] just stay seated if you possibly can but
[1:45:25] all those chariots are behind you
[1:45:28] euphoria
[1:45:30] amen Dear Dad you make it good what did
[1:45:33] the prophet say one place he says gobble
[1:45:34] bankrupt Heaven before One Promise will
[1:45:37] drop to the ground
[1:45:39] he'll keep every promise that he has
[1:45:41] made
[1:45:44] boy that's
[1:45:47] and he owns a cow to cattle on a
[1:45:50] thousand hills
[1:45:52] I don't know how in the world you're
[1:45:53] going to bankrupt somebody to create
[1:45:55] more
[1:45:59] no it's never gonna get bankrupt
[1:46:03] amen Lord help us our help our faith
[1:46:05] isn't that right
[1:46:08] amen help our faith Jesus come amen he
[1:46:12] had some obstacles let me see what he
[1:46:14] had here he had obstacles the first of
[1:46:17] them was sin
[1:46:18] amen his objective was to come back into
[1:46:21] fellowship with his children isn't that
[1:46:23] right
[1:46:24] but sin was in the way guilt was in the
[1:46:27] way
[1:46:29] everybody was guilty
[1:46:32] oh my I'll tell you what you know what's
[1:46:35] depressing brother Glenn when you're
[1:46:37] guilty
[1:46:39] being guilty is depressing
[1:46:42] now why do you think these kids can run
[1:46:44] around on the wall scream shout and
[1:46:47] holler and clear my they're the happiest
[1:46:49] little guy in the world
[1:46:51] right
[1:46:52] why because you're innocent
[1:46:54] you're not guilty
[1:46:57] innocence it's a great thing
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:00] amen how many believes in every Son of
[1:47:02] God my sins are gone I've been set free
[1:47:06] amen you asked me why I'm sad no you ask
[1:47:10] me more about that because my sins there
[1:47:14] were they weren't obstacle but they're
[1:47:17] not obstacle anymore because they got
[1:47:19] into passive Christ and in between you
[1:47:22] and your fellowship with God is not in
[1:47:25] the past and that death was gotten the
[1:47:27] past Helen the grave was in the past
[1:47:33] himself
[1:47:44] went down there even the hill to devil I
[1:47:47] know you got your own key to your house
[1:47:49] to give him here now
[1:47:51] huh
[1:47:52] give me the keys to your house
[1:47:55] give me the key to Hell give me the keys
[1:47:57] to death
[1:47:59] took the keys and brought them up came
[1:48:02] to his church huh
[1:48:04] Paul looked at the Devil said oh death
[1:48:07] where's your sting
[1:48:09] oh grave where is your Victory but I
[1:48:12] think that God who gives us our secrets
[1:48:14] through Jesus Christ Our Lord and I am
[1:48:16] afraid to
[1:48:18] die okay
[1:48:20] put it
[1:48:22] he got rid of it
[1:48:24] he made sure he got real good and rhythm
[1:48:28] because he knew he had to pay the prize
[1:48:31] you had to die so he says I Gotta Die
[1:48:34] huh
[1:48:36] the devil didn't want him to die so he
[1:48:38] offered him all the kingdoms of the
[1:48:40] world all of y'all he offered all of
[1:48:43] y'all you can have them all
[1:48:46] if you'll just fall down about me
[1:48:51] but he said no I don't want him like
[1:48:53] that
[1:48:53] because if I hit him like that there'd
[1:48:55] be a bunch a muck a bunch of mire
[1:48:57] they're gonna shoot each other hate each
[1:48:59] other kill each other stab each other
[1:49:01] never get along
[1:49:05] huh
[1:49:07] that's right but no I'm gonna get him
[1:49:09] I'm gonna clean him up I'm gonna change
[1:49:11] your nature I'ma change their desires
[1:49:15] oh Hallelujah my life she was we was
[1:49:17] talking on the front porch today and
[1:49:19] then she said she's so glad for the Holy
[1:49:21] Ghost because if it wasn't for the
[1:49:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost those
[1:49:24] sacrifices that the Israelites made
[1:49:26] every year they still kept coming back
[1:49:28] every year with the same desire and I
[1:49:31] said yes that's right if it ain't for
[1:49:32] the Holy Ghost we'd be just like Israel
[1:49:34] was
[1:49:39] your appetite and it's the same thing as
[1:49:42] they had we're no better off
[1:49:46] that's the truth
[1:49:48] God came to changes
[1:49:50] amen
[1:49:52] all right we're trying to get used to
[1:49:54] this little thing Micah said the other
[1:49:56] one I'm always
[1:49:58] doing different things so I'll try to
[1:50:01] keep it on there amen I figured out I
[1:50:04] don't need this I can heal myself think
[1:50:06] perfectly well without the little thing
[1:50:08] in my ear
[1:50:09] but now if I'm back there or something
[1:50:11] like that it helps
[1:50:13] you love the Lord that's right sin was
[1:50:16] in the way death the hell the grave was
[1:50:18] in his way guilt was in the way praise
[1:50:20] the Lord my
[1:50:22] but he conquered it all
[1:50:24] to the Jew could have a relationship
[1:50:28] and fellowship with him amen
[1:50:33] in closing let's talk about the post of
[1:50:35] Duty for just a minute I know that I've
[1:50:37] looked this up and brother Brandon many
[1:50:39] times he would preach at a lot of
[1:50:40] different places he'd have services and
[1:50:42] things like that you know and churches
[1:50:44] would get together and sponsor it and
[1:50:45] cancel their service but if the church
[1:50:47] would have its own church so many times
[1:50:50] he said now we might we're going to have
[1:50:51] a little bible study here tomorrow but
[1:50:53] you be at your post of Duty that's where
[1:50:57] you're supposed to be
[1:50:59] amen
[1:51:01] I thought you know we all have a post
[1:51:03] God how many knows God saved you God
[1:51:05] placed you in Christ God places you in a
[1:51:08] church
[1:51:09] amen and I thought you know it's kind of
[1:51:11] like brother bam said about a football
[1:51:12] team talk about support your pastor
[1:51:15] support your church
[1:51:17] amen
[1:51:18] because that is your place of Duty amen
[1:51:22] I thought well you know when you break
[1:51:25] that when you do something different
[1:51:26] than that you think God's Gonna bless
[1:51:27] that
[1:51:28] I don't think so
[1:51:30] amen
[1:51:31] well we have a post of Duty and I
[1:51:33] thought of it like a quarterback or
[1:51:35] whatever and the preacher's the
[1:51:36] quarterback I thought you know not just
[1:51:38] saying this about me but any church
[1:51:40] should be 100 behind their pastors
[1:51:42] didn't they
[1:51:44] right that's your positive Duty because
[1:51:46] you're what you're backing him up
[1:51:49] you know how hard it is to preach to
[1:51:51] people that don't want to hear you don't
[1:51:52] like you not not for you
[1:51:56] you I can do it
[1:52:00] don't say it's easy but I can do it
[1:52:04] because I know where I stand
[1:52:06] but God's called me to do amen but I'll
[1:52:09] tell you what it makes it so much easier
[1:52:11] and God is so much happier when
[1:52:15] everybody's to get it like a football
[1:52:16] team I mean those on their football team
[1:52:18] they get the biggest meanest ugliest
[1:52:21] dick on fridges and everything else
[1:52:23] number 72s and you know they get the
[1:52:26] biggest guys on them they're called
[1:52:27] lineman
[1:52:30] how many knows that line is so important
[1:52:33] because if you don't have that line of
[1:52:36] defense what's going to happen to the
[1:52:38] quarterback
[1:52:39] he gonna get shot
[1:52:42] that's right
[1:52:45] and I believe that's the way it is in
[1:52:46] church amen when you've got the amen
[1:52:49] card or you got people supporting saying
[1:52:51] they're not trying that quarterback
[1:52:53] ain't never going to get sacked devil
[1:52:55] ain't gonna get his bed I don't care if
[1:52:57] there's somebody sitting in the back
[1:52:58] seat there man crying every chair
[1:53:00] they're picking up every kind of a bad
[1:53:02] attitude bad Spirit how well do you
[1:53:04] think the brother Banner was saying I
[1:53:05] take every Spirit under here eat it
[1:53:07] under my control for the glory of God
[1:53:09] because sometimes Services man you just
[1:53:11] feel the resistance you just feel feel
[1:53:14] that amen
[1:53:18] it all has to be brought under the
[1:53:20] control of the Holy Ghost and when he
[1:53:22] has Liberty
[1:53:24] if the quarterback has plenty of time
[1:53:28] there's a lot
[1:53:31] I'll tell you what it is wide receiver
[1:53:35] runs deep
[1:53:38] because you gotta have plenty of time
[1:53:40] for a deep man to go otherwise you're
[1:53:41] flinging it up in the air you're gonna
[1:53:42] Hail Mary we don't want no Hail Marys we
[1:53:45] want something that's sure right
[1:53:49] well let's have run this course before
[1:53:51] let's have done this practice before let
[1:53:53] it work according to the practice
[1:53:59] amen I forget his name now but the guy
[1:54:02] that just I guess retired and he had
[1:54:04] five footballs whatever you know and he
[1:54:07] just divorced his wife Dwight finally
[1:54:09] divorced him and I heard some stories
[1:54:11] about him I've got it football was
[1:54:13] before his wife or family or anything I
[1:54:15] mean
[1:54:17] he put it all in the football
[1:54:19] amen no wonder he went five times right
[1:54:23] but anyway the wide receiver back to the
[1:54:26] wide receiver he goes out he goes deep
[1:54:27] and guess what those linemen you just
[1:54:29] can't get through them face be to God I
[1:54:32] like when the devil just can't break
[1:54:34] down the Holy Ghost meeting just can't
[1:54:36] get you depressed
[1:54:38] just makes it better and better all the
[1:54:40] time
[1:54:41] he goes back
[1:54:44] picks that ball up and fires it
[1:54:48] boy oh boy brother Joe I don't know but
[1:54:51] it was probably 10 years ago since I saw
[1:54:52] it but the Titans we were all rooting
[1:54:54] for the Titans amen and they did a run
[1:54:55] they did the last run and the only
[1:54:57] Almighty was last last minute last
[1:55:00] second last fight and then he goes and
[1:55:02] he finally talking to him at the one
[1:55:05] yard line if you got any idea how
[1:55:07] discouraging that is when you're wanting
[1:55:10] to make it cost that you're a backyard
[1:55:11] ah no wonder people punch that screen
[1:55:14] and everything else they get all in it
[1:55:20] came in the same way with Moses how many
[1:55:23] knows that when Moses lifted up his hand
[1:55:24] there was Victory it was that Victory
[1:55:27] whenever Moses said they would say hey
[1:55:29] we can't let it go hang on didn't they
[1:55:30] hold his arms up he was like he could be
[1:55:33] lazy hey you got a chair for me here or
[1:55:35] something
[1:55:36] he never sat down he had to stand today
[1:55:38] held his hands up until I even gotta do
[1:55:41] nothing they're holding up
[1:55:44] and let me tell you something there was
[1:55:45] plenty Israelites is that right
[1:55:48] there's plenty Israelites
[1:55:50] for no good fighting with this I'm gonna
[1:55:52] get the fight
[1:55:55] so they could replace them guys many
[1:55:57] times over amen
[1:56:00] but they were support how many beliefs
[1:56:01] of support we support one another
[1:56:04] we're a team people let's stay that way
[1:56:07] and our post the duty of God placed you
[1:56:09] somewhere and He blesses you in there
[1:56:10] don't you let the devil get in between
[1:56:12] that place that you God has placed you
[1:56:14] in there he'll sure try folks he'll
[1:56:17] don't think there won't be obstacles he
[1:56:19] will
[1:56:21] praise the Lord and I I'm telling you
[1:56:23] I'm here to testify on my own my own
[1:56:25] testimony for the last 30 years you know
[1:56:27] I've had a revelation that this is where
[1:56:29] God wants me
[1:56:31] amen
[1:56:32] until you don't want me a guy called me
[1:56:34] somewhere else or do something this is
[1:56:36] where I'm gonna be
[1:56:38] and I don't believe there's enough
[1:56:40] Devils out of hell to ever stop that
[1:56:42] amen
[1:56:46] amen I like what brother Russell told me
[1:56:48] on Monday morning when they were there
[1:56:49] to help them a little bit and he he
[1:56:51] mentioned something and he says and I
[1:56:52] believe he was talking about Stonewall
[1:56:54] Jackson or something somebody said he
[1:56:55] says how can you just stand like that he
[1:56:57] says well my religion he says the reason
[1:57:00] I don't get Disturbed when I'm out there
[1:57:03] he said because I'm a safe here as I
[1:57:06] would be in my bed my T My Religion
[1:57:08] teaches me I'm a safe and not on the
[1:57:10] battlefield as I am in my bed
[1:57:13] because he has my point in my day he has
[1:57:17] appointed my time and so I ain't got to
[1:57:19] worry about it until my time comes ain't
[1:57:21] nothing cool for me
[1:57:24] I thought that was so good you don't
[1:57:26] have to fear
[1:57:27] I mean those you aren't gonna go until
[1:57:29] God brings you home until it's God's
[1:57:31] time
[1:57:32] You Don't Have To Fear
[1:57:34] I thought about one more think about
[1:57:36] Joshua how many knows that one time
[1:57:37] there was an obstacle God in Joshua's
[1:57:39] way and it was time itself
[1:57:45] time got in its way he says I don't have
[1:57:47] enough time
[1:57:49] need more time
[1:57:53] can you imagine somebody calling for
[1:57:55] more time because Cayenne got in the way
[1:57:56] of his victory because he was in the
[1:57:59] line of duty defeating the enemy like he
[1:58:01] was a he says man if that sun goes down
[1:58:03] they're gonna go overnight they're going
[1:58:05] to reinforce search theirself and we're
[1:58:07] gonna lose so many more men
[1:58:10] and I'll tell you what
[1:58:13] I want to ask Joshua one of these days
[1:58:15] what got over to you brother
[1:58:18] what come down why did you say that
[1:58:22] what made you say that
[1:58:25] huh
[1:58:26] no doubt but it'll be probably something
[1:58:28] like this I don't know something just
[1:58:31] came over me
[1:58:32] and I just said thought said still mood
[1:58:36] you stand the valley of agalon or
[1:58:38] whatever it was did you stay there too I
[1:58:41] need more time
[1:58:43] and God heard from heaven
[1:58:45] and stopped the whole thing and said hey

[1:58:50] sure this happens I mean God is there to
