[57:35] thought amen I uh uh felt like the Lord

[57:40] about being tapped into God Amen being
[57:43] tapped in so I titled it tapped in
[57:47] amen amen so if you will we'll just get
[57:50] into the word amen I'm going to see here
[57:54] I don't think I've got any other
[57:56] announcements wrote down here amen thank
[58:00] I want to thank everybody also I know
[58:01] that after or in between Services you
[58:04] know when we uh have a service at 2:30
[58:07] sometimes it's we have to qu try to
[58:09] quickly clean things up and so forth so
[58:11] we do appreciate everybody's help down
[58:13] at the fellowship hall and getting
[58:14] things cleaned up once everybody's done
[58:16] eating amen so praise the Lord turn your
[58:19] bibles if you will to the book of um
[58:24] Matthew amen I might read read several
[58:27] scriptures just to kind of get my
[58:28] Foundation laid down and I do appreciate
[58:31] the song that Brother David sang there
[58:34] amen I'm pressing on the upward Way New
[58:37] Height I'm gaining every day still
[58:39] praying as I'm onward B bound Lord plant
[58:42] my feet on higher ground amen how many
[58:45] believ that as we get on down the road
[58:48] and as the world gets wickeder amen the
[58:51] Church of Jesus Christ is getting closer
[58:53] to him if we're not moving to WS him on
[58:56] a daily basis then there's something
[58:58] wrong with us amen we should be
[59:01] constantly getting closer and closer to
[59:04] God and I'll show you how that kind of
[59:06] happens amen um with the help of the
[59:10] lord we know one of them is through to
[59:12] five-fold Ministry amen that he gave to
[59:14] some Apostles prophets and so forth amen
[59:17] but we'll read that scripture let's go
[59:18] to Matthew amen and verse let's go with
[59:24] Matthew let me see what what I got
[59:30] here five Matthew
[59:41] 5 of course Jesus talking about loving
[59:44] your enemy blessing them that curse you
[59:47] and so forth doing good to them that
[59:48] hate you praying for them that
[59:50] despitefully use you in verse 44 and
[59:54] persecute you verse 45
[59:56] that ye may be the children of your
[59:58] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:00:00] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:00:03] good and sendeth Reign on the just and
[1:00:05] unjust for if you love them which love
[1:00:08] you what reward have ye do not even the
[1:00:10] publicans the same and if you salute
[1:00:12] your brethren only what do ye more than
[1:00:15] others do not the publicans also he's do
[1:00:19] not also the do not even the publicans
[1:00:22] so be ye therefore perfect even as your
[1:00:26] father which is in heaven is perfect
[1:00:29] amen you know that's a scary word isn't
[1:00:32] it I think that's a scary word for us
[1:00:35] human beings that are so imperfect amen
[1:00:38] that God tells us that he asks us to be
[1:00:42] perfect amen amen so it's quite
[1:00:45] something but let's look at that for
[1:00:47] just a little bit longer a little bit
[1:00:49] more over in Ephesians I believe is the
[1:00:53] next one Ephesians 4
[1:00:58] I'm going read about four scriptures and
[1:01:00] then I'll just have a couple of them
[1:01:01] left over Ephesians
[1:01:06] 4 verse 10 he that descended is the same
[1:01:10] also that ascended far above all the
[1:01:14] heavens that he might fill all things
[1:01:16] and he gave some Apostles and some
[1:01:19] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:01:22] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[1:01:26] of the Saints for the work of the
[1:01:28] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:01:31] Christ and that's as far as we'll go
[1:01:33] there let's go over
[1:01:35] to um Ephesians the next page probably
[1:01:38] on your Bible Ephesians
[1:01:41] 5 Ephesians
[1:01:45] 5 husbands love your wives even as
[1:01:48] Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:01:50] himself for it that he might sanctify
[1:01:52] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[1:01:54] Water by the word that he might present
[1:01:56] it to himself a glorious church not
[1:02:00] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[1:02:05] but that it should be holy and without
[1:02:08] blemish amen sounds like perfect to me
[1:02:11] don't it
[1:02:13] you second
[1:02:17] Peter one more scripture second Peter 3
[1:02:30] verse 11 seeing then that all the things
[1:02:33] shall be dissolved what manner of
[1:02:35] persons ought ye to be in all holy
[1:02:37] conversation and godliness looking for
[1:02:40] the Hasting unto the coming of the day
[1:02:42] of God wherein the heavens being on fire
[1:02:44] shall be dissolved and the elements
[1:02:46] shall melt with fervent heat
[1:02:48] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:02:51] look for a new heavens and a new Earth
[1:02:53] wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore
[1:02:56] beloved seeing that ye look for such
[1:02:58] things be
[1:02:59] diligent be diligent that's what we're
[1:03:01] doing this morning trying to be diligent
[1:03:04] that ye may be found of him in peace
[1:03:08] without spot and
[1:03:11] blameless wow be God add His blessings
[1:03:13] to the reading of the word you can be
[1:03:16] seated amen y'all are very attentive
[1:03:20] most of you didn't even sit until I said
[1:03:22] be seated so amen praise the Lord God is
[1:03:25] good
[1:03:26] amen so I thought about what brother
[1:03:29] brandham had said said about how that we
[1:03:32] uh have how many many believes we have
[1:03:33] untapped
[1:03:35] resources the sources that we've never
[1:03:38] even been tapped
[1:03:40] into that's the way man is today now
[1:03:43] notice and he was talking about a crow
[1:03:45] that had been tied up and a man came by
[1:03:48] and let him go turned him loose amen all
[1:03:51] of his fellow crows came by and said
[1:03:53] come on Johnny Crow you're loose come on
[1:03:55] with us and so forth and he says I can't
[1:03:57] I can't he got to the place where he
[1:04:00] just thought he was tied up and couldn't
[1:04:01] go even though he was free ain't that
[1:04:04] right and that's the way man is today
[1:04:07] you don't know that Jesus Christ made
[1:04:10] you free brother let's get out of it
[1:04:13] let's get somewhere God made us free
[1:04:16] don't starve to death God's got
[1:04:18] Pentecostal blessings all through the
[1:04:21] skies and unta resources of his goodness
[1:04:25] let's go get it whosoever will let him
[1:04:27] come in another couple quotes in that
[1:04:29] same kind of a phrase he says that you
[1:04:32] know that we're living a million miles
[1:04:34] below our
[1:04:36] privileges amen it's amazing how that
[1:04:38] brother banon would you know I mean you
[1:04:40] know we as preachers sometimes have a
[1:04:42] tendency to go a little extreme and he
[1:04:45] makes the statement a million miles
[1:04:47] that's a pretty long ways if you ask me
[1:04:49] that the church at that
[1:04:52] time oh my can I just say what comes to
[1:04:55] mind
[1:04:56] you know it's something that I don't
[1:04:58] remember brother brandham saying too
[1:04:59] much about not a church is up to what
[1:05:01] where it ought to
[1:05:03] be I don't he hear that a whole lot Amen
[1:05:07] brother bam talked about the
[1:05:08] Pentecostals getting off and if they
[1:05:10] keep getting off the way that they are
[1:05:11] they'll be further than the Catholics in
[1:05:13] 20 years ain't that right but how many
[1:05:16] believes that the bride the people that
[1:05:18] are going to meet the Lord in the air
[1:05:21] amen they're not going to be living
[1:05:22] below their
[1:05:24] privileges no they're not not they're
[1:05:26] going to come up to what God has for
[1:05:28] them because it's in them to do it
[1:05:30] because God has put that in them to do
[1:05:34] it amen praise the Lord listen to this
[1:05:38] and it's a simple way God doesn't make
[1:05:40] things complicated to uh with so many
[1:05:42] rosaries and many this and join this and
[1:05:45] education and theology he says why we
[1:05:47] get ourselves further away from God all
[1:05:49] the time by doing so today we're so
[1:05:52] scientific till he says that we can uh
[1:05:56] uh tell how many molecules that it takes
[1:05:59] to make an atom and how many electrons
[1:06:02] and so forth and split that
[1:06:04] atom amen how many knows remember when
[1:06:07] they created the atom bomb remember the
[1:06:09] city they built and all that went into
[1:06:12] trying to make that atomic bomb ain't
[1:06:14] that right how to split an atom man can
[1:06:17] go all the way to splitting an atom man
[1:06:20] has advanced greatly amen and I don't
[1:06:23] from what I understand they can even
[1:06:24] clone things
[1:06:26] now amen I didn't do much study into it
[1:06:29] but uh you know just that they can take
[1:06:32] a life I guess and make another life
[1:06:34] from it that's pretty amazing that's
[1:06:36] next to creating life how many knows I'm
[1:06:40] sure that they had to take some form of
[1:06:42] life that was there already is that
[1:06:44] right amen and then perhaps just clone
[1:06:47] that life cuz they can't make life they
[1:06:51] can't create life only God can create
[1:06:55] life
[1:06:56] he is he is life
[1:07:03] amen so listen to what he says and you
[1:07:06] can tell and tell you how it's done and
[1:07:08] man- make an atomic bomb but then we can
[1:07:12] uh he says we can explain how it's done
[1:07:14] but we walk over a blade of grass and we
[1:07:17] cannot explain it how many remember
[1:07:21] brother B talking many times how that we
[1:07:23] can shoot people to the Moon we can you
[1:07:25] know have these talk about the stars and
[1:07:28] all those things but we how did he put
[1:07:31] it walk over a blade of grass we walk
[1:07:34] right over a blade of grass and we don't
[1:07:37] really realize what we're walking
[1:07:41] over we can't explain the grass that we
[1:07:45] walk
[1:07:46] over amen because brother brandom I
[1:07:49] think you all know that the definition
[1:07:51] of what he tried to get to us was that
[1:07:54] it takes God
[1:07:56] in that blade of grass to
[1:08:02] grow amen it might not be sound too
[1:08:05] exciting but that's exciting to me
[1:08:07] because if you remember brother
[1:08:09] Brandon apple tree one time to convert a
[1:08:13] Infidel when that Infidel neighbor amen
[1:08:16] had been raised from cancer and healed
[1:08:19] from cancer isn't that right and he'd
[1:08:21] like to meet that one preacher that
[1:08:23] perhaps wasn't a lion dog
[1:08:26] he wanted to meet that unlying dog so to
[1:08:30] speak you know because he was interested
[1:08:32] in it and of course brother Brandon
[1:08:33] pushed him a little ah you don't mean
[1:08:35] that she actually was healed yeah she
[1:08:37] was if you don't believe it go over
[1:08:39] there with me and I'll show you he said
[1:08:42] I had him preaching to me now Glory
[1:08:45] ain't that right why because of that you
[1:08:47] know and so forth and he says I sure
[1:08:49] like to meet him he says well I'll tell
[1:08:50] you you know and he got to ask him what
[1:08:53] intelligence tells that s app in your
[1:08:56] tree that you planted so many years ago
[1:08:58] what
[1:08:59] intelligence what power tells that sap
[1:09:03] to go down into the tree he well well
[1:09:06] that's just nature and this that or the
[1:09:08] other he saids no it's not why don't I
[1:09:10] put a bucket of water up on the post
[1:09:12] amen see if it goes
[1:09:14] down to you and to me that sounds
[1:09:17] completely ridiculous isn't that right
[1:09:18] but that's about what churches and
[1:09:20] people do nowadays they put water on the
[1:09:22] post thinking hey somehow it's going to
[1:09:24] work you don't it don't work unless you
[1:09:26] come God's
[1:09:28] way we got to remember that about our
[1:09:31] life is that nothing in our life is
[1:09:33] going to work unless you come God's way
[1:09:36] amen and that intelligence that same
[1:09:38] blade of grass how many knows amen it's
[1:09:41] God growing and pushing that out and so
[1:09:44] forth how many could say this morning I
[1:09:46] want to tell you I know that life you
[1:09:48] know that life you've been tapped into
[1:09:52] that life and that life is God
[1:09:57] Almighty wo we F so many discontented
[1:10:00] people nowadays but I want you to
[1:10:02] understand that a Christian amen he's
[1:10:04] not tossed here and there amen he hasn't
[1:10:06] tossed with every wind that comes along
[1:10:08] every problem and everything that comes
[1:10:10] why because we should have a daily walk
[1:10:13] with almighty God we've been tapped into
[1:10:16] that tap of unre oh untapped resource
[1:10:19] but you are tapped de woo are you ready
[1:10:23] this morning how many beli this morning
[1:10:25] you have been tapped
[1:10:30] in amen it is not untapped anymore
[1:10:35] somebody has untapped into it where all
[1:10:39] things are possible to them that
[1:10:44] believe amen praise the Lord didn't mean
[1:10:48] to get to preaching I want to do a
[1:10:49] little teaching here
[1:10:53] first amen
[1:10:56] all right but I thought my you walk over
[1:10:59] a blade of
[1:11:01] grass oh my might as well go on Amen I'm
[1:11:06] here to tell you that's the same power
[1:11:08] that tells all those trees out there to
[1:11:11] go down and the fall how many believe
[1:11:13] it's the same power that tells them to
[1:11:15] come up again it's the same power that's
[1:11:18] going to say all rise it's the same
[1:11:21] power that's going to resurrect the Dead
[1:11:25] it's the same power I'm glad I know what
[1:11:28] makes a blade of grass grow aren't
[1:11:31] you oh I'm so glad I
[1:11:38] do can I say something else brother
[1:11:41] Urban can I say something
[1:11:42] else there's a big difference between
[1:11:47] mentally knowing yeah it's God that
[1:11:49] grows the
[1:11:52] grass that's just your mind knowing a
[1:11:55] fact fact but when you know the one that
[1:11:58] grows
[1:11:59] it that's a different
[1:12:01] story that means that if you know him
[1:12:04] he's got to be in
[1:12:06] here you know him personally because he
[1:12:08] dwells in your
[1:12:14] heart praise the
[1:12:16] Lord amen it's the same power amen that
[1:12:21] grows that thing it draws moisture and
[1:12:23] so forth and grows that thing I'm here
[1:12:26] to tell you that no man can come unto be
[1:12:29] me except my father draw
[1:12:32] him how many believe that that's the
[1:12:34] drawing power of the Holy Ghost in your
[1:12:37] life it's the very same drawing power
[1:12:40] that pulls you to a higher ground that
[1:12:43] is pulling you up higher that is making
[1:12:46] you not content with where you're at but
[1:12:48] you're W to go
[1:12:50] further it's a power it's an inside
[1:12:53] power if you ain't got that you're a
[1:12:55] nominal
[1:12:57] Christian you're no more than the devil
[1:13:00] or his angels say our Believers Cain was
[1:13:03] absolutely a Believer and even a
[1:13:06] worshiper but he didn't have the
[1:13:08] Revelation we're no better than him if
[1:13:11] it's only a mental
[1:13:13] conception has to be
[1:13:15] more than just a mental understanding
[1:13:18] but you got to know that
[1:13:20] power amen the prophet of God knew that
[1:13:23] power amen
[1:13:25] you tell me what tells that sap to go
[1:13:28] down and I'll tell you it's the same
[1:13:30] intelligence that told me that woman
[1:13:33] would be well isin't that
[1:13:35] right amen it's the same intelligence
[1:13:39] that said I'm going to have a bride
[1:13:41] without spot and without wrinkle as I've
[1:13:45] said many times don't expect to go into
[1:13:48] Rapture filthy
[1:13:51] dirty don't expect to G to God to take
[1:13:54] the rapture dressed like a
[1:13:56] harlot thinking like a harlot hello or
[1:14:00] having sin in your life how many
[1:14:03] believes it's got to be dealt
[1:14:04] with amen because if he lead lets one in
[1:14:07] he'll have to let them all in amen if
[1:14:10] one church can go in because they want
[1:14:12] to go their way he'll have to let all of
[1:14:14] them in only fair but God don't do it
[1:14:17] that
[1:14:19] wayen praise the Lord all right let's
[1:14:22] get off the blade of grass for a minute
[1:14:24] but I thought that was just good amen
[1:14:27] it's the same
[1:14:28] one leading you leading me on a daily
[1:14:34] basis amen and when you are tapped in
[1:14:38] you're tapped in to the
[1:14:43] source the source of all
[1:14:46] things of all creation and yet that is
[1:14:50] on the inside of you I don't know it
[1:14:54] might get old to you
[1:14:55] but it don't get old to me to think that
[1:14:58] God himself has made his Abode in your
[1:15:03] heart and he is looking and pressing and
[1:15:08] wanting to get into you more than what
[1:15:11] you and I are letting
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:16] him how many believe that I don't know
[1:15:20] about you but I believe
[1:15:22] that I believe that God God wants to
[1:15:25] come into you and into me like the
[1:15:28] Kentucky dam and the Kentucky Lake ain't
[1:15:31] that
[1:15:32] right and those big old valves that they
[1:15:35] open up a't that right once in a while
[1:15:37] they have to open up those valves at the
[1:15:39] bottom let all the go and the settlement
[1:15:41] and the muck and the M the everything
[1:15:44] that settled down into them Gates but
[1:15:45] you open them Gates and guess what it's
[1:15:47] going to have such a tremendous pressure
[1:15:50] that it's going to shoot that water
[1:15:51] straight off amen but there has to be an
[1:15:54] Avenue there has to be an opening for
[1:15:56] that water to go to pushing out and
[1:15:58] that's the way it is with god with him
[1:16:00] with you and I I don't care where you
[1:16:02] are I don't care how holy you are God
[1:16:04] still wants to press more of himself
[1:16:06] through you and it's not God's
[1:16:10] fault no it's our fault our own ways
[1:16:14] sometimes that get in the way and it
[1:16:15] takes God some sometimes brother Tommy
[1:16:17] to put us in the hospital to put us here
[1:16:19] to get our attention to get us to open
[1:16:22] up but Lord don't throw me in the
[1:16:25] hospital don't make me suffer this that
[1:16:27] or the other amen Sunday morning coming
[1:16:29] to church is good enough for me to open
[1:16:31] up say God pour yourself out through
[1:16:37] me stagnant backslid cold on God hello
[1:16:43] it's not go how God wants you it's not
[1:16:46] how he wants us he wants you on fire
[1:16:50] walking like brother Phil said having
[1:16:52] fellowship with him and he God wants you
[1:16:56] to
[1:16:57] abide in
[1:17:00] him because I'm here toble if you are in
[1:17:03] Christ the devil will do everything he
[1:17:05] possibly can remember the devil hates
[1:17:08] this Revelation he does everything he
[1:17:10] fights Revelation he does everything to
[1:17:13] try to get into the church making it
[1:17:14] lukewarm formal and defiling it defiling
[1:17:19] it making it lukewarm formal and
[1:17:22] Powerless amen the devil wants to defile
[1:17:27] you he doesn't want you
[1:17:29] pure and there ain't nothing like
[1:17:33] pure there ain't nothing like holy there
[1:17:36] ain't nothing like undefiled and I'll
[1:17:38] get it to you after a while
[1:17:41] amen all right let's
[1:17:46] go praise the Lord Brother Brad I'm
[1:17:48] figured a little bit more out
[1:17:52] amen because under well I could you go
[1:17:56] under the table is that right if you
[1:17:59] have a certain quote or certain
[1:18:00] something I used to just print it out
[1:18:02] there and there'd be a million of them
[1:18:04] but if you'll hit current message so on
[1:18:07] the computer I'll find out where it is
[1:18:09] go to the current message and then it'll
[1:18:11] pick it up right there and used to I'd
[1:18:13] almost have to stay with that whole
[1:18:15] message because I couldn't find all the
[1:18:16] rest but now I found the way to do the
[1:18:18] rest so praise the Lord we're
[1:18:20] progressing a
[1:18:21] little is that all
[1:18:23] right praise be to God you love
[1:18:26] him all
[1:18:29] right now let's look at
[1:18:31] this now listen so we can say to the
[1:18:34] Pentecostal Brethren well he says what
[1:18:37] we got back y when our forefathers got
[1:18:39] it 50 years
[1:18:41] ago maybe ISU
[1:18:44] Street and I hope that the Lord will
[1:18:47] forgive me and that I'm correct but we
[1:18:50] even talk about going back to
[1:18:52] acts is that right Acts to Pentecost the
[1:18:55] original Pentecost is that
[1:19:00] right I don't say that we don't need to
[1:19:02] go back there we
[1:19:04] do but we don't need to do what they
[1:19:08] did why because how many knows brother
[1:19:10] Braham says in church ages that church
[1:19:12] fell before he could get her before he
[1:19:15] could Rapture her she had fallen even 30
[1:19:18] years Paul says you I'm sure I'm you
[1:19:20] know you you know I'm surprised that you
[1:19:22] are so moved so quickly moved they
[1:19:25] didn't stay pure Pentecost very long and
[1:19:28] before you know it they had fallen so in
[1:19:30] the aspect of that we don't want to do
[1:19:33] that we want to go further than that
[1:19:35] isn't that right we want to go further
[1:19:37] than they did we want to go all the way
[1:19:40] to the rapture we want to go to the
[1:19:43] coming of the
[1:19:44] Lord that's our
[1:19:47] goal my point this morning is remember
[1:19:50] don't look back if you want more of God
[1:19:52] and you want to tap into this you can't
[1:19:54] do it by looking back no you got to look
[1:19:57] forward don't never brother bam says
[1:19:59] Look Backwards look forward keep looking
[1:20:02] forward science don't do that and then
[1:20:06] another place brother bam says s does
[1:20:08] look back amen man looks back always
[1:20:11] looking back and in some aspects they do
[1:20:15] because they're always going back and
[1:20:16] digging up dinosaurs and looking at
[1:20:19] history and looking up in history and
[1:20:21] you
[1:20:22] know is that right
[1:20:25] preachers do it keep looking forward
[1:20:28] science is going to find God before the
[1:20:31] preacher
[1:20:32] does if we don't watch it in his
[1:20:36] researches amen listen to this now let's
[1:20:40] take for instance the achievement that
[1:20:42] man has been able to do on Earth and all
[1:20:45] of these natural achievements I want you
[1:20:47] undivided attention now all the natural
[1:20:50] achievements has happened in the Earth
[1:20:52] has been forerunners of spiritual ual
[1:20:55] achievements that God has done by his
[1:21:02] church somebody tell me what that means
[1:21:04] then where are we where we are where are
[1:21:07] we
[1:21:11] then well I'll answer that for
[1:21:14] you we're in the astronaut
[1:21:18] age how many beli we're in the astronaut
[1:21:21] age not in the horse and buggy age
[1:21:23] anymore
[1:21:25] not in the car age anymore not in the
[1:21:27] airplane not in the jet not in the
[1:21:31] supersonic but we are in the astronaut
[1:21:34] the space shuttle in outer space what
[1:21:37] does that mean bottom line to all of
[1:21:40] that is now we fly where all things are
[1:21:45] possible the days of Miracles ain't
[1:21:48] passed the days of the Holy Ghost ain't
[1:21:50] pass the days of traveling faster living
[1:21:52] higher being closer to God they're not
[1:21:55] over with all things are
[1:21:57] possible with you nothing shall be
[1:22:00] impossible whoa astronaut
[1:22:06] age but as your preacher and Pastor I
[1:22:09] ask you but are
[1:22:11] we just where are we
[1:22:13] living where are we really
[1:22:20] living amen that's where the church is
[1:22:24] but I want every one of you to be in
[1:22:26] that astronaut
[1:22:28] age oh
[1:22:30] my lot comes to my mind that right not
[1:22:35] affected by the outside anymore not in
[1:22:37] the outer courts not in the inner
[1:22:41] courts amen where the lights go out and
[1:22:43] you got to relight the candle relight
[1:22:46] the candle trim the
[1:22:48] lamp I hope you trim your lamp every
[1:22:51] morning every afternoon every evening as
[1:22:54] a matter of fact you know uh you know I
[1:22:57] believe that the way to tap into the
[1:22:59] source of God once you get plugged into
[1:23:02] tapped into a power source isn't that
[1:23:04] right I wanted to bring a lamp up here
[1:23:06] and plug it in when you plug it in the
[1:23:08] light comes on why because there's power
[1:23:11] there and it lights it up unplug it and
[1:23:13] guess what the light goes out amen we're
[1:23:15] supposed to plug it in and keep it
[1:23:18] plugged
[1:23:20] in if you abide in me and my word abide
[1:23:23] in you you could ask what you will and
[1:23:26] you shall have
[1:23:28] it all right well I'm getting ahead of
[1:23:30] myself I want to talk to you about an
[1:23:32] engine here for a little bit now
[1:23:34] notice the spirits on he talks about
[1:23:37] engines he talks about power let's take
[1:23:39] for an instant he says all the natural
[1:23:42] things are a type of spiritual things
[1:23:44] now you say how is that let's take for
[1:23:47] example Transportation first
[1:23:48] Transportation was by horse automobile
[1:23:51] signs built an airplane but you see
[1:23:53] first was one horse p power the car was
[1:23:55] maybe 20 horsepower the car was maybe 20
[1:23:58] horsepower the airplane goes up to
[1:23:59] hundreds of horsepower see and what is
[1:24:01] it it's just as we come on with the
[1:24:05] horse and then the auto is made and the
[1:24:07] next thing the airplane we just keep
[1:24:09] achieving higher and higher greater and
[1:24:13] greater this is the achievement of
[1:24:16] Science and this is a forerunner of the
[1:24:17] spirit things that's happened oh God by
[1:24:20] his Spirit has promised in his word
[1:24:23] butam says what's the matter with us
[1:24:24] Christians the Christians we've laid
[1:24:27] down on our job that's right science has
[1:24:30] taken men further with his five sensus
[1:24:32] than ministers has taken him with his
[1:24:36] soul
[1:24:38] amen y'all remember Einstein and how
[1:24:41] smart he was in figuring out creation
[1:24:43] and all the things that they're trying
[1:24:45] to figure out how was it all made how
[1:24:47] was it all made the Einstein probably
[1:24:49] one of the closest come that came to it
[1:24:50] he he says man he says you know he the
[1:24:53] conclusion of the matter is that God
[1:24:55] created the heavens and the Earth you
[1:24:58] know it basically go down to atoms
[1:25:00] molecules all the way down and you have
[1:25:01] leave to think if I'm not wrong the last
[1:25:04] thing that it went back to amen was
[1:25:06] gases and so forth and then they said
[1:25:08] something about light go back to light
[1:25:10] and God is light a't that right so
[1:25:13] almost they almost come right up to
[1:25:15] realizing what it was made by we don't
[1:25:17] go just all most there brother Tommy
[1:25:19] amen we' realized that it was God that
[1:25:22] made it amen God made made everything
[1:25:25] and not only do we try to find him that
[1:25:27] way but you find him through a humble
[1:25:29] and and a repentant
[1:25:31] heart amen not only do we know who made
[1:25:35] it but we found a way to tap into that
[1:25:39] Source amen aren't you glad for
[1:25:42] that amen now
[1:25:45] notice let me see here I'd just like to
[1:25:49] ask you a question many of you brethren
[1:25:50] in here can go back with me to the old
[1:25:53] model te
[1:25:56] amen model th we'll call that
[1:25:59] Luther I said that we'll call it the
[1:26:02] Luther age now
[1:26:05] notice science is only as good as it can
[1:26:09] measure as close as science can measure
[1:26:11] that's how powerful they become as close
[1:26:15] as the church can measure that's just as
[1:26:17] powerful as the church becomes here it
[1:26:20] becomes about
[1:26:22] measurements amen
[1:26:26] measurements mathematics is that
[1:26:33] right
[1:26:38] amen as close as science can measure
[1:26:40] that's how powerful they've come
[1:26:42] now science about 35 years ago could
[1:26:45] only measure to 10,000 of an inch in
[1:26:50] that they could make the model T4 with a
[1:26:52] 10,000s of an inch pistol ring which
[1:26:55] could give it the terrific speed of
[1:26:57] about 25
[1:26:59] mph up to it set a spark plug over it a
[1:27:03] valve to pump the gas up the gas fired
[1:27:05] by the spark plug but it lost so much of
[1:27:08] its compression as it went out with a
[1:27:11] 10,000 of an inch amen now listen that
[1:27:15] was the old model for but did they stop
[1:27:18] at that no sir they can go down now to
[1:27:21] 100,000 of an inch now they cutting in
[1:27:24] their rule measuring closer now they can
[1:27:28] take that same Ford or that same piston
[1:27:30] in a jet engine and almost drive it 600
[1:27:32] miles per hour with the same spark plug
[1:27:35] fig firing over the top of it what is it
[1:27:37] they can Maj your clothes sir that
[1:27:41] nothing leaks
[1:27:44] out wo kind of reminds me of the story
[1:27:47] of Amen being sealed by the baptism of
[1:27:50] the Holy Ghost is't that right they used
[1:27:52] to have box cars no out they got there
[1:27:55] and it was everywhere in that box car by
[1:27:56] the time they got there they found out
[1:27:58] we need some inspectors we need somebody
[1:28:01] to pack it in tight how many knows if
[1:28:04] you're going to be a better Christian
[1:28:06] and you're going to have more power
[1:28:07] you're going to have to pack it in a
[1:28:09] little
[1:28:13] tighter
[1:28:15] amen
[1:28:17] my nothing leaks out the pressure's
[1:28:21] there but your measurement wasn't close
[1:28:23] enough I mean know God is there he's
[1:28:26] wanting to get into you but you're going
[1:28:29] to have to measure a little bit
[1:28:31] different they can take the hundred
[1:28:34] thousands of an inch and split an atom
[1:28:36] with it are they stopping no they're
[1:28:38] going on but us oh well we're satisfied
[1:28:42] with what Moody said finny
[1:28:45] said or you hold yourself well that's
[1:28:48] just the way I
[1:28:49] am huh well you sure won't move forward
[1:28:53] if that's out of
[1:28:55] here no that's right but finny said them
[1:28:59] men were all right they were Christians
[1:29:00] brothers that's in glory he says the
[1:29:03] first time that rule was ever laid
[1:29:05] across the word of God how do you
[1:29:07] measure it tonight what value has the
[1:29:10] word of God got to you now look
[1:29:12] Christian Martin Luther came out and
[1:29:13] laid it across Catholicism and found out
[1:29:16] that the just shall live by faith I me
[1:29:20] know that was the rule that was that was
[1:29:22] they begin to have a reference
[1:29:24] enough power there to pull the church
[1:29:26] out of Catholicism but even he didn't
[1:29:29] really realize what it
[1:29:31] meant how many glad to understand what
[1:29:34] it means we'll get to it after a bit he
[1:29:36] left listen just shall live by faith but
[1:29:39] he left a great Gap there many things
[1:29:42] passed
[1:29:44] through oh my can I preach how many
[1:29:47] knows there's still just too many things
[1:29:50] that are allowed to pass through our
[1:29:52] mind
[1:29:55] I believe Paul said that we were to
[1:29:57] bring into captivity every thought to
[1:30:00] The Obedience of
[1:30:02] God remember we're talking about
[1:30:04] perfection now amen
[1:30:07] spotlessness
[1:30:09] virtuousness ready to meet Christ I
[1:30:13] truly believe a message this morning is
[1:30:15] a message to get the bride
[1:30:18] ready because that's what we're
[1:30:20] interested in or I can come up here and
[1:30:23] tell you how to how to how to get rich
[1:30:26] buy a bunch of little properties get
[1:30:28] some rental property get some real
[1:30:30] estate this this that or the other or
[1:30:32] whatever whatever business you're in
[1:30:34] just do it much better than what more
[1:30:35] efficient no we're not here to do that
[1:30:37] we're here for your soul all those other
[1:30:40] things will pass away but your soul is
[1:30:42] what the real value is here amen we're
[1:30:45] trying to put you up to God's measuring
[1:30:46] stick so to speak amen now
[1:30:50] notice Catholicism great Gap there but
[1:30:53] he believed that the just shall live by
[1:30:55] faith and he stepped out on it because
[1:30:57] God's word said so he measured God's
[1:31:00] word out to the people that just shall
[1:31:03] live by faith amen Along Came another
[1:31:06] little fellow in England by the name of
[1:31:07] John Wesley he measured it to the people
[1:31:10] a little closer he cut that ruler just a
[1:31:12] little closer could meure closer
[1:31:15] sanctification as they called it in them
[1:31:17] days the work second work of Grace look
[1:31:20] at what he done he introduced Holiness
[1:31:23] to the church
[1:31:25] how many believe amen you can overcome
[1:31:27] that amen you don't have to drink that
[1:31:28] beer you ain't got to smoke that
[1:31:30] cigarette you ain't got to do this that
[1:31:31] or the other but you can live a
[1:31:32] Sanctified life to almighty
[1:31:36] God Amen make it a little
[1:31:39] closer
[1:31:42] my that was the second work of Grace
[1:31:45] look what he do he introduced Holiness
[1:31:47] to the church Along come Pentecost and
[1:31:49] measured down the gift of the Holy
[1:31:51] Spirit speaking with tongues and
[1:31:54] signs but we're just letting the big gap
[1:31:58] through he said they still had a gap
[1:32:01] what was that Gap was their own ways
[1:32:03] their own ideas that speaking in tongues
[1:32:06] is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:08] anybody that doesn't got the holy ghost
[1:32:10] that was incorrect there was still a
[1:32:12] leak in it there was still a fault in
[1:32:16] it wo how many knows that if you're not
[1:32:19] filled with the power of God this
[1:32:20] morning there must still be a little
[1:32:22] leak somewhere in your life
[1:32:30] huh I'm not here to patch you on the
[1:32:31] back oh you're such a wonderful man
[1:32:33] wonderful Christian you don't need any
[1:32:35] more no we need them more I need more
[1:32:38] there's still too much of a gap in my
[1:32:40] life
[1:32:42] hello got to measure a little bit
[1:32:45] closer amen I believe over in
[1:32:48] Russellville there's a if I'm not wrong
[1:32:50] am me there are people that work on the
[1:32:52] cars over there called PR Precision
[1:32:54] maintenance Precision maintenance

[1:43:34] the word that is more precise how many
[1:43:37] believe that God sent us something more
[1:43:39] precise it wasn't just reformers anymore
[1:43:42] but now we have thus sayeth the
[1:43:46] Lord it don't get any more original than
[1:43:50] that it don't get any more precise than
[1:43:52] that
[1:43:57] amen and y'all remember when brother
[1:43:59] brandham had to make a choice of whether
[1:44:01] he was go the harder way isn't that
[1:44:03] right whether he would go the hard way
[1:44:05] amen and he was preaching a message and
[1:44:07] and Danny I believe his name Danny Henry
[1:44:09] or something amen he come up and he was

[1:44:18] in
[1:44:19] tongues and another one person I mean
[1:44:21] heard it heard it a in unknown language
[1:44:24] and it was interpreted and when they
[1:44:26] interpreted it it said it this way now
[1:44:27] here now this man now watch what he's
[1:44:30] wrote you can see it in foreign words

[1:44:57] to do that how am I going to react to
[1:44:58] this how am I going to react to that you
[1:45:00] have to make choices in the whole world
[1:45:02] and your world depends on how you make
[1:45:04] that choice how many knows you it's
[1:45:06] either the right choice or it's the
[1:45:07] wrong
[1:45:08] choice we want the
[1:45:11] precise we want that precise
[1:45:14] Choice precise decision it's my way
[1:45:17] bless God oh it's my way he said because
[1:45:19] of this momentous decision a huge
[1:45:23] portion of Heaven awaits you he had
[1:45:26] never heard about the vision you see to
[1:45:28] this you remember the vision and I tried
[1:45:31] to find out exactly what that vision is
[1:45:33] the only thing I can come up with this
[1:45:35] is me is that vision of who he's seen
[1:45:38] those millions that were over
[1:45:41] there remember that there was Millions a
[1:45:45] huge portion of Heaven because he made
[1:45:48] the right
[1:45:50] choice and that is he chose God's way
[1:45:53] and because he made the right choice
[1:45:54] brother bread we're going to be there

[1:46:10] Glory because he made the right choice
[1:46:13] because he made a precise
[1:46:15] decision you and I can get there we have
[1:46:17] something that could bring us to where
[1:46:19] we can be there further than Luther
[1:46:22] further further than Wesley further than
[1:46:26] Pentecostal oh my that's right Luther
[1:46:30] just shall live by faith Wesley

[1:46:35] the Holy

[1:46:40] let's look at the rule how many wants me
[1:46:41] to give you this rule a little bit the
[1:46:44] rule of God's word that's required of us
[1:46:48] how many is a big requirement of us
[1:46:51] that's right
[1:46:54] a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee
[1:46:57] what a glorious
[1:46:58] decision thou H has
[1:47:01] made
[1:47:03] amen for one thing how many knows that
[1:47:05] the prophet of God said that in order to
[1:47:07] be there he said thus sayith the Lord
[1:47:11] it'll take perfect love to put you in
[1:47:13] that
[1:47:15] place wow you know what Jesus said love
[1:47:19] your enemies and so forth it'll take
[1:47:22] that perfect love don't never let
[1:47:23] animosity bitterness or anything like
[1:47:26] that ever come into your heart if you
[1:47:28] have that bitterness if you have hatred
[1:47:30] in your heart and things the whole Lord
[1:47:32] comes you're going to be left
[1:47:34] behind you're going to be sitting there
[1:47:37] you're with spot and
[1:47:40] wrinkle there's nothing as perfect as
[1:47:43] perfect love ain't that right casts out
[1:47:44] all
[1:47:45] fear amen I thought about the
[1:47:49] requirements let me just go back a
[1:47:50] little bit I don't think I pulled this
[1:47:52] one up but you'll remember about the
[1:47:54] prophet of God he said that uh Charlie
[1:47:55] and them were down there shooting
[1:47:56] squirrels with a shotgun boom blast him
[1:48:00] out of the tree I got him yeah we got a
[1:48:01] whole five gallon Buck full but a
[1:48:03] abandon was sitting up there amen and
[1:48:05] his gun wasn't quite shooting right it
[1:48:07] was not driving tax out of 50 yards
[1:48:10] brother bam when he shot at the shooting
[1:48:12] range he wanted one bullet to go through
[1:48:14] the other one and when I'm sting to me I
[1:48:16] like for him to amen make the hole don't
[1:48:19] even make the hole bigger is that what
[1:48:21] brother B said his was doing the hole
[1:48:23] wasn't even getting bigger somebody said
[1:48:25] you missed no it went through the same
[1:48:27] hole woo that's how the prophet of God
[1:48:29] was amen when he was missing it he was
[1:48:31] sitting there crying in a nervous wreck
[1:48:34] and he said he got a revelation God says
[1:48:37] I made you that way for a
[1:48:40] purpose he like to have it dead on
[1:48:43] aren't you glad for a prophet like that
[1:48:45] he wanted exactly like Paul preached
[1:48:47] when he went over beyond the curtain of
[1:48:48] time he asked if Paul's group is going
[1:48:51] to have to be h a judge Paul's gonna
[1:48:53] have to be judged oh yeah he's gonna
[1:48:56] have to be judged too well Hallelujah
[1:48:58] then my group will going in because I
[1:49:00] had a bull's eye amen I taught what Paul
[1:49:03] taught amen and I can hear Millions were
[1:49:07] cried
[1:49:09] out come on I can't hear
[1:49:12] you we're resting on that go ahead we're
[1:49:16] resting on that how many's resting on
[1:49:20] that we ain't over there yet but we're
[1:49:22] still resting on
[1:49:24] it because we can take what he said
[1:49:26] right back to the word Bullseye
[1:49:30] Perfection
[1:49:34] Precision I don't have to yell don't
[1:49:36] have to scream this but you know that by
[1:49:38] the time we get finished living this
[1:49:40] message we'll be what we need to
[1:49:44] be we will possess what we need to
[1:49:48] possess to make the Rapture why because
[1:49:51] he said there's rapture pring Faith lays
[1:49:54] in that
[1:49:55] message
[1:49:59] amen and before he said that brother
[1:50:01] Brad he got to talking about everything
[1:50:03] God had done in the ministry he raised
[1:50:05] the dead he healed the sick and he did
[1:50:07] all these absolutely infallible proofs
[1:50:10] it should give you Faith he said for a
[1:50:12] Rapture it should give you rapturing
[1:50:16] Faith
[1:50:18] amen praise the
[1:50:20] Lord oh my he said it'll take perfect
[1:50:23] love to put you in that place that's all
[1:50:26] there was there no matter what money how
[1:50:28] much religious
[1:50:30] demonstrations how many Good Deeds you
[1:50:32] have done or what
[1:50:33] more amen you might have spoken tongues
[1:50:37] you might have done this you might have
[1:50:39] give your body to be you might have all
[1:50:40] of those things but there's still too
[1:50:43] much loss of
[1:50:46] compression if you ain't got this love
[1:50:49] it's not precise enough and that
[1:50:52] something something that even Jesus when
[1:50:53] he was talking about loving your enemies
[1:50:55] and so forth he said that just before
[1:50:57] said be perfect as your heavenly father
[1:51:00] is
[1:51:04] perfect brother Troy what kind of people

[1:52:27] lay aside everything
[1:52:29] else shave off all the Loose Ends isn't
[1:52:32] that right shave everything off until
[1:52:33] you've got that until you're so filled
[1:52:36] with God and the love of God till you
[1:52:37] can love those who hates you amen praise
[1:52:41] the Lord another one two of the ones
[1:52:44] that I've preached here many times and
[1:52:46] I'm going to continue to preach them
[1:52:48] amen is that all right but this is the
[1:52:50] line this is what he taught us
[1:52:53] Amen Let me see
[1:52:59] here therefore as the evening Shadows
[1:53:01] are appearing and the Wrath is ready to
[1:53:03] be poured out from on high upon ungodly
[1:53:07] Nations upon ungodly unbelievers the
[1:53:11] professors without a
[1:53:14] profession how many believes that if
[1:53:16] you're a professor and you don't have
[1:53:18] possessions you're going to stand the
[1:53:20] wrath of God this morning
[1:53:23] if you don't have a
[1:53:25] possession get a
[1:53:28] possession don't just have a profession
[1:53:30] make sure that you possess the holy
[1:53:33] ghost in your soul upon these things
[1:53:37] I've tried to unfold myself and live
[1:53:39] right among it to see where it's
[1:53:41] standing before I said these things now
[1:53:44] we are living in the shadows and the WRA
[1:53:47] wrath is ready to strike and God is
[1:53:49] requiring amen God is requiring a token
[1:53:53] that you yourself have received this
[1:53:54] token the Holy Ghost it's the only way
[1:53:58] the only sign that God will ever pass
[1:54:01] because it's the literal life of Jesus
[1:54:04] Christ returned back into the believer
[1:54:08] we won't go into great detail take us a
[1:54:09] while but we all understand amen that
[1:54:11] it's not just a chemistry of the blood
[1:54:14] anymore you people say all day long they
[1:54:17] believe in enough Jesus died for me he
[1:54:19] shed his blood and I believe it was for
[1:54:21] me but just the mental faith of that
[1:54:23] mental belief of that is not going to be
[1:54:26] enough no it takes now he says the life
[1:54:29] that was in the blood has to come back
[1:54:32] on the believer and that is the literal
[1:54:35] life of Jesus Christ it has to be God in
[1:54:38] our talk it has to be God in our what
[1:54:40] daily walk everything about it it's got
[1:54:43] to be the literal life it's the only
[1:54:44] thing one of these more mornings when he
[1:54:46] comes between six and nine it's those
[1:54:48] who are living his life that he comes to
[1:54:51] take
[1:54:53] that's the other requirement of course
[1:54:55] you can't have perfect love without
[1:54:56] having this isn't that right so perfect
[1:54:59] love is part
[1:55:00] of this per amen this holy
[1:55:04] spirit because the animal life could not
[1:55:07] return

[1:56:24] ain't it ain't that you're never going
[1:56:25] to make a mistake brother Bram says that
[1:56:28] Perfection that you're Desiring is on
[1:56:30] that side as long as you're in this
[1:56:32] flesh it will stumble sometimes now let

[1:57:07] Brother Martin Luther you know he
[1:57:10] preached that just shall live by faith
[1:57:13] but he had a lot of looseness about him

[1:57:19] little maybe and dis that or the other
[1:57:21] all kinds of things that shouldn't have
[1:57:23] been amen I want to say today that I
[1:57:26] believe our Prophet through go God
[1:57:28] through our Prophet has brought us the
[1:57:30] correct understanding of justification
[1:57:32] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:57:35] Ghost is that right the Holy Ghost the
[1:57:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts
[1:57:39] of the Spirit am mean they made a way
[1:57:42] for the Holy Spirit himself to come down
[1:57:45] and to live in you and in iing it's a
[1:57:47] whole lot more than just speaking in

[1:58:13] some unknown tongue we've got the giver
[1:58:16] of tongues I believe in the gifts and so

[1:59:09] saw it they Marvel saying how soon is
[1:59:12] the Fig Tree withered away and
[1:59:15] Jesus Jesus answered and said unto them
