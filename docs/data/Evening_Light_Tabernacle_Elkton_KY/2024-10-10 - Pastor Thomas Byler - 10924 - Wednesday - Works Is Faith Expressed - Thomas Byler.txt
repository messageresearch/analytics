[Music] amen good to be in the house of the Lord tonight thankful for a roof over our head and uh there's a lot of Devastation that we're dealing with uh uh that we're taken up for but there's more on the way according to the meteorologist in Florida so we got a lot to be thankful for tonight want to be praying for our brothers and sisters down there but I just want to give you a quick update of uh where we're at with our project here I I just can't say how how proud I am of everybody that's uh come forward and and made phone calls and got other people involved the community involved and and um you know I was worried if I was just going to have to drive up to Johnson City with a can of green beans well I've got 5400 lbs of food in my trailer and we got another trailer coming to pick up probably that much more to go tomorrow so uh God is awesome and U not not only not only that but just to let you know uh people's been making phone calls and and are wanting to help and what I've got

you this week has been a big week and I I don't know why but I just felt to do it for two weeks we've got numerous churches that's wanting to join in and help us for next week and so I'm expecting probably this much Goods or more next week we may have to take a tractor and trailer next week uh I know of I think six churches that I know of that have said they're they're want to take it before their congregations brother David's been on the phone with different people he knows two churches and so there's one that's contacted me and and two or three more that that are that are talking so um and if you know people it's it's a it's a great it's a it's a great cause that it's going for and people want to help so if they're informed uh you know my father-in-law used to say uh informed people or giving people and so we don't see anything that we've done to to lift ourself it's nothing it's just something the Lord laid on our hearts for and and this congregation has stepped up the community

already doing it father and and will do it Lord Jesus and that you'll be well father we just ask now in Jesus name that you'd be with us amen and amen God bless you amen if you will we'll just get right into the word of God Amen I think most of everything's been taken care of Amen so we'll go amen and uh there's a little quote I mean I couldn't even find the quote so you forgive me for that but I remember brother bandham saying something about you know amen you have to do something for God to bless Amen to for him to be able to bless and so this evening if you will to book go go to the Book of James if you will amen works is Faith expressed is what I titled it amen but I want to talk about actions that God can bless God actions that God can bless and basically we want to talk a little bit amen about amen our actions and so forth Amen in James 2 and verse 20 it says but Willl thou know oh will but will thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead was not Abraham Our Father father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar if you'll notice it sounds sounds to contradictory to verse um verse 23 which we're fixing to read see us thou how Faith wrought with his works and by work by works his faith was perfected amen so what we got together from that is when you've got works that match your faith then it's complete amen it's perfect perfect when your Works match your faith amen praise the Lord and the scripture was fulfilled that saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God see then how that by works a man is Justified and not by faith only likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works when she had receiv received the messengers and had sent them out in another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead Also may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen I want to tell take a few stories basically a few illustrations amen down through amen through the scriptures if I can with just the help of the Lord amen I want to take Abraham first of all Abraham now how many knows that Abraham believed God is that right and Abraham believed God and he was imputed unto him for righteous God knew Abraham believed him is that right according to the scriptures even Paul said we're justified by faith now aren't you glad for a prophet because Prophet said you know what Paul said about being justified by faith and Abraham just Abraham was justified by faith he said that's what God saw but what James was talking about is what man saw how many remembers brother BR describing that man the way that man sees that if you say you have faith in and then your Works don't add up to it well it's not very much meaning to it James said faith without works was dead amen how many knows that we are not saved by works we're not talking about you being saved or getting saved by works amen now there is a group of people that get saved by works a that right and hopefully at the end of the service maybe tarand or whenever I feel led to a me we'll go into and look at it but that's not in the bride of Christ that's a different group of people amen different group of people but we're amen Saved By Faith but it's what we do after we're saved and the works that we do God everything that we do amen either God can bless that or he cannot bless that and there's we want to look at some things that God can bless and that God likes amen the things that we do amen now let me just quickly talk a little bit before I go into Abraham talk about something of the things that God does not like actions or works that God don't like okay how about Saul that right Saul when he was commissioned to go and defeat the Philistines I believe it was to go down there and utterly destroy everything that was the command is that right and he went down and he destroyed everything but I think the king and also a lot of sheep and so forth is that right kept the lot of the sheep and brought back and guess what he had them killed and he slaughtered these sheep for the Lord slaughtered all of these sheep for the Lord and boy I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do something I'm going to do this for the Lord and it didn't end well you know because after he had done all of this and Samuel comes and says you know Saul have you done what you were supposed to do and said Paul said I've done the Commandment of the Lord and said why do I then hear the bleeding of these sheep why do I hear the bleeding of the sheep if everything was supposed to be dead amen and the story was the The Final Answer was amen that God loves obedience more than sacrifice so what makes God happy and what pleases the Lord is when we are obedient God looks for those kind of works from us obedience acts of obedience Jesus himself when he was here he said if you love me keep my Commandments in other words do what I say if you want to be pleasing to the Lord and doing something that God can bless amen but Paul I mean Saul was doing something that was not the will of God woo this goes me message people listen I know people that have ideas and they have things and all you know uh you know a certain way that they want to do this that or the other make sure everything's according to the word because you in your enthusiasm if it isn't according to the word of God God is not going to be pleased with it he's not H not going to be happy with it one my voice is really out tonight a't it amen so we look at that we look at him and also look at David is that right right David one time he wanted to bring the ark back didn't he he wanted to bring the Ark of a covenant back and oh it was a good idea was a Godly thing it was awesome thing it was a right thing amen but the Bible says according to brother banam and preaching uh doing God a service without it being his Will said he consulted the H Captain them of hundreds and thousands and the Mighty Men and the noble men he consulted everybody except the man he was supposed to consult which was the prophet never consulted the prophet the captains of Mighty Men and all of these things all had a good ide that's a good idea how many know you can't operate under a good idea it has to be under the inspiration of God it has to be by the word of the Lord and because of that when they about stumbled you know and Men tried to grab that the cart and everything and they got killed and it was a reproach and they came home defeated and sad and blue amen amen because they were doing something and brother brand preached a big message on it doing God a service without it being his will now how many knows he said that about the churches yeah they they oh this is a good idea I think we can do this this out other no no no amen what God wants you to do is do what he told you to do but be obedient to the voice of God Amen and we'll get into that a little bit more so anything that's not according to the will of God Cain was the same way is that right he had church he he worshiped he brought sacrifice he did all of that but it was not according to the will of God Amen and what did God do refuse his offering then he went out with an attitude because this is what I can offer to God and if God don't accept it well then I'm just not going to do it I'm here to tell you if that's your m it you're b g up at the same place gain did amen how many knows we have to line up with God don't try to make God line up with what you're thinking amen what but how blessed it is when you do and can conduct yourself and act according to the word of God and God can bless that he loves that but that's some of the things that some of the works that you don't want amen some of the things you don't want to do amen no matter what the idea or whatever it might be it has to be amen according to what God tells him to do amen David all right Cain Dayan many other illustrations but back to Abraham Now isn't it something how that God seen a Abraham's heart he knew whether he really believed or not he really did believe but yet God tested him he tried him and told him to take his son to do something perhaps that you aren't supposed to do and that's murder your child but he knew it was the voice of God said go do it and what did he do he went and he went all the way up to the top of the mountain is that right made the altar even his son saying here's the sacrifice here's the wood and the fire but where's the sacrifice brother BR preached a many a message on Jehovah Gyra God will provide himself a sacrifice how many believes God Prov Ed himself a sacrifice for you and I amen and whenever he had the Oh my he let him go all the way and the knife coming back and he held his hand and that right stopped him he was going to stab that boy God said kill him I'm going to kill him W Glory how many know that's what God wants out of you that's what God wants out of me if God said it he wants to prove to to uh uh wants you to prove to him that you really believe it so you might say you have faith but get ready God's going to make you prove it now I want to say that God loves Works God loves our actions amen he loves actions he likes to see what we do with what he has already done Ain that right he cares now do you care he loved he gave he went to Calvary now what will we do with what he did and it determines your internal destination don't it it's a pretty big deal amen that's right all right actions that God loves and some actions that God don't like he said in Mark 9 and verse 41 he says for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye belong to Christ verily I say unto you you shall not lose he shall not lose his reward you can't give a cup of water to one of God's children but God's going to reward you for it so so you see how many believes God cares about what we do he loves our to see our actions every action that we have always is either blessed or cursed it's either right or it's wrong it's better to have inaction than the wrong action amen there's a time to be still and know that he is God some times God don't want you to do anything but believe just stay there and be still amen all right we're going to go through some of these but that we'll get through the main part of what really God loves okay so he says look that's right a cup of water to one of God's children but on the on the opposite hand now my and this we got to be careful and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones just offend them I am so offended you are so offended this person greatly greatly offended me huh but just to offend one of these little ones that believe in me it's better that a millstone were hanged about his neck and him been drowned in the depth of the SE my gracious thrown overboard in the ocean with a big old weight on your neck what is a millstone I don't know how much a millstone weighs but I'm sure it's enough to take you plenty far down huh so if you offend one you get a reward also many would say Lord help me never to offend one of God's children and if I know I do or did God help me to say I'm sorry make it right right but it just doesn't go unnoticed by God Amen praise the Lord that's right amen 1 Timothy 5'8 says if any provide not for his own and those of his own household in other words if you don't have any Works you're so Heavenly minded you're no Earth good you're worse than an Infidel that right I kind of thought about that when talking about Works people don't want to work don't want to supply for their family don't want to take care of your wife and your children and so forth Paul said you're worse than the Infidel so God looks for Works in that way too Amen in that manner praise the Lord talents remember God give his servants talents and I have a kind of a new revelation you all forgive me if this isn't correct but follow me with this giving us those talents is kind of like money and money is like our lives these talents or should I say these talents are like our lives the way that you spend them whether you profit from it or not is that right the way you invest the way you spend your talents and the way with your talents amen do you gain from it or do you lose from it how many knows our lives are that way you realize that God give us let's say a million dollar of life when that money when that money is spent you're old and you're laying in the deathbed how many know we spend our lives how do you spend your life what do you do with your life amen because every take every moment you're spending it spending it spend it so God cares about what you do and how many knows you'll give an account for your life every thought that you had every word that you spoke every deed that you done you got to give a count God gives you that life now spend it let me see how you do with it that's why I compared it with those talents because it's kind of a spending and see God's going to at the end say well how did you do you accepted me with the life yeah I accepted my my Holy Spirit you got eternal life and how many maybe you gained a couple others maybe you witnessed to somebody else and you gained one or two others brother baham says if we're not winning Souls then we're failing amen trying to get people to God Amen talents is an example of God caring about what you do with what you got amen many other ways and I'm not going to go into this too much but Matthew 5 talks about a reward if blessed are you when man people will say all manner of things uh against you falsely and I wrote down here you know if the people accuse you of this and call you that and call you this and mean all kinds of manner it's falsely blessed are you great is your reward Peter said but you know if you get accused of something and it's really true there's not really a reward for that no it has to be falsely called and cast your name out as evil make you look evil when you're good then you get a blessing there's a reward in that God likes that God likes those type of Works turn to your other cheek you know go to the extra mile they ask you this give them that also they did that with Jesus a't that right they accuse you of this and accuse you of that Danny I'm telling you now I saw you do something yesterday you know you did this that and the other and just keep quiet well you know Jesus when he was accused he'd just be quiet and the pilot and says man don't you realize we're accusing you of that stuff you know don't you realize I got the power to release you to save you he says he wouldn't have any power at all they W for my papa up prayer that right for the father you have no power at all he didn't worry about taking care and and trying to justify himself there's times that you do you understand there's a balance in it all amen because when Simon did what he did he says Simon I got something to say to you there's a time to say something and there's a time to be quiet amen I've learned that over the years amen all right praise the Lord amen God cares about whether you say the right thing a that right whether you say the right thing God blesses us according to our word brother brand remember was there and he was testifying of how God had created those squirrels sto stopped the storm he says four times three four times that God did that right he talking about how God stopped the storm and then he created the squirrels and had he right a that right she opened up her mouth and she said something she said that ain't man that ain't nothing but the truth amen and God was so happy with that he liked that so well because how many knows that God isn't brother bam wasn't the one that stopped the storm he just spoke to it because God said speak it was God that stopped the storm I don't know invisible Angels going blowing it back I don't know but it was the power of almighty God blowing that storm back and bringing the sunshine hello it was God that stopped the bull and blinded him and everything ain't that right it's God that stopped the Hornets amen and so he was telling all this and because somebody would believe that and say it ain't nothing but a truth but the truth how many would say that with me this message it is nothing but the truth every story it ain't nothing but the truth amen it might get old to some folks amen even there was a man that said you know butter bam amen your vision was all wonderful until you talked about your horse being up in heaven ain't going to be no horses Heaven ain't for no horses so you see how people get their minds mled up first of all he said that God had given them a vision so if you want to speak against somebody that says God gave me a vision go ahead brother John if you had a vision of something you say God give me a vision it might be questionable I'd rather shut my mouth than no I don't believe it because you can get in trouble for that if God actually did it CU God actually give him the vision of that horse and so forth this man didn't believe it and mean I'm sure he was rewarded for it and oh my my brother Brandon came back and says oh really well isn't that something over in Revelations when he comes back from the heavens of Heaven the Bible says he's on a white horse and he says all the hosts of Heaven are the white horse is with them shut up already you unbeliever said the wrong thing don't know the story just exactly y'all might be able to tell me afterwards but didn't somebody see that picture and say something positive about it and got healed right on the spot I feel if I'm not wrong somebody said something right about that picture in the Halo and they were healed because of it you me I'm amen sure why how many believes that what you say about that right there you're saying about God cuz God took his picture he went through the trouble of not letting anything else be developed and except for the him and his power amen the pillar of fire who in the world would want to say something negative about that watch your mouth God is listening he's watching your actions he's watching your words but I thought oh my God was so pleased with Hattie's response and I believe that's the way it ought to be with every one of us Lord help me to say the right thing boy I'll tell you if one of us is sick if one of us is down or going through a trial or trouble we can say a that guy's got secret sin huh you reckon that's the right word I don't reckon it is been there done that heard that knowed it ain't the right thing and somebody goes through a hard time and then you're down on them amen why well we're believing for you brother these things come our way you'd be shocked at what God will let people go through to see how you do amen had it right said the right words brother B says if I've told you the truth had it right just now there's like a wind or something that came into the room amen and that voice said tell her that because of what she said you get ask whatever you want and you'll be it'll be in your lap if it's not I'm a false prophet one of the first things he mentioned he says well you're poor you're up on the Hills you could ask for money that was one of the first things I read it second is of course her children and then her mom and dad at her age and so forth different things but what's the most what's the greatest thing you desire she said my boys and Bam they come and laid on her lap a that right God help us if you want to be blessed let your actions in your mouth say the right thing Lord help us tonight always let me say the right thing amen praise the Lord amen praise the Lord God loves when we say the right words biblically in the Bible somebody said the right right word right I believe it was a Samaritan woman Gentile that was following Jesus needed healing amen for her daughter I believe it was amen and she followed him and followed and and followed him and wouldn't answer wouldn't answer her or anything you know and then finally he answered it's not meat to give the children's bread to dogs but she said the right thing she says yay Lord amen anybody that's a Christian will always agree yes Lord You're right you're right Lord that's true but you know what there's dogs sometimes under the table and if there's a crumb that falls anybody of us have H dogs you know you better not drop it right because that whole thing will snatch it up dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table amen why she said the right word be it unto you according to your faith it's what he said amen what about the the soldier the Centurion I believe it is ain't that right amen he had one of his servants that needed healing and Jesus offered to come to his house offered to come to his house I'll come to your house he said no you don't have to come I'm not worthy such respect how many believe that God loves respect of people if you want to have a great reward if you want to have your life saturated with almighty God and blessing re respect god with your life and everything you do have respect for him respect him more than anything else you respect in Earth amen if you'll just I'm a man under Authority has I have I have people under my authority I say come and he comes I say go and he goes and I know you have the word and if you would just say the word I know it'll be done God Jesus didn't he say I haven't found this great a faith in Israel just speak the word let me tell you something how many believes he has spoken the word if you'll just believe that word God loves for you just to believe what he said and you'll be rewarded accordingly amen amen I'll go count down this this a little bit make God loves for you to make the right choice make the right choice remember that prophecy that Frenchman spoke over brother Brandon when he was coming up there to tell him say hey that could be the 23rd chapter of Revelations I think there's 22 and he was knocking him at the 23rd chapter of Revelations not really biblical or whatever and instead of saying sat all of a sudden he spoke in tongues and other spoke in tongues amen and all of that came back and he says because you have chosen the harder way amen you've made the correct and precise decision and because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits you see when the brother when it go when the going got hard when people offered him airplane rids and everything taken care of just let up a little bit on the godhead and the water baptism and women done all this that or the other is that what he wanted him to do but he said no uhuh this is my very car he chose the harder way the harder path and God said you have chosen my way and because of that you and I is going to be waiting on him over there well maybe not he's over there already we got to go over there to meet him is that right that's right but a huge portion of Heaven millions are going to be waiting for him over there because he made the right choice God loved that he made the right he loves when you make the right choice amen Lord help us to make good choices amen praise the Lord when you're claiming your healing or you need anything from God Amen he loves when you confess it before you ever see it be go go out there and begin to confess it say I'm Healed I'm healed amen sometimes faith is an act I know sometimes faith is an act because sometimes you get into situations and you got to choose whether you're going to complain not believe or whether you're going to say I believe God on this it's an act amen three Hebrews children they didn't know whether God was they made the right choice they said we don't know whether God will or not but God loves an attitude of perseverance determination how many know God loves that but Robinson he could never get the Holy Ghost couldn't get the Holy Ghost and couldn't get overcome his temper and everything else amen until one day he got real he got real desperate stopped his mules or whatever got in there and to plow and everything in the corn field and said man if you don't come and give me the Holy Ghost you'll find a pile of B that's right another place he says Lord give me uh the Holy Ghost let me fight the devil till I ain't got a no tooth left and then let me gum him till I die God loves that type of stuff he loves people that are persevering amen not wishy-washy I heard brother baham say if you have faith like well maybe if God wants me to have it then I'll get it if not I get he says you ain't never getting it that way you got to say it's mine I believe it don't have Hazard it say it's yours God loves you to do have that kind of attitude to believe in that way amen if you looking for healing or whatever it might be you know and you can't let didn't he say one time you can't move your arm or fingers but amen just one little finger start moving that finger amen if you're un crutch this for them crutches just start believing God loves that amen praise be to God the lepers he loves the attitude of those five lepers over in Kings Four lepers I mean amen they said one to another why sit we here until we die if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit here we die also now therefore come and let us fall on the host of the syrians if the sav is alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die I thought sometimes you know just just no way direction to go maybe there's God forces you to absolutely just be able to go One Direction well then go in that direction when God closes all other doors go to the one that's open have a little faith they didn't know they said we might not we're definitely going to die here if you're in a bad place in a bad way don't stay there see I'm getting out of this place in this way there's a better way amen I like their attitude and what happened because of it God liked it he liked it so well that them were the guys that came back and told the Israelites hey they're all dead over there no ah they're not yes they are them guys were a little bit they were they were a little bit listen to this I love the way these guys the Lord made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of Chariots noise of horses even a noise of a a mighty host and they said one to another Lord the king of Israel has hired somebody against us the Hittites the Egyptians to come upon they fled they arose and fled into Twilight and left their tents and horses and asses and Camp just like it was and fled for their life the lepers came to the utmost part of C they had went went into one t tent they drank they ate woo huh just the chapter before that in the city where it was a famine a woman had come to the king and said hey I want you to give me something to eat because yesterday me and another woman agreed that we would eat my baby today and hers tomorrow we ate and cooked my baby today and now the next day came and she hid her child that's the kind of famine it was pretty B dead praise God for Walmarts fellow Americans that'll help us when we get in need ain't that right we ain't got to boil nobody's baby but anyway the point was look at that they went there they carried thin silver and gold and rment went and hid it and came again and did it another one and did they went to hideing some stuff I'm here to tell you when you follow the lord and the leading of the lord it's a blessed thing are you with me just follow the leading of the spirit amen praise the Lord all right praise the Lord now let's talk a little bit about one of the things that God loves the best that he loves to see the best about us he likes to see our works he likes to see what we do or how we act to his action it's called an action or a reaction to an action that's what he like he really likes that amen it's when your faith is really being put to the test like he did Abraham he wanted to see how Abraham would squirm how Abraham would this doesn't make a lot of sense he gave me Isaac waited 25 years to get it and now God wants me to kill it how many beliefs he had to cast out all of his Common Sense there was times that brother Brandon would go back into scriptures because he'd hear that voice say certain things and he says well let me see if that's scriptural is't that right no doubt Abraham had to do that let me see if that's scriptural amen he fought with it no doubt but he knew that that was that voice that same voice that said I'll give you here your son that right so he followed it and believed it amen Abraham the knife up do you think in his mind he says I'm gonna I'm gonna bring this thing down just to here but I'm going to stop just before it is because I can't do it but you think he thought that or when he raised that hand back do you not imagine that he was going all the way with it yeah and the voice had to said stop stop right on time how many believ God sees us and watches every move we make he watches our actions and he loves to see our reaction the way we React to what God allows to come our way because it's a lot of times easy to premeditate something premeditate something but when there's a no premeditation in it amen no premeditation God loves to see your reaction amen he tests us to the utmost how many believes that we're not immune we're not exempt from God's testing us and trying us he did everyone all everyone that comes to God must be tried the Bible says You must be tested he will test you he'll allow things to come your way to see how you react to it to see whether you really have faith in God or whether or you don't that right we all know that the Israelites went out with three million people Joshua Caleb and the and the parents' children went in but all of those three millions perished in the wilderness because God kept testing them they he kept trying them he kept watching their reaction to his actions he let him get hungry he let him get thirsty he let him come up against the Red Sea get trapped every manner we love history we love to hear history but sometimes we don't like when God does it to us it's a different story when it happens to you when it happens to me it's not as easy I want to tell you something oh I hope nobody gets mad at me for this but I want you to know that God is smart he's smart he can outsmart you any day of the week and when you think you got it whipped he will come at you in a way that you're not expecting to him to come at you he'll get you off guard to see your reaction how many believe that well I know this now so I'll be careful I'll know that now so I'll be care you don't know nothing you just better be on your prayer bones and say God when this thing happens and that unexpected thing comes into my life help me to react in the right way how many want to say that Lord when that unexpected thing happens in my life that I don't like that man it's just out of nowhere how it ever happen I'm a Child of God I do everything that I'm supposed to do and here this happens to me huh let's watch how you react that's what God loves to do he loves to see your actions see what you do that's why he did it to Abraham if he did it to Abraham he does it to all of his seed after him everybody that comes to God must be tried and tested and we in this lay out of C AG hello Rich our clause it's full how many Brother Brad I don't know if they'll take used clothes or not but I don't know if anybody brought used clothes but man if we are emptied our closets out couldn't we just pick a bunch of stuff huh shoes I don't know why my feet have gotten a little bit sensitive to shoes and I've got about 12 pair of different work shoes just stay with tennis shoes Tom

you're ever GNA serve God you got to die to that man how many believes that die to lukewarmness die to die to lazy die to your own way your own thoughts your own ideas amen remember T very end 1965 brother brand preaching message called God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief the token brother B says man outside of full obedience to the full word of God that's the only thing that entitles you to the Token amen so full obedience God loves when you just simply obey what he said let your actions be simple obedience simple obedience more than any other sacrifice that you could make to God if you just simply obey him that is pleasing to almighty God I'm sure that's what we're all here for tonight Lord help me to be pleasing to you amen praise the Lord God's actions was to send this world this generation a message ain't that right God's actions was to prove it infallible he had a man to sacrifice his life and guess what God was working in this generation he was busy Christ was busy always coming to the platform Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart to show the World Christ now my question is how do people react to that amen I don't know about you but I hope we all would say this message is nothing but the truth let's all say it this message is nothing but the truth God deserves that because he came and confirmed it so you'd have something to follow and know what was right pic had right could say that's nothing but the truth for just those things that he was talking about Lord help us to say this message is nothing but the truth I believe it with all of my heart and I believe it's pleasing to God do you reckon that God is very pleased with these preachers that are going around and say well brother Brandon was wrong on this and brother Brandon was wrong on that and this date here don't line up and that late there don't line up amen I've listened to I didn't really want to listen to these preachers because I was afraid of the effect it would had but on YouTube one of them give him their testimonies one Ohio and and and Lonnie jenin son I'm going to just call the name he gave a testimony of why he went the way that he did lost his church and all of that he did and I'm here to tell you the Folly in the man was not it was to me it wasn't close oh I believe he was a prophet I believe he was a prophet but where did he have the right to do this and where did he have the right to put this here and that there and I'm like boy are you stupid he was a prophet that's what give him the right and who do you think you are to say he's wrong who in the world do you think you are to say he's wrong he's the prophet not you and who in the world do you put yourself above the prophet that's what he did when I watched it I was like boy this is isn't even close this isn't even deceiving anybody listen to this boy they just got the wrong Spirit to start with amen so I hope that helps y'all if y'all listen to any of that pick it up quick that hey he wants to acknowledge he was a prophet he wants to say yeah you know it was great Miracles he really loved it and he justs believe it but then he thinks that the prophet couldn't place this here make himself Malika or this that or the other amen oh my I'm like wow and you think you know it better than he did that ain't too smart in my book God isn't going to be too happy with you amen you know the scary part Brother Brad is when they turn like that the Bible says when they willfully disbelieve after getting the truth there's no more sin no more no more amen that's why I never look for to repent I never look for him to come back if he did I'd be shocked hello Bible says there's no more forgiveness for such things when you hear the truth and then you willfully disbelieve it it's a terrible place to be God is not happy how many's glad to believe the message God sent I'm glad to oh my yeah God give him God hand thank thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord amen praise the Lord I'mma
