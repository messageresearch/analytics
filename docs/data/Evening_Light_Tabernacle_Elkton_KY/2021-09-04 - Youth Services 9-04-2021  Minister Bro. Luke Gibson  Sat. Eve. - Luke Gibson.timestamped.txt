[42:23] brother branham was in chicago in the
[42:25] 50s and had quite a meeting there there
[42:27] was a brother that was in that meeting
[42:29] brother byler
[42:30] there was several hundred that came to
[42:32] the altar every night brother and would
[42:34] have an altar call and there were
[42:35] several hundred that would come to the
[42:37] altar the brother was just elated to be
[42:39] in such a powerful meeting and he said
[42:42] to brother branham at the end of the
[42:43] meeting brother branham i believe of all
[42:45] the meetings we've been in this has been
[42:46] one of the greatest he said why is that
[42:48] he said there were several hundred that
[42:50] came every night to the altar he stopped
[42:53] and he said but brother the two god sent
[42:55] me after came the first night
[42:59] isn't that incredible
[43:00] he'll pass over hundreds pass by
[43:03] thousands even millions to get down to
[43:06] find you amen if he's chose you and
[43:09] ordained you and predestinated you from
[43:10] the foundation world we can run but we
[43:13] can't hide
[43:14] amen i don't want to hide from him
[43:15] tonight i want to hide in him amen i
[43:18] want to be so far in christ the devil
[43:20] don't even know what to do with me amen
[43:22] how many feels that way
[43:24] as you're staying tonight we want to get
[43:26] right into the message first samuel
[43:27] chapter four if you have your bibles
[43:29] i'll do my best to be a little bit uh
[43:31] less time preaching tonight than i was
[43:34] last night you forgive me if i took too
[43:36] long last night i was trying to not take
[43:38] so long sometimes that's your fault
[43:40] because you pull too hard and and you
[43:42] keep making us preach when we're trying
[43:43] to stop but you just keep pulling
[43:45] somebody told me one time said preacher
[43:47] you preached too fast i said no y'all
[43:49] just here too slow
[43:51] so if you'll hear as quick as i preach
[43:53] we'll get them a lot faster
[43:55] amen first samuel chapter four i want to
[43:58] read
[44:00] verse four verse five
[44:02] and verse six first samuel chapter four
[44:07] verse 4
[44:10] and so the people went to shiloh
[44:13] that they might bring from fence the ark
[44:17] of the covenant of the lord of hosts
[44:20] which dwelleth between the cherubims
[44:24] and the two sons of eli hofner and
[44:28] phineas were there with the ark of the
[44:30] covenant of god
[44:32] and when the ark of the covenant of the
[44:34] lord came into the camp
[44:36] all israel shouted with great shout
[44:40] so that the earth rang
[44:43] again
[44:45] and when the philistines heard the noise
[44:47] of the shout they said what meaneth the
[44:50] noise of this great shout in the camp
[44:53] of the hebrews
[44:55] and they understood that the ark of the
[44:57] lord was come
[44:59] into
[45:01] the camp
[45:03] i'd like to bow our heads just a moment
[45:05] father
[45:07] we do thank you again this evening for
[45:09] your divine presence
[45:11] lord the wonderful specials and the
[45:14] songs of zion that was saying tonight
[45:16] that have encouraged our hearts and has
[45:19] prepared the ground now for your word
[45:23] lord your prophet said this is the most
[45:25] important part of any service is what we
[45:28] do with the word of god
[45:30] he also said any man
[45:32] humanly can take his hand and open the
[45:34] bible
[45:35] but it takes the holy ghost to make it
[45:37] live
[45:38] and father tonight we're depending upon
[45:40] you i'm asking you lord once again
[45:43] just to take us lord and put us in your
[45:46] hand help us to get out of the way
[45:48] tonight may you use our lips to speak
[45:51] our ears to hear our eyes to see
[45:54] our hearts to understand
[45:56] may you minister to every life and may
[45:58] every need that's represented among us
[46:01] be met because we believe tonight you're
[46:04] a god that can meet all of our need
[46:06] grant it to his father now and we'll
[46:08] give you praise for all things in the
[46:10] wonderful name of the lord jesus christ
[46:13] and the whole church says
[46:15] all the young people says
[46:17] everybody says
[46:19] amen god bless you you may be seated
[46:21] brother byler did text me today and
[46:23] wanted to know where i was
[46:25] i think they were supposed to have some
[46:26] kind of game
[46:28] a volleyball game of the old people
[46:30] against the young people and i texted
[46:32] him back and i said brother balor i was
[46:34] there last night and it looked like you
[46:36] had so many young people that they
[46:38] didn't need me
[46:43] you understood right
[46:46] amen it's hard to
[46:48] imagine yourself but you know at one
[46:49] time believe this or not at one time i
[46:51] was y'all's age
[46:54] that's right i was young younger i don't
[46:56] think i'm old i'm getting there but i'm
[46:59] not quite there but i feel young in my
[47:01] spirit tonight i feel young in christ
[47:05] i believe there's eternal youth in
[47:07] christ
[47:08] our souls are eternally young amen
[47:11] 18 to 21 preached a funeral the other
[47:14] day of a man who died at 81.
[47:17] i told his wife in the funeral or i just
[47:19] spoke at the funeral said 81 years old
[47:21] he took his last breath and in one
[47:23] moment's time
[47:25] he went from 81 and reversed his numbers
[47:28] to 18.
[47:29] that's a wonderful promise in christ
[47:31] tonight
[47:32] i want to look tonight first samuel
[47:34] chapter 4
[47:36] just to give you a background again of
[47:38] our subject
[47:40] israel as a nation had gone into
[47:43] apostasy
[47:45] now apostasy simply means they have
[47:48] forsaken the commandments of god they
[47:50] have forsaken god they forsook his word
[47:53] now you know god knew what kind of a
[47:56] nation israel was before he ever chose
[47:59] them and i'll tell you this israel never
[48:02] chose god
[48:03] god chose
[48:04] israel god didn't choose israel because
[48:07] he thought israel was greater than the
[48:09] other nations god don't need a nation
[48:12] that's great in whatever abilities or
[48:14] powers they got brother god can take
[48:17] nothing and hook himself to it make
[48:19] something out of it he's proved that
[48:21] right in this building tonight
[48:23] but he took israel and you know israel's
[48:26] like that unfaithful wife kept
[48:28] backsliding kept going away and kept
[48:31] going away but god's love just kept
[48:34] reaching out he'd send prophet after
[48:36] prophet after prophet they would come
[48:38] down there and speak thus saith the lord
[48:41] and shake
[48:42] israel until brother man said one place
[48:45] every prophet god sent he sent birth
[48:47] pains and he'd rock him back to his word
[48:50] then they would repeat the process but
[48:53] it got to the place that israel had went
[48:55] into apostasy the temple had gone bad
[48:59] eli the priest had gotten old
[49:02] and he was begin to permit things to go
[49:05] on
[49:06] in the house of god that was an
[49:08] abomination of god
[49:10] his sons
[49:11] excuse me for a moment we're committing
[49:13] lewd acts
[49:14] of sex inside the temple walls of god
[49:18] his own boys we would say tonight were
[49:21] his assistant pastors and the bible said
[49:24] they were sons of dale and and they were
[49:26] eli's descendants to be next priest in
[49:29] the tabernacle of the lord we'll tell
[49:31] you what happened god got angry god got
[49:34] angry with them because they started
[49:37] stealing the sacrifice and eating the
[49:39] meat of the sacrifices and stealing from
[49:42] the people of god bringing strange fire
[49:45] and committing lewd acts in the temple
[49:47] of god
[49:49] god decided what i read to you tonight
[49:51] the shout
[49:52] out was in the camp but god decided to
[49:56] send the philistines now that wasn't
[49:59] god's people but he decided to see send
[50:01] the philistines down to bring war
[50:04] against israel
[50:06] eli's two boys hofner
[50:09] and phineas when the philistines came to
[50:11] fight with israel they were so warped in
[50:15] their religious thinking that they
[50:17] thought they thought that they could
[50:19] continue in their apostasy as a nation
[50:22] that was supposed to be serving god they
[50:25] started serving the false gods and even
[50:27] though the tabernacle had now been
[50:29] listed as a reproach in the sight of god
[50:32] they felt that if they could take the
[50:34] ark of god even their condition to the
[50:37] battle filled with them and that ark
[50:40] represented the place of his presence
[50:42] the place of his word the place where
[50:45] his shekinah glory was they felt in
[50:47] spite of their sin god would give them
[50:50] the victory over the philistines
[50:53] but there's one thing that they forgot
[50:55] about it's one thing that many nations
[50:58] forget about it's one thing that many
[51:00] churches forget about it's one thing
[51:01] that many preachers forget about and
[51:03] it's even one thing that many lay
[51:05] members forget about and that is this
[51:08] god does not bless sin
[51:13] no god don't give victory over anything
[51:17] as long as it's living in sin i remember
[51:20] years ago we had
[51:23] the young boy that was in our church
[51:24] when i pastored down in florida about
[51:27] the age of 18 years old i started a
[51:29] church there in a little storefront
[51:31] young man came in the meeting and he
[51:33] just seemed like he could never get the
[51:34] victory my daddy was an elder in the
[51:37] faith and one day my daddy got to
[51:39] talking to him and he got to tell him my
[51:41] daddy i can't overcome this i can't
[51:43] overcome this i can't overcome this and
[51:45] my dad let him keep talking and finally
[51:47] my dad realized he said son i can tell
[51:50] you why you can't overcome it he said
[51:52] why brother gibson he said god don't
[51:54] deliver you from your friends he
[51:57] delivers you from your enemies so as
[51:59] long as you're making friends with those
[52:01] things god won't deliver you from it but
[52:04] you've got to get to the place that you
[52:06] don't love it you don't want it amen but
[52:08] as long as that desires there then
[52:10] you're going to have problems with it
[52:12] what we need tonight is the holy ghost
[52:14] to drop down and brother deliver us from
[52:17] the love of the things of the world
[52:21] i want to just kind of give you a little
[52:23] thought here for a moment we had a
[52:25] meeting one night and they say the old
[52:27] boy came to the order and he said
[52:28] preacher my god you gotta pray for me
[52:30] you know we used to have revivals and
[52:33] brother byler i hate to admit it we'd
[52:35] have revivals and people would get saved
[52:37] but be the same people god saved the
[52:39] last revival
[52:40] then we'd have another revival and
[52:42] people so many people get saved come to
[52:44] find out it was the same folk that got
[52:46] saved from the last revival
[52:48] finally one boy came up and said
[52:50] preacher you've got to pray for me said
[52:52] what's wrong son he said oh i got so
[52:54] many cobwebs in my spirit
[52:56] said i just need you to pray god clean
[52:58] the cobwebs so the old preacher laid
[53:01] hands on him and started praying the
[53:03] spirit of god fell on the young man he
[53:05] got on fire for god he went out you know
[53:07] and he just it kind of dwindled down
[53:10] after a few weeks next revival comes
[53:12] same evangelist come through young boy
[53:14] back at the altar said son want you back
[53:16] this time said preacher i hate them
[53:20] but i got cobwebs all in my spirit again
[53:23] i need you to pray for me again he said
[53:25] all right so finally the boy the
[53:27] preacher laid hands on the boy and he
[53:29] finally got so enthused in the spirit of
[53:31] god and he went out come back next
[53:33] revival same boy again
[53:36] preacher said my god son what's wrong he
[53:38] said pre-track i just got all them
[53:40] cobwebs pray god he said no
[53:42] no no we ain't praying god clean no pop
[53:46] webs we're gonna pray god kill the
[53:48] spider that's causing the cobwebs
[53:53] the bible said righteousness exalted a
[53:56] nation
[53:58] but sin
[53:59] is a reproach
[54:01] to any people
[54:02] now we can look around i won't for the
[54:05] sake of time i won't go through all of
[54:06] it but our nation's in trouble tonight
[54:09] we had a vindicated prophet that told us
[54:11] that america as a nation has rejected
[54:14] christ am i right said they turned down
[54:17] the gospel so all these people are
[54:20] screaming look i wouldn't care if you
[54:21] line me up ten thousand preachers that
[54:24] told you revivals coming america i would
[54:27] say like they said in the old testament
[54:29] if not there one more and then i would
[54:31] consult god's prophet and if all them
[54:34] ten thousand preachers were saying
[54:36] something different than that one man
[54:37] right there i take sides with that one
[54:40] man right there and he said there's no
[54:42] revival coming to america brother that's
[54:45] god vindicated man right there and he
[54:47] said america as a nation has turned down
[54:50] the gospel but see the sins of a nation
[54:54] can hinder a nation
[54:56] the sins of a church can hinder a church
[54:59] the sins of a family can hinder a family
[55:03] but only your own sin can hinder you
[55:06] so while the whole world is dying while
[55:09] the whole church world's cut off and
[55:10] they ought to see you while there may be
[55:12] members next to you dying that doesn't
[55:15] mean you have to die you can have a
[55:16] revival in your own heart amen if
[55:19] everybody else ain't in the spirit you
[55:21] can stay in the spirit it ain't nobody
[55:23] else praying you can still pray you can
[55:26] still have revival in your own heart
[55:28] even if there's death all around you
[55:31] say it can't happen then you tell me how
[55:33] darkness came all over the land of egypt
[55:36] but israel glory to god had light in her
[55:39] dwellings
[55:43] so what happened well
[55:45] they were shouting over the
[55:46] ark they would love to see the ark come
[55:49] into the camp
[55:50] and they sang and shouted so loud that
[55:53] the earth rang out
[55:56] but after that battle
[55:58] the philistines
[56:00] took control of the ark of the covenant
[56:04] so one of the messengers come back
[56:07] and they told eli the story and
[56:10] the bible declares him to be kind of a
[56:12] heavy man
[56:14] well not kind of he was a heavy man
[56:16] and when they told him the story the
[56:18] bible said he fell backwards and died
[56:22] when he heard the story of what happened
[56:24] not only did they tell him that the ark
[56:26] of the covenant was taken but both of
[56:28] his sons
[56:29] and phineas and went down in the battle
[56:31] in their own blood and they died on the
[56:33] battlefield
[56:35] it was more than what
[56:37] eli
[56:38] could tolerate isn't it tough isn't it
[56:40] tough when we sow our wild oats and then
[56:44] you know crop time comes and harvest
[56:47] time comes you know the bible said you
[56:49] sow the flesh you shall love the flesh
[56:51] reap corruption there's a lot of people
[56:53] that sold their wild oats and then when
[56:54] the harvest time comes they start
[56:56] praying for crop failure
[57:00] if you want something in the spirit then
[57:01] you got to sow in the spirit but their
[57:04] reaping time come now next standing to
[57:07] eli
[57:08] was his daughter-in-law
[57:11] and all of a sudden the daughter-in-law
[57:13] was about to give birth to a baby and
[57:15] when she'd heard that her husband had
[57:17] died on the battlefield and was killed
[57:20] and she saw her father-in-law fall in
[57:22] the chair backwards she she heard the
[57:24] ark of the covenant had been taken the
[57:25] bible said she fell to the earth when
[57:28] interval and gave birth to this baby
[57:32] when this baby come out
[57:34] she put a name on that baby
[57:36] and that baby's name was
[57:38] ichabod and that name ichaboc means the
[57:42] glory of the lord had departed from
[57:46] israel
[57:47] well that's a that's a terrible story to
[57:49] hear about
[57:50] the ark where the abiding presence is
[57:53] the glory of god the ark of the covenant
[57:55] represented god's presence god's words
[57:58] god shekinah god's glory and what we've
[58:01] seen was because of their lack of
[58:03] dedication
[58:05] there are a lot listen closely now them
[58:07] allowing what god had blessed them with
[58:10] to become common to them
[58:12] and the presence of god in their life
[58:15] and all of a sudden they begin to get
[58:16] loose
[58:17] before i ever get out my message tonight
[58:20] i want to tell you something you got
[58:22] something that's the greatest thing
[58:24] that's ever struck the face of the earth
[58:26] i know this might be a hard pill to
[58:28] swallow but you're following a ministry
[58:31] tonight that is the greatest ministry
[58:33] that's ever struck the face of the earth
[58:35] i'll go a step further our lord jesus
[58:38] had more success in william branham's
[58:40] ministry than he did his own
[58:43] i didn't say william branham had more
[58:44] success our lord jesus had more success
[58:47] in william brennan's ministry than he
[58:49] did his own
[58:53] that's hard for people to swallow but
[58:55] it's still the truth and if you
[58:57] understood what brother was talking
[58:58] about you would say amen now watch and
[59:01] he also had the greatest vindication of
[59:04] all the prophets from enoch all the way
[59:07] in this day
[59:09] am i right the greatest prophet amen a
[59:12] capstone prophetic ministry and here you
[59:15] and i said tonight by the grace of god
[59:18] under the auspices of that ministry of
[59:20] malachi 4. only i can tell you brothers
[59:24] sister i don't know where i would be
[59:25] tonight if i hadn't been for the grace
[59:27] of god one night down in tifton georgia

[59:32] year old boy a man came at me tonight

[59:53] william branham

[1:01:37] and i'm sitting there looking at all
[1:01:38] these preachers of what in the world and

[1:01:51] ain't no girl gonna be attracted that
[1:01:53] stuff a fella listen to one man's tapes
[1:01:56] you know
[1:01:57] following one man this is tape and
[1:01:59] worshiping birds
[1:02:00] i thought man this is a bird all right
[1:02:03] and what he did he said to me i invited
[1:02:05] you here because i wanted you to listen
[1:02:07] to brother bran and preach
[1:02:10] i thought well okay you know i listened
[1:02:12] to a lot of preachers i said okay he
[1:02:14] gave me brother he didn't give me one
[1:02:16] tape he gave me two part one part two
[1:02:18] both of them 90 minutes apiece
[1:02:20] and it was a message entitled the
[1:02:22] serpent seat
[1:02:25] lord jesus what a way to start it fell
[1:02:27] off
[1:02:28] at least you could have gave my key to
[1:02:30] the door
[1:02:31] something like that something just kind
[1:02:33] of you know just throw a little bit of i
[1:02:35] mean he threw the whole t-bone out there
[1:02:38] but i did always love steak
[1:02:41] and i still do
[1:02:44] people say well you know y'all not eat
[1:02:46] steak it's not healthy and they i see
[1:02:48] these people you know they're
[1:02:49] vegetarians dying like flies
[1:02:52] forget that nonsense
[1:02:54] you know
[1:02:55] i said look i don't know if y'all know
[1:02:57] this but when when melchizedek came to
[1:02:59] abraham they wasn't eating carrots and
[1:03:02] beans
[1:03:04] come on
[1:03:06] they had them a rib eye
[1:03:09] with a cold glass of milk
[1:03:12] that's good eating hey man what we got
[1:03:15] tonight is good meat this is good steak
[1:03:18] right here we got a message a full seven
[1:03:20] course meal tonight we're blessed people
[1:03:23] well i went in the room and i'll get off
[1:03:25] this quick but i went in the room put my
[1:03:26] head on the pill and he gave me it was a
[1:03:29] tape player you know young people back
[1:03:31] then you worked to hear this message you
[1:03:33] had by batteries you make sure you had
[1:03:36] electricity all that kind of stuff we
[1:03:37] got on our phones now just tremendous
[1:03:39] what god did for us but i put that
[1:03:43] tape player upon my pillow laid my head
[1:03:45] on it and listen to him for about an
[1:03:47] hour and thought is this man ever going
[1:03:48] to get to a subject and tell me what
[1:03:50] he's talking about took a long time and
[1:03:53] he was a different type preacher he
[1:03:55] didn't come out there preaching and
[1:03:56] talking tongues preaching talking
[1:03:58] tonight that's what i was used to
[1:04:00] but i'm just kind of talking along there
[1:04:02] but you know brother byler something
[1:04:04] my heart was saying
[1:04:06] that man talks in a way i've never heard
[1:04:08] a man talk before
[1:04:09] he talks like he knows what he's talking
[1:04:11] about
[1:04:12] and when he got finally got into the
[1:04:14] serpent seed and what the original sin
[1:04:16] was
[1:04:17] my old mind started fighting it because
[1:04:20] you know i wasn't taught that way but
[1:04:22] something in my heart was saying you
[1:04:23] know that's makes more sense than
[1:04:24] anything i ever heard
[1:04:26] but i had all my scriptures lined up
[1:04:28] that morning i went in there to that boy
[1:04:30] and he said what did you think
[1:04:33] i said well i have a problem with some
[1:04:35] things
[1:04:36] and i'd give him my thought and he'd
[1:04:38] counteract it and have an answer
[1:04:41] then i'd give him another way to try to
[1:04:43] defeat it he'd give me another answer
[1:04:45] now look that wasn't fair that was a man
[1:04:47] with you know 238s i mean he was loaded
[1:04:51] and i had some butter not trying to
[1:04:52] fight this message
[1:04:54] it wasn't even fair
[1:04:56] finally he just had every answer
[1:04:58] possible and you know now i realize why
[1:05:01] he's been listening these tapes this
[1:05:02] this message you know i and i and i know
[1:05:05] it will brother bowler it'll load your
[1:05:07] head up but tonight i wanted to load our
[1:05:09] hearts up i wanted to just get down in
[1:05:11] there brother cause we're blessed people
[1:05:13] i said all that to say this god brought
[1:05:16] us a long way but he's brought us the
[1:05:18] right way
[1:05:19] and i also want to say this my prayer
[1:05:21] has been for the last 30 some years god
[1:05:24] don't you ever let this message get
[1:05:26] common to me
[1:05:27] let my heart burn with this message
[1:05:30] don't ever let me lose my sincerity
[1:05:32] about what you gave me because
[1:05:34] i'm a blessed man tonight you're a
[1:05:36] blessed people tonight you young people
[1:05:38] blessed to hear this message and the
[1:05:40] thing you want to say is god don't ever
[1:05:42] let me allow this message to ever get
[1:05:45] common to my life
[1:05:50] and it can happen
[1:05:52] it can happen so much
[1:05:54] that brother battle said we can be
[1:05:55] fundamentally right
[1:05:58] and lose our sincerity
[1:06:00] until he said we do we do it out of
[1:06:02] formalism until one place he said it
[1:06:05] becomes a stake in god's nostrils
[1:06:08] that's what
[1:06:10] we want to be careful of now we realize
[1:06:12] israel had got into this
[1:06:14] backstage state the ark of god had been
[1:06:17] taken
[1:06:18] but you know it sounds like a bad
[1:06:20] picture i know
[1:06:21] chapter four it's taken but now
[1:06:24] let me tell you something about the god
[1:06:25] we serve because if i skip chapter five
[1:06:28] and i get over to chapter six
[1:06:31] i will show you that the ark of god
[1:06:34] came back to israel again
[1:06:36] let me tell you why
[1:06:38] he proves to us that god is always a god
[1:06:41] of restoration
[1:06:43] hey brother i've seen people get away
[1:06:44] from god and i've seen god restore them
[1:06:47] back you say well i think they got one
[1:06:49] shot that's why you ain't god and he is
[1:06:53] we don't have a lot of grace for people
[1:06:55] sometimes but god's grace goes further
[1:06:57] you know what it'd be good for us summer
[1:06:59] realize where we see some of y'all god
[1:07:01] kept you you say well i never did smoke
[1:07:04] i never did drink and i and i'm with you
[1:07:06] i hadn't done never done those god kept
[1:07:08] me from that thank the lord for it he
[1:07:10] kept me from but there's some people
[1:07:12] tonight if it hadn't been for the grace
[1:07:14] of god they'd be out on a bar stool
[1:07:16] somewhere somebody'd be strung out on
[1:07:18] drugs somewhere maybe some of you girls
[1:07:19] sitting on a street corner somewhere
[1:07:21] selling your body
[1:07:23] me what be you if it wasn't for the
[1:07:24] grace of god that's what keeps you from
[1:07:27] it but i've seen people get away and
[1:07:28] i've seen god bring them back you say
[1:07:30] well you're telling me god's a god of a
[1:07:32] second chance yeah he's a god of a
[1:07:34] second chance he's a god of a third
[1:07:36] chance he's a god of a fortress and if
[1:07:38] he wouldn't i sure wouldn't be here it's
[1:07:40] his grace that brought me where i'm at
[1:07:42] tonight
[1:07:45] well somebody say praise the lord
[1:07:48] restoration he's a god
[1:07:50] that can restore i talked a little bit
[1:07:52] about it at the end my message last
[1:07:53] night but he is a god that can restore
[1:07:56] and you can't even read the church ages
[1:07:58] without knowing that he's a god that can
[1:08:01] restore
[1:08:02] i will restore saith the lord he not
[1:08:04] only restored his word he restored his
[1:08:07] peoples back to his word
[1:08:09] amen now
[1:08:11] we find what happens is let me get right
[1:08:13] into my message now
[1:08:15] the fourth chapter of the ark is taken
[1:08:18] the sixth chapter
[1:08:20] the ark comes back and israel now is in
[1:08:24] the state of revival
[1:08:27] anytime the word
[1:08:29] and the presence of god comes
[1:08:31] it puts the people back in the state of
[1:08:33] the bible
[1:08:34] i got a few quotes here tonight i won't
[1:08:36] read them all for the sake of time but
[1:08:38] i'll tell you what brother bam says and
[1:08:39] we're without excuses brother bam said
[1:08:41] god and each generation gives every
[1:08:44] generation a chance out of revival
[1:08:48] and he says a chance at his word
[1:08:52] then brother bam said this and this is
[1:08:53] the one up held close to my heart
[1:08:56] brother when i understood what brother
[1:08:57] was preaching matter of fact he preached
[1:08:59] it on my birthday august the 25th
[1:09:02] and a message called one was perfect the
[1:09:04] other one it's called how can i overcome
[1:09:07] brother young people when i saw the
[1:09:09] title that sermon brother man didn't
[1:09:11] preach what can i overcome how can i
[1:09:13] overcome but if i can learn how to
[1:09:15] overcome what doesn't matter no more but
[1:09:18] brother made a statement that message he
[1:09:20] said i chose this because i think this
[1:09:22] time that we
[1:09:24] can never let the spirit of revival die
[1:09:30] we've got to keep in revival
[1:09:34] constantly revived every day
[1:09:37] not just on sunday and wednesday
[1:09:41] not just in youth camps
[1:09:43] you see a lot of you young people go
[1:09:45] back to your churches
[1:09:46] you ought to be just as on fire for god
[1:09:49] at your home churches are you as you are
[1:09:50] in meetings like this
[1:09:53] you ought to worship the lord and sing
[1:09:55] and be willing to play the piano and
[1:09:56] lead the songs and do all these things
[1:09:58] you have to wait for a youth meeting you
[1:10:00] want to beat the youth that's in revival
[1:10:02] everywhere you go
[1:10:04] goddamn said paul said i thought daily
[1:10:07] that christ could live we must never let
[1:10:11] that revival listen now die
[1:10:14] within us
[1:10:16] then broadband another place explains
[1:10:19] what a revival is i'm not into the
[1:10:20] theological part of it knowing that
[1:10:22] revival is sovereign and only god
[1:10:24] considered revival
[1:10:26] but a revival is reviving
[1:10:29] what we already got
[1:10:32] now listen to me
[1:10:33] and see if god will help us tonight to
[1:10:35] understand this
[1:10:37] the problem is people are either living
[1:10:40] in chapter 4
[1:10:43] where the word has
[1:10:44] or they have forsaken the word they have
[1:10:46] compromised in their life
[1:10:48] or you're over in chapter six
[1:10:51] same people but now they're in revival
[1:10:53] because they've allowed the word back
[1:10:55] the spirit's back
[1:10:57] the holy spirit's back the glory is back
[1:10:59] the ark's back
[1:11:01] that's the type of life we want to live
[1:11:03] in
[1:11:04] but here's where the problem is
[1:11:06] between losing the ark
[1:11:09] in chapter four and
[1:11:11] regaining the ark in chapter 5
[1:11:14] of chapter 6
[1:11:16] we have to come to chapter 5.
[1:11:20] listen to me
[1:11:22] chapter 4 they lose the ark
[1:11:24] chapter 6 the ark's restored
[1:11:27] but i want us to follow what happened in
[1:11:29] chapter 5 and from chapter 5
[1:11:33] i would like to preach tonight on the
[1:11:34] subject
[1:11:35] our journey
[1:11:37] to revival
[1:11:40] our journey to revival
[1:11:42] listen to me closely
[1:11:45] wouldn't it be so wonderful tonight
[1:11:47] if every one of you you men got such a
[1:11:50] revival your wife would finally believe
[1:11:52] you're saved
[1:11:56] somebody'll catch that later
[1:11:59] wouldn't that be wonderful
[1:12:00] that everybody around you know something
[1:12:02] happened to your life you know that can
[1:12:04] happen
[1:12:05] you know i can get to the plate you
[1:12:07] don't have to tell people you're saved
[1:12:08] they'll see your life and know something
[1:12:10] happened that man
[1:12:12] the greatest sermon ever preached is one
[1:12:14] that's lived i tell our young people all
[1:12:17] the time
[1:12:18] you ought to preach a sermon every day
[1:12:21] and of necessary used words
[1:12:27] come on your life is a testimony your
[1:12:30] life is the gospel on display
[1:12:34] and when you're in revival oh how the
[1:12:36] glory of god reflects itself through
[1:12:38] your life
[1:12:40] so we see tonight you say can that
[1:12:43] happen oh yes the same holy spirit that
[1:12:45] fell in the day of pentecost is the same
[1:12:47] holy spirit among us tonight
[1:12:49] that same presence that fell down on 120
[1:12:52] fall right in this build of the night
[1:12:54] come in like ways of the holy spirit and
[1:12:56] baptize and you say well i got the holy
[1:12:58] ghost a long time ago well you ought to
[1:13:00] get re-baptized with it again
[1:13:03] you do believe that right one birth many
[1:13:06] outpourings
[1:13:09] what i see about pentecost is not just
[1:13:12] the fact they come out of the upper room
[1:13:15] staggering like a bunch of drunks i like
[1:13:17] that
[1:13:18] i like that wouldn't that be tickling
[1:13:20] the night to see people so drunk on the
[1:13:23] spirit you know that happened a few
[1:13:24] years ago
[1:13:25] can i just take a few minutes and i'd
[1:13:27] tell you something that happened a few
[1:13:28] years ago
[1:13:30] i'm talking about i don't think
[1:13:31] zechariah may have been born yet but i
[1:13:34] about well it was just before we come up
[1:13:36] here back home i kept praying god
[1:13:39] i got a bunch of young people coming up
[1:13:41] and they never been born again they've
[1:13:43] been raised in a message but they never
[1:13:45] met the god the message help me lord how
[1:13:48] can i get them to experience
[1:13:50] finally
[1:13:51] only thing i knew was the way i used to
[1:13:52] do it
[1:13:53] used to just get by myself and i loaded
[1:13:56] my old camper up i headed up to
[1:13:59] beckley west virginia found my little
[1:14:01] campsite there
[1:14:03] got in that campsite done nothing but
[1:14:05] took water for three days i said i'm
[1:14:07] just gonna pray drink water that's why
[1:14:09] we used to do it used to fast 21 days i
[1:14:11] wish i could tell my testimony what
[1:14:13] happened with me shaved my head bald
[1:14:15] headed fasted 40 days trying to find god

[1:14:21] went for like the problem said three
[1:14:23] days is enough
[1:14:25] so i went up for three days just water

[1:17:50] something in your heart and you you know

[1:18:11] lost and the power is restored you've
[1:18:12] got to come through something in chapter
[1:18:14] five

[1:18:19] the holy ghost i started preaching the
[1:18:21] actual experience i took in acts 2 38
[1:18:24] just preaching the promises of god and i
[1:18:26] i i lie not god's my witness and you can
[1:18:29] ask my wife and that's the different
[1:18:31] ones that's in their meetings do you

[1:18:35] kids and put them in vehicles and people
[1:18:37] drive them home we was there past
[1:18:39] midnight they got so some of them got so
[1:18:41] drunk on the spirit they couldn't even
[1:18:43] get to the cards we had to take them to
[1:18:44] their cars because the spirit of god got
[1:18:46] so rich to those meetings i baptized 40
[1:18:49] some young people over that summer amen
[1:18:52] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:18:54] forever we clean these old hearts out
[1:18:56] revival we'll come back to our churches
[1:18:58] and the power and the present god will
[1:19:00] return to our buildings
[1:19:04] let me tell you what happened
[1:19:06] here's what happened
[1:19:07] oh my
[1:19:09] in chapter five
[1:19:11] when
[1:19:12] they took the ark of the covenant it
[1:19:14] visited three cities
[1:19:17] the first city that it came to was a
[1:19:19] city called ash god
[1:19:21] the second city
[1:19:24] it came to was called gaff
[1:19:27] the third city they brought the ark to
[1:19:29] was called ekron
[1:19:31] i want to preach to you for a little bit
[1:19:34] but god's help
[1:19:35] on the journey
[1:19:37] to revival
[1:19:39] the city of ashdod
[1:19:41] the philistines
[1:19:42] you know they
[1:19:44] might have been powerful but they were
[1:19:45] pretty stupid
[1:19:47] they were pretty dumb people and i'll
[1:19:48] tell you why they took the ark of god
[1:19:51] when they got it
[1:19:52] and in the city of ashdod was where the
[1:19:54] temple of dagon was
[1:19:57] and they took the ark of god
[1:19:59] and dagon was the philistine god
[1:20:02] and they took the ark of god into the
[1:20:05] temple of dagon well let me just tell
[1:20:06] you something god's word and god's
[1:20:09] presence don't belong next to idols
[1:20:13] [Music]
[1:20:14] so dagon let me tell you what he was he
[1:20:17] was a stone god
[1:20:21] a stone god let me tell you what it was
[1:20:24] he fit real good in this day he was half
[1:20:26] man and half fish
[1:20:28] we've never lived in a day i saw half
[1:20:30] and half
[1:20:33] sometimes i'm embarrassed i don't know
[1:20:35] if i'm supposed to say yes sir yes ma'am
[1:20:37] half and half
[1:20:40] they say all these pronouns
[1:20:42] him and
[1:20:43] he and she and i said let's just settle
[1:20:45] it we'll just call them shims
[1:20:51] i read the other day
[1:20:53] but the
[1:20:54] mandate for the vaccine i said well no i
[1:20:58] said i'm trans vaccinated
[1:21:03] what's trans-vaccinated i said today i
[1:21:06] identify as vaccinated
[1:21:08] so you have to accept it
[1:21:13] come on now
[1:21:16] i don't mean to be funny but i was in a
[1:21:19] walmart park like my grandson and they
[1:21:21] said boy i gotta go to bathroom pop i
[1:21:22] gotta go to the bathroom i said son get
[1:21:24] out next to that tree right there
[1:21:26] he said pablo i can't do that i'm at
[1:21:29] walmart i said no today you identify as
[1:21:31] a dog
[1:21:44] well y'all still with me say amen
[1:21:47] some of y'all might as well laugh and
[1:21:48] enjoy it
[1:21:50] you know it's funny
[1:21:53] your religion just won't let you laugh
[1:21:54] about that but it's funny i don't care
[1:21:55] what you say
[1:21:59] now this stone god had man have fish was
[1:22:02] the god of fertility that's what they
[1:22:04] believed in their philosophy
[1:22:06] the biggest temple was there and asked
[1:22:08] god it was the temple of dagon now they
[1:22:10] took the ark of god can you imagine they
[1:22:13] take the ark of god they walk it in
[1:22:15] there and they set it right on the
[1:22:16] platform next to their idols
[1:22:21] when they send up there
[1:22:23] got that ark put it up on the pillar got
[1:22:25] their god put up on that pillar
[1:22:28] and the priest thought that's a perfect
[1:22:30] spot for israel's god
[1:22:33] and their god
[1:22:34] what happened well i'll tell you what
[1:22:36] happened the next morning the priest
[1:22:39] woke up
[1:22:41] nobody had visited the temple
[1:22:44] nobody else had been down there
[1:22:46] but the holy ghost
[1:22:48] that accompanies the ark of god was in
[1:22:49] there
[1:22:50] and when the priest walked in that
[1:22:52] temple guess what they found out
[1:22:53] somebody knocked their god off of their
[1:22:56] stool
[1:22:58] so guess what the priest did if i could
[1:23:00] use this for an example the priest had
[1:23:02] to go over there and when they found
[1:23:04] their idol it was laying on the platform
[1:23:08] can you imagine that morning the priest
[1:23:11] had to go over there watch this and pick
[1:23:14] up their god
[1:23:16] and put him back on his stool
[1:23:20] i want you to think about that just for
[1:23:22] a minute
[1:23:23] because
[1:23:25] i'd hate to have a god
[1:23:27] that i had to pack around
[1:23:29] the god we serve we don't have to pack
[1:23:32] him around he packs us around
[1:23:35] come on church that was an idol they had
[1:23:38] to pick their god up moving around and
[1:23:41] set him back up on his idol you know
[1:23:42] what happened the next day the priests
[1:23:45] go back in there
[1:23:47] and all of a sudden they find out
[1:23:49] that their god is back on the ground
[1:23:52] but this time his head's off
[1:23:54] his palms are off his hands are off and
[1:23:58] there's a little nub
[1:24:00] laying on the floor
[1:24:04] now all of a sudden
[1:24:06] dagon
[1:24:08] is not just a god fertility
[1:24:10] he's a handicapped god
[1:24:16] and i'm going to tell y'all something
[1:24:18] our gods are made short
[1:24:20] he's still got power to save
[1:24:23] his ear ain't deaf he can still hear
[1:24:26] he sure ain't dumb he can still speak
[1:24:30] he can still move by his power amen he's
[1:24:33] not limited we're limited but he ain't
[1:24:36] limited we serve an unlimited god
[1:24:38] tonight with unlimited resources
[1:24:45] i'll tell you what happened
[1:24:47] god wasn't satisfied i hope you can get
[1:24:49] read between the lines now god said my
[1:24:51] word and my presence is not going to sit
[1:24:54] next to idols
[1:24:58] let me tell you what
[1:25:00] ashdod means
[1:25:03] it means the city
[1:25:04] of cleansing
[1:25:07] isn't that credible
[1:25:08] the ark had to come through the city of
[1:25:11] cleansing
[1:25:12] what that says to us is god
[1:25:15] shares his glory with nobody
[1:25:19] they were bringing god in
[1:25:21] and erected him in competition to fake
[1:25:23] idols
[1:25:24] and god himself not nobody else god
[1:25:27] himself knocked their idols over
[1:25:30] what's that say to us tonight i'll tell
[1:25:31] you what it is he's either god of
[1:25:34] everything or he's god of nothing
[1:25:38] sometimes we live in this country and i
[1:25:41] don't want to just get in all of it but
[1:25:42] i'll just tell you this i'm gonna set in
[1:25:44] the simplest terms i can tonight
[1:25:46] anything that gives you more joy than
[1:25:48] serving christ can become an idol to
[1:25:50] your life
[1:25:54] i was what a deacon
[1:25:56] the black brother in my church
[1:25:58] used to be the song leader
[1:26:01] he i told this story all over the world
[1:26:03] he knows it so it doesn't bother him not
[1:26:05] tell it but when i first come there he's
[1:26:08] a black brother now
[1:26:10] black folks don't sing out of their nose
[1:26:13] they sing from their hearts
[1:26:16] something happened this guy
[1:26:18] i got in the back room i said man what
[1:26:19] happened to you he said what you mean i
[1:26:21] said
[1:26:23] if you hung around these white people so
[1:26:24] much they stole your soul from you
[1:26:28] i said you sing like you come out of a
[1:26:29] baptist church
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:33] y'all sing song like
[1:26:36] down
[1:26:37] at the cross
[1:26:41] see man that ain't how you sing
[1:26:43] you sing down the cross with some
[1:26:45] feeling to it
[1:26:47] down at the cross
[1:26:49] where my
[1:26:51] brother he said that's just the way we
[1:26:53] sing it around here i said oh he said
[1:26:55] you know by the way but look i'm just
[1:26:57] not an emotional man well i knew better
[1:26:59] than that he had five children so he had
[1:27:01] some kind of emotion
[1:27:07] listen to me we'll get into something
[1:27:09] finally one day i saw him out in the
[1:27:10] parking lot he had his door open and he
[1:27:12] had some music playing and it was the
[1:27:14] music that he liked some of that old
[1:27:16] black gospel and i'm seeing that they're
[1:27:18] doing like this i said oh
[1:27:20] there's that soul it's back
[1:27:25] so he invited me to go down
[1:27:27] to watch a game at clemson university
[1:27:31] now i'm not a clemson fan don't care
[1:27:34] about them they're of the devil i don't
[1:27:36] have nothing to do with them
[1:27:38] i lived in south carolina they perverted
[1:27:40] two of my boys
[1:27:42] got them liking that crazy clemson team
[1:27:44] some say who do you like i said anybody
[1:27:46] playing clemson
[1:27:49] well anyways we went down the basketball
[1:27:50] game now remember i'm with the guy
[1:27:52] that's not emotional
[1:27:54] he's sitting i'm sitting here my wife's
[1:27:55] sitting there
[1:27:57] his wife's there he's there and my wife
[1:27:59] went out really we went out and brought
[1:28:01] orange and purple and got in the spirit
[1:28:03] of the game you know i didn't pack my
[1:28:04] bible to the basketball game
[1:28:06] it's ridiculous
[1:28:08] people take spoken word books at a
[1:28:10] baseball game then you're there to enjoy
[1:28:12] a baseball game lay the book down
[1:28:18] come on you get in the spirit of what
[1:28:19] you do right
[1:28:21] well if you get the spirit of balkan you
[1:28:22] can spirit the house of god
[1:28:25] so we were sitting there and clemson was
[1:28:27] down and one of them boys got the ball
[1:28:29] you know he was dribbling down the court
[1:28:31] got that in a man he booked a jump and
[1:28:33] he dunked that ball you know brother
[1:28:35] rudy over there
[1:28:36] son this guy ain't emotional
[1:28:39] my wife can tell you he come off the
[1:28:40] floor about that high
[1:28:42] whoa
[1:28:44] i said oh
[1:28:45] man you're in trouble now he said what
[1:28:47] is it i said you told me you wasn't
[1:28:49] emotional about like i talked about my
[1:28:50] boy last night i said if you could do
[1:28:52] that at a football basketball game over
[1:28:54] a pit something made out of leather how
[1:28:56] much more you ought to be able to shout
[1:28:58] and praise god over salvation amen that
[1:29:00] was paid by the blood of the lord jesus
[1:29:02] christ
[1:29:05] come on i know what i'm talking about
[1:29:08] but you see
[1:29:09] [Applause]
[1:29:11] when you allow an idol
[1:29:14] to rob god of the priority of being
[1:29:17] first in your life
[1:29:19] it becomes an idol to you to be honest
[1:29:22] with you
[1:29:23] some things are not sin they just are
[1:29:24] weights
[1:29:26] that can weigh us down from selling out
[1:29:29] and giving god our all
[1:29:32] amen
[1:29:34] brother baptism said he remembers
[1:29:35] preaching the raw heathens
[1:29:36] he said with any of them raw he the raw
[1:29:39] heathens now we're all heathens once
[1:29:41] gave their life to the lord jesus
[1:29:43] brother said the first thing they did
[1:29:45] was took their idols and thrown them
[1:29:46] down
[1:29:48] you know why because that spirit got in
[1:29:50] and behold these ghosts got in them they
[1:29:52] knew there wasn't no room for this idol
[1:29:54] and the holy ghost at the same time so
[1:29:56] they threw their idols down wouldn't it
[1:29:58] be good tonight if a cleansing power
[1:30:00] would come to this building and every
[1:30:02] young person say hey ain't nothing my
[1:30:04] life taken the place of the holy ghost
[1:30:05] i've opened up giving god full right and
[1:30:08] i throw down everything that's an idol
[1:30:10] to the holy spirit
[1:30:13] we've got to the
[1:30:14] place in america we make sports stars a
[1:30:18] bunch of fornicating
[1:30:21] adultery
[1:30:22] money-loving

[1:30:48] daughter you ain't hanging sports stars

[1:31:31] the holy ghost and you it'll pluck the
[1:31:32] way every word of god with an amen
[1:31:35] now you're going to get quiet on it but
[1:31:36] it's still right
[1:31:40] we we've took and made god you know get
[1:31:43] like brother william here god's gifted
[1:31:45] you the gift the sin you've got a
[1:31:47] tremendous ability to sing that's a
[1:31:48] wonderful gift to have god bless you you
[1:31:51] young people sister playing piano god's
[1:31:53] gift to you that's that's wonderful but
[1:31:55] you always want to keep that gift in
[1:31:57] control of the holy spirit
[1:32:00] because the world tried to take that and
[1:32:03] take it and pervert it i've seen young
[1:32:05] little innocent kids i'm talking about
[1:32:08] 12-year-old kids that could sing like
[1:32:10] angels
[1:32:13] and they put them on american idol
[1:32:18] god gifted them i believe all them gifts
[1:32:20] come from god right that's an elvis's
[1:32:22] gift came from god but he sorted out
[1:32:26] he said he sold it out like judah
[1:32:28] students sold out for 30 pieces of
[1:32:30] silver elba sold out for 30 cadillacs
[1:32:33] sent souls to hell nothing said i know
[1:32:36] his mother i know his pastor and he said
[1:32:38] he's a young man with a holy baptist
[1:32:40] with the holy ghost and then turned
[1:32:41] around and said he's a devil standing in
[1:32:43] shoe leather
[1:32:47] but took that gift that god gave him and
[1:32:49] used it wrong
[1:32:51] and guess what happens they make it
[1:32:52] today elvis presley's still an idol
[1:32:59] that's right
[1:33:00] they took 12 year old girl i've seen a
[1:33:02] beautiful little girl couldn't sing like
[1:33:04] you wouldn't believe innocent come out
[1:33:06] there with a little dress on look just
[1:33:08] like a pretty little girl
[1:33:10] i thought man what a little girl
[1:33:12] do you know she's about 17 18 a day
[1:33:15] got her hair shaved on one side all
[1:33:17] purple got earrings hanging off dressed
[1:33:20] weird you see what the devil done
[1:33:23] you see what that crowd will do to you
[1:33:25] turn around made an idol out of her
[1:33:27] and then took a gift that she could have
[1:33:29] blessed god's people with and turn
[1:33:32] around sold it out for wealth and
[1:33:33] popularity and money
[1:33:36] and destroyed her life
[1:33:40] god
[1:33:41] gets offended at idols
[1:33:44] that we allow to come
[1:33:46] and until we allow permit
[1:33:49] the holy ghost to come glory and knock
[1:33:52] those idols down and chop them up break
[1:33:54] them up and to storm out our lives it's
[1:33:57] then when that happens that the holy
[1:33:59] ghost comes in and your light becomes
[1:34:01] overflowing with the spirit of god
[1:34:03] wouldn't it be good as the old psalm
[1:34:05] says i'm so full my cup so full it's
[1:34:07] running over and i have to drink from
[1:34:09] the saucer i'm so filled and i believe
[1:34:12] every man and woman every boy during the
[1:34:13] night can be so filled the spirit of god
[1:34:15] that your life can be overflowing with
[1:34:17] this presence
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:21] the city of cleansing
[1:34:23] city of cleansing
[1:34:25] let me go on because i gotta go quick i
[1:34:28] gotta bypass a few things here tonight
[1:34:30] but we live in a pleasure
[1:34:32] stricken age
[1:34:35] it's the truth i know it is
[1:34:37] you know
[1:34:38] they're gone they're gone
[1:34:41] god you remember samson
[1:34:43] you know what the prophet said about him
[1:34:46] remember where a secret of his power
[1:34:48] laid
[1:34:49] and compared to secretary's power and he
[1:34:51] compared it to the church and its
[1:34:52] condition
[1:34:54] and then his head finally laid down in
[1:34:56] the lap of the delilah had one problem
[1:35:00] attracted to beautiful women
[1:35:03] end up selling this gift out
[1:35:05] told the secrets power
[1:35:07] you know what happened the spirit of god
[1:35:10] departed
[1:35:11] brother i couldn't think tonight of
[1:35:13] anything worse
[1:35:15] than to have the spirit of god depart
[1:35:16] from us
[1:35:18] honestly i don't want to go today now i
[1:35:21] know i get to the place where the word
[1:35:23] of god so anchored in this even when i
[1:35:25] don't feel god i believe in many ways
[1:35:27] because i don't live my life by feeling
[1:35:29] but it's you're going to feel god ain't
[1:35:30] it you're going to feel something in
[1:35:32] your heart i it's all i believe get all
[1:35:35] over us filled with our hands feeling
[1:35:36] our feet that's what makes us dance and
[1:35:38] shout but sometimes it ain't that way
[1:35:41] and you just got to anger back god said
[1:35:43] it i believe it even if i don't feel it
[1:35:45] i still believe it
[1:35:48] what happened to samson
[1:35:50] lost his power
[1:35:51] can i tell you where they brought him to
[1:35:55] brought him down to the temple of

[1:41:36] and you fail god you make some of the
[1:41:38] greatest mistakes
[1:41:40] people will never remember what you did
[1:41:42] throughout life they'll only remember
[1:41:43] how you ended life
[1:41:47] so i said if we gonna finish
[1:41:49] let's finish strong
[1:41:51] hey when i check out this world i told
[1:41:54] my boys got six of them i said when
[1:41:55] y'all come in with my daughter and y'all
[1:41:57] come around my bed i don't want y'all
[1:41:59] coming and praying crying over me i want
[1:42:01] me to take my hands put them up on you
[1:42:03] and bless you as i'm checking out of
[1:42:05] this world hey you don't have to feel
[1:42:07] sorry for me i'm going where i preached
[1:42:10] about i talked about
[1:42:12] there's a body waiting on me hallelujah
[1:42:14] that's the way we got to believe it
[1:42:15] there's nothing this world compares what
[1:42:18] we have in christ
[1:42:20] all right let me move on
[1:42:22] cleansing
[1:42:23] we got to come through cleansing we got
[1:42:24] to be cleaned out i'm hurrying give me
[1:42:27] ten more minutes listen
[1:42:28] next place in chapter five they came to
[1:42:31] the ark came to it left ashdod and came
[1:42:34] to the city of gath
[1:42:37] the city of geth is amazing it's not
[1:42:38] cleansing now but it means the city of
[1:42:41] crushing
[1:42:43] so god not only brought it through the
[1:42:45] cleansing but it's got to come to the
[1:42:47] crushing and listen to this and death is
[1:42:49] where you find
[1:42:51] the city of the winepress
[1:42:54] you go down to the wine press and the
[1:42:56] wine press is where they put the grapes
[1:42:58] in there and they stop the grapes and
[1:43:00] they crush it when they stopped it it
[1:43:02] brought forth grape juice and then
[1:43:04] ultimately brought forth wine which was
[1:43:06] a type of joy stimulation
[1:43:09] or i could preach for hours on this
[1:43:11] stuff
[1:43:12] here's my question you might be willing
[1:43:13] to be cleansed but you will tonight to
[1:43:15] be crushed
[1:43:17] are you willing to god take you down
[1:43:18] there and crush you
[1:43:20] crush your life
[1:43:21] where he can break you down so much and
[1:43:23] he can crush you until the
[1:43:25] something's pressed out of you that's
[1:43:27] greater than you and the presence of god
[1:43:29] has pressed out you as i said last night
[1:43:31] it's not raw wheat but god makes bread
[1:43:33] out of you where you not only can be
[1:43:35] blessed by what god does for you but
[1:43:38] others can have that that blessing can
[1:43:40] overflow and others can be blessed by
[1:43:42] your life
[1:43:46] what is it
[1:43:47] well i'll ask you this way are you
[1:43:49] willing to be hurt that others might be
[1:43:50] helped
[1:43:53] think about a spirit-filled living is a
[1:43:55] life where self
[1:43:58] is not involved
[1:44:02] what you have inside might be life
[1:44:05] but it
[1:44:06] goes out
[1:44:09] you've got it coming in the watch if
[1:44:11] you've got it coming in but ain't
[1:44:12] nothing going out
[1:44:14] what happens to it
[1:44:16] becomes stagnated
[1:44:19] like the prophet said
[1:44:21] a sister
[1:44:23] a broken sister
[1:44:25] huh
[1:44:27] brother batman said that day at calvary
[1:44:29] what must we do well the first thing i
[1:44:31] want to say is jesus never lived for
[1:44:34] himself
[1:44:36] he
[1:44:37] his life was spent for others that's
[1:44:39] perfectly eternal life when you say you
[1:44:41] go to church and you do good things
[1:44:43] that's fine but when you live your life
[1:44:45] to yourself you haven't got eternal life
[1:44:47] eternal life is living for others do you
[1:44:49] know where brother branham said jesus
[1:44:52] finally
[1:44:53] you said oh he did it at calvary no no
[1:44:55] brother madam said he defeated him
[1:44:58] at the garden of gethsemane
[1:45:02] gethsemane
[1:45:04] there means oil press
[1:45:07] brother adam said satan's eating jesus
[1:45:09] fought it out was saved in the garden of
[1:45:11] gethsemane he won back the eden
[1:45:14] which he's going to prepare in heaven to
[1:45:16] return again
[1:45:19] when he was there he prayed
[1:45:22] listen the only place the bible ever
[1:45:23] said he sweated
[1:45:25] only place a scripture he's out in boats
[1:45:27] nothing ever talks about a sweat until
[1:45:30] he's being pressed
[1:45:32] if you trace it back go back to the
[1:45:34] garden of eden
[1:45:35] sweat was a sign of the curse
[1:45:38] when the sweater thou browed he told
[1:45:39] adam
[1:45:40] you bring forth sweat was a symbol of
[1:45:43] the curse
[1:45:44] you can imagine when he was down there
[1:45:46] and guarding yosemite prayed until his
[1:45:48] sweat
[1:45:50] you can see the demon say oh i knew i
[1:45:53] knew he had to curse on it i knew he
[1:45:55] wasn't who they say was but all of a
[1:45:57] sudden they looked and they noticed that
[1:45:59] his sweat became
[1:46:01] as great drops
[1:46:03] of blood
[1:46:06] he sweated out
[1:46:08] and great drops of blood you know god
[1:46:10] was saying
[1:46:12] he's not cursed god was telling the
[1:46:14] world this is my son he's not a sinner
[1:46:17] he's my son
[1:46:19] he came to save sinners
[1:46:21] say yeah but that's jesus no that's what
[1:46:24] them said said he died to reveal himself
[1:46:26] to us
[1:46:28] now let us die to self
[1:46:31] to reveal him to others
[1:46:34] let us die to traditions and things to
[1:46:37] reveal another dying denomination to
[1:46:39] reveal him to others so not only do i
[1:46:42] want to be cleansed
[1:46:43] i want god to crush me
[1:46:45] whatever it takes lord whatever it takes
[1:46:48] for my life to be so you whatever you've
[1:46:50] got to put me through that others can
[1:46:52] see christ
[1:46:54] here i am lord
[1:46:56] i'm willing lord
[1:46:58] whatever it takes to produce that spirit
[1:47:00] of revival in me here i am lord
[1:47:03] let me give you one more city because it
[1:47:05] came to a third city the third city came
[1:47:07] to was called ekron
[1:47:10] ashdod
[1:47:11] come from ashdon gath
[1:47:14] and then came to
[1:47:16] ekron ekron was not cleansing it was not
[1:47:20] crushing
[1:47:22] it means the city of commitment
[1:47:25] so god not only cleanses us he not only
[1:47:28] crushes us but he wants to see
[1:47:30] commitment out of us
[1:47:32] now listen to me closely equiron
[1:47:35] literally means immigration or torn up
[1:47:39] by the roots
[1:47:41] what's that what's that saying to us
[1:47:43] well i'll tell you what it is god wants
[1:47:45] to cleanse you he wants to crush you but
[1:47:47] in the crushing
[1:47:49] he wants to pull everything out of you
[1:47:51] let's not like him
[1:47:54] and what we do when i was a boy
[1:47:56] about nine ten years old
[1:47:59] let me have your attention just for a
[1:48:00] couple more minutes about 10 years old i
[1:48:03] had a cousin
[1:48:04] his name was yoki
[1:48:06] real name was timothy you can look him
[1:48:08] up he's been in prison for 20 some years
[1:48:12] time he was 18 he's well longer than
[1:48:14] that 18 he went in but he got out for
[1:48:16] about a couple years and then went back
[1:48:18] he lived most of his life in prison
[1:48:21] he was my close relation when i gave my
[1:48:23] heart to the lord at 13 we kind of
[1:48:25] started parting ways
[1:48:27] he became a thief he stole when i was
[1:48:29] with him
[1:48:30] and i say brother you still not really
[1:48:33] but i was just as guilty because i
[1:48:34] enjoyed what he stole
[1:48:38] you know what i mean
[1:48:40] i'm just i'm just guilty the only thing
[1:48:42] was i had a daddy at home was about six
[1:48:44] one weighed about 260 pounds
[1:48:47] there wasn't a fear of god that kept me
[1:48:48] from stealing it was the fear of charles
[1:48:50] gibson
[1:48:52] because remember last night i had a
[1:48:53] momma that seemed that she knowed
[1:48:55] everything i'd done
[1:48:56] and i figured she found out we were
[1:48:58] stealing then guess what i had to deal
[1:49:00] with daddy
[1:49:02] that's a big man
[1:49:03] when he used to whip me brother i used
[1:49:05] to run around him like this and he gets
[1:49:07] so angry he gets stand still
[1:49:12] and i'd hear him say son i wouldn't do
[1:49:15] this if i didn't love you and there's a
[1:49:17] boy i'd say well daddy hate me a while
[1:49:23] oh it made him so mad one time when he
[1:49:25] said
[1:49:26] as much as it hurt you i said daddy i
[1:49:28] don't believe that give me that belt and
[1:49:30] then we'll see if it hurts you as much
[1:49:32] as it hurts me boy i got a double
[1:49:34] whooping that night
[1:49:37] he laid me over the bed he put his leg
[1:49:39] over my legs like that boom boy he wore
[1:49:42] me you know every time he whooped me he
[1:49:44] told me he said your brains are born
[1:49:46] right down in this area he said the more
[1:49:48] i whip you the further the brains go up
[1:49:51] and the smarter you get
[1:49:57] he was right
[1:49:59] he was right because it seemed like he
[1:50:00] didn't take a whole lot of whoopings
[1:50:02] from him to smart me
[1:50:04] up
[1:50:06] i'd have fear of him and i did and it
[1:50:08] was a it was a good fear not a fear my
[1:50:11] dad was loving man but it was a good
[1:50:12] fear
[1:50:13] it was a good fear that kept me from a
[1:50:15] lot of stuff but anyway me and my cousin
[1:50:17] we had about 12 or 13 lawns
[1:50:20] you know we cut grass that's what we did
[1:50:23] i love cutting i still cut grass today
[1:50:25] because my boys are too lazy to do it i
[1:50:26] cut grass
[1:50:28] and
[1:50:29] it's one thing i enjoy because i can do
[1:50:31] it and look back and see what i
[1:50:32] accomplished i said he's not like
[1:50:34] passing a church
[1:50:35] you can't look back sometimes see what
[1:50:37] your cop takes a lot of years but i cut
[1:50:39] graphically but i did a pretty good job
[1:50:40] on that
[1:50:41] i like straight lines i like to look
[1:50:43] right one way is my cousin he's a
[1:50:45] shyster
[1:50:46] and so this old lady she's about 80
[1:50:48] years old in florida everything's
[1:50:50] beautiful florida is all built with
[1:50:51] sidewalks i love it because you get out
[1:50:53] ride your bikes and you know now you
[1:50:55] gotta you know in the country
[1:50:58] you came right down you can't walk the
[1:50:59] streets no more because these
[1:51:00] knuckleheads driving cars staring at
[1:51:02] fools
[1:51:04] you might get hit
[1:51:06] but florida we had these sidewalks so
[1:51:08] this old lady we cut her grass she said
[1:51:10] hey boys
[1:51:11] would y'all do me a favor said yes ma'am
[1:51:13] so what would y'all charge me to pull
[1:51:16] in between the sidewalk the grass that's
[1:51:18] growing my cousin he was the money man
[1:51:20] 20
[1:51:22] she said okay that'd be worth it well i
[1:51:24] ran home with i just lived in tree and i
[1:51:26] got one
[1:51:27] snuck in and got one of mama's butter
[1:51:29] knives
[1:51:30] and what i was going to do is take them
[1:51:31] butter knives and go in between and
[1:51:32] crack and dig until i got down and got
[1:51:35] the root well i i was doing it yogi
[1:51:37] comes hey what are you doing
[1:51:39] i said man i'm digging
[1:51:41] the roots out
[1:51:43] don't do that
[1:51:45] i said well i didn't know no different
[1:51:46] he said don't just take it and cut
[1:51:49] right off you can't see the grass
[1:51:54] i said well she's paying us to get rid
[1:51:56] of she said he said no if you dig the
[1:51:58] route up we won't get paid next year
[1:52:05] he was right
[1:52:06] because if i got the root that would
[1:52:08] have been no more problem
[1:52:09] he didn't want me to get the root he was
[1:52:12] he was smooth man
[1:52:13] he felt a little different what i
[1:52:15] thought and i said well all right i did
[1:52:17] what he said i didn't get you know what
[1:52:19] we had that job again then we had that
[1:52:21] job again and we had that job again
[1:52:24] because i wasn't getting the root so
[1:52:25] what god does look we got to get down
[1:52:28] there he's got to not just cut them
[1:52:30] things off he's got to get down in the
[1:52:32] end and root them things out of us hey
[1:52:34] if there's unforgiveness you got to get
[1:52:36] rooted out if somebody's offended and
[1:52:38] you're feeling toward them you've got to
[1:52:40] get it rooted out you've got to let the
[1:52:42] holy ghost come down take that thing out
[1:52:44] of you hey brother i'll just tell you
[1:52:46] what brother branham said and i and i
[1:52:48] cannot tell you i've always been there i
[1:52:50] had a guy one time come to our church
[1:52:53] brother before you meet with people have
[1:52:55] a good old-fashioned prayer meeting
[1:52:56] because you don't know what spirit that
[1:52:58] rascal's coming in
[1:53:00] i had a prayer meeting i had to meet
[1:53:02] with this guy he had a problem with my
[1:53:03] church
[1:53:04] so finally we met
[1:53:06] i just prayed and i prayed for him and
[1:53:08] he come in there and he said i like your
[1:53:09] drums
[1:53:11] i don't like your guitars
[1:53:13] your music's of the devil he just
[1:53:14] started telling me now everything's
[1:53:16] wrong brother my heart was just so
[1:53:19] happy i shook his hand said well god
[1:53:21] bless you brother i love you anyway i
[1:53:23] quit the church i said i still love you
[1:53:26] you know this day i still love you
[1:53:29] because brother branham said you ought
[1:53:31] to be able to bitterly brother tell what
[1:53:33] you say people ain't there
[1:53:35] he said but you ought to be able to
[1:53:37] bitterly disagree with a man
[1:53:39] and still love him just the same
[1:53:43] i could stop right there tonight this
[1:53:45] order could fill up with every one of
[1:53:47] them so saying lord i don't know if i'm
[1:53:49] there but if i'm not reach in there and
[1:53:51] root that thing out of me
[1:53:52] when i when i have deadly disagreements
[1:53:55] maybe i don't like the way somebody does
[1:53:56] something i don't like what they said
[1:53:58] you know hey you got to have tough skin
[1:54:00] to go to message church
[1:54:04] but there's people there are i believe
[1:54:06] in a six-fold ministry
[1:54:09] right you got the five-fold and there's
[1:54:11] always one more fold in the church
[1:54:13] that's going to prove whether people got
[1:54:14] the holy ghost or not
[1:54:16] they're the ones that just rub you the
[1:54:18] wrong way
[1:54:21] and sometimes
[1:54:23] i'm almost done i got to go i know
[1:54:26] sometimes it's
[1:54:27] the irritation like the old yeah y'all
[1:54:29] ever studied the pearl how it's formed
[1:54:32] the oyster that grain of sand gets an
[1:54:34] irritates it you know you know how that
[1:54:36] happens your sister and your brother
[1:54:38] irritate you
[1:54:39] i mean did it seem like you're ordained
[1:54:41] to god to irritate
[1:54:44] some people just predestinated to be a
[1:54:46] thorn in the flesh
[1:54:48] huh
[1:54:51] y'all thinking of somebody right now
[1:54:55] it just seemed like god sent him to be
[1:54:58] troubled
[1:54:59] but you know what
[1:55:01] that irritation causes that oyster to
[1:55:03] shoot out a solution it goes around that
[1:55:05] irritation
[1:55:06] and that irritation
[1:55:08] is forming a pearl
[1:55:10] and in you tonight
[1:55:12] there's a pearl being formed in you
[1:55:14] god let certain things happen if you'll
[1:55:16] surrender the holy spirit that solution
[1:55:18] that down on the inside like that dove
[1:55:20] just cleaned you keep forming you
[1:55:23] but you got to let god do it
[1:55:25] i wish i had more time to go this these
[1:55:26] roots you can read that but about the
[1:55:28] root of bitterness you can read about it
[1:55:30] but told us in the in the in the uh in
[1:55:33] the word to the church christ the
[1:55:35] mystery god revealed he tells it there
[1:55:37] he tells us
[1:55:38] even how god wants to do exceedingly
[1:55:40] abundantly he speaks about it he said
[1:55:42] but what we got to do is prepare our
[1:55:44] hearts break up the ground get all the
[1:55:46] grub out and the green briars and the
[1:55:48] stickers and the thorns and the roots of
[1:55:50] business and bring down the holy spirit
[1:55:52] so that the anger of god might sweep
[1:55:54] over this building in a great meeting
[1:55:57] say well that's back there no that's
[1:55:59] right here tonight
[1:56:00] that same angel that vindicate that
[1:56:03] ministry is the same angel that still
[1:56:05] accompanies this message
[1:56:07] that same holy spirit that would fall
[1:56:09] over the audience is the same holy
[1:56:11] spirit that fought over this audience
[1:56:14] you give me a people that'll sell out
[1:56:16] let god bring you through the cleansing
[1:56:18] let god bring you to the crushing let
[1:56:20] god be that place of commitment where
[1:56:22] you'll sell out and say lord take out of
[1:56:24] everything everything out of me like i
[1:56:26] said when when god gave a man the holy
[1:56:28] spirit he set his face toward calvary
[1:56:31] and the word before him little roots
[1:56:34] rise up from off the that highway come
[1:56:37] up wrap around that tree and you think

[2:00:26] yourself with paul saying i'm crucified
[2:00:28] with christ
[2:00:29] nevertheless i live
[2:00:32] yet not i
[2:00:33] but christ that liveth in me
[2:00:35] and the life i now live in the flesh
[2:00:38] i live
[2:00:39] of faith the revelation of the son of
[2:00:41] god who loved me
[2:00:43] and gave himself for me
[2:00:45] then you'll find after it came to them
[2:00:47] three cities
[2:00:49] the ark was restored back
[2:00:51] to the children of israel
[2:00:52] and the shout of the king was in the
[2:00:55] camp
[2:00:56] i don't care what nobody tells you you
[2:00:58] don't have to wait for a revival to have
[2:01:00] revival
[2:01:03] the preacher don't have to come and un
[2:01:06] open this briefcase and revival pops out
[2:01:11] we can be in revival
[2:01:13] like when they back in england you
[2:01:15] remember they come and ask the policeman
[2:01:17] where's the welsh revival he didn't
[2:01:19] point down to some church down the road
[2:01:21] he didn't point to the building he said
[2:01:23] you're looking at it
[2:01:24] i am the wealth revival
[2:01:27] brother i'm going to say it like this in
[2:01:28] closing if there's a revival to follow
[2:01:30] my
[2:01:31] type force ministry you're it you're the
[2:01:34] malachi for revival you're watching this
[2:01:36] is what this is what this message
[2:01:38] produces
[2:01:44] people never pick up a message book or
[2:01:47] play a tape of brother branham's the
[2:01:50] question is tonight
[2:01:51] young people
[2:01:52] could they look at your life
[2:01:54] and you'll be a representative
[2:01:56] of the very gospel that brother branham
[2:01:58] preached and it got vindicated
[2:02:01] let's buy our heads tonight as musicians
[2:02:03] come please

[2:02:32] moment

[2:02:46] something that i know
[2:02:48] is hindering me from really really
[2:02:50] living in that revival spirit
[2:02:54] maybe there's something i've held
[2:02:55] against somebody that i shouldn't make
[2:02:57] it right
[2:02:59] i expect to spend eternity with them why
[2:03:01] can i live in the house of god with them
