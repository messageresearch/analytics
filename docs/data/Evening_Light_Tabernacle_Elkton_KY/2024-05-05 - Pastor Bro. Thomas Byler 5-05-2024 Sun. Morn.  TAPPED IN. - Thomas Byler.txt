upright conversation a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many Wicked the Lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be forever but the wicked Shall Perish and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they consume away for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of

want Fellowship amen and then brother Brad will be ministering this evening so we're certainly looking forward to what the Lord will have amen by the way of our brother amen appreciate him amen let's just bow our heads and approach the author of the book before we open it Lord Jesus we are so grateful father to Know You Lord and Lord we do remember the time and the place and the day God that Lord we come into contact with you and you talked to us and draw us to yourself father we just will never forget that day Lord and we just ask God that you would just bless the meditation of our heart that which we feel you've laid upon my heart to speak this morning we just want to follow your spirit God and say what your Holy Spirit wants to say to the church this morning and we pray God that this word father that you have for the church this morning would Lodge in every heart and Lord Jesus and bring forth a h hundredfold and that we might go from here better people than what we've come Lord we love you and we just pray father that You' just be with every portion of the service and fellow Fellowship in the service this evening bless this day father as we enjoy it in you now in Jesus name amen and amen so I couldn't really get away from just a little thought amen I uh uh felt like the Lord just laid a little thought on my heart about being tapped into God Amen being tapped in so I titled it tapped in amen amen so if you will we'll just get into the word amen I'm going to see here I don't think I've got any other announcements wrote down here amen thank I want to thank everybody also I know that after or in between Services you know when we uh have a service at 2:30 sometimes it's we have to qu try to quickly clean things up and so forth so we do appreciate everybody's help down at the fellowship hall and getting things cleaned up once everybody's done eating amen so praise the Lord turn your bibles if you will to the book of um Matthew amen I might read read several scriptures just to kind of get my Foundation laid down and I do appreciate the song that Brother David sang there amen I'm pressing on the upward Way New Height I'm gaining every day still praying as I'm onward B bound Lord plant my feet on higher ground amen how many believ that as we get on down the road and as the world gets wickeder amen the Church of Jesus Christ is getting closer to him if we're not moving to WS him on a daily basis then there's something wrong with us amen we should be constantly getting closer and closer to God and I'll show you how that kind of happens amen um with the help of the lord we know one of them is through to five-fold Ministry amen that he gave to some Apostles prophets and so forth amen but we'll read that scripture let's go to Matthew amen and verse let's go with Matthew let me see what what I got here five Matthew 5 of course Jesus talking about loving your enemy blessing them that curse you and so forth doing good to them that hate you praying for them that despitefully use you in verse 44 and persecute you verse 45 that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not the publicans also he's do not also the do not even the publicans so be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen you know that's a scary word isn't it I think that's a scary word for us human beings that are so imperfect amen that God tells us that he asks us to be perfect amen amen so it's quite something but let's look at that for just a little bit longer a little bit more over in Ephesians I believe is the next one Ephesians 4 I'm going read about four scriptures and then I'll just have a couple of them left over Ephesians 4 verse 10 he that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ and that's as far as we'll go there let's go over to um Ephesians the next page probably on your Bible Ephesians 5 Ephesians 5 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish amen sounds like perfect to me don't it you second Peter one more scripture second Peter 3 verse 11 seeing then that all the things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for the Hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent be diligent that's what we're doing this morning trying to be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless wow be God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen y'all are very attentive most of you didn't even sit until I said be seated so amen praise the Lord God is good amen so I thought about what brother brandham had said said about how that we uh have how many many believes we have untapped resources the sources that we've never even been tapped into that's the way man is today now notice and he was talking about a crow that had been tied up and a man came by and let him go turned him loose amen all of his fellow crows came by and said come on Johnny Crow you're loose come on with us and so forth and he says I can't I can't he got to the place where he just thought he was tied up and couldn't go even though he was free ain't that right and that's the way man is today you don't know that Jesus Christ made you free brother let's get out of it let's get somewhere God made us free don't starve to death God's got Pentecostal blessings all through the skies and unta resources of his goodness let's go get it whosoever will let him come in another couple quotes in that same kind of a phrase he says that you know that we're living a million miles below our privileges amen it's amazing how that brother banon would you know I mean you know we as preachers sometimes have a tendency to go a little extreme and he makes the statement a million miles that's a pretty long ways if you ask me that the church at that time oh my can I just say what comes to mind you know it's something that I don't remember brother brandham saying too much about not a church is up to what where it ought to be I don't he hear that a whole lot Amen brother bam talked about the Pentecostals getting off and if they keep getting off the way that they are they'll be further than the Catholics in 20 years ain't that right but how many believes that the bride the people that are going to meet the Lord in the air amen they're not going to be living below their privileges no they're not not they're going to come up to what God has for them because it's in them to do it because God has put that in them to do it amen praise the Lord listen to this and it's a simple way God doesn't make things complicated to uh with so many rosaries and many this and join this and education and theology he says why we get ourselves further away from God all the time by doing so today we're so scientific till he says that we can uh uh tell how many molecules that it takes to make an atom and how many electrons and so forth and split that atom amen how many knows remember when they created the atom bomb remember the city they built and all that went into trying to make that atomic bomb ain't that right how to split an atom man can go all the way to splitting an atom man has advanced greatly amen and I don't from what I understand they can even clone things now amen I didn't do much study into it but uh you know just that they can take a life I guess and make another life from it that's pretty amazing that's next to creating life how many knows I'm sure that they had to take some form of life that was there already is that right amen and then perhaps just clone that life cuz they can't make life they can't create life only God can create life he is he is life amen so listen to what he says and you can tell and tell you how it's done and man- make an atomic bomb but then we can uh he says we can explain how it's done but we walk over a blade of grass and we cannot explain it how many remember brother B talking many times how that we can shoot people to the Moon we can you know have these talk about the stars and all those things but we how did he put it walk over a blade of grass we walk right over a blade of grass and we don't really realize what we're walking over we can't explain the grass that we walk over amen because brother brandom I think you all know that the definition of what he tried to get to us was that it takes God in that blade of grass to grow amen it might not be sound too exciting but that's exciting to me because if you remember brother Brandon apple tree one time to convert a Infidel when that Infidel neighbor amen had been raised from cancer and healed from cancer isn't that right and he'd like to meet that one preacher that perhaps wasn't a lion dog he wanted to meet that unlying dog so to speak you know because he was interested in it and of course brother Brandon pushed him a little ah you don't mean that she actually was healed yeah she was if you don't believe it go over there with me and I'll show you he said I had him preaching to me now Glory ain't that right why because of that you know and so forth and he says I sure like to meet him he says well I'll tell you you know and he got to ask him what intelligence tells that s app in your tree that you planted so many years ago what intelligence what power tells that sap to go down into the tree he well well that's just nature and this that or the other he saids no it's not why don't I put a bucket of water up on the post amen see if it goes down to you and to me that sounds completely ridiculous isn't that right but that's about what churches and people do nowadays they put water on the post thinking hey somehow it's going to work you don't it don't work unless you come God's way we got to remember that about our life is that nothing in our life is going to work unless you come God's way amen and that intelligence that same blade of grass how many knows amen it's God growing and pushing that out and so forth how many could say this morning I want to tell you I know that life you know that life you've been tapped into that life and that life is God Almighty wo we F so many discontented people nowadays but I want you to understand that a Christian amen he's not tossed here and there amen he hasn't tossed with every wind that comes along every problem and everything that comes why because we should have a daily walk with almighty God we've been tapped into that tap of unre oh untapped resource but you are tapped de woo are you ready this morning how many beli this morning you have been tapped in amen it is not untapped anymore somebody has untapped into it where all things are possible to them that believe amen praise the Lord didn't mean to get to preaching I want to do a little teaching here first amen all right but I thought my you walk over a blade of grass oh my might as well go on Amen I'm here to tell you that's the same power that tells all those trees out there to go down and the fall how many believe it's the same power that tells them to come up again it's the same power that's going to say all rise it's the same power that's going to resurrect the Dead it's the same power I'm glad I know what makes a blade of grass grow aren't you oh I'm so glad I do can I say something else brother Urban can I say something else there's a big difference between mentally knowing yeah it's God that grows the grass that's just your mind knowing a fact fact but when you know the one that grows it that's a different story that means that if you know him he's got to be in here you know him personally because he dwells in your heart praise the Lord amen it's the same power amen that grows that thing it draws moisture and so forth and grows that thing I'm here to tell you that no man can come unto be me except my father draw him how many believe that that's the drawing power of the Holy Ghost in your life it's the very same drawing power that pulls you to a higher ground that is pulling you up higher that is making you not content with where you're at but you're W to go further it's a power it's an inside power if you ain't got that you're a nominal Christian you're no more than the devil or his angels say our Believers Cain was absolutely a Believer and even a worshiper but he didn't have the Revelation we're no better than him if it's only a mental conception has to be more than just a mental understanding but you got to know that power amen the prophet of God knew that power amen you tell me what tells that sap to go down and I'll tell you it's the same intelligence that told me that woman would be well isin't that right amen it's the same intelligence that said I'm going to have a bride without spot and without wrinkle as I've said many times don't expect to go into Rapture filthy dirty don't expect to G to God to take the rapture dressed like a harlot thinking like a harlot hello or having sin in your life how many believes it's got to be dealt with amen because if he lead lets one in he'll have to let them all in amen if one church can go in because they want to go their way he'll have to let all of them in only fair but God don't do it that wayen praise the Lord all right let's get off the blade of grass for a minute but I thought that was just good amen it's the same one leading you leading me on a daily basis amen and when you are tapped in you're tapped in to the source the source of all things of all creation and yet that is on the inside of you I don't know it might get old to you but it don't get old to me to think that God himself has made his Abode in your heart and he is looking and pressing and wanting to get into you more than what you and I are letting [Music] him how many believe that I don't know about you but I believe that I believe that God God wants to come into you and into me like the Kentucky dam and the Kentucky Lake ain't that right and those big old valves that they open up a't that right once in a while they have to open up those valves at the bottom let all the go and the settlement and the muck and the M the everything that settled down into them Gates but you open them Gates and guess what it's going to have such a tremendous pressure that it's going to shoot that water straight off amen but there has to be an Avenue there has to be an opening for that water to go to pushing out and that's the way it is with god with him with you and I I don't care where you are I don't care how holy you are God still wants to press more of himself through you and it's not God's fault no it's our fault our own ways sometimes that get in the way and it takes God some sometimes brother Tommy to put us in the hospital to put us here to get our attention to get us to open up but Lord don't throw me in the hospital don't make me suffer this that or the other amen Sunday morning coming to church is good enough for me to open up say God pour yourself out through me stagnant backslid cold on God hello it's not go how God wants you it's not how he wants us he wants you on fire walking like brother Phil said having fellowship with him and he God wants you to abide in him because I'm here toble if you are in Christ the devil will do everything he possibly can remember the devil hates this Revelation he does everything he fights Revelation he does everything to try to get into the church making it lukewarm formal and defiling it defiling it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless amen the devil wants to defile you he doesn't want you pure and there ain't nothing like pure there ain't nothing like holy there ain't nothing like undefiled and I'll get it to you after a while amen all right let's go praise the Lord Brother Brad I'm figured a little bit more out amen because under well I could you go under the table is that right if you have a certain quote or certain something I used to just print it out there and there'd be a million of them but if you'll hit current message so on the computer I'll find out where it is go to the current message and then it'll pick it up right there and used to I'd almost have to stay with that whole message because I couldn't find all the rest but now I found the way to do the rest so praise the Lord we're progressing a little is that all right praise be to God you love him all right now let's look at this now listen so we can say to the Pentecostal Brethren well he says what we got back y when our forefathers got it 50 years ago maybe ISU Street and I hope that the Lord will forgive me and that I'm correct but we even talk about going back to acts is that right Acts to Pentecost the original Pentecost is that right I don't say that we don't need to go back there we do but we don't need to do what they did why because how many knows brother Braham says in church ages that church fell before he could get her before he could Rapture her she had fallen even 30 years Paul says you I'm sure I'm you know you you know I'm surprised that you are so moved so quickly moved they didn't stay pure Pentecost very long and before you know it they had fallen so in the aspect of that we don't want to do that we want to go further than that isn't that right we want to go further than they did we want to go all the way to the rapture we want to go to the coming of the Lord that's our goal my point this morning is remember don't look back if you want more of God and you want to tap into this you can't do it by looking back no you got to look forward don't never brother bam says Look Backwards look forward keep looking forward science don't do that and then another place brother bam says s does look back amen man looks back always looking back and in some aspects they do because they're always going back and digging up dinosaurs and looking at history and looking up in history and you know is that right preachers do it keep looking forward science is going to find God before the preacher does if we don't watch it in his researches amen listen to this now let's take for instance the achievement that man has been able to do on Earth and all of these natural achievements I want you undivided attention now all the natural achievements has happened in the Earth has been forerunners of spiritual ual achievements that God has done by his church somebody tell me what that means then where are we where we are where are we then well I'll answer that for you we're in the astronaut age how many beli we're in the astronaut age not in the horse and buggy age anymore not in the car age anymore not in the airplane not in the jet not in the supersonic but we are in the astronaut the space shuttle in outer space what does that mean bottom line to all of that is now we fly where all things are possible the days of Miracles ain't passed the days of the Holy Ghost ain't pass the days of traveling faster living higher being closer to God they're not over with all things are possible with you nothing shall be impossible whoa astronaut age but as your preacher and Pastor I ask you but are we just where are we living where are we really living amen that's where the church is but I want every one of you to be in that astronaut age oh my lot comes to my mind that right not affected by the outside anymore not in the outer courts not in the inner courts amen where the lights go out and you got to relight the candle relight the candle trim the lamp I hope you trim your lamp every morning every afternoon every evening as a matter of fact you know uh you know I believe that the way to tap into the source of God once you get plugged into tapped into a power source isn't that right I wanted to bring a lamp up here and plug it in when you plug it in the light comes on why because there's power there and it lights it up unplug it and guess what the light goes out amen we're supposed to plug it in and keep it plugged in if you abide in me and my word abide in you you could ask what you will and you shall have it all right well I'm getting ahead of myself I want to talk to you about an engine here for a little bit now notice the spirits on he talks about engines he talks about power let's take for an instant he says all the natural things are a type of spiritual things now you say how is that let's take for example Transportation first Transportation was by horse automobile signs built an airplane but you see first was one horse p power the car was maybe 20 horsepower the car was maybe 20 horsepower the airplane goes up to hundreds of horsepower see and what is it it's just as we come on with the horse and then the auto is made and the next thing the airplane we just keep achieving higher and higher greater and greater this is the achievement of Science and this is a forerunner of the spirit things that's happened oh God by his Spirit has promised in his word butam says what's the matter with us Christians the Christians we've laid down on our job that's right science has taken men further with his five sensus than ministers has taken him with his soul amen y'all remember Einstein and how smart he was in figuring out creation and all the things that they're trying to figure out how was it all made how was it all made the Einstein probably one of the closest come that came to it he he says man he says you know he the conclusion of the matter is that God created the heavens and the Earth you know it basically go down to atoms molecules all the way down and you have leave to think if I'm not wrong the last thing that it went back to amen was gases and so forth and then they said something about light go back to light and God is light a't that right so almost they almost come right up to realizing what it was made by we don't go just all most there brother Tommy amen we' realized that it was God that made it amen God made made everything and not only do we try to find him that way but you find him through a humble and and a repentant heart amen not only do we know who made it but we found a way to tap into that Source amen aren't you glad for that amen now notice let me see here I'd just like to ask you a question many of you brethren in here can go back with me to the old model te amen model th we'll call that Luther I said that we'll call it the Luther age now notice science is only as good as it can measure as close as science can measure that's how powerful they become as close as the church can measure that's just as powerful as the church becomes here it becomes about measurements amen measurements mathematics is that right amen as close as science can measure that's how powerful they've come now science about 35 years ago could only measure to 10,000 of an inch in that they could make the model T4 with a 10,000s of an inch pistol ring which could give it the terrific speed of about 25 mph up to it set a spark plug over it a valve to pump the gas up the gas fired by the spark plug but it lost so much of its compression as it went out with a 10,000 of an inch amen now listen that was the old model for but did they stop at that no sir they can go down now to 100,000 of an inch now they cutting in their rule measuring closer now they can take that same Ford or that same piston in a jet engine and almost drive it 600 miles per hour with the same spark plug fig firing over the top of it what is it they can Maj your clothes sir that nothing leaks out wo kind of reminds me of the story of Amen being sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost is't that right they used to have box cars no out they got there and it was everywhere in that box car by the time they got there they found out we need some inspectors we need somebody to pack it in tight how many knows if you're going to be a better Christian and you're going to have more power you're going to have to pack it in a little tighter amen my nothing leaks out the pressure's there but your measurement wasn't close enough I mean know God is there he's wanting to get into you but you're going to have to measure a little bit different they can take the hundred thousands of an inch and split an atom with it are they stopping no they're going on but us oh well we're satisfied with what Moody said finny said or you hold yourself well that's just the way I am huh well you sure won't move forward if that's out of here no that's right but finny said them men were all right they were Christians brothers that's in glory he says the first time that rule was ever laid across the word of God how do you measure it tonight what value has the word of God got to you now look Christian Martin Luther came out and laid it across Catholicism and found out that the just shall live by faith I me know that was the rule that was that was they begin to have a reference enough power there to pull the church out of Catholicism but even he didn't really realize what it meant how many glad to understand what it means we'll get to it after a bit he left listen just shall live by faith but he left a great Gap there many things passed through oh my can I preach how many knows there's still just too many things that are allowed to pass through our mind I believe Paul said that we were to bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of God remember we're talking about perfection now amen spotlessness virtuousness ready to meet Christ I truly believe a message this morning is a message to get the bride ready because that's what we're interested in or I can come up here and tell you how to how to how to get rich buy a bunch of little properties get some rental property get some real estate this this that or the other or whatever whatever business you're in just do it much better than what more efficient no we're not here to do that we're here for your soul all those other things will pass away but your soul is what the real value is here amen we're trying to put you up to God's measuring stick so to speak amen now notice Catholicism great Gap there but he believed that the just shall live by faith and he stepped out on it because God's word said so he measured God's word out to the people that just shall live by faith amen Along Came another little fellow in England by the name of John Wesley he measured it to the people a little closer he cut that ruler just a little closer could meure closer sanctification as they called it in them days the work second work of Grace look at what he done he introduced Holiness to the church how many believe amen you can overcome that amen you don't have to drink that beer you ain't got to smoke that cigarette you ain't got to do this that or the other but you can live a Sanctified life to almighty God Amen make it a little closer my that was the second work of Grace look what he do he introduced Holiness to the church Along come Pentecost and measured down the gift of the Holy Spirit speaking with tongues and signs but we're just letting the big gap through he said they still had a gap what was that Gap was their own ways their own ideas that speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost anybody that doesn't got the holy ghost that was incorrect there was still a leak in it there was still a fault in it wo how many knows that if you're not filled with the power of God this morning there must still be a little leak somewhere in your life huh I'm not here to patch you on the back oh you're such a wonderful man wonderful Christian you don't need any more no we need them more I need more there's still too much of a gap in my life hello got to measure a little bit closer amen I believe over in Russellville there's a if I'm not wrong am me there are people that work on the cars over there called PR Precision maintenance Precision maintenance something like that Precision amen all right let's go on Along come Pentecost all right on down but there's still a G let us tonight lay the measure of God down let's us this morning lay the measure of God down and measure the whole word of God the same only spirit that fired the Piston back there that brought them out by faith justification the same one that gave sanctification ation the same one that gave the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same power the same Holy Ghost can move the church to Perfection amen and it will do it to everything that God promised in his word he will do it how many believes amen that he gave himself that he might sanctify and worship that he might be without spot and without rinkle or any such thing amen and if God said he's going to do it he's going to do it amen I go God does it in my grandchildren but I believe he's going to do it in me I believe he's going to do it in you how many believe we're the on he's doing it in not somebody else or the Next Generation Amen on praise the Lord back to Perfection and it will do it everything he promised the trouble of it is let's cast out the world let's measure God's word why do you think I read those scriptures that's our measuring stick that's what we're measuring to amen we're not measuring like the churches are well this don't matter and that don't matter and God don't care how you dress boy that's a loose loose mejing step no wonder there are so many leaks amen I don't know about you but don't you hate to drive a vehicle that you just doesn't have any power you gas it it's only running on two and it's got eight you're trying to pull something back there you got a trailer on and you can't man you're about have to put your leg out on the road and push a little bit with your foot you'd almost be better off you could feel like you could be better off with The Flintstones card having your feet under it and push on it huh that's right it's just terrible sometimes we get backslid and that's how we feel terrible hello you ain't got to feel that way amen praise the Lord but Lord help us let's measure and I know what he h let's measure God's word and it's the truth have faith in God Jesus said for if you shall say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt it it'll do just what you tell it to do let's measure up he says I don't care the Lutheran are fine the Baptists are fine the methodists were fine the Pentecostals were fine all these different things are all right but let's put it right down and say every word of God is true Everything God said is perfect and if he said whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them I believe that's theth truth God let me lay down my measuring stick down on my soul and spread it across the go God's word and say God it's the truth set the unction of the Holy Spirit and fire the C above me I believe every word you'll see things take how many believe the Church of the Living God if we don't want to be like the Pentecostals the Baptist and everybody else that's got a Cadillac and they've got the nice Steeples and they got the nice churches it's all fancy but there ain't no spark there ain't no fire there amen I tried to talk home I tried just well now we're in church again I we all glad to be back and just stay all calm but you get fired up I get a little loud not because I'm putting it on Amen why because we want SP bark I'm look I'm trying to hear some fire out there too amen don't let the preacher be the only one with fire amen you say Amen say hallelujah that's the truth let all the Cinders work let it fire it'll bring a cloud down here it'll bring the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost down here when everybody is saying the same thing every cylinder is firing we ain't got no dead Cadillac we've got a a spark under the hood that'll fire that gas I got this wrote down brother Ivan I don't know if Mary Jane ever got to ride in his car did you get to ride in his fast race car no I guess just before your time chel not chel Shel I think it was a Shel wasn't it yeah he had the baddest car of all of us amen we didn't even try to compete that's right he had a cam in Down Under that hood and and man whenever it would it would go have you ever heard heard of engine does that but if you ever put the gas on woo you'd sit back in your seat woo how many believes that's the way the church ought to be today amen you got to have a Precision engine built precise Amen to to demonstrate the power of almighty God and God's got a church amen that's been built precise with Precision not loose no loose no leaking compression man this car runs but it ain't got no compression amen you got to have compression church needs compression when that fire when that fire comes them cylinders go to squeaking and they get them making some noise amen all right measure lay it down on God's word fire every cylinder above me I believe every word and you'll see things take place amen Jesus is risen from the dead he's just doing all kinds of things to get the people to believe how many would think knows that when we see when we hear the Tex when we know that what God did through the prophet we know the great things that it it ought to inspire Faith to believe God all things are possible for his church God did great things and he can still do them in his church and in his people amen Jesus is risen he's just doing all kinds of things amen but we're just to loose we let it slip through oh I didn't pray I haven't meditated I've gotten away from God the compression the closeness that you had with God isn't there anymore I wonder how many people are there this morning I'm not as close to God as I was is any would what confess any confess say well that's me that's me just be honest we're all brothers and sisters here we all it happens to every one of us amen losing compression because of the deceitfulness of the devil amen you know how bad the devil wants to get between me and my wife oh he tries it all the time oh yeah I'd love to say he we get along hunky dory all the time we just have absolute Heavenly places out there and we do most of the time but there's times that it's not that way folks it'll be a little bit Moses and Safara going on SA or what whatever her name was his wife ain't that right uhoh I'm getting in trouble already now ain't I that's right but why he wants us to lose compression well and it'll happen on a Wednesday or a Saturday night amen just just watch the devil it'll happen on a Saturday or a Wednesday night or a Wednesday Wednesday during today this old boy got to keep his cool don't let it get under your skin that's right because if it's you I won't be any good back here amen I might as well tell you husbands whatever your wife acts like you're responsible for ironing it out it's your job to change your attitude whatever problem she has she is under you she will never answer for you you'll answer for her amen all right we'll leave that alone all right now let's go on so listen he says let me just see all right praise the lord we let it sip slip through he could come here tonight walk out on the platform visible in the body with nail scar hands in return but he's here in the form of the spirit amen but not in the form of the Flesh and he brings his body back with him well amen now notice now let's go let's go and talk about it first of all if you're going to build something it has to be built right you can't keep building something the same way or we'd still be going 25 miles an hour in the Model T Ford and in order for us to come Perfection and it's in order for us to be more precise Precision about everything isn't that right amen we're going to have to have the word that is more precise how many believe that God sent us something more precise it wasn't just reformers anymore but now we have thus sayeth the Lord it don't get any more original than that it don't get any more precise than that amen and y'all remember when brother brandham had to make a choice of whether he was go the harder way isn't that right whether he would go the hard way amen and he was preaching a message and and Danny I believe his name Danny Henry or something amen he come up and he was going to talk about he that could be the revelations 22nd chapter and he began to speak in tongues remember that he spoke in tongues and another one person I mean heard it heard it a in unknown language and it was interpreted and when they interpreted it it said it this way now here now this man now watch what he's wrote you can see it in foreign words thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way bless God it's my way how many knows that every day that we live amen we make choices we make decisions God help us to make the precise and correct choices cuz we always have choices to make every day we have to make choices am I going to do this am I going to do that how am I going to react to this how am I going to react to that you have to make choices in the whole world and your world depends on how you make that choice how many knows you it's either the right choice or it's the wrong choice we want the precise we want that precise Choice precise decision it's my way bless God oh it's my way he said because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits you he had never heard about the vision you see to this you remember the vision and I tried to find out exactly what that vision is the only thing I can come up with this is me is that vision of who he's seen those millions that were over there remember that there was Millions a huge portion of Heaven because he made the right choice and that is he chose God's way and because he made the right choice brother bread we're going to be there amen help parents today to make the right choice so their children will be there help the pastor to make the right choice so his church will be there W somebody say Glory because he made the right choice because he made a precise decision you and I can get there we have something that could bring us to where we can be there further than Luther further further than Wesley further than Pentecostal oh my that's right Luther just shall live by faith Wesley sanctification Pentecostal the gifts of the Holy Ghost let's look at some of the some of let's look at the rule how many wants me to give you this rule a little bit the rule of God's word that's required of us how many is a big requirement of us that's right a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision thou H has made amen for one thing how many knows that the prophet of God said that in order to be there he said thus sayith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place wow you know what Jesus said love your enemies and so forth it'll take that perfect love don't never let animosity bitterness or anything like that ever come into your heart if you have that bitterness if you have hatred in your heart and things the whole Lord comes you're going to be left behind you're going to be sitting there you're with spot and wrinkle there's nothing as perfect as perfect love ain't that right casts out all fear amen I thought about the requirements let me just go back a little bit I don't think I pulled this one up but you'll remember about the prophet of God he said that uh Charlie and them were down there shooting squirrels with a shotgun boom blast him out of the tree I got him yeah we got a whole five gallon Buck full but a abandon was sitting up there amen and his gun wasn't quite shooting right it was not driving tax out of 50 yards brother bam when he shot at the shooting range he wanted one bullet to go through the other one and when I'm sting to me I like for him to amen make the hole don't even make the hole bigger is that what brother B said his was doing the hole wasn't even getting bigger somebody said you missed no it went through the same hole woo that's how the prophet of God was amen when he was missing it he was sitting there crying in a nervous wreck and he said he got a revelation God says I made you that way for a purpose he like to have it dead on aren't you glad for a prophet like that he wanted exactly like Paul preached when he went over beyond the curtain of time he asked if Paul's group is going to have to be h a judge Paul's gonna have to be judged oh yeah he's gonna have to be judged too well Hallelujah then my group will going in because I had a bull's eye amen I taught what Paul taught amen and I can hear Millions were cried out come on I can't hear you we're resting on that go ahead we're resting on that how many's resting on that we ain't over there yet but we're still resting on it because we can take what he said right back to the word Bullseye Perfection Precision I don't have to yell don't have to scream this but you know that by the time we get finished living this message we'll be what we need to be we will possess what we need to possess to make the Rapture why because he said there's rapture pring Faith lays in that message amen and before he said that brother Brad he got to talking about everything God had done in the ministry he raised the dead he healed the sick and he did all these absolutely infallible proofs it should give you Faith he said for a Rapture it should give you rapturing Faith amen praise the Lord oh my he said it'll take perfect love to put you in that place that's all there was there no matter what money how much religious demonstrations how many Good Deeds you have done or what more amen you might have spoken tongues you might have done this you might have give your body to be you might have all of those things but there's still too much loss of compression if you ain't got this love it's not precise enough and that something something that even Jesus when he was talking about loving your enemies and so forth he said that just before said be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect brother Troy what kind of people would we be sister Robin if we would never be offended nothing could ever offend you somebody smack you across your face and you've got so much love you just want to put your arm around him say Well I don't know what makes you so angry brother but God bless you I love you man give me a hug when's the last time you've had a good hug huh devil can't touch you devil can't touch you amen y'all quiet yeah that's right your pastors I his knees too Lord help me that's right crucify him crucified Christ stoned stepen to death and while the stones were flinging at him don't L it to their charge father don't charge them with this dismiss the charges God couldn't affect him amen take perfect love to put you there brother Bram says amen all your religious Deeds he says it'll take perfect love so whatever you do you lay aside everything else shave off all the Loose Ends isn't that right shave everything off until you've got that until you're so filled with God and the love of God till you can love those who hates you amen praise the Lord another one two of the ones that I've preached here many times and I'm going to continue to preach them amen is that all right but this is the line this is what he taught us Amen Let me see here therefore as the evening Shadows are appearing and the Wrath is ready to be poured out from on high upon ungodly Nations upon ungodly unbelievers the professors without a profession how many believes that if you're a professor and you don't have possessions you're going to stand the wrath of God this morning if you don't have a possession get a possession don't just have a profession make sure that you possess the holy ghost in your soul upon these things I've tried to unfold myself and live right among it to see where it's standing before I said these things now we are living in the shadows and the WRA wrath is ready to strike and God is requiring amen God is requiring a token that you yourself have received this token the Holy Ghost it's the only way the only sign that God will ever pass because it's the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the believer we won't go into great detail take us a while but we all understand amen that it's not just a chemistry of the blood anymore you people say all day long they believe in enough Jesus died for me he shed his blood and I believe it was for me but just the mental faith of that mental belief of that is not going to be enough no it takes now he says the life that was in the blood has to come back on the believer and that is the literal life of Jesus Christ it has to be God in our talk it has to be God in our what daily walk everything about it it's got to be the literal life it's the only thing one of these more mornings when he comes between six and nine it's those who are living his life that he comes to take that's the other requirement of course you can't have perfect love without having this isn't that right so perfect love is part of this per amen this holy spirit because the animal life could not return back amen how many Believers that you've got to believe every word every jot every TT hey we're getting down to the nitty-gritty now aren't we every jot every TT I had a preacher uh explain every maybe every every dot every comma every crossing of the te what a jit what some of that is I don't even understand except it's just a little small Mark am me if God put that little dot if you put a little dot on it I believe the dot don't you I believe every jot every TI every part amen you've got to be purring like a kitten so to speak ain't that right fine tuned washed in the blood of Jesus Christ without spot why in the world do you think brother Bram told Billy Paul every night before you go to sleep ask God to forgive you for everything how many's with me hey every day we fall short we got to ask God forgive me Lord forgive me Lord forgive me Lord as long as you're asking him to forgive you it ain't it ain't that you're never going to make a mistake brother Bram says that Perfection that you're Desiring is on that side as long as you're in this flesh it will stumble sometimes now let me clear that up if you stumble all the time willfully you need a different Spirit but we make failures we fall short and as long as you're repenting of that you stand perfect in the sight of God Amen praise be to God I didn't bring you no extra shirt all right let's not think about that shall we praise the Lord every JN every titled and if you're beli it oh like this let me see which one I want to read first brother BR Brother Martin Luther you know he preached that just shall live by faith but he had a lot of looseness about him Ain that right he had a lot of air yet he drank from what I understand smoked a little maybe and dis that or the other all kinds of things that shouldn't have been amen I want to say today that I believe our Prophet through go God through our Prophet has brought us the correct understanding of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that right the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit am mean they made a way for the Holy Spirit himself to come down and to live in you and in iing it's a whole lot more than just speaking in unknown tongues yeah sounds like a bunch of rattling but listen we got something more than just some unknown tongue we've got the giver of tongues I believe in the gifts and so forth but the giver is more important ma ma does something for me to think that you got the give her every day you got the give her fine tuned let me before I go this I want to just give you a couple more measuring lines isn't that right let me let me just give you a couple more measuring lines something the measure as by let me see where I've got this Matthew 21 I'll just read it we all remember when Jesus went and cursed the fake tree because there was no fruit on it when they came back it was withered away and when the disciples saw it they Marvel saying how soon is the Fig Tree withered away and Jesus Jesus answered and said unto them verily I say unto you if ye had faith and doubt not you shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree boy you talk about going to extreme listen to this but also if you shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the SE it shall be done how manyan know it's a whole lot different move cursing a little tree and moving the mountain amen listen listen in all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive John 1412 says 13 it says verily verily I say unto he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do go because I go to the father whatsoever things you shall ask in my name that will I do that the May father may be glorified amen 15 and7 says I if you abide in me then my word words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done another place nothing shall be impossible for you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe and you shall ask how many that's a big line that's a lot for us really that's what he said amen don't we want to walk in that place don't we want to have that kind of power yes sir so all I can say say Lord help us each one to look where we still have a loss of compression where we're still a little bit too loose are you with me Lord help me where is my prayer life too loose because that's where you plug in how many knows that's where really your power source is in that prayer and that fellowship with almighty God and you know we pray morning we pray noon but Paul says praying always stay plugged in just always be talking about the Lord keep your mind stayed on him and let me read a couple more quotes I about forgot we're having communion listen to this uh right here this talking about if you believe every jot if you're fine-tuned then you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it in the beginning this is my message to the church now as we go off the air just in a few minutes you're standing if you're standing I I like that period This is a if you're standing comma if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every jot every K where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them shcks and get out here where the wheed is where you can get re right before the sun I hear the coming of the combine amen I I feel a power coming don't you I feel resurrection power oh you might call it the bride's Revival I don't know what you want this morning I'm calling it the resurrection power is coming up in the church the resurrection power is beginning to build and hold the compression amen that evening night tabernac of Saint need for translation one of these days will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of it I feel the power don't you if I don't get it how you're going to get it amen so pray for me amen I want more of it all right now notice oh talk about a Thanksgiving I feel good listen that's more thankful for that than anything I know you are the pure without spot without wrinkle is that right you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man or every woman is born of the spirit and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never done it in the first place you are perfect you are perfect woo the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you you are standing completely you never sinned in the first place that God don't even know nothing about it it's an a sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the
