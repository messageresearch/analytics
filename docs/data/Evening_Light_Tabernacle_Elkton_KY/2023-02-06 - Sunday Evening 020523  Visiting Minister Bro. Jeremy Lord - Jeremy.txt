be you know that's it feels like home and that's the way it should be where the spirit of the Lord is it should feel like home no matter where we go and I just praise the Lord and you can fill the pull and that's what it is at our church people will pull and and that's what you know that's it's you that are is operating the gift if we just sit and uh not really paying attention you know it's we don't get as much out and it's because the Lord wants to feed us but he wants us also to pull and I praise the Lord for that because I feel at our church I feel it at several churches but there's some Churches you go to and you don't feel that but praise the lord we feel that here amen well I have you stand too long let's turn to Ephesians chapter five Ephesians chapter five let's go to verse 31 verse 31. it says for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined into his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church I'd like to speak tonight with the Lord's willing marriage but it's between Christ and the church natural types of spiritual but let's we are the church and we're getting ready to get married to Christ amen let's bow our heads precious Heavenly Father Lord we ask once again Lord Jesus that you will come and anoint your word Lord Jesus Lord these are scriptures that we have read Lord but your word is a Living Word Lord and therefore we always get something fresh and something new Lord out of it something that you have need for us today and Lord we're looking for that Lord and we ask you Lord Jesus for your you're that you add the blessings to the reading your word in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated this is a something that I I was thinking on the other week and you know how close we are to actually the Lord coming back and to meet him at the Lord started leading me to to other scriptures and there was a a couple in our church that they recently got married probably in last summer but there's things that you do to prepare for a wedding and it's the same thing that we we have made herself ready there is a preparation the location the flowers the the Gown the hairdo the food there's so many things and it doesn't just happen overnight it takes time to prepare for that well it's the same thing with us it takes time to get into position where and the reason the bride does it and the reason we the bride are doing it is to make him our husband happy to be pleasing to him why do we wear the things we do why do we dress the way we do to be pleasing to damn you know there's there's many people that have asked me at work that they don't know much about God but why do you wear dresses and why do you have long hair and not me but you know my wife so yeah I don't wear dresses at work don't don't get it but anyways um and I and I say and I always use it as a natural type that if I know there is something that my wife hates then I won't do that I just won't I said otherwise I'm not a good husband and I said in vice versa if she knows that I do not like a certain thing she won't do that because she loves me and and the scripture says it's an Abomination and that means that something that God hates and I said so he hates it says that's why we do it we don't do it out of uh he hates it so why would I do it and they look at me like huh you know there's we so blessed the things that we know there's basic ABCs that people don't know I I uh there's a friend of mine from high school that he went away and uh you know he lived all around the country's life and and his dad wanted to start a little men's group to kind of help him you know get back on his feet and he was wanting to get some Christian Brothers well they they're Westlands and so and he asked me hey do you want to you want to join this manager and I said absolutely you know we're going to talk about God let's do it now there's a Catholic in there there's a non-dination non-denominational uh brother that has his Doctorate Divinity and there's a there's a couple lutherans no no not lose Westlands and then there's some some other so it's a mix you know and and we start going and there's things that you just you gotta go easy with you can't feed a baby meat you have to feed go start you know that's the thing as we why wise as a why is that the serpent but harmless as a dove and so you start going with the and they've asked me to delete some things appraisal Lord we started how's that sure I'll bring something you know and uh and they start bringing serpent seed and that brother Branham hasn't taught that you can't put through the Bible I don't have to quote brother Branham to prove a Doctrine and if you do then watch out because you might be trying to make brother man say something that's not right whatever he said he goes take it back to the word so these are people that you know they don't even have they don't even know uh really who Jesus is they still you know father son Holy Ghost and and I'm like Lord and every time I go I Lord just make me salty I don't want to hurt him but I want to make them dig and praise the Lord Slowly by slowly it seems like things are turning around and we got to talking about baptism last time because there was somebody in our church that was getting baptized last week and so last time we got to talking about baptism foreign and the the doctor of divinity says after we got done he goes you know I've been baptizing wrong I'm like praise the Lord he goes and I was like what do I do I said just from now on baptized correctly go from now on Lord Jesus Christ instead of father son Holy Ghost and and I was so rejoicing and so enthused because I start seeing things happen and it's been a year but I could get in a way and start pushing things and choke them all out and make them leave no we don't want to do that they they need to get ready too but it's not me getting them ready it says the bride has made herself ready so that's the thing is they have to have the willingness the desire to get themselves ready and so we can't push somebody to get them ready but we can well this is how the Lord has showed me and and uh and Away you go and you can't so you can't push anything else but when you truly fall in love with Christ and that's the key then everything else becomes easy it's not a have to so I want to our brother was talking about it wants to come to church once the true Christian wants to be around those it's absolutely true and and you don't there's a bro brother that we talk and doing you know he's ready you know you need you need friends and the people you hang out with matters so I want to hang out with somebody who is a Christian more than somebody that's just of the world and and he wants more of God and he seems to have a desire now brother Graham always said if you want to become a better Christian read and pray it's as simple as that read and pray read and pray and I also said man it's important to get to church but I have never pushed it because I want him to come to church because he wants to because you can make somebody feel bad and get them in the door but now are they there because they're pleasing you or are they there to please God because if they're there to please you it really doesn't do them much good but if they're there to please God then they're there with a different perspective and praise the Lord last Sunday he was in church and I mean it almost made me cry because I was like oh there's another soul I can I can see him working you know and as long as God is still on The Mercy Seat he's still drawing people too the moment that he leaves the mercy there's no hope left for this world but you know what we are his we are his examples here we we are his ambassadors so what we're supposed to do is witness Christ and bring him in Lord help us now there's different types of brides we are in a very we live in a very selfish world the world has become selfish and so self-centered and it's all about me and they call him Bridezillas you ever heard that term where they they're like a Godzilla but they're just it's all about them this is my day this is this oh the flowers were perfect you know now put that in a spiritual I don't want to be a bridezilla to Christ we can make it all about us and not about Christ oh and and I everything I try to look back at myself Lord do I complain you know I think that's what the children of Israel were doing when the Lord had let him delivered him for me Egypt through the Red Sea and then they started complaining then children they don't have to be baby they don't want you to well done my faithful servant well done you know and I'm like Lord I want to be where where you can you can be proud have you considered my servant job boy have you considered my servant whoever oh my the the Lord has that much confidence in you to put you as a a bait in front of Satan that's what he did with job and Satan was like well you protecting this Lord put a hedge around Germany today at school we should pray that I still pray that to this day I want that edge around her don't you want Satan to complain lord I can't even touch him because he put a hedge around him like yes he does Amen Lord don't remove the Hedge don't let me get ahead in high-minded oh I pass every test we may not have really had a true test job had a truth test oh my and the lord taketh away blessed be the is that going to come out of my mouth Lord I wanted to we don't know exactly what we're going to do to we're put in that situation and Lord I don't really want to be put in that situation but that's where the true you know brother Graham was told when he when he left his wife died and somebody said is your religion still holding on you he goes no it's holding on to me I'm not holding on to it and that's exactly exactly right Christ holds on to us during that time we don't hold on to him it's it's got to be Christ deep inside you truly find out what's there when you go through trials Lord help us I don't want to be bridezilla okay so in Matthew chapter 19 verse 4 there's a lot of scriptures that we go through that are concerned and married but he said he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female that'd be something for the world to hear today I can't even tell the gender I mean how crazy are we I mean who would have thought it would get that bad and I've wondered I wanted to brother Brandon actually saw some of the things that are going on today and that's why he was like so no way you know there's this no way and it is absolutely by God's grace that any of us stay especially the kids with everything that's at their fingertips that weren't at our fingertips Lord help me to pray for my children to keep them and it's only by God's grace that he held on to them amen verse 5 and Matthew 19. and he said for this cause shall a man cleave shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they shall Twain be one flesh verse six wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God has joined together let no man put asunder now remember the other scripture we just read it says speaking concerning Christ in the church what God has joined together now he did it he's talking naturally but Also spiritually he's joined together we are joined together with him in Heavenly places amen let no man put asunder and there will be times where men will try to come in you know what the scripture says they'll be sneaking in you know and wolves and Men I mean wolves and Lamb's clothing amen and and and Naturally Speaking there's been things that uh you know like uh people want to brag on their husband or brag on their wife and maybe making somebody else discontent with their marriage and so drag on her wives well my husband does the dishes it'd be as long as it says oh man he sweeps the floors he does this he does that it's great but be careful because I think of it more like Facebook where everybody's look look how great our life is and you don't really see the things behind the scene and there's always something and Satan can use that to start making you discontent in your current marriage or relationship and don't let that happen love conquers all amen everybody is different I am not the same as brother Byler our our relationship with our wives are probably completely different but it works for us and and that's what what God has joined together let no man put us under now same thing with Christianity with a spiritually speaking it's between you and God it's not between between you and your parents and God or you and your that's during God and you and whatever you want to say it's between you and God so there fore you have to have that personal relationship that nobody else can butt into now we can spiritually same thing with husband as a wise your wife has a wife you need it personally to Christ as a husband you need a personal relationship with Christ now when you join together and you mesh and you meet oh what a bond that is I don't know how they're a Christian because part of being a Christian is forgiveness and understanding and all this and and you are two different people that you become in one house and it is tough to coincide a lot of times but you know what my wife may get on my nerves sometimes and I may get on hurting her sometimes but it's up to us to reconcile those things now we right praise the Lord we can do that that we can reconcile that but that's why I know there's things in my life and it's called iniquity that God doesn't like and I have to run and reconcile that back to God because I pray every day Paul said I Die daily excuse me because he doesn't know some of the things that he's doing that are not pleasing the Lord can you imagine if the Lord showed you absolutely everything that wasn't pleased to him right now it quit there's no way but he's a good god he's a gentle God he shows you a little bit you gotta work on that just perfectly it's it's a have you heard that Holy Spirit rain down it's it's like a soft gentle rain it's not beating the plants he wants you to he wants you to thrive but you've got to get watered oh my my Lord I just want to be to be serving the lord such a beautiful thing now let's go to uh Revelations we've quoted this but let's read it Revelations chapter 19 and uh let's start with verse 6. it says give you a second to get there I always start too early it says and I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude and as a voice of many Waters and as a voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent greatness verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready oh my let's go to keep on verse 8. excuse me and to her was granted that she should be a raid and fine linen can you imagine that wedding garment when you're thinking of a fine linen I'm thinking of something that's oh it just feels so almost like Silk and you look at it it's like oh that's so beautiful fine linen and yet it breathes you know it doesn't it's not something that that makes you so hot it's just because it's fine linen and it says clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of Saints oh who is our righteousness Jesus Jesus is what we're clothed with Jesus is divine linen it's all about Jesus amen we when we had communions today and there is no way that any of us Jesus that he makes us worthy not looking at us us he is looking at your perfect sacrifice oh my but as long as you got to stay under that perfect side and claim I claim the blood that Jesus shed for me that blood oh my that cleansing blood that is what it is and it's and it's something that I don't ever want to take for granted it seems like sometimes we take the blood of Jesus for granted I mean we we know Calvary but it doesn't seem like it gets preached very much which I understand but if still need to be talked about because Calvary is why we are here oh it's a beautiful Lord help us to be oh my the wedding garment is is Jesus now keep your place there because line up online you can take a scripture and like oh this scripture right here fits right in this scripture right here fits right in so I'm going to fit this right in in Isaiah 64. it says but we are all as an unclean thing in our righteousness are sorry our righteousness are as filthy rags which do Fade but remember it's his righteousness that we're cleansed with so verse um we'll go to Jeremiah Jeremiah fits in here Jeremiah 33 15 and 16 it says in those days at that time I will cause the branch of righteousness to grow upon the David and he shall execute judgment and write in the land verse 16. in those days shall Judah be saved in Jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is the name wherein she I love that wherein she shall be called the Lord our righteousness and that's what it has to be the Lord are righteous not all righteousness because ours is his filthy rags but it's his righteousness so where does pride ever come in shouldn't it's not your righteousness it's his righteousness well by Godly I'm in the message that shouldn't even be part of it praise the Lord the Lord has showed me and he has blessed me I thank the Lord that I'm in a message but it's not going to make me look down on somebody that's not because you know what they could be in the message too they could be part of bride's childhood just not haven't seen it yet so we need to be about our father's business and and invite them and Lord help us to invite everybody who can because it's Christ that we are inviting them to it's not it's not just some Churches Christ himself amen brother Branham as many times I you know brother Brandon had a pretty good sense of humor because there's brothers that they were questioning hey why did you tell them to to stay in the Methodist Church you know stay where they were and he said well if they really got a hold of God he goes they won't stay there long because they'll kick him out and I thought that's exactly right because they can't feed on that carrying anymore now they got a different they had a nature change their sheep they got to eat good food and and so they're going to try to hey that's wrong we the scripture says this and as a system they won't it won't change but and and and so that's what we have to do is just start searching for individuals because and you get into Christ and let them go to the church they want to because if they really get to Christ they won't stay there very long amen so don't get down when you're like I led them to Christ at work but yet they still go to this if it's truly Christ then they won't be thirsty okay so verse 9 back in Revelations chapter 19. and he says that to me blessed are they which are called into the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God oh my just to be invited you know he has come and die that's a song that we sang he has the table spread for the saints of God not our fed he invites of people come and dine oh we truly are blessed and if Ephesians chapter 1 verse 22 kind of just going to go through some scriptures quickly it says Ephesians 1 20 feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that uh filleth all in all did you know that we are his fullness it says which is the body the fullness of him he isn't complete without us amen but he has given us he and he are part of it it's him that whoever the church is fitly joined together amen he's the master builder I just want to be a part of the church let him Place me where he wants me to be placed I just want to be a part of the church amen let's go to Ephesians chapter 5. verse 22 Ephesians 5 22 couple chapters over now remember we're talking about Christ in the church it's also naturally but wise submit yourselves into your own husbands now Christ is our husband and we're supposed to submit to his will I don't want my will to be done I want his will to be done and it's the same thing why submit yourselves to your husband and adds unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church now you know really brother Byler is not even head of the church because his head is Christ and as long as Christ this is head then he is a shepherd of this flock but all all in all Christ is the head of the church because he's supposed to be the leading brother Byler leading whoever so then then it takes a lot of pressure off of brother Byler because now he's like Father what do you have done what do you what sermon do you want preach how do you want me to handle this situation because Christ is the head Lord help us to make him keep him the head amen therefore as the church is subject I say right here verse 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is ahead of the church and he is the savior of the body verse 24. therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wise be to their own husband and everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it now that's a lot of love died for us and Naturally Speaking he's telling us as husbands you're supposed to love your wife enough to die for her because that love needs to be there because love conquers all and and if you truly love your wife and wives love love your husbands what what a marriage it is it's a marriage of Peace instead of contention and and and there's a lot of contentious marriages and what it means is Christ to be more of the focus because if Christ becomes more of the focus the house and everything about it become Falls more in line amen verse 26. okay so Christ gave himself for it verse 26 why did he give himself that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word oh I love that he did it so he could cleanse us and why verse 27 says that he might present it to himself I love that he did it to put he's washing us to present us to himself oh a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish now we know that Christ is the head amen and the church is the body but you think about it in my natural body what actually washes my body I will take the so open my hand and the body washes the body but the head tells me where to wash how much to us what soap to use everything about it we are perfecting the bride has made herself ready you are washing Yourself by what the head is telling you how to watch oh that's good isn't it oh your feet needs to be washed a little bit more you missed a spot over here and it dare say my hand to say nope I'm not doing it what power does that hand have over my mind that if truly we are part of Christ it'll just be watch your will Lord yes sir oh yes sir now I enjoy to hunt and and fish but when I'm sitting out hunting it takes me a long time but if I'm out there for four hours and it's really cool my core seems to get cold and I just when I get that cold when I when my core gets cold it takes a long time for me to warm up now I can go into a house at 70 degrees and sit there and I'm just hours later I'm still cold but I have found and if I go and take the hottest shower that I can and just stand there remember we're Washed by the Water of the word and there's a time in your life when you start feeling cold and you just sit there and do nothing it takes so long to feel like you get on fire again but if you go and immerse yourself get watched and just stand In the Heat of the word it'll warm you up to your core and it'll set you back on fire again oh my and I just thought Lord I want to be washed by your water of your word and he knows the temperature that you need he knows how long you need some of us might not take as long as others but that's that's all about the head control on the body now that's the thing is that our church may not act the exact same way your church is but as long as Christ is ahead of the church we're acting perfectly well they don't sing that song the same way but they're Worship in Christ oh my and that's the thing is you want to worship Christ but Christ as the as a pedestal he's the one that we're looking to he's everything and then all of our churches will react the same way even though each church is Sovereign within itself amen so it's just a great thing I just want to be a part of the body amen Lord help us now you don't need to turn here's one verse but it's in Hebrews 13 4. it says marriage is Honorable and all and the bed undefiled will whoremongers and adulterers God will judge now as long as we stay true to his word that the moment that we go outside and start checking something else like we're going to use let's say the denominations they left the word of God but they still wanted the name of Christian and the scripture calls them whoremongers and adulterers because they left the word they left Christ they left their first love but marriage between marriages honorable but we got to stay with Christ we got to stay with him first everything about it that's the only way it's honorable now uh in our church and it looks like in this church too we have several people who are you know getting close to the marriage in age and I can't stress enough how important it is the choosing of your mate sets up the rest of your life the characters I mean the looks can fade out I mean oh he Combs his hair in such a way no she looks so pretty yes but looks fade hair falls out you know and but if they truly love the Lord with all their heart now you got a mate for life and that's what you look for I just can't they have to choose Jesus first they have to be in love with Jesus brother Branham says it this way in choosing another bride he's again he said again the kind of a woman that a man will choose now I'm going to add the kind of of a man a woman will choose even though he uses a man here I think it goes both ways okay again the kind of a woman that a man would choose to shows truly what's in him a woman reflects what's the man when she chooses for her um for her as a wife it shows what's down in him no matter what he says outside what what he married that is a true thing watch what we marry watch look for Christ look for Christ that brother that buddy of mine that we started the the men's group on he said that hey that his wife that they got married he said it's like a light switch flipped and she started acting differently and I thought oh my and it it was just a horrible horrible situation to be in and and he he was just that's about drove him to suicide and it was and I thought the wife that you marry it makes so much difference now I am not perfect at all my wife is a help mate to me and I'm supposed to be a help mate to her there are days well I'm just like oh I don't want to go to church tonight you ever felt that way I have I have and in my world my wife has said we have to go we need to go that's a helpmate now vice versa there's been I know but we need to go it's our post of Duty let's go and by the time we get there and you start singing the songs of joy that Melancholy Spirit falls off and then you're excited to be at church but if you listen to your weak flesh You Never Would Have Made It help me now what if my wife I've been like no I don't want to go either they'll be okay what kind of help me that's that's not what Christ is talking about you know and and and and and we don't want to do that we want to we want to stand up and praise the Lord that when the days that I'm weak she's strong the days that she's weak I'm strong praise the Lord for that and Lord help us to keep get going that way to Christ now what you had kind of heard my testimony a little bit this morning about how I grew up in a message but Christ wasn't inside but I thank the Lord for Godly Parents because when the doors were open I had to be there and when I didn't think that I was paying attention I really there's a lot of times that I was just there but when I gave my heart to Christ and he started somebody asked me a question I knew the answer and I didn't know how I knew the answer because they took me to church all the time and there was a scene getting planted every time I was there and I just didn't know it it is so important kids when you're why they track I made a church there is a reason and praise the Lord for that because even when I didn't want to be there they made me go and as a parent we are responsible I think we'll be judged by that on the end you know at the end how we raised our kids and I want to be well done that good and faithful sir en you did a good job instead of whatever else it could be Lord help us so give us wisdom give us wisdom and and I'm telling you now my wife my wife my mom as a young kid she would say Jeremy you need to pray for your wife I'm like I'm 14 years old what do you mean my wife she goes you need to start praying for your wife she's out there somewhere you don't know what she's going through you need to pray for your wife and I got thinking about that what a wise thing to say and after I met my wife I told her that she was like oh I was really struggling at this point Lord had brought her across my mind my mom was praying for my wife before she met I'm telling you pray for your wives pray for your husbands if the Lord tarries you will be so thankful that you prayed for them versus just happenstance to find them the Lord knows how to bring us together amen amen so you don't need to turn here but in second Corinthians that says be not unequally yoked with unbelievers oh my and they want the kids to go to a different church or not at all I mean it could be a horrible I can see uh contention happening don't be unleakily yoked oh my Lord help us now scripture in Proverbs says whosoever findeth the wife findeth a good thing amen absolutely now remember Proverbs has a lot of little one-liners some of them are pretty funny about marriage and things some of them it's like I've read I'm like I don't have any idea what that means have you ever done that it's like Lord is this it's not open to me yet open it to me when you want to but I read this one looking about wives and it says it is better to dwell in a Wilderness than with a contentious and angry woman now we are the woman we are the bride Christ does not want to be yoked to a contentious always always whining always this angry why do they have so much of this why do they have so much of that he wants a sweet he wants his self and that's why he washes us to present us to himself allow yourself to be washed amen allow yourself to be changed amen now this is this is a good one the Lord I love it when you start studying for things and you end up going to some place you never thought you would go and and it leads you into other things it's just the Lord is just a beautiful beautiful this word is beautiful amen and so listen to Brother Brian I'm in the seven Church ages amen he was talking about in Revelations I'd sing as chapter one where it talks about when somebody was talking to John and he and he heard this voice and he turned to see who was talking to me and it was a Candlestick remember the can a little Spanish brother bran says right here he says what one like him his bride one like him he was looking at you and making our own mind we shouldn't be we should be speaking Jesus and Jesus there's a Christian all that what are they seeing they're seeing one liking to Christ they're seeing it and then the golden candlesticks were the seven Church ages and we're in the seventh Church age speaking Christ one liking to him oh I thought oh that's so beautiful Lord let me speak Christ let me be there now almost done but we can't talk about marriage without talking about Esther Esther's a beautiful book when it talks about marriage and one is looking let's go to Esther Esther chapter two we're gonna we're gonna spend quite a bit of time in chapter two amen actually this whole book of the Bible is beautiful but there are certain things that it will come out that just stands right out to you right at the moment and uh oh so in Esther chapter two we'll start with verse 8. it says so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree Was Heard um hey guy the Esther was brought also into the King's house into the custody of his guy Keeper of the women now remember with us when we first come to Christ there is a justification sanctification and then filled with the Holy Ghost so right here they were all brought into the palace I'm going to say as a type this is when she was justified verse 9. in the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her to things for purification and such things that belonged to her in this and seven maidens you know what with us you know we're kind of like the type of the Esther here and we were given seven Messengers to bring us to Christ seven Church ages seven Messengers amen it's a beautiful how it types and seven maidens which were meat to give to her out of the King's house now each one of those Messengers had a message from the King's house amen and he preferred her and her Maids into the best place of the house and other women let's drop down to verse 12. and when the every maid's turn was come to go into the king uh hazarus after she had been 12 months according to the manner of women and so were the days of their purification accomplished to wit six months with oil uh myrrh six months with sweet oils odors and with other things for the purification purifying of women okay so she was sanctified now she now she was justified now she's Sanctified but think about them this 12 months that's a preparation she was now something else that was 12 months if there was if she had ever seen any other man and she was impregnated nine months they would have seen that nine months six months of oils can you imagine how soft her skin was how actually clean she was and just think that's what the Christ does for us washing by the water the word he sanctifies us and he does it with oils and love and all everything he does it to the best it's not something that's just halfway this is the best in the land Christ's word himself amen amen so I can't imagine how soft her skin was all the calluses were probably gone I mean all the things that had made to have a rough life I mean it had to be just gone away and the things of the world for us should be gone away I mean we should forget about those calluses and those scars that we have and everything and just point to Christ amen you know that myrrh today is actually found in a lot of skin creams today to moisten your skin and to help your skin there's a there's a lot of medicinal things for myrrh it's it's a beautiful thing okay so Esther let's drill down 13. then now this is afterwards then thus came every Maiden into the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go out with her of the House of the women unto the King's house but when it was the turn of Esther now same same with us we're on free moral agency you can dress wherever you want to dress you can put on whatever you want to put on when you leave here and you're at your house on Tuesday we have no idea Christ knows but you are a Freemore agency you can do what you he doesn't Force us shows what's really aside when you're by yourself what you watch what you listen to show us what character amen more help us okay so this is Esther mm-hmm and uh verse 15 and now when it turn of Esther of uh Abbey Hill the uncle of Mordecai she required nothing but what hey guy the king's Chamberlain The Keeper the women appointed now this is good because the king's Chamberlain knows what the king wants now brother Branham is kind of like a type of the Chamberlain his head you know he took care of the Bride he only gave us what the king told him to give and Esther's like well what should I wear well the king likes this this is what's required you can do what you want to you can wear whatever you want to but this but this was required now I can imagine some of those women I mean they're they're open to the king's treasure can you imagine all the rings that they wore all the earrings and all the chains and thinking they were all beautiful and it's gaudy and and I and but Esther only war that says but uh what the women appointed an Esther appoint attained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her why because she only wore what was required verse 17 and the King left Esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so he set the royal Crown upon her head now that's the same thing you're being filled with the Holy Ghost in your position you're positionally placed as Queen amen but we had to do everything so she was justified Sanctified then positionally placed oh Lord and and made her Queen instead of Vesti Verse 18 and then the king made a great feast that's kind of like the wedding supper unto all his princes and then servants even Esther ceased and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king and that is what we are waiting for right now we're waiting for that wedding supper I can't imagine what that's going to be like I have no idea what that's going to be like but you know what I just want to be there I don't really care what it's like you know because you may like mashed potatoes and I like baked potatoes you know what I think it's going to be the same way and is it even going to be food I don't even know you know because it's going to be worth please put on his word here I'm assuming it's going to be food but you know what it's it's up to the it's up to the last last verse let's go to Isaiah last uh reading in Isaiah chapter 61. and let's read verses 10 and 11. it says I will greatly rejoice and the Lord now shouldn't that be something that we are doing right now and it doesn't say I Will Rejoice I will greatly Rejoice I love it it's every word is there for a reason I will greatly rejoice in the word my soul shall be Joy joyful in my God for he hath clothed me covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroomed decath himself with ornaments and as a bride adorns herself with jewels for as the Earth bringeth forth her bud and as the garden castes the things that are sown in to the spring and are sown into it to Spring forth so the Lord will cause righteousness and praise for all the nations to see now you know there is the the love chapter and it's a great chapter and some of the things there's I just love suffereth long now think about that with our marriage and ourselves but also with us in Christ now Christ's love suffereth along to us oh my our prayer requests answered in a mink we get inpatient when I love that song that we had sung this morning I mean this evening when God is four days late he's still on time that is it's in his time who are we to get impatient love if we truly love of Christ kind and we're supposed to be kind one to another if you truly love your brother and sister love is kind it says love does not puff up love seeketh not her own that's one of those things is it's not self-centered brother sister how can I help how can we help each other do you need prayer for something you're not just saying well I need prayer I need prayer do you need prayer because I mean we all pray for one another if we're supposed to and it helps join us together love is not easily provoked it says offenses will come but I'm telling you God will not cause you to be offended only Satan will cause you to be offended offenses are things that Satan uses to drive wedges well he really meant this and she really meant that if there was a brother an example that we had that they could have been offended with brother Branham people would even draw him out of his circles and he would say well I'm going to draw you back in and some say are you gonna they didn't really they didn't really mean that he knew that that really wasn't you could have a whole sermon on offenses the Lord help us to cast out that devil cast out fences amen not be easily provoked love think is no evil don't think evil of our brother sister don't think it because Christ says I think is no evil and then what is left love love conquers all if you truly love a brother or a sister then no matter what you will overcome whatever obstacle is there amen Satan you know you can't uh you can't stop thoughts from coming thoughts will come Satan's good in this job don't you think he's not how long has he been on a job six thousand years he knows you better than you know yourself because we are man and man for six thousand years are still the same pre acher amen so what's that saying is you can't stop a bird from flying from building a nest you can stop that thought from nesting and taking root and then you just cast it out and Lord help us to cast out those thoughts because love anchors all and the bride has made herself ready oh he's coming so soon do you know that song I wanna be ready I wanna be ready to go and I've heard it so who pray till you're ready I know I'm ready oh it's a great one is this all it is oh eyes one of those songs you can go down the road singing you're not thinking about it can do it I know I'm ready to go oh Lord but it's only Christ that can make us ready to go amen and then you've got to know that you're ready to go that you've done all like it with Esther oh she she just did what what was commanded her and the rest was up to the king and that's exactly what we have to do we just do what's commanded of us and then the rest instead of Lord would you have you ever thought about the Lord 's prayer was written the vertebrates are in heaven Hall would be thy name he prayed so when we go to pray we should praise him a little bit you know my brother bran talks about climbing on our father's lap a little bit and you know hugging him and being intimate with him Lord I'm just so thankful for you you're such a good God Lord you've done so much for me you kind of rest your head on his chest a little bit and then what happened is you'll get into the spirit of Prayer and then you'll be like whoa how much time has gone by versus you know sometimes you're looking and it's hard to pray for a minute and other times time will just go because however our attitude and mentality is now talking about Redeeming the time we need to set time aside for our prayer that I'd pray all right right before I get to the bed and a lot of times I would fall asleep while I'm praying because it was the last thing I did first thing I do when I get up last thing I did and I found I better because because I have a tendency to to fall asleep and that's your flesh those are the things we got to overcome and and he wants to talk to us so spend what it is oh you know one one uh when my wife was making all these preparations I wasn't big on what color flowers had to be but she would ask hey it's right here she'd she'd asked Lord that's not pleasing you that you can see it let me know about it because you know what knowing about it is 80 of the battle then the 20 is praying and ask the Lord to take half of it but if you don't know about it how are you ever going to pray for it and it's amazing how a spirit can get on a brother and sister and we'll see it before they do a long time and it's not our business to go hey you got this Spirit on you it's more like pray for them pray for them keep praying for them and by and by the Lord will reveal it to them and Bam there it goes because there's always something in your life you know where it talks about don't cast the splinter out of your brother's eye when you you got yourself a beam a log in your own eye well you're you're doing this so I always when I say something of somebody I always think okay there's something on Me Lord I gotta where am I getting lacking that's why no matter how old you get you're still going to get worked on there's things in our lives that we still got to get worked on so we are still going to make ourselves ready until the day comes and Lord help us to do that let's all stand oh I want to be ready when he comes I want to be set in that room spotless White just be pleasing only have on what he requires that's what I want let's bow our heads precious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you Lord so much for your word today Lord Jesus and Lord thank you for letting us spend time with you Lord I pray Lord Jesus as a bride that we will be ready Lord when your day comes Lord that we won't be that uh you know there's ten virgins Lord five of them had oil they were ready but the other five they were foolish and they weren't ready they didn't have that oil Lord we don't want to be the five foolish Lord if there's things in our lives that we need to make right Lord I pray that you'll shine a spotlight on it Lord let us see it Lord we want to see you
