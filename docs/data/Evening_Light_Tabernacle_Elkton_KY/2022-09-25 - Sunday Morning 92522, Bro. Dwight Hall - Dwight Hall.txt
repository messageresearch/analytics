Psalms 24 the Earth is the Lord's in the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein who shall Ascend on into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place you shall receive the blessings from the Lord and righteousness from The Lord of his salvation lift up your hands O ye gates and be lifted up ye are the lasting doors and the king of glory shall come in goodness dub your heads oh you Gates even lift them up the Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory Selah God bless you may be seated brother Brian Warner Brothers and Sisters nor after reading the psalm like that what do you have to worry about what do you I mean really honestly what do you have to worry about you know when in the last couple of Scriptures it talks about the Everlast lasting Gates and the Everlasting doors well if you know your Bible you can think back all the way you know to a physical sense where Samson carry the gates of the city out onto the hill if God was able to do that with a man what could he do with any of us this morning whatever your circumstances are whatever problems you have whatever situations you have in your heart or in your life this morning and there's nothing that God can't deliver you from there's nothing no situation that we have this morning that God can't speak to us about this morning it all depends on your faith and how you acted on us each day um if you would come with me to uh the sixth chapter of Matthew you know we spent a lot of time worrying about things we have no control over you know we spend hours sometimes people you know everyone deals with situations and circumstances definitely you know we're not all the same God likes variety he doesn't like everything he's not trying to have a cookie cutter where everyone looks the same everyone has their own way about things but everything should be impurity with the word of God and that was uh reading the a couple of different devotionals this morning and the one was about how we spend people spend vast hours hours worrying about things like I just said not being repetitive that they have no control over um I'll I have this marked but we'll start about the 23rd verse of the sixth chapter of and uh this this is not what I'm talking about this morning but it's true but a fine eye the evil it's our whole body shall be full of darkness and you can't and just reading that simple sentence there you can't be two different things you can't be white and you can't be black you're either white or you're black you're either evil or you're righteous there's no in between There's No Gray areas in the word of God or in life and he goes on to say here no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one or love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God in Mammon you know live out there in the world and come in here on a Sunday and expect everything to be okay that that's a lot of Catholic theology there if you're if you're believing that and he goes on to say here this is the last spot I was thinking therefore I say unto you take no thought of your life for what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on it is not the life more than meat and the body more than Raymond and that goes back to the psalm uh brother Troy was reading this morning you know and he goes on to say here behold the father of the air for they sell not neither do they reap nor gather into Barnes yet the heavenly father and the feet of them and are not much more than that goes to what I'm saying this morning you know God's more than able whatever it is this morning you know to take care of it this morning God really cares I'm I can say this but you've got to believe it and I got to believe it in my own heart my real God really cares about your about you he cares about everything about you if you're giving him what he deserves he'll give you what you deserve now what I mean by that it's not a legalism it's not law or it's not but it's just a relationship with Jesus Christ out of one love and another that they do things for each other and it goes on to say which of You by taking the thought can add one cubit onto a statue and why'd you take youth off for Raymond consider the lilies of the field for they grow material not neither do they spend goes back to what I said in the beginning you know plants don't worry about growing they just grow trees don't worry about growing they just grow they're trees they grow you know animals are the same way you're the same way that you grow in spiritually you grow in the natural you grow you can't change it you just grow and that's the way it is natural for a Christian you should grow in Christ you should grow on the word of God it's just a natural just a natural thing about it and it goes on to say and what you've taken thought can add one cubit onto his statue take you thought for Raymond consider the lilies of the field how they grow and they toil need a spin knot and I know I just reread that yet I say unto you that even Solomon and all this Glory was not right like one of these wherefore if God so close the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the yavashall not he much more clothed you oh ye of little faith and I was that devotional this morning was talking about how people spent a lot of time worrying about things they can't control and it's the same for us this morning and you know I could say this today and then wake up tomorrow and have all kinds of problems and not do what I'm saying to do this morning we're all human beings we make mistakes therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal we shall be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you may need of those things you know that's the whole thing about the world we live in this morning everything everyone is striving to be reach the goals that really won't matter on that day I guess it's the older you get the things that you thought were important really don't as you get older you realize they weren't as important doesn't mean when you're 20 years old they're not important but as you get older you you know you start thinking about all the all the things you desired to do and you realize in the context of things you know we all have an appointment we have to make and it's not going to change that date any bit and I'll finish reading this and seek ye first the kingdom of God and the righteousness and all things shall be added onto you take therefore no thought of the moral for the moral shall take care of thought of the things of itself sufficient is the dead and the evil thereof and then if you would jump with me this morning the Philippians the fourth chapter here this morning looking at the time back there I'll get started again I'll just read a few of these cursors here this morning and um this is what Paul had to say you know that's what in the gospel had to say and this is what Paul had to say therefore my brother on dearly beloved long for my joy and Crown so Stand Fast in the Lord my dearly beloved and forgive my pronunciations here are deceased additives and besee synthetic that they'd be the same mind in the Lord so Paul's telling his followers to have the same mind that he has it's no different for us this morning we should have the same the same mind that was in brother by Adam should it be the same mind in us and that mind is Jesus Christ and he goes on to say here I can do all I'll ask uh man I jumped a couple of scriptures here but uh you know I entry fee also true yoke fella help them those women which label with me in the gospel Clement and also what's with my fellow laborers whose names are in the Book of Life and then he gives us some principles here it says rejoice in the lord always I again I say rejoice you know you couldn't read these scriptures enough every day in devotional just like I said these will take all that word away if God cares about you enough to give you this word of God he cares about enough to bring this about in your life and he goes on to say here rejoice in the Lord again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men and the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing and that goes what I was saying this morning about worrying Paul is telling us not to worry about anything and just put it in God's hand now I know I I'm saying this morning also but that changed that human nature and you know that human nature wants you to be concerned and worried about things you have no control over you got to fight that and goes on and God let your moderation be known unto all man the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer supplication and with Thanksgiving let your requests be known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Jesus Christ finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are on us whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever thing are lovely whatsoever things are good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things and I I was I'll just read this I'll read this a lot I know but this comes out of that uh book that brother Billy gave us years ago uh healing thoughts I don't know if you some of you still have that book but I'll I'll just read and sit down after this this morning but I I mean I I know I have a lot of inflections I say all the time I'm not trying to be repetitive but it's really important as the world you got to forget about the world out there as soon as you get out those double doors that whole world is centered on one thing just to get you to worry about things that you have no control over but I'll just read what brother had the same spiritual adoption it's this is the beginning of that book I know I say this a lot but you know I can't I just thought that it speak for itself and this is what he had to say in order to stay with God you have to stay gentle you have to fight that rough wanting to struggle and fuss with everyone's Spirit you got to be gentle doesn't say that you don't have to be firm with people you can still be firm with people and be gentle at the same time in order to stay with God stay gentle God is gentle in order to stay with God stay with love God is love you know you got to have both of those be gentle and love at the same time stay meek don't ever be self-sufficient and that's that one little short sentence right there is really hard for the day that we live in every you want to be self-sufficient everyone wants to be their own mate the own made man you know but self-sufficient I mean what he's trying to say here is that you're totally relying on Jesus Christ and everything uh always rely upon him never use your own mind again that's a hard thing to do never use your own mind take his thoughts and we know who Jesus's thoughts are it's the word of God and the message for the hour let his thoughts be your thoughts take them into your carnal mind and repeat them over and over and that one sentence right there is giving the young believer or whether he's 70 years old or whether he's 20 years old he's given you a principle right there that if you'll just do it he says I'll just reread it again never use your own mind take his thoughts let his thoughts be your thoughts take him in into your Colonial mind and repeat them over and over until they become a part of you basically what he's saying is you need to take the the word of God and which is the mind of God and his very thoughts and just repeat it over and over and over again until it becomes a part of you that's not a vain vain repetition but you're applying the word of God to your life over and over and over again until you bring it into Fruit into existence so and goes on to say so oh God take all my doubt away and let my thoughts be your thoughts and this age is very hard that his thoughts be your thoughts away the thought of thickness sickness take God's healing thoughts and let them become your thoughts and think on these things that's really important for the age that we live in think on his thoughts not just for natural healing whatever your spiritual problems are for Spiritual healing Whatever It Is God I I can't say this enough whatever it is I know that God is more than able to take care of it this morning brother David about him this morning and I'm not saying if we could and sing that little course I Love You Lord and I left my voice this morning amen oh I love I love you Lord

had prayer Wednesday night and I was telling brother Steve and they uh the the nurse I think she'd been there 15 or 18 years and she said I've never seen nothing like this before it just all and there was a little bitty spot at the bottom that they took to send off for some test work that was all that was left just enough so they could make sure I guess they were right she said I've never seen that so there's no no scar no nothing it's just it's gone all right and I said well I told my daughter-in-law I said you know we've been praying that God's will be done and I I pray for my children and I

say Lord I just can't do it but I know you can and so this is called uh baby shoes and uh of course I know you've been listening to the message you you'll know what it's about but we're just saying about it okay I think it's uh track number two is that right okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] two hearts were breaking up as one word led to another I hope that they had just seen to die [Music] hey Plus they fall they had nothing in common finally it came to a divorce now the more you said to them go home and divide the sport and this day it did and thought that they were through but I know forgotten trunk in the Attic came to mind so they rushed upstairs to see one they could find foreign [Music] but one thing caught their eyes and to their surprise [Music] then they both Reach For Those Shoes [Music] it was something that you that could not do time and With Tears in their eyes [Music] they broke their heart into [Music] maybe that for those little lazy shoes [Music] they're together again [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord now they're together again because of baby shoes they had something in common yeah I really appreciate your pastor and his sweet spirit and his sweetness and his boldness to stand on the word of God is humility and boldness you know you have to have that and I appreciate uh each one of you I I don't know you but uh but I love you and I appreciate each one of you and uh I really appreciate uh brother Sean and sister Patty taking us to the uh the great big Ark up here I had heard about it I've heard of the and now I see thee or never heard of the Arkansas I've already seen it and they we had such a wonderful time these past few days just you know we talked a lot about the word and uh we prayed and had devotions and it just everything was just timely you know and I appreciate that and uh I noticed uh the devotions this morning were so so beautiful out here and it was just like uh well that's going along with my message and it just seemed that way and so um I'm not a long-winded preacher but I just try to make it short sweet and right to the point although it it is sometimes it takes a little bit longer than short sweet right that's okay just went to school by the leading of the Lord amen but uh I'll try not to keep you too long let's go to James the fifth chapter and let's all Sam yes I see that's an automatic thing with y'all and I appreciate that it's uh you've been taught well amen I'm trusting God to really bless brother Thomas says he's out and preaching the word and I really believe that this morning if you will get a hold of this message that it you'll be surprised what it does in your life I remember preaching account meeting in Montana one time and I preached on this subject and people were getting healed left and right and uh a little humble servant and it but they took it in and so this morning let's here we go James 5 13 to 20. is any among you Afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing Psalms is is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if you have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another not just anybody see and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much Elijah was a man's subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit Brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert him let him know that he which converteth The Sinner from the era of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude sins amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the word do we have just read and we pray that you blessed as it goes forth to the hearts of your children we just thank you for the good Fellowship we had last night brother Glenn and Sherry come over and and uh my the experiences that him and brother Sean had had through the war and you watched over them and protected them and brought them out over and and I know you were protecting all of us Lord we have an angel with us so father now we just commit ourselves into your hands and we step aside in Jesus Christ's name amen and I believe you Lord is Supply ever need here amen God bless you I'd like to take a little subject and I want to call it uh Divine Healing for the obedient and I would like to Major upon obedience and uh Divine Healing is the personal property of every believing child of God that belongs to you it's the earnest of the Resurrection if there's no Divine Healing there's no Resurrection because if it can't heal you he can't raise you up and the prophet said the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise any Divine promise we'll bring it to pass and like the brother said this morning he was quoting the prophet and he said take those scriptures into your carnal mind and repeat them until they become a reality to you what do people in the natural do you know in sports and all they they are out there practicing daily aren't they and our singers or whatever they're out there in a in a uh like a generator just generating what they're going to be doing well what about us how busy we should be for the Lord amen now Divine Healing is based upon first of all Divine Healing is based upon the word of God Psalms 107 verse 20 he sent his word and healed him he spoke the world into existence didn't he I spoke he isn't that something how he spoke the word and he believed what he spoke isn't that beautiful and it came to pass now secondly Divine Healing is based upon the atonement and the atonement is the sacrifice of Jesus centers you were healed and if you were healed past tense then you are healed now present tense oh I like that yes amen hallelujah now let's go to mark 16. people might think we don't need that Mark 16 I think we do yeah Mark 16 and 15. and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth that is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover now it didn't say when they would recover he said but they shall recover and I want you to believe that with all your heart you shall recover amen now if you're prayed for you've been prayed for you've asked to be prayed for uh then the next thing is to act like you're healed even if you don't feel like you're healed and that's the way I've been doing for years my fingers was giving me a problem about the guitar I had and I and I I said and brother Brown said if you can't do nothing but wiggle your finger said wiggle it and give God praise that you're healed just go ahead and wiggle it so I've been wiggling for over five years I've been wiggling amen and saying that I'm Healed and it used to lock up he locked up and NATO Sister Anne I said pull that thing loose we was out working one day and in the yard and that thing locked up on me and she pulled it loose and when she did I went oh I mean I I wouldn't tell you how loud it was you know because oh it hurts so bad and I I went to the doctor uh not too long ago and uh he'd give me a shot of cortisone he says now it's since this has been bothering you so long since I don't know if this will work and I I said well it used to lock up on me he said it don't lock up now and he said well it must have healed itself but I knew better than that I knew God had healed me amen so I just let him say his little speech and uh because it wouldn't do no good to that at the time praise God but anyway I was acting like I'm Healed and I'm still active that I'm Healed as a matter of fact at one time in my life I thought about making a guitar special you know just a guitar tape just picking it out and the devil didn't like it see he says I'll just do you know I was trying to get him well he ain't got me yet amen praise God so she said you've got to put your faith you've got to put your faith into action you got to act like you're healed just like when I I had one promise of a paint job I told you Wednesday night I had one promise of the paint job and I jumped out on it and I went to church and I said I'm covered up with paint job and I wasn't covered up by no means but word got the word got the word they were started telling about us and before you know it two weeks later we slammed under and we had slammed under for 10 years straight years amen praise God then we slacked up a little while and I said well just get back to paint boy you know what I said I'm covered up here we here we go again covered up your words that you speak it hits the central nervous system of your body the speech nerve center and like we said Wednesday when you speak a word and say well I feel like I'm taking the flu well why can't we just say I feel like I'm taking healing well I mean I'm taking healing let's say that I'm taking healing that's better than saying I'm taking this and I'm taking this and Mama had this Daddy had this this wouldn't have this and this one had this but it's going to stop right here I ain't taking it so uh James 2 18 show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works so what he's saying is without works you can't prove you've got faith hold on and anyone can see that I have the way I act anyone can see I got faith by the way I act and so James 2 26 for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also see we have a living faith faith has to talk it's going to use your lips to do it let your faith talk amen now God told Israel how to get their land healed in second chronicles 7 14 said If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land see now ah you see God demands obedience now let's go to Acts 19. oh man acts 19. now notice this in 11 and 12. and God brought special Miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them amen now in a message called the life story the prophet said this you must never try to get anything from God without first being right with God amen and in Psalm 66 18 if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me in other words he's saying he would not have listened if I had not confessed my sins amen now and then you're instructed in this to call your neighbors pastor and notice real careful if you've got anything that's in your heart against anyone go make it right first and come back and then pray and have a prayer meeting in your home and pin this handkerchief to your underneath garment then believe God you can't have anything in your heart against anyone someone asked Billy Paul said what is the greatest Miracle you saw in in the life of William Brown he said oh the greatest Miracle he said was that no matter who his enemies were you couldn't tell if they were his enemies or not because he treated them all the same enemies and Christians he treated them all the same and think about this had such a gift in his life that one brother told him said I love you brother Byron and he said down in his heart I knew he didn't can you imagine living with that and people say well I wished I had a Ministry like that he said don't never desire a Ministry like they said you don't know what you are asking for right he said I cast them Devils out and they come back at night and haunt me that night he said I got a little battle all my own sometimes two or three hours sleep a night amen makes you think don't you I mean what little price are we paying for the Lord yeah it's like the brother was saying this morning that those devotions were so beautiful words now then believe God I remember years ago when I was Pastor in a little church in uh Belmont North Carolina had a little group there and uh there was a sister that come there her name was Hilda Chavis and uh she began to have headaches you know and and uh she went to the doctor and they found out she had a tumor on the brain uh and it was pretty hopeless and so uh I began to pray for you know and and we was all we we laid hands on and prayed for but she still ended up in the hospital that still God though still God works everything out and so I had a dream of sister Hilda and I'm glad I read about the handkerchiefs and aprons came from Paul well brother Sean I had a prayer Clause that brother Brian had prayed over and I forgot where I put it and I collect wheat pennies or I used to I ain't much in collecting pennies no more I'm getting ready to get out of here but anyway I I you know I forgot where I'd put that crack off because I wanted to take it to Hilda you know so uh I got to looking in my wheat pennies one day and I just was looking around Emmett and I've seen that prayer cloth and I thought wow I got tied up to the hospital and she said brother the whole I've got a dream I want to tell you about I said and I had already dreamed about this too she said yeah and I got one too or she's I told her what I I was fixing to tell her she said well I got a dream I want to tell you I think she told me hers first and I said well she says I saw you and two more Brothers in a and you were passing a wheat penny two more preachers and then you were passing a wheat penny to each other and said you gotta hold up and said I know who needs this Hilda and I said well you know what you know where I found this prayer cloth I found it in my wheat pennies and it's for you this is for you Hilda she put it on and it went along to she was out of the hospital completely healed Hallelujah praise God Hallelujah and I thought that was so amazing and you know brother Brown said look at us look at us in the condition we're in and look look what God does for us in the condition that we're in he said what if we were one heart and one chord just constantly thinking about the Lord constantly talking about him praying and seeking his faith as the scripture said as the scripture said he said it's untelling what God would do said we'd see all kind of things going on do you believe that I believe I'm just full enough to believe it amen that might say well brother Hall you're a fool absolutely Christ now who's fool are they amen and so anyway uh I remember this sister that was in a church she wanted me to go pray for her brother that was in the hospital and uh he was one of these uh wrestlers on TV and they called him pretty boy David it's just a you know a name they give him and he was a tough guy but he got in practice he got thrown out of the ring on top of his head that cracked his skull all the way around and he was bleeding out of his ear and they couldn't stop the blood and so I I went up there and honestly I was walking in the spirit I I was thinking about the word and I was it felt like I felt like Jesus Christ was walking in that hospital and I got into that where David was and I said um you know I approached him I'm sure I approached him by his soul and everything everything was okay and so I just want to make sure everything was right you know and so we prayed a simple little prayer and honestly I'm not just saying this it immediately stopped stop the blood stopped amen God God [Music] God did it where the doctors couldn't do it the main doctor walked in there amen the main doctor walked in now he sent his word and heal them so you so what can you do you can take this message for your healing amen whatever you need I you know I love to hear the word of God sometimes I'll be hearing it a big part of the day and sometimes I'll hear a message it seemed like I heard one message about 300 times one year because I wanted to know for I wanted to know the truth and there was something in there I needed couldn't help it I had to have it now I'm on the Hebrew series and I I you know I'm I'm stuck on here for a while and I don't care if if I've sticked the rest of my life I love it there's something about that Hebrew series when I first read that book on the Hebrew series I could city law but there's difference between law and Grace and brother Ram said law and Grace cannot exist at the same time and there was some people not too long ago trying to get me to see that we were worship on Saturday and so forth like that you know you know on me and uh and and and so when you look at the Rich Young Ruler coming to Jesus uh he said what can I do to inherit inherit eternal life you know what can I do he said well keep the Commandments they told him he said which he said well Thou shalt not kill or Thou shalt not uh commit adulthood Thou shalt honor thy father and mother but he bypassed the fourth Commandment which was to keep the Sabbath day and keep it holy he didn't tell him to keep that because why the Sabbath was already there right there God in flesh that was the true Sabbath because Jesus said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find Sabbath our rest unto your souls so we rest every day we don't just hey take Saturday off and just not do nothing hey every day is a rest day for us in COD of course we come on Sunday because we uh respect the the Resurrection Day we give honor and uh uh so many things but anyway uh let's go into the uh one little thought here about the ten lepers that came to Jesus and they said master have mercy on us can you imagine yourself as a leper and they came to Jesus and said Master have mercy on us and he told him to do one little simple thing he said show yourselves to the priest now you don't show yourselves to the priest as a leper unless you're healed but as they went in obedience with what we're talking about what are we talking about Divine Healing obedience see as they went they were healed so as you step out by faith on the word of God and just keep on keep on at it you will be healed I promise you it's God's word now another instant uh I tell you what let's go and read I've got another scripture too I want to read to you this morning uh let's go to Second Kings 5 and look at it let's look at something there Second Kings five amen oh my I just don't you just love the word of God from Genesis to Revelation to communion foreign amen here we go now second Kings five 10 to 15 to 14. now let's look at the the attitude of um of Naaman unless he has attitude changed okay all right here we go and Elisha sent a messenger unto him saying because you know he wanted to be cured of his leprosy he was a LEP and so Elisha sent a messenger unto him he didn't come out he sent a messenger saying go and wash in Jordan seven flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be claimed oh but Naaman got an attitude didn't he but Naaman was Roth and went away and said behold I thought now don't that get people in trouble well I thought the message meant this I thought the word meant that it means exactly what it says amen God don't need no interpreter he's his own interpreter and so anyway he said behold I thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper he wanted hands laid on him didn't he oh come on out here but he God had a way of doing things are not abanar and farther rivers of Damascus better than all the rivers of Israel they are not wash in them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage he must have really had a temperament oh my way in a rage and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing would us thou not have done it how much rather than when he saith clean well he finally got his cool down he finally pulled off yeah then when he down oh yeah he finally finally obeyed the word didn't he and dipped himself seven times in Jordan oh muddy Jordan according to the saying of the man of God and his flesh came again like unto the Flesh of a little child and he was clean he should have done that to begin with but he had to learn lesson I guess you know if you don't learn by your mistakes they ain't no use to make them you know really and so I got a couple more things I want to tell you praise the Lord and Mark 5 there was a man with a withered hand and Jesus said stretch forth thine hand you man that's all I got to do Lord amen and he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other by simply obeying all you got to do is obey obey what God Said and you'll be the happiest person in this world God wants you to be happy so settle up and let us go amen amen God wants you to be happy he don't want you to go around frowning he wants you to be happy you know brother Byron and sister meet he was Uptown you know one day and brother man was always saying hey how you doing hey and I don't know if you're that way but I want to meet no strangers I just like to be friendly with everybody and some people said well I'm just singing to the bride well that's good but I like to sing to the bride and whosoever will let him come and drink the water of Life freely that's what the spirit's at amen so there's children out there that's not in the bride that's his children that will make it in and so anyway they were going along hello he said maybe that sister said hello she said I said hello he said well I never heard you she said I smiled he said oh a little old possum Grand that ain't worth nothing he said you ought to speak up hello how are you shake your hand and uh I just thought I'd throw that in because it come to me so you when something comes to your mind we'll do it it's all right now I got two more scriptures let's go to Isaiah first chapter I see Isaiah first chapter verses 18 to 20. come now you know isn't it something how God always is coming on the scene about now because now Faith is and and uh and there's so many scriptures in the Bible that you can take and defeat the Devil it's like this guy wanted to be positive I was telling brother Sean he wanted to be positive he didn't want to be negative in his testimony and somebody and he was having a bad day have you ever had a bad day he was having one and somebody said how you doing I didn't want to speak negative he said uh um oh I'm having a Romans 8 28. that means all things work together for good to them that love God and he just smiled and said I'm having a Romans 8 28. praise the Lord all right come now and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be a Scarlet they should be as white as snow though they'd be absent they shall be his wool if you be willing now let you hear if you be willing there it is and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land but if you refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it amen so in one more scripture and we're getting pretty close to the close and but I want to go over here to proverbs 13. thank you you know Proverbs 13 yeah there's one scripture that that helps a pastor and it helps everyone and that is he that handleth the matter wisely shall find good sometimes you hear things going on and if you go siding in with it you better be careful he that handleth the matter wisely shall find good now I just Proverbs 13 15. I see good understanding giveth favor but the way of transgressors is hard now brother Billy Paul had got away from the Lord but bad case of ulcers he told about it and they they wanted to operate but they said we've got to have your dad's consent he said well I don't know where he's at nobody knows where he was at but God knew where he was at and he was upon a mountain God came to him and said get to Billy Paul as quick as possible when he came in the hospital and Billy said I just knew everything was going to be all right it came in the room you know were there and he looked down at Bill and he said Son the way of a transgressor's heart ain't said yes sir he I'm going to pray for you but not until you make everything right with God he said I did I made everything right with God they prayed a simple little prayer they came in they said Mr Brown we're going to have to have your authorization to operate on him he said well I tell you what you do you take him down and x-ray him just one more time just one more time just one more time they took him down and x-rayed him it was all gone totally healed praise let's praise the Lord see it's it's good to give the Lord a clap offering you know yeah and you say well I would praise the Lord if I felt like it that's not sacrificing sacrifices when you don't feel like it and you give God praise anyway you remember the little little finger wiggle it and give God praise amen amen God hallelujah but I'm so glad that I was I came this way and I believe God for each one of you if you have a need of healing I believe God touched you this morning I'm not going to say I hope he done it hope now uh I believe he did I believe he touched you amen and whatever the problem is I believe he touched you oh he touched me oh he touched me and all the joy that flood my soul something happen and now I know he touched me and made me whole let me get a key there oh since I met this blessed savior oh since he cleansed and made me whole I will never cease to praise him and I'll shout it while eternity [Music] oh he touched me [Music] [Applause] yes he touched me [Music] and all the joy that blood my soul [Music] some day he touched me and me [Music] well you know since I met this [Music] blessing sweetly to the Lord and since he cleansed and made me oh [Music] I will never see to praise him let's just lift our hands insane oh he touched me Oh You Touch Me I know the joy that floods my soul something wonderful happened and now I know he touched me and me me do you believe he touched you this morning let's pray oh Father father thank you Lord for touching each and every one here this morning no regardless how little the need was you're concerned about every little thing that touches us Lord I Thank you that one day omnipotent spoke and the miraculous took place I was trying to change in a moment twinkling of an eye all that burden of sin lifted up off of me oh thank you Lord in Jesus name yes he touched me oh he touched me and all the joints that blood my soul [Music] [Music] sing that since I met this blessed savior oh see I met this plan said savior sent deacons and name me home oh yes Lord I will never cease to praise him [Music] I'll shall be widely Turner he wrote oh he he touched me oh he touched me and all the joy that floods my soul [Music] something happened now I know he touched me and me me home amen are you glad he touched you this morning sing that little course in The Presence of Jehovah this morning and in the presence [Music] oh Jehovah [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] the king once again to him this morning oh in the presence [Music] ID thank you so be troubles [Music] [Music] oh of the key amen how many blades you've been in the presence of the king this morning amen I don't know about you but I thoroughly enjoyed it enjoyed brother Hall being with us Wednesday night and then this morning and appreciate him very much and man just pray the Lord and just bless him and amen
