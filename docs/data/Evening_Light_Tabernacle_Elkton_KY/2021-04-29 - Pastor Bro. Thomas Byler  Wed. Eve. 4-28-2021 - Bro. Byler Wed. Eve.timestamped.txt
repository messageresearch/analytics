[16:29] hey man aren't you long for that great
[16:33] reunion day
[16:34] amen i was praying this morning
[16:38] and i don't know how many of you know
[16:40] brother harold brown that we had prayer
[16:42] for
[16:42] sunday he passed away and went to be
[16:45] with the lord and
[16:46] i i began to think as i was praying
[16:50] and i was telling brother thomas and
[16:51] brother stephen then back there when we
[16:52] prayed this morning
[16:54] we moved to arkansas when i was nine
[16:55] years old and
[16:57] the herald was up there in galena and i
[17:00] guess he'd been there in that little
[17:01] town and had that little church there
[17:03] for
[17:03] over 50 years and i said you know his
[17:06] children are gonna miss him but
[17:08] some of those people that's the only
[17:10] pastor they've ever had he's been there
[17:11] for
[17:12] all those years and been solid a real
[17:14] good brother and
[17:15] just pray for that church and that
[17:18] family tonight that god will just be
[17:19] with them and
[17:20] comfort their hearts and i know
[17:24] we all know if we could see where
[17:26] they're at tonight there wouldn't be any
[17:28] sadness
[17:29] in any of us when we lose a loved one
[17:33] if we really could truly see where
[17:34] they're at but i just pray that god will
[17:37] comfort their hearts tonight and also
[17:39] continue to remember brother irvin and
[17:40] sister martha they're doing something
[17:42] better we'll remember them in prayer
[17:44] and also a friend of ours in arkansas i
[17:47] i didn't tell but the stephen we had
[17:50] prayer but
[17:50] sister marie mccomas she has pneumonia
[17:54] and they asked that the lord would just
[17:55] move on her behalf and
[17:57] she's like a lot of us and
[18:00] and the lord's just done so many great
[18:04] things in her life and i i began to
[18:07] think about it when i sing the prayer
[18:08] requests for her and
[18:10] how that she was in very very bad shape
[18:12] and
[18:13] they met up with brother branham and
[18:15] brother branham prayed for her right
[18:17] there on the streets and
[18:18] the lord just done a miracle in their
[18:20] lives and in her body and
[18:22] i began to think three years ago they
[18:24] give her up and they said she was gonna
[18:26] die and she just keeps
[18:27] marching on and she's come down the
[18:29] stemoni and i thought well lord
[18:31] if it's her time to go you'll take her
[18:33] but if not
[18:34] she definitely believes that you're a
[18:36] healer tonight so just pray for her and
[18:38] also pray for jan tomorrow we go to the
[18:42] wounds doctor tomorrow for them to look
[18:44] at her leg and

[30:58] our heads
[30:59] lord jesus we come before you father
[31:01] once again lord thank for
[31:03] god that we can assemble ourselves
[31:05] together in your name
[31:07] knowing lord jesus that wherever two or
[31:08] three are gathered in your name there
[31:10] you
[31:10] are in our midst lord and father we're
[31:13] so grateful for that and desire god that
[31:15] you'd be not only in our midst but lord
[31:17] that you would speak to our hearts
[31:18] tonight the things that you once said
[31:20] lord
[31:21] that's every effort that's been made
[31:22] that's every heart you know what's
[31:24] beneath every heart
[31:25] and father as we once again look open
[31:28] the bible and look at your word father
[31:29] we just ask god that
[31:31] your lord you would give the inspiration
[31:33] father to
[31:34] say what you once said lord tonight we
[31:37] want to remember all those that are not
[31:38] feeling well
[31:39] but that are getting better we asked
[31:41] lord did you just continue to raise them
[31:42] all up lord
[31:44] father we believe that by your stripes
[31:46] we are healed lord we thank you father
[31:48] for healing
[31:49] and lord we ask god that you just speak
[31:51] to us now in jesus christ's name
[31:53] amen and amen amen
[31:58] let's turn our bibles to revelations
[32:02] to revelations once again we're going to
[32:04] speak on the same
[32:05] kind of not the exact the same line of
[32:08] thought as we did sunday but
[32:10] it will certainly have to do with
[32:12] speaking about the purpose of god amen
[32:14] the purpose
[32:15] of god and so revelations 4
[32:20] amen and i really like this scripture
[32:28] and then also colossians the first
[32:31] chapter colossians 1.
[32:37] so col revelations 4 and we'll begin
[32:40] with
[32:43] verse
[32:47] 8 and the four beasts had each of them
[32:50] six wings about them
[32:53] and they were full of eyes within and
[32:55] they rest not day and night saying holy
[32:58] holy holy
[32:59] lord god almighty which was and which is
[33:02] and which is to come
[33:03] and when those beasts give glory and
[33:05] honor and thanks to him that sat on the
[33:07] throne
[33:08] who liveth forever and ever the four and
[33:11] twenty elders fall down before him
[33:14] that sat on the throne and worship him
[33:15] that liveth forever and ever
[33:18] and cast your crowns before the throne
[33:20] saying
[33:21] thou art worthy o lord to receive glory
[33:24] and honor
[33:25] and power for thou hast created all
[33:28] things
[33:28] and for thy pleasure they are and were
[33:31] created
[33:33] over in colossians
[33:38] you'll notice how that this certainly
[33:40] goes
[33:44] paul writing the letter to colossians
[33:47] the epistle of paul to the colossians
[33:49] and the other one of course which
[33:52] john the revelator as we call him in
[33:55] colossians 1
[33:58] and we'll begin with let's go with about
[34:07] strengthened with all might according to
[34:10] his glorious power
[34:12] unto all patience and longsuffering with
[34:14] joyfulness
[34:16] giving thanks unto the father we
[34:19] have made us meet to be partakers
[34:22] of the inheritance of the saints in
[34:24] light who have delivered us from the
[34:26] power of darkness and has translated us
[34:29] in the kingdom of his dear son
[34:32] in whom we have redemption through his
[34:34] blood even the forgiveness of sins
[34:37] and this is kind of what the point we
[34:39] want to get to talking about who jesus
[34:41] was
[34:42] who is the image of the invisible god
[34:46] the firstborn of every creature
[34:49] for by him were all things created that
[34:52] are in heaven
[34:54] and that are in earth visible and
[34:57] invisible
[34:58] whether there be thrones or dominions
[35:02] or principalities or powers
[35:05] all things were created by him
[35:09] and for him amen i mean he believes that
[35:13] he was all
[35:14] for his purpose and for his pleasure
[35:16] everything that was made was made
[35:18] for him i hate to disappoint people but
[35:21] that's the truth amen
[35:24] now notice and he is before all things
[35:26] and by him
[35:27] all things consist and he is the head of
[35:31] the body the church who is the beginning
[35:34] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[35:37] things he might have the preeminences
[35:40] amen may god add his blessings to the
[35:41] reading of the words you can be seated
[35:44] tonight amen
[35:47] god is good i'll tell you what when you
[35:50] just get god on your mind and when you
[35:52] begin to think about god and
[35:54] how great he is and and you know
[35:57] and to know what he's done in your life
[35:59] and is
[36:00] doing in your life amen it does
[36:03] something for you
[36:04] amen so sunday we talked about first for
[36:07] one thing the
[36:09] omnipotence of god and the omniscience
[36:11] of god
[36:12] how that god is all-powerful amen and so
[36:16] we know here colossians paul is telling
[36:18] the colossians there he says you know
[36:20] anything that was made
[36:22] was made by him amen whether there's
[36:26] let me just say it again
[36:30] all things were created by him that are
[36:34] in heaven
[36:35] and that are in earth visible and
[36:37] invisible
[36:39] amen not only the visible world has been
[36:42] created by him but also
[36:44] the invisible i mean what we would call
[36:47] the other dimension
[36:49] amen how many knows yet we have a
[36:51] theophany body waiting over there
[36:57] amen it's hard to fat a minute that you
[36:59] have another body waiting for you over
[37:01] there
[37:02] amen and you know and so you have one
[37:05] waiting so that if this body was to
[37:08] fail if he was to you know because we
[37:11] know the prophet says we have
[37:12] none of us none of us here sitting here
[37:15] this evening
[37:16] have a guarantee that you'll be here
[37:18] tomorrow morning
[37:20] life has absolutely no guarantee in the
[37:23] next five minutes
[37:24] amen it's all in the hands of almighty
[37:27] god
[37:28] but if you're in the hands of god and
[37:30] you know god then you know that he has a
[37:32] place for you
[37:33] is that right jesus said i'm gonna go
[37:36] and prepare a place for you amen
[37:38] so that uh and if i come again i'll
[37:40] receive you unto myself and we realize
[37:43] that jesus is going to prepare a place
[37:45] for the bride of jesus christ
[37:47] amen you don't know just what it'll be
[37:49] like none of us know just what it'll be
[37:51] like
[37:51] we know that you and i can't imagine
[37:54] what's over there waiting for us
[37:57] amen you'll have to take your last
[37:59] breath or go in the rapture to actually
[38:01] begin
[38:02] to see what's really over there and as
[38:04] we begin to talk about the purpose of
[38:06] god the plan of god
[38:08] amen it seems like in the world that
[38:10] we're living in it seems like
[38:12] the purpose and the plan of the devil is
[38:15] greater and louder and more obvious than
[38:18] what god's plan is
[38:20] am i right i mean you look around and
[38:22] you can see how
[38:23] everything's going and how it is going
[38:25] in the favor the way that the devil
[38:27] wants it to go
[38:29] in the right and it'll go the way the
[38:31] devil wants it to go
[38:33] all the way to the end all the way to
[38:34] where you and i are squeezed out amen
[38:36] the pressure comes down
[38:38] amen we know that god has a purpose god
[38:40] has a plan amen
[38:42] never never before i don't believe ever
[38:44] have we understood that plan
[38:46] better than what you and i know and
[38:48] understand it
[38:50] in this hour amen because we know that
[38:52] those seals that were
[38:54] sealed up in the book of revelation
[38:56] those seven seals that were sealed
[38:58] amen all the way to this end time amen
[39:01] a lot of the mysteries of god has not
[39:03] been made known a lot of the things
[39:05] were not known to us but i truly believe
[39:08] and know that
[39:09] in all of that when it looks like
[39:11] perhaps satan's agenda
[39:13] is is going the way that he wants it to
[39:15] go
[39:16] we know that god is doing the work i
[39:18] mean believes god is doing a work
[39:20] he has a plan and it's uh you know he's
[39:23] the beginning he's the end he knows the
[39:25] end from the beginning and
[39:26] and he knew it all nothing is a surprise
[39:28] to god
[39:31] amen he already knows exactly how it's
[39:33] all going to go
[39:34] and so now notice here i want to talk
[39:37] about and i was going to
[39:38] title this tonight the preeminent one
[39:40] the preeminent one
[39:42] amen because if you'll notice that all
[39:44] things were created
[39:45] for him amen and by him and for
[39:49] him and he is before all things and by
[39:51] him all things consist
[39:54] amen now another place you know it talks
[39:56] about how god is feeling
[39:57] he is all and in all or and in y'all i
[40:01] heard brother bam say the other day paul
[40:02] was from
[40:03] kentucky he says because he says you
[40:05] know god is in y'all
[40:08] i didn't even hear him say that before
[40:09] but i thought yeah i picked that up
[40:11] i believe it's paul he said he is in you
[40:13] all in you all
[40:14] amen so praise the lord so now notice
[40:17] here he says and he is the head of the
[40:19] body the church the beginning of the
[40:21] firstborn from the dead
[40:22] amen the firstborn from the dead that
[40:25] that in all things he
[40:28] might have the preeminences
[40:32] amen i looked that up and asked siri
[40:34] what preeminences means
[40:36] and it says the fact of surpassing
[40:40] all others amen
[40:43] superiority superiority is what that
[40:46] preeminence means
[40:48] in other words he is the one that is
[40:50] superior
[40:52] in your life and in my life amen
[40:55] in the church how many knows the prophet
[40:57] told us that you know in the bible it
[40:59] says that god
[41:00] the church is to be led not by
[41:03] man but by god
[41:06] amen god wants to lead every individual
[41:10] by the holy spirit
[41:13] praise be to god so we look at this we
[41:16] see here that
[41:17] that was the purpose of bodies that he
[41:18] wanted to brienne
[41:20] one of the preeminences in his church
[41:23] he had a multi-purpose he has different
[41:25] he had a purpose of coming
[41:27] amen and his purpose of course is
[41:30] threefold according to the prophet of
[41:31] god in christ the mystery of god
[41:33] he has a threefold purpose god did
[41:36] now let's first of all look and as we
[41:39] begin to look at ephesians the first
[41:40] chapter if you want to go with me
[41:42] we're going to kind of go through some
[41:44] scriptures tonight for just a little
[41:46] while
[41:47] and see what the lord will have for us
[41:50] amen
[41:53] and we're going to deal with just a
[41:55] little bit of the omniscience of god his
[41:57] all-knowingness and so forth at the end
[41:59] from the beginning
[42:00] he was before all things he says and by
[42:03] by him all things consist so how many
[42:06] knows he was before the first thing
[42:08] started
[42:09] and he knew everything amen if uh and we
[42:12] were
[42:12] you know been taught by the prophets of
[42:14] god that if he wasn't any thinking from
[42:15] the foundation of the world there ain't
[42:17] no way you'll ever be there
[42:19] amen because the bible says all those
[42:21] whose names were not written on the
[42:23] lamb's book of life from the
[42:24] foundation of the world wander after
[42:28] the beast amen so you begin to get
[42:31] identified you begin to get identified
[42:33] amen if you are a believer in the word
[42:35] of god it shows who you are
[42:37] and that is a marvelous thing amen
[42:40] boy i'll tell you what aren't you glad
[42:42] tonight that you understand
[42:44] amen first of all the plan of god and
[42:46] then where you
[42:47] are in that plan because it's not good
[42:50] enough just to know the plan of god or
[42:52] to understand it mentally
[42:54] but to know where you are in that plan
[42:56] and what part you are in that plan
[42:59] i want to talk about god's building
[43:00] tonight for a little while so god is
[43:02] building a building amen
[43:03] a new jerusalem he's building uh he's
[43:06] building basically heaven the
[43:07] inhabitants of the heavens
[43:09] are being built they're being made in
[43:12] the
[43:12] midst of all this the inhabitants are
[43:15] being made
[43:16] amen because we know that god wouldn't
[43:18] just go off and build us a
[43:20] house he wouldn't just go off and build
[43:22] us a beautiful place
[43:23] amen in that place be empty
[43:26] i mean please there's going to be a lot
[43:28] of folks over there amen he's going to
[43:30] build and that's what he's doing
[43:32] now let's start with ephesians 1 and
[43:34] verse 3 blessed be the god and father of
[43:37] our lord jesus christ
[43:38] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[43:41] blessings
[43:42] in heavenly places amen
[43:46] i trust that's where each and every one
[43:48] of you said tonight
[43:50] amen just sitting in that what is this
[43:53] color
[43:54] that we have
[43:58] just sitting on the bench just sitting
[44:00] in the church doesn't sit you
[44:02] in heavenly places does it now you can
[44:04] sit there and be completely
[44:08] miserable amen you can be in hellish
[44:11] places so to speak
[44:13] amen it's all about where your heart is
[44:16] amen
[44:16] where your soul is where your mind is
[44:19] amen
[44:20] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[44:23] according as he has
[44:24] chosen us and wrote our name down when
[44:27] we
[44:28] repented
[44:31] does that sound right i hear one no that
[44:33] doesn't sound right does it because a
[44:36] lot of people teach that you get saved
[44:38] and you have your names put they even
[44:40] wrote songs about
[44:41] another name was put on the book tonight
[44:44] amen
[44:44] no it was put on there a long time ago
[44:47] it was put on at all
[44:49] praise be to god y'all say sitting now
[44:52] because if you believe
[44:53] that your name was written on the left
[44:55] book of life from the foundation of the
[44:57] world
[44:58] folks you got something a lot happier be
[45:00] about you know man
[45:01] how maybe if you've got something to be
[45:03] happy about amen i was at the ballpark
[45:06] the other night listening watching my
[45:07] granddaughter
[45:09] daughter kick a ball around so
[45:12] nothing six to nothing so we weren't too
[45:14] cheerful but
[45:16] he looked over at the other ball diamond
[45:18] and there was a bunch of just little
[45:19] tots over there
[45:22] you know they were just barely can't hit
[45:24] the ball but they even
[45:26] i'll tell you what them little top they
[45:28] weren't screaming and hollering
[45:29] but the parents boy you should have
[45:31] heard them i said man we ought to
[45:33] take that game up they have a lot more
[45:34] fun over there
[45:37] parents screaming and hollering and
[45:39] carrying on i thought boy people really
[45:41] get enthusiastic about something don't
[45:43] they
[45:44] they sure will but if we got something
[45:46] i'd be happy tonight to believe that
[45:48] your name was put on that book
[45:50] amen to believe tonight by faith that
[45:52] your name is there
[45:53] amen that you he has chosen us in him
[45:57] before the foundation of the world
[46:03] how many believes you had to be in the
[46:05] premeditated thoughts of god
[46:08] he knows all things he knows the end
[46:10] from the beginning
[46:12] amen and he knowed who would and who
[46:15] would not
[46:16] because he knows what's in people's
[46:18] hearts that's why he could do it
[46:20] i don't know about you but you know you
[46:23] know i don't know about you but whenever
[46:25] i go to building a house
[46:26] it's nice to have somebody that has a
[46:28] plan
[46:29] well no i don't know how i want this
[46:31] bill well you call me when you know i
[46:34] want this place built you know because
[46:36] man it can
[46:37] you can you can spend weeks just
[46:39] designing a place right
[46:41] you can spend a lot of time just
[46:42] figuring out how you want this plate
[46:45] amen and so it has to be pre-planned
[46:47] that has to be going through
[46:48] and that's what god did before he first
[46:50] created the first thing
[46:52] is he had already figured out just how
[46:55] he wanted it all
[46:57] amen can i just preach as it comes
[47:02] reminds me of the story who uh this
[47:05] builder this
[47:05] this homeowner that wanted uh wanted his
[47:08] house built
[47:09] and he gave his plans and everything to
[47:12] the builder
[47:13] and he said build me a house when i come
[47:15] back i want my house built
[47:17] well he came back and guess what this
[47:20] little uh hut wasn't where it was
[47:22] supposed to be the closet wasn't where
[47:24] it's supposed to be
[47:25] and this wasn't supposed to be on he
[47:26] thought the builder had a better idea
[47:30] uh he wasn't too happy with all of that
[47:33] would you be
[47:34] no and see that's exactly what's
[47:36] happening with denominational people
[47:38] that put their intolerant interpretation
[47:40] of the word of god
[47:41] god says this is how i want it you know
[47:43] and when it's wrong
[47:44] he's gonna say tear that out tear that
[47:47] out
[47:47] tear that out and build it the way that
[47:49] the plan said
[47:51] i mean believe that's what we got to do
[47:52] come according to the plan of god
[47:55] because god truly wants to have the
[47:57] preeminences
[47:58] amen in our lives and if we don't build
[48:01] it right god has to tear it down
[48:04] boy i'll tell you what a child of god
[48:06] when he doesn't do what god wants him to
[48:08] do
[48:08] he's in a lot of trouble god will get
[48:12] all over you he really will because he's
[48:14] not just going to let you
[48:15] he's going to fix you
[48:19] yay i thank you lord for fixing me i
[48:22] would rather get fixed and throw to the
[48:23] side
[48:25] amen and god is going to see to it that
[48:28] we are
[48:28] the way that we're supposed to be amen
[48:31] oh i like this so before the foundation
[48:34] of the world that we should be holy
[48:37] and without blame before him
[48:41] in love amen
[48:44] how many is glad for that god wants you
[48:47] in love
[48:50] in love with him and without blame
[48:54] in front of him in love that's how god
[48:56] wants us
[48:57] having predestinated us unto the
[49:01] adoption of children by jesus christ
[49:03] to himself according to the good
[49:05] pleasure of
[49:07] our will no
[49:11] that's right people think that it's all
[49:13] about our will no it's about his will
[49:15] amen no man can even come to the father
[49:18] but by me
[49:19] no man it can come to me except my
[49:20] father draw him
[49:22] it's according to the will of god so now
[49:25] notice
[49:26] he says to the praise of the glory of
[49:28] his grace where he hath
[49:30] hath made us accepted in the beloved
[49:34] in whom we have redemption through his
[49:36] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[49:38] to the riches of his grace
[49:41] wherein has abounded towards us in all
[49:44] wisdom
[49:44] and prudence having made known
[49:48] unto us the mystery of his will
[49:52] praise be to god wow
[49:56] you realize how many generations
[49:59] people wondered what it was all about
[50:04] and here god has made it known to us
[50:06] what his will
[50:07] was what his plan was and people refused
[50:11] to believe i don't believe it
[50:14] right comes down and proves that that's
[50:17] exactly what his will is
[50:18] nah i don't believe that i don't believe
[50:22] that cain was of that wicked one
[50:24] i don't believe that seth was of god i
[50:27] don't think there's children of the
[50:28] devil and children of god
[50:30] and god has a plan and he works around
[50:33] and
[50:33] amen he manipulates wherever he wants to
[50:36] meaningfully
[50:37] amen oh yeah remember how that herod
[50:40] wanted to kill
[50:41] all of the children and the angels told
[50:43] joseph mary look
[50:45] we're going to escape this we're going
[50:46] to go on over there go on escape you
[50:48] know
[50:49] you know but listen so listen so we
[50:52] realize what his plan
[50:54] is but people still don't want to
[50:55] believe it they would rather want to
[50:56] believe that they came from
[50:58] if you want to believe that in in in
[51:01] evolution that would be up to the world
[51:03] i know nobody nobody here will
[51:06] amen or you won't be too comfortable
[51:10] isn't that right to believe that they
[51:12] came from something like that and
[51:14] rather than to believe the will of god
[51:16] he has made known unto
[51:18] us the mystery of his will according to
[51:21] his
[51:22] good pleasure which he has
[51:25] purposed in himself
[51:29] i've always said no matter how cruel no
[51:31] matter how bad
[51:32] you think the plan is i believe it's a
[51:35] good plan
[51:37] the whole thing's been a good plan
[51:42] you could get tortured every day of your
[51:45] life
[51:46] tortured burnt with fire grow through
[51:48] with wires
[51:50] whatever every day of your life you
[51:52] could get tortured
[51:53] you might say boy this is a bad no it's
[51:55] still a good plan
[51:57] because guess what if at the end of all
[51:59] of that torture you get
[52:00] eternity of perfect bliss oh it's still
[52:04] a good plan believe me
[52:05] because paul he was miserable paul lived
[52:08] a miserable life
[52:11] when jesus said i'm going to recruit you
[52:13] paul but i'm going to show you
[52:15] how great of things you're going to
[52:17] suffer for me
[52:20] huh he promised him a life of suffering
[52:24] amen and you know people don't see the
[52:27] plan of god today
[52:29] that's because god's plan is so simple
[52:34] amen how many beliefs that you would be
[52:35] led by the holy ghost
[52:37] but yet how many would say here well i
[52:39] hear the voice of god telling me hey
[52:41] you know you better you know i know that
[52:44] life's gonna turn green but
[52:46] don't go that big old truck ain't gonna
[52:48] be able to stop
[52:50] no none of us can probably say that that
[52:52] gonna happen right we don't
[52:54] have a live voice telling us those
[52:56] things
[52:59] if you do raise your hand say well i've
[53:01] heard the verb
[53:02] no but what is it there's something down
[53:04] in here isn't it
[53:06] there's a still small voice that tells
[53:09] us things
[53:10] sure it does happens to me all the time
[53:13] little quiet voice will say something
[53:15] if i listen to that voice hello most of
[53:18] the time
[53:18] i'm very glad i did
[53:21] hello how many of you can say that when
[53:23] you don't listen to that voice
[53:25] and that certainly is a problem with a
[53:27] lot of us
[53:28] not being led by the spirit is we ain't
[53:30] got a scented enough spirit
[53:33] we're not close enough to god to hear
[53:35] that little voice
[53:36] speak to us so if you don't get nothing
[53:39] out of service tonight say god that's
[53:41] what i want
[53:42] i want to get more sensitive so that i
[53:43] can hear that voice because you do
[53:45] lead us by that i mean he does want to
[53:47] lead us by the holy ghost
[53:49] he really does and that's how he leads
[53:52] oh he can he can speak to you verbally
[53:54] he sure can or he can speak to you
[53:57] by reading the bible and oh that's what
[54:00] i need right there
[54:02] or he can do it through the ministry a
[54:05] lot
[54:05] very very let me say this very very
[54:08] very very very very very very you got
[54:11] this very
[54:12] very likely god's going to speak to you
[54:14] through the mystery ministry
[54:16] huh that's right i believe it because
[54:18] that's what i tend to find full ministry
[54:20] for what
[54:21] the perfecting of the saints so god's
[54:24] going to work through that five-fold
[54:25] ministry
[54:26] but he can do it through the bible he
[54:28] can through the whirlwind in the tree if
[54:30] he wants to talk to you
[54:31] but god does speak to his church god
[54:33] does lead his church
[54:35] and church i'm telling you that was his
[54:37] ultimate goal as
[54:39] should i say the second goal that god
[54:41] had was to get the preeminences
[54:44] in his people
[54:47] amen christ the mystery of god brother
[54:49] braham said there's a threefold mystery
[54:51] that god had
[54:52] purpose that god had amen and the first
[54:54] thing what he wanted to do
[54:56] was reveal himself to his people
[55:00] it meant he wanted to show us what his
[55:01] plan was i mean believes that
[55:04] amen now notice and the first one to
[55:08] show himself who really this god that
[55:10] knows everything
[55:11] this god that created the moon and the
[55:13] stars this god that is a mission
[55:15] all-powerful
[55:16] this god that is out there the first
[55:18] thing he wanted to do was show us
[55:21] what he is like
[55:24] huh israel was scared to death of this
[55:28] god
[55:31] remember whenever they uh uh when god
[55:34] told moses i'm gonna come on top of
[55:36] mount sinai you know
[55:37] i'm gonna speak to the people but if
[55:39] anybody crosses this line you get too
[55:42] close to me
[55:43] with your sinful life with your sinful
[55:45] heart you get too close into my presence
[55:48] i will kill you isn't that what he said
[55:52] you will be dead so don't cross that
[55:54] line it's your own life
[55:57] amen and whenever god did talk remember
[55:59] it was a roared and thundered and scared
[56:02] the people to death
[56:04] and after that if i'm not wrong it was
[56:06] after that that the people said
[56:08] let moses speak and not god and god says
[56:11] that's how i'm going to do it from here
[56:12] on out
[56:13] i'm going to speak through a prophet i'm
[56:14] going to use god's mouth peace
[56:16] my peace will be through humanity
[56:20] amen and the prophet always
[56:23] also taught us that the hardest thing
[56:25] for one human to do
[56:27] is to listen to another human huh
[56:34] i wonder why that is well partially
[56:36] because we both had a brain
[56:39] we both can figure things out and we're
[56:42] quick to say well i don't know about
[56:43] that
[56:44] i got a better idea i think it's this
[56:47] way
[56:48] huh sure we tend to be that way don't we
[56:52] so he says it's hard for him to get to
[56:54] listen to another that's why how many
[56:56] believes that's why
[56:57] you need god behind and backing a person
[56:59] up
[57:00] so that you can have confidence hey i
[57:02] believe that
[57:03] amen i believe that man i believe that
[57:06] prophet i believe that pastor i believe
[57:07] that evangelist
[57:09] i believe it ever coming by so the
[57:12] purpose was the first purpose that he
[57:13] had
[57:14] was show what this god is really
[57:18] like amen
[57:21] praise be to god let me see if i can
[57:24] find
[57:26] that scripture
[57:32] yes in colossians chapter 1 and verse 15
[57:36] it says that jesus was the listen
[57:40] he was the uh he was the image of the
[57:44] invisible god how many believes that's
[57:47] who jesus what
[57:48] jesus was the image of the
[57:52] invisible god the firstborn of every
[57:55] creature for by him all things that were
[57:56] made that was made
[57:58] god was completely and totally expressed
[58:02] in jesus christ
[58:05] and when he came if you'll notice
[58:08] the pharisees were legalistic they they
[58:11] wanted to abide by the law
[58:13] just like paul did you know hey if you
[58:15] get caught
[58:16] in this that or the other let them stone
[58:18] them if you you know if you take your
[58:20] neighbor's stuff
[58:20] and you got to restore fivefold and all
[58:22] these other stuff they were legalistic
[58:25] so they tried to trap jesus when that
[58:27] woman was caught in the very act they
[58:29] brought
[58:29] what hurt before him and had their
[58:32] stones ready and said now the law says
[58:35] that you know she is to be stoned
[58:40] amen but jesus said something i will
[58:42] have mercy
[58:44] amen go figure out what that means i
[58:46] will have mercy
[58:48] amen different times he says go figure
[58:50] out what this scripture means
[58:52] because there's going to be a
[58:53] dispensation of grace a dispensation of
[58:56] mercy and forgiveness
[58:57] and so god in jesus was expressing at
[59:00] that time
[59:01] of the mercy and the grace dispensation
[59:04] because how many knows that
[59:05] all of that stuff going on out there
[59:07] right now it's all under the mercy of
[59:09] god
[59:11] sure it is that blood that covers the
[59:13] earth didn't prophetic god said
[59:15] if that ever blood ever goes it'll be
[59:18] all over that even your sins even my
[59:20] failed faults and failures they come up
[59:22] there and it works as a buffer
[59:24] it won't go on up to god because why
[59:26] that blood
[59:27] is there but if that blood wasn't there
[59:30] it would be judgment
[59:33] so he began to express love for god's
[59:35] love the world and everything that jesus
[59:37] did he was the perfectly expressed
[59:40] image of almighty god that was his one
[59:43] number one priority
[59:44] and when everybody saw that they had to
[59:46] wonder even nicodemus
[59:48] had to say we know that you are from god
[59:51] because nobody could do these things
[59:53] unless they were a god
[59:58] those pharisees you know even nicodemus
[1:00:00] expressed
[1:00:02] the hypocrisy of the pharisees because
[1:00:05] they knew
[1:00:07] they couldn't let rattle he could have
[1:00:09] never raised lazarus
[1:00:11] four days in the grave unless god was
[1:00:13] with him
[1:00:14] the devil just can't do that stuff an
[1:00:17] evil person just can't do that stuff
[1:00:21] the devil can't raise people from the
[1:00:23] dead only god can raise people from the
[1:00:25] dead
[1:00:26] and so they had all kinds of stuff in
[1:00:28] their minds and all of that stuff in
[1:00:30] their minds their jealousy and
[1:00:32] their pride and all that'll be brought
[1:00:34] up on the day of judgment isn't it right
[1:00:36] that'll all be brought out
[1:00:38] you knew you knew
[1:00:43] boy oh boy i'll tell you what it you
[1:00:46] know
[1:00:47] can that be a lesson for us that when
[1:00:50] you know something's wrong
[1:00:51] you do it anyway remember you're not
[1:00:53] going to get away with that
[1:00:54] that's not going to work god doesn't
[1:00:55] accept that
[1:00:57] no you got to have a clean conscience
[1:00:59] when the holy spirit tells you something
[1:01:01] you better heed it amen
[1:01:06] because it'll be played back on the day
[1:01:07] of judgment and you don't i don't know
[1:01:09] about you
[1:01:10] but i don't want to be on the wrong side
[1:01:11] of judgment i want to be on the right
[1:01:13] side
[1:01:14] of judgment okay so that was the first
[1:01:18] first ambition first goal that god had
[1:01:21] is
[1:01:21] i'm going to let humanity understand and
[1:01:24] to know what this great god is like
[1:01:26] and what do we find that this great god
[1:01:29] was like
[1:01:30] he was a god of not killing everybody
[1:01:33] and genocide murder he was god of love
[1:01:38] even bob says god is love
[1:01:41] amen how many knows he couldn't truly
[1:01:44] love you unless he made a
[1:01:45] way for you to have pardon
[1:01:48] that's why he went to the cross because
[1:01:50] he loved and so he made a way for
[1:01:52] humanity
[1:01:55] he made a way for us to be reconciled
[1:01:58] back
[1:01:58] to god again through the cross of
[1:02:01] calvary
[1:02:01] that was his purpose that was the first
[1:02:03] purpose of his coming
[1:02:05] amen and the whole purpose of god
[1:02:06] because all the way from genesis he
[1:02:09] talks about the seed
[1:02:10] bruising his heal and so forth the seed
[1:02:12] that was to come and israel for
[1:02:14] oh my all of those years look for his
[1:02:17] coming
[1:02:19] amen
[1:02:23] all right let me try to hold that
[1:02:24] thought and pick it back up again
[1:02:27] of jesus how that god came to express
[1:02:30] god
[1:02:30] i'm thinking today you know of how long
[1:02:33] it seems like that the plan and the
[1:02:36] purpose of god is
[1:02:37] like a long time so i thought 2 000
[1:02:41] years peter for 2
[1:02:42] 000 years now that sounds like a lot
[1:02:45] doesn't it huh
[1:02:49] that sounds like a lot but
[1:02:53] if parish was here perhaps or somebody
[1:02:56] that's up in their 90s and
[1:02:57] you think about how one lifetime perhaps
[1:03:01] if you live to be
[1:03:02] 100 years old right and that one man
[1:03:06] lives a hundred years old and then pick
[1:03:08] up another person and they live a
[1:03:10] hundred years old right
[1:03:11] a thousand years is only ten men's lives
[1:03:17] seems a lot shorter don't it two
[1:03:19] thousand years would only be twenty
[1:03:21] men's lives
[1:03:22] only twenty men's lives if they lived to
[1:03:24] be a hundred
[1:03:26] that's not so long is it that doesn't
[1:03:29] sound near as long
[1:03:31] because how many knows you know as we
[1:03:33] get older this life
[1:03:34] is really short it went really bad by
[1:03:36] really fast
[1:03:38] and to think that we're about to go into
[1:03:41] third phase of god's plan is the glory
[1:03:43] thing
[1:03:44] so anyway think about it so jesus come
[1:03:46] he paid the price we found that it was
[1:03:48] love and so forth
[1:03:49] amen how could we ever understand this
[1:03:52] great god who covered
[1:03:53] all time covered all space the great
[1:03:56] knowledge that he had
[1:03:58] hey i don't know about you but i still
[1:04:00] ain't got an even close to figure it out
[1:04:02] have you
[1:04:04] no no i still don't understand
[1:04:07] all this you can't understand god
[1:04:10] he's just way too great
[1:04:15] i'm just so glad to be a part of him
[1:04:17] aren't you just glad that he's working
[1:04:19] on you
[1:04:20] that he is shaping you and getting you
[1:04:23] ready for what lays ahead
[1:04:25] in the midst of all that's going on yeah
[1:04:28] that's right in the midst of our busy
[1:04:30] busy every day
[1:04:32] god is working on us
[1:04:35] amen
[1:04:39] so now notice so now notice he was
[1:04:41] father he was son he was holy ghost now
[1:04:43] he what did he wanted to do he loved
[1:04:45] fatherhood sure he loved to be the
[1:04:46] father in the old testament
[1:04:48] but he had to become the son of man and
[1:04:50] that becomes
[1:04:51] you know son of man in order to really
[1:04:53] express who he was
[1:04:55] amen and identify himself and reveal to
[1:04:58] the human race what he really was
[1:05:00] and now notice the second thing that he
[1:05:02] wanted the second thing
[1:05:04] that he wanted was to have the
[1:05:06] preeminence in his body of believers
[1:05:11] how many believes that's what he wants
[1:05:12] tonight
[1:05:21] that's what he's striving that's what he
[1:05:22] really wants
[1:05:25] he and he is the head of the body the
[1:05:28] church
[1:05:29] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:05:32] the dead
[1:05:34] that in some things he might have the
[1:05:38] preeminence
[1:05:40] a little bit of us he can have the
[1:05:42] preeminence
[1:05:43] that in all things
[1:05:47] he can have the preeminence
[1:05:50] how many knows that every time you go
[1:05:52] off do your own thing or do something
[1:05:53] you ought to do and
[1:05:54] you know that's still you in there
[1:05:57] that's not him having the preeminences
[1:05:59] yet
[1:06:02] i was laying on the bed the other day
[1:06:03] and i looked down at my foot
[1:06:05] i was like look at that there's my foot
[1:06:09] there's my toes i got shoes on tonight
[1:06:11] this is it amazing got it
[1:06:13] when my mind says toe wiggle there it
[1:06:16] goes
[1:06:21] you know i mean it just it just does
[1:06:24] it's so perfect
[1:06:25] can you imagine whatever god hooked up
[1:06:28] whatever however he did it
[1:06:30] you know i mean it's almost it's so
[1:06:32] instantaneous
[1:06:34] you know i mean the second your mind
[1:06:37] tells you to do it does it
[1:06:38] you know and that's the way that god
[1:06:41] wants how many knows he's the head of
[1:06:42] the church
[1:06:43] he's our head
[1:06:46] that's how quick we should be to react
[1:06:50] when god tells us something or when he
[1:06:52] wants us to move
[1:06:55] just automatically move because he truly
[1:06:58] is the head we are the body
[1:07:01] amen i believe it we don't have the
[1:07:05] cloud up here do we but it was the cloud
[1:07:08] and brother bam says how that is our
[1:07:09] head
[1:07:10] that's christ he's our head his body is
[1:07:13] here on the earth
[1:07:15] but his head the head is in heaven that
[1:07:18] right
[1:07:18] it's over in that other dimension and we
[1:07:22] are his body
[1:07:24] amen god is building his
[1:07:27] church all right so the second was that
[1:07:30] he might
[1:07:31] have the preeminence in his believer
[1:07:33] that is his bride
[1:07:34] that he might live in his people when
[1:07:37] jesus walked on the earth everybody
[1:07:39] could just
[1:07:40] well even even john the baptist said
[1:07:42] behold
[1:07:44] behold behold
[1:07:47] the lamb of god that takes away the sin
[1:07:50] of the world
[1:07:52] behold the messiah the woman that ran
[1:07:54] into the city said
[1:07:56] isn't this the messiah the messiah is
[1:07:58] here
[1:07:59] is that right behold look at what it is
[1:08:03] amen when oh my when he raised lazarus
[1:08:05] from the dead and the multitudes
[1:08:08] followed him and
[1:08:09] oh he had everybody's attention isn't
[1:08:11] that right because people were seeing
[1:08:12] god
[1:08:13] among men even that young man that had
[1:08:17] his eyes
[1:08:17] opened in the fears he said you know who
[1:08:20] is this man that opened his eyes and so
[1:08:22] forth and
[1:08:22] he said jesus opened my eyes
[1:08:25] and the pharisees yeah right we don't
[1:08:27] notice jesus and from where he is
[1:08:32] just opened himself up the young man
[1:08:35] says well now
[1:08:36] isn't that something you're the
[1:08:38] spiritual leaders you got your
[1:08:40] your next doll your clothes just right
[1:08:43] you're the spiritual leaders of the day
[1:08:45] and here comes somebody and that opens
[1:08:47] my
[1:08:47] heart and you don't know where he is
[1:08:51] don't sound like me or doing your job
[1:08:53] right brother it don't sound like you're
[1:08:55] doing what you're supposed to be doing
[1:08:57] you ought to know where this guy's from
[1:09:00] amen yeah you can cast me out of your
[1:09:02] church because i probably don't want to
[1:09:04] be there anyway
[1:09:06] all right not if you don't know where
[1:09:08] this man comes from he'll sick and raise
[1:09:10] the dead
[1:09:11] huh go back home
[1:09:14] repent need to be following him too just
[1:09:17] get him good
[1:09:20] you love him tonight
[1:09:23] all right so behold they looked at god
[1:09:26] with us the affairs of the disciples
[1:09:30] followed him everywhere they believed
[1:09:32] him and
[1:09:32] oh my when everybody else forsook him
[1:09:34] and said will you go also and they said
[1:09:36] no
[1:09:37] you're all alone i have the words of
[1:09:38] eternal life peter didn't want him
[1:09:40] talking about
[1:09:41] leaving and all of that no we want you
[1:09:43] to stay here we want you to restore this
[1:09:45] without no it's not
[1:09:46] no i need to go he said i need to go
[1:09:48] it's expedient
[1:09:49] it's necessary that i go in the right
[1:09:52] it was needful that he went because the
[1:09:56] next thing that god wanted to express
[1:09:58] was what he wanted to express
[1:10:02] what jesus looks like through his
[1:10:05] children amen
[1:10:09] that's why sunday i brought brother
[1:10:11] stephen up here should be able to
[1:10:13] prayed so to speak any one of us up here
[1:10:17] and be able to say look at this person
[1:10:18] right here this is jesus son
[1:10:22] this is jesus's daughter amen
[1:10:27] because i'll tell you how many knows as
[1:10:28] you do your work as you go live here as
[1:10:30] you do
[1:10:31] whatever it is that's what people seeing
[1:10:34] people are seeing jesus in his
[1:10:37] children they're seeing
[1:10:41] god expressed
[1:10:47] think about that for a minute think
[1:10:49] about that for a minute
[1:10:53] really brand everybody sees us
[1:10:56] every encounter people have with us
[1:10:59] we express jesus
[1:11:04] makes you humble donut makes you want to
[1:11:07] say lord jesus
[1:11:08] help me to be a good reflection let me
[1:11:12] be
[1:11:12] a good reflection and i think this is
[1:11:15] the part brothers and sisters that
[1:11:16] tonight
[1:11:17] is the most important part for you and
[1:11:19] for me isn't that right
[1:11:21] if he truly wants the pre emptiness
[1:11:24] of my and i can't sometimes we get
[1:11:27] preaching brother
[1:11:28] we get down there the inspiration and we
[1:11:30] can speak things by the holy ghost and
[1:11:32] so forth you know
[1:11:34] i know people pentecost and those that
[1:11:35] could give themselves to that spirit
[1:11:37] they could speak in tongues and duty
[1:11:38] things
[1:11:39] no right the prophet of god
[1:11:43] was so yielded he was so in tune with
[1:11:46] god doing god's will
[1:11:48] amen until he could stand here and he
[1:11:50] began to talk
[1:11:51] he says now that's not my voice not
[1:11:54] right
[1:11:55] as soon as he would begin his sermon it
[1:11:57] was always god
[1:11:58] taking him over and having the
[1:12:00] preeminences
[1:12:02] that's why that discernment was
[1:12:05] never ever wrong
[1:12:10] amen i
[1:12:14] defy these hypocrites
[1:12:18] these devil possessed people that now
[1:12:19] that he's gone
[1:12:21] dare to try to say he was wrong about
[1:12:23] this and that
[1:12:25] all right because i've gotta lo i love
[1:12:30] i'd love for him to be here and for you
[1:12:32] to come up
[1:12:33] and say that yeah
[1:12:37] because they would never do it no but
[1:12:39] now he's gone they have the courage to
[1:12:41] run their mouth but let me tell you
[1:12:44] something you speak
[1:12:45] one word against god's prophet whom he
[1:12:48] has sent proven
[1:12:50] and vindicated isn't that right jesus
[1:12:53] himself would come down
[1:12:54] and back him up and then you speak about
[1:12:57] that and speak evil of that
[1:12:59] you will not go unaccount i'm not
[1:13:01] accountable
[1:13:03] amen but so much so
[1:13:06] and then people would say well that's
[1:13:08] what jesus is with the woman at the way
[1:13:09] he deserved their thoughts and intents
[1:13:10] at our heart
[1:13:12] you know pronounced some heal one little
[1:13:14] girl had
[1:13:15] i don't i'm not sure just exactly how it
[1:13:17] was but i know she couldn't see
[1:13:19] i'm not sure if she even had eyeballs
[1:13:22] and he prayed for her
[1:13:23] isn't that right and she had eyeballs
[1:13:26] and then he said well wait a minute he
[1:13:28] says now
[1:13:29] what color eyes would you like
[1:13:36] i don't know about you that still does
[1:13:37] something to me it'll always do
[1:13:39] something to know
[1:13:40] that our god that we talk about came and
[1:13:42] did things like that among us
[1:13:44] to know that it's god almighty amen
[1:13:48] no man could do that brother brahm could
[1:13:50] never do that
[1:13:52] but if he yields himself to god god can
[1:13:55] do that
[1:13:56] how many believes that tonight if we
[1:13:58] will yield ourselves of
[1:14:00] more than what we are ask ourselves does
[1:14:03] god have
[1:14:04] all the preeminences in our lives or is
[1:14:07] there still some of me in there
[1:14:11] hey my hands up i i gotta admit there's
[1:14:14] still some of me
[1:14:16] in there i truly be their s but i say
[1:14:19] god i surrender all
[1:14:21] help me not to have any of me in there
[1:14:24] god has the most peculiar ways of
[1:14:27] bringing that
[1:14:28] out in you amen and showing you
[1:14:32] whether they're still things since
[1:14:34] there's still some of you
[1:14:35] in there so it says that in
[1:14:39] all things he might have the
[1:14:43] preeminences amen and i truly believe
[1:14:46] that as a body speaking as a
[1:14:49] body because brother branham whenever
[1:14:52] the
[1:14:53] discernment came remember this that he
[1:14:55] taught
[1:14:56] that martin luther was part of that body
[1:14:58] and he all he had was the judge shall
[1:15:00] live a faith
[1:15:01] that right that was in the feet area in
[1:15:04] that right feet part of the body
[1:15:06] amen and then up comes john wesley
[1:15:08] sanctification now you gotta have to be
[1:15:09] sanctified
[1:15:10] amen and he talked about here and oh no
[1:15:12] it became pentecost and all of a sudden
[1:15:14] that
[1:15:15] speaking in tongues the gift of tongues
[1:15:18] came back isn't that right
[1:15:19] and then when we come up a little bit
[1:15:21] higher and then we had a prophet a seer
[1:15:24] eyes that could tell you the future
[1:15:26] could tell you the past tell you what
[1:15:28] germany's going to do
[1:15:29] what hitler is going to do he's going to
[1:15:31] uh you know all of these
[1:15:32] different powers are going to do amen
[1:15:36] talk about the car that can drive by
[1:15:39] itself and all of this
[1:15:40] amen the eyes of being able to tell
[1:15:42] people what's wrong with them and
[1:15:43] everything else
[1:15:45] and he says you know as uh the
[1:15:48] the body was coming closer to perfection
[1:15:51] closer to the perfection
[1:15:53] more like christ more like christ it was
[1:15:55] a restoration
[1:15:56] and as a body we've had the perfect
[1:15:59] reflection of jesus christ
[1:16:02] with complete
[1:16:05] of jesus christ in that body or can we
[1:16:09] say at least a portion of that body
[1:16:11] because i do know that belief that it's
[1:16:13] got to be in all of the body
[1:16:14] amen the whole body you and i include it
[1:16:17] because we are a part of that body
[1:16:20] amen and day without us cannot be made
[1:16:22] perfect
[1:16:24] what was the last part beyond the eyes
[1:16:26] where did we go beyond the eyes
[1:16:29] huh because even the pentecostals even
[1:16:33] the pentecostals
[1:16:35] hey they would come to the meetings they
[1:16:36] would support the service as long as
[1:16:38] there was healing going on
[1:16:39] discernment and going on but when it
[1:16:41] came to this part here
[1:16:43] where what is that your brain
[1:16:46] your mind
[1:16:50] the mind that's when the seven seals
[1:16:52] were open
[1:16:53] and the mind of god was made open we
[1:16:56] understood
[1:16:57] where denominational is from and it's
[1:16:59] actually a mark of the beast
[1:17:01] it's actually the catholic church is the
[1:17:04] mother of harlots
[1:17:05] and any church that goes astray away
[1:17:07] from the word of god
[1:17:09] is a prostitute amen
[1:17:12] and he began to open that stuff up he
[1:17:14] began to say no
[1:17:15] i seen which doctors speak in tongues
[1:17:18] have pens
[1:17:19] writing unknown tongue and unknown
[1:17:21] tongues and interpret and so forth
[1:17:23] so don't tell me speaking in tongues is
[1:17:24] the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:17:26] the bible don't tell that that's what
[1:17:28] denominations what they made out of it
[1:17:30] in the right
[1:17:30] and when he's brought out the truth of
[1:17:33] it all
[1:17:34] they couldn't take that anymore they
[1:17:36] rejected the mind part of it
[1:17:39] amen the truth the word the opening of
[1:17:41] the seals they rejected that
[1:17:43] amen but what is it i was just
[1:17:47] in closing i just wanted to show you
[1:17:48] that as far as the body part
[1:17:51] we have had such a reflection in the
[1:17:53] body
[1:17:54] of jesus christ until brother branham
[1:17:57] had to straighten him up
[1:17:58] just like john the baptist they came to
[1:18:00] john the baptist says are you the
[1:18:01] messiah
[1:18:02] he says no there's one standing among
[1:18:05] you that i'm not worthy of the losing
[1:18:07] his shoot i am the voice of one care i
[1:18:09] knew in the wilderness and they almost
[1:18:10] took john the baptist perhaps
[1:18:12] as being a messiah and it was the same
[1:18:14] way with the prophet of god because look
[1:18:16] at the prophet of god in this generation
[1:18:18] how did god would you have discernment
[1:18:20] and do the messiah
[1:18:21] sign hundreds and thousands of times and
[1:18:23] people tried to make brother branham god
[1:18:27] isn't that right you are jesus you're
[1:18:30] christ
[1:18:30] he says don't you ever do it i'll come
[1:18:32] off the field
[1:18:33] and i won't preach anymore and all of
[1:18:35] that will be on you
[1:18:37] if you don't stop that because if you
[1:18:39] make me christ you make me an
[1:18:41] antichrist he says don't call me dr
[1:18:44] branham don't call me dr reverend this
[1:18:46] that or the other
[1:18:47] if you love me just call me brother
[1:18:49] because i am just your brother
[1:18:51] that's where the prophet of god stayed
[1:18:53] he stayed down in the damascus
[1:18:55] dust he didn't have to have a title he
[1:18:58] didn't have to have a great big name
[1:19:00] he's just a sinner saved by grace no
[1:19:03] better
[1:19:03] than the man that was saved yesterday
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:07] a perfect reflection because there was a
[1:19:09] perfect preeminence
[1:19:11] of the holy spirit in his life how many
[1:19:14] believes that before we go
[1:19:16] the holy spirit will have that in your
[1:19:17] life he'll have that in my life
[1:19:21] he'll have the perfect preeminence god
[1:19:24] bless you let's stand
[1:19:29] musicians if you would come
[1:19:35] how many believes that the lord sees
[1:19:37] your heart
[1:19:38] he knows what you're thinking and how
[1:19:41] many would just say to the lord lord
[1:19:42] jesus i really do
[1:19:44] need to let you have more preeminences i
[1:19:47] want to give you
[1:19:48] every all preeminences in my life

[1:19:57] wife my children
[1:19:58] my neighbors wherever i am whatever it
[1:20:00] is i want you
[1:20:02] to have complete preeminences in my life
