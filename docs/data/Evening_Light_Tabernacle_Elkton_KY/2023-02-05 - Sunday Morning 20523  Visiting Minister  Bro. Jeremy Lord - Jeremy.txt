let's just sing Amazing Grace as our brother comes uh Amazing Grace [Music] [Music] two walls [Music] hey man it's good to be the house Lord isn't it where would you want to be there's no place else I'd want to be than to be found at the poster Duty when Christ comes back wouldn't that be great to we're rejoicing in his name singing praises to Him thinking about all the things that he's done for us and Christ comes back oh that would be a tremendous thing for that to happen right now and we're so close it's it could happen this morning it could happen 10 years from now but I don't see that but you know what I never thought that we'd see 2023 either I am amazed that we're here but it's all in God's hands and the only thing I want to be doing is just getting deeper and deeper in the love of Jesus that's where I want to go if you would let's turn in our Bibles while we're standing let's go to Acts chapter one I love getting into his word I love reading his word and one of the things I always Pray when I'm out here or even when I'm by myself I'm always like because if you're excited you'll go back and you can't wait to get back to it but if you're not into it you'll fall asleep reading I've done it you your mind will start one pondering so I always pray Lord make me excited about what I'm reading mix something pop out to me amen Acts chapter 1 . let's talk with first until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given Commandments into the apostles whom he had chosen verse 3 to whom also he showed himself alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs being seen numbers for and being a sin making the scripture personal right now amen commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which says T yeh verse 5 and for John truly baptized many days hence I like to speak wait until that's our heads precious Heavenly Father Lord we're asking you Lord once more Lord to come down and no what's your word Lord once more make us exciting Lord make us at the edge of our sea anticipating to hear from you Lord we'd love to see our brothers and sisters but our main objective is to see you and to hear from you and Lord we ask you to open up your word to US Open up our ears open up our hearts to receive Lord me included Lord because every time we speak Lord It's you spot speaking to all of us let me just be a microphone Lord that you can speak through we ask this in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated amen so I've always I've read them many many times and I love it when Small Things pop out at you because you know that they waited until in the upper room you know they heard this and I always thought okay that's where they waited but that's not where Jesus told him to wait in the upper room I thought they stayed there the whole time that's not what it says it says that they should not depart from Jerusalem doesn't say stay in one building that says stay in Jerusalem okay so when you look at Jerusalem you know because you know back then they didn't have you're talking they didn't act he didn't actually tell him it's gonna be 10 days it just happened to be 10 days because they had to eat you know that's a long time to fast you had to go to the bathroom they didn't have indoor plumbing that it's actually Jesus it is the Prince of Peace the city of peace and so if you take it to us now the promise here was to be baptized with the Holy Ghost your promise you could already have the Holy Ghost but it could be your healing it could be your healing your salvation for your loved ones it could be you wait in Jesus until that's where our rest is that's where our pieces that's where everything that we have it's in Jesus and then when that promise speaks to you you wait until you get it and we are in a microwave age you gotta can't wait somebody had a stoplight that you're behind it turns green and they sit there for two seconds baby you know you want to like come on it's green but we have to wait until there's there's patience you know when you go to a restaurant where's my food just wait until it's in we have to the patience it's it stretches from from spiritual to Natural and the more that you are like Jesus this the more that you or your patients will just be an ending they will have days we're irritable we'll have days that we we aren't patient as we need to be but that's why we come back and say Lord forgive me Lord help me to be more like you and and that's why there's there's one true feeling but there's many refillings along the way and Lord help us to keep going back for that refill and wait until you yeah refilling whatever um you know our Our Lives because we do collect things that shouldn't be here but that's where the Lord will have mercy and Grace on us and say hey clean that up do this do that sharpen that if the very first that doesn't know that but that's why it was where Melchizedek was the king of exact same city and we know who machesadic was so that's Jesus Jesus stay in peace amen this is uh uh from you don't need to turn here if you want to it's a Revelations 11 8. I'll just kind of paraphrase it it's also from where the brand talks about an epistle it says in their bodies shall lie in the street of that great City spiritually called Sodom and Egypt now that's talking about Jerusalem in Revelations where their bodies are laying that and it's calls that spiritually speaking it says it's um Sodom and Egypt now how can the city of peace be named spiritually speaking Sodom and Egypt look at our church es today spiritually speaking the Great now I want to say that we as a message Church aren't exempt from that we we got to stay on fire we got to keep our lands trimmed otherwise we're just going about the emotions we don't want to go about them the Motions we want we want to be on fire I don't want to be called spiritually Sodom and and eat I I don't want that I want to be known as this as the the Church of the Living God and and we are the Church of the the temple we are the temple and wherever we go I love it no matter wherever I travel you can feel the same spirit because it's Jesus here as it is in Indiana is it in Pennsylvania it's in Arizona it doesn't matter it's Jesus and why is it because you bring him is not this feeling it's just says pray the Lord for a building to give us to come worship out of the snow and the rain he answers on but you are the building they they could close down this church and we could still have church at somebody's house in somebody's garage we are the building oh it's a tremendous thing Lord help us and you know you may only have a little lick of fire well I'm insignificant Satan will tell you all kinds of things but you join your look of fire with so you're like a fire and you're looking fire and all these like a fires come together what a fire we have but you know what we gotta join together that's why it says to one another we actually give each other comp etence and and I love to hear testimonism and people will be like well it's such a small thing no it's not a small thing because if God did that small thing for you then he could do the same thing to me and oh if he did that big thing for you well he can do the big thing for me we we actually like each other on fire okay and and and the fire spreads you know it does it it goes from one to the other to the other don't every service he's here the potential is unlimited whatever the Lord wants that's what we want but I want to be pleasing to the king oh the Lord help us to be pleasing to the king amen now New Jerusalem when we get to over and the other side knew Jerusalem is going to be spiritually and naturally the city of Peace because it's with Jesus and that's where we're heading but you realize that you are the New Jerusalem now because it said I saw his City coming down and it wasn't buildings he saw it coming down it was us it's all coming down and so if we have Jesus in her now we are New Jerusalem now and I can't wait to get to the other side it's going to be such a we don't we don't know what we're going to see here remember when the uh when they were talking to job and he says where were you when the sons and a dollar shouted for Joy can you come on imagine hearing that shout for Joy have you ever been in a stadium ball game stadium and you hear somebody score a goal and everybody can you imagine this is not to some worthless game this is our life and we're gonna be you know that's where all heavens and earth heard me scream team because I Jesus is Lord Jesus king then and that's going to be a day but it doesn't mean we have to be quiet until then I mean I haven't got so enthused I'd love to hear the stories of brother Brandon where he was getting so enthused he had to jump up and just run around a tree you know and I'm waiting for that day but I don't want it to be put on you know because you could just run around a tree and to be all you and then you can say I've ran around a tree no I want it to be something that foreign I just gotta go and then riding around and and I've had some of those times but I didn't have trees but but praise the Lord now those aren't I love those times I want those times but this is what this is a blooded Jesus Jesus it's his word that's what everything is dependent on then as long as everything that you're shouting about goes right back to this then praise the Lord I'll shout along with you amen now let's go to Luke chapter 24. isn't the word of Lord good I love his presence here oh it's good Luke chapter 24 we'll start with verse 36. now this is actually this actually took place before the Pentecost before the upper room so just long as you can read along and place this and as excuse me and as they just spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you and they were terrified and Afraid amen and suppose that they had seen a spirit now let's put ourselves in their exact same their their flesh and blood just like we are and you know you're following Jesus yet when he appeared to them they were not expecting it that way so I always some people condemn them for for being scared he's like Noah I understand okay so let's keep reading and suppose that they had seen a spirit verse 38 and he said get into that why are you troubled and why do your thoughts on why do thoughts arise in your hearts he's still reading amen it's not just some Spirit verse 30 hands 39. behold my hands and my feet that handle me and see and he wants us to handle him prove me and see we when we handle the word we are handling Jesus himself and it's supposed to handle so make sure it lines up online not handle me check me out study to show yourself approved handle me amen Lord help us and handle me and see for a spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as easy I have and when verse 40 and when they had when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet verse 41 and while they yet believed not for Joy now that's a that's a weird statement right there it says they didn't believe but they were in Joy now we can do the exact same thing I'm Healed you could have joy that's when it's made real to you and which Spirit of the Lord can they fall into just in the unjust you can see the weeds and the wheat both jump up and rejoice but yet the weeds don't believe Lord help us that's why it says study to show you check your own self out every time I I check my own self out because I want to make sure I want to know that I know that I'm I'm just doing the things that you want to do and if I have because we get distracted life distracts us things happen but that's why this is so important church is so important Lord help us okay so they were shocked and while yet believe not for joy and wondered he said unto them have you any meat I can't imagine that's a do you have anything to eat and they were they were shocked and enjoying these and they probably looked around and well do we have any meat and it says and they gave him a piece of broiled fish and a honeycomb now I bet every eye was on him I mean because they handed I mean I bet their mouths were open handing them something and I mean because this had never happened four first time that walked right through and everybody being in there and then they before them so that took take a little bit of time you know you're eating everybody's looking at you don't you hate it when people are staring at you when you eat but that's what Jesus was letting them see him see my hands see my feet study me and he let him calm down out of their disbelief while he ate to tell him some truth I speak unto you well I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms concerning me he's like I I told you this would happen you didn't believe that your spirit your your healing was coming I told you you buy my stripes you're healed or whatever it is you're you're your sons and daughters are saved just just believe on them you know whatever promise it is I I told he's told us amen Lord help us now this is a tremendous one too verse 45 it says thanks Jesus to open it now this was before pep and yet their minds were open to understand what's what just was talking about so remember that scripture that talks about though I understand all Mysteries and have not love Christ's charity it profits me nothing now I can think see where this is a lot of danger for a message because we have so much knowledge given to us and as a kid group of man sorry as a as a child growing up in the message it was a i thought because I knew who brother random was I knew a lot of these Mysteries that I was okay that I was not okay says You must be born again you must know Jesus on a personal level and when I went away on College you know you get by yourself I think your true character comes up when you're by yourself what's inside of you I didn't like what I saw inside of me because nobody knew me at college so I could act any way I wanted to and I noticed that I didn't have an anchor I had head knowledge I could quote scriptures and somebody over there at college that was a denominational brother I could hang right with them talking about tremendous truths I mean we are so lucky we're we're we're where the Eagles are eating on the meat the things that the Lord let brother Braham showed us in this last I wouldn't want to live in any other age besides right now because all the open word that has has been given to us it's just been open from beginning to then all the Mysteries that we see amen but remember though you remember know all Mysteries so kids I implore you make sure you know Christ if you don't know Christ get to the altar while we're still here there is a reason why we are by the Lord has prolonged time not everyone is in yet he is waiting on somebody aren't you so glad that he's waiting on he's so long-suffering don't let us be the one that he's waiting on and just because we know you've got to have a personal experience I have drilled that into our kids because of my experience you have to personally I know Jesus yourself and and you you have to have that personal relationship with him and if you never have that time and study in prayer how do you get intimate with the Lord yeah congratulations knew his wife those words are actually the same and it's he had it an intimate relationship with his wife now don't you think that there is not a single person that God doesn't know he didn't even know you what's your name no he just didn't have his intimate relationship with you he he knows who you are but he's gotta he wants to know you and only you know somebody is to spend time with them Lord help us think about all the we're thinking about a microwave age and how we are so free to Worship the Lord in the United States but you get some people that they go in another country let's say China they got to sneak and hide yeah they they they they have to fight this spend time with the Lord to get together and yet we are so free and yet it's not as important to us oh Lord help us to get it back on that Lord time is at hand as the scripture says redeem the time the time that we're wasting redeem it back for the Lord that they might understand in the scriptures now verse 46. and he said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoove behoove Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem verse 48 and they are and ye are witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father on you but Terry Yee in the city of Jerusalem until you be endured he understood the word the Lord has to give you an understanding you know Faith cometh by hearing and and how can you have faith in something unless you truly understand it like I can let's just use that scripture I've been quoting all this morning you're by my stripes you're healed I can have a physical understanding of that but until the Revelation comes I am healed then my faith gets raised to a different level and I have tremendous faith on that scripture so I hope you understand what I'm talking about that it takes Christ to open up our understanding and then you can have faith on what you what Christ has revealed to you and that's what they just did to all the disciples they just had their understanding open of what was supposed to happen to Jesus and they saw that and then their faith raised that is oh it did happen they did everything that they're supposed to do to him vote praise the Lord we're seeing it manifest in our day and we can say a lot of things about that then our day we're seeing the second coming we're seeing all these things lining up the doors are being closed prophecies are being fulfilled build Lord help us verse 50. and he and and he led them as far as Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass why he blessed them he parted from them and carried and carried up into heaven amen and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy now verse 53 remember we were talking about they didn't just stay in the upper room listen what they did in verse 53 and they were continually in what's up people see they stayed they did what Jesus said they went and stayed and it says and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing God um amen now that's the same thing that we do we can have church right here and I'm gonna call this a temple of God we've dedicated this building to Jesus amen and they're continued this is our place this is our this is our habit to go to this is where we want to go but after this we could go to the upper room some somebody's house to something not and if you're so enthused you don't want this ever to end so you go from this and you go to there you keep on talking about the Lord and they were so enjoy it says I mean can you imagine I bet their Joy never ended now where should we be oh we we shouldn't be in sadness and depression and and that's going rapid through the world I'm not saying if you're not Holy Ghost filled you can't get depressed when his wife died and yet he got so depressed that he tried to take his life Holy Ghost filled brother Brandon depression can come on any one of us don't think you're exempt and Satan will say well I have that depression so therefore I'm not the Lord's that's a lie of the devil fact is whenever he's talking he's lying he's lying because he's a Deceiver so don't let Satan ever take you down always go back to the word now Lord help us because it takes I keep it it takes Jesus to open our understanding that we are in our own way you know that's the remember the the greatest man over falls in the mind and it takes them to realize Versa hey you're thinking about that wrong you need to cast that out and think about it this way an atmosphere fear is created and the atmosphere is created and can you imagine the at but they had testimonies I bet they had somebody pray about the gifts for an action I bet all kinds of things were happening maybe not speaking in tongues because they went outside after the Holy Ghost fell on them tongues but I'm just saying I bet they were like you remember when Jesus did that and that scripture was fulfilled here the testimonies that was going on in the atmosphere that was created and in that building they had high expectation now do you think they were just playing games talking about the weather they went there with high expectations now if we did the exact same thing what an atmosphere to Hayek anything can happen Anything Could Happen and it says we're two or three are gathered Jesus is there we got more than two or three and we're gathered in his name we're talking about him we're singing songs to him amen so what's that mean he's here he's we named me not me and I believe see him with our eyes but he's here and and it's not all about can you can you uh feel it it's more about do you believe it now I love to feel him I love to feel the anointing and I can feel the anointing but even if I didn't feel the anointing he honors his word and it's and it's him that's here oh it's a great thing that's why we come to be pleasing and worshiping the king amen and they continued verse and this is in Acts chapter 1 verse 14. and the these all continued in one Accord in prayer and supplication with the women and I love how this scripture calls out and says and Mary the mother of Jesus and his brother and he calls out hey Mary has to go through this if Mary has to go so do you she wasn't something special that's it now she was but it was so the crisis being formed in each one of us also but the actual Christ was formed in her amen but and then you get a Catholic churches that does worship Mary and he's like no no no she had to be go to the exact same thing that we had to go through and it says verse 15 and in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of the names were about 120 there's like 100 20 of them up there so let's go to Acts chapter 2. and let's go to verse one this is what happens when we wait on the Lord and when the day of Pentecost was fully become they were all in one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind I just brother Branham heard that many times oh my we may not hear it but I still think he's here but to hear it would be awesome wouldn't it Amen to see some of the things would be great I've never spoken in tongues but to speak in tongues I think would be great amen I've never so doesn't mean I'm not saved because I didn't speak in tongues or if you've never preached the gospel if you've never sung a special no just be about what the Lord has you placed and then don't try to be something you're not and if it's your place the Lord will make a way for you you don't have to beg plead or beg or or politic to get your way into that place because then it's you put yourself in there and it may not be Lord but if you don't have to do anything and the Lord places you there the neck should give you confidence this is my place amen Lord help us and the sound of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloves of tongues of like as fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now we talked about this but I want to read this book from Brother brand believe us without this it says and let me tell you something right now Virgin Mary in them was right among them that's right and if God wouldn't respect the holy Virgin Mary to get to heaven any any other way besides receiving the Holy Ghost women what about you now remember we are the bride of Christ so men and women amen that's right you have to pay the same price get the same experience experience and have the same thing that they had back there at the beginning doesn't matter if you're part of the message church we still have to get the exact same experience as they got back then Lord help us now this is from the fourth seal I love how brother Brian dramatizes a lot of things he puts it in words that we can understand in our own language that I just love it okay we'll read it the fourth seal it says and they went up to the upper room and maybe one said well I believe we waited long enough let's just accept it by faith now he said brother man says that's a good Baptist Doctrine but it didn't work with them brothers and so first thing you know it had to become a reality so let me pause there because that is a powerful statement that when you're praying let's just accept it by faith and move on didn't wait long and enough that how many times have I done that I have done that so when the lord gave me this it changed my attitude about praying now remember he said Terry stay in Jerusalem he's at the altar but you had better be at the altar of your heart and just because we pray for something your cause of the prayer and you have to go to work you can continue to pray for that for days weeks on pray until something happens because yes by faith we have to claim it but you also know when something takes place when that faith that cometh amen so let's keep on reading that was good Baptist Doctrine but it didn't work for them brothers so then the first thing you know it had to become a reality and they waited on their Ministry for the word to be Vindicated and when you come to seek the Holy Ghost you do the same yes you can accept it by faith you have to accept it by faith that's exactly right and you accept the Holy Spirit by faith but then you let the Holy Spirit come and give the circumcision as a witness that he has accepted your faith see amen and he goes and puts it in scripture you see brother Brandon believe God Abraham sorry he said Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness but God gave him the sign of circumcision as a confirmation that he had accepted his faith wait and until God accepts your faith you don't think we're going to be tested and tried I'm gonna go right back to Abraham remember he went up to sacrifice Isaac you know his faith was tested right to the point where he was going to replunge the knife and then he said hold don't you think your faith is going to be tested if Abraham's all these examples I mean think about all these things that David you're going to be king but yet I'm going to test you to see if you still believe you're going to be king and I'm going to have some I'll chase you out in order to try to kill you you know don't you think Satan's gonna do the same thing let's try to kill us and yet Lord I know that you've got my way yeah I know that your your path is correct no matter you tried almost to the breaking point but praise the Lord he won't put on more than you can bear praise the Lord now that's a promise that I thrust on Lord I don't know why I'm going through this but I know that no matter what there is a way out you can have the biggest storm in your life and yet inside be at peace because that's the that's the harbor of Faith that's that that's it you know that the eye of the storm it's all peace storm all around Lord help us it says uh but God gave him the sign of circumcision as a confirmation nation that he had accepted his faith just so you know this is a 1963 the fourth seal Okay so so the the until we were changed until something actually happened I don't care what format comes in and I believe that speaking in tongues all of those things are right but just that in itself won't work and you know it won't work so it doesn't work now I'm going to skip down just a little bit it says but when he the person The Immortal Spirit of Christ becomes your personal Savior and changes you and throws your views straight into Calvary in his word something has happened yes sir something has happened no one will have to tell you about it you'll know when it happens oh my amen praise the Lord now we're almost done but isn't this been good so I'm going to read two more scriptures so let's turn there let's go First Corinthians chapter 16. First Corinthians chapter 16. we'll read verse 7 and 8. for I will not see you now by the way but I trust to tarry a while with you if the Lord permit verse 8. but I will tear you at Ephesus until Pentecost now we are supposed to do the same with each one they that wait upon the Lord somebody comes to the altar tarry within until Pentecost tarry with them until something happens we're supposed to tarry with our brothers and sisters especially when they're seeking something wait with them it it's it gives you new Comfort I remember every time I go to the Altar and some brother lays their hand on he gives me Comfort that they're they're they're praying with me they're they got my back they got now a lot of times the Lord will bring somebody to your mind that they live in a completely different state or whatever and you pray for them and that person has no idea that you prayed for them have you ever heard that song Somebody prayed for me they had me on their mind they sacrificed their time they fell down on their knees and prayed before for me oh my they had no doubt to bring me out but he could change my life and set me free and I love this oh I'm so glad that someone prayed for me and they don't even need to know it but if you have a gift of Prayer pray for that person pray for them the last scripture Galatians chapter 4 19. ah foreign birth again until Christ be formed in you so it's a travail in birth it's a battle it's there's pain there's burp pains but he says I travail in birth with you again until Christ be formed in you and we're supposed to do that with each one and and you may not see it happen right away I don't know if you I love songs they speak to your heart and even when you don't see him he's working amen that that is a great song Because when you pray for something and you have faith there's a miracle in the making it I have faith that it's coming you may not see it but it's on its way think about with Daniel he had Faith he prayed and yet it took 21 days now that was a spiritual battle that literally took place and it's in the scripture for us to know there's a battle going on that we can't see and he was trying to get an answer to Daniel and this is and it and it didn't happen even though the answer was on his way he kept on praying didn't doubt that the answer was on his way and the faith worked through and the lord gave him his answer now same thing with cancer or with anything else once you speak the name of Jesus over that demons have to flee [Music] don't let your faith waver and praying for that lost loved one and you see him go deeper into the world don't let your faith your faith is yours it says above above all take the shield of Faith your biggest weapon hey man I just had a sermon the other day and I had my son Micah he had a shield that was the size of himself you know you could pretty much hide behind it and I gave my other son a paper plate and I said which Faith do you want I want to hide completely behind it I don't want anything to happen nothing can get through now the Armory of God is for you you're choosing your take you can choose to pay per plate or you can choose the great big thing how much Faith do you you have and if you don't have faith Lord I believe but help thou my unbelief that's the first thing that something hits that's that that's the you know the fiery darts of the devil are quenched and once they get there you can break them Lord help us to put on that armor until you go to battle don't let me imagine a kid that's uh not fully trained with a sword trying to go fight with a sword no no no no no wait until wait until once you get endured with power on high now even the disciples they were scared to death hiding in that Upper Room but as soon as the Holy Ghost came man their their doubts and fears just went away and they're you know Faith muscle pooped up and out in the streets they went and they're like listen to this that both LED Lord and Jesus that you crucified he is our savior and before then they were like whoa I'm scared but all we have to have is faith but to be sent of the whole Holy Ghost because we can hurt somebody you know let her kill us but the spirit brings lives so you can kill somebody with the word if you're not using it race it's by Grace we are saved you know through faith aren't you so glad for Grace but the thing it is is once you get Christ on the inside it's written on your heart and that law will just come out you don't have to tell somebody how to dress how to live their life you get them to Christ and you get hands off because now it's up to Christ to dress them nobody else well I think you should do that I don't care what you think I want to walk what God wants of me but something push my convictions on you no I'm not I'm just gonna Lord will be whispered and pointing to other people what look what they're doing pray for them amen and if they're in the wrong Lord will lead them to the right all we got to do is love them and bring them in you can you can there's a saying that you can't you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink can you imagine me trying to get a big old strong horse hanging on him get him down in there and when I finally get him down in there I'll go too far and I'll drown him you know because I don't I don't know what I'm doing I can't control it same thing with us you force them into it because it was isn't God good I want to wait on the Lord wait for everything amen isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord I hope hope you enjoyed this because I thoroughly enjoyed this just seeing the Lord let's all stand as we invite brother Byler and musicians let's let's bow our heads and thank the Lord for the service and if anybody needs prayer if anybody wants to wait until so you haven't waited long enough please the altar's open I'm sure brothers and sisters will pray for you amen let's buy our heads precious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you so much for being in our house tonight Lord Jesus this morning Lord we thank you for being here thank you for opening up your word Lord thank you for the freedom Lord thank you for your your presence here Lord Jesus Lord I just pray Lord Jesus but if we haven't waited for things Lord if there's promises that you've given us Lord and something that's coming to mind right now Lord help us to go back and wait on that Lord let our faith be renewed Lord and and even if it doesn't happen right this moment Lord I pray that you will not let our faith waver Lord even if it doesn't happen this week don't let our faith waver Lord we want you Lord and all in all Lord have you shine through our lives and Lord give us the patience of you Lord Jesus and Lord we ask this amen and amen Amen brother bother praise the Lord amen praise the Lord can't think of this the whole song thing yes that'd be good they wait upon how many police you gotta wait on the Lord just wait in Jerusalem amen

shall found out [Music] oh this is [Music] [Applause] amen so many stories come in your mind as you think about that song you think about Daniel he waited didn't he he was all the way thrown down over the wall [Music] three Hebrew children they waited you know I believe that's one of our problems is uh that we want to tell God or think when it should happen God's not gonna do it on your time wait on the Lord he'll do it in his own good time amen just wait on the Lord amen and he'll come on the scene praise be to God that was a great message this morning amen I'm going to take the Lord's supper and communion this morning would that be okay since everybody's here amen so if you will turn your Bibles you mean we'll change the order to service thank you musicians amen let's turn our Bibles to the book of First Corinthians amen I like to do this because you know the Lord asked us to do it as often as we meet and so forth and we like to try to do it once a month Amen to remember what Jesus Christ did because we know that him paying the price everything hinged on him giving his life amen suffering dying and then rising in the third day amen and so we just want to remember what Christ did for us Amen in First Corinthians 11. First Corinthians 11. and we'll begin with verse 23. all says that this way he says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this too in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he adds up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink of this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord and but let the man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eat it and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wait for my brethren when you come put together to eat Terry one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come let's bow our heads up we have a moment of silence today that you can take a moment to examine yourself to see whether you're worthy or not for you to judge yourself and if you've done any wrong and make your confessions to the Lord so that when you come to eat of the bread and drink of the wine so you don't drink condemnation amen and so let's have a moment of silence and Heavenly Father we just ask God that you would wash any sins away that's in any of our Lives father even thinks perhaps that we don't know about Lord but we ask God that we come holy and pure before you Lord Jesus father that we would be worthy of taking and remembering this as you have given us orders Lord bless each one that partakes in Jesus name amen all those who want to take a partake of the communion come over on the right side the rest can be seated William that's a blessing on the bread just [Music] there is [Music] America these days [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] my sins [Music] my sins always [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] I precious blood shall never loses [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] safety said no [Music] [Applause] no more [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] our sins by faith [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] uh shall be till [Music] Daddy [Music] I'll see thy power Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] when this is [Music] [Music] with blood drawn from [Music] amen your space and see there's plunge beneath that flood s [Music] oh loses beneath [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord bless your name Jesus Hallelujah amen what a wonderful wonderful song Amen whoever wrote that was certainly inspired amen stand with me once again if you will just turn to Saint John 13. now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them and to the end can I just stop for a second here he talks about departing isn't that right unto the father having loved his own which were in the world we're looking for him to come back again amen and to receive us to himself the ones that he loves amen we're at that point now amen and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas iscari at Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God amen I think that's a revelation of the god don't you think he was God came down into human flesh and went back to the pillar of fire that he was before he rises from supper and lay decides garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he forced water into Basin and began to watch the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded and committee to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him ordered this thou washed my feet notice I didn't have a problem until he come to Peter peterhead of course once I can't open his mouth amen amen just now wash my feet and Jesus answers and said unto him what I do thou no it's not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet and Jesus answers him if I washed he not thou has no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but he's clean every width and yeah clean but not all for he knew he should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean so after they had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you he called me master and Lord and you say well first so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet he all sought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you barely barely I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him and if you know these things happy re if you do them amen God bless you as you wash one another's feet you've dismissed
