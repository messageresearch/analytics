[33:09] fellowship
[33:11] and i'm going to try to re-read this
[33:12] just a little bit if i could
[33:14] verse 7
[33:22] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[33:25] light
[33:27] and the blood of jesus christ clean his
[33:29] son cleanses
[33:30] us from all sin then
[33:34] back up about two lines
[33:38] then we have fellowship one with another
[33:42] amen is that all right
[33:46] amen god bless you you can be seated
[33:48] tonight amen
[33:50] that's right because how many knows that
[33:52] if we are
[33:53] under the blood then we have fellowship
[33:55] one with another
[33:57] amen so tonight for a little while we
[33:59] want to speak on something i've spoken
[34:00] probably many times before
[34:02] but perhaps just maybe see it from a
[34:05] little bit different light or a little
[34:07] different
[34:08] view amen so fellowship let's just think
[34:11] about the word fellowship for a minute
[34:14] amen there's god
[34:17] created each and every one of us to want
[34:20] to have fellowship
[34:22] you know right i don't know anybody no
[34:25] human being that i know of
[34:27] likes to be alone and not fellowship
[34:30] or talk to somebody sometime now we've
[34:33] heard y'all have heard of hermits
[34:35] right some people like to be a hermit
[34:38] they like to go out in the woods
[34:39] somewhere
[34:40] and most of the time if you ever know
[34:43] anything about a hermit
[34:44] they don't like people to come around
[34:48] right they've had some really bad
[34:51] experiences with people
[34:53] and so they they don't want you to
[34:54] trespass on their property they don't
[34:56] want you to come and you know their
[34:57] hermit they're
[34:58] hermit for a reason most likely it's
[35:00] because
[35:02] that they have had a bad experience with
[35:04] people
[35:06] so they just like to be by their self
[35:08] they want to be by their self
[35:10] and for the most part i just want to say
[35:12] that they probably hate most people they
[35:15] just don't like people
[35:17] why else would you not want to be around
[35:18] anybody else unless you really didn't
[35:20] like them
[35:22] but for the most part most of us normal
[35:24] people
[35:25] like to talk to each other like they
[35:27] have fellowship
[35:29] and that right and a lot of times you
[35:31] find the people in the country right
[35:33] how many knows are the people on the
[35:34] farm and so and it used to be more so
[35:37] back in the olden days when perhaps a
[35:40] farmer wouldn't see nobody for a week or
[35:42] whatever so whenever somebody would come
[35:44] they'd be super friendly and they'd be
[35:47] very outgoing and
[35:48] they'd talk to you and so forth right
[35:50] because they wanted to talk to somebody
[35:52] you know
[35:52] but city folks we don't even wave each
[35:54] other anymore why we're so used to each
[35:56] other we got
[35:57] so many people that we know already but
[36:00] let me take this a little bit different
[36:02] first of all i want to say that
[36:04] fellowship is one of the
[36:05] oldest things in the universe all right
[36:09] it's one of the oldest should we say
[36:11] desires that come from god
[36:14] in the universe in the world
[36:19] amen we know through the message of the
[36:20] hour uh
[36:22] brother bannon says it this way he says
[36:23] god in the beginning
[36:25] being infinite he says he knowed
[36:28] all things from the beginning all right
[36:32] and the only thing that these things are
[36:35] is the display
[36:36] of his attributes all right so
[36:38] everything that we're seeing
[36:40] around us is a display of god's
[36:43] attributes
[36:45] all right so he's let's listen you have
[36:47] you have an attribute
[36:49] in it's your thought your thought
[36:52] is your attribute you think of something
[36:55] and then you speak it and then you take
[36:58] it so forth and that's god in the
[37:00] beginning
[37:01] and he says if you ever was
[37:05] or ever will be in heaven
[37:08] you was in heaven to start with
[37:13] amen so we go back and you're a part of
[37:17] god
[37:17] you were his thought he knew your name
[37:21] and he knew who you were
[37:24] before there was a molecule
[37:27] before there was a light before there
[37:31] was anything amen
[37:35] and then listen so he says he knew your
[37:39] name and then you became the word
[37:41] and the word is this thought expressed
[37:42] and you were manifest
[37:44] now next quote who do you say this is
[37:46] phoenix arizona 1964.
[37:49] that's the way he was he was in the
[37:52] beginning
[37:53] by himself i mean though that god was
[37:57] by himself before there was any
[38:00] molecule before there was the first
[38:02] stardust
[38:04] before the first light before the first
[38:06] moon before earth was ever created
[38:09] god dwelled alone now
[38:12] this is where this is the area where
[38:16] you can't figure god out all right
[38:19] there's certain thoughts that you can't
[38:21] entertain because it'll blow your mind
[38:26] how many of those gobbled flaps will
[38:27] blooply blow your natural mind
[38:30] i mean you think about how long god was
[38:32] before he ever created anything
[38:35] you make questions you know you ask
[38:37] yourselves questions there's no answers
[38:38] for it
[38:39] because you just ask yourself a question
[38:41] that is that that's not even
[38:43] answerable but you say how long it was
[38:46] never
[38:46] never was the length of time he was
[38:48] always he was eternal
[38:50] it's not like 10 000 years or whatever
[38:52] he was
[38:53] he always was all right so then he began
[38:55] to think well god was always was and
[38:57] you know how could he be because we're
[38:59] such creatures of time
[39:01] and element and everything has a
[39:03] beginning with us but god never did
[39:06] and how great was and i'll tell you what
[39:08] you know and just to think of how great
[39:11] god is to be able to create everything
[39:13] that was created
[39:15] me and my wife the other day we finally
[39:17] got outside in the dark and you know it
[39:18] was out in the country and
[39:20] boy i'll tell you what and i guess was
[39:22] it last night
[39:23] isn't here uh last night or is it
[39:25] tonight i think it was last night it was
[39:27] supposed to be the meteor showers and so
[39:29] forth
[39:29] it's supposed to be really heavy and
[39:31] while we were out there a few nights ago
[39:33] and i see a few of them going across
[39:34] there
[39:35] and you look at the galaxy look at the
[39:36] stars and how great god really is
[39:39] and how powerful he really is to be able
[39:41] to make all this stuff
[39:43] just thinking about god ought to do
[39:46] something to us
[39:49] you know it just you know it ought to
[39:52] make like the scripture says i stand
[39:54] in all of you it's like wow
[39:58] really i i can't even fathom it my mind
[40:01] isn't great enough to comprehend
[40:03] how great how powerful god really is
[40:10] amen and they're so it's just
[40:12] infationable and some people cannot
[40:15] accept god because they can't fathom him
[40:18] they can't bring god into their mind and
[40:22] and project him as well he started here
[40:24] he started there he's this that or the
[40:26] other no he never was and there's no way
[40:27] that you can ever fathom how great god
[40:29] is in your mind you can't never do it
[40:32] our human mind isn't able to conceive
[40:35] that amen that's what different places
[40:36] brother bam he says you know you can't
[40:38] figure out
[40:38] don't try to do it amen you weren't
[40:41] meant to figure god out you were meant
[40:43] to believe god
[40:45] that's what we are we're meant to accept
[40:47] god but there we look at this
[40:49] and go way back before the beginning
[40:51] before the first molecule
[40:54] notice he says before the first molecule
[40:57] was ever made
[40:58] god had you in his mind
[41:03] he had you any thoughts and he
[41:05] fellowship
[41:06] with his thoughts
[41:10] well you see that's weird brother bob no
[41:12] it's not so weird didn't you ever see a
[41:14] person talking to themselves
[41:19] what are they doing hey some people
[41:21] laugh
[41:22] some people will you know just talk and
[41:24] talk back to this house right
[41:26] you know they're having a good time
[41:28] fellowshipping with their mind
[41:31] and their thoughts is that what it is
[41:34] now you might not do it wait till you
[41:36] get my age you find yourself in the
[41:37] backside of the barn laughing about
[41:39] something
[41:40] all by yourself
[41:44] but that's how god was god was there all
[41:46] by himself and can you imagine there he
[41:48] had all these thoughts in his mind
[41:50] and he said oh oh he could have just had
[41:52] a good old-fashioned time
[41:54] just fellowshipping with his thoughts
[41:56] with his thinking and what he's going to
[41:58] do and how he's going to create things
[42:01] and the
[42:01] sons of god you know whenever job was
[42:04] down into despair
[42:05] or he was in the in the ash sheep and so
[42:08] forth you know god says where was you
[42:10] job
[42:11] when the sons of god shouted for joy
[42:14] where was you
[42:15] i bet you were in my mind
[42:18] [Applause]
[42:19] shouting for joy that's where you was
[42:23] think about that when you're down in the
[42:25] ashy
[42:27] amen when you go through our thing just
[42:29] realize that i knew you'd go through
[42:31] this before i
[42:33] created the first doll
[42:36] [Applause]
[42:38] i knew your name jeff young i knew your
[42:42] name before a hunger
[42:44] and created the first molecule
[42:47] let me tell you if you're christians
[42:49] born again saved by the holy ghost and
[42:52] you believe that you are a part of god
[42:55] you ought to be the happiest person on
[42:58] the world
[43:00] to think that you are a part of god you
[43:03] and if you
[43:03] ever gonna be in heaven if you were ever
[43:05] gonna be there
[43:06] you was there at the beginning
[43:11] and the fact that you now have
[43:12] fellowship with god
[43:14] shows you that when the rapture does
[43:16] come he's not gonna leave you no
[43:18] forsake you
[43:22] that don't make you happy go grab you a
[43:25] budweiser
[43:27] huh
[43:30] huh how many believes you ought to do
[43:34] something for us
[43:36] amen a budweiser on a dope and an
[43:40] that don't make us happy when you read
[43:42] the word of god it makes us happy
[43:46] praise be to god but he was there he was
[43:50] all by himself he was
[43:53] lonely
[43:56] because he was all by himself for all
[43:59] that time
[44:00] and god wanted fellowship
[44:09] amen you might say
[44:13] oh i want more fellow how many wants
[44:14] more fellowship with god
[44:16] well you just remember that this that
[44:19] god wants more fellowship with you than
[44:21] what you do with him
[44:23] he's more anxious to have fellowship
[44:25] with you
[44:26] than what you are with him
[44:30] this is what we speak about what we're
[44:32] going to talk tonight about
[44:34] you know talking about amen this is this
[44:36] is something
[44:38] that has to be top priority
[44:41] in our life if we expect to be in the
[44:44] rapture
[44:48] we have to have the kind of fellowship
[44:51] that's going to take us out of here
[44:54] if you don't have the right fellowship
[44:56] with god you're not leaving this place
[45:02] amen enoch walked with
[45:05] god he had fellowship with god
[45:09] and before he left he had this testimony
[45:12] that he pleased god
[45:16] that was his testimony he had such a
[45:19] walk such a fellowship with almighty god
[45:22] until he didn't do anything but what
[45:24] pleased god
[45:25] jesus said the same thing i do nothing
[45:28] amen but my father
[45:30] shows me first and i always do that
[45:33] which
[45:34] pleases the father
[45:37] listen everybody are you doing always
[45:40] that which pleases the father
[45:51] good question because if you're not
[45:54] because i'm healthy to tell you i wonder
[45:56] what god's gonna have to do to shake us
[45:58] up
[46:00] to get us ready for that rapture
[46:03] huh oh it's gonna be interesting there
[46:08] hey amen can i say it you ain't seen
[46:13] nothing yet you wait because i know
[46:17] there's one thing sister john easton
[46:19] that is that god is going to have his
[46:21] people ready
[46:23] and he's already got it laid out exactly
[46:25] what it's going to take to have you
[46:27] ready
[46:29] i don't know just what it is the prophet
[46:32] of god one place he says it'll be that
[46:33] persecution that drives them together
[46:38] perhaps it's that persecution that will
[46:40] drive us together
[46:41] and that'll bring us right into a
[46:43] rapture condition
[46:46] so let's go back so we're thinking about
[46:48] that there god was
[46:49] all by himself he was lonely and he
[46:52] wanted fellowship
[46:53] how do you know he wanted fellowship
[46:56] well it's quite evident
[46:59] his works manifest that he wanted
[47:02] fellowship
[47:03] and that he didn't want to be alone
[47:06] you know right that's why he created us
[47:09] that's why he created angels
[47:12] and then he created us i mean those
[47:15] angels
[47:16] that are there 24 7 their wings are just
[47:20] gone just a flop in the air never stop
[47:23] day
[47:24] and night saying holy holy
[47:27] holy is the lord holy holy
[47:31] holy is the lord that's all they do day
[47:33] and night the bible says
[47:36] they're created to do that
[47:40] amen but god wants something more than
[47:43] just
[47:44] angels to worship him
[47:47] he wants something more he wants sons
[47:49] and daughters
[47:52] amen let me go now let's just talk about
[47:55] the natural side of fellowship for a
[47:57] minute
[47:59] the natural side of fellowship everyone
[48:01] that is normal normal human being
[48:04] grows up to be about 15 16
[48:08] 17 18 and in those years
[48:11] amen if you as a teenager i'll just kind
[48:14] of
[48:15] perhaps use my testimony
[48:20] maybe not everybody's like me but when i
[48:22] got to be about close to 20 18 19
[48:25] 20 you know i wasn't lonely i had
[48:27] friends i did what i want but there come
[48:29] a time
[48:30] in my life going to church knowing the
[48:33] lord
[48:34] being saved but there's something in my
[48:36] heart
[48:37] that just said you know i don't want to
[48:40] be alone
[48:40] i don't want to live my life by myself
[48:44] i was renting a little room from a
[48:46] little old man of the night lady
[48:48] her upstairs room she rented it out for
[48:50] me that's where i lived for quite a
[48:52] while
[48:53] even as a christian now i just read that
[48:55] for about 100
[48:56] a month you wouldn't do that nowadays
[48:57] anymore would you
[49:00] and so but you know i it was got to the
[49:03] place to where
[49:04] you know i was ready for a mate i was
[49:06] ready for a companionship
[49:10] i mean sometimes it helps they have
[49:12] parents sometimes it helps their friends
[49:14] sometimes it helps
[49:15] to be busy with this data that most
[49:18] times amen young people will get to the
[49:20] place to where they're lonely
[49:22] and they want companionship amen
[49:29] let me preach to the young people a
[49:30] little bit sure
[49:33] that's why austin serenity's sitting
[49:35] back there
[49:36] amen didn't want to be alone
[49:39] there was something called you begin to
[49:41] pray lord is everyone
[49:42] out there for me is there a companion
[49:45] out there for me
[49:47] amen and you know
[49:50] god granted me that desire of my heart
[49:53] amen and give me donna and that
[49:58] satisfied that
[49:59] hey i was happy it was awesome it's
[50:03] wonderful
[50:04] you know but think about this
[50:08] that let's say you don't know god you
[50:10] don't have christ yeah that'll satisfy
[50:13] that
[50:13] it'll take care of that natural part but
[50:15] after you've been married and that
[50:17] person becomes kind of common to you
[50:19] there's going to be another loneliness
[50:21] that sets in
[50:23] hello and that is a loneliness of your
[50:26] soul
[50:28] your soul is lonely
[50:31] it wasn't meant to be alone your soul
[50:35] wasn't meant to be empty your life
[50:37] wasn't meant to be empty
[50:39] as much as perhaps a make and satisfy
[50:42] and feel that loneliness and bring you
[50:44] fellowship that never will
[50:46] take the place of the holy ghost
[50:50] amen i thank god that he had already
[50:52] filled that place
[50:55] but you know after a while we were
[50:57] married about two years and i began to
[50:59] think and talk to my wife we said you
[51:01] know
[51:01] wouldn't it be nice to have a child
[51:06] wouldn't it be nice we got perhaps
[51:08] lonely we wanted
[51:09] fellowship with our offspring huh
[51:14] you don't think about all the nights you
[51:16] don't think about the puke they're gonna
[51:17] throw up on you everywhere
[51:20] you don't think about all the dirty
[51:22] diapers you don't think about the fevers
[51:24] you don't think about all the struggles
[51:26] you don't think about all the school you
[51:27] got to take them to and all these
[51:29] activities and
[51:30] oh boy i'll tell you what after you have
[51:32] children the time begins to fly by fast
[51:36] well because your whole rap life is
[51:38] wrapped up now in your family in the job
[51:40] and guess what you don't have time to be
[51:41] lonely
[51:46] you ain't got time at all hardly
[51:49] time that's why those 20s and 30s snap
[51:52] by really quick
[51:54] and that right because why you feel
[51:57] fulfillment especially as a christian
[51:59] you have the lord jesus christ to
[52:01] satisfy your soul
[52:03] amen you have these other things that
[52:04] god meant for you to have
[52:08] amen and then all of a sudden here comes
[52:10] your child you know and for me it wasn't
[52:12] a girl but it was a couple of boys
[52:14] and then when they were first born what
[52:16] is the first thing we look is
[52:17] does he have my hand does he have my
[52:19] feet does he look like me or does he
[52:21] look like her or whatever is that right
[52:26] he began to look for a resemblance
[52:28] because guess what
[52:29] amen that is a part of you and that's
[52:33] the way it is with god he was by himself
[52:35] but he was looking for more than just
[52:36] the angels
[52:37] more than just servants but he was the
[52:39] desire to have a
[52:41] son he wanted sons and daughters like
[52:44] himself
[52:48] how many believes that god is looking
[52:51] for his children to be like him to act
[52:54] like him
[52:56] oh my and i want to take you to the
[52:58] scripture that day the bible says you're
[53:00] gonna know that i am in my father my
[53:02] father
[53:03] is in me i am and you and you are in me
[53:06] i want you to know that come a time when
[53:08] you'll realize that we have fellowship
[53:11] one with another
[53:14] god is desiring fellowship
[53:18] a fellowship that you can walk out of
[53:19] this world with
[53:22] fellowship that you can walk in this
[53:23] world with
[53:25] and be in this world with amen we look
[53:29] on down and we find out that
[53:31] the first two thousand years and the
[53:32] days of noah isn't that right
[53:34] amen that there was a man by the name of
[53:37] enoch isn't that right
[53:39] his name was enoch amen in the bible
[53:41] says he was not
[53:43] for god took him
[53:47] and laid it over in hebrews i believe it
[53:49] is it says you know that through enoch
[53:50] kept this testimony
[53:52] that before he was taken he had this
[53:54] testimony that he pleased
[53:56] god how many knows whenever you love the
[53:59] lord jesus christ you look and there's
[54:01] every way possible you look how that you
[54:04] can
[54:05] please him just as a husband looks to
[54:08] please his wife a wife
[54:10] looks to please her husband if they
[54:12] really love each other and have
[54:13] fellowship they'll do about anything for
[54:15] each other
[54:16] if you've got a friend that's really a
[54:18] friend you'll do about anything
[54:20] for your friend because you have
[54:22] fellowship
[54:24] person that you're close to amen
[54:30] fellowship praise the lord
[54:35] so you think about that
[54:38] you are now a son and daughter of god
[54:42] and if you're a christian let me just
[54:45] put this out before you
[54:47] god is looking for fellowship that we
[54:50] can walk out of this world with
[54:52] what kind of fellowship do you have with
[54:54] him now
[54:56] is your fellowship with god where it
[54:58] should be
[54:59] huh amen
[55:04] brother is your fellowship with god
[55:06] where you want it to be

[55:17] with god
[55:20] i need a deeper walk with god
[55:22] [Music]

[55:24] to be honest
[55:26] wouldn't say i need a deeper walk
[55:29] with god we'll need a deeper
[55:34] walk with god the kind of walk
[55:37] that is totally and completely
[55:40] pleasing to him
[55:48] people say well i love the lord
[55:52] i got fellowship with him but if you
[55:54] walk in darkness

[58:46] carnal hill
[58:47] here but joshua couldn't have barely
[58:49] known what he was saying
[58:52] if he didn't took a thought about what
[58:54] he was saying he probably wouldn't have
[58:55] said it
[58:57] you think a man just carnally thinking
[58:59] would tell the sun
[59:00] to stand still and the moon all
[59:03] still no somebody would have to be under
[59:05] under inspiration said
[59:08] son stand still and move would you hold
[59:12] your place in the valley of agdalone or
[59:14] whatever it was
[59:16] you stay at your place and god stopped
[59:19] the universe
[59:20] for a man
[59:25] how many wants to be a closer walk with
[59:27] god you talk about a close walk with god
[59:30] and god honored his honor his word when
[59:33] he said those things
[59:34] because he what spoke under the
[59:36] inspiration man speaking under the
[59:38] inspiration
[59:40] the bible says that all scripture is
[59:41] given by inspiration it's not
[59:43] man's word to begin with amen lord help
[59:47] us to be able to say that the words that
[59:48] i speak
[59:49] of to you they're not my words they're
[59:51] his words

[1:00:15] god
[1:00:20] pastor let's put me in this the way you
[1:00:23] talk to your congregation
[1:00:24] the way you counsel people the way you

[1:00:39] anything in my name and i will do it
[1:00:43] this is where i realize
[1:00:44] we all need a closer walk with god

[1:00:51] i say
[1:00:53] that sound right do whatever you want
[1:00:57] live however you want that's what the
[1:00:58] world wants to do
[1:01:01] no if you love me keep my commandments
[1:01:04] anybody that wants a close walk with god
[1:01:07] cares about whether they do what god
[1:01:10] said or not
[1:01:12] [Music]
[1:01:17] amen if you don't you'll be highly
[1:01:18] disappointed in
[1:01:23] all yourself verse 18

[1:01:53] will come to you

[1:02:04] at that day you shall know that i am in
[1:02:06] my father you
[1:02:07] are in me and i am in you
[1:02:11] i mean believe that this is truly the uh
[1:02:14] the revelation of the thoughts of god
[1:02:17] being expressed through the prophet of
[1:02:18] god
[1:02:19] telling us that we were in his mind any
[1:02:22] thinking before the world
[1:02:23] ever was at this day you're gonna know
[1:02:26] that you have been a part of me from the
[1:02:28] start
[1:02:28] and i was a part of you from the start
[1:02:32] at that day
[1:02:35] amen
[1:02:39] and ye in me and i in you heeded hath my
[1:02:43] commandments
[1:02:44] and keepeth them he it is
[1:02:48] that love with me all else
[1:02:52] are liars
[1:02:55] and he that loveth me shall be loved of
[1:02:57] my father and i will love him
[1:02:59] and i will manifest myself to him
[1:03:04] amen verse 23 jesus answered us and said
[1:03:09] unto him
[1:03:10] if a man loved me he will keep my
[1:03:14] words
[1:03:17] and my father will love him and we will
[1:03:20] come unto him
[1:03:21] and make our abode with him
[1:03:26] i wrote down here let me see what it was
[1:03:29] if i can even find
[1:03:30] it
[1:03:36] we are not sufficiently impressed
[1:03:39] with the scripture of how that he is in
[1:03:42] us the father is in him he is in the
[1:03:45] father
[1:03:46] we are in him and he is in us
[1:03:50] how many are so thankful to have the
[1:03:51] holy spirit in your heart
[1:03:54] the greatest treasure you have is to
[1:03:56] have god
[1:03:58] in your heart to have the comfort of the
[1:04:00] holy spirit
[1:04:01] in your hearts the greatest thing on
[1:04:02] earth nothing greater
[1:04:07] to have him to make his abode with you
[1:04:14] he that loveth me not uh
[1:04:17] keepeth not my sayings
[1:04:21] amen you don't have the fellowship with
[1:04:24] god if you don't keep his sayings
[1:04:27] don't lie to yourself don't kid yourself
[1:04:30] you don't obey what god said do
[1:04:32] you ain't got fellowship with him amen
[1:04:36] how can two walk together unless there
[1:04:38] be a grade
[1:04:40] somebody answer me that question if you
[1:04:42] can't i'm gonna leave it open for a
[1:04:44] second
[1:04:45] how will let me rephrase it how will
[1:04:49] two people to walk together when they're
[1:04:51] not agreed
[1:04:57] they'll walk together in argument
[1:05:02] in disagreement and in this fellowship
[1:05:05] that's how they'll walk together
[1:05:07] if they're not agreed
[1:05:10] you have to be agreed to have fellowship
[1:05:14] you have to be think the same isn't that
[1:05:17] right
[1:05:19] whenever you don't agree with somebody
[1:05:21] while you
[1:05:22] disagree and most of the time that's
[1:05:24] argue
[1:05:26] and then we all know that too well right
[1:05:29] amen all right so he keep it not my
[1:05:31] saying he is the one that don't love me
[1:05:34] and the words which you hear is not mine
[1:05:36] but the fathers which sent me
[1:05:38] amen all right
[1:05:41] now let's talk about
[1:05:44] fellowship first just a second here
[1:05:51] fellowship middletown ohio fellowship
[1:05:53] comes by love
[1:05:56] and love requires fellowship love
[1:05:59] requires
[1:06:00] fellowship hate creates hermits
[1:06:06] right but love requires you to have
[1:06:10] fellowship it
[1:06:10] just draws you together how many knows
[1:06:13] that
[1:06:15] it pulls you together it's a magnet
[1:06:22] it requires fellowship if you love your
[1:06:24] wife but you've just got to get with her
[1:06:26] and to talk with her
[1:06:28] if you love your friend you got to get
[1:06:30] with him and talk to him and if you love
[1:06:32] god
[1:06:33] huh you got to go worship god you got to
[1:06:37] praise the lord
[1:06:38] you got to talk to the lord
[1:06:42] i can't help but believe that enoch had
[1:06:45] a real prayer life i believe that he had
[1:06:48] talked to the lord morning noon and
[1:06:50] night and probably most of the time
[1:06:52] in between he had a real
[1:06:55] fellowship with god he had a prayer life
[1:06:59] his number one theme in his life was his
[1:07:02] fellowship with god
[1:07:03] let me just say this this should be the
[1:07:06] number one thing for us
[1:07:08] everything else is secondary
[1:07:12] or third arie or fourth area
[1:07:16] there's no aries about that i know but
[1:07:18] that's just to kind of loosen you up
[1:07:21] second third or fourth somewhere down
[1:07:23] the line but our fellowship with god is
[1:07:26] top of the line that's the most
[1:07:29] important
[1:07:30] is our fellowship how many believes that
[1:07:34] this
[1:07:35] fountain is inexhaustible because i've
[1:07:38] preached on fellowship many times but
[1:07:40] look what the lord can bring just
[1:07:42] he can open it up even so much more
[1:07:45] there's no end to the word of god
[1:07:47] there's no exhausting it
[1:07:49] there's no drying it up it's not don't
[1:07:52] get old
[1:07:54] it stays fresh as long as it's in the
[1:07:57] presence of god
[1:07:58] now how many know you take that same man
[1:08:00] and take it out of the presence of god
[1:08:01] gets wiggletails and gets stagnated huh
[1:08:05] but it's got to be in the presence of
[1:08:08] god
[1:08:10] amen
[1:08:14] okay now notice so he says here
[1:08:20] now you cannot have fellowship god with
[1:08:23] com without
[1:08:24] coming to god's agreement
[1:08:27] everything he said he has to have an
[1:08:28] agreement marriage has to have an
[1:08:30] agreement
[1:08:31] fellowship has to have a basis of of an
[1:08:33] agreement
[1:08:35] and there's a basis for the thing of
[1:08:39] fellowship
[1:08:40] how many knows what the basis of
[1:08:42] fellowship is for the christian
[1:08:47] the basis what you got to have
[1:08:50] to have fellowship let me just read
[1:08:53] something over here
[1:09:01] actually let me just read this
[1:09:05] that basis is the blood
[1:09:10] the blood of jesus christ god's not
[1:09:14] going to make
[1:09:14] meat with you he's not going to have
[1:09:17] fellowship with you
[1:09:18] anywhere else outside of the basis
[1:09:22] of his blood what does that mean
[1:09:26] that means that you'll have to come
[1:09:27] under that blood coming under that blood
[1:09:29] means that you have to have your sins
[1:09:32] forgiven am i right
[1:09:36] he's just not going to come if you're a
[1:09:39] sinner
[1:09:42] all right that's the blood the blood
[1:09:44] only
[1:09:45] it's been god all the way from the
[1:09:47] beginning and it will be that way until
[1:09:49] the end
[1:09:50] the only place of fellowship is
[1:09:53] through the blood that's the only place
[1:09:57] that he will meet with us
[1:09:59] today people can meet in church they can
[1:10:03] meet in a baptist a presbyterian a
[1:10:05] lutheran
[1:10:06] a a lodge a mason lodge people can
[1:10:09] fellowship in
[1:10:10] all these different places you can come
[1:10:12] to church here
[1:10:14] hello and still we may not have
[1:10:17] fellowship
[1:10:18] i am going to church
[1:10:21] that's wonderful but there's only one
[1:10:24] way you and i will have fellowship
[1:10:27] and that is the blood of jesus christ
[1:10:29] his cleanses from all sin
[1:10:31] then we have fellowship one with another
[1:10:35] no matter how different we are no matter
[1:10:37] how much we differ
[1:10:38] [Music]
[1:10:40] no matter how much we have a quarrel no
[1:10:43] matter how much we
[1:10:44] fight no matter how much we fuss
[1:10:47] if we ever get back together if we ever
[1:10:50] love one another again
[1:10:51] if we can never smile and put our arms
[1:10:53] around again
[1:10:54] it'll be called be because we come under
[1:10:57] the blood
[1:10:58] and we bring those things under the
[1:10:59] blood otherwise it'll never be
[1:11:01] fellowship
[1:11:03] let me just say a few more things god
[1:11:05] does not have any fellowship with an
[1:11:07] eight believer
[1:11:08] there's no fellowship there he's a mate
[1:11:09] believer he didn't have no fellowship
[1:11:12] with the pharisees how many knows he
[1:11:13] didn't have anything in common with the
[1:11:15] pharisee
[1:11:15] they were the most religious people of
[1:11:17] that day but they had nothing in common
[1:11:21] they certainly didn't have any
[1:11:22] fellowship they certainly couldn't agree
[1:11:26] so any make believer any hypocrite
[1:11:29] cannot fellowship with god
[1:11:32] if you ain't absolutely honest if you
[1:11:34] ain't real
[1:11:36] you have no fellowship with god
[1:11:40] let me tell you this i truly believe
[1:11:42] that a real believer doesn't have any
[1:11:44] fellowship with any of those either
[1:11:47] there's so far you talk be friendly but
[1:11:49] as far as having real fellowship
[1:11:51] where you can just be open and you're
[1:11:52] just heart heart
[1:11:54] amen you can't have that
[1:11:58] unless both of you come under the blood
[1:12:02] then it's all forgiven god won't meet
[1:12:04] you the holy ghost won't come to you he
[1:12:06] won't come and make
[1:12:07] his abode here unless that thing's been
[1:12:09] taken care of
[1:12:10] and you have come under the blood you
[1:12:13] have no fellowship with god
[1:12:14] unless your sins are taken under the
[1:12:16] blood this just comes to mind
[1:12:18] i think today that great man has swept
[1:12:20] this nation back and forth
[1:12:22] jack schuller's billy grahams and many
[1:12:24] others that run over and over and over
[1:12:26] and over
[1:12:28] through the nation and go right back the
[1:12:30] same year
[1:12:31] or the next year and find the same group
[1:12:33] that they preached to just as far
[1:12:36] deluded in sin than there ever was
[1:12:39] because man can't save you
[1:12:44] when men can only make an altar call
[1:12:47] but it's your individual or personal
[1:12:49] faith and trust in god
[1:12:51] to plunge beneath the blood and to be
[1:12:54] filled with his spirits
[1:12:56] and and by speak and become a partakers
[1:13:00] of his divine
[1:13:01] nature not a partaker of church not an
[1:13:04] organization
[1:13:05] but to be able to be partakers of the
[1:13:07] blood of jesus christ
[1:13:09] it takes an individual's faith you might
[1:13:12] find it in a cornfield
[1:13:14] amen i found it in a little
[1:13:18] trailer i was renting not in church
[1:13:21] hello by myself
[1:13:24] no nobody really influenced me at all
[1:13:26] except the holy ghost drawing me
[1:13:28] i give my heart to god as a hippie dude
[1:13:31] saying god i want to give you my heart i
[1:13:33] want to give you my life i want to give
[1:13:34] you everything
[1:13:36] and god came and he met with me and he
[1:13:38] led me
[1:13:40] right straight to the message of the
[1:13:41] hour how many of these that's where the
[1:13:43] holy ghost gonna lead you
[1:13:45] right straight to the message of the
[1:13:47] hour i think brother perry i've been
[1:13:49] thinking about brother perish
[1:13:51] this week and how that most of the times
[1:13:54] if you're born a pentecostal you're
[1:13:56] going to stay a pentecostal
[1:13:57] you don't see people very often come
[1:14:00] from
[1:14:01] that on over to what god has now
[1:14:04] but i see that in him to where he
[1:14:06] actually come on over
[1:14:08] come out of that and come right into the
[1:14:09] message of the hour that's real grace
[1:14:12] that's god amen but listen to what he
[1:14:16] was saying brother branham was saying
[1:14:17] here that
[1:14:17] you know you can we can take people to
[1:14:20] the altar but it takes a personal
[1:14:22] faith of an individual to become part of
[1:14:24] god
[1:14:26] and when a believer comes like that i'll
[1:14:29] pick that up in a minute i don't take
[1:14:30] you out too long tonight but
[1:14:32] can i go a little further so we see here
[1:14:38] amen that it has to be under the blood
[1:14:41] and the blood only
[1:14:44] nothing else
[1:14:48] fellowship god wanted to fellowship with
[1:14:50] man always wanted to do it the old
[1:14:52] testament
[1:14:53] all of it was full of the shed blood
[1:14:55] without the shedding of the blood
[1:14:57] there is no remission i called it
[1:15:00] forgiveness of sins the other night
[1:15:02] right there in order to remit your sins
[1:15:06] there has to be a shedding of blood all
[1:15:09] right and when there's no remission of
[1:15:11] sins
[1:15:12] there's no fellowship
[1:15:16] amen you've got to get away
[1:15:19] from sin before you can have ever have
[1:15:22] fellowship with god because god
[1:15:24] can't have fellowship with sin
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:29] now you think about all the
[1:15:30] denominations you think about everybody
[1:15:32] that goes content to the word of god
[1:15:34] everybody that claims the name of jesus
[1:15:37] christ but they're not under the blood
[1:15:39] and they don't have their sins remitted
[1:15:42] huh women with cat hair makeup on
[1:15:45] earrings on pants on don't let just
[1:15:48] everything god told them not to do
[1:15:52] and they say well i love the lord
[1:15:55] huh you put god fellowshipping with sin
[1:15:59] you make him sinful
[1:16:03] and that right god ain't sinful he
[1:16:06] doesn't partake of sin
[1:16:09] he doesn't have fellowship with sin
[1:16:12] that's why sin has to be taken care of
[1:16:15] how many breeds is evening if you're
[1:16:17] living in sin you're out of fellowship
[1:16:19] with god
[1:16:21] if you haven't got your sin under the
[1:16:23] blood you're not in fellowship with god
[1:16:25] [Music]
[1:16:27] and then if you're not obeying all of
[1:16:29] his commandments you're out of the
[1:16:31] fellowship of god
[1:16:33] you don't have the right kind of
[1:16:34] fellowship it ain't no wonder god don't
[1:16:36] answer your prayers
[1:16:37] [Music]
[1:16:40] he don't have to answer here he's under
[1:16:41] no obligation
[1:16:44] if you abide in me and i abide in you
[1:16:46] you can ask what you
[1:16:48] will but otherwise the deal's off
[1:16:51] amen that's the secret right there
[1:16:53] abiding
[1:16:55] in christ
[1:16:59] praise the lord he don't have fellowship
[1:17:03] with sin and if he does have fellowship
[1:17:06] with you and you have come under the
[1:17:08] blood
[1:17:09] and you're a believer when the believer
[1:17:12] comes like that
[1:17:13] god gives him a checkbook for any
[1:17:16] redemptive blessing that he died for
[1:17:20] oh help us i don't know about you but i
[1:17:23] like to see my
[1:17:24] prayers get answered the way that the
[1:17:26] prophet did
[1:17:27] i'd like to see the son stand still if i
[1:17:29] call for it
[1:17:30] i'd like to see amen all these blessings
[1:17:33] to shower now whatsoever things you will
[1:17:35] ask
[1:17:35] in my name i will do it but i'm gonna
[1:17:38] have to be in the right fellowship with
[1:17:39] god
[1:17:40] you're gonna have to be in the right
[1:17:41] fellowship with god if you're to expect
[1:17:43] god to answer your prayers
[1:17:45] i believe if you walk and you are in
[1:17:47] that kind of fellowship with god cancer
[1:17:49] won't stand in your way
[1:17:50] nothing will stand in your way
[1:17:58] god gives him a check for any redemptive
[1:18:00] blessing that he died for and jesus name
[1:18:03] is signed at the bottom
[1:18:09] my desire is don't even try to get me to
[1:18:12] do or ask for anything
[1:18:14] but what the father shows me first
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:20] amen then if god the father shows you
[1:18:23] first he
[1:18:24] behooves it upon your heart to do it
[1:18:26] it'll be done right
[1:18:29] god will grant it to you you won't ask a
[1:18:31] miss because you want to
[1:18:33] consume it upon your own lusts you ask
[1:18:36] and you receive not because you
[1:18:38] ask it that you may consume it on your
[1:18:40] own lust the bible says
[1:18:41] people ask wrong amen
[1:18:46] oh my
[1:18:52] praise the lord
[1:18:55] notice the holy spirit
[1:18:59] once you get in contact with god and the
[1:19:01] holy spirit
[1:19:02] makes christ real in your heart you're
[1:19:05] not afraid to take god at his word
[1:19:08] anytime or believe it
[1:19:11] if our heart condemn us not then have we
[1:19:13] confidence
[1:19:15] towards god let me just close and close
[1:19:19] saying this i don't know about you but i
[1:19:21] want the strength of
[1:19:22] samson i don't want his backsliding but
[1:19:24] i want us to strength of samp and the
[1:19:26] strength of joshua
[1:19:27] the faith of joshua amen i want the walk
[1:19:31] that jesus had
[1:19:34] i also want to walk that the prophet of
[1:19:36] god had in our day
[1:19:38] why do i want the walk i believe i wrote
[1:19:41] down here that if we have the walk that
[1:19:42] the prophet of god had
[1:19:44] i believe we'll be all right amen he got
[1:19:47] to the place to where god could so trust
[1:19:49] him
[1:19:50] that if he chose to curse a couple up on
[1:19:52] the front that were practically making
[1:19:53] love on his bench
[1:19:55] he could have said i curse you in the
[1:19:56] name of the lord
[1:19:58] just like elijah did with the she bears
[1:20:01] they killed 40 children but no
[1:20:03] he had the grace of god he says i
[1:20:05] forgive you for that
[1:20:07] god's mercy god have mercy on you for
[1:20:10] that
[1:20:11] amen because guess what
[1:20:14] maybe that'll be something that only did
[1:20:16] that one time and it could have cost
[1:20:17] them their life i don't know maybe they
[1:20:19] later on come to the lord i don't know
[1:20:21] but god help us that we wouldn't want
[1:20:23] the same judgment upon us when we make a
[1:20:24] mistake
[1:20:26] isn't that right i said are they
[1:20:27] merciful for they shall obtain mercy
[1:20:30] amen kind of walk with god in closing
[1:20:34] amen to kind of walk with god that he
[1:20:36] could speak to you and say
[1:20:37] storm go pack sunshine for three days
[1:20:43] amen to control the elements or
[1:20:47] even where do you want that squirrel at
[1:20:52] how many squirrels did you want god
[1:20:55] could trust you so until he would tell
[1:20:56] you
[1:20:57] just say it he says well i'll tell you
[1:21:00] what
[1:21:00] i want that squirrel to come up on the
[1:21:02] tree that can never come up go over on
[1:21:04] the branch and never go up and sit on
[1:21:05] the place and never want to sit

[1:21:08] one come over here and go over there and
[1:21:10] sit down let the other one go
[1:21:11] he got specific to make sure that this
[1:21:14] was of god right
[1:21:16] and then squirrels where god created
[1:21:18] those squirrels they ran right up
[1:21:19] there exactly like he said
[1:21:22] and he took for five of his five of them
[1:21:25] that
[1:21:25] or so many of them that time and the
[1:21:28] other one that evening
[1:21:30] that's how close you walk with god god
[1:21:32] honored his prayers
