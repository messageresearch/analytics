[13:15] uh i guess you can stand brother troy
[13:18] gonna read the scriptures
[13:29] and we'll go to the psalms and we'll
[13:31] turn to psalms 5.
[13:45] psalms 5 there's 12 verses there
[13:51] give ear to my words o lord consider my
[13:54] meditation
[14:02] my voice shall thou hear in the morning
[14:04] o lord in the morning will i direct my
[14:07] prayer unto thee and will look up
[14:16] the foolish shall not stand in thy sight
[14:18] thou hate us all workers of iniquity
[14:28] but as for me i will come into thy house
[14:30] in the multitude of thy mercy and in thy
[14:32] fear will i worship toward thy holy
[14:34] temple
[14:43] for there is no faithfulness in their
[14:45] mouth their inward part is very
[14:47] wickedness their throat is an open
[14:49] sepulcher they flatter with their tongue
[15:02] but let all those that put their trust
[15:04] in thee rejoice let them ever shout for
[15:07] joy because thou defendeth them let them
[15:10] also that love thy name be joyful in
[15:12] thee
[15:14] for thou lord will bless the righteous
[15:16] with favor without compass him as with a
[15:20] shield god bless you may be seated
[15:21] brother brian for sunday school the
[15:23] children can be dismissed for sunday
[15:24] school
[15:35] morning brothers and sisters
[15:39] if you return
[15:40] to the
[15:41] 90th psalm
[15:43] and also us
[15:44] if you want you can put an earmark on
[15:47] the sixth chapter of galatians
[15:50] you know i was
[15:51] thinking there this morning
[15:54] you're all
[15:56] brother tom's fishing yesterday i guess
[15:58] i wasn't there for that but
[16:00] you caught several fish and i was just
[16:02] thinking you're all here this morning
[16:04] and then that and that was in a natural
[16:07] sense but if you just think of it in a
[16:09] spiritual sense
[16:10] you know we're fishing in god's word for
[16:13] his promises and anything that
[16:16] god has in his word
[16:18] you're more than able to reach out in
[16:20] faith and reach for that promise that
[16:23] god has for you this morning
[16:25] whether it's spiritual healing whether
[16:27] it's physical healing whatever that need
[16:29] is
[16:30] i'm a firm believer that god is more
[16:32] than able to meet your needs this
[16:34] morning and
[16:36] you know the world wants you your enemy
[16:39] not so much the world your enemy wants
[16:40] you to look at the circumstances and not
[16:43] look at the promises when any time you
[16:45] get in the situation in your life
[16:48] you always find yourself there's an
[16:50] enemy trying to make you make look at
[16:52] your circumstances and then your
[16:54] circumstances become a wall that you
[16:57] can't climb over because you're focusing
[17:00] in the circumstance or whatever that
[17:02] might be and not in the promises that
[17:04] god provides for you as a believer you
[17:07] just got to reach out in faith just like
[17:09] you're fishing and you got to reach out
[17:12] you know send your faith out there catch
[17:14] it upon the waters and god is more than
[17:16] able to meet your need this morning and
[17:18] i don't know what that need is this
[17:20] morning only you know in your hearts
[17:22] what you need from god this morning but
[17:24] god is more than able to meet that need
[17:26] for you this morning i don't know well
[17:28] i'm going this way but sometimes we cut
[17:31] ourselves short you know god god always
[17:33] wants to do more
[17:35] for you than you reach out in faith for
[17:38] and sometimes we
[17:39] and what god really wants to do for you
[17:41] this morning but i was
[17:43] reading in this night and going back to
[17:45] that fifth psalm
[17:46] that we were reading here
[17:48] if you
[17:49] take the word of god it's continually it
[17:51] lays foundation
[17:53] upon foundation upon foundation
[17:56] and you know if you read that psalm the
[17:58] fifth psalm they talk about he prayed
[18:01] before you know he turned his heart to
[18:03] jerusalem or you think of
[18:05] or you think of jonah he you know he
[18:07] turned his heart toward jerusalem toward
[18:10] the temple and it goes all the way back
[18:12] to that prayer of solomon when solomon
[18:14] said if the children of israel got in
[18:16] trouble that they would if they would
[18:18] turn their hearts and their minds and
[18:20] their soul back and look to jerusalem to
[18:22] the temple and pray before the lord that
[18:25] god would heal him of their afflictions
[18:27] or the problems in their land looks no
[18:29] different for you this morning as a
[18:31] christian but it's in a different sense
[18:33] you're not looking to a physical place
[18:35] but you're looking to the word of god
[18:37] and jesus christ and the promise for the
[18:40] age that we live in this morning and if
[18:42] you in faith reach out using god's word
[18:45] and the promises and put them before you
[18:47] he'll meet that need for you this
[18:49] morning but i'm totally
[18:52] i was uh
[18:53] i don't read the wrong one that's the
[18:55] one it's the one for this morning
[18:58] but it's for the 12th and the scripture
[19:01] that this you know this guy
[19:03] probably when he wrote this devotional
[19:05] for world war ii
[19:07] that wrote this
[19:09] was probably
[19:10] 40 50 years old so he's not on the earth
[19:12] no more but
[19:14] when you look at the world that we're in
[19:16] this morning it's kind of you know they
[19:17] had a
[19:18] if you were a young man in 1941 or 1942
[19:22] there was a lot of anxiety you know that
[19:25] was going to be on your heart no
[19:27] different than being a christian in the
[19:28] age that we're living right now you
[19:30] don't know what tomorrow's
[19:33] and
[19:33] and you read the psalms that when you
[19:35] read the psalms and you see how god
[19:37] thinks of people
[19:39] that try to subvert other people or
[19:41] steal from people or hurt people or lie
[19:45] to people i'll just read what he has to
[19:47] say it goes back to galatians
[19:50] the sixth chapter but before i read this
[19:52] let me
[19:53] i'm i'm totally off point this morning
[19:56] but if you turn with me to
[19:58] galatians sixth chapter
[20:01] you know i'm a firm believer
[20:03] in my own life you can't ever not
[20:06] you got constantly you've got to re-read
[20:09] the word of god because there's always
[20:11] like brother thomas says and all
[20:13] preachers will tell you you know you'll
[20:15] read a chapter in the bible or a message
[20:17] [Music]
[20:18] you know whatever message you'll read at
[20:20] one time you'll put it down for a few
[20:22] months or a few years and you'll lift it
[20:25] up again and you read it again and you
[20:27] get something different out of it
[20:29] it doesn't change the truth that's
[20:31] already in it it just adds to what you
[20:33] know already so when you read like
[20:36] galatians the six chapters in it you
[20:39] might read it three weeks ago or three
[20:41] months ago and you read it again and
[20:45] something else will reach out to you
[20:46] something you didn't see before will be
[20:48] there and that's that's really important
[20:51] but i'll just read what paul had to say
[20:53] here
[20:54] said brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[20:56] fault he which are spiritual restore
[20:59] such as one in the spirit of meekness
[21:01] consider taught these simple truths of
[21:03] life how you treat other people is how
[21:06] god's gonna treat you it's pretty simple
[21:08] the way you treat people the way you
[21:10] think about people the way you act
[21:12] around people you know you can't hide
[21:14] from god god knows who you are that's
[21:16] the same judgment you're going to
[21:18] receive one day yourself so you got to
[21:20] look inward and see what kind of purge
[21:23] that's the hardest thing for a human
[21:24] being is to really see themselves for
[21:28] how they really are you know
[21:31] there's a it's just one of the hardest
[21:33] things in life to really see yourself
[21:35] for who you are and he goes on to say
[21:37] here bear you one another's burdens so
[21:39] you fulfill the law of christ
[21:43] himself to be foreign when he is nothing
[21:45] he deceives himself and that i mean
[21:47] that's the world we live in people think
[21:49] of themselves
[21:51] more than they should but let every man
[21:53] prove
[21:54] his own words and then shall he be have
[21:57] rejoicing in himself alone and not in
[22:00] another
[22:01] for every man shall bear his own burden
[22:04] you know people can help you
[22:05] carry your burden and lead you through
[22:08] life but in the end when you cross over
[22:11] you're gonna you're gonna bear whatever
[22:13] you are you're gonna bear it over to the
[22:14] other side whether it's good or bad
[22:16] you're gonna carry it with you whatever
[22:18] bag that you have on your heart and on
[22:20] your life you know like brother branham
[22:22] said the things you're gonna carry over
[22:25] are not physical things they're
[22:26] spiritual things whatever whatever
[22:29] you've done you're going to carry it
[22:30] over to the other side unless you've
[22:32] made it right and he goes on to say here
[22:35] so
[22:36] every man shall bear his own burden and
[22:38] it says let him that is taught in the
[22:40] communicate unto him that teaches and
[22:42] all good things and this devotion will
[22:45] go to this here this morning and be not
[22:47] deceived god is not mine
[22:49] whatsoever a man so if that shall he
[22:51] also reap
[22:53] and then i was reading this this morning
[22:55] and uh and then that's the scripture
[22:57] this man was dealing with
[22:59] and then he goes and it it's pretty
[23:02] true here what this guy has to say and
[23:05] this was in you know this was 1942 1943
[23:09] then you have
[23:11] up to the year 2022.
[23:14] this is not a threat it's more than a
[23:16] promise it's a statement of principle
[23:19] it's not a threat you're going to reap
[23:20] what you sow it's not a threat it's a
[23:23] principle
[23:24] you know a lot of people will say god is
[23:26] threatening me if i don't do right he's
[23:28] going to judge me in the end no he's
[23:30] telling you what he's going to do and
[23:32] then you have to as principal act on it
[23:36] accordingly and this is a war that will
[23:39] not last forever and then this same
[23:41] thing whatever your life is wherever
[23:43] you're at in your life
[23:45] that situation is not going to last
[23:47] forever and it goes
[23:48] on but longer
[23:51] for sure most men
[23:53] who are in armed forces of america will
[23:55] presently be back in civilian life but
[23:58] forget about that just think of whatever
[24:00] circumstances you're in you know
[24:02] whatever job you're in whatever part of
[24:04] your life you're in sooner or later you
[24:07] you're gonna be back again
[24:09] and the world will reap the harvest of
[24:11] the war same thing as an individual
[24:13] you'll reap the harvest of your own
[24:15] actions
[24:18] believe it's no different than the man
[24:20] you work with or your neighbor they're
[24:22] no different also and he goes on but the
[24:25] one thing that makes a man better than a
[24:27] beast is his ability to look ahead to
[24:29] determine his conduct today on the basis
[24:32] of what is to be tomorrow next week next
[24:36] year a thousand years from now what he's
[24:38] basically saying
[24:42] today
[24:43] you should live today knowing that
[24:44] tomorrow whatever tomorrow's going to be
[24:47] be the same christian that you were
[24:49] today tomorrow and he goes on to say
[24:52] think of yourself in years that are to
[24:53] be
[24:54] cling to your faith as you will wish the
[24:56] later time that you would have done and
[24:58] that's the same principle for today if
[25:01] don't be willing to compromise for who
[25:03] you are to make someone happy
[25:05] once you do that one time
[25:08] the next day they're going to ask you to
[25:10] do it twice as much and the day after
[25:12] that they're going to ask you to do it
[25:14] three or four times once you
[25:16] compromise your integrity
[25:19] it's over they're just going to continue
[25:21] to have you compromise it cling to your
[25:23] faith as you would wish it in a later
[25:25] time that you had done
[25:26] resist temptation today in such a way
[25:28] that you can rejoice in your victories
[25:31] 10 years from now or
[25:32] life he didn't say that i added that
[25:35] keep yourself as clean as you would
[25:37] when you look into the eyes of your pure
[25:40] wife and better days than this and
[25:42] that's a pretty good principle for young
[25:44] men or old men or men my age you know
[25:46] everything you do you've got to go home
[25:49] one day and you have to look in your
[25:50] wife's eyes you have to look in your
[25:52] children's eyes and you have to you have
[25:55] to reckon within yourself
[25:57] everything you've done and he goes on to
[26:00] say
[26:00] all your life do you not curse but bless
[26:03] the man you're to be when when the war
[26:06] is over whatever your life is over i've
[26:08] taken a lot of time but the most
[26:10] important thing i can see is paul said
[26:13] in galatians
[26:15] don't be deceived
[26:18] who you are this morning how you came
[26:20] here this morning whatever when you're
[26:22] not here behind these walls or
[26:25] when you're not on when you're on the
[26:26] other side of these double doors when
[26:28] you come in that's who you really are
[26:30] when no one's looking in the way you
[26:32] like that's who you really are you can't
[26:35] you can't hide from yourself that's

[52:46] we'll just go into his word
[52:49] psalms 5 verse 11 as he read it this
[52:51] morning but just read that scripture
[52:52] there it says but let those
[52:55] that put their trust
[52:57] in thee
[52:59] rejoice
[53:00] who puts your trust in him
[53:03] everything going on in this world where
[53:05] else should we put our trust
[53:07] is in thee
[53:08] they rejoice

[53:13] i tell the kids all the time i tell the
[53:15] youth all the time you know the world is
[53:17] happy to let you know how
[53:20] converted they are
[53:22] the world is excited to let you know
[53:24] that i love a man or a woman loves a
[53:26] woman
[53:27] the world is excited to let you know how
[53:29] crazy they are about everything that is
[53:32] a perverted state

[53:54] be joyful unto thee forget your
[53:56] scripture we'll go to psalms 51. i'll
[53:58] let you have your seats after that if we
[54:00] could this morning i would title it
[54:02] coming out of psalms 51
[54:04] restore
[54:05] unto me the joy
[54:08] of thy salvation 1962 in questions and
[54:11] answers read this right
[54:13] fast kind of got my thought when i
[54:15] started this a while back but he says
[54:18] whether i'm reading a question here and
[54:20] answering it he says i have lived this
[54:22] guy's brother's talking i've lived many
[54:24] years in sin
[54:26] until i found the lord
[54:28] he said please brother branham he says i
[54:32] have sinned again
[54:33] and i'm not worthy to come before you in
[54:36] this holy place please tell me
[54:38] i can be restored whole
[54:40] again
[54:42] brother brown says yes
[54:44] you have not sinned my friend so far in
[54:47] god that you could not be restored
[54:49] if you had sinned so far that you could
[54:51] not be restored you'd never
[54:54] want to be restored see
[54:57] but as long as there's something dealing
[55:00] with your heart
[55:01] you're still in line of resurrection
[55:05] he said now there's a place you can
[55:06] cross that you can't get back but you've
[55:08] got to go down here and again the same
[55:10] shape that you was it goes to show that
[55:13] you only fell
[55:14] from grace
[55:16] he said backsliding is not lost
[55:19] i want somebody to tell me where
[55:21] backsliding is lost and prove it in the
[55:24] bible a bachelor is not lost he's just
[55:27] out of fellowship
[55:29] israel black slid but they never lost
[55:31] their covenant they lost their praise
[55:34] and their joy
[55:36] david lost the joy of his salvation when
[55:40] he took the siba yuri's urethra's life
[55:43] but he never lost his salvation
[55:46] he never said restore unto me my
[55:48] salvation he said restore to me the joy
[55:53] of my salvation
[55:55] psalm 61
[55:56] read it real quickly and let you be
[55:58] seated have mercy upon me o god
[56:01] according to thy loving kindness
[56:04] according to that multiple
[56:05] of the tender mercies blot out my
[56:07] transgressions

[56:12] cleanse me from my sin
[56:14] for i acknowledge my transgressions and
[56:15] my sin is ever before me and against
[56:18] thee the only have i sinned
[56:20] and done this evil in thy sight

[56:38] and the hidden parts that they shall
[56:40] make me to know wisdom

[56:44] clean and wash me and i shall be wider
[56:47] than snow

[56:56] for my sins and blot out my iniquities
[57:00] create
[57:01] in me a clean heart o god
[57:04] and renew a right spirit within me
[57:07] cast me not away from my presence
[57:10] and take not thy holy spirit for me
[57:13] but restore unto me
[57:15] the joy
[57:17] of thy salvation
[57:19] heavenly father lord
[57:21] lord we love you this morning lord
[57:24] lord whirling full acknowledgement lord
[57:25] that without you we're nothing
[57:28] but lord with one word from you lord
[57:30] everything
[57:32] can be made well
[57:34] lord i asked you this morning lord to
[57:36] take every spirit and every thought
[57:38] that's not like you under your control
[57:40] lord drive it from the presence of this
[57:42] building lord give us freedom to have
[57:44] joy this morning lord give us freedom to
[57:47] worship your holy name lord lord move
[57:49] myself aside lord lord i am nothing lord
[57:52] i failed time and time again but with
[57:55] you on my side
[57:57] i can create
[57:58] i can do all things
[58:00] amen lord jesus be with us lord i pray
[58:02] say something lord to benefit your
[58:04] people
[58:05] in your lovely name we pray
[58:07] amen and amen and you can be seated and
[58:09] i thought of this and i thought you know
[58:11] we go through
[58:13] throw that down
[58:14] we go through life
[58:16] so many times and we allow the
[58:18] circumstances of our life get us unhappy
[58:22] we allow things to happen you know so
[58:24] many times if we're not careful we let
[58:26] the devil be victorious when he's not
[58:28] victorious
[58:29] he comes in our lives and he puts
[58:31] anything and everything before you to
[58:33] steal your joy why because if he can
[58:36] steal your joy and your happiness that
[58:38] he has stowed your life
[58:39] life is not worth living if you're not
[58:41] happy life is not worth living why does
[58:44] depression come on why does mental
[58:46] illnesses come on because they lose
[58:48] their joy they lose their satisfaction
[58:50] for living they lose their happiness for
[58:52] being alive they lose their joy for
[58:55] serving the lord and you see them
[58:57] backslide out into the world you see
[58:59] them go into all these spirits begin to
[59:01] take control why because they lost their
[59:03] joy
[59:04] because you know what you find the
[59:05] brother and sister that's happy and
[59:07] where they're at and you ain't got to
[59:09] worry about the devil winning their
[59:10] factory because they're going to win
[59:12] every battle why because they're
[59:14] satisfied and knowing the lord they
[59:16] serve is the lord that gives them
[59:18] happiness it's the lord that gives them
[59:20] the joy that they have and you know what
[59:22] we go through life and if not careful we
[59:25] allow the enemy to take our own lives
[59:27] away from us
[59:28] look as i said before i get so sick and
[59:31] tired of the world telling me how happy
[59:33] they are but i can't get a christian to
[59:35] tell me how happy they are well let me
[59:37] tell you something i'm happy this
[59:39] morning i'm happy that god took me from
[59:42] the world i'm happy that he took me from
[59:44] the perversion i'm happy that he opened
[59:46] my eyes to the message of this earth to
[59:49] let me see i am full of joy
[59:53] so how can you be happy living in the
[59:54] day because i know what my future holds
[59:58] i know where i'm going children of god
[1:00:00] this isn't my final resting place
[1:00:03] this isn't my destination he's going to
[1:00:06] conquer this world
[1:00:08] he's going to destroy every aspect of it
[1:00:10] and i'm going to come back and live with
[1:00:12] him forever
[1:00:14] and you know what there ain't gonna be
[1:00:15] no perversion over there there ain't
[1:00:18] gonna be no sicknesses over there there
[1:00:20] ain't gonna be no crying for sadness
[1:00:22] over there they're just gonna be tears
[1:00:24] of joy in our lives
[1:00:25] but you know i find this and and i read
[1:00:28] the quote there i read the scripture and
[1:00:30] i find the word restore is to bring back
[1:00:33] it is to bring it to a previous right or
[1:00:36] a practice or a condition or a situation
[1:00:39] or to reinstate one where they fell from
[1:00:43] and you realize before the foundation of
[1:00:45] the world you were children of god
[1:00:48] before the foundation of the world you
[1:00:50] was chosen to live in this age
[1:00:53] he's just putting you back in your place
[1:00:55] restore his bag lord restore that joy
[1:00:57] back
[1:00:59] look at david's condition in second
[1:01:00] samuel we'll we'll kind of hit this and
[1:01:03] i'll try to preach like an evangelist
[1:01:04] i'll get over the stuff and then we'll
[1:01:06] get happy
[1:01:07] okay but you know what there's a story
[1:01:09] in the bible for every situation we go
[1:01:12] through there's an example laid before
[1:01:15] us that we may see
[1:01:17] what is it that's filling my joy
[1:01:20] and i find this example in second second
[1:01:22] look before we read it remember david
[1:01:24] falls into a backslidden condition
[1:01:27] he chose to follow the desire of the
[1:01:29] flesh over the desire of god look he was
[1:01:33] a man after god's own heart i'm not
[1:01:35] speaking evil of david david was a man
[1:01:38] after god's own heart but he was a man
[1:01:41] and he had mistakes in his life children
[1:01:44] of god that should encourage us to know
[1:01:46] that though he was a man though he was
[1:01:48] chosen of god he made mistakes so are
[1:01:51] you and i
[1:01:53] we're men and women of god
[1:01:56] we're brothers and sisters of christ we
[1:01:57] are the pride of christ even though we
[1:02:00] make mistakes we are the pride of christ
[1:02:06] i was talking to a young person last
[1:02:08] night and they said you know i just
[1:02:09] don't understand because it just seems
[1:02:11] like every time i put one foot forward i
[1:02:13] fall back three feet and i said well
[1:02:15] that's a good sign why because we've
[1:02:17] heard it and heard it and heard it but
[1:02:19] let's take it to our hearts this morning
[1:02:21] if the enemy is fighting you it means
[1:02:23] you're on the opposite side
[1:02:26] it means you're in the right path
[1:02:29] what is this david
[1:02:30] he did he chose that why did he choose
[1:02:32] that he chose that for the desire of his
[1:02:35] flesh over the desire of god what did he
[1:02:37] choose he chose boshiba
[1:02:39] she was fair to look upon it pleased his
[1:02:42] flesh
[1:02:43] it brought happiness for a time and he
[1:02:45] chose
[1:02:47] because he knew that it was wrong
[1:02:50] look children of god let's just be real
[1:02:51] honest
[1:02:52] most of the things that we do we do
[1:02:54] knowing the wrong
[1:02:56] we've been raised around the message of
[1:02:57] the air we've been the church we've
[1:02:59] heard the word come forth we know right
[1:03:02] and wrong i'm not being illegal but we
[1:03:04] know what god wants and what he don't
[1:03:07] hold but yet we choose
[1:03:10] what we do
[1:03:11] david knew that it was not white to take
[1:03:14] a walk off
[1:03:15] of a off of a roof that was a wife to
[1:03:17] another man he knew that was not right
[1:03:20] but yet
[1:03:22] he he did it anyway
[1:03:24] that's what took his joy that's what
[1:03:27] took his happiness that's what the
[1:03:29] dissatisfication that's what took
[1:03:31] everything from him
[1:03:33] what was it he chose because he knew
[1:03:35] what he was what was right and wrong
[1:03:37] help us lord we make decisions every day
[1:03:41] and we know what's right and wrong when
[1:03:44] i was 12 13 years old brother carol used
[1:03:46] to tell people he said my little 12 13
[1:03:49] year old
[1:03:50] could twist the minds the theologians
[1:03:52] and the baptists why because they have
[1:03:54] heard what is right and wrong
[1:03:57] we've been in this message too long we
[1:03:59] have heard this ministry preached too
[1:04:01] long we know the scripture too well we
[1:04:03] have the holy ghost that is leading us
[1:04:06] every day
[1:04:07] our life we know what's right and wrong
[1:04:10] but yeah we still choose
[1:04:12] look we do the same thing with our
[1:04:14] finances
[1:04:15] you know look he's making a thousand
[1:04:17] dollars a month should not have a 500
[1:04:19] car payment but boy that car looks good
[1:04:22] but we know we're not going to be able
[1:04:24] to pay for it
[1:04:25] we know there's going to come a time
[1:04:26] we're not going to put the bill and
[1:04:28] they're going to come get the car
[1:04:29] but we got to look good for everybody
[1:04:31] around us
[1:04:32] like david
[1:04:34] david made a choice
[1:04:35] to make himself happy
[1:04:37] he made a choice that pleased his flesh
[1:04:39] he made a choice that went against what
[1:04:41] god wanted him to do but you know what
[1:04:44] he still come to church and sunday
[1:04:45] morning with his suit on
[1:04:46] he still had a smile on his face
[1:04:49] so you think joy is a smile no anybody
[1:04:51] can put a fake smile on you can put a
[1:04:54] suit on you become the church but on the
[1:04:56] inside of the inside you know where your
[1:04:58] joy is
[1:04:59] your pastor does do because you used to
[1:05:01] say amen and you don't know
[1:05:03] you used to raise your hand and you
[1:05:04] don't raise your head no more you used
[1:05:06] to be willing to sing but now you don't
[1:05:08] want to sing no more why because you've
[1:05:10] lost your joy for the word
[1:05:14] david lost his joy
[1:05:16] but he lost it because of what he did
[1:05:19] of what god did
[1:05:20] second samuel 11 we're going to read it
[1:05:23] and it came to pass after the year was
[1:05:24] expired at the time the kings go forth
[1:05:27] to battle
[1:05:29] david sent jacob and his servants with
[1:05:31] him in all of israel and they destroyed
[1:05:33] the children of amen and they be seized
[1:05:35] rabith
[1:05:36] but david tarried still in jerusalem
[1:05:40] what was it the first thing he got out
[1:05:41] of place
[1:05:43] he's a king
[1:05:44] he's supposed to go with his spoofs he's
[1:05:47] supposed to be in the forefront he's
[1:05:48] supposed to be leading his troops in the
[1:05:50] battle but yet he stayed home
[1:05:52] what happens to us so many times we know
[1:05:54] we're supposed to be at church but we
[1:05:56] stay home
[1:05:57] and instead of streaming we watch some
[1:05:59] video on youtube come on
[1:06:02] let's be honest
[1:06:03] it's dynasty this morning okay we're
[1:06:05] going to get somewhere we're going to
[1:06:06] get excited because god gave us a way
[1:06:08] out of this he knew what we would face
[1:06:11] he knew what we would go through he knew
[1:06:13] the battles that we would fight
[1:06:16] he knew the decisions that each and
[1:06:17] every one of us would make
[1:06:19] every day of our life but yet he gave us
[1:06:22] a way out
[1:06:25] and it came to pass
[1:06:27] in the evening time david arose from his
[1:06:29] bed
[1:06:30] and he walked upon the roofs of the
[1:06:31] king's house and then on the from the
[1:06:33] roof he saw a woman washing herself and
[1:06:36] the woman was very beautiful to look
[1:06:38] upon what he wouldn't have seen her if
[1:06:40] he'd have been where he's supposed to be
[1:06:42] children of god if we were supposed to
[1:06:45] be most of our trials won't occur
[1:06:49] come on
[1:06:51] if you're at church on sunday morning
[1:06:53] you don't have to worry about what's
[1:06:54] playing on tv
[1:06:55] because you're a church hearing from god
[1:06:58] if you're in church on wednesday night
[1:06:59] you ain't got to worry about what the
[1:07:00] world's doing or what the news is doing
[1:07:02] because you're coming to the house of
[1:07:04] the lord to worship and praise your
[1:07:06] breaker
[1:07:07] but when you leave where you're supposed
[1:07:08] to be
[1:07:10] that's when the devil's going to come
[1:07:12] why
[1:07:13] because he's a good adversary
[1:07:15] he's a good enemy
[1:07:17] and he knows if he can get you to back
[1:07:19] up just a little bit he's going to
[1:07:21] attack
[1:07:22] what is it just in the in the common
[1:07:23] place of war when you know we he we made
[1:07:26] the devotion from world war ii but you
[1:07:28] know what when you're in battle and
[1:07:30] you're in one of the world wars korean
[1:07:32] war vietnam whatever it was the enemy is
[1:07:35] looking for you to step back
[1:07:38] because if they can ever get that enemy
[1:07:41] to step back that's when they're going
[1:07:43] to full charge
[1:07:44] because they've said they've noticed
[1:07:46] that that you you know you're losing
[1:07:48] your footing
[1:07:49] that you're the enemy is losing their
[1:07:51] footing and they're trying to retreat to
[1:07:54] find a better place and that's the best
[1:07:56] time to attack oh the devil knows the
[1:07:59] same thing
[1:08:00] when he gets you to miss one service
[1:08:02] he's coming when he gets you to miss one
[1:08:04] prayer meeting he's coming when he gets
[1:08:06] you not to read your devotion one
[1:08:08] morning he's coming why because he sees
[1:08:11] you're retreating to what you say you
[1:08:12] believe
[1:08:14] and he's coming
[1:08:15] he's coming for everything that you are
[1:08:18] what is it
[1:08:19] he said he goes on that he says and it
[1:08:21] came to pass
[1:08:22] he said and then in
[1:08:24] david terry still in jerusalem and it
[1:08:27] came to pass in the evening time that
[1:08:28] david arose from his bed he's seen a
[1:08:31] shiva and david seen and inquired after
[1:08:33] this woman and he said it's not this
[1:08:36] placebo the daughter of them the ivy
[1:08:39] right of the hittites and david sent
[1:08:41] messages and took her and she came unto
[1:08:43] him and he left for she was purified
[1:08:45] from her tongue to her and cleanliness
[1:08:47] and she returned to her house
[1:08:50] and the woman conceived
[1:08:52] and sent until david said i am with
[1:08:54] child
[1:08:55] see now david
[1:08:56] loses
[1:08:58] joy
[1:08:59] because now david knows
[1:09:01] he's done something
[1:09:03] and now there's a consequence coming
[1:09:04] behind it come on children of god
[1:09:07] when do we lose our joy when we realize
[1:09:09] that we've made a mistake and there's a
[1:09:11] consequence coming behind it you see all
[1:09:13] of these professional athletes give
[1:09:15] these these written statements of
[1:09:17] apology there's no apology in that you
[1:09:20] can read a written statement all day
[1:09:22] long but you know what you hit a real
[1:09:24] christian you hit a real child of god on
[1:09:26] the inside of the inside where it hurts
[1:09:28] and they lose their joy
[1:09:31] because they know what they did is wrong
[1:09:36] what is it
[1:09:37] so many times the things that get us in
[1:09:38] the most trouble is the choices we make
[1:09:42] look
[1:09:43] i'd love to live in a society that god
[1:09:45] had done predestinated for ordained he
[1:09:47] did predestinate for a day but that i
[1:09:49] would never make a mistake
[1:09:50] he didn't do that
[1:09:52] he just knew that i'd always turn back
[1:09:54] to him he just knew that every time
[1:09:57] david made a mistake david would turn
[1:09:59] back to his word and say god forgive me
[1:10:02] for my iniquities
[1:10:04] this isn't who i really desire to be but
[1:10:06] what was it we if we read on down second
[1:10:10] chapter uh second and same new verse 11
[1:10:12] and verse 27 23 says in the messengers i
[1:10:16] look
[1:10:17] we skipped a little bit
[1:10:18] david is now
[1:10:20] going to make it right
[1:10:22] oh come on church
[1:10:23] how many times we do something wrong and
[1:10:25] we're going to make it right
[1:10:27] we can't make it
[1:10:29] god's the only one that can make it
[1:10:30] right
[1:10:31] making it right didn't bring we're going
[1:10:33] to read it but making it right
[1:10:36] and bring happiness and joy back to
[1:10:37] david david thought you know what if i
[1:10:40] could just cover this up come on
[1:10:42] if i could just get a good quote to
[1:10:43] justify what i'm doing it'll be okay no
[1:10:46] it won't be
[1:10:47] because on the inside of the inside is a
[1:10:50] predestinated seat of god and it knows
[1:10:52] the truth
[1:10:54] and it's not putting up with anything
[1:10:55] else
[1:10:56] but david thought you know what i could
[1:10:58] cover this up i'm the king everybody
[1:11:00] respects me i can make this go away
[1:11:04] i'll just have your eye killed
[1:11:06] and then i'll marry her and nobody will
[1:11:09] think nothing about it
[1:11:10] so what does he do he goes in the
[1:11:12] scripture and he sends your eye out in
[1:11:14] the very front you know what i always
[1:11:16] say he sent you out with the note
[1:11:19] that was going to kill him
[1:11:21] brother branham said in one place your
[1:11:22] eye was closer to god than brother than
[1:11:25] david
[1:11:39] on children of god what is it that's my
[1:11:41] desire in my heart god whatever you want
[1:11:43] me to do let me do it
[1:11:45] but see david was trying to cover it up
[1:11:47] and so he went out and he got killed
[1:11:50] in verse 23 it says in the messenger
[1:11:51] said unto david surely the man prevailed
[1:11:54] against us and he came back under this
[1:11:56] field and we were upon and even and then
[1:11:58] near the gates and the shooters shot
[1:12:00] from authority from the wall upon that
[1:12:02] servants some of the king's servants be
[1:12:04] dead and thy servant you had the hittite
[1:12:06] is dead also
[1:12:08] you know what i get from that scripture
[1:12:10] david was okay with losing some of his
[1:12:12] generals as long as your eye went down
[1:12:15] too
[1:12:16] come on children of god
[1:12:17] 2022
[1:12:19] there's some believers it's okay if it
[1:12:21] takes some other families out just as
[1:12:23] long as it gets the one they don't like
[1:12:25] they're willing to sacrifice half the
[1:12:28] church they're willing to sacrifice half
[1:12:29] of their own family just to cover their
[1:12:32] own sin
[1:12:33] come on i told you to be rough we'll get
[1:12:35] through this come on
[1:12:38] how do you know i'm there
[1:12:40] because i'm there
[1:12:42] because i'm human i live in 2022. i
[1:12:45] don't i don't go live on a cloud
[1:12:46] somewhere where there ain't no battles
[1:12:48] i go to work five days a week
[1:12:51] i deal with people i deal with young
[1:12:52] people i talk to young people i know
[1:12:54] what they're going through what is it
[1:12:55] we're living in a day that the battle is
[1:12:58] stronger than it's ever been the devil
[1:13:00] is at your footsteps he is at your door
[1:13:02] he is in your mind he is trying to tell
[1:13:05] you to do things wrong
[1:13:09] and then david said unto the messenger
[1:13:11] thus shall there say unto job let not
[1:13:14] this thing displease thee
[1:13:16] for the sword divine earth one as well
[1:13:19] as another and make that battle more
[1:13:21] strong against the city and overthrow it
[1:13:23] and encourage them
[1:13:25] well it's pretty
[1:13:27] don't take this wrong but that's a
[1:13:28] pretty sad picture of david
[1:13:31] that david's
[1:13:33] excited
[1:13:35] that he lost some men
[1:13:37] come on the children of god we should
[1:13:38] never be excited to lose one we have one
[1:13:41] walk out of the church we ought to go to
[1:13:42] our knees and fast and pray for them i
[1:13:44] don't care what that old kids you've
[1:13:45] heard of i don't care if the pastor's
[1:13:47] heard i don't care if they've got every
[1:13:48] pet peeve in the world against the
[1:13:49] church if one walks out of this
[1:13:51] congregation it should drive the rest of
[1:13:53] the church to inhale to the fast to
[1:13:55] bring that one so back
[1:13:58] but he was happy that he lost some men
[1:14:01] because he lost your eye
[1:14:02] you know what he said he said that
[1:14:03] scripture would say what he was going
[1:14:05] down he said they started saying to joke
[1:14:07] let not this displease you
[1:14:09] so now he's using his power of influence
[1:14:12] to encourage everybody that it's okay
[1:14:15] come on
[1:14:17] they do it all around the message
[1:14:19] they name drop like crazy
[1:14:21] well brother so-and-so said it's okay so
[1:14:23] you have to believe it no i ain't my my
[1:14:25] life and my word is not based upon
[1:14:27] brother so and so
[1:14:29] my life and my word and my revelation is
[1:14:32] based upon god almighty and if he's not
[1:14:35] happy i'm not happy i don't care who's
[1:14:37] happy
[1:14:40] maybe that's why i don't go out and
[1:14:41] preach because i ain't popular but you
[1:14:43] know what i don't care the word of god
[1:14:45] was displeased with what david said done
[1:14:48] let's finish reading that he says
[1:14:50] and the wife of
[1:14:52] and when the wife
[1:14:54] has you i've heard that iran who hurt
[1:14:56] her uriah her husband was dead she
[1:14:58] mourned for her husband and when the
[1:15:00] morning was passed david sent and
[1:15:02] fetched her to his house and she became
[1:15:04] his wife and bear his son
[1:15:06] and everybody lives happy ever after
[1:15:10] no
[1:15:11] the scripture says
[1:15:13] but the thing that david had done
[1:15:16] displeased the lord
[1:15:18] he wasn't happy with david's decision
[1:15:21] he gave david a choice to choose him or
[1:15:23] his flesh david had chosen rome
[1:15:26] but you know what didn't matter how
[1:15:27] displeased god was with him he was still
[1:15:29] david
[1:15:30] he was still called the king of god's
[1:15:32] people he was still looked upon by god
[1:15:35] as a man after his own hearts and you
[1:15:38] know what it don't matter how many times
[1:15:39] you make the wrong decision it don't
[1:15:41] matter how many times the devil tries to
[1:15:42] steal everything your joy your happiness
[1:15:45] your
[1:15:46] revelation everything that you have he
[1:15:48] can't take you from the hand of god
[1:15:50] jesus through there says all that he
[1:15:52] gave me is in my head i shall not lose a
[1:15:56] one
[1:15:57] what is he saying he says i don't care
[1:15:59] what you've done you can come back to
[1:16:01] this joy you can come back to this
[1:16:03] happiness
[1:16:05] because you
[1:16:06] are a child of god
[1:16:08] they say once this thing happens
[1:16:10] david's joy leaves him
[1:16:12] david knows in his heart what he's done
[1:16:14] david knows what he's done is wrong but
[1:16:17] he puts on a sunday morning
[1:16:19] she puts on a suit of clothes and he
[1:16:20] comes into his kingship and he says
[1:16:22] everybody all it's okay god's in this no
[1:16:25] god ain't in this
[1:16:27] it decreased
[1:16:29] god
[1:16:31] but in his heart
[1:16:32] he knew he wasn't right
[1:16:34] you know what second samuel 12 then
[1:16:36] nathan confronts david
[1:16:39] why do we need a prophet in this day to
[1:16:40] confront us
[1:16:42] why do we need to listen to the messages
[1:16:44] in this day to be confronted by his word
[1:16:47] why do we come to church and have a
[1:16:49] pastor to be confronted with his word
[1:16:52] when we make decisions that ain't the
[1:16:53] best decisions in the world when we
[1:16:55] start wandering away
[1:16:57] from what god called us to be that's
[1:17:00] what god sent a pastor to do is to reach
[1:17:02] out and say open your eyes look back at
[1:17:05] the word bring you back into fellowship
[1:17:09] thank you
[1:17:12] back in the fellowship
[1:17:13] look one night when nathan would
[1:17:15] confront the prophet of that day he
[1:17:17] would confront david of his backslidden
[1:17:19] condition david finally confesses
[1:17:22] second samuel 12 but look worst
[1:17:25] see without joy you know what you know
[1:17:26] you know what the lack of joy brings
[1:17:29] anger
[1:17:31] because if i ain't happy you can't be
[1:17:33] happy
[1:17:34] come on
[1:17:36] come on
[1:17:37] if i ain't happy ain't nobody in the
[1:17:38] dirt's gonna be happy
[1:17:40] just look you know it ain't my problem
[1:17:42] that you made the wrong choice and you
[1:17:43] can't get back to god because i don't
[1:17:44] got back to god and he's done got his
[1:17:46] hand reached out and he's then asking
[1:17:48] you to come back in the fellowship
[1:17:51] he's asking you
[1:17:52] to restore your joy
[1:17:54] what is it
[1:17:56] anger comes back and you become critical
[1:17:58] how many knows them see when i said it
[1:18:00] every one of you and you thought of
[1:18:01] somebody
[1:18:02] pray it wasn't nobody in here
[1:18:07] when they lose their joy they become
[1:18:08] critical
[1:18:10] they begin to look at your life and they
[1:18:11] go oh wow see i seen him slip up at the
[1:18:14] 7-eleven the other day
[1:18:16] come on
[1:18:17] i said you know what he that brother
[1:18:19] used to say amen 17 times and now he
[1:18:22] says it two times
[1:18:24] see he's backslid on god
[1:18:26] you know that's the greatest defensive
[1:18:28] mechanism that we got
[1:18:30] is to tell other people
[1:18:31] i used to say all right i don't used to
[1:18:33] i still say in the business world when
[1:18:35] we're doing business deals and
[1:18:36] everything if i have someone come to me
[1:18:38] and they begin to downgrade somebody
[1:18:40] else i'm done with them
[1:18:42] i'm done with them because if you're so
[1:18:45] low in your confidence that you have to
[1:18:47] cut everybody around you down to make
[1:18:50] yourself feel superior you're the issue
[1:18:53] come on
[1:18:54] you're the issue you know what i don't
[1:18:56] believe in cutting people down they've
[1:18:57] been lifting people up i believe in
[1:19:00] taking people that i may not even agree
[1:19:02] with and placing them up above me and
[1:19:04] saying god use them for your service but
[1:19:08] use them in your life
[1:19:10] they become legalistic what's the
[1:19:12] second samuel 12.
[1:19:14] almost through the rough part
[1:19:16] second sabbath 21 david's anger was
[1:19:18] greatly kindled against the man
[1:19:21] against what man the prophet
[1:19:24] come on
[1:19:25] the day we're living and how many people
[1:19:26] is greatly angled against the prophet
[1:19:29] they don't want to hear all that he said
[1:19:30] they
[1:19:31] just want to hear what they like what he
[1:19:32] said
[1:19:33] they want to splice the tapes up
[1:19:36] they want to listen to the tape they
[1:19:38] want to listen to
[1:19:39] i want to listen to all the tapes
[1:19:41] because if he's got something to correct
[1:19:43] me i want to be corrected
[1:19:46] and david's anger
[1:19:48] was greatly kindled against the man
[1:19:51] and he said unto nathan
[1:19:53] as the lord liveth
[1:19:55] the man that had done this should surely
[1:19:57] die
[1:19:58] what is he doing look look we just
[1:20:00] script scripture i'm sorry but we looked
[1:20:02] at the scripture we find that
[1:20:04] nathan gives him an example
[1:20:07] of what david did
[1:20:09] and david's ready to kill him
[1:20:11] and he said he said and have done this
[1:20:14] thing he said surely die and he said
[1:20:16] restore the lamb for fold because he did
[1:20:19] this thing and because he had no pity
[1:20:22] well he's all legalistic now and
[1:20:26] well he let them people know
[1:20:28] they don't left god they don't they
[1:20:30] deserve to die
[1:20:32] about half the people
[1:20:34] want a message come on
[1:20:36] look what you don't believe it the way i
[1:20:37] believe it so you just don't believe the
[1:20:39] message
[1:20:40] no i believe the message is god has
[1:20:42] given a prophet to speak a message under
[1:20:44] my heart and as he is revealed upon his
[1:20:48] knowledge and his good term to open the
[1:20:50] revelation in my heart that i can see
[1:20:52] what the prophet said
[1:20:54] know what you said but what god said
[1:20:57] and nathan said unto david thou art that
[1:21:01] man
[1:21:03] thus saith the lord god of israel i
[1:21:05] anointed the king over israel i
[1:21:07] delivered thee out of the hand of saul i
[1:21:09] gave thee to thy master's house that
[1:21:11] master's wives into thy bosom i gave to
[1:21:14] the house of israel to judah and into
[1:21:16] that and if that had been too little i
[1:21:18] would more ever give it unto thee such
[1:21:20] and such things
[1:21:22] come on you know what i hear when i read
[1:21:24] that scripture
[1:21:25] i hear god saying jonathan i have given
[1:21:28] you
[1:21:29] everything that you have need of
[1:21:31] in this day
[1:21:33] i have given you salvation of your sins
[1:21:36] i have given you forgiveness of you all
[1:21:38] of your sins and iniquities
[1:21:42] forgiven you i have been
[1:21:44] i have given
[1:21:45] you the power to be in a rhetoric right
[1:21:48] i have given you everything
[1:21:51] and if there would have been enough how
[1:21:52] to get any more
[1:21:56] wherefore there has despised the
[1:21:58] commandment of the lord to do evil
[1:22:00] in his sight and there has killed he
[1:22:02] arrived the hittite by the sword and has
[1:22:05] taken his wife
[1:22:08] and i slain him with the sword
[1:22:13] what was it
[1:22:15] it thought he had a good cover-up going
[1:22:16] on
[1:22:18] but you don't cover nothing up from god
[1:22:21] look when your pastor gets up here and
[1:22:23] he preaches something and you think that
[1:22:25] he's been reading your text
[1:22:28] he about
[1:22:29] but god laid it on his heart to go right
[1:22:31] down that alley
[1:22:32] thank god for a prophet
[1:22:35] thank god for for a five-fold ministry
[1:22:38] in this day that'll yield themselves to
[1:22:40] god and come right to where i live
[1:22:43] and say this is what you've been talking
[1:22:45] about
[1:22:46] see this is you david i know the real
[1:22:48] truth
[1:22:54] it lingers with us it won't go away
[1:22:58] it steals our boy like it did david's
[1:23:01] but it always guides us
[1:23:04] back to the word
[1:23:06] it always guides us
[1:23:08] back to his word
[1:23:10] no wonder god could say david you're a
[1:23:12] man after my own heart
[1:23:14] because even when you think you had the
[1:23:15] greatest cover-up in the world
[1:23:17] when i sent a prophet
[1:23:19] to unveil the truth
[1:23:21] you went through your knees repenting
[1:23:24] because you knew
[1:23:25] god knew
[1:23:27] brother branham in the innerval in 1956
[1:23:29] he says i said i'm a leaf
[1:23:32] i said smoking cigarettes and drink
[1:23:34] you're saying and running around with
[1:23:36] this
[1:23:37] is this very symptom it's the attributes
[1:23:39] of your unbelief
[1:23:41] i said you do not believe he says you do
[1:23:43] not because you don't believe jesus
[1:23:46] jesus says he that hears my words and
[1:23:49] believeth on him that sent me have
[1:23:51] everlasting life
[1:23:53] brother birmingham says when you say
[1:23:55] you're a believer and you do that it
[1:23:58] shows that something's
[1:24:00] wrong
[1:24:02] you don't believe
[1:24:04] get out like you believe you're taking
[1:24:05] reasonings and and not taking your
[1:24:07] soul's conviction
[1:24:09] because your soul is part of god that
[1:24:11] it's in you and it'll agree with the
[1:24:14] god's word
[1:24:15] it
[1:24:16] would just take out your intellectual
[1:24:19] your thinking
[1:24:20] what is he
[1:24:21] conviction does is good
[1:24:23] come on it brings us back to joy you
[1:24:25] don't have joy this morning
[1:24:27] find what it is that you backed up from
[1:24:30] god
[1:24:32] look it may not have been a great sin it
[1:24:33] may not have been adultery it may it may
[1:24:35] not have been murder it may not have
[1:24:37] been
[1:24:38] but what was it
[1:24:39] but it goes on down he says
[1:24:41] and he has to pass that away says and
[1:24:44] know that conviction can make you very
[1:24:45] restless
[1:24:47] it does that
[1:24:48] it's our good praying wife or mother can
[1:24:50] do more for the kingdom of god on our
[1:24:52] knees what is it it makes you restless
[1:24:54] it makes you unhappy
[1:24:56] it makes you not want to go to church it
[1:24:58] makes you not want to fellowship with
[1:24:59] brothers and sisters because there's
[1:25:01] something telling you their joy
[1:25:04] is gone and you're putting a faith on
[1:25:06] but god gives us a way back
[1:25:08] what is it doing we read psalms 51 but
[1:25:11] psalms 32 is it's david leading up into
[1:25:15] what he was actually filling in the 52
[1:25:17] he's crying out to god see that's what
[1:25:19] we need to do is we need to cry out to
[1:25:21] god
[1:25:22] we need to cry out to god for god
[1:25:24] restore the joy of my salvation let me
[1:25:27] realize i need more joy now than i've
[1:25:30] ever had you say oh but i'm born again
[1:25:32] living right but i still need more joy
[1:25:36] i need happiness i need the ability to
[1:25:39] put a smile on my face without trying to
[1:25:41] and saying god i love you
[1:25:45] as far as i know my heart is clear
[1:25:47] and my heart is clean
[1:25:49] what was it he said it inverted no
[1:25:53] jeremiah 29 11
[1:25:54] the scripture says well i know the
[1:25:57] thoughts that i think towards you saith
[1:25:59] the lord thoughts of peace and not of
[1:26:01] evil to give you an expected end
[1:26:04] see these are the promises i look at
[1:26:06] because you know what they're the ones
[1:26:07] that make me happy david wanting us to
[1:26:10] be he's crying out to god to restore the
[1:26:12] joy of the salvation he says what does
[1:26:15] he do he goes back to the word and he
[1:26:17] begins to see
[1:26:18] what was it and david when david would
[1:26:20] come and and then and saul was after his
[1:26:22] life and he was hiding away in another
[1:26:24] country and david was fighting the fight
[1:26:26] and he come home and all of his women
[1:26:28] and all of his lives all of his children
[1:26:30] was gone right he says you know what
[1:26:32] i've done something wrong what did he do
[1:26:34] the scripture says he went and
[1:26:36] encouraged himself what does the
[1:26:38] scripture say that he did he went and
[1:26:39] took the press plate and put it on what
[1:26:41] was the breath right there you're on
[1:26:43] thermal brother brother and said this
[1:26:44] word is our you're on tumblr today when
[1:26:47] you need to go back and encourage
[1:26:48] yourself go back to the word and find
[1:26:51] out god you're the joy giver you're the
[1:26:53] happiness giver you're the salvation
[1:26:56] giver you're the healer of almighty
[1:26:57] season you are that one
[1:27:00] i placed it before me more than anything
[1:27:02] that i have in romans 8 28 says and we
[1:27:05] know that all things work together for
[1:27:08] good to them that
[1:27:09] love god to them that are called
[1:27:12] according to his purpose do you believe
[1:27:14] you're called according to his purpose
[1:27:16] so everything that happens happens for a
[1:27:18] reason
[1:27:20] well i've heard that a thousand times
[1:27:21] we'll let it sink into your heart grab a
[1:27:24] hold of it and believe it like you've
[1:27:25] never believed it before when you go
[1:27:27] through a battle realize that is god
[1:27:29] proving you that is god training you
[1:27:32] that is god molding you to be an
[1:27:34] overcomer in this day
[1:27:36] you take a truth in the battlefield
[1:27:38] that never went to boot camp how do you
[1:27:40] think that'd make it
[1:27:42] come on
[1:27:43] the last thing we would want as a
[1:27:44] country is a bunch of young men that had
[1:27:46] never trained that never tried to should
[1:27:48] never been taught
[1:27:50] how to shoot a gun
[1:27:51] and we send them over to find a battle
[1:27:53] for us
[1:27:54] they could be completely lost they'd be
[1:27:55] overtaken our country would be defeated
[1:27:58] but you know what you what would you
[1:27:59] take with a christian that don't stay in
[1:28:01] training for god
[1:28:03] that don't stay happy before the lord
[1:28:05] reading his word reading the message
[1:28:07] what is it they're going to be overcome
[1:28:09] but god thank you so much
[1:28:12] philippians 1 6 says being confident in
[1:28:14] this very thing that we shared again a
[1:28:16] good work in you we'll perform it until
[1:28:18] the day of jesus christ
[1:28:20] he started this work in you he's going
[1:28:22] to finish this work in you he gave you
[1:28:25] joy and unprecedent he gave you
[1:28:28] happiness he's there to give it back to
[1:28:30] you if you just call out for it
[1:28:34] you say well
[1:28:36] why'd you think of this
[1:28:38] because i'm living in a day
[1:28:40] that i'm watching a christian
[1:28:42] people abroad around this world that's
[1:28:44] being forsaken and downtrodden and
[1:28:46] pushed down to no end
[1:28:49] but you know what she should be the
[1:28:50] happiest people
[1:28:52] alive
[1:28:55] come on i don't know how the world goes
[1:28:57] through the things they go through
[1:28:59] without a god on their side
[1:29:01] i don't know how the world goes through
[1:29:03] what they go through without a comforter
[1:29:05] the way my comforter is i don't know how
[1:29:07] they make decisions in life without a
[1:29:10] guide that he is to me
[1:29:12] i don't know how they go through
[1:29:13] sicknesses without knowing there's a
[1:29:15] healer that is in my life that can heal
[1:29:18] me from all of my diseases
[1:29:21] no wonder kobe drove people crazy could
[1:29:23] you imagine
[1:29:25] some of us has been through it if you
[1:29:26] didn't have god to fall back on no
[1:29:29] wonder it sent them insane
[1:29:31] because there's nothing they could do to
[1:29:32] come against it but i could i fall back
[1:29:35] on my knees and say god i am happy in
[1:29:38] your word i am happy in your message you
[1:29:41] said whatever sickness i have
[1:29:44] you could be that healer
[1:29:46] he's wanting us to be more happy
[1:29:48] today
[1:29:49] you know the biggest lie of the devil is
[1:29:52] to come in and tell you oh you've got to
[1:29:54] live such a holy restricted life that
[1:29:56] you can't be happy that's a lie
[1:29:59] if you can't be happy that means you're
[1:30:01] putting it on
[1:30:02] because if you ever get it on the real
[1:30:04] inside of the inside it makes you happy
[1:30:06] to live for god
[1:30:08] it's not a depression state
[1:30:10] it's not a it's not a burden to dress
[1:30:12] like a woman it's not a burden to act
[1:30:14] like a man there's something that
[1:30:16] excites you on
[1:30:17] the inside said let me show the world
[1:30:21] exactly
[1:30:23] my god is still alive
[1:30:25] psalms 32 ends with rejoice in the lord
[1:30:28] and be glad you righteous seeing all
[1:30:30] that you are upright in hearts
[1:30:33] david pleads with god to restore
[1:30:36] god restores it to david
[1:30:38] god looks at it and says no matter what
[1:30:40] you've done i'll forgive you and wash
[1:30:41] your sins from the world
[1:30:43] no one to know
[1:30:45] what the devil will bring it up what he
[1:30:47] does to us
[1:30:48] come on we ask for forgiveness we ask
[1:30:50] for something in our lives and we ask
[1:30:52] god to forgive us the devil brings it up
[1:30:54] every morning when we wake up
[1:30:56] you know what you did yesterday you know
[1:30:58] what you did last week you know what you
[1:31:00] did to that brother last month but you
[1:31:02] know what god has forgiven me of the
[1:31:04] devil
[1:31:05] you're the only one that remembers it
[1:31:07] there's a joy
[1:31:09] that is restored back in my heart joe
[1:31:12] 23 6 says will he plead again with me
[1:31:14] with great power no but he would put
[1:31:17] strength
[1:31:19] in me
[1:31:20] see when he restores your joy back he
[1:31:22] places a little more strength
[1:31:24] he places a little more character he
[1:31:26] gives the ability for the next time that
[1:31:28] david's gets out of the wheel when he
[1:31:30] sees another besheba he knows to turn
[1:31:32] his head and walk away
[1:31:34] come on he gives us the strength that
[1:31:35] the next time we click on a little video
[1:31:37] that we shouldn't be watching we turn
[1:31:39] our head and we hit the little x why
[1:31:41] because there's something in us that god
[1:31:43] has already used us to overcome that in
[1:31:45] our life i'm not going to
[1:31:48] fall for it again
[1:31:51] i'm not
[1:31:52] there's a joy inside of me
[1:31:55] james 1 2-4 says my brethren counting
[1:31:57] all joy when you fall in the diverse
[1:32:00] diverse temptations
[1:32:01] knowing this that the trying in your
[1:32:03] face
[1:32:04] work with patience
[1:32:06] but let patience have a perfect word
[1:32:07] that you may be perfect and entire
[1:32:10] warning nothing
[1:32:12] can we can we slow down just a second
[1:32:14] and thinking yourself nobody has to say
[1:32:16] it think in your mind
[1:32:18] in years ago a trial that you was going
[1:32:20] through
[1:32:21] what is it now
[1:32:24] it's nothing
[1:32:26] five years ago
[1:32:28] a sickness that you was in
[1:32:30] what is it now
[1:32:32] it's nothing
[1:32:34] come on a month ago
[1:32:36] something in your family going on
[1:32:38] that you just thought was the end of the
[1:32:40] only
[1:32:41] since
[1:32:43] where is it now
[1:32:45] it's gone
[1:32:46] why because we serve a god
[1:32:48] that is in control of all things
[1:32:52] and the biggest thing that you have
[1:32:53] going on in your life right now
[1:32:56] three months from now you won't even
[1:32:57] think about it
[1:32:58] why because you've overcome it
[1:33:00] you've walked it on top of it
[1:33:02] and you counted it as joy
[1:33:05] what it is restoring to the georgia and
[1:33:06] david when he's restored
[1:33:09] david changed his
[1:33:11] reading of the word he changed how he
[1:33:13] said what is it then you go to romans
[1:33:15] you find romans 8 says nay and all these
[1:33:17] things we are more than
[1:33:19] that loved us
[1:33:21] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:33:23] nor life nor angers nor principalities
[1:33:24] nor powers nor
[1:33:28] things present nor things to come nor
[1:33:30] heights nor death nor any other creature
[1:33:32] shall be able to separate us
[1:33:34] from the love of god which is christ
[1:33:37] jesus our lord
[1:33:39] look let's look at your life let's look
[1:33:40] at your own personal life for a minute
[1:33:42] and think everything the devil's brought
[1:33:45] you through he hasn't succeeded yet oh
[1:33:47] he caused me to fall but he didn't take
[1:33:49] me from god he caused you to make a
[1:33:52] mistake but he didn't take me from the
[1:33:54] love of god because he loves me forever
[1:33:57] he loves me
[1:33:59] nothing
[1:34:01] can separate us
[1:34:02] you know when we're in the deepest
[1:34:04] darkest moment as david was an example
[1:34:07] we need to look back to him and realize
[1:34:09] that he's not a father that just loves
[1:34:11] us when we do good
[1:34:12] but we have many parents here we love
[1:34:14] our kids no matter what they do
[1:34:17] they can make the biggest mistake in the
[1:34:19] world and mama and daddy still love them
[1:34:23] that's how my father is
[1:34:26] he looks down at the church and he says
[1:34:28] you're my brother
[1:34:29] it doesn't matter what you do i love you
[1:34:33] and there's something
[1:34:34] that's going to bring you back to this
[1:34:37] restoration of joy
[1:34:39] but is it in the message why brother
[1:34:41] says now 1961 he says now if you say
[1:34:44] lord i lost the joy of my salvation
[1:34:49] but one's given us a way out
[1:34:52] he says if i he said say unto the lord
[1:34:54] i've lost the joy of my salvation
[1:34:57] i want
[1:34:58] you
[1:35:00] lord
[1:35:02] i've lost the joy in my salvation
[1:35:04] and so the first thing we do is think
[1:35:06] well that's not me because i hadn't
[1:35:07] committed adultery i hadn't killed
[1:35:08] nobody i had none
[1:35:10] no
[1:35:12] it could be the smallest or smallest
[1:35:14] now if you say lord i've lost
[1:35:17] the joy of my salvation i want you i'm
[1:35:20] sorry i stayed away from prayer meeting
[1:35:22] wednesday night
[1:35:24] we'll find me right back there next
[1:35:26] wednesday night i'll be right back all
[1:35:28] right
[1:35:29] the believer says
[1:35:30] i'm confessing i'm wrong
[1:35:32] despite what he tried not to fight david
[1:35:34] trying to suppress it his joy did not
[1:35:36] return until he was honest
[1:35:38] with himself
[1:35:41] you put a smile on you can come to
[1:35:43] church
[1:35:44] but until you can get real with yourself
[1:35:47] you won't receive your joy back
[1:35:50] because only you and god knows
[1:35:53] the real you
[1:35:55] only you and god knows
[1:35:58] oh and down in the message why brother
[1:35:59] broom says now i've grieved that spirit
[1:36:01] somewhere he said if you've grieved that
[1:36:03] spirit somewhere then go right back and
[1:36:06] think in your mind what did i start
[1:36:08] doing
[1:36:10] neglecting church
[1:36:12] did i start fussing with another
[1:36:13] denomination
[1:36:15] i don't know what it is in message
[1:36:16] people they want to fight with everybody
[1:36:18] in the world
[1:36:19] this message wasn't given to be a
[1:36:21] discussion and and enough
[1:36:23] to be on public tv and have a debate
[1:36:25] over without this
[1:36:27] this message was given to those that
[1:36:28] believe
[1:36:30] can receive
[1:36:32] in their heart he says what is it he
[1:36:34] said i started the naked church did i
[1:36:35] start fussing with another nomination
[1:36:37] did i start picking on this one
[1:36:40] oh god help us
[1:36:42] hey so many great bigs then
[1:36:44] just a little thing
[1:36:46] did i start picking on this one doing
[1:36:48] this to my neighbor
[1:36:50] if you did that's what sapped it out
[1:36:54] say oh god say god i'm sorry
[1:36:57] i will go right back and make that thing
[1:36:59] right i will go right and do it and then
[1:37:02] the joy will come back to your salvation
[1:37:05] again
[1:37:06] the holy spirit just flew right up there
[1:37:08] on the rafter he's ready to fly right
[1:37:10] back down again anytime
[1:37:13] you win he says you want him to come
[1:37:15] back
[1:37:16] he does
[1:37:17] the leading
[1:37:19] that is our promise
[1:37:21] galatians 5 but the fruit of the spirit
[1:37:23] is love
[1:37:25] joy
[1:37:26] peace long suffering gentleness goodness
[1:37:29] faith meekness temperance against such
[1:37:30] there is no law
[1:37:33] the father of christ has crucified the
[1:37:35] flesh with the affections of the lust if
[1:37:37] we live in the spirit let us also walk
[1:37:40] in the spirit
[1:37:41] if joy is a promise to me
[1:37:44] i'm going to be happy
[1:37:46] y'all get accused too much of being too
[1:37:48] happy maybe we all should be accused too
[1:37:50] much of being too happy
[1:37:52] they tell me all the time with the word
[1:37:53] how are you so happy because i know my
[1:37:55] end point
[1:37:57] i ain't looking at the current
[1:37:58] circumstances i ain't looking at the
[1:37:59] battles that i'm in i know where i'm
[1:38:01] going
[1:38:02] do you know where you're going why i
[1:38:03] don't know what that means where you
[1:38:04] don't know where you're going then if
[1:38:06] you get a hold of the same god that i
[1:38:08] get out of and you know where you're
[1:38:10] going it changes the innermost being
[1:38:12] about you
[1:38:14] i can be happy living in 2022 as the
[1:38:17] world's fallen apart why because i don't
[1:38:19] get nervous when they say russia is
[1:38:21] attacking ukrainian going for the o i
[1:38:23] say praise the lord it's about time to
[1:38:26] go home
[1:38:28] it excites me to see the revelation and
[1:38:31] the prophecy of the scripture completely
[1:38:33] being fulfilled before my eyes
[1:38:36] oh you never say look i'm sorry i don't
[1:38:38] know why we got there i hope you wanted
[1:38:40] you ain't in this boat but i ain't never
[1:38:42] seen the
[1:38:44] lack of massive believers on facebook
[1:38:47] all worried about what's going on in
[1:38:48] russia
[1:38:50] have you not listened to the message
[1:38:53] he told us that in 63 they was coming
[1:38:55] for ukraine
[1:38:56] he told us that they was coming for the
[1:38:58] oil he also told us in the spirit sense
[1:39:01] that the denomination was coming for you
[1:39:03] all because you're the only ones got
[1:39:05] what it takes to get out of here
[1:39:08] that ought to make us happy if nothing
[1:39:10] else does
[1:39:14] what is it
[1:39:15] i like the scripture in exodus 22.
[1:39:20] that's exodus 22 talks about judgments
[1:39:22] and rights of property in the law but i
[1:39:24] like what this scripture says it says if
[1:39:26] the he said if the thief be certainly
[1:39:28] found in the hand of life whether it be
[1:39:30] an oxen ass or a sheep what did he say
[1:39:32] if the thief is caught that stole
[1:39:34] something from you
[1:39:37] our kentucky tennessee language right if
[1:39:40] somebody comes stowed from you and they
[1:39:42] prove that it was them
[1:39:43] what shall they do
[1:39:45] he shall restore
[1:39:47] devil
[1:39:49] so that enemy
[1:39:51] comes stowed that joy from you he's
[1:39:53] gonna have to give it back to you
[1:39:55] he's gonna have to give it back to your
[1:39:56] double
[1:39:57] he's gonna have to put up you more than
[1:39:59] he's ever put up with you because now
[1:40:01] you're gonna look at him in the face and
[1:40:02] say yeah devil you tried that once but i
[1:40:05] overcome
[1:40:06] so let me show you something now i'm
[1:40:07] going to fight a little harder i'm going
[1:40:09] to kick you a little stronger i want to
[1:40:11] stand a little longer why because you've
[1:40:13] already tried it and i've already been
[1:40:15] an overcomer
[1:40:17] i've already
[1:40:19] searched for you believe jesus in 1960
[1:40:22] he says now i he says believe that the
[1:40:24] scriptures whether it says i believe
[1:40:26] that the scriptures cannot tell anything
[1:40:27] that's wrong
[1:40:29] you believe that
[1:40:30] there's many things in the scripture
[1:40:32] that i only wish i was able with faith
[1:40:35] enough to make
[1:40:37] it make it real to the people
[1:40:40] that was that's your prophet speaking
[1:40:42] he said but i never stand in the way of
[1:40:45] anybody that could do it
[1:40:48] come on
[1:40:51] we got people around this world that
[1:40:52] claims they believe this message that
[1:40:54] tells you well if i can't do it you
[1:40:56] can't do it
[1:40:58] you ain't listening to the message are
[1:41:00] you
[1:41:00] brother brendon says if i couldn't do it
[1:41:02] i wouldn't stop somebody else's hood
[1:41:04] if i couldn't heal a person i wouldn't
[1:41:05] stop another preacher from doing it if i
[1:41:07] couldn't bring a
[1:41:09] soul to an altar i wouldn't stop
[1:41:10] somebody else from doing it it don't
[1:41:12] have to be me it's god working through
[1:41:14] me it's god working through a ministry
[1:41:18] to bring in the tradition
[1:41:20] well
[1:41:21] you go to my camp and we're going to
[1:41:23] have 150 000 people in the altar
[1:41:26] but are they going to stay
[1:41:28] i'd rather god get out of one
[1:41:31] and bring him to him
[1:41:33] and change his eternal destination
[1:41:36] then have all the weeping and crying
[1:41:39] because if there ain't something behind
[1:41:41] it
[1:41:42] it'll never last
[1:41:43] my brother brendan talked about billy
[1:41:46] graham so many times if we're not
[1:41:48] careful we repeat that
[1:41:49] i'll move on
[1:41:51] but i'd never stand in the way of
[1:41:52] anybody that could do it
[1:41:54] if i couldn't take a walk like enoch did
[1:41:56] one afternoon with the lord and just let
[1:41:58] go so overjoyed
[1:42:02] till i just walk up home with him
[1:42:06] so overjoyed i like that whether we're
[1:42:08] going to put that in there at the enoch
[1:42:09] enoch was just happy
[1:42:11] enoch was running down through there
[1:42:12] clicking the hills he was just happy in
[1:42:14] the lord
[1:42:15] the god that the god of this universe
[1:42:17] had done showed him he's fixed death
[1:42:20] ain't nobody in the history and ain't
[1:42:22] nobody ever done this but he knocked i'm
[1:42:24] fixing to bring you on up a little
[1:42:25] higher
[1:42:27] he just got beside himself he was so
[1:42:28] happy he didn't worry about what the
[1:42:30] naysayers were saying he didn't worry
[1:42:32] about what the tomato throwers were
[1:42:33] saying he didn't worry about what the
[1:42:35] internet was saying he didn't worry
[1:42:37] about what social media was saying he
[1:42:38] didn't worry about what his family was
[1:42:40] saying he just got over jordan got
[1:42:42] beside himself he got so caught up with
[1:42:44] god god said just slide on up buddy he
[1:42:47] just slid on up and brother brown was
[1:42:49] telling this right there he says if i
[1:42:50] couldn't do it i wouldn't stop him from
[1:42:52] doing it
[1:42:53] why because he knew there's coming a day
[1:42:56] that we're living in that there's a
[1:42:58] bride of christ that's going to have the
[1:43:00] restoration of that joy to what they're
[1:43:02] going to be so happy they're just going
[1:43:04] to get caught up with him one day
[1:43:07] and just walk right on out of here he
[1:43:09] knew it was coming
[1:43:10] and like afternoon he said to the lord
[1:43:12] just go over joy till i just walk up
[1:43:14] home with him
[1:43:15] i wouldn't stand in anybody's way that
[1:43:17] did not have as much faith they could
[1:43:19] just walk up home with him without dying
[1:43:21] or tasting death of this world he says
[1:43:24] and we're trying today he's so see he
[1:43:27] said the end time is approaching there
[1:43:29] should be an end time appearing of the
[1:43:31] lord jesus he predicted in the scripture
[1:43:34] because what he said
[1:43:36] must come to pass
[1:43:39] you know what
[1:43:40] i think we need to start getting happy
[1:43:42] yeah
[1:43:43] i think joy needs to start running our
[1:43:45] lives i don't think we need to let the
[1:43:47] devil fear us anymore place fear in our
[1:43:49] lives that we can't worship him then we
[1:43:51] can't think hey look we took the youth
[1:43:53] last year last fall we took them to
[1:43:54] dollywood everybody else is shouting and
[1:43:56] hollering for their ball team shipping
[1:43:58] and hauling for their sexual desires
[1:44:00] shouting and hauling for everything else
[1:44:02] and so i just started shouting giving
[1:44:03] god the glory not on the eagle going
[1:44:05] across the thing
[1:44:08] some of them looked at me and i said hey
[1:44:09] look y'all can be heavy watch your head
[1:44:10] i got a happy one i got
[1:44:13] one of these days they ain't going to
[1:44:14] take this eagle strap to hold me up i'm
[1:44:16] just going to leave right on out of here

[1:45:12] we got
[1:45:13] it wasn't a good smell come on
[1:45:19] but they had been told
[1:45:21] that there was a messiah coming
[1:45:23] and when that messiah was to come
[1:45:26] there would be a star
[1:45:28] that would hang over his birth
