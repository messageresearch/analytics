[20:14] the lamb.
[20:17] Oh, I have heard
[20:20] how Christians
[20:22] long
[20:24] ago
[20:26] were brought before
[20:30] a tyrant's
[20:32] throne. They were told that he would
[20:37] spare their life if they would renounce
[20:44] the name of Christ.
[20:48] But one by one
[20:51] they chose to die.
[20:55] The son of God they would not deny.
[21:02] Like a great
[21:04] angelic
[21:06] choir
[21:07] sings. I can almost hear
[21:12] their voicees
[21:14] ring. I pledge
[21:18] alence
[21:20] to the lamb. With all my strength,
[21:26] with all I am, I will seek to honor
[21:33] his command.
[21:37] I pledge
[21:38] alence
[21:40] to
[21:43] the lamb.
[21:46] Now the years have come and the years
[21:52] have gone,
[21:54] but the cause of Jesus,
[21:57] it still goes on. Now our time has come
[22:04] to count the cost,
[22:07] to reject this world,
[22:10] to embrace the cross.
[22:14] So one by one let us live our lives
[22:20] for the one who died
[22:24] to give us life till that trumpet sounds
[22:30] on that final day.
[22:34] Let us proudly stand
[22:37] and boldly
[22:39] say, I pledge
[22:42] alence
[22:44] to the lamb. With all my strength, with
[22:51] all I am, I will seek to wonder his
[22:59] command.
[23:01] I pledge
[23:03] alce
[23:05] to
[23:08] the lamb,
[23:11] to the lamb of God,
[23:14] who bore my pain,
[23:18] who took my place,
[23:21] who wore my shame. I will seek to honor
[23:28] his commands.
[23:31] I pledge alence
[23:35] to
[23:38] the lamb.
[23:40] [Applause]
[23:42] Amen. Let's stand this evening. Sing
[23:43] that again as brother Ber comes this
[23:45] evening deliver the word. Amen. Who came
[23:47] expecting this evening? Amen. Let's sing

[24:57] &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. Amen. Just glad
[25:02] everybody made it out. all those that
[25:04] did. Good to have brother Joshua and
[25:07] sister Leah back. Amen. Seems like a
[25:09] month that you were gone. Amen. So we
[25:11] sure missed them. Amen. But glad they
[25:13] had a good time. Amen. As brother Irvin
[25:16] and Sister Marta make it back yet.
[25:18] They're back at their good trip. So
[25:20] anyway, so praise the Lord. All right,
[25:23] let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, as we
[25:24] once again
[25:26] approach your throne of grace, Lord
[25:28] Jesus, desiring, Lord, that your Holy
[25:30] Spirit would just use us, Lord, to speak
[25:32] through us, Father, the words of life,
[25:34] that which you intend to speak this
[25:36] evening, Father. We just ask, God, that
[25:38] you'd have your way. You'd have the
[25:40] preeminence both in the speaker and in
[25:42] the ears of the hear. And may we go from
[25:44] here saying,"Lord, did not our hearts
[25:46] burn within burn within us as you spoke
[25:49] to us along the way. For we know that
[25:51] you are the same yesterday, today, and
[25:54] forever. And you still do everything
[25:55] that you ever did." So we ask, God, that
[25:58] you'll look upon our hearts, meet the
[26:00] needs of the people you sow, and you
[26:01] know what we have need of. And we just
[26:03] yield ourselves to you, Lord. Uh give
[26:06] ourselves away so that you can use us,
[26:08] Lord, tonight, Father. And we just ask
[26:10] your blessing upon the reading of the
[26:11] word, the meditation of our heart now in
[26:13] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. Amen. Want
[26:17] to cool with kind of a part two of our
[26:20] uh message Sunday. Just felt like it
[26:22] wasn't quite Amen. done with that. Amen.
[26:25] And so instead of taking y'all to 1:30,
[26:29] Amen. we'll just split it up. Is that
[26:31] okay? Amen. I had a dream. I think the
[26:33] first thing when I woke up this morning,
[26:36] Amen. I dreamt that it was a quarter
[26:38] after 9 tonight. Amen. Quarter after 9.
[26:40] And I was saying, I got to quit. I'm
[26:42] going to quit right here. So, I don't
[26:45] know if it means anything or not, but
[26:48] Amen. We don't We'll try not to hold you
[26:50] at the quarter after 9. Amen. But God is
[26:53] good, isn't he?
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many is glad to be a
[26:56] Christian?
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many enjoys the presence of
[27:00] the Holy Spirit in your heart?
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is really good. Amen. No
[27:05] better thing in the world. We're so
[27:06] grateful for his goodness. Amen. For his
[27:09] mercy. Amen. Turn your Bibles if you
[27:11] will. Um this evening we'll go to
[27:13] Zechariah once again. Zechariah. We'll
[27:17] just start there. Amen. And see how far
[27:19] the Lord will take us. Amen. same
[27:22] scriptures as we read before on the
[27:23] first part, but then I want to read u uh
[27:27] Luke's uh version of it rather than
[27:29] Matthew's because Matthew's version had
[27:33] uh a little phrase in it. I believe it
[27:36] was uh you know when he came into town
[27:40] and upon that donkey and all and all
[27:43] Jerusalem and all the city was ma moved
[27:46] saying who is this? It was quite
[27:49] something because I was back in my
[27:50] office
[27:52] and uh I I wanted to just grab a stack
[27:56] of books like or whatever and and maybe
[27:59] uh take a few titles or maybe speak on a
[28:02] few of those titles or whatever. And one
[28:04] of the first books that I came to was
[28:07] message called who is this? Amen. And so
[28:10] brother Brandon preached a message off
[28:11] of that one little phrase on who is
[28:13] this? Amen. And so I was just looking
[28:16] through that. But anyway, uh we trust
[28:19] that we're on the right path. Holy
[28:21] Spirit saying what he once said. Amen.
[28:25] Uh because that's what we certainly
[28:27] desire is for the leadership of the Holy
[28:30] Spirit. If it wasn't for that, we would
[28:32] be groping in darkness. Zechariah 9 and
[28:35] verse 9. Rejoice greatly,
[28:38] oh daughter of Zion. Shout, O daughter
[28:41] of Jerusalem. Behold, the king cometh
[28:43] unto thee. He is just and having
[28:45] salvation, lowly and riding upon an ass,
[28:49] and upon the colt, the fo of an ass.
[28:51] Amen. Now, over in the Gospel, Amen. The
[28:55] book of Luke.
[28:59] Amen. We want to pick up the story once
[29:01] again of where they came and were
[29:04] casting their garments down. Amen. And
[29:08] so forth.
[29:11] And this in this case the Pharisees
[29:14] wanted to rebuke the disciples and
[29:16] wanted them to be quiet. Amen.
[29:21] Luke 19. Luke 19.
[29:32] And when he was come nigh, even now at
[29:36] the descent of the Mount of Olives, the
[29:39] whole multitude of the disciples began
[29:41] to rejoice and praise God with a loud
[29:44] voice for the mighty works that had been
[29:47] seen,
[29:49] saying, "Blessed be the king that cometh
[29:51] in the name of the Lord, peace in
[29:53] heaven, and glory in the highest." And
[29:57] some of the Pharisees from among the
[29:59] multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke
[30:02] thy disciples.
[30:05] And he answered and said unto them, I
[30:07] tell you that if these should hold their
[30:09] peace, the stones would immediately cry
[30:13] out. Amen. May God add his blessings to
[30:15] the reading of the word. You can be
[30:17] seated.
[30:18] Amen. My title tonight's going to be Be
[30:21] It Unto Me. And we'll get to that
[30:24] scripture perhaps in a minute, but I
[30:26] want to cover this first for a minute or
[30:28] two. Amen.
[30:34] And uh I want to show you with the help
[30:37] of the Lord that there's in this in this
[30:42] group especially, there's always three
[30:43] kinds of believers, but in this group,
[30:45] there was two kinds. Amen.
[30:48] those that understood what was going on
[30:52] and those who did not know what was
[30:53] going on. Isn't that right? Uh and so a
[30:59] group of Pharisees, the Pharisees of
[31:01] course they did not understand what was
[31:03] happening and they actually spoke
[31:11] the exact wrong thing. Is that right?
[31:14] They said the wrong thing.
[31:17] Amen.
[31:19] Because Jesus answered them and said,
[31:21] "If if they're quiet, the rocks will
[31:24] immediately cry out because the
[31:26] scripture must be fulfilled."
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. It has to be fulfilled.
[31:32] Amen.
[31:33] I was thinking about today studying a
[31:35] little bit about
[31:38] the kind of power that the thought
[31:42] and the faith in the thought
[31:46] is of the scripture must be fulfilled.
[31:51] Many of you'll think about that
[31:54] all scripture must be fulfilled.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; All right, I'm going to detour here for
[32:02] just a minute.
[32:03] Amen. I'm going try to come back here
[32:06] because we realize that this year is a
[32:11] newspaper
[32:13] of tomorrow.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:18] If the newspaper told you if he was a
[32:23] sinner or and a gambling man and a
[32:25] newspaper and somehow you could travel
[32:29] into the future.
[32:31] Yeah. That's right. time travel. Going
[32:34] to do a little time traveling tonight.
[32:36] And you could go in the future and you
[32:38] could see which ball game, let's say,
[32:41] whether it's basketball or football, and
[32:44] you'd know who uh was going to win.
[32:49] It may be close, but you'd know who
[32:52] would win. And they allowed you to
[32:54] gamble however much money
[32:57] on that as you could. Ain't that right?
[33:01] You would try to you would put a billion
[33:03] dollars on it. Well, if you're a
[33:06] billionaire, you don't need to gamble.
[33:07] But anyway,
[33:11] you'd put a lot of money in it. You'd
[33:12] put all the money that you got and you'd
[33:14] bet all of it on it. Ain't that right?
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know what's going to happen.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So why in the world wouldn't we
[33:25] knowing what's going to happen bet our
[33:29] life? How many betting on I'm betting my
[33:31] life on it.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm betting my life that
[33:36] this is true.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm putting it all on it.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many that way? That's what
[33:46] we're here for. I I'm putting it all on
[33:49] it.
[33:51] My whole life. Everything. I'm putting
[33:53] everything into it. Some people want to
[33:56] mock mock the message of the hour, the
[33:58] prophet of God. I'm not ashamed to say I
[34:01] believe a prophet of God.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed to mention brother
[34:06] Bram's name preaching. Not at all.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Cuz if it was Paul, a prophet, you know,
[34:13] he come and he said, "If anybody come
[34:14] and preach anything other than what
[34:16] we've preached, let him if he's an angel
[34:17] from heaven, let him be a cursed." We
[34:19] would repeat, "Hey, Paul said, Paul
[34:21] said, and our prophet was vindicated."
[34:25] God come back and he proved him and he
[34:28] went back and he said what Paul said
[34:31] &gt;&gt; every aspect of it.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we're not ashamed because
[34:37] we know it's the truth and because we
[34:40] know that God said be said behold I'll
[34:42] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[34:44] great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Now back to my thought.
[34:50] Two kinds of people. Those who didn't
[34:53] realize what's going on
[34:55] in Matthew they said who is this they
[34:58] didn't even know who it was go back and
[35:00] listen to that message sometime brother
[35:02] brother Bam preaching every age it's
[35:04] been like that
[35:07] there's those that are part of the
[35:09] fulfillment of scripture brother Bam
[35:12] said that God has allotted a certain
[35:14] word for every age
[35:18] &gt;&gt; now let me tell you
[35:22] and show you because it is between life
[35:25] and death of whether or not you catch
[35:27] what God's doing.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he very much rebuked them. He
[35:35] says, "If you they hold their peace, the
[35:37] stones would immediately cry out."
[35:41] And when he was come near, he had beheld
[35:43] the city, and wept over it, saying, If
[35:47] thou hast known, even thou, at least in
[35:51] this thy day, the things which belong
[35:54] unto thy peace,
[35:57] but now are they hid from thy eyes.
[36:01] For the day shall come that thine enemy
[36:03] shall cast a trench about thee. And I I
[36:08] I I'm gonna I'm gonna presume that this
[36:11] is going to be where Titus in 70 AD
[36:14] besieged the city of Jerusalem. Isn't
[36:16] that right? Amen. Compass thee
[36:19] roundabout
[36:21] and keep thee on every side, and shall
[36:24] lay thee even with the ground, and thy
[36:28] children within thee.
[36:32] And they shall not leave in thee one
[36:35] stone upon another because thou kneest
[36:38] not the time of thy visitation.
[36:42] Amen.
[36:50] So that was the penalty. As you know
[36:54] when he besieged the city he blocked
[36:56] them, kept food from going in and out.
[36:57] They were eating the bark off of the
[36:58] trees. They were eating each other's
[37:00] children.
[37:01] Ain't that right? When he came and he
[37:03] wiped it out, killed every man, woman,
[37:05] and child, wiped it all out and laid it
[37:07] flat.
[37:09] Flattened it to the ground.
[37:12] He says, "Because you didn't know your
[37:15] day."
[37:17] How many knows that in our day, can you
[37:19] imagine the penalty for people missing
[37:21] it in this day?
[37:23] It wasn't three and a half years that
[37:25] God did the same miracles that he did
[37:27] when he walked on the shores of the
[37:28] Galilee, but 30, 40 years world over
[37:33] vindicated and proved it in such a way
[37:37] that there was no question about it.
[37:41] Amen. How many believes that God brought
[37:45] light to our generation?
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was light in the evening time.
[37:50] Some people might not know what that's
[37:52] all about, but we do.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:57] Praise the Lord.
[38:01] Okay. So, we think about that the
[38:04] penalty for not knowing it. So, I want
[38:06] to just say if you truly believe and
[38:11] know that God has called you and he's
[38:14] opened your eyes to what God is doing.
[38:18] Amen. not just opened your eyes to what
[38:20] God has done through the prophet, but is
[38:22] doing daily in your life, that you're a
[38:24] child of God, and that you're a part of
[38:27] those who recognize what God is doing.
[38:30] You ought to be a humble person. Amen.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; It's very humbling to think that God
[38:35] chose you.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; He opened your eyes.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; He give that desire in your heart.
[38:41] You're not one of those who are, "Oh,
[38:43] you're oh my." Can you imagine how
[38:46] horrible thing it is for people to say
[38:49] the words where you're just following a
[38:52] man or you're in some cult.
[38:56] You know where you put yourself? You put
[38:58] yourself on that other side who can't
[39:00] see the manifestation of God. You're
[39:03] seeing all those miracles that God did
[39:05] through that man. It's all to you just
[39:08] spit on it.
[39:12] That's right. To say, "Oh, you're just
[39:15] following a man or he's a false pro."
[39:16] Oh, boy. Hello. And those that walk away
[39:19] from the message and say, "He wasn't
[39:21] really a prophet."
[39:23] Don't think that you're going to walk
[39:24] away. Now, you're going to give account.
[39:27] It's just terrible. Hello.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:32] Praise the Lord. because they didn't
[39:34] recognize
[39:36] the manifestation
[39:38] of the word of God being fulfilled.
[39:42] And brother Bam said in every age, every
[39:44] age, the only real light that it was, it
[39:48] was never the next age, you know, you
[39:51] can't just look in the past light and go
[39:53] by the past light.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Who can live by yesterday's Sunday that
[39:57] went, you know, no, you can't can't live
[40:00] by Luther's age.
[40:02] Amen. It was pretty strong when brother
[40:04] Brandham went detailing this and so
[40:07] forth. He even talked about not Paul.
[40:10] Not Paul. Yeah, that's right. All the
[40:12] way. God has another age here. We
[40:14] believe what he did. But guess what?
[40:15] This is a new age.
[40:18] And the only true light there is he said
[40:20] I believe is in the rising of the sun is
[40:23] is the manifested word for the hour is
[40:26] the only real light there is. Everything
[40:29] else is a history. yesterday's light.
[40:32] You got to live in today's light in the
[40:35] scripture that is being fulfilled
[40:38] today.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'm afraid it just just comes to
[40:43] my mind. I ain't got it wrote down, but
[40:45] there's too many people living in
[40:47] brother Brandham's day. Oh, he's going
[40:50] to come back and he's going to do this
[40:51] and they're looking for something that's
[40:52] not not prophesied. That's not going to
[40:55] happen. Living in another age. Amen.
[40:59] instead of taking the message that he
[41:01] brought to us and becoming that message,
[41:06] becoming that word.
[41:13] Now, how many know the scripture has
[41:15] said that there's going to be a rapture?
[41:17] We which are alive and remain unto the
[41:19] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[41:21] them that are asleep. That's right.
[41:23] There's going to be a changing of our
[41:25] bodies. There's going to be people taken
[41:27] out of here. There's going to be people
[41:30] left.
[41:32] And you and I are here this Wednesday
[41:34] night to make preparations to be ready
[41:39] &gt;&gt; for when that happen. That is our goal
[41:42] to leave this world one of these days.
[41:44] And God is in the business of working on
[41:47] each and every one of us.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's going to take some
[41:56] shaking down. It's going to take God
[41:58] working on us because Amen. There's a
[42:00] lot of scriptures that has to be
[42:02] fulfilled. How many believe that? And
[42:05] that's what I want to go over with you
[42:06] with the help of the Lord tonight. Some
[42:08] of those scriptures that you and I are
[42:10] to fulfill.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[42:28] So, we'll go to
[42:30] Oh, let me see. Luke 1, I guess.
[42:35] Luke 1.
[42:44] And I'm going to not read a lot of
[42:47] scriptures here because I really just
[42:48] want to come to this one point.
[42:51] one point on this
[42:56] and that is in verse 38. Well, let's go
[42:58] back to 37. For with God nothing shall
[43:01] be impossible. Talking to Mary and
[43:03] telling her she's going to have a child
[43:05] and you know the Holy Ghost is going to
[43:07] come upon thee, overshadow thee and so
[43:09] forth. And uh that which is born of thee
[43:12] shall be that holy child. Amen. And so
[43:14] forth called the son of God. And Mary
[43:17] said, "Behold the handmade of the Lord.
[43:20] Be it unto me according to thy word."
[43:24] And the angel departed from her. Amen.
[43:30] Praise the Lord.
[43:39] Church age book 171 says it this way.
[43:44] Let me see. Let me go down and skip over
[43:46] this. See, the word of promise came to
[43:49] the Virgin Mary.
[43:52] But that word of promise was he himself
[43:54] to be made manifest. God was made
[43:57] manifest. He himself acted at that time
[44:00] and fulfilled his own word of promise in
[44:04] the virgin. It was the an angel that had
[44:08] brought her the message. Amen. But the
[44:11] angel's message was the word of God.
[44:14] Amen. Isaiah 9:6, he fulfilled at that
[44:17] time all that was written of him because
[44:19] she accepted his word to her.
[44:25] Amen. If I was to ask somebody, well,
[44:28] how do you translate that? What does
[44:30] that mean for today?
[44:33] Okay, let's read it again. He fulfilled
[44:35] at that time all that was written of him
[44:38] because she accepted
[44:41] his word to her.
[44:43] And that's what you and I are to do. How
[44:45] many believes that we he is going to f
[44:48] fulfill all that he has said about his
[44:51] word through you and me because we
[44:54] accept his word.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; The only way he'll fulfill all of it is
[44:58] when you and I accept that word.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? Well, amen. in the
[45:07] statue of a perfect man,
[45:09] whatever it might be. All these
[45:11] different messages that he preached, how
[45:13] many believe we are to become it?
[45:17] They talk about the Welsh revival. Hey,
[45:19] where's the Welsh rev? Hey, right here's
[45:21] the Welsh revival.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Well, what about the message of the
[45:26] hour? Where's the message of the hour?
[45:28] Well, there we got it back there in the
[45:29] library. That's all right. But guess
[45:32] what? It's got to be you. You are the
[45:34] message of the hour.
[45:36] If we don't look at these messages as it
[45:39] reflects out through us and we can see
[45:41] that identify ourselves in it, then
[45:43] we've missed the mark.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:49] Praise the Lord.
[45:51] So I want to with the help of the Lord
[45:55] look at some of those scriptures.
[45:58] Amen. Perhaps that we are to fulfill.
[46:03] Amen.
[46:04] I speak this I speak this
[46:08] in a spirit of humility to think that
[46:11] God would do it through you and through
[46:14] me.
[46:16] Just one more quick scripture. I think
[46:18] it was in
[46:21] 24th chapter of Luke, I think it was.
[46:25] Before we go on, I'm just going to take
[46:27] my time tonight. See the last chapter of
[46:30] St. Luke, he said unto them, "These are
[46:33] the words which I spoke unto you while I
[46:35] was yet with you, that all things must
[46:38] be fulfilled, which are written in the
[46:41] law of Moses and in the prophets and in
[46:44] the Psalms concerning me." Amen. So, how
[46:48] many know he had the scripture?
[46:49] Everything had to be fulfilled.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. When he was up there on the cross,
[46:58] we understand 72,000 angels were
[47:01] standing around with swords drawn just
[47:04] waiting for the word. Can you imagine if
[47:07] he'd have just spoken the word?
[47:10] But what kept him from speaking that
[47:12] word? He didn't didn't he didn't no he
[47:16] didn't I I'll say this. He didn't
[47:18] hesitate. No, he went and says, "No, my
[47:22] father's will. That's what I came to
[47:23] do."
[47:25] because that he loved you and me. How
[47:27] many believe it was love that kept him
[47:29] from destroying the world and saying,
[47:31] "Yeah, go ahead and get me off of here."
[47:33] He could have said, "Get me off of here
[47:35] anytime."
[47:37] But no,
[47:39] smile. Because he was thinking about
[47:41] you.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; He was thinking about me.
[47:45] I was on his mind when he was on the
[47:48] cross.
[47:49] You was on his mind. He's seen us way
[47:53] down here. When I think about the
[47:56] scripture, every scripture, brother
[47:58] John, when I think about every scripture
[48:02] will be fulfilled and I've got that kind
[48:06] of confidence in it and I know that I'm
[48:08] part of the scripture already that's
[48:10] been fulfilled.
[48:12] Amen. the fulfilling. I'm a part of the
[48:14] fulfilling of Acts 2:38, repenting of my
[48:17] sins, getting baptized in the name of
[48:19] Jesus Christ, buried with him by
[48:22] baptism, raised in newness of life,
[48:25] being led, filled by the Holy Ghost.
[48:27] Like Paul said in Romans there, if any
[48:30] man have not the spirit of God, he's
[48:31] none of his. But we're led by the spirit
[48:33] of God.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a spirit on the inside of
[48:37] us that tells us that we are the sons of
[48:39] God.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you look at everything
[48:43] that God has brought you through. You
[48:46] thought about every trial and everything
[48:48] that you perhaps wouldn't have never had
[48:49] the strength, but God took you through
[48:51] anyway. And if he has brought you so
[48:54] far, you ain't got to worry in the
[48:56] world. I I like not having to worry in
[48:59] the world. I like having a mind that has
[49:02] a peace of mind.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; I like to have joy unspeakable and full
[49:07] of glory. I like the peace that passes
[49:09] understanding down in my heart. Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I don't mind saying
[49:16] that's why I'm happy because my sins are
[49:18] gone.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; They're underneath the blood.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:29] My my my praise the Lord.
[49:35] Amen.
[49:37] First one.
[49:40] First one
[49:43] and we've heard it before, but this time
[49:45] I get to say it.
[49:49] That all right. I always like to wait
[49:51] until the Lord inspires me to say
[49:53] something before I say it. Amen.
[49:57] Joe Robert, not Joe Roberts, bro. Joe
[49:59] Adams, I think he touched on this last
[50:01] time and I've heard other PE ministers
[50:03] touching on it. Amen.
[50:08] is Malachi 4
[50:11] and five.
[50:13] Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[50:16] prophet before the coming of the great
[50:18] and dreadful day of the Lord.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; How many you use do we got?
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. But hey, if you
[50:26] don't accept him, he wasn't sent to you.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Only those who accept him.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:34] That's right.
[50:39] Grateful bread for the and he shall turn
[50:41] the hearts of the fathers to the
[50:44] children.
[50:49] Think about it. Wasn't John the Baptist
[50:52] Elijah?
[50:54] Yeah.
[50:56] So, we got an Elijah doing two works.
[51:02] Oh my. You look at that. I wish I had my
[51:05] little pointer. I got to get my AAA
[51:08] batteries in my pointer.
[51:11] And he shall turn the hearts of the
[51:13] fathers to the children.
[51:17] Period.
[51:19] 2,000 years go by in this verse.
[51:25] Is that right?
[51:28] and the heart of the children which is
[51:31] us. The fathers was the Israelites.
[51:34] They were the fathers supposed to come
[51:36] to the children.
[51:38] And now we're come to a place where
[51:41] Amen. the children's hearts have to be
[51:44] turned back to the fathers.
[51:49] Amen. They just say, "Well, God's done
[51:51] it. He did it." That's right. I'm a part
[51:55] of the fulfillment of this scripture.
[51:59] That's why he sent Elijah. That's why
[52:01] the prophet came to make you and to
[52:03] bring your heart, to bring your faith,
[52:06] to bring your life, to bring everything
[52:07] about you back the way they were back on
[52:11] the day of Pentecost,
[52:15] &gt;&gt; completely restored,
[52:17] back to the fullness of the word. How
[52:19] many It's a restoration message. If
[52:22] there's a prophecy that all that the
[52:24] cank and worm is eating, all the
[52:26] caterpillar and all the locust, but he
[52:28] said, "I will restore," says the Lord.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The voice that you're hearing
[52:34] tonight, it is a part of the restored
[52:38] person back to the word.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, let me hear you. How many have
[52:44] we got restored tonight?
[52:51] Hallelujah.
[52:53] Amen. That's some day going by. What's
[52:55] going on? What's the matter with them
[52:57] people? I'll tell you what's the matter
[52:59] with me. I've been restored.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; That's why we believe in there's one
[53:07] Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God
[53:10] and Father who is above all and in you
[53:12] all and all through you all.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Like Paul said, there by one spirit are
[53:17] we all baptized into one body.
[53:22] restored back to what the Paul said, the
[53:25] way that Paul taught it.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:32] That's right. I like that. Don't you?
[53:35] And the heart of the children back to
[53:38] the fathers, least I come and smite the
[53:40] earth with a curse. Boy, it looks like a
[53:43] curse out there to me.
[53:46] have gone completely stark raving mad.
[53:50] That's right. Y'all are insane out
[53:53] there.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; You have lost your mind. The whole world
[53:58] has become a mental institution
[54:05] &gt;&gt; because the prophet said the world would
[54:07] go completely insane.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; And they're there.
[54:15] Brother Sean, aren't you glad to have
[54:16] your right mind?
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Sister Patty, Brother Glenn, Sherry,
[54:21] Tommy,
[54:23] I like having my right mind. It feels
[54:26] good.
[54:31] You can have all the ethanol, whatever
[54:34] stuff that you want to eat. I eat my
[54:36] Amen. my crushed lily of the valley. The
[54:40] opium that comes from the lily of the
[54:42] valley. This is where I feel good.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; In the presence of the Lord,
[54:49] &gt;&gt; in his presence,
[54:51] knowing who I am. Knowing my gender.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; I don't just know my gender. I know my
[55:00] genetics. I know my daddy. I know his
[55:03] daddy, but I know where I come from.
[55:06] Great great great great granddaddy. I
[55:08] know where I come from.
[55:12] Amen.
[55:17] Annabelle, I shouldn't ask you maybe,
[55:19] but what is your genetics from?
[55:24] Huh?
[55:28] What?
[55:30] God, I'll answer it for you. God is our
[55:33] genetics. Our genetics come from God.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. A little hard
[55:39] question. It's all right.
[55:41] That's right. That's where our genes,
[55:43] Brother Abraham says, if you ever was a
[55:45] part of God, you was a gene with God
[55:48] before the foundation of the world.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; No wonder we act like we do. We act like
[55:55] our heavenly father the way that he
[55:56] would act.
[56:00] Why are we not scared to preach against
[56:02] homosexuality and all the corruption
[56:04] that is in the world and Sodom and those
[56:06] that reject God and tell them where
[56:09] they're going?
[56:11] Hello.
[56:13] Why? Because we're not afraid. A eagle
[56:15] is not afraid.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was back there and I, you know,
[56:21] deacon, everybody told me, "Lock that
[56:22] door, brother Brad. I got to lock that
[56:25] door. We don't want nobody coming in
[56:28] back there." here while we're having
[56:29] service.
[56:30] Ain't that terrible? That's just
[56:33] terrible to think that you got to lock
[56:34] your doors
[56:36] cuz guess what happened the other
[56:38] weekend? Guy come into a church, shot
[56:40] him up, and burnt the place down.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, Dad was somewhere off, but
[56:45] it's gotten That's the age we're living
[56:46] in, folks.
[56:50] That's why we need to have a guard back
[56:52] there.
[56:54] Somebody willing to take a bullet.
[56:57] Hello.
[57:00] Our deacons.
[57:02] Isn't that right? No, wait a minute.
[57:04] Here. The first line. We ought to give
[57:07] our deacons a hand. Say thank you.
[57:13] That's right.
[57:17] All right. Well, I got to come back
[57:19] where I was. Amen. So, think about
[57:22] that's one
[57:24] that's one scripture. We got a long way
[57:27] to go. It may be
[57:29] time's going slow. It's only 10 to late.
[57:31] I ain't got nothing to worry about. All
[57:33] right, here we go.
[57:35] Praise the Lord.
[57:40] But what did Eve have to do? Not not
[57:42] Eve, but Mary.
[57:45] But Abraham said there was three three
[57:47] E. Isn't that right? Three E. The first
[57:51] Eve went out and commit. Oh boy. Brother
[57:55] Brandon was hard on the God of this evil
[57:57] age. I think it's just that he called
[57:58] her that prostitute Eve all the time.
[58:01] That prostitute Eve.
[58:03] That harlot prostitute Eve
[58:07] had to go cheat on her husband. Isn't
[58:09] that right? That's right. Just really he
[58:12] was hard on her.
[58:15] He went out there and let Adam astray.
[58:18] Let him into death.
[58:20] Ain't that right? Unfaithful to her
[58:22] husband. And then he the second Eve come
[58:25] along. What did brother Bam say? The
[58:27] second Eve come along. Jesus Christ died
[58:29] on Calvary. Had him a bride.
[58:33] What did he say about her? That she did
[58:36] committed spiritual fornications on him.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; That's what she he said. She committed
[58:44] spiritual fornication. She'll take a
[58:46] man's word, man's greed above his.
[58:51] I truly believe that happened in the
[58:52] 50s60s right there when they rejected
[58:54] Jesus Christ.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; They took man's ideas and they promoted
[58:58] the devil to where he wanted to be. They
[59:01] the devil got him over there. Amen. But
[59:04] how many believe there's the third one?
[59:07] This Eve is predestinated to be faithful
[59:10] to believe every word.
[59:13] She and him become one. She said the
[59:16] word and the bride, Amen, they're going
[59:18] to be the same thing.
[59:22] Amen.
[59:25] All right,
[59:28] Michael got a question for you. Front
[59:32] row, stay up on the front row. We won't
[59:34] be too hard on you. We like love you up
[59:36] here.
[59:38] In a wedding, what is it? They'll read
[59:42] everything on everything. What is the
[59:44] couple words that they've got to say?
[59:50] There you go. You nailed it. Give him a
[59:52] big old blue ribbon.
[59:57] That's right. In a wedding, the one
[59:59] thing they got to do is say, "I do."
[1:00:04] Do you promise the love to hold the
[1:00:06] cherish and sickness and health and rich
[1:00:08] poor until death does you part? Woo! Oh,
[1:00:11] it's harder to do than it is just to say
[1:00:14] I do too.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? But they got to say I
[1:00:19] do
[1:00:21] and then they become one. How many
[1:00:23] believe that's the way it is with you
[1:00:25] and I? We've got to say Lord be it unto
[1:00:29] me according to your word. I receive it.
[1:00:32] I do. I accept it.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] And then you become one with him.
[1:00:43] Amen.
[1:00:44] But you got to say, "I do."
[1:00:50] Amen.
[1:00:55] I didn't
[1:00:58] mark. So I got to go find it.
[1:01:07] Revelations 18
[1:01:10] and 4 says
[1:01:14] after let me here I go just hustling
[1:01:18] hustling through it.
[1:01:21] Didn't brother Brandham say that the
[1:01:22] churches out there have become the cage
[1:01:25] of every hateful and unclean bird.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Here's another scripture being
[1:01:30] fulfilled. After these things, I saw
[1:01:32] another angel come down from heaven
[1:01:34] having great power, and the earth was
[1:01:37] lightened with his glory. Brother
[1:01:38] Abraham talked about the angel, and look
[1:01:40] what it did. How many believes it
[1:01:41] lightened the earth? It was truly
[1:01:44] evening light coming back. Darkness
[1:01:47] scattering.
[1:01:49] It shall be light in the evening time.
[1:01:52] That's another scripture that you and I
[1:01:54] are a part of. How many believe that?
[1:01:55] How many glad to be a light? A part of
[1:01:57] the light. In the evening time it shall
[1:02:01] be light.
[1:02:02] There is another scripture though.
[1:02:07] Rise and shine. I think Isaiah maybe 65
[1:02:11] 63. Rise and shine for the light is come
[1:02:14] and so forth because there shall be
[1:02:16] darkness over the land and gross
[1:02:19] darkness upon the people. How many
[1:02:21] believe we're also living in the darkest
[1:02:23] hour ever?
[1:02:26] But we were living in the greatest light
[1:02:29] since the time that Jesus was here.
[1:02:32] It shall be light in the evening time.
[1:02:36] My how how
[1:02:40] even brother Brandham said it. He said,
[1:02:42] "Man, people have lived in superstition
[1:02:44] and and and fog and question and
[1:02:49] denominations and ideas and all this
[1:02:52] stuff." And when come brother Brandham
[1:02:55] comes along, he says all your man-made
[1:02:56] creeds and dogmas is of the devil. Ain't
[1:02:59] that right? If Jesus Christ, you know,
[1:03:02] and he preached the word of God back to
[1:03:04] Paul's way he said it and so forth, all
[1:03:06] of your uh joining the church and put
[1:03:09] your name on the book, it ain't
[1:03:10] scriptural.
[1:03:12] All these other things that was wrong
[1:03:14] and then the angel of the Lord could
[1:03:15] come down and vindicate what he said.
[1:03:18] Ain't that right?
[1:03:20] Scattered the darkness. Can you imagine
[1:03:22] when the a blind man eyes were opened
[1:03:25] after he challenged Buddha, Hindu, all
[1:03:28] of your religion, any of your prophets,
[1:03:30] if your God, if your God can come up
[1:03:33] here, a prophet can come up here in this
[1:03:35] blind hole to open his blind man's eyes,
[1:03:38] I will follow your religion.
[1:03:42] What a challenge.
[1:03:45] How many knows it's the exact same
[1:03:47] challenge that Elijah made on uh that
[1:03:49] that mount with with Jezebel and all the
[1:03:51] false prophets said, "Let your God come
[1:03:54] and let who's God is God answer by
[1:03:56] fire." Man, they danced and shouted and
[1:03:59] cut themselves and everything. And he
[1:04:01] made fun of him. Hey, maybe he's asleep.
[1:04:04] Maybe he's taking a vacation.
[1:04:07] You know,
[1:04:11] can you imagine brother Brandham being
[1:04:13] up there and he says he'd have never
[1:04:14] done it if he wouldn't have seen the
[1:04:15] vision.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; But he was like, "Well,
[1:04:21] well, anybody going to come?"
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; But if my Lord, I love the way he put
[1:04:28] it. He never went like a lot of
[1:04:30] preachers would do. But if I can open
[1:04:32] his mind's eyes, you know, I'm the great
[1:04:35] man.
[1:04:38] No, he was humble. He says, "The Jesus
[1:04:41] Christ who I preach to you, that I say
[1:04:43] died and rose again 2,000 years ago and
[1:04:47] said, "The works that I do shall you do
[1:04:49] also. And if you'll open his eyes, how
[1:04:51] many will receive him?" And that man's
[1:04:54] eyes came open and there was a roar like
[1:04:56] you have never seen. You talk about
[1:04:58] darkness scattering, great light come
[1:05:02] down on the earth.
[1:05:07] Great light.
[1:05:10] Amen. I'm so glad to be part of that
[1:05:12] evening light.
[1:05:14] Even our have our church signs evening
[1:05:16] light tabernacle.
[1:05:19] That's right. That's what we are part
[1:05:20] of.
[1:05:26] And the earth was lightened with his
[1:05:27] glory. And he cried with a loud voice
[1:05:29] with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the
[1:05:32] great is fallen, is fallen, has become
[1:05:34] the habitation of devils. And the hold
[1:05:37] of every foul spirit and the cage of
[1:05:40] every unclean and hateful bird. He
[1:05:43] talked about how they hate the truth.
[1:05:46] That right,
[1:05:48] my they hate truth. They're hateful.
[1:05:52] My for all nations have drunk of the
[1:05:54] wine of the wrath of her fornication.
[1:05:56] Kings have committed fornications with
[1:05:59] her. The earth merchants of the earth
[1:06:01] are waxed rich through the abundance of
[1:06:03] her delicacies.
[1:06:05] And I heard another voice from heaven's
[1:06:09] sake, "Come out." And remember when he
[1:06:12] said that, Bam screamed, "Come out of
[1:06:15] her, my people."
[1:06:17] How many glad to have been part of the
[1:06:20] come on out of there? I'm part of the
[1:06:23] coming out.
[1:06:25] I got out of there. You got out of
[1:06:27] there. Get out of there.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's the mark of the
[1:06:32] beast.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; That fornicating, she was the mother of
[1:06:36] harlots.
[1:06:39] Amen. And all of these become harlots
[1:06:42] and prostitutes.
[1:06:44] Amen.
[1:06:48] I might as well bring this in while I'm
[1:06:49] at it. But who are you? Who are you
[1:06:53] tonight? Are you part of that
[1:06:54] prostitute?
[1:06:56] Brother Abraham says, "Invisible union
[1:06:59] of the heavenly bridegroom, the earthly
[1:07:01] bride, the first husband that you
[1:07:02] married to the world, the anointed
[1:07:04] bridegroom, which for ordained you, he
[1:07:06] has washed you by the washing of the
[1:07:09] water by the church." No, he says that
[1:07:12] don't sound right. You might find that
[1:07:14] in the almanac, but not in God's Bible.
[1:07:16] But by the washing of the water, by the
[1:07:19] word. How many knows the word is so
[1:07:22] important?
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Every thought you let go through your
[1:07:25] mind is important.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; The things that preachers come up here
[1:07:29] and preach is important.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; It takes us a certain direction. It's
[1:07:35] sets your mind a certain way.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; So important that us preachers preach
[1:07:41] under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:43] and say what God once said.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:48] All right. washing of the water by the
[1:07:50] word. You are standing completely
[1:07:53] justified as though you never did it at
[1:07:56] the beginning.
[1:07:57] This is my message to the church. Now,
[1:08:00] how many know as he was talking to the
[1:08:01] bride? Amen. As you go off the air, just
[1:08:04] a minute. You're standing. If you're
[1:08:06] standing on God's word and with God's
[1:08:08] word, every amen, every jot, every
[1:08:11] kettle. Woo! How many is with me? Where
[1:08:15] are you standing? I'm trying to tell
[1:08:16] you, pull away from them shucks and got
[1:08:18] to get out here where the he wheat is,
[1:08:21] where you can write before the sun. How
[1:08:23] many believe that's what we're doing
[1:08:24] tonight? Amen. Let the son of God, let
[1:08:26] the word of God shine over us and ripen
[1:08:29] you.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll give you a little bit of
[1:08:34] ripening sun in a minute. Amen.
[1:08:42] See if we're ripe or not. see if we're
[1:08:44] ready or not. Heard a noise, another
[1:08:47] voice from heaven saying, "Come out of
[1:08:48] her, my people, that you be not
[1:08:50] partakers of her sins, that you received
[1:08:53] not of her plagues." All right, back to
[1:08:55] the pull away. He says, "As though you
[1:08:58] never did in the first place." You talk
[1:08:59] about a thanksgiving.
[1:09:02] I feel
[1:09:04] real good. Amen. I'm not the only one
[1:09:07] that gets to feeling good up here. Amen.
[1:09:10] I'm more thankful for that than anything
[1:09:12] I know of.
[1:09:14] You are the pure, virtuous, sinless
[1:09:19] bride of the son of the living God.
[1:09:21] Every man and every woman that's born of
[1:09:23] the spirit, washed in the blood of Jesus
[1:09:25] Christ, and believes every word of God
[1:09:28] stands as though you never sin in the
[1:09:31] first place. You're perfect.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:41] Oh my. How many's glad of that?
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, the devil will try to say, "But
[1:09:47] you're not perfect." But just shut up,
[1:09:48] devil. He said I was perfect because I'm
[1:09:50] believing every word.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you don't make a mistake
[1:09:54] and this, that, and the other. But if
[1:09:56] you're believing the word, you're
[1:09:57] standing perfect. That's why he never
[1:09:58] did it in the first place.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:03] Now, how many believes that's what we
[1:10:05] got to be? We got to be that way when he
[1:10:07] comes. Amen.
[1:10:11] Amen.
[1:10:15] All right. Come out of.
[1:10:18] But you know, we can't just come out of.
[1:10:20] We got to go into also, don't we?
[1:10:23] Yeah. We got to go into What do we go
[1:10:27] into?
[1:10:29] Amen.
[1:10:40] This pulp is not big enough, brother
[1:10:42] Tommy. Yes, it is.
[1:10:45] I love it. Thank you again.
[1:10:49] So, next one. Let's just look at another
[1:10:51] one. Lord, let it be. Amen. If you don't
[1:10:53] feel that way, how many would say, "Let
[1:10:55] it be according to your word." Lord,
[1:10:56] that's let that be me. Let me be that
[1:10:59] virtuous, sinless, spotless bride of
[1:11:02] Jesus Christ standing as we don't never
[1:11:04] did it in the first place.
[1:11:10] Brother Bon makes a statement, don't he?
[1:11:12] He said, "I'm glad that a man can live
[1:11:15] so God, so close to God that the devil
[1:11:18] doesn't know what to do with him."
[1:11:21] Amen.
[1:11:30] Do we need to think on that a little
[1:11:34] brother Glenn?
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; You all right? Everybody all right.
[1:11:41] Oh boy. Right. Like, well, I don't know
[1:11:44] if I'm quite there yet, but
[1:11:48] I'm trying. Right. That's right. Because
[1:11:51] sometimes he kind of trips us up a
[1:11:53] little bit, you know. We got a little of
[1:11:55] oursel left.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Got a little of ourselves
[1:12:01] sometime. Amen. What about a completely
[1:12:06] surrendered person to Christ? He makes a
[1:12:09] statement as you I did a couple weeks
[1:12:10] ago. Amen. Is omnipotent,
[1:12:14] all powerful, one that's completely
[1:12:16] surrendered.
[1:12:19] Amen.
[1:12:20] Another
[1:12:22] place brother Brandham said with true
[1:12:25] revelation.
[1:12:27] Let me go back a little bit. A very
[1:12:30] familiar quote. Now I'm just bringing up
[1:12:32] some familiar quotes. Is that all right?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; We want to see whether we really believe
[1:12:38] this
[1:12:39] and would truly say in our heart, Lord,
[1:12:43] let it be unto me according to your
[1:12:47] word.
[1:12:49] See, the devil knows that if the people
[1:12:51] get a true revelation of the true
[1:12:53] church, what she is, what she stands
[1:12:56] for, and that she can do the greater
[1:12:59] works, she will be an invincible army.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:08] He says, "If they get a true revelation
[1:13:10] of the two spirits within the framework
[1:13:12] of the Christian church and by God's
[1:13:14] spirit discern and withstand the
[1:13:16] Antichrist spirit, Satan will be
[1:13:20] powerless before her." I like that
[1:13:22] phrase that the devil will be powerless
[1:13:26] before you.
[1:13:28] I thought of that when I wrote this
[1:13:29] down. And I said, "Lord, let that be.
[1:13:31] Lord, let it be." To me that the devil
[1:13:35] would be powerless
[1:13:38] in your life.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; That means jealousy,
[1:13:44] uh,
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; lust, sin, uh, temptation, uh, hatred,
[1:13:50] malice, all those things, you're above
[1:13:53] it.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because those are all things of
[1:13:58] the devil.
[1:14:00] bitterness, hatred, all of that. That's
[1:14:01] all of the devil
[1:14:04] to be have the t power the devil to be
[1:14:06] powerless.
[1:14:09] Because he's got to have somebody to
[1:14:11] work through.
[1:14:13] Amen.
[1:14:17] Now, we're going into some of the
[1:14:18] quotes. Is that okay? A few quotes
[1:14:20] tonight yet
[1:14:23] of let it be unto me according to his
[1:14:27] word.
[1:14:30] Satan will be powerless before her. He
[1:14:33] will be as definitely thwarted today as
[1:14:34] when Christ withtood his every effort to
[1:14:36] gain power over him in the desert. See,
[1:14:39] Satan hates revelation. We love it with
[1:14:42] true revelation in our lives. The gates
[1:14:44] of hell will not prevail against us, but
[1:14:49] we will prevail over them.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's glad to prevail over
[1:14:57] the devil?
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Be an overcomer.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's a big difference between an
[1:15:06] overcomer and somebody just says he's an
[1:15:08] overcomer.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; that's true.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Because if you're not really a
[1:15:16] overcomer, you still feel the agony of
[1:15:20] defeat in your heart.
[1:15:22] You still don't have that freedom.
[1:15:25] You ain't got that liberty. You don't
[1:15:28] have that joy.
[1:15:32] Hello.
[1:15:36] Amen. All right, I'm going to jump.
[1:15:38] We're going to do some jumping here
[1:15:41] because it comes to my mind. I might as
[1:15:42] well go after it. I believe we're part
[1:15:44] of this. I believe that we're part of
[1:15:46] Revelations 19.
[1:15:49] And I heard another voice, as it were
[1:15:52] the voice of a great multitude, the
[1:15:54] voice of many waters, and as the voice
[1:15:57] of mighty thundering, saying,
[1:15:59] "Hallelujah,
[1:16:00] for the Lord our God omnipotent reignth.
[1:16:04] Let us be glad
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; and rejoice,
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; rejoice, rejoice." And again I say,
[1:16:16] rejoice. Rejoice in the Lord always. And
[1:16:20] again I say rejoice. How many believe
[1:16:23] it's time to rejoice?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand we ought to be
[1:16:27] glad. We ought to be the happiest
[1:16:29] people. Let's be glad.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; It's time to be glad.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:16:36] For the marriage of the lamb is come and
[1:16:39] his wife has made herself ready.
[1:16:46] Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; How many believes that we The Bible said
[1:16:50] that as many as he predestinated,
[1:16:58] as many as he forneew, he also did
[1:17:03] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:17:06] image of his son. Amen. So, we're
[1:17:09] conforming
[1:17:12] into the image of his son. How many
[1:17:16] believes that's what we come to church
[1:17:18] for? Be it unto me, Lord. You're
[1:17:21] conforming and training me
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; to be like God, to be like Christ.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; I That goes for every man, woman, and
[1:17:31] child. The thing that God is interested
[1:17:33] in is forming his character
[1:17:37] in you so that you can fulfill this
[1:17:41] scripture of being ready. Because what
[1:17:44] is it that we take with us? Our
[1:17:46] character.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; What is more precious than gold that
[1:17:50] perishes? The trial of your faith. The
[1:17:53] things that come your way that you don't
[1:17:56] like.
[1:17:58] Amen.
[1:18:00] So, praise God. We got to fulfill
[1:18:02] everything. You say, "Well,
[1:18:05] and I don't know if I've even got it
[1:18:07] here." I don't think I do, but
[1:18:14] I think I've preached it enough of times
[1:18:16] you'll know what I'm talking about.
[1:18:20] Brother Brandham
[1:18:22] towards the end of the church age. He
[1:18:24] says that God desired a families of his
[1:18:26] own. Isn't that right? God desired a
[1:18:29] family of his own.
[1:18:32] And because he did, he takes and he
[1:18:36] sometimes break this these he's the he's
[1:18:38] the he's the potter. We're the clay. And
[1:18:41] sometimes he completely breaks us down
[1:18:43] in order to mold his character in you
[1:18:47] and I.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; So God is in the business of getting us
[1:18:52] and molding us into his image.
[1:18:55] Lord, be it unto me.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:59] I was thinking as I was studying this
[1:19:01] and I wrote it up here.
[1:19:05] I said, "Thank God for his rebuke."
[1:19:14] Not so long ago, the Lord rebuked me on
[1:19:17] something.
[1:19:18] He rebuked me on something.
[1:19:22] Oh, it's not always. No, the rebuke
[1:19:24] isn't always pleasant. But when you look
[1:19:27] back and realize that, hey, it's because
[1:19:29] he what? What does it mean if he be if
[1:19:32] he rebukes you?
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; He loves you.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the others, they just go
[1:19:39] right on. Doesn't bother them a bit.
[1:19:42] There's nothing in here for God to get a
[1:19:45] hold of.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; But you're one of his child and and you
[1:19:49] got the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:51] And when he rebukes you and it hurts,
[1:19:54] say, "Thank you, Jesus. I like that
[1:19:56] rebuke. I needed that rebuke.
[1:20:01] I needed that correction."
[1:20:06] Don't get mad at your child when they
[1:20:08] correct you, parents, when you're doing
[1:20:09] something you ought to do. Say, "Well,
[1:20:11] thank you. That's right. You're right."
[1:20:13] Huh? Don't slap him across the face.
[1:20:17] That's not Christlike.
[1:20:19] say you're right. Is that okay?
[1:20:24] All right, we got a few minutes left.
[1:20:28] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:33] How many believes that brother Brandon
[1:20:36] when he preached tonight the inner veil,
[1:20:38] we don't have it here, but he talked
[1:20:41] about the three courts.
[1:20:43] Is that right? Talked about the three
[1:20:45] courts. Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, and
[1:20:49] then going into the Holies of Holies,
[1:20:54] going all the way to a consecrated life
[1:20:57] with God.
[1:21:00] Amen.
[1:21:04] now
[1:21:09] because I truly believe that
[1:21:13] and if we're not if we as Evening Light
[1:21:15] Tabernacle if we're not getting closer
[1:21:18] and closer and closer to God then we're
[1:21:21] going the wrong way.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; We're not doing much good if we ain't
[1:21:25] getting closer to God. If we're not
[1:21:26] gaining ground.
[1:21:28] That's why we need every family, every
[1:21:30] husband, every wife. We need strong
[1:21:33] families.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; That's what makes a strong church.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; This church is only as strong as our
[1:21:39] relationships, our marital
[1:21:40] relationships.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:45] And I just I just I'm going to say it,
[1:21:47] Brother Brian. I thank God that we're
[1:21:49] not like we used to be.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have the immaturity that
[1:21:55] we do that we used to have. Now we all
[1:21:57] are at different levels. Hello. But
[1:22:00] still
[1:22:03] I thank God
[1:22:06] for the work he's done in my life.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where he's brought me from and
[1:22:12] where I am.
[1:22:14] Amen.
[1:22:16] Okay. Let me just read you. See if this
[1:22:19] is a test. I told you a while ago. We're
[1:22:20] going to see just where we're at. inside
[1:22:23] this place where they took this old rod
[1:22:25] and laid it there in the presence of
[1:22:26] God. God living in the glory over the
[1:22:29] cherubims. The rod had all happened. It
[1:22:31] all happened at once. And brother and
[1:22:33] sister to a life that's consecrated and
[1:22:36] lays before God. He says it'll change
[1:22:39] them as certain as I'm standing at this
[1:22:41] platform. How many believe that when you
[1:22:43] stay in the presence of God, it changes
[1:22:45] you? Amen.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; That's why prayer, that's why uh time
[1:22:51] with God is so important.
[1:22:55] I had kind of gotten away from in the
[1:22:57] morning. So, you know, we me and my wife
[1:22:59] will have our coffee on the kitchen. I
[1:23:01] mean, in the we'll have our coffee out
[1:23:03] on the porch sitting there together and
[1:23:05] eating and drinking our coffee and we'll
[1:23:07] reach over to each other each other's
[1:23:08] hand and we'll we'll have a prayer and
[1:23:10] commit the day to the Lord. you know, I
[1:23:12] kind of miss my own time of getting on
[1:23:14] the couch or going down there and just
[1:23:16] get on my knees and pray, you know, and
[1:23:19] of course uh you know, I' I've seen on
[1:23:22] YouTube and they've got this uh you may
[1:23:24] have too, but they're advertising that
[1:23:26] old men
[1:23:29] over 40, I guess, they shouldn't go to
[1:23:31] the gym and work out. He says, "But if
[1:23:32] you'll do this uh Taikey kind of, you
[1:23:36] know, whatever, you know, stuff." He
[1:23:40] said, "You know, will it really make a
[1:23:42] difference?" And he says, "I'll tell you
[1:23:43] what. In three days, you'll feel the
[1:23:45] difference.
[1:23:46] In a in a week, you'll really feel the
[1:23:49] difference. And in a month, I'm telling
[1:23:51] you, your your your whoever your son or
[1:23:54] your wife, they'll see a major
[1:23:56] difference."
[1:23:58] And I thought, "Boy, yeah, that's about
[1:24:00] right. If we would get down on our knees
[1:24:02] the way that we ought to and get that
[1:24:05] kind of exercise, those around us, you'd
[1:24:08] feel different. If you'd spend more time
[1:24:10] in prayer,
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; if you spend more time with God, you'd
[1:24:13] be different. Give it three days. Get
[1:24:15] more dedication in a month. My goodness,
[1:24:18] don't tell him what you'd be like.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; You'd be spiritually buffed.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; You come to the church of God say,
[1:24:26] "Preach it, brother." Amen.
[1:24:29] Let's sing another one. Glory.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; That's what we really need.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Get in the presence of God. We've
[1:24:40] been called the interval, the prophet of
[1:24:42] we going to walk with God like Enoch
[1:24:45] walked. Are you with me? How many
[1:24:47] believes that's not somebody else down
[1:24:49] the road? That's Daniel. That's Paul.
[1:24:52] That's Gideon. That's all of you. You
[1:24:54] walk with God, young person, like the
[1:24:57] three Hebrew children did. Amen. There's
[1:24:59] a fire out there
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; and you're only safe in the presence of
[1:25:04] Almighty God.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows you get away from
[1:25:10] that presence and see how quickly your
[1:25:12] flesh becomes dominant?
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. But stay tender before God
[1:25:17] and you'll keep your flesh in
[1:25:19] submission.
[1:25:22] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:24] All right. That's right. It'll change.
[1:25:27] you certain I'm standing on this
[1:25:29] platform. It'll take the fight out of
[1:25:31] you. It'll take the difference out of
[1:25:32] you. Get these isms away from you. It'll
[1:25:35] make you a real Christian if you'll get
[1:25:37] into his presence. Amen.
[1:25:44] Two more quotes. Some people eat just
[1:25:47] enough mana to make them good and hungry
[1:25:49] for some more. Before one revival to
[1:25:52] another one, you have to go out and get
[1:25:55] renewed again.
[1:25:57] Huh?
[1:26:00] Oh, brother, why don't you stop that
[1:26:02] nonsense and come into the Holies of
[1:26:03] Holies by the blood of Jesus Christ?
[1:26:06] Every bit of mana outside of here just
[1:26:09] lets you last till tomorrow, tonight or
[1:26:11] tomorrow.
[1:26:13] Hello.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; If it's just on your flesh, you might
[1:26:18] not make it out the doors or to the
[1:26:20] parking lot or home. But let me tell
[1:26:22] you, you need to go deeper than that.
[1:26:28] Hello. I mean, believes it. Next week,
[1:26:30] it won't work. It dries up overnight.
[1:26:32] But if you'll consecrate yourself to
[1:26:34] come into where the mana stays fresh day
[1:26:37] in and day out, year in and year out.
[1:26:42] Woo! Lord, be it. Somebody say it with
[1:26:44] me. Be it unto me.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me. Not for a 30 minutes, not
[1:26:51] for an hour. Not till tomorrow when
[1:26:53] something breaks down.
[1:26:56] No. Year in, year out.
[1:27:00] Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; You can meet a man that's walked in
[1:27:03] there. I don't care if he hasn't had a
[1:27:05] revival for six months.
[1:27:09] He's just as sweet as he was the day he
[1:27:12] was in a revival. That's right. You can
[1:27:15] meet him on a shouty day, a cloudy day,
[1:27:17] or whatever you want to. He's just the
[1:27:19] same. Lord, be it unto me. Because he's
[1:27:22] living in the glory of God. He's living
[1:27:24] where the man is fresh all the time.
[1:27:30] Where it isn't a burden to get out and
[1:27:32] pray through today and pray through
[1:27:35] tomorrow. Brother stay with him all the
[1:27:37] time in the holies of holies. Can a
[1:27:40] person live that way? Absolutely.
[1:27:53] I wonder how many of us is there.
[1:27:56] I'm there. That's me.
[1:28:01] I don't care if it's cloudy. I don't.
[1:28:09] That's what we need. No matter what you
[1:28:12] experience. If it's heartaches, if it's
[1:28:15] troubles, it's upsets, if it's this,
[1:28:18] that, or the other, you're still walking
[1:28:20] in the light of God.
[1:28:35] My Lord, be it unto me
[1:28:39] according to your word.
[1:28:45] I'm not quite there yet.
[1:28:49] Some of y'all might say, "I ain't even
[1:28:51] close, brother."
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; But how many wants to be there?
[1:29:00] Listen
[1:29:03] to this. You'll like this. This is my
[1:29:04] punchline tonight.
[1:29:09] This that or the other. You're still
[1:29:10] living in the light of God. Living in
[1:29:13] the chakina glory. Living there where
[1:29:15] Jesus is in his presence. That all
[1:29:18] things work together for the good that
[1:29:20] them that love God. And you love him.
[1:29:22] And you're walking in that mellow,
[1:29:24] sweet, soft, humble Christian life.
[1:29:29] Wouldn't you like to walk like that?
[1:29:32] There's not a person here but wants to
[1:29:35] live
[1:29:37] in there.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:44] That's right. Ain't a person here but
[1:29:47] wants to live in there. And friends,
[1:29:49] that's where you should live.
[1:29:54] Then brother Bannam goes to talking
[1:29:56] about himself. If you want to know the
[1:29:59] secret of life,
[1:30:01] if you want to know why the things and
[1:30:03] he and he and he stops.
[1:30:07] Amen. How many remembers it before when
[1:30:09] he was preaching on love? He says if you
[1:30:11] want to see the secret, he says of
[1:30:15] conquering bulls, the secret of
[1:30:17] conquering hornets, what was it? It was
[1:30:19] love. Right.
[1:30:22] He says, "But one day the grace of God,
[1:30:24] he took me in there." That's right.
[1:30:27] That's what he does. It's nothing in
[1:30:29] myself. You don't live for yourself no
[1:30:32] more. You live for others.
[1:30:37] Amen.
[1:30:44] I love this altar call.
[1:30:48] Brother Bam says, "Let us pray. Our
[1:30:49] heavenly father, as we see the day
[1:30:51] approaching, we see that life, the
[1:30:54] threads are brittle. We're walking on
[1:30:56] them. Many of us have done come up to
[1:30:58] the top of the hill to see the setting
[1:31:00] of the sun. Our eyebrows or our brow
[1:31:02] hose are frosting getting gray. Look
[1:31:05] over this audience tonight and see a
[1:31:07] many grayheaded carried brother and
[1:31:09] sister sitting here knowing it's just a
[1:31:11] few more days and we'll cross over. And
[1:31:14] there's young people sitting here. Amen.
[1:31:18] Lord, that we'll go before them. And
[1:31:21] then Lord, this little speck of life and
[1:31:23] this little speck of time will all be
[1:31:26] changed and it'll all be eternity then
[1:31:28] and we must stand in his presence to
[1:31:30] give an account of this life. Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; He says, "You give us these bodies.
[1:31:39] You've consecrated them or we have to
[1:31:40] you. And we pray that you'll take every
[1:31:43] person in here into that veil tonight.
[1:31:45] cross over away from differences, church
[1:31:48] entities, denominations, inferior
[1:31:51] things. Amen. May they come into your
[1:31:53] glorious presence and live in that
[1:31:55] divine light. Then he says, "And I
[1:31:57] wonder with our heads bowed if somebody
[1:31:59] would write walk right up to this altar,
[1:32:01] stand there in this sawdust with me
[1:32:03] tonight while the organs playing and
[1:32:05] just to get uh just to get the meeting
[1:32:08] started, say, "Brother Bannon, with
[1:32:09] God's help tonight, I'm consecrating
[1:32:11] myself. I'm going to pray right now that
[1:32:14] God will give me that hidden life with
[1:32:16] him. So I'll quit noticing the things of
[1:32:19] the world, noticing other people,
[1:32:21] another little difference that comes up
[1:32:22] in the church and I want to come to him
[1:32:25] where I can really live for him. Would
[1:32:27] you come here and stand at the altar? He
[1:32:29] says, "God bless you." And so forth. He
[1:32:31] said, "My the whole congregation, half
[1:32:33] of them, he will consecrate. Pray that
[1:32:35] he'll consecrate my life tonight to take
[1:32:38] me into that inner veil right now. I'm
[1:32:40] coming to ask him." Amen. Friend, if he
[1:32:43] hears my prayer to open the eyes of the
[1:32:46] blind, make the lame to walk and the
[1:32:48] dumb to talk. Then he goes into a kind
[1:32:50] of a different thought, but he said, if
[1:32:52] you'll believe that God answers my
[1:32:55] prayers for those things and the people
[1:32:57] that had come up to reconsecrate
[1:32:59] themselves, he says, you can believe
[1:33:01] that God will hear my prayer when I pray
[1:33:03] for you. Amen. How many will stand with
[1:33:05] me tonight? Let's pray together and just
[1:33:07] kind of reconsecrate ourselves and say,
[1:33:10] "Lord, let your word,
[1:33:13] Amen, be formed in the manger of my
[1:33:16] heart. Let it be, Lord Jesus." Amen.
[1:33:20] Raise your hands and surrender and say,
[1:33:21] "God, I just want to reconsecrate myself
[1:33:24] to you, Lord. We have our hands raised,
[1:33:27] Lord Jesus. And we truly believe that
[1:33:29] you're the same yesterday, today, and
[1:33:31] forever. We believe that you have been
[1:33:33] here inspiring me Lord to say what I
[1:33:35] said and Lord you've been with every
[1:33:37] heart every person in here father and
[1:33:40] you have Lord received somehow somehow
[1:33:42] they have taken this Lord and you see
[1:33:44] their hands now that is responding and
[1:33:46] say God that's where I want to live the
[1:33:49] scripture says that we can live there
[1:33:51] that's where we can live with the devil
[1:33:53] under our feet we don't have to be
[1:33:55] miserable we don't have to be under the
[1:33:58] devil can be powerless in front of us we
[1:34:01] has that he has no power over us and
[1:34:03] that's where we want to be Lord. be it
[1:34:05] unto us according to your word, Lord.
[1:34:08] And we reconsecrate ourselves, Lord,
[1:34:10] again tonight, Lord Jesus, asking God,
[1:34:12] that if anybody here, Lord, has
[1:34:14] committed sin or has gotten away from
[1:34:16] you or doesn't have the Holy Spirit, may
[1:34:18] they raise their hands in sincere
[1:34:20] consecration just now and say, "God, I
[1:34:23] want to reconsecrate myself to you,
[1:34:25] Lord. I want to serve you, Lord Jesus.
[1:34:27] And I want to walk every day with that
[1:34:30] sweet, humble, mellow spirit the prophet
[1:34:33] talked about, because that's your
[1:34:35] spirit. Not arrogant and proud and all
[1:34:38] these things, Lord, but humble because
[1:34:40] you've chosen us to mold us, to shape us
[1:34:43] into your image, Lord. And Father, we
[1:34:45] ask, God, if you send us trials, if you
[1:34:48] send us the things and hard things that
[1:34:50] come our way, Lord, it's to test us,
[1:34:52] Father. And even as a school, sometimes
[1:34:55] the kids might think, man, it's one test
[1:34:57] after another after another and after
[1:34:59] another. But oh boy, when that
[1:35:01] graduation day comes and we get their
[1:35:03] diploma and perhaps a superintendent
[1:35:06] comes out and says, "Here is your
[1:35:08] diploma. You have graduated. You have
[1:35:10] passed all the tests. You are ready for
[1:35:12] the world. You're ready to go." Amen.
[1:35:15] And and do what you're supposed to do.
[1:35:17] And Father, we're looking for that great
[1:35:19] day over there, Lord Jesus. Father, when
[1:35:21] the father that's tested us, tried us,
[1:35:23] God, Lord, and when we come to that
[1:35:25] gate, when we come to that door, Lord
[1:35:27] Jesus, may you say, Father, those words,
[1:35:29] well done, good and faithful servant.
[1:35:32] Enter thou into the joys of the Lord.
[1:35:35] Because when you was tested, when you
[1:35:36] was tried, you overcame, you was molded
[1:35:39] and you was shaped into my image.
[1:35:42] Father, I pray God that you'll bless
[1:35:44] every soul here tonight. Now, as we
[1:35:46] close, as we sing a few songs, go home,
[1:35:49] Lord Jesus. May we not go home and
[1:35:52] Father, forget what we've heard or to
[1:35:54] get out of your presence because of
[1:35:56] cares of life or trials or whatever it
[1:35:59] might be. May everybody in here, I pray,
[1:36:01] God, that you'll take each one of the
[1:36:03] sheep, God, that you've had me to
[1:36:05] oversee. That each one would have that
[1:36:07] walk with you. all of our young people,
[1:36:09] Lord Jesus, that they'll walk with you
[1:36:11] softly every day, and they'll know the
[1:36:13] peace of God that passes understanding
[1:36:15] that whether they're in school, wherever
[1:36:17] they are, whatever they're doing, each
[1:36:20] one of us, Lord Jesus, we can bask in
[1:36:22] that presence, it'll keep us calm. It'll
[1:36:25] keep us mellow. It'll keep us soft.
[1:36:28] It'll keep us gentle and meek, loving,
[1:36:31] and people will see the glow, the
[1:36:33] reflection of Christ out of our life. We
[1:36:36] thank you for tonight, God. Now in Jesus
[1:36:39] name and everybody said
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; amen. God bless you. Does anybody have
[1:36:43] need of prayer? If you want to have me
[1:36:45] special prayer or something sisters I
[1:36:48] mean you just play something softly.

[1:40:46] He didn't throw the clay away.
[1:40:52] Over
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:56] and over
[1:40:59] he molds me
[1:41:02] and makes me
[1:41:05] into
[1:41:07] his image.
[1:41:10] He fashions
[1:41:13] the clay,
[1:41:15] a vessel
[1:41:18] of honor
[1:41:21] I am today.

[1:41:56] the clay,
[1:41:59] a vessel
[1:42:02] of honor
[1:42:05] I am today.
[1:42:10] And it's all because Jesus

[1:42:17] the clay away.
[1:42:23] Amen. And did you enjoy the word this
[1:42:24] evening? Amen. Pray we take it to heart
[1:42:27] this evening. And let's just sing the
[1:42:29] first verse in the chorus of the manger
[1:42:30] of my heart before we go this evening.
[1:42:33] The manger of my heart.
[1:42:36] It was a tiny simple stable
[1:42:42] old beaten
[1:42:44] and warm
[1:42:46] a hardly
[1:42:48] a place
[1:42:50] for a king to be born.
[1:42:55] He didn't choose some place special
[1:42:59] to reveal his majesty.
[1:43:03] Though I know if I give him control,
[1:43:08] he'll be born in me.
[1:43:12] Let your word
[1:43:16] be born
[1:43:18] in the manger of my heart.
[1:43:23] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[1:43:30] Live inside this house of clay
[1:43:35] and mold it every day.
[1:43:40] And let your word be poured
[1:43:44] in the manger
[1:43:46] of my heart. Let's sing the second verse
[1:43:50] also.
[1:43:52] Well, outwardly
[1:43:54] I'm nothing.
[1:43:56] Not much to behold.
[1:44:01] Unlikely
[1:44:02] the place
[1:44:04] for his word to unfold.
[1:44:09] But if I'll just yield this vessel
[1:44:13] and let him have his way
[1:44:17] from glory onto glory,
[1:44:21] he'll change me day by day.
[1:44:26] Let your word be born
[1:44:31] in the manger of my heart.
[1:44:36] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[1:44:44] Live inside this house of clay
[1:44:48] and mold me every day.
[1:44:53] And let your word be born
[1:44:57] in the manger
[1:44:59] of my heart.
[1:45:03] Oh, let your word
[1:45:07] be born
[1:45:09] in the manger of my heart.
[1:45:14] Let it live in me. Let it star.
[1:45:21] Live inside this house of clay
[1:45:26] and mold it every day.
[1:45:31] Let your word be born
[1:45:34] in the manger
[1:45:37] of my heart. Amen. And God bless you as
[1:45:41] you go.
