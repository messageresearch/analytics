[44:44] donna in case you're wondering what the
[44:46] title is going to be it's the two
[44:48] kingdoms
[44:49] the two kingdoms god's kingdom and
[44:51] satan's kingdom
[44:52] amen
[44:54] that
[44:55] there's only two how many believe
[44:56] there's only two kingdoms
[44:58] amen and you're either one in part of
[45:00] the one or you're part of the other only
[45:02] two kingdoms two powers in the world
[45:05] that is covering us
[45:07] amen so let's bow our heads before we
[45:09] read his word
[45:11] we come before you lord jesus once again
[45:13] thank the lord jesus
[45:15] that father even though the really
[45:16] wonderful time that we got to spend with
[45:18] everybody lord jesus it's over with
[45:20] father we know that lord jesus we have
[45:23] you
[45:23] and father we still have the peace that
[45:25] joy and we never have to leave that
[45:27] because you said you would never leave
[45:28] us nor forsake us and we're so grateful
[45:31] lord jesus that we can go from here and
[45:33] say lord what will you have us to do

[45:39] by your spirit
[45:40] father we're so grateful lord jesus to

[45:44] dark world to know

[45:47] delighting the way lord jesus
[45:49] giving us a light father to know how to
[45:51] walk and where to walk
[45:53] lord we just want to take this little
[45:54] thought i feel you've laid upon my heart
[45:56] to speak on tonight speak to the people
[45:59] may you bless your word tonight anoint
[46:00] us lord to minister now in jesus
[46:02] christ's name
[46:04] amen and amen
[46:06] amen
[46:07] so i got to thinking of thinking about
[46:09] carnality
[46:11] and spirituality amen you can also call
[46:14] it natural naturality and spirituality
[46:18] everything that's natural
[46:20] everything that we see everything that's
[46:22] around us
[46:24] versus that which we cannot see
[46:26] amen
[46:28] and we know that everything that we
[46:30] can't see amen is spiritual that
[46:32] everything that we do see
[46:34] is only temporal and passes away and
[46:37] that right you can be seated well wait a
[46:39] minute i haven't read the scriptures yet
[46:41] see what i told you all right let's go
[46:44] to uh genesis i think we'll start back
[46:46] in genesis
[46:47] amen
[46:49] genesis the fourth chapter
[46:52] genesis 4.
[47:04] and of course this is the the scene
[47:07] opens up this evening
[47:09] after
[47:12] fall
[47:13] after
[47:15] cain had brought a
[47:18] offering to god and abel had brought an
[47:21] offering to god and abel's was accepted
[47:26] and came that's the cain and abel and
[47:29] keynes was not accepted amen
[47:32] and so
[47:34] he was driven of course from the
[47:36] presence of the lord in verse 16 of
[47:39] chapter four
[47:41] that god set a mark upon cain
[47:44] in verse 16 cain went out from the
[47:46] presence of god and dwelt in the land of
[47:48] nod
[47:50] and
[47:50] cain knew his wife and she conceived
[47:54] and bear enoch and he built a day city
[47:56] and called the name of the city after
[47:58] the name of his son
[48:00] enoch and then we go on down to verse
[48:03] 21
[48:04] because it's talked about a lot about
[48:06] the lineage and his brother's name was
[48:08] jubal and he was the father of all such
[48:11] as handled the harp
[48:13] and the organ
[48:15] and sila
[48:17] she also bear
[48:19] tubal kane an instructor of every
[48:22] artifice artificial
[48:25] in brass and iron
[48:28] the sister of tubal kane was
[48:30] haman
[48:32] amen
[48:33] and then verse 25
[48:35] it says and adam knew his wife again and
[48:38] she bear a son and called his name seth
[48:41] for god said she hath appointed me
[48:44] another seed instead of abel
[48:46] whom cain slew
[48:48] and to seth to him also there was born a
[48:52] son
[48:53] and he called his name enos then began
[48:56] men to call upon the name of the lord
[48:58] amen may god had his blessings to
[49:00] reading in words you can be seated
[49:03] amen
[49:04] we know that everything that began began
[49:07] in genesis amen
[49:10] and we know that cain according to i
[49:13] think it's
[49:14] first john 3 12 somewhere in there it
[49:18] talks about that not a murderer like
[49:21] cain who was of the wicked one right
[49:24] so we know that cain was of the wicked
[49:27] one so the lineage of satan's children
[49:31] of course is cain
[49:32] amen and so we see that that line
[49:35] descendants of cain coming up amen in
[49:38] the kingdom of satan actually beginning
[49:41] here amen and also it talks about how
[49:44] that the children of
[49:46] cain and how that they begin whenever
[49:49] they started out and their descendants
[49:52] how did they build cities you know right
[49:54] they built cities
[49:56] amen and uh
[49:59] also were inventors and instructors and
[50:01] inventors i think probably god said they
[50:04] were professionals they were
[50:06] scientific they were science people of
[50:08] science and so forth
[50:10] amen and we know that uh
[50:12] they mean science civilization so forth
[50:14] we all realize that those things come
[50:17] from the devil
[50:18] now we realize that
[50:20] uh
[50:21] we as human beings were always this is
[50:24] something that we always that's almost
[50:26] in every christian because as we talk
[50:28] about science as we talk about progress
[50:31] amen there's very few little very few
[50:34] times that i would say that that we
[50:35] would not desire to progress amen but
[50:38] remember the message of the devil is
[50:40] also progression it's about
[50:43] progress about going further about
[50:46] going deeper and more and more and more
[50:48] and more unfortunately i mean i think a
[50:51] lot of times we as christians have the
[50:53] same mentality
[50:54] and we're not actually satisfied with
[50:56] the perfection that god has given us
[50:59] already
[51:00] now how many knows faith is perfect you
[51:01] never have to add the faith
[51:04] you never had to have to say god's the
[51:06] way that god does something whenever you
[51:08] have something that's perfect it doesn't
[51:10] have to be improved upon it doesn't have
[51:14] to progress to something greater amen
[51:16] because it's perfect already i mean you
[51:19] take the three hebrew children take
[51:20] daniel take moses with faith conquering
[51:23] the whole nation take samson takes all
[51:25] of the fellows and for that faith that
[51:26] was perfect amen it is when they try to
[51:30] add to that or make it a little better
[51:32] so to speak it's where to get in trouble
[51:35] now how many knows that's exactly what
[51:37] eve did
[51:39] all right and the thing the very message
[51:42] to very
[51:43] tactic that the devil used to bring us
[51:46] into the condition that we're in
[51:48] he offered
[51:49] eve a little bit more knowledge
[51:53] right
[51:54] and so we know that knowledge amen
[51:56] that's what probably gets that's in the
[51:58] god of deceival age a message called the
[52:00] god of this evil age is a good one to
[52:01] listen to about all of that but listen
[52:03] and he began to preach to her you know
[52:05] if you know god knows that if you
[52:08] partake of this that you're gonna be
[52:11] wise
[52:12] right
[52:13] you're gonna know both good and evil in
[52:15] other words so it is one that it is a
[52:18] tree to make one wise in other words
[52:21] make it smarter
[52:23] amen
[52:27] and so he offered this to eve to begin
[52:29] his kingdom and you know when i begin to
[52:32] think about how that how that christians
[52:35] how how that the power that we rely upon
[52:38] i mean it's not our own power but it's
[52:40] god's power and how the devil and what
[52:42] he uses he doesn't really have any
[52:45] supernatural power
[52:48] now we know there's spirits of lust and
[52:50] different things and and difference of
[52:52] different kind of spirits out there
[52:54] that's that is evil and wicked but you
[52:56] know mostly the devil will use
[52:59] politics he'll take deceit
[53:02] he'll operate under lies
[53:05] isn't that right he greatly uses look at
[53:08] our politics i think our politics is a
[53:11] prime example of what the devil and how
[53:14] he operates to try to get his agenda
[53:16] over
[53:19] you know it gives us new meaning to the
[53:21] phrase lie like the devil
[53:24] right i mean they lie like the devil
[53:26] that's the truth they lie left and right
[53:29] amen and they try to do that you know to
[53:32] try to get over what they're trying to
[53:34] get over
[53:36] amen everything whether it's
[53:38] deceit and lies and manipulation and
[53:41] politics even finances
[53:45] right
[53:46] financial pressure you look at the
[53:47] financial pressure the different ones
[53:49] the boycott even our grocery is uh let's
[53:52] take uh perhaps chick-fil-a or whatever
[53:55] you know the boycott because they are
[53:57] religious or or this that you know and
[53:59] they'll all boycott it that's all that's
[54:01] how the devil has the word
[54:04] the devil works in his kingdom he works
[54:06] under uh you take a whether it's a home
[54:09] or a family or church amen and he
[54:11] doesn't amen he doesn't go to pray about
[54:13] things and when he tries to accomplish
[54:15] something he'll use gossip he'll use uh
[54:18] you know whisperings or sowing little
[54:21] seeds in people's minds get them against
[54:23] each other already he'll use those type
[54:25] of things
[54:27] but it's mostly under lies and that's
[54:29] what exactly what uh you know
[54:32] you know
[54:33] because we know that
[54:34] satan is a murderer he's a liar he's the
[54:36] father of the light of lies the father
[54:39] of murdered father the father of hatred
[54:42] and that's what he used to try to get
[54:45] where he wants to go
[54:47] so we see here that seth of course his
[54:49] lineage we realize that
[54:51] when he began to come it meant it was
[54:53] completely different even they began to
[54:55] call on the name of the lord
[54:58] amen now we're living in age brothers
[55:00] and sisters of course and this is some
[55:02] of the things when i began to think
[55:04] about it it picked up where brother luke
[55:05] talked about be less living in satan's
[55:08] eden
[55:09] how many knows that's what we're doing
[55:11] living in the height
[55:13] of satan's power all right and his eden
[55:17] amen and what he uses and so forth now i
[55:19] want to take and i want you to look at
[55:21] something plumb over in revelation
[55:24] plumb over revelations we're going to
[55:26] look at what's it actually comes down to
[55:29] what the devil uses and the things that
[55:31] the devil uses
[55:33] but uh let me just say this
[55:35] brother bam says no notice it's
[55:37] noteworthy to notice at the beginning
[55:39] seth and his children never went to the
[55:42] scientific way
[55:44] amen then he goes we're going to talk
[55:45] about science for a few minutes
[55:48] now
[55:49] seth's children never went by the
[55:51] scientific route they were humble
[55:54] herdsmen farmers and so forth but cain's
[55:56] children
[55:57] did what they were inspired by their
[56:00] daddy the devil inspired by daddy the
[56:02] devil
[56:03] amen and and listen he says watch the
[56:06] seed of god come down through every age
[56:08] and what there where it's heading up to
[56:10] today christians genuine christians are
[56:13] not at all
[56:15] about
[56:16] scientific research and stuff
[56:19] amen
[56:21] nah he says listen cain did after his
[56:23] nature the devil and worldly knowledge
[56:26] beauty science because if you remember
[56:29] say uh as
[56:31] cain made a beautiful altar brought
[56:33] beautiful fruits and beautiful flowers
[56:35] about all of that to god but that's not
[56:37] what god was looking for
[56:39] let me know that satan is the god of
[56:42] beauty
[56:44] satan is the god of fancy things
[56:48] amen jesus when he come he was born in
[56:51] on over a manure pile in a stable
[56:53] everything about him was humble it was
[56:56] simple
[56:57] it wasn't glamorous
[57:00] not scientific and so forth but all of
[57:03] that we realized from saint king's
[57:05] kingdom and all that amen we know that
[57:07] at one point for the man says science
[57:10] civilization and education all of that
[57:13] is of the devil
[57:15] if you don't think so look at what
[57:16] they're doing and teaching in our
[57:18] schools right now they know that by
[57:20] teaching these things it ain't half
[57:22] right the diamond theory it was never
[57:24] right it was absolutely of the devil
[57:27] they should have kept the spanking spoon
[57:29] in skirts and not in church but in
[57:31] school they should have kept the bible
[57:33] in school they should have had prayer in
[57:35] school but they didn't just kick that
[57:38] out did they no they kicked it out of
[57:40] our courthouse it's the ten commandments
[57:42] now what are they doing tearing down our
[57:43] monuments and everything else of our our
[57:46] great leaders they're gonna tear it all
[57:48] down right just goes to show satan don't
[57:51] like anything that has to do with god
[57:55] amen his kingdom is against god's
[57:57] kingdom and those two forces are at
[57:59] power today amen
[58:03] oh my so we think about it christians
[58:06] are not about scientific research when
[58:08] we think about science how many knows
[58:10] that we're living in a very an age where
[58:12] people have absolutely discovered things
[58:16] they have invented things
[58:18] right
[58:20] and just about
[58:21] everything that you can imagine is out
[58:24] there
[58:26] i mean i go into a hardware store you go
[58:28] over here to fairview perhaps or
[58:30] especially the fairview hardware that's
[58:32] a pretty great place now i mean they've
[58:34] got so much stuff
[58:37] huh
[58:38] every little gizmo how many knows
[58:40] there's a you know oh my sometimes i say
[58:43] look why didn't they just make one screw
[58:45] with one head and stay with it i'm you
[58:48] know
[58:50] i've got a whole bit box with all of the
[58:52] different bits and every time i go to do
[58:54] something i got to pick a different bit
[58:56] because it's made different style and so
[58:58] forth
[58:59] they've invented so many things until
[59:01] it's almost confusing how many my wife
[59:03] today said hey why don't you stop at the
[59:05] store
[59:06] and i said do you need anything from the
[59:08] store while i'm in town
[59:10] and she said yes i need some cornmeal
[59:12] well i says i'll probably get the wrong
[59:14] one
[59:17] so she said i'll send you a picture of
[59:19] what it looks like because you look at
[59:21] cornmeal or whatever there's so many
[59:23] different brands so many different kinds
[59:25] it's rising non-rising i don't know
[59:27] you're just all kinds of stuff
[59:30] we're living in an age i mean we're
[59:32] living in an age of just so much
[59:36] there's so
[59:37] many things
[59:40] they were in daniel i believe it was
[59:42] that it was prophesied that this
[59:43] antichrist and so forth that it would
[59:45] actually cause craft to prosper brother
[59:49] talked about how that how did he would
[59:51] cause craft to prosper the antichrist
[59:53] and so what and he said that craft to
[59:55] prosper means that manufacturing we're
[59:58] living in a the bible even talks about
[1:00:00] this manufacturing age
[1:00:04] amen there is
[1:00:06] there is so much
[1:00:09] so many different things
[1:00:12] and then over in revelations i want to
[1:00:13] read after a bit talks about how that
[1:00:15] the whole world satan's people
[1:00:18] amen they long and they love those
[1:00:20] things
[1:00:23] amen now i don't know about you but i've
[1:00:25] read this quote many times out of the
[1:00:26] church age book
[1:00:28] where a better man says this is the way
[1:00:30] he says but in this age of plenty and
[1:00:32] opportunity and everybody has so much
[1:00:35] and there is so much more to be had when
[1:00:38] with all the inventions to do our work
[1:00:40] and all these many things to give us
[1:00:43] pleasure
[1:00:44] now right when you think about all the
[1:00:46] inventions you think about our washers
[1:00:48] our dryers our microwave you think about
[1:00:50] our cars our vehicles our air
[1:00:52] conditioners
[1:00:55] well we have an issue if our air
[1:00:56] conditioner goes on we do not want to
[1:00:59] put a fan in the window and have to do
[1:01:01] that
[1:01:03] are you with me tonight
[1:01:05] we want that air you know we want the
[1:01:07] heat or we want air and so forth and
[1:01:09] this is that myth that even all of these
[1:01:11] things that give us pleasure
[1:01:14] ah and remember in the layout of the
[1:01:16] asia in second timothy three it says
[1:01:18] that people will actually become lovers
[1:01:20] of pleasure more than lovers of god
[1:01:25] so many things that give us pleasure so
[1:01:27] many things to make it nice yet
[1:01:30] the things that whenever you have it
[1:01:32] soft whenever you have it nice all your
[1:01:34] life you're bound not to have a whole
[1:01:36] other character
[1:01:39] your parents might spoil you up till
[1:01:41] you're 18 20 years old but when you get
[1:01:43] married you find out that life ain't so
[1:01:45] pretty after all
[1:01:48] when you got to fix that flat you got to
[1:01:50] pay that insurance bill you got to pay
[1:01:52] this bill you got that bill and you got
[1:01:53] to get up every morning and you got to
[1:01:55] be there and life becomes a little more
[1:01:57] of a grind
[1:02:00] amen and on top of that if you have
[1:02:02] friends and while they backstab you and
[1:02:04] talk bad about you this goes bad and
[1:02:06] that goes bad amen you gotta learn to
[1:02:08] deal with all of that
[1:02:11] amen and a lot of times those good
[1:02:13] things all of the easiness in our life
[1:02:16] it isn't what gives us character but it
[1:02:18] just brings a lot of time
[1:02:20] that gives us carrot and molds of
[1:02:22] character
[1:02:24] we look at the scientific age that we're
[1:02:26] living in science progress
[1:02:28] we're living
[1:02:30] let me see this we're living in the peak
[1:02:33] of science and progress
[1:02:35] amen
[1:02:37] and now look out back a hundred years
[1:02:40] ago
[1:02:40] 150 years ago look back at our civil war
[1:02:43] when we're driving horse and buggy look
[1:02:46] at the character people had
[1:02:49] i forget just who it was but i remember
[1:02:52] after the war the civil war was over and
[1:02:54] when one person found out that their
[1:02:56] friend from the other side had died
[1:02:59] amen and and
[1:03:01] and so he went was gonna go to the
[1:03:03] funeral
[1:03:04] and it was raining and everything and
[1:03:06] for some reason they told him don't go
[1:03:07] people have pneumonia people it's it's
[1:03:09] going around and so forth he says he
[1:03:11] didn't care he went anyway it got
[1:03:13] pneumonia died
[1:03:14] himself why because he had that type of
[1:03:17] respect for one another people that
[1:03:20] respect people had character look at the
[1:03:22] character people had when we had no
[1:03:28] now we've got everything we've got
[1:03:31] everything
[1:03:32] and look at where we are with our
[1:03:34] character
[1:03:37] it's terrible isn't it
[1:03:39] so do all this progress all design and
[1:03:41] it really didn't do his end again and i
[1:03:43] heard even the prophet saying that he
[1:03:44] says all of these inventions all of that
[1:03:46] hasn't helped us about it and that's no
[1:03:48] good
[1:03:50] it's nice to have
[1:03:52] but you better have the holy ghost in it
[1:03:54] all
[1:03:55] because otherwise you'll be spoiled
[1:03:57] rotten yeah
[1:03:59] you will be no good if you aren't
[1:04:00] careful because of all this people get
[1:04:03] so swallowed up let me say this people
[1:04:05] get so carried up they get so carried
[1:04:08] away
[1:04:10] with getting more stuff they put god
[1:04:12] last
[1:04:17] when that's your case your god is the
[1:04:20] god of this world the things of this
[1:04:21] world
[1:04:23] huh
[1:04:24] and that's where the world's gotten to
[1:04:26] everybody's about being rich the bible
[1:04:28] says that they're only in time
[1:04:30] revelations 3 he says they'll be rich
[1:04:32] and increase with goods
[1:04:35] i think they have need of nothing and
[1:04:37] don't know that they're wretched
[1:04:38] miserable poor blind naked tattooed
[1:04:41] earrings men don't know who they are
[1:04:43] women can we go on
[1:04:46] it's a terrible shape
[1:04:49] don't know that you're wretched and
[1:04:51] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[1:04:55] why because the spiritual person we do
[1:04:57] not look at the things of this world we
[1:05:00] don't look at all of it we look to the
[1:05:02] unseen the bible says
[1:05:05] we don't look to the scenes because the
[1:05:07] things that they're seeing are temporal
[1:05:10] they're like a vapor that come and the
[1:05:12] vapor that goes
[1:05:17] look at
[1:05:18] me i'm looking at you oh you know what
[1:05:20] i'm looking at
[1:05:21] i'm looking at a vapor
[1:05:23] just a vapor
[1:05:25] you look up here and you're just seeing
[1:05:27] a vapor a mist
[1:05:29] it comes
[1:05:30] and after a while
[1:05:32] it'll be gone
[1:05:34] brother leo he was here for a while
[1:05:35] remember remember
[1:05:36] now he's gone
[1:05:39] just a vapor
[1:05:41] very temporal
[1:05:43] not eternal
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:46] only one thing's eternal how many knows
[1:05:47] that that's the things that's not seen
[1:05:50] the things that you can't touch with
[1:05:52] your hand
[1:05:53] but how many know they're real
[1:05:56] they are real
[1:05:58] joy is real the holy ghost is real god
[1:06:00] is real salvation is real but you can't
[1:06:03] see it
[1:06:04] you can only see the attributes of it of
[1:06:07] zenith
[1:06:09] but everything about the devil is and
[1:06:11] his kingdom is about the things that you
[1:06:13] can see
[1:06:15] amen
[1:06:17] and the things of this world
[1:06:22] so even the cities look at the cities of
[1:06:24] the world
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:29] oh my
[1:06:32] so now notice
[1:06:35] christians are not about scientific
[1:06:37] research
[1:06:39] here we go back to here
[1:06:41] we're not about science and all this
[1:06:43] plenty
[1:06:45] all of our inventions to do our work
[1:06:48] make things better for us
[1:06:54] wouldn't it be nice if because of the
[1:06:56] fact you just have to push that dryer
[1:06:58] hit or that washer head wash
[1:07:01] turn it
[1:07:02] praise the lord now i can go read more
[1:07:04] and i can pray more
[1:07:06] huh
[1:07:08] because how many knows the only thing
[1:07:10] that's really important is to be rich in
[1:07:11] god
[1:07:13] how many wants to be rich in god tonight
[1:07:15] how many wants to be richer in god amen
[1:07:18] i want to be richer that's my whole
[1:07:19] thought tonight is lord make me richer
[1:07:23] in you
[1:07:25] i'm not going to say poor in the natural
[1:07:27] things
[1:07:29] huh
[1:07:30] maybe he'll make you make you poorer
[1:07:33] amen
[1:07:34] but let me never let that take away from
[1:07:37] me being rich in god
[1:07:39] amen because i don't care if you have
[1:07:41] things abraham was rich
[1:07:43] moses was rich many of those people were
[1:07:45] rich but they all had god first they
[1:07:48] were richer in god
[1:07:50] that's what we need to be
[1:07:53] amen
[1:07:54] praise the lord not about the
[1:07:56] scientifics and so forth we're not about
[1:07:58] the cell phone and all of that other
[1:08:00] stuff that's not our god
[1:08:03] amen
[1:08:04] that's not first it's god that's first
[1:08:06] it's prayer i mean please there's no
[1:08:08] substitution if you want to get rich you
[1:08:11] know how to do it to prayer
[1:08:14] get on your knees
[1:08:16] a man is not
[1:08:18] measured by the size of his bicep or how
[1:08:21] strong he is but what is he measured by
[1:08:26] the bags in his knees
[1:08:29] where he's been
[1:08:30] followed over in the presence of his
[1:08:32] maker and has a relationship talks with
[1:08:35] him
[1:08:36] amen
[1:08:39] that's right
[1:08:46] cain what did he do
[1:08:49] he was after
[1:08:50] worldly knowledge
[1:08:53] now we know one of them know more about
[1:08:55] the word of god don't we
[1:08:57] but satan's knowledge is well god didn't
[1:09:00] really mean that
[1:09:02] well that business you don't have to
[1:09:03] really worry about that that's satan's
[1:09:05] knowledge
[1:09:07] to add something to what god has said or
[1:09:09] done already
[1:09:10] to change it a little bit
[1:09:12] amen
[1:09:14] but says cain's children were scientific
[1:09:16] they were educated
[1:09:18] there was players of musical instruments
[1:09:21] like a modern elvis presley or some of
[1:09:23] this stuff
[1:09:24] huh how many know some of the most

[1:11:24] god right
[1:11:27] listen the world today is dedicating
[1:11:29] themselves to the knowledge which came
[1:11:32] by satan
[1:11:36] how many believes that
[1:11:39] man's day is glorified not by the word
[1:11:42] of god but by the knowledge
[1:11:44] oh let this sink in
[1:11:46] if you get to this part of the place
[1:11:48] tape stop it and play it and think a
[1:11:50] while his works the devil's works are
[1:11:52] exalted above god's word and manifested
[1:11:55] works
[1:11:57] the wisdom of satan which he give to eve
[1:11:59] at the beginning don't miss this the
[1:12:01] wisdom of satan is exalted to the throne
[1:12:04] of worship in man above the vindicated
[1:12:07] word of the hour
[1:12:09] do you know why the world is in the
[1:12:12] condition that it's in it's because the
[1:12:15] church world
[1:12:20] rejected christ
[1:12:23] and accepted
[1:12:25] that wisdom
[1:12:27] that he gave to eve
[1:12:30] they begin by saying well there's no
[1:12:32] more miracles the days of miracles his
[1:12:35] path do you realize how hard the prophet
[1:12:38] of god had to fight that during his time
[1:12:41] everywhere
[1:12:43] the holy ghost was only for the apostles
[1:12:47] only for the 12 disciples
[1:12:50] and a man came to brother bam talking
[1:12:52] that and he said we speak where the
[1:12:54] bible speaks we're
[1:12:55] the bible silent
[1:12:57] boy they got caught that time
[1:12:59] because they met a man
[1:13:01] that knew the maker and the writer
[1:13:04] writer of the word
[1:13:06] more than what he knew the writing of
[1:13:08] the word
[1:13:09] he knew the author better than he knew
[1:13:12] the book
[1:13:13] he said i may not know the book but i
[1:13:14] know the author real well
[1:13:16] but he knew the book enough to say well
[1:13:18] what about the 120 that came out of the
[1:13:20] upper room what about cornelius what
[1:13:22] about the 19th chapter of acts where
[1:13:24] paul ladies and they got the holy ghost
[1:13:27] blew him all out of the water
[1:13:29] tried to say only the 12th god and there
[1:13:30] the bible says in every word hey i got
[1:13:32] it
[1:13:33] amen
[1:13:34] she shall receive the holy ghost that
[1:13:36] promises to you to your children to them
[1:13:38] that are far off even as many as the
[1:13:40] lord like god shall call don't shut
[1:13:42] god's blessings up
[1:13:45] but they took the knowledge of the devil
[1:13:48] over the vindicated and proven word of
[1:13:50] god brother man says and they absolutely
[1:13:53] exalted the devil to the place that he
[1:13:55] desired in isaiah the 14th chapter when
[1:13:58] he said i will exalt my throne above the
[1:14:00] messengers of god the stars of god
[1:14:03] i will exalt my throne above those stars
[1:14:07] whatever they say i will exalt my throne
[1:14:09] above those
[1:14:11] amen when came in our generation with
[1:14:14] the vindication to prove the word they
[1:14:16] took the barabbas a murderer
[1:14:20] a lie of the devil over god's vindicated
[1:14:23] word and threw the whole creation into
[1:14:26] what
[1:14:27] spiritual
[1:14:29] death
[1:14:31] now
[1:14:33] now those is satan's kingdom have church

[1:14:53] man but from a woman

[1:15:25] ramsay but they're worshipping the devil
[1:15:29] and brotherhood said the devil
[1:15:30] absolutely deceived the church world
[1:15:33] just like he deceived eve and now they
[1:15:36] are worshiping what they think is god

[1:23:34] everything else
[1:23:36] human trafficking i think they call it
[1:23:38] right
[1:23:39] it's more relevant what you realize
[1:23:43] all of that's going on selling humans
[1:23:46] you wouldn't think that in our modern
[1:23:48] age but it is
[1:23:50] amen
[1:23:51] the fruits that thy soul lusted after
[1:23:55] are departed from thee
[1:23:58] amen how many knows all of this is going
[1:24:00] to come crashing down
[1:24:03] amen
[1:24:06] one place it talks about once this jesus
[1:24:08] comes it'll be that stone that's chewed
[1:24:10] out of the mountain that'll crush the
[1:24:12] nation's
[1:24:14] the fine powder another place it talks
[1:24:16] about there's an earthquakes where all
[1:24:18] the cities of the earth
[1:24:20] fell
[1:24:22] all the skyscrapers all those yeah
[1:24:24] they're all coming down
[1:24:27] no mercy how many knows those people
[1:24:29] will die
[1:24:30] there will be no mercy when the wrath of
[1:24:34] god
[1:24:35] gets poured out folks
[1:24:36] it's going to be unlike anybody could
[1:24:38] ever imagine
[1:24:42] you can't even imagine it
[1:24:45] but it'll be terrible
[1:24:47] because the bible says the great and
[1:24:49] terrible day of the lord
[1:24:51] that cometh
[1:24:53] to destroy the kingdom
[1:24:55] of the
[1:24:56] devil they shall find them
[1:25:00] no
[1:25:01] more
[1:25:02] and the merchants of these things which
[1:25:04] were made rich
[1:25:06] by her shall stand far off for the fear
[1:25:09] of her torment
[1:25:10] weeping and
[1:25:12] wailing
[1:25:14] amen we know that in revelation i'ma
[1:25:16] stop right there
[1:25:19] talk about your riches coming or not but
[1:25:21] in revelations i believe it's 13.
[1:25:25] remember that the antichrist
[1:25:28] the final goal during the tribulation
[1:25:30] period
[1:25:32] in about half of half halfway through
[1:25:34] the tribulation period i believe it is
[1:25:38] that rome makes a pact with israel all
[1:25:41] the rich merchants they'll get the gold
[1:25:43] and the bonds together
[1:25:45] and the catholics will control
[1:25:48] all the wealth of the world
[1:25:50] the pope is going to be the anti he is
[1:25:53] the antichrist and will become
[1:25:55] the beast after the bride leaves
[1:25:57] but they're going to have some complete
[1:25:59] i've got the quote right here where he
[1:26:00] says they'll be the ones that have
[1:26:02] complete control of all the finances
[1:26:05] and if you don't think that's coming now
[1:26:07] how many does all these things are
[1:26:08] coming down close
[1:26:10] what was it the other day the other day
[1:26:12] just the other day i was told that now
[1:26:15] apple and so forth they're going they
[1:26:16] have permission to go into your phones
[1:26:19] if they want to look at all your
[1:26:20] pictures and your texts and everything
[1:26:22] else
[1:26:24] then another day i heard that now that
[1:26:26] they're making all of the banks report
[1:26:28] your money or they can come and look at
[1:26:30] your bank account anytime they want to
[1:26:33] uh what's all that coming down to
[1:26:35] oh yeah it's a financial squeeze isn't
[1:26:38] it
[1:26:38] i don't believe that when it's
[1:26:40] completely completely enacted i don't
[1:26:42] think we'll be here but i believe that
[1:26:44] will feel the pressure of it but the ban
[1:26:45] says there'll be a squeeze
[1:26:48] they may shut it down i don't know just
[1:26:49] where it'll be but you may even shut the
[1:26:51] church down it'll be right there at that
[1:26:52] edge right on that brink from what i
[1:26:54] understand
[1:26:55] that god will take to take us home
[1:26:58] amen
[1:26:59] but even all these things is that's what
[1:27:01] i'm looking for sometimes you don't
[1:27:03] understand what all these things are
[1:27:04] about but i try to look at it from the
[1:27:06] scripture i try to look at it and what's
[1:27:08] actually happened because i do know that
[1:27:11] at the end
[1:27:13] the very thing is going to be a
[1:27:14] financial squeeze
[1:27:16] you won't be able to buy yourself
[1:27:18] according to revelations 13
[1:27:21] and verse 6 he says
[1:27:22] and he causes all both small sixteen
[1:27:26] yeah small and great rich and poor free
[1:27:28] and bond to receive a mark in their
[1:27:29] right hand or in their foreheads
[1:27:33] you know how uh
[1:27:35] what they call the left today how that
[1:27:37] if you see things different think
[1:27:39] different what they do
[1:27:41] they hate you very bad
[1:27:43] they think you should die you know what
[1:27:46] they actually come out and say
[1:27:48] yeah that person should die he should be
[1:27:50] dead that's the that's the
[1:27:53] the very spirit core of the spirit of it
[1:27:57] amen
[1:28:01] and so this this is the way this
[1:28:03] spirit's gonna be
[1:28:04] if you don't agree with him right
[1:28:08] he's gonna force if you get to take that
[1:28:10] mark to become part of it to have
[1:28:12] fellowship with it to receive your mark
[1:28:14] in their right hand or in their
[1:28:16] foreheads you better think like they do
[1:28:18] and that no man might buy ourselves save
[1:28:21] he that has a mark or the name of the
[1:28:23] beast or the number of his name
[1:28:25] here is wisdom he didn't have
[1:28:27] understanding let him count the number
[1:28:29] of the beast for it is the number of a
[1:28:31] man
[1:28:32] and his number is six hundred
[1:28:35] threescore and six
[1:28:38] amen i don't think we ever understood it
[1:28:39] before but the prophet of god
[1:28:41] he says on the
[1:28:43] crown of the pope is vicarious feely d
[1:28:47] instead of the son of god and you take
[1:28:50] all those roman numerals
[1:28:52] v5 or whatever it is take all of them
[1:28:54] and add them up
[1:28:55] it comes up to 666
[1:29:00] 666
[1:29:02] the pope huh
[1:29:04] but if you do not i mean
[1:29:07] so right there we see that financial
[1:29:08] squeeze he ultimately takes just like
[1:29:11] manipulation through lies through
[1:29:13] financial
[1:29:15] you know people try to bribe you i mean
[1:29:18] bribery all of that is of the devil i'll
[1:29:20] give you this or you do this out or the
[1:29:21] other and here it is
[1:29:23] anybody that doesn't receive that mark
[1:29:25] they'll have they'll have control of it
[1:29:26] i know a lot of people even nowadays
[1:29:28] they're a little bit funny i i may be a
[1:29:30] little earlier yet for that but there's
[1:29:32] a lot of people will have nothing to do
[1:29:33] with the bag everything's cash
[1:29:35] but you see how that it'll no doubt
[1:29:37] probably go to a cashless society to
[1:29:39] where you can't cash won't mean much
[1:29:41] anymore
[1:29:43] let's take about 10 minutes let's talk
[1:29:45] about the kingdom of god for a minute
[1:29:46] shall we because we know what's going to
[1:29:48] happen whenever whenever satan is at the
[1:29:51] pinnacle of his
[1:29:53] in his uh kingdom
[1:29:55] christ will come and do what crush it
[1:29:58] and grind it
[1:30:00] to powder
[1:30:02] right now the children of god don't mean
[1:30:04] much we're cast out we're sheep amongst
[1:30:07] wolves is that right
[1:30:10] don't worry about them if they kill you
[1:30:12] jesus said that's all they can do is
[1:30:14] kill you
[1:30:15] it sounds bad but that's what jesus said
[1:30:17] all they can do is kill you and then
[1:30:18] they can't do anymore
[1:30:21] huh
[1:30:23] but you know and i don't know i'm not
[1:30:24] saying that about this age hopefully we
[1:30:26] won't have to go through any of that but
[1:30:28] we're going to rapture but look at down
[1:30:30] through the dark ages the 68 million
[1:30:32] that they slaughtered they killed
[1:30:36] amen satan's a ruthless guy
[1:30:39] let's turn to romans just a few minutes
[1:30:41] and we'll let you go romans let's look
[1:30:43] at the kingdom of god and what it is
[1:30:46] i mean he believes that if you're born
[1:30:47] again you come into the kingdom of god
[1:30:50] right
[1:30:51] jesus has a kingdom
[1:30:52] right now on earth
[1:30:54] and he's ruling in that kingdom
[1:30:57] but it's not like peter said it's a
[1:30:59] peter thought hey he's going to be our
[1:31:01] king our king has come let me grab my
[1:31:03] sword i'm ready to fight
[1:31:06] ain't nobody going to take my king cut
[1:31:08] his ear off
[1:31:10] but jesus says no no no no no this cause
[1:31:13] is going to go a little different
[1:31:14] he's going to go a little different here
[1:31:16] because i'm going to give my life
[1:31:18] for the sins of the whole world
[1:31:21] we're going to do some cleansing we're
[1:31:22] going to do get some people ready on the
[1:31:24] inside we're going to bring back my sons
[1:31:27] and daughters in this kingdom
[1:31:30] and paul was talking about in 14 to 14th
[1:31:33] chapter
[1:31:34] he was talking about not putting
[1:31:36] something in another
[1:31:37] brother or sister's
[1:31:39] place to where he caused them to stumble
[1:31:41] and if you eat meat if certain meats
[1:31:44] perhaps causes thy brother to stumble
[1:31:46] well don't eat that meat then when
[1:31:47] you're with him you know you don't want
[1:31:49] to cause nobody to stumble
[1:31:51] all right
[1:31:52] verse 15 of chapter 14 but if thy
[1:31:55] brother be of grief with my meat now
[1:31:57] walk us down not charitably destroy not
[1:31:59] him with thy me
[1:32:02] for whom christ died
[1:32:04] let not then your good be evil spoken
[1:32:07] spoke of for the kingdom of god is not
[1:32:10] meat and
[1:32:12] drink
[1:32:13] let me just say that it's not all the
[1:32:15] deities it's not all the good things of
[1:32:17] this world all the that's not what the
[1:32:18] kingdom of god is it's got nothing to do
[1:32:20] with us amen
[1:32:23] sure we have to eat we have to drink but
[1:32:25] even jesus said don't worry about what
[1:32:26] you eat or drink or clothes you know
[1:32:28] your life is more than god knows all
[1:32:30] about that amen
[1:32:33] but what is the kingdom of god it is
[1:32:35] righteousness
[1:32:36] and peace
[1:32:38] and joy in the holy ghost
[1:32:42] i like that we're not going to go
[1:32:44] through great detail but how many knows
[1:32:45] that the kingdom of god is his
[1:32:48] forgiveness
[1:32:49] his grace
[1:32:50] his mercy the blood of jesus christ that
[1:32:53] washes you white make you righteous
[1:32:55] before almighty god
[1:32:58] it's what's in here i mean it's kingdom
[1:32:59] of god it's about being
[1:33:02] right with god
[1:33:06] that's what the kingdom is all about
[1:33:08] being right with god and what does that
[1:33:10] bring
[1:33:11] it brings peace therefore being
[1:33:14] justified by faith paul said in romans i
[1:33:17] think third fourth chapter does
[1:33:18] therefore justified by faith we have
[1:33:20] peace with
[1:33:23] god
[1:33:25] i don't know about you but i really
[1:33:28] enjoy
[1:33:29] that
[1:33:30] peace
[1:33:31] how many enjoys that peace
[1:33:34] that peace that passes understanding he
[1:33:37] brings you to peace with god and that
[1:33:40] peace also brings joy
[1:33:43] in what
[1:33:45] natural things
[1:33:46] no
[1:33:47] in the holy ghost
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:52] because in the world in closing
[1:33:54] with all the inventions and everything
[1:33:56] listen he says all he thinks god will
[1:33:58] give them pleasure it ought to give them
[1:34:00] joy but it don't does it
[1:34:02] no we find mental illness
[1:34:05] taking such a toll as to alarm the
[1:34:07] nation
[1:34:09] when everybody ought to be happy with
[1:34:11] really nothing to be unhappy about about
[1:34:14] but yet look at the condition of the
[1:34:16] world today are they happy no they're
[1:34:18] not at not ever they're not near as
[1:34:20] happy as what they ever wore when they
[1:34:22] didn't have as much as what they do
[1:34:24] why because they're looking for it in a
[1:34:27] different way
[1:34:29] but i don't know about you but i just
[1:34:30] say god help me i want to be rich
[1:34:33] in god
[1:34:36] and we only get that one way and that is
[1:34:38] on our knees and say god
[1:34:40] i need more of you
[1:34:42] more of you
[1:34:44] by reading his word by praying amen by
[1:34:48] and making time for god
[1:34:50] amen
[1:34:52] not let the devil take all of our time
[1:34:55] let me say this and close don't let the
[1:34:56] devil
[1:34:57] take all your time make sure that you
[1:35:00] give god plenty of time
[1:35:03] in prayer and in reading
[1:35:06] and searching your soul
[1:35:08] looking in the mirror saying god see if
[1:35:10] there's any wicked way in me
[1:35:12] because the true kingdom of god is about
[1:35:14] god making you right with him bringing
[1:35:16] you with peace and joy in the holy ghost
[1:35:18] god bless you stand with me tonight
[1:35:22] musicians if
[1:35:28] let's bow our heads
[1:35:33] just think about that over there
[1:35:36] in revelations
[1:35:38] think about all of those things
[1:35:40] that the bible says all those things
[1:35:44] that thy soul
[1:35:47] lusted
[1:35:48] after
[1:35:49] they all perished
[1:35:51] i think we should all be careful
[1:35:54] that our soul doesn't lust after
[1:35:58] all of those things that's out there
[1:36:00] but that our soul longs
[1:36:03] after more of god more of the
[1:36:05] righteousness of god
[1:36:07] the peace of god
[1:36:09] looking for him to come in the clouds of
[1:36:11] heaven
[1:36:12] not being tied down to the things of
[1:36:15] this world
[1:36:16] bolted down so to speak
[1:36:18] but to be ready to leave at any time to
[1:36:20] meet the lord in the air
[1:36:22] how many want to just raise their hand
[1:36:24] and say god help me not to be tied to
[1:36:26] this world but to be rich in you
[1:36:28] lord make me richer in you tonight
[1:36:31] lord our hands are all up because that's
[1:36:33] the desire of our heart father we so we
[1:36:36] see where all these delicacies is going
[1:36:38] we see where that's going to end up
[1:36:41] lord that's going nowhere even all the
[1:36:43] things that we possess god we realize
[1:36:45] one day
[1:36:46] we'll mean nothing our farms our nice
[1:36:48] houses
[1:36:49] we don't know whether they'll be taken
[1:36:51] from us perhaps
[1:36:52] god we can't put our whole effort and
[1:36:55] our whole life and our ambitions and our
[1:36:57] time and everything into him lord we
[1:36:59] just do what we have to do to get by
[1:37:01] lord jesus we ask god that you'd help us
[1:37:04] father that every day we'd seek to get
[1:37:06] richer in you lord
[1:37:08] father we ask god that you'd help us to
[1:37:10] look to your kingdom look to the things
[1:37:11] that are not seen such as peace and
[1:37:14] righteousness and joy
[1:37:16] it's just something that we can have in
[1:37:18] our hearts know that we have it
[1:37:20] because you've given it to us lord lord
[1:37:22] if there's anybody in here that don't
[1:37:24] really have it father just
[1:37:26] knows they don't really have it i pray
[1:37:28] god before sunday that somehow they
[1:37:30] would find a place and talk to you talk
[1:37:32] it over with you lord and seek you with
[1:37:34] all their heart until they find it and
[1:37:36] they have that righteousness that peace
[1:37:38] and their joy
[1:37:39] in the holy ghost
[1:37:41] we ask it in jesus name
[1:37:43] amen and amen
