[36:30] Zachary Wallace from Lima Ohio I go to
[36:33] church there with brother Jonathan
[36:34] Martin he said to please extend his
[36:36] greetings down to you here God bless you
[36:39] and uh I come from Arizona for upwards
[36:43] of 30 years out there and was with
[36:46] brother Ted pasadley which I'm sure many
[36:47] of you know him as well and so
[36:50] just really happy to be here tonight I
[36:54] didn't get to bring with me I have a
[36:56] wife of four kids and but they're in
[36:59] school so it just didn't work out but
[37:01] we're here tonight helping a brother
[37:04] Austin Freeman his house yeah yeah and
[37:07] you sure like it hot down here in
[37:08] Kentucky I'm telling you
[37:10] it's pretty rough
[37:14] something I was thinking about today is
[37:16] you know at least we don't have to worry
[37:18] about you down here just going to church
[37:20] to try and Escape hell or something or
[37:22] you'd be out of the state of Kentucky
[37:23] that's the way I was feeling today out
[37:25] in that heat it was pretty rough but uh
[37:29] we'll just uh go to the word of the Lord
[37:32] tonight and Joshua the fifth chapter
[37:35] and uh
[37:37] take a text there
[37:41] kind of gonna move a little bit fast
[37:42] tonight I I took a similar line of
[37:45] thought Sunday back at the home church
[37:47] but uh it went a little bit long so I
[37:51] had to just
[37:52] start cutting away and that's tough on a
[37:55] preacher you know cutting things out so
[37:57] we'll just put it into a little higher
[37:59] year and hopefully we'll we'll get you a
[38:01] sleepy kentuckian's home in time so
[38:03] Joshua the fifth chapter beginning at
[38:06] verse 13 says and it came to pass when
[38:09] Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up
[38:11] his eyes and looked and behold there
[38:14] stood a man over against him with his
[38:17] sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went
[38:20] unto him
[38:21] and said unto him now if you see a man
[38:23] standing with a weapon you're on you're
[38:25] just gonna March right up to him
[38:27] this was a man under a Divine Commission
[38:30] and he said unto him art thou for us or
[38:32] for our adversaries and he said nay but
[38:35] as captain of the host the Lord am I
[38:38] come now come and Joshua fell on his
[38:41] face to the Earth and did worship and
[38:44] said unto him what saith my Lord unto
[38:48] his servant
[38:49] and captain of the Lord's host said unto
[38:51] Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot
[38:54] for the place where on thou standest is
[38:56] Holy and Joshua did so we see Joshua
[39:00] having experience here
[39:02] with the same one that Moses had an
[39:05] experience with and he walks away with
[39:08] the same Authority I'd like to take a
[39:11] text tonight on surrendering
[39:13] to the absolute let's just go to the
[39:16] Lord in a word of Prayer
[39:19] Heavenly Father we just want to yield
[39:20] ourselves to you tonight Lord we want
[39:23] you to come down
[39:25] have preeminence in your people and in
[39:27] your word we just ask that your word
[39:30] would be spoken to the heart and I ask
[39:32] that every one of us would be completely
[39:34] yielded and surrendered to the authority
[39:37] of your word in this hour in the name of
[39:40] Jesus Christ
[39:42] may be seated tonight
[39:45] brother so he comes here and he talks to
[39:48] this captain of the host or the general
[39:50] of the armies of the Lord and he says
[39:52] what do you want to tell me and he
[39:55] begins to communicate with him now we
[39:57] don't get the rest of of what they
[39:59] talked about here written down but
[40:01] brother Branham over in uh this day this
[40:04] scripture is fulfilled he he sheds a
[40:06] little light on that and he says they
[40:08] were there marching around Jericho the
[40:10] last time and the walls fell down Joshua
[40:13] could have stood up and said this day
[40:15] the chief captain of the host of the
[40:17] Lord told me weeks ago that it would
[40:19] happen like this this day this scripture
[40:22] is fulfilled there laid the walls flat
[40:25] on the ground come on let's go take it
[40:27] it belongs to us this day this scripture
[40:30] is fulfilled now what I want to look at
[40:33] is how that man Joshua he came in
[40:36] contact with nothing less than God
[40:38] himself and it gave him a word it gave
[40:40] him marching orders it gave him
[40:42] Direction it gave him purpose it told
[40:45] him what you need to do to live an
[40:47] overcoming life it told him what you
[40:49] need to do to take out the enemy
[40:51] stronghold he got his direct orders from
[40:53] that and when he followed that he's seen
[40:56] the supernatural released in his life
[40:58] but it without that word without that
[41:02] direction he would have been trying who
[41:04] knows what method to try and accomplish
[41:06] this purpose
[41:07] he had some general idea we're supposed
[41:09] to take this land but how is he going to
[41:12] do it well he got in contact with an
[41:15] absolute he got in contact with that
[41:17] same one that had told Moses what was
[41:19] going to happen when he was out there
[41:21] hurting sheep out in the wilderness and
[41:23] he comes in contact with him and then
[41:25] you had that absolute
[41:27] now this is the infallible word of God
[41:32] this is God's word any kind of a
[41:34] ministry that's built upon anything else
[41:38] besides this is an heir
[41:41] that's God's word primarily
[41:44] first and basic
[41:46] God's word
[41:47] it's an absolute now an absolute
[41:51] it has no restrictions no exceptions or
[41:55] qualifications
[41:58] now
[42:00] that there is no nothing that qualifies
[42:03] this to be the absolute all right now I
[42:07] want to explain why that's really
[42:08] important if you say well the Bible is
[42:12] right because brother Byler said it's
[42:14] right
[42:15] well now this is getting into Authority
[42:17] from you
[42:19] and now he's the absolute and he said
[42:21] well why do you believe the Bible is
[42:22] absolutely says oh well you see there
[42:24] was an archaeologist who dug up a rock
[42:26] that matched something that they had in
[42:27] the Bible so now we believe the Bible is
[42:29] the absolutely it's like so we're
[42:30] tracing that all the way back and now
[42:32] your Authority is actually coming from
[42:34] the archaeologist
[42:36] no this is the final say this is the end
[42:41] of the question this is the end of the
[42:43] line this is the final place
[42:46] where you find truth it's the word of
[42:49] God there's nothing
[42:51] or if you can just catch this there's
[42:53] nothing that makes God God there's
[42:55] nobody that makes him that's decided
[42:57] this is going to be God no that's what
[42:59] he is in himself it's something called
[43:01] intrinsic value it's something that
[43:03] cannot be affected by anything else on
[43:05] the outside it is what it is
[43:08] and the word of God is the absolute and
[43:11] there's nothing that qualifies it
[43:14] there's nothing big enough to say well
[43:17] I'm gonna lend my support behind this
[43:19] and make it an authority no it's the
[43:22] final Authority
[43:25] there's no court of appeals when it
[43:27] comes to the word of God friends if you
[43:29] find something in the word of God you
[43:30] don't like you can't appeal it to the
[43:32] next you know higher level no
[43:34] you got to surrender to it
[43:37] now you can try and fight you know your
[43:40] local cord here you might argue with the
[43:42] local representative or the sheriff that
[43:44] lives next door to you maybe you know
[43:45] him real well or whatever you might have
[43:47] your argument with him you might take a
[43:49] case to farther and farther and farther
[43:50] but finally it hits the end of the line
[43:52] in the United States that's the Supreme
[43:54] Court
[43:55] and when it hits that
[43:57] that's it
[43:59] it's done there's no argument left
[44:02] final word
[44:04] we have an absolute it's a final word
[44:07] now an absolute is perfect in itself
[44:12] Unlimited in its power primarily an
[44:16] ultimate
[44:18] now brother brand preached an absolute
[44:20] four or five different times and he
[44:22] really lays it in there beautifully uh
[44:24] the word of God is infallible infallible
[44:27] means it's something that cannot be
[44:29] wrong
[44:31] so whatever it does
[44:33] is right yeah yeah if it can't be wrong
[44:36] it also means infallible means it cannot
[44:38] fail now every one of you is fallible
[44:43] every one of you can fail and has failed
[44:46] and will fail
[44:48] but this will never fail the word of God
[44:52] is infallible
[44:55] what it speaks stands
[44:58] now you got to have something in your
[45:01] life that's your absolute you got to
[45:03] have something that's your Anchor Point
[45:05] there's some thing there's something in
[45:08] your life that you're basing everything
[45:09] else off of if that's your own opinion
[45:12] if that's your absolute
[45:14] you're building on sink in Sands if
[45:17] you're basing it off of whatever
[45:19] cultural society says that this is right
[45:21] or this is normal
[45:25] where's that going to take you
[45:27] people are trying to build their life
[45:29] out of an absolute but it's an absolute
[45:32] that they've made up themselves
[45:34] and it doesn't work
[45:37] it does not have solid a solid
[45:40] foundation to it and so anything comes
[45:44] along and suddenly they say well you
[45:45] know what we're going to change you know
[45:47] we're going to change the absolute and
[45:49] now uh yeah a man can be a woman and a
[45:52] woman can be a man
[45:53] nonsense
[45:56] they can change that all they want but
[45:58] they're still an absolute truth it's not
[46:00] your thought it's not my thought it's
[46:02] his thoughts
[46:03] [Applause]
[46:05] now the word is your absolute but the
[46:10] word is more than just a sentence or a
[46:13] verse in the Bible now I know this is
[46:15] kind of quibbling a little bit but it's
[46:16] important all right I we could open up
[46:18] just to uh to Exodus here chapter 12 and
[46:21] we could read here it says that to the
[46:24] children of Israel he speaks to them and
[46:26] he says every year you must slay a lamb
[46:28] for sacrifice
[46:30] that is the word of God anybody want to
[46:31] argue
[46:33] it's absolutely the word of God he says
[46:35] every year you've got a lamb how many
[46:37] here have went out yearly in slay lamb
[46:42] nobody here
[46:43] I didn't think so
[46:46] now do you believe this or not God said
[46:48] to do that
[46:50] do you understand what I'm saying
[46:52] all right
[46:54] that's where it comes down to being
[46:55] really important about the message for
[46:57] your hour
[46:59] but it's not just one verse
[47:01] [Music]
[47:05] you have to take God's word from Genesis
[47:09] to Revelations and when you take it
[47:11] together you find out that that lamb
[47:14] sacrifice has been fulfilled and there
[47:17] is a sacrifice that's not the slave for
[47:19] once you know every year but it was
[47:21] slain once for all and it has taken away
[47:24] sin forever
[47:26] there is a fulfillment of that scripture
[47:28] verse there's more to the story and when
[47:30] you take this word of God from Genesis
[47:32] to Revelations then you get the entirety
[47:35] of what the word is saying
[47:38] but if you just take one little verse or
[47:40] one little quote
[47:42] you can get almost anything you want to
[47:44] imagine out of it
[47:46] you can come and say well I can show you
[47:48] right here in the Bible that Jesus
[47:49] wasn't God because it says Jesus wept
[47:52] yeah it says that but your little theory
[47:55] is thinner than the argument made out of
[47:57] the shadow of the broth of the chicken
[47:58] that starved to death
[48:00] there's no real substance to it it
[48:01] doesn't line up with the word of God
[48:04] now
[48:06] the absolute your absolute must be the
[48:09] word but the word is more than just
[48:12] paper and ink
[48:15] the word
[48:18] well
[48:20] The Book of John it says in the
[48:21] beginning was the word and the Word was
[48:24] with God and the Word was God what do we
[48:28] call that the logos the pillar of fire
[48:31] that is the word and the Word was made
[48:36] flesh and dwelt among us and what do we
[48:40] call that Jesus Christ
[48:43] brother brand says in the absolute and
[48:45] if you're absolute to some organization
[48:47] or some sensation or something else
[48:49] besides the person of Jesus Christ
[48:52] you'll come to the same portion of Shame
[48:55] speaking of these people the same
[48:57] portion of Shame only worse see if your
[49:00] absolute is not Christ
[49:02] it's the only centerpost of the human
[49:04] life and Christ is the word not your
[49:08] church your word the word see upon this
[49:12] absolute I'll build my church upon
[49:14] Christ the word
[49:17] now it's more than just ink it's more
[49:21] than just you know paper it is a living
[49:23] low loss it's a Living Word it's Jesus
[49:26] Christ that is your typos that is your
[49:29] absolute and you've got to recognize
[49:33] where Jesus is at
[49:36] you gotta recognize
[49:39] what's happening in your hour
[49:41] otherwise you'll miss
[49:44] what God's doing right now because
[49:46] you're looking back to what Jesus did a
[49:49] year ago and you got to recognize him
[49:52] right now
[49:53] now
[49:56] if we if we pull over here to uh the Old
[49:59] Testament for a few minutes I want to
[50:00] look at what is the Bible what is the
[50:02] word of God that we hold so so valuably
[50:05] well what are the five first five books
[50:07] of the Bible who wrote those
[50:10] Moses all right and uh we got here the
[50:14] books the the Joshua we got Samuel we
[50:17] got some histories of the kings that
[50:19] were recorded we've got uh job she was a
[50:22] prophet we've got uh Psalms David he was
[50:25] a prophet we've got uh Isaiah what was
[50:29] he
[50:30] Jeremiah
[50:32] Ezekiel
[50:35] well I can go through all the rest of
[50:36] them but you know the answer they were
[50:39] Prophets
[50:40] we have a few histories recorded there
[50:42] and different things like that but when
[50:44] somebody stands there and begins to say
[50:46] here is the word of the Lord
[50:49] and it's recorded for us
[50:52] it's a prophet
[50:54] now that's very important
[50:56] we get to the New Testament we have
[50:58] Matthew Mark Luke and John
[51:00] recorded histories of Jesus speaking and
[51:03] the messages he brought and then the
[51:06] rest of the New Testament primarily was
[51:08] broke by one man and what was he
[51:11] he was a prophet
[51:13] you've seen a continuity here you're
[51:15] seeing how God operates when God came
[51:18] down to Moses he comes down that Pillar
[51:20] of Fire and he meets with him and he
[51:22] says to Moses I am come down to deliver
[51:25] them out of the hands of the Egyptians
[51:28] Moses no doubt had a Jubilee He says
[51:30] I've been worried about them poor
[51:32] fellows for a long time thank you Lord
[51:33] you're going down to deliver them that's
[51:35] wonderful
[51:38] and then a few moments later God says
[51:40] come now therefore and I will send thee
[51:44] God didn't change his mind on what he
[51:46] was doing
[51:47] their friends he didn't say I'm gonna
[51:50] come down no no bad idea I'm not doing
[51:52] that actually I'm going to send you
[51:53] instead no no it wasn't I'm sending you
[51:55] instead I have come down and what
[51:57] they're going to see is you
[52:02] and Moses he stepped out there and he
[52:04] began to speak to them and God began to
[52:06] vindicate his ministry like you you
[52:08] wouldn't believe and begin to show signs
[52:10] and wonders and Supernatural he leads
[52:12] them out of there they part the Red Sea
[52:15] and they're trying to kill Moses left
[52:17] and right if you just look at it they're
[52:19] they're they don't know understand they
[52:21] don't have a clue what a messenger word
[52:23] Prophet is
[52:25] they're like this man's lifting himself
[52:27] up
[52:29] okay you go you go read the story you go
[52:31] read the history you read uh you read
[52:33] numbers uh 13 and 14. you read where
[52:36] Miriam and and Aaron they looked at
[52:39] Moses and they says you're not the only
[52:40] Holy One and they began to speak against
[52:42] him and the scripture says and God heard
[52:43] it it came down into the church the
[52:46] woman Maryam and Aaron were both judged
[52:48] by God and Mary and the church was
[52:50] struck with Leprosy which represents sin
[52:52] you walked a congregation and a Ministry
[52:54] begin to disrespect God's prophet and
[52:56] you watch if sin doesn't just run
[52:58] rampant through that congregation
[53:01] now
[53:03] they just didn't get it they didn't
[53:04] understand you see they never really
[53:06] have understood
[53:08] that that man's not just doing this on
[53:10] his own this isn't his idea this isn't
[53:12] his message and Moses stood there again
[53:15] and again and God Vindicated him dathan
[53:17] and cores raised up the Earth opened up
[53:19] and swallowed up their Ministries there
[53:21] was just time and again that God stood
[53:22] there and Vindicated that Prophet to the
[53:24] people and they'd murmur and they'd
[53:26] complain
[53:28] and the scripture even says Moses says
[53:30] you're not murmuring against us
[53:33] you're murmuring against God
[53:36] they just had a hard time looking past
[53:38] the veil and seeing what God was really
[53:40] doing
[53:41] and Moses he comes out of the land of
[53:43] his land of Israel and he says God's
[53:44] going to give you this land he says now
[53:46] you obey my word he says you don't alter
[53:48] from it if you'll obey my word God's
[53:50] Gonna bless you if you disobey my word
[53:52] going to curse you
[53:54] now
[53:56] that's pretty strong words for a man to
[53:58] say
[54:00] like who does he think he is really yeah
[54:03] to stand up there and say you're going
[54:04] to listen to what I say or you're going
[54:06] to be cursed
[54:10] I mean I want you to put yourself in
[54:12] their shoes in their day what would you
[54:14] have thought
[54:16] judge it off of what you think right now
[54:21] how many scripture verses prophesied of
[54:23] Moses's Ministry
[54:26] one or two
[54:28] God said he was going to visit them
[54:31] they didn't have a lot they could go
[54:32] back to in the scripture and see a
[54:33] Ministry for hold that was going to come
[54:35] and give them covenants and laws and
[54:37] ways to live everyday life and how to
[54:39] cook their food and how to dress their
[54:40] family they didn't have these this four
[54:43] telling of this ministry that was going
[54:45] to come
[54:46] but it was a Vindicated Ministry
[54:50] we come
[54:51] I don't know maybe three four thousand
[54:53] years after that and there's a man
[54:55] stands up in Paul
[54:58] and he begins to bring a Ministry and he
[55:00] says the circumcision that Abraham our
[55:03] forefathers gave us
[55:04] irrelevant
[55:07] you don't need it yeah and this was
[55:10] something that was tearing up the
[55:11] Christian church
[55:12] they were all you know but God gave it
[55:14] to Abraham this is the law like the
[55:16] Gentiles should be circumcised this is
[55:18] important and Paul walks up and he says
[55:22] that is no more
[55:24] yeah just fulfilled sacrifices you don't
[55:27] need them keeping holy days and all
[55:29] these things he says no no no you're on
[55:31] the wrong line
[55:33] and they could take them back to the
[55:35] word of God and say but here it is
[55:36] here's where it says this is what
[55:40] Paul was standing there telling them
[55:43] you're in the Fulfillment of Prophecy
[55:46] here's where we're at right now
[55:50] now
[55:53] Paul how many scripture verses speak of
[55:56] Paul's Ministry
[55:57] said he was going to come with this
[55:59] ministry of a new testament
[56:04] like what is there
[56:08] you ever done a study on that brother
[56:10] how many scripture verses prophesy of
[56:13] Paul's Ministry
[56:14] I mean we have scriptures talking about
[56:16] John the Baptist and other ones
[56:19] right but what spoke of Paul
[56:22] it's just not really there
[56:31] now
[56:33] he stands up and he begins to give them
[56:35] thus saith the Lord for that generation
[56:40] and then he has the audacity to write in
[56:43] second Timothy or second Thessalonians 3
[56:45] 14 If any man obey not our word by this
[56:48] epistle note that man and have no
[56:51] company with him that he may be ashamed
[56:55] a code as this guy think he is
[56:59] and he really didn't have that shining
[57:00] of a background he was out there
[57:01] murdering Christians
[57:07] and then he but he was only says yeah
[57:08] count them not as an enemy but admonish
[57:10] him as a brother
[57:11] he's saying don't even associate with
[57:14] somebody that won't listen to what I'm
[57:16] saying
[57:18] me we were having devotions the other
[57:20] day and my so my seven-year-old he was
[57:22] trying to figure out you know what to do
[57:23] about that because he's like says not
[57:25] even to have company with them but to
[57:27] admonish him as a brother so you know
[57:29] you got to be seeing him or something so
[57:31] his conclusion as a seven-year-old was
[57:33] that you can't be best friends
[57:36] and you know
[57:38] you're exactly right brother says you
[57:40] show me your company I'll show you what
[57:42] you are
[57:45] what Fellowship has light with Darkness
[57:48] now the position of a Vindicated word
[57:53] prophet
[57:55] is beyond our comprehension friends
[57:58] Paul goes on in First Corinthians 14 37
[58:01] If any man think himself to be a prophet
[58:03] or spiritual let it acknowledge that the
[58:05] things that I write unto you are the
[58:07] Commandments of the Lord
[58:10] in other words whenever I say goes
[58:14] what I'm saying is an absolute that's
[58:17] what Ball's telling them
[58:19] he says but if any man be ignorant let
[58:22] him be ignorant
[58:24] Galatians 1 8. but though we are an
[58:27] angel from heaven preach any other
[58:28] gospel unto you than that which we have
[58:31] preached unto you let him be accursed
[58:35] as we said before so say I now again
[58:37] just in case you thought he made a
[58:39] mistake there so say that again if any
[58:42] man preached any other gospel unto you
[58:43] than that ye have received let him be
[58:46] accursed
[58:48] now
[58:50] again that's a very bold way to speak
[58:55] it's a very it's a great audacity to
[58:57] stand there and put out a a word of God
[59:00] like that and say if an angel from
[59:02] heaven tries to correct what I'm telling
[59:04] you
[59:05] he's cursed
[59:08] do you realize the position of a
[59:10] Vindicated word prophet
[59:13] is above any angel
[59:15] his ministry is beyond any Angel if an
[59:17] angel would try and come and contradict
[59:20] that message that angel would be cursed
[59:27] now
[59:29] you know where we're headed
[59:32] how many scriptures speak of William
[59:34] branham's Ministry
[59:39] we could start in Genesis to Revelations
[59:41] and we'd be here for weeks so we won't
[59:44] do that uh in one place in Christ's
[59:46] mystery of God revealed he's talking
[59:48] about how that that last final mystery
[59:50] is revealed in every single type that's
[59:53] in the Bible and that's directly tied
[59:56] into William branham's Ministry so I'm
[59:58] not exaggerating when I say it's
[1:00:00] everywhere through the scriptures but we
[1:00:03] could we could go we could look at the
[1:00:06] types and shadows of it of it we could
[1:00:07] we could see how like it was in Noah's
[1:00:10] day we could look at how it was uh in in
[1:00:13] Isaac and Rebecca it was such a
[1:00:15] beautiful type there of a Ministry going
[1:00:17] to bring forth a bride this is this
[1:00:19] whole thing has been about God's hidden
[1:00:21] purpose God's had a hidden purpose a
[1:00:23] plan for for thousands of years what
[1:00:25] he's been trying to accomplish
[1:00:30] and the Met Ministry that he brought
[1:00:32] forth to accomplish that purpose to
[1:00:35] bring forth that bride was William
[1:00:37] Miriam Branham
[1:00:39] now Luke 17 26 as it was in the days of
[1:00:42] Noah so shall it be in the days of the
[1:00:44] son of man when you see that right there
[1:00:46] do you know it's talking about this
[1:00:47] lasting Ministry Luke 17 28 likewise
[1:00:50] also as it was in the days of life they
[1:00:53] were when it rained firing Brimstone out
[1:00:55] of the heaven and destroyed them all he
[1:00:56] says even thus shall it be in the day
[1:00:57] when the son of man is revealed the
[1:01:01] revealing of the son of man is what
[1:01:03] happened in William branham's Ministry
[1:01:06] it was the revealing of the son of man
[1:01:08] now
[1:01:09] we could go through and through and
[1:01:11] through with these different scripture
[1:01:12] verses but I believe you're a church
[1:01:14] that's been taught and understand the
[1:01:16] hour that we're living in uh it's not
[1:01:18] nothing new to you but what I want to
[1:01:21] try and establish with you today is the
[1:01:23] authority that that Messengers word says
[1:01:27] on all right I want you to recognize
[1:01:30] that and then what I want you to do is
[1:01:32] surrender to the absolute
[1:01:35] now
[1:01:39] the pillar of Fire
[1:01:41] maybe maybe not okay we have this one
[1:01:44] here
[1:01:45] um brother Branham was in uh Sam Houston
[1:01:47] Coliseum there and uh and he and he was
[1:01:50] there for that debate and as he was
[1:01:53] there he comes down to the platform he
[1:01:55] steps up there and then the how the
[1:01:58] angel came to me in his commission I
[1:01:59] listened to the other day it was just
[1:02:00] beautiful he says and I
[1:02:02] and I said well that's all but I said
[1:02:04] but for myself I can do nothing of my
[1:02:08] own self and I said if I tell the truth
[1:02:12] God's obligated to me to witness that
[1:02:16] it's the truth
[1:02:17] and those are some strong words right
[1:02:19] there he says this is what he was
[1:02:20] repeating if I tell the truth God's
[1:02:22] obligated me to witness that it's the
[1:02:25] truth and about that time something went
[1:02:30] and here he come coming right down
[1:02:35] telling the truth God's obligated to
[1:02:38] witness that I'm telling the truth and
[1:02:41] a pillar of fire which is the logos came
[1:02:45] down and showed that he was witnessing
[1:02:47] what this man is saying is the truth
[1:02:52] and then he goes on in that sermon of
[1:02:55] how the angel came in his commission
[1:02:56] gets to the prayer line and he deserves
[1:02:59] seven different people
[1:03:01] Discerning their lives or things that
[1:03:03] happen to them and it goes through like
[1:03:05] that and I didn't count but I was
[1:03:08] wondering how many times do we see Jesus
[1:03:10] Discerning the life of people in the
[1:03:13] scripture how many times do we have
[1:03:15] where he comes with Samuel he says you
[1:03:16] are an Israelite in whom there is no
[1:03:18] guile and he says when did you know me
[1:03:20] he says oh well before you came to the
[1:03:23] meeting when you're out behind that tree
[1:03:24] I saw you praying
[1:03:26] he says you're the son of God he
[1:03:29] recognized immediately with one
[1:03:31] Vindication one discernment he
[1:03:33] recognized this is God
[1:03:36] and we have seven in a row right here
[1:03:39] and I don't know how many it comes out
[1:03:40] with Jesus recorded in the scriptures
[1:03:42] what's recorded we have Peter you know
[1:03:44] you are you're Simon the son of Jonas he
[1:03:46] knew him he knew his father different
[1:03:48] situations like that and those ones that
[1:03:50] seen that Vindication they said it's
[1:03:52] enough
[1:03:54] yeah
[1:03:55] now there's thousands upon thousands
[1:03:59] of vindications friends how much do you
[1:04:02] need
[1:04:04] how much do you need before you will
[1:04:06] just simply say I believe what that man
[1:04:10] was saying because it's not his message
[1:04:13] it was not his word it was the word of
[1:04:17] God a Vindicated word prophet
[1:04:22] now
[1:04:24] we have received a Vindicated word of
[1:04:28] supreme authority in this hour
[1:04:31] it is an absolute that Pillar of Fire
[1:04:34] is where that message came from this
[1:04:37] message is not the message of William
[1:04:39] random this message is the word logos
[1:04:42] that was expressed through a channel
[1:04:44] through a vessel and that vessel was so
[1:04:47] yielded to God that God was able to
[1:04:49] speak through him and this is not the
[1:04:51] words of a man this is the logos
[1:04:55] now what that means friends is that this
[1:04:58] message is the absolute for this message
[1:05:01] is Jesus Christ
[1:05:05] oh when you can recognize that not by
[1:05:08] intellect but down on the inside of the
[1:05:10] inside when you can recognize that then
[1:05:13] when you hear a word spoken by a prophet
[1:05:16] and regarding your life regarding the
[1:05:18] bride in this hour it puts such a faith
[1:05:20] in your heart because you know beyond a
[1:05:22] shadow of a doubt if he said that if he
[1:05:25] said that there would be a pure virtuous
[1:05:27] sinless Bride of the son of the Living
[1:05:28] God I don't care how it feels that I
[1:05:31] couldn't be that if the prophet of God
[1:05:32] said that then that is what I'm going to
[1:05:34] be if he said that my sins were forgiven
[1:05:37] and that I am justified it's the same as
[1:05:39] if I had never done it in the first
[1:05:41] place if that's what the prophet said
[1:05:43] then that's what I believe and I stand
[1:05:46] Justified when you recognize the
[1:05:48] authority of the word when you when you
[1:05:51] see the power of it then you just yield
[1:05:53] to it you surrender to it and as it
[1:05:56] speaks over your life you're not saying
[1:05:57] oh but I don't know how I could ever you
[1:06:00] were never in the equation to begin with
[1:06:02] which this is a covenant God swore by
[1:06:05] himself this is the Covenant he made I
[1:06:07] am going to have a bride there is going
[1:06:10] to be a bride she will be without Smart
[1:06:12] she will be without wrinkle now you just
[1:06:14] have to yield yourself surrender
[1:06:16] yourself to that Authority and let God
[1:06:19] come down
[1:06:20] and perform the supernatural
[1:06:27] surrender to that absolute
[1:06:30] now I I'll go through a couple of things
[1:06:33] real quick here
[1:06:34] uh when Birdman would be on that curtain
[1:06:36] of time he's seen those Saints who were
[1:06:38] there in that Dimension and they said
[1:06:40] Paul that there was going to be a
[1:06:41] judging of the word that was given and
[1:06:43] he says does Paul's group have to be
[1:06:46] judged they said yes he says well if his
[1:06:49] group goes in mine does too because I
[1:06:51] said everything that he said I preached
[1:06:54] the exact same gospel that he preached
[1:06:56] and the millions that were there
[1:06:58] screamed out were arresting on that
[1:07:01] there is a rest there is a peace that
[1:07:04] comes with knowing you're anchored in an
[1:07:07] absolute
[1:07:09] if you can recognize your day end its
[1:07:12] message there is a rest like no other
[1:07:16] you have an anchor you have a peace
[1:07:21] now they're resting on it over there
[1:07:23] and I'm resting on it here
[1:07:27] now
[1:07:29] at every age Satan has had great success
[1:07:32] in carrying out his threat anybody know
[1:07:34] what that threat was it was to exalt
[1:07:37] himself above the most high he would
[1:07:40] Ascend above the clouds and the Stars
[1:07:42] brother ramp says he has had marvelous
[1:07:45] success in carrying out his threats by
[1:07:48] the people letting him explain away in
[1:07:51] every age the value of God's promised
[1:07:54] word to that age
[1:07:57] so Satan is going to do everything he
[1:08:00] possibly can to keep you from valuing
[1:08:03] this message of the hour Satan's primary
[1:08:08] objective is to get you not to Value
[1:08:11] this
[1:08:15] all right
[1:08:17] and the objective and the goal of the
[1:08:20] ministry is to place this message in
[1:08:24] preeminence in the hearts of the people
[1:08:26] because then we will have Christ himself
[1:08:28] in preeminence in a body
[1:08:33] so Satan doesn't want that to happen
[1:08:35] he'll come up with every excuse
[1:08:37] everything every doubt trying to place a
[1:08:40] question mark in your heart to God's
[1:08:43] word which the prophet said when that
[1:08:44] question mark comes in your heart to
[1:08:46] God's word death
[1:08:48] sets in
[1:08:50] so it's a life and death matter friends
[1:08:52] it's a very serious question that we're
[1:08:55] putting forth tonight
[1:08:57] now many times people get stumbled
[1:09:00] because this message was brought in such
[1:09:02] a way that they just can't recognize
[1:09:05] that it was really God you know there
[1:09:08] was that man one time you know the story
[1:09:09] he was going to be killed and so the
[1:09:11] young man grabbed a went running and he
[1:09:14] found Abraham Lincoln he says sir would
[1:09:16] you just pardon my friend's gonna be
[1:09:18] shocking grabbed a piece of paper he
[1:09:20] tore it off he wrote pardoned Abraham
[1:09:21] Lincoln he sent it back and he went
[1:09:23] running back and he said here here I got
[1:09:25] it you're pardoned you're forgiven the
[1:09:27] case is settled
[1:09:30] and he looked at it and he said
[1:09:32] on that piece of paper
[1:09:35] I there's no way if this was really from
[1:09:38] God it would come this way it would have
[1:09:40] this matter it would have this form
[1:09:45] you know what happened to that young man
[1:09:47] he died
[1:09:49] but if he could have recognized that it
[1:09:51] had been signed by supreme authority if
[1:09:54] he could have recognize that it wasn't
[1:09:56] about the paper there was a word on
[1:09:58] there that gave him life and it had been
[1:10:00] signed by the highest Authority in the
[1:10:02] land Trends don't look at the paper
[1:10:04] don't look at how it's all torn up and
[1:10:06] rugged and just kind of a ragged way
[1:10:08] look at what the message actually tells
[1:10:11] you it is life and it has been signed by
[1:10:14] supreme authority
[1:10:17] God chose to send his message through an
[1:10:21] uneducated Kentucky hillbilly
[1:10:24] his choice he sent it by a man who said
[1:10:28] umpire Empire empire instead of umpire
[1:10:30] and God will apologized to the
[1:10:32] congregation he says I'm sorry he says
[1:10:34] you know my words my pronunciation's not
[1:10:36] very good he says you know but I think
[1:10:38] after now you don't understand to kind
[1:10:40] of take me for what I mean and not what
[1:10:42] I'm saying there and he says I'm not
[1:10:44] very educated but I make a truthful
[1:10:46] Noise unto the Lord
[1:10:48] can you say Amen
[1:10:51] you know another place here I'm gonna go
[1:10:53] through a couple of things
[1:10:54] um over in the fourth seal brother
[1:10:56] random is talking about the Elijah and
[1:10:58] he says oh it was 700 that we're
[1:11:00] faithful and in the scriptures you can
[1:11:01] go see with seven thousand and question
[1:11:03] after question came was that a spiritual
[1:11:05] number were you given this was this he's
[1:11:07] like oh she's like I'm sorry friends he
[1:11:09] says I was just trying to rush right
[1:11:11] through there and I I wasn't you know
[1:11:12] making every reference and and uh but
[1:11:16] you know I appreciate
[1:11:17] the ones who broke down you know was
[1:11:20] this a spiritual thing because they knew
[1:11:22] there was something about that man that
[1:11:23] what he said was really important and so
[1:11:26] when you see something that you think
[1:11:27] might have just been a misspoken word
[1:11:29] you watch real close because God might
[1:11:32] be trying to tell you something but he
[1:11:34] was he was like oh you know I'm sorry he
[1:11:36] says I was just you know going through
[1:11:38] there and now God could have gave us a
[1:11:40] message with that one misspoken word
[1:11:42] absolutely don't limit God he can do
[1:11:45] absolutely anything he could have gave
[1:11:46] us a message without one mispronounced
[1:11:48] word without one misspoken word
[1:11:51] he could have done that
[1:11:53] but he didn't
[1:11:56] now I believe God allowed the prophet to
[1:11:58] say such things to stumble anyone who
[1:12:01] tried to figure it out by a dogmatic
[1:12:03] human intellect
[1:12:05] he put things in there where if you get
[1:12:07] somebody that's just I'm gonna figure
[1:12:08] this out and I'm gonna I'm gonna get
[1:12:10] this and they'll sit there and be like
[1:12:11] well I did I don't know what to think
[1:12:13] now sure
[1:12:15] you see it never was made for geniuses
[1:12:18] it was made for believers
[1:12:24] you know one of my favorite mistakes
[1:12:26] brother random ever made that I just
[1:12:27] love so much is over there in the
[1:12:29] questions and answers on the seals
[1:12:31] and uh he's preaching there and they
[1:12:34] asked him a question and they said uh
[1:12:36] rep is Revelations verse five and nine
[1:12:38] is this the raptured Saints and he says
[1:12:40] oh no that's not the Saints he reads it
[1:12:43] real quick and he's trying to answer
[1:12:43] another question and then he just stops
[1:12:46] he says there's something wrong there's
[1:12:49] something wrong now and that's just all
[1:12:51] there is to it there's some things
[1:12:52] happened there's something that went
[1:12:54] wrong somewhere everybody feeling all
[1:12:57] right there's no sickness or nothing
[1:12:58] somebody says go read that you know
[1:13:00] first again he goes back and reads it
[1:13:03] and he says oh here it is here it is I
[1:13:06] was wrong on that see that was redeemed
[1:13:08] us and he sees how this was the Saints
[1:13:10] he says that's right now what do you
[1:13:12] think about that oh if the presence of
[1:13:15] the Holy Ghost isn't here what is
[1:13:17] he wouldn't let see I only read the
[1:13:20] first part of that verse and just just
[1:13:21] or something wrote here and I was trying
[1:13:23] to get through looking at that clock but
[1:13:25] you see him stop me on that Glory
[1:13:29] friend this message is perfect if there
[1:13:33] was anything there that might have
[1:13:34] actually stumbled a Believer God was
[1:13:36] standing there and he was like oh hold
[1:13:38] the holder There You Gotta Straighten
[1:13:39] that word out because it might stumble a
[1:13:41] genuine believer if there's something
[1:13:43] there that might stumble human intellect
[1:13:45] I think God's just like well just let
[1:13:46] him trip right over
[1:13:49] we have a perfect message we have a word
[1:13:52] of authority we have an absolute that
[1:13:54] God came down and God Vindicated again
[1:13:56] and again and again God will not
[1:13:59] vindicate a lie to be truth he won't do
[1:14:01] it and you know friends
[1:14:04] this is an awful big statement but if
[1:14:06] you can get in the way I'm saying it if
[1:14:08] God Vindicated a lie that would make it
[1:14:10] true
[1:14:11] but
[1:14:12] all right
[1:14:13] [Music]
[1:14:15] if God says something's right
[1:14:17] that just changed the rules friends
[1:14:22] so if you could prove to me
[1:14:25] I mean prove to me
[1:14:26] that the prophet was wrong
[1:14:29] I wouldn't care
[1:14:34] first of all I wouldn't believe you but
[1:14:36] you could prove it to me and I'd say I'm
[1:14:38] sorry but God said this was right
[1:14:42] I might not be able to explain it I know
[1:14:44] I can't explain it I might not be able
[1:14:46] to understand it all I might not be able
[1:14:47] to explain it all but God came down and
[1:14:50] backed this up and he put his seal of
[1:14:52] approval on it and if I'll follow this
[1:14:55] message it'll put me in a Rapture now
[1:14:57] whatever Theory you have I don't know
[1:14:58] where that's going but I know where this
[1:15:00] is going I'm sticking with this I know
[1:15:02] the destination
[1:15:05] we have a word of authority we have an
[1:15:09] absolute it's not perfect in its grammar
[1:15:14] never promised to be that way it's not
[1:15:16] perfect in its pronunciation
[1:15:18] but it's perfect in the word it is a
[1:15:22] perfect word message
[1:15:25] God could have sent a message with
[1:15:27] perfect grammar and perfect
[1:15:28] pronunciation
[1:15:29] but he didn't want you
[1:15:33] instead God wrapped up his word in
[1:15:36] swaddling clothes and he laid it in a
[1:15:38] Manger over top of a manure pile and the
[1:15:40] world
[1:15:41] couldn't see it
[1:15:43] and Jesus rejoiced and he says father I
[1:15:47] thank thee for you have hidden these
[1:15:49] things from the wise and The Prudent and
[1:15:51] the educated and all these smart people
[1:15:52] but you've revealed it
[1:15:55] to babes
[1:15:56] you've revealed it
[1:15:59] to these babe because it was right in
[1:16:02] your sight
[1:16:04] it's hidden to everyone but the believer
[1:16:08] and to the believer that's all they can
[1:16:11] see
[1:16:12] Jesus said you're blessed if you have
[1:16:14] ears to hear time and again he would
[1:16:16] give a parable he'd cry out he that has
[1:16:18] ears to hear Let Him hear that every
[1:16:21] Church age there is a message that's
[1:16:23] given at the end of that age he says to
[1:16:26] the angel of the church that's the
[1:16:27] messenger to that age and then at the
[1:16:29] end it says and he that happened ear to
[1:16:31] hear here let him hear the message of
[1:16:35] your hour
[1:16:37] yeah there's people that are critics of
[1:16:39] the word of God there's people that are
[1:16:40] critics of the Bible brother Branham he
[1:16:43] talks about how they not only the
[1:16:45] Catholics do it he says but the
[1:16:46] Protestants too sure they do they dice
[1:16:48] it and cut it and this is inspired and
[1:16:51] that's not this is to make it fit your
[1:16:53] petty doctrines
[1:16:56] that's where the problem is friends they
[1:16:57] try to cut the word of God to fit their
[1:16:59] little petty Doctrine they say oh well
[1:17:01] this sermon this one wasn't inspired and
[1:17:03] that one he used the wrong Greek and
[1:17:06] this one
[1:17:07] trying to fit your little petty Doctrine
[1:17:09] you do not alter the Garment to fit the
[1:17:12] man you don't alter the word of God you
[1:17:14] let the man be altered to fit the
[1:17:16] garments this wedding garment is perfect
[1:17:19] now if you find a place where it doesn't
[1:17:21] fit it's not a problem with the garments
[1:17:23] you just need to lose a little extra
[1:17:25] weight or something you need to alter
[1:17:27] yourself to fit that word
[1:17:30] they try to alter it to fit their Petty
[1:17:33] doctrines brother every word of it's
[1:17:35] inspired every word of it's just as good
[1:17:38] today as it was the day that Jesus
[1:17:39] sealed the book there with his blood at
[1:17:41] Calvary every promise is yea and amen to
[1:17:45] the believer
[1:17:47] I'm not gonna read all of it but he
[1:17:49] shows where somebody was taking his
[1:17:50] tapes they play a little sentence and
[1:17:52] then they'd stop it and make him say
[1:17:54] something he didn't say
[1:17:55] he says he says now go back and play
[1:17:57] your tape he says you know that's not
[1:17:59] what I was saying he says he says uh
[1:18:01] there he says anybody knows I said that
[1:18:04] play your tape now he says whosoever
[1:18:06] shall take from it or add to it the same
[1:18:08] shall be taken from it from him it's the
[1:18:10] word of the Lord it stands that way
[1:18:14] what you just said there is that my
[1:18:17] message that I'm preaching to you it's
[1:18:18] the word of the Lord if you take one
[1:18:20] thing away from it if you add something
[1:18:22] to it then you have the same curse
[1:18:24] that's in the Book of Revelations from
[1:18:26] taking away or adding to it he says it's
[1:18:28] the word of the Lord it stands that way
[1:18:31] kind of sounds like Paul doesn't it
[1:18:35] now
[1:18:38] well we're just going to keep on going
[1:18:39] here everybody just stand up shake hands
[1:18:41] with somebody next to you make sure
[1:18:42] they're awake and we'll go a couple more
[1:18:43] minutes

[1:18:47] wake him up shake hands with your
[1:18:49] neighbor we got a couple more minutes

[1:19:25] sober man there's no black white bird
[1:19:28] it's one or the other
[1:19:30] now we have received a message that
[1:19:33] stands Vindicated by supreme authority
[1:19:35] brother man I'm here in the church
[1:19:37] agency says who then will have the power
[1:19:39] of infallibility which is to be restored
[1:19:41] in the last stage for this last stage is
[1:19:44] going back to manifesting the pure word
[1:19:47] bride okay now to have a pure word
[1:19:50] pure word bride you have to have a pure
[1:19:53] word to have a pure word you have to
[1:19:55] have a word profit
[1:19:57] who's going to go back to manifesting
[1:19:59] this pure word bride he says he says
[1:20:01] that means we will have the word once
[1:20:03] again as it was perfectly given and
[1:20:05] perfectly understood in the days of Paul
[1:20:06] I will tell you who will have it it will
[1:20:09] be a prophet as surely Vindicated or
[1:20:12] even more thoroughly Vindicated than any
[1:20:14] prophet in all the ages from Enoch to
[1:20:16] this day
[1:20:18] have the Capstone prophetic Ministry
[1:20:20] now this ministry has been Vindicated
[1:20:23] friends Vindicated means proved to be
[1:20:26] right
[1:20:27] all right prove to be true Vindicated we
[1:20:30] have scriptural Vindication by we could
[1:20:33] probably go into the hundreds of
[1:20:34] scriptural vindications for this last
[1:20:36] day Ministry we have the sign of of the
[1:20:40] son of man revealing himself the
[1:20:41] discernment we have that lining up
[1:20:43] thousands of times never one time was it
[1:20:46] ever proved to be wrong
[1:20:48] it was right 100 of the time
[1:20:51] and on top of that it lines up with the
[1:20:54] word of God every job until
[1:20:57] we have a Vindicated word that's been
[1:20:59] given us in this day
[1:21:01] now if you lived in a day gone by and
[1:21:04] and you came up and you said well I see
[1:21:07] what you're doing here you know Mr Noah
[1:21:09] it looks real nice but you know I've
[1:21:11] offered the lamb like Abel and Seth told
[1:21:13] me to offer it I have it offered and I
[1:21:15] really don't want to get in your boat Mr
[1:21:16] Noah
[1:21:20] is there anything wrong with the
[1:21:22] sacrifice
[1:21:23] nope
[1:21:25] but if you didn't get out of your
[1:21:26] message for that hour
[1:21:28] you died
[1:21:30] if you didn't listen to what that crazy
[1:21:32] man up on the hill was saying pounding
[1:21:35] away on that Ark for 120 years
[1:21:37] he died
[1:21:42] because well you know Mr Noah I see what
[1:21:44] you're doing here but I'm gonna my own
[1:21:46] vote there was other boats friends
[1:21:48] Robin told us everyone's like
[1:21:51] there was other boats out there
[1:21:54] there was other ideas they had on this
[1:21:57] but you either got under the message of
[1:22:00] that hour and you got in the boat the
[1:22:02] way Noah told you to get into the boat
[1:22:03] or you died
[1:22:05] you come down to to a little bit later
[1:22:08] and this man stands there and he says
[1:22:10] listen I am a son of Abraham
[1:22:12] I have been circumcised I'm a true son
[1:22:15] of Abraham I am under a promise of God I
[1:22:17] have the Covenant of God and I have a
[1:22:19] slam slain here just like we've been
[1:22:21] doing for hundreds of years
[1:22:24] that's wonderful that's wonderful but
[1:22:26] the message said you got to take and
[1:22:28] smear blood all over your door did you
[1:22:30] do it or not
[1:22:33] if you didn't follow the message for
[1:22:36] that hour it was death coming into your
[1:22:38] home friends and if in this hour you try
[1:22:40] to deviate from this message you say
[1:22:42] well I know it says that but I'm gonna
[1:22:44] do this you know I think I'm I've been
[1:22:46] baptized I'm good enough I've done this
[1:22:48] no no friends if you eat you either come
[1:22:50] under the message for your hour you
[1:22:52] either obey what the message says or
[1:22:54] it's this
[1:22:57] exactly right
[1:23:00] I don't care how much you had a slain
[1:23:02] lamp there was nothing wrong with the
[1:23:03] lamp friends the lamb was the right
[1:23:05] sacrifice it was good
[1:23:07] but without being under that message for
[1:23:10] that hour and following the word for
[1:23:12] your day it was death
[1:23:17] we're not supposed to come together to
[1:23:18] talk about the message we're to come
[1:23:20] together to get in the message and the
[1:23:23] message is Christ he's the word and
[1:23:25] we're to get in it get beneath it I like
[1:23:28] how he says it we're to get into it get
[1:23:31] beneath it
[1:23:33] we got to be underneath that word
[1:23:35] outside of that it's death
[1:23:39] now we can take this into the indictment
[1:23:41] which we're not going to where they
[1:23:43] would been sacrificing that lamb for
[1:23:44] thousands of years and it was a right
[1:23:46] sacrifice and it was good but then one
[1:23:48] day you could have been standing there
[1:23:50] you could have told them
[1:23:52] you know listen here in the temple we
[1:23:54] see what you're doing you have the
[1:23:55] sacrifice but I want to show you
[1:23:56] something you look out that window you
[1:23:58] see that man out there that naked man
[1:24:00] that's beaten beyond recognition
[1:24:03] that's dying as a criminal
[1:24:06] well
[1:24:07] you can offer 10 000 lamps but unless
[1:24:09] you accept his blood it'll never touch
[1:24:11] your life
[1:24:18] longer effective it was no longer what
[1:24:21] they needed it was a changing of
[1:24:23] dispensations and at that change of the
[1:24:25] dispensations you had to recognize that
[1:24:27] lamb that worked for you yesterday now
[1:24:29] you've come under another hour and you
[1:24:31] must get under that blood or you perish
[1:24:35] you must recognize the message for your
[1:24:38] hour
[1:24:40] it was the Fulfillment of every
[1:24:42] sacrifice that had made for thousands of
[1:24:45] years from Abel's lamb onward it was the
[1:24:47] Fulfillment of everything represented
[1:24:49] there on that cross and if they didn't
[1:24:51] recognize that
[1:24:52] it was death
[1:24:55] you must recognize
[1:24:58] where you're at
[1:25:00] Ram in recognizing your day and his
[1:25:02] message
[1:25:03] talking about that he says but did he
[1:25:05] realize speaking of the high priest but
[1:25:07] did he realize the real truth of it that
[1:25:10] he was sacrificing the very God that he
[1:25:12] claimed to be a high priest of
[1:25:14] thank you
[1:25:17] in the indictment brother random shows
[1:25:19] us how that as they crucified this
[1:25:21] message of the hour when they reject
[1:25:23] this message that was when Christ was
[1:25:25] crucified afresh and at that time he
[1:25:28] says it was a changing of dispensations
[1:25:29] and it was going from where a
[1:25:31] denominational religious Jesus which was
[1:25:34] enough for down through those Dark Ages
[1:25:37] it was enough to to go under that that
[1:25:39] denominational religious system like
[1:25:41] Martin Luther and the different ones it
[1:25:43] was enough in that hour he says but then
[1:25:45] at this second crucifixion of Christ in
[1:25:47] this indictment he says now he says from
[1:25:49] this time it's the word and the word
[1:25:52] only and then he says these words he
[1:25:54] says and that's just recently come into
[1:25:57] effect
[1:25:58] now for them that's a judgment but for
[1:26:01] us friends that means everything's
[1:26:04] available it's the word and the word
[1:26:06] only and it's all coming to effect right
[1:26:08] now and at this hour it's the
[1:26:10] manifestation of the sons of God in this
[1:26:13] hour it's the Redemption of the
[1:26:14] purchased possession right now is when
[1:26:16] men and women can walk around on this
[1:26:18] Earth as godmen
[1:26:22] it's the word now and it's in full
[1:26:24] effect the whole thing Martin Luther
[1:26:26] didn't have that friends John Wesley
[1:26:28] didn't have that but this bride has that
[1:26:30] and she will be flesh of his flesh and
[1:26:32] bone of his bone word of his word life
[1:26:34] of his life Spirit of his Spirit she is
[1:26:38] him
[1:26:42] thank you
[1:26:43] now
[1:26:46] Branham in in uh I won't read it all
[1:26:49] here but if you go and you listen to
[1:26:50] that anointed ones at the end time
[1:26:52] he says you know you might have been
[1:26:54] thinking I was trying to build up myself
[1:26:55] or talk about myself and he says I'm not
[1:26:57] doing that he says this isn't me that
[1:26:59] I'm talking about because he's talking
[1:27:00] about his message and what he was saying
[1:27:02] and it sounded like he was lifting
[1:27:03] himself up kind of like the criticized
[1:27:05] Moses and he says no no it wasn't me he
[1:27:08] says I wasn't the one that appeared down
[1:27:09] on the river I was only standing there
[1:27:11] when he appeared I'm not the one that
[1:27:13] performs these things and foretells
[1:27:15] these things that happens as perfect as
[1:27:17] they are I'm only one that's near when
[1:27:19] he does it I was only a voice that he
[1:27:21] used to say it it wasn't me what I knew
[1:27:24] it's what I just surrendered myself to
[1:27:28] you don't have to understand everything
[1:27:30] in this message but you gotta surrender
[1:27:32] yourself to it it's not how much you
[1:27:34] know it's not how much knowledge you
[1:27:36] have it's what you're surrendering
[1:27:38] yourself to
[1:27:40] says he spoke through him and he goes on
[1:27:42] showing how what it was and then he
[1:27:44] makes these statement is so powerful he
[1:27:47] says the son of man his he says he says
[1:27:51] you are feeding on the unfailing body
[1:27:54] word of the son of man
[1:27:57] this message is the body word of the son
[1:28:00] of man
[1:28:02] defeat on this is power to feed on this
[1:28:05] is rapturing Faith to feed on this
[1:28:09] is overcoming in this hour
[1:28:11] so surrender yourself to this message
[1:28:14] Surrender Your Life to this message
[1:28:16] surrender your thinking let it guide
[1:28:17] every decision in your home let it guide
[1:28:20] everything you do in your life and if
[1:28:22] the message says something don't argue
[1:28:25] with it don't try and cut it to fit your
[1:28:27] little petty Doctrine If the message
[1:28:28] preaches against mascara and fingernail
[1:28:30] polish end of discussion
[1:28:33] that's it you don't need to know anymore
[1:28:37] if if you if you decide well you know
[1:28:39] what I'm just going to stay home from
[1:28:41] church and read my Bible you're sinning
[1:28:46] the Bible says not forsaking the
[1:28:49] assembling of yourselves together as the
[1:28:51] manner of some is
[1:28:53] and that much more as you see the day
[1:28:55] approaching brother Branham says that
[1:28:57] means going to church
[1:29:00] so you know streaming that's nice but if
[1:29:04] you stay home in your pajamas because
[1:29:05] you don't want to go to church
[1:29:07] you're sinning
[1:29:08] the assembling of yourselves together is
[1:29:11] very important because you're going to
[1:29:13] be in fellowship with people who annoy
[1:29:15] you and that's wonderful for your
[1:29:17] character
[1:29:18] all right that's another sermon we'll
[1:29:20] keep moving
[1:29:21] now you need to surrender yourself to
[1:29:24] this message with full sincerity
[1:29:26] everything that you are saying God
[1:29:28] whatever you say whatever you lead
[1:29:30] however you show me that's how I want to
[1:29:33] live my life I want to be living I want
[1:29:35] to be clothed in the word I want you to
[1:29:38] be saturated in the word I want every
[1:29:40] fiber of my being to be the word
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:44] brother Graham says God hates a
[1:29:46] powerless religion it's got to have
[1:29:48] power it's got to have sincerity
[1:29:51] sincerity brings power now sincerity is
[1:29:54] wholehearted everything that's in you
[1:29:57] not a half-hearted Christianity not a
[1:29:59] halfway following this message sincerity
[1:30:01] brings power sincerity brings real
[1:30:04] worship not forms but genuine power
[1:30:08] worship oh doesn't that sound good
[1:30:11] friends genuine power worship to know
[1:30:14] that you pass from Death unto life God
[1:30:16] wants to perform his word by his power
[1:30:19] and when the church denies his power how
[1:30:21] can he perform and vindicate his word
[1:30:24] God wants to vindicate his work he wants
[1:30:27] to prove in your life you come and you
[1:30:29] stand on a promise of God and you put
[1:30:31] God on the test you say God I can see
[1:30:33] where your Prophet said this I can see
[1:30:35] where the word says is now I'm going to
[1:30:37] stand on that with everything I have and
[1:30:39] God's longing for somebody to do that he
[1:30:41] wants to come down in power and
[1:30:43] vindicate his word
[1:30:46] so stand on it
[1:30:48] bring God on the scene call on his name
[1:30:51] say you made a promise you made you said
[1:30:54] this in your word and I'm gonna stand on
[1:30:56] that because I want to see my God come
[1:30:58] down and Ash
[1:31:01] and we'll just run back down here to
[1:31:02] Jericho and wrap up the service
[1:31:05] but you know Joshua was there at Jericho
[1:31:08] and those walls was big and then walls
[1:31:10] was thick and Joshua knew everything
[1:31:11] about building walls because he did a
[1:31:14] lot of them down in Egypt and he knew
[1:31:16] how ridiculous this idea was to walk
[1:31:19] around in circles
[1:31:22] to take down a wall
[1:31:24] I mean he built walls and he'd seen
[1:31:26] walls and he probably never seen one
[1:31:27] that was this big he probably had to do
[1:31:30] some demo work and tear down a few walls
[1:31:32] and here he is and he meets with the
[1:31:34] supreme authority and that Authority
[1:31:36] says walk around in circles
[1:31:40] so
[1:31:41] they walked around in circles
[1:31:49] yeah I'm just going to do it here I like
[1:31:50] to do object lessons so you just bear
[1:31:52] with me Wesley come here but Daniel
[1:31:54] you didn't yeah come here
[1:31:56] what's up come here
[1:31:58] um do we have a couple of you how about
[1:32:01] you and well let's grab you yeah sure
[1:32:03] all right this is me very simple this
[1:32:05] isn't complicated okay
[1:32:07] I want you to all line up in a row
[1:32:10] I want you to walk around in circles
[1:32:11] around the building go ahead that way go
[1:32:14] ahead
[1:32:16] you guys feel silly yet
[1:32:20] you know and this is a church that
[1:32:22] actually knows where the story is going
[1:32:23] but he knows what happens feeling a
[1:32:26] little bit funny a little bit goofy a
[1:32:27] little bit awkward okay what about what
[1:32:30] about those those children of Israel
[1:32:32] that they're there they're marching
[1:32:34] around in circles and the people in
[1:32:35] Derek who are laughing at them they're
[1:32:37] mocking him like do you have any
[1:32:39] military plans where is your catapults
[1:32:41] where's your battering rams what's your
[1:32:43] military strategy you're just gonna walk
[1:32:45] in circles is that all you got
[1:32:48] can you imagine being the children of
[1:32:50] Israel how embarrassed they were to get
[1:32:52] up day after day after day and do the
[1:32:56] same thing and hear the same jokes and
[1:32:58] the same mockery but come on is this all
[1:33:00] you're gonna do you think we're scared
[1:33:02] of you you're just gonna walk in circles
[1:33:04] and tell what we get dizzy
[1:33:07] don't tell me they weren't embarrassed
[1:33:09] to try and stand on the word for their
[1:33:11] hour oh sure they were
[1:33:13] but they did it
[1:33:16] you know why would they listen to Joshua
[1:33:18] anyway
[1:33:19] well you know they just seen him
[1:33:21] Vindicated the same way Moses was
[1:33:23] because he said you start walking
[1:33:25] towards that water and when they walk
[1:33:26] towards that water the Jordan River just
[1:33:29] parted into and they crossed right over
[1:33:31] France if the word says walk then walk
[1:33:34] whatever it says you just do it if it
[1:33:36] says to walk you walk if it says that by
[1:33:39] his stripes you're healed then that
[1:33:40] settles the question if he says testify
[1:33:43] of your healing and testify of your
[1:33:44] healing whatever the word says you do it
[1:33:47] I don't care how ridiculous it is
[1:33:49] I don't want to go to church I'm going
[1:33:51] to sit next to that guy that's got body
[1:33:52] odor
[1:33:54] hey
[1:33:55] sorry that's what we're doing you know
[1:33:57] that guy that was in front of me in line
[1:33:59] he kept kicking me and he kept stirring
[1:34:01] up dust and it was getting in my nose I
[1:34:02] don't want to do this again no we're
[1:34:04] going again the Bible Joshua said we're
[1:34:06] going to do it again and we're going to
[1:34:08] do it again today friends just keep
[1:34:10] doing it keep living that simple humble
[1:34:12] Christian Life just keep standing on the
[1:34:14] word keep confessing his promises keep
[1:34:17] confessing that what God Said is the
[1:34:19] truth you boys I'm not gonna make you 13
[1:34:22] times you can find your seats now
[1:34:25] they did this again and again they were
[1:34:27] so embarrassed they were so ashamed to
[1:34:29] be like yeah that's that's our leader
[1:34:32] there that's the one we're following
[1:34:34] that's our military captain and his plan
[1:34:37] is to walk around in circles
[1:34:40] but the word said to do it and they did
[1:34:42] it and you know what happened
[1:34:44] when they followed that word and they
[1:34:46] did it every way exactly the way God
[1:34:49] said do it and they'd March around that
[1:34:50] wall seven times on that last day when
[1:34:53] they got to that last time then God came
[1:34:55] down and Vindicated the word he gave to
[1:34:57] his prophet and those walls of Jericho
[1:35:00] Came Crashing to the ground The
[1:35:01] Impossible became a reality when they
[1:35:05] obeyed God's word to the letter and they
[1:35:08] just did what God Said do it didn't feel
[1:35:10] very exciting friends many times going
[1:35:12] to church it doesn't
[1:35:14] it didn't feel very glorious or very
[1:35:17] military or proud or whatever they
[1:35:19] wanted
[1:35:20] that's what God Said do and God came
[1:35:23] down and Vindicated
[1:35:25] his message to them but you're gonna
[1:35:27] have times when you go through those dry
[1:35:29] spells when you're just Marching In
[1:35:30] Circles here we go again here we go
[1:35:33] again just keep walking
[1:35:35] the word said walk can you walk
[1:35:38] Bram says this he says look at Joshua
[1:35:41] before one rock came down out of the
[1:35:44] walls of Jericho Joshua walked around
[1:35:45] the walls shouting the victory for by
[1:35:48] faith he saw the victory he knowed the
[1:35:50] walls were coming down and he armed his
[1:35:52] man and walked around and around and
[1:35:55] around Jericho for seven days in full
[1:35:57] armor what doing because he was looking
[1:36:00] at the Unseen it was a promise a God
[1:36:02] made how much can you walk around a
[1:36:06] wheelchair how much can you walk around
[1:36:09] the cancer how much can you walk around
[1:36:11] sin shouting the victory that God gives
[1:36:14] the promise when you can see him who is
[1:36:17] invisible when that pulsation come down
[1:36:19] in your heart begins to pull say I'm the
[1:36:21] Lord who heals all thy diseases when you
[1:36:24] can see that everything else weakens
[1:36:26] away Joshua looked at the Unseen and he
[1:36:29] walked around the walls of Jericho
[1:36:31] believing it would happen it all depends
[1:36:34] on what you're looking at so friends Set
[1:36:36] Your Eyes Upon an absolute Set Your Eyes
[1:36:39] Upon what the word of God has said in
[1:36:41] this hour and follow it whatever it says
[1:36:44] you do that if you see Joshua's marching
[1:36:46] in this way if you see the prophets
[1:36:48] going that way then getting stepped
[1:36:49] behind him follow her right in line with
[1:36:51] him because he got his marching orders
[1:36:53] from the captain of the host of the Lord
[1:36:59] the musicians would come tonight
[1:37:02] hey
[1:37:04] just to stand to our feet
[1:37:07] we're following a Vindicated message
[1:37:09] we're following a word of authority it
[1:37:12] is the absolute for it's not the words
[1:37:14] of a man it's the unfailing body word of
[1:37:18] the son of man
[1:37:19] you want victory in your life
[1:37:22] surrender to this message
[1:37:23] you want to see God come down in power
[1:37:26] you just do what the word says do and
[1:37:29] you see if God doesn't come down and
[1:37:30] vindicate it
[1:37:33] amen we were at the Youth Camp there in
[1:37:36] Ohio just a couple a week ago or so and
[1:37:40] one little thing the Lord just dropped
[1:37:42] in my heart and the services for me
[1:37:43] personally
[1:37:45] and because you know as a minister I
[1:37:48] want I want to be used of God I want God
[1:37:51] to use me and I want to do things that
[1:37:53] will help people but I can't do it
[1:37:55] myself I'd love to but I can't but I
[1:37:59] want to see God use me to help people
[1:38:02] and so I I'm like okay I guess I have to
[1:38:06] pray three hours every day and then I'll
[1:38:08] be dedicated enough that God can use me
[1:38:10] and prayer is wonderful and I need to do
[1:38:12] it more
[1:38:13] you all do it's one thing you can't do
[1:38:16] too much of
[1:38:18] I'll get in my mind it's kind of a
[1:38:19] complex if I can just be dedicated
[1:38:21] enough then God can use me if I can just
[1:38:23] and I built up this this mindset
[1:38:27] and those things are good and I need
[1:38:29] more dedication certainly
[1:38:32] but
[1:38:33] what God spoke to my heart they were
[1:38:36] talking about Samson the brother was
[1:38:37] preaching there about Samson and
[1:38:39] and I just realized here's Samson in
[1:38:42] Gaza he's sleeping with a harlot he
[1:38:46] wakes up in the middle of the night
[1:38:47] walks out of her house goes to the city
[1:38:49] Gates and a miracle takes place
[1:38:53] and I'm just like that don't work in my
[1:38:55] own mathematics like he'd have to have a
[1:38:57] five hour prayer meeting before he could
[1:38:59] even do anything
[1:39:02] and the little thing the Lord drops into
[1:39:04] my heart was
[1:39:06] it's
[1:39:08] not what you achieve
[1:39:10] it's what you surrender yourself to
[1:39:13] seen Sampson had one thing that was
[1:39:16] surrendered to God
[1:39:17] that was his strength and God could use
[1:39:20] Samson's strength to do things that no
[1:39:23] man could do
[1:39:26] and if we can just surrender ourselves
[1:39:30] what an achievement it's a surrendering
[1:39:33] if we can just surrender ourselves to
[1:39:35] God God can come down and do things that
[1:39:38] no man could do
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:43] let us surrender ourselves
[1:39:47] Jesus Christ the manifested word in this
[1:39:52] hour
[1:39:53] and let him do things in our life
[1:39:56] that we could never do
[1:39:59] let him have preeminence
