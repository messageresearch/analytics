amen Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 11. Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 11 and we'll read down through verse 22 and take our text by the help of the Lord it's been an honor and privilege to be here verse 11. Ephesians chapter 2. it says wherefore remember that ye being in times past Gentiles In the Flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision is the flesh made by hands but at that time that at that time you were without Christ being anywhere aliens from Commonwealth of Israel Israel strangers from the Covenant of Promise having no hope and without God in the world Hallelujah but now in Christ Jesus you were sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who have broken down both one and that thought who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall a partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in the ordinances for to make him himself Twain one new man so make making peace that he might reconcile both unto God one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby through and through him we both have access by one Spirit under the father now therefore you're no more strangers and former foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and to build upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly formed fanned together growth unto the Holy Temple and Lord in whom you all sort of build it together for habitation of God through the spirit you may have your seats tonight just want to take a thought if I might uh from verse 14 there I want to talk on walls walls you know it's what is a wall something that holds you back you can't go through that wall right there there's something there's a berry I want to talk on walls to no and talk about what the Lord Jesus is doing for us and what he's already done for that's why he gave you the Holy Ghost that's why he gave so that you could have fellowship with him it doesn't matter what say it like this he says he says God Longs he said God Longs from fellowship he earns he wants people to speak with him he wants people to speak with him to talk with him now so many times we think we got to talk to God in such a manner I'm going to get right on your face here now you talk to God in such a highly manner you think God is so big but if you look in God in Simplicity God was so simple that he would come down and get in flesh so that he could understand what it's like to have a toothache he can understand what it's like to have a headache he can understand what it's like to have a complex he can understand what it's like to have somebody fighting against you he can understand what it's like to have Birds he can understand what it's like to have mental battles he can understand exactly where you're at tonight and he knows exactly what you have need of tonight but you've got to talk to him

my mistakes and all my failures yeah he just wants to talk it over with you that's why he stands at the door and Knocks he will come in and sup with him he wants that kind of fellowship with you not just as a that is a god telling his people but he wants it as a husband and a wife he wants an intimacy with you he wants a friendship with you you know my best friend sits right there that's my what that's my best friend I can tell her that we can talk and we pray together and we Oh Glory God wants that with his blood he Longs for that as God wouldn't make everything and Adam would come down through named that animal an animal named not animal and I'm looking and God saw it and he said it's not it's not good that man should live alone and therefore he put Adam to sleep the first anesthesia okay yes there was and the first surgery there was and God still performance surgery and God's still helping you God's giving you rest when you don't think you fellowship with you he wants you to talk it over with him I'm talking he's a person there's a reality to this God it's not just the god of do's and don'ts come on I grew up in a message Church I grew up there was a time I got to do this and I got to do that now I got to do this and I got to do that you know what I'm missing you missing the whole key of the Bible this is a love letter it's a love relationship and God is love

the wrong preacher my life's doing something I'll do everything I can to try to get it for why because I want to express that I love her every way that I can I'm not saying you give her everything I'm not saying that honey don't get the idea don't even say I preached it but if you think the way of our Heavenly husband loves us he wants to bless you more than you can want to be blessed mother made him would talk about a four foot pool uh um pipe and he said if you put the whole lotion in there he said and you put you put the whole ocean in there and you push it through that pipe that's how much God wants to bless you tonight you know Jeremy Lord how many know Jeremy Lord Jeremy law is an analytical he's an engineer he said you know I I figured it up I'm like really because yeah they estimated how much water there is and the pipe he said it will cut you in half that's how much God wants to bless you on this Sunday night that's how much he wants to bless you with the Holy Ghost that's how much he wants to speak to you about the word that's how much he wants to come right down the street and the Indiana boy and there's nothing about your life we'll walk right down into your heart and begin to speak to you why because I'm muted to him and I want him to speak his word through me to you that you may know God loves you and he wants to have that kind of Fellowship no matter where you're at no matter how far down you are God is here tonight to continue to speak your word well praise God he said you'll never be able to have too much fellowship with God God Longs for his creatures he created him in his image for the fellowship how do you know that brother Matt what do you do in the Garden of Eden he came down how many is going back to an eating condition how many minutes how many beliefs we're entering into an easy condition now how many beliefs with the baptism the Holy Ghost there's no barriers there's no walls how do you know that brother Matt there was a curtain that stood before it knowing that that cross said when he died on that cross of Calvary it was lit from the top to the bottom that now you and I can enter into the holy some holies and when you enter into the holy supposes things begin to change how do you know that there was a rod of dead a dead stick stuck in the presence of the Shekinah Glory yeah it was there for 24 hours and it budded and brought forth fruit you end up being fought fruit get in the Press of God and begin to fellowship with him yeah not just with your neighbor fellowship with God and God alone that's something to you nothing brother Tommy the man himself would say I go hunting he goes well let me take a little secret I'm not always hunting because I'm getting a little over gorgeous come on I know we live in a busy world I got three kids sitting back down I work a full-time job I'm Minister all the time I know how busy it is but let me tell you how important it is for you to have fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ you want to have an overcoming life you want God The Sinner come on man come on I'm talking about the rubber meets the road that we're able to live this life on a day-to-day basis it revolves around getting in fellowship with the Lord Jesus good brother man I prayed and God didn't answer God's testing your faith remember I didn't get what I wanted this morning God's testing your faith there was an unjust shot one time I'm still here Lord I'm still here Lord come on ain't going nowhere I ain't backing up listen hmm God wants to have Fellowship come on now God wants you to have fellowship with one another too he wants you to have Fellowship one one another how many's ever had strength from my brother pull it beside you pull up beside you and you don't even know what you're struggling about he said man I was reading the mess the other day you know what God Said and he goes do this God don't even know what he's saying he just spoke right to my knee it's called Fellowship what are you fellowshipping around we can know every baseball stat well Glory we're preaching anyway even though ESPN front to back you know Fox News all about it you can Fellowship on that but let me ask you is there any Eternal value from that because there are two on the way to Emmaus and they were fellowshipping around the word of the Lord they were Fellowship around the message of the hour glory to God that are fellowshipping around what was happening right there amen and what happened they didn't even recognize the one that they were talking about was right there walking amongst them get the fellowship around God and the presence of God will rot right now they need a fellowship and he'll begin to show you I'm here with you I was there in Genesis I was there in Exodus I was there with Matthew I'm here with you thank you Glory [Applause] Hallelujah he's here tonight and he wants to fellowship with you he cares about you young people he cares where you're at he cares about your problems he cares about your failures foreign you know what I'm going to expose some walls here in just a minute come on now listen we got a good adversary you know who he is he's a liar he's nothing but a devil come on but he's a liar how many likes a liar or whatever I do work for you and he lies to you does he do work again [Laughter] no you have somebody work on their car on your car and they say they're gonna fix it and you give them 500 and they don't fix it and they said they fixed it okay no big deal if we would do that in the natural now let's discern who it is that's building these walls for us you know what the devil wants to do he always wants to bust down your fellowship he doesn't want you to have Fellowship around the word of God he doesn't want you to have Fellowship without King Almighty because he knows when God's people home Glory get together with him things begin to change and they come out of those meetings and they look me right in the face shakes me because they've got a look of fire the same look of fire that Jesus had Satan has lied to you he's lied to you he's lied to you he's lied to you and you don't have to sit there and stink and take it I'll give you I'll give you an example the reason this is so passionate to me for like three or four years I felt like I'd done something wrong haven't you ever been there like feel like you just you love the Lord you come to church you want to do you want something but you just can't get there amen buddy not making fun of you I know because I've been there and I know I'm not the only one that's been there so many times we come to church and man we I need something so bad but I don't even know how to get what do I need to do can I show you take your hands off how'd Moses win a victory and when he couldn't lift him up when he cuts are in there there were brothers that came alongside and prayed for him Hallelujah her brothers that came alongside when he got weak oh Hallelujah but every time his hands were up there was victory in the camp Glory let it be a lesson to you you know how Jesus won the victory he didn't fight him when he gave his hands he stuck his hands up on the cross Saturday and he raised his hand and said father forgive them [Music] Hallelujah Satan's an absolute liar I want to read these listen he comes to church so he might be sitting right there I don't know I'm gonna put him over here on this empty one cause nobody wants to get back to him you're all right kids he's over here in the corner well you know what I'm about to say listen first of all you're bound stay right there and shut your mouth is that the word I know he wants to get in everybody's ear and try to Rob them of the fellowship that God wants to have for him but I'm here as a messenger as I'm not a messenger I'm here as a Son of God a soldier of the Cross and I'm here to exert my authority and my right over Satan and by the way Satan you lost it calvary you lose at the end of the book and you lost your battle with me because I'm still here I'm still here tonight you couldn't hold me away he couldn't bring you down yeah can't win so I'm here to identify Satan you've lied and you're nothing he's a good liar now he'll use the word he will try to throw quotes at you well Glory how do you know that my man he said it's right Jesus said it's written and he said is written back he tries to misplace the word of God and he tries to place it over your life it'll make you feel guilty make you feel like you got no hope but I'm here to expose the LIE of Satan there's hope there's Faith there's Grace there's a power of the Holy Ghost still identified in the Church of the Living God by the way he's the most faithful person you've got come to this church are you crazy you believe there's a real Dave I believe there's a real devil but I believe there's a power that's stronger than any devil and by the way that's true fifth devil has already lost the battle he has no
