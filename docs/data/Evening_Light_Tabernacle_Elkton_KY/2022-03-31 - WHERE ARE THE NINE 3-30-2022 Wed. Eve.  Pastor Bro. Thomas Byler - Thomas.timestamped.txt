[1:02:43] selves
[1:02:44] covetous
[1:02:45] boasters proud
[1:02:47] blasphemers disobedient appearance
[1:02:50] unthankful and unholy without natural
[1:02:52] affection
[1:02:54] truce breakers
[1:02:56] false accusers incontinent fierce
[1:02:59] despisers of those that are good
[1:03:02] traitors haiti high-minded lovers of
[1:03:03] pleasure more than lovers of god
[1:03:06] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:03:09] the power thereof from such turn away
[1:03:12] may god had his blessings to reading the
[1:03:13] word you can be seated tonight
[1:03:17] i want to focus on
[1:03:19] tonight i want to focus on appreciation
[1:03:22] or
[1:03:23] thankfulness amen
[1:03:25] thankfulness you know sometimes i
[1:03:27] believe brother brahm says you know
[1:03:28] sometimes when we pray you know we're
[1:03:30] always asking god will you go do this
[1:03:32] will you do that and we just kind of
[1:03:34] make god our errand boy
[1:03:36] how many knows god is so much more than
[1:03:38] an aaron boy amen
[1:03:40] amen and so we should come before him
[1:03:43] with thanksgiving and appreciation
[1:03:46] amen and when i think about the age in
[1:03:48] which we're living in ii timothy
[1:03:50] describes it pretty good
[1:03:52] along with revelations 3 of course where
[1:03:54] it talks about amen they say that
[1:03:56] they're rich and increased with goods
[1:03:58] and have need of nothing
[1:04:00] and so we find these people that uh our
[1:04:03] lovers of pleasure and covetous and all
[1:04:06] of this you know and the rich they're
[1:04:08] increased with goods we find out that
[1:04:09] these people are actually
[1:04:11] quite miserable amen
[1:04:13] and not only quite miserable but they're
[1:04:15] unthankful amen people do not appreciate
[1:04:20] things
[1:04:21] amen
[1:04:24] amen and i believe that i believe it's
[1:04:26] jesus that said one time that he that he
[1:04:30] uh healed uh
[1:04:32] what was it 10 lepers right
[1:04:34] in luke 17 it says in one of them when
[1:04:36] he saw that he was healed turned back
[1:04:39] and with a loud voice glorified god and
[1:04:42] fell down on his face at at his feet
[1:04:44] giving him thanks and he was a samaritan
[1:04:47] amen
[1:04:48] jesus answer said but were there not ten
[1:04:50] cleansed but where are the nine i
[1:04:53] thought about titling this tonight
[1:04:54] where's the nine
[1:04:56] i mean how many knows that you know how
[1:04:58] many everything
[1:05:00] every i mean everything
[1:05:03] that is
[1:05:04] god created
[1:05:06] god made
[1:05:08] and people are not thankful for what god
[1:05:11] has done not thankful for what god has
[1:05:14] made
[1:05:16] like one
[1:05:18] one percent here of these lepers that
[1:05:20] were cleansed only one came back and
[1:05:23] gave him thanks and praise
[1:05:25] you know i don't know about you but
[1:05:26] sometimes i feel like you know we ask
[1:05:28] him a lot god a lot and so forth but i
[1:05:30] think tonight be a good time just to go
[1:05:32] amen and go down through and what we one
[1:05:35] might call counting our blessings
[1:05:38] how many want to count your blessings
[1:05:39] and now we'll do something different
[1:05:41] tonight let's count our blessings name
[1:05:42] them one by one donna if you can see if
[1:05:45] we have that song maybe for later count
[1:05:47] your blessing see what god has done
[1:05:52] oh my
[1:05:54] praise be to god when you think about
[1:05:56] what god has done for us
[1:05:59] take a good look at what god has done in
[1:06:01] your life
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:04] when you get getting looking at what god
[1:06:06] has done
[1:06:08] amen it'll make you thankful amen
[1:06:12] you know the bible says in second second
[1:06:14] thessalonians the fifth chapter and
[1:06:16] verse 18 it says in everything
[1:06:21] give thanks
[1:06:23] in everything how many know stonewall
[1:06:25] jackson when they ask how he does it
[1:06:27] he's because he's i never take a drink
[1:06:29] of water without thanking god for he was
[1:06:32] a thankful person he had a close
[1:06:34] relationship with god
[1:06:36] now i believe he's a character of the
[1:06:39] bride when we get to heaven how many is
[1:06:41] going to be glad
[1:06:43] how many is going to be thankful that
[1:06:45] you made it there
[1:06:49] oh my goodness you know
[1:06:52] i believe that it's going to be
[1:06:53] overwhelming
[1:06:56] amen
[1:06:58] because it talks about and they gave him
[1:07:00] thanks
[1:07:02] some praise and honor you know and
[1:07:05] there's thanks is one thing appreciated
[1:07:07] to more than just thanks but it turns
[1:07:11] into praise
[1:07:14] you know how many other people praise
[1:07:15] all kinds of things but we're to praise
[1:07:17] god
[1:07:19] not to think but praise him for it and
[1:07:21] then step up another step from there
[1:07:25] huh
[1:07:26] and go to worship in him
[1:07:30] and then and even deeper but into a
[1:07:33] worship
[1:07:34] singing songs and just praising and
[1:07:36] worshiping and thanking him and you
[1:07:39] watch god come inhabit that
[1:07:43] how many of these god inhabits the
[1:07:45] praise of his people
[1:07:46] amen
[1:07:48] so what let's talk about this generation
[1:07:50] for just a minute under
[1:07:52] ii timothy here
[1:07:54] perilous times to come because for one
[1:07:57] thing notice it says disobedient
[1:08:00] to parents
[1:08:03] now i do not look in this scripture and
[1:08:06] see
[1:08:07] the children at fault
[1:08:12] huh
[1:08:15] the children are not at fault because
[1:08:17] how many remembers brother branham said
[1:08:19] when it comes to juvenile delinquency
[1:08:21] what did he say no it's not it's parent
[1:08:24] delinquency
[1:08:26] he pointed it to parents delinquency
[1:08:28] because if a parent was what they were
[1:08:30] supposed to be that child would not be
[1:08:33] disobedient
[1:08:43] is why the child becomes disobedient
[1:08:47] they're after all the child
[1:08:51] you know it's terrible to think that
[1:08:52] children are smarter than their parents
[1:08:56] they know to outwit them
[1:08:58] they'll figure a way out around you if
[1:09:00] they possibly can
[1:09:02] they sure will they're smart little guys
[1:09:08] they sure are
[1:09:11] you know they they know how to push it
[1:09:13] from two to two and a half from two and
[1:09:16] a half to three and before they'll have
[1:09:17] you up to 20 before you do anything
[1:09:20] but mom but dad
[1:09:24] this and that right
[1:09:27] amen and so we look at it we find out
[1:09:29] that they're disobedient to parents and
[1:09:31] if they're disobedient to parents what
[1:09:34] will it end up where will they end up
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:38] why do you think that our police are
[1:09:40] getting shot left and right just for
[1:09:42] pulling somebody over
[1:09:44] the disrespect that their parents they
[1:09:46] ain't got no respect for the government
[1:09:50] or authority
[1:09:55] amen
[1:09:57] listen to what brother bam says in the
[1:09:58] influence in chicago if he says if our
[1:10:01] american people are setting a pace today
[1:10:03] before our children
[1:10:05] smoking cigarettes and men drinking and
[1:10:07] all that they're doing huh
[1:10:10] back then that's all they were doing
[1:10:12] right they were just smoking the
[1:10:13] drinking party and all that
[1:10:15] what kind of people will we have in the
[1:10:17] next race that is to come or in the next
[1:10:20] generation rather that is to come it'll
[1:10:22] be a bunch of neurotics
[1:10:24] which i think the whole world is just
[1:10:26] about in that condition now and if this
[1:10:28] race or this generation rather is like
[1:10:31] this what will the next one produce
[1:10:34] then if there would be another why the
[1:10:37] whole human race if it keeps going the
[1:10:39] way it is will become extinct altogether
[1:10:45] because we're killing ourselves and
[1:10:47] setting examples for others
[1:10:51] wow
[1:10:53] you know
[1:10:54] extinct
[1:10:56] yeah they're pretty much shooting each
[1:10:57] other and killing each other isn't that
[1:10:59] right
[1:11:00] totally dysfunctional i i want to say
[1:11:03] this as a preacher
[1:11:06] as a person that was born in 1962 and
[1:11:09] and had to learn the hard way it was on
[1:11:11] my own at 16 years old
[1:11:14] had my own apartment had to go and had
[1:11:15] to go out there and work for it work
[1:11:17] hard
[1:11:19] make a living and do things
[1:11:21] huh
[1:11:23] you know and i'm thankful that i had
[1:11:24] somebody to teach me that i could learn
[1:11:28] i feel for the generation that isn't
[1:11:30] even taught right how
[1:11:32] you know how they can't function
[1:11:35] if you're not brought up right
[1:11:36] you're in for a lot of trouble
[1:11:39] and i believe how many believes that's
[1:11:40] why brother brown says the backbone of
[1:11:42] the nation is a mother
[1:11:45] motherhood is the backbone of the nation
[1:11:47] because the way that she teaches her
[1:11:50] children
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:54] christ just identified in all ages 1964.
[1:11:58] he says i passed over california here
[1:12:00] the other day and i got a hold of a
[1:12:01] magazine or a paper read where
[1:12:03] homosexuals are increased 60
[1:12:06] last in the last year
[1:12:09] it's pitiful
[1:12:11] see and it's just because women have
[1:12:13] thrown themselves away that's right and
[1:12:15] just on the
[1:12:17] street naked
[1:12:18] it's just a shame but the bible said
[1:12:20] they'd be that way and even men the way
[1:12:22] that they've changed and it's it is
[1:12:25] going to get worse
[1:12:28] and in another if the world would stand
[1:12:31] another 50 years now notice that isn't
[1:12:33] 64. so in 2014 that would have been 50
[1:12:37] years we're eight years past that
[1:12:40] we're eight years past that okay
[1:12:42] if it it'll get worse if the world would
[1:12:44] stand another 50 years the whole world
[1:12:47] would be
[1:12:48] totally insane
[1:12:52] amen let me declare this out on youtube
[1:12:55] the whole world is completely insane
[1:13:02] completely insane
[1:13:07] ah we're putting in a supreme court
[1:13:10] justice that can't say that she knows
[1:13:12] what a woman is and she's a woman if a
[1:13:15] woman don't know whether she's a woman
[1:13:16] or not
[1:13:17] come on folks
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:21] insanity yeah yeah you heard it from me
[1:13:26] insanity okay that's what that is
[1:13:35] hey man that's the truth
[1:13:38] that's it if you don't know what you are
[1:13:41] you have been twisted
[1:13:43] huh
[1:13:44] that's right
[1:13:47] now i know that's totally insane
[1:13:49] look at the
[1:13:50] insanity already look at where it is
[1:13:54] look how how it's changed amen
[1:13:57] how it's going and how it's getting
[1:13:59] worse let me ask you this all these
[1:14:02] young people it's sad it goes through
[1:14:04] their queen and everything they got nose
[1:14:05] ring earrings and looked like freaks
[1:14:08] what are they gonna teach their children
[1:14:16] so we are reached the 50-mile
[1:14:18] 50-year mark
[1:14:20] the total insanity and it can only get
[1:14:22] worse from here
[1:14:28] like i said a few years ago back they
[1:14:29] said well don't ask don't tell under
[1:14:31] clinton policy now here's just this last
[1:14:33] time there was somebody boot and tag or
[1:14:35] whatever in their boot and egg or
[1:14:36] whatever his name was complete
[1:14:38] homosexual
[1:14:43] and i'm not sure i think he was the wife
[1:14:44] and her husband
[1:14:46] was the hymn back home i'm not sure he
[1:14:47] was
[1:14:49] and she him doesn't know what
[1:14:52] kim is either
[1:14:57] i was just a bit worried he's going to
[1:14:59] get the nomination we're going to have a
[1:15:00] homosexual president i mean it could
[1:15:03] easily happen
[1:15:04] that we'll have a homosexual president
[1:15:08] yeah yeah sure it's already gotten about
[1:15:10] as bad as it could but it can still get
[1:15:12] a little worse
[1:15:18] sad isn't it but that's where we're
[1:15:21] at
[1:15:23] insanity
[1:15:28] how does this
[1:15:29] fit into thankfulness

[1:16:55] i'm so glad
[1:16:58] how many glad
[1:17:00] let us be glad and reach out on the
[1:17:03] night
[1:17:04] because i'll tell you right now if you
[1:17:06] oh my when i think of help oh
[1:17:08] let's just start with number one
[1:17:11] let's let's start off with that with
[1:17:13] number one the first thing that we want
[1:17:15] to
[1:17:17] count our blessings
[1:17:21] and that is
[1:17:22] yes that
[1:17:24] you believe i believe that our names
[1:17:26] were written down
[1:17:29] that god chose you
[1:17:33] choosing you before the foundation of
[1:17:35] the world or you wouldn't be here
[1:17:38] you would look just like all the rest of
[1:17:40] you as losses to rest
[1:17:45] can i just say what comes to mind
[1:17:47] because i believe that if you're god's
[1:17:49] child i don't care how blue your hair is
[1:17:51] i don't come any nose rings you have i
[1:17:53] don't care how many tattoos you have you
[1:17:55] will come to god
[1:17:58] if you are god's child he says they will
[1:18:00] come to me and i will lose the never
[1:18:06] so i don't know where that last one is
[1:18:08] that's maybe what they look like i don't
[1:18:10] know but if you're
[1:18:12] god's child
[1:18:14] there'll be something that pulls you you
[1:18:16] will hear that voice
[1:18:20] amen
[1:18:21] they will come
[1:18:24] praise be to god
[1:18:26] that's that's the greatest how many
[1:18:28] leaves that's one of the greatest things
[1:18:30] that you can be thankful for
[1:18:33] behold what manner of love the father
[1:18:35] has bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:18:38] called the children of god
[1:18:40] to be a child of god is the greatest
[1:18:42] honor that you'll ever have i don't care
[1:18:44] if you would be a trump and a
[1:18:46] billionaire it ain't nothing compared to
[1:18:48] being a child of god
[1:18:51] amen that experience you wouldn't sell
[1:18:53] it for nothing you wouldn't give it and
[1:18:54] trade it for nothing that experience of
[1:18:56] god
[1:18:58] coming down and letting you know who you
[1:19:01] are
[1:19:02] where you come from where you going
[1:19:07] because them folks that don't know
[1:19:09] who they are
[1:19:12] they don't know where to
[1:19:14] go
[1:19:20] well i should take that last part back
[1:19:23] there's
[1:19:24] probably something in their mind tells
[1:19:26] them where they're going to know that
[1:19:29] they want to meet him
[1:19:31] you're giving
[1:19:32] so praise be to god i thought about that
[1:19:34] i think thank you
[1:19:36] for choosing me
[1:19:39] now the calling part is a little trick
[1:19:41] romans 8 and verse 28 says
[1:19:45] he says for whom he did for no
[1:19:48] then he also did predestinate to be
[1:19:51] conformed to the image of his son that
[1:19:53] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:19:55] brethren more over whom he did
[1:19:57] predestinate them he also called
[1:20:00] i believe with jesus after talking about
[1:20:02] getting that one guy that didn't have
[1:20:04] the robe cast out he says many are
[1:20:06] called
[1:20:08] huh
[1:20:10] many are
[1:20:12] called
[1:20:13] but few are
[1:20:16] chosen
[1:20:18] but
[1:20:19] even though there's many calls that are
[1:20:22] the same as the unchosen
[1:20:25] but thank god that god has not just
[1:20:27] chose you but he called you
[1:20:31] that's why we can sing i never shall
[1:20:33] forget the day
[1:20:36] when jesus rolled all my sin away
[1:20:39] amen and when he come and he touched you
[1:20:41] and changed you forever never forget the
[1:20:43] day
[1:20:45] when he called when that calling was
[1:20:46] there thank god for that drawing
[1:20:49] amen
[1:20:51] but notice he called
[1:20:54] he chose
[1:20:55] it was his choosing
[1:21:01] but more so think about it we think
[1:21:03] about the natural birth
[1:21:06] well thank you we know that natural
[1:21:07] birth is a miracle you see life's a
[1:21:09] miracle it's a miracle how birth comes
[1:21:12] but i thank god i want to say tonight i
[1:21:14] thank god much more
[1:21:17] for my second
[1:21:19] verse
[1:21:37] because jesus said about jude
[1:21:40] yes
[1:21:42] he said the sun man son of man
[1:21:44] goeth
[1:21:46] as
[1:21:47] it is
[1:21:49] nothing but unto that man by whom the
[1:21:51] son of man is betrayed
[1:21:53] for it had been good for that man if he
[1:21:56] had not been born
[1:22:00] notice
[1:22:02] that if he has called you
[1:22:04] defy
[1:22:06] now how many is glad for justification
[1:22:15] people will crawl on stones and rocks
[1:22:17] and they'll put themselves and do all
[1:22:20] kinds of things to try to make
[1:22:21] themselves feel a little better
[1:22:24] maybe do something to pay for their sins
[1:22:26] or whatever it is
[1:22:28] folks you could kill yourself
[1:22:31] and it wouldn't do absolutely zero
[1:22:34] for helping you
[1:22:38] you beat yourself to death it wouldn't
[1:22:40] do any good
[1:22:41] your blood ain't no good he already paid
[1:22:44] the price in other words jesus would
[1:22:45] even be disappointed
[1:22:47] because of your
[1:22:49] horrible unbelief in what he did
[1:22:52] good for you
[1:22:55] but he
[1:22:56] justifies that that means he
[1:22:59] picks you up
[1:23:02] clean
[1:23:03] you will
[1:23:07] he forget
[1:23:09] you
[1:23:12] and you don't have to be like
[1:23:15] the world and worry about
[1:23:17] judgment
[1:23:19] because you already know that
[1:23:22] that is size though you never
[1:23:24] ever
[1:23:26] did it
[1:23:27] in the
[1:23:28] first
[1:23:30] place
[1:23:31] oh my
[1:23:34] yeah
[1:23:37] that may be basic to people
[1:23:40] but it's not basic to me
[1:23:42] when i've been there ten thousand years
[1:23:45] bright shining is this outside
[1:23:48] how many beliefs you're gonna outshine
[1:23:49] the sun
[1:23:51] sun may be only six thousand ten
[1:23:52] thousand years i don't know how long
[1:23:54] it's been but it can burn out
[1:23:55] there's no sun there
[1:23:57] not us
[1:24:01] way down in some
[1:24:03] you're not gonna be like this generation
[1:24:05] of unthankful people
[1:24:07] huh ungrateful people
[1:24:10] we're still gonna
[1:24:12] that's now i see
[1:24:16] amen
[1:24:18] see what god has done let's talk about
[1:24:20] number two
[1:24:21] number two is for
[1:24:23] me
[1:24:24] with his speech no matter how much you
[1:24:26] get justified no matter how much you get
[1:24:28] sanctified you need a feeling
[1:24:34] go ahead look at that gauge
[1:24:37] how
