Psalms 118 and we're gonna just start in verse one we'll read up to verse 15. Psalms 118. oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good because his mercy endureth forever foreign forever called upon the Lord in distress the Lord answered me and sent me in a large place lord taketh my park with them that help me therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me which is I trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes they compassed me about yea they Compass me about but in thy name in the name of the Lord I will destroy them now as thrust store at me that I might fall but the Lord helped me the Lord is my friend called this one together the voice of rejoicing in Salvation is in the Tabernacles of the righteous the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly God bless you may be seated brother Brian brothers and sisters so after reading that psalm this morning I sure hope there's none of us putting any trust in governments or princes or people that your trust is in the Lord this morning uh if you return with me maybe do something different I'm going to try to go three places I know I go all over the place uh first John the first and then First Corinthians the 10th chapter and then uh the Epistle of John the first chapter of the third verse but I was listening to a message this morning um before I come here but I was just thinking about that song we were reading you know if there's nothing you can trust in this life that will get you over on the other side I mean it's not things are there's God wants you to prosper I want you to have a good life while you're walking the face of the Earth but that should not be your only desire your desire should be to him and to serve him this morning and I was just thinking there you know brother Branham taught some messages he said if God is with us where are all the Miracles and as we come to this year 2022 a few months from going to 2023 or oh it's not God's fault there are no Miracles a lot of times you got to examine yourself and and look into your own life why God might not be doing for you the things that you think he should be doing for you but now it's not I do this and he does that relationship it's the opposite you just give all your confidence and love and put it in him and then he'll bring about the circumstances in your life that he desires to see that's the hard thing about the human the human man a woman wants their own way sometimes and not God's way and it's you got to get to a point and wrestle where you know what God's way for you is and the life that we live but I was also thinking you know God cares about everything you do every place you go every the people you deal with God cares about every situation in your lifetime you know a lot of people say that and I believe that but sometimes if we forget about that in our daily Journey as we go through life you know and I was just thinking you know I had an inch you know you know circumstances brought back to this place and and if I hadn't been there that day when they turned the national gas back on my company right now would be probably facing all kinds of multi-million dollar lawsuits so God does care about you you know you know I was there when we turned the gas on and the unit started flaming up so God does care about you he does bring about circumstances you know I was there I was fortunate that I was there just to be there at that unit when it started flaming up or it would have been a total different story that day if I had not been there so God cares about every portion of your life but I was thinking but I was and also listening to another message this morning but I was just thinking about that and a lot of times it's our fault not his fault if we believe I actually believe what brother random taught and we believe Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever then what are you worried about you know what do you you should they're not to say that you wouldn't have anxiety maybe a little fear would try to take over you need to push that away we're not perfect we're all making mistakes but I was listening to that message also this morning when we think of when I mentioned that earlier about governments and princes and everything you know now they're they're I'm I'm not gonna go off on a deep end but they're just totally perverted now that continually all they do and it's to the point like the brother Thomas was saying and the other brother was saying that we it's you know we always thought when you think of Sodom and Gomorrah you know that could never happen again but it is happening again they're here force you to either believe something or not be able to buy and sell and you can see it going on right now where they're trying to force you to believe in knowledge ideology in a way or you're not going to be able to buy and sell now let's listen to this not trying to be funny this morning now it's listening to that message this morning and it's this day the scripture is fulfilled in February 19 1965. and we all know that if brother Branham was on Twitter today or if he was on Facebook or you know that he'd be blocked just like the rest of us would because if you he was preaching in that message about Hollywood and homosexuality well you all know that that would not be received but when you think of it he was preaching about something in 1965 you know it's just six years old some of us weren't even born some of us were were probably 20 or 30 years old I don't know what your circumstances in your age in 1965 but he was preaching hard about that and in California in 1965 and look where we're at today in 2022 so if you have any hope of things getting better they're not going to get better and I and it really struck me when you when you listen to the message of the hour and you know I wasn't alive I wasn't a a mature man then when he was preaching the message but when you think of what he was preaching how it must you know sometimes I'm not saying it did but it must have just completely went over the people's heads sometimes and now here in the year 2022 you can see that's the scriptures are being fulfilled daily before our lives the way the world is going but changing a little thought here going to first John not wanting to jump around a lot I'll read these first four 15 verse is here and uh but let me let me read this because this this I have a lot more meaning why why I'm reading these three chapters this morning you are what you think you are you are what you think about 24 hours a day now I I don't know what you're thinking or Waning you think bad things or when you but what you find yourself thinking about 24 hours a day what consumes your mind where deep in your mind are true you're going to be you're going to bring become whatever you're thinking about you're going to bring in this um this Lutheran preacher had this this is years and years and years ago what a man thinks of himself how you think of yourself this morning you're going to walk into that however you think about it if you think of yourself as a Son of God that's what you're going to be this morning because you're going to be willing to do the things that make you a son or a daughter of God but I'll just read to what he had in this devotional he had said here and it goes and uh the Epistle of John that third chapter in the second verse but I said in our present situation we Face a task which is spiritual in its nature because it's life and death struggle between two opposing ways of life so he's talking in a spiritual sense between good and evil and at the same time World War II is going on so these young men in a natural way were going to we're going to have to face that but in a spiritual way as us as Sons and Daughters of God we go through the same thing it's contemplating that is a diseases and considered the larger General aspects than to get it is to consider oneself but what a man thinks of himself will largely determine the service toward the victory of which he strives and pray so he's and John says we are sons of God back in the beginning of time when Man was created God breathed within him the man became a loving soul we're all a living Soul this morning and he goes on not losing my place Jesus called men children of God for he had taught us to pray saying our father no higher thought of man is possible than this what a man thinks of himself as a form well he's going he's changing him when he says this wonder man thinks of himself as a form of an animal which the beastly nature asserting itself he will live and act as an animal when a man thinks of himself merely as a servant of a higher Earthly power be it the state of anything else he becomes a slave to that I'm paraphrasing here a slave to that power it is drawn from the god-given Heritage but we Christians Americans know that we are children of God Heirs of Christ you have joined hairs with him and God when Jesus says Be You therefore forgiven as your father which in heaven is perfect he set the standard for our attainment man is supreme he is to live Liberty and freedom and all good things of life here indeed is the vital thing concerning what a man should think himself man made in the image of my God that is it we are followers and workers with God and God is always with us to give us strength and courage in his spirit and I was uh thought just talked to me this morning is this guy would say and what 80 years ago it's the same today for us this morning everyone has different circumstances but how you think of yourself you're either here this morning thinking of yourself as a Son of God or a daughter or a God or you're thinking something contrary to that and only you know that this morning but let me read some scriptures here this morning so um so I'm not up here a whole long time in the Gospel of John I'll read these scriptures they don't change it's forever it's settled in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and when you read this you know many ministers come behind the pulpit and tell you you got to see yourself in it this morning you're reading to yourself back to yourself when you're reading this and the light shineth and darkness and the Darkness of Hopper abandon did not there was a man sent from God whose name was John and we you could think of our day and age we're trusting a messenger for the hour that we live in this morning and the same for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all my men through him might believe he was not the light but he was sent to Bear witness of the light and that True Light which he liedeth every man that cometh into the world it was in the world the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came onto his own in his own received him not and that's where we're at this morning the world is in that same place God has come to the whole world he's given the gospel to the whole world and as you can see one going on around the world to choose not to receive the Gospel they'll receive someone else's gospel like Jesus said but it won't be the Gospel of Jesus Christ and world made by him and the world knew him not he came onto his own his own receipt and not but as many as receding he gave he the power to become the sons of God and that's what that Minister was talking about he's given each of us this morning the power to become the sons of God this morning and that's what we desire to be and he goes on to say I lost my place here I don't want to I was a zombie but he received now but as many as he received him he gave his power to become the sons of God even to them but believe which were born not of blood nor a will but of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and ought to stop there this morning because I'll just keep going but the first most important thing I thought of this morning coming up here if if I had something else I wanted to read and I'm running out of time Hebrews 13 and 8 do we really believe it Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever if we do then there's nothing that stands between you and your savior this morning that you deserve it's a good gift that you desire of the Lord he's more than able to bring it about in your hearts in your lives this morning brother David him and let's stay in this morning if we could and hey man appreciate that this morning and we serve an awesome God this morning don't we man amen I sing that little course if we could this

just be with him in a special way this morning let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you father thank the Lord Jesus to be able to once again approach your throne of grace Lord Jesus and having a great God like you to be able to come to Lord and Lord to bring all of our troubles all of our cares whatever we have to you Lord and have somebody like you that takes care of all of our problems for us Lord we ask God that you just bless the meditation of our heart Lord Jesus and that which which you feel that you've laid upon our heart to minister this morning we ask God that you would just come speak to your children Lord the way that you want to speak to him father we invite you to come and let your anointing come in a special way and your presence be felt here and just come and do whatever you see fit to do this morning we love you and we ask God that as we open the Bible you would give us the inspiration and the interpretation and the word that you want us to speak now in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen and amen turn your Bibles amen I was in my uh office yesterday in front of my uh my computer where I study at and so forth and it just bowled my head and and just began to pray see what the Lord would have and amen it wasn't uh but just a minute this is what come to my mind and stuck and so we just take it as from the Lord amen so it trust that it'll be a blessing to you we'll turn first to Luke 11 Luke 11 chapter Luke 11. and it has to do with the Lord's Prayer amen last week we talked about the Lord's Prayer I believe it's found in Saint John 17 where he prayed for you and me amen for Unity amen that we would be one as they are one today we want to talk about the other part of the Lord's Prayer where he taught them to pray amen amen so um I don't believe it said it in Matthew so I went to Luke to pick out the first verse amen and I'll just pick out the first first verse and then we'll go to Matthew because they didn't finish the Lord's Prayer in this one so we're going to go back to the full prayer to the full Lord's Prayer in Matthew 11 1 it says and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his side said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples now let's go to Matthew if you will back to Matthew and we'll read The Lord's Prayer and perhaps we'll come back and pick up a little thought on the introduction to it but let's begin with verse 7. chapter 6 verse 7 of Matthew actually let's go to verse five we'll just pick it right all up and when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogue and in the corners of the streets that they may be seeing of men verily I say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which see is in secret shall reward thee openly but when he but when you pray use not vain reputations as the Heathen do do for they think that in for they shall be heard for their much speaking but be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before ye ask them ask him after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in Heaven halloweth be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our day our daily bread and forgive us of our debts for we as we we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever amen for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated this morning amen so we want to talk a little bit about prayer amen I titled this teach us to pray teach us to pray amen amen so uh I'll ask one question amen and I'm sure you all know the question is that is what is the only thing that you can't do too much pray that's one thing you can't do too much amen we want to talk about the value of prayer we want to go through what Jesus said amen in the Lord's Prayer and just look at what he said and the meaning of it and so forth what we can pull out of it and I want to talk to you with the help of the Lord by with another man's prayer now how many knows that I believe it's probably God I didn't go to pulling it up and thinking so forth but I believe he said something about people have tried to add to the Lord's Prayer and so forth but it's never worked out right amen and uh you know coming from the Lord Jesus Christ we know that if you pray to prayer it's going to be perfect right it don't need any adding to or taking away amen it's going to be perfect so what he said is something that we could pull a lot of Amen so I say this morning I'd like to go over the two wisest men in the world's prayer the prayer of two of the wisest men in the world we know that Jesus was the wisest isn't that right and how who knows who the other one was Solomon right but it's declared that he was the wisest man amen and so we want to look at his prayer with the help of the Lord amen um first of all let's let's before we go now when I go perhaps uh and pick up before I go into the the talking about the Lord's actual prayer and the things that it says and go through that because if you went really through that and took your time it would take a very very long time but I want to pick up some of the things that Solomon prayed and bring it over into uh uh Jesus's prayer and kind of time together a little bit but I would first of all talk about what he says what Jesus said here the Disciples of course wanting to pray and they said that John the Baptist taught his disciples to pray this morning we want to learn how to pray more now I think most of us probably know how to pray amen we probably know how to do that but you know the Bible exhorts us that we ought to you know the other thing the question I want to ask is what do we do when we get one again if you really want to get closer to God what is this one thing that you got to do according to prophet of God pray more right pray more and read your Bible more that's what he said was the secret to be getting closer to God and I believe it was Paul that said in second Thessalonians back here one place he said in the four five and verse 17 Paul said pray without ceasing do that amen so basically from what I understand you know we should always be in prayer you know you might not be in down on be able to be down on your knees but how many know you can pray you can constantly just be talking to the Lord because that's really if you want to see somebody that's different than most people and if you want to see a strong Christian what is that person going to do they're going to be a prayer Warrior amen amen why why would he be why would that make him so strong and better because he's always talking to God it has to do with fellowshipping isn't that right God wants Fellowship amen and we know that Jesus himself Jesus himself prayed a lot didn't he amen all right let me go through this and I have a lot of comments that I want to make but first of all verse 5 says that when you pray don't be like the Hypocrites but because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the street corners that they may be seen of men so never pray so that you're because you know you're being hurt and when you pray it doesn't matter you know when you pray you know in a congregational women's pray like you you know just like the woman remember brother man I'm talking about that black woman he come an Aunt Jemima that had her son you know she said he went down there and he asked her to pray first and she wasn't there to impress him no but when she prayed but the man says you could tell that she had talked to the Lord before amen then people say that about you when you pray good question right when you're baking people say boy he knows how to pray because I wonder sometimes right sometimes I ask myself you know do you really know how to pray you know sometimes we act like Lord Jesus I ask you to bless this food now and Sanctified through my body Jesus name amen you said any way to talk to God you know or just just in you can pray wrong a lot of different ways when you pray you want to pray sincerely right like you're talking to God not like some servant or just some myth or something you're talking to the Lord amen Lord Jesus common and and bless his food thank you Lord thank you for this food thank you and blessed Lord Jesus help us to use the strength to serve you in a greater way or just however you pray but don't do it to be heard pray like you do in your closet amen and he says you know because it's not praying is some not something that you do to be heard because listen when he says verily I say unto you they have their reward but when thou prayest enter into thy closet when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret amen that's where it's all at isn't it it's all about what you are into secret places in your closet when you're by yourself when you're all alone amen and you say Lord here I am I and you go into a closet you go wherever you go and that father would seeth in secret shall reward thee openly and when ye pray use not vain repetitions that they even do for they think they shall be heard in their much speaking amen it's never about how much you say or how loud you say it or whatever it's about amen whether you're sincere in your prayer folks I'm convinced me more than ever more than ever because this has to do with being in tune with God let me believe that being in tune with for God I wrote down here that um that even in the Lord's Prayer not in the Lord's Prayer but uh Jesus he's Jesus made the statement he says you know not the day nor the hour therefore he said watch and pray first it said take heed take heat amen that you watch and pray in other words mix sure let you watch and that you pray it's I believe is one of the ingredients for being ready for their action we all want to be ready for the rapture for when he comes because we don't know what the day is but two things you're going to have to do if you're going to be caught watching not unaware but caught watching caught weighty and that is because you're going to be in prayer talking to God Amen communicating and fellowshipping with him amen all right so that's right so he says uh in much speaking but be not be therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of even before you ask him oh my notice one other thing um let me see I thought I had this yeah right here is the scripture that I was looking for I was reading on the sixth chapter in the third second verse he was talking about alms and so forth about talking about they have their reward in other words when you do that and people think oh isn't he holy isn't he isn't he righteous it yeah according to scripture that's all you're getting that's it that's your reward and I get that from verse two verse 2 says when thou does thine alms do not sound to trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites doing the synagogue and in the streets that they may be have Glory of men verily I say unto you they have their reward amen my but what I do is sit do it don't let you left hand know what your right hand doeth amen and also not uh actually the first first verse was really what I was looking for take heed that you do not do arms before meant to be seen of men otherwise you have this is the word I was looking for and no no reward of your father which is in heaven you just you just cancel out you just cancel out your your reward if you do it because you're doing it for so it's hypocritical are you with me this morning amen do none of us want to do that none of us wants to be a hypocrite we don't want dude to be seeing the men and we don't even do it before reward do we no you do it because it's the right thing to do amen I believe that a man one place he gave so much money to this Widow and so much of that this out of the other and and and uh and uh IRS ask him about what does your wife know that you do this and I say I don't tell my wife you don't the conversations he's at the Bible says don't you left let your left hand know what your right hand does whatever you do you do it to the Lord is that okay take it up with him if you don't like that amen praise the Lord so remember it has to be in secret Glory all right I'm gonna try to pick this up the Lord's uh prayer again but let's go to Solomon let's if you would second chronicles let's go to Solomon's Prayer something we're all familiar with we know that Solomon built something that David wasn't allowed to build and that was the temple of God isn't that right David had it in his heart to build it and I read here where it says that you know that the Lord said that David had it right he had the right desire in his heart when he desired to do it that's what God said about him but he said he would refused him to do it he said this song Solomon is going to be the one that does it and after he build it and so forth and and dedicated and sang the songs and so forth then in Solomon's Solomon in second chronicles the sixth chapter we want to begin with verse 12. read and then skip a little because there's a lot of reading but he had everything been placed and and everything done and then it says in verse 12 and he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel and spread forth his hands for Solomon had made he Brazen scaffold a five cubits long and five cubits Broad and five cubits high and had said it in the midst of the court and upon it I'm gonna move this down and upon it it stood and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel and spent forth his hands Towers heaven now notice he made his special place just to have this prayer and said oh Lord God of Israel there is no God like unto thee in Heaven Nor in Earth which keeps covenants and show us Mercy unto thy servants that walk before thee with all of their hearts now let's go down a little bit further into his prayer Verse 18 but will God in every deed dwell with men on Earth behold Heaven and Earth heavens and had the heavens of Heavens cannot contain thee my we're getting a little deep there aren't we heavens and there's the heavens of Heavens now how many knows brother Brandon went to the sixth Dimension and sixth Dimension and he says that's where all the saints were all the children all the people of converts that it really went on before that he had led to the Lord and so forth he's seen all of them and it was just awesome he said man there's no words to describe it so beautiful and he wanted to see the Lord and the angel said what he says he's not here he's still a little higher he says there's another dimension even high he's even higher than this and mommy knows you'll come from the heavens of Heavens one of these days to pick you up and to pick me up take us home to be with him let me tell you something you want to have a real relationship with him amen the heavens of Heavens the Solomon said can't contain him how much less this house which I have built I love Solomon's Vision he realized that though he may come his atmosphere may be here there's nothing contained nothing big enough for God amen have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication O Lord my God to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth if are thee amen that thine eyes may be opened Upon This House day and night upon the place where all thou has said that thou that's a little bit because we have had a prophet Mighty Prophet come in our generation and preach to us God's chosen place of worship and he used the illustration of wherever God puts his name that's where he'll meet you and if he don't have his name there guess what he won't meet you there I mean that's why so many churches are Godless God ain't there he didn't sanction it he didn't put his name there just whatever he puts the name that's where he'll meet you hey Matt so we're glad this morning to know where that where that is amen all right that that would and upon the place where Allah has said that that one is put thy name there to York and unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth Powers this place hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant and of thy People Israel which have uh which that which they shall make cowards this place here thou from thy Dwelling Place even from Heaven praise God now notice in the Lord's Prayer tying it together a little bit remember one of the first things that Our Father which art in heaven right I mean that's where he is he's in the heavens of heavens and when he hears you that's where I hear you at he hears you from the heavens of Heaven amen my foreign hear from thy Dwelling Place even from heaven and when thou hear us forgive whoa amen wouldn't it say forgive didn't the Lord say in his prayer forgive us forgive us our trespasses even as we forgive those who trespass against us right another one first one of the first things he asks is for forgiveness amen because that's something we all need and we need a lot of it amen now it says if a man and this might take a little while but that's okay if a man sin against his neighbor and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear and the oath come before thine altered in his house then hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servant by requiring the wicked by recompensing his own way upon his own head and by justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness and if that people is also put a worst put to the worst yeah let me read this right and if that people Israel be put to the worst before the enemy because they have sinned against they and shall return and confess thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house then hear thou from the heavens and forgive the sin of thy People Israel amen how many knows that sometimes you backslide maybe sometimes you get away from God in all kinds of bad things will begin to happen to you might go get it the first thing you get is an attitude you'll get it stinking rotten attitude that's one of the first things that happens why the Devil comes in immediately when you transgress against God not on this and he says I want you wouldn't forgive him and bring them again into the land which thou gave us to them and to their fathers and when the heaven is shut up in other words the blessings ain't falling anymore when the heaven is shut up and there is no rain amen maybe your life gets a little dry cause you got away from God hello there's no more rain because they have sinned against thee yet if they pray cowards this place amen Powers this place and confessed thy name and turn from their sin when thou Dost afflict them amen aren't you glad boy this is really a backslider's message this morning hello a backsliders message somebody gets away from God I want you to know that he'll forgive if you're willing to turn from your Wicked Ways even if you're if you're willing to give your heart to God again he's more than willing to forgive it goes all the way back to the children of Israel with Solomon's Prayer one of the biggest things he prayed for is every kind of a trouble that they would get into he asked for pardon amen when thou just afflict them and then shall I hear from heaven for thies and forgive the sin of thy servant and of thy People Israel one thou has taught them the good way wherein they should walk amen and sent rain upon thy land and thou has given unto thy people for inheritance and there if there be death in the land if there be pestilence if there'd be blasting or mildew or locusts or caterpillar amen if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land whatsoever soar or whatsoever sickness there may then what prayer or what supplications shall be made of any man my that's covering a lot of stuff ain't it or of all thy People Israel when everyone shall know his own sorrow and his own grief amen I mean you know what you do you know what you did to grieve the Holy Ghost away but when you are willing to repent of that then Solomon says go ahead and God be merciful and forget praise be to God amen he asked us 490 times a day how willing do you think God's to forgive us he's more than willing to realize now notice his own grief and shall spread forth his hand into this house then here Powers this oh now notice I believe even brother Brandon talked about different ones that men get in trouble uh and they would look towards his holy Temple and pray they'd have to turn talk that Holy Bible whichever direction it was and believe and pray God would hear amen now I may notice we have a place like that that we can look to see prayer has has to do with turning your eyes towards Jesus turn your eyes on Jesus begin to look to him amen amen then hear thou from Heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and Render unto every man according to all that he is all of his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou only know us the hearts of the Children of Men that day May fear thee to walk in thy ways as long as they live in the land which God gave his son to our fathers moreover concerning the stranger think about this not even his people but if a stranger does it all right which is not of thy People Israel but it's come from a far country to thy great names for thy great namesake and thy Mighty hand and thy stretch out arm if they come and pray in this house amen now from what I understand I may know that Israel was very strong about not having any heathens coming into the temple huh according to this even if they come and they pray amen if they come and pray in this house then shalt thou hear from the heavens even from thy dwelling place and do according to all the stranger calleth on the boat amen red be to God Jesus said whatsoever things ye desire ask and you shall receive I mean he's glad for that praise the Lord my mind all right uh dwelling place to according to strange equality to do and fear thee as thou thus the People Israel and may know that this house is which I have built is called by thy name and If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou has sent them and they pray unto thee Towers this city which thou has chosen and the house which I have built for thy name and hear thou from the heavens amen their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause my praise the Lord can you read something more there whenever you ask God to help defeat your enemies somebody believes he's going to be there to answer your prayer but let me ask you what does it take it takes Pride better man says you know sometimes God can announce death on a person and their prayer could change the thing do you believe that it did for Hezekiah didn't it when God told the prophet go tell him he's going to die and did not come off of his head he turned his face to the wall and wept bitterly and God spared him his life another 15 years after death had been pronounced by God he said prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the hands of man kind the prayer of faith amen I'm at least prayer is one of the most powerful weapons that God has in his Arsenal for you and me praise be to God it's the most powerful why because when you go down your knees when you pray what are you doing you're tapping into a supernatural power something Way Beyond what you're you can do what your own ability can do amen when you tap into that power just comes to mind now but didn't brother bam say that when the weakest Christian gets where on his knees when he gets here the devil's tremble it scares the devil to death why because he knows God will honor their prayers it's not him doing it it's going to be God that comes in on the scene it brings calling Jesus on the scene prayer is calling Jesus on the scene how many beliefs we need to pray more folks amen prayer will get you out of real hard pinched places Daniel knew it isn't that right Daniel Prayed he was a prayer Warrior and it got him out of the lines and he got the three Hebrew children out of the fire they were so close to God Amen it'll get you out of a pinch prayer will not just you know you know because you'll turn to one thing or the other if you don't pray about things you're gonna lose your temper you're either gonna get angry about things or you're going to go to prayer about things we need to go to God In Prayer about things and you won't get angry about things that goes for me that goes for you amen and I was studying back there the last thought that came to my mind about this was what brother man said he says sweeten your temper with prayer prayer will calm yourself now it'll sweeten you it'll humble you it'll make you Kinder it'll be more you'll be mark consider children better you'll do every Everything pattern if you pray more we need to pray more I need to pray more you'd have a lot less that would get to you no I'm not saying you're gonna have less problems but you'd have less troubles that get to you if you prayed more you don't overcome more bro cause you're gonna have problems the prayer is what does it that's oh my this is him I'm just gonna preach her but even Jesus was the prime example of Prayer God himself and flesh and that man man it was so hard for him and he had to pray in the Garden of Gethsemane because he knew there was a real test ahead of him he's gonna have to give his life he's gonna have to be beaten Bruce and breathe after death with everything else and he had to have strength he had to pull from the spirit on the inside by going and he prayed for so long and he asked his disciples can you pray with me amen pray with me and they fell asleep on him he was way big it was hard thought they didn't realize what was happening they didn't realize what he was going through but he didn't strength and he wanted to pray with him he said well just go on sleep on then a lot of times when we going through hard times it seems like our friends is sleeping but keep praying amen is that where you get your strength from your strength the strength of your Christian Life is in your prayer which is your fellowship with God and reading your word the word that's the strength of your Christian law you don't pray a lot not going to be a very good strong Christian the more you pray the stronger you're going to be why because you're going to be in tune how many knows it's keeping in tune I don't like a sputtering car do you well we have a lot of sputters in our life whenever you get away from prayer and from God Amen you have a lot of reaction to things that we shouldn't have amen because we didn't pray pray about everything god let's finish this year oh my all right maintain their cause and if they sin against thee for there is no man which sinnethought amen you know it's I know that's abbreviated there and I guess somebody put that in there but it's true nonetheless you're you're fall short amen you're four sword fall because you're human I'm not saying willfully and by mistakes you fall so hard and thou be angry with him through them and deliver them over before their enemies and they carry them away amen look let me tell you something I mean look sometimes we really get carried away when we get away from God but I'll tell you what how many knows a person that gets away from God there ain't no time man how far they can get carried away the devil will carry you out of church he'll carry you away from your marriage you'll carry you all kinds of terrible places into Abyss and to the abyss if you let him but if you repent huh turn from your wicked way all right and they carry them captive into land far off or near yet it made me think themselves in the land whether they have carried or carry captive in other words just sit down and think about it and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity saying we have sinned we have done a miss and help dealt make it lay amen I mean you got to acknowledge yourself you got to acknowledge your failure he that hideth his sin shall not Prosper put this in your vocabulary put this down in your hard drive that if you try to cover up something that the Holy Spirit convicts you of you shall not prosper when the Holy Spirit speaks to you you better listen to that amen otherwise you will not Prosper you have to admit it and confess it even though you're carried away if you'll be think yourself amen and say we've done wrong amen and that belt wickedly if they returned to be with all their heart and with all their soul and the land of their captivity whether they are carried them captive and pray towards their land which thou gave us them to their fathers and towards the city which God has chosen entires the house which I have built for thy name amen remember this is all hooked to Jesus right now God chose Christ that was God's house that was God's Tabernacle wasn't it Jesus was God's Tabernacle he dwelled Among Us he put his name in there there's no forgiven no remission outside of the name of Jesus Christ amen comes with Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name amen Dr house which you have built in thy name then hear thou from the heavens even from thy Dwelling Place their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee everybody said amen praise God for forgiveness praise the Lord let's see what God's response is you want to hear God's response to Solomon how many wants to hear it this morning chapter 7. verse 12. and the Lord appeared to Solomon in my night and said unto him I ever heard thy prayer amen praise the Lord and I've chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice praise be to God amen then Jesus says I am the way I am the truth and I am the life no man can come to the father but by me amen I have chosen this place and if I shut up the heaven that there be no rain or if I command the locusts to Devour the land or if the I said pestilence amongst the people amen hallelujah if this is a famous saying famous scripture and if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and I will heal their life [Music] think about it now back's father gets away from God all these things that we read maybe you get far away from God and you'll repent turn from your wicked ways and I'll tell you what God will restore the joy of the Lord again like David said to restores me to Joy of my salvation God will restoring and he'll forget thank you you get away from God just remember God's waiting on you but you've got to make up your mind you got to be thinking yourself at God here I am but I ain't done wrong but let me come back Lord I'm never I think you're gonna thrust Christians are just getting away from God in the slightest little way man we say God I'm not quite on fire like it ought to be I don't feel at peace like God have I don't have the job I gotta have restart me Lord I've done not worth ought to be you gotta acknowledge it y'all okay I guess or is that the truth amen that's the truth amen aren't you glad for that prayer amen ask and it shall be given unto you seek and you shall find pray that's what you do a lot of time we don't always just pray to ask God for stuff but that's what you got to do get on your knees and ask God amen praise be to God my him and forgive their sins now mine eyes shall be open amen and my ears because remember Solomon says make sure that I want you to listen to him before seven that's one of one of the first things on his request was God I want you to have the 21st time and I want you to day and night I believe you use the word amen I want you to always be there to hear I'm bad for that and believe me brother Brian said something you know if you have Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever and you have whatever you have need of God will give it to you he will supply your need if you have a God that's the same yesterday and forever aren't you glad open and my ears attending to the prayer that is made in this place amen that's right for now I have chosen and Sanctified this house and my name that my name may be there forever in my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetual Willie amen praise be to God he'll always be there Jesus's prayer was after this manner pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Glory now notice the first two words it says hour our father is talking about a group of people when it says hour now how many knows Our Father which art in heaven so we realize our father we all have a daddy [Applause] but God is not everybody's father The Sinner and them can't call God his father even Jesus said to the Pharisees he was very very straight forward and says you know if God were your father you'd believe me he says but the devil is your father you are of your father the devil aren't you glad to have a Heavenly Father this morning it watches out for you that cares for you oh my I don't know what kind of father every one of us has but we think of our Earthly father and all growing up and everything all the different things that we have asked of our father father can I have that father can I have that father this father but you know we don't have an Earthly father that is limited in supplies and in needs and in material things and and things to give to us we have a father that owns everything that when you get in the bar he has a way to get you out of that mind it's nice to have somebody to go to and you have need of help very few things it's just terrible so it's being in the world alone and not having anybody to help you out when you're down even the Bible talks about you know two is better to have two people because if one thousand minutes the other one will lift him up we've got to Heavenly Father that knows to follow us here he knows the number of your hair he cares about you every day that's why he said in a large day in the prayer there a little bit later on he talks about him give us our daily bread our supply God supplies us with our daily bread his eyes are open to the sparrow and he knows he needs seeds to spell if he feeds his paradise I got his eyes open and then he's got his eyes open to you and me and I'm gonna give us Faith to know that our heavenly father it's going to take care of us we have our Our Father oh my god I've got a father to tell you about let me tell you about my daddy my father I got to thinking about you know the different ones of us have different jobs do different things but I got to think about brother John I talked about a logger and if you got your biggest skitter or maybe your biggest machine that you've got God and you got down into some kind of a deep Miry mutt that bulldoze and nothing would get it out you say how am I gonna get this thing out oh this is just terrible uh you get down in mind you don't know how you're gonna get it out but boy I'll tell you what if you own hey man if you if you knew you had a daddy you had a father that had the biggest crane in the world hey man you can sit at the edge of the balloons almost and reach over there just pick that thing right up and pull it right out the way it is with my heavenly father no matter how much luck we get down and he'll pull you out to deep Miry clay up but you set your feet on a rock it's me [Music] my heart was distressed me Jehovah's breath found and low in the pit where my sins smacked me down oh but praise be to God praise mercy and First Grace for heavenly father that pulled me out of a more life of man no hope no nothing I don't know which way to go but he picked me up says I'm you're my son son I'm in his left have a Heavenly Father takes care of you that's our father right there I found it he wanted you to know in his prayer and you've got it headed you've got a father and it ain't the devil it's a Heavenly Father which art in heaven right he is in heaven if you want to talk to somebody in heaven you better get on your knees and talk to that other dimension because that's where he's at praise be to God I thought about our father we charged in heaven and he's in the heavens of the heavens hello but I mean no she's just standing on high and he gave gifts unto men not only did he give gifts unto man but the Bible says that he didn't descended again into the hearts of his people so if he's in heaven and that he is in you what does that mean that you got in you that means you got a portion of the heavens of Heaven in your heart that's why the Bible says we are gathered in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus it's not hellish places it's Heavenly places amen how many slapped to be in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen Hallelujah Hollywood be thy name Hallowed be thy name this is what Siri says I don't know how reliable she is but both have to go with her today because I couldn't figure out Helen I'd have said he was holy holy holy is his name his name is Holy but this is what it says to pray Hallowed be thy name means to ask God out to let his name be worshiped exalted honored and adored on Earth as it is in heaven praise God how many believe that honored worshiped Hallowed be thy name it is to ask God so uh it is to ask God to so move and act in the world that the people will worship and treasure him Above All Else that's right man whatever you do you gotta have above worship them above everything else you I am about everything else Praise Him above everything else but at first and everything in your life let's put his name Hallowed be thy name worship be thy name glorified be thy name amen Hallowed be thy name and thy kingdom come thy kingdom come amen now come is a future sets it's to come to come amen now we know that the kingdom of God is within us but it talks about a kingdom that is to come if it's talking about the kingdom that is to come he comes in three sons name son of man Son of God and Son of David but a man taught us I believe in the future whom he says what he comes to say that son of David he sits on the throne he rules and Reigns for a thousand years now his kingdom is coming when these kingdoms to be broken down and truly we're going to be in his kingdom but we're in the spiritual Kingdom right now amen let thy kingdom come and I like this other one here wait a minute yeah thy kingdom come verse 10. thy kingdom come and thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven my question to you this morning is do you reckon the up in heaven his wills be not you don't got to be that glad it's a resounding amen and be good hey I don't think there's any Devils up there right now other than the one that's accusing us but everything up there is in order just the way that God wants it because we know that at one time the devil got out of line didn't he all those angels got out of line and out of the will of God and what did they do but they thrown down they got passed out and not doing the will of God and with a heart's desire of somebody that's praying and that's a Christian When you pray you say God let my let your will be done in my life the Christian desires nothing more but than God's will to be fulfilled in is his or her life are you with me Lord let thy will be done in this earth amen the devil's having his way out there but God's still having his way right here let thy will be done you nurse as it is in heaven amen I come to do thy will o God Amen how many is here to do his will the songs I want to do that I will O Lord I will I want to do that well take me break me mold me and make me I want to do thy will o God let thy will be done praise be to God on Earth as it is in heaven and give us this day our daily bread is he feeding you this morning are you being fed then you are fulfilling this scripture right here right now amen he's giving you your daily bread he's feeding you spiritually I must be fed spiritually this morning amen give us this day our daily bread sure he takes care of your natural bread too how many knows that he takes care of your natural bread but he also take care of your spiritual bread give us this day our daily bread quit worrying about tomorrow so much you remember Jesus said don't worry about what you're going to eat so much this out of the other seek the kingdom of first all these things will be added unto you hey man One Day at a Time Sweet Jesus if we could just live more like that huh and notice it is the next one is and forgive us of our debts that's a good one there apparently he knew that we was going to mess up huh he put it in his prayer put it in his very perfect prayer said the one thing we need to ask for what was it brother man told Billy Paul always make sure everything's right and confess before you go to sleep you don't know where whether you're gonna get up this next morning or not huh so make sure that you're clear Jesus wants to make sure that your sins are forgiven and that's of course based on huh whether you forgive others they're dead don't you trespass against you you know what as we forgive our debtors forgive us about it amen and I think this is the case remember the one the one one day to hold a guy some money and the next guy owed him a million times more right and and let's just say a bit of John there always be money uh and brother Danny owes me money John owes me a thousand dollars but Daniel owes me a hundred thousand huh and John comes and says you know I'll pay you as soon as I can just be patient with me like my man says just be patient and I'll pay you you know and and I said well John let's just forget it just forget it I hate to use you for Brother John I'm gonna pick somebody but and I forgive him he says oh thank you brother Bob thank you for giving me for giving me now I got this story wrong I mean they got the story wrong I wanna they don't he daddy don't know me nothing all right Daniel Sean on the towel that's how it is our holy spirit always straightens it up my you know getting my praise firing I need more of the Holy Ghost so what is it and then Danny goes to Brother John says bear with me I'll get you your money you know I'm gonna sell some boxes we're gonna pay you back you know and John said what are you talking about I ain't got patience you know how you know now and he calls the cop because he owes me money throw him in jail boy if that's about stupid isn't it throw a guy in jail for all your money how in the world you can make because I'm not you're sure not to get your money right but anyway yeah that's what he did in the Bible he said don't throw him in jail and then I find out anybody John I understand he's threw everybody in jail ah when I forgave you huh let me ask you something do I still have the story wrong I still got the story wrong don't I because he owed me a lot and healed him a little all right thank you thank you I might get my story straight yeah all right all right thank you it's just a hand I've been catching that somebody knows their Bible but I just caught that you know because it didn't quite make sense that uh you know I'd forgive him for little and then he didn't charge you much but he was the other way around all right but anyway he told us him in jail and I said now look what what in the world I forgive you for the hundred thousand and you won't forgive him for the thousand and what did he do he just take that man and put him in jail until he paid the utmost now I said that to say this that is how it is when we don't want to forgive somebody for trespassing against this we're the ones that owe a whole lot more than what that guy probably does huh if we've got that attitude then we better than we have a lot I got a lot more on it hey man how many nose wants to be free of debt I want to be dead free forgive us of our debts as we forgive our matters let's be free of that there's no sin against it was so much so until Jesus at the end of his prayer said mentions it again isn't that right for if you forgive not men their trespasses your heavenly father will also not forgive you folks how many knows that's why that's why that's what causes a lot of problems in this world with family and With Friends is that lack of forgiveness holding grudges holding bitterness it causes a lot of problems it's all got to be gone then Jesus put it in his prayer forgive us of our debts amen Jesus never said he wasn't praying he says my father forgive me Jesus just didn't need to be any forgiven but he was telling them how to pray forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil amen how many believe that you know there'd be a lot of Temptation out there let me knows that a lot of tempting by the devil and so forth but he said keep us from temptation amen don't lead us into it but Deliver Us from all evil because Jesus knew there's a whole lot of evil in this world amen and we want to stay clear of evil Lord help us amen Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom amen praise the Lord in other words he's the king it's his kingdom boy if the church is in this age would have realized that it ain't about what they think or say it's what God vindicates and proves huh it's his kingdom he says how you know what the prophet God says you know let every man's word be a lie and here's the truth that's why he says man this is the only truth there is there's not a thousand different ways Jesus is the only way it's the only name that God ever has for you to meet God anywhere is the name of Jesus not father son the Holy Ghost not Baptist Baptist or anything else only in the name of Jesus Christ it's his kingdom for thine is the kingdom the power amen oh Hallelujah aren't you glad to know that it's not your power it's God's power in your life that kept you to overcome anything it's his power and His glory oh my we're just worms we're just worms okay even the Bible calls us worms am I a worm I am a worm something of them said when those those holy prophets really get a picture of what they are they say I'm a worm compared to God I'm nothing without God you're nothing without God man I was walking last night on the farm and I looked up at that orange sitting sun in that beautiful sky and all of creation everything that he's made and I thought man people absolutely take for granted I think they are enjoying God's creation and God in his presence so far everything he's made they take it completely for granted can they do that they don't even appreciate it but when they're in hell there's no sun there's no trees there's no sunsets there's nothing of God no sight of God nowhere it'll be terrible amen but thy is the kingdom and the power and the glory amen I say a woman because listen ain't none of us deserve any Glory anybody that's a glory Seeker is not a Christian an honor Seeker is not a Christian amen God deserves all the honor all the glory all the power amen for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory sometime no for ever and everybody said amen amen his is a kingdom the power and the glory forever amen you love him this morning praise be to God amen praise the Lord it was just maybe one more the house of Cornelius remember he was a one that gave alms and he says and he prayed and he prayed for the right path and being a gentile isn't that right the angel come down and says I've heard your alms and your prayers have come up before God your prayers are heard it was his prayers that made the difference I mean I believe there's so much difference Our Lives can be one place the Bible says you ask not because you believe not you ask him this because you do it upon your own lust but be you have not because you asked not how many believes a lot of times people don't have things because they don't ask and they don't ask because you don't believe one more scripture where that says you know when thou prayers for something believeth that believe that thou will receive it and thou shall have it he says whatsoever you ask in my name James 8 John 14 around 16 he says Jesus says I will do it I mean please forget to ask ask for a closer walk with God ask for a deeper walk with God how many needs a deeper walk with God a closer walk with God God says I will give it to you amen I love the testimony brother Brian that's just how God does in our lives he keeps us from multi-million dollar lawsuits he keeps this from he watches over he cares about us because we stand for him sometimes maybe we talk to Sinners maybe they don't take it but just be fact that we're standing for Christ we're not ashamed of Christ and we're not ashamed of the gospel God Honors that he watches over his people I'm in his plan for God that watches and has an open eye to you and I his eyes on the sparrow he's always got an open eye always watching you day and night oh that ought to tear us up and put a little Zeal in a little zip in our feet say thank you Lord Jesus you have a great heavenly father and we worship you and we magnify you stand with me this morning amen and just give him another cup off and say thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord you're awesome God we love you Lord we love you father your awesome father thank you for teaching us to pray that we ought to pray always without ceasing amen God bless you this morning with our heads bowed how many will I Repent say I don't pray as much as I should and I'm repenting right now I'm acknowledging my fault that I don't pray like I should I don't have fellowship with God like I should I need to pray more than what I do God bless those hands all over the building now Lord you see it Lord and you said if we turn from our way and Lord we'd written acknowledge our sin Lord Jesus and everybody's at a different place Lord you know where everybody is Lord but they all got their hands raised and saying Lord they want to be at a closer place with you now I ask God that all of our sins and all of our failures would go on to the blood of Jesus Christ and that we would go from this building cleaner and while we came Lord Jesus Sanctified more for the use of the master god this morning forgive us of our sins Lord and we don't have anything against anybody we forgive all of our debtors Lord this morning we ask you to forgive us of all of our debts and all of our sins make us pure and righteous and holy before you Lord and help us to walk with you like Paul said daily praying without ceasing always talking to you always fellowshipping with you and talking to you Lord that's how it should be Lord a constant Fellowship like Enoch had a constant praying a constant watching any day now God because this is certainly a damned world this world is a Sodom conditioned God it's gotten right down into the schools into the children now it can't hardly get any worse Lord and we keep saying that but it keeps getting worse Lord and father we know that the fire is fixing to brew you're fixing to burn this place but first

name of Nolan that needs to touch from the Lord the heart I guess is bleeding and they can't really figure some things out that's wrong with but how many believes that God can touch it can touch Nolan amen we're going to pray over this this morning and ask God to just go with it and touch the one it that it touches amen touch Nolan and change his life amen Lord Jesus we come before you Lord and we ask God knowing god that this would be considered and perhaps in the medical field some perhaps a big thing father but we know that it's just a small thing for you Lord and we ask God for a touch for Nolan Lord Lord that you would touch him and heal him Lord Jesus and that father you would increase the faith of the parents and so forth Lord and and Lord we believe with all of our heart God that you'll do something special for Nolan God we just lay our hands upon this believing God these that you will the Lord wherever this goes when it touches him Lord that something's going to happen and that a good report will come back we believe it and ask it in the name of our wonderful hallowed name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you better David loving with all your heart of
