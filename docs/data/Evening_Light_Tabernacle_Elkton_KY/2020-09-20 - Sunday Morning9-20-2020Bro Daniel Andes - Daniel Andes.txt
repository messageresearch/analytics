brother daniel god bless you appreciate it may god bless you all we bring greetings in the name of jesus christ you can be seated it's so good to be back again and see so many of our friends and it's been a while since we've been here and looks like the lord's taking good care of you amen how's the bible say david said the lord is my keeper can you say that the lord is my keeper amen it's not us keeping ourselves it's he's our keeper amen it's good to be back with brother byler we've been knowing each other for many many years and good to see brother micah sister donna and man we've grown up together it seems like you know we're not kids anymore but the lord knows about that i see you have a picture of william branham which is a nice picture there it's good to see it's still hanging in the church still believing a message that god sent amen it's most vindicated ministry that ever came to the face of the earth outside of jesus christ i'm not ashamed to be identified with it i'm glad to be identified with brother byler who's not ashamed of it as well i was listening to a message in the last couple days accepting god's provided way for the end time in 1963 brother graham's given the sign of the discernment and he said now this ought to produce rapturing faith he goes through the discernment at the end he said now that will produce rapturing faith so amen it's something that god sent in the last day to restore our hearts back to the faith of our fathers to believe jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen it's good to see so many good to see brother baldwin his family brother pewt and brother stephen and amen brother wade good to see brother chris kathy he and sister rachel that was a surprise he come up pulled up beside us this morning we got a little we kid each other we he drives a white honda and i'd drive a white honda and we were kidding each other jesus came riding on on a white horse with ten thousand of the saints said you gotta drive away a white car so we're kind of kidding each other about that but i appreciate brother chris i don't know if it's out of the way brother chris why don't you stand up and say something for the lord you just put a preacher on the spot you don't give them a mic you just stand up and say something for the lord brother christ these churches come here so many churches amen praise the lord amen god bless you brother chris a little word of exhortation there it's good amen how many have been edified already today feel like your face been stronger we haven't even opened a bible my goodness my wife had us on why don't you come up here and sing for us we had a little song together i was reading something we were listening actually coming down this morning i was listening message trying to do god a service without his will i heard yesterday i was listening the first part of it brother ann was talking about the california earthquake talking about sister simpson said she went and got a prophecy that i made around 1935 or something like that said the time would come that's written in a book somewhere that the the sea would weep its way into the desert look what will take place he said if that thousands of square miles falls down into the lava of the earth and slides in there will be millions die at one time and that'll cause a tidal wave remember come up into the sultan sea is 100 or 200 feet lower than a sea level that water will probably come almost to tucson with that tidal wave coming across there he said the sea will weep its way into the desert that's been a prophecy amen that god's prophet made i was out in arizona here a few years ago in phoenix and i drove i'd never been to los angeles and i drove to los angeles it's a huge valley that goes all the way from phoenix all the way to los angeles and so i went to the salton sea it's just a dead just the thing but it's below sea level there brother adam's telling us when that california goes in the ocean he said there'll be a wave a tidal wave that'll come all the way back through there into phoenix he said almost to tucson so i believe it's a prophecy it's going to come to come to pass noah prophesied for 120 years it's gonna rain and one day it rained amen california will go into the ocean and then everyone will know and everyone will be a believer that god sent a prophet in this day but then it'll be too late i want to be a believer this morning amen and noah's day when the first drop of rain came everybody was a believer but it was too late amen i want to be on the right side i want to be on the winning side we sang this song together here the other day maybe we'll try to sing it together i don't know if this microphone will work all right come on over on the winning side we're following jesus we got our banner held high we're god's mighty army and we won't be denied so come on over to the winning side [Music] yes lol [Applause] [Music] come [Music] we're following jesus we got a banner held high [Music] and we won't be denied so come on over to [Applause] [Music] and we marched to the water and i can hear daniel cry these lions can't hurt me i'm on the winning side so come on over to the women's side we're following jesus we got our banner held high with god's mighty and we won't be denied so come on [Music] amen i want to be on the winning side nobody likes to be a loser i read the back of the book and the christians went amen let's all stand together and open the word of god amen aren't you glad you're in god's house today amen i'd rather be here than in the best jail in louis louisville or elkton amen praise the lord if you have your bibles matthew chapter 27. this thought has been in my heart and just thought maybe we would read it this morning and see what the lord would say for us how many come expecting the lord to speak to you would you raise your hand raise your hand up if you want the lord to say something to you good to see sister serenity brother austin up there in the bowel can god bless you all amen let's pray together heavenly father lord we love you today and we just come to your house to show the devil whose side we're on we're on the winning side father just pray lord as we read your word you'd touch our hearts you'd strengthen us lord strengthen brother byler sister donna the saints lord the deacons the elders i pray you'd bless us all together lord you said blessed is he that readeth the word of god so lord we know we've been edified but when we read this book in a moment lord that we'll be blessed more strengthen us today lord and help us we ask in the name of jesus christ amen saint matthew chapter 27 i want to start with verse 27. and the bible says then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers and i want to watch you with what he what they did to my savior first they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews now we know there's coming a time when the bible says every knee will bow and every tongue will confess but these people are kneeling but they're mocking jesus christ verse number 30 and they spit upon him and took a reed and smote him on the head and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off of him and put on his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name and they compelled him to bear his cross brother ram tells us he was a colored man amen was a colored man that helped the lord jesus bear his cross a man may god take all racism out of the body of christ there should be no racism in god's body verse number 33 and when they were come unto a place called gal goth that is to say the place of the skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and he and when he had tasted thereof he did he would not drink and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they had parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots and sitting down they watched him there i can't read all that without going to the 28th chapter reading a couple verses we know a lot of the rest of the story but 28 chapter verse number 5 and the angel answered and said unto the woman fear fear not ye for i know that you seek jesus which was crucified he is not here for he has risen as he said come see the place where he lay amen may god add his blessing to the word you may be seated i want to go back to that take my text out of matthew chapter 27 verse 35. amen and the verse 36 actually the bible says and sitting down they watched him there and sitting down they watched him there and if we can just go in our minds for a few minutes and want us to go back to gethsemane i think sometimes we have forgotten what it costs to bring our redemption the bible says in ephesians the the first chapter the second chapter and also colossians that we are made nigh by the blood of jesus christ so there was no redemption outside of the blood of jesus christ it took the cross of christ there was only one person that could do that and that was jesus christ no man no prophet no woman no child was able to redeem us it took a virgin born son of god which was jesus christ can you say amen how many believers we have in the house today amen so christ had to come and die so it doesn't matter uh you know how we tell the story and how many miracles were done there came a time there had to be a savior and as we enter into this story i want us to just enter into what has just happened judas has betrayed jesus with a kiss all the disciples have fled away they led jesus to k ephesus the high priest and they sought false witnesses they didn't find any true witnesses and so they sent him over to pontius pilate so then judas came back and he returns with the money he he realizes he's made a mistake and he brings the 30 pieces of silver back you see so many people are betraying christ the word today and there'll be a time they'll be a believer again but it'll be too late just like it was with judas so he brings the money back judas goes and he hangs himself and then barabbas was chosen to be released over jesus and pilate begins to wash his hands and says i find no fault in him the jews the jews cried out and said let his blood be upon us and our children it's amazing so many things are happening brother tom so fast right here and and a lot of prophecies are being fulfilled just in a few hours of time just like the jew saying let his blood be on us and our children and two thousand years later hitler rises up and there's a great holocaust and their the blood was now being poured out on their children because they rejected christ and 6 million jews lost their life because they said let his blood be upon our children oh brothers and sisters we must remember the things that we do today will affect our children the things that we do today will affect our children so they stripped him and they crowned him with thorns and they whipped him and they spit on him and they pulled his beard and they mocked him and they led him and they crucified him and then they nailed him to a cross they fixed him there with nails now no man how jesus say he said no man takes my life he said i lay my life down so now they have this man who's laid on a cross and they fix him with nails in his feet and they they secure him and they they actually guard him and it's really amazing because i would imagine any other man brother tom they'd just walk back and go have a meal and they've executed another malfactor but the bible says in this verse and sitting down they watched him they watched him this man the bible says in isaiah that his visage was marred beyond any other man and if he ever studied roman cruelty it was very cruel and so now they get him and they fix him on a cross but the bible says they sat down and they watched him and i began to i was reading this in my study the other day i thought why did they sit down and they watched this man that was no more than just flesh hanging on a cross and i began to think about that and i thought about this because where jesus is there's hope wherever jesus is there's life wherever there jesus is there's victory wherever jesus is there's deliverance wherever jesus is there's power can you say amen i believe he's here today in the house do you believe it amen he said i have power to lay my life down and i have power to take it up again and these people were so afraid because they physically they fixed him and they sat and they began to watch him oh because where jesus is the supernatural is where jesus is the supernatural happens amen and i tell you his last words when he's crying there he cries it is finished and his last words that's been 2 000 years ago and even though it was 2 000 years ago it still echoes through the halls of eternity it is finished it is finished this morning your salvation is paid for your healing is paid for do you believe it today he's our healer he's our deliverer it was paid for on calvary oh blessed be the name of the lord i tell you wherever he was amen when he he died there the sun refused to shine they were so ashamed of what the creation had done to the creator the sun hit his face amen the earth had a nervous breakdown and began to shake amen the bible says amen if you turn in your bibles just the next couple of chapters there the bible says when the earthquake happened the dead amen that believed in christ they began to raise out of the grave why because something was happening a supernatural god amen that was in the midst wherever christ is the supernatural happens amen he's in the house so i expect the supernatural today i expect things that are not natural to happen today i would expect people that are downcast to be uplifted i expected the to walk said bro daniel i don't see any crippled i see more people that are crippled in their spirit than i do in their body can you say man some people don't even feel like getting out of bed some don't get out of bed they just stay in bed or they get up and they take their pills and they go back to bed oh but he's here today amen to deliver a people to give them hope to give them life blessed be the name of the lord he's so wonderful he's a prince of peace he's a mighty god i was thinking about that our nation we've entered into some difficult times this uh you know the covered times and then now the the riots and they came to louisville and they said they were going to burn our city down and you know racism there has been some problems stains on our flag brother ram said the civil war was a stain on the american flag brothers fighting brothers i think the line even went through was it kentucky and tennessee where brothers if the line went through and your family's farm was spent and split some was on the north and the south you fought during the day and they had pictures we went into a museum and at night they showed these people snuck out of their camps and went from the opposite forces armies and went sat and built a fire and we sang and was around a fire together and by day they had to go back and fight it's a stain on the american flag you know and i tell you if we remove all the things that were there as christians if we had to go back in the bible and take all the stains that were on christianity and judaism i would have to throw abraham out we'd have to throw isaac out and jacob in fact every one of the patriarchs we'd have to throw them out we'd have to throw peter out we'd have to throw paul out are you with me today i mean we have stains that were back there but the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin amen and that's what i love about the book it's honesty it tells hey we're not perfect people i believe the bible says i believe it's in in in psalms there it says if god would mark the perfect man who would stand if god should mark the perfect man who would stand oh i tell you but i'm thankful for the blood of christ amen that washes away every stain are you thankful for the blood of christ we need a blood not just to cover remember the old testament bible says that the blood of goes covered sin but it never took it away it was always there amen that's why john over in the book of revelation no man was found worthy and john wept because all the blood and all the thousands and millions of lambs that were sacrificed that were just a symbol of christ coming it was all in vain and john weeps oh but he heard the voice amen said don't weep john for the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed and he looked to see a lion but what he saw was a lamb as it had been slaying from the foundation of the world amen how's the bible say in revelation 13 that there were names written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world so before this thing ever started before god said let there be light and then before that the bible says christ was slain before the foundation of the world in the mind of god he had this whole thing planned out brother tom he had it all planned out he had it planned that you would be here this morning you would hear that screaming guy from indiana probably a hundred decibels trying to get your attention say hey as brother bam said nothing's wrong he said the wheels are turning just right you just need to get in the turn you just need to get in that turn oh blessed be the name of the lord you believe that today it's turning just right say oh brother brother daniel you don't know what's going on in my family you don't know what's going on my children you don't know what's going on in our church i'm here to tell you the wheels are turning just right and if that thing causes you to get down and pray a little more then it isn't all bad is it i said if it causes you to get down and pray a little more it isn't all bad is it amen the bible says as many as he loves he chastens in rebuke be zealous therefore and repent sometimes god has to get our attention i don't know of any more greater attention getter than pain and you might be laying in the hospital looking at the at the ceiling and say lord what is it lord search me and try man you know i don't know i haven't had to covet and i don't know if it'll come my way i you know people say well i'm not gonna get us have you ever had a cold you ever had the flu yeah yeah well they say it's just the same strain so i'm not going to say it here and say i'm going to be invincible but i know this the bible says i am the lord that heals all of your sicknesses and all of your diseases so i know i have a healer amen that will not leave me amen he said i'll never leave you daniel i'll never forsake you i tell you well i don't know what it is 10 days whatever it puts me down say my we'll have a lot of prayer time we'll be listening to a lot of tapes of god's prophet oh my hallelujah the devil's probably afraid to give it to some believers because they're just going to go in their room and listen to the prophet and pray and just take their arse wrong put all these weapons of the word of god and hide it in their heart the devil's like no don't give it to them i know what they're going to do they're not going to go watch tv all the time they're going to listen to god's prophet blessed be the name of the lord so we find that these things have come to our nation i was thinking about this brother ram said in 1951 he said remember church you're living in the best days you'll ever will live in right now until jesus comes he said it shall gradually not gradually but rapidly get worse and worse have we seen that yes brother bam goes on to this talking about racism give me just a few minutes to talk about the events of our day brother ram said i've told you here in the park the pulpit martin luther king is the greatest endeavour at the colored people ever had right he said that man's going to lead thousands of them to slaughter that's right inspired by communism now you say well martin luther's gone yes but we realize that every man has a legacy that carries on behind him it was a judas did something that could not be undone he opened the door that christ was crucified so we see that martin luther king was inspired by the communism and he opened the door streets and highways are named after this man and people go back into those so he goes on to say look at in california look at the riots look at nine 19 people being killed radical he said i didn't i tell you here not long back that martin luther king would lead his people to massacre how many remembers that he said isn't them colored people he said he said it isn't those colored people he said it's them leaders stirring them up it's integr it isn't integration listen it isn't segregation or whatever you want to call it it's the devil that's right not only to the white-colored this this is to all of them it's the devil he goes on talking about martin luther king he said this man if i could only speak to him he's leading those precious people under the name of religion into a death trap where he's going to kill thousands times thousands of them he said just like hitler did over in germany he led them right into a death trap them precious germans and and and laid by the the millions piled up they're on the one another he said that's exactly the same thing remember i'm on tape you'll see it after maybe after i'm gone that's exactly what's going to happen and pressure people will die down there like flies start a revolution later start whites and colors will kill again and die like flies so it's been prophesied we see it beginning to come to pass we see the seeds of it coming here and i don't know back in louisville i forget what it was it was they have one policeman for every 700 people and they threatened to come and burn our cities down amen we need jesus christ amen we were talking the other day our pastor was talking a couple years ago we showed a film about the the the revival in finney's time and they dismissed the whole police force because there was there's no reason for the people that's the way you defund the police you get the people born again you get the lamb nature in might cause them not to write it costs to be like a lamb oh blessed be the name so we have the answer we have the answer but they don't want the answer jesus was the answer to all pilate and k ephesus problems but they didn't want the answer they were crucifying the answer so if you still have your bibles matthew chapter 27 verse 50. i don't know where that water went here it is i found it by the way they tell me to slow down sometimes chapter 27 verse 50. now we find there's much in the story here jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was ripped was rent and twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks ran and the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept a rose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now when the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus now the so here we we're at the temple he takes us to the temple it's rent from top to the bottom now he takes us back to where christ is being crucified and there's a centurion sitting there watching this man that's fixed to the cross when this unbeliever saw the earthquake and those things that had happened they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of god so now they're watching brother tom they're watching a dead corpse so to speak on a cross and when this corpse cries it is finished then the earth has a nervous breakdown the sun refuses to shine the temple the veil is written from the top of the bottom and the unbelievers stand there and say truly truly the message of the hour was the truth truly it was rights but it never said he became a believer he just acknowledged that's the truth truly that was the son of god truly that was the creator of heavens and earth and they were watching him there and i tell you as we said before one day every knee will bow and every tongue will confess but that doesn't bring salvation amen it's just an acknowledgement on up here in verse 62 this story is so wonderful not having time to read it all and now the next day verse 62 that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together into pilate saying sir we remembered that this deceiver say while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again so now they they they've scourged him they've mocked him his vintage is marred beyond that of any man they've affixed him to a tree they acknowledge he's dead they put a spirit aside blooded water runs out he's totally extinguished and they take his body down they put it in a grave and then they're still worried why because wherever jesus is there's hope there's deliverance there's power in the name of jesus and so they they begin these are unbelievers said command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he has risen from the dead so that the last air shall be worse than the first and pilate said unto them this is so amazing our that's our text this morning sitting down they watched him there he pilate says you have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can make it as sure as you can so they went and they made the sepulcher shure sealing the stone well surely they sealed it but no here we are again and set a watch outside of the stone so now they've done all of this he's totally dead he's in the grave they've sealed him but there's a promise of god that says after the third day i'm going to come out again so now the unbelievers have done all that they can to stop the oh blessed be the name of the lord everything that they can do to prevent the word of god from coming to pass and they seal the stone and then the bibles they said they set a watch to see if the word of god would come to pass or not come to pass oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah but on that third day how's it say in verse two there verse one it says at the end of the sabbath at the beginning of the dawn towards the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulcher so not only were unbelievers there amen there were believers there as well are you believer here today amen when the devil comes and says there's no hope you'll never make it out of this but god said i am the waymaker i am the way i am the truth i am life and believers come to see jesus christ oh blessed be the name of the lord the next verse says and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel the lord descended from heaven and came down and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it oh it's so amazing amen when you see all the world i was thinking about that in verse 66 the bible says they made it sure that's what the world is trying to do they're trying to make it sure that the word of god amen doesn't come to pass they've got all kinds of popular opinions and and all kinds of social media i i i say this i'm going to put a little warning here against social media because social media is run by popularity popularity and whatever's popular with the world amen how's the bible saying james you can't be he that is a friend of the world is an enemy of god so whatever the world says is popular you better run from that thing you better get away from that thing because amen the how's it that people get in there and they begin to friend the world and the and things that don't and god forbid that any christian would see somebody dressed immoral and put like on their thing oh my goodness somewhere you've got to be a christian and remember the man brother ram talks i think it's the message respects he talks about being a man he went into the garage and the man went in there and he was brother man was talking about jesus christ and the man come out said look billy you're welcome here anytime but you come in but don't bring your jesus here and he said wherever jesus christ isn't welcome i'm not welcome and brother brandon walked out of the place he said just a couple of minutes that owner that that place was walking on the curb and he slipped off the curb and fell down and a truck just came across and mashed him and he died amen and brother banner begins to teach us amen wherever you go and you know let me just say this what's happened is people have lost their identity they've lost their purpose that's why we see suicide and anxiety people have lost their purpose but when you have a purpose jesus says because i live you can live also and you go into all the world and preach the gospel and now we have a purpose and wherever i go may god help us to have a purpose to carry on the works of jesus christ i don't know if we'll have time to get to i'm going to jump a little head because now they were watching christ but he said i go away i'm gonna send my spirit to you and now they're watching you they're watching your life they're watching my life when they say look they'll never go to church we've we've covered that so much of we've covered them we've made it sure we've got them in the grade we've sealed them with laws not only social media but now we've got laws and make it sure but they still want to sit and watch you you make a little mistake or something on the job and be like what are you watching me for amen because when you stand up that's what happens when you go back here and you get baptized in this pool you lay down your identity and you come up with a new identity that's why we call ourselves christians basically that's what you say you see how how brother man tells us not to uh we don't we don't deal on emotion on an altar call of those things don't you want to see grant your granny die you'll never ever see if you don't give your heart to jesus you know what you want you did you love your granny we don't do that lord what is the new birthright says the new birth is jesus christ personally revealed to you personally revealed that you are a sinner that were born into the world and didn't have a hope in the world didn't have a prayer as the song says we're destined to go to a devil's hell but god rich in mercy left the portals of heaven to come down to die for a sinner like daniel anders and the bible says wow we were yet sinners he loved us and he died for us hope blessed be the name of the lord amen brother preaches a message called that day on calvary said every one of us need a that day on calvary will we make a trip to calvary we lay our life down and say lord i give you back my life because you laid your life down i want to lay my life down as well amen and then let the holy spirit come back and fill your life i mean that's what water baptism is all about you say hey i'm i'm going to lay down my old man and i'm going to come in and i'm going to be baptizing and then everybody watch me watch me watch me watch me watch me because that went back and got water baptized see this thing is really serious it's just sitting joining the church hey i go to brother biola's church now this thing is serious if we could ever get shot in with god it's more than a song god you really left the portals of heaven and you came down to die for me and you want to forgive me of my sins and you want to put your holy spirit back in and you want me to go in the earth and be a billboard for you yes that's what this whole plan of salvation is about and the bible sitting down they watched him because god has people on earth and the world is watching them they think they've sealed them in and there's no hope and they'll never get out of that sickness or barium oh but there's a resurrection of the christian oh blessed be the name of the lord talking about the power of the holy spirit amen in christ came out of the grave the anointed one amen the third day he rose again it's so amazing how to say in romans 8 if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwell in you it'll quicken your mortal body it'll quicken you from sin and trespasses do you believe it today we just need to get deep enough in christ and shake away from the world and stop looking at the world and try to stop trying to be like the world and say to be like jesus i want to be like jesus i don't want to be like the world i want to be like jesus how's that little song we saying turn your eyes upon jesus and i tell you those people that have turned their eyes upon jesus amen they're going to stand tomorrow they're going to stand and the next day they're going to stand see people like sister langley brother langley there and they keep standing how's the bible says over in ephesians 6 having done all to stand just stand just stand i told somebody the other day there won't be no question who has the holy spirit it'll be who those that are still standing amen because brother ram says everything that doesn't have the token of the holy spirit is dying and it will die so i say lord pour in the holy spirit lord pour it into my life god i want the holy spirit to bear preachers message how can i overcome he said you've got to keep life inside of you you've got to stay in the spirit of revival so if you see somebody raising their hands and shouting amen say what is the matter with you i'm trying to keep revival inside of me i'm trying to keep revived in my spirit oh blessed be the name of the lord that's what revival that's what bringing us a crazy guy from indiana it's down all about the brotherhood talked about michigan and all that water and the wind blowing on it said there wasn't one more drop of water in the lake it just got all the trash out got all the trash out as we go through the work and all the man it's all around the bumpers our phones and advertising and all this and we're like okay i'm kind of foggy and the bible says don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together because when you go back to the house of the lord and they open up the word of god it begins to tell you look you weren't of this world we are not of this world we're passing through where ambassadors of another kingdom stop trying to act like this world and look like this world and laying up treasures on this world we're most unrest that's corrupted where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven we're neither moth nor rust let's go up them where thieves don't break through and steal we need to get our eyes off of this world oh blessed be the name of the lord brother daniel i don't like that i don't like all this clapping and praying and singing and shouting and i don't like his long hair and profit i don't like all that stuff well hey don't worry you don't have to worry about us much longer because amen we're going to be changed in a moment a twinkling of an eye there's a people that are going to be caught up to meet the lord oh in just a few more days amen just a few few more days and we're out of here amen god has got us here and there's a lot of pressure and then each one of us are under pressure like i had that brother over here but then god puts pressure on you and i think everyone that's what the little sign i got in my office says be kind to everyone because everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about oh that girl look she cut her hair like that person they're fighting a battle you have no idea what they're fighting you have no idea what they're going to the other people you have no idea some of those older ones have no idea this lesbian and homosexual spirit and all those things that have come into the minds of the people i tell you we need to cast down reasoning listen to me cast down reasoning in everything that exalts itself above the word of god young people listen to me cast down anything that's contrary to the word of god you hear the name noah written in the bible because he was a man that took god's word i don't have any of the names of the rest of those people to die i hear moses name i don't know pharaoh and all those people that came again they died in the red sea i mean all those pop stars and all that nonsense of the world it's all going to burn one way the bible tells me that all will burn with fervent heat the earth will just be burned up but there's going to be a people are going to be raptured off the earth because they didn't fit in with all the people of the world you can't be popular with the world and popular with god oh may god help us today to get our identity back go to the house of god and realize we're strangers and pilgrims we're passing through this world this world is not my home can you say amen to that have you got your identity in a book amen in the word of god my identity is not in the world amen sisters listen to me if you try to get your identity in the world you will become depressed and backslide and go to the world but if you get your identity out of the book of god the bible says the meek and the quiet spirit is of great price in the sight of god the world thinks that's crazy but the bible says god says man that's a great value that's a great value that's like a hundred dollars if you have a hundred dollars in your wallet you don't wear it up here where people can steal it no you hide that away because it's precious and god said that's very precious you don't find that very much we were reading in devotions the other day the bible says he that findeth a wife hath found favor with god he that findeth the wife hath found favor with god it doesn't say he that finds a spouse or a companion but he that finds a wife somebody that cares about their husband and and his needs and realize the the bible pattern i know that's a whole nother sermon my wife there was a sister at the church i don't know she's got a thing where she doesn't eat certain kind of meat but she texts my wife said what is that certain recipe of chicken something said my husband really likes it so my wife texts her back the recipe and said you're a great wife why because she was trying to please her husband amen and take care of that man that's a whole nother sermon we better not go into that one brother ram said this i am now identified in the baptism of the holy ghost not something out here on the street something 40 years ago i have it right now the glory and the power of god of the forgiveness of sins amen i see him heal the sick open blind eyes see him foretell things he read the the hearts of the people he said i'm identified with him in his ministry in the last day are you identified in the ministry of god's prophet i want to be identified with that i was thinking about that over in the book of revelation the bible says i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last listen to me really close i probably said this before but if you know me you'll hear me say it again after this too when christ came he had a ministry that knew the thoughts and the intents of the people's heart we don't have time to go through it go get your husband i don't have a husband right the husband you have it's not yours but you've had five and the one you're living with now it's not yours a woman at the well everybody know that story brother bam tells it over and over again if you go back to where the brother met the angel in the little cabin in the message how the angel came numbers he showed me when brother brandon comes to discernment when they're lining up prayer lines he said i'm as helpless as the baby i don't know these people but he begins to tell those stories about the son of man coming in the bible and program tells those same stories because the same son of man came to william branham and began to do the same son of man ministry and identified the thoughts of their hearts he's the same son of man that's in the room today he still knows the thoughts of your hearts do you believe that the bible says that in hebrews the word of god is quick and sharp and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of your heart now once we we get in our minds that the word is this book and this is the expression of the word it's a part of god just like you see me but this isn't all of me i might write a song or i might do some work or brother tom's a carpenter and he'd build this and that is an ex fresh and whatever he builds that's an expression of brother tom so you say that is brother tom how many understand i'm saying the word of god is god in liberty letter form what is it peter he said the holy men of god were moved by the holy ghost all scripture is given by inspiration of god but is it saint john 1 1 in the beginning was where the word was with god and the word was god and so this is the expression of god but before it was written word it was the law goes the word of god is everybody with me i know we're a little deep in theology it's the logos of god and the bible says in peter it moved over man and they wrote it down and now we have an expression written but the logos of god this that came at his picture with brother branham brother braham just happened to be in the picture when that logos of god's picture was taken and that was called the word of god the son of man and it's in this room today and that son of man knows the thoughts of our hearts still william branham was just a channel that he would line him up and say now let's show that this logos can come to me and discern all of your thoughts and tell you and it raised the people's faith he said it won't heal you it just raises your faith to believe he's in the room but right now he's still in the the bible says he's a high priest it can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities so right now whatever you're going through if we had a prayer line line up here brother branham was here and you just wanted to go through to hear him say what you already had and need in your heart if you stand in the same presence of almighty god and believe that he's here and you will say lord this is my need today this is i'm sick of my body lord god i don't think i can go and press this battle anymore amen he's still here to meet your need to raise your faith to believe that all things are possible is it that simple brother dan yeah it's that simple he's not dead in the grave he rose from the dead he's alive he said where two or three are gathered in my name i'm gonna be right there daniel just go and preach the identification of jesus christ they shall lay hands on the sick and they're gonna recover do you believe that in my name they'll cast out devils things that haunt you and give you mind battles and all those things in your mind and tell you you're not saved you send away your day of christ you'll go to church and the gospel will be preached and those devils will leave their mind and they'll believe i am a son of god i am a daughter of god i've done wrong but the blood of jesus christ cleanses me from our sins if i confess my sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins how many believe that would you raise your hand let the devil see your hand going up yeah you know because the bible says without faith it's impossible to please god he that cometh to god must believe it's impossible if you don't believe i don't have it here today brother bam said if you came to the altar he said i want to be saved you came to the altar he said you could lay there on your face the rest of your life he said we would bring you food and water and you lay there and you would die a sinner if you didn't believe somewhere you have to start believing and say i believe the blood of jesus christ atones for all of my sins amen and you know what happens is sometimes we don't come to a breaking point i don't know where this is coming from at the time but this is really good okay sometimes we don't come to a breaking point what we really have to how can i say it deal with things we have to really deal and we fight these battles and that i got in our minds and i don't know i don't know if i i said brother forgive me that says rather than just dealing it says sister come here let's sit down this has been bothering me i want to know that i've confessed everything to you and it's all under the blood and there's nothing between us and you go back and you write in your bible this is i you know sometimes preachers they preach from experience because that happened to me and i went back and said lord i can't fight these man vitals anymore i'm going to go right to the thing i'm going to deal with this i went to the brothers brother is there anything in my and he said brother we're good i i you forgive me i forgive you i went back i wrote in my bible devil you will never push me back past this date the bible says whatsoever is not a faith is sin and so many times we go and we fight mind bottles and we never can go forward because we're fighting these mind battles i believe it's time we draw a line in the sand i'm not talking about sweeping stuff under the carpet i'm talking about coming clean and say god here it is brother if i've done you wrong i'm going to tell you i'm done or wrong but i'm not fighting this battle in my mind amen again i'm going to be a son of god and the daughter of god well i don't know what the lord's doing today but i i pray that the god will help us paul sit in that one place let's forgetting those things that are behind forgetting those things that are behind now we're human because god throws the things into the sea of his forgetfulness but we're human we're not we have a fallacy in our human nature we don't forget oh jesus say if you don't forgive men from your heart neither will your father forgive you this whole story comes up about you know so somewhere we got to forgive from our hearts sometimes people like yeah i forgive you and then 20 years later they're still telling the story like look hey wait wait you can't tell the story if you forgave him 20 years ago you'll never he come to my house and then he did this and slam the truck door but he asked you to forgive him you can't tell the story you can't tell the story anymore or you never forgave him you just got past that conversation that's what elias really say whatever they got to get past the conversation but somewhere we got to come to the place and deal with it it's real men we're not babies anymore we're soldiers of the cross we need to be men brother this i said this and i was wrong please forgive me sister please forgive me i'm going to draw a line and say i'm going on and i'll never tell anybody that story again because you came to me and asked me to to forgive you this is deep isn't it these are those mysteries that are being revealed in the last day god is coming to get a bride ready so she's without spot or wrinkle and they're ironing all these things out of our nature and out of our personality getting all of it ironed out we don't we're not filled with bitterness sometimes people come to our church the time back they came from this other church and man they brought in this baggage of everything that the people over there had done wrong to them they came in and every time you got done they spewed it out [Music] you know what what you need to do is get past wherever you came from get past wherever you came from i know that's a whole lot but the bible says be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind renewing so many people are in prison in their own mind and we have the key today if you're dealing with things from the past and believe me i don't believe in sweeping it under the carpet you deal with it if it's sin get it under the blood but forget those things that are behind us and let's walk on with god let's be christians let's be men and women of the cross of christ brother branham said i said in the backyard we branham's fight we fight and scrap it he said when we come out to the front yard we're brothers and sisters i'd like to have every preacher and a message here talking about that yeah we scrap in our emails and our phone conversations but when we come to public we're brothers and sisters in christ amen we're standing shoulder to shoulder with christ and the message of the hour is that okay that's what you all wanted to hear the preachers do anyway right it was somewhere be brothers they meant to love one another blessed be the name of the lord i gotta get back to my notes here so i was thinking i gained an hour when i come down here so i asked brother tom he gave me this battery i said that's good for 45 minutes he said oh it's good for two hours and i think he said eight hours or something six hours we're not going to go that long my friend jeff jenkins said the seat cannot endure what the mind cannot contain what the seat cannot endure but i see you all have padded pews so that gives preacher another half an hour we don't have padded pews at our church and our every i don't know every service is three hours long or something like that and they're talking about padding them like man you're giving a preacher another half an hour another hour preaching i then probably never want to pad those pieces i just added a half an hour to your sermon i was thinking about that because brother man was talking about in the old testament in the orient they have they they would take a piece of paper when they made a contract they would take a piece of paper and they would pair it they had a contract they would take the piece of paper and they would tear it and then they would give one piece to one individual and they would give another piece to the another individual and then they would bring in order for the contract to be valid they would come back and they would try to match the contract so they would give one to one individual and they'd give one to the other then when they came back they had to match so that you would bring your part of the contract back then they would bring their part of the contract back and then they had to match and we say yeah that belongs there that you all have a contract and brother bran says that he said he said god almighty took jesus christ up to calvary and there he tore it in two he said he took the body up to glory amen on the sit on the right hand of the majesty and he sent the holy ghost back and somewhere our life has to match that torn half that's why everybody's got to make their have their day on calvary that's why there should never be arrogancy and pride and bitterness in the church of god our egos ought to stop at the door i would say we probably have some very strong willed people in this room just like our church we have a lot of successful strong but you know what that stops at the door because when we come in we're brothers and sisters in christ we are nothing that's what the wedding's garment was all about everyone got the same garment there were no poor there were no rich there were no smart there were no energy we're just all brothers and sisters in christ somewhere we need to be baptized into the body by one spirit that's how you say well i'll come and get baptized now brother bryan said that put you in a local body of believers but the holy spirit coming into you baptized you into the mystical body of jesus christ that's what we have that's the problem we have too many people get baptized into a body of local believers but they never get baptized with the holy ghost and they never get baptized into that body that spiritual body they never walk that road to calvary and lay all of their life down and their pride and arrogancy like a sheep and they shave all their wool off and i got my rights but then said america is the the spirit of lady you see is people's rights i got my rights i got my rights i'm i'm african-american you owe me reparations my grandparents then you owe me some money it's people's rights but he said the real christian willing to lay their rights down and just sheer it all off he said he was led as a lamb to the slaughter and yet he opened not his mouth oh maybe we ought to take that as the evidence of the holy spirit people that can keep their mouth shut and they got a lot to say and what are you doing expressing my evidence of the holy spirit and he opened not his mouth may god help us to know when to speak and when not to speak how does it say it over in ecclesiastes there's a time to be born and a time to die there's a time to speak and there's a time to be silenced say lord give us wisdom today lord to know when to speak when did not say all those things we know about the brother because if he confessed it and is under the blood and there's only one thing that can bring something out from under the blood and that's the devil whose agent are you whose agent are you you're an agent of the devil when god says i put it in the sea of my forgetfulness and put up a no fishing sign and then you come and fish it all back out and then show her that i know i'm bored he's a christian man look at this this this i got it in the paper it's on the internet but what about the blood of jesus christ that cleanses us from all sins and you're going and doing it to destroy a son of god or a daughter of god wow i don't know where all of that is coming from but maybe that maybe that's that's that's what the holy spirit is that's why people don't like the holy ghost in their church that's why they didn't want it in the book of acts because they commenced they say anything you want to say when brother tom comes into brother daniel just do it say whatever the holy spirit tells you to say oh brother darren don't you talk about this don't you talk about this don't you talk about this oh no it's not like it hey just we believe in the gifts of the holy spirit say and ananias the fire will come out like i sold the land for so much the holy spirit said you're not lying to men you're lying to the holy spirit we need the fear of god back in the church before we walk through the door we sit in our car and say god please forgive me of my sins lord i've done this and i've done that and we go in there and brother daniel calls it out lord i don't want to walk in the fear of god and certainly that's what the communion is all about when you come that separates the men from the boys the sinners from the saints when they come in that communion and then you know the bible says he that does it and worthily takes down nation to himself so it's a real showdown time brother and said it's the showdown time as a communion judas said i'm out of here but lord help us to not run out of here but just say lord help me lord lord forgive me lord jesus and amen if the bible says if he if he chastens and rebukes you he said be zealous in there repent because that means that god loves you and i tell you you know sometimes i just spend hours in prayer saying lord help me lord i don't know which way to turn i mean that's what walking by faith is all about if you know the answers and you can see it clearly is there's no longer faith you're walking by faith lord lead me today father david said the lord is my shepherd and he leads you today and leads you tomorrow we don't know what tomorrow holds we don't know what covet 21 is we don't know but lord you know what's coming lord you just help me i just want to be surrendered in your arms amen i want to walk close to him my i've got so much here that i in my notes here because the devil has put a watch over you too because he's he knows there's some names on the lamb's book of life brother branham says this he said the only thing that kept me from being saved when i was 12 years old was a spirit hanging over me a devil saying wait a little longer oh you don't think the devil has a watch on you too raised in a christian home brother bram said you got 90 percent better chance of going right raised in a christian home and that's why the devil and you see a little christian and those kids and the devils right on they're like right there he's watching me trying to slip him up and do sometimes things happen in the church like oh that kid i no the devil's got a watch on me trying to get him because he's testing to see if their names on that lamb's book of life doesn't mean we won't make mistakes but all i tell you there is a fountain that's so filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins and sinners plunged beneath that blood lose all their guilty states tell you our songs are not just things that fill the air entertainment but they're they're revelations from god there is a fountain listen to me here because i mentioned this the other day we were talking about a church because everything brother said this he said every weapon that the christian has is invisible it's invisible and it's by faith you believe in it so it just comes to my mind when i quote that song there is a fountain filled with blood now listen to me real close because the carnal mind says okay wait a minute you all have like a bird bath a fountain and you all fill it with blood and you all get in it and run around are you with me we don't even realize that we're singing songs that if you literally take them they were like you all are a bunch of wackos you all go and get in a fountain of blood and you get in it no you don't realize that everything we do is by faith we walk by faith and not by sight so there are believers that believe that christ died 2 000 years ago on the cross of jesus christ and by faith are you listen talk about time travel the believers have always always had it and they take a trip to the old rugged cross and the blood by faith they believe that blood i confess my sins and by faith place them in that blood and god forgives me and cleanses me from all sin i praise god brother it's so good to preach about something that's intangible the world is brother bran was trying to get us to look at the invisible all the time he's looking the invisible is so much greater and we're still trying to run you know higher fiber wires up to the house the foam wire and now if you brothers are in technology it's all wi-fi you know it's all and it's all invisible it's like this you know i'm way off my subject i hope this is okay brother man said when you're born he said god takes a card and he puts it in the player to record everything in your life he said there's not much said for a first little bit until you come to the age of accountability and then god starts making you accountable for everything that you say you do it's greater than the television because it has your thoughts your thoughts and it's all recorded and he said then when you die he said he puts the card in the rack brother he you know think about this is pre-technology and the prophet's calling it a card he said and now we got sd cards and you put your trail cams out you pull out hey what happened at that time you stick it in there some of you have you know you you you do this and you don't even realize it you all maybe you have the cloud like i'm into i have a business so we used to save everything on our hard drive now we save it in the cloud we save it out there and we if you're a computer person there's redundancy as a service you save it on this one if that one goes down we have it on another server and we just call it the cloud because we as little mortals we don't understand where it is but it's out there and i believe it because i have all my family pictures out there and whatever i just go to the cloud or i go right here i log in i put my name listen to me i put my identification and then i'm able to access everything that's up there and man is just catching up in technology to where god has already been he's already been there the bible says there will come a day when all the sun man will speak and all that were in the grave will come forth and the books john didn't he's seeing all this happen and saw the great video and all these people come to each other he didn't know i'll just call it a book it's the only thing i know to do that keeps a record is we keep stuff in there and there's a record he called it a book and the books were open and every man was judged according to his works see we do it every day we save our phone our pictures to the cloud and they go i don't know where it is i just go back in here and it comes back down i get it's in the cloud in other words it's there and it can be recalled at any time you see where the judgment will be at that day when god will just call on those people into the church service oh lord i never did that lord i what are you talking about god you sealed all right hey we got all the time in the world i made time we are eternity now everybody sit still for a minute we got some i want you to see this you go on remember that service back in 2020 when you were there you just plays the video maybe 15 or 20 seconds that person sitting in church god knocking at their heart ah i want to grow up i want to have a little fun and go on you wonder what hell will be playing that 15-second clip over and over and over i mean i had that opportunity to give my heart to christ to put my sins in the sea of god's forgetfulness imagine hell i was so close i was so close i was so close i missed it that's why the bible says today if you hear his voice don't harden your heart amen when i tell you when god puts my record in there's going to be all kinds of blank spots in it like oh you come up right here and then you see this blank spot and then you kind of and then there's all these blank spots you know what that is that's the blood of jesus christ that cleanses us from all sins oh hallelujah you can go back and watch my life because the blood i've confessed my sins oh praise be to god and there's blank spots on my tape because the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all a double l all of our sins oh blessed be the name of the lord i'm so glad to preach about something that's more powerful than the internet oh the internet's really powerful and i've probably said this before but man you can go back to people's lives 20 years that's what they say when you hire somebody they don't go and call your references because those all the people you ask to say good things about you they go straight to the internet and they type in who is daniel andrews and then you pull up all this stuff like yeah we don't need to hire that guy they say that i forget it is 80 of the people that hire people go to social media to see who is this person who what are they really all about oh blessed be the name of the lord so you can't hide from that but i tell you the blood of jesus christ that comes and cleanses the center it's more powerful than the internet and then the world goes back and tries to clean it up they pay thousands and thousands of dollars to clean up their past that's on the internet they pay people you go try to clean it up will you clean that up but we have an agent called the blood of christ and sinners plunged by faith into that blood they lose all their guilty stains well you say brother daniel they can still find it on the internet and the people our church still knows you know what i say to that who cares who cares if jesus christ has forgiven me of my sins then who cares who cares that's really i got a sign in my office and it says there is one man that i have to please jesus christ oh we need to get our identity back every day i wake up in the morning and i have well you should do this you should listen you know your critics for the time just stop trying to please them all you'll never please them all there's just too many you can't you never and you know let me just say this i hope i'm not over time give me a few more minutes and the more you try to do the more you get yourself out there is the more people will criticize you if you just sit here and do nothing man he didn't scream he didn't wasn't long didn't you start doing something for god and now there's go ahead and write that card to your pastor and say brother tom i appreciate you for 30 years whatever you've been preaching and trying to do what's right god bless you period don't worry about the punctuation if the stamp matches and all that nonsense just send it do something for the lord every one of us have something we can do for god every one of you listen to me young people every one of you have something unique that god put in you that nobody else in the world has and god wants that to be used in his kingdom we have people in our church young boy 11 years old perfect pitch i think hey i like what what key is that in he'll tell you right boom boy he listens to me hey i just turned around what's up he tell you exactly it's perfect pitch it's a gift and god has put gifts in every one of the bodies let me challenge you what are you doing with your gift for jesus christ let me say this what are you doing with your gift for jesus christ and then i'll preach a whole story on the talents remember the man who got five he made ten man that got two he made four then there was a guy that had one and he went and buried it so we know the whole story going through it but when they asked a man that had one he said look i knew you was a steer man and listen to me real close right here he said i feared unless i would lose it so let me ask you today that gift that you have that nobody else has it might be beauty you might just be the most beautiful person in the world and people look at you and you can either use it to sway them and make take men in a perverted way or you can stand there and be dressed in whole he's like man look at that beautiful woman and she's dressed holy and she point people to jesus christ but the bible says because of fear this person wouldn't use their talent you might have a great talent to sing but you're afraid to sing in church because somebody else has told you when you were young and they scarred you and you live under that fear but the bible says perfect love cast out fear amen perfect love casa he said fear has torment and torment you i know i should use that for god but they said something like that but perfect lord lord i am unique you gave me this i have a lot of faults i have a lot of failures but lord you did give me this and i can use this for your glory i tell you i think you you see songwriters come out you'll see a few little children writing poems you see people that love god and maybe they all you got to smile use it there's so few people got them upside down they just turn it over be a smile so i challenge you today use whatever you have for the glory of god i don't know why you all are pulling all of this out of me but the bible says be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind if you've created your own prison then it's time to get out of the prison i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i don't have time to preach about complexes brother ram talks look in the computer looking up brother and talking about complex he said all of us have complexes every one of us do we have complex and so brandon how do i overcome a complex you know what he says so powerful he said do the opposite just do the opposite nobody loves me and we loved you just take the outfit man everybody loves me i can't believe it brother tom everybody loves me it's amazing everybody loves me that's just hey i love you all too hey god bless you everybody's hurting your own living this fear you've got an inferiority complex you know what i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god god left all of heaven came down and died for me he thinks i'm great he thinks i'm worth something blessed to be the name of the lord and he gave me this union unique talent and i'm going to use that for god and you're not going to stop me i'm not going to let fear stop me blessed be the name of the lord devil's got a watch set on you and when the angels come and roll away from the roll away the stone maybe that little stone that's been there on your life but the holy spirit maybe this morning is rolling away that stone maybe the devil said like i got them so seared in there man it was their dad when they were just little kid told them they were stupid and they always lived in this hole but the holy spirit is bringing you out of that you know people talk about predestinated seeds god never predestinated seeds to stay in a package he he predestinated those seeds to be planted and to grow and manifest whatever the seed was supposed to manifest i say today let's start growing let's start manifesting what god wants us to have so what will it be brother daniel i know it'll be love and joy and peace and long suffering and gentleness oh that's a really good one gentleness i wish everybody get a real baptism of the holy spirit and get real manifestation of gentleness wouldn't that be so nice in that hard nature like hey kid's getting out of here and whip y'all oh well daddy you need more of the holy ghost well brother daniel's talking about the gentleness daddy you need that brother man said sweeten your temper with prayer sweeten your temper oh this is okay the bible says as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god so you really have to be careful when you come to a real holy ghost field church and let the holy spirit say hey say anything you want to me lord i fall short i want to be the bride lord speak to me today i was in the hotel and we're in there i woke up really early and i heard these people on the hall and they were ah and you know what the holy spirit brought to my mind brother bram said don't fuss don't fuss he said if your family fusses he said don't you fuss he said the holy spirit doesn't fuss david said thy word i've hid in my heart that i might not sin when i get in a situation tomorrow something might come up and the believers and this in the holy spirit says don't fuss don't fuss remember temptation brother man tells his cure for temptation my brother danny man these women this pornography just said and there's a brother daniel fashion i can't even hold my tongue brother dan you wouldn't believe i'm so tempted i know that nobody knows about it and i could just tell him and it just really made me feel good and you're tempted you know what brother said how to overcome temptation this is branding when you get people right to that point and then he said just walk away from it just walk away from it said if a snake's right there a little bird flies snake come up and just cobra snake he just does this and you get meds and then the snake bites you i don't overcome that just walk away from it oh brother dana come on man that's so simple that's so oh that's childish i don't i don't want to walk away from it that's our problem right there that's it's not the temptation it's something in you that doesn't want to walk away from it so it's not that thing out there is you have a desire and you keep going to it because the solution is really easy just turn and get away from that girl get away from that boy get away from whatever is keeping you out of church and just say i'm going to get away from that thing because there's nothing more important than the kingdom of god in the church of god in the house of god that's really simple but the bible says you'll know the truth and the truth will make you free and so now it's not the temptation oh it's something in me that desires and now we can deal with the real problem is something in me lord there's something alive inside of me that shouldn't be there lord and if you come today i'm not going to go in a rapture i pray god that it would die inside of me lord take it out of me let me climb up on the altar and have my day on calvary let me be a living sacrifice that's what paul was talking about his desires a living sacrifice after six hours four thousand years of limbs and cut in their throats god said i i hate them i want some living sacrifices i want people who are willing to lay their life down and say lord not my will that sure will be done that's what our great master jesus christ said he said not my will lord let your will be done oh blessed be the name of the lord because people are watching you i've got a quote here a lot of preachers use it brother said that there'll be a in the last days it is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age my wife and i were talking about that together we're sitting in a restaurant it's amazing i said a few more minutes up in kentucky a few is a little thank you so we're sitting in a restaurant we're talking about this you believe the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by god everything you do is not my chance god has it all ordered in your life sometimes i preach to myself god you've got it all ordered you just have to take the next step lord i'm walking by faith every day you know as you get in a place god has you in a place and people come to you somebody come to me the other day said this is the will of god for your life and every day i'm just like okay whatever i can make that to happen in in enough in a two-minute conversation i can tear down everything that i've built for 50 years that's why we as you get older people walk softer and they're slower and young people like ah come on make a decision how are we going to go eating like who's going to be there is it going to be unbelievers going to be eating with us backslidden people going to influence my family and dad starts walking a little slower past or something oh we ought to just do this the pastor starts walking a little slower so my everybody's listening i don't see anybody sleeping this way hopefully the holy spirit will come down your aisle and speak to you that's why people walk away is because the holy spirit isn't given free reign that he can speak to every one of us right where we are each one of us mom holding a baby you're an individual and dad and young people they're going through trials but if we'll let the holy spirit just come say lord speak to us lord god help us lord i can't make it another day without you i need you father i've got another plaque on my wall at home one day i'll take a picture of all the things on my wall and just go preach a sermon on it another one that said god never intended his children to be self-sufficient he did he he raised them to be dependent on him i've got three sons and i raised them to be independent i don't want him coming to me to ask me how to change a tire look you're a big boy go do it i don't ever had girls i don't know hey you called that don't you get out there and get on the side of the road a girl you call me no stay in your car i'll be right there but a boy is like no get out there and get your hands dirty and get that i raised him to be independent but god didn't raise his children to be independent jesus said except you become as a little child you can't enter the kingdom of heaven i think some of us have just thought we growed up in a kingdom of god and god said you can't enter the kingdom of heaven as a grown-up you got to enter it as a little child lord i need you or will you please hold my hand i cannot make it we get in this routine oh we're just going to church and just another service like lord i can't make it i need you lord i don't know this covet they keep changing the rules in the lord what should we do lord give us wisdom they told us they're going to come and burn the city down there and our church is right there on the streets like lord what do we do we need you lord i need you i don't want to walk a day without you so my wife and i were sitting in the restaurant and we were talking about this quote the final voice to the final age i'm always like what are you i mean we're talking about it you think really think sisters are going to have a pulpit and a preaching land we're talking so we get up from there we drive to this place we're doing some landscaping and i i heard more flower names in the last couple months and i ever want to know in the rest of my life my wife wanted to know it and so the bible says dwell with him according to knowledge and if she wants to hear flower names i better learn flower names so we go to walnut ridge and we go in there and this african-american man comes out with my wife and she starts walking with her and he says you know what i know you she said i don't know you don't know me she said he said no i i've seen you in the mall i've seen you dress with your long hair and your dress he begins to talk to her about the lord and the things of god so all of a sudden we realize that a voice is maybe not the voice of your mouth but it might be the voice of your life remember abel was dead and he was in a grave and god comes to cain and said where's your brother i said i don't know where my brother is he said but his voice crieth the blood his blood crieth from the earth he was dead but his voice was crying through the earth and i believe the bride is going to have a voice and it won't be so much a spoken word as it will be the life that is lived out people are watching you oh they'll never make it they'll never make it they're watching you but there's a resurrected christ that's come out of the grave blessed be the name of the lord i'm gonna read this quote i'm gonna try to close brother ram said i think it's a very fine example for we parents today is to set an example before our children you'll live your best and worst at home i think our lives or our children might not exactly act like they're noticing it they are noticing it don't you ever think they're not because they're watching we were kidding we were some of the young people not long back and they went through all the people in the church the brothers and how they prayed and they mimicked them like they prayed just like this is how this brother prayed this this is how the ron spencer preaches how my brother john says amen hallelujah they went through all the brothers they're listening they're watching you we had a brother at our church called brother mills and here we go hey he said it on the tape brother and refers to him we when he prayed we never closed our eyes because he'd take his fingers and go hey hey we watch him do like that and it's been 50 years 40 years ago and i still remember his life is still speaking to me we're watching one another brother ram said not only the children are watching but our neighbors are watching not only the neighbors are watching but all of your you're associated with watching you the people at your church are watching you the people you do business with in the markets are watching you after your confession this is so amazing open up your heart right here brother i'm going to say this and we should always try to reflect christ in everything that we do should always try to reflect christ in what we do now that right there will cure road rage we should try to reflect christ in everything that we do may god help us that when we leave this service in a few minutes the word of god will still speak to us it's not a dead letter it's alive it's alive the word of god is quick and powerful and it's a discern and when we leave we hide that in our heart and it begins to speak to us and we get out there in school or something happened in the business deal probably god said don't fuss i don't know hey we'll work it out somehow and you begin to back away from it i can't control my mouth well if you stopped five minutes before all that happened you would have controlled your mouth so may god help us and sometimes you get in situations i don't know why the holy spirit's bringing us down this road sometimes you get in situations maybe church situations and this and that you could say a lot i've sat in rooms with people for i don't know maybe minutes with silence because you know the power of what you say in your word and we should walk softly and weigh our words and use wisdom and not say something that you have to come back two years later and say i'm sorry i shouldn't have said that may god help us to slow us down in this fast-paced world that he slows us down and say lord help me lord guard my lips david i think it was job said i put a i think one he said he put a gate on his eyes but put a guard on our lips lord help us i was thinking that ephesians 5 15 says see then you walk circumspectly not as fools but wise hey man a few musicians will come one time i was preaching i thought you know some of those brothers they preach those dynamic sermons and man you get the camp and everybody's running like i'm like lord i'll never be able to do that because it seems like every time i preach it just comes down and it's quiet and it's sober but you know that's the way the great judgment is the bible says judgment will become at the house of god and we're being judged by the word of god the bible says that the bride made herself ready and so we're sitting in the judgment house of god and god is saying there is mercy we need to accept it in our lives i was thinking about that little story you've probably heard it there was a man he was laying in bed or he was praying and he said lord i want to thank you i haven't lied today he said i haven't lost my temper with my wife i haven't chewed out my kids i haven't cheated on my taxes he said but i'm getting ready to get out of bed lord and i'm gonna need your help today you know that's where it needs i don't know if the pressure is that great in your life before i ever get out of bed the devil is right there and i'm saying lord i need you if you come in the pressure in my life you'll hear me say god help me at four or five o'clock in the morning and say god help me i need you because the devil is so powerful but i met a greater force which is jesus christ and i learned a long time ago that if you yield to this black dog he'll destroy you he'll destroy your life he'll destroy your testimony he'll destroy everything about you and we come to the house of the lord to learn wisdom and when the enemy comes in like a flood the lord will raise up a standard against him you come to the house the lord said brother daniel i don't know but you may be facing something this week or next week and you come today and the holy spirit says hey put this in your arsenal put this and just we're sitting here maybe an hour and a half something like that you put all this like i was saying if you get covered you lay in bed and you load all that word up and now we slow down and lady will see it for an hour and a half and god puts all this word inside of us because he knows you're going to need those bullets when you're going to go out there and the enemy comes in like this and there's a scripture comes in like this oh we got wisdom in the body of christ a little wisdom yeah hey i'm not gonna fuss with you hey i'm sorry i don't fuss anymore i used to you used to be able to really get me but you don't get me anymore all that temptation you know the holy spirit came into me that sunday and filled my life and i just walk away from that thing now i just get away from it i know what it'll take me that snake will bite me it'll paralyze my my christian walk in five minutes everything that i've built in the testimony will be taken from me i'm not going to go down that road i'm going to stay close to christ can you feel that real gentle spirit how many can feel that you just out of my flesh i don't care about see taste there's a spiritual man and it feels that presence of god i think paul said it like this he said he said the love of god constrains me it's pulling at my heart the bible says it's not his will that any should perish it's not god's will that any would go to hell and you come in the presence of god and you just feel that pulling like go this way go this way go this way let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord i've done my best to be a vessel that you could speak through father [Music] i know someday lord i will be in judgment for the words that i've said [Music] and lord i've done my best to point these souls to calvary [Music] they wouldn't get a plane tick getting fly to israel somewhere but by faith lord they would travel they would place their sins at the foot of the cross and say lord forgive me of my lord i tell them about a scripture that is greater than any thing of the world lord we cast down reasoning and anything that would tell us the word of god is not true and your word says if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins i wonder was every head bowed if there would be someone and say brother daniel god's dealing with me and i want to raise my hand and say god forgive me today god bless you god bless you god bless you real men and women god bless you young people god bless you god bless you yes be honest yes god bless you god sees your heart he sees your hand it's just an expression of your heart maybe there's someone that's away from god you say brother daniel today i'm coming back to jesus christ i'm going to surrender my heart completely back to maybe you've got tears in your eyes it's okay the bible says a broken and a contrite heart god will never despise it he'll never turn away a broken heart a contrite heart and say lord please forgive me lord jesus please help me maybe there's someone that says brother daniel i don't have the power to walk away from that temptation i need the holy ghost and i want god to fill me with the holy ghost and you'd like to raise your hand say god fill me with the holy spirit god bless you god bless you yes lord fill me with the holy spirit give me that power you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you hallelujah maybe there's somebody sick in your body you'd like to raise your hand and say look god the bible your word says by your stripes i can be healed and i want god to heal me god bless you god bless you god bless you yes god's a healer he said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover they shall anoint with oil and pray the prayer of faith and the lord shall raise them up god bless you amen if you've raised your head won't you just stand to your feet now i want you just stand to your feet let's talk to the lord hallelujah yes let's just lift our hands to him this morning heavenly father you see the hands that were raised believers that have responded to the word of god you said he that cometh to god must believe they've raised their hands they've responded to you and i pray the holy spirit would come to them now and let faith rise in their heart father you're our healer lord you're the deliverer lord let the demons sit and watch father but the word of god cannot be held in the grave lord jesus hallelujah the word that we've hid in our heart lord may it come forth this morning lord may there be a resurrection and a newness of life may there be a transforming of the mind father that people will come out of that grave that they've lived in that fear that torments may they come forth to live as sons and daughters of god in this presence lord send your angels lord lord your your word says that the angels are encamped around about those that fear you lord we're fearing the name of jesus christ in reverence come among us now lord jesus i pray in a special way and touch our hearts we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen there's a little song what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see i wonder if we could sing it i don't know what key it is sister amen let's just worship the lord [Music] upon his face the one who saved me by his grace and when he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land what a day glorious day that will be i'll think about this oh there'll be no sorrow there and no no more sickness no pain and no more [Music] who died for me all think about it what a day glorious day [Music] that will be all singing from the bottom of your heart this morning oh what a day that will when be jesus i shall see [Music] when i look upon his face i want to save me by [Music] what a day a glorious day that will be is it all right for a preacher to be real you know brother rem said preachers are just like you they have their trials they only they have to live it and preach it we just have to live it you know i have to stand up here and preach faith sometimes i preach to myself the devil comes in my mind i have to preach faith because it's the only way out it's the only hope this world has is faith in jesus christ i've looked at all the maybe education maybe business maybe money there is no hope outside of jesus christ and then when you think about the hope there is no hope that you can wake up one day song says there's no more heartache there and there's no more pain there there's no more suffering my sister rachel here her father's in a in a home and had covenant and take him back to the home and they only looked through a window and see him talked to my friend yesterday his wife had a surgery she's in a place he said once a month he said i get to look to a window that's 60 feet away and see my wife sitting there for 15 minutes they put us on a phone that's time delayed and we just see each other maybe you got a sickness maybe you've got an illness in your body you're like i don't know how to get past this there's only one hope and that's jesus christ are we real people we don't live in a fairy tale we live in a real world and sometimes it brings tears to your heart sometimes there's things we've done in our past that affect us maybe little scars or disappointments and you have that little disappointment sometimes there's handicaps in your life and that little handicap is what keeps you close to christ paul said lord three times he said lord will you take away this handicap my eyes brother em said after the light blinded me come back he had to write in big letters he said thrice he said i besought the lord and god said my grace is sufficient for you that is a little thorn in your flesh that will keep you humble sometimes god puts things in our life to keep us humble [Music] prophet angel meets him said i'll be with you he said no man will stand before you all the days of your life how a pride could come then he goes in he said i was getting my hair cut brother talking to a man about hunting he said he reached back and got a bottle dumped him sulfuric acid carbolic acid dumped it on his head and he lost his hair so now he's he's bald headed seventh grade education he goes into those brothers and he said we sit at a table and he has he has those brothers his friends who were educated said you sit behind me if they start talking theology in terms he said i'll kick you under the table and you say the word because i don't even know what they're talking about and god puts a little handicap in a prophet's life he sits there before the people crying i'm as helpless as a baby unless he comes and god puts those little handicaps in every one of our life so that you'll walk close to christ you won't get proud but you'll just walk real humble lord help us he puts that in ministers lives that make him walk real soft like lord i need you lord i need your help sometimes he puts sickness in our life to keep it like the little lamb that keeps going astray puts a little sickness actually broke his leg allowed him to hurt so that he would walk close to the shepherd so the shepherd would carry him somehow i just say this we need to walk close to the shepherd today it's the only thing that's going to get us out of here is jesus christ let me provoke you let me encourage you if you maybe you're a young person hey i got talents i got abilities let me tell you the word of god says the way of a transgressor it's hard it's a hard life out there that's why so many of those people that the world thinks is successful commit suicide and take this kanye west or whatever this guy's here somebody said he's a billionaire millions and millions of dollars and he thinks he's always great goes out there and tries to become a christian business christian rap out in joel steen's church and all this stuff and now he's he's losing his mind and just going through divorce the the kardashians and i don't know these people don't watch them just hearing their names and you watch because the bible says the way of a transgressor it's hard and you see michael jackson he gets on phenomenon and takes his own life uh elvis presley and all these guys and they it looks so good katy perry looks like she got a great career she started out singing christian songs she wanted to be the next amy grant of christianity and her album was a flop she goes on you see it on youtube she said i'll sell my she told the devil i'll sell my soul to you if you'll make me successful and satan has made her successful to the world but she's lost her mind you know what's greater than learning from your mistakes is learning from somebody else's mistakes so i don't want to go down that road i see what that does to a marriage i'm not going to do that i see what that does to a young person i'm not going to do that i'm going to stay close to christ amen because a christian has a hope in jesus christ oh don't you love the lord just feel that little holy spirit if you need a feeling of the holy spirit it's just that something that you feel outside it's coming and living on the inside of you and sealing you and never leaving you and it's always with you wherever you go you get close to somebody and the holy spirit will say don't do that get away from them be like okay and you learn to jesus the bible says that jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered you just overcame i'm going to do it anyway little dove just steps back go ahead you can talk and be fussy but i'm not going to be with you and you go through a couple days grinding through that you know lord i need the holy spirit i need you back lord brother i said it didn't change you you're not a sheep he said just the dove took his flight he's up on the limb you repent and the dove will come back of the holy spirit we have a hope of a christian let's sing that verse it's page 204 i don't know if you have books there is come in a day
