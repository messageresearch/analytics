[27:39] it's been a while since I've been up
[27:42] here soon
[27:46] so anyways um let's start in prayer
[27:50] foreign
[27:51] Lord God I pray that that you'll just
[27:53] have control in this service or whatever
[27:55] I pray that you'll you'll speak to each
[27:58] and every one of our hearts Lord I've
[27:59] heard that
[28:00] that you'll you'll help us to grow
[28:03] Closer to You Lord I pray that that not
[28:05] one of us will leave this building
[28:07] unchanged sword untouched Lord I pray
[28:09] that that you'll you'll just come in
[28:12] such a powerful way Lord tonight Lord
[28:14] and I pray that
[28:17] that you'll you'll heal those that are
[28:20] sick Lord I pray that and and Lord I
[28:23] believe that you are able to heal those
[28:25] that are sick Lord and those that are in
[28:27] need Lord I pray today that you'll
[28:29] you'll meet each and every need Lord I
[28:31] pray in Jesus name amen
[28:34] all right turn with me if you will to
[28:37] Ephesians
[28:39] 5.
[28:52] Ephesians 5 and we'll start with verse
[28:56] 15.
[29:02] see then that you walk circumspectly not
[29:07] as fools but as wise Redeeming the time
[29:10] because the the days are evil
[29:14] wherefore being not unwise but
[29:17] understanding what the will of the Lord
[29:19] is
[29:21] amen may God add His blessings to be in
[29:23] the word you can be seated
[29:27] so what I want to speak on tonight is
[29:33] well the inspiration I had is
[29:37] it's kind of something that I struggle
[29:39] with a lot it's
[29:41] um
[29:43] being stuck on social media and just
[29:45] keep scrolling and not not focusing on
[29:49] something that's more important like
[29:50] even if it's like work or something like
[29:53] that
[29:55] and
[29:56] and I I believe that it's something that
[30:00] happens a lot in the world and it a lot
[30:02] of us Christians
[30:04] especially the younger ones that now the
[30:07] older people maybe not so much but
[30:11] but I've seen seen in this uh
[30:15] this picture of um and that we haven't
[30:19] changed much and it just shows a bunch
[30:20] of people read newspapers in in the
[30:24] um in a train
[30:27] everybody reading newspapers now now you
[30:30] see everybody looking at phones
[30:33] now I want to read this uh let's see
[30:37] this article
[30:40] that I read
[30:42] see it's called a drift in Godless media
[30:46] for decades most Christians have simply
[30:49] drifted into the Embrace of the patterns
[30:51] of the world in the way we spend our
[30:53] evenings and our weekends with the
[30:56] exception of a couple hours of church on
[30:58] Sunday at first this drift seems
[31:00] harmless because there was such an
[31:03] overlap between the supposedly Christian
[31:05] worldview and the products of the media
[31:07] and entertainment Empires now that
[31:11] that's why I was thinking about
[31:13] um
[31:15] it's it's so easily it's so easy to have
[31:20] access to anything sitting straight from
[31:24] your phone down
[31:27] um from let's see in my notes it says
[31:30] um
[31:32] well I was listening I heard this song
[31:35] Because be careful little eyes but you
[31:38] see be careful little ears while you
[31:40] hear I believe that that means a lot
[31:41] especially especially to the younger
[31:43] generation and that's what what has been
[31:46] going on in the world is the
[31:49] is that they're trying to bring up
[31:53] um
[31:55] they're trying trying to especially get
[31:57] hold of the younger generation because
[31:58] they're even more naive and more easily
[32:01] accept things
[32:07] yeah in this generation in a time that
[32:10] you can have any world view and make any
[32:14] search at your fingertips from a phone
[32:18] now this may say this sounds a little
[32:20] bit like my first sermon that I was
[32:22] preaching
[32:23] um
[32:26] foreign
[32:27] detached from the world's patterns of
[32:29] entertainment the overlap was not as
[32:32] great as we thought it was at least I I
[32:35] think I I really blew it but
[32:39] got hard sick or offended
