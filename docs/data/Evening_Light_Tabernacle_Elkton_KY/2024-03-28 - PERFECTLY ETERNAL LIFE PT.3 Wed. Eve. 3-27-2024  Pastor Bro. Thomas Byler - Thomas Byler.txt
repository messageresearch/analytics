God that we wouldn't go out those doors the same but that we would go out better Lord and also those streaming tonight we ask God that you'll just bless each one that's listening in Father may they receive a blessing from you for we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen we want to continue our series Amen on perfectly eternal life amen perfectly eternal life this is my third service and I still haven't got to my message so Amen to quote amen where I got it so that's just how the Lord's anointed it amen amen so I really like when God does that don't you amen because it just makes a a world of difference amen when he comes when he anoints amen and just opens up so to speak the windows of Heaven amen pours out a blessing amen and so we're trying not to go too fast amen and I'm U amen going to try to uh go to a second part amen I know one Sunday we talked about eternal life amen uh where it come from how far back it goes of course we know a mean towards the end of brother brenham's Ministry he talked about unless you are a seed Gene I mean remembers him talking that way brother man got real specific unless you're part of the seed Gene of almighty God Amen you're not going to have eternal life it takes being a part of God Amen that right amen and that of course we know is his holy ghost that's the seed Gene how many believe that's the seed Gene of God Amen and uh not only that but also you haven't been in his mind is also a part of him because his thoughts are a part of him isin't that right amen and so but specifically trying to be direct is of course A C Gene of almighty God and that means that before the world was ever created you was already there you was already there we'd say we'd like to say he was there from the beginning but no there was no beginning right and amen because there was no beginning in him and so you always was there amen I don't know if that Thrills you but I think I really think that that's going to Thrill me when I've been there 10,000 years could we say a million it doesn't matter how long amen you know and I I I truly believe that amen sometimes what we lack is the thrill of this amen didn't brother bam say don't ever lose your enthusiasm Amen in other words the thrill that comes with it amen and and and what I mean by Thrill is that it it means something to you amen amen it really means something to you and so I'm so glad for that amen can I just say a little more you know you are the mystery you are the mystery of God revealed how many beli that amen Christ in you the hope of glory is the mystery of the whole thing revealed praise the Lord amen amen God is good isn't he all right we prayed Let's uh go if you will to St Matthew amen St Matthew amen we want to basically you know and I got to thinking of this because I thought about eternal life and speaking on eternal life and what it is amen and brother brandom of course talking about Jesus Christ never lived for himself that being perfectly eternal life and so forth and that's where I the core of my message begin to come amen um but as I think about it you know brother bam I think he preached about three messages on uh the Holy Ghost series how remembers that Holy Ghost series am man he also spoke and I never even really thought about that until I got into this but really that's what this kind of more or less is is a holy ghost series since it has to do with eternal life amen and I feel like the Lord is revealing to me are supposed to be dead amen dead and in order for Christ's Life to Live we have to be dead amen it dead to self okay Matthew the 7th chapter and we'll begin with kind of talking about a mixed tree or somebody that claims to be something that they're not it's actually amen somebody professing something that they're not Matthew 7 and we'll begin with verse 15 beware of false prophets which come unto you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves and then Jesus says ye shall know them by their fruits amen do men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but every corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is heed down and cast Into the Fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated this morning I want to add a verse into this scripture if I could a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit and neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit but a tree can look like it is a good fruit tree but not be a good fruit tree ain't that right that's why he warned you about false prophets they come you come to you they look like sheep but inside they're not amen how many believes that it's important what you are on the inside amen this is kind of Amen this is this type of preaching this message as I look at it amen is we're conditioning ourselves for the Rapture how many beli that's what we're doing we're conditioning ourselves for the Rapture because we're living so close now we better be getting ready because we realize that how many believes that if you're going to go in the Rapture you're going to be ready to go in the Rapture and if you're not going to go in the Rapture you're not going to be ready to go in the Rapture amen and God is going to have his people ready to go in the Rapture amen therefore I believe that uh the ministers the five-fold ministry amen amen is going to be bringing something that will be for the edifying of until we all come to the knowledge of Christ and to the stature of the fullness of the measure of him amen so praise the Lord now I just wanted to read that looking at a tree of course we realize that we come you and I as we mentioned uh amen Sunday I believe it is we either come from one of two trees one of two trees one of them was Adam and the other one was the serpent amen the only true daddies that there is in the world Amen praise the Lord and one was the son of God and the other of course amen now I want to go with the help of the Lord now let's look at this for just a minute Amen in First Peter no not first Peter but second Peter second Peter and I didn't know just don't still don't know just how far we'll go tonight but we'll just go as far as the Lord leads amen but we want to deal with a little bit on the second part I told you and that would be dealing a little bit with faith amen let's deal with faith with the help of the Lord amen let's read uh from the beginning of the chapter one second Peter second Peter chapter 1 Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them who have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and our Lord Jesus Christ we could stop there for a while couldn't we I'm Grace and peace be more and Grace better and you will understand peace better amen according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him who ha called us unto glory and virtue whereby are given to us exceeding and uh great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and tot knowledge and we're going to stop there amen like I said I don't want to go too fast on this amen but I want to dwell for a little while tonight with the help of the Lord having escaped I mentioned a little bit already but having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust amen Ephesians back to Ephesians if you want it's just a very familiar scripture but I want to read it because it's one of our foundational scriptures amen Ephesians 2 I believe it is two and verse 8 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God now it says that we have have escaped the corruption that is in the world now how many knows uh let's first of all we know that brother bam taught us that the the flesh has what in the greatest battle ever fought we have 10 senses five In the Flesh and five in the spirit isn't that right 10 now I want to call them 10 chains tonight maybe something Ain never heard before 10 chains we're Bound by 10 chains amen amen because if you'll remember what he taught in in the battle is that you what your the flesh is see taste feel hear and smell is that right amen he says and if these aren't controlled by the Holy Ghost isn't that right then they're controlled by the devil and they'll mislead you first of all those senses and all that outside of a regenerated person filled with the Holy Ghost that's the corruption that is in the world is that right because the works of the flesh according to Galatians Galatians 5 we know the works of the flesh is adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulation wrath Strife sedition all of these now won't even go all of them but all these things are manifestations of the Flesh and they're chains chains that need to be [Music] broken amen now Peter said you and I have escaped the corruption that is in the world through us is that right we have escaped it we've gotten out of it amen it's like we were tied down in the the pawn shop ain't that right we had chained we were all chained up amen because believe me if you ain't governed by the Holy Ghost you're going to be governed by your feelings by the things that you see feel hear or smell or your conscience or your memory or your reason or your affection and your emotions is actually channels the prophet of God call it that you know you can't trust and is that right you can't trust any of those amen because if those aren't governed by the Holy Ghost they'll mislead you mislead you every time we were born that way born with those shackles and I want to say that God by his grace amen how many know it's Amazing Grace how sweet this sound amen that gave you the key he thought to speak said here Tommy catch that right he pitched you the key laying on that bed or wherever it is in that jail he pitch you the key said here is the key to unlocking every one of those chains amen because we're saved by grace through faith Paul said now we have access I just got to read it right because I can't remember all that good but Romans 5 Paul said it this way he says by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wo how many know it takes Sav by faith and we receive the grace of God through the faith of God that he has given you something that God gives you the world I want to say tonight the world has not escaped you and I took both that key amen oh I can sometimes I can oh when we're having a service and the Holy Ghost anointing comes down and people begin to break free from their feelings or amen their bad day that they had or their bad week at the head amen and all of a sudden people go to scream I can almost hear chains dropping the chains of Darkness the chains of starchiness the S chains of lukewarmness Amen it begin to fall off because that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost anointing when it comes it breaks the chains when the revelation of the word comes and hits you anden it breaks the chains amen and sets you free all because of the key of faith I I believe faith is the key that opens the door my wife sings that sometimes faith is the key to every promise in the word without faith it's impossible it's the first step it's the first step over here on the right amen and this is oh my we are going to be on this tonight amen how many knows this faith is a part of the nature of God it's his it's a part of God my and by this faith that he has given us he says we have access by faith into this Grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God Amen I can't think of where I got it wrote down right now it's not Colossians 3 I think it's somewhere in Ephesians I should oh right here it is right in front of me it's actually Galatians 2 and 20 Paul says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen how many believe that that that's the way to live amen and this Faith amen this faith it was not just a faith that saves you and lift you up and gives you the baptism and the Holy Ghost but that's why they wrote that song We're living by faith how many believe we live by faith Paul said he lives by faith the live the life that he now lives every day to us we're living by faith when bad things happen and everybody else wants to shoot everybody for cutting them off you say go go ahead I ain't no worry amen I was out getting my coffee at the at the five star the night and there was a lady sitting at the the half and half creamer there and I was there waiting and and she was there and I don't know she sing her and talking to somebody I stood back there behind her with my cup just waiting and then her dad or somebody coming around the corner and and and said hey there's somebody waiting I says oh don't I said take your time I'm in no hurry just you know you know patience how many know we need patience oh my but you know we live we live by the faith of the Son of God I'm so glad that it's an everyday Affair living by faith is a everyday Affair how many believe this the very Faith Of God that you and I have we take it for granted we take so many things for granted let's not take what God has given us for granted he has given us his faith the very faith that created the worlds by faith we understand that the worlds were framed together by the word of God God spoken and it was it's not hard for a Believer to have faith it's not hard for a Believer to see God because whenever God is on the inside it's not hard to have not hard to see not hard to have faith oh God will take care of this God will take care of that calling those things that are not as though they are that's how we live makes a different person out of [Applause] us oh my when you got this faith and you come into Christ let me tell you something the Bible says that we are HID we get hid it's a hiding place Faith takes you to a hiding place how many believe that Colossians way back amen let's just read the scripture here Colossians 3 and verse three it says for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory I like that let me repeat this when Christ who is our life amen not only does Paul can we say that Paul lived by the faith of God but the very life of God is in you the very life of God is in me if it isn't the way it's supposed to be we're not dead yet we're not As Dead As what we should be I'm convinced that we need to dig a Little Deeper amen dig some more ditches make more room for the Holy Ghost There's No Limit there what can happen and the way that God can lead us if we'll just die to ourselves noce he said for you are dead and your life is hid in Christ you get into a hiding place Eve was so fortified behind the word the devil couldn't come get her at all even in James he says you know no temptation has taken you and so forth but every man is thrown away when it is bu amen and tempted when entic he's drawn our way of himself if God if the Devil comes in if the Devil comes in to where you are he'll be your brother if the Devil comes into where you are you'll shake his hand and say how you doing brother devil how many not my words how many know brother bam said if he would come into where you are he'd be your brother cuz he can't come in there he won't come in there cuz he has to come through repentance he's got to come through sanctification sanctification and baptism of Holy Ghost he's got to get into Christ where you are and that ain't never happening so brothers and sisters let me tell you our problem some sometimes and I believe that we get sealed amen by the Holy Spirit of Promise until the day of our Redemption but there's still times that you go out there's still time that I go out sometimes and it ain't the dev's fault he ain't got no power over you it's your [Music] fault you backslide you fall short don't blame the devil it wasn't his fault huh it was your fault you went to him that's the only way he could ever bother you or do anything with you amen that's the only way that Eve could ever ever ever go out was to open up the womb of her mind and look out amen reason ain't that right she's the one that went out not ad him oh my I like that fortified praise the Lord so we see brothers and sisters how that Faith breaks chains it breaks your fleshly desires amen it overcomes the corruption of the world that is through lust the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye the pride of life is that right he said that's what the Bible says the world is love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him now what is the world verse 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world so if you love the things that the flesh has the Desir that it has amen it ain't the love of God that you got in [Music] there what the brother B say all of a say all of a sudden see all of a sudden you see a woman that you fall in love with besides your wife he said that ain't love that's L huh that's right you love the things of the world you love the things of this flesh the love it if God ain't even in you if you love this world or the things in this world you love it more than you love God come on you're lying huh you better love God more than you love any of this world Amen all of your five senses your 10 senses amen well I know I to forgive that person but I just can't I just I'll tell you what huh you love your bitterness you love your hatred you man violence don't tell me you love God whole bitterness and hatred and VAR no you don't cuz one of the things that I want to get as one one of the aspects one of the one of the natures of God is forgiveness isn't that right one of those Natures that comes with him is forgiveness he was such a forgiving God he forgave the whole everybody for all of their sin R all aart and he told us man if your brother Trust against you 490 times a day you're to forgive wo pretty demanding I don't care how much you forgive a person you still was forgiven of a million dollars and you want to hold people account of for their $100 amen anyway I want to go down there hopes that helps listen oh I like that we've escaped oh oh boy can you imagine being captive in a chain down and captive in some Warehouse somewhere the devil beating you how many knows when you were chained by your feelings you didn't want to do that and you don't want to think that and so forth but the devil made you do it that's the one time the devil does make you do it when you're captive and you ain't got the Holy Ghost and yet you're captive you're a slave to those feelings a Slave his emotions that's why the world is still in the corruption that is in that's why it's so bad out there because they're captive but not you and I no aren't you glad that you're free tonight I'm free God has given me the key to Faith a me the unlocked door man you can kick them chains off and get out of there and escape from that place of Torment you come ience bothering you and everything else and the guilt that you got you can escape all of [Music] that amen escape the corruption that is in the world through faith amen we have access to God lives are HID oh he's looking devil has to come looking for you amen he's got to search for you but he can't find you cuz you're hid so far in Amen brother Bram preached on this a little bit on the inner Veil yall remember that the curtain drops in behind you you shut in with God in a secret place the world don't know nothing about the place you live huh there in the spirit behold in his face gaining new power to run in the race oh when you're in Christ you hear oh there's troubles on the outside there's trials on the outside there's frustrations on the outside there's murders on the outside there's killing there's Strife there's dying there's all these spiritual death people going by the way side but in Christ amen it doesn't affect you doesn't affect you not if you're hid to where you're supposed to that trial that comes your way tomorrow just find out if you're really hid in Christ amen that's so hid until I don't know what his name was but it's one of the brothers said when see they wrote the song about all is well it is well it Is Well with My Soul on the outside his wife that went down in the ocean his girl that went down in the ocean there was death all around but he went over the top of that spot amen and when he come across that spotty Road it is well it is well so trial should Buffet so storm should come amen um let this uh bless Assurance control that God has regarded my helpless estate amen and has I forget the words but he saying it is well It Is Well with My Soul amen praise the Lord huh kind of throwing it around whether I want to say it or not amen can't think of his name right now anyway but anyway maybe I'll tell you when I can think of it a little better but amen so you love the Lord all right praise the Lord hallelujah faith is the key Eve was fortified he was fortified behind the word if the devil gets you it's because you came out to him amen now you live by the faith of almighty God Amen let's see what this Faith does Amen listen to this how do we know that we are in part of Christ you know amongst the yish Y all and I talk to uh Sunny did I tell you the story about sunny I probably did Sunday or so I went over to his house a guy I went to school with am in and hadn't really seen him for 40 years and his son was outside I really felt led to go see him he's about four years older than me I guess and I went up drove up the place and talked to somebody and he said he was Sunny's son I said I want to see sunny and went to school with him he said well go on in there he had just got he was plowing with horses and the horses backed up and come around and come around and turned around like they do and and stomped him really bad almost killed him really bad just trampled him anyway he was laid up for about two weeks and his son said man he'd be glad to see you so I went in there knocked on the door amen and and just kind of walked on in they said come on in and they didn't know who I was from Adam and I said I heard that you had gotten hurt so I said come to see you because I had just heard from his son outside so I went over there and talked to him and he was just just uh just uh talk showing me his wounds and so forth on his legs and and so forth and talked a little bit and I says well I got a real surprise I'm going shock y'all very much today or something like that not a shy bone in my body when I was a little Amish boy I was very very shy hard to talk to anybody he says this can't be Thomas right but anyway so I said I'm going to shock y'all really you all are in for a shock I didn't know I going to pull a gun out what I was going to do right they didn't know me he told me later he wondered who in the world this guy was in here and so forth I says well you're gonna be shocked when I tell you who I am and his eyes popped open and he begin to look and look and look and so forth and he couldn't figure it out and I says just give him a few hints I went to school with you I looked and looked and looked and finally he guessed he finally guessed you're not Thomas are you yeah that's right but anyway we talked and talked and we talked a little bit and and I told him I saids well if we don't want to see you here we'll see you over there Lord willing I said we'll see you over there he said well I hope so and that brought me to this because the armies they just hope they're going to be there they just hope they're saved is that right John they live on a hope so amen we hope we hope and that has a lot of bearing how many knows that has a lot a bearing there's a lot of truth to it but also says that if we only have hope in Christ Jesus in this life we're of all men most miserable amen and now notice now back to my story hereby know we that we dwell in him amen and he in us I like that because they just hope hope I says well how you can know that you got you're saved you can know that Christ is in you because he has given us a of his spirit amen how many believes that the scriptures I want to get to though is over in five and verse four chapter 5 verse4 whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith ye of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world how many believes when God reveals himself to you he said to Peter who do you say I am he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God anden Jesus said Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against it so faith is a revelation of God that anchors you how many's glad to be anchored you know we have 10 senses see taste feel ha smell and so forth the 10 senses of the body but brother B said there's a Christian has a six sense what is that six sense Faith amen if God doesn't gr you that faith you'll be just as bad off as the world I don't care how much claim to be a Christian how much Church you join and mean how much you say you believe the message and so forth if God doesn't come down and grant you that Faith he to change your nature you're still going to be held amen by those 10 senses and change amen aren't you glad for that six sense that brings all these senses into submission otherwise they're just wild they're crazy all you got to do is look at the far left right now and you'll see how crazy feelings and emotions get you know how many of those Democrats well and Republicans how many of them folks say well we need to change this law and that law because you know it hurts somebody's feeling I don't care about your feelings amen if we change the laws for all of our feelings my goodness what kind of a world will we have and mean I know one thing they need to change their ways because they're Gras having me to having hurt my eyes looking at them you know it hurts my feelings get some cloes on how many's with me tonight quit tattooing yourself all over the place those nose rings are a problem to me it disturbs me huh that's right but all about feelings and emotions aren't you glad you're not governed by feelings and emotions you are governed by faith faith in the word of God gives you access to the very nature of God we're going to go into it Sunday again but how many beliefs like brother Bram says you know if you have a watermelon seed it'll bring forth watermelon amen if I if you have the spirit of John Dillinger you'd be a have a guns and be Outlaw and everything else you beein you'd write music you do whatever but if the Holy Ghost is in you the works that I do shall you do also how many believe that amen that's right praise the Lord the very Faith Like I said this real genui Faith brings something it'll bring it to I need it as a young person I needed something that caused me to be more solid not so immature huh that's right as young folks sometimes it takes more than 20 years to get little little of our immaturity out of us 25 30 40 boy I've seen some well I may be a little bit immature yet myself so what can I say sometimes it takes a lifetime to get some of the immatured into childishness and so forth out of us hello takes a lifetime sometimes but here for one thing for sure amen it gives you something solid how many glad that the faith of God gives you something solid it anchors you listen young people I don't care what age you are you need an anchor in your life that's why they floated and drifted as far as they have amen and doing all the things that they do because they have no anchor I mean know Faith anchors only in one thing not in man's tradition not in man's idea not in what Thomas berer thinks huh but what that word of God says faith anchors in the word amen what God Said is true let every man's word be a lie when God ever reveals something to you there ain't enough gates in hell to ever Prevail against it knowing his day when he got God spoke to him he got the Revelation going to reain and it didn't matter how many Skeptics there were he knew that it was going to rain and he built the ark how many knows that God is said he's going to come and he's going to burn this whole world with unquenchable fire but he's going to take his wheat into the Garner and we see that in front of us it's a long range Vision amen and that which we are seeing amen and believing we don't see it like Abraham he he didn't see it but he believed the promise Abraham looked for a city whose Builder and maker is God and when you and I are looking for that same city Faith causes you to see things that are not not yet not here yet but it brings things into substance faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not yet seen that's what faith is well I need healing it's not there yet but I see myself whole huh I can't overcome this I can't conquer this but faith says I will overc overcome it amen I'm maybe I I'm I'm going to presume that there's a few Christians in uh few Christians here amen that battle with things and battle with things amen and you have to say I'm going to overcome it I didn't overcome it but I'm gonna overcome it I know I am right here your pastor hello that's amen and you do you do overcome why because the only way you'll overcome is by through faith and your faith is listen your faith is the victory that overcomes this world of lust these five senses and all of these lusts of Flesh your faith is what overcomes it amen doesn't it feel good it just feels good to be free that's right no Shackles on your arm huhuh that's right hell's coming judgment's coming the wrath of God is coming W huh you ain't got to be scared you ain't got to worry why cuz you're standing with the fire is burning can we say when we come to church you come where the fire is burning amen and you might get your fire burned a little bit but God help us to get fried a little bit here and not consume the but fire it's [Applause] coming you love this world and the things of this world you love to have your way you got to go by your feelings you love all that don't lie to yourself amen you better repent or you'll not be there cuz the love of God ain't in you how many knows whenever the Holy Ghost gets on your heart you love the things of God you hate the things that's evil and you love God you love church you love the word of God you love to worship you love everything that God loves you love to see people dress right do right raise your hands be free worship God come to church amen you love to see people in church amen that's right that's what God will do in you and for you praise the Lord it brings solidity or solidness in your heart amen it makes you boy oh boy brother Tommy it anchors you for a lifetime it anchors you when you're drawing your last breath and when you get carried over to the other side folks I'm telling you we don't realize how real that other side is that other side is real folks heaven is real hell is real the regions of the Lost is real don't wait till you come down to the door of death to decide hey I need to make a few things right huh I need to make sure that I don't love the world more than I love God are the things of this world more than I love God those who live by faith the most had the least attachments to this world how many knows that Jesus just had nothing in this world ain't that right he had nowhere to lay his head and the next man to him the closest I'm going to say the closest because he wrote the whole new testament and brother Braham said that we use the Apostle Paul as an example of a man that's preaching the right and the truth and that's on the word you better pre preach what Paul preached if you're an angel from heaven you'll be cursed he was he wrote most of his new testament in prison in bonds and in Chains he didn't have it nice he didn't have a Jesus didn't have a family Paul didn't have a family neither one of them was married amen we'll getting into part of that Sunday amen how the wife cares for the things of her husband and the husband cares for the things of his wife if they're married and so forth but what was it they were so governed and operated by faith of all almighty God Amen that their grip on this world was very loose amen amen you got your phone with that little statement that you sent to the church about don't be so busy you don't have time for me brother Tommy if you got that pull it up I want to read that I like that amen how many's glad to have the victory over the world because of the faith amen first it was Grace amen but you had to have faith to receive that Grace Paul said we have access into disgrace by the faith that God gave you boy if that don't want to make you get down on your knees when you think about the millions that God is bypassing the the thousands of people that are dying right now and going into the regions of the chains and lost lost forever hello and only the few that are going up into the Pearly Gates hello the few that are going up that way and God had mercy on you God had mer mercy on you and you and you God had mercy on you to put that Faith to believe his word to become Unchained from the devil to come and get it hid in Christ hide away never had to do any drugs to scream and holler and have a good time just come to church and you'll know what I do to enjoy myself bask in the presence of God hid away how many believes we need to get hid hid away that devil man he'll go try to resuscitate that man resuscitate him let him get get back back back back to life huh let's have somebody cut him off [Applause] huh my I was in a hurry going to rosille the other day I promise you I Ain never you know I don't pass unless I I can can you know in a decent amount but every time I want to pass a car would come around the curve nope can't do it it was not just that way there but it was that way coming back I was like Lord thank you I know you're trying to tell me slow yourself down be patient how many know that patience is another attribute of God and we all need it that patience have her perfect work that she may be en Tire have you got it couldn't find it okay all right anyway Lord bless you tonight you love him how many knows that that truly that's where the great battle is brother Bram called it the greatest battle that was ever fought huh it's with those chains to try to hang on to you conscience memory reason everything else all those things but God comes and he drops down in faith and every one of those feelings and emotions and conscience and memories they have to govern by faith in prayer of almighty God Amen when you are you can be hid away whether you feel good or whether you bad whether you have a good day or whether you have a bad day whether it's tribulation or it's the top of the mountain huh hid away in God Amen how many wants to be that way God bless you tonight let's stand musicians if you'll
