right let's bow our heads and go before the lord kind heavenly father we come before you lord once again thankful to be in your house thank the lord to be with believers of like faith lord jesus and have them lord to be filled with your spirit lord jesus most of all we're grateful god that you are in our midst lord jesus in our hearts and in our souls in our mind you are our strength you're all that we are we ask god that you just blessed a little thought father i feel lord that you've laid upon my heart to speak on this evening we just committed to you and ask god that you'll give us strength and that you'll give us the inspiration bless each one that has come bless our young folks each one that is at camp we ask god did you just give a very special experience with you lord jesus something that would be of eternal and everlasting weight lord we just commit ourselves to you now in jesus name amen kind of a different subject this evening but um just something that i feel like the lord laid on my heart so we'll just go with it i said all right amen and we want to title this this evening just this phrase called praise ye the lord praise ye the lord amen amen because god is good how many knows god is good amen he truly is so we'll start with the lepers over in the book of luke if you will turn with it with me to the book of luke the 17th chapter and i do want to read quite a few few scriptures this evening amen do quite a bit of reading amen luke 17. and we'll begin with verse 12. and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan and jesus answering said were there not ten cleanse but where are the nine there are not found that return to give glory to god save this stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way that faith has made thee whole i want to go to second timothy second timothy the third chapter i don't know why my voice wants to be a little hoarse tonight but it seems to want to second timothy 3 and verse 1. one and two this know also that in the last days parallels time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient appearance unthankful and unholy amen and the main key word that i wanted to pull out of there was unthankful amen god bless you you can be seated may god add his blessings to the reading of the word amen we look at first of all the story of the lepers there was 10 lepers and from what i understand all cleansed that right there was ten of them as far as i know they were all cleansed and we know that leprosy is something that's incurable it's a type of sin isn't that it's a type of sin uh leprosy is something that just can't be cured and so these different men i guess it was these lepers doesn't say whether it was men and women but uh these lepers they were cleansed of their leprosy and only one had something special in him didn't he he had appreciation he had thankfulness amen amen the rest of them i don't know it's kind of hard to imagine where they were brother glenn where were they at i mean what would you do if a man told you i'll tell you what just go and show yourselves to the priest and as you did what he said all of a sudden your leprosy left you all right you were cleaned and then you went on about your way and oh man just lift your life huh not a whole lot of natural affection there is it not a whole lot of thought not a whole lot of feeling there amen that's what it was with them and it also talks about the last days that you know that people will be without natural affection in verse three people don't have any natural affection you know that's why people are such brute beasts because they don't have the the kind of affection that a normal natural person is supposed to have you'd never never kill anybody wouldn't hurt anybody you know if you had the kind of natural affection that god expects us to have that you're supposed to have just natural affection amen and he says that it would be perilous times that would come in our last days because for one thing people are going to be unthankful for unappreciative how many know that we're living in a in a in a country especially especially in a country that is not thankful for their own house for their for the place that you live how many likes where you live at you like your house you wouldn't just go and smear mud and you know go tell everybody i terrible house i ate my house but yet that's what people do and do everything to tear that house down people are not thankful for the blood people spilled to build the house people are absolutely ungrateful and in my opinion i don't have a very high opinion of somebody that is not thankful not very high at all amen and that's the world that we're living in amen as you know it's getting to where our t my our our college students and all those kind of people amen and i don't know about this critical race theory but i'm here to tell you that people are actually being taught and they're actually saying that they're ashamed they're an american he used to be we're proud to be an american and all that right let's try to make him ashamed and you know the thing of this reason where i want to go with this is not necessarily our politics because we know that we're living in a very dark time and it's only going to get darker but i want to talk about god amen and i want to talk about amen being thankful to god amen and giving him the praise that is to his name because when you think about god and who he is and what he is and i want to read a lot of scriptures yet because we want to go over this and i really want to keep you too long but you know wednesday night i know how it's hot you wear out if you work hard at all that energy zaps a lot out of you amen but i was even tired coming to church but i was just tired i rested a lot today i got to catch up i said what tell you you know it takes a lot to get your energy back up but uh in the midst of all that it says look even if you're tired you should still enjoy hey this is your time go and have church go enjoy church you know if you come to church tired that's really good that's a good sacrifice to god that's a good way to praise the lord is just when you don't feel like it when your body's too tired and you don't want to how many has there been there everybody don't want to go your body don't want to get up look at a few modest ones among us but anyway but it's a good sacrifice amen the spotty is not willing but the spirit is amen the fl the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak the bible says so we find that people are lovers of themselves disobedient to parents they are absolutely disrespectful if they'll disrespect their parents they'll disrespect everybody else that's why we don't have any respect for the law anymore because they don't even respect their parents complete disrespect boy i'll tell you what how many knows back in the old days when your grandchild come up to you and they smartmouthed you a little bit they made it to your grandchild but did get it back in pretty good they'd only do it once or twice and that'd be about it why because they were taught respect you teach them respect but people have no respect anymore they don't have any respect for the good things that they have how many knows god is good he's been good to us he's good to the whole world right now god is good to the whole world but that's fixing the end it'll not always be that way amen so we see that they're unthankful unholy amen oh my we think about that in the age that we're living in how that we're living in a disrespectful dishonorable disobedient unthankful ungrateful generation amen and so i like this one leper that came back after being cleansed from his leprosy and he fell down and he got a little loud from what i heard with a loud voice huh lori he he just got all beside himself i mean that's the way kids are when they get real happy they get a little loud they get beside themselves they just go to that's how he felt he was happy because he had been cleansed how many have been cleansed from sin i'm glad when you mess up and when you need forgiveness the lord forgives you and he gives you your peace back amen and you begin to say thank you lord that's one of the things we praise god for amen praise you the lord for his mercy into earth forever amen he's a very merciful god all right praise the lord god is good isn't he now we want to go to psalms let's go to psalms there's a lot of different ways to give god praise amen to give god praise amen i think brother brad preached on something on this line here not so long ago because on worship and so forth it's all on the same light and thought worshipping the lord amen how many knows worshipping the lord giving him praise and giving him thanks giving him thanks is a form of giving him worship and praise amen all right so we're going to start here in psalms we want to do a bit of reading and i read a couple chapters and went back to another one and found all kinds of more good stuff so we just amen we're going to go and just go down through here a little bit tonight would that be all right and we'll start with psalms 145. i'll call this the consummation or the psalmist's finale all right finale you know how many finale is usually something big fourth of july the finale is really big well this is the way the psalms ends amen and what david thinks and the way that david was thinking and the inspiration that he had under him when it came down to the the final chapters of psalms amen and we'll begin with 145 he says i will extol thee my god and i didn't know what it's called extol meant so thanks to siri i now know what extol is it means to praise enthusiastically amen i will praise the lord enthusiastically amen i will expose the lord so the my god o king i will bless thy name forever and ever amen they write songs like bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name how many likes that amen bless him forever every day i will bless thee and i will praise thy name forever and ever amen do you reckon in all of eternity we'll stop praising the lord we'll become unthankful how many knows that's exactly what the devil did in heaven he became ungrateful for where he was i'm thankful for where he was amen now great in the lord and yeah here you go thank you read with me greatly to be praised greatly to be praised amen not just a little bit because when i think about how great god is i realize that i just don't know if a human being can really give him the praise that's do him and that right he's due so much amen because he is great and his greatness is unsearchable don't even try to figure it out amen that's right you'll blow a fuse one generation shall buy works to another amen and shall declare thy mighty acts i will speak of the glorious honor and of thy majesty and of thy wondrous work that's why we always love to talk about the bull the hornets huh we love to talk about david talk about shamgar amen because it was god's mighty works we can talk about what god did in the message of the hour through the prophet of god isn't that right amen because we realize it wasn't the prophet it was god through the prophet amen now notice and men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts i will declare thy greatness amen as we get older we realize hey we're not as great as what we thought we were i thought i could work forever eight hours a day now i'd like to work about five and take naps in between take it easy that'll work hard for eight hours and find out you gotta have two days to recoup from all that folks you find you're not as big and strong as what you thought you was you're getting old and feeble and one of these days you know and i think i'm almost 60. i'm lucky to be alive huh that's right folks a lot of people pass away around 50 60 years be thankful you realize not so great it's him that's great he's the only one worth bragging about i will declare thy greatness they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness and they shall sing of thy righteousness amen the lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great mercy the lord is good to all but i'd like to tell that to the whole wide world you haven't got a clue of how god is very very good to you right now any kind of good that you he could crank this thing up about 15 degrees and we would be the most miserable creatures upon the faith of the earth wishing we could die and would die from heat exhaustion isn't that right he'd just have to crank the thermostat up a little bit thank you lord for not cranking it up not yet anyway uh he's going to crank it up after a while he's gonna get real hot the elements shall melt with fervent heat because why because they turned down his mercy they turned down his great they didn't want him amen oh my he is good to all that's right as long as that blood covers the earth isn't that right it protects everybody still grace for everybody as long as that mercy seat is there as long as he sits there on that mercy seat and that blood covers the earth but when that blood is taken away and that right and god cannot have god does not uh intermingle with evil it can't come into his presence no no no no then he's got to purge it and cleanse it get rid of all of it amen and his tender mercies are over all of his works all thy work shall praise thee o lord how many believes that everything all of nature all of his works they actually they praise him they put us all in awe of him like the scripture says we stand in all oh wow when he made the birds the bees when he put the instincts and the nature of everything that he put out there where we standing all when he let us come and become sinful and amen go out there and you know and and live in sin and whatever we did and god had grace and mercy upon us to put something down in here and he'd give us an ear that we can hear with we say oh thank you lord for giving me a ear that i can hear thank you for placing something down in there to receive what god has for us amen all his works praise him praise thee amen oh lord this is verse 10 and all thy saints shall bless thee they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power and all the people said amen i like that to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glorious majesty of his kingdom thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and thy dominion endure earth throughout all generations yeah that's right he's still in control huh his dominion endures throughout all generations whatever is happening he's allowing are you with me he's just allowing it but if they try to change something that he wants they don't stand a chance do they the lord uphold with all that fall and raises up all those that are bowed down the eyes of all wait upon thee and thou givest them their meat in due season reminds me of the fall of a sparrow he says you know they what was it the sparrows or the birds they don't they don't uh the birds don't take into barns and everything else but god feedeth them amen and all of the eyes of all the earth they all rely on god they all got their eyes on god and he feedeth them thou openest the hand and satisfieth the desire of every living thing the lord is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works amen the lord is not unto all them that call upon him praise be to god aren't you glad that when you call on him he's right there close the bible says draw and i unto god and god will all nigh unto you he's looking for your action amen he's waiting for us to care because he already cares and to all that call upon him in truth he will fulfill the desire of them that fear him he also will hear their cry and save them the lord preserveth all them that love him but all the wicked shall he destroy my mouth shall speak the praise of the lord and that all flesh flesh bless his holy name forever and ever now i just want to take one verse from 146 and also one word verse from 147 and i'm going to go to 148 149 and 150. 146 to begin with not paul but david says praise ye the lord praise the lord oh my soul how many knows it doesn't you don't just wanna you know how many like i like something genuine you know just something genuine just like be yourself you might be backwards you might be forwards you might be this way or you might be that way but be yourself be genuine you know when we praise the lord we don't want to put on huh when we do anything we don't want to put on if nothing put on is any good for us huh why because it's artificial we're going to be genuine and when we praise the lord it doesn't need to just come from something that you put on but it has to come from your soul praise the lord o my soul while i live i will praise the lord i will sing praises unto my god while i have any being verse 40 chapter verse chapter verse my goodness chapter 147 verse 1 praise ye the lord for it is good to sing praises unto our god it is pleasant and praise is calmly yeah amen tell you what you meet somebody you should be just totally in order for force to say to us to each other praise the lord brother it's calmly praise the lord sister god is worthy of praise he is let me tell you something my jordan gets his praise muhammad ali got his all of these they got their praise they got their honor they got their glory and paul says that we're to give honor to whom honor is due glory to whom glory dude how many believe god is worthy of a whole lot more glory than some football or some basketball or anything else in our life folks there should be things that we can get excited about that we can be enthused about but not like god not like the holy spirit amen all right now let's begin with 148. what does it say that's right glory praise you the lord twice praise ye the lord from the heavens praise him in the heights now i don't understand that i haven't gotten up there in the space shuttle to be in the heavens to praise him yet right but if you go up there from what i understand go ahead and praise the lord while you're up there praise him from the heavens praise him from the moon if you go there huh praise him from the heights wherever you are just praise him verse 2 praise ye him all his angels praise him all his hosts amen can i stop there for a minute talk about giving god to praise giving god the glory how many knows that that's what david did david gave god to pray you know sometimes people like to take the glory they like to take the credit oh i did this and oh i did that okay didn't do nothing amen even when david was fixing to take eliza's head off and what he said he says you know you come at me with a sword and a shield but i don't come with my i come with a sling and a stone but that's what i'm bringing i'm coming to you and what the name of the lord of hosts because that's the one that's going to do that's the one that's going to get the credit that's if there's any good in any of us isn't that right the lord gets the credit because we're all evil wicked mean nasty kind of people we are men and women every last one of them we could be very very very wicked oh and uh if we were wicked we'd brag about who's the most wicked and who's the baddest why do you think chicago all of them guys are killing each other with guns they're all trying to prove who's the baddest they're dead bad people sad ain't it they need the lord to realize my doesn't lead nowhere but death so if any good the good that we've seen each other the kind handshake how are you doing that's the lord god bless you brother god bless that's all god in you and in me caring for one they're loving one another it's all god he gets the glory he gets the praise because he's worthy of it all right all his hosts he says praise him you'd be amazed at how many times as david comes down to finishing his book of how many times he said look his very last words were everything that has breath praise the lord praise ye the lord that's just how i feel tonight that's how i feel you know we we do a lot of talk we preach a lot we you know we do all of this but yet how much praising of the lord do we do as i'll tell you right now how many knows that when you look at it all the blessings god's pursued upon you you really don't have any room to complain none no room to complain you'll be so busy thanking god for your blessings and counting your blessing you won't have time to be unthankful can i put something in here a little bit we'll sting this just a little bit but i'm telling you as a pastor most of the time one of the things that i have to deal with the most that reoccurs and that happens among us and all of us is that people get unsatisfied unhappy i'm thankful huh time again and i'll tell you when you become unthankful amen you become unhappy this ain't right that ain't right i don't like this we can go on all day folks it's one of the things that a pastor has to contend with a lot because we as human beings tend to not be happy with things and that's just not god that does that on us it's the devil isn't that right amen but thank god he helps and snaps us out of it amen we all get that way amen oh my my wife she reminded me what i was talking about a little bit reminded me well you know you get that way sometimes yeah honey you're right but thank the lord we we've managed to get through it amen praise the lord okay where are we at so that's right he says uh all his all ye his hosts praise ye him sun and moon praise him all ye stars of light write it david say it david i'm your audience tonight glory that's right david i know where you're coming from you just know that god is worthy of so much praise because i can't imagine having been in david's shoes huh having to kill goliathus and having to dodge spears from saul and run from saul for many months and everything he went through with epsilon and everything else because of his sin and all the army said he camped about him and we're going to kill him and swore they'd kill him and all the times that he says you know the one army will come pass me about i will not fear david you had to trust in the lord david went through a lot so he knew he said he's my buckler he's my shield he's my strong power he's my defense he's everything to me and he's just beginning to begin to shout out say let the sun let the moon let the sun that everything prays alone because he's worthy of praise amen he is isn't he how is the son going to praise him well the sun's a time of a type of god himself i mean without the sun there wouldn't be a living thing upon the earth without god there would be not a living thing upon the earth so the son gives him glory the god son praises him the moon praises him what because the moon is that's what the moon from what i understand controls the tides we'd all be sucking water in our lungs right now if you're walking for the moon the tides come in and just let wash everything up wouldn't it be nice if uh or shouldn't i say wouldn't it be terrible if you lived on the coast or somewhere anywhere close to a coast and you'd never know when the waves are going to come in for about a hundred miles and when it was and you could have fun building a house and here it comes and watches away but i wish the tides would make up their mind of what they want to do huh but isn't it something they'll build them right there on the edge because they know just pretty much outside of a tsunami they know pretty much where to build them amen and lord help them when the tsunami does come they ain't ready for all that they didn't build the planting on the tides not keeping their distance and staying out they didn't plan that they didn't plan on earthquakes amen that's why i'd want to live up on top of a mountain if i was on a coast with you and get out of florida it's only eight foot above water level one little wave and the whole thing's gone folks no i'm just kidding i get doubt you trust the lord anyway right gonna get out of somewhere get out of california because we know that's the of the lord it's going down i don't know how anybody's still out there but anyway this bellar i guess but what is it praise the lord for the moon right let the moon give god glory the moon gives god glory how many knows what else the moon is a type of the moon is the type of the church amen and what does the church do in the night time it reflects the light of the sun down and a beautiful beautiful full moon you can almost walk without a light and that's the way you and i are we're a type of the the moon amen that reflects the light of jesus christ because the sun is so high amen so high that it reflects to this the moon and it shines down on us even when it's on the other side of the earth jesus christ was exalted so high amen and the light of his light comes down upon the church and comes out through here you know while i was studying this i thought you know why don't all people give him praise he says for everybody to give everything all people let him get up and give you pray but you know the devil in his kingdom in this world they're not going to praise the lord no they're going to throw them out of our courthouse and they're going to try to get rid of him and after a while they won't like god so much they'll try to shut us down hello they want to get rid of anything no they're not going to be giving praise the world's not going to give him praise but somebody's going to give me praise somebody's going to praise the lord somebody's going to give god the glory and it's going to be his people maybe my minority people when it should be the whole earth should be everybody living on the earth but they are not all right now notice all right the moon let it give uh let it let it praise the lord and it really does the moon the sun it praises god how well just for the fact that it makes a perfect circle every morning huh isn't it something how they can type it uh i don't know if it's july or somewhere somewhere in this time down the days will begin to get shorter shorter maybe a minute a day all the way to december and they can write that out you know they can write it out in the calendar and they'll be right every time it'll do everything right it gives god praise because god commanded it and it holds god's commandment holds ah that don't do nothing to the world but it does mean to know that god's word holds it holds the stars another place earlier there it says he names all the stars i mean those are astronomers and everybody they got jupiter they got mars they got venus they got the big dipper they got a little dipper and i don't know what all else i'm not that's about as far as i've been educated but all most of those stars got names and everything god's got them all out there and they all got names he knows all about them he stretched out the heavens out there it says he found he created the foundation of the earth he created all of that amen let it all bring praise to god because he's worthy to be praised let me tell you something god's not worthy of a lukewarmness he's not worthy of you know just something haphazard or something lame some animal that you know like over there i believe it is in malachi says you know offer now that which is lame unto thy governor and see if he'll be pleased with it when we come to church we as preachers we'll work eight hours for an hour and a half maybe more than that we'll labor and we we pray and seek the lord and and we're burdened on our heart about the message and about being in the place that we ought to be when we come to the house of god isn't that right i mean it means the congregation i mean it gets something i know how comfortable it is back there i'd sit there and it can get to where you're just plumb relaxed and if you aren't careful you become dodie and you won't say amen you won't wave your hand or hallelujah or whatever but that's not the way it's supposed to be we come to the house of god to worship the lord isn't that right let's find out so he led us here wow praise him in the heavens of heavens any waters that be above the heavens let them praise the name of the lord for he commanded and they were created i guess this scripture explains the first scripture well how can the waters way above the heavens above the clouds we know that the clouds are actually what holds the water in there right so he said even let the water in the clouds even let them praise the lord well how can the waters praise the lord well brother branham taught that those clouds out there they'll go out there in the salt water they'll pick that supper up and it'll cleanse that salt water huh i don't know what it does how it does it is a miracle but it's god's commandment it pulls off that moisture because i'll tell you what you like dead crops if there was salt water weren't coming on down isn't that right if you pick up that saltwater because a lot of that comes right off of there pulls it off of that comes in and it's all refined it's pure clean good water how many knows is hardly anything better than rain water it's real good water amen unless it comes down through the power plants where the power plants are i've seen a lot of dead trees going over towards knoxville there they've got power plants and all the trees the evergreens are all dead and i'm like i guess that's called acid rain that's man's doing not god's doing amen so even even he was looking at that amen let them praise the name of the lord for he commanded and they were created he also he had also established them forever and ever he had made a decree which it shall not pass you talk about thou shalt not pass and they're right when god says it he's got to stay in his place even the prophet says you say well i see a shooting star now you see fragments of some kind if that star ever moved out of its place it would just it would it would uh mess everything up just like the moon if he'd ever got too far away or too close or the sun get a little further away we'd be in the ice age get a little closer it'd be something else amen so he makes a decree which it shall not pass praise the lord from the earth ye dragons and all depths amen i mean knows all of the things in the deep ocean it all praises god every bit of it praises god fire hail snow and vapors stormy wind fulfilling his word hallelujah it's all god's making i don't know about you but i like snow how many of us is fascinated with a snowflake wow look at that snowflake we're not anymore we're old but when you're a kid it's wow right the snowflake is so beautiful yeah very fascinated praise the lord for snowflakes am i right amen for vapers amen amen vapers fog all right fog tell you what we went to alice and andy's the other day we give them amish kids a boat ride on micah's boat and uh on the cumberland river and boy it was beautiful i got out there early in the morning woke up earlier had one of them boys go down there and we went down to the next city pretty much and got on that river and come flying up that river on a boat and it was foggy i ain't never been on the boat on that river before but tommy and everybody i mean brother jeff they were saying be careful there's logs everywhere that was fine i told them i said i'm not told that that before i said i'm sure glad they are nobody else is as dumb as we are let's see if they are we're gonna crash because if you had to really watch i mean here we are on plane going up the river and you know somebody else is doing the same thing you better be ready to meet the lord in the air oh but anyway we had a good time and i didn't go slow enough to try to be able to see so it wasn't total ignorance but we had a good time but it was so beautiful the vapor stuff the how many knows it's all god i don't care what you do you should be able to see didn't know what brother bam says if you'll have the holy ghost in here you'll see god everywhere you'll see him in the eagle you'll see him in the howling of the wolf and the eagle and everything you'll see god everywhere if you aren't careful you'll be running around the tree praising god god is good he really is good i mean folks how many knows god is really good you you know folks i'm here to tell you we've got pretty much everything because they could be dragging us out like they did our forefathers and our our brothers and sisters and burning us at the stake killing us in every manner hello they went through absolute hades so to speak they had it bad to be a christian they died they gave their lives for it and here we are we have it nice i heard brother batman say we have to have the best homes drive the best cars have the most money have the nicest clothes nice shoes and everything but where is god amen where does god get his praise at amen that's the truth too isn't it amen i'm just thankful that god has me in his hand aren't you glad that god has you in his hand if you don't if you don't have that confident brother sister i don't care what you got to do what cornfield you got to stay at till it dies and the um or you die get it see god i want it more than anything because god hears you when you call amen vapors and vapors and stormy wind fulfilling his word mountains and all hills fruitful trees and all cedars beasts and all cattle creeping things and fly in the air woo everything david was sent just everything should praise the lord kings of the earth ought to praise the lord all and all people princes and all judges of the earth i'm going to go a little faster but we could talk about kings how that you know their rule and their their word is so let it be written and so let it be done if he if he tells you you're going to hang you're going to hang and so forth but he's the king of kings lord of lords isn't that right the judge is to judge people for the wrong he's the supreme judge amen and on and on let them all praise the lord both young men maidens old men and children let them praise the name of the lord we got any young folks this evening when i say praise the lord huh got any somebody that works for somebody young maidens yeah we don't have any maidens in him what are we how about old man man oh man praise the lord [Music] oh that we got a good sounding from that why he's worthy of praise amen and one more it says in verse 12 both young men and maidens old men and now we want to hear it says and children any children in here want to say praise the lord go ahead i can't hear you praise the lord all right we heard the children say praise the lord amen not just in their mouths but in their lives isn't that right that goes for every one of us amen let them praise the name of the lord for his name alone is excellent wow there is never children listen there is never a name that you're gonna hear anywhere anytime any place that is as great as the lord jesus christ that's the greatest name that there is his name alone is excellent his glory is above the earth and heaven he also exalteth the horn of his people the praise of all his saints he exalteth even unto the children of israel are people near unto him praise ye the lord amen praise you the lord once again 149. he ends up with 148 praise he the lord he starts 149. praise you the lord sing unto the lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints i like that um go down here to these rock and roll parties mud bogs or whatever you want and say praise the lord you reckon they're going to be responding no because they're not saints right let it be done in this the saints are the one that's gonna do it the sinners aren't gonna do it amen in the congregation of saints let israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of zion be sorrowful in their king joy oh yeah that's right brother glenn thank you brother he said joyful in their king hallelujah i can't wait to end the service i'm about ready to sing already let them praise his name in the dance huh that's right david folks i want to rerun i want to see david and how he danced for the lord i got to see it he got happy i was when i read that i thought you know i can imagine going to amish church and see this amish guy just get happy and start dancing that would be something that i tell you what we talked about for at least a century or two probably the amishment that dance folks because they aren't allowed to be joyful hardly barely a smile it's got to be pious serious very religious can't do it all right so now notice in the dance let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and the harp for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation let the saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds that's right wake mama and daddy up i may see grace hallelujah son would you be quiet trying to sleep hey how many believes we'd be better off we'd probably live longer we'd be happier huh if we'd sing aloud upon our beds amen make a joyful noise unto the lord let the saints be joyful and glory let them single out upon their beds let the high praises of god be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand i've got joy i've got happiness and devil you ain't taking it from me how many knows sure as you get right with god and have the peace of god the devil would do anything to try to rob you he is a robber he is a thief he comes to kill he comes to steal your joy he comes to make your life blah god comes to make your life glory hallelujah i came to give you life and that more abundantly i'm going to pour it on you let our cup come full like david said my cup is full and overflowing how many one needs their cup full and overflowing amen stop there for just a minute i'm gonna bring in a quote or two brother brahm says you know the reason that we have arthritis and all these other things he says you know it's probably because we should be more like the birds huh the nightingale at night every time the moon comes out comes out from behind those clouds he just goes to singing and man i'll tell you what you ever go to camp and aim in on the river and you get a nightingale you want to get the shotgun out i'm trying to sleep here i don't want to hear all that work have been going on they can make a noise and just keep making it praising the lord but you don't see no ambulance for them right every time you get up in the morning early in the spring and you go outside early and guess what all the birds are singing praising the lord they're having a good day that's right we'd be healthier happier if we sang more to the lord and i probably won't get to it so i'm going to do it while it comes to mind is that okay this is how paul said that we ought to be in ephesians 5 19 it says giving thanks always how many believes we as christians should always be giving thanks and that's part of worship that's praising god thank you lord jesus that young uh that that that leper came back giving him thanks thanking him for it so maul jackson wouldn't take a drink of water without what thanking god he was thankful he worshipped the lord giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of the lord jesus christ hey i got a little ahead of myself go back to verse 19. we should be speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making a melody in your heart to the lord and then it says giving thanks always for all things that's the kind of people we should be people that worship people that praise the lord all right verse 6 of chapter 149 let the high praises of god be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand to execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishments upon the people to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with feathers of iron to execute upon them to judgment written dishonor have all his saints praise ye the lord folks i don't know about you but this sounds like we're going to put some binding on some kings and people one of these days we're gonna wrap this thing up aren't we we're gonna come back with the king of kings amen after three and a half years to the battle of armageddon and we're going to destroy everything we're going to take over this is the honor bestowed upon his saints praise ye the lord can i just say what comes to my mind all this ruckus and all this disorder one of these days god is gonna be with going to have us with him we're going to be with him when we straighten this mess up i'm going to believe that we're going to straighten this mess up praise you the lord chapter 50 praise you the lord praise god in his sanctuary praise him in his firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of a trumpet praise him with the sultry in our heart praise him with the timbrel and well there it is again and dance folks let me tell you something praise him with the string instruments and organs amen praise him upon the loud symbols praise him upon the loud sounding symbol oh oh god's getting a little loud here folks i just knew i had there was something down in there but yeah i like it loud sometimes i like my soft music but i like it loud when it depends on the mood how many knows we all got moved what was it brother brian said sunday i said he said something about we're going to have highs and lows we're going to have this that and the other and we're going to all these other things we have you know time when we like slow songs we have sound when we like i like it just up there on the top of that piano praise the lord huh it just depends on the spirit i believe we need to just rely on the spirit that's right i ain't even got a problem with a roll over drum once in a while just don't get carried away appreciate a good drama amen praise the lord how many believe we ought to give god more praise praise you on the loud symbol praise the poem with a high sounding symbol let everything that has breath go ahead praise the lord praise the lord god bless you let's stand and give god some praise and glory amen and just you do it by the way of song we do it by with our life every day we do it with how kind of attitude we wake up with isn't that right but remember this let's just remember this from tonight's service and that is the way that paul said that we ought to be singing amen spiritual songs in our heart meditating upon these things and speaking to yourself in psalms and making a melody in your heart amen that's how to kind of that's how we're to live to sing and to praise the lord and to give him honor and glory i believe that they keep a lot of stuff out of our lives that shouldn't be in there don't you amen all right i didn't know i thought this was a good sunday morning service but i thought well we're gonna try it anyway it depends on the spirit i feel the spirit is here enough that we can maybe do this and i want to start with us we'll start with a song that goes hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise you the lord you all know that one all right now what i'd like to do um i think i wanted the sisters to go with the hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and then the brothers go praise you the lord let's try that now if i'm not wrong it's three times right praise you the lord and then the last one we all sing together right so sister becky would you leave the sisters a little bit with the hallelujah [Music] [Applause] the hallelujah [Music] praise the lord [Music] the lord praise [Music] amen david can you handle that for me let's sing it one more time shall we i'm gonna let david lead i didn't know that song just too well but i think
