can sure do it we can have revival on wednesday night amen all we have to do is just let the lord absolutely have his way i guess i've sang this song 10 million times especially right here at the church i've sang it a bunch of times but for whatever reason i've just got it on my heart to sing it again tonight in the things familiar we find security resisting all the changes days and years when god decides to lead you through an open door inviting you to walk in realms you've never known before beyond the open door is a new and fresh anointing hear the spirit calling you to go walk on through the door the lord will go before you into our greater power [Music] you've never known before amen hear the spirit calling to wake the living dead to reach those huddled masses who cry out for living breath arise oh my the army take up thy shield and soar the father lifts his golden lamp inside the open door is a new and fresh anointing hear the spirit calling [Music] the lord will go before you into a greater power [Music] you've never known before whoever i'm singing this for tonight the door is open for you where he leads me i will follow raise a hand and say man where he leads me i will follow me i will follow i'll go with him with him yes lord the way not halfway not part of the way i'll go with him i'm against a man with him all the way through his opened door praise god praise god and the church said amen praise the lord let's stand together tonight amen i don't know who i sung that for but the door is open for you so appreciate the lord jesus isn't god good for us he's good for us not just good to us he's good for us you know that amen amen the lord is good for you amen i just um i just appreciate the bible been looking at some things this week that the lord i believe has been speaking to my heart personally on a personal basis just little things you know reading the scripture and i i marvel at how often the scriptures we read the things that we read in the bible that maybe in a way of looking at it we would think well that was speaking to that one and that one and then this one over there and then this kingdom and then that king and this prophet what more but i we could read it like that but i always marvel when i read the word how personal it feels like god's talking right to me right out of his scripture it says wait on the lord and you'll be strengthened and he talks about being overcomers and all the great things my love that i'll give it just feels like he's talking right to me amen that's because the bible is unlike any book in the world it's not like a dictionary or encyclopedia when you pick it up you're going to read certain things and those things were wrote for individuals that were of a specific maybe class or a specific profession but the bible was created and wrote for the saints of god this is why brethren called this god's love letter to you and i i am so glad to have a love letter love letter from the lord jesus christ to know what he thinks about me and how he feels about me amen i love the lord tonight so appreciate his grace let's um if you have your bible tonight turn to matthew chapter 5. i want to speak to you this evening on what are blessings what are blessings amen what are blessings i've been preaching on this for several weeks and i kept saying what is blessings and that little school teacher of mine said you can't say what is it's what are hallelujah matthew 5 and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are they let's pray together lord jesus we thank you so much for your word lord as i was just expressing to the people here just just a few seconds ago the meaning and the effect of this great letter lord jesus there are times that i don't feel your presence or times that i don't feel angels around me times i don't feel strengthened from saints there's something comforting about the bible to be able to open it up and to be able to read these words just to be able to hold it close to us and to be able to know that this was the very thoughts of god on paper lord we are so appreciative from being able to write and read from the writings rather of the things that have been lord not only just put on paper but people have given their lives for what we've read tonight we thank you lord for this great bible but yet a strange thing would be said by the apostle paul many years after pentecost had come when he lets us know that the letter kills but the spirit gives life so father tonight we pray that you will come by your anointing that you'll place the anointing of the holy spirit upon this book tonight and that you will edifice by our gathering together may the holy ghost take this word this evening and quicken it to our hearts open our hearts that we may receive open my heart that i may give use me as a vessel now lord and give us the strength that we need lord jesus to understand what you would speak to us tonight by thy word in the name of jesus jesus christ we pray bless every person in divine presence and those that will be streaming online we pray the holy ghost we'll meet them right with their aunt do great things lord healing of the body and moving upon their minds and their thoughts and whatever more they might have need of tonight as we commit this to you lord in the name of jesus christ amen and all the saints said amen you may be seated may the lord bless you what are blessings you know i guess if i took a poll and i sat down with all of you and i maybe had a survey laid out of different questions about what you might think blessings are i imagine every single one of us would probably be in a different mindset about what blessings are some of us would probably say perhaps that you know that the blessings of god are financial maybe somebody would say that the blessings of god are um you know perhaps maybe the way that god would heal bodies or bring peace to marriages or bring peace to children maybe it would be the way that god has blessed a business and all of those things are degrees of blessings it's true that they all have their levels of blessings if you will god does bless us in those manners but the true blessing of god and the blessing that i want to certainly try to emphasize tonight is a whole lot deeper than just the blessing that we get whenever we are maybe offered extra in the paycheck or we've been given a promotion or some kind of new thing has happened and we've been upped in life but the last thing that i want to talk about is on this wise the true blessing of god which is the indwelling of the holy spirit and then from that baptism of the holy ghost we are led into the things of god into the revelation of the holy spirit and that revelation takes us into a deep understanding of who jesus christ is who we are and how we all fit together in this program of god so i want to liken for you tonight and kind of parallel if you will the blessing the word blessing of god or that word blessings with the word repentance and i'd like to use if i could just as an example the message of future home when brother branham explains to us repentance and you have to understand when brother adam goes to approach a repentance this way it's probably the first time that most anybody had ever heard repentance approached this way but he talked about that repentance could come so far that a person used the days of noah when they come to the anne luvion and god saved eight on the ark through the floods and he talked about that being salvation in the form or the type of a christian with the earth paralleling a christian's life he said that the earth was saved in the days of noah even the bible speaks about eight being saved or salvation being applied to those time periods into those days but then notice that he talked about sin coming out on the other side so salvation or repentance as we would look at the type of it the earth as it was come up to the altar give its heart to god got saved and then got baptized but there was nothing prepared inside the earth or nothing made of a fire baptism to turn the earth into its original condition by spoken word which would have been without sin diseased germ there had been no wars that have been none of these type of things had salvation been fully given to the earth in the days of noah we would already be in the paradises of god with the new study setting here and science of god going in and out but now remember the earth got saved but there was only a degree of salvation that took it so far then brother mike is that to an individual that the same exact thing happens for those that will hear acts 2 38 they'll repent they'll repent and they'll come up so far and yet not go all the way into the baptism of the holy ghost by the way judas was such a person that had repented justified which is repentance and then sanctified even by the blood of jesus christ when jesus said by the word of god i mean to say that he said sanctify him by thy word thy word is truth that was judas all the way up through sanctification even repentant to the spot to where that jesus could even share part of his holy ghost given ministry with all 12 disciples judas included so the degree of repentance that he had brought him all the way up to that point to where that he kissed he kisses jesus in the garden of gethsemane and then turns away as we know the rest of the story satan enters into him at the supper and then judas goes to his place so repentance carried him that far but yet he did not receive full repentance you understand that a person whether they're in a message church or out of a message church could hear the message of salvation and just and that's saint john 3 16 god so loved the world he gave and here that they could repent and be saved by jesus christ and actually receive salvation to a degree to a degree that they can even be saved from the world be saved from maybe habits of alcohol or drugs or abuses of some kind uh some kind of misabuse with their body perhaps or homosexual or you know just some kind of a thing out there running around causing havoc all the time and they can hear the gospel preached and actually repent to the point to where that they are saved now listen close but that does not mean if a person is saved that does not mean they are baptized with the holy ghost remember the earth has been saved since the days of noah but the earth don't have the holy ghost yet it will take a period of time in which that the holy spirit will come upon this earth and give it its fiery baptism and then revert it back to the original back to what god intended in the very beginning no diseased germs brother i haven't talked about the holy fire of god will cleanse the atmosphere around us they won't have to wear any mask in heaven because there won't be any respiratory diseases none of that all of the atmosphere will be cleansed 100 completely cleansed out there won't be any disease germs or demonology or nothing for the for demons to work with for all of that will be cleansed at its fire baptism same thing with you when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost all sins of unbelief and all these other things were completely purged out of your soul remember when a person friend is truly born again of the holy spirit any evilness or any meanness or anything contrary to the word as completely taken out of their heart when you see folks that claim to be saved and forever see the holy ghost and they're still struggling and battling with that old temper my wife had a good remark we were speaking about an individual yesterday that has been in church for many many many years and we love this brother and we love we appreciate him but it's just we've known him since we were a little bitty and you know he he claims to be a believer and he claims to be a christian but yet he's got the same attitude the same type nature he's never had any kind of evident change in his life whatsoever and as much as i love this man as much as i would want to help this man i realize that until a person fully gives their heart or the throne room of their heart for jesus to set down upon that throne room i don't care how much they go to church i don't care how much they read the message i don't care how holy they might be they can give a tenth of their living and offering every time they walk through the door and be the best a manner in the service praise the lord any takers on that one tonight amen there could be all of that but yet at the very same time still never move into the real condition of being born again by the holy spirit this is why the prophet of god taught us and this is why the bible taught us that there will be those that can come right up to the border and they can taste of the heavenly gift they can partake of supernatural things and yet never cross fully over into that realm so we know then that that be the way with repentance the blessings of the lord are exactly the same way now mind you i'm going to have to kind of skim through some of this have to do your homework later because i can't get all these scriptures in and be out of here at a reasonable time but when we look at what jesus said about the rain remember the rain is a type of the holy ghost as we know we go back into the days of moses whenever the manna was falling the manna had rained down out of heaven that was a type of the holy ghost and then jesus said that the rain falls on the just and it also falls on the unjust don't forget friends and let's not be deceived into believing that every person that feels the holy spirit is truly a child of god every person that walks on the face of this planet let a good rain come out of the heavens whether they're they could be the awfulest human being and i'll just hold back on making details of it but they could be the worst human being to ever walk the face of this planet and they can enjoy the rain the same as the best person to ever walk shoe leather because the rain and the sun and all of that it shines and it rains and it falls upon any human being that can walk out upon the face of this earth the same way with the blessings of god god can bless any person i don't care who they are whether they be a prostitute whether they be a drunkard whether it be a liar whether they be any part of them that may not have any christianity at all if they learn how to operate the law of god they can be blessed to a degree uh many years ago i was in in concert with a brother a pastor in the message that had taught his children to always pay tithes and pay offerings now this one young man he was a uh he was a businessman a very successful businessman he spent a lot of his time building up businesses and let me tell you something his own father would say this is the most deceitful cruel backbiting undercut human being on the face of the planet when he made a business deal if he thought that she was going to cheat you that just made the whole deal that much sweeter for him but this man had been taught to pay tithes and to give offerings and because he had always been faithful paying ties and had always been faithful to paying offerings he said his own father would testify this low down this low down creature my son that needs the baptism of the holy ghost and needs to get saved worse than any person i know i've watched god bless him in a degree because he would do that much of the word and that's true the prophet talked about how that a prostitute could walk up through the prayer line hear the gospel of salvation hear the gospel of healing and step right into that atmosphere and believe the lord for healing and walk out on the platform completely healed and a staunch christian he said walk out completely defeated what we have to be careful of and please allow me a moment to plug this in here quickly before we go on and don't forget this what we've got to be mindful of is that blessings within itself does not make the approval from god for you if a person is blessed and what we call blessings i think a lot of time is just maybe they've just learned how to work on the devil's side a little bit you know satan has the ability to make things happen in the world i'll agree with that i'm sure i mean let's just face facts elections and things like that are decided let's not be let's not be simple in our mind let's let's think deeply really we say well the lord is the one that puts the kings in and puts the kings out i agree with that but also the devil has a big say in how all of that operates he knows how to rally people together he knows how to put this together and that politic together and this thing together and satan knows exactly how to construct the perfect plan and god just lets him do it because whatever god's will is he's going to allow the devil to do what he needs to do in order to work out the plan of god hey listen i'm just i'm just as hurt and deeply and cry every night that trump didn't get in a second time just like you are i cry every night about it just like you do but somehow another almighty god had a purpose in the way that our election went just this past election there is a reason that things don't go in a certain direction and there's a reason some people are what we call blessed in this life and a reason why some people aren't i'm going to try my best to burst this little balloon that some of us live under tonight and pardon me if you wondering what i'm doing uh my uh my uh my i've got that little device on did i tell you about it my sugar's on that thing and it keeps trying to go out on me and i'm trying to keep it alive where i can walk but you remember when we were talking some time ago let me just let me just lay this in to you quickly before we go into the real depth of what i want to say we were talking some time ago here at the church sometime last year about you know how that sometimes people feel like if god really loved them that he would bless them with abundances remember us talking about this some time ago well that particular talk here is what led me into this tonight and i guess i've shared this with half the country already just in the last few months and the thing that i discovered when i was preaching this is how many people actually tie god's love and his approval and favor to the level of what they think is blessings and what we've got to be careful of is we've got to realize blessings are not always what we think blessings are i'm glad y'all are hollering amen to that because what we're getting ready to get into might be a little sticky are you ready galatians chapter 3 verse 13. now the blessing for the bride is not necessarily financial right a lot of times god's children are not rich people as far as paying tithes and things go i hear a lot of preachers preaching about how that god will bless you financially but listen if you pay your tithes and offers god does a whole lot more than bless you financially he blesses your prayer life he'll bless your marriage he'll bless your walk with god he'll give you peace come on now he'll bless you in a whole lot more ways than just money the bible said that a wise man leaves an inheritance to his children i've been thinking about this for a couple of weeks myself being a daddy and i've got girls coming up i think what kind of inheritance can i leave for them i keep thinking lord with as much money as goes out in this ministry on gas and all these other kind of things i better get to me a job at mcdonald's pretty quick or walmart greeter or something i better start stocking up and it seemed like i was going into the store the other day and it seemed like the holy spirit said to me is that the only thing you think inheritance is that's not the only part of inheritance how about leaving for them the ability to know how to pray how to love how to read the bible how to behave in church how to treat other people is that not also friends a type of an inheritance that we can leave for our children well don't the world leave that type of inheritance for their people how they treat them and how they speak and how they act sure it's on the negative side of course but don't they leave that inheritance for the next generation how to steal and how to deceive and how to punch somebody in their mouth that they talk cross to you well if that be an inheritance for them why don't we leave the same kind of inheritance only on the positive side to our children how to talk how to act how to behave how to love what greater inheritance could i leave to my children than to teach them how to find out what 10 of their money is it's really not that hard of all of the mathematics we want our children to learn that's the one problem we never let them figure out and it cripples them you say how do you know because i was one of those kids because my mother and father was raised up in a generation of people that were told just take your money and send it down to jeff just send it off because it wasn't harder than the preachers around the area we was that to have confidence in enough to give them money mom and dad just kind of have the idea well we'll do it in this way and that way and the other so i never was taught to pay tithes hang on but i was it was 2003 when i moved to tennessee before i even learned how to do it hallelujah well we're gonna get down to some real confession time here because i was taught don't do it i could read the bible like you could but i didn't understand what i was doing i didn't understand the emphasis of what i needed to do every time i'd get money the lord would tell me you didn't pay tithes on that i said well where am i slow setting them how am i supposed to do it i didn't have an understanding a bit more than a man in china's expression goes and then i went to work at pizza hut with reverend dale potter now if you knew anything about brother dale there wasn't a tie i used to have a little pencil bag that i used to keep the tips in and when we would come back with the end of the night we had to cash out so much of the money they give us to start with and turn back so much of that at the end of the night i lost count of the times he would walk to that register and first words out of his mouth are you gonna pay tithes and offers off that aren't you son because god knew i had a genuine desire to do the right thing i wanted to know how to do it how in the world did i get in the middle of this here we are and here he come all of a sudden i thought one night i thought i've escaped him and i was running out the back door i was so sick of hearing it and i got in my car i started that baby up i heard crap crap crap crap crap crap i rolled my window down he goes you didn't pay ties and offers on that money tonight didn't he now mind you i had stockpiled for about two months every dime i had ever made didn't spend a dime of it because i was scared to death and all at once i sat down and started praying lord i'm so confused what am i supposed to do about all this and the holy spirit very simply very sweetly allows several things to come along in my life that just taught me this is how you do it this is how you handle it this is what you do i have lost count of the times in 17 years full-time ministry 18 actually this night to the 19th of may 18 years of full-time ministry i can tell you not one time but what god had always showed up for me and has always blessed me and has always took care of me after the vote over yonder most of you knew i got a salary when i was at the church out there it was about a thousand dollars a month that's what i brought and i used that for preaching and when i the vote had changed and the church changed hands i had lost that particular uh money because all of the salaries would go away my mother david took over that was just part of their program what they had i told the lord i said god that thousand dollars is pretty important to me and i was standing in an airport getting ready to fly to philadelphia and i had my ipod with me and i was just going to scroll through and find the message to preach uh to listen to brother the brahmin preached and i took my ipod and i went like this i went and the first words out of brother branham's mouth was i could stand here all day and testify to you that if you make a dollar give god 10 cents and you're offering and he'll always take care of you and i thank you lord and he has he has always taken care of us now we say blessings of god actually that was a blessing to me not because of the money part but because it was an area of my life that i needed correction in actually i needed understanding more than i needed correction it was never that i had an unwilling heart to do the right thing i just didn't know what to do hey listen folks when you're raised up in a return ministry church no the thing you hear is going to be a bit more even know how to love somebody or pray much less anything else everything i learned i learned it from the preachers that i followed and i learned it from the holy spirit with my bible and this message open teaching me just like i explained to you just now that's a blessing of god but it comes with hardship sometimes lord you got a hold of the car steering wheel tonight i'm just going to let you do the driving okay now let's read this in in galatians look at this in chapter 3 verse 13 christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written watch us now curse it as every man everyone that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through chief jesus christ through faith what a strange way to couple together blessings cursed is one that hangs on a tree that we could be blessed so the very precursor to your blessing is hanging on a tree now friends if the blessing of abraham is important for you and i then there must have been something in that man's life that we can parallel out today would you agree there must be some similar something in his life to us somehow we're a match piece if we receive the blessing of abraham it's going to come the same way it came to abraham all right let's look at it paul's speaking about the cross as we know this is the tree refers to the cross that jesus hung on he had to hang there before the blessing could come on you and i is that right and jesus said you take up your cross so in order for us to be fully blessed and receive the full blessing of god not just the partial blessing now as i said before some come up so far and they stop i mean let's take for example elvis presley was elvis blessed with a good voice yes brother brown said jesus gave the boy a good voice a lot of these rock and roll singers and these pop and r b and neo soul and funk and all these guys can they sing show they can can they play music sure they can they've been blessed with gifts to be able to unlock the gift of music god's the one to give them that that is unless you don't believe james 1 17 that said every good and perfect gift cometh down from the father of lights a perfect gift can come to you but it's what you do with that gift that's going to determine its perfection remember you can take a gift of god and send yourself to hell with it let's look at some of the preachers in our uh our lifetime could preach could exhort had great charisma had the ability to take the bible and thread things together on and on and on and on and then turned around and deceived a bunch of people sent their soul right to hell i mean friends don't you understand that the most dangerous human being on the planet is a religious one without the holy ghost well you say that's not so dangerous really let's look at apparel if a man walked in this back door right now with a gun and his hand started blowing us away and there was 30 of us went by the way of the grave what's more dangerous him coming in here and taking out 30 of us or some deceiving preacher standing on a television and preaching to 5 billion people around the world and leading them all into the world council of churches in the mark of the beast tell me who's more dangerous religion has always been the most deceiving dangerous thing that a person could play with praise god saints satan is not a dangerous person because he's a drunk or a drug addict satan is dangerous as he's religious for the bread he knows the bible he knows the message he understands supernatural things and elements of supernatural gifts and workings and outworkings of the holy spirit he understands every bit of that that's what makes him dangerous so you take an individual that's going to really come to the full blessing of god listen there is a way that they must choose if they want to be really truly genuinely blessed by god jesus referred to it as the broadway and the narrow way many be that find the broad way but he said few will find the narrow why because it's a rugged hard difficult it's full of crosses it's full of disappointments it's full of ups it's full of downs come on now it's not an easy way to serve christianity it's not an easy way to serve the lord i don't care what preacher tries to tell you it is christianity is not a flowery bed of ease and when they present it like it's a bunch of joys of shouting on the mountain all the time they are lying through their teeth that is not christianity christianity is bearing a cross oh you see but isn't there a blessing sure but i'll ask you some of you christians have been here serving the lord for many years if you want to take a piece of paper draw a line down the middle and put blessing on one side and burdens on the other how many tallies would you put in the bird inside more likely you'd probably outweigh what blessings you feel like you've received but this is the principle that paul is establishing that if you want the blessing of abraham there's a cross to bear jesus help us lord now let's take the life of abraham turn me to genesis chapter 17. this is what you call holy ghost autopilot tonight completely the opposite direction of where i intended to go but that's all right he the boss i just work here genesis 17 1 look at this and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said i am the almighty god praise the lord walk before me and be thou perfect wait a minute lord do you know that you're talking to a heathen are you aware of the fact you're talking to an idol worshiper are you aware of the fact you're talking to a non-un irreligious man who don't know nothing about you who has sat in his shop and watched his daddy carve idols on the tower of babel are you aware of that lord that you're talking to a man who's a heathen even his name abram that was not a gentile christian like matthew luke there's a heathen name that didn't come from the bible because you see the bible wasn't he wrote yet when you read that book genesis the one that opened on your lap moses wrote that many many years after the life of abraham so there's no bible here that's gone that's out there's no church there's no pastor there's no preaching there's no music there's no singing there's worship the man is a heathen and god is asking him to walk in perfection it makes you wonder sometimes if the lord really knows what he's doing when he does things read these things in the bible you think god aren't you aware in our carnal mind the way we would read the scripture that would be the way we would approach it you know y'all are looking at me but that's exactly the attitude we have a lot of times when the lord chooses to bless somebody and work with them and anoint them and save them and fill them with the holy ghost or something great with their lives we may not ever speak it out of our little mealy mouths but there's a big part of us that's in the back of our mind going don't you know who that is lord oh i know some of you holy cherubims tonight are too holy to be able to say man any of this but the saints of god had the same problem when they saw saul walk in the door god changed his name to paul but remember they knew him as saul and the bible said they were afraid of him because they thought he was a spy that's what i love about my lord when he makes choices it may not make sense to you or i but it fits because once god gets done with this man it's going to fit praise god same with you when god gets done with you you're going to be like a hand in the glove don't ever worry that you won't have a place in the body of christ that's why he's been working on you all these years getting him rough edges off you and getting you honed down because he's got a spot in his mind where you fit in this great pyramid of god and he's just waiting to get you the right spot to go as long as you got that temper or whatever it is he's working on it's going to be hard for you to fit in there he's been jamming it like trying to put a square peg around hole so he got to keep chopping at you whoo preach by the bin now as he keeps working on me as he keeps shaving me down i've got to place a position but this is as rough as it gets this is not an easy thing that's happening here come on folks god is asking a heathen to walk in perfection how is abraham going to do this if god asks us to do something like this then the lord is obligated to make a way for us to do exactly what he asked us ever do it's gone well i feel the holy ghost watch this in verse 2 and i'll make my covenant aren't you glad you said it is between me and thee and i will multiply thee exceedingly and abram jumped up and said hallelujah hallelujah praise our god now you're looking at me when you should be looking at verse three because abram was like you and i when god tells us things sometimes he fell on his face and left me pardon me lord but don't you know that i'm 99 years old a little bit just a bit too old to have children aren't you aware you know sometimes i think the lord could talk to us i think he'd almost smack us in the back of the head and say dummy of course i know these things i don't need your input just hush and do what i'm asking you to do we gotta get our fingers and every little thing that moves and just like abram we fall down and we laugh sometimes don't think we don't don't think we don't sometimes the very things that god asked us to do we considered to be ridiculous sure but here's what i love about abram well god made this covenant with him watch here and verse 4 as for me behold my covenant is with thee notice god didn't say abraham if you'll be a good boy and you'll behave yourself for the next 25 years i'll do this for you god said i've already done it search your bible now i've already accomplished my vision praise god i'm just going to set the thing up and you're going to be a part of it whether you like it or not so for 25 years abram abra abram had to bear this cross right here of god coming to him and saying walk do you know that abram never even heard where he was supposed to walk y'all got that part right god never told him where he just said walk what a crazy thing where am i going lord it's none of your business just keep walking we're not built that way are we when the lord speaks to us we want to know time date we want our own little special gps established for our predestinated value we want to be able to come in to christ and him tell us to do something when we'd be able to go boop boop boop boop turn left at lady oseah go straight through to peace in point four of a mile you will have victory in point twelve of a mile you you'll come out of this trial and you'll turn right at joy we would love to have such a thing you talk about a preacher becoming a multi-multi-trillionaire if you could invent a system that would tell them what the next few minutes of their life would behold you'd be you'd be wealthy overnight because as human beings we always want to see the end of the picture but god reserves to his own will matters like that he just tells us to walk and expects us to do what he asked i might not be running all over the platform tonight but man are we preaching deep tonight bone deep soul deep spirit deep life deep well you say but brother ben i want god to bless me huh do you what kind of blessings are you talking about the one man went down to church you go or when you get up in the morning you look in your bank account and there's 40 million dollars in your account glory to god if some of you all had money like that drop into your bank account you would be backslid in five minutes because the whole world would come off your shoulders and everything else in your life would be beneath you from that moment on it'd be beneath you to go to church with them a bunch of poor people be beneath you to drive the cars like they drive it's one reason god don't bless us with such things like that because we wouldn't take that attitude it would be beneath us so god said i'm going to make a covenant and this covenant i'm going to swear it by me because i know already you can't keep this i mean god hadn't even got the words out of his mouth and abraham's already cackling not only is he laughing but he falls on his face laughing you know what i love about jesus what i love about the lord none of this discouraged him none of this made jesus feel hurt at abram none of this made him take a big step back and go oh might as well give up this boy never going to get it you see that's the thing about him he already knows what kind of reaction we're going to give him but those reactions like that one are only for a moment in time god ain't looking for those little micro tiny moments in our life to where we're gonna be like this because he knows the entire end of the journey remember predestination that's the mystery and the secret of predestination is that god knows what you were predestinated to because of his foreknowledge he can look all the way down through the pathway of your life and tell what you're going to do and where you're going to wind up and what kind of choices you're going to make that's why i said jacob i loved he saw hated he didn't hate esau just because he just didn't like the boy the hatred he had toward esau was a perfect hatred a god hatred does god despise that anti-spirit i know it's hard to quote to the saint john 3 16 people when you got that one laying in their hand i thought god loved you also said if you'll reject me i'll laugh at your calamity i'll make fun of you because the lord don't play around when it comes to these things we either take it seriously or we meet the end of the we meet we meet it down at the end of the road ah you say oh brother ben why did god do this to abram he was going to bless him that's why but before the blessing could come abram was going to have to pick up a cross and bear it for a while could you imagine what it must have looked like it's supper that night when he sets down next to little white-haired sarah maybe a little shawl around her shoulders round-rimmed glasses on the end of her nose she got wrinkles all over her face and her arms and her age is showing and him sit down there and she take one of them great big old thick steaks and lay it down before him and set some of that goat milk on the table and he goes i got something to tell you well what is it you're gonna be your mother what why'd you say speak up you know my hearing's about god i can't hear you will you mambo i said god met me today and told me i'm going to be a father of nations and you're going to be the mother i imagine it wasn't the first time that sarah had laughed at this when the angel saw her in the tent i imagine it wasn't the first time she laughed she probably had watched this man carry this on you know how people are sometimes you have hard families people will say things and you just humor them for a while you know it happens that way in the sports world and and other type of venues and professions and things like that you know you take some kid when he's a boy and he's going to be a professional wrestler some spindly little skinny thing don't even have a muscle on him the next thing you know he becomes like hulk hogan or one of these guys and people laugh at him for years yeah sure until the vision comes together and then he accomplishes the very thing that was in his heart when people were laughing at him abraham was probably this kind of man he probably was known throughout town to be a little you know one of these days i'm going to be a daddy and maybe somebody in the tool shop that night poor old abraham i've never seen him this bad you know they got that new thing out there they say eating all that drinking all the goats milk and that cow's milk gives people that forgetfulness like that that's what's happened to him he's ingested too much of that goat's milk and his brain is deteriorating but you know the bible said and i i would be persuaded to believe if we looked at this in real time not the fantasy world that is created in our minds through evangelistical preaching and the dramas that are set before us but if you looked at this in real time abram is walking along the road and god stops him in his tracks and speaks to him the whole thing probably took as a matter of a few minutes the holy ghost left him he went on about his business a normal day like everybody else and then god left him sat there like that for years before he ever spoke to him again speak to us tonight lord people probably thought something is wrong with this man i imagine he probably thought it himself there was probably a great portion of his own thinking how could this be but you see when the lord meets you when you really have an experience like that with god it leaves such a mark on you that you can't doubt that it happened you can't deny that it took place and you cannot figure out why either people get in their mind when brethren had these great experiences and many of these men of god had these great experiences that they always understood every word of it they did not don't be deceived many times that god would meet brother branham he was standing there coming out of a vision he said the other day i heard him he said i stand with my hand out like this screaming not knowing it was not going to be the end of my life thank you it was going to be the end of my lilac to him he didn't come down and speak to on the whole of the matter he just let him go through the vision he'd come right out of the experience he knew it was god but he couldn't explain it abram was the same way he comes right out of this how many months minutes years days i was preaching this other day i think it was in kentucky somewhere another and uh over on the other side of kentucky down by lexington side down there and there was a little girl come up to me after service and she rang off it was some kind of like it was in the hundred thousand some kind of a number how many days it was she was sitting there doing the math after i'd just how many minutes how many days how many hours did he have to sit and wait in the beginning i doubt that abraham even believed it himself but it could not get away from the presence of the impression of that supernatural that had met him on his walk and told him walk before me abraham you can't deny them things when god meets you like that there nobody can talk you out of it that's why i said about these outfits out here running around putting websites up and these people around trying to trash the message and put preachers down and all that they never met god about one time in their life because i'm telling you right now brother if you ever meet the god of this message and the god of this bible there's not a website there's not a preacher there's not a hypocrite there's not a saying there's nobody can talk you out of the thing that god places inside of your heart because when the lord makes an entrance into your life he leaves a lasting impression when he does it so here too he wakes up he looks in the mirror he's still an old man and yet he can hear the voice of god walk before me abraham and be thou perfect god could have spoke to him again sure but he didn't need to he had given abraham all of the advice he needed for that time all he needed to know was what god told him to do walk and don't you realize friends when you go back and look in your bible map you've got scofields and thompson thompson chains if it's got the map of abraham's walk in there go look at it his very footsteps is what put the borders of israel in place because everywhere he walked was the possession of god and that was the inheritance of the children of israel hallelujah even the very place that him and melchizedek had had communion on that's the very spot he said that the mountain will push up a new jerusalem will set right down on top of that mountain on the very spot that they had communion why did abraham come down letting god tell him abraham now you need to take this herb and this vitamin and you need to go to this gene replacement therapy and uh he told him everything he needed to do walk walk and be perfect okay lord so as we all know anytime you're starting out with anything you never start out perfect do you anybody ever play music they don't start out playing it perfectly i've been playing all my life i still hit bad notes and i still get rhythms off and i still miss things but i just keep walking one of the keys to music by the way you musicians in here is if you do hit a bad spot don't stop keep playing it's 99 percent of the time the people are sitting in the congregation or the audience or wherever they might be they can't understand what you're doing now they don't know you made a mistake so just keep going unless you're in competition like i was in the nationals when i was eight and my mistake was what caused me to lose the nationals it was obvious because we all get those blunders we all have those moments where you can't keep going that's one of those come fast moments stop everything until we get it straightened out but otherwise you just keep moving i played with some musicians where i needed to call a solemn fast they were messing everything up rhythms were off beads were off but if it's nothing major you just keep going right why stop if you're just going to stumble a little bit god said walk so that's the objective okay so if i start out left right left thank god he wasn't a sister you sister sisters that i had a hard time with that left and right you all ain't like my wife and my mother-in-law y'all know left and right well praise the lord got some good sisters in here even my little daughter of the day analysts put your left hand out schwinn i've i've met a lot of women that didn't know left and right that's all i'm saying there's an arkansas here the other day and it was all laughing there were six of them sitting there and said we were driving down the road and i told her i said turn left and she went right every time anyway but here went left left right maybe that right foot maybe he got on shaky ground his foot twisted a little bit maybe he stumbled maybe he fell down maybe he wasn't able to hold his position but what did god tell him to do really it's that simple so he didn't say you'll fall you'll stop you just said walk okay so god if that's the objective if i'm supposed to walk then everything else is secondary to what i'm supposed to do praise god same thing happens with you and i when god tells us to serve him to live for him to pray to love him to do whatever it might be he's not bringing into account the fact that you won't stumble you will the fact that you may not know left from right huh some of y'all are hung up on that thing agent i don't mean no harm it was something to make you smile but if a christian says all right god you want me to walk and they fall down on their face what am i supposed to do what was my orders lay there quit throw my hands up and blame the message blame the pastor blame the preacher blame the people i was told to walk so if i'm laying there and i'm squalling and feeling sorry for myself i'm not doing what the lord told me to do because god told me to walk so that's what i've got to do i've got to walk remember when it comes to another part of his journey god changes this man's name from abram to abraham you know that when he first meets the heathen king he lies about sarah and god meets this man in a dream he tells this man you've got another man's wife remember the story but look at it again after his name was changed abraham was still up to the same old tricks the moment he got confronted he got scared and he lied a second time and to show that something had really taken place this king had fallen in love with grandma praise god it goes to prove that the blessing that come to their bodies when god changed them back to a young man and a young woman praise the lord it was something that god had done for them after many years of when's it going to happen abraham could you imagine year 12 they don't know that they've got all the new years left they're sitting at the dinner table she asked him when is god going to do this thing that god's supposed to do you sure you got it right abraham that's what he told me to do there well but i just don't see any manifestation of it he said i don't either but you know what the bible said he grew strong did you catch him words he grew strong in other words he didn't start that way i just read it to you we just read it together he did not start with that kind of supernatural strength to believe god and not stagger isn't it amazing when paul writes this man's divine commentary that he uses the words he did not stagger look at how paul took it and associated it right with what god told him to do walk because no matter how many times throughout his journey that he might have stumbled or he might have called it a maybe i thought it was in his mind i've missed the boat i've missed god altogether there was a tie post for him back here it actually goes back to genesis 12. if you want to look at the first time god spoke to him he tells him to separate himself from everybody and the bible said a lot went with him and god never didn't fully bless that man until he fully obeyed the lord that's one reason they had to cause the fuss between lot and abraham in the first place because lot needed to go just like you and i god wants to bless us beyond measure bless and abundance but we got a that we carry with us and sometimes you got to separate yourself from the lot that you carry you all amen again you've forgiven me for the left and right comment then amen good so here god speaks to this man and something is so impressed upon him that no matter what takes place in his body listen this was not 25 years of no doctor's visits no pains no eggs no sicknesses none of that he would wake up perhaps year 11 might have been the worst year of his life he might have been sicker had worse arthritis he might have had rheumatism he might have been prone to fevers he might have been prone to all kinds of things who would have known maybe old abraham year 11 come to his deathbed we don't know because them years are silent in the scripture maybe the talk around town was yeah he almost bit it the other day bought the farm they say well you know he's 105 years old anyways still believing god's going to give him a son poor old fella well you know that's how old people are they get a little senile in those ages could you imagine what he would have had to endure from the conversation of the people around him that listen that never had his experience this is why they could ridicule they never had the experience this man had because as if god had met them the same way he had met abraham they would have never been laughing at him or making fun of it have been believing god with him this is why sometimes friends when the lord speaks to you be careful who you share it with because those people if they've not had your experience they never can put themselves in your shoes and they'll never be able to support you right maybe he'd wake up look in the mirror oh but he remembered whoa get the eye see hot sarah i am tore all the pieces the devil would probably come to this man and tell him don't forget the devil's a part of this equation satan probably come to him and said you know you you've lost it there's no way god's going to do this for you don't forget friends this was not the first time that god trans related to human body the devil knew that god had the ability to do it knowing that abraham didn't know about that kind of power he wasn't around when he knocked was around he wasn't around when abraham was around he was not he was not did not have the inside information as it was to know that god would translate a human being like this satan would say you're you're just something wrong with you but all of a sudden in his weakest moments he would draw back into that into his mind and go back to that place where he knew god met him you see this is why every single one of us must have a thai post come on preach to me somebody we've got to have somewhere we can go back to brother benham said what affected paul more than anything else is when he was standing there holding the code of stephen he said that paul's life this is a man that had already went through all kinds of things when it comes to the christian church and this one experience with stephen changes him you see the lord knows the right moment and the right time to get your attention so here he's standing in his mind he's thinking back to what the lord spoke to him his thoughts he's going but i know that was god i know it was him it has to be him and just like every other christian does they start looking at all the evidences up from the time god spoke to him of all the things the lord has done for him since then maybe he went back to year 11 when he was on his deathbed and said i could have died they'd give me up that year but here i am somehow still going all of a sudden now he's growing into a place of strength glory to god we're not out instead of doubting and he starts worshiping because the bible said he grew strong giving praise to god brother adam said he watered what god had laid down in the side of his heart [Applause] remember the blessing of abraham is what's to come to us friends if i keep on this trail we ain't gonna get out of here early let me just let me just fast forward to where we need to go the fact of the matter is we've been sitting in these message churches right now for 60 years waiting on the rapture waiting on the translation waiting on the bride to get ready how many more sermons do we have to hear to know it's time to get ready that's what i said the other day i i get so tired and i'm not wore out with brother brown's name or the quotes or the message when i say this i get so tired of preachers brother branham brother brown brother brother brother they're saying a lot but they're not taking us nowhere we need men of god that aren't just going to quote it but take me somewhere don't just read me the statement take me somewhere you quote every scripture in the bible but if you can't position me for where i am right now in 2021 what good does it do to quote it and we've been hearing these things all of our lives how many of you kids have been raised on a message pew my hands up too look at you how far back in your mind can you go to all of the times you've heard the message is going to get the bride ready well then what in the world are we waiting on god ain't gonna tell us that part it's our business to keep this just keep walking it's across the bear you know it's difficult sometimes when god puts us in a position to where we just can't see the end result our churches are getting smaller colder creatures are dying left and right these old guards are going off the scene left and right right and there's not a lot of replacements coming up like it was in the 80s or the 90s where you got you got 12 preachers in a church at a time back in the 80s and the 90s there were people all over the field evangelism was so high you couldn't have kept off the field if you wanted to now look at it i can count on one hand the preachers that are evangelists running around the united states right now one hand why are we living in this abrahamic age what's god doing why are things cooling off in such a direction listen because god wants us to bear this kind of cross before the blessing comes remember in the last day the ladies were to endure hardness hang on everybody but he called it the hardness and the pressure of easy living it used to be for some of you older christians in here it used to be that when you got discouraged you go into your prayer closet you pray you'd be speaking in tongues shouting and hollering crying and squalling in a matter of a few seconds you come out and everything be all right now you go get in prayer and it takes you or two hours you walk you pray your labor you fight you struggle and come right out of the closet sometimes you know further down the road where he was when he went in why the spirit of god brother joe is lifting up off of the planet and all of us are feeling the influence because remember the real blessing of abraham was this listen not that he was a blessed man because he was rich not that because he had lots of possession not because he had great fun he was in great lands and great things but the real blessing of abraham was he could wait for god to do what god promised he was going to do brother brown said the reason eve got in trouble is because she couldn't wait i counsel young people and i counsel older people the same way all the time some of these cases that get in a situation and they can't hardly wait to get married i tell them wait it out pray about it study about it make sure you're making the right decisions don't just jump into things i talked to an individual here the other day in the 60s three or four living wives oh i just i just can't live alone i said yeah that's the problem you had that that weight problem not w-e-i-g-h-t but that w-a-i-t we got a lot of weight problems in the message the real character of the bride of jesus christ in the real hallmark of who she is is going to be the fact that she knows how to wait on the lord god had took this man and pulled him off to the side of the road and took him to a parking lot and parked him for 25 years what would that do to many of you if you knew that the coming of the lord was 60 years from now how would you live how would it change your attitude how would you behave that's one reason bill graham said god don't tell us because us gentiles were so lazy he said and i'm quoting he said we wait till the last minute to get ready so he just keeps it hanging in space some of y'all are looking at me [Laughter] back home i always knew when i had them they got quiet you all have an expression at least you got that much but you see the most difficult thing for any child of god is to hear the lord say i'm going to do this for you and never tell you and then you just sit okay so what am i supposed to do in the meantime the lord spoke to me a number of years ago nearly 20 years ago i was driving up the road and the holy spirit told me to be weary which is w-a-r-y or cautious and strengthen myself okay so i did that 20 years later i've been asking the lord okay what next but you see that's the key he hasn't given a new order so you just continue practicing the ones that give be cautious and strengthen yourself well you need to be because along about that time by the way was about the same time that some of the people i would sit in the back room with were days from leaving the message when i would go into the room and they'd call me aside to speak to me one such man down in alabama that was one of the first ones to leave the message had called me to the side sat me down and i was talking to him like a buddy and the holy spirit brought his word back to me be weary strengthen your self caution we didn't know that people are going to pack up and move out of here in droves we didn't realize people were gonna quit the truth about about 10 or 15 years ago like they have you think but what's going on they couldn't wait any longer the real test of our character is gonna come down to this one thing can you wait it out let's power heads while you're sitting there tonight thanking and you that are streaming online tonight i want you to consider the words that the lords give to us tonight because this was certainly not planned remember it's not he that begins the race it's he that finishes endurance stamina grit as they call it that's what gets a man or woman through a race burst of speed being able to run fast that only works in short little spurts of stunting and things like that but when you are in a marathon how fast you run don't matter it's whether or not you can make it all the way to the end of the thing friends i want you to consider in your heart tonight look at your life and study your your moves look at the areas of your life you're suffering in right now is the result of it because you've moved too quickly because you've pressed pushed beyond the will of god look at the areas that you're struggling in tonight look and just see if it isn't that very thing that might be hindering you even right now look at your prayer life when you go to pray are you patient do you wait on the lord when you ask him for something do you sit back and say okay lord i'm just going to wait on you now look at the way that you think about his word that's the way you think about even church like this tonight we're in such a hurry that you know and i i tried on these evening services like this midweek i try to be very mindful of the time i really do honestly i do but friends i also realize that when the holy spirit goes to speaking to us like he is right now we should take the time to be able to stop and listen to him see what he has to say in fact the matter is many of us gonna stand outside and talk for 20 minutes anyways why can't we give god extra time why can't we give it to him why because like with everything else in our life we're in a breakneck speed hurry jumping from one thing to another to another to another to another examine your heart tonight and you don't have to say to me or nobody else but just tell the lord lord i realize one reason but i'm not where i should be i just because i just haven't been waiting on you like i should there is strength in waiting did you know it's scriptural sometimes not to move paul said when you've done everything you can to stand just stand we preach in such a way god moving the holy spirit moving we want god to move yes but sometimes god wants us to stand still too told moses stand still see the salvation of the lord examine your heart tonight many of the bad decisions you've ever made in your life it's been made because you did it in haste because you didn't wait on god for the right season the right time now you forgive me for my little comment about the left and right and i have offended you while you're praying there don't let things like that hinder you i was only trying to make a little funny just try lightening the mood a little bit but think in your heart tonight lord jesus the area i get discouraged in the thing that i feel like you do you understand that's one thing that makes us feel like god don't love us because when he doesn't move at our speed we feel like some has been mean to us look at that part of your life patience the waiting in your patience possessions i want to pray for you tonight and you pray for me lord jesus in this atmosphere tonight where father you have completely taken over the message i can't say you hijacked the message but lord that's what we asked you to do is come and speak it's what you've done in a completely different direction than what i anticipated but father's for a purpose we're asking that your holy spirit will come into this place tonight and you will deal with every heart examine every heart and every life and deal with us lord help us in these areas to wait on you to be patient i remember many years ago lord i got myself into a little bit of a of a bad situation money-wise i'd done made some decisions financially and i got a few little credit cards and debts when i was just barely 19 20 lord you you know and how i spoke to you and cried out working my fingers to the bone trying to get them paid off and you spoke to me that time and said what are you in such a hurry for because you were going to provide for me you were going to help me take care of it the things i bought wasn't frivolous it just i should have waited a little longer before i made the decision to do it there were good things stuff i needed and you said to me what are you in such a hurry for lord i don't know about these people but i can certainly testify many of the boo-boos as brother graham called them that i've made in my life that come from not being patient so lord i pray you'll help me and help them help us lord to wait upon your presence and whatever area this may affect us tonight help us to wait develop this part of our life lord that we can wait in jesus name amen praise the lord thank you jesus thank you jesus how many here just feel like the lord has spoken to him will you raise your hands up to the lord you just feel like the lord has spoken to you tonight you just raise your hands up and say god i just want to commit to you lord a new outlook a new feeling in my heart a new direction of looking at things and from here tonight moving forward i want to be different i want to take this word i want to apply it to my life and be a different human being walk differently think differently hallelujah god help me so much lord please i'm not a patient person i should be but i'm not that's why i've always teased with you i hate a red light i hate to sit not do brother carol said it one time and i agree with him i'd rather take a whip and then i have to sit around wait for somebody at least get the whipping over with my whole life it's run jump but how many times has he told us brother joe just i'mma park you now put you in park pull the parking brake just wait now that's the hardest thing for us to do but children of god listen to brother ben if god told us that we can renew our strength if we can be a better christian by waiting on him then he'll give us the ability to be able to do what i'm preaching to you tonight me included don't kid yourself i need this as much as you do oh you say you're a preacher that ain't got not one thing to do with it i need this kind of message for myself tonight as well because god knows many things in this word that i would love to see accomplished tonight in my life but lord help me wait help me wait until you're done it's like i've said about being at a restaurant you've heard me use this analogy you could go to waffle house and get one of them steaks that are as tough as a three to three dollar steak that you get out of there you know and tough as shoe leather and all that or you can go to a restaurant and sit and wait for 45 minutes to an hour for him to cook you a good one the better comes after the waiting god help us wait help us be patient for those things many of you sitting here tonight praying for children praying for spouses praying for this praying for that praying for moves on on your job praying for moves in your body in your health some of you sitting here tonight maybe struggling with something in your health and you're saying god why don't you heal me he's trying to give us the answer to the message tonight wait just wait i know brother brad i'd shared it with him brother byler when i went to the doctor the other day the left eye was perfect and when i went out of that a guy said that right i was always going to give you trouble i walked out of there and i said my god don't do halfway stuff and just a few wednesdays ago i come out of the doctor's office they didn't even put in an injection or nothing in my eye they dilated the eye they looked in the eyeball and i've got a picture right here right now on my phone when they walked out of the office i snapped a photo of it i took it to three nurses and one doctor i spoke to a doctor just this weekend i hold up the two pictures and this girl who's a medical doctor been a friend of our family for many many years i said to her i said i said hey look at them two pictures right there and tell me what you think she said well who's this one and who's that one it's two different people in it i said no that's this guy right here 10 days apart i said look at this one here look at that one there and she said god healed you boy because the other one was perfect but this has been going on so for six months now actually even longer than that it started back in october since october you go to the lord and you say god i don't want to go blind he said all right i heal you but what do we do we want it right then right at that moment just wait if god pulls you into a parking lot and parks you just know there is a reason for it because a lot of times what's happening all these blessings back here probably just need to catch up with you hallelujah so the holy ghost parks you until all of this back here can catch up with you there is a law of sowing and reaping all the good you've done will keep up with you you will catch up eventually god bless your friends they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength stand with me they shall mount up with wings eyes and eagle they shall
