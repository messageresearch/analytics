Luke chapter 24 and then we're also going to read in the book of 1 Timothy chapter 3 amen before we read the word tonight maybe we just buy our hearts for word of prayer and I know the Lord has already spoke to us through the song service and the atmosphere has been created I wonder how many' say Lord take your word tonight and speak to my heart heart amen Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here this afternoon on this Wednesday evening Lord we're not gathered here out of form or fashion out of tradition Lord or out of a religious ritual but Lord we're gathered here tonight because we're Eagles and Lord your word has revealed in this age that wherever the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered together and Lord as Eagles hungry hearted Eagles here tonight Lord as we need natural bread to live we must have the spiritual bread and Lord your Prophet has t us that Lord the bread of life is the revelation of Jesus Christ and Lord there's nothing that we can Prevail by outside of Revelation so Lord tonight we're not Desiring just a good feeling or a good emotion but Lord we're Desiring the revelation of your word to strike our hearts oh God lord you see the knees that may be feeble the heavy hands oh God but Lord we have been told in your word that when that word which is the which is the truth becomes real and our hearts it'll strengthen the heavy hands Lord it'll strengthen the feeble knees Lord I've seen your word as it goes forth bring healing into sick bodies to bring Deliverance into bound lives Lord we yield ourselves to this word tonight come Among Us in a special way may you drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit Lord may you fill every heart with the things they have need of tonight and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory forgive us of our failures and our shortcomings Lord transform Us by Thy Word in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen St Luke chapter 24 and verse 49 Jesus here speaking he says and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tear ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high until you be endued with power from on high now in the book of 1 Timothy chapter 3 I want to read a verse there in 1 Timothy chapter 3 I want to read in the 15th verse 1 Timothy 3 just one verse there amen 1 Timothy 3 in verse 15 the Bible here says Paul writing to Timothy he says but if I T long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God I want you to notice what he says here which is the Church of the Living God is the pillar and ground of the truth amen which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to uh by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight if I would uh take a title here tonight I want to speak to you on this the powerful Church of the Living God Amen the powerful Church of the Living God in 1957 brother BR preaches a sermon what does it take to make a Christian Life he says now if the Church of the Living God which is the pillar of the truth so here a prophet identifies amen that the Church of the Living God is the Pillar of Truth he said now God intended this church to be a powerful church this is what God intended to be a powerful Church a glorious church amen a church that the whole world could look upon as a bride of Christ well expected and espoused and to live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that God would be proud of this church to present it to Christ at the coming of the Lord it should live in that characteristic in the church and it should be living that way so God has intentions for his church and it's not to be a powerless formal lukor church but it is to be a powerful Church it is to be a church amen that is displaying the characteristic of Jesus Christ tying spe 1955 he says I am positive sure this morning that if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul and their thinking and their attitudes would be perfect in the sight of God he said that would be one of the most powerful churches amen that ever existed so what is going to produce amen a powerful Church is when the soul amen the thinking and the attitude amen comes into the image that God has designed for it to be in amen that will be one of the most powerful churches amen that ever existed now uh just to read a couple translations there of St Luke 24 verse 49 if that's okay in the Amplified Bible it says listen carefully I am sending the promise of my father the Holy Spirit upon you but you are to remain in the city amen of Jerusalem until you are clothed fully anden and equipped with power from on high in the emphatic diaglot Luke 2449 says and behold I send forth the promise of my father upon you amen but remain you in the city amen till you are invested with power from on high amen so whatever God was sending amen from on high was going to equip the church it was going to dress the church and it was also going to invest are going to empower the church now when you look there at that word power actually the Greek word there is dunamus which is where we get the word Dynamite from and it means an inherit power it means a power residing In A Thing by virtue of its nature or which a person or thing exerts and puts forth it is power for performing Miracles it is moral power and Excellence of Soul it is the power and influence which belong to riches and wealth it is power and resources arising from numbers amen it is power consisting in amen or resting upon armies forces and host now I'll just say this Joel prophesied that in the last days there would be a great Army in the church right I believe tonight that that great Army is not coming neither do I believe it has been here amen but I believe I am looking at the great Army that Joel prophesied amen that would be a part of the Restoration in the hour that we're living in that's why Jesus would say behold I amen send the promise of my father upon you how many knows that if God sends a man he goes in the man if God sends you amen he goes in you look at this word send it means to order one Amen to go to a place appointed that he may be in a state of liberty now you know that Luke 24 was a prophecy amen that God would send the Holy Ghost in Acts 1: eight it says but you shall amen receive power after that the Holy Ghost amen is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in all Judea and in Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth now I'll just say this amen if we know what the Holy Ghost is amen then we know what the Holy Ghost is not and I'll say this the Holy Ghost according to a prophet amen is the spirit of Jesus Christ in you am then the Holy Ghost is the power of God he said see the Holy Ghost is the power of God that has sent you into the heart as a witness of the spirit you have been born again your life is cleaned up the world is dead and all the stink of it is like the garic and Egypt seeed you're far away from it you're a new creature amen in Christ Jesus how many's a new creature amen in Christ Jesus old things has passed away and you become new all together you are a new creation you are born amen of the spirit of God see your whole members of your body is submissive to his spirit and you are moving in the Holy Ghost you are not listening to the sound of the world Amen your eyes are on Heavenly things listen folks the Holy Ghost did not come amen from the church amen it did not come from the bishop it did not come from the pope of the Roman church amen but the Holy Ghost descend Ed amen from God out of Heaven Amen to do one thing that is to turn your eyes from the things below and to cause you to look into the heels amen from when cometh your salvation the Holy Ghost is not power from the bishop amen the Holy Ghost is not power from the Pope the Holy Ghost is power from on high amen I'll say this the Holy Ghost is not a handshake amen the Holy Ghost is not a membership L amen it's the gift of God Amen with power from on high Amen to demonstrate to the people that God is not in a tomb in Jerusalem neither is he in a grave in Jeffersonville but he is right here in this building tonight amen veiled in human flesh by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll say what a prophet said he said the holy spirit is an experience amen of being filled and indued with power for service now come on folks amen the Holy Ghost just not just here making us shout it's not just here making us dance not just here making us speak in tongues but the Holy Ghost is here amen that God might have a vessel amen that he could do a service through amen if we have a true experience it is by true power brother said listen the true word comes to the true prophet and he tells you the true word amen and you follow that true word and you get a true experience of the word see because the word is made flesh in you and you become God's son and the word of God is revolving right out of God Amen into you see because you are his nature amen his spirit is in you and you will do the works of God Amen the Bible said so amen so God then is under obligation Amen to give every believer the Holy Ghost amen he said it like this he said see he's more willing to give it to you amen then you are to receive it see amen for God is under obligation Amen to keep his word how many knows that the Bible said amen to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and repent of your sins now watch and you shall amen receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen it's very amazing to me amen that a repentance amen actually proceeds a receiving amen you didn't receive it and then repent amen but when you repented you receive the Holy Ghost brother B said a man cannot lay in the presence of God and a church cannot stay in the presence of God Amen under repentance unless the Holy Spirit comes down amen and gives unction and power Amen to start a move of God in there amen among those people listen folks when you begin to repent amen God begins to refresh amen when we begin to say Lord I've been wrong I'm sorry but I'm asking for your mercy mercy and your grace Amen to wash me and to cleanse me amen and to separate me as a Sanctified vessel amen I'm not here just to be a church member I'm not here just to see amen how much I can learn amen but I am here to do the Greater Works amen I am here Amen to manifest The Works of my father in which I have come from amen I know I'll say this the devil hates the preaching of the Gospel of repentance you know why Satan hates repentance preach is because when you begin to repent amen God begins to fill amen you with the power Amen to tear the devil's Kingdom down amen do you realize there were two preachers in the Bible Tommy they were gotten after for preaching something it was the Apostle Paul and it was John the Baptist you know they were actually seeking to kill those men you know why because the devil knew amen if the people got a hold of what they were preaching about amen they were going to going to tear his kingdom down listen folks amen the devil wants to stop amen a true repentance because the prophet said when you thoroughly repent and you believe on the Lord and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen you make God a liar if you don't receive the Holy Ghost how many knows the Bible said that God is not a liar amen and neither is he the son of man amen that he should repent I want to propose to you tonight amen that if you get the Holy Ghost it'll be the greatest gift you ever receive if you ever get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul it'll do more for you than alcohol it'll do more for you than drugs it'll do more for you than a cigarette amen when you receive the person of Jesus Christ in the depths of your soul you're not just sealed from one good meeting to another you are sealed until the day of your Redemption listen when the Seal of God comes upon the soul of a believer amen God is sealed in and the devil is sealed out well glory to God hallelujah I think it's time to reach the Holy Ghost again I think it's time to preach the power of the Holy Ghost in our churches I think it's time to preach it to our young people you got to have the Holy Ghost and when you get the Holy Ghost The Works of the devil will be destroyed by the manifestation of God in your flesh yes sir amen we want Power amen I'll just say this amen the Bible shows us amen that power belongs to God how many knows that amen the Bible says power belongs to God in Psalm 62:11 David says amen God has spoken once twice have I heard this amen that power belongeth unto God in 1 Chronicles 2912 he says both riches and honor come of thee and thou reignest Over All and then thine hand is power and might and then thy hand is to make great and to give strength unto all 2 Chronicles 258 but if thou will go amen do it be strong for the battle amen for God shall make thee fall before the enemy for God ha power to help and to cast down in job 26:12 he says he now I want you to listen to this the Bible says he divideth the sea amen with his power and by his understanding amen he smiteth through the proud amen watch this the power of God Amen actually has the ability Amen to divide the seed in Psalm 656 look what David says he says which by his strength he Seth fast the mountains amen being girded with power look at this word girded it means to equip amen or to clothe amen so David actually says that God will do the same thing to the the mountains amen that Jesus said would happen to a believer that receives the Holy Ghost listen folks amen the mountains are not held by an 18 penny nail amen the mountains are not held by a piece of rebar amen the mountains are held by the strength and the power of almighty God that's why the devil hates you you're not hailed by a handshake you're not hail by a preacher's personality but the same hands that is holding the mountains the same hands that has divided the sea is the same hands that has clothed you and equipped you and set you firmly in the position that you're standing in tonight oh I want to say it to the devil amen who's got more power I'll say it very plainly God does and there ain't nobody got more power than my God so what kind of power then listen to The Prophet asked the question who's got any more power than God so what kind of a power have you got got over you to take care of you sister Don all these months in this battle but what kind of power have you got over you to take care of you listen what a prophet said the whole powers that created the universe well that ought to make you put your shouting shoes on in the house of God Amen the same powers that created the universe is the same Powers that's taking care of every one of you Believers in church age book pick up your pen and write he says this the members of the Virgin bride will love him and they will have his potential see for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies amen are subject to our heads amen don't you ever forget this church that you're not subject to a preacher you're not subject to a pope somewhere you're not subject now I'm not I'm not saying you're not subject to a pastor I'm saying you're not subject to a man's idea you are subject to God and brother B said I amen I want to clarify that Amen brother B said I believe in Holy Ghost filled leadership amen but I believe it comes through the word amen by God called men in reality you're not submitting yourself to brother berer you're submitting yourself to the word that he has been entrusted to bring to you as a separate among the flock let me say this God's power is not to be made a show in it's actually to be displayed when you see the Seas you're looking at a display of the power of God when you see the mountains in their positions you are looking at a display of the power of God brother B said like this he said God's power amen is displayed in his characteristic now let me ask you something what is the characteristic of God well a prophet identified it he said it's Hebrews 138 right that Jesus Christ is the same amen yesterday today and forever he said it like this he said it's Malachi 3:6 for I am the Lord and I change not come on folks amen the characteristic of God is not our human ability it's not our education it's the fact that God is the unchanging God in the middle of a changing World in Hebrews chapter 1 and verse one I love what Paul says he said God man I'm feeling good it's a good atmosphere here tonight he said God who it's sunr times and diverse manners what did he do he spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets but hath in these last days spoken unto us amen by his son whom he has appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who be the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person now watch this and upholding all things amen by the word of his power it amazing brother brother David that it isn't the power of His word but he says upholding All Things by the word of his power when he has by himself purged our sins he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high Ram comes along in Hebrew series and says it like this he says the brightness of whose Glory God's glory the expressed image of whose presence God's he said see or expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word word he said there you are the word that upholds all things amen Matthew 24 heavens and earth will pass away but my word amen shall never pass away he said he upholds all things Satan tries to down it and say it's an old book it's been translated even the Roman Catholic bishop uh of the church Bishop Sheen said that it's been translated four or five different times and there's not much to it you couldn't live by it if you had to but he upholds all things by his word amen that's what I think about it he says I believe the Bible amen the word of his power he said there's power in the words oh Church of the Living God you say why do we need to get the word in us because we are not an emotional bride we are not a gifted musically bride we are a word born bride which means if the word is in the bride she cannot fail because the word cannot fail oh hallelujah what a revelation that ought to bring to your heart tonight amen Heavens will pass away and the Earth will pass away but if you got the holy ghost in your soul the devil can throw everything he's got at you but you'll get back up because the same power that divided the sea that fastened the mountains is in your soul and the devil can't move you the devil can't shake you hell can't scare you sickness can't defeat you disease can't have you because the word of his power is upholding you in the face of every obstacle that the devil frows in front of you my goodness we're not supported by our own human abilities our support is a Divine support our support is Christ and we are equipped I just want to say this we are not partially equipped for this battle we are fully equipped this said brother Andrew I'm not good enough can I just say it to you very plain God don't call the equipped but he equips the called in other words God don't call you and say you got this ability and this ability and this ability no he calls you and he gives you the ability to do what he's calling you to do he said see the god that wrote the word now I want you to catch this the god that wrote the word in this hour amen invested the word into a Prophet which is a Divine revealer of that word now come on folks they stayed with him in the first pool they shouted in the second pull but when he come to that third pull which was the opening of the word they could go no further you know why because now he's separating this bride amen from a church into a wife of Jesus Christ he's going to literally reveal the things that have been hid since before the foundation of the world and they're going to come into your soul by the preaching of the message of the hour listen folks he was invested with the word with power from on high I I just want to read this to you it's a it's it astounds me in the breach 1963 he says now tomorrow night by the grace of God we're going to try amen to break that first seal if God will break it for us now watch this and let us see what this Revelation has been it's been healed from the foundation of the world now watch this he's going to reveal amen the symbol and there's no longer going to be a question upon the symbol remember uh how many how many Bible readers have we got here tonight you like to read your Bible okay go read the book of Revelation sometime and you won't get out of the first chapter without finding about 10 or 15 symbols because the Book of Revelation is a book of symbols but remember in the first seal he said now watch he said there's a symbol he said but there's got to come a reality to that symbol he said like when in heaven when that first sh open there was Thunder he said now watch he said now we'll turn to John 12 and we won't have to wonder no more so when a prophet begin to preach he was not refreshing your memory on what the symbol is he was showing you what the revelation of that symbol is listen folks if it's still in symbol form we are a powerless church we don't know what to believe we don't know if the White Horse is the Christ or if he is the Antichrist but if a revelation comes to that symbol then we know that it's not Christ it's the Antichrist it's the devil trying to conquer the Church of the Living God I say thank God for this message I say thank God for a prophet who was not just giving us a religious education folks he was giving us the revelation of Jesus Christ to fight back against every devil that comes against us now listen to this he said before we do that Center friend or lukor church member do you just have a membership in a church or do you not have a membership and if you only have a membership he said you'd be pretty pretty near as well off without it you need a birth you must come to the blood you must come to something that just spots the sin away amen till there's no more remembrance of it he said if you haven't made preparation yet to meet the lamb in the air I want you to listen to this quote he says and by the power invested me by my commission given by almighty God ministered to me by an Angel a pillar of light I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ don't you try to meet him with only a membership of a lodge of a church of this Earth you come while the mediator as far as I know is still on the throne and he's making intercession because there will come come a day when you want to come and there'll be no mediator for if we see the hour we're living in in the seventh Church Age The Mysteries of God become what they have with this Vindicated spirit of God showing everything he promised in the last days how much time is left now come on Church here's a prophet moving into the third pool of his ministry and he's still doing the same thing and the breach that he was doing in sech as this sign of the end remember in his this sign of the end sir I hope this okay amen when he's preaching that if you go read that sermon he ask all kinds of questions he'll say is this that third pull is this those seven Thunders he'll say is this amen my commission he'll say is this the headstone I love one thing he says brother Tommy it's got me in trouble all over the world probably but he says this he said is this what will bring a power back into the church listen folks a prophet is telling you they're screaming for power and they're slamming the door and the place of what's going to bring the power in there their music wasn't going to do it their gifts wasn't going to do it it was going to take the word to Usher the power of God Amen back into the church I say thank God the word has been open I say thank God the Bible has become a new book and we can see for ourselves who we are in the economy of our Lord Jesus Christ this is more than a sermon this is a marriage now now amen you watching a wedding amen you look in a wedding amen when a minister stands there amen what do they say they say brother Brad by the power vested me by the state of Kentucky amen I Now Pronounce You amen man and wife what they're doing amen is they're now bringing two into Union they're now making Twain one watch what they say Amen the legal Authority has been given me to marry these people by the power invested in that min he has the legal authority to marry two and by that Union they would become one can I just tell you what a prophet said he said there is a marriage of the lamb and there's a marriage supper of the Lamb listen folks the marriage of the Lamb has taken place upon the Earth we're going to the marriage supper of the Lamb let me say this you're not a girlfriend no more you're not a fiance no more you are now mes Jesus Christ there has been a prophet on the Earth who has married you to the word by the power invested in him let me say this all of Heaven is upon this bride the angels are behind this bride the checkbook of God is in your hand whatever you have need of the legal Authority is upon you Amen to ask what you will and you shall receive it Hallelujah If I Was the Devil I would fight this church too because we're not just carrying a church ladder we are carrying the Mind Of God my goodness amen you are his wife right and there are no secrets with hidden from his wife I'll just say this amen there's only two powers in this universe regardless of all the differences there's only two Powers there's only two kingdoms amen there's God's power and there's Satan's power remember says every war every disorder everything that comes along is either controlled by God's power or Satan's power he said because that's only two Powers there is that is the power of life and it's the power of death now watch he said and Satan his power he's got is the perverted power of God somebody say perverted power the Satan's power is a perverted power I love the prophet's words brother berer he says it isn't no real power the power the devil had it isn't no real power it's a perversion of God's power everything Satan does is only a perverted life he said see a lie is only the truth mold adultery is a righteous act misuse see everything Satan is God is something that was perverted but it's a power he said and today we are sitting here and one or the other powers is going to control us amen one or the other powers is going to control us you're either going to be controlled by the power of God or you're going to be controlled by the power of the devil now I'll say this to you the power of the devil is in the Earth today how many degrees the power of the devil is in every war it's in every disorder it's in politics it's in education it's I hate to say it folks it's even in religion the power of the devil has invaded the entire universe amen but at the same time amen Joel said I will restore unto you all the years that the Locust eat away and the canker eat away and the palor and the caterpillar my great Army my great Army which I send among you look at this God promised in this hour of hybridization he promised to restore the original Power Hallelujah you're not going to learn this you're not going to buy this you're you're not going to work this up God is going to have to restore it and the way he restores the real power is by restoring his word because he upholds all things by the word of his power brother said like this God said I will restore sayith the Lord all the years are y'all ready for this he says I'll send back another church in the last days I will restore that original Power again in the evening time it shall be light well it's a good night to be an evening light Tabernacle amen it's a good night to be gathered here folks amen we're not gathered here under the power of the devil we're not gathered here under the power of Satan we are gathered here under the real original restored power of God somebody Shout original Power is real power original Power is real power he said there's been much mockery in every phase of religion amen but there is a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the human being from the bondage of sin there is a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the sufferer from his suffering listen folks I'm brother I'm just going to say what he said he says it perfect brother Tommy I'm so sick and tired of human philosophy I want to see the real power of God Amen demonstrate and move among his people where that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever proving himself and that's what the world is hungering for church the world is not hungering for more religious programs they're not hungering for more education or more theology or more philosophy they're starving to death to see the characteristic of God on display in people who claim to call themselves Christians now I know it may get a little tight here but let's just preach a second because people actually think fanaticism is the power of God I'll just say this fanaticism makes the real power of God shine that much more brighter you know what the real power of the resurrected Christ is it is the real Pentecostal blessing you know what the Pentecostal blessing is don't you it's the confirmation of the Resurrection if you have the Pentecostal blessing you are are confirming to whoever you come in contact with that the God I serve is a living God he's not a god of my imagination he's not a god of wood he's not a god of stone he's a living God he's a breathing God he's a moving God he's a healing God oh sister Donna amen I say God bless you amen every person you've come in contact with is a witness to them that your God is not a god of religion he's not a god of History but he's an everpresent help in the time of trouble come on folks amen she may be bad on cancer but the word of this power upholds all things and she is proving to whoever she comes in contact with my God is alive Hallelujah and he's well and he's able to do exceedingly and abundantly above all I can ask her than I'm just going to say it very plainly Church the world has the wrong understanding of what power is the prophet of God said how could Satan say that man could be God I want you to hear this he's speaking of Jesus a man that could take the challenge of a priest are you with me he could take the challenge of a priest brother Danny he could let a drunken Soldier spit in his face I'm talking about your husband will you be my bodyguard you didn't answer that oh praise God I'm safe now makes you nervous when The Bodyguard just Chuckles kid he let a drunken Soldier spit in his face Brother Brad he let a priest challenge him you know what he says he said today we got the wrong conception of power see to the world power would have been amen spitting back or letting him have a piece of his mind power would have been amen standing right there now come on folks we're talking about the we're talking about the word made flesh we're talking about Jesus who spoke to the storms he raised the dead he healed the crippled he conquered blinded eyes come on he opened blinded eyes he done all these Miracles Brother Brad and yet he stands there and lets a priest challenge him and he don't stand there and preach him a six- hour sermon on what all he's done and how many sermons he's preached and but he stands there and he displays the power that was going to come from on high into his church another church in the last days he said today we got the wrong conception of power now can I just say what he said he said power is overcoming can I read the rest of this it's returning good for evil he says that's the real power he said see that can love your enemy oh God and can do good to those that do evil to you that's real power see he said that's God's power yes Maniacs can break chains but it takes a real man to return good for evil now watch this from his heart not because a religious duty but from his heart now folks it's not a strange thing that Malachi 4 says our hearts will be turned back unto the faith of the apostolic fathers listen folks we're not serving God from our heads we're serving God from our hearts which is the Abiding Place of the original restored real power now I just want to I just want to I want to read something to you if that's okay in Luke 2334 is everybody okay here's our lord Jesus hanging up on the cross he's our head he's our Lord he's our husband he's our everything right he's raised the dead he's open binded eyes he's calmed the storm he's walked on water he's broke bread and he's turned water into wine and he's brother John he's fed 5,000 with two fish and Five Loaves and I mean he's done some mighty things Brother Brad and here he is and he's hanging on the cross and there's the priest that challenged him there's the drunken soldier that spit in his face and I want you to hear what he says he says father forgive them hello did did I read that right father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his reignment and they cast lots I want you to watch something here is our lord Jesus hanging upon the cross he is the real power of God the Bible says there was was a spear right that was run in his side and out of his side come water and blood and spirit his Spirit was released come on Church why was the spirit released that it might come back upon those who had been saved and Redeemed by his blood and out of him comes these words father it always gets tight when you start preaching on this but it's still the truth folks father mother forgive them for they know not what they do now let me say this he is the head right then if he is the head the body is to display the same power that the head displayed look here in the prophet message Dr Moses he said there was a man spoke from a Pulpit a mighty scientist not long ago and he was questioning me back in the room about that light that Pillar of Fire that appeared and he said Reverend Brandon they put a meter on a dying Saint when it was Dy and slipped off in a room now here's a dying Saint amen they put a meter on her and they slip off into a room and she knew nothing about it and when her death struck her she wasn't afraid for she lifted up her eyes and asked God to forgive every enemy she had am I reading this right ask God to forgive every enemy she had and she thanked him for the life that she had lived and when that meter was put on Z hero there was enough power that raised from that woman it was a supernatural something that went from her that caught onto that meter and made out the same thing as a lie detector he said see now watch you wasn't made to tell lies and enough power come from that woman listen to send a radio message around the world five times I believe it was of power coming off of that dying woman go on beyond the moon the stars to the Throne of God with a prayer to a sinner's poor heart in the hours of her death oh God I wish I was a preacher right now our lord Jesus hangs on the cross brother Bor and his final words amen is Father forgive them for they know not what they do listen folks we're here to do more than just believe like Jesus and pray like Jesus and Shout like Jesus and heal like Jesus we're here to love and forgive the same way Jesus did that's what the world is hungering for they're not hungering for philosophy they're not hungering for theology they're saying where is the love of God that is in the bible let me say this to you tonight if you got the Holy Ghost I'll say this you quit letting that devil tell you you can't let that Grudge go you quit letting that devil tell you you can't let that ill feeling I'm after that devil you can sit there and watch me you quit let that devil tell you that you can't forgive and you can't let that ill thing go yes you can if you got the Holy Ghost in you you can do the same thing that Jesus did when he said father father forgive them he didn't say father they hurt me come on folks he didn't say father they spit my face he didn't say father that old that old priest down there challenged me but from his heart he said father forgive them can I let y'all in a little secret here tonight forgiveness is not for the other person forgiveness is for you w Brother come on church is okay brother berer forgiveness is not for the other person forgiveness is for you can I say it to you you got to let it go folks somewhere sometime you just got to let it go somewhere you got to let they hurt me they said she did he you got to let all that go if you want to be a powerful Church a powerful church is a church that is able to forgive now I've been preaching since I was 13 years old I preached I know how many churches am me one of the first churches I ever preached in was right here right here was a side note free of charge I was preaching at brother W's the other day brother martin say having a banquet and brother Josh Martin I think he's been here Josh told me he said he said man preaching Banquets would make me nervous I said well I said Josh I got spooled on my first banquet he said what do you mean I said well I preached it brother bers and I said we had the we had the banquet in the fellowship hall and then we just come on up to the sanctuary and had Church you know people get a little nervous in banquet settings I said listen I just got spooked what I'm I'm saying is I've been in some Churches and I've seen churches that could outshout could out dance could out could out speak in tongues amen but they couldn't forgive and they couldn't let things go listen folks the strength of your church is the ability to let things go and still remain a church you say who you after I'm after the devil because you're here to do a service unto God come on folks the devil did not want them preaching repentance because they did not want the other people to get a hold of what they had brother B said Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and the devil never got out of his bed he said but when they got the Holy Ghost he said the devil rode over and said I can't stop this it's on the phenomenal side now brother brother Brad now there's not just one or two men with a holy ghost now there's a whole body with the Holy Ghost now there's many Witnesses all over the place doing a service unto [Applause] Jesus you say why in the world Amen do I need to get the Holy Ghost because brother berer can't go to your job he can't go to your school he can't go to your place of home he can't go to your family reunions but he can preach a gospel in the Pulpit that will move into your soul and you will do God a service I'm not trying to be fanatical here amen but you got a pastor that's Faithfully labored in this pull pit for years preaching this message preaching the Holy Ghost I tell you this amen Every Soul that you reach is going to be traced back to that man's Ministry because something he preached ignited something in your soul and you went witness to somebody listen folks and it set them on fire because God wants a powerful church so This Woman's in there and she's dying by the Brad it's her final minutes they hook this this meter up to her and death strikes her and she screams out father forgive every enemy I've got real power right brother John went in real power Bend she got up took the heart monitors off and walked out of the hospital and said ha God raised me from the dead well that would have been a display of the original Power of God but a prophet said the real power is overcoming and returning good for evil now I just I'm sorry I'm the guy I'm the guy that studies his quotes probably too much but I I love this message the perverted power was there as well because the proph of God said then that same scientist he slipped into a man's room that was an Infidel and he was dying with a veneral disease and they sent a young lady in there to get him all emotionally worked up and then when he got angry with her he began to curse and take God's name in vain now watch this and that meter turned back as far the other way as the Christians did this way now I want y'all to catch something here it's a powerful point when our lord Jesus was hanging on the cross dying amen there were two thieves beside him right amen it's like brother uh brother Shrewsberry used to have a joke he'd say he said this doctor or this this man he went in to pray for he said uh hey he said I want you to bring my banker and my lawyer in here he said okay he said I want you to bring my banker law in here he said I'm dying I want you to bring my banker and law and brother brother Roy always tell that story he'd say they finally asked him said sir why do you want your banker and your lawy you're in here while you're dying on each side of you he said well I want to die like Jesus between two thieves now listen the man is laying there dying our lord Jesus is hanging on the cross dying brother Brad He's between two thieves listen he's hanging there brother BR said and the one on his I believe it was on his right the one on his right was pardoned he said he had never thought of Jesus a day in his life he said the one on his left amen didn't even acknowledge who it was hanging beside him I I I pray I'm making sense out of this here's our lord Jesus hanging there do you realize in our Lord Jesus's death out of his death came a convert out of his death came a convert out of him hanging there dying saying father forgive them there was a man hanging on his right that received his pardon and he said today you will be with me in Paradise do you realize that this woman laying there dying there was an Infidel across the hallway there was a Christian on this side and that woman laying there dying the scientist here's brother B's words he said the scientist walked out of there and was converted by that woman's death and said if God respects people who use his name in The Glorious way and believe him that much he said I now believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and I accept him as my savior what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying don't you ever give up don't you ever quit serving God down to your last breath let it be a powerful Church Hallelujah there to our final moments of breathing let our breath be used as a witness unto God that he's able to heal he's able to save he's able to deliver what are you saying I'm saying this amen I'm turning the corner here I'm saying this the power of Satan is limited can I can can you say something with me Satan can only do so much he's limited's lied but the power of God is unlimited W Brother come on folks that Grudge is limited that bitterness is limited that unforgiving spirit is limited that that old hateful attitude is limited but there is a God in heaven who has come into the church by the power of the Holy Ghost and he's an unlimited God way back before the foundation of the world when Satan perverted to evil God being infinite he looked in the stream of time and he saw the end which is for knowledge if he don't know all things you have a limited God you've made him finite like you and I he says but God is unlimited God's power God's knowledge everything he is the omnipotent can I can I close by giving the devil a black eye look at this word limited brother berer it is restricted in size a mount or extent it is few it is small or short of a person it is not great in ability or talents look here at unlimited though unlimited means it's not limited or restricted in terms of number quantity or extent oh God Brother David having an infinite number of solutions did I did I read that right how having an infinite number of solutions when something is unlimited means you can never defeat it when something is unlimited it means there's no corner you can back it in that it won't come out of Glory to God when something is unlimited it don't mean how many restrictions you put on it you will never bind it because it has an unlimited ability with itself listen what a prophet says now I'm bringing this down to the church okay if you can limit God then you can limit Christ are you ready for this and if you limit the church today in its possibilities you are limiting God if you limit God you limit Christ if you limit the church you're limiting God you ever thought about that when you say we can't do this when you say we're not able to overcome this when brother when your pastor preaches the word of God and just lays that word out there and it sometimes shcks the height off of you and sometimes it shouts you and sometimes it runs you and you know what I'm talking about and sometimes it just gets right down there and he's saying you can do this and you can overcome that and you can be this and you can and you say you know we just can't do that let me say this to you there's nothing more discouraging to a preacher who sits in an office all day long studying and talking and fellowshipping with an unlimited God reading from a message that has revealed unlimited power which has specifically told us we have unlimited Revival and on Wednesday night or Sunday morning the door bust open and here comes brother berer and he's all fired up he's ready to preach man he's hot on he's got this thought and this scripture and this quote and he's just preaching away and you're just sitting there saying well that's a good point well that's pretty good well that was for somebody else and well I can't do that and he's just shouting and having a good time and you're saying H what's wrong with him don't he know it thank God he don't come out of here as L as sometimes we do but what's happened is he's broke into a realm of unlimited he don't know how to stop glory to God he don't know how to back up to Giants come on folks we don't study about Goliath we study about David we don't study about the Philistines we study about shamgar and Samson we don't study about the walls of Jericho we study about Israel we don't study about the fiery fness we study about the three Hebrew boys we don't study about the lons we study about Daniel and every one of those members of the Church of the Living God display the characteristic of God he is unlimited the lies can't stop him the fire can't burn him the Philistines can't conquer him the walls of Jericho can't hold him Hallelujah he's an unlimited God he's an unlimited God he sent an unlimited message to reveal an unlimited power listen that has produced an unlimited Revival we got to go beyond our own sound barrier we got to go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of God then it's unlimited what God can do with that man can I say this to you it's time to catch a vision of the unlimited power there's only two types of churches in this University today brother said then Jesus in his church today now now here's here's where I want to bring it to Jesus in his church today would be just as powerless as your faith is and he'll be just as powerful as your faith is so there will either be a powerless church or there will be a powerful church can I say this to you you are a powerful Church of the Living God said like this you're always pointing how World the how Wicked the world's getting but you fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time she's rising up she's standing on the field oh she's a little flock but brother God's with her and listen and she's going to Triumph just as certain as Christ rose from the dead so she's not just going to display his power in the characteristic of returning good for evil but she's going to display his power as well in triumphing over everything the church now now I'm just going to can I just say say over you what a prophet said is that okay the church is going to Triumph through the blood of Jesus Christ to the victory march and we're always complaining about what the world how Wicked the world is but you forget to realize how much more powerful the church is than used to be what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying the spirit of Prophecy spoke through Paul and said perilous times will come they'll deny the power of God but look here in Revelation 3:20 he says but behold I stand at the door and I knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me you know what brother B says that word Su means he says reveal I will come into him and reveal myself to him he said his word testifies in the last days there will be a come of Falling Away there will be a cold formal powerless Church age he says that's what we're living in I love this it'll be a powerless Church age but not a powerless bride age there will be a powerful bride Church of the Living God how many can say tonight Lord baptize me with the original Power the real power Lord I want to display your characteristic in every aspect of my life let my life be a direct reflection of God and his power and his word you said brother Ander you don't realize tonight our backs up against the wall we're surrounded by the Red Sea we're we're entrapped in the walls of Jericho brother Andrew you don't realize tonight we we the the the Philistines are Marching to our house to steal everything we got can I tell you something tonight remember the unlimited God is in your midst the unlimited god with an infinite number of solutions to whatever your problem is how how many believes how many believes tonight that God is unlimited how many believes that right here tonight you can let a bitterness go you can let an unforgiveness go how many believes tonight you can let something that you've held and harbored and it's eat at you and eat at you and eat at you for years right here in this atmosphere you've been convinced there's no way I can ever forgive that person I can ever let it go I can ever overcome this I can ever love again I can ever listen folks I've seen people that's been hurt by preachers and they don't they don't bit more trust preachers in the man the moon can I tell you something God has a bomb in Gilead for that I've seen people that's been hurt I've seen I've prayed for young people in in prayer lines that their parents's marriage fell apart and they're not ever going to get married because this marriage fell apart and they it just becomes a canker but listen folks we serve a god right here in this building tonight and we're a powerful church and if we can just start letting things go and let the word of his power uphold Our Lives the Miracles the signs and wonders Mighty manifestations will be done let our musicians come tonight you say brother Andrew I just don't think it's possible can I tell you tonight it is possible can I tell you tonight With God all things are possible can I tell you tonight that you may have exhausted every resource that you can come up with you may have done everything you can do and and and and thought of everything you can do put everything put every plan every design everything together this is how I'm going to fix it and brother anderw it's still not fixed can I tell you tonight there's an unlimited God in this building and though you're exhausted on solutions to fix it he's not brother Tommy he's not exhausted on Solutions he's got a solution out here tonight you said brother anderw why do you preach like this because if I didn't believe it I shouldn't preach it but I happen to believe these things folks I've seen it with my own eyes I've seen God come riding churches and fix I was I was out in Missouri one time preaching and there was a a lady coming up for prayer and elderly sister she come up and she said brother Andrew said I want you to pray for me said years ago something happened she said I've never been able to forgive never been able to let it go she said I just want you to pray for me I laid my hand over on her and I just started praying and as I was praying I speaking that morning on Liberty I never will forget it and while I was praying for her I said Lord let the liberty of the Holy Ghost let it let it just come on this lady right now let her let everything go and let her just let her just fall in love with you she's an 80 some year old woman let her I said let her just fall in love with you all over again Lord yeah you ever you ever be praying something and you wonder Brother Brad did you praying for somebody you're
