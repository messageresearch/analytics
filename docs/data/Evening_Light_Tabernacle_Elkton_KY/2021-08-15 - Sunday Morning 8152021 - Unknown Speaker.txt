TRANSCRIPT
========================================
morning brothers and sisters if you go ahead and stand with me we'll turn to i believe at the 48th first last week there are other some school classes at this time can be dismissed hope you've all had a good week working out among the congregation before we get started reading at the 49th first i'll go ahead and open up with prayer you know god knows every one of you this morning what your needs are where you've been where you haven't been what your desires are you know you know in in context of life you know you serve a god that cares about everything he watches over us does everything for us so whatever you need is this morning what you've come here for whatever your desire is i know everyone's pure desire is to know the lord in a better way and in a purer way but just open your hearts and faith and believe he can do something for you today lord we just move upon you lord god desire to see your lord touch the hearts of your people this morning lord that you'll take full control over the service lord you know the needs in the hearts of your people you know their desires lord now just move upon the service lord may we yield yourselves lord to be taught from you lord to open our hearts to you this morning lord be with everybody today i pray lord whatever their situations are lord just touch their lives and touch their hearts we ask and believe this thing lord in your precious name amen and we'll read these like uh brother troy's been doing it i'll start at the 49th first and he goes to say here remember the word unto thy servant upon which thou has caused me to hope the proud have made me greatly in diversion yet i have i not declined from thy law has taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law i have remembered thy name o lord in the night and have kept thy law thou art my portion o lord i have said that i would keep thy words i thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies the bands of the wicked have robbed me but i have not forgotten thy law thee and of them that keep thy precepts the earth o lord is full of thy mercy teach me thy statutes you can be seated i was just going to reread this one verse a lot of preachers talk about this i know that you know thing about salvation is basically to get started all you've got to realize is you're going the wrong direction and turn around and go the opposite direction and anything in life if you keep running against the wall and it's not working obviously you need to turn around do something different but it says here so i thought on my ways so it lets you know that you have to think on your way sometimes sometimes you can get in a rut or you just put your head down and you just keep going and going and before you know it you're not going nowhere but he says i thought on my ways and turned my feet on to thy testimony so you got to think on your ways and then you got to turn your feet or your life on his testimonies and not what you thought about life or what you think is right but what god's word says is right and you just got to turn in the right direction if you return with me to uh romans the 10th chapter and uh first corinthians the first chapter i was thinking this morning i was just wanting to read this before i get started you know there's a lot to be you know simply to get started on the path we're all on this morning you know first thing that god has to do for you is put that desire in your heart that you want something other than what this life has to order for you you know you have a desire to serve the lord that little kindle of light or that little light that's in your heart that you want to do better and god is trying to speak to you but i was going to read this out of pilgrim's progress this statement here this is this is after vanity fair and this is one hopeful george christian and hopefully explaining the christian what brought about his salvation but i'll just read this statement here and there's a lot of you know i was thinking of these people in the you know in the 16th century this is 400 years ago around this time you know in the about 1620 to 1640 you know that's 400 years ago but like uh brother branham said the truth of god they never changed they're they're constant the formula for us the is the same in any generation if you want to get closer to god and brother branham said pray every day and read your bible and always believe christ so simple principles they don't change their i mean the world might try to educate you out of them but there's pretty simple you know i listen to a lot of ministers you know when i'm driving my truck i'll put on a different christian and they really if you say you always believe what god says no matter what you tell me i'm gonna believe god they'll laugh at you they say well you explain it well that's the first time that's where you really start you don't have to explain anything god's word stands on its own you don't have to prove it to people you just have to present it to people but i'll just read what this statement is if if it's on the 162nd chapter if you have your own copy i don't know if the chapters then pages are gonna match this is in the old english here it goes on this is what hopeful says this is what he prayed god be merciful to me a sinner and make me to know and believe in jesus christ so the first thing i have to do or anyone has to do is accept the fact who you really are and know that in yourself there's nothing sufficient for you to make yourself clean on that day you so the first thing god be merciful to me a sinner and make me to know and believe in jesus christ for i see that if his righteousness had not been or i have not faith in that righteousness i am utterly cast away and it goes back to what brother branham taught to us it's not your own righteousness it's not anything you do or anything that you can do it's everything that god has done for you it's a finished work you just have to have enough faith god's got to give you enough faith everyone has a little bit of faith the apostle said god told jesus increase our faith so they could believe the word that he was telling it's the same for us and he goes on to say in the righteousness i'm utterly cast away lord i have heard that thou art a merciful god and as adorn ordain thy son jesus christ should be the savior of the world and moreover thou art willing to bestow upon such a poor sinner as i am and i am a sinner indeed we're all sinners you know there's nothing perfect about us nothing good about us we're all come from different situations but in the end we're all sinners whether you're rich or poor whether you're big or small it don't make a difference everyone on the face of the earth is the sinner and without god and the grace of god gives them they're they're headed to destruction now you don't hear that too much anymore uh about destruction but that's where we're all headed if we don't accept this am i and i am a sinner indeed lord take there for this opportunity and magnify the grace in the salvation of my soul through thy son jesus christ amen and i was going to go back here to this um 10th chapter here of romans i believe you all know this uh pretty well but i'll start here paul's talking here to the gentiles and i'll start at about uh about the sixth earth but the righteousness which is of faith speak it on this bus say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is bringing christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead but what saith the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth that in thy heart that is a word of faith which we preach and that's what goes forth every every service here the word of god and faith you've got to believe in faith the word of god it no one can make you believe in faith that's something god's got to give you that the word becomes preeminent in everything you do in your life and he goes on and he i don't want to reread this i do that a lot i apologize for that thou shalt if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thine heart that god has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved but with the heart man believeth on to righteousness and with the mouth confession is made onto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so paul's saying here whatever the world does to you out there there's no you there's nothing to be ashamed of for a christian no matter what they say to you what they do to you how they treat you you should never be ashamed of the fact of what god has done for you in your heart and life they might make fun of you they might walk away from you your family might disown you but you have a better hope a better desire it shouldn't it shouldn't offend it shouldn't offend you and it shouldn't change thee and he goes on say for the scripture saith whoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich on on to all that call upon him there's like i said there's no great men or no small one it comes to the grace of salvation it's all a gift that god gives to anyone and uh it goes whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved how then shall they call upon him which they have not believed how so they believe on him which they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher so it's kind of hard to get away from the fivefold ministry it goes on and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace bring glad tidings and good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for our elijah said said lord hath lord who hath believed our report that goes back to the 53rd 53rd chapter of isaiah there and so faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god but i say have they not heard yes verily their sound went out into all the earth their words onto the ends of the world for i say did not israel know first moses saith i will provoke you to jealousy by them that are not are no people but and by foolish nations will i anger you and we've already gone for that period already that last 2 000 years on the faith we're at the end now we're at the end of it all right now you know people say that a lot we're at the end of it all am i saying it's going to be tomorrow no am i saying it's going to be 10 days from now no i'm just saying as you see the world falling apart the way it is there's no hope in the world there's no hope in your country there's no hope in your state whatever there's no hope in that if you're counting on any of that you're going to be a miserable person but we're coming to a point where you can't keep going the way it's going excuse me but elias was very bold and saith i was found of them that sought me not and that's us here i was found of them that sought me not i was made manifest onto them that asked not after me but to israel he saith all day long if i stretch forth my hand onto a disobedient and gain saying people that's where we were you know god you know i only can speak for my own life you know when i was a young man you know i don't i'm not from this state you know i was totally happy you know until god got a hold of my heart one day i i was totally happy in my situation until i realized that my situation wasn't a good situation and god had to speak to my heart and life just like all you had to speak your heart and life one day but as i look at this world i i just shake my head sometimes sister gannett knows i'm the last couple days haven't been good days for me because you know you don't spend all those years on active duty and see what's going on with our country right now and you know it doesn't bring you any peace you see what what's being allowed to happen out there on the stage you know i was just thinking yesterday that it's like i'm living in the 1970s again what we see going on in the world and in our government you know it's just like uh 1970s are being relived all over again you know so we have no hope in this world the only hope we have is in jesus christ this morning brother david man you love him with all your heart this morning i mean let's stand and sing that course i love you lord and i

insane and people don't have any kind of they don't have any balance they don't have any foundation we stand here this morning upon a solid rock this morning we serve an awesome god this morning he's a healer he's a savior he's a deliverer and most of all when he cleans you up it's over with you might fall you might fail but when all god sees is that clear he doesn't see all this but the devil

steve [Applause] through many dangers this morning [Music] i have [Music] me [Music] when we've been there when we [Applause] years [Music] [Music] last days [Music] heavenly father lord we're just thankful lord to be in your house this morning we think about the song amazing grace and the last verse there when we say we've been there ten thousand years we'll have no less days lord to to praise you to lift you up to worship you for the good things you've done to us and for us lord the blessings you bestowed upon us father and lord we just asked once again this morning as we come and open your word and and share it with the people lord we just ask that you would move on the scene in a special way that you would show your power that you would show your might and your demonstration of what you can do in the lives of your people if they'll just serve you and submit and lord and yield to your father lord you're just so so good to us lord and we commit the service into your hands lord i i yield my my lips my thoughts my intentions all into your hands lord and lord i pray that the people can submit and yield their ears and their hearts lord that as the word goes forth that it would sink in deep lord because i feel like lord that we're in a a state in an hour where you're calling your people up higher lord jesus that you've raised the bar you've raised standard and the expectations that we have to have as christians are not what they once were 10 15 20 years ago but it's a higher calling now lord and i pray lord that the people can grasp what we have on our heart this morning lord as we come forth we love you lord we thank you for all you do and we appreciate you in christ's name amen amen if you would turn with me into the book of romans romans chapter 8 and we'll look at verse 13. romans chapter 8 and verse 13. it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning and thankful for the rain we got here and i trust if you live away you've got some rain it's sure been dry and hot and it was just not this morning to to go out for a little bit and and just feel some cool air for a change and we're thankful for that how many come expect them this morning good good that's uh that's what we want to talk about is expectations this morning you know there's so many things going on i pre preach it a lot we get called in the trap of it that things change but god don't change uh covet comes to destroy but but god's still a healer um you know struggles come our way but god's still a deliverer you know they try to just continually throw stuff at us you know and and they want you to conform to their way of thinking i say there i'm talking about the world in general but god don't change uh romans chapter 8 verse 13 for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear aren't you thankful for that but ye have received the spirit of adoption where we cry abba father abba father so this is this means an intimate relationship abba father intimate and a lot of times preachers preach it as i have a father means papa or daddy but there's another side to it that means obedience you're not only in an intimate relationship with abba father but you also have to be in obedience to abba father and the only two people to use this phrase in the bible is jesus and paul have a father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit did you catch that the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit so now we have two spirits that are aligning two spirits that are coming together the deep is now called into the deep the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ don't you like that joint heirs with christ they you didn't you don't go to the estate reading and find out that this one or this brother or that brother or this brother got got a thousand acres this one got a porsche this one got a lamborghini this one got an airplane and you got stuck with the silverware it don't work that way your joint heirs with christ so everything that christ has from god everything that he is also yours if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together may god add his blessings to the reading of the word this morning you can be seated matthew chapter 7 and 8 and luke 11 and 10 both read exactly the same and they say for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened so i'll ask you again this morning how many come expecting brother branham says we always get what we expect now i've got quite a bit of quotes i'm going to go through today and by god's grace we're going to preach them and not read them and and so uh pray for us in that area we always get what we expect when people expect anything well then they usually get what they look for it's the mental attitude that you have he said remember this and never forget it he said the right mental attitude towards any promise of god will bring it to pass the right mental attitude towards any promise it doesn't take the gifts of healing to heal sick people here we have the prophet of god who has the gift of healing in his life and he's saying it don't even take that you don't have to be what i am as the prophet of god a gift of healing you don't have to have that to heal the sick it's not amazing he said you don't have to have that any person in here that has he has the right to meet satan anywhere if you're a christian and beat him on any grounds that he could stand on and when jesus was here on the earth and in him dwelled the fullness of the godhead bodily all the great powers of god was in his son christ jesus for the scripture tells us uh that god was a christ reconciling the world to himself that all things was delivered unto him though he spoke nothing but what the father told him and no one was healed but what he first saw being healed verily i say unto you the son can do nothing without in himself but what he sees the father doing listen to this in another one many times brother brown preached expectation numerous times and there's different things he pulled out about expectations and and how we should be expectating what thank god will do and he says but now tonight i want as we gather here to start this prayer meeting praying for the sick believing god for the supernatural i trust that every person in here will take it up on themselves to be under prayer all the time in your homes be fasting and praying and come with great expectations for if you don't expect anything you won't receive anything you'll just receive as you expect so brothers and sisters we've been talking and and i i hope you've been uh if you haven't been here on wednesday nights i hope you've been following along with the ministry as it's been going forth the different ministers coming it's all time together and i hope you can see that that god is not content with us in a place that we're at but he's calling us to a higher place a higher level that would stand up on the word of god and apply the word of god into our lives and find ourselves participating and be the joint heirs with christ expectations a strong belief that something will happen or it'll be the case in the future expectations brothers and sisters are built upon our faith and expectation is something that god honors our faith in that's the expectation so i ask you one more time how many come expecting this morning brothers and sisters have we come to church with a purpose have we uh got our lives lined up to live life with a purpose are we christians on a mission do we have a need this morning a mission a desire in our hearts that in order to come into contact with god let me ask you this do you need a miracle do you need a breakthrough in a situation in your life do you need a word from god sometimes we just need a word from god do you need healing this morning brothers and sisters it's a time to expect great things in christ you know sometimes people come up and they get things going on in their life and the next thing you know they they ask for this and they pray for this and they're just stubborn enough to receive it in their life they're just stubborn enough to receive it whether or not god really wants them to have it but because of their mindset and the way they think they believe and they stand up on the promise that they think in their mind and they have it where does it leave us as christians has been speaking to us over and over and over about becoming one with him and trusting in him and letting him move on the scene in our life so what about it uh the letting the holy spirit take control of our every movements and creating the atmosphere that we want to live in creating the atmosphere you build a world and you go live in it that's the atmosphere you create but here's the thing about it we control it we control it we control uh we control whether we yield to the holy spirit or whether we don't we control uh either we came expecting this morning or we don't let me ask you this question did you come this morning with a dedicated plan to prove god in action did you come this morning to prove god and to call god on the scene are you just here for the food so to speak you know there's a difference you've heard the same people go to a wedding they're not really there uh to participate in the wedding they're not in the wedding party hey i'll see you nice for you to be here i'm just here for the food and that's the way sometimes people come to church they don't come to church with a plan they don't come to church with an action and when you fail to plan your your planning to fail and so they come and they just come for the food the words going forth they take in the work they hear the word all that's nice the preacher is doing good and you know praise god we're out of here they've done their duty for the week but what about coming and saying i'm going to come get something from god today i've got a need in my life i've got a desire that i can't fulfill i've got something that i need god to move on the scene i need a miracle you know you don't know you need a miracle till you need a miracle you don't think about it until it's in your in your court and you have to have a miracle but you come to god with a plan and say i'm going to get something from god that's the difference galatians 4 if you want to follow along now i say that the heir as long as he is a child difference nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children we were in bondage under the elements of this world but when the fullness of time had come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that they might receive adoptions of sons and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his sons unto your heart crying here it is again abba father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son than an heir of god through christ brother and sister god is calling us to that higher place this morning we've been under the tutorship of the message of the hour for years we've been under the message of the hour we've been under the tutorship of the prophet for years let's think about it there's people that's been around this message that said in the prophet's meetings they've got kids sitting in the message churches grandkids sitting in message churches great grandkids sitting in message churches some people have great great grandkids setting in message churches so it's not because of the life of not seeing god's greatness we've seen god's greatness we've seen god good in the lives of others and we've seen it in the in the bible in the lives of the prophet but what about you what about me what are we exercising this morning what is god doing in our life what about our personal experience with god you know we listen to the stories that the prophet tells and we see how the prophet calls god on the scene and we see how that god moves on the scene and how god takes over the scenario and the scenes and i'm just going to read a few of these things to you today some of the stories that we've heard since we cut our teeth on the message brotherhood was telling the story and he said you may laugh at this but that'll be between you and god there was a big old male cow down there that had killed a man and they sold him to another farm he said well i was there in the game warden i had to go out and turn fish loose that afternoon and some minnows up in the creek and i had a sick call over the way and i thought well i'll just walk over there and make this sick call and i'll go over there and pray for this person that's sick and then i'll go back to my truck and he said so i got out of my truck and i walked across the field and i'm going over there and there's some little shrubs i never thought about this fella sitting over in the field he never thought about this fella sitting over in the field and he said there you know i was out in the middle of that field maybe 300 yards from the fence and the fence four to five feet high and he said all of a sudden i jumped that big fella and recognized that i was in the field he was in can you imagine walking across that field we've heard this story numerous times but he's walking across this field and a 2 000 pound bull stands up that has already killed a man and he's 300 yards away from any kind of safety and security and he said he raised up there and that big fellow let out a billow like and threw his head down and he said it's the truth he said i knowed he could beat me to the fence and there was nothing to do there but die right in the field the prophet of god is staring death face to face two thousand pound bull and he said he started coming at me and he said but something happened and i wish it would only happen now and stay that way but instead of hating that bull i loved him you mean just loving brother bile or preached on love here a little bit the other day and what love would do for us you mean love just loving an animal a a a rank 2 000 pound bull just putting love and shadow and love upon him will cause him to turn he said i just loved him he said that seems strange but i thought poor fella i disturbed him he said i wasn't no more afraid of him he wasn't going to hurt me he said there was no fear at all i loved him and he said he started coming towards me with his head down like that and throwing dirt all over his back has anybody ever seen a bull do that it's not a fun sight they begin to paw and they stick their head in the ground they throw dirt up about 10 feet in the air they mean business and a 2 000 pound bull will crush you in an instant and here's this bull coming at him throwing his head up and he said he run right up to me and i thought well that poor fella i'd hate to be woke up like that too you mean the prophet put himself in the place of a bull he put himself there he showed love to him he put himself there and thought i would hate to be woke up like that too and he got down there and i looked and i said now look i'm sorry that i disturbed you i didn't mean to do that you're god's animal and i'm god's servant and god is sending me over here to pray for a sick woman and i'm on god's mission do you remember one of the first things i asked you this morning do you have a mission do you have a godly mission do you come to church with a purpose do you get up every morning and go through life with a purpose for god or are we just going through the motions do you have a purpose i'm on a mission i'm god's servant you don't want to hurt me in the name of jesus go go back to where you are and lay down and he said that bull running right towards me as hard as he could got within five feet and he and then he threw out his feet and stopped five feet he threw out his feet and stopped like that and he looked sideways can you imagine that bull that was just kicking up dirt and just had one mission on his mind to put that man in the ground and now he still comes to a halt and says huh my thoughts have changed i no longer want to kill you i don't know why but i no longer want to kill you and he said he started to look at him sideways and look so depleted don't you love it when you can deplete the devil when the devil comes at you and he's raging he's rampant and he's throwing dust and snorting and kicking and coming to you to kill you and you can say stop and he's depleted wow and he said and he he turned right around and he went over there and laid right down under that tree and that's a killer brother and sister that's when we have to realize that god's still alive and that's what the prophet said he said god's not dead i did that because god is still alive it's the same god that was there in daniel's day just like it's the same god that was there in the prophet's day for us and we learn constantly from these experiences to draw us closer into a place that we can operate in a godly fashion he said last summer i was mowing my yard it's a big yard as all the kids heard these stories i think all you adults have all the kids heard them maybe some sometimes learn from them i was in my backyard he said mow in the yard and i couldn't get nobody to help me i mowed a few rounds and and i had to run in and take my overalls off don't you just love seeing the prophet as a human i had to run in and take my overalls off and i put on my suit and i had to go in and pray for them and then i get get rid of them run them back out and i'd make a couple more rounds and the grass was growing in the front yard before i could get the backwood mowed and he said i was in the backyard one afternoon a pair of overalls and i just taken my shirt off you know it was hot and i was mowing as hard as i could this little low mower and there's a fence that runs down beside a bird box he said i put a little martin house up for the kitties and right in there there was a bunch of hornets that had built in there and he said and me with no shirt on and he said and there i was i bumped up against it and against that fence and they covered me in just a few minutes time and me with no shirt on brother sister that's a good time to call god seen sometimes we find ourselves in situations that we didn't intend and sometimes these situations can get a little bit sticky and i don't know if you've ever been surrounded by bees or hornets but it's not a fun experience i keep bees on the phone and i put on bee suit and i i try to cover up hands and arms and face but i had a hive over at our place and i asked the guy about the beer i said did you sell me killer bees he said i don't think so i know these things are devils i said i take the lid off i smoke them i do everything i'm supposed to do and i take the lid off and they just come boiling up out of there i said you can't control them he said really yeah really and i'm working the bees and of course it's the best hive i've got and i got them i finally got it broke apart and trying to get the honey and i'm setting the hive the box over here in this box over here and and next thing i know ah they got me in the leg got me in this leg and then i feel something and they're just beating my leather gloves i'm talking 15 20 at a time on each hand and i'm doing this i'm shaking and i'm going to get away from this stuff so i walk over and just give them a minute and i thought i'll let them calm down hey it looked like they calmed down i said they look like they've calmed down and here they come again and hundreds of bees coming up bowling out of here and just surrounding me and trying to get me from every direction it's not a fun feeling and he said here these beasts surrounded him they mean business brothers and sisters they surround him and they said you know i thought the same thing about the bull i didn't mean to bother you i didn't mean to disturb you and he said little fellas i'm sorry that i deserve to disturb you i'm god's servant how many of you here today are doing something for god you're putting your life on display i hear your comments when i talk to you you're witnessing here you're witnessing there you're trying to spread the message you're trying to spread the gospel of jesus christ you're serving god as you serve others and he said i'm god's servant and he said people come here and i minister to him and he said i'm in a hurry to get the art mode i'm sorry i disturb you now in the name of jesus christ little fellas go back to your box and i'll disturb you no more i didn't have that kind of faith these beans were boiling out of that box but the problem said go back and and go back to your box and he said them hornets they lined up one by one and went straight back into that box and never bothered him again calling god on the scene what was his expectation what do you think the prophet was expecting when he said in the name of jesus christ go back into your box what was his expectations when he spoke to that bull and said now go back over there i'll bother you no more do you think he thought well i'm going to say this but i'm probably fixing to get killed no it's all in your mind in the way we think in the way we believe in our faith as our faith gets stronger when you say what you mean and you mean what you say in the name of jesus christ go back into the box he never had a doubt in his mind that those hornets were going to go back he knew that something had happened in his life and had changed him in a way that he could speak to those hornets and they do exactly what he said to do he said he was in portland oregon one more and we're going to move on just getting my foundation he was in portland oregon and he said he was in a meeting there the other night standing there preaching and i've seen this great big huge fellow running there like this with his hands shaking and he said i thought maybe he had a telegram for someone he said and all of a sudden he got up to the platform and there were about 200 preachers standing back there behind me on the platform and they just shrunk out of the building and i thought what's the matter he said and here this fellow turned around great shoulder stood about six foot and a half tall and big fists great arms and he said i weighed about 128 at the time little man big stature i weighed about 128 at the time and he said but he must have weighed about 250 or 260 and he looked at me and he said you snake in the grass you're imposing yourself as a man of god i'm gonna break every bone in your weasley little body and show you what you're made of has sat never talk to you like that and satan never come to you and threaten you and say i'm going to break every bone in your body i'm going to expose i'm going to show everybody that you're not truly a child of god i'm going to show everybody that you're not rapture material i'm going to show everybody that you have no faith and this man comes up to him and he's putting his threats upon him and he said well i thought my this great big fella he's able to carry out his threat he said i turned around and there was no preachers left 200 of them you know sometimes we're going through our most threatening times of our life and there ain't a friend to be found why is that who do you have to depend on amen god puts us in those places sometimes where and we're between a rock and a hard place so that he can come in and say now you have nobody in your life there is no friends that's going to stand for you nobody's going to have your back but you will have to rely on me where do you stand what are your expectations this morning and he said so i looked everywhere and i guess i noticed that this man was out a maniac out of the insane institute and come to find out he had broken the jaw of a preacher just the week before and he's looking at this man face to face now and i was standing there and i thought well what was i going to say i said well what's the matter with you sir what's the matter with you sir and just about that time the same thing happened the presence of the lord came in and i just kept still how many times have we been talking about just yielding to the presence of the lord the presence of the lord came down he said and i just kept still so he was yielding himself to the lord he said and he walked towards me with those big fists drawn and and everybody was breathless and he said i'll break every bone in your body i'll knock you plumb back over in the middle of the floor you snake in the grass i never said a word looked up up to him like that he was coming to me with his teeth set tighter his eyes bulged in he looked at him and i never said a word but he said brother you better know where you're talking about in those kinds of times you better know what you're talking about in those kinds of times he said and then about then i heard something talking and it was myself he said and it said because you have challenged the spirit of god tonight you'll fall over my feet and that maniac looked at him and he said i'll show you i'll show you that i won't be falling over your feet tonight because you're a hypocrite and he walked right to me and spit in his face wow you're talking about having to have the presence of god in your life and he said and i looked at him and said satan come out of this man in the name of jesus christ he threw his hands up his eyes bulged way out and he turned around and around and fell on the floor and pinned my feet to the floor was this because it was the prophet no it's because he stood where jesus christ was jesus christ was right there and this man who had made threats upon jesus christ and the ministry of jesus christ now stands pinned to the floor of the man of god he said the police had to come and roll him off of there before he could move his feet the presence of almighty god no matter what it is he's lord he's a very present help in a time of trouble don't be afraid he says stand your ground when god moves god is god and he will do it now if he says tonight if the lord jesus christ has promised us this thing that if we would believe why it's all things are possible do you believe that all things these are possible what was the ministry of the prophet what did the angel tell him he said the angel told him said if you can get the people to believe to believe on william branham no he said if you get the people to believe then all things are public impossible if they can believe on jesus christ brothers and sisters the who's was those stories told for those stories were told for you and they were told for me that was our training it was to build our confidence in christ these stories are more important than just a story back in 1960 but what has happened the truth of the matter is we've let stories become common i can i can about assure you that as i began to tell these stories there were some thoughts going through this building i've heard this before we've heard this ten times we've heard this a hundred times don't we have any new material we gotta learn from material we got first we gotta learn how to put the material we got into action first and so many times we hear these stories and they become common and preachers in the past i got to be careful right here but preachers in the past they have preached these stories in such a way that it appears that these things can only happen in the life of william branham and that's simply not the case it happens in the children of god god is willing to meet your expectations when you come to those places where you say god i need and i expect and i need you to move on the scene god is there when we draw god close just like he was for the prophet amen he was he was close to god no doubt probably way closer than i am and i try and i try to get closer and closer because i want the same kind of spirit and i want to see the same kind of things come to fruition that happened in his life but they wasn't just for him where is god when we need god where is god when we need god the message of the hour wasn't for the prophet it was for millions that would hear the message of the hour he was merely a servant in the hands of god a man what was his title a man sent from god he wasn't a man for god the only man from god a man sent from god to bring a message that would deliver the people around the world luke chapter 3 if you want to follow along and the people were in expectation chapter 3 verse 15. john the baptist here has been ministering and preaching and the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of john so they looked and they were absorbed in their thoughts they were absorbed in their thoughts and john and said whether he is the christ or not so we see desperate people in an eager expectation of their messiah coming and i like what one translation i've seen and i heard a preacher preaching and he said the expectation was and the translation was that the people were on tiptoes and anticipation and expectation the people were on their tiptoes and it reminded me of the little story that the prophet told with the little boys with no money that wanted to get into the carnival and here they are standing outside of the the fence in area they had so much excitement so much anticipation so much expectation that they would do whatever they had to do to see what was happening on the other side of that wooden fence and so they began to look there and they couldn't saddle brothers and sister for somebody else's experience they couldn't settle for what the people on friday night saw they couldn't settle for what the kids down the street saw they wanted to get there and they wanted to look in there for themselves so they had to see so what did they do they stood on their tiptoes and with this anticipation standing on their tiptoes looking through the knot hole in the fence they wanted to see what was on the other side and that's what we have to do we have to activate our faith to stand on our tiptoes and expectation knowing that god can do the impossible they looked on the other side and they stretched up and they looked and one might say i see an elephant and the other one looked and said i see a giraffe and the other one said i see see a line i can imagine once i get out of my way let me see brother says i'm we're looking through the nut hole i see healing i see deliverance i see peace and understanding i see love and joy i see overcoming i see the power of god i see a conqueror i see the line of the tribe of judah what are your expectations it's for you this morning it's for you this morning to expect and to receive what you have expected turn with me to acts chapter three acts chapter three very familiar story peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour here lays this certain man lame from his mother's womb and he lays up the day at the gate day to day at the temple which is called beautiful and he's there to ask alms of the people who's entering into the temple who's seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asking all and peter fastened his eyes upon him with john and said look on us and he gave heed unto them what expecting to receive something from them now what was he expecting to receive he was expected to receive a little silver a little piece of gold a little a little bit of a trinket a little something he could spin and put into his savings that's what he was looking to receive but peter looked at him and he said silver and gold have i not but such as i have i give of thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and he takes this lame man by the hand he lifts him up and immediately it says his feet and his ankles come together his feet and his ankles come under him and he stood and he leaped and he walked and can you imagine the people as they begin to look upon this man who laid for his whole entire life at the gate asking for money because he's crippled his feet turned in legs drawn up muscles atrophied and they see this man now running but what was it from birth he was carried to the temple day after day to beg his life revolved around his sickness his life revolved around his sickness day in and day out but this day something was about to change this day something was about to change this day this man activated his faith this day this man received a miracle right then and there because of his great expectations so when he when he says what if i'm expecting expect him to receive what god i will honor your expectations even though you need money even though you need silver even though you need gold you have faithful and i know your true expectations what if he just said i've been here every day of my life i guess i'm destined to be here i guess i'm just going to be here every day of my life and give me a little gold give me a little silver you think he would have got his miracle no he would not have received his miracle because he hadn't got down there with the right kind of expectation but because he expected mark chapter 10. for even chapter 10 verse 45 for even the son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many they came to jericho and went out jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat by the highway side begging and when he had heard that jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus now son of david have mercy on me and what happened many charged him and commanded him and told him to hold your peace but he cried out more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they called the blood man saying to him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee the next sentence is what i want you to to see and grasp a hold of and he cast away his garment and rose and came to jesus and jesus says what wilt thou i should do unto thee and the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight. and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith has made thee whole and immediately not yesterday not today not tomorrow immediately right now he received a sight and followed jesus now brothers and sisters you got to realize that in the biblical days being blind was a curse this guy was cursed people looked at him as cursed and the only way that they could financially support themselves was to go beg in the streets well they kind of had a problem similar to probably what we got today panhandlers out on the street wanting money here wanting money there so what the government did they gave them a cloak if you can prove that you're blind you're lame and you truly need uh financial help we're gonna give you a cloak and this garment had significant colors it had significant markings and they had to wear this in order to bag it on the street and only true beggars could get it so here he is in the street with his cloak on permission to beg and here he is blind no doubt his ears are sharpened to the things going on around him and as they sit in their blind and he hears the conversations of the people walking down the streets there's a man called jesus there's a man called jesus and the miracles are being performed over and over we we're seeing all these things and bartimaeus can't believe but something begins to spark inside of it and he says you know what i want to meet this jesus i want to see this jesus and jesus is coming through the town and they say here comes jesus and he can hear it and he says jesus thou son of david have mercy on me make a call out to jesus and see what happens start doing something for jesus and see if you don't get try to get quietened down make it make a move make a stand make a make a movement for christ try to do something for christ and see what happens you can't do that don't you know who this man is jesus he called again have mercy on me thou son of david have mercy on me but this time it was different this time he had an opportunity to meet the healer face to face and he was not going to be silenced anymore and as jesus looked at him it says he threw his cloak aside he threw off this garment why is that so significant he threw off his garment because he's saying i'm throwing away my old life i won't let this garment hinder me anymore i'm throwing off my comfort zone i'm getting rid of the way i used to live and i'm no longer going to be defined as a beggar i'm no longer going to be living in darkness this wasn't just a shirt or a jacket this right here was his livelihood brothers and sisters this was life or death this was live or die feast or famine how many of us are willing to do that when god calls we call out to god a lot jesus jesus i need i need jesus jesus i ah but are we willing to take off our cloak are we willing to cast away all of the old things in our life are we willing to step aside and say god i'm not gonna live for you but this guy was so desperate for a change he threw away his garment still blind as a bat still blind as a bat throws away his garment and makes a stand for christ i want to remind you about something i want you to think and be reminded that the devil is not concerned with what you used to be think about that he's not concerned with what you used to be and i want you to think that the devil is not concerned with what you are let that sink in for just a minute he's not concerned with what you used to be or what you are he's quite content if you remain just in your old crippled your old blind state he's content with you being right there and never expecting things to be content you're not a threat to him in that state you're not a threat to the devil right now but you know what torments him what torments satan is when you get into a place he's terrorized at the thought of what you can be that's exactly right you say i'm not what i used to be you're not what i want to be i'm not i'm not what i ought to be but you there's more for you brothers and sisters there's more for us as believers and we got to keep going and going and we got to get up on our tiptoes with the spirit of expectation and saying that the best is still yet to come tomorrow is a different day tomorrow i'll do more for christ you don't have to see it to believe it just start now praising expectation you say well i don't feel like praising the lord pray anyway well i don't feel good i'm tired praise god anyway you say well my business is not doing well soak your crops with expectation see what happens put the expectation that you want god to bless out there and see if he blesses you say well i don't even have the strength to pray pray with expectation expect the outpouring of the holy spirit in every area of your life because god is able if we just tiptoe if we tiptoe up and we look and we get up and we say today i expect god to move today i can be healed today i can be filled today i can be blessed today i can be anointed so where are you expecting god to break through in your life one last story this story is always amazed me there was a prophet of god coming from dallas texas he's flying from dallas texas and he said we got in a storm and we were forced to land they didn't say flight 282 you might want to detour flight 282 you might want to uh just go around these clouds you might want to go a few few thousand feet higher to get over the clouds but he said you are forced to land you find the the the airport right now in memphis tennessee and and this airplane is grounded by the storm and he's there all night long and he said they put him in a hotel he didn't know what to do so he started writing letters and somehow god just constantly orchestrates in our lives and he begins to write these letters and he's going about his business he gets up the next morning and it's supposed to be at the limousine at x number of time to take him to the airport and he said he just got to sitting there and all of a sudden something said stop a minute stop a minute he said i was thinking and i just kept going see he wasn't always obedient to the word either he said i just kept going he said but then something said again stop a minute he said so i had these letters in my pocket and i thought well i'll put them in the mailbox on the corner and then something said just keep walking and i thought well i better get back i'm going to miss my limo ride just keep walking i started again and i turned to go this way and something said just keep walking you know sometimes when we're doing something and we're going forward with god and god's moving in our life things are going good and the devil comes and he starts saying things to us back and forth sometimes we just gotta look at them and say i'm just gonna keep walking i'm just gonna keep walking with where god wants me to be it doesn't matter what anybody thinks what anybody says what anybody does i'm just going to keep walking and he says i'm just going to keep walking i went on walking first thing you know i come over on the other side of the river part there and i find myself in a little colored district and a bunch of shadies he said the sun was high i looked at my watch it was already 7 30 and i was two miles from the hotel but something just kept saying walk i just walked i started singing that little song there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all aflame and he said i was humming it and i looked over there at this little shannon leaning across the gate was this typical old aunt jemima she had a shirt tied around her head and great big fat cheeks and he said i was about 40 yards from her and she was humming and i was humming that song and i passed on by it was such a beautiful morning the the storm had come through the roses the honeysuckle the fragrance was bursting and and this old colored woman i passed side she passed by she said good morning pawson and i turned and looked at her and i said good morning auntie and he said tears tears was running down those big black fat cheeks and she was smiling and i said how did you know i was a person listen what she said i know you was coming how does she know you talk about her expectation she had such an expectation how did you know auntie she said did you ever read in a bible about that shulamite woman yes ma'am i have i i was that kind of woman i had no children i was a wash woman and said i promised the lord if he'd ever give me a child i'd raise it for his glory and he said i've been a christian ever since i was a little baby girl no doubt she had an old nanny that taught her the word of god she said in some holy ghost meetings too now here she says not on not on grandma's experience but on her experience because it's her child laying there dying and she looked to be in her 50s or 60s and she said the lord gave me a fine boy parson said but he got out with the wrong company and he took a disease syphilis and his blood was four plus and the doctor man said that there was nothing he could be done for him and he's in the room dying and the doctor man had left the day before yesterday and he's unconscious that he would never gain consciousness again she said parson i just couldn't stand to see my baby in that condition said i prayed to the lord all night before last and all last night and along about two o'clock in the morning i fell asleep and i dreamed that i was talking to the lord she said lord you gave me the baby just like you did this you know white woman but where's my elisha and the lord told me to look and i seen a man coming and this man was wearing a tan suit and a little tan hat and said it was you parson and i has been standing here at this gate before daylight waiting for you to come and i said auntie my name is branham did you ever hear of me no sir it wasn't about brother brown that's where we get this story mixed up we want to put the emphasis on what brother branham did here no no no this story is about her and her situation says parson branham did you ever hear me no he said i pray for the sick no sir i never did hear of you and she wasn't interested this is what the prophet said she wasn't interested about praying for the sick she didn't want her boy to die in that lost condition he said i went in through that chain old chain hanging gate there and and you know he said it had a plow uh shank on it to pull it back shut and he said i went into that house no rug on the floor no iron uh an old iron bed beds uh steed and black boy laying there about 180 pounds six foot tall and he said i looked around and there was a sign on the wall and said god bless our home and he said i've been in king's palaces i've been in the king of england's palace king george the late king george i was in gustav of sweden always welcome the krueger place at south africa i hope i'm not pronouncing these right many other places and i've been welcomed but i never felt any more welcome than i did in that little shack that morning because god was there that's where i want to be i don't have to be rich i don't have to be increased goods i don't have to have the pleasures and the good things of life but let god be there let god be there over my family let god be in my home let god be first and he said i walked in and that big boy laying there had a blanket in his hand going huh i said good morning sir she said parsons he ain't spoke the word and know nothing for three days he's dying she knew her situation he's dying and i looked at her and she said will we pray and i knelt down on the floor and that little boy that boy said huh and he said i thought that poor fella i felt his feet they were just as stiff and icy as they could be i don't know if you've ever felt that but it's a feeling you never forget when somebody's dying as nurses i felt it many times and he said he's very sick what's he mumbling he said parson he's saying it's dark in here he's been saying it for three days and he thinks he's on the ocean lost and he's in a little boat and he thinks he's rowing this boat and he's lost in the dark and he's screaming and tears are now running down her face as she's telling us to to brother brown and says parson i just can't stand to see my baby die like this and i said let's pray auntie and we knelt down and watch what he did and i said you pray you pray that's right it wasn't the prophet it wasn't the man sent from god it wasn't all the healing campaigns all the crutches all the wheelchairs all the cots in africa that was loaded up into the busloads you pray you pray and he said she began to pray and i tell you oh my you talk about a prayer that black woman rendered a prayer to god that would make the hardest heart cry i stood there and bathed in the beauty of god while she was praying and she wiped her big eyes out and she said now will you pray parson now will you pray i put my hand over his feet i said lord i don't know why i was led down here but maybe this is the place i can't understand but i pray you help this poor dear saint of yours who stood faithfully her back wet with the dew we're through the night in the early morning expectation sometimes we give up on our expectations sometimes we call god for god to come on the scene and before the first new drop falls we give up on god sometimes brothers and sisters we need to set our roots set our feet deep into the ground and root ourselves like a great oak tree and say no matter what happens god you need to move on the scene for me and my expectation god is that you're coming and i pray god that whatever i have to do to get you here you come spare this boy spare the life of this poor boy he said i got no more no that much more out of the prayer until he said mama he said i stopped he said yes honey baby what does mama baby want that's love he says that's the love that conquers the bull that's the love that conquers the hornets that's the love that heals the blind that's the love and the expectation that heals the crippled that's the love that's calling us to come up higher to a higher place in our life that we can stand where empty did you say i don't want to stand where i want to get i don't either but i want to know i got that kind of faith and that i've got the kind of expectation that makes me stand right there when the when the going gets tough he said what does mama's baby wants he said though he would disgrace her home and was dying in sin with a venereal disease that mother still loved him and he said then i can't help but think about the grace of god with your names engraved on the palms of his hands and she began kissing him and he said mama it's getting light in the room in less than five minutes time that boy was sitting on the side of the bed and he was giving glory to god and brother randall said i struck a plane i got out of a cab and got out there two hours late but it was just making the last call he said the faith of that colored woman grounded that plane and held it there he said my when i think of those things and the many things i've seen and think how rich how pure how fathomless and strong the love of god is for a poor insignificant peasant ignorant colored woman but her prayers grounded the plane and held it there and sent me down there for that boy what expectation and brother branham goes on to tell the story you know he was going to go uh heading to phoenix and he goes into memphis into the train station and said somebody jumped off the comer running at him there and said parson branham how do you do he said don't you know me i don't believe i do son he said you remember that morning you come down to my house and i was dying he said you're not that boy he said yes parcel i was healed and i was a christian
