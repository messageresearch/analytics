bless you we'll just want to continue on our series amen with the help of the Lord um we want to kind of pick up some of the things we left undone and then just kind of keep moving forward a little bit want to try to read recap a little bit of what we touched on and then just go keep going amen so praise the Lord amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you Lord and we want to thank you Lord Jesus for the opportunity to be able to assemble ourselves together father having the freedom to live in a country yet where we can have the freedom to do this knowing Lord Jesus that we even take this for granted Lord Jesus how the Saints of down Through the Ages would have led loved to have this Freedom Lord but they had to meet in dens and caves of the earth and they couldn't have a meeting and there's other places in the world they can't have meetings like this amen because for fear of their life or imprisonment Lord so we Conor the grand privilege Lord to be able to assemble ourselves tonight Lord and we want to make the most of it father help us to really really make the most of every time that we have the ability Lord Jesus and the freedom to assemble ourselves together in your name and let us open the ears of our ears the hearing father so that you might speak to our hearts father exactly what you have want us to hear tonight Lord and father you know the secrets of the heart we already been taught that Lord and your discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart you know exactly what everybody needs what they're thinking where what their need is Lord and I'm so appreciative Lord of your word where it said that heavenly father knows what we have need of before we even ask but so we know that you are watching ing over us and we thank you God thank you that you take us through every trial through every hardships and different things that come along father we ask God that you'll bless the meditation of our heart your word and that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to speak in Jesus name we commit ourselves to you amen turn your bibles if you will amen and we'll go into uh The Book of Matthew The Book of Matthew I'm going to have to get a different book believe it or not I'm been doing this 30 years and I think I'm getting it down a little bit better on how to write my notes down a little bit and even this book I just I you know I always saved all those yellow papers you know save all my message and stuff I says why I says why don't I just get a book and just there they all are you see not that I use him again amen uh but anyway so now I figured out that I need one that has a has one that pops open so I'll you'll probably see me here one that pops open because I'll I'll go about two pages or so and that maybe three pages and I'm like no there's something else that I want to get before this you know and I'm gonna have to so I need to be able to pop that open put me a new page right in there you know so I'm trying amen y'all are praying for me amen thank you very much God bless you tonight amen so Luke I believe it is in Luke no it's not Luke that I want it's Matthew 7 Matthew 7 Matthew 7 and like I said I have a lot of scriptures I want to read so amen we want to uh expound a little bit more on the Rock would that be okay uh perhaps before we even expound on that we want to go back a little further amen and we want to talk about a little bit more about what it means Amen to have uh an experience on the back side of the desert we're still not done with the back side of the desert Believe It or Not amen so we want to we want to pick up just a few thoughts there because amen and then I'll just see what the Lord will have but let's read this so you can be seated amen I know you've probably worked all day and you get to sit amen while I work amen would that be all right amen we don't usually do that on jobs do we but anyway praise the Lord 7:24 [Applause] therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a Rock Amen the rains descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house amen and it fell not for it was founded upon a Rock Amen now how many know knows am mean what the real rock is the rock of Revelation is that right amen that's the only rock that you can be built on that am mean all the Prevail against it no matter how many winds come is that right no matter how many floods come amen praise the Lord the the rock this that house will stand and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand the rains descended in the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall of it may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can SE it praise the Lord so this evening we want to speak with the help of the lord we want to talk about amen that rock we want to talk about that anchor we want to talk also about amen rest amen we want to try to carry it over into a rest and amen basically I want to come off of this one quote where amen that we started with is this okay amen now I'm bring that out but I won't mention that um I won't read it because I don't have this quote with me but where brother bham talked to where we started off at where he says you know I just don't know what anybody what I would do if it wasn't for me to be a Christian I don't understand how anybody can go through this life without being a Christian I don't understand it amen praise the Lord and then of course as we know brother bam of course was about 12:00 or 11:00 I think he said in bed and so forth and no doubt brother bam was thinking about the Lord and so forth and he got a revelation and he begin to talk to his wife and she raised up he says you know and listened to him for a while and she went to preach and he says it this way and I said the Christian Base the Christian faith now remember this is part three of Amen uh looking about the Christian about the Christian Christian faith is based solidly upon rest amen that's right a Christian is not tossed about amen we covered some of that I believe it was Sunday talking about you know our emotions amen how that people live so much by their emotions amen up and down and in and out Bo if you you're on a roller coaster is that right see taste feel hear smell conscious read imagination and all those things then if you're on that and you're going by that you're certainly going to be tossed about memory boy each one of those takes so much time to think about it amen the a Christian doesn't run from place to place he says a Christian doesn't fuss amen and fume and worry about things a Christian rests amen it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary amen now the last song you sing Oh sickness may come this appointments but the Christians at rest knowing this that God is able to keep that which he has performed or promised isn't that right knowing that no matter what the thing is or how it looks there's not sickness there's no sorrow there's no death there's no starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of [Music] God praise be to God Amen there's not salvation or anything that can separate us from the love of of God I like that don't you amen this is where we kind of left off and U uh I believe uh 2 Corinthians 4 amen uh you know we left off talking about you know how that the Christian amen once you're on the backside of that desert and you have got that anchor amen and you've got got your anchor gripped upon the solid rock of Jesus Christ and I want you to understand that as I study this and as I look at this I realize that there is I haven't even touched I really haven't even touched a whole lot of the what it means that backside of the desert that backside of the desert experience it means a lot amen and all the things that it types and and the the shadows of it amen talking about coming to the death of yourself or you know the back side of the desert hey Moses had to learn that it's not about you Moses didn't brother bam say that God took had take Moses on the back side of the desert amen and working him for 40 years to him to died to himself a't that right took him 4 years to get all of that education and that knowledge and all that his own abilities and everything out of him amen and and finally he man he did you know and and from that he became a mighty man of God God is taking amen and and breaking us down now uh like I said let me just uh it's also type another type I want to just touch this before we go further on on and how How firm that we are gripped upon the rock but you know in that backside of the desert experience here we are upon the rock there's another an example of it I believe it is I mean you can take the eagle story isn't that right take the eagle story of how that egg is hatched amen amen it may have looked like a chicken and acted like a chicken but it wasn't no chicken is that right something has transformed something changed oh my praise the Lord I like what he said oh I want you to get this don't you never let this pass from you if a man's ever stood in that sacred sands on the back side of the desert when he meets God face to face there's not enough devils and all of Hell could ever take that away from him we've covered that he knows that he's met God he knows that he's had an experience he talked to God regardless of what the opposition is he can say from that time something changed me how many know that a caterpillar a worm like that amen before they go through a metaphor morphos I believe it's called amen they go into this cocoon and Cocoon so to speak hangs there become liquefied and everything else amen but when that cocoon comes out it comes out not a wiggly old worm that you would brush off of yourself but a wonderful butterfly that you would enjoy having on your hand and that's about the way that a Believer is you get in the presence of God and let God change you amen and you won't have a wolf nature anymore amen God will take you and change you from a wolf I could tear that person to PES how you doing my brother how are you I just love you brother huh he'll change your nature from a wolf to a Sheep amen even it's better B another illustration of the back side talking about a watermelon you take the life of or not just a watermelon but the life of anything and transported and that's what happens on the back side God takes your life out and he puts his life in he takes a Dage or gunfight or whatever amen that out of him and he puts a different spirit in so many different illustrations of that backside of the desert of what God does it's amazing how many know that backside of desert's experience is amazing grace we'll be talking about that backside of desert through all of eternity all you can talk about the Mysteries and deep things of God but I one my Prophet he'll be singing amaz sing Grace How Sweet the Sound you'll hear me way down in hmer [Applause] that's like me W listen to that way down them h i here now Amen Brother John I have his holl I'll have my holl with holler we'll be hollering up the holler GL I was was lost but now I'm found I was bind but now I see that's what it means to be changed from one thing to another Hallelujah to be anchored from being on in sand to on a solid rock you realize that everything about your own life is all sinking sand this world is sinking sand nations are sinking sand time is sinking sand your body sinking sand I didn't even realize it but I thought about an hourglass with all of that sand I said you know our lives are like that sand going down through there and then later I remembered there's a Ryme or something that says as the hours through the S uh as the Sands through the hour is that right so are the days of our lives huh every time that sand drips down there goes another one of your days there goes another day there goes another day it's getting emptier down here up here Fuller down there amen when that last sand goes through amen that's it for this life but aren't you glad that you can get on a rock that that doesn't mean it's the end of it hello amen God will flip it over god'll flip it over that keep flipping over we'll be flipping for an eternity we'll never die how many glad that you have been brought from the dead to [Music] life amen amen I was thinking about another illustration of what happened on the back side what happened on the back side and I thought there's the scripture says somewhere of something about as those from the dead I went to looking for it something about raising from the dead I know we've been quickened we we who were once dead in sins and trespasses but I thought there was a more sure scripture amen about us raising from the dead amen so let me just say this you and I are like Lazarus you're like Lazarus in the grave huh you can say I know what it's like to be like Lazarus in the grave and to have him here and to hear him call my name how many knows those who he predestinated he called how many believ God calls you amen I thought boy you better have scripture for this but you don't want to be going off somewhere huh so I looked and I found something over in in in in Romans 8 7 I believe it was in verse four wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead and I saidwell that's not talking about me that's Christ that's the wrong scripture you know and I was looking for the scripture and now God knows if I found it but I looked over across here and there's something in pink over here all right that says what and I look and it says because it's something about us raising from the dead and it says in verse 11 no let's just go to that one because I want to come back and pick that other one up well let's just read it likewise if I go back I'll be turkey hunting I'll lose all my stuff so we're going to lose if I don't pick it up right here re likewise reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let sin therefore not let not sin therefore rain in your moral body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of righteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the [Music] dead wo act like you have risen from the [Music] dead how many knows on the back side of that desert oh brother B he had to preach amen different message but how that we are to die to ourselves not just to die but to rot to ourselves that's he asked to completely die I want you understand tonight I hope tonight after tonight we realize maybe we get a picture of whether we are really dead or not huh I want to make let's see how just really how dead we are because we can never get the rest never get the rest until you're dead oh my boy I'm get ahead of myself God rested on the sabath day there's a rest of people of God is't that right and Paul Paul here he was an example of somebody that was anchored ain't that right he knew what it was like he said I am crucified with Christ huh I'm crucified Paul could say I'm dead I like that he could tell you you better be dead he says that we are not to serve sin but we're going to act amen as though we have been risen from the dead cuz that's exactly what we we were dead how many believe we were dead in sins and trespass and God quickened you brought you to life amen thank the Lord as those that are alive from the dead oh my preach a sermon on the dead does the dead don't praise God they don't worship God the Bible says the dead praise you not they just don't do nothing much down there except lay there hello that's about about old former church member they sit there and they don't do nothing Harley they just sit there let your neighbor know you're alive [Applause] woo let everybody know you're live I am so glad for that backside of the desert experience it is the greatest honor the greatest privilege when he could have call bil that's billions of people out there that don't have what you have and God picked you why the world shouldn't you be happy it's Amazing Grace how sweet this sound I ain't going to be cold and for about it I the world know that I a Son of God I'm saved by grace he has given me eternal life he has taken my whole life out and he has put his life in me he has put in me his creative power you love the Lord oh my pray for me will you I've learned that taking it slower better oh I like to preach like brother Andrew Glover boy he can just he is a Gatlin gun he'll quote them quotes out he'll just blow the devil all the pieces amen but I like brother brandom I guess he said brother BR says I just can't think of it that fast oh my praise be to God but some of these things brothers and sisters what I'm trying to say about slow is just take these little nuggets you me just that thing on the back side of the desert my just just what it's all about everything from that CAD pillar to that eagle story Amen to that little creature brother brand talk about but B talked about you know the difference between a man or or somebody that's saved perhaps or even you can type with somebody going to heaven and and and what this Earth is like it's like that one time that we was down in the depth of the sea he said there's creatures down there from what to understand he says don't even have eyes all they have is sensors it's so dark down there they don't need eyes all they have is feelers they have little feelers out there oh oh there's something there huh is that right so deep down they can't see nothing they just have a feeler I thought that's the way a lot of people are they only way they can live by their feelings Lord have mercy it's a terrible way to live cuz I don't want to brush up against a big old shark would you or something that would eat me before I finally figured out hey you better swim as fast as you can jig Jag and zigzag and get out of here amen but he says you take that little old fish amen and you bring him up and all of a sudden you make him a human being and he would say I I don't ever want to be down in that Darkness again I don't ever want be with all guys again I want to see the beauty of the creation of almighty God don't you realize that unless you a man unless he is born again he cannot even see the kingdom of God you are Lind to the kingdom of God unless you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you think you can see but you can't really see it oh it's like taking a drink of lemonade oh I got the lemonade I got the lemonade that don't do nothing for you not until you drink the lemonade oh taste and see that the Lord is good amen it don't do no good there and that's what it is just in the mind it's got to be somewhere beside just in the mind that's another type of What It's Like on the backside of the desert experience being transformed from that fish into a human being and I'll tell you what that's you was a vile wretched sinner lost and dead in darkness God called you God called you Hallelujah think about it out there no good a lost condition can to feel that something more than this something more than this more God how many can feel that tonight how many can feel there's more God there's more God for me woo let me believe there's more God for you Danny there's more God for you there's more God for you there's more God for us and if there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond Glory there's got to be a deep to respond oh respond Lord cuz you and I are hungry for more [Music] God old mossback church member well I've been like this forever and I don't think it gets any better I don't think I can go any further n you probably won't you'll probably sit there in just that state and I believe you'll get worse because that's a pretty bad place to be isn't that right I'm always looking for something better better I want to be a better husband I want to be a better grandpa I want to be a better Pastor I want to be a better human being and I'll only do that without God I can do nothing oh I think about realize that it's not our glorification none of this I mean even the gift that God has put it's not oh b b is a preach no it's nothing me I am nothing we are nothing it's all him I don't care there's no big eyes and little you we're all in the kingdom of God and he gets all the glory he gets the praise ain't a good thing about us ain't a good thing about you and your old self nothing good about you I've got a revelation that even around the message am me the devil wants to make big preachers big preachers brother brandom never tried to make himself a big preacher never never ever did he ever did you ever see his office and the little desk and the humble little desk he had I got a better desk in the office and he did he knew how to stay humble amen something I hear especially in brother Donnie he says you know because the devil wants to lift you up a that right even brother bam said the preachers got to watch it because he ain't no and all of a sudden they think they're somebody he said you're going right back to the wrong way that you came from because the devil want to lift us up in Pride make us think like we're something we're nothing he's everything he's everything Glory we give him the glory cuz like Paul said amen it is to show that it's his power not our power amen praise the Lord I'm hurting myself up here but that's all right I've hurt myself for the Lord okay all right alive from I like that I wanted to I say somewh says something about being alive from the dead am me but I thought it was resurrected from the dead but it's not it's alive from the dead how many glad to be alive praise the Lord it means that God change you from a pig to a sheep or a wolf to a sheep because he says we had our conversations in the lust of the flesh serving him in Satan in in our conversation one time we were serving the devil ain't that right we were evil people amen but God comes and he does it transformation because this old Cocker huh we had a CO bur nature the outside is a Cocker but the inside there's a wheat germ down there I mean believe he took a little light he took a little water that woman at the well she was boy she was so vile people wouldn't even come out at the same time she said don't you come lady don't you come here while we're here you come back here at 7 o'clock when nobody's here huh but Jesus come spoke to her and Quicken that seed changed her from a prostitute to a real lady he'll take the viest human being viest man rudest man crudest man make a gentleman out of him take a drugie brother Tommy no good husband drugie and everything else and my change him to where his wife's proud of him that's the works of the Lord that's what God God does he changes us that's what it means to come to the backs side of the day oh thank you Lord thank you Lord for that Amazing Grace now Lord help me to make sure that I'm completely dead amen we want to make sure that we are because if there's still a little bit of something in you you haven't found that place at rest you haven't been anchored like you should Paul was he was a real example oh my before we read that we'll read I think it's in Philippians Philippians let's just see what Paul had to say not that I speak in resp persective on for I have learned I like that Paul learned something how many learning something I have learned that whatsoever State I am therewi to be content think about the make believer or the unbeliever in Jude it says these are murmurers complainers their own lusts and their mouth speaking great in words having men persons and admiration because of unbelief who are these murmurs and complainers spots in your Feast of CH when they Feast with you feeding themselves without fear they clouds that are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit wither without fruit chist dead plucked up by the roots whoa that's what he calls a complainer and a murmur Paul says my anchor is gripped so tight Ain that right now I lost my [Music] page I've almost decided not to have these silly tabs almost decided sister Sherry I need to know where the books of the Bible are without tabs I'd be better off all right now notice so he says I have learned that whatsoever say there with be content I know both how to be a based and I know how to abound I know what how to live on the Mountaintop and I know how to live in the valley as we grow older amen we should have less being carried about with emotions and affections fusses and stews and people saying bad stuff about you and huh having bad feelings and just that come on folks everywhere in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me how many believes it don't matter what you go through your Anor if that gra that experience amen you can do all things but without Christ how much can you do how much nothing with Christ you can do how much all things Paul said I can do all things through Christ which strengthen with me amen that's where we found 2 Corinthians 4 and we left off here last time talking about the God has blinded the minds of those who believe not least the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine on them however the God who commanded that light to shine out of Darkness has shined in your hearts Amen to give light to Quicken you to bring you to life amen but we have this Earth and we but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency may be of the the power may be of God not of us we are troubled on every side how many you are not promised a picnic no sir no yet not distressed trouble on every side but not distressed what did we preach on don't get all what did I write down here somewhere give it a rest I think it was give it a rest give it a rest rested in Christ amen now notice so he says that the power may be of God and not of us we're troubled now on down persecuted now that's not where I was going we're troubled on every side yet not distressed or what I called I think dismayed I looked up that word dismayed and I believe it had to do with being stressed out or you know losing your cool amen we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken how many glad not to be forsaken amen cast down but not destroyed always bearing B about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body don't let things get to you don't be dismayed no matter matter what happens and and then the Philistines said I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that he may fight that we may fight together oh I can just hear him can't you come on give me a m i want to fight him oh he talked very intimidating huh very intimidating like man he's going to tear me up huh heard those and when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistines they were dismayed and greatly afraid amen losing your grip lose control lose your cool get scared huh get afraid not something you want to happen no be like David huh don't you like it the way that David was I like the way that David was he didn't lose his cool he didn't every wind that come along Shake him I want to tell you something it's not about this body and strength of the muscle your strength lays in your spirit how many know is that your spirit is what gives you strength when you are completely dismayed when you are distraught when you are maybe lost a loved one very close to you you can be soow down until you just don't have any strength left you just feel like dying huh some of sometime people can't even stand anymore they just fall down they're so weak huh that's right strength leaves his the spirit when you're dismayed you lose your strength David when he heard the same boast ain't that right same boast I can just see David getting a grin on his face what did I just hear I heard a great big old walloping brute massive man with massive muscle that I look like a little natat to but I he just don't know the experience that I've had on the side of the desert amen with a bear God's creature that was just hungry okay the guy just needed something to eat Li he just needed something to eat and God give hunger and I took the my she back out of his mouth and slow him poor guy I was just trying to get a bite huh but he says you you don't belong to the armies of God you are uncircumcised you dare to defy the AR of the Living God come knocking on Saul's door huh the great guards come up there and say who are you I'm David what do you want I want to talk to Saul huh his armor Bears and the different ones took him in all right went in there and said I want to fight him huh is that right wants to fight him he wasn't dismay he wasn't a coward he wasn't greatly afraid no had confidence in his God how many knows that you better not do something just on your own you might get eaten by the lon but when God puts it in your heart when God puts that inspiration there cuz if you do it Len church as your pastor going to tell you if you do it in yourself you will bitterly fail so if you fail you know you're heard it from the pastor tonight that you must have been in yourself God help blind people that fail at every turn and they still don't see that they're wrong still don't see that it's not God that but they're trying to that's behind them [Applause] hello cuz I can say as your pastor I can say as a man of God that if it's God in you he does not fail God does not fail if it's God it won't fail but if you're impersonating that will fail it's in you it'll fail but David he wasn't impersonating he had a revelation God has placed in my heart he said what go fight him you kill him me kill him all right God if you want me to we'll take him down like we did the lion right that's right we'll take him down like we did the Bear right that's right now go talk to Saul huh come in there to Saul what did Saul do come here brother Glenn help me preach okay all right stand right here okay let's say that you're David right and all here I go and grab some big Shield put your shield on the front put shield on the back all right it's dragging the ground cuz so I mean he's a big guy and you're a little guy right right and he put all these armor on him put him do in a that right David shook a little bit shake a little bit what did he say take this stuff off of me yeah right you said I don't need this yeah because I got fight that I'm kill him yeah that's right he hadn't proven it had he he says I've never proved this thank you brother you're a good helper that's [Applause] right we need to prove him more prove him more and it'll strengthen your confidence that when you come up with whatever in the world comes your way you'll put your trust in him and you won't threaten worry you will rest faith is based upon rest folks amen it's resting in Jesus Christ that the work is done that it's him doing it not you when you've got the faith like that you can rest from all of your works from all of your doings is what we're to rest for we're to rest from all of your actions all of your word all your old self rest from your work take it easy take a rest let it rest oh may we let it rest praise be to God Amen all right well let's finish the story for crying out loud is that all right to say the pope but I guess it is my dad always said it for crying out loud what'd he do grab his bag he had a bag went got in five smooth Stones had a sling and she saw hey this is how I'll take him down it worked for the bear and it worked for the land it's right here we've proved it and here comes the words comes out there to the Goliath Goliath says am I a hound dog am I a dog did you sent puny little out here remember but man said he was a he was a puny little guy he was a little fella not much to look at he wasn't Arnold Schwarz neger by no means no he was a puny little guy a ruddy little fell he said man he says he he says looked at him and today I'm going to take you and pick you up with the end of my Spear and I'm G feed you to the birs D come back a little bit don't don't spit on me all right I want another your spit on me right he wasn't intimidated he say quit rattling when you get done rattling off your mouth I'm telling you right now I don't come to you with a sword and Spar but I come to you in the name of the god of Israel that's who I come to you and I will cut your head off amen he might have not yell he might said I'm gonna cut your head off did you hear that I'mma cut your head off he didn't have to yell loud he knew where he stood he knew that his words isn't going to be what intimidates or brings him down it was going to be his own sword that's going to be cutting his head off he wasn't worried about spouting an intimidation Christian hasn't doesn't have to spout and try to intimidate no you don't have to come out here devil you get out of here now you ain't got to do all that but AB Braham did he is now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ devil you get on out of here the devil know what to listen to huh it's what's down here not the loudness of your voice amen amen and here we go I wonder how far he was brother Joe I wonder how D how far David was from Goliath huh have you ever read in the Old Testament how that so many Stone throwers could hit a rock or something so many Paces long way off they could hit it they were good amen but I believe it was the prophet God had said and I believe you and I know that it wasn't the accuracy of David's ability he might have been good but I've often said I don't care if it slipped out whenever he was slinging about the third time it was going that way go the wrong way it to come around and it sck right in that Giant's head cuz that's God for you it wouldn't have mattered because it's not David's power that he was resting it was God's power that he was resting in amen I'm sure it didn't go that way now I don't say that brother B said it the opposite the way I don't know but I'm just saying if it would have I believe it God have directed it right into the Go's head there goes his sword cuz when you hit it in the brain some kind of reaction you know and all of Israel in the little old fox holes were like it was like an eternity is that kind of did he miss did he miss no they were waiting all of a sudden huh fell David went over there pulled his sword out [Music] wh can I dramatize this a little bit he might just halfway aake shaking you know maybe just a little bit David Gres didn't I tell you I told you I would eyes he's got that big I'm the dead man this last thing he saw was David put his leg up on his shoulder hel his head up come on isra let's go can we say tonight amen just lay out of see a luk war come on go your SW let's fight this devil let's fight these Devils this old formalism you're lukewarmness fight that thing take the sword out of the word let this create such a faith in you amen you'll cut every oh unbelief out get to cut every depression out cut it all out your devil wants you to be depressed downhearted sorrowful no hope oh I wanted to preach on Hope yet that hope is an anchor of the Soul when you've got hope you've got you've got something to live for amen take a prisoner that's Happy in prison he'll sit there and rot but if there's even a slight chance of him escaping he'll figure out how as long as he's got a little bit of Hope let me tell you B says that hope that we have in Christ is the anchor of our soul amen Paul said faith that if hope that is seen is not hope anymore because why would you hope for something that you see but if you don't see it then you have to hope for it amen praise the Lord you love him oh my Let's uh let's go just a little bit here amen we've got 10 more minutes let's go recap on this one scripture here in Romans in Romans let me see what we got left here Romans it's the scripture we read already likewise reckon yourselves to be dead unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof amen but yield your members as instruments of right don't don't neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God Amen Galatians 6 gal 6 is where we'll go next amen once you get to Galatians 6 go back to Hebrews 3 Hebrews 3 because in order to explain that one we need to have Hebrews here and I'm going to I'm going to skip a lot there but we're going to go down to verse six okay seeing therefore it REM remain that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached enter not in because of unbelief again he limited a certain day saying in David today after so long a time after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts for if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterwards have spoken of another day there remain therefore a rest to the people of God now remember where we coming from brother Bram says the whole Christian faith is based upon rest isin that right our faith our life the Christian Life is based upon rest and we're going to kind of look at how we get there because we got to labor to get there amen there remaineth therefore a rest of the people of God for he that is entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his Amen Let Us labor therefore to enter into rest least any man fall after the same example of unbelief now we're going to go back a page in chapter 3 verse 11 verse 10 wherefore I was grieved with that generation said they do always eror in their heart and they have not known my ways man excuse me in verse 8 it says Harden not your hearts as in the Prov Prov provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness amen he remember he speaks about hearing his voice Now understand that coming to rest is about hearing God's voice you understand hearing his voice because you will not have rest without faith ain't that right there's no rest without faith why do you think there is no rest for the people in the world out there you're doing two things you're either resting or running you're in weary oppressed or whatever in allo things or you're resting when your fathers tempted me proved me saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation said they always Ro error in their heart they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath that they shall not enter into my rest take heed bre least there be any of you in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today least any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin amen now we go back all the way across we're going to skip all these other but if you'll notice there he says that when you hear his voice amen heed amen because there is a rest for the people of God labor therefore he says to enter into that rest and the point that I want to make with all of this is that if you have entered into his rest it means that you like God haveed from your own Works Galatians let's look at our works for a few minutes would that be okay I hope everybody doesn't have to get to work too early we won't go too long Galatians 5 and verse 16 amen actually let's go down to the verse 19 we'll skip a little for you now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these what is at the top of the list adultery what did Brother Bram says was the devil's greatest weapon ill-dressed woman wrong dressed woman more people will go to hell preachers and everything else did she puts more people in Hell than all the beer joints in the country a and fornication to top of the list and I looked up the lasciviousness because I didn't know what it was he says it is also immoral all right uncleanness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulation wrath huh you get mad and fuss and fume I mean know that's the works of the flesh is that right Strife amen one place it says where there's envy and strife is there's every evil work wow brother baham so much didn't believe in fussing remember Mr best challenged him to that debate and so forth and he wasn't even gon to go he I I ain't going to no challenge I'm not there we're not here to fuss and bicker no way how many knows Dr best Mr best he was only anointed by the devil to do that in the first place why would a man of God step into a trap of somebody that's anointed by the devil huh yeah he did it and FB Bor asked him if he could go is that right in the middle of that Strife is that right brother ra says yeah you can go and he went and do you uh how many knows how how the argument was one how many questions this is a quiz for you how many questions were asked to put Mr best to silence very good one question the seven compound Redemptive names of Jehovah did it apply to Jesus Jehovah savior Jehovah healer Redeemer he's all of that ain't that right and Mr best wouldn't answer it because he would have thrown his idea out out the door I shake it was it f bosw I believe it was shake his hand and say God bless you for praying real hard and having God In His Infinite Wisdom give you the question to ask that man wasn't it Mr best that had his son or somebody in prison fixing to go be on death row or something brother Brandon went down there and intervened for him after that that's godliness amen so how many knows wrath Strife sedition heresies envyings murderers drunkenness reings of such like of the which I tell you before as I have told you in times past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God Amen so those are the things that you're supposed to be dead to how many believe that dead to ourself amen if you're ever goingon to rest you got to get rid of that old man that guy's got to be dead how am I gonna find out if he's dead brother B says when there's a dead man kicking real good he says when you kick a dead man he don't kick back he doesn't fuss he do he don't even say stop kicking me can you imagine somebody slap a dead man that man will turn you cheek come on back to life what are you trying to do devil slap you upside down one side of the other see if he can revive you he don't want you dead he want you to reviv keep your guard up tomorrow keep your guard up he'll be on his way after a service like tonight he want to find out if you really dead or not how means no matter what circumstances it is amen we got to be like Romans 8 what in the world's going to separate us from the love of God Amen tribulation shall distress shall persecution shall famine nakedness remember what brother bam says neither sickness nor sorrow nor death death nor starvation anything can separate you're resting you let all these things come to the Christian he's resting man that does something for me not even death how many knows when you come to the door of death the doctor say ain't nothing can be done for you we'll find out if you're resting or not we'll find out if you can be disturbed dismayed amen I know brother Donnie he's really going through it right now with his daughter at the point of death doctors want to call on in hospice been having faith and cying and I know I know what it's like to be rung down in the bottom of the bottom down in the inside just really seeking the Lord and Lord if there's anything that I've done anything anything at all Lord he sure wants his daughter to live amen so how many pray for him pray for his daughter amen amen what shall separate of and not famine nakedness Peril sword n all he think we are more than conquerors through him that loved us I am persuaded that not even death not life not Angels not principalities or poers not things present not things to come not height nor depth nor any other creature shall separate us from the love that is in Christ which is in Christ Jesus now notice not only does this represent that Paul that we Christian has a real anchor that nothing will separate him also represents rest amen that all the things that happen to you as a person and the things that we go through amen you're still resting in Christ Paul knew what it was for to have be Shipwrecked to be beaten with rods to be left swn Left for Dead how many remembers Paul talking about man the tribulation Paul had an anger didn't he he had a he had a Road to Damascus experience I mean that's something else the backs out of the desert is called is a road to Damascus experience where he met God and he was never the same since amen he he got he even Jesus even he said I'm going to show you the things that you're going to suffer for me introduce to a meage introduce to a me a Ministry to where you're promised a lot of Trials a lot of things you're going to suffer amen and he uh what did he say he will uh not boast but something like that I forget the can't think of it right now but in my infirmities you know I will glory in my infirmities and all these things that come upon me and so forth that he the only thing he could brag about with all the bad things happen to him but it never shook him did he he kept right steady on Amen amen amen praise the Lord amen well we're going to stop there and Sunday Lord willing we want to speak about I'll tell you Sunday morning amen stand with me stand with me if you will praise the Lord how many loves this series amen I just I've been enjoying myself and I've been like Lord help me amen because these things when as I as I feed on them I just really enjoy them and I know you do amen and so praise the Lord let's bow our heads tonight Search Your Heart ask yourself if you're there are you truly resting I like that song says on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand all other ground is is sinking sand and also the one I shall not be I shall not be moved I shall not be I shall not be moved just like a tree that's planted By the Waters I shall not be moved how many fails and sometimes you let situations and things you let it move you you let it change you you want to say God take that away from me help me Lord whatever comes my way that I could commit it to you and that I could rest God bless those hands Lord my hands are up Lord Lord I never know we never know none of us ever know what's coming our way Lord and sometimes you allow a curveball to come our way something that we're not expecting Lord and we ask God that you would help us not to fail but always to fall on our knees and say God no matter what we're in your hands Lord we're resting in you Lord and we're not living our own life we don't have to threat and to be tossed about a Christian does not have to be that way and that we don't want to be that way we want to rest in you Lord and commit our case even as your Prophet was an example Lord when he would meet witch doctors and all these different ones when he met the maniac Lord that want to threaten him to kill him and spit in his face and everything else but that Prophet just was Rock Solid he just stood there when other preachers were scatting they were running they were getting out of there but he just stood there cuz he knew where he stood Lord and help us to be that way father to know where we stand Lord when things like that or anything like that come our way God that we'd be like a rock and not basted upon that rock and anchored in that rock that we wouldn't be tossed with our emotions and our feelings and all these other things that come along Lord but that we would be mature Christians to serve you lord always commit things to you and trust you in it father we raise our hands Lord in surrenderance to you now thanking you Lord for tonight's service thank you Lord for just speaking our hearts God and coming along the way ministering to us Lord the way that you did Lord I prayed father that Lord I said God I just invite you to come and speak tonight Lord and I believe it's been you father we love you Lord we love your word God and we get in a hurry I know even now myself even Lord Jesus I think about it help me not to be get me away from that Lord father if we spend another little bit extra time lord being here and talking to you God help us to do that father not to be in such a rush Lord you were never in a hurry Lord help us not to be father and just mold now let that atmosphere come down on the congregation now on each one Lord let your Holy Spirit come down and give such a peace and such a rest such forgiveness of our sins and our failures and our transgressions Lord until we would learn Lord to fully trust in you oh Jesus
