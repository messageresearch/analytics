[31:15] i'm really struggling tonight all right
[31:19] praise the lord
[31:20] uh turn your bibles if you will and
[31:22] we'll go to the book of
[31:25] uh over in the book of jude you know
[31:27] i've been talking about the power of
[31:29] light and the power of darkness right
[31:33] amen and that's the only two powers
[31:36] there is according to the prophet of god
[31:37] there's only two powers in this world
[31:39] you're you are
[31:41] powered
[31:43] by one of those
[31:45] your strength comes from one of those
[31:47] amen
[31:49] either the power of the holy ghost
[31:51] or an empty heart is that right
[31:54] that where there is no holy ghost power
[31:57] amen and then all you have is uh your
[32:00] physical power or the devil's power or
[32:03] the power of hate isn't that right
[32:05] amen and so we know that the initial and
[32:08] one of the most main things about
[32:11] uh
[32:12] powers of the evil one is hate and
[32:14] jealousy and so forth
[32:16] amen and the other one is of course love
[32:18] and grace and forgiveness amen
[32:21] amen now we want to look we want to look
[32:24] with the help of the lord those who are
[32:27] and to be honest with you we're going to
[32:29] dwell quite a bit on it and it's going
[32:31] to be on the negative tonight it's going
[32:33] to be on the part of those who are
[32:35] powered
[32:37] and governed by
[32:39] the wrong power which is satan's power
[32:42] amen we want to look tonight at the
[32:44] destination of them for just a minute
[32:47] their destination and so forth and and i
[32:50] like i said i haven't got i may say some
[32:52] things concerning the destination of
[32:54] those who are powered by god but i don't
[32:57] know we'll just see how much time we
[32:59] have and go from there
[33:01] but in jude
[33:03] in jude this is the thought in the
[33:06] scripture that come to me and i meant to
[33:07] read it sunday so this is kind of a
[33:10] continuation off of sunday
[33:12] amen but
[33:14] i will title this the day of vengeance
[33:16] of our lord amen the day of vengeance of
[33:19] our lord
[33:21] amen
[33:22] let's read jude the first chapter and
[33:24] we'll read i guess
[33:27] the first six verses
[33:30] and then i happened to
[33:32] run across another
[33:34] scripture that was very similar to that
[33:37] so we'll read it
[33:39] and you'll notice this is the epistle of
[33:41] jude and we'll see how close
[33:43] jude was to peter when peter talked
[33:46] about
[33:47] the same thing
[33:49] okay jude 1 jude the servant of jesus
[33:52] christ the brother of james to them that
[33:54] are sanctified by god the father and
[33:57] preserved in jesus christ
[34:00] and call mercy unto you in peace and
[34:03] love
[34:04] be multiplied i know he's talking to the
[34:07] elect right
[34:08] the sanctified
[34:10] amen mercy
[34:12] peace
[34:13] and love
[34:14] be multiplied
[34:17] i like that don't you that just plumbs
[34:20] make me feel good
[34:22] to think that you may have mercy how
[34:23] many glad for the mercy of god
[34:25] amen the peace of god
[34:27] the love of god
[34:29] and then multiply it amen i'm glad that
[34:32] it's not just so much but it can be
[34:34] multiplied
[34:36] amen you can get more of
[34:37] i like that praise be to god that's who
[34:39] you like
[34:40] beloved when i gave all diligence to
[34:43] write unto you of the common salvation
[34:45] it was needful for me to write unto you
[34:47] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[34:49] contend for the faith
[34:51] which was once delivered unto the saints
[34:54] amen
[34:56] wow when you think about the kind of
[34:58] faith that they had right
[35:00] amen peter just walking by perceiving
[35:03] that he had faith in hill i perceive
[35:05] that thou art feared to be healed he
[35:06] says in the name of jesus christ civil
[35:08] and silver and gold have i not but such
[35:11] as i have i give unto you and then the
[35:13] jesus name rise up and walk
[35:15] they rose up and walked leap for joy
[35:17] went into the temple and praising god
[35:20] that's the kind of faith they originally
[35:21] had
[35:23] for there are certain men crept in
[35:25] unawares who were before of old ordean
[35:28] to this condemnation now how many knows
[35:30] the church first church had problems
[35:33] with people coming in
[35:35] and twisting things up and messing
[35:37] things up
[35:38] they sure did
[35:40] and then that is just exactly what the
[35:42] devil always does
[35:43] yeah you'll get to see the in a minute
[35:44] just hang on there amen
[35:47] ungodly man turning the grace of our
[35:49] lord into the lasciviousness and denying
[35:51] the only lord god in our lord jesus
[35:53] christ i will therefore put you in
[35:54] remembrance
[35:56] though you once knew this
[35:58] how that the lord having saved the
[36:00] people out of the land of egypt
[36:01] afterward destroyed them that believed
[36:04] not in the angels which kept not their
[36:06] first estate but left their own
[36:08] habitation
[36:10] he had reserved in everlasting chains
[36:12] remember we're talking about darkness
[36:14] now
[36:15] those who served ark just end up here
[36:19] right
[36:21] he has reserved them notice how
[36:24] in the first chapter he says preserved
[36:27] the saints are preserved in jesus christ
[36:30] these are reserved in everlasting chains
[36:33] under darkness
[36:35] amen
[36:38] unto the judgment of the great day even
[36:40] as sodom and gomorrah and the cities
[36:43] about them and like manna giving
[36:44] themselves over to fornication and going
[36:46] after strange flesh are set forth for an
[36:48] example
[36:50] suffering the vengeance of the eternal
[36:52] fire have this begotten
[36:53] to reading of the words you can be
[36:54] seated
[36:56] amen when i read this scripture even
[36:59] suddenly when i read the scriptures that
[37:01] they are reserved and kept
[37:03] in under everlasting chains of darkness
[37:06] amen now we know that
[37:08] to live a life of this darkness is a
[37:12] depressed life it's a terrible place to
[37:14] be to be without god
[37:18] amen to be without the holy ghost to be
[37:21] without peace
[37:23] how many know this is a neurotic age
[37:25] this is a nervous age that we're living
[37:28] in
[37:30] people are nervous
[37:32] you know how many times i listen to the
[37:34] prophet and and people he always says
[37:36] now you're nervous you know all these
[37:38] people that come through they're nervous
[37:39] everybody's nervous
[37:42] you know and there's a lot of reasons
[37:43] why we can be nervous but for one thing
[37:45] it's perhaps something in our conscience
[37:48] a lot of times something lays back in
[37:49] our life just out of the other amen and
[37:52] it's a
[37:53] it's a discomfort to be nervous i don't
[37:55] like to be nervous to you
[37:57] amen but it is something that god has
[38:00] caused this
[38:01] actually almost like a thirst to give us
[38:04] a warning to make us want to draw closer
[38:06] to god
[38:08] all right let's start here
[38:10] and so i thought about under the chains
[38:12] if they're kept there they're under and
[38:14] they can't never get out of that state
[38:17] i don't know about you but whenever
[38:19] you're not
[38:20] if you're nervous if you're upset
[38:21] whatever it might be if you get a little
[38:23] away from god aren't you glad that
[38:24] you're not chained to that
[38:27] you can actually get away from it
[38:33] y'all keep staying your seats don't run
[38:35] up around there you know i don't know
[38:36] about you i'm really glad that we can we
[38:38] can go before the lord
[38:40] amen and you can come out of whatever
[38:42] you want to come out of because these
[38:43] guys are never coming out of it they're
[38:46] stuck there
[38:47] they're never going to come out of it
[38:50] amen
[38:53] first of all let me just say i i like i
[38:55] like the number two i like to preach
[38:58] about the number two two things
[39:00] everything's in twos two
[39:02] hours there's only two powers right and
[39:04] jesus said there's only two masters
[39:07] right
[39:08] only two masters he says you'll either
[39:10] serve one or the other
[39:12] let me say this the one is of course i
[39:15] like i like one better
[39:18] huh i like one better because you don't
[39:19] want to be mixed up and confused about
[39:21] serving two masters just serve one
[39:23] master right
[39:25] that simplifies things
[39:27] now right then if you serve god you
[39:29] ain't got to worry about the devil and
[39:30] all his problems but now the other
[39:32] problem is
[39:34] if you serve the other master
[39:36] the other master
[39:38] you know the the the thing that he does
[39:41] that's so tricky
[39:43] is that he has people
[39:45] that's actually serving him and yet they
[39:48] think they're serving the other master
[39:53] and the prophet saying one of his later
[39:56] sermons he says millions and billions
[39:57] you know are actually serving the devil
[39:59] thinking they're serving god
[40:02] because the devil deceives the whole
[40:04] world the bible says
[40:06] you know he's a very he's a deceiver
[40:08] am right amen so two masters there's two
[40:12] powers
[40:13] amen and there's only
[40:17] two choices
[40:19] a person can make
[40:22] when i think about this every young man
[40:25] every young woman every person
[40:28] every boy and girl
[40:32] every man every woman anybody that's
[40:34] ever born into this world
[40:36] let me tell you something you are born
[40:38] between a rock and a hard place
[40:43] huh you you're you're really born in a
[40:46] fix
[40:48] you really are every human
[40:50] being
[40:52] you are born in a fix because first of
[40:54] all
[40:56] god created you to be a human being
[41:00] and with that being a human being you
[41:01] have the power to reason
[41:04] to think
[41:05] to make choices
[41:07] huh
[41:09] and with the fact that you're a human
[41:12] being
[41:13] comes a huge responsibility
[41:18] huh
[41:23] because
[41:25] of the fact
[41:26] that you have a soul
[41:29] right
[41:30] and that soul is gonna
[41:33] end up somewhere
[41:36] huh
[41:38] and another two that i like is there's
[41:40] either heaven
[41:42] or hell
[41:44] god has no purgatory
[41:47] right there's no somewhere else even
[41:50] though
[41:50] human beings and americans and our
[41:52] politicians and our school teachers and
[41:55] our college
[41:57] professors
[41:59] might try to teach you different
[42:02] do you think that when you die that's
[42:04] gonna be it just because you believe
[42:07] that's gonna be it
[42:13] no of course not
[42:16] you know
[42:17] the only way that you'll get anything
[42:19] accurate and know for sure is this right
[42:21] here
[42:22] this here don't care what you believe
[42:25] you have to believe this or you're wrong
[42:28] period amen
[42:31] what i really like about it is the fact
[42:33] that god came in our generation and he
[42:35] showed us without question that he's
[42:38] real
[42:40] huh
[42:42] we don't have to wonder anymore if god
[42:43] is real because he came and he had his
[42:45] picture taken with his prophet
[42:49] i mean god had his picture taken with
[42:51] the prophet would you like to see it
[42:55] there it is
[42:58] right there
[43:02] that's right
[43:03] you all know the story and i'm not going
[43:04] to get into it but god actually took his
[43:06] own even even if
[43:08] the fbi and and and uh i don't know just
[43:12] the the the one that inspects things
[43:14] like that
[43:16] and checks things out he says it's the
[43:18] only supernatural picture that was ever
[43:20] taken
[43:21] right
[43:23] he even verified
[43:24] it which i don't care if he did or not
[43:28] it's i still believe it
[43:31] folks there's people that spoke against
[43:33] that and died and got terrible things
[43:35] happened to him
[43:36] there's people that says i believe that
[43:38] and got healed right away
[43:41] huh
[43:44] so
[43:45] a responsibility i like this because you
[43:48] have to make a choice now when i think
[43:51] about this the choice that you make
[43:54] determines your destination
[43:56] where are you going to come out at and
[43:58] in this world you have to make that
[43:59] choice that's why i say a rock and a
[44:01] heart base is because you
[44:04] absolutely have to make that choice
[44:10] you can actually choose not to choose
[44:13] and you chose
[44:17] that's right if you choose not to choose
[44:20] and ignore it you chose to ignore it
[44:23] and you made the wrong choice and you'll
[44:25] end up in hell
[44:29] so you see how it is
[44:31] how sincere how
[44:33] yes sincere it is
[44:35] that you can't just not choose and not
[44:37] end up
[44:38] somewhere in between no you're going to
[44:40] end up somewhere
[44:41] and if you think you're not going to
[44:42] make a choice you're making a choice
[44:45] and ultimately if you don't choose
[44:47] christ you're choosing not to choose
[44:49] christ isn't that right and that is your
[44:51] choice
[44:52] so there is no getting out of it
[44:55] let me just
[44:56] read it to the way that the prophet said
[44:58] it in respects
[44:59] he says you can only do two things
[45:02] and it lays either mercy
[45:05] or judgment
[45:08] right
[45:10] you have to accept one or the other and
[45:12] there's where we stand tonight we either
[45:15] take god's mercy or we stand his
[45:18] judgment there's just no way of getting
[45:21] around it
[45:23] amen
[45:25] absolutely no way to get around it
[45:30] god always oh this is the good part god
[45:32] makes a way of escape for those who
[45:34] desire escape
[45:37] and then if you don't take that escape
[45:39] route you're going to be caught
[45:43] in the judgment that's coming
[45:46] now i believe the prophet taught us he
[45:48] says that the number one way
[45:50] that you can know that judgment is on
[45:53] its way
[45:54] is when god sends a prophet
[45:57] because god always there's every single
[45:59] time after prophet comes judgments
[46:01] follows it
[46:03] because people make their choice
[46:05] about what that prophet said
[46:07] amen
[46:08] they make their choice about what that
[46:10] prophet said
[46:11] and you have to you have to choose god's
[46:14] mercy and his grace
[46:18] or you have to
[46:20] stand his judgment
[46:22] amen
[46:23] stand the wrath that comes with
[46:27] there is no way of escape
[46:30] man
[46:31] don't you just wish everybody up in our
[46:33] white house would hear that tonight
[46:36] you will not escape you think you might
[46:38] but the day will come
[46:40] when you will absolutely have to face it
[46:44] huh
[46:45] god raised a prophet right out of the
[46:48] united states of america
[46:51] possibly the greatest prophet ever lived
[46:54] hello possibly the greatest ever
[46:57] because he got to go for 30 some odd
[46:59] years go around the world
[47:02] and around the world seven times i
[47:04] believe it was and preach the gospel
[47:06] and demonstrate the power of god like no
[47:08] other time
[47:10] because i don't know any time i i don't
[47:12] really don't know any time that a
[47:13] prophet went you all universal like that
[47:17] all over the world that many times to
[47:19] prove to the world god's real
[47:21] on your tapes
[47:23] that's right and all of our
[47:26] leaders and everybody those tapes will
[47:28] be played back on the day of judgment
[47:30] because brother bam says this message
[47:32] these messages will meet this generation
[47:34] into judgment
[47:36] because it wasn't the power of brother
[47:37] madam to do nothing
[47:39] amen
[47:40] i thought the other day i thought how
[47:41] nice it would have been to be able to be
[47:43] there and listen or record jesus talking
[47:46] about the wolf with the woman at the
[47:48] well and saying you're sad right y'all
[47:50] have that no uh you've got no husband
[47:52] because you've had five no one you're
[47:53] without eight
[47:54] do you deserve their thoughts and i
[47:56] actually have that in record wouldn't be
[47:57] glad to say you see that but yet we've
[47:59] got that very same thing
[48:01] in recordings time and time and time and
[48:04] time and time and again
[48:06] amen
[48:07] very same thing
[48:10] my my my
[48:14] oh my
[48:15] for the people that desirable ways
[48:17] what's left over has to stand in other
[48:20] words if you don't choose his grace and
[48:22] his mercy
[48:23] him dying on the cross for you and and
[48:25] paying for your sins
[48:27] if you don't choose
[48:29] freedom if you don't choose to be free
[48:32] from that if you don't choose to have
[48:34] realize that your sin was paid right
[48:37] there
[48:38] and when you accept him your sin
[48:41] everything you've ever done it gets paid
[48:44] for
[48:45] isn't it nice
[48:48] in other words he picked up the tab he
[48:50] died for the sins of the whole world
[48:53] everything from cain all the way to the
[48:55] last sin that had ever sinned he paid
[48:57] for every bit of it
[49:00] let me believe that
[49:02] amen and if you don't accept the payment
[49:04] then he's going to ask for you to pay
[49:06] for your sin
[49:08] because you have to pay for your sin sin
[49:11] has to be paid for
[49:15] not not even the smallest little bitty
[49:18] bitty bitty sin that anybody in the
[49:21] history of the world ever
[49:23] will go unpaid god's not going to miss
[49:26] any of it
[49:28] huh
[49:30] because what was it jesus said he said
[49:32] there's the things that are done in
[49:33] darkness will be brought the light
[49:35] there's nothing here that will not be
[49:36] revealed absolutely nothing
[49:40] because he's god
[49:42] amen
[49:44] so i'm happy tonight brother aren't you
[49:46] happy to know that christ has come and
[49:48] done the work in your life
[49:51] me tell you something that peace that
[49:52] you feel in your heart
[49:54] the joy that you have that feeling that
[49:56] knowing that you're right with god
[49:59] that's priceless
[50:01] there's nothing like it in the world
[50:06] i would rather be like job sitting on
[50:08] the ash eating boils and miserable
[50:11] miserable
[50:12] wishing i could die
[50:15] and still have that feeling
[50:18] than to be the king of the world and
[50:19] have all pleasures of the world at my
[50:21] disposal and not be right with god
[50:25] i would rather be that wouldn't you
[50:28] can and be right with god
[50:31] all right
[50:32] let's read
[50:34] now notice if you'll notice when it
[50:36] comes to judgment
[50:38] notice how that god's not forgetting
[50:39] anything
[50:41] all right
[50:41] here in the new testament it goes all
[50:43] the way back to
[50:45] i will put you in remembrance huh
[50:49] i remember over revelations remember i
[50:51] have remembered her iniquities i
[50:53] remembered her sins
[50:56] and i have come to pay
[50:58] i mean those
[50:59] vengeance is mine says the lord i will
[51:02] repay
[51:04] hear the bible's remembering the
[51:06] israelites having escaped
[51:08] save the people out of land of egypt
[51:10] afterwards destroyed them that believed
[51:12] not so now notice how many know that
[51:14] those people are kept in store then he
[51:17] goes from there to the angels which kept
[51:19] not their first estate even the angels
[51:23] am i right they're kept in store god has
[51:26] reserved them they're under the chains
[51:28] of darkness they're in a lost condition
[51:30] somewhere
[51:32] reserved for judgment day
[51:36] [Music]
[51:38] my oh my folks
[51:42] and then it mentions even as sodom and
[51:44] gomorrah
[51:45] how many
[51:46] no no folks
[51:48] the sodomites and the gomorrahites they
[51:50] were not forgiven
[51:52] or it wouldn't be in there
[51:54] just like abraham and his faults aren't
[51:56] found in the new testament huh
[52:00] but even sodom and gomor there remember
[52:02] there's nobody going to escape
[52:08] amen
[52:12] and it even talks about michael the
[52:13] archangel having respect
[52:16] when he's contending with the devil
[52:19] he disputed about the body of moses
[52:21] burst not bringing against him any
[52:23] railing accusation but said the lord
[52:24] rebuked big
[52:26] amen
[52:28] angels watched your mouth when speaking
[52:30] to the devil
[52:35] did i read it wrong
[52:37] michael the archangel when contending
[52:39] with the devil he disputed about the
[52:41] body of moses
[52:43] semi-railing accusation but she said
[52:45] lord rebuke you
[52:46] huh
[52:48] but these speak evil of things they know
[52:50] not in other words you read the rest of
[52:52] it i'm not going to go through all of
[52:53] that but it talks about man people are
[52:55] so
[52:57] quick to run their mouths
[53:00] huh
[53:03] you got to be careful about what you say
[53:06] about god
[53:08] god knows who god sends
[53:11] about god's
[53:12] children amen
[53:16] because they're there's a recompense for
[53:18] it
[53:21] amen
[53:23] there's a recompense
[53:25] for everything that you do
[53:32] it even mentions in verse 11 of jude woe
[53:34] unto them for they have gone after the
[53:36] way of all the way back to
[53:39] cain is even mentioned here there's
[53:41] cain's not forgotten
[53:43] cocaine is under that bond of darkness
[53:45] waiting for his judgment
[53:47] i mean how's that he's waiting for his
[53:49] judgment he's been waiting there for six
[53:51] thousand years
[53:57] all right and then he talked greedily
[53:59] after the heir of balaam
[54:02] huh
[54:04] perished in the game saying of kara
[54:08] when i was even kora
[54:10] and all of them were swallowed up in the
[54:11] earth
[54:12] sure their bodies are dead but their
[54:14] souls are somewhere
[54:16] bound
[54:17] they're somewhere waiting for
[54:20] the judgment
[54:21] because why they made the wrong choice
[54:25] they made the wrong korah made the wrong
[54:28] choice cain made the wrong choice
[54:33] amen
[54:36] and before i go back to peter and come
[54:38] in
[54:38] paralleling what he said let's go to
[54:40] verse 14 of jude
[54:43] well let's go to verse 13 raging waves
[54:46] of the siege foaming out their own shame
[54:49] wandering stars to whom is reserved
[54:53] the blackness of darkness forever
[54:58] my that is a terrible place to be
[55:01] i believe probably god says you can't
[55:02] imagine how bad hell is
[55:05] how bad it is you can't even imagine it
[55:09] one place he says a literal burning fire
[55:12] would be a pleasure comparative what it
[55:14] really is like
[55:17] it's horrible it's terrible place
[55:19] remember when he went there when he
[55:20] wasn't saved and he got any and he was
[55:23] dying and so forth he went beyond the
[55:25] curtain he was falling and falling and
[55:27] falling and falling
[55:29] it was a terrible
[55:32] moment there's no mom
[55:35] that
[55:36] no dad god he said he yelled god there
[55:40] was no god
[55:43] there was no hope
[55:45] going
[55:47] huh
[55:49] that's right he said he's been to both
[55:51] places he says whatever you do don't you
[55:54] take that downward road
[55:56] amen
[55:58] because there he said he's been at the
[55:59] other place and he says there is no
[56:01] words to describe
[56:03] how beautiful it is
[56:05] amen even paul said i has not seen ear
[56:08] heard
[56:09] amen the things that god has prepared
[56:10] for them to love it amen
[56:13] we can't even imagine
[56:16] you uh
[56:18] i like that song you can only imagine i
[56:20] can only imagine
[56:22] i like to imagine
[56:23] amen
[56:28] amen
[56:29] beautiful
[56:31] because everything here is just a
[56:32] negative isn't it
[56:34] remember this let's remember this here
[56:37] and out there
[56:38] that this is only a
[56:40] well there's so many different words to
[56:42] describe what this world is really like
[56:44] but you got about 70 years
[56:46] where god tests you tries you improves
[56:48] you and molds you and shapes you and
[56:50] teaches you and sends you to school and
[56:52] all the things that he does to get you
[56:54] ready
[56:55] for what's over there that's all this is
[56:56] here just a temporary place
[56:59] amen why in the world would we want to
[57:01] make the right choice
[57:03] why wouldn't people choose god and
[57:04] eternal life
[57:06] amen
[57:07] let's go
[57:08] to whom is reserved the blackness of
[57:10] darkness forever and enoch hello and i
[57:13] mentioned enoch all the way in genesis
[57:15] also the seventh from
[57:17] adam prophesied of these sayings behold
[57:20] the lord cometh
[57:23] with ten thousands of his saints
[57:27] to execute judgment upon all
[57:32] not just some
[57:34] not the
[57:35] not the slightest person will be missing
[57:38] on that day
[57:39] amen
[57:42] to bring execute judgment upon all and
[57:45] to convince all that are ungodly hello
[57:50] driven by that dark force
[57:52] among them
[57:56] of all their ungodly deeds which they
[57:59] have ungodly committed and of all their
[58:04] big fat mouths hard speeches
[58:08] isn't that what we're experiencing today
[58:11] people that are just
[58:12] against god will just say anything
[58:14] against god
[58:16] they're not afraid to say anything
[58:18] they're hard speeches which ungodly
[58:21] sinners have spoken against him and of
[58:24] course it says these are murmurs and
[58:25] complainers and walking after their own
[58:27] lusts
[58:28] and their mouths speaking great swelling
[58:30] words having men's admiration in person
[58:32] and that you know because of an
[58:33] advantage
[58:35] amen
[58:36] all right
[58:38] now let's look at peter and how he put
[58:40] it
[58:41] in ii peter 2 if you want to go with me
[58:45] we'll see how that peter
[58:47] they must have had pretty close to the
[58:48] same revelation revelation
[58:56] we'll go down to verse
[59:00] 11 i mean some of these words are just
[59:03] so close to the others it's something
[59:05] else
[59:06] let's begin with verse 1. but there were
[59:08] false prophets also among the people
[59:11] even as there shall be false teachers
[59:13] among you who privately shall bring in
[59:16] them the heresies even denying the lord
[59:19] that brought that bought them and bring
[59:21] upon themselves swift destruction
[59:23] and many shall follow their pernicious
[59:25] ways by reason of whom the way of the
[59:27] truth shall be evil spoken of and
[59:30] through covetousness shall withday with
[59:32] framed words is that right make
[59:34] merchandise of you
[59:36] whose judgment now for a long time
[59:39] lingereth not and their damnation
[59:42] slumbereth not for if god spared not the
[59:45] angels that sinned amen
[59:48] but cast them down to hell
[59:51] and delivered them into chains of
[59:54] darkness
[59:56] jude said chains under darkness peter
[59:59] said chains of darkness
[1:00:03] trapped there
[1:00:05] can't get out
[1:00:06] held by chain of circumstance amen
[1:00:10] to be reserved
[1:00:13] unto judgment
[1:00:15] amen
[1:00:16] do you see the destination of
[1:00:19] the ungodly
[1:00:21] that's their destination
[1:00:22] when they leave this world
[1:00:25] to be in a condition that they cannot
[1:00:27] get out of
[1:00:29] anybody that listens to the catholic
[1:00:31] priests

[1:01:15] it's not over there anymore amen
[1:01:19] to be reserved unto judgment and spare
[1:01:22] not the old world talking about the days
[1:01:24] of noah isn't that right
[1:01:26] but saved noah the eighth person a
[1:01:29] preacher of righteousness bringing in
[1:01:30] the flood upon the world of the ungodly
[1:01:32] how many know that every last one of
[1:01:34] those folks that died in the flood
[1:01:37] they're all reserved in chains of
[1:01:39] darkness
[1:01:41] they're still waiting there
[1:01:44] we understand that it's all the way from
[1:01:46] cain all the way from the person that
[1:01:49] died three minutes ago that went to the
[1:01:51] region of lost they're under chains of
[1:01:53] darkness
[1:01:54] amen
[1:01:56] they're not dead
[1:01:58] they're alive over there
[1:02:01] amen
[1:02:02] in a lost world that's right
[1:02:05] then he talks about turning the cities
[1:02:07] of sodom and gomorrah
[1:02:09] into ashes right condemn them with an
[1:02:13] overthrow making them an example
[1:02:15] unto those that afterwards should live
[1:02:18] ungodly hello
[1:02:20] world
[1:02:22] sodom and gomorrah
[1:02:24] that's right god overthrew them made you
[1:02:27] and made an example
[1:02:29] and you have to close your ear
[1:02:32] you have to turn your head and and
[1:02:35] ignore the example that god gives
[1:02:39] just to end up
[1:02:40] being in a place
[1:02:42] where they are
[1:02:44] and saying i should have listened
[1:02:46] amen
[1:02:49] but delivered just lot vexed with the
[1:02:51] filthy conversation of the wicked
[1:02:55] verse 9 the lord knoweth how to deliver
[1:02:58] the godly out of temptations
[1:03:00] amen aren't you glad for that and to
[1:03:03] reserve the unjust
[1:03:05] how to reserve the unjust unto the day
[1:03:08] of judgment to be punished
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:14] my my my
[1:03:17] you ask me why i'm happy
[1:03:19] because my sins are gone
[1:03:21] they're underneath the blood on the
[1:03:23] cross of calvary this fire removed this
[1:03:25] darkness is from dawn
[1:03:27] aren't you glad that there's no
[1:03:29] condemnation to them that are in christ
[1:03:32] there's no judgment to those that are in
[1:03:35] christ jesus
[1:03:36] the bible said don't you know that the
[1:03:38] saint shall judge the world
[1:03:41] amen and he comes with ten thousands of
[1:03:44] his saints
[1:03:45] to execute judgment
[1:03:47] upon all
[1:03:49] amen so we see
[1:03:51] brother insisted the destination
[1:03:54] the destination
[1:03:56] of course ends up
[1:03:58] in the white throne judgment how many
[1:04:00] knows that after the thousand years are
[1:04:01] expired according to revelations there
[1:04:04] after a thousand years even for another
[1:04:06] thousand years it's been 2000 years
[1:04:08] uh even since the time of christ since
[1:04:11] cain has supposedly been around 6 000
[1:04:13] years
[1:04:15] so they're going to have to wait a very
[1:04:17] very
[1:04:18] long time
[1:04:20] before their judgment every becomes
[1:04:22] amen
[1:04:27] now let's talk about
[1:04:29] the day of the lord
[1:04:31] being the day of vengeance
[1:04:33] now we know that whenever
[1:04:35] the holy spirit lifts
[1:04:37] the bride
[1:04:38] amen up off the church i mean up off the
[1:04:42] earth
[1:04:43] when we'll be changed in the moment in
[1:04:45] the twinkling of an eye at the last
[1:04:47] trump the trump of god shall sound the
[1:04:49] dead in christ shall rise first and we
[1:04:50] which are our lives and remain shall be
[1:04:52] caught up to meet the lord in the air
[1:04:55] but that coming of the lord and that
[1:04:57] coming of the lord is as a thief in the
[1:04:59] night
[1:05:01] the thief in the night comes and he goes
[1:05:03] and you don't know till morning until
[1:05:05] you know that you've been broken into
[1:05:06] have been robbed
[1:05:07] he's done come and gone that's how it's
[1:05:09] going to be for this world for the
[1:05:11] coming of the rapture coming of the lord
[1:05:15] now when he comes back with his saints
[1:05:16] it's going to be a different story
[1:05:18] it comes upon white horses under the
[1:05:20] sixth seal
[1:05:21] to the battle of armageddon and we come
[1:05:23] down there and destroy the place and
[1:05:25] take over amen
[1:05:27] that'll be the ultimate end
[1:05:31] amen the ultimate end but it's also how
[1:05:33] many knows the tribulation trade is also
[1:05:35] called judgment day
[1:05:38] the day of judgment it's also called the
[1:05:40] day of vengeance according to isaiah 61
[1:05:43] i believe it is
[1:05:45] amen
[1:05:46] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[1:05:48] lord and the day of vengeance of our god
[1:05:51] amen
[1:05:52] two things and we're living the day
[1:05:55] right at the edge
[1:05:57] of the day
[1:05:58] of the vengeance of god
[1:06:01] amen
[1:06:06] folks i'm here to tell you
[1:06:08] the world does not realize what it has
[1:06:11] in store for them
[1:06:14] remember our prophet saw this vision and
[1:06:16] he said this about he says before us
[1:06:19] lays
[1:06:20] the most horrible
[1:06:22] time
[1:06:24] for the unbeliever
[1:06:26] the most horrible time
[1:06:29] and i want to read it to you
[1:06:31] but
[1:06:32] the scripture talks about how that when
[1:06:34] they'll realize
[1:06:37] and have to admit that god is no matter
[1:06:39] how much eight years they are they're
[1:06:41] gonna realize that they're facing god
[1:06:44] and it's going to do something to their
[1:06:46] hearts
[1:06:47] huh
[1:06:50] because i'm here today this earth is
[1:06:52] going to shake it's going to we enjoy
[1:06:54] having a good solid floor don't we
[1:06:56] but folks when we're going here
[1:06:58] this whole world is going to shake
[1:07:01] amen
[1:07:04] because when like like i said when that
[1:07:05] when that blood of jesus christ leaves
[1:07:08] and there's a ring from what i
[1:07:10] understand the prophet said there's a
[1:07:11] ring
[1:07:12] a circling the earth called the blood of
[1:07:15] jesus christ
[1:07:16] isn't that right and this is called
[1:07:18] man's day man's day is the day when you
[1:07:21] get to choose
[1:07:22] which way you're going to go this is
[1:07:24] man's day as the prophet of god said
[1:07:26] man's day is when when people will man
[1:07:29] will do whatever they kind of want to
[1:07:31] with you
[1:07:32] they'll push you around and so forth the
[1:07:34] prophet said and the bible talks about
[1:07:36] it he says you know he says don't be
[1:07:37] afraid of them that can kill your body
[1:07:39] because jesus knew it was going to
[1:07:40] happen i mean as all the disciples got
[1:07:43] killed paul got his head cut off the
[1:07:45] only one that didn't he died of a
[1:07:47] natural death with john the revelator
[1:07:49] right that john's the only one died of
[1:07:50] natural day everybody else got killed
[1:07:52] and then the christians down through the
[1:07:54] dark ages if you remember
[1:07:56] remember jesus said that you can't give
[1:07:58] a cup of cold water to one of mine
[1:08:00] unless i give you a reward
[1:08:03] amen
[1:08:05] and he says you know and if you offend
[1:08:07] one of my children if you offend one of
[1:08:09] my children it'd be better for a
[1:08:11] millstone but be hanged about your neck
[1:08:14] and for you to be cast into the depth of
[1:08:16] the sea
[1:08:22] this doesn't that sound just a little
[1:08:24] extreme for offending one of them
[1:08:28] that's a pretty extreme punishment for
[1:08:30] offending one of god's children
[1:08:33] god don't take it too kindly
[1:08:38] amen
[1:08:39] talk about man say like i said i'm gonna
[1:08:41] jump around a little bit this morning
[1:08:43] this evening i don't know just how far i
[1:08:44] get but i want to talk about this a
[1:08:46] little bit first of all
[1:08:47] because when we talk about
[1:08:49] those who are powered by the eve of them
[1:08:51] remember they're the ones that want to
[1:08:53] kill you
[1:08:54] they're the ones that hate you
[1:08:57] amen
[1:09:00] they're
[1:09:01] powered by the devil
[1:09:03] and
[1:09:04] jesus said told us what turn the other
[1:09:06] cheek
[1:09:07] go the extra mile
[1:09:09] when somebody's bad to you don't you
[1:09:11] know persecute you pray for those pray
[1:09:13] for them love them why because we're
[1:09:15] powered by god's power not satan's power
[1:09:18] amen
[1:09:20] and paul put it this way let me just
[1:09:22] read what paul said
[1:09:24] you said the same thing peter peter did
[1:09:26] over in first peter second chapter he
[1:09:29] talks about you know
[1:09:31] suffering wrongfully and so forth how
[1:09:33] that there's a reward that comes with it
[1:09:36] and here paul is saying in the 12th
[1:09:38] chapter of romans verse
[1:09:40] 13 distributing to the necessity of the
[1:09:42] saints given the hospitality bless them
[1:09:44] that persecute you
[1:09:46] bless and curse not rejoice with them
[1:09:48] that do rejoice and weep with them that
[1:09:50] we be of the same mind one to another
[1:09:54] mind not high things condescend men of
[1:09:56] low estate be not wise in your own
[1:09:58] conceits and recommends recompense
[1:10:01] recompense no man
[1:10:03] evil or evil
[1:10:07] amen
[1:10:08] provide things honest in the sight of
[1:10:10] men and if all possible as much as life
[1:10:13] in you live peaceably with all men
[1:10:17] i mean those christians are peace lovers
[1:10:20] they love peace amen
[1:10:23] we will go to war
[1:10:25] to make peace
[1:10:29] that's right we will go to war to the
[1:10:31] devil to try to make sure you get to
[1:10:32] peace
[1:10:33] that's why paul would go and he would
[1:10:35] preach the gospel and man there'd be
[1:10:37] such an uproar
[1:10:39] who's made this upper paul's made this
[1:10:41] uproar yeah he made some uproars trying
[1:10:43] to get everybody to come to peace
[1:10:46] right
[1:10:47] that's right
[1:10:48] because we love peace we don't want
[1:10:50] anybody to be not to have the peace of
[1:10:51] god
[1:10:52] amen live peaceably with all men dearly
[1:10:55] beloved avenge not yourselves
[1:10:58] but rather give place unto wrath for it
[1:11:00] is written vengeance is mine
[1:11:04] i
[1:11:05] will repay saith the lord
[1:11:08] [Music]
[1:11:10] how many knows that
[1:11:12] all those christians that died all down
[1:11:15] through the dark ages the popes the
[1:11:17] priests
[1:11:18] everybody that betrayed them because
[1:11:20] jesus said brother's gonna betray
[1:11:22] brother and and and son's gonna be
[1:11:25] trained father father's gonna betray son
[1:11:27] to demon to death
[1:11:29] huh
[1:11:32] but when you got your sins forgiven
[1:11:34] remember every one of those will be
[1:11:36] having to stand to judgment
[1:11:38] for what they have done
[1:11:41] on the day of judgment
[1:11:43] nobody's getting away with anything
[1:11:45] one place jesus said
[1:11:48] um
[1:11:49] let me think here
[1:11:52] well i've said it already talk about
[1:11:54] don't worry about those that they
[1:11:55] destroy your flesh but
[1:11:58] fear him that can destroy both body
[1:12:01] and soul
[1:12:02] in hell
[1:12:05] and from what i understand
[1:12:07] every sinner doesn't have a theophany
[1:12:11] so their body is called back
[1:12:13] everybody's called back and they're
[1:12:15] judged in the body that they send it
[1:12:18] wow and then both of them are
[1:12:20] destroyed
[1:12:22] you know i might just say this that
[1:12:23] people
[1:12:25] want to think that when you die you're
[1:12:27] just annihilated
[1:12:29] that's it
[1:12:31] like another place
[1:12:32] besides heaven or hell
[1:12:35] well i do believe in the alliation don't
[1:12:37] you
[1:12:39] i believe in annihilation
[1:12:43] but it's when you've paid
[1:12:45] for the last sin that you have done
[1:12:48] in hell when you pay for the last one
[1:12:51] brother bram says you'll become extinct
[1:12:54] because hell is not eternal your soul is
[1:12:56] not eternal you don't burn
[1:12:58] eternally that's right
[1:13:00] you eventually come to
[1:13:03] nothing
[1:13:05] but it isn't before the judgment not
[1:13:07] before paying amen
[1:13:09] so no matter how much people try to get
[1:13:11] out of that
[1:13:12] they're not going to
[1:13:14] amen
[1:13:15] so vengeance is mine saith the lord i
[1:13:18] will repay and we know that so many
[1:13:20] offenses have come
[1:13:22] amen through people through individuals
[1:13:25] down through the ages
[1:13:26] [Applause]
[1:13:28] and every one of them
[1:13:29] has to pay for those
[1:13:31] vengeance is mine i will prepay say of
[1:13:33] the lord therefore if thine enemy hunger
[1:13:36] feed him if he thirsts give him greed
[1:13:40] for in so doing thou shalt he calls a
[1:13:42] fire
[1:13:43] upon his head praise the lord
[1:13:47] amen when you know that god's going to
[1:13:48] take care of your stuff
[1:13:50] he's going to take care of your problem
[1:13:51] he's going to take care of anybody that
[1:13:53] does you wrong you can afford to be nice
[1:13:57] see i ain't going to die you got to hit
[1:14:01] i ain't got to let that little
[1:14:02] bitterness come in my heart i just let
[1:14:03] it go lord
[1:14:05] you deal with it
[1:14:07] amen
[1:14:08] because he said he will repay
[1:14:11] you pray for him don't you you pray for
[1:14:13] mercy you pray for grace god forgive him
[1:14:16] it's not that you want him to pay it's
[1:14:17] not that you want him to do that no if
[1:14:19] your heart got in your heart right you
[1:14:21] do like like stephen and like jesus
[1:14:23] himself don't lay it on their charge
[1:14:27] amen
[1:14:29] why
[1:14:30] because you realize that if god held the
[1:14:32] sins against you that you've done you
[1:14:34] wouldn't have a chance either
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:38] that's right
[1:14:39] that's where jesus said you know if you
[1:14:41] don't forgive others god's not gonna
[1:14:43] give forgive you
[1:14:45] another place he talked about you know
[1:14:46] there was two two people that owned
[1:14:48] somebody money
[1:14:50] and the one that owed the guy a whole
[1:14:52] bunch the guy forgave him for the whole
[1:14:53] bunch
[1:14:55] and then that guy
[1:14:56] the little the other person owed this
[1:14:58] guy
[1:14:59] money right
[1:15:02] and man he threw him in jail
[1:15:05] he didn't forgive him for nothing
[1:15:07] and the first man that he owed the one
[1:15:09] guy owner a lot
[1:15:11] amen
[1:15:12] he says look
[1:15:14] shouldn't you have forgiven him amen
[1:15:17] that's the way that's the world we're
[1:15:18] living in i mean should we forgive
[1:15:19] everybody
[1:15:21] because really when you think about it
[1:15:22] you've done terrible things
[1:15:25] amen you owe a whole lot you can afford
[1:15:27] to forgive somebody
[1:15:29] amen
[1:15:30] and then it says he calls a fire on his
[1:15:33] head be not overcome by evil
[1:15:36] but overcome evil with good
[1:15:41] turn to isaiah with me
[1:15:44] isaiah 1 and we'll begin to look at
[1:15:49] the day of judgment that comes upon the
[1:15:51] earth after the holy spirit is lifted
[1:15:54] and god's wrath comes down upon man now
[1:15:56] this is
[1:15:58] i want you to
[1:16:00] look at this scripture
[1:16:03] and
[1:16:04] see the parallel between isaiah and
[1:16:06] revelation the book of revelations
[1:16:09] enter
[1:16:10] into the rock
[1:16:13] and hide thee
[1:16:14] i'm sorry didn't tell you where did i
[1:16:18] sorry
[1:16:19] isaiah 2.
[1:16:21] i said it to you been looking for a
[1:16:23] while
[1:16:25] and verse 10. all right we got it
[1:16:30] enter into the rock
[1:16:32] and high being the dust
[1:16:36] for fear of the lord
[1:16:38] and for the glory of his majesty
[1:16:42] folks i'm here to tell you when he gets
[1:16:44] up when he begins to rock this world
[1:16:46] people are going to be in awe they're
[1:16:48] going to be in shock
[1:16:55] the law of demand looks of man shall be
[1:16:57] humbled
[1:16:58] and the heartiness of men shall be bowed
[1:17:01] down and the lord alone shall be exalted
[1:17:04] in that day for the day of the lord now
[1:17:06] notice there we're talking about the day
[1:17:08] of the lord this is man's day man's day
[1:17:10] they kind of do whatever they want
[1:17:12] but god's day
[1:17:13] is coming
[1:17:15] amen
[1:17:16] god's going to have his day
[1:17:25] i i don't know can i just say what comes
[1:17:27] to my crazy mind
[1:17:29] it reminds me of a two fighters right
[1:17:32] and this one fighters just beating the
[1:17:34] other guy just all the pieces and just
[1:17:36] beating him knocking him down and
[1:17:37] beating him all over
[1:17:39] huh
[1:17:41] and the guy's perhaps just taking it
[1:17:43] just taking it just taking it just
[1:17:44] taking it
[1:17:46] but what's going to happen when he can
[1:17:48] take all that when he started dishing it

[1:19:58] in the days of noah

[1:21:33] idols of silver and his idols of gold
[1:21:36] which to have made each other for
[1:21:37] themselves to worship to the moles and
[1:21:39] to the bats
[1:21:41] and to go into the clefts of the rock
[1:21:43] into the tops of the ragged rocks
[1:21:45] for fear of the lord and for the glory
[1:21:48] of his majesty when he arises
[1:21:51] again he says it to shake terribly
[1:21:54] the earth

[1:22:01] verse 6.

[1:22:17] it shall come as a destruction
[1:22:20] from the almighty
[1:22:21] therefore shall all hands be faint and

[1:22:36] that travaileth and they shall be amazed
[1:22:38] at one another and their faces shall be
[1:22:41] as flames

[1:23:06] you had your day
[1:23:08] now it's my day
[1:23:10] and it's gonna be a day of wrath
[1:23:12] therefore will i shake the heavens
[1:23:16] and the earth shall remove out of her
[1:23:18] place
[1:23:19] in the wrath of the lord of hosts
[1:23:22] and in the day of his fierce
[1:23:26] anger
[1:23:27] wow
[1:23:28] go to revelations
[1:23:34] revelation six
[1:23:36] and this is under the sixth seal we know
[1:23:38] all the way up to the
[1:23:40] the fourth seal verse eight six
[1:23:44] revelation six and verse eight will
[1:23:45] begin
[1:23:46] and i looked and behold a pale horse
[1:23:48] remember that's the last horse
[1:23:51] and his name that sat on him was death
[1:23:53] and hell followed him fellow with him
[1:23:55] and power was given unto him over the
[1:23:57] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[1:23:58] the sword and with hunger and with death
[1:24:00] and with the beasts of the earth we've
[1:24:02] seen that down through the dark ages now
[1:24:05] he knows what the fifth seal is
[1:24:06] according to probably god the fifth seal
[1:24:08] was the souls of those uh that were hit
[1:24:11] uh killed by eichmann and two different
[1:24:13] ones all of that was so those souls
[1:24:16] that were under the altar crying how
[1:24:18] long o lord until you avenge our blood
[1:24:23] amen
[1:24:27] all right that was the fifth seal was
[1:24:30] them
[1:24:31] but now we know that the bride's
[1:24:32] supposed to be gone before the sixth
[1:24:34] seal comes isn't that right
[1:24:36] before the sixth seal happened the
[1:24:38] bride's supposed to be gone
[1:24:40] and i beheld verse 12 my beheld
[1:24:43] when he had opened the sixth seal and lo
[1:24:45] there was a great earthquake amen
[1:24:49] that gives certainly gives uh
[1:24:52] because remember there was a great
[1:24:54] earthquake when jesus the resurrect
[1:24:56] resurrection happen
[1:24:58] this this is presumption
[1:25:00] but it does gives you a reason to wonder
[1:25:02] whether when california goes down the
[1:25:04] rapture won't take place it's somewhere
[1:25:06] along the line it would be
[1:25:08] correspond with an earthquake amen
[1:25:11] but a great earthquake and the sun
[1:25:13] became black a sackcloth of hair and the
[1:25:15] moon became his blood
[1:25:17] and the stars remember he shakes the
[1:25:19] heavens and the earth over in isaiah
[1:25:20] right
[1:25:21] and the stars of heaven fell upon the
[1:25:24] earth
[1:25:25] amen
[1:25:26] even as a fig tree casters or untimely
[1:25:29] fix when she is shaken of a mighty wind
[1:25:33] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[1:25:35] it is rolled together and every mountain
[1:25:38] and island were moved out of their
[1:25:40] places and the kings of the earth and
[1:25:42] the great men and the rich men and the
[1:25:44] chief captains and the mighty man the
[1:25:45] bond man and every free man hid
[1:25:47] themselves in the dens
[1:25:49] and in the rocks of the mountains and
[1:25:51] remember
[1:25:52] remember what isaiah said there enter
[1:25:55] into the rock and hide the end of dust
[1:25:57] amen for the day of the lord is coming
[1:26:00] so here revelations once again
[1:26:02] it says in the dens and the rocks of the
[1:26:04] mountains
[1:26:06] and said to the mountains and the rocks
[1:26:08] fall on us and hide us from the face of
[1:26:09] him that setteth on the throne
[1:26:11] and from the wrath of the lamb for the
[1:26:15] great day of his wrath is common who
[1:26:17] shall be
[1:26:19] able to stand
[1:26:22] many places in the revelation he talks
[1:26:24] about the wrath of god poured out
[1:26:26] without mixture
[1:26:28] in the winepress of the fierceness of
[1:26:30] the wrath of almighty god
[1:26:32] folks i don't know about you but you
[1:26:34] there's some people that you don't want
[1:26:35] to get mad
[1:26:37] but can you imagine when god gets angry
[1:26:43] and not just angry the bible says it
[1:26:45] talks about his fierce wrath
[1:26:49] because you know it's one thing to be
[1:26:50] mad but when somebody's furious
[1:26:53] you really want to hit the door
[1:26:58] when they're furious man and that's what
[1:27:00] god's going to be he's going to be his
[1:27:02] fury
[1:27:03] he's going to be very angry
[1:27:05] amen
[1:27:07] and rightfully so
[1:27:09] rightfully
[1:27:12] because man he extended his arm he
[1:27:14] extended his arm thousands of times he
[1:27:17] extended his arm did miracles signs and
[1:27:19] wonders and show them and they see oh
[1:27:21] turned away turned away turned away
[1:27:24] he says now you
[1:27:25] turned away mercy
[1:27:26] now you will stand
[1:27:28] his judgment
[1:27:30] that's right literally
[1:27:32] buildings falling on people
[1:27:34] earth opening up people falling in all
[1:27:36] the wrath of god they have to stand as
[1:27:38] judgment because if they refuse his
[1:27:41] mercy
[1:27:42] amen
[1:27:49] amen i don't think i brought it out
[1:27:55] you see folks why we have time to come
[1:27:57] church on
[1:27:58] wednesday sunday
[1:28:04] to search our hearts search our souls
[1:28:07] see honest you are i mean those the pure
[1:28:10] heart they shall see god
[1:28:13] make sure everything's right
[1:28:15] make sure every little sin is taken care
[1:28:17] of
[1:28:19] make sure that when he comes you're
[1:28:20] ready to go
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:24] it's not because we're afraid of his
[1:28:26] wrath
[1:28:27] even though we do want to escape his
[1:28:29] wrath
[1:28:30] but because we simply
[1:28:32] appreciate his mercy
[1:28:34] we appreciate his grace we appreciate
[1:28:36] what he has done we accept what he has
[1:28:39] done we receive his mercy we accept it
[1:28:42] deep you know that's why i only want one
[1:28:45] i only want one choice and that's him
[1:28:49] amen not just one one choice and that's
[1:28:51] jesus christ aren't you glad
[1:28:56] somebody said praise the lord
[1:28:58] say i'm glad
[1:28:59] i chose him
[1:29:02] and he chose me
[1:29:04] amen
[1:29:05] because only two choices only two
[1:29:08] destinations
[1:29:11] one is to go and meet him in the air
[1:29:14] with all the saints right
[1:29:16] with all the saints of all the ages that
[1:29:18] have died give their life

[1:29:30] little more

[1:29:53] people who support ukraine and so forth
