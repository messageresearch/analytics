prayer hey open your Bibles to Isaiah 53 who hath believed a report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed foreign a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chat the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to this latter and as a sheep before her shearers is done so he openeth not his mouth foreign with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth he shall see at the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities a portion with a great Haitian of the spoil with the strong because he has poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he Bears sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors okay other Troy to be seated that's a beautiful scripture wasn't it is the Lord being good to everyone this week it's been good to me I know that he's been good I believe and trust to all of us it's a beautiful day out we're looking headed in the right direction with weather it looks like so that's really nice we'll just go back uh a few uh chapters here in Isaiah it's just one verse it's Isaiah one he's got a couple scriptures talking about the goodness of God how good he is to us it's a uh in Isaiah it's uh chapter one verse 18. come now and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as wide as snow though they be red like Crimson they should be as wool amen it was that's a lot of times when the devil tries to trick us and he tries to get us to look at ourselves or what we offer to God but we have nothing to offer God work he did everything and I got this quote here from adoption talking about the love of God for the ram says well bless your heart he was talking to a sister there no harm can come nothing at all in the evening time will go up on top of the mountain talking about uh on top of the mountain say oh papa God and once was lost but once was in the moccasin but you saved me why people that's tried to express that which went crazy well that man who wrote the last verse of that oh love of God depend on an insane while the institution who tried to express love of God how many stood to how that he stooped down to save Sinners and now that he did his love that come down to save you and I talk about worship Angels don't know nothing about it the worship the angel only knows he can stand there in his and his wings go back and forth and across and say hallelujah hallelujah but oh mercy when it comes to knowing I was lost and now I'm found I was dead and I'm alive again oh God it was sin I was in Mock and I was down in the dump but I'm not anymore thank the Lord and he was talking about the best of life we look at the it's a beautiful day out the things of life he says here's the best that life could give you did you ever go down and he's talking about where we were and stooped in sin and and uh he said did you ever go down to the dump this was the Colgate dump it's the stinkiest they used to must have burned the dumps off back then he said that old just makes me sick to smell it laying there and all that old smoke so sick at your stomach just turning inside out after taking castor oil he said see just as sick as you can be rats running all over you trying to eat on you and that's the best that life can give you here and then and then somebody reached down and pick you up and you're real old and can't help yourself and he just reaches down and picks you up and turn you to an 18 year old boy again set you up on top of the mountain the very very Bloom of Health my good breath or fresh air like that good cold drink of water would you ever want to go back to that dump again he says never never would I ever want to go back to that dump again and I heard him this morning it was uh just uh hearing this he said even if we don't want a minute he said after you're over the age of 25 he said you're going back going backwards to the dust but he said well he didn't make a exception in there he said we're we're actually going back but he said actually our life's not even started yet so I thought that was really good but let's see here where are we going here okay we'll turn over into Ephesians Ephesians 2 and Paul and uh just the chapter two here Ephesians chapter two and and you have he quickened who were dead and trespasses and sins wherein in time pass you walk according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the Mind where by Nature the children of a wrath even as others uh verse 4 here but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace we are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God that's a again we've talked about a lot of times you know talked about different people but we sometimes try to we sometimes get ourselves in the way of God for he says there uh seeding Riches of his of his grace to his kindness toward us through Jesus Christ for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift it is a gift of God to us now that works lest any man should boast for We Are for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we would should walk in them and this little quote kind of goes with it one's from the faith of Abraham brother Baron says in here whosoever is born of the spirit of God is gods and you're coming by the promise that the Covenant God made to Abraham his promise that he would send Christ and if you're in Christ you're part of that Covenant and the promises you say I'm not worthy neither was Abraham these are good things to listen to because a lot of times if you don't listen and go build yourself up in in the word of God or build or listen to a tape the Devil he's at your ear all the time all the time telling you you're no good you're no good you're no good so this is good stuff for us to hear uh all throughout the week really we should feed on it because it just keeps you up because the world's just a pressure pressing you down pressing you down but I like how I sit in here Covenant and it was through the Covenant that he had gave Abraham and you say he says and you say I'm not worthy and brother Brandon said neither was Abraham nobody's worthy it ain't how worthy you are it's what God promised you and uh he says he goes on to say I'm not worthy to stand up here but he called me to do it you're not worthy to be a Christian but God made you one this Temple was not worthy to sit on this ground but God said it here that's it it ain't what you are it's what he is everybody's always looking at theirselves why you can't look at yourself and get anywhere you're finished to begin with your failure to start with there's nothing to you to begin with it's what God Made You is what you are under the old Covenant what if a little mule would be born out of the pasture some night and when that little mule was born he turned around and his Mammy would look at him and his ears would be flopped down you know that what a flopped your mule is being a farmer that's a mule that's no good and he's cross-eyed his knees are knocked together his tail stick straight up in the air well he's the horriblest looking sight you ever seen that little fella could look around at his Mimi and say well I won't be able to live no sir because as soon as the master comes out here he he'll knock me in the head because I ain't worth nothing that's just about like every one of us but his mother well instructed in the word of God she'd say wait a minute honey no no you're born under a Birthright when the man of the house comes out he will go to the pasture and hunt the most perfect lamb that he's got the high priest will never see you he will see the lamb he won't examine you he will examine the lamb because you're born under a Birthright the lamb has to die for you now you look at Jesus and find any fall in him don't look at yourself look at him don't look who you are look who he is then you'll be getting close to Divine Healing search your sacrifice over if you can find any fault in that well that's that's the different then you have a right to disbelieve but there's no fault in him there's no fault in Jesus God don't look at you he looked at the sacrifice there was a perfect one died for us faulty ones we who are disfigured in immoral and ugly and everything we but he took the perfect one and looked him all over this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased he was the sacrifice God accepted him so ours is finished all we have to do is walk in Grace well that little mule could just kick up them little heels and knock them little naught knees together and knicker go all over the field because he's free you don't have to die a lamb died for him he's perfectly safe you don't have to fear about dying the lamb died for him for uh for him you don't have to fear about what you are it's what he was he was the one who died for us for you when you find fault in him then I'll tell you why he can't be healed but when you find no fault in your sacrifice God has accepted that sacrifice and when he accepts a sacrifice he accepts your confession in the sacrifice and you become part of it amen that's good I'm just gonna finish up that's truth 100 truth you have to take and look at Jesus as your sacrifice and like I said the devil will kick you around devil try to get you to look at your symptoms try to look at you try to look at why you can't have it that don't have nothing to do what God done did for you he done he doesn't finish the work so take a hold of it and go forward always go forward brother Steve said I guess we'll do her best and he said well it'll go forward basically he said we don't never go over never Retreat we go forward but this is that part of that verse this is a little bit of the verse before talking about the love of God that song the love of God is straight or far than tonger pen can ever tell goes beyond the highest star and reaches two the lowest hell this was the verse that was penned on the side of an insane insane Institution could we with ink the ocean fill and were the Skies of parchment made where every stalk on earth a quail and every man ascribed by trade to write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry nor could this grow contain coal go stretched from Sky to Sky I'll let Brother David go from here God bless you morning amen let's stand this morning I appreciate that this
