[38:35] christ
[38:36] amen and amen amen i want to do
[38:39] something and i
[38:40] i just feel uh that we owe certainly oh
[38:43] to it this is a
[38:44] memorial day and i did a little a little
[38:47] bit of search on it
[38:48] and i think they started this memorial
[38:50] day thing back in the
[38:52] around 1868 or something like that
[38:56] amen after the civil war they began to
[38:59] get together and kind of celebrate or
[39:01] not celebrate but to commemorate
[39:03] uh and to decorate the graves of those
[39:06] who had they had lost and so forth and
[39:08] so they ended up making a time of
[39:11] remembering those who have fallen in
[39:13] battle and so forth
[39:15] as you think of where it originates from
[39:17] and so i was thinking
[39:19] you know because i seen on the news
[39:21] somewhere where some young i guess
[39:22] college kids wanted to try to put a
[39:24] petition together to
[39:26] cancel memorial day you know
[39:29] you know i just thought in my mind of
[39:31] how i would like to have a little
[39:32] discussion with them
[39:35] you know and telling them of how many
[39:38] gave their lives and
[39:40] how they gave their lives so they could
[39:41] sit where they're sitting
[39:43] so they can live where they're living so
[39:45] they can actually put up a petition if
[39:46] they wanted to like that
[39:48] and act like that they died so they
[39:49] could do that and you don't even
[39:51] appreciate that
[39:53] you know and if you don't appreciate you
[39:55] know the country and
[39:56] the people that's given their life you
[39:57] don't deserve it you know right
[39:59] it ain't right amen but anyway that was
[40:02] just kind of going around in my mind
[40:05] but i appreciate god what god has given
[40:08] us i appreciate
[40:09] amen those who have given their lives
[40:11] and there's been millions
[40:12] isn't that right amen you could you
[40:14] could be in some hitler under some
[40:16] hitler regime
[40:18] is that right go into the gas chambers
[40:20] if you don't do just what they said or
[40:22] starving in their camps or working to
[40:24] death that's what it could have been
[40:26] isn't that right but we thank uh god for
[40:29] our heroes and for those who have given
[40:31] their lives and we want to take a moment
[40:33] of silence just to remember amen all of
[40:35] those who are laying in the graves today
[40:38] young and old and and all those who have
[40:41] died so that we can have the freedom of
[40:42] being here
[40:43] this morning and worship the lord
[40:45] according to the dictates of our heart
[40:47] so let's have a moment of silence
[41:04] um
[41:14] amen amen
[41:24] amen if you will turn your bibles this
[41:28] morning
[41:29] and this will be my memorial day i
[41:31] thought about memorial day
[41:33] and remembering those who have died for
[41:36] us and so forth
[41:38] so i begin to thinking about how that
[41:41] really you know in battles different
[41:44] things that happen
[41:46] a lot of times people will get different
[41:48] kind of stars and badges
[41:50] for heroism in that right
[41:54] but you know i think it doesn't matter
[41:55] who it is anybody that
[41:57] has given their life for their country
[41:59] and so forth
[42:00] amen is worthy of the status of hero
[42:04] ship
[42:04] don't you think amen and so
[42:07] this morning i want to speak with speak
[42:09] about footprints amen following
[42:11] footprints and i'll talk about super
[42:14] superheroes amen amen following
[42:16] footprints
[42:17] superheroes amen turn if you will with
[42:20] me and we'll go to the book of hebrews
[42:22] amen and i want to start with chapter 12
[42:25] verse 1 and i think this is what we
[42:27] spoke on wednesday evening
[42:30] and we want to take that up again and go
[42:33] in a different direction if we could
[42:34] this morning with the help of the lord
[42:48] therefore seeing that we are compassed
[42:50] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[42:52] let us lay aside every weight and the
[42:54] sin which does so easily beset us
[42:57] and let us run with patience the race
[42:59] that is set before us
[43:01] looking unto jesus the author and
[43:03] finisher of our faith
[43:06] who for the joy that was set before him
[43:08] endured the cross
[43:10] despising the shame and is set down at
[43:12] the right hand
[43:13] of the throne of god another scripture
[43:17] in romans 8
[43:18] if you want to turn with me we'll read
[43:19] these two scriptures before we go into
[43:21] our
[43:22] main thought that we want to pick up
[43:24] here in a little bit and that'll be
[43:25] chapter
[43:26] 11. we want to go through chapter 11 of
[43:28] hebrews and talking about
[43:30] amen the great warriors of faith in the
[43:32] bible
[43:33] amen romans 8 very familiar scripture
[43:36] but it'll go along with what we're
[43:38] talking about eight and verse
[43:41] twenty nine
[43:46] romans eight and verse twenty nine for
[43:48] whom he did
[43:49] for no he also did predestinate
[43:53] to be conformed to the image of his son
[43:56] that he might be the firstborn among
[43:59] many
[43:59] brethren amen may god add his blessings
[44:02] to the reading of the word you can be
[44:04] seated
[44:04] this morning amen first i want to start
[44:07] out
[44:08] by reading a psalm amen
[44:11] the song psalm amen called the psalm of
[44:15] life and it's
[44:16] talking about footprints on the same
[44:17] time would that be okay
[44:20] and it goes like this it says what the
[44:23] heart of the young man said to the
[44:25] psalmist
[44:26] tell me not in mournful numbers
[44:29] life is but an empty dream for the soul
[44:33] is dead that slumbers and things are not
[44:36] what they seem
[44:37] life is real life is earnest
[44:40] and the grave is not its goal
[44:44] amen i pause so you can say amen right
[44:46] there
[44:48] isn't that the truth that's right that
[44:50] the grave is not its goal how many is
[44:52] glad for that
[44:54] praise be to god i'm sure glad that it's
[44:56] we're not just a bunch of monkeys come
[44:58] here
[44:58] live for a little while and then it's
[45:00] all over with wouldn't we would be
[45:02] without hope wouldn't that be a hopeless
[45:04] situation and yet anybody that doesn't
[45:06] believe in jesus christ is just in that
[45:09] situation amen
[45:10] oh my now notice when that's spoken of
[45:12] the soul
[45:13] not enjoyment and not sorrow is our
[45:16] destined
[45:17] end or away but to act that each
[45:20] tomorrow may find us further
[45:23] than today amen
[45:28] amen but to act that each tomorrow find
[45:31] us further than
[45:32] today art is long and time is fleeting
[45:36] and our hearts those stout and brave
[45:39] still like muffled drums are beating
[45:42] funeral marches
[45:44] to the grave in the world's broad field
[45:48] of battle
[45:50] in the baby of life
[45:53] to be like dumb uh be not dumb driven
[45:56] cattle be a hero in the strife
[46:00] amen trust no future high ever pleasant
[46:05] let the dead pass bury its dead act act
[46:09] in the living present
[46:11] heart within and god overhead amen
[46:15] how many believes that don't worry about
[46:17] the past don't look back
[46:19] but act in the present live
[46:22] in the present amen
[46:26] my lives
[46:29] of great men all remind us we can make
[46:32] our lives sublime
[46:34] and departing leave behind us footprints
[46:38] on the sands of time footprints that
[46:41] perhaps
[46:42] another sailing over or life
[46:45] solemn mane a furlong and shipwrecked
[46:48] mother
[46:49] seeing shall take heart again
[46:52] let us then be up and doing with a heart
[46:54] of
[46:55] any faith for any fate amen
[46:59] so in other words let's get up let's go
[47:01] doing it doesn't matter
[47:03] what our fate we don't know what the
[47:06] future holds do we
[47:08] no but no matter what it is let's be up
[47:10] and let's be doing
[47:11] still achieving still pursuing learn to
[47:14] labor
[47:15] and to wait amen so i believe that how
[47:19] many believes that as we go through this
[47:21] life
[47:22] we leave behind us footprints
[47:25] on the sands of time in other words we
[47:27] leave footprints for somebody
[47:30] to follow amen
[47:33] for somebody to come after but the band
[47:35] tells the story of a
[47:37] man one time in the neighborhood a good
[47:39] man and his son and how did he went
[47:41] in the city and went from block to block
[47:43] from house to house and
[47:45] all of his friends different ones maybe
[47:47] around christmas time i believe it was
[47:49] and how did he went and he would go
[47:50] visit the different ones and
[47:52] and they'd say here have a little wine
[47:53] or have a little drink you know or
[47:55] whatever it was and
[47:56] he'd take a little drink he'd go to
[47:58] another one and they'd give him a little
[47:59] drink another one give him a little
[48:00] drink and
[48:01] social drink so to speak you know and
[48:03] amen he was going through the park i
[48:05] believe it was and he was going down
[48:06] through there and he looked back and
[48:08] his son was just doing all kinds of zig
[48:10] zag walking he looked back and says
[48:12] son what's wrong with you why are you
[48:14] walking like that
[48:16] huh he says dad i'm following your
[48:19] footprints
[48:22] and he was said that i'm so sorry son
[48:26] uh you know he realized that he was
[48:28] setting the example
[48:30] amen amen now let me say this
[48:33] i truly believe that god has made each
[48:36] and every individual he has made this
[48:39] and created us
[48:40] in a certain way amen and that is that
[48:44] we look to people how many notes we
[48:47] always look to somebody
[48:49] we always want to be like somebody
[48:53] and god made us that way you know right
[48:56] he made us to look to somebody we look
[48:59] to heroes we look
[49:00] we look to people like george washington
[49:03] abraham lincoln we look at the great
[49:05] founders
[49:06] of this country that's almost illegal to
[49:09] say nowadays
[49:13] isn't that right amen
[49:17] oh boy don't let me get political here
[49:19] but from what i understand so some black
[49:21] folks that was
[49:22] tearing down abraham lincoln's statue
[49:27] what do you all think of that the very
[49:29] man that was a
[49:30] martyr died to free them
[49:34] huh that's not very good at all
[49:37] is it no sir and different statues all
[49:41] the different statues of people
[49:43] great men amen of america and i believe
[49:46] that america
[49:47] had some great men
[49:50] amen like abraham lincoln when he seen
[49:53] slavery down in the south
[49:54] he says i'm gonna hit that thing if it
[49:56] costs me my life
[49:59] amen and we know that they weren't too
[50:01] happy with what he accomplished
[50:03] in freeing the slaves amen and they shot
[50:06] him in the back of the head
[50:08] amen i like another story brother brown
[50:10] talked about how that
[50:11] in the museum one time by the bedroom
[50:13] visit the museum
[50:14] amen and he's seen a black man i believe
[50:16] it was he was their sister crying and
[50:18] crying and crying
[50:20] and he was looking at abraham lincoln's
[50:21] stature
[50:23] and the dress there i believe it was his
[50:24] wife's dress if i wasn't wrong and
[50:26] amen and he was looking at it and he
[50:28] asked him well what are you crying about
[50:30] what is
[50:30] so meaningful he says you know i'm just
[50:32] sitting here amen and i realized it was
[50:34] his blood
[50:36] that freed me it meant so much to him
[50:40] it was his blood cost him his life
[50:43] but how many knows we've had a great
[50:45] hero amen the lord jesus christ
[50:48] amen that set us free to shed his blood
[50:51] so that
[50:52] it don't matter what color you are we
[50:55] can all be free
[50:57] we're free amen oh i like
[51:00] brothers and sisters i don't believe
[51:02] that there's any racism in christianity
[51:05] ain't no christian no it doesn't matter
[51:08] when you get over there
[51:09] there'll be a it talks about how that
[51:11] they'll be of every tribe
[51:13] kindred and tongue will be there amen
[51:16] if we can't get along here we probably
[51:18] won't be there
[51:22] that's right because we're going to get
[51:24] along just fine over there
[51:26] we should get a long fine over here
[51:28] ain't a human being
[51:29] you try to take a chimpanzee and give
[51:31] yourself a blood transfusion you're
[51:33] going to have problems
[51:35] but it don't matter if you're chinese i
[51:37] don't care what you are
[51:39] hello we can all give each other blood
[51:42] transfusions
[51:43] i mean we're all one blood so to speak
[51:46] amen
[51:47] but this morning i want to talk about
[51:48] that we want to look at because how many
[51:50] knows that
[51:51] we are actually made the kind of people
[51:54] that we are
[51:56] all right most likely and it has a great
[52:00] bearing
[52:01] you know on how that we are raised isn't
[52:04] that right
[52:05] amen the books that we read the things
[52:08] that we look at the things that we
[52:10] meditate on to
[52:11] things that our parents teach us has a
[52:14] bearing on how
[52:15] we turn out
[52:20] amen the kind of character
[52:24] that we are because we know that abraham
[52:26] lincoln the prophet said that abraham
[52:27] lincoln
[52:28] amen up to a certain time the only books
[52:30] that he had
[52:31] was the bible and the foxes book of
[52:34] martyrs
[52:36] and no doubt i don't know about you but
[52:38] looking at those people and those
[52:39] you look in martyr's mirror book and
[52:41] you'll see them amen where they putting
[52:43] them drowned them amen they're drawn to
[52:45] them they're bringing them back them up
[52:46] but they have big bellies where they're
[52:48] watching their belly is full of water
[52:50] and they're trying to get them to
[52:51] renounce christ
[52:53] it's some terrible pictures i still got

[55:39] history that
[55:40] america typed israel driving out the
[55:44] occupants
[55:45] of that land a good land that flowed
[55:48] with milk and honey
[55:50] is that right and we drove the indians
[55:52] back just like
[55:53] israel drove them back they had joshuas
[55:56] they had calebs they had
[55:58] all these great warriors we had great
[56:01] warriors we had people like george
[56:03] washington
[56:05] hello according to the problem that he
[56:07] swept before he crossed that delaware
[56:10] before he crossed that thing he got down
[56:12] on his knees until his clothes
[56:13] were completely wet from having an all
[56:16] night prayer meeting
[56:19] how many know i mean he's got a picture
[56:21] of george washington crossing that
[56:22] delaware
[56:23] on that ice he broke up water with that
[56:25] american flag sailing
[56:28] isn't that a heroic it's a real heroic
[56:31] picture
[56:31] of a man and let me just make this
[56:33] statement and put this down in your hard
[56:35] drive this morning
[56:36] and that day is that real men are made
[56:39] on their
[56:42] knees
[56:45] real women are made real ladies on their
[56:49] knees that's where they're made that's
[56:51] why they're molded because i'll tell you
[56:53] right now
[56:53] unless you have a close relationship
[56:55] with your creator you're not going to
[56:57] amount to
[56:58] much anybody that ever amounted to a
[57:00] hillary is a man
[57:01] and they believe god
[57:03] [Applause]
[57:05] because that's where he draws his
[57:06] strength from that's where faith comes
[57:08] by faith we understand that the worlds
[57:10] were created by faith abel offered a
[57:12] promo section that sacrificed the
[57:14] democrat
[57:15] by faith abraham by faith moses
[57:17] conquered all of egypt
[57:20] why because that's where your source of
[57:22] strength comes
[57:23] that's where you become a man
[57:31] you get away from that you'll become all
[57:34] sissified
[57:35] you let all the little kinds of little
[57:37] imps and demons get on you
[57:39] of differences bickering fusses
[57:43] hello all kinds of things will get on
[57:45] you if you don't stay on your knees
[57:48] folks i want to tell you something don't
[57:51] show me your biceps
[57:53] show me your bags on your knees amen

[58:04] dedicated to his creator

[1:03:06] nation that is based upon christianity
[1:03:11] and the serving of almighty god and god
[1:03:13] helped us

[1:03:17] god was with us in world war one he was
[1:03:19] with us as world war
[1:03:21] ii he helped us defeat germany did japan
[1:03:24] he helped us defeat all them but when we
[1:03:27] turned away from him in 1956
[1:03:30] god turned his back on us
[1:03:33] we ain't hardly one of war sins folks
[1:03:36] all we do is smear things around and
[1:03:38] make things worse
[1:03:40] huh we were founded as the prophet said
[1:03:43] upon christian principle and upon god
[1:03:47] huh i still want to get up in congress
[1:03:50] brother glenn
[1:03:52] and i want to just get up there and hold
[1:03:53] my dollar up

[1:04:31] oh my because this nation did we trusted
[1:04:35] in god but let me tell you something
[1:04:38] there's something that's not so good
[1:04:40] for a nation that turns your back on
[1:04:42] their god
[1:04:43] read joshua the 24th chapter he talks
[1:04:45] about he says you know
[1:04:46] joshua told israel he says you cannot
[1:04:48] serve god
[1:04:50] because he's a jealous god and when he
[1:04:53] has done you good
[1:04:55] if you go to whoring after other gods he
[1:04:57] will punish you for it
[1:05:00] amen so y'all ain't able to he says yeah
[1:05:02] we are
[1:05:03] we commit ourselves to commit we commit
[1:05:05] ourselves to following him
[1:05:08] just after joshua had said you know as
[1:05:10] for me and my house we're going to serve
[1:05:11] the lord
[1:05:11] they all want to serve the lord in that
[1:05:14] and they did they made that decision and
[1:05:15] joshua said i witnessed before you this
[1:05:17] day
[1:05:18] of the decision that you have made let
[1:05:21] me tell you when you claim the name of
[1:05:22] christianity it's time to use less sell
[1:05:24] out
[1:05:25] lock stock and barrel because god
[1:05:27] doesn't want you this halfway stuff
[1:05:30] he doesn't accept it and i want to
[1:05:32] preach a message on these one of these
[1:05:34] days
[1:05:34] how that god is not pleased with our
[1:05:36] halfway walk with him
[1:05:38] you expect him to come and change your
[1:05:41] mortal body one of these mornings
[1:05:43] or at any time to come and change your
[1:05:45] mortal body
[1:05:47] and you don't love him with all your
[1:05:49] heart all your mind all your soul all
[1:05:50] your saints

[1:06:22] say it will never change you
[1:06:26] it takes the holy ghost to change you
[1:06:29] it takes the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:06:31] and it takes you getting in the right
[1:06:33] place
[1:06:33] towards the holy ghost to come down and
[1:06:35] change you none of us are changeable
[1:06:38] outside of the holy ghost

[1:07:20] uncomfortable over there
[1:07:21] because people are going to be screaming
[1:07:22] and shouting they're going to be
[1:07:24] praising god and hallelujah

[1:09:03] little more today and a whole lot more
[1:09:05] tomorrow

[1:09:08] what we was yesterday

[1:12:49] honor of bravery and everything else
[1:12:51] amen and their cousin their brother
[1:12:52] their comrade the people they were close

[1:13:05] head blown off
[1:13:06] and they run out there and they drag
[1:13:08] their body the same thing
[1:13:10] why because of something in here
[1:13:14] they don't sit around saying well you
[1:13:15] know maybe i wonder if i should do this
[1:13:21] let's wait till the bullets slow down
[1:13:24] they don't think about it they go out
[1:13:26] there
[1:13:27] and then they get rewarded with great
[1:13:29] heroic act that's a hero for bravery
[1:13:34] they call it bravery i call it spirit
[1:13:38] i call it love and that's what we need
[1:13:40] every one of us
[1:13:44] amen
[1:13:47] lord help us listen
[1:13:50] prophet god says it this way he says we
[1:13:52] have in this country
[1:13:53] we have so many dissatisfied people he
[1:13:57] was talking about
[1:13:58] identification and identifying yourself
[1:14:01] with somebody
[1:14:02] people are not satisfied
[1:14:06] huh
[1:14:09] rob rod rodman is his name rod rodman
[1:14:14] you all know him the basketball player
[1:14:16] that tattooed himself up
[1:14:19] dennis rodman yeah the guy that the
[1:14:22] north korean got leader like so well
[1:14:28] he was one of the first i guess you know
[1:14:29] and tattooing himself all up
[1:14:32] and look at how that the people idolize
[1:14:34] that look at that look at this
[1:14:36] how the people aren't happy with one
[1:14:38] little tattoo they weren't happy
[1:14:40] they hear like i said a while ago
[1:14:44] uh they weren't happy with that they
[1:14:45] they're never satisfied people are not
[1:14:47] satisfied
[1:14:49] people sitting in pews they're not
[1:14:50] satisfied
[1:14:53] why because they look to the wrong thing
[1:14:55] for satisfaction
[1:14:57] they try to find satisfaction in drugs
[1:14:59] and alcohol
[1:15:00] they find it in people in hollywood
[1:15:02] movie stars
[1:15:04] huh and basketball players
[1:15:08] race car drivers
[1:15:12] and everything else they look for
[1:15:13] satisfaction and don't realize there's
[1:15:15] only one place
[1:15:16] that you can sit under ever a green tree
[1:15:18] and be totally happy
[1:15:20] all by yourself
[1:15:27] most of the time when we're not
[1:15:28] satisfied we complain about somebody
[1:15:30] don't love me
[1:15:32] somebody don't love me i don't care if
[1:15:35] nobody loves me as long as he loves me
[1:15:38] now if he don't love me and i don't feel
[1:15:40] like he loves me neither am i going to
[1:15:42] feel like anybody else loves me because
[1:15:43] i'll be empty inside
[1:15:45] and my wife will have to have me a pity
[1:15:47] party oh honey now come on
[1:15:52] okay let me tell you something about my
[1:15:53] wife i like my wife
[1:15:55] i have a pity party for myself sometimes
[1:15:57] and she helps me snap right out of it
[1:16:01] [Laughter]
[1:16:05] oh yeah that's right honey it don't look
[1:16:07] good on you
[1:16:09] it don't fit you it ain't you
[1:16:15] i'll pick myself up by the boot shop
[1:16:17] from head on brother
[1:16:22] oh my praise the lord but i'm just glad
[1:16:27] that we can look to all of these great
[1:16:29] warriors that we want to mention more of
[1:16:31] and we want to be like that but they all
[1:16:36] have footprints that have a fault in
[1:16:39] them
[1:16:40] isn't that right every man has a fault
[1:16:44] in it
[1:16:46] you know david was a man after god's own
[1:16:48] heart and i want to be
[1:16:49] like him when it comes to slaying giants
[1:16:51] in my life
[1:16:53] don't you want to be able to slay giants
[1:16:54] in your life and so forth
[1:16:56] but he had a flaw and women was his flaw
[1:17:00] amen it was his weakness
[1:17:04] amen and so he had a great flaw and so
[1:17:06] we don't want to follow that even the
[1:17:08] prophet of god brother branham how many
[1:17:10] know
[1:17:10] amen he had to god was with him he had
[1:17:12] an angel with him
[1:17:13] never could have a service amen but god
[1:17:16] would come down and vindicate and prove
[1:17:17] that god is here
[1:17:19] he's alive he's real jesus is really
[1:17:22] resurrected
[1:17:23] but yet he had flaws tell white lies
[1:17:28] i couldn't say maybe lies but he did
[1:17:30] that one time and he had to make that
[1:17:32] right and he confessed to that
[1:17:34] and he says look don't let my faults be
[1:17:36] a stumbling block
[1:17:38] his fault let me tell you something his
[1:17:40] fault was a stumbling block to me
[1:17:44] okay are you following me but his
[1:17:47] confession
[1:17:48] was a stepping stone for me
[1:17:51] sure the fault is nothing good but the
[1:17:53] confession shows
[1:17:55] that i can follow this man
[1:17:58] amen that's why i always
[1:18:01] think one of the greatest things that a
[1:18:03] human being can do are you listening
[1:18:06] one of the greatest miracles the
[1:18:07] greatest thing that a human being can do
[1:18:10] is say i'm sorry i was wrong
[1:18:15] that comes hard first admit
[1:18:18] i'm wrong i'm sorry
[1:18:22] people just don't have the ability
[1:18:24] hardly to humble themselves
[1:18:27] because we're so determined that we're
[1:18:29] right
[1:18:36] the older i get the more i realize that
[1:18:38] we should realize that
[1:18:39] we very easily can be wrong
[1:18:43] amen you have to be careful
[1:18:47] praise be to god we look at
[1:18:50] those three abraham lincoln george
[1:18:53] washington
[1:18:54] abraham lincoln's example that i like
[1:18:57] was the fact
[1:18:58] of what he fed on how he was raised
[1:19:01] and i believe it was him that said you
[1:19:03] know if there's any good in me
[1:19:05] credit my mom she taught me right
[1:19:09] is that right how many knows we need
[1:19:10] good mothers
[1:19:12] we need to be taught right we need to
[1:19:14] bring them up in the nurturing
[1:19:16] admonition of god
[1:19:17] and teach them the things that they need
[1:19:19] to know that's what molds of that's what
[1:19:21] shapes him
[1:19:22] amen and the things that he reads and so
[1:19:24] forth and he became a great man
[1:19:26] on account of that and that's what our
[1:19:28] young people should take an example of
[1:19:30] george washington's prayer life and his
[1:19:33] bravery
[1:19:35] after he prayed that night and after he
[1:19:36] crossed the delaware it said that there
[1:19:38] were three musket
[1:19:40] bullet holes in his coat
[1:19:43] and none of them touched him
[1:19:48] amen none of them
[1:19:51] touched him but yet that had to be awful
[1:19:54] close didn't
[1:19:59] see what prayer does
[1:20:03] he was there praying all night and
[1:20:04] praying and praying and praying next day
[1:20:07] god was with him when the enemy was
[1:20:10] aiming their rifle
[1:20:12] right at his chest hello
[1:20:16] the angels were over there on each one
[1:20:18] of that enemies that was
[1:20:19] aiming at him and they made them guys
[1:20:22] twitch
[1:20:26] just that maybe right
[1:20:29] just made him miss what
[1:20:33] i'm okay i'm stupid baby but i believe
[1:20:36] it
[1:20:37] i believe i love believing it something
[1:20:40] had to happen i believe the angel is
[1:20:41] watching over him
[1:20:43] how many believes the angels watch over
[1:20:45] you
[1:20:47] yes sir it watches over us when we have
[1:20:50] a walk with the lord
[1:20:52] amen we know that the angel of the lord
[1:20:56] was with the prophet all the days of his
[1:20:57] life i mean believes that no matter if
[1:20:59] it's a hotel room or wherever he was the
[1:21:00] angel was always there
[1:21:03] and so and i thought you know he had
[1:21:05] that
[1:21:06] what about us but what he said was
[1:21:10] those that fear him the bible says that
[1:21:13] the people
[1:21:14] that fear god the angels of the lord
[1:21:18] don't come visit you once in a while
[1:21:21] it says stay in camp
[1:21:26] come on glory
[1:21:29] that makes me feel good that the angels
[1:21:32] of god are
[1:21:33] camping around you if you fear god
[1:21:37] that's why it was so close but it didn't
[1:21:39] get you
[1:21:41] so close almost but it didn't get you
[1:21:45] because i'll tell you what when your
[1:21:47] time's up the angel back up
[1:21:50] time to go home but until then nothing
[1:21:53] can happen to you
[1:21:57] that's right nothing can happen until he
[1:22:00] pulls it back
[1:22:01] and pulls your card but the angels of
[1:22:03] god are around about those that fear him
[1:22:07] amen i'll just comes to mind just stoma
[1:22:10] jackson another great man amen
[1:22:15] i'm gonna come up to snowball jackson
[1:22:16] and say stonewall jackson
[1:22:18] what in the world what in the world
[1:22:22] makes you to be able to stand there and
[1:22:24] i think he fought indians and
[1:22:26] and i don't know just if he was in the
[1:22:28] civil war maybe also but
[1:22:30] arrows perhaps flying behind me he says
[1:22:32] how can you just stand there
[1:22:34] and all these things but it's flying
[1:22:36] everywhere things going everywhere
[1:22:38] how can you do it
[1:22:42] and i can just hear someone back it's a
[1:22:44] reply
[1:22:45] this is the way the prophet got his own
[1:22:47] wall jackson
[1:22:48] took his foot and kicked some dirt
[1:22:52] i'll tell you what i never take a drink
[1:22:54] of water
[1:22:56] without thanking my lord first
[1:23:02] that's how we ought to do don't eat that
[1:23:05] hot dog
[1:23:06] without thanking the lord don't take
[1:23:07] that drink of water without thanking the
[1:23:09] lord
[1:23:09] don't eat that biscuit you gave me
[1:23:11] without thanking the lord don't get up
[1:23:13] until you thank the lord for being able
[1:23:14] to have a good night's rest
[1:23:16] everything you do just thank god have a
[1:23:18] relationship with god
[1:23:21] and he will protect you he will watch
[1:23:24] out for you
[1:23:26] praise be to god this morning
[1:23:31] and now his name these names are forever
[1:23:34] edged in history
[1:23:36] amen even as the prophet said great men
[1:23:41] that founded this country just like the
[1:23:44] great men did with joshua
[1:23:46] and caleb amen
[1:23:51] are you all ready to start all right
[1:23:54] let's start
[1:23:56] hebrews 11th chapter
[1:24:04] now faith is the substance of things
[1:24:05] hoped for the evidence of things not
[1:24:08] seen
[1:24:09] for by it the elders became heroes
[1:24:13] obtained a good report
[1:24:19] how many when you are laying at your
[1:24:22] deathbed
[1:24:24] would like to be able to hear people say
[1:24:27] that man was a good man that woman was a
[1:24:30] good woman
[1:24:32] they have a good report about you
[1:24:37] how many wants to be that way you want a
[1:24:39] good report
[1:24:41] when children bring their report card
[1:24:43] home isn't that right they'd like to see
[1:24:45] if there's f
[1:24:45] sauna d's b's c's
[1:24:50] a's a
[1:24:53] plus is that right how many wants a plus
[1:24:56] on your scorecard
[1:25:01] amen then don't look to the past
[1:25:05] let the bed bury the dead in the past
[1:25:07] live in the present
[1:25:09] amen like the psalm says live in the
[1:25:11] present it's about now it's not about
[1:25:14] what yesterday
[1:25:14] it's about today how many believes that
[1:25:16] this morning how many will take it from
[1:25:18] this very second on
[1:25:19] it's from the second on what i do it's
[1:25:22] how i live
[1:25:23] from this second home
[1:25:26] all right through faith we understand
[1:25:28] that the worlds are framed by the word
[1:25:30] of god
[1:25:31] so that things which are seen were made
[1:25:33] not made of things which do appear
[1:25:36] amen let me just stop here if you are a
[1:25:39] christian and you have the holy spirit
[1:25:41] which is god
[1:25:43] in your heart amen
[1:25:46] then it's not hard for you to believe
[1:25:49] things that are not yet
[1:25:51] but you know they will be amen
[1:25:57] number one by faith abel offered unto
[1:26:00] god
[1:26:01] a more excellent sacrifice than cain
[1:26:04] by which he obtained witness that he was
[1:26:06] righteous god testifying of his gifts
[1:26:09] gifts and by be it being dead yet
[1:26:12] speaketh i want to take the first phrase
[1:26:14] of that we realize that by faith
[1:26:16] abel offered unto god
[1:26:20] a more excellent sacrifice to me
[1:26:24] abel is the first hero
[1:26:28] he's also the first martyr
[1:26:31] that gave his life for what he believed
[1:26:35] let me tell you this this morning that
[1:26:37] there's two types of worship
[1:26:39] there is worship that is vain
[1:26:43] and let me tell you the majority of the
[1:26:45] world's worship to god this morning
[1:26:49] is in vain
[1:26:57] a ritualistic it's become so common to
[1:27:01] people
[1:27:01] that it's just a tradition to go to
[1:27:03] church and worship
[1:27:05] huh it's vain
[1:27:08] god don't accept that stinking sacrifice
[1:27:11] he wants a fresh lamb he wants the best
[1:27:13] lamb he wants one without spot
[1:27:16] he wants to have you to worship from
[1:27:19] your heart
[1:27:21] when we sing amazing great how sweet
[1:27:23] this out
[1:27:24] it's not the same old dragony song
[1:27:27] no it's just as fresh next week as it
[1:27:29] was this morning
[1:27:31] amazing grace how sweet to sound
[1:27:34] acceptable worship
[1:27:38] cain had unacceptable worship god didn't
[1:27:41] accept his worship
[1:27:43] he put all kinds of effort into it but
[1:27:46] god didn't accept it
[1:27:48] because it wasn't revealed to him it
[1:27:50] wasn't real to him
[1:27:52] wasn't the revelation to him
[1:27:55] how many once i say god help me to have
[1:27:58] worship that is accepted
[1:28:02] to god every time we come into the house
[1:28:06] of god
[1:28:07] huh we should have worship that is
[1:28:10] accepted
[1:28:12] by god not me him
[1:28:17] huh
[1:28:21] otherwise it's in vain i'm just going to
[1:28:24] take a few here is that okay
[1:28:28] and verse 5 by faith enoch
[1:28:31] was translated that he should not see
[1:28:34] death
[1:28:36] now how many believers according to
[1:28:38] second thessalonians we which are alive
[1:28:39] and remain
[1:28:40] unto the coming lord shall not prevent
[1:28:42] them which are asleep
[1:28:43] for we shall be changed in a moment in a
[1:28:45] twinkling of an eye over there in
[1:28:47] ii corinthians i believe there is a body
[1:28:50] changing coming
[1:28:53] oh i like to think about how that before
[1:28:56] god even called no one before the flood
[1:28:58] came
[1:28:59] there was this man this hero bible hero
[1:29:03] called enoch remember this is the hero
[1:29:06] chapter right here
[1:29:08] people who left us footprints on the
[1:29:10] sands of time
[1:29:13] that 6 000 years later
[1:29:17] it is still going through the
[1:29:19] microphones of churches
[1:29:22] it's still ringing out there the
[1:29:24] testimony of what
[1:29:26] they did
[1:29:30] amen
[1:29:34] he was translated that he should not see
[1:29:35] death and
[1:29:37] was not found
[1:29:41] amen how many is looking forward to
[1:29:44] playing hide and seek
[1:29:46] that's right i'm gonna hide they're
[1:29:48] gonna seek and they're not gonna find me
[1:29:54] that's right that's what we're looking
[1:29:56] for he couldn't be found he was gone
[1:30:01] because god had translated
[1:30:05] oh my praise the lord now we come to
[1:30:09] the part where it tells the
[1:30:12] condition that you got to be in if you
[1:30:14] expect to go
[1:30:16] are you with me for before his
[1:30:19] translation
[1:30:21] he had this testimony that he
[1:30:24] pleased the pastor that he pleased the
[1:30:28] church
[1:30:29] please his wife family who did he please
[1:30:34] he pleased god
[1:30:38] how many believes that that has to be
[1:30:40] every individual's responsibility this
[1:30:43] morning
[1:30:43] is that you please god
[1:30:49] you want to go into rapture might be
[1:30:50] translated
[1:30:52] don't expect not to be pleasing god
[1:30:55] but please god amen
[1:30:58] that's what i want to do that's that's
[1:31:01] oh
[1:31:02] another place i believe it says that he
[1:31:03] walked with god
[1:31:05] and he was not he walked
[1:31:08] with god
[1:31:13] can i change something this morning i
[1:31:15] don't like many preachers changing stuff
[1:31:17] on me here
[1:31:19] because i believe in saying with the
[1:31:20] word but i think it'll fit the word okay
[1:31:24] we don't walk with god
[1:31:29] god walks in us
[1:31:33] remember jesus says the holy spirit he
[1:31:35] says i'm with you but he shall be
[1:31:37] in you amen not that don't that don't
[1:31:41] mean that god wasn't right there but
[1:31:42] we know that the holy spirit couldn't
[1:31:44] come in the way that it did until
[1:31:46] after pentecost now god walks
[1:31:50] in us he is with you
[1:31:53] but shall be in you
[1:31:58] so we walk in god with god
[1:32:01] everywhere we go amen you love him
[1:32:06] but without faith it is impossible
[1:32:10] to amount to a hill of beans
[1:32:15] didn't brother bound say if you don't
[1:32:16] believe in god
[1:32:18] any man that ever mounted to anything
[1:32:20] believed in god
[1:32:22] or should he say a hill of beans or
[1:32:23] something like that that's right in
[1:32:24] other words if you amount to anything
[1:32:27] and look at the
[1:32:31] debauchery people don't know
[1:32:34] if they're male or if they're female why
[1:32:37] because they got away from faith in god
[1:32:40] they're all confused
[1:32:44] that's right i wouldn't care what it
[1:32:46] cost me that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:32:48] people are completely confused
[1:32:53] you know the sad part is the adults know
[1:32:56] better
[1:32:57] but when they start they're telling
[1:32:58] their kids well maybe you're not a boy

[1:33:23] furnace
[1:33:25] that's right except thou repent
[1:33:30] and i only say accept thou repent
[1:33:32] because i believe there's still grace
[1:33:36] still on the throne one that he won't be
[1:33:39] and then that part will be taken out
[1:33:42] amen
[1:33:44] without faith in god without faith it's
[1:33:47] impossible to please him for he that
[1:33:50] comes to god
[1:33:51] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:33:54] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:33:56] him
[1:33:57] praise the lord
[1:34:00] by faith noah let's look at another hero

[1:34:14] saving of his house
[1:34:15] by which he obtained i condemned the
[1:34:17] world and became the heir of
[1:34:19] righteousness which is by
[1:34:20] faith they made a copy of
[1:34:24] noah's ark is it northern kentucky
[1:34:26] brother troy

[1:34:52] they had but anyway
[1:34:54] pull the stuff up there way
[1:34:57] up on top of the hill isn't that right
[1:34:59] can you imagine what the people must
[1:35:01] have thought
[1:35:02] you'd have thought that he built it by
[1:35:04] the river
[1:35:05] or by the ocean but he built it
[1:35:10] and built it and built it
[1:35:13] and built it 30 years 40 years
[1:35:16] 50 years 60 years 70 years

[1:35:23] you held out folks i want to tell you
[1:35:26] something right now i really
[1:35:28] admire people who hold out
[1:35:31] i can follow footprints that keep
[1:35:34] walking in the sand
[1:35:35] that keep pressing on in christ
[1:35:38] my soul has no pleasure in those that
[1:35:40] draw back
[1:35:43] amen noah he had faith
[1:35:47] he had a revelation that god was going
[1:35:49] to do what
[1:35:50] that it was going to rain that he was
[1:35:52] going to flood the flood the whole earth
[1:35:54] god said i'm going to destroy the man
[1:35:55] with some flood
[1:35:56] there's a big flood coming
[1:35:59] our prophet prophesied that america he
[1:36:02] seen nothing but
[1:36:02] burnt over smoldering ashes slumps and
[1:36:05] everything
[1:36:06] blowed all two pieces
[1:36:09] that's what he saw i mean knows that's
[1:36:12] what i see
[1:36:13] that's what i believe that's what you
[1:36:15] believe
[1:36:16] when you have faith in god's word you
[1:36:19] see what's coming

[1:36:28] during the week you stay close to god
[1:36:30] you prepare for what's coming
[1:36:36] every true christian looks ahead
[1:36:39] faith is a long-range vision it don't
[1:36:42] just
[1:36:42] look at how much money you got in the
[1:36:44] bank
[1:36:46] it looks much further than that it looks
[1:36:48] about where your soul's gonna be
[1:36:50] when all of that money ain't gonna help
[1:36:52] you one bit
[1:36:54] where is your soul gonna be
[1:36:59] taking your last breath we're not gonna
[1:37:01] ask you how much money you made
[1:37:02] we're gonna ask you what you did for god
[1:37:05] how did
[1:37:06] you serve god with the breath that you
[1:37:07] had how close was you
[1:37:09] did you please god amen
[1:37:13] let me tell you something if everybody
[1:37:15] will do that one thing and that includes
[1:37:17] myself
[1:37:18] i'll not have to preach on hardly
[1:37:20] anything
[1:37:24] just please god everything will be fine
[1:37:29] how many of those is when you get away
[1:37:31] from that when you do things that's not
[1:37:33] pleasing to god
[1:37:35] then i got to come up there you say you
[1:37:37] love god and you do this and you do that
[1:37:39] come on people
[1:37:40] that's what the rebuke of god was in
[1:37:42] this whole generation
[1:37:46] amen somebody must have been praying for
[1:37:49] service this morning
[1:37:51] i know i was say lord help me amen
[1:37:55] [Applause]
[1:37:57] because sometimes
[1:38:01] sometimes it's tough it gets tough to
[1:38:04] preach up here once in a while
[1:38:06] most of the time it's easy and i thank
[1:38:08] you people for that
[1:38:09] i think i've got a great group of people
[1:38:11] we've got a great group of people here
[1:38:13] amen i believe god's in it
[1:38:16] don't you it's important that you
[1:38:19] believe that because otherwise we're
[1:38:20] just another church
[1:38:22] just another church when i look at our
[1:38:25] history when i look at what god
[1:38:26] the rivers that god has brought us the
[1:38:28] walls that he's for taking us over
[1:38:31] i couldn't even begin to stop i can't
[1:38:33] begin to tell you
[1:38:35] brother brian he's been there a long i
[1:38:37] thought about him this morning
[1:38:38] he don't like to be talked about but i'm
[1:38:40] gonna talk about him a little bit this
[1:38:41] morning
[1:38:42] when i think about a rock brother brian

[1:39:00] you to the side and and whisper a bunch
[1:39:02] of lies to you
[1:39:04] in all of our faults the thing of it is
[1:39:06] we have faults
[1:39:08] we're not perfect neither was israel
[1:39:11] that's exactly why they wanted that
[1:39:12] prophet to curse them look at all their
[1:39:14] faults look at their backside look at
[1:39:16] all their faults
[1:39:17] you get to look at that and you think
[1:39:18] there ain't no god there god ain't there
[1:39:20] and everything else
[1:39:21] the devil can detract you by that
[1:39:27] but what is it what are we trying to do
[1:39:30] what is our achievement what is our goal
[1:39:33] it's just simply letting god
[1:39:34] live in our lives having his way
[1:39:38] folk god wasn't even intending to say
[1:39:39] that but it just came out is that okay
[1:39:42] i believe you got to have confidence in
[1:39:43] your church you're going to have
[1:39:45] confidence you're in your
[1:39:47] your imperfect pastor

[1:40:01] or you ain't getting nothing you still
[1:40:03] got to believe above all the faults and
[1:40:04] everything else he's a man of god

[1:40:14] that's what the prophet said
[1:40:17] folks i tell you right now when i see
[1:40:22] here things that the prophet said
[1:40:25] sometime i'm going to do it i'm going to

[1:40:28] here just
[1:40:28] the things that the prophet said that we
[1:40:30] really need to still come up to
[1:40:33] there's a lot there not just legalism
[1:40:36] about your dress this that or the other
[1:40:37] but it's about how we serve the lord our
[1:40:40] prayer life

[1:41:49] i'm gonna i'm gonna describe this the
[1:41:52] way that i've had several dreams already
[1:41:55] i've had i i dream a lot and i've
[1:41:58] had my wife practically get on the side
[1:42:00] of the bed
[1:42:02] and get on her prayer bones and pray
[1:42:04] because i was praying for my mother to
[1:42:06] get the holy ghost in my dreams so
[1:42:08] heavy jesus even the atmosphere was
[1:42:11] heavy with the holy spirit and she just
[1:42:13] what am i supposed to do here
[1:42:17] and i have many dreams of going in the
[1:42:19] actual translation and going up into
[1:42:21] heaven and
[1:42:22] and saying this is what the prophet said
[1:42:24] that in a good great
[1:42:25] church service where the holy spirit is
[1:42:27] it's just that but multiplied a million
[1:42:30] times
[1:42:30] and i was going up and going up saying
[1:42:33] oh praise be to god i was just going
[1:42:35] interrupt it was a wonderful thing
[1:42:37] amen but i have to be honest with you
[1:42:40] i've had other dreams
[1:42:43] to where i watched a nuclear blast and
[1:42:46] then this nuclear blast that
[1:42:47] dust that turns up and it was coming my
[1:42:50] way
[1:42:51] huh nuclear explosion it's coming my way
[1:42:55] wiping
[1:42:56] everything out coming and i knew this is
[1:42:57] the end
[1:42:59] that's the way it is for people who are
[1:43:01] left here hello
[1:43:05] one person is going to pull that trigger
[1:43:08] according to the prophet god and there's
[1:43:10] going to be a missile come up there
[1:43:11] piccadilla on the radar
[1:43:13] and they'll send another one and it'll
[1:43:14] cause a chain reaction
[1:43:16] and the whole world become annihilated
[1:43:18] just completely burnt over
[1:43:20] and man people will see them little sky
[1:43:22] things going through the air
[1:43:24] and then they'll see the big bombs
[1:43:26] busting and they'll hear it
[1:43:29] it'll burn this place to exactly what
[1:43:31] the scripture said that it would do
[1:43:34] amen even to bursting the earth open to
[1:43:36] where the volcanics
[1:43:38] will come forth those volcanics
[1:43:40] yellowstone how many knows that the
[1:43:42] yellowstone they talk about yellowstone
[1:43:43] they'd ever go out and
[1:43:44] completely wipe out america super
[1:43:47] volcanoes
[1:43:49] it won't be hard for god to create a new
[1:43:51] heaven and new earth
[1:43:52] it won't be hard for him but create a
[1:43:54] new eden for us to walk
[1:43:56] out on amen

[1:45:46] but no doubt the names were coming
[1:45:48] picked him up amen come and grabbed him
[1:45:52] took his last breath and the spirit came
[1:45:54] out

[1:46:18] he didn't meet the lord he had
[1:46:20] confidence
[1:46:21] he knew that the one had begun to work
[1:46:23] in him was able to finish it
[1:46:26] amen i don't know why i got on that but
[1:46:29] maybe somebody needed a little
[1:46:30] encouragement
[1:46:32] amen praise the lord you love the lord
[1:46:38] abraham look for a city
[1:46:41] which have foundations look way ahead
[1:46:45] there's a new city that's being built
[1:46:47] just for you and me how many believes
[1:46:48] that
[1:46:49] i believe many believes there's a better
[1:46:51] land for us
[1:46:54] i thought about dramatizing a little bit
[1:46:57] i'm telling you there's a group of
[1:46:59] people on the earth that has actually
[1:47:01] found a place
[1:47:02] a great wonderful place they're all
[1:47:04] planning on going to it
[1:47:06] huh no politics everybody's free and so
[1:47:10] forth
[1:47:11] and you know what that's what you and i
[1:47:12] are doing we're looking for a place
[1:47:14] there's a group of people here getting
[1:47:15] ready to leave we're looking for a land
[1:47:18] like
[1:47:18] abraham did listen to what he says
[1:47:21] truly if they had been mindful of that
[1:47:23] country from whence they came out
[1:47:25] they might have had the opportunity to
[1:47:27] have returned
[1:47:28] but now they desire a better country
[1:47:30] that is and heavenly
[1:47:33] wherefore god is not ashamed to be
[1:47:35] called their god folks i want to tell
[1:47:37] you
[1:47:37] if your whole ambition or your goal is
[1:47:40] for that city and to be with god
[1:47:42] god is not ashamed to call be called
[1:47:44] your god amen
[1:47:46] for he hath prepared for them a
[1:47:49] city amen moses
[1:47:53] i love the hero moses because he was
[1:47:56] supposed to be
[1:47:58] the next pharaoh let's say he was in the
[1:48:00] prime of his life
[1:48:01] he was up next to rule all of egypt
[1:48:06] that's probably god said he would have
[1:48:07] had every kind of a pleasure that you
[1:48:09] could ever have thought of
[1:48:12] people fanning him never too hot not too
[1:48:14] cold the best food you could drink of
[1:48:16] everything that you flesh goodness out
[1:48:18] he had it all right there and he threw
[1:48:20] it all away
[1:48:23] to go and take parts with the slaves
[1:48:26] because he counted it greater riches to
[1:48:29] be part of them than it was to be all to
[1:48:31] enjoy
[1:48:32] all the pleasures of sin and of egypt
[1:48:36] are you a witness to hey i don't care
[1:48:38] about the world's pleasures
[1:48:40] and all of that i just want whatever the
[1:48:42] lord wants me to have
[1:48:44] i would rather be identified with
[1:48:47] believers
[1:48:50] i'd rather be called a holy roller
[1:48:53] fanatic whatever you want to call me
[1:48:55] but to be a part of god than to pledge
[1:48:58] enjoy all the pleasures of this leader
[1:49:00] sia
[1:49:02] because i'm here to tell you folks you
[1:49:04] got to watch this thing this thing is
[1:49:06] like i said
[1:49:07] everything is geared to drown you
[1:49:09] spiritually
[1:49:11] all the pleasures is out there
[1:49:13] completely legal
[1:49:15] they're thinking of even legalizing
[1:49:17] prostitution we know
[1:49:18] canada we know it has had that for a
[1:49:20] long time right brother joe
[1:49:22] we was up there and man it was vulgar
[1:49:26] amen i don't even want to describe it
[1:49:28] not even right to speak of it but
[1:49:30] there we were living in an apartment and
[1:49:32] things were going on man you know
[1:49:33] terrible
[1:49:34] now they want to bring that and say it's
[1:49:36] all legal folks i'm telling you the
[1:49:37] devil is legalizing sin and people that
[1:49:39] want to go that way
[1:49:40] can but not me not you
[1:49:43] we are no part of that mess
[1:49:47] we want to keep ourselves unspotted from
[1:49:49] the world
[1:49:50] right in our hearts how many beliefs you
[1:49:52] got to be right
[1:49:54] in your heart pleasing to the lord
[1:49:59] and the one thing in closing if you want
[1:50:01] to stand with me
[1:50:04] i want you to think about this that as
[1:50:07] you
[1:50:08] become a prayer warrior you get closer
[1:50:10] to god
[1:50:11] and as we live the rest of our lives
[1:50:13] here
[1:50:14] how many this morning would take a good
[1:50:17] look at yourself
[1:50:20] and can you say that you know the
[1:50:22] footprints that i'm making
[1:50:24] another could follow i'm making
[1:50:27] footprints
[1:50:28] i'm making walking in a way that others
[1:50:30] can follow it
[1:50:35] think about that because we
[1:50:38] are following footprints and somebody's
