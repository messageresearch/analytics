[20:50] brother Brian
[21:05] morning brothers and
[21:10] sisters I still I'm not getting over
[21:12] that picture that was up there between
[21:14] me and
[21:16] Janette I was going to say something but
[21:19] I I was just saying it's like having a
[21:20] gorilla next to a I I'll leave that on
[21:23] I'll leave the other part on said
[21:29] if you would I was uh looking on that
[21:32] thing let me take this out this
[21:37] morning if you turn with me one of the
[21:40] scriptures up there this morning was
[21:43] Matthew the sixth chapter if you could
[21:46] go to about the N 18th verse this is
[21:51] totally off what I was point this
[21:53] morning
[21:56] but let me I got these two things I
[21:59] printed out this morning off of that
[22:02] tablet but the one of the messages for
[22:07] today
[22:09] um that happened on February 9th the
[22:12] last one on February 9th was the
[22:14] countdown and I'll get into this chapter
[22:17] but I was thinking of that message to
[22:18] countdown where brother brandham was
[22:21] talking about the natural world how it
[22:23] never stays in one place it keeps it's
[22:26] moving to a destination one day and we
[22:29] all know what that destination is
[22:31] there's come like brother Thomas was
[22:33] talking about on Wednesday we're coming
[22:35] to that point where the whole world is
[22:38] going to be shaking and then the
[22:40] revelation of who Jesus Christ really is
[22:42] is about to happen on the face of the
[22:44] Earth do I know the day or the hour no
[22:47] but you can see the season we're in that
[22:50] season right now this morning and I was
[22:52] thinking about that message how the
[22:55] world progresses in the natural sense
[22:57] you know they went from like brother
[22:59] Bram would talk about from the wheel all
[23:01] the way to the rocket and the world out
[23:04] there is the same
[23:06] way and the church is the same way and I
[23:10] was just thinking
[23:12] how much we actually myself I can only
[23:17] speak for my how we live below our
[23:19] privileges this morning in the word of
[23:22] God and in the presence of Jesus Christ
[23:24] we don't realize how privileged we are
[23:27] this morning to have the Revelation for
[23:29] the hour before us and have the ability
[23:32] for a living God to move through your
[23:35] heart and through your life to bring
[23:36] about changes whether they're physical
[23:38] or spiritual and I was thinking this
[23:41] morning
[23:44] um as we look at the you can look at the
[23:47] current condition of the world and
[23:49] brother brandham said what the way the
[23:51] world is the way the church is so we
[23:53] know that outside of the Living Church
[23:57] there's no hope this morning morning but
[23:59] going to this uh chapter here I was just
[24:02] thinking kind of speaks for the thing I
[24:05] have this one from last Sunday too that
[24:07] I would get I was going to get into but
[24:09] starting about the 18th verse because
[24:12] I'm a firm believer you can never read
[24:13] God's word enough and and I I found out
[24:17] I say this a lot I know I don't mean to
[24:20] but I found out if you if you pray and
[24:23] stay quiet and and when you get to that
[24:26] spot where you're quiet now for some
[24:28] people that's different some people
[24:30] takes hours just to get quiet enough
[24:33] that they can read the word of God and
[24:35] it means or touches your heart it really
[24:38] speaks to you some people can do it in
[24:41] little time at all but starting about
[24:43] the 18th verse it says that thou appear
[24:46] not onto men to fast but unto Father
[24:49] which is in secret love he's talking
[24:51] about when you fast and when you do your
[24:54] arms and it goes back to what David was
[24:56] saying in that psalm whenever you do
[24:59] those things for the Lord Jesus is
[25:02] saying you're not supposed to do it
[25:04] before men but you're supposed to do it
[25:06] in secret and God will reward you openly
[25:09] so when you pray for people and when you
[25:11] fast for people and when you do things
[25:13] you I'm I'm a firm believer not to let
[25:15] the right hand know what the left hand's
[25:17] doing but I'll start at this 18th verse
[25:20] uh I'm in the wrong spot at the and then
[25:22] he goes on to say in the 19th verse lay
[25:25] not up for yourselves treasure upon
[25:27] Earth that's that's where the world's
[25:28] out this morning everyone wants
[25:30] Treasures in the earth and not Treasures
[25:32] in the heart where the morth and rust do
[25:35] corrupt and where the thieves break
[25:37] through and steal so we know in a
[25:39] natural sense you can get all the worth
[25:43] wealth in the world and someone can
[25:44] steal it from you you'll lose it when
[25:47] you die it doesn't mean anything but
[25:49] Jesus speaks here but but lay up for
[25:52] yourselves treasure in heaven with
[25:54] neither moth nor rust do corrupt where
[25:57] thieves do not break in nor steal so you
[26:01] know if you lose your experience or you
[26:03] you lose your Revelation you don't lose
[26:06] it because someone stole it from you you
[26:09] let you let it disappear from yourself
[26:11] and it goes on for there your Treasures
[26:13] is that's where your heart be also and
[26:15] that's what I was thinking about what
[26:18] brother brownon was talking about this
[26:19] morning and what I was
[26:22] listening I can when you when you're
[26:25] alone by yourself
[26:28] I know I say this a lot and I I don't
[26:31] apolog I can't say it enough when you
[26:34] find those thoughts possessing your mind
[26:36] and your spirit that's who you really
[26:38] are so whe if you can't get control of
[26:42] those thoughts or those spirits that try
[26:44] to get a hold of you if you find
[26:46] yourself continually doing the same
[26:48] thing you got to realize if you can
[26:51] realize that's who you really are then
[26:53] you can change and I'll keep reading
[26:55] here for where your treasure is that's
[26:58] where your heart be also the Light of
[27:01] the body is the eye and therefore thine
[27:03] eye be single the whole body should be
[27:05] full of light so if you got light you're
[27:08] going to project light but if thy eye be
[27:10] evil thy whole body shall be full of
[27:12] darkness and if therefore the light is
[27:15] in thee be Darkness How Great is Thy
[27:18] Darkness so that's a pretty simple
[27:20] principle if you've got the Revelation
[27:23] you've got Christ in you the only thing
[27:25] that can come out of you is the light of
[27:26] the Gospel if you're holding on to
[27:28] Darkness and evil things sooner or later
[27:31] that's what you're going to project
[27:33] sooner or later and it goes on to say
[27:35] now no man can serve two and that's the
[27:37] scripture that was up there this morning
[27:40] now no man can serve two masses for he
[27:43] will either hate one or love the other
[27:44] or else he will hold to one and despise
[27:47] the other you cannot serve God and mmon
[27:51] Mammon I meant to say and you know as I
[27:55] get older you know this scripture this
[27:56] is being manest on the whole face of the
[27:59] Earth you can't you can't have both you
[28:02] only can have one and you're going to we
[28:04] all have to choose which what we're
[28:05] going to put more in our lives than the
[28:08] other and I'll just finish with a few of
[28:10] these
[28:11] verses and then I I'll jump into Timothy
[28:13] the second chapter 1 Timothy therefore I
[28:16] say unto you take no thought for your
[28:18] life what you shall eat or what you
[28:21] shall drink nor let your nor for your
[28:24] body but what you shall put on it is not
[28:28] life more than meat and the body more
[28:30] than rment you know doesn't mean you
[28:32] don't go to work the next day and you
[28:34] don't provide for your family but Jesus
[28:36] is giving you a principle here this
[28:38] morning you're not supposed to worry
[28:40] about those things you're supposed to
[28:43] put them in his hand and let him take is
[28:45] that an easy thing to do no that's not
[28:47] an easy thing to do sometimes I lost my
[28:51] place therefore I say unto you take no
[28:53] thought for your life what you shall eat
[28:55] or what you shall drink nor for your
[28:57] body but you shall put what you shall p
[29:00] is not your life more than meat and your
[29:01] body more than rment behold the fowls of
[29:04] the air for they s not neither do they
[29:07] reap nor gather into the barns yet
[29:09] Heavenly Father Feth them and are you
[29:12] not much more better than thee and then
[29:15] I'm not going to continue reading but I
[29:17] was just thinking this morning that as I
[29:20] was looking at that that principle
[29:22] doesn't change if I haven't lost my
[29:24] place here second Timothy the uh 2
[29:27] chapter
[29:30] but I was reading this this is another
[29:32] one from last
[29:34] week and
[29:36] uh brother brandham was talking in this
[29:38] message let me just read these
[29:40] scriptures here this morning in the
[29:42] second chapter of uh Second Timothy and
[29:47] Paul says here thou thou therefore my
[29:50] son being strong in the grace that is in
[29:52] Christ Jesus and all things that thou
[29:55] has heard of me among many witnesses the
[29:58] same I commit to thou to Faithful Men
[30:01] Who Shall be able to teach others also
[30:04] and I was thinking about this third
[30:06] scripture right here that's where we're
[30:08] at in our today and he goes on to say
[30:11] that thou therefore endure hardness as a
[30:14] good soldier of Jesus Christ no man
[30:17] worth entangle himself with the Affairs
[30:19] of this life that he may please him who
[30:22] has chosen him to be a soldier so
[30:24] basically Paul's saying here once God
[30:27] has chosen you to do something you can't
[30:29] worry about the circumstances that are
[30:31] around you just commit yourself to the
[30:34] whole purpose that God has for you this
[30:36] morning whatever that purpose be
[30:38] everyone has a purpose that God has
[30:40] given you and I know the pastors and the
[30:43] teachers have come across here telling
[30:45] you that you have to get you have to
[30:47] learn what your purpose what God's goal
[30:49] for you in your life is and once you
[30:51] know and God has witnessed to you that
[30:54] that's your purpose then you have the
[30:55] strength to go out in your life and be
[30:58] successful I'm not
[30:59] worry every day about whether you're
[31:01] where you're supposed to be and he goes
[31:03] on to say here I lost my place and any
[31:06] man
[31:07] also strive for Mastery yet he is not
[31:10] crowned except he strive
[31:12] lawfully basically he's saying you got
[31:14] to play by the rules you can't get ahead
[31:17] without playing by the rules uh that's a
[31:19] simple way of saying it the husband that
[31:21] lath must first be partakers of the
[31:23] fruit and consider what I say and the
[31:26] lord giveth thee understanding in all
[31:28] things and he goes on the remember Jesus
[31:32] Christ the seed of David was raised from
[31:34] the dead according to my gospel and I'll
[31:36] stop there but I was reading this
[31:40] thing from the uh the tablet last week
[31:43] and this is what brother Bram had to say
[31:46] and it really struck my heart about this
[31:49] thought he goes on to say here and this
[31:51] is in the
[31:52] resurrection there's got to be a time
[31:55] where you got to quit babying people and
[31:57] not
[31:58] I I believe in my I can only think about
[32:01] myself there's a time where you got to
[32:03] stop babying yourself and be a strong
[32:05] Christian and walk out in faith you
[32:08] can't sissify them that's what the
[32:10] trouble is today especially out in the
[32:12] churches of the world they're trying to
[32:14] lead them by the hand everywhere like
[32:15] their children instead of just preaching
[32:17] the gospel and let it change their
[32:19] hearts and lives they want to lead them
[32:22] all the way through it and it doesn't
[32:23] work that way and preachers in handling
[32:26] the gospel with
[32:28] e ecclesiastic gloves on and that's what
[32:31] the trouble of it is today and it can be
[32:34] the same in a Methodist Church or in a
[32:36] world church people have to be men and
[32:39] women in Christ you have to be strong in
[32:41] the Lord It's you can't get away it goes
[32:44] on that's what the trouble of it is
[32:46] today what we need today is raw flat
[32:49] gospel to tell you that you're a sinner
[32:51] going to hell and you can forget about
[32:53] that out in the world they don't they
[32:55] don't like telling that simple Brimstone
[32:58] and fire type of pre preaching that they
[33:01] don't like that too much if you haven't
[33:03] got the Holy Ghost you're out of the
[33:05] Kingdom how how often do you hear that
[33:08] out in the world I'll read that again if
[33:11] you haven't got the Holy Ghost you're
[33:12] out of the
[33:13] kingdom of God that's right you can't
[33:16] believe the you can't believe the
[33:18] supernatural because you have never been
[33:20] born again that that experience is
[33:23] together he's saying and you're born
[33:25] again you have to believe the
[33:26] supernatural because you're Supernatural
[33:29] yourself and I just wrote this note to
[33:31] myself sorry about
[33:34] that and I was just thinking this is
[33:37] what and this this thought came out of
[33:40] investments in 1963 January
[33:45] 26 but brother brownon was talking you
[33:49] meet God
[33:51] exactly like you
[33:53] are your death doesn't change who you
[33:55] are and what what I wrote is when you
[33:58] meet God you meet the Lord as yourself
[34:01] but what we forget two things are absent
[34:03] when you go to the other
[34:06] side your body the physical self and the
[34:09] spirit that's on you right now when you
[34:11] take those two away you take your body
[34:14] away and you take your spirit away the
[34:17] only thing left is your soul and brother
[34:20] random taught continually the only thing
[34:23] that will abide in that soul is the unad
[34:27] alterated word of God that seed and all
[34:30] those virtues that you add upon it and I
[34:33] I think sometimes to myself if you take
[34:36] the spirit that that's in me you take
[34:38] that away and you take your body away
[34:42] what's left who are you really or who am
[34:44] I and sometimes I don't get worded but
[34:47] it's an awesome thought to think that
[34:49] one day we're all going to face God one
[34:52] day and The Superficial Spirit we have
[34:54] on us that hoty Spirit it won't be there
[34:56] that day whatever that Spirit we all
[34:58] have different Spirits brother vam
[35:00] taught that that won't be there on that
[35:02] and you won't have that physical body so
[35:04] when you get on the other side who are
[35:07] you going to be really who who's the
[35:09] real I can only speak for myself who's
[35:11] the real Brian Baldwin on that day and
[35:14] the only real Brian Baldwin can be the
[35:16] one that's been born through the word of
[35:18] God and those virtues that are in the
[35:20] scriptures laying me and I was just
[35:23] thinking the whole that's really an
[35:24] awesome thought when you think about it
[35:28] who you really are in life who you who
[35:32] are you or who am I I should be saying
[35:35] not you but who am I in the end who am I
[35:37] going to be on that day and I want to be
[35:40] that perfect Christian that the Bible
[35:42] talks about I want to lead my life in a
[35:45] way that I have those attributes I have
[35:47] the the things that I need to have on
[35:49] that day that's what I desire to have me
[35:52] on that day Brother David
[36:14] love the Lord this
[36:16] morning amen let's stand this morning if
[36:19] we could it's just good to be in the
[36:20] house for the Lord this morning and man

[38:13] Jesus well I gave him all of my
[38:18] heart and I thought I couldn't love him
[38:23] more than I did right from the start
[38:28] but when I look back over the
[38:32] mountains and The

[1:16:04] everybody loosening up oh yeah praise
[1:16:07] the Lord God is good isn't he amen amen
[1:16:10] so just trying to follow the leading of
[1:16:12] the spirit this morning amen uh
[1:16:14] yesterday just praying Lord what you
[1:16:16] have and amen and uh couple of times
[1:16:19] praying there on my desk and just bowing
[1:16:21] my head say Lord I don't know which
[1:16:23] which which way you want me to go but
[1:16:25] just lead me and guide me amen and so
[1:16:28] about the second time I prayed like that
[1:16:30] he just kind of give me this amen and I
[1:16:32] just like brother brandham said God will
[1:16:34] give you something and then you'll just
[1:16:36] kind of keep on that thought and then if
[1:16:38] God multiplies that and just you know
[1:16:40] then go that direction and so that's how
[1:16:42] we feel to go this morning Hebrews 13
[1:16:45] and verse 8 very familiar scripture to
[1:16:49] us isn't that right amen praise the Lord
[1:16:53] Jesus Christ the same
[1:16:55] yesterday today and forever amen may God
[1:16:59] add His blessings to the reading of the
[1:17:01] word you can be seated this morning amen
[1:17:05] amen we want to dwell for a little bit
[1:17:06] with the help of the Lord and we want to
[1:17:08] try to uh just try to try to ask the
[1:17:11] Holy Spirit just to take some of these
[1:17:13] thoughts and things that I've got wrote
[1:17:14] down here and try to put it together the
[1:17:16] way that he wants to put together amen
[1:17:18] so we will see this and this of course
[1:17:21] we know this was the SE theme of the
[1:17:24] prophet of God and his generation wasn't
[1:17:25] it amen and I love the message where
[1:17:28] brother Bram talked about how that and
[1:17:29] he he he he he preaches a message called
[1:17:32] lifting him up out of History ain't that
[1:17:36] right lifting him up out of History amen
[1:17:39] and making him the same yesterday today
[1:17:42] and forever now anytime that I begin to
[1:17:45] think about God when I begin to think
[1:17:47] about how great God is and well when you
[1:17:50] just think about God you're thinking
[1:17:51] about the right thing ain't that right
[1:17:54] and so I begin to think of how perfect
[1:17:57] that God is that he's the same he don't
[1:18:01] never have to
[1:18:03] change God never
[1:18:06] changes now he changes his uh uh
[1:18:10] dwelling place isn't that right he
[1:18:12] changes his
[1:18:15] mask yeah he changes his mask he changes
[1:18:18] Amen in in whom he dwells and just in
[1:18:20] the last few weeks you know I I I've
[1:18:23] been thinking about one thing that the
[1:18:24] Lord's kind of quickened to me is how
[1:18:26] that how that we're such a blessed
[1:18:28] people to think that we are still how
[1:18:31] many knows that we are still fallible
[1:18:33] people we're still
[1:18:36] failures we still have faults we have
[1:18:40] failures and you would think God
[1:18:42] wouldn't use somebody like that but yet
[1:18:46] he
[1:18:46] does Amen in all of our failures God
[1:18:50] still uses us and I don't think that God
[1:18:54] would keep using us if we make those
[1:18:57] failures amen and we fell short amen and
[1:19:00] then we didn't repent of that or as God
[1:19:02] to forgive us how many times you'll see
[1:19:05] brother benam talking or you hear him
[1:19:07] talking about God talking and saying God
[1:19:09] forgive us of our shortcomings our
[1:19:11] failures forgive you forgive your
[1:19:13] unworthy servant and so forth amen but
[1:19:17] this awesome God that he would actually
[1:19:19] use
[1:19:23] you use you
[1:19:25] dwell in you and dwell in
[1:19:29] me amen and actually use our vessels use
[1:19:32] our lips use our heart use our mind to
[1:19:36] manifest the light to the world
[1:19:40] Amen it blows my mind how that God can
[1:19:44] never think a wrong
[1:19:46] thought how many knows all of his
[1:19:49] thoughts are perfect the first time and
[1:19:52] it fascinates me because I know that I
[1:19:54] sure don't how many knows when you're on
[1:19:56] a project or you're fixing to do
[1:19:58] something you probably try to think of
[1:20:00] it in every manner or way that you can
[1:20:03] possibly think of it especially if
[1:20:05] you're in construction or what what
[1:20:07] you're doing is what's the best way to
[1:20:09] do
[1:20:11] this amen a lot of time me and my boys
[1:20:13] get in an argument because no we want to
[1:20:15] do it this way this is how no this is
[1:20:17] how you do it this is a better way
[1:20:20] Dad and I'm the oldfashioned way hey you
[1:20:23] know it's been my way is to
[1:20:27] best but I come to find out and he says
[1:20:29] okay let's go ahead and do that and then
[1:20:31] I realize hey you know that really was
[1:20:35] better I'll tell you what I think we're
[1:20:37] in trouble when we think that we are
[1:20:39] always
[1:20:40] right amen and the other person's always
[1:20:42] wrong and we're prone we're programmed
[1:20:44] that way and if you can't give in you're
[1:20:48] not going to be a person that's easy to
[1:20:50] get along
[1:20:51] with if you don't give a little ain't
[1:20:53] that right if you don't think so get
[1:20:55] married and find
[1:21:00] out that's right get married you'll find
[1:21:02] out there's got to be a little give and
[1:21:04] take here
[1:21:05] folks a little bit of understanding but
[1:21:08] anyway that's a downal rabbit Trail
[1:21:10] praise the Lord but I like this because
[1:21:12] God he can't never when he thinks
[1:21:13] something gets a perfect thought how we
[1:21:16] can how we can rejoice in that knowing
[1:21:20] that he thought of you didn't the
[1:21:21] prophet say he thought of you sitting
[1:21:23] there this morning morning he thought of
[1:21:26] you and he knew the clothes that you
[1:21:28] would be wearing this
[1:21:30] morning he knew that you would come here
[1:21:32] this morning he knew what I would preach
[1:21:35] this morning before the first Stardust
[1:21:38] was ever made that's how perfect God is
[1:21:42] this Maring story is about how changing
[1:21:46] we are how a changing world that we live
[1:21:49] in ain't that right when you think about
[1:21:52] even our democracy and our forefathers
[1:21:55] D wrote up the Constitution and boy they
[1:21:57] had it down and oh boy we're going to
[1:21:59] have we had a great nation out of it but
[1:22:01] we've seen that all fall
[1:22:03] apart ain't that
[1:22:06] right that's right even that changes
[1:22:09] Nations change people change times
[1:22:12] change
[1:22:14] amen but God don't
[1:22:21] change amen his word he don't know never
[1:22:24] have to take his word back to his
[1:22:27] unfailing words of
[1:22:30] Promise amen perfect
[1:22:32] thoughts amen never has to change his
[1:22:35] mind only changes his
[1:22:38] form and how many knows that God lives
[1:22:41] in
[1:22:42] Simplicity brother Braham said God will
[1:22:44] never be in big things and Glamour and
[1:22:46] all of that God dwells in humility how
[1:22:49] many believes if you're a Christian this
[1:22:51] morning then you need to live a simple
[1:22:54] humble Christian Life That's where God
[1:22:59] is I'm not don't know about you but I
[1:23:01] want to know where God dwells so that I
[1:23:04] can find that
[1:23:06] place amen because so many people miss
[1:23:09] this unchanging God they miss him amen
[1:23:13] and how do they miss him by serving a
[1:23:16] historical
[1:23:18] God a his a god of History a god of the
[1:23:23] past and not a god of the
[1:23:26] present how many glad this morning that
[1:23:29] he is the same this very second as he
[1:23:34] was before he hung the first
[1:23:37] star he hasn't changed one
[1:23:41] bit he's alive and
[1:23:45] well amen oh my when I begin to think
[1:23:49] about this let me just let me lay a
[1:23:52] little foundation with the help of the
[1:23:53] Lord
[1:23:56] just start here I didn't I didn't want
[1:23:59] to well we're just going to follow the
[1:24:01] leading of the spirit they ain't worried
[1:24:04] about the clock back there or anything
[1:24:05] is that all
[1:24:07] right butam says so I feel so bad today
[1:24:10] when people try to make God something in
[1:24:12] a
[1:24:13] history he said what he says I want to
[1:24:16] ask you something what good is a god of
[1:24:19] History if he isn't the same
[1:24:22] today one place want to try to pull it
[1:24:25] up but I remember he says man if it's if
[1:24:27] he's just a god of a day gone by you
[1:24:30] better you might as well study
[1:24:32] agriculture science or or something like
[1:24:35] that you'd be better off in some other
[1:24:37] program than just a God that's not even
[1:24:40] alive anymore he's just a historical
[1:24:43] God don't mean
[1:24:47] anything think about it that's
[1:24:50] right
[1:24:52] notice listen he's not is the god of
[1:24:55] History altogether he's the same today
[1:24:57] how can people claim him to be something
[1:25:00] that was and isn't now how many knows
[1:25:04] that during brother bram's time a mean
[1:25:06] there was so much going forth and so
[1:25:08] much Bible schools teaching them that
[1:25:11] Mark 16 from a certain verse on wasn't
[1:25:14] even inspired the Holy Ghost was just
[1:25:16] for the
[1:25:17] apostles the apostolic days are
[1:25:23] gone wow what a
[1:25:26] teaching how many knows it's important
[1:25:28] what you're
[1:25:29] taught amen it's very important about
[1:25:33] what you're taught
[1:25:39] amen another place says it this way I
[1:25:42] don't mean to hurt too bad but I want to
[1:25:44] settle this down to a place where you
[1:25:46] will get to thinking what good is a god
[1:25:49] of Moses if he isn't the same God today
[1:25:52] what good is a historical God amen if he
[1:25:55] isn't the same in power
[1:25:58] today amen then he says what good would
[1:26:01] it do to show if you uh take a freezing
[1:26:05] man that was freezing to death and you
[1:26:08] met him in the street and he was
[1:26:10] freezing and you took him a big picture
[1:26:13] of a fire so I just at the end there I
[1:26:17] talk told Siri pull me up a picture of a
[1:26:21] fire serving a historic God God that is
[1:26:25] the same today anymore hello a god of
[1:26:29] the past he said it's like meeting a
[1:26:33] freezing man out in subzero weather and
[1:26:37] going up to him and saying hey guess
[1:26:39] what I got something for you I got
[1:26:42] something yesterday man we had the
[1:26:44] biggest bonfire you ever saw look at
[1:26:48] that huh see put your put your hand up
[1:26:51] there get it close warm warm your hand
[1:26:56] he tell you idiot get away from
[1:26:58] me right why it doesn't do any good it's
[1:27:02] like a paint of fire showing a freezing
[1:27:05] man a paint of fire if we're just
[1:27:07] talking about a god of
[1:27:12] yesterday
[1:27:14] amen how many's glad to serve the Living
[1:27:18] God I'm going to tell you something
[1:27:21] [Applause]
[1:27:24] there are way too many so-called
[1:27:26] Christians that just serve a historical
[1:27:29] God their eyes are in the rear view
[1:27:32] mirror of what Luther did what Wesley
[1:27:34] did what Pentecost did hello or even
[1:27:38] what God did through the prophet amen
[1:27:40] that was mighty but that God has to come
[1:27:42] and inhabit this place you've got to
[1:27:45] have that same fire in your heart that
[1:27:48] they had or it don't do you any

[1:30:44] right that's the same way with this cold
[1:30:47] world that we're living
[1:30:49] in people that just serve churches that
[1:30:52] just serve Luther Wesley or some day
[1:30:54] going by amen they're never going to
[1:30:57] give anybody any help they're not going
[1:31:00] to bring warmth to
[1:31:02] it
[1:31:03] amen final quote on this thought amen
[1:31:08] listen if he isn't alive
[1:31:11] tonight and with us as he has
[1:31:15] promised amen how many knows that Jesus
[1:31:18] left one time it is expedient that I go
[1:31:22] away but if I go away I will will come
[1:31:24] again how many believes that he did come
[1:31:27] again and I want you to know something
[1:31:30] he has never left that's right God has
[1:31:34] never
[1:31:36] left and he won't
[1:31:39] leave he won't leave until it's all
[1:31:43] done cuz he promised lo I Am With You
[1:31:49] Always how many's glad that you're not
[1:31:52] alone you're not by yourself we're not
[1:31:56] [Applause]
[1:31:59] alone what is it we're anchored to
[1:32:01] something in a world that's
[1:32:04] changing age changes
[1:32:06] us young and youth is a lie health and
[1:32:11] strength is a lie why because you get
[1:32:13] old you get feeble amen as you get older
[1:32:16] amen you got to have blood pressure this
[1:32:18] and blood pressure that and oh man
[1:32:20] everything about us amen begins to amen
[1:32:22] what you might call crash our computer
[1:32:25] begins to crash things go
[1:32:27] wrong I remember when I was 20 years old
[1:32:30] still out in the world and a guy came up
[1:32:33] to
[1:32:34] me and said you know all of that greasy
[1:32:37] chicken and all that other stuff that
[1:32:38] you're eating you ought to eat that and
[1:32:41] I said oh really cuz I love that chicken
[1:32:43] with the skin on and all that I love
[1:32:46] that he says oh never mind you're just
[1:32:47] 20 years old you ain't got nothing to
[1:32:48] worry about never mind why cuz he was
[1:32:51] old he had to watch what he eat but when
[1:32:54] you're strong you can get away with a
[1:32:55] lot of that ain't that right but when
[1:32:57] you get old you got to watch your your
[1:32:59] diet has to change everything about it
[1:33:02] sometimes you got to take this pill that
[1:33:04] pill amen that changes but aren't you
[1:33:07] glad that you got a hold of something
[1:33:08] that don't
[1:33:11] change that he's there with you you're
[1:33:14] not by yourself you're with the one that
[1:33:16] is that was with Adam and Eve I mean as

[1:33:21] it goes back down comes up and goes back
[1:33:24] down and has been ever since the time of
[1:33:26] Eve times have changed amen but the god
[1:33:29] that made it has never
[1:33:32] changed amen praise be to

[1:34:06] miserable if you didn't have that Holy
[1:34:08] Spirit in your heart if you didn't have

[1:34:41] ourselves

[1:36:57] not anchored to
[1:36:59] anything I'm so glad this morning that
[1:37:02] when I was 20 years
[1:37:04] old Amen brother Ur and sister Martha I
[1:37:08] remember them working for them way back
[1:37:10] when I was that young age
[1:37:12] amen and there was an anchor that
[1:37:16] happened an
[1:37:19] anchored and anchored I've anchored
[1:37:24] in
[1:37:25] Jesus the storms of life I'll breath
[1:37:29] I've Anchored In Jesus I fear no window
[1:37:34] wave amen when you get anchored in this
[1:37:36] rock that is
[1:37:38] unmovable see Jesus says Heaven and
[1:37:40] Earth will pass away but my word it'll
[1:37:43] never pass away how many knows that even
[1:37:46] the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:37:48] heat even the sun that's been going out
[1:37:50] there for 6,000 years one day will be no
[1:37:54] more is that right in the new Heavens
[1:37:57] there's no need of the sun because the
[1:37:58] lamb is the light
[1:38:00] thereof but even that better said we'll
[1:38:03] outlive the sun outshine the sun in that
[1:38:07] eternal life will live longer than what
[1:38:09] the sun
[1:38:11] has even it'll pass away the Earth will
[1:38:14] pass away everything will pass away but
[1:38:17] my word shall not pass away
[1:38:24] how many beli that you are part of that
[1:38:26] word the only way you don't pass away is
[1:38:29] to uh be a part of that word Peter said
[1:38:32] in one chapter 1 Peter 1 and 23 that
[1:38:35] we're born again not of corruptible seed
[1:38:38] but of Incorruptible by the word of
[1:38:43] God Amen oh my I don't know about you
[1:38:47] but that means a lot to
[1:38:51] me see if I stayed on the course that I
[1:38:54] was with being raised I'd have been born
[1:38:58] well I was born
[1:39:00] Amish that
[1:39:02] right and I'd have been born a spiritual
[1:39:06] Amish man after a
[1:39:08] while CU at the age of 18 you're
[1:39:10] required to 18 19 that's been so long I
[1:39:14] forget exactly what age it is but you
[1:39:15] have a little age there that they let
[1:39:17] you go a little while for a while but
[1:39:19] then you straighten up and you become so
[1:39:22] so to speak New
[1:39:24] Creation New Birth you get
[1:39:27] baptized hello and join the
[1:39:32] church but you know I'm thankful that I
[1:39:36] Ain didn't have an Amish birth in that
[1:39:39] way because I know I I I I go back up
[1:39:43] and visit my cousin sometimes and then I
[1:39:44] go back with the Amish school boys that
[1:39:46] I went to school with I have lots of
[1:39:49] cousins that are there went over you
[1:39:50] know and met the little my young we were
[1:39:54] back young back then right and when I go
[1:39:56] meet them now they look older than their
[1:39:58] dad was when I remembered
[1:40:02] them I don't know I being Amish takes a
[1:40:05] toll on you I
[1:40:06] guess but I'm like you look like your
[1:40:09] dad or you know but you're my first
[1:40:11] cousin we're all old
[1:40:14] now and just a sta
[1:40:18] shamish huh
[1:40:20] staunch see when you how I me know when
[1:40:23] you give yourself to that that's what
[1:40:25] you
[1:40:26] become whatever church and whatever you
[1:40:29] believe you adapt and what you accept
[1:40:32] that's what you
[1:40:33] become why if you mentioned a God sent a
[1:40:36] prophet what are you talking about
[1:40:38] right if you would talk about Holiness
[1:40:41] or the baptism of the Holy Ghost their
[1:40:43] main commandment is that they obey the
[1:40:45] Elders of the church and so
[1:40:48] forth but it doesn't matter whether it's
[1:40:51] that you might have an arm birth you
[1:40:53] might have a menite birth you might have
[1:40:55] a Beamish
[1:40:58] birth huh all of these churches they're
[1:41:02] bringing forth
[1:41:03] children and like begets light the Bible
[1:41:07] says but to be a born of the word that's
[1:41:10] a whole different story how many knows
[1:41:12] amen we got to be born by
[1:41:15] what not bromite
[1:41:18] ISM hello but he pointed us to what he
[1:41:22] pointed us to the word you've got to
[1:41:25] have the word birth one of the first
[1:41:27] things he preaches the Bible says that
[1:41:30] you have got to be born again not just
[1:41:32] put your name on a book not just join a
[1:41:35] church ain't no church this church can't
[1:41:38] save nobody ain't no church got
[1:41:39] salvation in it brother B said only
[1:41:42] salvation in Jesus Christ that's the
[1:41:45] only place you'll find Salvation not
[1:41:48] because you belong to this that or the
[1:41:49] other church he straightened a a uh
[1:41:52] whether what being a member of the
[1:41:54] church he straightened that up he says
[1:41:56] Paul said by one Spirit are we all
[1:41:58] baptized into one body and members in
[1:42:02] particular if you want to become a
[1:42:03] member get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:07] it's the only way you'll ever be in the
[1:42:09] right church and that church is
[1:42:13] universal
[1:42:15] amen so God help
[1:42:18] us changing you talk about changing
[1:42:26] all
[1:42:28] right before I go into this let's just
[1:42:30] talk
[1:42:31] about how that all of creation all of
[1:42:37] nature the birds all of the animal
[1:42:40] kingdom don't they have an instinct
[1:42:42] given them by
[1:42:44] God you know the barn swallow I still
[1:42:47] have trouble with them they like to just
[1:42:48] build those little mud nests right on
[1:42:51] the side of my 2x2
[1:42:53] underneath the
[1:42:55] roof huh wouldn't it be weird brother
[1:42:58] Brad if I told you look I seen one
[1:43:00] building a nest out there on the on the
[1:43:03] telephone
[1:43:04] pole and guess what this crazy little
[1:43:06] bird he was so smart that he put these
[1:43:09] little put the mud walls up like and
[1:43:12] then he took sticks and put it in that
[1:43:14] mud right quick and then he made a
[1:43:16] little more mud and then he put leaves
[1:43:18] all over the top and he had him a little
[1:43:20] roof and in the back he actually formed
[1:43:23] a little little
[1:43:25] window and he's sitting in there all
[1:43:27] cozy
[1:43:30] and he's modified he
[1:43:33] modified he's
[1:43:36] growing you'd say brother boo now that's
[1:43:39] a real bird story it ain't a fishy story
[1:43:42] that's a real birdie
[1:43:44] story why because they
[1:43:47] don't all those birds they all do what
[1:43:50] God gave them the instinct to do what
[1:43:53] God placed in there they're still as the
[1:43:55] prophet of God they're still in their
[1:43:57] place but
[1:44:00] man how many knows we have to improve we
[1:44:04] have to
[1:44:06] grow that's why we can't stay in the
[1:44:08] same place weak after week month after
[1:44:10] month year after year decade after
[1:44:12] decade Millennial after
[1:44:14] Millennial man has to for progress and
[1:44:17] how we have
[1:44:19] progressed but there's a lot of them
[1:44:21] that just likes to stay in the back
[1:44:24] now see Ephesians says that and because
[1:44:26] of our lost State how many know it
[1:44:28] because of our lost State see god is
[1:44:31] perfect isin that right he's perfect and
[1:44:34] you and I thirst for
[1:44:37] Perfection I long for the DAT I don't
[1:44:40] have to
[1:44:45] change see from glory to glory he's
[1:44:48] changing me changing me changing me his
[1:44:53] likeness and image to perfect in me the
[1:44:56] love of God shown to the
[1:44:58] world for he's
[1:45:00] changing changing
[1:45:04] me
[1:45:08] amen from Earthly things through the
[1:45:11] Heavenly amen his likeness and image
[1:45:14] praise the Lord so we
[1:45:15] change we have to
[1:45:18] change do you know when I'm going to
[1:45:20] quit changing brother Glenn
[1:45:28] that's a good answer there brother Glenn
[1:45:29] I like the second one when you get that
[1:45:31] new body that's a perfect body isn't it
[1:45:34] brother Bram says he says the reason
[1:45:36] that you long for Perfection is because
[1:45:37] there's a perfect body waiting for you
[1:45:41] we hate our faults we hate our
[1:45:44] mistakes I'll be glad when we're not
[1:45:47] human
[1:45:48] anymore why because this Humanity has
[1:45:50] and I thank God for having graced Mercy
[1:45:53] on us in our mistakes and our failures
[1:45:55] to still be Grace have Grace upon us but
[1:45:59] one of these days we won't need Grace
[1:46:02] why we need Grace because of our
[1:46:04] failures but there you'll have a body
[1:46:07] like his own Glory it'll be
[1:46:11] perfect amen aren't you longing for that
[1:46:14] say thank you Lord Jesus I'm longing for
[1:46:16] that
[1:46:17] Perfection so when you talk about change
[1:46:19] and when you talk about how God don't
[1:46:21] change man does change Church has
[1:46:23] change amen and we have to change why do
[1:46:26] you think that God said as many as I
[1:46:28] love I rebuke and chasen because we're
[1:46:31] not what we ought to
[1:46:32] be
[1:46:34] amen but we're working towards it Lord
[1:46:37] change me from weak to week take this
[1:46:40] out take that out fill me with more of
[1:46:42] your grace and more of your love make me
[1:46:45] like you want me to
[1:46:47] be
[1:46:49] amen that's right all of
[1:46:51] nature praise Lord I won't go into more
[1:46:55] humor but you ain't never seen a cow get
[1:46:57] a big old bugle of some kind and try to
[1:47:01] go get a little o you know different
[1:47:05] octaves in it you
[1:47:07] know they just automatically do all that
[1:47:11] they don't never have to
[1:47:13] improve
[1:47:16] amen
[1:47:18] amen let me just say uh let me read you
[1:47:21] something now
[1:47:24] how many knows that when
[1:47:28] God lived his life here on Earth he was
[1:47:31] an example for us he was an example for
[1:47:34] us and he went up into heaven come back
[1:47:36] on the day of
[1:47:38] Pentecost and come into the form of his
[1:47:41] children come into Peter and Paul and
[1:47:43] all of them and manifested
[1:47:46] himself amen and they wrote a book of
[1:47:50] Acts they wrote a book of Acts
[1:47:56] and that is what God intended that's the
[1:47:58] way that God intended for his church to
[1:48:00] be how many he knows
[1:48:02] that we call it the Acts of the
[1:48:05] Apostles The Acts of the Apostles
[1:48:07] brother brandham corrected it Ain that
[1:48:10] right why it was the acts of the Holy
[1:48:13] Ghost in the
[1:48:16] apostles that's
[1:48:18] right and so that was God and the way
[1:48:21] that he acted then listen to what
[1:48:23] brother Braham says when he was given
[1:48:25] the key he was trying to he was given
[1:48:27] the key in the church age book of how to
[1:48:31] how to figure out which messenger was
[1:48:34] for each
[1:48:35] age okay now how many knows God had
[1:48:39] seven stars in his right
[1:48:40] hand and seven
[1:48:43] candlesticks and God had given him a key
[1:48:45] brother B says the key that was given to
[1:48:47] me of the Lord whereby I was able to
[1:48:49] determine the messenger for each
[1:48:51] age is a most scriptural one in fact it
[1:48:55] might be called the Keystone of the
[1:48:57] Bible he said it is the Revelation that
[1:49:00] God never
[1:49:04] changes and what he's his ways are as
[1:49:07] unchangeable as he
[1:49:09] is remember what he said to Peter he
[1:49:12] said Peter whatever you lose on Earth
[1:49:14] I'll lose in heaven whatever you bind on
[1:49:17] Earth I'll B in heaven and Peter had the
[1:49:20] keys to the kingdom
[1:49:23] how many know that's why we go by acts
[1:49:26] 238 and know that in the name of Jesus
[1:49:29] baptism was actually the name of the
[1:49:31] father Son and the Holy Ghost and what
[1:49:34] Peter did there is what the prophet of
[1:49:36] God pointed us
[1:49:37] to amen that was what God
[1:49:41] did amen now notice even in Hebrews 13:8
[1:49:46] says Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:49:47] today and forever I know that whatsoever
[1:49:50] in Ecclesiastes 3:14-15
[1:49:52] I know that whatever God doeth it shall
[1:49:54] be forever and nothing can be put to it
[1:49:57] nor anything taken from it and God doeth
[1:50:00] it that men should fear before him this
[1:50:02] just comes to my mind didn't by by I'm
[1:50:04] said make sure that you say what's on
[1:50:06] them tapes just stay with the
[1:50:10] word why because man if we went by the
[1:50:13] things that we would think and our ideas
[1:50:15] I'm not here to promote my own ideas or
[1:50:19] put my own ideas in it and you wouldn't
[1:50:21] listen if I was say there and a preacher
[1:50:23] and I
[1:50:24] have wow boy here I
[1:50:27] go Pastor message Pastor amen allow to
[1:50:30] preacher to come in and preach things
[1:50:31] that was contrary to the message and I
[1:50:34] lost my confidence completely it was
[1:50:36] part of the reason I'm here
[1:50:39] today that was the Turning
[1:50:41] Point lord said go up to Elon I've been
[1:50:45] here 30 some OD years
[1:50:48] hello but because he just not and I went
[1:50:51] to the pastor look he you know that
[1:50:52] wasn't right he says well we don't
[1:50:54] understand it all and all this that or
[1:50:55] the other yeah but you can't sheep you
[1:50:58] can't feed your sheep a bunch of
[1:51:00] questionable stuff and confuse
[1:51:02] them and knowing that it's a man if you
[1:51:04] don't have this Revelation you're going
[1:51:05] to be oh don't you forget about that you
[1:51:07] get the revelation of almighty
[1:51:09] God
[1:51:12] Amen how many's glad that we had thus
[1:51:14] sayith the Lord the reason I like the
[1:51:17] quote out of the church H book is
[1:51:19] because we know that it's exactly
[1:51:21] according to the word it's according to
[1:51:23] the Bible and Jesus Christ would come
[1:51:26] and prove it and vindicate it and
[1:51:29] anybody a false preacher Jesus Christ
[1:51:31] isn't going to come and vindicate it
[1:51:33] hello all right now let's go on that
[1:51:36] just come to my mind I don't know if
[1:51:37] anybody needed that but anyway there you
[1:51:39] have it stay with the word of God Amen
[1:51:41] because it's how many know it's our
[1:51:44] anchor praise the
[1:51:46] Lord all right that's right he says you
[1:51:50] know nothing can be put to it or taken
[1:51:53] from it see to change one word of it as
[1:51:56] Eve did would bring sin and death even
[1:51:59] as it says in revelation 22 If any man
[1:52:01] shall add to these things God shall add
[1:52:04] to him the plagues that are written in
[1:52:06] this book and if any man shall take away
[1:52:08] from the words of the book of this
[1:52:09] Prophet God shall take away his part out
[1:52:11] of The Book of Life your life depends on
[1:52:14] whether you stay with the word or
[1:52:17] not tell me something where would we be
[1:52:19] if God wouldn't have sent Malachi 4 we
[1:52:22] would would be in a confusion we would
[1:52:24] still be wondering what is right who is
[1:52:30] Right aren't you glad that the prophet
[1:52:33] of God didn't belong to the Baptist
[1:52:34] methodists or Pentecostals or any of
[1:52:36] them you always stood among them in
[1:52:39] between all of them and said come back
[1:52:41] to the word come back to the
[1:52:44] word they wanted him to do but he
[1:52:46] wouldn't ain't no way he would do it
[1:52:49] they even offered him to take him Jet
[1:52:51] and everything else and take care of all
[1:52:53] of his expenses if he just let down on
[1:52:55] the godhead water baptism and serpent
[1:52:57] seed you talking to the wrong boy right
[1:53:01] here he says that's right because he's
[1:53:03] right under God he wasn't going to do it
[1:53:05] for nothing if he gave back million
[1:53:08] dooll checks you know said no this isn't
[1:53:10] for
[1:53:12] money look at the evangelists and all of
[1:53:15] those out there today they was given a
[1:53:18] million dollars boy they sure go for
[1:53:20] it but it's not for money amen praise
[1:53:24] the Lord praise the Lord let me continue
[1:53:27] listen so he says that's right if you
[1:53:29] add to or take away see if you had
[1:53:31] anything to it of the words of this
[1:53:33] prophecy prophecy God shall take away
[1:53:35] his part out of the book of life then
[1:53:38] again he says this way now don't let
[1:53:40] don't go astray he says when I said that
[1:53:42] God and his word and ways never change I
[1:53:45] did not say that the church and its
[1:53:47] Messengers could not change how many
[1:53:49] knows it did this is where I want to go
[1:53:52] with the world and the way that even
[1:53:54] God's church and God's people
[1:53:57] changed now I truly believe this I truly
[1:54:01] believe that brother Braham said that
[1:54:03] this bride in this hour is elected not
[1:54:05] to fall come on so I believe that we're
[1:54:08] not going to fall and we're not going to
[1:54:10] get called like that like that first
[1:54:12] church did what did they do amen
[1:54:15] emphasis lost their first love and by
[1:54:19] the next one it was smart enough which
[1:54:20] meant that they were bitter
[1:54:23] and then the next one even went into
[1:54:25] death and the whole church went to death
[1:54:27] spiritual death and God had to bring a
[1:54:29] Reformation through Luther and Wesley
[1:54:31] Pentecost had to bring us back to the
[1:54:34] fullness of the word cuz you couldn't
[1:54:36] even have the fullness of the birth of
[1:54:38] Christ you couldn't have the real word
[1:54:40] birth until the fullness of the word
[1:54:42] came that's why you would be a menite
[1:54:44] you'd be an Amish you'd be a Pentecostal
[1:54:46] you'd be a
[1:54:47] Baptist a Pentecostal that believed if
[1:54:50] you speak in tongues you got it
[1:54:53] that was their birth is that
[1:54:55] right and when brother bam come along
[1:54:58] and said you know I've seen the Indians
[1:55:00] I've seen them do their dances and
[1:55:02] everything else and and make pens right
[1:55:04] in the unknown tongue so don't tell me
[1:55:06] that unknown tongues and all of that is
[1:55:08] the Holy Ghost the devil can impersonate
[1:55:12] that
[1:55:14] Amen brother Bram says you know if love
[1:55:16] was the evidence of the Holy Ghost the
[1:55:18] Christian Science would have it on us if
[1:55:21] gifts were pente C would have it on
[1:55:25] us
[1:55:27] amen but I want to ask
[1:55:30] you what is the
[1:55:32] condition what is the condition that
[1:55:34] we're to be in if we expect to be
[1:55:38] saved in the token brother Braham says
[1:55:41] I'll tell you what there's only one
[1:55:42] thing that is
[1:55:43] accepted just like at the blood that was
[1:55:46] put on the lindle post is't that right
[1:55:48] nothing else was accepted if you put the
[1:55:50] wrong if you put a goat or a and if it
[1:55:52] wasn't Lamb's blood or some other blood
[1:55:56] how many knows he wouldn't have said nah
[1:55:57] I'm just going to wink at their
[1:55:59] ignorance no that young man or that one
[1:56:02] lady am me that firstborn of that family
[1:56:04] would have died amen it had to be the
[1:56:07] blood and brother bam says even now you
[1:56:09] say you believe in the blood of Jesus
[1:56:11] Christ dying for you that's okay that's
[1:56:13] good but he says it'll take more than
[1:56:15] that it'll take the life of the blood in
[1:56:17] you he says don't all of your all of
[1:56:20] your uh religious demonstrations and all
[1:56:24] your good deeds and all of those things
[1:56:26] don't you count on that he says you lay
[1:56:29] aside everything else until you've got
[1:56:32] nothing but the literal life of Jesus
[1:56:34] Christ Living in you how many believe
[1:56:35] that's the only thing that God is going
[1:56:37] to take in the Rapture that's God's life
[1:56:39] living in
[1:56:41] you amen aren't you glad that we can
[1:56:44] have
[1:56:45] that praise the Lord I'm glad that we
[1:56:48] have it today amen and that we can be
[1:56:51] amen he says talking about the book of
[1:56:53] Acts he says they're the standard amen
[1:56:55] that is the original church and any
[1:56:57] church that there is will always try to
[1:57:00] be like them amen how many knows that
[1:57:03] man you take the life of a pumpkin and
[1:57:05] it you know uh you know put it pumpkin
[1:57:08] seed out there it'll bring forth another
[1:57:10] pumpkin he say you take the hot and tots
[1:57:13] of Africa amen and where he's preaching
[1:57:15] over there naked women and and no Tops
[1:57:18] on and anything else but when they got
[1:57:19] the baptism of the Holy Ghost they look
[1:57:22] for some clothes to put on and he said
[1:57:24] isn't it funny how here in America the
[1:57:26] Christians they're taking more off and
[1:57:28] then the Christians over there they're
[1:57:29] putting it on the same Holy Ghost if you
[1:57:31] get the same Holy Ghost they got he's
[1:57:34] still the same yesterday today and
[1:57:36] forever it'll make us act like they
[1:57:38] acted it'll make us live like they lived
[1:57:41] it'll make us love like they
[1:57:44] loved it'll be the same
[1:57:47] fire wo don't just tell me about Wesley
[1:57:51] don't just tell me
[1:57:52] oh some day going by of services we used
[1:57:55] to have and preachers that used to be
[1:57:57] able to
[1:57:59] preach we can have the same thing today
[1:58:02] cuz he is the same today yesterday and
[1:58:04] forever Brother Brad I believe right
[1:58:06] till the day that we go into Rapture
[1:58:08] we're going to get hotter and hotter and
[1:58:10] hotter we're not getting colder we're
[1:58:13] getting hotter all the
[1:58:16] time cuz we're going to get so hot that
[1:58:18] we're going to be changed in the very
[1:58:20] Adams one of these days
[1:58:22] that's what I'm looking for a Rapture to
[1:58:25] get out of this world Trump ain't going
[1:58:27] to fix very much no he's not it's not
[1:58:31] going to be the solution I manyan he
[1:58:33] believes this is the solution right here
[1:58:35] this is the only
[1:58:42] solution a surrendered life to the word
[1:58:45] of God to the reveal word of the
[1:58:51] hour brother Braham said the Pharisees
[1:58:54] even the disciples almost missed John
[1:58:55] the Baptist cuz he the disciples asked
[1:58:58] him
[1:59:00] the they they said that the Pharisees
[1:59:02] are asking isn't John supposed to come
[1:59:05] first you know isn't uh Eli Elias
[1:59:08] supposed to come
[1:59:09] first and Jesus said Elias sure truly
[1:59:13] shall come first and restore all things
[1:59:14] but I say unto you he has already come
[1:59:17] and they have done unto him the things
[1:59:19] that were listed of them is that right
[1:59:21] they missed
[1:59:23] it why because the Pharisees were living
[1:59:26] in the glare of another age man is
[1:59:29] always looking back to the god of
[1:59:31] History the god of
[1:59:34] yesterday I believe every book I believe
[1:59:37] every page I believe every message that
[1:59:40] brother Brandon brought but I'm here to
[1:59:41] tell you that same healing power that
[1:59:44] same saving power that same forgiveness
[1:59:46] power is here
[1:59:48] today God is here today just like he was
[1:59:51] back then and when when he isn't there
[1:59:54] won't be a hope left for the world when
[1:59:56] that spirit is lifted how many's looking
[1:59:59] when that he Spirit takes that Spirit
[2:00:01] out I want to be there with
[2:00:03] him that's exactly right I want to be
[2:00:06] there with him when he picks this Holy

[2:01:05] of The Rock and covers me there with his
[2:01:09] hand I've Anchored In Jesus how many

[2:01:22] the man that walketh not in the counsil
[2:01:24] of the ungodly nor standeth in the SI in

[2:02:30] water that bringeth forth his fruit in

[2:03:07] the mouth of the lion he'll deliver you
[2:03:09] out of the Paw of the bear he'll deliver

[2:03:18] god that delivered me out of the P of
[2:03:20] lion and the bear going to deliver you
[2:03:22] into my hand amen he's going to deliver

[2:03:49] same one closing thought
[2:03:52] how many knows that this same God
[2:03:54] doesn't change his
[2:03:55] ways and if you want to get if you want
[2:03:57] to get what they got
[2:04:00] huh if you want to get what they had
[2:04:03] what do you got to do you got to come
[2:04:06] the way they
[2:04:09] came if we'll meet the conditions that
[2:04:11] they met according to the prophet of God
[2:04:13] and the Bible if you meet the same
[2:04:15] conditions they met you'll get the same
[2:04:20] results can can you imagine brother
[2:04:22] Tommy walking around in Scottsville or
[2:04:24] whatever cuz the early Christians from
[2:04:26] my understand used to drag a cross cross
[2:04:28] around ain't that right a
[2:04:33] cross why because they were taking up
[2:04:35] their cross and following him you were
[2:04:37] willing to die whatever God said to they
[2:04:39] were willing to do if you want to get
[2:04:42] Real Results make sure that you give him
[2:04:43] a
[2:04:44] 100% I thought about na na na non I
[2:04:48] believe it was Elijah told him to go
[2:04:49] wash Amen in a certain River and right
[2:04:52] he me go washing the dirty dirty
[2:04:55] River amen and he got mad he says aren't
[2:04:57] I I ain't going to read it ain't got
[2:04:59] time but listen he says you know his
[2:05:01] servants he came and says I thought he
[2:05:02] was going to come out here amen and and
[2:05:05] lay his hands on me and it was going to
[2:05:06] vanish that's what I expect it you know
[2:05:09] isn't it something how that if God
[2:05:10] doesn't things the way do things the way
[2:05:12] people expect denominations expect well
[2:05:15] it just ain't going to you know they
[2:05:16] ain't going to do it but his servant
[2:05:19] says you know if he' ask you a hard
[2:05:21] thing wouldn't you have done it and he
[2:05:23] says yeah I guess you're right so he
[2:05:24] went over there and he di I'm telling
[2:05:27] you I think it was seven times how many
[2:05:28] those amen one less time if he only went
[2:05:32] one less time than what he was supposed
[2:05:33] to he never got clean from the leprosy
[2:05:36] but he did exactly like God said and it
[2:05:38] happened how many believes when you do
[2:05:40] according to acts 238 repent every one
[2:05:43] of you be baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:05:45] Christ for the remission of your sins
[2:05:47] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:05:49] Holy Ghost the promise is to you to your
[2:05:51] children children to them that are far
[2:05:53] off even as many as the Lord Our God
[2:05:55] shall go the apostolic days aren't over
[2:05:59] the days in the fire of the Holy Ghost
[2:06:00] aren't over no we're living right in the
[2:06:03] middle of them God is real he just needs
[2:06:07] surrendered hearts and lives to live
[2:06:10] this simple humble everyday Christian
[2:06:14] Life God bless you this morning I hope
[2:06:17] you enjoyed the word this
[2:06:19] morning now we want to go and change the
[2:06:22] order of the service into doing
[2:06:24] something that the Lord Jesus asked us
[2:06:25] to do in remembrance of him
[2:06:31] amen see our whole anchor how many knows
[2:06:35] everything about what you believe is
[2:06:37] anchored in one thing and that is in the
[2:06:39] Cliff of The Rock and when they put a
[2:06:42] spear he was the Rock and when they put
[2:06:43] a spear to cause the cleft is that right
[2:06:47] the blood came out nothing but the blood
[2:06:50] what will wash away my nothing but the
[2:06:52] blood our complete confidence in our
[2:06:57] journey in our destination in the
[2:06:59] Forgiveness of our sins or anything is
[2:07:01] in the blood of Jesus Christ that 2,000
[2:07:04] years ago this is one place this is one
[2:07:06] time we do look back brother they always
[2:07:09] look forward to the Messiah when he
[2:07:10] would come and he says ever since that
[2:07:12] the believer looks back at what Jesus
[2:07:14] did for him on Calvary because when he
[2:07:16] died on Calvary he said it was finished
[2:07:18] and it's only our faith in the finished
[2:07:21] work
[2:07:22] in the Clift of the rock what Jesus did
[2:07:24] for us that made all this
[2:07:26] possible how many glad to be a
[2:07:36] Christian um I know I said I was about
[2:07:40] done but I I want to just let me let me
[2:07:42] just say this I've got a few things
[2:07:44] wrote down here it says if you're
[2:07:45] connected to this eternal God he'll be
[2:07:48] there amen when things go wrong he'll
[2:07:51] make the right amen when you're in the
[2:07:54] valley he'll bring you back up out of

[2:07:59] hear heal you amen if you're a sinner
[2:08:02] and lost he'll find you
[2:08:05] amen
[2:08:09] amen when you are getting old you're not
[2:08:11] going to stay young but when you get
[2:08:12] older he'll be there amen even when you
