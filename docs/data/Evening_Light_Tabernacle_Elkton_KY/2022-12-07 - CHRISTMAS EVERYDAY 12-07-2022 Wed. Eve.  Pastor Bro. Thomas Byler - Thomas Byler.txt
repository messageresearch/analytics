good evening good to be in the house of the Lord amen seen better Tommy's big truck out there must be working over here somewhere face the Lord amen God God is good isn't he hey man it's just good to see everybody in the house of the Lord amen and uh God is good isn't he hey man so hey man I just kind of have a uh early Christmas message amen I mean I got thinking about Christmas and you know just some of the things about Christmas and so forth and uh I said well it's just different different things just kind of come to me and I says boy this is plenty early you know but I'm not the kind of guy that is real good at putting it off amen say well I'm gonna hold off on that later so usually when it comes on my heart I like to preach it but amen so we're coming into the season of Christmas and so I thought I'd just share this with you with the help of the Lord talk to Sister Johnny amen went over there and seen her so anybody wants to cook over there I'm thinking it's 5 15 room 515 over there and so she's doing better looking brighter amen instead of just being able to stand up she took about eight steps she said you know so but she was throwing up a little bit her stomach has a hard time even digesting or keeping anything down because she hadn't eaten for quite a while and so she's trying to eat and I told her I says well you gotta do like better band dead you know it's just lying symptoms if you don't want to stay down and eat some more amen but anyway so she's gonna die she keeps trying and she's really wanting to live so as long as she wants to live she'll live amen but uh amen so we're glad that she is still wanting to be with us and so we just pray for her so how many will remember her in prayer the God will leave her strength because she really needs strength amen so just continue to remember in prayer Amen Brother Brad will be ministering this coming Sunday and then brother Danny's going to take the following Wednesday amen and then I've got uh trying to line some preachers up for first of the month got somebody lined up for February tried to be first January but but they're Jeremy Lord I don't know if y'all know him but he yeah he's pretty much kind of taken over for brother Dewey up there he's just helping him out a lot but he saw he may end up taking over for him so I took and listened several of his tapes on the way home whenever I Minister up there and I really liked what I heard so amen it seems to be a real good teacher amen and I like good teaching amen and so I'm I mean I'm just looking forward to him come and preach for us amen so praise the Lord everybody happy amen praise the Lord all right let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you and we are grateful to be able to be assembled again Lord in Your Name Lord Jesus and father we don't know just how long it'll be before we can't do this anymore but Lord we want to thank you for every opportunity that we get to give together Lord and how different it would be Lord Jesus and how terrible it was Lord when we just had meetings at home and hardly ever saw each other but to get it get together to see each other the fellowship around the word of God and to just to feel your presence Lord It's just worth everything to us it means everything to us lord it's worth more to us than go Lord and that is just have your presence in our midst we ask God that you'll just bless the meditation of our heart father in the message tonight for we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen turn the Book of Luke if you will go to second chapter Luke 2 . and we'll read verse 8 through 13. and there were in the same country abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angels of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were so afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling cloth laying in the manger and suddenly there was with Angel a multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth and on Earth peace and Good Will towards men may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated I want to title this and I this is just what come to me and meant there's two different titles I thought about it given that one was Christmas 24 7. amen Christmas 24 7. amen but I will title it Christmas every day how's that sound amen and so you know and I say every day because I believe that as we approach this season and you know it's a season that uh uh according to their song you know to have a song something that says you know tis the season to be jolly right amen and so it's the season to be jolly everybody wants to be happy around Christmas they say It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year foreign Christian every day it's the most wonderful time amen it isn't just you know they call it the spirit of Christmas right now and it reminds me of what brother bam said on Mother's Day and everybody know goes and does things for Mom you know on a certain day bring her flowers amen I just got a pool to quote up he said that man says 365 days a beer it should always be Mother's Day not just a certain time and a certain day but it should always be and I think that of eyes to Christmas don't you because they want to just make it one day of the year that they all want to be jolly amen they all want to be happy you know and that's not the way it ought to be I believe for Christianity things amen it's every day and let me tell you something if we truly preach Christmas message it isn't just Christmas that's why I wasn't worried about whether it is close to Christmas or not because we preach Christmas all year round how did the Lord came how Christ came from the heavens of Heavens to save mankind isn't that right and you know I had the thing this week that you know there's so many promised time in so many things that's totally self-lifted coming up a lot of our problems are self-inflicted because I mean those Christ came to take care of all of the problems here and take care of us and give us the things that we have need of and a lot of times people don't have joy they don't have peace uh I like that I like this first thing that he says he says you know he says I bring you good tidings of great sorrow sadness and I just tried to picture when I talked when I looked at that word Joy of Tidings of great joke oh amen we sing the Tidings of Comfort and Joy outlasting about the Rams today and he was preaching on God cares do you care and I'd love to go into the detail because he went into great detail and talking about it in the heart of man God has put an empty place in there a certain place amen that calls you to help and desire to want to have comfort two and a half Joy you got that thirst and everybody puts it in the wrong thing but God made you to want to have joy to want to have comfort and we know that the world goes to great extents to have a little Joy to be happy huh can I just say what comes to this gray matter of mine I'm coming in some people are just happy being sad they're sad so much until they've just accepted it and they just stay sad I hear a few amens you must have known somebody like that too right you can't cheer somebody up if you try it with anything you got why because they probably tried to be happy you know never it just didn't work and I like the one thing about this and tonight's message is that every day every day should be Christmas you know we have a problem as human beings we have a problem with consistency you know and I thought about it got into deep thought about this and I thought about you know God made it that way to where man God God's shaped this thing and I'm not sure what the brother man have called it the law of average I guess or something our law of contrast all right you got the days you got the nights you got the good times you got the bad times you know and the law of contrast you have everything has a contrast here there's the good days there's the bad days we feel good we feel bad we have good things happening we're happy we're at bad things happen we're up we're down we're in and we're out we're not consistent we're human beings and he made God made it that way why in order for you to be consistent for one thing we know that it takes Christ no right for any person not the for a person to be at a place where brother bam said I think it's been normal now he says you know the one thing about him is he's always the same amen let me tell you something how many knows it takes a lot it takes us that's fat that's that's so when you can say that about somebody that they're always the same because we aren't that way huh if we if we allow we can be more that how many wants to be more that way but you know what we allow uh you know the law of contrasting affect us we know we're gonna you know we're gonna have happiness we're gonna have joy one day the next day we're not gonna have any Joy I know we're gonna be up we're gonna be down we're going to be in we're going to be out inconsistent just like in the weather or like the seasons amen I believe reference to this in the interview talking about some people you know and you're kind of like the weather you know sometimes you have cloudy days they have gloomy days they have sunshiny day but what did he say he said and I don't have the board here everybody talks about you know it's a person that lives on the outside realm perhaps in the Justified state or even in the Sanctified State you know they're still uh subject to the weather out there that's the way a lot of Christians are a lot of so-called Christians let me tell you the whole world and you know the sad part about it is and we're seeing let me just say this kind of off the thought but we're seeing the evidence of how Wicked the world is because now they're they don't want nothing to do with Christmas at all anymore they don't want no Christmas they don't want to Christ they you know first they took an Xmas right who's the Xmas and now they don't want Christmas to you know my it's fast sliding isn't it you know because used to people man Everybody celebrate not everybody anymore it's getting worse and worse you know we the thing the other thing that I want to say is you know the wise men came at a certain time and they lived today their gifts amen down there before Christ and gave gave gifts you know and we give each other gifts and so forth and then what they worshiped him didn't it and I think that's the type of us you know the best thing that we have to not want to just say you know what we want to do is we want to not just give him a gift once a year we want to give him a gift every day what if do we give the greatest gift that you can give is yourself amen you've got to give him that gift every day because how many knows you're gonna die to yourself every day every day you got to recommit yourself to God say Here I Am Lord I was reading a corporator man says you know what uh at Easter you know he said he said about himself he said he'd wish everybody Merry Christmas and Easter because you wouldn't see him anymore till Christmas now he either used to work so pathetic or something like that how terrible it is that some people are so irregular about even honoring God they'll only come at Christmas or at Easter or something like that that's real sad folks very inconsistent so I want to tell you something that for us Christmas is every day amen not only that but I don't know if I'll preach another one but you know uh you know we could talk about the rejected King isn't that right how that Christ is rejected them and the gift is rejected amen but mine so we want that full benefits aren't you glad that we received the minute great Good Tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people amen hallelujahs so we don't want to be like the weather folks we want to be consistent we have a God that never I'm glad that you serve God that is never up and down never in and out if he was boy I'll tell you what will you and I be in trouble if he'd just come and help us if we he felt like it well I don't feel like it today don't bother me I'm in a bad mood but isn't that how we do well I don't feel like praying so I guess oh I don't feel like going to church I guess I won't come on you're not right I don't feel like that you know hey come on if we if you come by your feelings am I we all learn we know that if you go about your family you are sure they're going to be tossed about no you gotta be further than that you got to be yielded to Christ more than that amen I've got one quote tonight can I read it it's one that I've preached so many times and I like it was where brother Branham uh we're in his bed and preached to his wife till about 12 o'clock he says talking about a text come on his heart about rest and so forth she raised up by Grace listen to me and I said a Christian's faith is based solidly upon rest that's right a Christian isn't tossed about it Christian doesn't run from place to place come on people how many knows everybody out there I hope somebody runs from place to places listening tonight I heard somebody I'm damn hoping somebody that's tossed about how many knows that even if Ephesians 4 says you know that we should be no more talk s about with the wind and every slide and so forth not be children anymore no not toss but if I have more Ministries to make you solid to get you on the anchor where you won't move oh my how beautiful it is to know people that are resting man friend if I can do one thing as your pastor is get you into rest I thought about this and I want to speak on this for just a minute because this is another day another day that uh people used to think that on a certain day on a Sabbath day that's the day of rest amen until even The Seventh-Day Adventist Mandel they'll make anything outside of that the Antichrist the only way that we gotta get back to rest on the seventh day well Paul clearly made a statement he says you know blew it right out of the water don't let any man judge you in meat or drink or any holy day or any Sabbath day and he made it very clear that he says you know we have entered into rights those of you who are in Christ have entered into rest amen and he has those who have entered into heaven his rest have ceased from their own works [Applause] how many knows if I can get you to cease from your own work and I can get you to rest in Christ then you are gonna be one happy one peaceful person I can tell you but I can't put you in there you got to get in there you got to get in that place of rest it's not a certain day Christmas isn't a certain day the rest isn't a certain day Mufflers say isn't a certain day it's every day Joy To The World Isn't it one day it's not around it's every day you could have joy the world could have joy if they'd receive the joy that God came to give isn't that why isn't that something that the first Proclamation was that they're bringing Tidings of great joy be something if we could put it on listen to the Holy Ghost hey man you got free from their sins it would show them to run in the house he'd show them running over abuse they show them screaming and hollering wow oh you have the biggest bunch of screaming hollering down through history you ever heard not little Joy great guy because I'll tell you what if you get the full benefits of what he come for that man in that cradle that man he's not in the Cradle anymore but every day he's in the Cradle of my heart aren't you glad not just one day not just Christmas we don't have him in that cradle he's in this cradle foreign I worship him every day every hour of every day 24 7. [Music] Hallelujah great joy where is that Joy what brings that Joy why would he give such great joy I'll tell you why because Jesus when he began to preach he went into the synagogue and that was delivered unto him the book of the I prophet Isaiah and then he opened the book he found the place where it is written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor and how many knows you know we're all just poor people maybe not you know you might not only Paul if you might not be he might have been Rich enough but he was spiritually poor you and I were spiritually poor we didn't know which way to turn but he came to those who had need of him to preach to the poor and he said to heal the brokenhearted amen and to preach Deliverance to the captives I mean no sin had you captive it held you all had a hold of you when a person gets liberated did you ever get to see a person again liberated a person that amen and breaks through the sound barrier amen and lets God come take his sins away they act the fool sometime but they can't help it why because there's such Overjoyed to be relieved of the change to find them you're a captain of your hell but the grace of God the blood of Jesus Christ breaks those chains [Music] amen now you have joy every day brother bam says you know amen people want to he says you know I drank just as much as I wanna drink I've been drunk for the last 40 years ever since I got saved amen I drink more the Holy Ghost big boy I have found his grace is all complete he supplies they really oh it is joy unspeakable and full of grace amen oh peace that passes understanding oh that's what it's all about Tidings of great joy peace on Earth and Good Will towards men praise be to God we don't celebrate him in the manger anymore except for the manger of our heart I reminded you ought to get up to thank you Lord for being in the manger of my heart I'm here to praise you hey man I've had a sore foot hey man the old Devil's trying to give me a sore foot it was better so yesterday morning I was out in the garage listening to gospel music and I'm telling you what I'm glad nobody videoed it I had me a good old dance with it ah dance nah dance nah dance nah dance I quit and then I got to dance to another song I just loved it amen that night my foot got dirty I shouldn't attacked so much oh my but you know Joy how many know we can have joy every day joy unspeakable and full of Glory amen my why because he's in the manger of your heart Hallelujah every day we celebrate we worship him like the wise men give the gift of yourself not just one year amen or not just on the 12th day of Christmas my true love gave to me I wanted to try to find the lyrics of that you know he'd have the 12 Days of Christmas I want you to know we've got 356 is it 356. 365. thank you very much 365 days a year hey man so I know you're gonna have to come up with a whole lot more to sing about and I'm sure that you could have one for each one if you thought about what God does for you every day amen every day 24 7. Hallelujah we enjoy the benefits of Christmas now notice I want to talk to you a little bit about another something else and that is what we humans do all right us humans first of all we can be outside of Christ we can be so inconsistent so up and down not every day is the same huh and we do have trials we have doe things but if you're really Anchored In Christ as brother bam talked about that ship that he saw in the harbor no matter if the waves come over go under go around you can't sink because you're anchored amen let's make sure you're anchored the second thought that I want to bring was humans have a unique ability to take the right thing and mess it up we can mess some stuff up now huh that's right even Brother Brad says you know the idea of Christmas is all right but it's all this other stuff that you can't teach your children because if you do and you don't tell them that it's not really real they're going to say when you get older Oh you mean you're telling me to turn the closet isn't real well is Jesus the same way remember but there's a truth see that's the truth in Christmas we drove through the little drive-through over in Lewisburg the other night me and Mike and Grayson our family there and they had demand you'd had all the different scenes and I thought man you know I don't have a problem with that we should celebrate we should make a big deal of God coming down to you to man you know it's right there but the problem is is the Old Saint Nick uh it's the Santa Claus let's open the North Pole and got all these little elves working for him huh and then he's got the slay and he's got the reindeers even Rudolph the Red-nosed one we made all these extra stuff to this isn't that right now all becomes a big commercial that's what brother Ryan didn't like about all of that amen the commercialized World got a hold of not only of that but also of Easter isn't that right Easter egg hunts and bunny rabbits what's that got to do with the resurrection of the Lord Brother Brandon said all right [Applause] every time we come to church it'd be Sunday we come and honor the resurrection isn't that right we ought to honor the resurrection every day 24 7 honor the resurrection how many knows there's not a holy day anymore that's the holy ghost that is in you You Are Holy every day amen praise be to God but we have a way of messing things up the human race does whether it's Christmas or whether it's Easter or whether it's the Bible huh we get our own ideas put into it and guess SWAT according to the Amish years the Bible tells you you got to be driving a horse and buggy you may be wearing these black clothes huh they gotta believe they believe that if you you I flaw Hellbound most of them where I come from to be told it means you're high or English they call it hi ho I'm not sure why hi but anyway I'm not high but anyway did you think that people in the world lost huh well I would hope that they think they were right wouldn't you because if they thought they weren't right they couldn't really do what they're doing now could they and that goes not just for them but for the men and I huh and then those that have steel wheels and those are rubber tires the mom and Mennonite the beachy homage there's so many different classes what a mess right people's got different conceptions of the lord of the coming Lord and every one of those churches healthy that's how I should be that's what the Bible was trying to tell us I hope this goes out and I wish every Amish Mennonite and every other person would hear this but God God come down in this generation and he prove what was right and what was wrong God did I didn't God did the prophet didn't God did it through the prophet because he couldn't have done anything without God it was God doing it and it'll meet this whole generation on the day of judgment that in the midst of all that Darkness God brought a great Shining Light even as Jesus said the Bible talks about there's a light that is sprung up for the Gentiles or for the for the Israel and so forth and that a light that is sprung up but we have a way of making a mess of it because the fact is every Mennonite every Army sent me Baptist every Pentecostal every one of them we all are to all be together huh why aren't we because of our own ideas that gets in the way amen every message believer ought to be together but some ideas get in the way amen people's ideas people's ways amen Lord help us I just want him to have the manger of my heart don't you I want him to have Supreme control every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before every day with Jesus I love him more and more amen why because of what he done listen to preach Deliverance to the captives the recovering of the sight to the blind amen I mean no that's not just physically but not spiritually folks I'm here to tell you if you are in a blind denomination if your blood it takes God to open your eyes yeah it takes God to open your eyes to the word of God to even make God real to you there ain't a preach in the world can do it for you he can preach the word but it has to be God coming on your end of it that person's end of it and quickening amen folks I have preached some of the horriblest message I ever preached I thought huh and one person comes to say brother probably you don't know that's just what I needed foreign you don't know sometimes preachers sometimes the Lord will keep you down it cause you to say a certain thing that a certain person needs you never know amen certain person but I like points everybody gets something don't you amen one thing more I want to say that is about our feelings and our emotions you know God made it to where we're Rocky we're wavy if you're not in Christ isn't that right he made it to where in order for you to even as a Christian it meant to be solid every day what does it take it takes discipline don't it it takes takes discipline on your part to pray and to make room for him amen you know that's another thing that they didn't have amen they didn't have any room for him in the end that's the way it is in our day that the world a lot of people they've got no room for him I'm at least that you and I we make room for him every day [Music] reason people might cause you God is because they don't make room for more of God if you want more of God you've got to make more room that's why I said Sunday and you aren't happy where you are you're gonna have to do something different you're gonna have to do something different in your daily life you cannot get going doing the same thing and expect different results it's not going to happen now I guarantee you if you want to get closer to God begin to pray and say God help me to understand and show me how to get closer to you oh my but we wear ourselves out a lot of times for the physical on the for the Flesh and we don't have any time for God there's no room but for you and I there's more room how do you say tonight Lord I'm making room I'm making room for you Lord this generation didn't have room for him but you and I have room for him Lord come here there's a room right here pick all you need you can have every room how many is with me you can have my living room you can have my bedroom you can have my kitchen you can just make yourself home anywhere in this house that you want to make yourself find it home amen that's the feeling of every one of you I know that amen no room for him in the end the main thing also is you know Christmas is they call it the Christmas spirit right it's a spirit of joy and happiness and love isn't it a spirit of happiness and joy but yet I've been told that more people commit suicide around Christmas than any other time because you know how many people are left out there without being without togetherness and without that love and all of that and they get it's the bluest time huh it's a sad time now I know what it's like to have black Christmases I was in my 40s and we were going through what we was going through we had several Christmases that were purged Gleek sure [Laughter] here but I laughed my laugh is a

closer to him let Christ the spirit of Christmas isn't just Christmas amen it's having that Joy year around it's that half in that peace year around it's having that peace through every storm through
