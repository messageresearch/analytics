[16:34] message
[16:35] by brother branham about a mother's love
[16:37] for children
[16:42] when i said that humble little woman for
[16:45] the first time
[16:46] this ever happened the third pull upon a
[16:49] human being was a little humble woman
[16:52] that making about 200 a year for her
[16:56] living all she got out of her her little
[17:00] farm her
[17:01] husband dead two children that had
[17:04] turned kind of wild
[17:07] and come and donated twenty dollars of
[17:10] that to the building of this tabernacle
[17:14] and
[17:15] and meta had
[17:17] given me some money that morning
[17:20] for groceries
[17:21] twenty dollars and i was going to give
[17:24] it back to her that day while i was down
[17:26] there so that she wouldn't have to pay
[17:28] it but she wouldn't take it and when
[17:31] she she was sitting back in the corner
[17:32] and when when i said only thing i know
[17:34] is he is still jehovah jireh
[17:38] and still hattie said the right word she
[17:40] said that's nothing but the truth and
[17:42] when she said that brother banks
[17:45] would he here's one one that was present
[17:49] that room felt like it was coming apart
[17:51] and the holy spirit said the same voice
[17:54] that spoke about the squirrels said
[17:57] give her what she asked for and i said
[17:59] sister hadi as a witness before god this
[18:03] is it now
[18:04] if there's any doubt in your mind you
[18:06] ask what you want to
[18:08] and if it ain't ain't laid on in your
[18:12] lap then i'm a false prophet
[18:15] she said brother branham
[18:17] everybody was crying said what shall i
[18:19] ask
[18:20] i said you you are poor you live on on
[18:24] the hill over there with no money you
[18:26] might ask for that
[18:27] you got a little crippled sister sitting
[18:30] there
[18:31] edith
[18:33] that we prayed for for years you might
[18:36] ask for her healing i said your your
[18:39] father and mother is old and broke down
[18:41] you might ask for them
[18:43] whatever you ask for sister hattie
[18:46] see see now if it happens or not right
[18:48] now and i say
[18:50] said he has just told me the same voice
[18:54] said give her what she asked for
[18:57] and she looked around said what shall i
[18:59] say brother branham
[19:01] i said say what what your desire is
[19:04] think of your greatest desire and say
[19:06] that
[19:07] and say it
[19:08] and her her boys and what was even
[19:11] snickering and and laughing and she said
[19:14] the greatest desire i have is the
[19:16] salvation of my two sons
[19:19] i said i give them to you in the name of
[19:21] jesus christ and there they went
[19:24] and and they being faithful in this
[19:27] church with communion and them little
[19:29] fellows sitting there washing feet with
[19:31] the men and things like that we are all
[19:33] witnesses of that
[19:35] she had a real choice her her mother has
[19:38] to die so so does she all of them but
[19:41] what she asks
[19:42] what she asks will be eternal in the
[19:44] salvation of her children that was the
[19:47] third time it happened
[19:49] amen
[19:50] and that shows a real genuine love a
[19:54] mother has for her her children
[19:56] and that that's the most important thing
[19:59] that
[20:00] that you could ever ask for is the
[20:02] salvation of someone and and with that
[20:05] with that all the things that that she
[20:07] could have asked for
[20:09] think of it she could have been
[20:11] decided to be
[20:12] she wanted to be a millionaire she
[20:13] wanted to have have anything but but
[20:17] what she asked for
[20:19] or what was more important than anything
[20:21] god knew what she she would ask for
[20:23] that's why brother brandon and that's
[20:25] why god told brother brandon that that
[20:27] she
[20:29] could ask for what whatever she wanted
[20:33] and and so she she asked for
[20:35] something that that's eternal and and
[20:38] and she got it
[20:40] amen and
[20:43] what what would it
[20:45] if if i was given that option i don't
[20:47] know what i would would have asked for
[20:49] and but a
[20:50] a
[20:52] but a woman and and that
[20:55] has
[20:56] children
[20:58] that that's the most important thing
[20:59] that that
[21:01] she could have asked for
[21:03] amen so um
[21:07] thank you brother steve
[21:32] amen
[21:34] we're sort of a few in number today but
[21:37] like i told brother brad i feel like the
[21:39] lord is with us and that's the main
[21:41] thing

[43:34] be changed no matter what

[43:39] had to
[43:40] go from a statue or an idol to

[43:47] to be taught from youth that
[43:50] there is a god and that everything that
[43:52] you see in nature and everything
[43:56] uh
[43:58] there's a
[43:59] there's a being
[44:00] that
[44:02] created all of that and there's a reason
[44:04] for it
[44:05] so
[44:06] and you know most of the people that
[44:08] taught you that was always mama

[50:20] light it meant darkness and the power
[50:23] and what it really means what really
[50:26] those two powers uh do what consists of
[50:29] darkness what makes darkness and what
[50:32] makes light amen

[51:23] looking for
[51:24] i mean some of those sometimes those
[51:26] have
[51:27] i mean about talk about the same thing
[51:29] but
[51:29] all right arise and shine for the light
[51:32] is come
[51:33] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[51:36] thee
[51:38] amen
[51:39] how many believes that
[51:41] how many believes he was speaking to you
[51:42] there
[51:44] that quote that scripture is for you
[51:48] and it's for me
[51:49] amen
[51:53] now this is for somebody else are you
[51:56] ready
[51:57] verse 2 for behold
[51:59] darkness
[52:00] shall cover
[52:02] the earth
[52:03] and gross darkness the people
[52:07] my
[52:08] but the lord shall arise upon thee and
[52:11] his glory shall be seen
[52:14] upon thee amen and the gentiles shall
[52:17] come to thy light and the kings to the
[52:20] brightness of thy arising may god add
[52:22] his blessings to the reading of the word
[52:24] you can be seated
[52:26] this morning amen
[52:29] praise be to the lord
[52:34] but abandonment preaching the rising of
[52:36] the sense son said it this way he was
[52:39] speaking to the bride the church that
[52:41] had come out he talked about how did he
[52:43] said shalom which means peace to you
[52:45] amen
[52:47] peace god's peace rest upon you to the
[52:50] elected and so forth that's who i'm
[52:52] addressing it to amen
[52:55] he says now we're facing here
[52:57] our two subjects that we read of the
[52:59] scriptures
[53:01] very contrast one to another it says
[53:03] arise and shine for the glory of god has
[53:05] come upon thee thy light is here
[53:09] very next verse he says but is gross
[53:12] it's darkness upon the world and
[53:15] mine
[53:16] notice how he makes a distinction how
[53:18] that there is a darkness upon the world
[53:23] but there's gross
[53:26] darkness upon the people
[53:30] amen
[53:33] all right so oh so then now notice he
[53:37] says so let's find out what this is all
[53:39] about we're facing this year both
[53:41] darkness and light
[53:47] how true is it
[53:49] boy more true today than ever
[53:56] the world is in one of the most chaotic
[53:58] times of darkness that it's ever stood
[54:02] in
[54:04] amen
[54:06] how many believe that
[54:08] this was in 63
[54:12] how much more does that apply to today
[54:17] the most chaotic
[54:22] of all times since the andeluvian
[54:25] destruction
[54:26] just before the flood
[54:31] people
[54:33] are
[54:36] i don't know what to call them
[54:40] they think that god you know they don't
[54:42] even believe i guess they got flooded
[54:44] the place
[54:45] right
[54:46] so they perhaps don't think he'll
[54:48] destroy this place
[54:50] but he did destroy the world and he will
[54:53] destroy it again
[54:54] [Applause]
[54:57] and all the people in it every last one
[55:00] of them
[55:04] yeah he will he's going to do it
[55:07] you know so read first peter 3 heavens
[55:09] and earth will pass away all the
[55:11] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[55:13] behold the day cometh i think it is in
[55:16] uh
[55:18] malachi 4. behold the day cometh that
[55:19] shall burn as an oven and all the pride
[55:22] and all that do wickedly
[55:25] shall be ashes under the soles of your
[55:27] feet all that do wickedly shall burn
[55:33] amen
[55:35] you know when we talk about light and
[55:36] darkness
[55:38] we're talking about a spiritual light
[55:40] right
[55:42] now how many know that every one of us
[55:44] was born in
[55:46] darkness
[55:48] why because we were born in sin
[55:52] shaped iniquity come into this world
[55:54] speaking lies
[55:57] so i just want to make a statement this
[55:58] morning
[56:00] it takes the new birth to bring you into
[56:03] life
[56:05] if you aren't born again remember this
[56:08] you are still in darkness
[56:12] amen
[56:14] praise the lord
[56:16] you're still in darkness
[56:18] we want to address a little bit with the
[56:20] hell of the lord also
[56:21] some of the works of darkness
[56:25] some of its powers and what it does
[56:28] amen
[56:29] the power
[56:30] of darkness
[56:32] and the power
[56:34] of life
[56:35] paul said
[56:37] he says in chapter 13 of romans
[56:44] romans 13
[56:48] and verse 8 it says oh no man anything
[56:51] but to love one another for he that
[56:53] loveth another hath fulfilled the law
[56:56] for this thou shalt not die not commit
[56:58] adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt
[57:00] not steal thou shalt not before witness
[57:03] thou shalt not covet and if there be any
[57:04] commandment it is briefly
[57:07] comprehended in this same namely thou
[57:09] shalt love thy neighbor as myself love
[57:12] working no ill to his neighbor therefore
[57:15] love is the fulfilling of the law that
[57:17] and that knowing the time
[57:20] that now it is high time to wake out of
[57:23] sleep
[57:24] for now is our salvation
[57:26] nearer than what we believe the night is
[57:28] far spent the day is at home let us
[57:31] therefore cast off the works of darkness
[57:37] how many believe that's what it's time
[57:38] to do
[57:41] as a preacher i want to say this that i
[57:43] truly believe that it is fine-tuning
[57:46] time for god's people
[57:49] fine-tuning time
[57:53] i wonder how many hands would go up if i
[57:56] asked this morning how many in here feel
[57:58] the holy spirit on a daily basis
[58:01] condemning you for the little things
[58:03] that you do wrong
[58:10] because remember light pushes darkness
[58:13] out
[58:14] jesus was light and it says in him with
[58:17] no darkness at all when we leave here we
[58:19] don't want to have any darkness in us at
[58:22] all
[58:26] there is a power of darkness and there
[58:28] is a power of light
[58:33] a strength when you think about power
[58:35] you think about strength or authority
[58:40] huh
[58:41] now we know that god hates a powerless
[58:43] church
[58:46] he hates a powerless religion
[58:54] and as i get younger
[58:56] and
[58:58] i hate weakness myself
[59:00] huh
[59:01] how many loves weakness
[59:04] feebleness
[59:06] it's no fun is it
[59:09] no none of us likes to all be just so
[59:12] you know we don't even like to feel bad
[59:14] do we
[59:15] we like to feel good we like to feel
[59:19] strong
[59:21] we like strength we like power the same
[59:23] way with god god loves a people that has
[59:26] some power
[59:27] in the old testament god through isaiah
[59:29] talked about he says your solemn feasts
[59:32] they're a stench in my nose because it's
[59:34] become just common to you you're doing
[59:36] the right thing you're doing according
[59:38] to the word but you don't have any
[59:40] sincerity anymore
[59:42] you don't have any feeling with it
[59:44] anymore
[59:46] therefore he says he says i won't accept
[59:48] you
[59:48] i don't even accept it and i will turn
[59:51] my face from your prayers if you're in a
[59:53] lukewarm condition like that
[59:57] god don't even hear your prayers when
[59:59] you're weak
[1:00:01] and sickly and offer
[1:00:03] god weakness
[1:00:08] is that all right
[1:00:08] [Applause]
[1:00:13] god loves a powerful church he loves a
[1:00:16] powerful people
[1:00:18] why because he is powerful
[1:00:25] he is
[1:00:26] power how many believes we've been
[1:00:28] delivered
[1:00:30] from the power of darkness
[1:00:33] and translated into the marvelous light
[1:00:40] amen oh my
[1:00:44] let me just read another quote would
[1:00:45] that be all right
[1:00:47] i believe it was in
[1:00:51] well
[1:00:52] my computer
[1:00:53] could given me the title i wish it would
[1:00:55] give me the title of the message
[1:00:58] so anyway it's an old spot six year old
[1:01:02] not a laptop but a
[1:01:05] countertop
[1:01:07] computer
[1:01:08] desktop that there you go
[1:01:10] desktop computer and and somehow or
[1:01:12] other this smart guy right here pushed
[1:01:15] some wrong buttons right around and he
[1:01:16] just doesn't give you the titles anymore
[1:01:18] you got to watch what mustard is what
[1:01:20] what buttons you fish but anyway
[1:01:23] um i'm not sure which one it was
[1:01:26] but anyway
[1:01:28] but the man says this way he says do you
[1:01:29] realize that there is really only two
[1:01:33] powers in the universe
[1:01:35] how many believe
[1:01:36] that all the different nations and all
[1:01:39] the difference between everybody
[1:01:42] amen
[1:01:43] and now i just want to say between the
[1:01:45] kingdoms and so forth
[1:01:47] all of these rest of these minor little
[1:01:49] things are connected either with either
[1:01:51] one of those powers
[1:01:53] can we say this morning let's not just
[1:01:55] address
[1:01:56] it to the nations and to the worlds and
[1:01:58] and just about putin and all that that's
[1:02:01] going on right there it's probably just
[1:02:03] a little jealousy or
[1:02:05] a greed or something like that is what
[1:02:08] caused that war
[1:02:10] huh
[1:02:11] one more oil one more money one decided
[1:02:13] the other one they already got a 200
[1:02:15] million dollar yacht
[1:02:17] yet they're not happy
[1:02:19] it just goes to show you i don't care
[1:02:20] how rich you get you're still not
[1:02:21] content
[1:02:23] huh
[1:02:24] but not so much to look at those things
[1:02:26] as as to look at yourself every little
[1:02:29] thing that goes on in your life is
[1:02:32] either connected to a power of god power
[1:02:35] of light
[1:02:37] or it's the power of darkness
[1:02:40] now the power of darkness it is the
[1:02:42] power to drag you down
[1:02:46] because it's the power ultimately of
[1:02:48] death that's why in revelation he that
[1:02:50] wrote upon that horse it says that on
[1:02:52] his name
[1:02:53] his name that wrote on that horse going
[1:02:55] forth to conquering and to conquer his
[1:02:57] name was
[1:02:59] death
[1:03:02] so the power of darkness is the power of
[1:03:04] death
[1:03:06] it's the power of sorrow destruction
[1:03:09] depression
[1:03:12] huh
[1:03:13] that's what the power of darkness does
[1:03:17] it'll depress you
[1:03:20] amen and as brother danny said wednesday
[1:03:22] you know you know there's an aura that
[1:03:23] we have about each other and there's
[1:03:25] people that you love be around
[1:03:27] and other people that you don't want to
[1:03:29] be around
[1:03:30] why because there's a certain atmosphere
[1:03:32] that they have there's a power in the
[1:03:34] atmosphere that you have
[1:03:38] paul says don't we have power to lead
[1:03:40] about a brother or sister or a
[1:03:42] wife don't we have a power to have our
[1:03:45] own influence
[1:03:47] to have an aura about us an atmosphere
[1:03:49] about us
[1:03:51] you know i just love to get around
[1:03:52] somebody that's all down in the dumps
[1:03:54] don't you
[1:03:59] no we don't like to get around somebody
[1:04:00] that's down in the dumps
[1:04:02] and all sad and blue
[1:04:04] huh
[1:04:07] oh my see this is like light
[1:04:11] gives you that grin and his smile
[1:04:14] darkness
[1:04:16] oh i'm so depressed i just feel like
[1:04:18] shooting myself
[1:04:20] huh
[1:04:21] that's where darkness will get
[1:04:24] you it'll turn your smile upside down
[1:04:29] the devil will turn your smile upside
[1:04:31] down
[1:04:33] and every day you're in a battle between
[1:04:35] light and darkness
[1:04:41] [Music]
[1:04:43] my
[1:04:45] we're going to learn how to fight
[1:04:49] the darkness i mean how many knows you
[1:04:50] got to fight this darkness
[1:04:52] this darkness is overwhelming this our
[1:04:54] world is darker than ever before the
[1:04:57] people and their minds are darker than
[1:05:00] ever before
[1:05:02] they're in gross darkness
[1:05:05] when the man don't know if he's a man or
[1:05:07] woman can't know if she's a woman let me
[1:05:08] tell you something you are in gross
[1:05:11] darkness
[1:05:13] huh
[1:05:14] me and my wife is sitting on the couch
[1:05:16] talking about this morning she gets
[1:05:17] irritated she says what in the world

[1:05:21] put them on our island and take all the
[1:05:23] lesbians and put them on our island and
[1:05:25] they'll become extinct
[1:05:28] because i don't care how much a man
[1:05:30] thinks he's going to have a baby he
[1:05:31] ain't got the facilities for it
[1:05:35] he ain't got no whoo
[1:05:37] he can't make a baby

[1:05:44] i got one word for the whole thing
[1:05:47] stupid
[1:05:53] that's what it is
[1:05:56] that that is really stupid
[1:05:59] that is that is beyond i'm sorry that's
[1:06:02] a compliment
[1:06:04] i don't know what word it's really
[1:06:05] really far out
[1:06:06] there
[1:06:10] what does the bible say about brother i
[1:06:11] know that's your opinion but what does
[1:06:13] the bible say about it the bible says
[1:06:15] that people homosexuals see they have
[1:06:16] been given over to reprobate mind
[1:06:21] in other words they're not even in their
[1:06:22] right mind anymore you have lost your
[1:06:25] mind is what the bible says
[1:06:26] you have been given the word to a rapper
[1:06:28] about night to do things it's not even
[1:06:30] seemly and calmly
[1:06:34] ah
[1:06:35] i'm gonna have protesters all up in here
[1:06:36] after a while
[1:06:39] do you know that the left now those
[1:06:40] abortionists because of this ruling

[1:06:44] to hit the churches with protests

[1:06:48] motherhood
[1:06:50] protesting motherhood can you imagine
[1:06:57] all i can call them is a bunch of
[1:07:00] murdering

[1:07:04] are

[1:07:09] bunch of murderers
[1:07:12] huh
[1:07:15] i told my wife i'd like to ask them this
[1:07:16] question when they come up and protest
[1:07:19] look that little heartbeat that you got
[1:07:21] you left think that just because it's in
[1:07:23] the womb that it's not a soul it's not a
[1:07:25] baby

[1:07:28] in my your mother's womb i knew you
[1:07:31] god knows every one of them
[1:07:33] huh
[1:07:34] and that little heartbeat that knows the
[1:07:36] beating it's still beating it's still
[1:07:38] beating you you're saying back then it
[1:07:40] was all right to kill what if i turned
[1:07:42] left and decided hey you know what i
[1:07:44] don't think you're a human being either
[1:07:46] because that heartbeat maybe maybe you
[1:07:47] should be killed

[1:08:04] sorry i'm sorry but to those who think
[1:08:06] abortion is right ain't right they're
[1:08:09] mind
[1:08:10] they are not right in their mind the
[1:08:12] world's not right that's why it's gross
[1:08:14] darkness folks
[1:08:19] oh my if it was wrong 100 years ago it's
[1:08:22] still wrong
[1:08:24] huh
[1:08:26] and just when you think it can't get any
[1:08:28] worse
[1:08:30] you got to look twice if you're going
[1:08:32] into a bathroom to see what kind of a
[1:08:33] sign is up there
[1:08:36] huh
[1:08:38] that's something ain't it that's pretty
[1:08:40] bad
[1:08:42] why
[1:08:42] it's because of the blindness of their
[1:08:44] minds
[1:08:45] while i'm thinking about let me just say
[1:08:47] this one of the worst kinds of darkness
[1:08:50] is deception
[1:08:54] people that think they're christians
[1:08:57] but their lives don't match up to it
[1:09:02] amen
[1:09:03] deceive remember the devil deceived them
[1:09:06] they think they're in light but yet
[1:09:08] they're not that's the worst kind of
[1:09:09] darkness
[1:09:14] amen
[1:09:17] the bible says in first john 1 and 6 if
[1:09:20] we say that we have fellowship with him
[1:09:23] and walk in darkness we lie in that
[1:09:26] right danny
[1:09:28] we lie they're liars
[1:09:31] you say well i got i know god no if you
[1:09:33] walk in darkness you don't have
[1:09:35] fellowship with him because he don't
[1:09:36] have fellowship with darkness
[1:09:39] bible says that light has no fellowship
[1:09:42] with darkness
[1:09:44] no
[1:09:45] come on now
[1:09:50] and do not the truth if we walk in the
[1:09:53] light as he is in the light
[1:09:55] amen think about this now this is the
[1:09:58] difference between a brother and a
[1:09:59] non-brother
[1:10:02] if we were in the light if two brothers
[1:10:04] walk in the light and see we will have
[1:10:07] fellowship one with another
[1:10:09] how many believes that
[1:10:11] if you and i are both
[1:10:13] seeking the truth and seeking more of
[1:10:14] god we're going to have fellowship
[1:10:17] but if there's somebody with the wrong
[1:10:18] motive or objective we're not going to
[1:10:20] have fellowship
[1:10:22] huh
[1:10:26] and the blood of jesus christ is god's
[1:10:29] son cleanses us from all unrighteousness
[1:10:34] amen
[1:10:39] before i begin with
[1:10:41] talking a little bit about what darkness
[1:10:43] is what light is
[1:10:46] let me just finish this quote
[1:10:49] after he said talking about
[1:10:52] we're facing this year both darkness and
[1:10:54] light the world is one of the most
[1:10:55] chaotic times of darkness it's ever
[1:10:57] stood in and yet it's standing again
[1:11:01] in the most blessed light that has ever
[1:11:04] shined
[1:11:10] i believe i'm standing in the most
[1:11:12] blessed light that has ever shined
[1:11:15] and if you
[1:11:16] and the light that god has sent for this
[1:11:18] day
[1:11:20] amen
[1:11:21] let me just explain what this light is i
[1:11:23] ain't going to get into it too much but
[1:11:25] we know that
[1:11:27] we went through what they called the
[1:11:28] dark ages
[1:11:30] huh
[1:11:31] when catholicism the catholics yes
[1:11:34] that's right the pope of rome
[1:11:37] and his church
[1:11:38] are responsible for the murder of 68
[1:11:42] million christians through the dark ages
[1:11:47] they'll never shed that off of their
[1:11:49] back
[1:11:50] let me say this he is the antichrist
[1:11:56] on his crown it says vicarius felide
[1:12:00] which means instead of the son of god
[1:12:02] and in roman numerals if you'll add all
[1:12:05] those neuroma
[1:12:07] roman numerals up
[1:12:09] it comes to 666.
[1:12:13] and it's the number of a man huh
[1:12:16] he was responsible for dark ages do you
[1:12:18] realize in the dark ages that they would
[1:12:20] take christian literature and all that
[1:12:22] and they would burn all those books they
[1:12:24] didn't want the people to be smart
[1:12:27] they wanted in darkness
[1:12:30] huh
[1:12:31] anybody that didn't
[1:12:33] bow down to what they said and even bow
[1:12:36] down to the crucifix
[1:12:38] because they had that as an idol
[1:12:40] and the christians knew that that's what
[1:12:42] their theirs that crucifix was for them
[1:12:44] was an idol
[1:12:46] and they wouldn't do it
[1:12:47] i only bow to jesus christ not what you
[1:12:49] make me to bow down to
[1:12:51] and they would die by the millions
[1:13:00] you and i will never be able to
[1:13:02] comprehend in our mind the suffering the
[1:13:05] torture
[1:13:06] and the horribleness that our brothers
[1:13:08] and sisters experienced during those
[1:13:10] ages
[1:13:12] you can read martyr's mirror you can
[1:13:14] look at all those things
[1:13:16] you know and it is gory just to talk
[1:13:19] about pregnant mothers having their
[1:13:21] babies ripped out and fed to pigs
[1:13:24] and things like that just very it was
[1:13:25] very very bad
[1:13:28] all in the name of christianity tell me
[1:13:31] now i understand why it's called the
[1:13:33] dark ages
[1:13:35] how many knows we're going back really
[1:13:38] really fast into dark ages
[1:13:45] i am seeing more and more that what we
[1:13:48] call the left
[1:13:50] and conservativism
[1:13:52] is christianity people hate christians
[1:13:57] huh
[1:13:58] they're going to the supreme court the
[1:14:00] justices to protest now they're coming
[1:14:02] to your church to protest
[1:14:04] what's next
[1:14:06] how many of those it'll get worse
[1:14:09] why because they used to didn't care you
[1:14:12] said they just smoked their joints and
[1:14:13] be in happy happy land
[1:14:15] but not anymore all of a sudden
[1:14:17] everybody woke up
[1:14:20] let me tell you something they woke up
[1:14:22] because the devil got on them
[1:14:25] they're full of devils
[1:14:27] and they want to
[1:14:28] oh boy even to talking about any votes
[1:14:32] for trump you know he's in a cult
[1:14:35] you know things like that when it's your
[1:14:37] privilege to be able to vote for who you
[1:14:38] want to
[1:14:40] huh but it's demons that's really risen
[1:14:44] up
[1:14:45] and it's going to get chaotic how many
[1:14:47] knows it's going to be dark ages again
[1:14:48] after a while really really really bad
[1:14:52] but said they'll close places like this
[1:14:54] down you don't have to feed them anymore
[1:14:57] and we're almost at the place where
[1:14:59] we're fixing to see somebody outside
[1:15:02] huh coming at us coming after they want
[1:15:04] to come after us
[1:15:06] the devil
[1:15:07] wants to come after us
[1:15:09] amen
[1:15:11] i believe the prophet said you know the
[1:15:12] devil is powerless the power he doesn't
[1:15:14] hardly have any power unless he's got
[1:15:17] somebody to work through
[1:15:19] how many knows and the devil he's got
[1:15:21] somebody to work through
[1:15:23] but so does
[1:15:25] god
[1:15:26] he knows god has somebody to work
[1:15:27] through to so you look at these dark
[1:15:29] ages and you look at the minds of how
[1:15:32] everybody was and you compare that today
[1:15:36] amen and you look at even our
[1:15:38] politicians who wish their adversaries
[1:15:41] dead and if they die good riddance
[1:15:44] huh
[1:15:48] that's where their mind is that's how
[1:15:50] dark it's getting amen
[1:15:55] now
[1:15:56] let's go into the meaning of darkness
[1:15:57] and first of all let me say this
[1:16:00] that
[1:16:02] darkness came in
[1:16:04] in the garden of eden that's where
[1:16:05] darkness come in
[1:16:07] under the serpent right
[1:16:10] the serpent that beguiled eve and she
[1:16:12] had a son named cain
[1:16:15] right
[1:16:16] and the attribute of this young man
[1:16:18] was that he become jealous
[1:16:22] now he knows jealousy
[1:16:25] is an attribute
[1:16:27] of darkness
[1:16:32] huh
[1:16:35] if somebody
[1:16:39] messed around with your wife or your
[1:16:40] wife mess around with somebody you
[1:16:42] become jealous
[1:16:44] very jealous
[1:16:46] isn't that right
[1:16:48] and if you didn't care if he wasn't
[1:16:50] careful
[1:16:51] and if you didn't have the holy ghost
[1:16:54] that jealousy would become hatred
[1:16:58] you'd hate that person and you'd hate
[1:17:00] your your companion
[1:17:03] he's hater
[1:17:06] and if you let that eat at you just like
[1:17:08] he was with cain
[1:17:10] he let that eat at him and eat at him
[1:17:12] until he hated his brother
[1:17:15] because god showed him favor he wanted
[1:17:17] to get rid of him all together
[1:17:20] huh
[1:17:22] and it was so powerful the power of
[1:17:24] darkness was so powerful that it caused
[1:17:28] cain to get an attitude that he could
[1:17:29] take a rock or whatever and hit abel
[1:17:32] right over the head
[1:17:34] and smash him and i don't know how many
[1:17:35] times how many knows when people kill
[1:17:37] each other they don't just hit him once
[1:17:38] and twice they'll stab him a hundred
[1:17:40] times
[1:17:41] fifty times just keep on stabbing and
[1:17:43] stabbing his having a stab or hitting
[1:17:45] and hitting it
[1:17:46] that's the power of darkness
[1:17:50] folks how many knows you don't want no
[1:17:51] part of that
[1:17:53] no you don't want no part of jealousy
[1:17:56] huh
[1:17:57] you don't want no part of uh envy you
[1:18:00] don't want no part of hatred
[1:18:03] huh
[1:18:05] because it's darkness
[1:18:07] and it has to do with unbelief
[1:18:10] hello
[1:18:11] there's only two powers once the power
[1:18:13] of light wants the power of darkness
[1:18:15] on the contrast let me look at one for
[1:18:18] just a minute and the other part is on
[1:18:20] the part of light
[1:18:22] now how many knows that god is light
[1:18:25] god is light
[1:18:27] and the bible says his first john i
[1:18:29] believe it was and his life was the
[1:18:31] light of men
[1:18:33] am i right his life was the light of men
[1:18:36] now jesus says i am the light of the
[1:18:38] world another place that you are the
[1:18:40] light of the world how many knows you
[1:18:42] can't be the light of the world unless
[1:18:43] you have his life
[1:18:45] you can't have light in here unless you
[1:18:48] have god's life in here that's why it
[1:18:50] takes more than just the repentance at
[1:18:52] the altar and having your sins
[1:18:54] forgetting forgiven it takes a feeling
[1:18:57] of the holy spirit
[1:18:59] to empower you
[1:19:01] but as many believe saint john 12 and
[1:19:03] about 9 or 10 it says but as many
[1:19:05] believed him to them gave him the power
[1:19:09] to become sons and daughters of god
[1:19:13] notice he gives you power
[1:19:15] how many knows that he gives you power
[1:19:17] for a reason
[1:19:19] amen
[1:19:21] that power is to overcome
[1:19:27] because guess what
[1:19:29] let me ask you a question i know you'll
[1:19:31] get this quick in every church age that
[1:19:33] he wrote of in chapter 3 of revelations
[1:19:35] 1-3 he says to him
[1:19:38] that
[1:19:41] overcometh will grant i grant to sit
[1:19:44] with me in my throne even as i
[1:19:47] overcame
[1:19:49] the only kind that that god is going to
[1:19:51] have with him is those who have the
[1:19:54] power to overcome the strength to
[1:19:56] overcome
[1:19:59] something on the inside that causes you
[1:20:02] gives you the strength to overcome
[1:20:06] it's like worship man you could have it
[1:20:07] ritualistic or you could have it coming
[1:20:10] from your heart
[1:20:11] that's what god wants god wants you to
[1:20:13] be sincere he wants you to mean it he
[1:20:15] wants you to have power in there that's
[1:20:16] the only thing he accepts
[1:20:20] power to overcome the devil the power to
[1:20:22] overcome all evil
[1:20:26] praise the lord
[1:20:29] the power to turn your frown
[1:20:32] into a smile
[1:20:34] to give you joy
[1:20:36] i believe it was how many knows there's
[1:20:37] power and joy
[1:20:40] when you're happy you're a different
[1:20:41] person
[1:20:43] your outlook is different
[1:20:50] everything about you and david said the
[1:20:52] joy of the lord
[1:20:54] is my strength
[1:20:58] we should be so happy
[1:21:00] we can't hardly stand ourself
[1:21:03] we should have joy unspeakable and full
[1:21:05] of glory
[1:21:07] folks if your life ain't like that you
[1:21:09] aren't where you are to be in christ
[1:21:12] amen praise the god praise be to the
[1:21:15] lord
[1:21:17] amen you love him
[1:21:19] to think about it
[1:21:22] the power
[1:21:23] of
[1:21:24] light now
[1:21:26] just for a minute
[1:21:27] on the other hand we have
[1:21:29] hatred or jealousy
[1:21:32] power darkness
[1:21:36] i should back up just a minute can i
[1:21:40] the power of darkness
[1:21:47] is brought upon a person because
[1:21:49] they're disobedient to god
[1:21:52] disobedient to the word
[1:21:55] isn't that what cain was first
[1:21:58] he was disobedient
[1:22:00] he would not do like his brother said
[1:22:02] like god told him to do
[1:22:04] disobedient
[1:22:06] then all kinds of other things come in
[1:22:07] if you want to open yourself up to all
[1:22:09] the devils of hell just don't do what
[1:22:11] god says do
[1:22:15] can i just show you a little revelation
[1:22:17] lord give me this last week
[1:22:19] this last week the lord showed me that
[1:22:21] every little thing that you do that's
[1:22:23] contrary to the word
[1:22:26] is a curse to you
[1:22:29] as a christian god is going to correct
[1:22:31] you every little
[1:22:33] thing
[1:22:39] hey
[1:22:40] and that's down to your thoughts
[1:22:43] right down to your thoughts be careful
[1:22:46] what you think
[1:22:50] because everything about what you are is
[1:22:52] what you take in
[1:22:54] you take in and you become what you take
[1:22:57] in
[1:22:59] amen
[1:23:01] you must always think the right thoughts
[1:23:06] have a positive testimony that right
[1:23:10] that's not always easy to do but you
[1:23:12] always want to do it
[1:23:14] no matter what
[1:23:17] state you find yourself in
[1:23:20] okay so we have the power of
[1:23:22] disobedience brought
[1:23:24] envy against his brother brought hatred
[1:23:27] and ultimately
[1:23:29] murder
[1:23:31] death
[1:23:33] that's where darkness takes you
[1:23:39] how many knows we've been delivered from
[1:23:40] the power of darkness
[1:23:43] we've been delivered from hatred
[1:23:45] we don't hate anybody
[1:23:47] i mean you gotta love everybody
[1:23:50] it makes me love everybody
[1:23:55] on the opposite doctor this people they
[1:23:57] consist me i just hate everybody
[1:24:00] i hate everybody
[1:24:02] i'm gonna go shoot them all that's what
[1:24:04] they try to do
[1:24:06] am i right they get up in these high
[1:24:08] rises and shoot as many they just hate
[1:24:09] the world they hate everybody works of
[1:24:12] darkness
[1:24:16] where would you be folks if you would
[1:24:18] have been translated
[1:24:20] pull out of darkness into this light
[1:24:24] we'll walk in the light such a beautiful
[1:24:28] light
[1:24:31] folks i don't wanna
[1:24:33] i don't wanna live depressed
[1:24:35] you don't wanna live depressed
[1:24:37] you don't wanna live in the blues
[1:24:40] it's a horrible way to live
[1:24:44] amen me and my wife are talking and she
[1:24:46] says you know i'm not a negative person
[1:24:49] you know and i says i'm thankful you're
[1:24:51] not
[1:24:52] can you imagine having to live with
[1:24:53] somebody that's always negative and
[1:24:55] complaining and murdering it would be a
[1:24:57] terrible way to spend your old age
[1:25:00] a grouchy old man or a grouchy old woman
[1:25:04] huh
[1:25:05] what a terrible place to live
[1:25:08] something would have to give
[1:25:14] amen
[1:25:16] folks i would try to exercise what the
[1:25:19] prophet did very very much when his wife
[1:25:21] was all depressed and crying and the
[1:25:23] kids were screaming and she was small
[1:25:25] mind can't take it anymore
[1:25:28] she couldn't take it anymore
[1:25:30] are you with me
[1:25:32] and the problem of god
[1:25:35] says i can't live with this i can't do
[1:25:36] this
[1:25:38] i'm going to change the atmosphere
[1:25:40] and he got his apron on
[1:25:42] got over there and helped her with the
[1:25:43] dishes and talked about a pretty dress
[1:25:45] that he saw downtown maybe we could go
[1:25:47] get it
[1:25:51] in no time the kids were playing better
[1:25:53] they were getting along his wife was
[1:25:54] cheered up
[1:25:55] come on folks don't just beat him down
[1:25:57] for it
[1:25:58] pick him up you be the atmosphere you
[1:26:00] create that atmosphere isn't that right
[1:26:03] create your world
[1:26:06] everybody lives in the world of darkness
[1:26:08] or you live in the world of light
[1:26:10] there's only two factions you're living
[1:26:11] there this morning
[1:26:13] and even as a christian if you're still
[1:26:16] you know because there's just too many
[1:26:18] let me just say this there's just too
[1:26:19] many miserable christians
[1:26:22] and i just happen to understand and
[1:26:24] believe that they're not the kind of
[1:26:26] christians that they ought to be
[1:26:28] if they're still miserable there's still
[1:26:30] something really wrong
[1:26:33] huh
[1:26:35] amen we don't want to be miserable
[1:26:36] christians that's not how god intended
[1:26:38] for us to be
[1:26:39] god loves for his people have fullness
[1:26:41] of joy
[1:26:43] amen
[1:26:44] they have peace in their heart
[1:26:47] the other side for a minute the number
[1:26:49] one thing is of course we know that god
[1:26:50] is light
[1:26:51] right
[1:26:52] and also the bible says that god is love
[1:26:57] he is love
[1:26:59] that's what god is
[1:27:02] how many believes that
[1:27:04] in first john 2 and verse 9 it says he
[1:27:07] that saith that he is in the light
[1:27:10] and hateth his brother huh
[1:27:13] is in darkness even until now
[1:27:17] so you've got hate in your heart
[1:27:19] remember that's not god
[1:27:22] that's darkness in there
[1:27:24] huh
[1:27:27] now the next verse says two verses and
[1:27:29] he says he that loveth his brother
[1:27:31] abideth in light and there is not
[1:27:34] occasion of stumbling
[1:27:36] in him
[1:27:37] but he that hateth his brother is in
[1:27:38] darkness and walketh in darkness and
[1:27:41] knoweth not whether
[1:27:43] he goeth because
[1:27:45] that darkness has blinded his eyes
[1:27:56] let's talk about that for just a minute
[1:28:04] in revelations
[1:28:06] 3
[1:28:09] and verse
[1:28:10] 17
[1:28:12] this church age and remember that god is
[1:28:14] dressed addressing and brother brother
[1:28:17] danny mentioned this wednesday
[1:28:18] god is addressing the church now
[1:28:21] not the world but this church his church
[1:28:23] that's supposed to be his church and it
[1:28:25] was the laodicea church age which was
[1:28:27] the last church age this is where we're
[1:28:29] in
[1:28:30] and they say that they're rich and
[1:28:32] increased with goods don't need nothing
[1:28:35] don't know that thou art wretched and
[1:28:37] miserable poor and blind
[1:28:40] get that blind
[1:28:43] and
[1:28:44] make it
[1:28:47] amen
[1:28:53] he that
[1:28:54] hated his brother is in darkness and
[1:28:57] walketh in darkness and knoweth not
[1:28:59] whether he goeth so somebody that's
[1:29:01] blind
[1:29:02] tell me something can they is there any
[1:29:04] light
[1:29:08] if you want to you can close your eyes
[1:29:09] for just a minute
[1:29:13] i don't know i don't know about you but
[1:29:14] if you're not
[1:29:15] looking now you can open but for me i'd
[1:29:18] like to feel the edge now you can get up
[1:29:19] and walk around a little bit but when i
[1:29:20] ain't got my eyes up
[1:29:22] the bible talks about
[1:29:24] let the blind lead the blind and they'll
[1:29:26] stumble and fall into the ditch
[1:29:28] am i right
[1:29:29] in other words they don't know where
[1:29:31] they are in darkness the church world
[1:29:34] folks is in darkness
[1:29:41] i believe it was in 63
[1:29:44] and the pope went to visit jerusalem
[1:29:47] and in that time frame there was an
[1:29:49] eclipse where the sun went completely
[1:29:52] out when he went over there
[1:29:54] but abram said it was significant
[1:29:57] because in this age according to him he
[1:29:59] says this is the age that goes
[1:30:02] completely
[1:30:03] black
[1:30:07] i was reading
[1:30:10] but brother says you know anymore you
[1:30:12] can't barely find christian churches
[1:30:15] he says you'll just find a little group
[1:30:17] here or a little group there once in a
[1:30:20] while you'll find a church that's on
[1:30:21] fire for god
[1:30:23] that's real genuine church you don't
[1:30:24] hardly find it anymore
[1:30:28] because this is the age of complete
[1:30:30] apostasy or complete blackout
[1:30:37] and if you'll see here
[1:30:38] i think in the original
[1:30:41] the spirit told him to just leave a
[1:30:43] little sliver of light in that last one
[1:30:44] but if you'll notice he says it goes
[1:30:46] completely dark
[1:30:48] just like the sunday the type of
[1:30:51] this is the
[1:30:52] when the holy spirit will be lifted
[1:30:55] then it'll be no light at all it'll be
[1:30:57] complete
[1:30:58] darkness
[1:31:02] back to my thought
[1:31:05] the other thing that god is and light is
[1:31:07] first of all is
[1:31:09] he's love
[1:31:11] love your brother
[1:31:13] huh
[1:31:13] how can you say that you love god if you
[1:31:15] can't love
[1:31:17] your brother
[1:31:19] love your fellow humans
[1:31:22] amen
[1:31:28] so love is of god he the bible says he
[1:31:30] that loveth is of god and he that loveth
[1:31:32] not is not of god because god is love
[1:31:37] now what does love there's that's one
[1:31:39] power that's the most powerful force
[1:31:45] two of the most brothers everything in
[1:31:47] god is most powerful because even prayer
[1:31:49] can be the most powerful huh faith can
[1:31:52] be the most powerful
[1:31:54] love can be the most powerful force
[1:31:56] there is in the world it's power
[1:31:59] how many knows
[1:32:00] oh my you let somebody start smacking
[1:32:04] your kids around
[1:32:05] daddy might send back hey
[1:32:08] but mama she'll be all over that person
[1:32:11] don't you dare touch my
[1:32:13] scratch before you 18 nobody come
[1:32:15] unleashed like a mother hen
[1:32:18] somebody's messing around with every
[1:32:19] little baby
[1:32:20] huh
[1:32:21] you ain't got to tell her you ain't got
[1:32:23] to say honey you ought to protect your
[1:32:24] child better huh no
[1:32:26] there's a power that comes up inside
[1:32:28] called the
[1:32:30] power of motherhood
[1:32:34] folks i'm telling you it's so powerful
[1:32:36] oh my
[1:32:38] and if you love god folks that's why we
[1:32:40] come to church and do what we do because
[1:32:41] we love god not because we have to not
[1:32:44] because somebody it's just something in
[1:32:46] us
[1:32:47] like that woman remember
[1:32:49] that ran into that fire was all
[1:32:51] disfigured the firemen wouldn't even go
[1:32:53] in anymore
[1:32:54] told her to stay out she ran right
[1:32:56] through the blaze and got her baby and
[1:32:58] come covered with a blanket
[1:33:01] and her face got all melted and deformed
[1:33:03] and looked hideous and
[1:33:06] terrible
[1:33:08] huh
[1:33:10] but all she cared about with that
[1:33:12] hanging skin and whatever it was she
[1:33:14] opened that's my baby
[1:33:16] that's much ah
[1:33:18] that's real motherhood
[1:33:23] you know there's another black woman
[1:33:24] that they seen go up on the bridge and
[1:33:26] cast her baby off the bridge
[1:33:29] he says that's not a mother she might
[1:33:30] have had a child but she's not a mother
[1:33:33] motherhood is something much deeper than
[1:33:35] that something that cares for that baby
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:41] my
[1:33:44] the power of motherhood the power of
[1:33:47] love
[1:33:48] that's why the number one thing the
[1:33:50] church ought to have is love one for
[1:33:52] another how many believes that
[1:33:54] we're gonna have fervent love
[1:33:56] one for another
[1:33:59] amen
[1:34:00] and love what another thing is about
[1:34:03] light is
[1:34:05] love
[1:34:06] brings
[1:34:07] forgiveness
[1:34:09] i mean i said god so loved the world he
[1:34:10] gave his only begotten son he gave
[1:34:12] forgave the whole world
[1:34:15] that whosoever should believe in him
[1:34:17] should not perish he pardoned and wrote
[1:34:20] the pardon of the whole world
[1:34:23] like i said the other sunday it's like
[1:34:25] he made a mistake and said whosoever
[1:34:26] will
[1:34:27] he could have said and mine elect or
[1:34:29] whom i have chosen huh
[1:34:32] but he said whosoever will
[1:34:34] he wants cain to come he wanted judas to
[1:34:37] be saved
[1:34:39] god is not willing to man he should
[1:34:40] perish the bible says
[1:34:43] huh he's
[1:34:44] not but he knows who's he is who he
[1:34:47] isn't
[1:34:48] he knows who will and who won't
[1:34:51] doesn't take away from his foreknowledge
[1:34:53] and his predestination and so forth
[1:34:56] but he put it out there for everybody
[1:35:00] amen
[1:35:03] how does saint john first john not first
[1:35:05] john but saint john 3 says something
[1:35:07] about he loved the world he says and he
[1:35:09] was the light of the world but men love
[1:35:12] darkness rather
[1:35:14] than light
[1:35:16] you know that's the problem is people
[1:35:18] love
[1:35:19] darkness rather than light
[1:35:22] people would hope not rather hold a
[1:35:24] grudge against somebody as to forgive
[1:35:26] them for it
[1:35:29] huh
[1:35:30] did a whole lot rather walk around with
[1:35:33] bitterness and a long face because i'll
[1:35:35] tell you what the bible says if you hold
[1:35:37] one sin against one person
[1:35:39] neither will your heavenly father
[1:35:41] forgive you of your trespasses if you do
[1:35:43] not forgive every man whose trespasses
[1:35:45] against you
[1:35:47] you walk around with bitterness you walk
[1:35:49] around with holding something and god
[1:35:50] don't even forgive you and you're going
[1:35:52] to continue to hold that bitterness
[1:35:55] because you just won't let go
[1:35:57] and you just won't surrender
[1:36:01] huh
[1:36:02] you won't surrender to god
[1:36:06] now here's a thought
[1:36:07] the bible paul said you know no man
[1:36:09] lives to himself and no man dies to
[1:36:12] himself he says you're going to serve
[1:36:14] somebody
[1:36:16] how many knows you are going to
[1:36:18] surrender to some one of those powers
[1:36:22] you're going to give yourself to one of
[1:36:24] those powers you're gonna be controlled
[1:36:27] by one of those powers
[1:36:30] either sadness and despair
[1:36:32] depression
[1:36:33] hatred
[1:36:35] bitterness
[1:36:38] oh my let me just say to this to this
[1:36:40] everybody in this world folks
[1:36:45] if you don't take the side of light and
[1:36:47] forgiveness there is so much human
[1:36:50] fallibility
[1:36:52] that you're going to be all kinds of
[1:36:54] bitter
[1:36:58] we as human beings are so fallible so
[1:37:01] full of mistakes
[1:37:03] we stick our foot in our mouth so many
[1:37:05] times we say things that's hurtful
[1:37:10] we do things that's not good and then
[1:37:12] when we don't do something somebody gets
[1:37:14] upset
[1:37:16] you're bound to lose one way or the
[1:37:18] other you're bound to make a mistake
[1:37:19] you're bound to do things wrong
[1:37:22] amen
[1:37:24] why do you think pastors don't
[1:37:25] fellowship with nobody
[1:37:27] they go out that door and go to their
[1:37:29] car and i'll see you next time i come up
[1:37:31] here to preach
[1:37:32] i ain't playing volley
[1:37:34] volleyball with you i'm doing this
[1:37:36] so they say away
[1:37:38] why
[1:37:41] because
[1:37:42] if they're their self
[1:37:44] you're going to see their fault
[1:37:46] you're going to see where they're human
[1:37:48] beings
[1:37:49] i know preachers i know famous preachers
[1:37:52] hello i've dealt with them i know
[1:37:54] they're false and i ain't even going to
[1:37:56] hear me hear and tell you about it
[1:37:58] because it would carry your mind but i'm
[1:38:00] here to tell you i don't care if it's
[1:38:01] donny reagan i don't care if it's in him
[1:38:03] they're human beings they're fallible
[1:38:06] they're not perfect
[1:38:14] and you find out how your pastor is when
[1:38:16] you get around him and so forth and do
[1:38:18] things
[1:38:19] and if you can't deal with that
[1:38:21] fallibility if you can't deal with that
[1:38:23] fault
[1:38:25] huh then you go say well brother bile is
[1:38:27] this way brother vows that way why do
[1:38:28] you think we want to go hide
[1:38:30] huh
[1:38:32] but yet we don't do we no i play
[1:38:34] volleyball with you i go hunting with
[1:38:36] you i do whatever
[1:38:37] you know
[1:38:40] because i'm not going to go hide i don't
[1:38:41] believe in hiding i like to fellowship
[1:38:43] with my sheep
[1:38:44] amen i'd like to get so close to you
[1:38:46] until i smell like it
[1:38:54] why'd you say that well brother bob says
[1:38:56] his shepherd lives and sleeps with his
[1:38:57] sheep until he gets a smell i'm like i'm
[1:38:59] almost
[1:39:00] uh
[1:39:01] that's right
[1:39:03] i choose not to go that route people
[1:39:05] want to be critical and and so forth and
[1:39:08] be that way that's on you not me
[1:39:10] amen
[1:39:12] is that okay
[1:39:14] yeah that's right fellowship one with
[1:39:16] another love one another
[1:39:17] realize we make mistakes
[1:39:20] i'll tell you this when i see your
[1:39:22] how many knows why do i not get off of
[1:39:23] this for a minute
[1:39:26] is this all right
[1:39:28] because i'll tell you this right now
[1:39:29] when i see your fault
[1:39:31] yeah i don't come up here just jump on
[1:39:33] your fault or no i realize that person
[1:39:35] needs prayer
[1:39:37] huh
[1:39:38] and i need prayer i sure ain't gonna
[1:39:40] hold nothing again no but we're all a
[1:39:42] little different
[1:39:43] and every one of us has a little bit of
[1:39:46] a fault in a different way we're
[1:39:48] different we are different huh
[1:39:53] some people might not like how
[1:39:54] boisterous or loud somebody is the other
[1:39:56] one while they're so quiet i wish they
[1:39:58] weren't so quiet and i wish that one
[1:39:59] wasn't so noisy
[1:40:03] hey if that's how they are embrace them
[1:40:06] say i like you just the way you are
[1:40:07] praise god
[1:40:13] because you know what
[1:40:15] one thing i've learned in my 60 years
[1:40:18] that takes god to change a person
[1:40:22] and a lot of people are the way they are
[1:40:25] because god made them that way
[1:40:28] that's the second part
[1:40:30] sure they can change if it's not for the
[1:40:31] good or whatever but to win their
[1:40:33] character i don't care what it is their
[1:40:35] character every person god made them
[1:40:37] that way and if god made you that way
[1:40:40] a lot of times you can't get away from
[1:40:42] it
[1:40:43] you're going to be that way how many
[1:40:45] agrees that you know people
[1:40:47] but they just don't seem to change
[1:40:49] that's just how they are
[1:40:52] well why don't you just accept that now
[1:40:54] i don't say about sin and bad
[1:40:56] but their character in the way that they
[1:40:58] are is something that you have to learn
[1:40:59] to accept and say well god made that
[1:41:01] person that way
[1:41:02] amen
[1:41:05] amen
[1:41:07] folks you don't know how many times i've
[1:41:09] asked myself
[1:41:10] god
[1:41:12] why didn't you make me perfect i'm not a
[1:41:14] perfect
[1:41:15] why did you make me perfect why didn't
[1:41:17] you make me this way
[1:41:18] huh
[1:41:20] i've had it that many times
[1:41:25] then i read brother brad i read where
[1:41:28] brother branham said
[1:41:29] that god will make a pastor a certain
[1:41:31] way
[1:41:33] for that group of people
[1:41:35] i say well lord i guess this is how you
[1:41:37] want me to be
[1:41:38] you know
[1:41:40] hard-headed stubborn
[1:41:43] huh
[1:41:54] yeah
[1:41:55] when it comes to the word
[1:41:57] i won't deviate no no not for nobody i
[1:42:00] won't i don't care if you give a
[1:42:01] thousand dollars a week in tithing i'm
[1:42:03] not going to let off of your toes
[1:42:06] all right i don't care
[1:42:09] and and you try to pressure me not to be
[1:42:11] the pastor because you don't think i
[1:42:13] ought to be and you're going to go about
[1:42:14] in mean ways to try to get me not to be
[1:42:17] oh no you're talking to the wrong person
[1:42:20] here
[1:42:23] huh no sparks are going to fly
[1:42:26] i'm not going anywhere unless god tells
[1:42:29] me to or you vote me out that's the only
[1:42:31] way
[1:42:32] huh
[1:42:33] because as long as i feel like god wants
[1:42:35] me here
[1:42:36] not all of hell is going to move it
[1:42:40] huh amen and when i see if it would be
[1:42:43] deceptive or wrong or mean then i
[1:42:45] realized that's not god
[1:42:47] you don't have to listen to that brother
[1:42:49] butler huh
[1:42:51] anyway that's just free i
[1:42:53] hope that helped but just the difference
[1:42:55] in character amen
[1:42:58] but to love one another despite
[1:43:01] the way they would how many i know you
[1:43:03] will after today we say lord help me to
[1:43:05] understand that that's just how that
[1:43:06] person is
[1:43:08] god has made him that way and it'll be
[1:43:10] god that has to change him a little bit
[1:43:13] because he's working on all of us isn't
[1:43:15] he
[1:43:15] and he's trying to perfect his character
[1:43:18] in each and every one of us
[1:43:20] amen hope i'm not going up too fast up
[1:43:23] there is she getting a little out of it
[1:43:28] there you go god bless you
[1:43:30] amen you love the lord
[1:43:35] all right
[1:43:36] we're gonna go short today maybe a
[1:43:37] little bit that okay
[1:43:39] now let's let's talk about
[1:43:42] how
[1:43:43] that we can have and possess
[1:43:46] god's power
[1:43:48] god's power
[1:43:50] oh my i love god's power how many love
[1:43:52] god's power let's give him a hand say
[1:43:54] thank you jesus for your power
[1:43:57] thank you for your power lord
[1:44:02] i want that power but the man says today
[1:44:04] we got the wrong conception of power
[1:44:11] power
[1:44:12] is
[1:44:13] overcoming
[1:44:15] power is returning good for evil
[1:44:20] huh
[1:44:23] didn't even jesus say to those murderers
[1:44:27] pharisees
[1:44:29] he said forgive them father
[1:44:31] for they don't know what to do how many
[1:44:34] knows when you've got light in here
[1:44:36] forgiveness the power of forgiveness
[1:44:40] it's powerful
[1:44:43] amen
[1:44:46] the power like jesus says in matthew
[1:44:48] to go the extra mile
[1:44:50] the power to turn the other cheek
[1:44:54] the power to speak good of those that
[1:44:57] speak evil of you
[1:44:59] see darkness oh my let me get down into
[1:45:02] church a little bit a little more
[1:45:04] pastoring is that okay
[1:45:06] people think gossip gossip
[1:45:09] backbiting that's all darkness
[1:45:13] that's all of darkness huh
[1:45:17] sulfuric acid
[1:45:20] but forgiveness
[1:45:21] long-suffering
[1:45:23] gentleness
[1:45:26] patience
[1:45:28] how many needs more patience
[1:45:32] more
[1:45:34] patience
[1:45:39] returning good for evil that's real
[1:45:41] power
[1:45:42] when you can love your
[1:45:45] enemy
[1:45:48] economy i mean you can't do that if
[1:45:50] you're not born again you can't do that
[1:45:52] without the holy ghost
[1:45:54] no you can't do it
[1:45:56] do good to those that do evil to you
[1:45:58] that's real power that's god's power to
[1:46:02] return takes a real man to return evil
[1:46:04] for good
[1:46:06] how many believe that
[1:46:08] that's what light does
[1:46:11] it stops the darkness
[1:46:13] it's the opposite of darkness
[1:46:16] where they hate
[1:46:18] we love
[1:46:19] where they want to kill you we forgive
[1:46:23] because they trespass against you just
[1:46:24] like you do them only you forgive
[1:46:28] and that right
[1:46:29] you forgive
[1:46:31] get it under the blood
[1:46:33] then brother bam says you know people
[1:46:35] want power
[1:46:36] and they don't really know
[1:46:38] what power is or is i would put it how
[1:46:41] to get power
[1:46:43] what goes with it
[1:46:46] and i call this
[1:46:47] the power
[1:46:49] of surrender
[1:46:52] the power of surrender
[1:46:58] isn't that right when a man surrenders
[1:47:01] himself to the devil it'll take five six
[1:47:03] cops to finally tackle him down
[1:47:07] if then
[1:47:08] legion had so many
[1:47:10] demon powers on him they couldn't even
[1:47:12] keep him with chains
[1:47:14] maybe we'll see a video someday of him
[1:47:17] breaking those chains this is what he
[1:47:19] used to do break chains they couldn't
[1:47:22] refrain him he wasn't in jail he was in
[1:47:25] the tombs
[1:47:27] huh people were scared you talk about
[1:47:29] scared they took the other road
[1:47:32] they weren't going down that road legion
[1:47:34] lane no no legion lane for me
[1:47:37] let the guy come out there and beat you
[1:47:40] over the head
[1:47:41] huh
[1:47:44] demon power right
[1:47:46] because he had what surrendered himself
[1:47:50] amen
[1:47:53] young people you get to be the age of
[1:47:56] 14 to 18. that's a dangerous time
[1:47:59] you know because you're at the age to
[1:48:01] where it's hard to spank your children
[1:48:03] at 14 and 15. it would come a time when
[1:48:06] i would quit beating my boys you just
[1:48:08] can't beat him as an adult you know it's
[1:48:10] not not the right thing to do
[1:48:14] but that's when you'll either
[1:48:16] fall in line
[1:48:18] hell
[1:48:19] isn't that right
[1:48:21] and if you do rebel you go against god
[1:48:24] then you begin to get spirits it can
[1:48:27] start with a simple thing like a lie
[1:48:30] then you'll make that lie right
[1:48:33] huh next time you cheat you do this
[1:48:35] after the other
[1:48:36] you do things behind mom and daddy's
[1:48:38] back they shouldn't do all the time
[1:48:41] demons coming in
[1:48:43] hello
[1:48:44] after a while i'm gonna run away from
[1:48:46] home huh that's a real strong demon yeah
[1:48:49] that's where he wants you to get out
[1:48:50] there you know how many parents have
[1:48:52] lost their children
[1:48:54] to
[1:48:55] uh drugs out there on the streets and so
[1:48:57] far because they overdosed and
[1:48:58] everything else go out there and go
[1:49:00] further and further and further
[1:49:04] until they're perhaps
[1:49:07] dead amen
[1:49:09] demons
[1:49:10] because they have surrendered themselves
[1:49:12] they have given themselves they have
[1:49:14] allowed themselves and it takes humility
[1:49:17] i mean it takes the power of humility
[1:49:21] to say yes mom i was wrong i'm sorry
[1:49:24] huh maybe they don't want to fess up to
[1:49:26] it just confess it just humble yourself
[1:49:29] young people
[1:49:30] confess your false one to another
[1:49:32] because that's the only way to clear it
[1:49:34] up
[1:49:35] humble yourself and that's the way we
[1:49:36] got to do to god unless we humble
[1:49:38] ourselves to god and say god you are
[1:49:40] right
[1:49:42] you'll never get anywhere as a christian
[1:49:44] or
[1:49:45] any of the power of god until you admit
[1:49:47] that god's word is the truth
[1:49:50] god is right
[1:49:55] amen
[1:49:56] so now notice talking about what really
[1:49:59] brings the power
[1:50:00] he says the way
[1:50:02] up is down
[1:50:04] huh
[1:50:06] paul remember he had a weakness
[1:50:09] he was weak he had a high vision wrong
[1:50:11] or something was and so forth and yet
[1:50:13] god said i have to take this away for
[1:50:14] because when you are weak paul says when
[1:50:17] i am weak
[1:50:18] then he is strong
[1:50:20] you got to be weak and this is my
[1:50:22] closing statement is let's be weak in
[1:50:24] our self so that he can be strong
[1:50:28] in us and that's what we truly believe
[1:50:31] on the way to church i said lord get
[1:50:33] thomas byler completely out of the
[1:50:35] picture i don't want him nowhere around
[1:50:39] how many with me i don't want myself
[1:50:41] anywhere around i want nothing but
[1:50:42] christ projected
[1:50:44] because that's the only way that people
[1:50:46] will see the light of god the light of
[1:50:48] the world
[1:50:50] in
[1:50:50] you
[1:50:52] everybody in here i know you may be
[1:50:54] going to sleep and think but listen
[1:50:56] let me ask you this question
[1:50:58] are you the light of the world
[1:51:01] you should be because jesus says you are
[1:51:04] the light of the world
[1:51:07] that kind deed that you need
[1:51:09] amen the bible says it lets your light
[1:51:11] so shine before men that they may see
[1:51:14] your
[1:51:16] good works that's how they tell is by
[1:51:18] the things that you do
[1:51:20] is what shows the light
[1:51:23] amen how many has ever
[1:51:25] been a light to somebody by throwing a
[1:51:27] tantrum tan tempered hammer
[1:51:31] no
[1:51:32] right it don't work but when you keep
[1:51:35] your calm they say how did you keep your
[1:51:37] calm and all that
[1:51:39] you know i was so mean to you and here
[1:51:40] you're nice to me
[1:51:43] that's not easy to die
[1:51:45] it takes the holy ghost and it is the
[1:51:47] true light
[1:51:48] our life is light
[1:51:51] amen
[1:51:56] if you want power
[1:51:59] see how humble
[1:52:00] you can get
[1:52:01] amen
[1:52:03] praise the lord
[1:52:06] buddy i'm going to tell you something if
[1:52:07] thomas pilots ever gets up here and
[1:52:09] thinks boy he can preach
[1:52:10] you can believe the next service is
[1:52:12] going to be horrible brother brad or
[1:52:13] that service is going to be poor power
[1:52:15] anytime you think that you can do
[1:52:17] something and you don't say i'm going to
[1:52:18] realize hey you are absolutely nothing
[1:52:22] remember stay that way by the rams just
[1:52:24] stay down there
[1:52:26] huh
[1:52:28] see how humble you can get get away from
[1:52:30] your whole world you think humble
[1:52:31] yourself before god he says then you've
[1:52:34] got more power than the man that runs
[1:52:36] all over the building and makes a great
[1:52:37] bunch of noise because why because you
[1:52:40] have been able to conquer yourself and
[1:52:43] commit yourself to christ
[1:52:46] i mean that's the greatest battle that
[1:52:49] any of us will ever have
[1:52:51] is completely surrendering and
[1:52:53] committing ourselves to god because your
[1:52:56] flesh does not want to commit your
[1:52:58] commit to god
[1:52:59] didn't want to come to church this
[1:53:00] morning
[1:53:01] i hope everybody was all ready but maybe
[1:53:03] some of us this morning was just at a
[1:53:05] place i don't know if i want to go
[1:53:07] huh
[1:53:09] and you have to conquer that
[1:53:10] thing i want to go fishing i want to go
[1:53:13] do this i want to go do that huh
[1:53:18] prayer in the morning
[1:53:19] read your bible
[1:53:22] amen try to be a witness to somebody
[1:53:23] else
[1:53:26] no the biggest
[1:53:27] enemy you'll ever fight it's not the
[1:53:29] devil
[1:53:30] amen because jesus whipped him at
[1:53:33] calvary
[1:53:35] jesus conquered everything for us at
[1:53:38] calvary all we have to do is completely
[1:53:41] surrender because
[1:53:42] let me say this
[1:53:44] you will commit yourself you will
[1:53:46] surrender yourself to one or the other
[1:53:50] paul says no man lives or dies to
[1:53:52] himself you can't serve yourself you're
[1:53:54] either going to serve the devil or god
[1:53:55] one of the other you have to make a
[1:53:56] choice
[1:53:58] so how much better is it for us to
[1:54:00] commit ourselves to god the holy spirit
[1:54:02] to humbles ourselves before him he says
[1:54:05] that's
[1:54:06] real power
[1:54:10] that's real power when you can
[1:54:13] completely commit yourself surrender
[1:54:15] yourself
[1:54:17] to god
[1:54:18] because he'll feel you how many knows
[1:54:20] he'll fill you with that holy ghost
[1:54:22] he'll keep you
[1:54:24] amen
[1:54:26] you show me a church that's humble real
[1:54:28] humble not arrogant just sweet
[1:54:31] humble church i'll show you a church
[1:54:33] that has favor and the power of god in
[1:54:36] it
[1:54:36] that's right that's the thing it takes
[1:54:39] humility
[1:54:40] humbling ourselves before god and
[1:54:42] letting god work through us
[1:54:45] not making not about making a lot of
[1:54:47] noise
[1:54:48] amen
[1:54:50] hey man i used to ride in a wagon
[1:54:53] going down the road
[1:54:54] and i'll tell you every lap every loose
[1:54:56] sport in that wagon every little noise
[1:54:59] when you know a bump it rattled and it
[1:55:01] carried on but when it was full of
[1:55:04] food for our cows and our horses
[1:55:07] on our way back
[1:55:09] it was just quiet you hear little
[1:55:14] little squeaking of the springs and this
[1:55:16] out of the other and the clacking of the
[1:55:18] horse's hoofs
[1:55:19] huh
[1:55:20] praise the lord you hear a little amen
[1:55:24] say praise god
[1:55:26] you hear a little squeak i like to hear
[1:55:27] a little squeak sometimes now let's not
[1:55:28] get too quiet
[1:55:30] amen but when you're full how many just
[1:55:33] once i just want to be full
[1:55:35] of the power of god

[1:55:45] fill me with the holy ghost
[1:55:47] make me like the
[1:55:49] saints of old and then healing and
[1:55:51] raising the dead
[1:55:53] amen burn holy spirit
[1:55:54] burn in me
[1:55:56] i don't know about you but that's my
[1:55:57] heart's desires for more
[1:55:59] of the holy spirit power and i don't
[1:56:01] know about you but i long to see
[1:56:03] more of the power of god working among
[1:56:06] us
[1:56:06] amen i believe the power of prayer maybe
[1:56:10] believes in the power of prayer
[1:56:12] don't never think prayer don't work
[1:56:15] jesus had to pray
[1:56:17] pray always
[1:56:19] daniel prayed
[1:56:22] god hears prayer he loves you for to
[1:56:24] communicate with him amen
[1:56:27] it brings god on the scene
[1:56:29] it stops the mouths of lions
[1:56:31] amen

[1:56:35] power of prayer
[1:56:36] amen you love the lord this morning
[1:56:38] stand with me we'll close
[1:56:41] with hum humbling ourselves bowing our
[1:56:44] heads and let's just have a word of
[1:56:45] prayer
[1:56:53] i hope somewhere and something was said
[1:56:55] perhaps about darkness and what it is
[1:56:58] somebody in here perhaps says but well
[1:57:00] i've still got some darkness in my life
[1:57:02] and i want it all gone
[1:57:04] i want all every bit of darkness out of
[1:57:06] my life this morning
[1:57:07] if you want to raise your hands lord i
[1:57:09] still have a little and i want it gone
[1:57:10] lord jesus i surrender myself to you
[1:57:12] lord i'm still not quite what i should
[1:57:14] be lord and i pray god as we raise our
[1:57:16] hands together

[1:57:24] to surrender to you
[1:57:26] every aspect of our life our hearts our
[1:57:28] minds our soul and our strength

[1:57:50] father and just help us lord each day
[1:57:53] each day

[1:57:56] and as you show father in our hearts and
[1:57:59] lives in little places lord still not
[1:58:01] quite what they ought to be lord jesus
[1:58:03] and that fine tuning we ask god that you
