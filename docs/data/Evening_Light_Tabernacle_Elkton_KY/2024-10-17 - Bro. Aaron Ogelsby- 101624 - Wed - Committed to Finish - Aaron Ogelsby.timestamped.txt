[21:30] wonderful friends here in this local
[21:32] assembly and I just say we love and
[21:34] appreciate you all very very much amen
[21:38] amen so we're going to read tonight
[21:39] Revelation
[21:41] 10 verse 7 we're just going to read this
[21:43] one verse it says but in the days of the
[21:46] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[21:49] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[21:52] be finished as he hath declared to his
[21:55] servants the prophets amen if pray the
[21:59] Lord will add a blessing as you take
[22:00] your seats tonight amen a't God good to
[22:03] us it's wonderful I always enjoy coming
[22:06] coming in the house of God midweek
[22:08] service and just laying aside what's
[22:10] what's happened already in the week and
[22:12] just allow the Lord to come and speak to
[22:13] us and refresh us amen and amen I'd like
[22:16] to speak to you tonight for a moment on
[22:18] on the thought committed to finish
[22:21] committed to finish you know it it what
[22:23] we read here is a a a very familiar
[22:26] scripture and and it speaks of of a
[22:28] finishing
[22:29] that's that's going to take place and
[22:30] and we believe that the voice of the
[22:32] seventh angel has has already sounded
[22:35] and it was the end time message amen I I
[22:39] I think if you'll just take the
[22:41] condition of the world around you and
[22:43] and come back and investigate in the
[22:45] scriptures and and begin to look at at
[22:47] the way it describes the end times I I
[22:50] believe that you'll that you'll begin to
[22:52] recognize we're definitely in the end
[22:54] time if if you haven't seen it already
[22:57] just just just look around a little a
[22:58] little bit and and you're going to see
[23:00] that that we are in the end time and so
[23:02] I believe this is the end time message
[23:04] amen the message of Malachi 4 is the end
[23:07] time message and and and it came and it
[23:10] it it finished up the restoration of the
[23:12] word it it finished all the Mysteries
[23:15] and and not only did it do that but it
[23:17] anointed a people and this message came
[23:20] and it anointed a people to finish and
[23:23] you say well to finish what brother Aon
[23:25] to to finish the race to be the last
[23:27] Runners on the course to to finish all
[23:30] that God has called us to be and also to
[23:32] finish all that he left for us to finish
[23:36] because he wants things done and he
[23:38] expects his bride to do it but the
[23:41] prophet of God says it like this he did
[23:43] not complete all his work while in his
[23:46] Earthly Ministry so now he works in and
[23:49] through the bride she knows that for it
[23:53] was not yet time for him to do certain
[23:55] things that he must now do but he will
[23:58] now now fulfill through the bride that
[24:01] work which he left for this specific
[24:04] time what a
[24:06] responsibility what a calling that we
[24:09] have so we we can't just get it in our
[24:11] head you know well I receiv received the
[24:13] message so now I'm just going to sit
[24:14] back and wait and the raptures coming
[24:16] that's not how this thing works there's
[24:17] things for us to do there's an anointing
[24:20] for us to operate under he says the
[24:22] works that I do shall you do also
[24:25] there's something for us to finish we
[24:27] can't just sit back we're not going to
[24:29] cross the finish line sitting still amen
[24:32] amen you know I I was fellowshipping
[24:34] with brother Tommy the day and I said
[24:35] you know the the message that called us
[24:37] out and I'm so thankful that we've been
[24:39] called out but the same message that
[24:41] called us out is the same message that's
[24:43] going to take us in to the promised land
[24:46] there's got to be a coming out and I'm
[24:48] thankful for that come out of her my
[24:49] people but how many people came out of
[24:52] Egypt and died in the wilderness how
[24:54] many of them came out of Egypt and they
[24:56] weren't willing to go into the land but
[24:58] I believe there's a people on Earth
[25:00] tonight that says I didn't just come out
[25:02] but I'm going to go in I'm going to
[25:04] possess everything that God called for
[25:07] me to possess in my life amen amen to
[25:11] finish the works of
[25:13] Christ and I believe in order for us to
[25:16] do that we're going to have to be
[25:17] committed to it we can't be halfway we
[25:21] can't be like sadical about it we got to
[25:23] be sold out to the word we got to be
[25:25] sold out to his will totally committed
[25:29] as as you might say we have to be
[25:32] Allin you know Satan's had 6,000 years
[25:35] to build a world of
[25:37] evil the the whole world is evil brother
[25:39] Bram says that God's Eden was
[25:41] established in righteousness but Satan's
[25:43] Eden is established in sin think about
[25:46] that it's established in sin the very
[25:49] foundation of the world that you're
[25:51] living in today is established in sin
[25:54] it's a it's a scientific Eden that
[25:56] denies the very existence of God it's an
[25:59] Eden that feeds from and it worships
[26:02] from the Tree of knowledge and in this
[26:04] environment you must be totally
[26:06] committed to the word fully sold out
[26:09] totally sincere because because the
[26:12] currents are so
[26:14] strong that that think about something
[26:16] that doesn't have any life of its own
[26:18] and you stand next to a raging River and
[26:21] you take and throw a piece of paper or
[26:23] something in there lifeless and what
[26:24] happens that piece of paper in those
[26:26] currents it's just Swept Away
[26:28] or you take somebody not strong enough
[26:30] to stand and put them in that same river
[26:33] and what's going to happen to them
[26:34] they're going to be swept away and what
[26:36] I'm telling you is that the the currents
[26:38] of this world the currents of unbelief
[26:40] the currents of sin they are so strong
[26:42] that if you're not anchored down if
[26:44] you're not sold out tonight that you're
[26:46] going to get Swept Away by those
[26:48] currents but I'd like to announce to you
[26:50] tonight there is an anchor that holds
[26:52] there is a rock that you can tie to
[26:54] tonight that you won't be pulled here
[26:57] and pulled there and Swept Away to
[26:59] destruction by the world but when the
[27:01] floods come and the floods go you'll
[27:03] still be standing there because the
[27:05] anchor hold
[27:07] tonight
[27:09] Hallelujah I always say if you're
[27:12] halfway in you'll eventually be all the
[27:14] way
[27:16] out you can't be halfway in tonight or
[27:19] eventually you're going to look around
[27:20] and say how'd I end up where I'm at
[27:22] tonight how did I end up so far down how
[27:25] how did I end up in this situation why
[27:27] is my life listen will take you further
[27:29] than you want to go well I'm just going
[27:31] to dabble in this and Dabble in that and
[27:33] pretty soon you're not just dabbling
[27:35] you're gone get all the way into the ark
[27:38] tonight get all the way into the ark
[27:41] tonight push your way in push your way
[27:44] in with with with
[27:45] desperation you got to be willing to
[27:47] fight tonight committed to
[27:50] finish
[27:53] Amen in
[27:55] Revelation you know they describe it
[27:57] describe all the spirits and the things
[28:00] as as a smoke coming up from a
[28:02] bottomless pit and you know how smoke is
[28:05] it gets into everything it ruins
[28:08] everything you you you go on a on a
[28:09] camping trip and and you know and you
[28:12] pack your bags up and come home and
[28:13] you're at home you're eight hours away
[28:15] from that campfire but open them bags up
[28:17] and what's it smell like smoke it gets
[28:20] in everything and Revelation describes
[28:22] this as a smoke out of the bottomless
[28:24] pit because that smoke will infiltrate
[28:27] every that's not
[28:30] sealed it'll get in and affect
[28:32] everything that that isn't sealed and
[28:34] and what's happening this day is it's
[28:36] beginning to get inside of people's
[28:37] minds to where they can't think clearly
[28:40] their mind is completely insane you
[28:43] don't believe me just go to
[28:45] Walmart just read the news if if you
[28:47] feel like fighting depression go go read
[28:49] the
[28:50] news and you can't you know trust that
[28:53] either I I I heard it said it says says
[28:55] a man who who don't listen to the news
[28:57] is
[28:58] uninformed and a man who does listen to
[29:00] the news is
[29:03] misinformed so what you going to do I'll
[29:05] tell you what how about the good news

[29:10] right way it'll always lift your spirits

[29:14] depressed I guarantee
[29:16] you but the world's going completely
[29:19] insane you just look around and and and
[29:21] and the world's falling apart at the
[29:22] seams it it doesn't even really take a
[29:25] spiritual person to recognize that you
[29:28] know I have friends you know nominal
[29:30] Christians and and you know 15 years ago
[29:32] or so you I talk to them about the end
[29:35] time or the coming of the Lord and
[29:36] they'd be like well I don't know if it's
[29:38] going to be in our lifetime you know and
[29:39] and it was always just this uh almost
[29:41] the Rapture was a fictional thing that
[29:43] maybe one day but even they're starting
[29:45] to say it's the end
[29:48] time it's the end of time so I'm telling
[29:50] you you don't you don't even got to be
[29:51] spiritual just wake up and open your
[29:53] eyes and thank God tonight listen this
[29:55] message was not a message of judgment
[29:58] this message warned of judgment so that
[30:00] means it was a message of Grace it came
[30:03] saying Grace Grace and it's telling you
[30:05] tonight there is a place of safety there
[30:07] is an arc you can get into you can be
[30:09] committed and sold out and sealed with
[30:11] the baptism of the Holy Spirit and not
[30:14] swept away in the currents of this
[30:16] modern world
[30:19] Amen the world's falling apart people
[30:22] don't know who they are and we've gotten
[30:23] to the place the world don't know what
[30:25] they
[30:26] are listen there's a thing brother
[30:29] Bor they called furries y'all ever heard
[30:32] of furries yeah where
[30:35] people it wasn't at my school when I was
[30:37] teaching school though there there was a
[30:39] teacher in the city that had a a legal
[30:42] battle and thank goodness they want it
[30:45] but they was getting in trouble because
[30:47] they they wouldn't meow back to a person
[30:50] that thought they was a
[30:52] cat the world's gone
[30:55] insane listen they look at us and go
[30:58] y'all are odd y'all are weird well
[31:00] listen if that's normal then call me odd
[31:03] call me weird I'll be this all day long
[31:06] before I go around meowing to people the
[31:09] world's lost its mind but thank God
[31:11] there is a seal of God that'll seal that
[31:14] out from your life
[31:16] tonight people don't know what they are
[31:19] and you know we look at it and we say
[31:21] those people are
[31:22] nuts those people are crazy and yet if
[31:25] it wasn't for the grace of God yeah if
[31:29] it wasn't for God's hand on our lives if
[31:31] it wasn't for his influence in our lives
[31:34] we could have lost our right mind as
[31:36] well because it's permeated everything
[31:39] in our society and and you even watch
[31:42] people who fall away from from from the
[31:43] word and fall away from the house of God
[31:45] and and it doesn't take long before
[31:48] their thinking about things begins to
[31:49] change their attitude towards sin begins
[31:53] to change and so it gets to the point
[31:55] that not only are they accepted of it
[31:57] but you see begin to defend it and
[31:59] promote it things that we would just
[32:01] automatically like like abortions and
[32:03] things of that nature and and all of a
[32:06] sudden you know somebody falls out from
[32:07] underneath the Godly influence and it's
[32:09] not long at all and all of a sudden
[32:11] they're for those things what happen
[32:14] they began to feed on a different
[32:16] influence they began to allow a
[32:18] different influence to take over their
[32:20] mind and and take over their their
[32:22] thinking they begin to view things
[32:24] through a different set of eyes amen and
[32:26] you say well brother Aaron I I would
[32:28] never do that I I never
[32:31] would if it's not for the grace of God
[32:34] not for the Seal of God you can say that
[32:37] tonight because we haven't given
[32:38] ourselves over to that mind we haven't
[32:41] given ourselves over to that type of
[32:43] thinking so you have your sanity tonight
[32:45] thank God your influence is from a
[32:48] different Source I say tonight let's
[32:49] stay in that Source let's get into the
[32:52] message listen listen it ain't just for
[32:54] the preachers or the deacons to get in
[32:56] the message it ain't just for them to
[32:58] read the books and listen to the tapes
[33:00] that was given to you behold I send unto
[33:04] you Elijah the prophet it's for you to
[33:07] dig it's for you to study it's for you
[33:09] to let God listen I've said it before if
[33:11] a preacher can stand there and preach
[33:13] false doctr to you for five years and
[33:15] you don't know it that's your
[33:17] [Music]
[33:19] fault you should be drinking the water
[33:21] yourself that way when you recognize
[33:24] that water coming over the pull pit you
[33:25] go yep that's what I've been drinking
[33:27] from if there's poison in the water
[33:30] you'll go nope that ain't the fountain
[33:31] I've been drinking
[33:33] from how you going to get LED astray if
[33:36] you've been drinking yourself and
[33:37] feeding yourself get into the message
[33:40] get into the word feed on it that's the
[33:43] source drink from that Source sell out
[33:46] to that Source it's a source of life
[33:50] tonight commit to his word and his
[33:52] thinking let this mind be in you tonight
[33:56] we got to lay us deide what we think
[33:59] because this flesh this mind no matter
[34:03] how spiritual we are we walk through
[34:06] life we walked through this world we
[34:10] were raised by in different
[34:12] homes you know we can all be filled with
[34:14] the Holy Ghost tonight brother Bor and
[34:16] still look at things a little different
[34:19] look at this situation different or act
[34:21] different in this situ cuz we all raised
[34:22] different we all got different DNA we're
[34:25] all wired differently to tonight is that
[34:29] right so so we got uh we got to lay
[34:32] aside what we think because if it comes
[34:34] right down to it we'll all operate
[34:36] differently what we think will get us in
[34:40] trouble if I look back in life at all
[34:42] the times I've messed up and done things
[34:44] wrong if IID have checked here first if
[34:47] I have searched through the message
[34:49] first if IID have followed his will
[34:52] first I wouldn't end up near bad a place
[34:54] as I ended up you know I believe with
[34:56] all my heart you can just chalk this up
[34:58] from from Brother aon's opinion so if
[35:00] you don't you know you can throw this
[35:01] away if you want to but I believe with
[35:03] all my heart that if you seek the will
[35:05] of God if you seek Him for every
[35:08] situation and then somehow through human
[35:11] ignorance you still mess up there's
[35:13] Grace for that there is Grace for that
[35:16] because God understood you were but look
[35:19] if you just go well I'm going to do this
[35:20] on my own because this is what I want to
[35:22] do and I don't care what pastor says I
[35:24] don't care what the Bible says I don't
[35:26] care well then when you end up in a man
[35:27] God's going to say you put yourself
[35:29] there now you're going to suffer the
[35:31] consequences and it's a lot harder to
[35:33] dig yourself out of those places just
[35:36] seek God's will put him first lay aside
[35:39] your thinking tonight and say Lord I
[35:41] want to be committed to your
[35:44] thinking amen lay aside the thinking of
[35:47] the world they're constantly trying to
[35:49] push things on you Daniel 1 and8 tells
[35:53] us says but Daniel Pro purposed in in
[35:57] his heart that he would not defile
[36:00] defile himself with the portion of the
[36:02] king's meat nor with the wine which he
[36:05] drank therefore he requested of the
[36:07] prince of the Unix that he might not
[36:10] defile himself listen just like us
[36:13] Daniel was in a foreign country he found
[36:16] himself surrounded by Evil by by by
[36:18] Traditions that were against everything
[36:20] he believed in by a culture that hated
[36:23] him and and a power that wanted to break
[36:26] him and mold him into their
[36:29] image I think Daniel's somebody we can
[36:31] all relate to today I don't feel home at
[36:34] home here anymore we're pilgrims and
[36:36] strangers we're just passing through
[36:38] this isn't this is not our our home and
[36:41] and society today is against everything
[36:44] we stand for you know if you went back
[36:46] in the 1950s you know and there were
[36:50] still elements of society brother berer
[36:53] that that were christian-based you could
[36:56] still hold your head up say this is a
[36:58] Christian
[36:59] Nation you know we had a president uh
[37:02] President Obama one of the few things he
[37:03] ever said that I agreed with is he stood
[37:06] up and said America is no longer a
[37:08] Christian Nation I said amen he told us
[37:11] the truth for once yeah amen it isn't no
[37:14] longer a Christian Nation it's drifted
[37:15] from its foundation it's drifted from
[37:18] its morals and it's it's got It's lost
[37:21] tonight and it's not a place that I can
[37:23] feel at home and Society is against
[37:25] everything we stand for and constantly
[37:28] there's a banquet of ungodliness placed
[37:31] before us and we're instructed eat from
[37:33] this feed from
[37:36] this well I don't have television in my
[37:39] home brother Aaron oh I
[37:48] know think about
[37:50] it and we feed and we feed and we feed
[37:54] Hey listen I'm not throwing ston at I
[37:56] spend way too much time on that stupid
[37:58] thing I I get
[38:01] it but now I think we might I just I I
[38:04] don't want people to compare how much
[38:06] time I SP spend on on devices and how
[38:09] much time's wasted versus how much time
[38:10] did you listen to messages this week
[38:13] sometimes I'll get that weekly report
[38:14] and I'll go I'll go God forgive
[38:16] me y'all ever look at your weekly report

[38:44] with ourselves that's all I'm not I'm
[38:46] just saying let's be honest with
[38:47] ourselves what what influences are we
[38:49] allowing to come in and this banquet of
[38:52] ungodliness is laid there and saying eat
[38:54] from it eat from it but Daniel purposed
[38:58] in his heart he was committed it doesn't
[39:01] matter how much they ridicule it doesn't
[39:04] matter what they offer me it doesn't
[39:06] matter what kind of trial I'm in I'm not
[39:09] going to let this world influence my
[39:11] thinking I'm not going to feed on what
[39:14] they're feeding on I'm not going to feed
[39:16] on their filth I'm not going to feed on
[39:17] their ideas I've been given something to
[39:20] feed from in this day we've been given a
[39:23] seven course banquet we've got all the
[39:25] messages you you can imagine if books
[39:27] and tapes and the same thing it's

[39:32] have the Bible we've got something to
[39:34] feed on in this day let's get back in
[39:37] there and be committed to the word of
[39:39] God committed Daniel desired a different
[39:44] diet he desired something different he
[39:47] didn't say well I can have just a little
[39:48] bit of that and surely I can have just a
[39:52] bite well come on
[39:55] Eve surely it's not that big a deal he
[39:59] said I will not defile myself with the
[40:03] king's meat and I'm committed tonight
[40:05] like Daniel I'm not going to defile
[40:07] myself on those things when he's given
[40:09] me the most wonderful thing I can feed
[40:11] on the message of the hour the restored
[40:14] word let's be committed to that tonight
[40:18] oh think about it those th those ones
[40:19] that were supposed to be molding Daniel
[40:22] said you're going to starve to
[40:24] death you're going to look bad if if you
[40:26] don't eat from from from from these
[40:28] things and what's wrong with our food
[40:30] you need to experience these things
[40:32] young
[40:33] people no no no no you need to try this
[40:37] the king of Babylon says this is what
[40:39] you're supposed to eat you need to be
[40:42] well-rounded you need to see what it's
[40:44] like in the real world no no no I will
[40:47] not defile myself I'm not going to eat
[40:50] with what that King saying I I'm like
[40:51] Daniel tonight compare us to those
[40:54] eating that King's food compare us
[40:57] tonight look at our homes look at our
[40:59] lives look at our young people well what
[41:02] what's so different how is this possible
[41:04] we're eating the diet of another king
[41:06] tonight we're feeding from another
[41:08] kingdom tonight and it's molding us not
[41:10] into this world's image but it's molding
[41:12] us into that Heavenly image
[41:15] Hallelujah glory to
[41:17] God Amen compare
[41:22] us we've been given a seven course
[41:24] spread in this day but you've got to eat
[41:27] the
[41:28] book what it say there in Revelation it
[41:31] showed a a little open
[41:33] book but it said you go take the book
[41:37] and then eat the book listen it does us
[41:41] no
[41:42] good for the message of the hour to have
[41:45] come for the Mysteries to be revealed
[41:47] for truth to be restored if you don't
[41:49] eat
[41:50] it it doesn't do us any good if we're
[41:53] not feeding on and we're not letting it
[41:54] mold us and change us and make us into
[41:56] his image amen amen God go God honored
[42:01] Daniel because of his commitment that I
[42:03] will not be defiled that I'm only going
[42:05] to eat what God's called me to eat and
[42:07] God will honor you just the same as he
[42:09] did
[42:10] Daniel Amen it's it's time as a church
[42:14] of a living God it's time for
[42:16] commitment God God has brought a people
[42:19] right to the crossing over right to the
[42:21] blending of Time and Eternity we're
[42:24] right here at this place
[42:27] and you know if you go back and look at
[42:29] the children of Israel right when they
[42:31] came up to the River to Cross into the
[42:33] promised land there was two and a half
[42:36] tribes it was uh
[42:38] Gad man half tribe of
[42:41] Manasseh what was the other one either
[42:44] way there was another
[42:45] tribe and they got there and they looked
[42:48] around and they said this is good enough
[42:50] for
[42:51] us this is good enough for us and they
[42:55] came to Moses and they said you know
[42:56] this land is better for cattle than the
[43:00] promised land and we've got a lot of
[43:04] cattle think about
[43:06] that we're right here at the crossing
[43:08] over don't start looking around at
[43:11] things to keep you

[43:15] accumulated in the journey I don't care
[43:17] how many cows you got there ain't no

[43:23] going to be fully blessed staying on
[43:25] this side I say tonight it's time to
[43:26] cross is over it's time to sell out it's
[43:29] time to say Lord wherever you're taking
[43:31] me that's where I want to go because if
[43:33] you want to be fully blessed you got to
[43:36] be in his will and it was not the will
[43:39] of God for them to stay outside the
[43:40] promised land we got to be committed to
[43:44] finish we're right here at the wrapping
[43:46] up of all things others have run their

[47:29] life where I'm not strung out on drugs I
[47:31] choose this life
[47:34] Hallelujah yes
[47:37] sir don't take an easier path it's not
[47:41] easier it's a deception that's right
[47:44] stay the
[47:45] course what was it that was told to
[47:47] brother brownon because thou H has
[47:49] chosen the Narrow Path the harder way
[47:52] thou Hast walked of your own choosing
[47:54] thou H has picked the correct and
[47:56] precise decision and it is my way I say
[48:01] Lord I want to go your way I want to
[48:03] walk on your path I don't care what I
[48:05] suffer here Lord just let me end up
[48:07] there with you
[48:11] Hallelujah Psalms 37 and5 says commit
[48:15] thy way unto the Lord trust also in him
[48:18] and he shall bring it to pass and he
[48:20] shall bring forth thy righteousness as
[48:23] the light and thy judgment as the noon
[48:25] day brother Bram uses this scripture and
[48:28] he says God can't move for you in any
[48:32] situation until you let go of
[48:35] it until you commit it to God you want
[48:39] an overcoming life I I I do you want a
[48:42] Victorious life but you're still holding
[48:45] on to your wants and your desires listen
[48:49] it's probably one of the most well-known
[48:51] you know scriptures there is but we so
[48:53] often forget it seek ye first
[48:57] notice it didn't say you're not going to
[48:59] get all these other things it didn't say
[49:01] it's wrong to to seek a career it didn't
[49:04] say it's wrong to want to have a nice
[49:06] house it didn't say it's wrong to want
[49:08] to advance in your
[49:10] job it said don't do that
[49:13] first put God first be committed to God
[49:16] first he'll take care of the rest of it
[49:19] you want to be blessed seek God
[49:22] first give him everything first it don't
[49:26] work that way way to where you're like
[49:27] well I'm going to do this this this this
[49:28] and God when I get to
[49:31] you no it's not going to work out for
[49:34] you put God first you have to commit
[49:36] everything to him brother Brown says
[49:38] we're always wanting God to run errands
[49:40] for us or do something for us but when
[49:43] we're willing to say thy will be done
[49:46] commit ourselves to him commit our ways
[49:49] to him all that we have committed to him
[49:53] that's when God will move when you're
[49:55] willing to let him work on you not you
[49:59] work on
[50:02] him God work on
[50:05] me God work on me you know so many times
[50:09] we we we look at things in a way of well
[50:13] is is is is this sinful or can I get
[50:15] away with this and how instead of just
[50:17] saying God does this please you God is
[50:20] this what you
[50:21] want not what can I get away with yeah
[50:25] God's a loving God he's not there
[50:26] looking going wh got him I'm sending
[50:29] that one to
[50:30] hell yeah yeah will God forgive you I'm
[50:32] sure he will but this is supposed to be
[50:35] a love affair right this is supposed to
[50:37] be God how can I please you that's when
[50:40] we get away from looking at the message
[50:42] in the Bible as rules and regulations
[50:45] and start looking at it as a love
[50:49] letter and you read and it's you know
[50:51] people say well why can't I why can't I
[50:53] why can't I go ahead you can he's
[50:56] telling you what pleases him that's
[51:00] right that's right what what pleases God
[51:02] is that you dress this way what pleases
[51:05] God is that you act this way what
[51:07] pleases God is that we live a life this
[51:10] way it's not rules and Regulation and
[51:13] him up there thumbing you down and
[51:14] you're going to do it's what pleases him
[51:17] and because we love him we want to
[51:20] please him amen amen but it seems like
[51:24] we commit so many we commit to so many
[51:28] other things other than the things of
[51:30] God look and I believe in Comm being
[51:32] committed in all things at your job you
[51:35] should be committed you should be
[51:37] committed to be the best you can be at
[51:38] your
[51:39] job as a daddy you should be
[51:42] committed as a mama you should be
[51:44] committed a as a friend you should be
[51:48] committed in all things we should do if
[51:51] you're GNA do something be committed but
[51:54] what I'm all I'm saying is quit letting
[51:57] your commitment to those things or
[51:59] anything outshine your commitment to
[52:03] God we commit to everything but then we
[52:05] won't commit to the things of God well
[52:08] I'm I'm committed to be a Christian but
[52:10] you won't commit to his word I'm
[52:12] committed to be a Christian but you
[52:13] won't commit to coming to the house of
[52:16] God let's be committed to the things of
[52:19] God Amen let's be committed to to to to
[52:23] the house of God and to the word of God
[52:25] and to the works of God
[52:27] whatever we have tonight let's give it
[52:28] all to him let's commit it to him let's
[52:31] sell out to him is what I'm trying to
[52:33] say because see God and the devil are
[52:37] both trying to get you to sell
[52:39] out God and the devil they're both
[52:42] trying to get us to sell out but in two
[52:43] different ways see God wants you to sell
[52:46] out all you are to him to give your all
[52:50] even the parts that you find
[52:52] insignificant the the little things
[52:56] because God can use the little things
[52:59] listen to this quote but if you're
[53:01] honest and sincere God can appear to you
[53:04] yet in a dream it goes to show that
[53:07] anything that you have anything whether
[53:11] it's your mind whether you can
[53:15] whistle sing testify or whatever you can
[53:20] do if your whole being is committed to
[53:22] God God can use it if you'll just let
[53:26] him do it but brother Aaron I don't have
[53:29] much to offer okay well then take that
[53:31] little bit you don't think as much and
[53:33] offer
[53:34] it take that little bit and give it to
[53:37] him see because we don't commit to God
[53:40] just so we can make it over to heaven we
[53:42] commit to God so that he can use us
[53:45] while we're here that's right oh well
[53:47] brother Aaron it's my life no it's not
[53:49] it's his life lent to you that you're
[53:52] supposed to use to bring glory to his
[53:54] name that's right you're life is on loan
[53:57] from him it's his
[53:58] life amen take that little thing and
[54:01] give it to him God will use whatever you
[54:04] give him even if any people around you
[54:07] don't think it's much that listen
[54:09] there's there's there's a scripture John
[54:11] 6 and8 and we're going to go into a
[54:12] little bit brother brandham tells the
[54:13] story he he dramatized it and
[54:15] illustrates it so well like only brother
[54:17] brandham can it's the story of of of the
[54:20] of the Loaves and Fishes and brother
[54:21] Brown talks about the little boy skipped
[54:23] school that day said he was going
[54:25] fishing and he was going fishing and he
[54:27] skipped school and he happened to notice
[54:29] this Gathering and he's drawn over to it
[54:31] and and and he's looking at he's
[54:33] listening for a little bit and it says
[54:36] it came time you know for them to eat
[54:38] and they didn't have food in John 6 and8
[54:40] says one of his disciples Andrew Simon
[54:42] Peter's brother said unto him there is a
[54:45] lad here which hath five barley Loaves
[54:50] and two fishes so let's just equate it
[54:52] to you that's what you have to offer
[54:57] and you over hear a deacon in the church
[54:59] say what the disciples said to Jesus but
[55:03] what are they amongst so
[55:06] many in other words the disciples said
[55:08] here's what the boy has to offer but
[55:10] that's
[55:11] nothing you hear a deacon in the church
[55:14] go not that you're Deacon what I'm just
[55:17] saying this is one of the disciples so
[55:18] I'm trying to make an illustration here
[55:20] are you hear a brother say yeah I mean
[55:23] yeah but that they can they do this and
[55:24] this but you know they're not really
[55:26] that important they're not really that
[55:27] needed how hurt we would
[55:30] be but brother brandham says that when
[55:34] they did come and ask him for it he said
[55:36] if it's for that man then you can have
[55:42] it think about it you ain't giving your
[55:45] gift to help me you're not giving your
[55:46] gift for those run you're giving it to
[55:48] that man and Jesus says I'll take it
[55:50] tonight I'll use what you got I'll use
[55:53] what little you can offer Let Jesus have
[55:55] it he says if it's for that man I say
[55:58] Jesus can have me tonight whatever I can
[56:00] offer it may not be much to anybody else
[56:03] but if it's for that man he can have it
[56:06] tonight
[56:08] hallelujah oh but my gifts just so
[56:10] insignificant so meaningless how could I
[56:12] ever impact others I even heard his
[56:15] disciples say what is this amongst so
[56:17] many but I love verse 11 John 611 starts
[56:21] off and Jesus Took the loaves
[56:26] he wants you he wants what you have to
[56:29] offer he can use what you have to offer
[56:31] he's looking for somebody give him some
[56:33] loaves tonight it ain't much but Jesus
[56:36] you can have it you can have every part
[56:38] of my life cuz I know you'll multiply it
[56:41] and you'll bless it and in your hands
[56:43] little is much so I'm going to turn it
[56:45] over I'm going to commit everything I am
[56:48] to Jesus
[56:49] tonight whatever you have to offer just
[56:53] say Jesus can have it whatever I've got
[56:55] Jesus can have it Amen brother Brown
[57:00] says here's what it teaches us God can
[57:02] use every faculty of our being if it's
[57:05] committed surrendered to him he can use
[57:08] our mind our dreams our subconscious our
[57:10] first conscious our tongue our songs our
[57:13] eyes my everything that we have can be
[57:17] used of God if it's committed to God see
[57:20] everything that you are committed to God
[57:23] he'll use every outlet and every part of
[57:25] you he'll use it no matter what it is
[57:27] he'll use it if it's Sanctified to his
[57:29] purpose and
[57:31] calling Hallelujah God's looking for
[57:34] people that will sell out to him now
[57:37] Satan's looking for sellouts
[57:39] too sure he wants you to be a
[57:43] sellout what's a sellout a person who
[57:46] compromises their personal values
[57:48] Integrity Talent gifts for money or
[57:52] personal advancement or an easier path
[57:54] to success to make a deal that
[57:57] compromises loyalty a
[58:01] traitor he's looking for people willing
[58:03] to compromise on the word he's looking
[58:06] for people to lay down their rights and
[58:08] just walk away he's looking for those
[58:10] that give up some of their standards for
[58:12] an easier path whether at work or school
[58:15] or trouble in the home well you know if
[58:17] we just give into this a little bit
[58:18] it'll bring peace don't don't don't
[58:20] don't you back off of one thing don't
[58:23] make deals with the Devil he's not going
[58:26] to honor his side of the bargain
[58:28] anyway he's just looking for a foo hole
[58:30] list when he comes in and says I just
[58:32] want your
[58:33] joy I just want your peace you can still
[58:37] be an overcomer I just want to take a
[58:38] little bit of your peace and give you a
[58:40] little bit of this anxiety don't you
[58:42] back off he's not that's not what he
[58:43] wants he wants your soul and he's just

[58:57] minute he steps on your property blast
[58:59] him he don't have no rights on your

[59:38] their
[59:39] Birthright he's looking for those like
[59:41] the 10 spies that came out under a
[59:44] prophet saw the supernatural went
[59:47] through the Red Sea followed a pillar of
[59:49] fire but then said we can't take the
[59:53] land it's too hard
[59:56] I don't think we can do
[59:58] it we look like grasshoppers in their
[1:00:03] sight think about it how'd they
[1:00:06] know do you think they walked up to them
[1:00:10] excuse
[1:00:11] me what do I look like to
[1:00:14] you where'd they get that from they
[1:00:16] didn't go talk to the
[1:00:18] Giants it was their own
[1:00:20] imagination it was listening to what the
[1:00:22] devil told them that's why the Bible
[1:00:24] tells us cast down imagination and any
[1:00:28] High thing that exalts itself against
[1:00:30] the word of God so tonight that Devil's
[1:00:32] saying you ain't going to make it cast
[1:00:33] it down you can't be healed cast it down
[1:00:35] your children ain't coming back cast it
[1:00:37] down see because all of that goes
[1:00:39] against the word of God that says I've
[1:00:41] already made it by his stripes I'm
[1:00:43] Healed I'll be there and my Offspring
[1:00:45] with me that's what the word says I'm
[1:00:48] not asking the devil if it looks
[1:00:50] possible I'm not asking the devil you
[1:00:51] think I'm going to make it no sir the
[1:00:53] word said I'm going to make it so I'm
[1:00:56] going to stand with the word tonight
[1:00:58] committed to the
[1:01:00] word
[1:01:03] hallelujah he's looking for people
[1:01:04] that'll sell out you know brother Aon
[1:01:07] maybe we should back off our
[1:01:09] expectations a little bit maybe we don't
[1:01:12] really get the new birth like they used
[1:01:14] to maybe God don't move in the
[1:01:16] Supernatural
[1:01:19] anymore don't back off your
[1:01:22] Birthright brother Brown says and how
[1:01:24] many tonight how many people people has
[1:01:26] sold out their Birthright to the things
[1:01:28] of the world and got away from God stay
[1:01:32] with the word he says those spies that
[1:01:35] went over to spy out the land came and
[1:01:37] even eat the grapes that Joshua and
[1:01:39] Caleb brought back and yet what did they
[1:01:41] do they sold their
[1:01:44] Birthright you know in the message and
[1:01:47] and I understand why brother brandham
[1:01:48] dealt with him specifically a lot talks
[1:01:51] about Elvis sold out for money and
[1:01:52] riches and Cadillacs and we like to
[1:01:54] point to him and use him for an example
[1:01:56] and Bash on Elvis
[1:01:59] whatever my deal is many of us sell out
[1:02:01] for way
[1:02:03] less there's a lot of people sell out
[1:02:06] their Wednesdays for a $2 an hour raise
[1:02:09] you were like Elvis sold out for
[1:02:11] Cadillacs and a million records and I
[1:02:12] sold out so I can make 1750 an
[1:02:16] hour there ain't nothing worth selling
[1:02:19] out for God your provider God your
[1:02:22] provider put God first and trust in him
[1:02:25] him and watch him provide for you Way
[1:02:28] Beyond any 1750 or whatever that man's
[1:02:31] offering you to miss church sell out to
[1:02:34] God don't be a sellout for
[1:02:37] money I believe God's got a people on
[1:02:39] Earth today that's purposed in their
[1:02:41] heart I'm not settling for less I'm not
[1:02:43] settling for less than the new birth
[1:02:45] they got in the upper room I'm not
[1:02:47] settling for less than Divine Healing
[1:02:49] that that's been restored in this day
[1:02:50] I'm not settling for less than my
[1:02:52] children coming back to God I'm not
[1:02:54] settling for less than Resto restored
[1:02:56] families and restored marriages and a
[1:02:58] church on fire for God I'm not settling
[1:03:00] for the tribulation I'm not settling for
[1:03:02] white Throne judgment I'm not selling
[1:03:04] for anything but a body change and a
[1:03:06] Rapture of the church that's what I'm
[1:03:08] going to have cuz that's what the word
[1:03:10] promised
[1:03:11] me
[1:03:14] Hallelujah yes
[1:03:17] Lord he's the same yesterday today and
[1:03:19] forever that's the very theme of the
[1:03:22] message of the
[1:03:24] hour how can the Supernatural message
[1:03:26] that ever struck the face of the Earth
[1:03:28] how can we claim to believe it and then
[1:03:29] deny it at the same time that's right
[1:03:32] he's the same he did it once he'll do it
[1:03:35] again brother brandham said if he did it
[1:03:37] one way one time he's obligated to do it
[1:03:39] the same way this time
[1:03:42] Hallelujah I'm not going to settle for
[1:03:45] anything less than
[1:03:46] everything I'm going to have everything
[1:03:49] he promised me
[1:03:53] amen it's hard to go back to talking
[1:03:55] about the world when you start talking
[1:03:56] about the good things of God but but the
[1:04:00] currents of the world blow and the
[1:04:02] currents of unbelief blow and Satan
[1:04:05] tries to wear you down over time how
[1:04:06] many has experienced that absolutely we
[1:04:09] all do he tries to wear you down and
[1:04:12] when he gets you worn down to a place
[1:04:14] that he thinks he's got you weak that's
[1:04:15] when he begins to offer
[1:04:18] compromises and
[1:04:21] then we're not a people who can get by
[1:04:24] on compromises
[1:04:26] we're not a people that can settle for
[1:04:27] compromises because the truth and the
[1:04:29] light that's been granted to us God
[1:04:31] expects us to stand he expects us to
[1:04:36] stand he expects us to overcome he
[1:04:39] expects us to be committed to what we've
[1:04:41] been
[1:04:42] given listen in this world today and you
[1:04:45] all know them I heard the wonderful
[1:04:46] testimony my brother Brad gave about the
[1:04:48] the Baptist Church that that donated so
[1:04:51] much and is doing so much for for people
[1:04:53] there are a lot of good people
[1:04:56] there are a lot of people live
[1:04:57] Christianity to the best of their
[1:04:58] ability with what they have and what
[1:05:00] they know I don't never want to take
[1:05:03] anything away from those I I say all the
[1:05:04] time I wish there was a lot more Baptist
[1:05:07] in this
[1:05:08] world it'd be a better place I don't
[1:05:11] know how it is up here but back home
[1:05:13] there's a lot of people I was like man I
[1:05:14] wish they was a Baptist I i''d be a
[1:05:16] better person so I'm not here to take
[1:05:19] away from what they have I'm thankful
[1:05:22] for the stand that they stand but how
[1:05:25] much more should you be willing to stand
[1:05:27] with what you've been given and what's
[1:05:29] been revealed to you in this day amen
[1:05:32] but they stand with what light they have
[1:05:35] and the Bible tells us that they're
[1:05:36] going to be granted life for the
[1:05:38] testimony that they
[1:05:40] held they're going to be granted life
[1:05:42] but but you've been given great
[1:05:47] light the message of Malachi 4 as you
[1:05:49] know restored the truth you know the
[1:05:52] truth of the church ages you know the
[1:05:54] truth of baptism the truth truth of
[1:05:55] serpy the truth of godhead we could go
[1:05:57] on and on on all these things have been
[1:05:59] restored to you you're the recipients of
[1:06:02] all that he committed that into your
[1:06:06] hands what a commitment that he has
[1:06:09] given us but because of that what a
[1:06:13] commitment he requires from
[1:06:17] us think about it we're not going to get
[1:06:19] by on well we did the best we could with
[1:06:21] what we had brother
[1:06:23] Tommy we don't have an excuse of not
[1:06:25] knowing we can't plead ignorance we
[1:06:29] can't plead ignorance maybe as those who
[1:06:30] didn't know or even other ages who who
[1:06:33] who only had partial light and lived in
[1:06:35] the fullness of what they had listen to
[1:06:38] what it says in Luke 12:48 I want you to
[1:06:40] get this but he that knew not so Jesus
[1:06:44] here is talking about ignorance he knew
[1:06:47] not and did commit things worthy of
[1:06:50] Stripes shall be beaten with few stripes
[1:06:53] in other words they're still going to be
[1:06:55] punch punishment but it's been
[1:06:57] reduced because he didn't know it was
[1:07:00] worthy of Stripes but he did it in
[1:07:02] ignorance so he's only going to be given
[1:07:04] a few stripes for unto whom so much
[1:07:07] whosoever much is given of him shall be
[1:07:11] much required and to whom men have
[1:07:14] committed much of him they will ask the
[1:07:18] more notice it's still punishment but
[1:07:21] it's lightened you find this actually
[1:07:23] it's based in numbers 15:29 listen as I
[1:07:26] read this you shall have one law for him
[1:07:29] that sinth through
[1:07:31] ignorance both for him that is born
[1:07:34] among the children of Israel and for the
[1:07:36] stranger that sojourneth among them
[1:07:38] notice ignorance excuses them there's
[1:07:41] actually a totally different law for a
[1:07:44] man who sinth in
[1:07:47] ignorance okay there's still punishment
[1:07:50] like I said it's just not as severe so
[1:07:52] so there's going to be punishment but
[1:07:53] lighter there's somewh of an excuse
[1:07:56] there they didn't know better think
[1:08:00] about it even the Jews in their
[1:08:01] crucifixion of Jesus you find that in
[1:08:03] their defense over and over ignorance is
[1:08:06] mentioned acts 3:17 and now Brethren I
[1:08:10] what that through ignorance you did it
[1:08:13] as did also your
[1:08:15] rulers 1 Corinthians uh 1 Colossians 2:8
[1:08:18] which none of the princes of this world
[1:08:21] knew for had they known it they would
[1:08:24] not have crucified the Lord Of Glory
[1:08:27] ignorance think about what Jesus even
[1:08:30] say as their defense father forgive
[1:08:34] them they know
[1:08:37] not it was ignorance and he's sighting
[1:08:41] ignorance but look at those now I'm
[1:08:44] turning it to
[1:08:45] you who know and choose not to do what's
[1:08:49] right I read you numbers 1529 saying
[1:08:51] there was a law for the ignorant but now
[1:08:54] 15 and 30 says but the soul that doeth
[1:08:57] ought
[1:08:59] presumptuously you knew better whether
[1:09:02] he be born in the land or a stranger the
[1:09:06] same reproacheth the Lord and that Soul
[1:09:09] shall be cut off from among his
[1:09:12] people Church we're not going to get by
[1:09:15] saying we didn't know
[1:09:16] better we're not going to get by with
[1:09:18] compromising and being halfway in others
[1:09:21] may receive a lighter punishment and and
[1:09:23] then go through the tribulation and be
[1:09:25] granted life at the great white Throne
[1:09:27] judgment and giv eternal life I'm just
[1:09:30] saying I'd hate to stand there that day
[1:09:32] knowing what we know that's right once
[1:09:35] again I don't I I don't know everything
[1:09:37] there's things I don't understand
[1:09:38] brother Tom but I've just always said
[1:09:40] it's going to be awful hard to be a
[1:09:42] foolish virgin sitting in a message
[1:09:48] church I'm telling you you better make
[1:09:50] the Rapture and I'm not saying that to
[1:09:52] scare you I'm also telling you he gave
[1:09:54] you everything you need to make the
[1:09:56] Rapture he's not rooting against you
[1:09:58] he's rooting for you he's saying here
[1:10:00] take it there's a Rapture for you
[1:10:02] there's a there's a token for you get on
[1:10:05] board there's a way of Escape he's not
[1:10:07] saying no if you missed the rap he's
[1:10:08] saying no come on come on come on the
[1:10:12] the spirit and the bride say come and
[1:10:15] drink of the Water of Life
[1:10:17] freely listen he's expecting you to make
[1:10:20] it he said I go to prepare a place for
[1:10:23] you he didn't just just go do that for
[1:10:26] himself he's waiting on you to show up
[1:10:28] he knows you're coming he's already seen
[1:10:30] you there from before the foundation of
[1:10:33] the world he's expecting you to make it
[1:10:37] and he sent a message to make sure you
[1:10:39] make
[1:10:40] it
[1:10:42] Hallelujah
[1:10:45] Lord For unto who soever much is given
[1:10:50] of him shall much be required we got to
[1:10:53] be committed to truth
[1:10:55] because truth has been committed to
[1:10:58] us standing for truth defending truth
[1:11:01] Walking In Truth living in
[1:11:03] truth you got to be committed you said
[1:11:06] that a lot tonight yeah I'm going to
[1:11:07] keep saying that's what we're preaching
[1:11:08] to you we got to be sold out we got to
[1:11:11] be
[1:11:12] committed committed to it against all
[1:11:15] adversaries committed to it against
[1:11:17] Liars committed to it against all the
[1:11:20] currents of society that would try to
[1:11:22] erode it not waver in it not back up on
[1:11:25] it not water it down but say what the
[1:11:28] prophet
[1:11:29] said he delivered it the way it was
[1:11:32] meant to be delivered well I think what
[1:11:34] brother brandham meant was I think
[1:11:36] brother brandham said what he
[1:11:40] meant take all of it look there's Parts
[1:11:44] where're all wired different there's
[1:11:45] parts of that might be hard for me to
[1:11:47] take other parts might be hard for you
[1:11:49] to take you know before they left
[1:11:52] Egypt they had to eat all the lamb all
[1:11:55] right eat
[1:11:57] it eat it and it might make your belly
[1:12:00] bitter that's what the that's what it
[1:12:02] says that just means it's going to stir
[1:12:04] some things up there's parts that ain't
[1:12:07] just going to sit exactly well with you
[1:12:09] eat it anyway let it change you anyway
[1:12:12] let it prepare you to leave here anyway
[1:12:15] Even If It Don't Fit with what you think
[1:12:16] that's okay let this mind be in you lay
[1:12:19] it down lay down and eat on it don't
[1:12:21] waver on it take all of it stand for all
[1:12:23] of it be committed to all of of it
[1:12:25] because all of it is what we have to
[1:12:29] have all of it is what we have to have
[1:12:32] listen I'm not saying this like I said I
[1:12:33] want to make sure you understand not in
[1:12:35] a negative way or to to to scare you oh
[1:12:37] no no no no this is a glorious thing
[1:12:40] this is a wonderful thing he gave you
[1:12:44] exactly what he knew you needed to
[1:12:47] overcome and so therefore he expects you
[1:12:50] to overcome he expects you to win the
[1:12:52] battle he expects you to Rapture because
[1:12:55] he knows that he's giving you exactly
[1:12:57] what you needed to make it listen think
[1:13:00] about this countries are constantly
[1:13:02] advancing so militaries are constantly
[1:13:05] advancing if if you're still fighting

[1:13:10] behind they say during World War II it
[1:13:13] Advanced so so quickly that if you was
[1:13:15] at fighting at the end of the war with
[1:13:16] the same stuff you had literally months
[1:13:18] before you were
[1:13:20] behind so so so armies Advan and
[1:13:23] Technologies Advance athletes are
[1:13:25] advancing because of all these new

[1:13:48] matter if it was Ephesus or Le AA this
[1:13:50] will do it it's the atomic bomb it's

[1:20:20] covered don't toy with things
[1:20:24] well I was delivered I I'll just say it
[1:20:26] and you know some people cringe or
[1:20:28] whatever I okay well brother I was
[1:20:30] delivered from pornography but it's okay
[1:20:32] if I just this really ain't
[1:20:35] pornography no don't don't dabble at
[1:20:38] all don't look at all don't think at all
[1:20:43] keep your eyes
[1:20:44] up you can't justify that because that's
[1:20:47] a place you got to keep I'm not doubting
[1:20:49] your
[1:20:50] deliverance I'm saying keep it covered
[1:20:52] he knows it got you once he's going to
[1:20:55] present it to you
[1:20:56] again it may be totally it may be
[1:20:59] something like Pride maybe you're
[1:21:00] somebody else full of Pride God
[1:21:01] delivered you from that keep it
[1:21:04] covered no matter what it is you know
[1:21:07] what I have to keep covered brother
[1:21:10] Tom smart
[1:21:15] mouth is that true
[1:21:19] Jude
[1:21:22] I before I was a Christian
[1:21:25] he's he's saying wait tell the whole
[1:21:27] truth before I was a Christian I was a
[1:21:29] very very very bad smart mouth and to me
[1:21:31] I wasn't trying to be ugly I thought it
[1:21:33] was funny right I'm thinking everybody's
[1:21:34] gonna laugh hahaa except the person that
[1:21:36] you were being smart to they don't think
[1:21:39] hahaa but even as a Christian I tell
[1:21:43] people all the time at church I said
[1:21:44] listen I should get trophies for the
[1:21:47] things I don't say because man sometimes
[1:21:50] they pop in your head and you're like oh
[1:21:52] Jesus I love you
[1:21:56] I have to battle it because you know
[1:21:57] what I I don't want that I don't want to
[1:21:59] hurt a brother even if I don't mean to I
[1:22:01] don't want to offend somebody even if I
[1:22:03] don't mean
[1:22:04] to you you know um younger people talk
[1:22:08] to each other that way and it's all fun
[1:22:09] and gam I have to be aware that there's
[1:22:11] an older generation that it ain't fun in
[1:22:14] games I have to keep it cover I'm in a
[1:22:16] leadership position and I have to
[1:22:18] recognize that's not
[1:22:20] okay well that's not that big a deal
[1:22:22] brother it is to me I really really have
[1:22:24] to fight to keep those things cover now
[1:22:27] my son probably thinks I wish you'd
[1:22:29] fight to keep it covered when we're
[1:22:30] together because I can be pretty harsh
[1:22:32] on him but he thinks it's funny like I
[1:22:34] do so it's okay but I'm just saying I
[1:22:36] just wanted to to be open with you and
[1:22:38] say we all have things that it's not
[1:22:39] always some big obvious thing I've got a
[1:22:41] drink and no no no look when you first
[1:22:43] came to the Lord all those big things
[1:22:46] fell away it's like when when when they
[1:22:49] first start carving a
[1:22:52] statue they take and they chip big
[1:22:54] chunks off of it huge chunks and man
[1:22:57] lust Falls away and maybe cigarettes and
[1:23:00] and maybe alcohol whatever your lifesty
[1:23:02] all falls away but it still don't look
[1:23:05] like a person it's just a smaller
[1:23:09] rock but then what happens when they get
[1:23:12] down to the end they bring out
[1:23:17] sandpaper and those little things like

[1:30:55] we're going to bring this
[1:30:58] down I love the story where brother
[1:31:01] Brown tells about driving in the car and
[1:31:04] and he's listening to the radio and and
[1:31:06] I think he was taking his daughter to
[1:31:07] school if I remember right and he's
[1:31:10] listening to radio and they got this
[1:31:11] scientist on there explaining how the
[1:31:13] world came to be with all the chemicals
[1:31:16] and all this and the explosions and such
[1:31:19] and he says he turned it off because he
[1:31:21] was like I'm not listening to this you
[1:31:23] know so he turns it off
[1:31:25] and he said Satan started saying to him
[1:31:27] you know Jesus was just a man like any
[1:31:30] other maybe like a Billy Graham and a
[1:31:33] few people gathered around him and
[1:31:35] believed him but now he's dead and gone
[1:31:37] and that's all of
[1:31:39] it I love what brother Brown says he
[1:31:42] says I thought how a liar you are maybe
[1:31:47] some of us need to use that Kentucky
[1:31:49] English tonight y'all how a liar you
[1:31:52] are he said says and then I turned just
[1:31:55] as I was crossing Graham Street I said
[1:31:57] Satan you that's talking to my
[1:31:59] conscience I'd like to ask you a few
[1:32:02] things now put yourself in this
[1:32:04] conversation it's time to ask the devil
[1:32:05] a few things he says who was it that the
[1:32:08] Hebrew prophets spoke of that would come
[1:32:10] who was the anointed Messiah what was
[1:32:12] upon those men who foresaw him and told
[1:32:14] his life thousands of years before he
[1:32:16] got there who was it that foretold it
[1:32:18] just to the letter and when he' come
[1:32:20] they said he was numbered with the
[1:32:21] transgressors and he was and he was
[1:32:23] wounded for our transgressions and he
[1:32:25] was and he made his grave with the rich
[1:32:27] but he would rise up the third day and
[1:32:29] he did and then he promised the Holy
[1:32:31] Ghost and I've got it so you just might
[1:32:33] as well get away from it because it's
[1:32:35] written in the word and every word is
[1:32:37] true then he left he says just give him
[1:32:40] the word he can't stand the word I say
[1:32:44] just pour it on him tonight just pour
[1:32:47] the word on him just pour it on him drop
[1:32:49] it on him tonight who is it that's going
[1:32:51] to take a Rapture devil who is is it
[1:32:54] it's me who is it overcoming in your
[1:32:56] edting devil it's me who was it said I
[1:32:59] send Malachi 4 and he did it who was it
[1:33:02] said I will restore and he did it who
[1:33:04] was it said I can have my children and
[1:33:06] I'm going to have them who was it it was
[1:33:09] him who' he call me he called me pour it
[1:33:14] on him tonight commit to it
[1:33:17] tonight
[1:33:19] Hallelujah who is it that's been healed

[1:34:04] all your cares on
[1:34:06] him then he takes
[1:34:08] responsibility for
[1:34:11] you Hallelujah think about it brother
[1:34:14] Brown says he alone has the use of that
[1:34:17] key for he alone opens and
[1:34:20] shuts no man has the right but Jesus
[1:34:22] himself isn't that right but where is
[1:34:25] the key it's on his shoulder but what
[1:34:28] does the shoulder have to do with it he
[1:34:30] said read Isaiah 96 and the government
[1:34:33] shall be upon his shoulder but what does
[1:34:35] this mean he says the answer is this the
[1:34:38] phrase government upon his shoulder
[1:34:40] comes from the wedding ceremony of the
[1:34:42] East when the bride has been committed
[1:34:44] to the groom she takes off her veil and
[1:34:47] places it over on the groom's shoulder
[1:34:50] signifying that not only is she under
[1:34:53] his Dominion she has transferred her
[1:34:56] rights to him and that he is the head
[1:34:58] but also that he Bears the
[1:35:02] responsibility and the care and that he
[1:35:04] and he alone no one else no other man no
[1:35:08] other power has any right and
[1:35:11] responsibility she is wholly committed
[1:35:13] to him and he accepts the
[1:35:17] obligation oh Hallelujah but brother
[1:35:20] Aaron tonight I got so many heartaches
[1:35:22] he accepts the obligation
[1:35:24] I've got so many failures you don't
[1:35:26] understand he accepts the obligation
[1:35:28] I've I've got I've got marriage trouble
[1:35:29] I've got I got a sick child I got kids
[1:35:31] lost in the world he accepts the
[1:35:34] obligation he accepts the obligation so
[1:35:37] now I ask you is there anything too hard
[1:35:39] for the Lord I say even now Lord even
[1:35:42] now whatever my situation is even now

[1:36:11] him because I've committed it all to him

[1:36:20] obligation he says I'll settle the debts
[1:36:24] throw your cares on him tonight brother
[1:36:27] Brown says' oh if we could only learn to
[1:36:29] be a trusted servant of God like that
[1:36:32] that we could commit things to God it's
