because we it's good to be in the house of the lord um i think that's all for the music uh actually my brother has a testimony um if you want to get up here and hi hi everyone i'm just gonna give a short testimony just find my notes okay um i just i just felt this is what god laid on my heart to just tell you but it was a it's a it's just what happened to me at byc when i was at youth camp i was i just uh there was every every day at youtube they'd have a uh we would go up to altar they'd have an altar call and i just i just felt well i i wouldn't go up to the altar ever i didn't well the last well i was saying i'm sorry this is my first time on the pulpit so yeah just be well just well i just got partial notes this time so um what i was trying to say is that a few weeks back i believe i got the baptism of the holy ghost and i just well before i went up there that it was the day before the last day so i had that last chance and um well that last day i thought it was a last chance for the last day but then then i did i thought uh brother kidri diggs he preached that day and i was thinking uh should i go up there should i go and uh judges get on the altar that time i i felt i felt like i had something missing my life from before i went up to the altar and i i i had to get i had to i just had to go up there and ask jesus to just give me the holy ghost i believed i didn't i did i really have the holy ghost i was thinking and i just went up there and i prayed and i uh asked jesus for the holy ghost and and i i didn't feel like i had it until until it was when i i just i was just praising the lord and thanking him for at for everything done for me and just giving my life to into just placing my life in his hands and then i just felt this overwhelming joy and i was i was i was just crying and and uh praising the lord and singing and i i just can't i just can't believe this experience and it was it was a solid experience it was just it was overwhelming i i ran the aisle just just for that experience i i can't believe it and i just couldn't let go for a long time and before that i it was they they had already let out everyone before that i i had to i could have just left if i i was thinking i was fighting within myself i was fighting with the devil that he was trying to tell me uh oh you could go tomorrow you could you could you could wait till tomorrow and he he nearly he nearly won but i i just stayed there i just waited and then then i just went up there and it was just a leap of faith for me and i [Music] but even after that the devil is still on you and he what he did he at every gun in hell will be on you when you get when you get on jesus side when you when you truly get on his side and i feel that the devil attacked me after that what he did is it was just a misunderstanding and just i took it so hard and i was i was in i was just in the dorm and i i started crying i i i had a a um a friend he he prayed with me and i i felt i felt i felt that i i had to go talk to that to a man that that had them this misunderstanding it was about me this misunderstanding i couldn't it was it was so so uh it was so difficult to to face this but i what i did was i went i figured i thought about it in my head what what happened where what what was it what was that misunderstanding and i finally figured it out i i i don't want to name any names or anything i just want to just say that i i figured it finally figured out what what was that misunderstanding i went back and talked to the man and i uh i got clarified with him i i figured it out completely it was just it was it was nothing really and uh the devil just just messes with your mind he he he will change things the smallest things misunderstandings anything he will he will twist him he will twist reality he he but he is a a well i just want to say that i at the in that i won the victory over satan amen i uh i won the victory and that byc was amazing and uh and what what was it yeah one of the preachers one of the people speaking up there he said this this was a time where he this was a time he never saw so much uh warfare against satan in this this time he never saw so much and i i felt it that warfare i knew what he was talking about yeah even before he did he said and the first time i didn't understand what he meant i didn't i didn't quite and i didn't quite grasp it but now i i i understand it and yeah it was an amazing experience there byc and yeah i'm really glad that i made i got to go to byc yeah and that's it for the testimony thank you [Applause] hey man how am i enjoyed that all right sorry to keep you standing so long i forgot to make everyone let everyone sit down but uh let's pray lord god i pray that that you'll have control of this service tonight lord i pray lord even though there's not many people here lord that they would pull on on the gift lord i pray that that you would speak like through me lord that that your your word your voice would come through through my lungs or not the people didn't come here to to hear me speak lord they came here to hear you speak lord i i give you control i give you you every a bit of me lord that you would just come and anoint this service sword i pray that you'd speak to each and every one of our hearts or i i pray that a lord or just just come and just be with this service lord i i

to um let's see john 10 27. there's many out sick to today and i can come in to church i believe that there a lot of them or most of them are watching through the service to streaming the service through facebook and see my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me i get give unto them eternal life and they they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand amen and may god add his blessing to reading the word you can be seated it's a very familiar scripture right here my sheep here hear my voice it it's it's that that same voice that that that um was spoken of in in in god's word that that voice and it's always saying with the word it's always it's exactly what the word any any voice that you hear that's contrary to this word it's not from god and and here what what brother branham and was saying in uh in the voice of the the sign and every true sign every true sign that's sent from god has a voice behind it now don't oh don't fail this is my last session on this see every true sign now we have signs that's not from god satan can almost impersonate everything that there is but a true sign sent from god has the voice of god behind it god said to moses if they won't believe the voice of the first sign then and do this other sign before them and then if they don't hear that just just take water and pour it upon the ground and that that was a sign that they would be drenched there in in their own blood notice and just the same as he said dust the dust from your feet it'd be a more tolerable for sodom and gomorrah that day than it will be that at the city that rejects you and and and over here it says uh in somewhere else what brother branham says now this had been promised by god and he that that was he was going to deliver his people with a strong arm now uh when this word he didn't call a priest he didn't call a rabbi he didn't call any executive he called a shepherd out on the on the mountain a runaway born for ordained prophet that didn't want his job when you hear people desiring to be this that or the others or something just watch god never uses them god had to hunt moses down and get and get him he had to hunt paul to get him he it's it's man that's that that don't want to do it they don't want things that then and god takes that man he won't won't do who so so he can show his glory by it i mean that's exactly right while i was saying on on sunday to uh to brother micah i said that god doesn't god doesn't um call the he doesn't and call the qualified he qualifies the call see if i i didn't think i was going to be a preacher i thought i didn't have it in me i had stage fright i was so bad at at speaking and even speaking to people just just one-on-one conversation because i i was and i still still am an introvert but really an introvert like i couldn't hardly talk to anyone and i would just get really nervous just talking to one person but but that that's that's the way god does it he he qualifies the call and and what i want to speak on tonight is is um hearing the voice of god and because there's so many voices is that you hear all the time there's voices that you hear on the media there's voices that you hear hear other people tell you and and different and things and what one of the main things that that really got to me when i when i was talking to let me just find it right here i i was talking to to um where is it let's see so i'm on my note somewhere yeah here it is you are you are not your thoughts you are the one listening to them that that's that's really deep because because most of us or all of us have always dealt with uh by battling in the mind because satan always wants control of the mind if he he can't get control of your heart he's still got to get your mind because when he he he keeps putting in thoughts and keeps putting the thoughts he'll cause you to to backside and to slip up and and and and what we do sometimes with those with those thoughts we think that it's our thoughts satan always says it in such a way that it sounds like it's your thoughts oh and then it's always me i don't know if it's just me or anyone else but uh you know when you pray you're like oh god forgive me for those thoughts i shouldn't have thought those things that's the devil and it and and one thing that i i got here is the mind is not capable of thinking any evil thoughts except that which has been inspired by the devil it's it's exactly right we think well i thought this stopped because um that's that the other error because my heart's wrong and that's it's because the devil don't take ownership for for thoughts and it's simply voices in your head that satan and plants in in your mind to make you think that that it was it was your thoughts and i i spoke to [Music] i i spoke to someone a few months back someone told me that she kept having evil and inappropriate thoughts you use this was her really opening up to me she never really opened up to anyone else um but but she was like really opening up about things because she trusted in me i guess and and also we were having like deep conversations and stuff because i like having deep conversations rather than just going on on whatever the topic is about the weather whatever i i like having deep thoughts and deep conversations um and i asked her if she if she um yeah she said i it would be things that that she would never wish on anyone i asked her if she feeds on anything that would contribute to those thoughts and and such as tv being around the wrong crowd and she said in the end and no no she doesn't excuse me or everything around the wrong crotch she said no so so i said that that is the devil that that does that and for her to resist those voices nothing but the devil it is not like i said it's not possible for the mind to think an evil thought without being inspired by the devil well so stop taking ownership for what the devil puts in your mind satan is crafty and yeah like i said satan's that that crafty makes you think that it's it's your own thoughts it's not see see because if it was back like it wasn't in the garden of eden originally adam and eve never ever thought any bad thoughts until satan came along and he put put those those thoughts in eve's mind and and she she's i believe she's still struggling with with those those those things i'm not not going to name names who it is because because it's a very deep thing it's revealing a lot and i believe that each and every one of us deals with those things and it's it is difficult at times i i thought it was just me and and it's the same with her she thought was just her and no one else deals with those things those thoughts because she said that she would randomly it'd just be like you know even even like cuss words would come into like f for that person she said that would randomly just pop up in her mind and she just never thinks things anything like like that that um it doesn't come from from yourself that that is satan and he he takes whatever you've looked at whatever you overheard whatever you've done and then mix it up with just turn it evil and then and then put it in your mind and then and you're like oh you know that that's but but when we get to the place where we're just when we're just entertaining that thought that that's where where satan and gets us and then that's where sin can be conceived is when you start entertaining those thoughts did in the beginning eve if eve would have just heard what satan said and and just moved on and just was like no god said this let me let me just stick with what god says and that that's the way you should take it every single thought that comes in your mind that says uh and anything bad anything evil you say no that's not what my bible says and and you just stick with that and stick with the word you haven't done nothing wrong it is simply the the devil resists the devil and he will flee i me myself i don't deal with those thoughts as much because every time they come in i'm just like nope that's from the devil i'll just move on and and this is what what the word says just go go with the the bible every single time the the the devil wants the wait let's see um everyone well let me see i don't know and the those are those things are simply in the uh voices that the devil puts in your mind and you think well it it this he also says things that seem like well that that that might be right that might be god speaking to me satan does that because he can he he can get so close to the real thing that that that he that's just that much off just that much off one word that's all has to be off of the bible and and he causes you to slide and causes you to to just go off by one word and that that's where he gets you signs are this is uh another message by brother branham science from god the sign that follows or the voice that follows the sign must be the voice of god speaking from the word for that age do you understand it god gives signs but what does he do it for always give signs he told them that that's what what they'd look for in him in the signs god gives signs to attract the attention of his people not now let's study this thoroughly see signs are given to attract the attention of the people because when when when a godsend sign is given god is ready to speak god is ready to speak what when the sign is given it comes from heaven is from god god is ready to speak he is trying to attract the people's attention see see what what this is saying is that that when the god gives signs it's this is uh different from what i was going on the first but but there there's we can set aside two two voices there's the voice of satan it's either the voice of satan or your own mind or god speaking to you god can speak to you through your mind i know this by experiencing also by others experiences see but it's always backed by the word it's always it's always there's always a voice behind it and and that voice is the behind and if god gives you a sign there's always a voice behind it and that that voice is scriptural see it goes on to say now moses being a scientist which he he was taught in all the wisdom of egyptians and they were greater scientists than than we have today so and being a scientist looked he looked like he he had said now i'll go see what kind of uh chemical is sprayed on those leaves and a tree that doesn't burn see if he had an approach in it if he if he'd have approached it in a scientific way it would have never talked to him you see a lot of this today a bunch of people get their big giant book of theology out like a big book this big and then they're like all right let's hear it it's time to hear the air the voice of god and they they open up their big bucket theology do's and don'ts uh now now let's hope hope that that god speaks to this let's intellectually figure out god and then that that's not the way god works and god doesn't speak through through people's dogmas and in theology and all that stuff he speaks through his word and over and um billy graham speed speaks it and said it like this he's he said that let's see where it is here okay here it is now here's how to read the bible read it reverently it's an interview with almighty god read it with expectancy come to the bible expecting god to speak to you and read it till he does speak to you now maybe you'll only read one verse meditate on that verse maybe you'll you'll read a whole chapter meditate on that chapter come with expectancy that every time you open the scriptures god has a message for you and then read it with dependence the the holy spirit inspires the writing of this book and the holy spirit can interpret the book to you and i have well uh what he he got here is it he he this is his teaching on on what the baptists believe and stuff because he's baptist holy spirit he this holy spirit can interpret it to you god reveals this word through the prophets and it's by revelation but in this the holy spirit inspires the writing of the book and the holy spirit can interpret this to you in a way a god i can reveal you things reveal this book to you not interpret and i have come to many points in the bible that i did not understand and i would would get on my knees and i say show it to me and i found the meaning of the passage on my knees by the holy spirit and and and that that is how it is if you go if you go to the bible and you say god speak to me and you open up your the bible whatever you read and you you come in with expectancy to to hear god speak to you excuse me you you won't you won't have if you're sincere and you're ever happy i i heard this and this was um this was something i don't know it's like crazy this is a video i i watched of a preacher um he said that well not all of this is i wrote a lot of this i changed some of it in my own wording that false voices we listen to sometimes in other words prophets and i believe that so so i want to call them out by name the first one is a false prophet named anxiety anxiety is false prophet it is falsely prophesying to you that your future is nothing to be uh there's something is something to be afraid of that that your future lacks peace i'm calling you out tonight anxiety is a false prophet it is falsely prophesying to you yeah yeah it can can i tell you tonight depression is a false prophet yes the spirit of depression is falsely prophesying to you and your life will will never actually find traction and it will never be good again and there's no joy in your future that that your life isn't worth living that that the world would be better off without you lies falsely prophesying going directly against the written word of the lord your the lord of your life yes calling him out tonight yes addiction is a false prophet prophesying that you'll never find freedom prophesying that you'll be free for a little while but but but the six cycle will come back false yeah i i break that lie off of you tonight in the name of jesus amen the false prophets you really gotta look out out for are not in your headphones they're in your head false prophesying to you all day long the the word of the lord is no longer true see see that that's exactly right right there there's so many many people struggle with it the thoughts that going in their mind in the different voices and the different things in the in this world prophesying lies in in our our lives telling us i've listened to them before oh you're not good enough everybody hates you everybody different things lies it's always like that these things that going on on in our mind satan putting things in our mind and different and things like that it's always our self always trying to it's satan trying to push us down and say you're not good enough you you'll never you'll never make it you'll different things like that telling me that that every uh even me it's it's like i i it's always satan telling me that you did you did horrible on that sermon and that's last night it's like um yeah i guess you're right and and i'm i'm guilty of that and and it's like i have to to get myself together and say even if it esteemed it wasn't very good god god may have made it that way exactly to where i think us it's not it's you know that god didn't come down and anointed as i was writing down what i was to preach that something i read from my notes was meant for someone and help someone and and and to me i don't care if i go up here and i say different things and i'm all and i'm going in all i i want to do is that go and for for god to touch someone's heart through my ministry if i can and help one person that then i i've i it's better than me just sitting back and saying it's too hard and do it in life if you'll always fail you'll always you always fail here and there and you all you isn't it'll never be perfect we we are humans we we make mistakes and and we we don't always perform as good as we want to but if if god can do something through it through through this then then it's been worth it regardless of what it is i i'd rather get up here i'd rather i'd rather i'd rather do what i feel god is leading me to do than sit back and say i'm too scared because i might mess up and i get like that and and just like michael john got up here to to to speak to give his testimony i knew he'd probably get really nervous and mess and maybe mess up and not in fumble's words and all that but but he still got up here to give his testimony i kind of forced him to but but he still got up here and he had that choice whether he wanted to get up here or not and and he did and and and if if it and i i'd like it if it's done anything god can use it in a powerful way because because not only is is um even if it didn't help anyone in this building this service is online so different people watch it online and it could help someone streaming it you know and it's it is it is hard something time one thing i always say like is sometimes we don't have enough discipline and that we're disciplined that word discipline is was derived from the same word as disciples driven you can't be a christian without any discipline let's just get get that straight and you you can't really be a christian without any discipline because it takes discipline to end to get up sure it's it's god that's called you into this but god gives you discipline and it will helps you along he leads you and guides you but but still us as as human beings we need to have discipline to be able to to gap and say i don't feel like reading the bible read it anyway that's when discipline and kingston when there's no longer motivation to do anything that you're supposed to do which we we can't always go by motivation people motivation is overrated not everyone and has motivation all the time you ain't making i don't feel like doing the sound going to church on wednesday i don't feel like when you feel this is what's right and and you feel on the inside this is what's right i have to do it it's like that that's when discipline kicks into discipline as in and um disciple disciples have discipline because discipline is a part of discipleship picking up your cross and and and just keep going on nice and they keep going and carrying that cross that that's when discipline kicks in when you do exactly every every day everyone would like to do nothing he wants you to be without doing the work is crazy there's a good quote i heard yeah that i heard the other day everybody wants to be a let me just change the the word it says beast right everyone wants to be a beast everybody wants to be an eagle till it's time to do what eagles do is that right everybody wants to be a christian but ain't nobody want to do what christians are supposed to do what christians do and and that's what that's where they like oh you know this is kind of hard and and it's just not in them to do that because because they're not some uh it's just simply because god didn't put it on the inside some people are like that they don't have what it takes to do that to keep going but but but those that were were born and for more you get when i was young i felt i was called to something they're calling i have something bigger than this and and i i feel like i'm being beat down to the ground why is things so hard it's it's because it's because your calling is great because god called you to something greater than everybody else not everyone and goes through friendships that that we have to go through but but what when it is great so so is the character building and that that's a that's the way that i also heard that you should have this kind of set that you should think instead of me having this um i'm so down things are going bad and it's a bad day i'm just having a bad day instead have this thing where you're saying i'm having a character building day i thought man that's really good that that's really real because because in in the bad times god's working on your testimony and that that's how it is that like you have uh right right now um uh she she messaged me and she said i'm i'm dealing with a lot of uh well in a way she said like things in my thoughts is that my mind is attacking me in other words she's having spiritual warfare and and she she said to pray for she texted me this on on the way here well well when i was about to leave for here and i i just was thinking well i told her to listen to the sermon because because i had written down a lot of stuff that that she she's been going through i already wrote all this down you are not your thoughts you're the one listening to and all this what was written down before she texted me this so it just makes me think god is good i mean it's it feels like it felt more that god was leading me me to write down all this because because there's people real people going through this right now where they they feel like they're getting so much things going up in in their mind where they can't hardly control and it's just like they want it to stop and they don't know how to make it stop and it's it's hard it's difficult i know i've been through it i remember when i was i was just listening to depressing and music and and i was just in i was depressed in a place where i was depressed and i had all these thoughts going in my mind and it was like the the worst thing ever because it was always like singing in my mind i was in a really bad place i'm not i'm not uh going to say i'm i was an angel my whole life i've i've been went through some really bad stuff and and well and mainly in my mind it was always satan if satan can't get you in a trap in in the physical realm he'll get you in the spiritual realm in your mind where they'll put you in a he'll lock you in this this cage this this prison in your mind and that and i was in that prison before i remember singing in my mind in in that i hate myself that was literally a song that i listened to before that i hate myself in the end that's how i what always was whenever i would have awful thoughts i tried battling it by saying that that i hate myself and i hate these thoughts and i hate everything and and that's how bad you can get i think p people have gotten even worse than that to where to where they put a gun to the head i'm tired of these thoughts and it pulled the trigger that's it can drive people to the grave and with how much satan can attack one's mind because satan knows your potential and and satan will oh oh bring it he'll attack your mind he'll grab a hold of him and you'll say yeah you're mine and uh unless and unless yes we reach out to unto jesus and say god i don't want these thoughts anymore god i don't i want these things you i will always have you will always have the the battles in mind but but when it captures you and you say jesus set me free can set you free from every bit of those those thoughts every bit of those those things sure you will have um i remember even singing well actually i was rapping and i said there's a battle going on my mind and and there's a reason for that a reason for that satan and satan is trying to your mind to where you think everything is going to stay the same every nothing's going to change you're always going to be this person that that you know you are you're you're you're nothing but a you're nothing but and some um idiot that that thinks that they can escape this you think you can escape this that that's that's the thoughts that that satan tries to put in in your mind you can't escape you'll you won't have freedom you won't get your healing you won't be set free from from these things and satan does that he tells you these things and it's and it can come to us like your own thoughts why even try you're not you're not even going to get anywhere but you just got to say you just gotta resist the devil and say i've had enough devil get out and he will he will leave even and and what i told her was to really just really read that the bible and fill your mind with the word and just really meditate on those things and those thoughts will begin to to to change to from that to the word because you you're meditating you're feeding your mind those things just like what i was doing i was feeding my mind all this this depressing music and all this trash and and that's what happens and your mind and changes those things and satan uses that and he gets you to he he got me to listen to the in the beginning and he even and brought me in being like oh this is christian yeah it's not actually he's supposed to be it was nf he's supposed to be like a christian and he doesn't have any bad words in the music and all that don't listen to it because he he had nothing the all the music was nothing but like he would bring up god a bunch of times and this that the other but he had some kind of well he had ocd and different things and he would and he he was not the best christian and he didn't even he didn't even um he wouldn't and do it and really do it for the glory of god either he would just simply and just wrap a bunch of things about his thoughts and the battle and his mind and everything else like that and i began to think well that sounds nice no it just sounded nice because the beat was like oh yeah that sounds really good and it was for the flash and oh i can relate to that and it's just like this thing where i was so obsessed with it to to where it was it became what i would always think about all those lyrics and everything all the time so really if you're battling with any of those things stop focusing on all the negativity start thinking more positively if if you start thinking positively so so we'll your your life will get better and and instead of thinking i can't do this i can't do that yes you can it's just it's just your mind telling you that you can't musicians if you come and it's it is like that all and you will have to have battles and you will always have battles in your your mind sometimes and satan will will push his voices in your mind but but then there's that still small voice now i got i got that part down where we separated all all the voices in your mind where you're thinking of all the all the bad things all the bad side of it satan's voice there's satan's voice now i got that on the side now let's talk about god's voice god god speaks takes god speaks to us through it through his word and and i remember yeah i'll tell you in this story i remember when i was it was it was the worst time in my life the worst point in my life i remember not yeah this is it is the worst time in my life i was at the lowest of the low points and this was a time when when when i was addicted to when i was addicted to pornography i didn't understand the situation that i was in i didn't it was the worst thing that ever happened to me my parents found out and i was thinking this is so bad this is the worst thing ever i was like i was denying it i was in denial at first i knew i was struggling at that time and i was like i don't want to do this anymore and then god went and and helped me out but i didn't like it i don't it's not the way that i wanted it to go and i hated it how it it it was and i was really broken down because it's so shameful what i what i was doing and that i was full of shame i was like and now that they know and it's like you never wanted them to know that's the worst thing that could ever happen i thought and and i was i remember just breaking down i went out and outside in in a quiet place and i was just really crying and i was like god why does this have to happen i was going to stop but but that's a that's the thing it was always a thing where i was in the circle i'm going to stop and then back out again and stop and then back out again it was always a thing even if it took like a week all of a sudden something would tap me and get me back into it and i hated it and i wanted deliverance at the the time and god really did help me out and it was a lot of shame involved it was really bad it wasn't the way i wanted it to go but but god made it so that that would happen to help me and in the midst of the the tears in the midst of the crying and and just really sobbing and weeping because i i hated that i mean you could imagine i was so full of shame and guilt and all all these these thoughts and things my mom took my phone away i was glad she did and i was like okay that's good even though it was it's because i was addicted to into it for one and addicted to all that stuff and i'm i was glad deep down that she took it and because it would stop me from doing that and but in the midst of all that it would i heard the voice of god in my my mind it wasn't the kind of voice i always thought when i was younger wouldn't it be nice if god just spoke to me lip to ear but god only does that with his prophets so but god spoke to me in my mind and and i just knew it was the voice of god when i heard it it was that voice that said things are going to hurt right now but things are going to get better it i wouldn't have thought of that that because i was in the worst moment all of a sudden a sense of and and it just gave me that sense of peace and and i was just like and then i don't know how things are going to get better from now it's it just seems horrible and my thinking how my parents must see me and thinking how they must think of me and thinking of myself as such a horrible person like there's a statistic that ninety percent of of uh boys have struggled with it as some of them men that have struggled with it at some point in life it's horrible it's so the worst thing ever but thank god he delivered me from that it was it was a it's a demon that that get and to get because it's in in our self to to be like that attractiveness and stuff towards various women and all that we have it satan just perverted something that was good something that god meant for good that meant that god put in in us men but satan when perverted it and that's that's how how it is and it's it's also that same voice that same voice i hear when when things do it'll go bad it's just that that thing that positive thing things are going to be okay you're going to make it it's always that it's it's not negative when you feel like things are going to be bad and it's just that that still small voice that you hear you're going to make it through this now and we'll be like well i'm not sure that if that was god but if if you don't think in yourself that you could have ever thought of that probably was god if it was is scriptural and it was it was and it felt like it was god it probably was god and that that's that's how it is man let's pray stand with me if you will lord god i pray for for those that in in their mind where they're they're struggling to break free from those those things that that go on in their minds their their voices those voices they me get really loud it gets to the point where it's like like like why can't i have peace and and i felt that i i told when i was taught lord when i was talking to that that that girl i i which i was thinking i've been there and and lord i know you who put me through things for reasons to to help other people lord because your of your your calling is is great on my life and i believe that and i believe my calling is to help people it is to to and to help people lord nerd but but that you would you would guide me that i would would follow your voice and what you would show me to to speak lord those that are struggling right now those that have these in this battle that they're facing any kind of addiction any kind of thing anything in their minds anything lord that mind is is a powerful place and and when satan has control of it it it becomes a dark place a dark dark place and it fit and i know it it feels like we can't get get out sometimes lord but i pray for their freedom lord break every chain lord that that there will be no no open chains holding on to anyone that that that their minds would be free that then that they would hear your voice sword your voice in the midst of chaos and that that's how it was when i felt that i was in the midst of thinking these horrible thoughts and how bad things were going and i i was wishing things would be different and that these things had not happened and and that i wasn't having dealing with all this i wish it would would just leave but but lord you allow these things to build character to to to give us a testimony to say i broke free from those things to say look at what god has done in my life oh god i pray that you would break every chain that you would build such powerful testimonies in in each and every one of our lives lord even though it's hard even though we hate the process but but but you're doing it for our purpose for our calling for our testimony o god thank you lord for the struggles thank you lord for the trials the bad things that have come that i can say you set me free thank you lord for setting me free pray in jesus name amen [Music] amen for josh once my heart and soul were federed [Music] by the binding chains of sin oh but the great emancipator [Music] set me free to worship him o glory glory glory hallelu who we are blessed be his holy name for haters and that's the song of the redeemed and like a lost them i was drifting oh so helpless and alone oh but the seeking shepherd found me and he led me to my father's home amen you're dismissed tonight o glory glow
