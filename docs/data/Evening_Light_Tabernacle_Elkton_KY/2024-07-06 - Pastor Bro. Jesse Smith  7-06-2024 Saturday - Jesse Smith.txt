could possibly be in the house of the Lord Hallelujah Lord you told us if we're planted in the house of God then we'll flourish in the courts of Our Lord so father God we're planted here tonight Lord

beautiful Church Lord God in the natural and how much more in this spiritual that's been purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah unreprovable without blemish Without Blame by the blood of Jesus Christ we thank you for these blessings bless this reading of Thy word tonight Lord God we'll be happy and thankful when we leave this place in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're standing here let's take our Bibles we like to go to Numbers Chapter 19 here i' like to preach on the Waters of Separation perhaps you've heard brother Brandon preach it in 1955 uh it's a wonderful message I believe it was June 6th if I'm not mistaken U he preached this message while you're turn in there i' like to uh bring greetings from our church back home we're just a very very small Church our church can probably just fit in just right here by God's grace if not maybe three quarters of this here by God's grace so uh we're thankful you know we had brother Thomas there and he got to visit us and I was so glad he was blessed you know I was just thankful he was blessed and to get the invitation you know I'm humbled you know our church is so small um but we're thankful we have a big God though that's the best part it doesn't matter how big or small the church is we got a big God we love the Lord Jesus Christ so we're thankful for uh the fellowship today with brother Thomas and Donna what wonderful Saints they are praise God I don't know if I could be amongst sweeter Christians and that you know just the hospitality and the sweetness of the Holy Spirit and like I said they Victoria caught her first ate fish because of brother Thomas and sister Donna so we're thankful for that car caught six more herself there so I caught a couple too by God's grace but uh it's wonderful to see what God has done for your pastor out there you know uh at his home and uh you know it's just amazing what God can do with one person praise God and you know all the the helpers and the vision that he has here and this is just a beautiful church and we're thankful to be here my first time here uh so we're thankful to be in the house of God I don't get out very much I'm a pastor you know I stay close to the church don't get a lot of invitations that's okay I I I was I was already invited by Jesus to be the pastor of the church so that's the most important invitation I need but it is refreshing you know it really really is refreshing to come to a church and visit the Saints and just see the same holy spirit that we see in our services with here with you as well by God's grace so Numbers Chapter 19 off after we uh read the text I'll probably share just a few more things about my family and our church by God's grace but let's have this uh reading and then we'll have you be seated by God's grace like to preach again on the Waters of Separation this this this sermon has uh blessed my heart and I've seen it you know when I preach at different places I've seen this message really minister to others as well so I hope it'll be a great blessing to you verse one says and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded saying speak in the children of Israel that they may bring thee a red hepher without spot how many know that Israel has about five of them if I'm not mistaken they got five of them last year wein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke and ye shall give her unto alers of the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face now I'm going to skip down to verse nine and if you could could you read tonight i' like to hear your voices you our our church I always have our church read you know at least one verse together it's nice to hear your voice nice to hear the Saints speak the word of God how many know there's life in the power of the tongue so if you haven't spoke it yet today now you're going to be blessed now you're going to feel the power of God because you're speaking God's word let's read verse N9 I like to count it on three 1 2 3 and a man that is clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the hepher and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of Separation it is a purification for sin may God add his Blessing to reading his word you may be seated I like to record these you know I can share them with my wife and the Saints like to hear them you know so I'm just going to record the audio myself and again it's a privileged to be here by God's grace I'm humbled to be here and I hope brother that brother Thomas I hope we can have you up to preach for us when it uh fits your schedule brother we'd love to have that by God's grace and he just did a wonderful job up there helping the Navar Saints we call him the Navar Saints the former Amish former Amish community up there it's about 45 minutes south of our church and uh he did a wonderful job helping I don't know how this guy does it I don't he he must have unlimited energy I need to talk to him about energy afterwards by God's grace I I'm chasing around my eight children I'm working a full-time job uh and I'm pastoring a church and I'm like how does this guy do all this does he have some secret energy I don't know about but brother uh it's so such a blessing to be with you sir we appreciate you God bless you uh just a little bit about me you know I uh uh I was raised in Assemblies of God church I didn't know the message um and then I heard the message in November it was Thanksgiving night 2001 what a Thanksgiving brother Ram tells us in the invisible Union what a Thanksgiving Hallelujah thanksgiving's a message and uh from that moment my life's been you know transformed by the Gospel of Jesus Christ because that's what we have we actually have the real Gospel of Jesus Christ we call the message and it is but it's the message of the original Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and uh so you know since then uh you know shortly after that I would say you know uh 3 years after that I was married to my lovely wife we've been now married married 21 years I don't want to forget that 21 years sometimes I forget how many years we've been married uh and you know she's born me eight children we have uh eight beautiful children two of them here tonight so we're thankful for them and I've been a school teacher as our as your pastor said I've been a school teacher now for 20 years I just finished up 20 years there I teach the little ones I teach first grade I had the choice to go higher but boy I really like those little ones they still hug you you know they they draw you pictures they tell you they love you so I like to stay with the little ones I know you know some people may think that's ridiculous but I it just kind of fits me you know and it makes sense I got eight children I might as well teach children you know by God's grace uh I just likeed that you know I just like the children there um and so um you know I started preaching oh yeah uh I was baptized by the pastor brother Isaiah Brooks if you know him and then uh he made me a deacon and then I started preaching in 2004 now I've been preaching 20 years hard to believe that uh just flies by like that you know but so many wonderful blessings I'll share some testimonies you know tonight and tomorrow um and so then you know we we were driving 3 hours every one way every Sunday to support brother Isaiah because he was my pastor you know but then we felt led we should start a church that was in 2006 and so I've been pastoring you know 18 years uh since 2006 our church has grown mostly with children we've got a few more adults than we started it's mostly grown with children and uh and so I started a YouTube Ministry if you like YouTube you know of course you got to stay away from all the evil but there's good stuff on there but I started a YouTube Ministry in 2013 so I've been doing that for 11 years and putting out videos defending brother brandom I started a podcast a few years ago called defending the message I've written two books I wrote a book about modesty you know the outward appearance and then I wrote a book about the New Testament Mysteries brother brand mentions them and cers this is the end time he he mentions Scofield's list of mysteries and he says how the the church age messenger was to reveal those so I wrote a book on that as well I just love the word you know our brother said you know I'm a teacher that's I you know that's what I am by Nature I'll try to preach a little bit though tonight by God's grace you know I just when I'm out and about I don't like to maybe teach so much I kind of like to preach and build your faith you know but either way you know when you teach the roots go deeper by God's grace so we'll just see whatever you all pull out you know that's really what it depends on brother BR said a preacher can do he can have whatever anointing he has but the people got to have the same anointing right it's it's a it's a fellowship right it's a it's it's a teamwork right it's a it's a family right everybody in the family's got to do part Hallelujah so uh that's a little bit about me um that's probably all you want to hear about me let's get to the word of God here as as we'll preach you know we'll try to bring out these thoughts so looking at the Waters of Separation again brother Randon preached this in 1955 it's a tremendous message he had to shorten it because uh he was short on time and he wouldn't do the prayer line at the end he said you know teaching was a different anointing because he had to get under the different anointing to do the prayer line at the end um but he actually called this message a teaching so maybe it will be some teaching but just before I forget you know I want to read this quote brother random said in 1954 he said uh we need some spiritual vitamins God has got them for you to help your spirit up to pep you up a little that's the preaching of the Gospel Hallelujah if that won't pep up the church there's nothing that will because Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God so if you want to leave here with a little more pep in your life receive the word of God say Amen to the word of God repent of any sins any uh easily besetting sin repent of that receive the word of God and you'll walk out of here with more energy than when you came in you'll walk out of here happier than when you came in I know for this for a fact I know you'll walk out of here more hopeful than when you came in because we spend you know our time out in the world you we hear the news and we hear all things you going on and then the people get sick and there's disruptions to our life maybe lower finances here or sickness there whatever it might be but I tell you if you get in line with the word of God you'll walk out of here with a lot of Hope for the future praise God because God is the uh he's the author he's the author and finisher of your faith Hallelujah you're in the you're in the palm of his nail scarred hand Hallelujah no man can pluck you out of the father's hand Hallelujah no man put you there no man can pluck you out praise God so you got nothing to worry about amen brother B said the whole Christian uh walk is rest in the Lord amen what are we doing we're resting in Jesus Christ hallelujah amen so you know we uh we we pulled inspiration from the Waters of Separation brother R also mentions this in uh briefly about 50 minutes into the sermon he mentions this in the basis of Fellowship 195 I'm sorry 1961 so this is a message about Fellowship brother brandom uses it for fellowship and also separation from sin Hallelujah and remember as we go on you know brother raham says Devils don't move unless you expose them and then the Bible also says tells us in Jude chapter 1 there's only one chapter the Bible says you've got to hate even the Garment spotted by the Flesh of sin so you know if if we want to draw close to God if we want a closer fellowship with God we've got to hate our sin we've got to repent of our sin Hallelujah because we all fight Devils uh we we we all fight evil spirits uh brother Ram says the worst devil of all of them is the devil of unbelief he said that's the worst one he said but the worst feeling of all the Devils now listen feeling he said the worst feeling is the devil of nervousness or distress anybody felt nervous these last few years Co make anybody nervous of course of course it did we we never gone through it gone through it before but brother says the worst demon uh feeling is a evil sphere of nervousness that's why we got to come to the house of God and let off the pressure hallelujah praise God the Bible calls it casting down anything that exalts itself against the word of God cast it down Hallelujah and bring every thought into captivity to the Lord and then you're able by God's grace to believe again hallelujah it's not that you lost all your faith but it just that you uh you know you had a mind battle and the Bible said you the the devil can develop a stronghold in your mind brother random calls it a complex anybody ever had a complex before a complex is when somebody says something about that brother in instantly evil feelings and yet you should have felt good feelings about them why didn't you feel L to that person because you got a complex you have a stronghold build up in your mind but the Bible said we have Mighty weapons to tear down strongholds your pastor knows a thing or two about tearing down buildings I saw a video of it today Hallelujah that's what that's what overcoming a complex is it's tearing down the building Hallelujah and why' he tear it down so he can build something back up Hallelujah that's what God wants to do in our life he wants to build down an evil you know an evil spirit or a bad feeling he wants to tear that down and build up something strong praise God build up something that would glorify God hallelujah and so as we gone we we have to remember these things that this message is for fellowship with God also for one another but mainly God and then it's for separation from sin uh brother random said I in 1961 he said he preached it back in 1955 and he said a Jewish rabbi was sitting in the audience and this this story is about being uh the Waters of Separation outside of Moses's Tabernacle how many know Moses Tabernacle had a fence to it and it had a door at the front there's a picture of it out there you got the pillar of Fire coming down out there right with with Moses Tabernacle but the Waters of Separation happened outside before you even got into the outer Court Hallelujah it happens out there and and and there's all these steps there's steps to the water separation and then you know when you enter in then there's steps there's the Brazen altar then there's the Laver right and then there's a door to the holy place you got your candlesticks you got your shoe bread you got your altar of incense then you have another Veil yeah and then once you go in there now you go in the presence of God hallelujah and so a Jewish rabbi was sitting there here brother random preaches and the brother Rand said the Jewish rabbi repented he said I never heard it like that in all my life now he's a Critic of Christianity but he hears brother Randon preaches and he says after that he said he said I come from a generation of Rabbi Rabbi after Rabbi after Rabbi brother Ram said and he said and now I'm a Pentecostal Rabbi with with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen so he was a Jew who had the Bible said God blinded the Jews he had blinders on but as brother Adam preaches the Holy Ghost took off the blinders and now he had the eyes salv amen and now he had eyes that can see Hallelujah ears that could hear praise God and he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen oh the life of God Amen if it'll do it to a Pentecostal Rabbi how about a message believer sitting on the message Pew the last 40 Years of your life amen or the last 18 years of your life or the last 15 years of your life how much more will this message take off your blinders so you can see the word of God so you can see Jesus Christ in every detail of the Bible hallelujah amen now if you look at numbers 19:10 notice the Bible says he that gathers the ashes of the heph I we'll build up to this in a moment but I just want you to see this shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even that's speaking of the the priest or the helper of the priest that would take up these ashes and be unclean to the even and it shall be unto the children of Israel and unto the stranger everybody say and ready and so this this Waters of separation is for the children of Israel but notice it's also for the stranger the Gentile the Bible calls them prelit by the time of Solomon there was almost a quarter million prelit in in Israel that that had come to the faith how many how many appreciate the fact that Rahab was a a proelite how many appreciate appreciate Uriah was a proelite Ruth was a proelite amen and Jesus even put them in his lineage hallelujah amen glory god did welcome prosites but you had to come God's provided way and there's only one provided way that's God's Pro chosen place of worship Hallelujah that's in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah brother Bram said if I'm going to try to call you out of something he said I got to have a place for to Appo you to he said I'm not going to point you to a Braham Tabernacle he said that's just the same as any of them he said but I will point you to one place that's Jesus Christ God's provided place of worship hallelujah amen glory we sto by Jeffersonville on the way here I always like to stop there and pay my respects to God's Prophet amen but we saw some empty Tabernacles there there's a reason they're empty amen I won't go too much in that I already do enough of that on YouTube amen but but notice here he said it's for the Stranger in verse 10 that sojourneth among them for a statute forever so notice this water separation is for every message believer whether you're brand new a stranger you just come in the church or you've been here your whole life life amen the Waters of Separation was for everybody everybody was going to need this just let time take its toll Hallelujah if you hang around long enough you're going to see pretty soon all your Zeal uh will run out for a little bit as Jesus says sometimes you lose your first love it's harder to press play it's harder to open up your Bible it's harder to go in the prayer closet the church said we lose our first love where's our original Zeal well it it it's somewhere and you can go get it amen you can bring it back praise God Jesus tells us the way to do it do your first Works amen he says repent of whatever you've been sitting with and go back and do the first works all over again amen oh Hallelujah Jesus wouldn't ask you to do something if he didn't tell you how to do it so tells us how to do it that's how you get your first love go do what you first did when you first came in the message amen or you first got the holy ghost or you first got sanctification or you first had a miracle go back and do the first works that's the way back hallelujah amen hallelujah brother R said Oh what a beautiful separ I'm sorry he said oh what a beautiful picture that separation the Waters of Separation it's separated the guilty and made them holy and brought them back into Fellowship again now I have a hard time believing anybody in here would be guilty of sin I'm being facius I know we're all guilty of sin right brother man said I'm my worst enemy my biggest enemy is William brandham Hallelujah I'm my biggest enemy right brother Thomas is we're our own biggest enemies praise God and there's times we feel guilty brother brand says we have a remedy for that we don't have to remain feeling guilty we can feel forgiven hallelujah how many believe that by God's grace and then brother Adam quotes first john8 the blood of Jesus Christ if we confess our sins cleanses us from allr and makes us holy and puts us back into Fellowship again with the father see beautiful isn't it brother ROM said hallelujah amen I love it now the red heer brother R tells us what the red heer is brother Ram said notice everything pointed to Christ brother Ram said even the Waters of Separation The Red heer he said it couldn't be a brown one it had to be a red one and brother said that r red represents Redemption he said sometimes red looks is danger to us right like a stop sign don't go through the stop sign or a stop light but brother mam says he said a red heer this represents Redemption he said follow that red all down through the Bible oh we see Genesis 3:21 we see Adam and Eve with with lamb skins on what is it it's bloody red Hallelujah is that right amen then in Rahab what do we see a Scarlet Red thread Hallelujah is that right and then at Jesus's death what do we see he's covered his bones stare at him the Bible said his tongue clung to the roof of his mouth that's how thirsty he was anybody ever felt that way before that thirsty his tongue clung to the roof of his mouth his bone stared at him and blood poured out all over and he was bleeding for you and I praise God he willingly did that for the joy that was set before him so he could see you saved hallelujah it's a red it's a red line all the way of redemption and brother bam said this red heer represents Redemption Hallelujah he said everything points to Christ the Bible says here in numbers 19 it has it has without spot this has to and as you've heard you probably heard about the heers in in uh Israel they're protecting them from the Hamas and everything you know to make sure uh that nobody can get to these heers because they're going to need one of these heers when they build their new Temple they cannot sacrifice or get even get even into the temple until they have this red heer and the Waters of Separation Hallelujah so that's why many people think we're at the end time well we know we're at the end time amen denominational churches they you know they're they're just guessing but we know for sure praise God we see Israel back in her Homeland the Fig Tree is putting forth its buds and brother R said all the other trees are too you see the pope went to the G7 a you weeks ago and Biden's rubbing his forehead with the Pope what's that that's the mother Harlot and that's the Beast out of the earth rubbing their foreheads together putting their heads together oh my church we we need to be ready praise God but this red heer had had no spot no blemish the Bible said Jesus is without spot and no blemish and this red heer never came a yoke upon this red heer and brother Ram said notice never a yoke on his neck Christ was not yolked with any organization and the church said isn't that beautiful amen this red effer didn't he wasn't yolked to Pentecost amen he wasn't yolked to Lutheran he wasn't yolked to Jeffersonville he wasn't yolked to anywhere he was Yol he wasn't yolked at all he was free hallelujah amen that's what we are we're free hallelujah we're not yolked to the world Amen Hallelujah we are free in Christ Hallelujah amen so we see Jesus in every type the Bible said the red effort had to be taken without the camp and Hebrews 13 said Jesus was taken outside the camp oh it's beautiful praise God now notice once they burnt I'm sorry once they killed the red heer they had to take the blood and the Bible tells us here in uh verse four elaser the priest shall take her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the Tabernacle of the congregation seven times Hallelujah brother tells us what this means again a basis of Fellowship he says look oh the next thing he took he had seven Stripes of blood before him to show that the seven Stripes meant the seven Church ages at every age had to be represented by the blood nothing else no other way from Genesis the Revelation from Eden to the Millennium it's the blood and nothing but the blood Hallelujah so El would take that blood and he wasn't inside yet he wasn't even in the outer court and he had to sprinkle one Ephesus two samna peramos thyra Hallelujah Sardis Philadelphia and thank God there's blood for leoda Hallelujah there's blood for us and let me tell you the same blood that was shed for Paul's sins as a he he was a blasphemer and the same blood that saved him and the same blood that will save us hallelujah not a different blood not a different sacrifice same blood same sacrifice same power Same Love same Mercy same forgiveness the same God hallelujah amen hallelujah so when Paul says uh when I sin it's not me it's the sin that dwelleth within me I can say Amen to that Hallelujah and then I always bring up 1 John 3:9 uh do you have it up there can you is that possible it's okay if you don't 1 John 3:9 but it says he that uh he he that has the seed of God does not commit sin huh two chapters earlier in chapter one John said If any man says he doesn't have sin he's a liar right and then two chapters later uh he tells us that if we if we uh I'm sorry that if we have the seed of God we do not commit sin because the seed of God is in him and it remains there it is thank you sir good job back there whosoever is born of God how many you born again you're born from above you have life from above amen hallelujah not just life from this Earth but life from Heaven Hallelujah his seed remains in him see the holy when you get the Holy Ghost it's like a seed and it's brother says it's growing all the time you just feed it it's going to grow he said it starts off like a little button just keep feeding that butt my my your button must be pretty big by now brother amen hallelujah must be big like a a uh some type of grapefruit or something like that some likee of softball maybe football or basketball you keep feeding that service after service after service it grows but notice you cannot sin what can't sin the seed of God in you cannot sin I had to heard some more amens on that one Hallelujah the seed of God in you cannot sin other words your soul can never sin Hallelujah that's right your mind your flesh will sin every day brother said I make thousands of mistakes in a month he said sure I do thousands of mistakes in a year he said but every time I'm wrong I say Jesus forgive me and Jesus forgave him Hallelujah but in one way that soul never sin in the first place because the soul is a seed of God well whose seed is that God's seed that seed inside of you is part of God's spirit and if it's part of God's spirit it has the Eternal qualities of God Amen oh you've got Eternal nature to you praise God so what's our responsibility to get outside of our thoughts to get outside of the Flesh and and and hear the Holy Ghost and our soul guiding us telling us the truth amen hallelujah the spirit Bears witness that we are the sons and daughters of God hallelujah Glory now we see it there's seven and then brother Ram says uh he says in the next in verse six they had to take wood hiss up and Scarlet with that with that killed beast and burn it all together brother Raam said Scarlet his up was put together and burnt which meant the dispensations of Grace he says justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost W Scarlet HS up in another place brother says father son Holy Ghost amen isn't that beautiful church amen we see God uses these three parts now I tell you people leave the message one thing they don't like is when you say there's three works of Grace but you just keep preaching that brother you Saints you just keep believing that they hate that you know why because they realiz because they don't want to go on with God but you want to go on with God can I just say it like that they want an easy religion where you can just go to church and still live holy still listen to rock and roll still cuss and swear and fornicate watch filthy movies I've heard them say it amen I listen to their podcast in order to bunk them amen I'm not afraid of them God show me the truth if I've got a big sword what am I afraid of some devil right I got a big old Eternal sword amen but said it fits just perfectly in my hand amen he said what is it it's a sword to the king he said it's what I live by Brother Ram live by the word you and I live by the word hallelujah that's what we live by praise God but you keep believing that you you you children you got to get saved but then you got to get Sanctified brother BR said clean up your evil thoughts and dirty habits he says then when you do that he said uh the Bible also calls it Ezekiel 13 new heart new spirit my spirit and then when you get the Holy Ghost everyone will see and hear it that's what the Bible said Peter said God has shed forth this which you see which you see and hear amen and brother said any baby that's born you can see it and hear it hallelujah amen if it's still born he said give it a a a a stimulation a what do you say like a a spanking stimulation I can't remember the exact Old Kentucky word hallelujah but I glad to be in Kentucky by God's grace Hallelujah I was listening to brother BR preaching and on the way here and he said those to Kentucky mothers he said uh if there are girls come in late night with with makeup all over their faces and their dresses undone he said those old Kentucky mothers would get out of uh uh come with some type of a stick and make sure they never did that again I thought I'm in Kentucky tonight amen said that must be a sign I'm supposed to preach this tonight Hallelujah but you just keep believing that church you got to be saved you got to be Sanctified you got to be filled with the Holy Ghost amen and then even after you get the Holy Ghost you got to constantly be Sanctified this right here this is already born again is this right here oh God help me as Paul said help me to Die daily help me to bring every thought into captivity to Christ Hallelujah now you see it's a purification for sin so they'd kill the animal uh use the blood then they burn the red heer and mix the the Scarlet his up and the wood and then they they would burn it all they take the ashes and mix it with water put it in a in some type of a charger and then then they could use it Hallelujah brother calls it well brother tells us it's the water of Separation this mixture is going to bring you back into Fellowship it took a red heer to die to suffer and bleed and give its life so it could cleanse you and bring you back into Fellowship something had to die to bring you back into Fellowship after you're already a Christian right Jesus Jesus is the Once once and for all offering hallelujah amen the once and for all offering praise God and so we realize if we get dirty if we lose our fellowship there's one place we got to go we got to go back to the Waters of Separation amen glory now verse 11 now here's where we get some of our trouble let me just break into this for a few moments here thank you for that water by God's grace I don't think I drank enough today so thank you I appreciate that I normally don't drink water when I'm on the road but I think all the heat today kind of you know kind of gets to you verse 11 he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days oh wow so if if you touch a touch a dead person man woman child or something like that you're instantly unclean you can't worship you can't go into the temple see that verse 12 and he shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third day then the seventh day he should not be clean I love this God makes you be diligent and God makes you be sincere that you really want to come back to church God said if you touch something dead he said now you wait three days let's see if you can wait three days come here in three days right Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Wednesday night service three days later amen hallelujah and God make sure you really want to be clean you you can't coming to church yet it's got to be seven total days he said if you can be sincere I'll I'll sprinkle you again on the third day but now you got to wait till the seventh day and then you can come and worship again Hallelujah so you got to get sprinkled on the third day then you got to be really sincere for four more days and then you'll you'll be sprinkled again on the seventh day now you can come back and worship I'm glad it's not like that now brother Thomas I missed one service I I think all my 18 years of Pastor I missed five Services cuz I was sick I couldn't wait I couldn't wait to get back in the presence of God live streaming is no fun there are way too many distractions live streaming Hallelujah you got to be there you but said you can't wait to go see your family your brothers and sisters he said they can't chain you out of church they can't wire you out of church Glory Hallelujah that you can't wait to go your brothers and sisters have some fellowship hear the word of God have your strength renewed like the eagle hallelujah amen I've seen it countless times over the 18 years of pastoring so Wednesday night after work I don't sometimes I don't feel like going to church I'm tired maybe I'm batt in sickness I drag myself there I know I got to preach and I don't feel very good but pretty soon we get into the song service oh pretty soon we start stomping clapping I'm like oh I feel pretty good now hallelujah praise the Lord and pretty soon I'm dancing pretty soon what is it it's strength the Bible said he inhabits the Praises of his people praise God Amen and I leave there like a brand new man Hallelujah that look like a different person walk in there tired I couldn't sleep last night walk out of there I can't wait to witness or tell somebody's about Jesus or help somebody out that's the power of Jesus Christ Hallelujah verse 13 whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that's dead and purify not himself defileth the Tabernacle of the Lord see what they do if they touch something dead and try to come to church you defile the whole church right and that Soul shall be cut off from Israel see if they fail to repent of that dead touching the dead and they fail to get sprinkled you're no longer a part of the church Hallelujah because the water of Separation was not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon Him Hallelujah verse 14 and this is the law when a man dieth in a tent and all that come into the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days now look at that if it's inside a tent and something dies everything in the tent is unclean Hallelujah sound familiar sound like something uh something accidentally dies in your house I'm not talking about natural death I'm talking about spiritual things somebody let some sin in the house the church said see the type now if something died in the house everything was defiled in the house me say like this maybe this little more familiar if Dad makes a mistake it affects the whole family if mom makes a mistake it affects the whole family if teenager makes a mistake it affects the whole family but but thank God we have a way to be purified we have a way to get back into Fellowship God has a way to clean up the mess hallelujah hallelujah sometimes we see mistakes families make and it hurts the entire family you're going to have to deal with it but God can cleanse the home again he's got to provide a way to do it he's already got a dead sacrifice amen he's already got three works of Grace amen he's already got Waters amen he's got everything you need he can purify and clean out your house so you can get back into Fellowship amen hallelujah isn't that beautiful man so there's all kinds of things that people bring into their house dead things most thing is probably cell phones right if we we don't use them correctly they can bring dead things in the home Hallelujah I saw an article recently it said uh it said uh Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook now I used to be on Facebook I'm not anymore because of what he did to Trump now I'm I'm not saying Trump's even saved I'm just saying I didn't like how he tried to silence that free speech so I got off of Facebook I said that's going to be my uh that's going to be my way to show him you know I don't know how much I showed him right I'm like I'm going to be against that guy from now on but anyways there was an article that said you know he owns Instagram and the the research said if you just set up an Instagram account within a few Taps they're going to introduce pornography into you even if you're a minor take think consider that parents consider that within a few Taps on a brand new account they're going to put up one of those videos I never I was never really on Instagram I'm not on it now but you better be careful what you're bringing in your house something might die in there and really who's responsible mom dad now I also heard this uh preacher say he said uh when should you give your child a cell phone he said when you want your uh child's childhood to end it's pretty good amen I'll take that because pretty soon they're going to be by theirselves off with that right and before I got you know I have two children with cell phones I have a 19-year-old a 17-year-old they got cell phones my 15-year-old down they don't have cell phones they going to get it till they start driving a car and I'm going to be checking in on them about the cell phones like I did my other ones by God's grace I'm going check their screen time I'm going be checking in that's my phone I bought it is that right that's my phone that ain't their phone that's my phone Hallelujah that's right but see as soon as they get that to themselves that sin nature slip on him brother B said he would struggle most when he was tired he said and overworked if you listen to perfect fath 63 brother man says that he said I go through my spells too that's right he said don't think I'm immune to Temptation he said Satan comes on me when I'm tired and overworked he'll whisper and say he say brother brandham you have no friends in the world can you imagine that that was Satan's tactic you don't have any friends in the world you should just leave the church no friends brother Ram said that really you know got him going so to fight that brother Ram would say Satan look out in the parking lot the church there's cars here from Alabama People drove from Florida to hear me preach he said he said take that whatever you got and shove it right in the devil's face and say you liar amen hallelujah I got friends I am a Christian amen hallelujah whatever he says you bring the opposite give him proof and show him I am a Christian I never said I was perfect but I've got a perfect sacrifice amen yeah and brother raham said if I have to do one thing for my salvation brother said this if I have to do one thing for my salvation then Jesus died in vain Glory praise God that means salvation is not based upon me salvation is based upon Jesus Christ amen the red heer amen hallelujah and then we just do works out of our appreciation for Jesus hallelujah praise God hallelujah I'm not saved by my works I'm saved by grace through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God Amen Hallelujah so when do you want your children's childhood to end when you give them a cell phone or tablet see Church these are the things that they get into people's lives and it it's a death in the house it's a spiritual death in the house it's going to affect the whole house or maybe it's like this this sometimes in my house yeah I got I got six girls and two boys I got eight children did I tell you that I got eight children from uh 19 all the way down to three you know by God's grace I I love it I just love my children I love spoiling them too you know I like I like to buy them stuff and spoil them all the time you that's right well that's cuz I was poor I didn't you know my parents were divorced I was poor we had six you know I had six siblings and we never got anything so I like to spoil my kids a little bit by God's grace they're only young once anyway you know Hallelujah yeah right I forgot I lost my track my train of thought there I already know what I was preaching on there start talking about that the dead things yes the dead things but I was I'm going to just back back to that I can't think of it now but you know we have to make sure things that come in our house they defile our house oh I know what I remember it was arguments sometimes my girls or sometimes my my oldest son and my teenage girls they start arguing and fussing name calling that can be a a dead thing if they don't repent of that because every then every time brother walks by a sister he slaps him pushes him kind of playful like that that's an evil spirit and the church said the Bible said cherish one another love one another don't pick on each other oh here here's another one name calling that's a real death in the house do not let them call names unless it's like uh my my wonderful brother and sister you darling you know you're sweetheart you're handsome just use those if not it's going to cause sibling rivalries that's true never degrade them I told both girls before we came I said girls you look beautiful tonight and I don't care if anybody else thinks that I think it and they're going to know that Daddy thinks they're beautiful before some Slicker comes around and says something like that they'll know well Daddy treat treat me way better Hallelujah Daddy's a real man of God he loves God Amen Hallelujah but if you let fighting and name calling and bickering if you don't stop that it's a death in the home and there's only one way to clean it out through the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah the Old Testament called it Waters of Separation but in the New Testament the blood of Jesus Christ will separate those children from their sins Hallelujah to clean your house back out by the grace of God Amen now we can go through a lot of these sometimes people don't pay tithes and offerings that's another death in the house and I personally believe if they don't do that how can they be born again if you can't open your wallet to God how can you open your soul to God and I'm not asking for more money that's not why I do it but it's selfishness it's a lack of faith you're the Bible said you're robbing God and some people say oh that's not in the New Testament you failed to read your Bible it's 1 Corinthians 9:13 and 14 Paul said God has ordained they which preach the gospel should live of the Gospel again all these accusers brother random all these accusers these haters of the message what they do is they hate the Bible that's what it really is but we love the Bible amen the Bible's got all the answers brother says brother said if I die in my tracks right now he said the Bible's my absolute amen hallelujah he said an absolute is Limitless in power that's what an absolute is Limitless in power the church said what now the tapes can't be the absolute because look what the tapes have done to Jeffersonville they lost all the power Hallelujah I believe in the tapes but brother never said my tapes are the absolute thus sayith the Lord uh they're equal to the Bible brother R never said that but yes but and brother Praises he he Praises at the end of preaching the absolute there in 63 I believe it's January brother said I pray for this congregation that they will come to know you as the absolute Hallelujah Glory he's praying to God and he says may this congregation know that you are the absolute brother R said God's absolute is the word of God right so all these tap people they have a different absolute than God I don't know about you but I don't have God's absolute I know there's a fine line but I think you understand what I'm saying right brother man said there's quotes brother said I have no power to do anything well then he can't be the absolute because the absolute is Limitless of power right Hallelujah brother said he says I make uh mistakes all the time on tape he says 700 that didn't bow the knee instead of 7,000 we need to start listening to more tapes the church said they're listening to tapes but they're not hearing them they're just listening to them they're not hearing them yeah brother said God makes no mistakes God doesn't make contradictions God doesn't make errors Hallelujah God's absolute is his word hallelujah oh you're a good Bible believing church here praise God hallelujah that's right another thing is with you know the relationships between husbands and wives if they can't get that solved out something's wrong if God can't get in your bedroom and clean out that how can he get in your soul Hallelujah and I know there there's pains for people's past and I know there's scars but the Bible said Jesus is so tender he won't break a breeze rud Hallelujah so if you've been hurt in your past Jesus won't come and just break it all up the Bible said he binds up the Brokenhearted we've got if we got hurts from our marriage or hurts from our family hurts from parents Jesus will take those pieces and he'll start putting them back together thank you Jesus he'll bind it back up he'll just rub it back in there he's got some some spiritual glue he can just put it all that broken heart back together the Bible said a wounded Spirit who can bear only you see you you can't bear it you got to cast your cares on Jesus so he can bear It cast your cares on Jesus for he cares for you how many really believe that he cares for you tonight you really you really believe that I'm more convinced than ever in my life that he cares for me I have so many testimonies I could fill the whole service with testimonies where God shows up with eight kids and I'm I'm a teacher I'm not a rich man everybody knows that if you know anything about teaching I'm no rich man you know in Ohio you can look up every teacher's income you can go look up my income after service if you want it's on there every it has it's public information but we we've been so down on finances sometimes one time a few years ago was it was two it was 2020 no 20 19 we we bought an old Fixer Upper House you know that's all I could afford and my wife you know we just had a real small kitchen I mean it was maybe and we had already had six kids by that time it was maybe like this you know maybe and uh she was just saying brother Jesse it's really hard and I just sat out there I'm a husband I'm like why can't I make more money what's wrong with me like I'm such a loser you know that's what I was thinking and I was just I was holding the baby there and I just said a prayer I said Lord perhaps in 10 years you can you can give me a new kitchen to help out my wife she worked so hard she feeds feeds six children plus me she takes such good care of me she never she never complains one year later we had a friend of the family come up and say God told me to fix up your kitchen he's a construction worker I didn't ask him to do that he said God told him to do it he said brother Jesse I looked at my wife and I said honey God loves you Hallelujah cuz God gave her something I couldn't give her all I do is study and you know teach that's all I do I wish I had Cales like his hands you know such a good worker that guy come in there he said while he renov it took six weeks to renovate our kitchen while he renovated our kitchen he got five brand new contracts and the biggest one of his entire history of his company he said because God told him to do that Hallelujah I asked him a few years later I said brother how much money you think you save me he said at least 80 grand that's 80 grand I didn't have and he said also at the same time he uh some rich woman up in Cleveland said you know what I just put in brand new cabinets I don't like them take them out he she she said throw him away and the man said can I have him she's he's like yeah she's like yeah he's like uh do you want them brother Jesse I'm like yeah I'll take them I don't have to pray about that one Hallelujah she also said you know I don't want this stove anymore this stove you know it's like a $55,000 stove I don't even know how much these things cost I you I don't like this stove anymore uh do you I'm just GNA throw it away would you like it he's like yeah he like do you want it brother Jess yes I'll take it amen my wife in six weeks had a brand new kitchen amen God gave her something I couldn't give her Hallelujah that's what the Bible said delight yourself in the Lord and he'll give you the desires of your heart praise God I've never seen it fail I might as well say this here too we had a we had a gentleman come back I baptized him in 2016 he left the message he left because he thought he was the reason we're going through trials and I told him I said brother every Church goes through trials the brother M says if you don't go through trials you're not a true church so he left and he was a musician he thought I'm going to go out to Arizona and I'm going to try to become a famous musician he got into Satanism all these things and I'd already baptized him spells everything he got all this stuff now after he left I think Caris back there Caris hold up your hand there Caris put a prayer request said please pray for brother Austin to come back 2016 I said amen let's pray well guess what we prayed he didn't come back and then our her other sister uh Haven Haven's two years older than Caris Caris is

every service they put a prayer request in please pray for Austin to come in now brother at the beginning my faithful strong I'm like praise God about a year and I'm like I I don't think he's coming back guys but I kept reading the prayer requests and whose Faith was Strong by that time not me your faith Hallelujah they believe when I thought I you know he was on he was blown up on Instagram and you know he was making these worldly songs I'm like this guy ain't coming back that just shows how much a preacher can you know be be human right that's right fast forward to 2020 four years later they're still putting prayer requests almost every every service four years later he calls me up and said brother Jesse I just had I was listening to your sermon and I had a dream that night of a woman who has covid here and she got well he said ' I went to her and told her and prayed for her she had Co she was going to die prayed for her and she miraculously recovered he said that was God's

had that 13,000 to get me through it hallelujah amen hallelujah see people can't tell me the Lord don't love Mees not only not only did he Pride all those financial he's done greater because he saved my soul he saved your soul brother bam said any Idol any Idol in your life defiles your house that's right and here's one for you sisters now this might help you this helped out a sister out in Pennsylvania she come up weeping after service now it might not apply to you but I don't know if you ever thought about this this is thirsting for life march 1960 he says uh see friends you're thir you have thirst inside of you have you ever tried to satisfy that say well I'll go downtown and buy some new clothes he says that isn't it that's not going to satisfy your thirst maybe you need no new clothes that's leg legitimate he says but when you just make that your idol of how you must listen be so SP and span all the time maybe it's your home maybe it's something else that's taken the place of that thirst and calling it ought to be God God is that satisfying portion do you hear what he said he said you making sure you're clothed you look you he he cleaned up really good tonight I saw him earlier you know he was rubbing those uh those worms on there he was putting the worms on there throwing the fish back in his hands were all dirty he cleans up really good over here I tried to clean up as good as him by God's grace Hallelujah but brother says if you're not careful looking proper and looking nice new clothes he said be can become an idol how do you know when when it when it hurts your walk with God if you're not all looking your best you feel like you're you're lost you feel like you're less than and church I'll say like this if you spend more time looking in the mirror than looking in the Bible something's probably wrong because the bi the Bible said the Bible's a mirror look in the mirror of God's word amen James chapter one amen look in the word the mirror of God's word hallelujah now the sister out in Pennsylvania she said her SPI and span house became an idol and here's what she said before the church on W every Wednesday and every Sunday if the house wasn't SP and span clean she was walking around screaming at her children and her husband this needs to be clean this needs to be clean and what kind of atmosphere did that create before church we're not leaving till this is clean it's got to be SP and span and she comes up to this side of the church crying brother Jesse I have an idol in my life it's SP and span and see when you're late to church then you're not in the you're not in the right the atmosphere to sing to worship to give God praise and the church said and she wept her way to repentance now Church none of us none of us believe in a dirty house none of us believe in dir wearing dirty clothes and holes in them or something like that but it but so but things so simple can become Idols in our life if we're not careful and if that becomes an idol it creates an evil spirit something dies in the home but God's got a solution for us tonight hallelujah amen amen we don't have to let the death stay in the house amen hallelujah is that right pise the Lord hallelujah that's true church this is all true this is what brother BR taught us hallelujah anything can become an idol he said he said your husband can become an idol your wife can become an idol your car can become an idol some of you Brothers your guns might become an idol brothers sisters your your SP and span house can become an idol your general appearance can become an idol anything that takes away from the Lord can become an Idol Hallelujah I'm trying to bring this down to a close bear with me here here here here's an idol I didn't realize I I preached this at our church recently and you know you're a pastor brother Thomas and sometimes you feel the anointing my everybody's in one Accord sometimes you don't and so recently one of these Wednesday nights I was preaching I'm enjoying the preaching I'm like is anybody else hearing anything I'm saying tonight Lord did I miss your mind somehow help me Jesus you just got to press through the sermon sometimes you know people come in tired or you know but I brought up Hebrews 12:15 which says looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of God and a root of bitterness spring up among you yeah and I just I spent maybe one minute on bitterness and bitterness can become an idol it became an idol in one person's life I just shared a brief example of bitterness in my life uh when I was growing up I was 13 years old my mom and dad had six kids I was fourth out of six my dad left my mom with six kids now it was both their faults it was both their fault I I seen it but it was awful for my dad to leave right and so from that moment on you know and I I I I uh I don't know if you knew this but I got into sports I was a state champion in football state champion in track I played football at akan they're division one school it's LeBron james' Hometown I played against Michael Vic Ben rossberger now they whipped us but you know at least we got to play against them you know at least I got to say I got whipped by that guy but as I was going to play football I still had this bitterness against my dad I was 19 years old when I went to college right 19 years old but and in college I started hanging around some Christians because I had no other friends I I knew you know I KN I didn't want to be like these guys at the party so I just I was raised in church so I just gravitated toward these Christian guys and I went to an athletes and action conference and I saw a 6 foot6 offensive lineman from Ohio State named Tim Anderson I saw him raise his hands like this he's a redheaded big guy he was he was like a big Jolly guy you know they won a national championship but I was in the same room with him I was sitting right behind him I saw that guy raise his hands and tears started pouring down my face and I thought shame on me here I'm 19 years old I was raised in church and here's a man bigger than me stronger than me and he's got enough love for God to raise his hands shame on me I'm afraid to worship God and that was the moment I repented of my sins and I became a Christian Hallelujah I went back to my dorm room I was a I went back to my dorm room I took down all my dirty pictures off the wall I took all my Snoop Dog ACDC Tim McGraw I took those CDs you guys don't know what CDs are but I took those CDs and I threw them in the trash amen and I opened up my Bible and I started reading Hallelujah and I came to Matthew 7 and it said not everyone that says to me Lord Lord will enter in the kingdom of God you cast out Devils even though you cast out Devils heal the sick I never knew your workers iniquity I thought oh my but then shortly I'll get back to that but shortly after that we went down to see my dad in Tennessee and I had a hatred for him but before I went down I wrote him a letter and while I'm writing that letter the Holy Spirit came on me I didn't know the message the Holy Spirit came on me I read my Bible and it said Jesus said if you don't forgive those the other people I won't forgive you I started crying I don't even know the message I'm like Dad I forgive you I'm going to come we're going to come pick you up we're going to bring you back home I sent that down there and church as soon as I wrote that I could feel the bitterness lift off my life I mean I hated my dad he wasn't there he wasn't there when I won State he wasn't there when when I broke the records he wasn't there on senior night my mom just walked me across I didn't have a dad for senior night but I did have a Heavenly dad amen he never left me he never forsook me hallelujah amen praise God so we drove down there and I hugged my dad after years of hating him six years of hating him i' felt that rud of bitterness rise up right I felt that evil spirit lead me and I felt clean I'm a brand new Christian I feel like I could walk on the clouds amen I feel like I could tackle Michael Vic although I couldn't amen I felt like it Hallelujah that's right but I felt that root of bitterness and recently we had somebody come up just a few Services ago and said brother Jesse I've been struggled with roots of bitterness towards my family for years we prayed church it was that service I'm like is God ever going to where is God in this service how come there's no anointing as soon as we started praying the Holy Ghost dropped we started weeping and crying praising God worshiping God and she got delivered from that Spirit of bitterness hallelujah praise God amen amen that became an idol and now she can forgive this family member when before she couldn't and then just fast forward one more year my brother Simon heard the message from Craig Boer and Isaiah Brooks he gave me my life story by William brandham I'd never heard brother brandham preach this now this goes back to the cassette tape days you guys don't know what cassette tapes are I was on College you probably do huh I was on college break I was I was a new Christian but I was still chewing tobacco I was still smoking cigarettes I'm a Christian yep Christian and I put brother brandom in the cassette tape Li life story I'm playing Nintendo video games this is uh 200201 and this brother BR starts talking and as he's talking I start forgetting about the game and I just start crying I'm like I have never heard a man preach like this before it the Holy Ghost come on me so powerfully I had just set the Nintendo system down and I I just had to listen to brother brandom and I haven't stopped listening to him since by God's grace Hallelujah there's a voice within the voice hallelujah amen there's the voice within the voice the voice of Christ in brother R's voice and then I heard him preach anointed that ones at the end time and I shouted I said Hallelujah now I understand Matthew 7 hallelujah oh brother AR said the Holy Ghost is the dissolver of all doubt hallelujah oh let me try to close here by God's grace oh I love this message amen glory let me try to close I got all these slides here got if you don't clean out your house Saints you'll be like aen and Eli Kora and Dayan ananas and Safa they let their houses get defiled they let the dead things remain in their house I've talked to other uh children of pastors uh up there in Ohio and they said when they were teenagers it's like the Holy Ghost gave their parents like a special discernment they could almost like sniff out like the worldly music or the cigarettes in their purses and different things like that Hallelujah see God has to give the parents discernment in order to keep the house clean so the spirit of God can move that's right now parents let me give you a little clue when I was a sinner I would go in the bathroom and just say my stomach hurts i' just go in the bathroom and Chew Chew Tobacco or do evil things and I'd lock myself in the bathroom just so you parents if you need any clues when they're spending time alone and doing things you know this little seems a little strange that can be a sign that they're involved in sin Hallelujah so that's a good time to start asking asking questions why are you in those so long or why were you late the other night or what what do you what what you got in there in that bag what why do you smell like this why do you you need to ask questions because that that that that sin can defile the whole house then you wonder why you feel a little different you don't feel as close to God hallelujah that's what the Bible says something can die in the house and everything in the house needs cleaned amen glory thank you Lord this was preached by your Prophet Hallelujah I'm so glad it was I'm so glad it was but there's men that cleaned out their home Jacob Gideon all kinds of Godly men that clean out their houses amen now what I'll do is this here I want to say this brother Ram said I love this quote now let's bring it down home brother said now my Baptist brother I want to ask you something if justification is all that God requires I'd like to ask you this now he's talking about elaser and the Waters of Separation when the man was separated By the Waters of Separation sprinkled then he could not enter in the worship of the glory the lord he could not do it okay it's because he was only sprinkled from his sins it's separated from his sins but it did not put him into Fellowship Hallelujah so brother said when a man sins he couldn't even get to the outer court because he needed to be sprinkled and what does brother R say a Baptist person believes in baptism they believe in the cross and the church said yeah who's ever been to a Baptist Church before don't don't they preach the blood of Jesus don't they yes brother say the Baptist says I just got to be saved that's all I got to do brother Ram says no this show you you got to go deeper in if you if you don't conf any sin you can't even go into the first court if you live in sin and don't clear out the idols in your life you can't go to the first Court well if you can't go to the first court you ain't getting to the second court and if you don't get to the second Court brother says you're not getting into fellowship with God in the holy of holies does everybody see that what an amazing revelation God gave to brother Bram I haven't heard any other preachers preach this it was a prophetic Revelation Hallelujah I believe it was finishing the mystery of God hallelujah the mystery of godliness becoming like God hallelujah that's how you become like God outer Court inner Court holiest of holies how many believe that so brother Ram says you got to go all the way in you got to go into the holiest of holies if you want to have fellowship with God how do we know because you ask a b you ask a Baptist can a woman cut her hair they'll say of course she can cut her hair that was an Old Testament custom but if that preacher would have went into the Holi of holies God would have told him the Bible says a man NE a woman never cuts her hair is that right brother Hallelujah he would have got thus say the Lord he would had fellowship with God if he would have went into the holiest of holies praise God that's right uh how should we be baptized Baptist preacher oh Father Son Holy Ghost is all right that proves he never went to the holy of holies CU God will say keep reading the book of Acts there's five baptisms and every time they are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen there's power in one name Hallelujah is that right now let me bring this down to us I saw a lot of hands earlier that said you're born again and I say hallelujah to that but brother brother I this Revelation came to me in 2 2017 I'd already been pastoring for 11 years and brother I'd Wonder many times as a pastor I'd sit in my study and think how can these people no not not many just a few how can these few people come to church they never cry they never shout like me they never spit like me they never scream like me they never dance like me they don't clap they don't speak in tongues they don't pray for the sick they just stare at me all the time how can someone come to this church this long and they sit there like that and then God showed me this see where I'm going they can come to a message Church they can physically come into the church but spiritually they're not even in the church because something died in their home that's right and spiritual death has settled over that person's life many times with men it's pornography right or bitterness towards their wives right and so if that sin is unconfessed death has covered them and they come to church and you can't move them you preach the word of God doesn't move them something's wrong with that God showed me that that's why people and I found out later in our church that's what the problem was unconfessed sin imagine you're a Jew brother said somebody died in your house you got to go to the priest he sprinkles you with the water of Separation sprinkle Hallelujah you wait seven days now you can go to church those Brothers say welcome back to church you're all clean come on in oh I see you got your Lamb with you for a sin offering yes I do I sin but God for God's going to forgive me I'm going to sacrifice this and you walk into church and what's the first place you go to the Brazen altar you say priest here's my spotless lamb this is the one this is the one that's real special to me this was the most beautiful of all of them and I have to have this killed because I mistreated my wife that's a sin offering I sinned against my wife and can you imagine if that's your favorite lamb how about your favorite you know you you put your favorite animal in there and you've got to watch that animal cut it and it bleeds out that would mean something to you this died for me see now now the shedding of blood it becomes a more dear thing oh thank God I can be forgiven now now now it means something but you know how most people went to church in Jews days they just took their Beth slam there it is ah they were checking their smartphones in their days too yeah all right just get it over with come on priest I got to get to work come on man what are you waiting for see the blood didn't move him anymore are you with me church are you with me that's right and that's why we can preach about the blood of Jesus Christ we can study and we'll weep and cry as God shows us scriptures about the blood and the cross it'll never lose its power Hallelujah but then for so many people the blood has lost its power but the Bible said it can never lose its power why is it ineffective anymore because something's done but let me tell you you can be clean Hallelujah let's end our may God help us not to be people that come to church with d things in our homes and the blood doesn't even move us anymore the wash after that they had to wash in the labor but said that's the washing of the Waters of the word also ties water baptism some new person gets baptized oh big deal I can't make the baptism I don't care what happened this used to be so Wonder wonderful it it could have been your child it could have been you and you can't feel this anymore what happened you've been spiritually cut off you're cut off you can't come into even the outer Court even the even the baptism even the cross doesn't move you anymore and if that doesn't move you when you get in the Holy place the the Candlestick the church ages you can you can preach a hundred sermons on the Ephesian Church age it never move these people cuz they're they got dead stuff all over their house you could preach all seven Church ages you could do that and it doesn't move people anymore they don't want to go listen to they don't want to do this or that because something is died in their house no wonder they don't pray anymore that's the altar of incense that was the last thing before the holiest of holies no wonder they can't even hear from God they're not they're cut off they're not going in in there to the holiest of holies they don't know the will of God for how many children I should have where I should move what job I should have they don't have th sayith the Lord because they're not in fellowship with God because they're fellowshipping with dead things they're fellowshipping with dead things that's right and so God has to cut them off until they come God's provided way Hallelujah glory to God glory to God thank you Lord Jesus God help us to come to church and it means something to us where someone can read a scripture about the blood of Jesus Christ and say that's for me that's what I needed Hallelujah I believe that praise God I am saved I am filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I do eat fresh shoe bread every service it never gets stale how can God's bread get stale Hallelujah God's bread cannot get stale Hallelujah but you think it's stale it's impossible it's because you you've let something die in your house that's right and you're cut off Hallelujah has it been made clear tonight by God's grace let's bow our heads musicians can come brother Brandon played I surrender all I believe it's the 1961 the base of Fellowship you could play that I surrender all let's take a serious look at our lives some of you do look serious I appreciate that hallelujah praise God we can't get in the habit of the word not moving us Paul said we should be renewed day by day let's say day by day can we day by day today today you can be renewed he said be renewed in the spirit of your mind Hallelujah Glory we don't have to leave here with a defiled [Music] conscience you know what you need you need a sprinkling that's what you need you know what I need when I fall short I need a sprinkling it's in the New Testament 1 Peter 1 verse2 said sprinkling unto The Obedience of the Holy Spirit now I'm I'm switching that up unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ I always wonder brother why does a why does Peter talk about sprinkling because it's the type of the Waters of separation and if anybody needed the sprinkling it was Peter all his mistakes he made every time he come back to Jesus Jesus was spiritually sprinkle you're forgiven you're forgiven I forgive you come back to worship come back to my presence while they're playing that would anybody be honest tonight and say brother Jesse I I need to get back in fellowship with God would anybody be honest and say that tonight God bless those hands bless that hand bless that hand go bless that hand God sees that hand God sees that hand God sees that [Music] hand I'm going to say a general General prayer for everybody and then after that if you need special prayer you're more than welcome to come up to the front now if your hand was up you be sincere now imagine if something died there's a dead carcass in your house how you would try to clean that up oh my goodness if there was a dead animal or something dead in my house I do everything to clean it up I don't want that stinking rotting thing I don't want this rotten thing in my house it smells oh God help me to clean out my [Music] house now what did what did Brother Ram say first John 1:8 if you confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive you of all unrighteousness and then if you Sinn against somebody go tell them sorry right after service if it's between you and God you better rebuke Satan tonight so you don't do it again whatever it might be I've had to do that different times in my life I've had to just say it out loud I rebuke you Satan right in my house and guess what church he leaves how many believe that there's power of life in the tongue Hallelujah we have power to bind and loose demons Hallelujah if you've ever been sincere be sincere now Hallelujah God didn't send me 7 hours that's just miles in the car God I'm sorry seven hours God didn't send me seven hours in the car just to make this a ineffective meeting brother man said a protracted meeting God sent me here to preach the word amen it's the only thing that can pop up your life amen it's the only thing that can clean out your life I know I'm a preacher I know it I have to apply this to my life too let's pray a g General prayer father God in the name of Jesus Christ I know you love me I know you love this church Lord God I know you love the pastor Lord God you Prov it to me time and time again you love me God and I know you love me the Bible said you proved it when you sent your son Jesus to die on the cross Hallelujah God commendeth his love to us why we were yet sinners Christ died the righteous for the unrighteous hallelujah oh God lord we want to be moved by the Holy Spirit we want the outer Court to mean something the preaching of the blood the power of water baptism the power of washing with the word God we want the church ages to mean something the shoe bread brother said to reveal Mysteries and prayer we want prayer to mean something so it can take us into the presence of God so we can know thus sayi the Lord about our marriages or our jobs our children oh God hallelujah oh God we want to know thus say the Lord we want to have fellowship with you God I want it with you Lord God Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus thank you Lord God lord look at the hearts tonight you saw each and every hand that went up you saw the hands that they couldn't even raise it up they're probably so guilty but Lord may they remember there's blood Hallelujah there's blood for them tonight to set them free from all guilt and shame hallelujah thank you Lord there's a sprinkling tonight that they can be sprinkled of and be clean through the power of God lord I pray God now may each person Saints listen Lord May each person confess their sin now Lord may they confess the death that they may have allowed in their lives and they're they're sorry for it they're guilty of it Lord hear their prayer right [Music] now Hallelujah Grant it Lord [Music] God lord Jesus help them Lord now if they got to go confess to somebody or they got to change something in their home give them Grace to do it tonight while there's still an opportunity Hallelujah while the presence of God is dealing with them Hallelujah so they can come back tomorrow and they can feel the the power of the word the sincerity of the blood the sincerity of the washing of the word the sincerity of a real sacrifice Hallelujah God make it new again Lord God renew our faith Lord God renew our vision Lord God renew our [Music] minds Lord you saw every hand forgive them Lord as they confess they have to say sorry I believe
