[11:20] I'd

[24:18] may hide the light of day.
[24:23] The midst of sin may rise and hide the
[24:27] starry skies, but just a little talk
[24:31] with Jesus clears the
[24:34] way. Well, let
[24:38] us let
[24:41] us well he
[24:44] will and he will answer by and by. Now
[24:48] when you feel a little prayer will turn

[33:30] heart
[33:32] coming
[33:34] from the
[33:38] blue.
[33:40] Somebody up
[33:43] there loves me, dear Lord.
[33:49] That
[33:50] somebody is

[35:20] you man. Let's stand tonight if we could

[35:29] comes tonight. Fill my cup, Lord.
[35:32] Would you enjoy the service this

[36:25] sing that.
[36:27] Oh, fill my
[36:29] heart. Come and
[36:33] quit. Amen. Amen. I just want to say one
[36:37] thing before we get started this
[36:39] morning. I wasn't trying to tell you
[36:42] married folks how to live or anything
[36:43] like that. That would just make an
[36:45] example of what our human love can do
[36:48] when we let it interfere with our
[36:49] relationship. So, um yeah, I don't know
[36:53] anything about being married, so
[36:55] ignore that part. But we get our
[36:58] emotions involved and our feelings hurt
[37:01] and it just messes up makes call
[37:03] dissension and stuff instead of just
[37:04] letting it go. What if someone does what
[37:07] if someone does insult you? What if they
[37:09] do disrespect you? What if they don't
[37:11] appreciate you? Well, stand in Jesus
[37:15] shoes.
[37:17] All right. How did he how did he react
[37:19] when they did that to him? And there is
[37:22] freedom when you can do that. when
[37:24] you're not controlled by your emotions.
[37:26] Amen. Amen. Lord Jesus, we're grateful
[37:29] that we can come back again. Father,
[37:31] what a wonderful day we've had so far.
[37:33] Father, I just ask that you would come
[37:35] and just bless us one more time now this
[37:37] afternoon, Lord. And just speak to each
[37:39] heart, Father. Let each person hear from
[37:41] you personally. Let each person know
[37:42] that you love them, you care for them,
[37:44] you never disrespect them, you never
[37:46] take them for granted. You, Lord Jesus,
[37:49] we do you all the time, but you don't do
[37:50] that for us. And so Lord, help us, Lord,
[37:52] to recognize you more and more than ever
[37:55] before, Lord. And just to walk with you
[37:57] as as you would as you would lead us,
[38:00] Father, we ask you take this word, Lord,
[38:02] and make it real. Ask this in your name,
[38:04] Lord Jesus. Amen. I want to read out of
[38:07] John
[38:09] 3. Most of you could probably quote
[38:11] this, but we're going to go ahead and
[38:12] read it just to make a couple points.
[38:14] John 3, we're going to start at verse
[38:15] three. Go down about verse eight.
[38:19] The second part of speaking on the
[38:20] spirit of liberty.
[38:27] Amen. John 3 and verse3 it says Jesus
[38:30] answer said unto him verily verily I say
[38:32] unto you except a man be born again he
[38:34] cannot see the kingdom of God. We know
[38:36] that word see is not to see with your
[38:38] eyes but to understand. Like like be
[38:40] saying brother Caleb people it it's a
[38:42] secret. Until you've been born again you
[38:44] really don't know what it is to be born
[38:45] again. You don't know. You have an idea.
[38:48] I know I had all kinds of ideas about
[38:50] what it was to be born again and I
[38:52] expected God to to do this birth in a
[38:54] certain way and he said, "No, I'm going
[38:55] to do it the way I want to." And as long
[38:57] as you're looking for it the way you
[38:58] think it's going to come, it's not going
[39:00] to come. And so, you got to lay down
[39:01] your own stuff and accept it the way it
[39:03] is. So, in order to to understand the
[39:06] kingdom of God, we must be born again.
[39:08] Go ahead and have a seat because it's
[39:10] going to take forever. Go ahead. Verse
[39:12] four. Nicodemus said unto him, "How can
[39:13] a man be born when he is old? Can he
[39:15] enter into the second time into his
[39:17] mother womb be born? And Jesus said,
[39:18] "Verily I say to you, except a man be
[39:20] born of water and of spirit. He cannot
[39:22] enter into the kingdom of God. That
[39:24] which is born of the spirit is flesh.
[39:25] That which is born of this uh born of
[39:28] this flesh is flesh. That was born of
[39:29] the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I
[39:31] say unto thee, you must be born again."
[39:33] Now, this is what I want to get to. The
[39:35] wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
[39:37] hearest the sound thereof, but cannot
[39:39] tell when it came from and wherether it
[39:41] goes. see the freedom of it. You don't
[39:45] control the spirit, friends. Yeah. You
[39:48] don't control the spirit. And when we
[39:49] try, we find ourselves in a bad place.
[39:52] But then listen what he said. He said,
[39:53] "So is everyone that is born of the
[39:56] spirit."
[39:59] He said, "If you are born of the spirit,
[40:01] that spirit comes and it goes. You don't
[40:03] control it. It's just controls you and
[40:05] it goes where it wants. And it's not for
[40:07] us to try and like I'm going to hold on
[40:08] to that." He takes you and he moves you
[40:10] by the spirit and he controls you. And
[40:12] you don't know where you're coming from
[40:13] or where you're going, but you just know
[40:15] that you're being led by the spirit.
[40:18] Amen. So, this is that spirit of liberty
[40:22] we're talking about. It's the Holy
[40:23] Spirit. And so, the question is now it's
[40:25] a spirit of liberty. We look this
[40:26] morning at what can happen when we're
[40:28] not subject to the spirit of liberty.
[40:30] But what happens when we are liberty to
[40:33] do what? What are we free to do when we
[40:36] are born again? We're free to live holy.
[40:39] We are free to live above condemnation.
[40:41] To overcome the things of the world that
[40:43] live without a burden of guilt. You ever
[40:45] carry a burden of guilt? Have that thing
[40:48] dropped off you? That is freedom,
[40:50] brother and sister. There is no liberty
[40:52] like having that freedom gone. Freedom
[40:53] to live above fear. Freedom to live
[40:55] above our own self, not controlled by
[40:57] our own mess. And this is what it is.
[40:59] It's freedom to be what God wants us to
[41:01] be because he wants to express himself
[41:03] through us. And if we would just let
[41:05] him. Yeah. Oh, I want more of God. He
[41:08] says, I want more of you, but you got to
[41:09] let me. I cannot live more in you until
[41:13] you get rid of that old self, that old
[41:14] nature, those things you love so much
[41:16] that are your comfort. I Let me be your
[41:19] comfort. I will be the comfort more than
[41:22] this world can ever provide. But why
[41:24] don't we do it? Because we don't trust
[41:26] him. Why? Because it can hurt.
[41:30] I did I say can hurt? That's wrong. It
[41:33] will hurt cuz it hurts us. Oh, nature.
[41:36] It hurts us. Oh, this stuff that we have
[41:39] to give up. It's painful. But oh, the
[41:42] reward when you do. You enter a place of
[41:45] freedom that the world can only like
[41:47] it's a fantasy. You know, the best they
[41:49] can do is go get high on some kind of
[41:51] drug and try and find that way. But you
[41:53] and I, we have an everlasting eternal
[41:55] drug. It's called the Holy
[41:56] Spirit. It sure is. You know what else
[41:59] it gets you allows us to be free to do
[42:01] is to keep God's commandments.
[42:04] That's right. Now, here's the problem.
[42:05] You say, "Wait a minute. If you're made
[42:08] to follow these rules, how is that
[42:11] freedom?" Because when you start saying
[42:13] commandments and keeping the law, right
[42:15] away, people just tighten up like, "Oh
[42:17] my, here we go getting legalistic."
[42:21] Well, let's look at what the
[42:22] commandments are. If you want to turn to
[42:24] Matthew 22, what is Jesus commandments
[42:27] to us?
[42:29] 22:36 Master, which is the great
[42:32] commandment in the law? Jesus said unto
[42:34] him, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[42:36] with all thy heart, with all thy soul,
[42:38] with all thy mind." This is the first
[42:40] and great commandment, and the second is
[42:42] like unto it. "Thou shalt love thy
[42:43] neighbor as thyself." Amen. Follow the
[42:47] rule.
[42:48] There's the rule he wants you to follow.
[42:50] Can you love? Oh, he didn't say anything
[42:53] about wearing your hair right, dressing
[42:54] right, doing all these, you know, living
[42:56] a holy life. No, he didn't say that. But
[42:58] he said, "On these two commandments hang
[43:01] all the law and the prophets." What's he
[43:03] saying? You get those two right. Yeah.
[43:05] And the rest falls into place. You get
[43:08] those two right. Love the Lord with all
[43:10] your heart and love your neighbor like
[43:12] yourself and the rest of it is going to
[43:14] fall in place and you're going to be
[43:15] free to fulfill the law.
[43:18] Not in your own strength.
[43:21] In Mark, he's talking about this. He
[43:22] says, "There is none other commandment
[43:24] greater than these." These are the two
[43:26] great commandments is to love. His
[43:28] commandment to you and I are to love. If
[43:30] you can follow that rule, you're going
[43:32] to be in a good place.
[43:34] It's not a legalism. Well, I got to do
[43:36] what God tells me to do. I got to do
[43:38] this. I got See, see, once you get the
[43:40] love of God in your heart like that, you
[43:42] time you find pleasure in following
[43:44] these rules. You you find freedom in
[43:47] following these rules because you just
[43:48] your nature wants to do it. Come on.
[43:52] Because otherwise you are you are
[43:53] grieving the Holy Spirit. And what is
[43:56] worse thing to do in your life than to
[43:58] grieve the Holy Spirit? I will grieve
[44:00] all of you a thousand times over more
[44:02] than I want to grieve the Holy Spirit
[44:04] because I can live without you, but I
[44:05] can't live without him.
[44:08] Oh, when we get to that point, brother
[44:09] and sister, we'll stop looking at, well,
[44:11] what do I want? What is my feelings? No,
[44:14] I don't care about this. I want to know
[44:15] what God wants from me because I need to
[44:17] please him.
[44:21] That's right.
[44:23] Go to John 15 starting at verse 9. Let
[44:25] me read a lot of scripture tonight if
[44:27] that's okay. I know it is because you
[44:28] love the Bible.
[44:31] 159. John 59. As the father hath loved
[44:33] me, so have I loved you. Continue in my
[44:36] love. So right away he says, "As the
[44:38] father loved him." That's agape love,
[44:40] right?
[44:42] So I have loved you. He said, "I have
[44:44] loved you the same way with agape." He
[44:46] said, "Continue in my agape." Continue
[44:49] in it. If you keep my
[44:53] commandments, what was his
[44:55] commandment? Love. If you will love, you
[44:59] shall abide in my love. That means you
[45:02] will remain in his love. If you will
[45:04] love, I you will remain in my love. Keep
[45:06] my commandments. Even I have as I have
[45:08] kept my father's commandments and abide
[45:10] in his love. So just the same way that
[45:13] Jesus abide in the father's love, you
[45:15] and I can abide in his love if we keep
[45:17] his commandments, which is simply to
[45:19] love.
[45:21] That's all. Lord, it's all it is. It's
[45:25] don't have to live holy. Friends, get
[45:27] this in your heart and you will live
[45:29] holy because you can't stand not to.
[45:33] You can't help it. It's something
[45:34] inside. Yeah. Oh, I know. You know what
[45:37] I'm talking about. It's something inside
[45:39] that you're not controlling. You're not
[45:40] trying to. It just is there and you
[45:43] can't help it.
[45:45] Let me go back to that that that that
[45:47] the the
[45:48] examp take take a sheep, put him out and
[45:50] say, "Now you got hay over you got a
[45:52] falfa over here. You got a pig pen over
[45:54] there. What do you want? What's his
[45:56] nature?" He might say, "Well, let me go.
[45:58] My friends, my friend pigs are over
[46:00] here. Let me go hang out with my friend
[46:02] pigs for a while." And he gets in there
[46:03] and he starts like, "This is nasty."
[46:07] And he walks over here. Let me hang out
[46:09] in the hay field. Let me get the alalfa.
[46:11] Why? Cuz his nature can't help it. He
[46:14] can't help it. That's what he is by
[46:16] nature. And he get some of his friends.
[46:18] You need to come to church with me. His
[46:20] little piglet friends, let's go to
[46:21] church over. You got to see this. This
[46:23] this alalfa is amazing. And the little
[46:26] piglets go over there and they
[46:28] go, "Oh, this is nasty. Who you are?
[46:31] This is so boring. Who wants to go to
[46:33] church?" And you're over there going,
[46:34] "Oh, I'm having the time of my life."
[46:36] And they're over here saying, "Oh, I'm
[46:38] having the time of life." And they're
[46:40] both right. But it's your nature.
[46:44] When you get a new nature, you can't
[46:46] help what you love. Oh, hallelujah. You
[46:49] can't help but love Jesus. You can't
[46:51] help but love your brothers. And you
[46:53] can't help but love your enemies.
[46:56] Hallelujah.
[46:58] You can't help it. All you need is a
[47:01] nature. He said, "Except you be born
[47:03] again." And let me say it right now. If
[47:05] you're not born again there right now,
[47:07] you have no clue what I'm talking about.
[47:11] But if you are born again, you say,
[47:13] "Amen." Cuz I know I'm experiencing this
[47:17] what you're saying.
[47:21] You say, "Well, but brother Phil,
[47:23] sometime but sometime not." And I just
[47:25] feel like, well, of
[47:27] course it ain't a picnic is a battle.
[47:31] You going to fight this day and night.
[47:33] But brother and sister, isn't it great
[47:35] when you see someone who's been walking
[47:37] with the Lord for years and you look
[47:40] what they were 20 or 30 years ago, you
[47:42] look what they are now.
[47:44] My, what a soldier of the cross. Look at
[47:48] the difference in their life. I used to
[47:51] I used that person that they used to be
[47:53] so prickly. They used to have so, you
[47:55] know, this was going on and and they
[47:56] were just in and out and whatever and
[47:58] now they're just so anchored.
[48:02] Yeah. Ain't that awesome?
[48:04] And it is it worse than to anything else
[48:07] when you see someone's been following
[48:08] the Lord 30 or 40 years and they're
[48:10] still prickly.
[48:13] They still are that same old nature.
[48:16] Religious is Satan himself. Oh, Satan's
[48:19] religion. Religious friends. Religious
[48:21] as can be and following all the rules.
[48:24] But you see, there's never been a
[48:25] change.
[48:27] Oh, man. That just rips you up. I You
[48:30] know who it rips up the most? tears you
[48:32] up is the man sitting right here because
[48:34] he said, "I've been preaching for this
[48:35] person for years and I'm still not
[48:37] seeing a difference." Now that he No,
[48:40] no, that's nobody in here. All right,
[48:42] I'm just talking for examples again.
[48:45] Quit giving examples.
[48:50] Verse 11, 1511. These things have I
[48:53] spoken unto you that my joy might remain
[48:55] in you, that your joy might be full. Let
[48:57] me go back a little bit. It says to
[48:58] abide in that. that means to remain in
[49:00] fellowship with Christ. So, let's say
[49:02] that you you don't love you're not
[49:04] keeping the commandments and and you're
[49:05] struggling with things. Does that mean
[49:07] that God don't love you? Well, of course
[49:09] not. It just means that your fellowship
[49:11] is broken, right? But when you look at
[49:13] like the the prodigal son, he left home
[49:16] and he went he broke fellowship with the
[49:18] father. Did the father quit loving him?
[49:20] No, he did not. And he was waiting there
[49:22] and you know where the father was that
[49:24] whole time he was sitting on the front
[49:25] porch. He said, "Bring me my lunch out
[49:28] here. bring me something to drink. Why?
[49:30] Because I'm watching down the road
[49:31] because I know sooner or later my son's
[49:34] going to come back because he's part of
[49:36] me and he's going to abide with
[49:38] me. He says, I know his nature. I know
[49:41] what's inside of him and I'm going to
[49:43] stand here. And when he starts coming
[49:45] back, you know why he didn't do? He
[49:46] didn't say, "Well, it's about time you
[49:48] come back. You need to do some holiness
[49:50] before I start fellowship with you
[49:52] again." No, he didn't. He jumped off
[49:54] that porch. He sprinted down the road.
[49:55] He says, "He's back. He's back. As soon
[49:58] as you want to come back, you are back.
[50:00] You say, "I'm sinning. I'm having a
[50:02] problem." As soon as you want to come
[50:04] back, you are back right then.
[50:08] You don't have to go through some kind
[50:10] of penance. You don't have to go, "I got
[50:12] I'm so sorry." And all, "Oh, yeah,
[50:14] you'll do that anyways because you want
[50:15] to make everything right from your it's
[50:18] going to come from your heart." But
[50:19] brother and sister, in God's eyes,
[50:21] you're back already. Amen.
[50:26] Verse 12. This is my commandment that
[50:28] you love one another as I have loved
[50:30] you. That's agape. He said, I command
[50:32] you to agape each other the way I have
[50:35] agape you.
[50:38] You don't do that with human love. Human
[50:41] love can get you so far, but it will
[50:43] fail. It will not be consistent because
[50:45] sooner or later there's going to be
[50:47] someone something about that person that
[50:49] you just it just starts irritating you.
[50:52] It starts grading on you and you might
[50:54] have thought that was the best person,
[50:55] the nicest person. Oh, I'm gonna get in
[50:57] trouble. Yeah, that that that young
[50:59] woman that you married and she was
[51:01] perfect and there's nothing about her.
[51:03] Oh, you just like, oh, you know how I'm
[51:06] talking about. And then you go living
[51:08] with her for a while and you say, "Oh my
[51:09] goodness, where'd this come from?"
[51:12] You know what will run out? Human love.
[51:17] What keeps you there?
[51:21] something greater.
[51:24] And he talks about here verse 13,
[51:26] greater love hath no man than
[51:29] this that a man lay down his life for
[51:32] his
[51:32] friends. You said I have to
[51:35] die? Not
[51:37] physically. You know where you die. See,
[51:39] see people say, "Well, you know, I go
[51:41] and die for, you know, some a b a bear
[51:43] is going to kill brother Thomas and I
[51:44] run in there and I wrestle the bear and
[51:46] he kills me and Thomas is saved." Well,
[51:49] I'm not going to wrestle
[51:51] bear. That's not what he's talking
[51:53] about. This is talking about when
[51:55] there's that contention between
[51:57] us and I die to myself. I lay down my
[52:02] life
[52:04] and keep that contention out of there.
[52:07] Easily intreated.
[52:09] We can do this on a daily basis. You can
[52:11] lay down your life while you agape them.
[52:13] You know what it means? You know how you
[52:14] got someone? You love them. You want
[52:16] what's best for them. You do what's best
[52:19] for them. It doesn't matter how it makes
[52:21] me feel. What do you need from me?
[52:24] That's what it means to lay down your
[52:26] life. That's agape love for someone.
[52:28] This person needs me to tell them the
[52:29] truth. It's going to hurt their
[52:30] feelings. I'm going to feel terrible,
[52:32] but I'm going to do it because that's
[52:33] what they need. This is a way when you
[52:35] when you discipline your kids. I sure
[52:38] hope you never enjoyed spanking your
[52:40] kids,
[52:45] but you do it anyways.
[52:47] Why? because of love. That's what they
[52:49] need.
[52:53] You lay down your life how you feel
[52:55] this. I don't want to do this. I don't
[52:57] want to do this. But you do it anyways
[52:59] because it's what that person needs.
[53:01] That's how you lay down your life. In
[53:03] verse 14, ye are my friends if you do
[53:04] whatsoever I command you. Why did he
[53:07] command
[53:09] us?
[53:10] Love. In verse 17, these things I
[53:13] command you that you love one another.
[53:15] He said it over and over. My command is
[53:17] love. And yet when we get especially
[53:19] around young people, they're always
[53:21] asking, "Is it okay to do this? Is it
[53:23] okay to do that? Can we do this? Can we
[53:25] do that?" And you know, is it sin or
[53:26] it's not sin? Because some people allow
[53:28] this and some people
[53:29] don't. That's the wrong questions.
[53:33] Get love and then you don't those things
[53:35] will fall into place. It doesn't even
[53:36] matter. You don't care anyways except
[53:38] what God wants you to do. Yeah. It's
[53:41] just about doing what God wants because
[53:43] your love for God, you love him more
[53:45] than anything else. And then it's just
[53:47] like everything he does and he's
[53:48] perfect. He doesn't make mistakes. And
[53:50] now you can trust him and you can love
[53:52] him. That's
[53:54] freedom. Otherwise, being a message
[53:57] believer is just following some rules.
[53:59] Live holy enough. Be a good person.
[54:05] Friends, this is greater than human love
[54:07] can produce. It can do it for a second.
[54:09] It can do it for a minute, maybe for a
[54:11] week or two, but consistently your human
[54:14] love will run out. It's not enough
[54:16] because if it was enough, we would not
[54:18] have need Jesus Christ because the law
[54:21] would have produced it. But no matter
[54:23] how sincere those Jews were following
[54:24] that law and they love the law, they
[54:26] started loving the law of their religion
[54:28] more than they love Jehovah God. And
[54:30] what did it do? It produced all the
[54:32] idolatry and everything that was there
[54:34] because human love cannot consistently
[54:36] keep you in love with God the way that
[54:38] he requires.
[54:42] It demands a return. It demands
[54:46] reciprocation. It's based on emotions.
[54:49] It gets us feelings hurt so easy. It's
[54:51] so easy to hold a
[54:53] grudge. This is the best it can do. And
[54:56] it's so hard to trust someone who's
[54:59] going to allow you to be
[55:02] hurt. And God will allow you to be
[55:08] hurt. Amen.
[55:11] I was talking to the the a sister here a
[55:13] long time
[55:14] ago and she had lost a loved
[55:18] one and it tore her up really bad and
[55:21] she said, "How can I trust God anymore
[55:23] if he allows this to
[55:26] happen?" That's a
[55:28] very human love
[55:32] approach because what if she didn't have
[55:35] God and it
[55:36] happened? Then what has she got? She's
[55:38] got nothing.
[55:43] Do you trust him no matter what?
[55:46] It's a hard, you know, it's easy to say
[55:48] yes. Look, look at the prophet. The
[55:49] prophet sitting there watching his
[55:51] little girl die. And Satan came up and
[55:53] started giving him a hard time. And he
[55:55] was said, I was ready to say, well, if
[55:57] that's the way you're going to treat me,
[55:59] forget it. And what came out of his
[56:03] mouth? The Lord giveth and the Lord
[56:05] taketh away. Blessed be the name of the
[56:07] Lord. He did not consciously start
[56:09] saying that that's just what comes from
[56:10] that nature that was birthed in there.
[56:14] That's trust. That's what love will
[56:16] produce. Try doing that in your own
[56:19] ability once.
[56:21] You'll feel fail miserably.
[56:26] So then if we can't do it, is God asking
[56:28] when Jesus said he said love this way?
[56:31] You got to love keep the commandments.
[56:32] But then you can't do it. So he's asking
[56:34] us to do something that's impossible.
[56:37] He's asking us to do something that we
[56:40] can't do. Oh friends, the sooner you let
[56:43] that sink into your heart and recognize
[56:45] you cannot please God in your flesh. You
[56:48] cannot live holy in your flesh. You
[56:50] cannot love correctly in your flesh.
[56:52] It's got to be the Holy Spirit inside of
[56:55] you doing it. And as long as we keep
[56:57] trying, God takes his hands off says,
[56:59] "Keep trying. Keep failing. Keep
[57:02] failing. Keep failing because sooner or
[57:04] later you're going to hit rock bottom."
[57:06] And all you can do is look up and say,
[57:07] "God, if you don't save me, I'm lost."
[57:09] He said, "Now you finally figured it
[57:11] out."
[57:14] Yes, he will, friend. Because he's
[57:16] saying, "You can't do this. That's why I
[57:18] went to Calvary. That's why I did what I
[57:20] did. That's why I suffered and all that.
[57:23] So that I could bring you to that place
[57:25] where you can fulfill my law, which is
[57:27] to love correctly." Yes.
[57:31] Oh, so many times Satan will get in
[57:33] there. He'll get into our religion and
[57:35] start, well, I, you know, I need to do
[57:36] this a little more. I need to quit doing
[57:38] that a little more. And I need to love.
[57:39] You ever go and try to love people? Have
[57:41] you ever I've done that. Well, I'm going
[57:42] to start loving people. Huh? About 30
[57:46] minutes and I'm
[57:47] done. People are hard to love.
[57:51] They are. Otherwise, he would have said
[57:54] these things. If it was easy to do,
[57:56] everyone could do it. But we can't.
[58:02] 1 John 4 verse
[58:11] 7. Beloved, let us agape one another.
[58:15] For agape is of God, and everyone that
[58:17] agapeth is born of God and knoweth God.
[58:20] This is not filio love. Some people say,
[58:22] "Well, I love so I'm born of God." No,
[58:24] that's not what it's talking about. You
[58:26] can have all kinds of human love and not
[58:28] know a coup about God.
[58:31] He that agape not knoweth not God. For
[58:33] God is love. So, well, I don't have any
[58:35] agopy love. You don't know God.
[58:37] That means you're not born again. That's
[58:39] right. He said, "Well, I don't see it
[58:41] very often." Well, that's not the
[58:42] problem. I mean, that is a problem, but
[58:44] that's not what I'm saying for because
[58:46] especially as you as you're born again,
[58:47] if you're young in the Lord, you're
[58:49] going to it's not going to express
[58:51] himself as much because you got to go
[58:52] through the whole growing process. You
[58:54] have to grow into the stature of a
[58:56] perfect man. And that comes over time.
[59:00] You're you're not you're a baby and that
[59:01] that baby is born. He don't know how to
[59:03] talk. He don't know how to walk. He you
[59:05] grow into it. So don't get discouraged
[59:07] when you say, "Well, I've struggled with
[59:08] this. I really have a problem with this
[59:10] and I'm not loving the way it should."
[59:11] And these things that you're saying
[59:12] about it comes natural. It just don't
[59:14] come natural to me. Don't worry, little
[59:16] baby. You'll grow up. I'm not calling
[59:18] you babies. I'm saying just let's keep
[59:19] growing.
[59:21] And anyone who stands up and says,
[59:23] "Well, I've already there, Brother Phil.
[59:24] I got it." You need to be born again.
[59:27] You're deceived
[59:29] because you're saying, "I got all God
[59:31] there is to have." That's what
[59:32] denominations say. I got all God there
[59:34] is. There's no more God to have. If you
[59:36] get to that point, your love is not even
[59:38] close to where it's supposed to be.
[59:39] Because when you love God the way you
[59:41] should, just like you love, all you want
[59:42] is more and you can never, you know,
[59:44] you're satisfied, but yet there's a
[59:46] thirst for more all the time.
[59:49] Oh yeah, you know what I'm talking
[59:51] about.
[59:53] Verse nine. And this was manifested the
[59:54] love of God towards us because that God
[59:56] sent his only begotten son into the
[59:58] world that we might live through
[59:59] him. We might live through him, not in
[1:00:02] our own self, but through him
[1:00:05] here in his love. Not that we love God,
[1:00:08] but that he loved us. And he sent his
[1:00:10] son to be propitiation for our sins.
[1:00:16] I don't know if God loves me or
[1:00:19] not.
[1:00:21] Okay. Well, I don't know what to say.
[1:00:25] He's given
[1:00:27] us this. He tells us how much he loved
[1:00:30] us.
[1:00:31] If you say, "I don't know if God loves
[1:00:33] me." Guess who you're listening to.
[1:00:36] You're preaching. When you say that,
[1:00:37] you're preaching Satan's gospel. You're
[1:00:40] giving glorifi You're glorifying Satan.
[1:00:44] Don't do that.
[1:00:46] Don't do that, friends. Glorify God. I
[1:00:48] don't care how you're feeling. I don't
[1:00:49] care how miserable you are. I don't care
[1:00:51] what the doctor said. You walk out there
[1:00:53] fearlessly. And you say, "But God is
[1:00:56] still my keeper. God is still my savior.
[1:00:59] And if God sends me to hell, I'm going
[1:01:01] to still love him." Because if that's
[1:01:02] his perfect will, you say, "I can't do
[1:01:04] that." Oh, no. No. In your in your human
[1:01:06] love, you can't. But that's what the
[1:01:08] prophet said perfect love will do. He
[1:01:10] said, "If God will send me to hell with
[1:01:12] this spirit, I'm gonna still love him
[1:01:14] anyways." That's right. Try doing that
[1:01:16] in your human love.
[1:01:18] Impossible.
[1:01:20] Can I say something further?
[1:01:23] With God's love, it's impossible not to
[1:01:25] feel that way.
[1:01:29] Comes to maturity.
[1:01:31] Oh, did I say feel? I don't mean feel. I
[1:01:33] mean, to love that way because you're
[1:01:34] not going to feel that way. You're not
[1:01:36] going to, oh, yeah, I'm happy to go to
[1:01:37] hell. No, you're not going to be happy
[1:01:39] to go to hell. But because your love for
[1:01:40] God is what it is, if he sends you say,
[1:01:42] "Okay, I'm humble. This is where I'll
[1:01:45] go. This is what you ordained for me."
[1:01:47] But he didn't. That's right. He didn't.
[1:01:50] It was God, it was brother Brandon
[1:01:51] making an example. So what we recognize
[1:01:53] when that love is in us that we are
[1:01:56] willing to do his will, whatever it is.
[1:01:58] That's why the people, our brothers and
[1:02:00] sisters, they went to the lions. They
[1:02:01] went to the stake. They suffered all
[1:02:03] these things they did. They were willing
[1:02:04] to go and stand there and be burned to
[1:02:06] death. Why? because the love of God
[1:02:08] constrained them. That's right. They had
[1:02:10] a reality. They had something genuine.
[1:02:13] It wasn't just a religion.
[1:02:18] Verse 11. Beloved, God so loved us, we
[1:02:21] ought also to love one
[1:02:23] another. No man has seen God at any
[1:02:25] time. If we love one another, agape, God
[1:02:30] dwelleth in us, and his love is
[1:02:33] perfected in us.
[1:02:35] This isn't just your family love for
[1:02:37] your kids or your husband or wife or
[1:02:38] something like that. We all love people
[1:02:40] that
[1:02:41] way. But if we agape another then God
[1:02:44] dwellth in us. And then it says his love
[1:02:46] is perfecting. That doesn't mean that
[1:02:48] God's love needs perfecting. It needs
[1:02:50] means that we need to get out of the way
[1:02:52] so he can express that in a perfect way.
[1:02:56] Well, God, you need to perfect your love
[1:02:57] in me. No, you need to die to yourself
[1:02:59] so I can express myself. That's what
[1:03:00] it's talking about.
[1:03:05] And what happens? We're our own worst
[1:03:08] enemy when it comes to this because no
[1:03:11] one wants to die. I don't care how I
[1:03:12] don't care how mature we are in Christ,
[1:03:14] nobody wants to die to their old nature.
[1:03:18] It gets easier in certain
[1:03:20] areas. But even the prophet the all the
[1:03:23] way till the end of his ministry, he was
[1:03:25] still struggling with that old
[1:03:27] flesh. He was 1 John 4:15. Whosoever
[1:03:31] shall confess that Jesus is the son of
[1:03:34] God. God dwelleth in him and he in God.
[1:03:36] Now when that says that shall confess
[1:03:38] that means more than just your mouth
[1:03:40] because it means your actions. Your life
[1:03:41] is what confessing you because a lot of
[1:03:43] people could say that with their mouth.
[1:03:44] It don't mean anything. But when your
[1:03:45] life confesses that Jesus is the son of
[1:03:47] God then God dwells in you. And we have
[1:03:49] known and believe the love that God has
[1:03:51] to us. God is love. He that dwelleth in
[1:03:54] love dwelleth in God and God in him.
[1:03:56] It's same thing. It's abiding in God's
[1:03:58] love. How we do it? by letting agape
[1:04:00] love express itself through us. Here in
[1:04:03] our love made perfect that we may have
[1:04:05] boldness in the day of
[1:04:08] judgment. This is the day of judgment
[1:04:10] for the bride. Amen. How do we have
[1:04:13] boldness? Because as he is, not was as
[1:04:17] he is, so are we in this world. Yes. Oh
[1:04:21] my. You can see what he was back there.
[1:04:23] You can see him manifesting right the
[1:04:25] same thing today. And you can say that
[1:04:27] that the same spirit that raised Christ
[1:04:29] from the dead dwells in you. And it's
[1:04:32] quickening this mortal body so that that
[1:04:34] I can love, I can believe, I can live a
[1:04:36] holy life. I can overcome this world.
[1:04:39] Why? Because the same spirit. It's not a
[1:04:40] lesser spirit. It's not just a little
[1:04:42] bit of a bitty spirit. It's the exact
[1:04:44] same spirit because you are his brother.
[1:04:47] He calls you sister. He calls you
[1:04:49] brother. And that same spirit is
[1:04:50] manifesting through you that was in him.
[1:04:52] And you can have boldness. You say, "If
[1:04:55] this is what is happening in me, then I
[1:04:57] know that I am a born again child of
[1:04:59] God, cuz there's no way I can manifest
[1:05:01] this on my own self."
[1:05:04] Oh, why? And then he says verse 18,
[1:05:06] there is no fear in love. Oh,
[1:05:08] hallelujah. Perfect love cast out fear
[1:05:11] cuz fear has torment. He that fearth is
[1:05:14] not made perfect in love.
[1:05:17] Friends say, "Well, I got fears. I got
[1:05:19] fears." Never fear, little bride. You're
[1:05:21] going to get over those fears because
[1:05:23] perfect love is going to cast it out.
[1:05:25] All you have to do is just keep walking
[1:05:27] in the spirit. Just keep hearing the
[1:05:29] word. Just keep accepting it and watch
[1:05:32] you walk until that fear is thrown away.
[1:05:34] And those that fear that used to torment
[1:05:36] you, the those things that you used to
[1:05:40] lay in bed and and tw and and quiver
[1:05:42] over and stress about and you look up
[1:05:44] one day and you say, "That does not
[1:05:46] bother me anymore." And he says, "Why?"
[1:05:49] Because perfect love has cast out that
[1:05:51] fear.
[1:05:53] Oh, you talk about freedom. When you're
[1:05:56] free from fear, brother and sister,
[1:05:58] there's all
[1:06:00] Oh, I know what I'm talking about. I've
[1:06:02] experienced it and so have some of you.
[1:06:04] That doctor comes to you and says, "You
[1:06:06] got some disease. You're going to die."
[1:06:09] And you say, "Doctor, thanks for your
[1:06:10] diagnosis, but I have no fear cuz I know
[1:06:14] whom I have believed.
[1:06:16] If it's my time to go, I'll happily go.
[1:06:19] But if it's not, not a doctor or a devil
[1:06:21] can take me from this place.
[1:06:26] Oh my. Why? Cuz because faith that that
[1:06:30] perfect love casts out that fear. And if
[1:06:33] it's time for me to die, why would I
[1:06:35] want to stick around? But if it's not
[1:06:38] time for me to go to
[1:06:40] go, nothing can take me. I'm stuck here,
[1:06:44] Satan. I'm still stuck on your hands.
[1:06:46] Deal with me.
[1:06:51] Said, "Brother Phil, I have so much
[1:06:53] fears and I still struggle and I still
[1:06:55] have stress and I have this problem and
[1:06:57] you know I I I I get so tore up. I have
[1:06:59] this mental stuff going on all the
[1:07:01] time." That's
[1:07:02] fine. That's
[1:07:04] fine. You're still human. That's right.
[1:07:08] If you don't have these things come on
[1:07:09] you, go look in the mirror real quick.
[1:07:11] see that you haven't got a body change.
[1:07:14] Because until you get that body change,
[1:07:15] you're going to struggle with these
[1:07:16] things. But you're going to see a prog.
[1:07:19] You're going to see more love. You're
[1:07:20] going to see less of control. And
[1:07:22] there's going to be things that are just
[1:07:23] they're just gone.
[1:07:27] And then you got to fight to keep him
[1:07:29] away.
[1:07:31] Because Satan will try to bring them
[1:07:32] back.
[1:07:34] And he says, "Oh yeah, but you what
[1:07:37] about this? What about this?" And you
[1:07:38] know what you can do? You can say,
[1:07:39] "Satan, I got nothing to prove to you. I
[1:07:42] got nothing to
[1:07:43] defend. You're going to hell. I'm going
[1:07:46] to heaven." Deal with that. Give him a
[1:07:49] heartache. Give him some stress.
[1:07:53] I was just talking to brother Caleb, I I
[1:07:55] read where Martin Luther way back,
[1:07:56] Martin, he said, and this is not his
[1:07:58] exact words, but he said something like
[1:08:00] this. He said, "Satan cannot stand to be
[1:08:02] disrespected or
[1:08:04] taunted." Taunt him.
[1:08:08] What are you afraid of? Well, what if he
[1:08:10] gives me a hard time? If he's not
[1:08:11] already giving you a hard time, what's
[1:08:13] he going to do?
[1:08:15] Come on.
[1:08:17] That's right. What are you afraid of?
[1:08:20] God, he can't do nothing to you that God
[1:08:22] don't allow.
[1:08:24] You know what God likes for his kids to
[1:08:26] do? He likes him to stand up in the face
[1:08:28] of that big bully like David says. You
[1:08:30] know, Satan says, "I'm going to destroy
[1:08:33] you. I'm going to do this. I'm going to
[1:08:34] wreck your family. I'm going to do
[1:08:36] this." this and you say, "I'm going to
[1:08:37] cut your head off." Amen. That's right.
[1:08:40] Throw it back in his face. Throw it back
[1:08:43] in his face. He's tormented you your
[1:08:44] whole life. Torment him back. Amen.
[1:08:51] Fear is our greatest hindrance to love.
[1:08:54] Human love is controlled by fear.
[1:09:01] Oh, this is going to hurt. I'm
[1:09:03] sorry. Your kid 17 years old. They go
[1:09:08] out with their friends. They have a
[1:09:10] 10:00
[1:09:12] curfew. You stay up. They're not back by
[1:09:15] 11. They're not back by midnight. You're
[1:09:18] tore up. You're afraid.
[1:09:22] Why? Because they're past a curfew. What
[1:09:25] good is it doing you unless you're
[1:09:27] praying, which you would be praying, but
[1:09:28] what good does it do you staying up that
[1:09:30] way and worrying on them?
[1:09:36] That don't go over very good, does
[1:09:38] it? But they're my kids. Yes, they are.
[1:09:41] But what good is it to fear? If you're
[1:09:43] praying, that's one thing. But are you
[1:09:44] praying out Oh, dear. Are you praying
[1:09:46] out of fear or in faith?
[1:09:49] Praying in fear is not doing anybody any
[1:09:52] good.
[1:09:54] God, I'm so worried. I'm so worried
[1:09:55] about them. I'm so worried about them.
[1:09:56] I'm so What's going to
[1:09:58] happen? Well, your lack of faith ain't
[1:10:01] helping.
[1:10:05] I'm glad I don't have any kids. I
[1:10:06] couldn't handle
[1:10:08] it. Let me keep moving.
[1:10:13] Matthew
[1:10:29] 5:43 look Matthew 5:43. You have heard
[1:10:32] that has been said, you shall thou shalt
[1:10:34] love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy.
[1:10:38] But I say unto
[1:10:40] you, love your
[1:10:43] enemies. Try doing that. Yeah. Brother
[1:10:47] Brandham said, "You should love the
[1:10:49] person who would kill you if they could
[1:10:52] get away with it." Can you love that
[1:10:54] person?
[1:10:58] Love your enemies. Bless them that curse
[1:11:00] you.
[1:11:02] Someone cusses you out. Someone cuts you
[1:11:04] off in traffic. Someone says
[1:11:07] whatever. You know what our attitude is
[1:11:09] sometime? God bless you because I'm a
[1:11:12] Christian.
[1:11:18] Get off your
[1:11:22] phone. Bless them that curse you. Do
[1:11:24] good to them that hate you.
[1:11:31] Yes, it is.
[1:11:32] He didn't say you could just ignore them
[1:11:34] and, you know, I'll be on this side of
[1:11:35] the church and they're on that side of
[1:11:37] the church. He said, do good for them.
[1:11:43] Pray for them that despitefully use you
[1:11:45] and persecute
[1:11:48] you. We can do that pretty easy. God, I
[1:11:51] just pray you bless them and just let
[1:11:53] their sins fall down and just destroy
[1:11:55] their life and just bring them to a
[1:11:57] place of repentance.
[1:12:10] that ye may be the children of your
[1:12:11] father which is in heaven. So listen,
[1:12:14] for he maketh his son to rise on the
[1:12:16] evil and on the good. Amen. Sendeth rain
[1:12:19] on the just and on the unjust. He
[1:12:22] blesses everybody. You know why? He
[1:12:24] loves the world. He loves everybody. He
[1:12:27] loves the sinners. He loves the saints.
[1:12:29] And for those sinners, he knows this is
[1:12:31] the only pleasure, only happiness
[1:12:33] they're ever going to have in such a
[1:12:35] short time. He says,
[1:12:37] "I I love you. I let me do something for
[1:12:40] you. I know you hate me. I know you're
[1:12:42] rejecting me. But if you knew it was
[1:12:43] coming,
[1:12:45] if you know it was coming, my heart
[1:12:47] bleeds for you." What did Jesus He stood
[1:12:49] there over Jerusalem. He said, "Oh,
[1:12:50] Jerusalem, your hour has come. Oh, if
[1:12:52] you would only accepted me, what I would
[1:12:54] have done for you, but now your hour has
[1:12:56] come." And he wept over him, right?
[1:12:59] That's what the spirit of God does in a
[1:13:01] believer.
[1:13:03] They'll sigh and cry for the sins being
[1:13:06] done in the church.
[1:13:12] For if we love them which love you, what
[1:13:15] reward have you? Do not even the
[1:13:16] publicans the same? The publicans are
[1:13:18] sinners, tax
[1:13:20] collectors. And this is really hard
[1:13:22] right here. If you salute your brethren
[1:13:24] only, what do you more than others? Do
[1:13:26] not even the publicans do? What does
[1:13:27] that salute mean? It means that after
[1:13:29] church, I don't want to shake hands with
[1:13:31] brother Joe because he hurt my feelings.
[1:13:32] I'm picking on you again. So, I'm just
[1:13:34] going to not salute him. Not going to
[1:13:36] greet
[1:13:37] him. Well, I you know I last Sunday he
[1:13:40] he kind of done whatever. So, I'm just
[1:13:42] not going to say anything to him today.
[1:13:48] I'm not going to shake hands with you
[1:13:49] because I'm not going to be nice. Well,
[1:13:51] I'll shake hands with you, but I ain't
[1:13:53] going to spend any time talking to you.
[1:13:54] I'm not going to have anything to do
[1:13:55] with you. I'm a Christian, so I will
[1:13:57] shake your
[1:14:03] hand. But but but but brother brother
[1:14:06] Tom, it's it's so much easier if there's
[1:14:08] a contention. Isn't it better just to
[1:14:10] stay away from
[1:14:11] him? Isn't it better just I have
[1:14:13] anything to do with him because I he
[1:14:14] don't like me and I love him because I'm
[1:14:16] a Christian, but we just don't get
[1:14:24] along. This is so
[1:14:28] uncomfortable. If you salute your
[1:14:30] brethren, salute your brethren only. Do
[1:14:33] you greet them or do you ignore
[1:14:35] them? Do you do good for them? But he
[1:14:39] hates my guts. Do you do good for
[1:14:45] them? And then he puts it in
[1:14:47] perspective. Verse 48. Be ye therefore
[1:14:51] perfect, even as your father which is in
[1:14:53] heaven is perfect.
[1:14:56] This ain't saying you're going to live a
[1:14:58] sinless life. This means that you are
[1:15:00] going to let God's perfect love
[1:15:02] expressed through you to that person no
[1:15:04] matter how it makes you feel. And when
[1:15:07] someone hates you and you're good to
[1:15:09] them, there's a good chance they're
[1:15:10] going to make it worse. They're going to
[1:15:12] make you they're going to pour it on.
[1:15:14] You're going to be vulnerable because
[1:15:16] you can go and try and be nice to
[1:15:17] someone. They're just going to turn and
[1:15:18] ren you. They're going to be horrible
[1:15:19] towards you. They're going to cuss you
[1:15:21] worse. And you walk away. See, I told
[1:15:23] you they didn't like
[1:15:25] me. You know, you were good up to that
[1:15:27] point. Don't walk away with that
[1:15:29] attitude. Walk away with attitude. God,
[1:15:31] please help them because they're they're
[1:15:33] in a bad place. And is there something
[1:15:34] else I can do to bring them to a place
[1:15:36] of repentance or something? But you do
[1:15:38] it with love. Yeah.
[1:15:41] Be perfect. Paul told us what that
[1:15:43] perfection
[1:15:46] is. We're going to get to in a little
[1:15:48] bit. First uh 1 Corinthians 13, love is
[1:15:51] perfection, the expression of it.
[1:15:58] Jesus did not go around trying to love
[1:16:00] his enemies.
[1:16:03] He did not in Gethsemane when he was
[1:16:06] there, he knew Judas was coming. He knew
[1:16:07] what was going to happen. He was, "Oh, I
[1:16:08] got to okay, I got to love Judas. Oh my
[1:16:10] goodness. I can't stand that guy. But I
[1:16:12] got to love him. Oh my. He's about to
[1:16:13] sell me out. I'm going to experience the
[1:16:15] worst thing a human being will ever
[1:16:16] experience. And I got to try to love
[1:16:18] him. Oh no. He was so dead to himself
[1:16:22] that when Judas showed up, he said, "Why
[1:16:25] call myself friend?" He called him
[1:16:31] friend. We have trouble calling people
[1:16:33] friend who do a lot less than that.
[1:16:41] This This is supposed to be heavier
[1:16:42] tonight. I'm sorry. 1 Corinthians 13,
[1:16:45] I'm gonna start at verse four. You know
[1:16:47] this by heart. Charity suffereth long in
[1:16:49] his kind. Charity envieth not. Vandethth
[1:16:52] not itself, is not puffed up, does not
[1:16:54] behave itself unseemly, seeketh not own,
[1:16:56] is not easily provoked, thinkketh no
[1:16:57] evil, rejoices not iniquity, but
[1:16:58] rejoicth in the truth. Beareth all
[1:17:00] things, believeth all things, hopeeth
[1:17:01] all things, endureth all things.
[1:17:04] Now, I'm going to read this in the NIV
[1:17:06] version just to make it a little bit
[1:17:07] easier to understand what they're
[1:17:09] saying. All
[1:17:10] right. Love is
[1:17:14] patient. There I go. Love is
[1:17:19] kind. It does not
[1:17:21] envy. It does not boast. It is not
[1:17:25] proud. It is not rude. It is not
[1:17:28] self-seeking. It is not easily angered.
[1:17:31] keeps no record of wrongs. There goes
[1:17:34] your grudges.
[1:17:37] Love does not delight in
[1:17:39] evil. Boy, that person, they finally got
[1:17:42] it. I knew they were going to get it.
[1:17:44] But I tell you well, you know, it kind
[1:17:45] of serves them right.
[1:17:47] Delights in evil.
[1:17:50] Rejoices with the truth. Always
[1:17:54] protects. Always
[1:17:57] trusts. Always hopes. always
[1:18:02] perseveres. That's what love does. Do
[1:18:04] you notice what it does not do? It does
[1:18:07] not defend itself.
[1:18:09] It does not try to control others. It
[1:18:12] does not force its opinions or thoughts
[1:18:15] or beliefs on others. It allows other
[1:18:18] people to live their own life the
[1:18:20] freedom to make their own choices.
[1:18:23] That's what love does. That's what God
[1:18:25] love God's love does. Satan's love. He
[1:18:28] takes his religion and does the exact
[1:18:29] opposite.
[1:18:31] So we're talking about the spirit of
[1:18:32] liberty because you go to a
[1:18:34] denominational church and remember I'm
[1:18:35] not just talking about out there talking
[1:18:37] about within our message ranks you can
[1:18:38] see that that forceful kind of religion
[1:18:40] that you got to do this you got to do
[1:18:42] that and it's such such a legalistic
[1:18:44] thing and they they cloak it with some
[1:18:46] kind of a a sense of of love or or you
[1:18:48] know happiness and we're all whatever we
[1:18:50] are but it's still got the underlying
[1:18:53] spirit which is a a spirit that's not
[1:18:56] easily intreated. It's hard. It's it's
[1:18:58] it's forceful. It's iron
[1:19:00] disposition. But God's love sets you
[1:19:03] free. He says, "I'm not going to force
[1:19:04] you to serve me. I'm not going to force
[1:19:07] you to love
[1:19:09] me. And my love, the example of it,
[1:19:12] proves
[1:19:17] it. God's love sets people
[1:19:21] free to live the life that you want to
[1:19:24] live.
[1:19:26] Human love controls you. And so Paul
[1:19:30] said, "I don't put away childish
[1:19:32] things." What are childish things? He's
[1:19:34] talking about attempting to control
[1:19:36] others through our manipulation, through
[1:19:37] our emotions. We throw a fit if we don't
[1:19:39] get what we want. We we you know, we we
[1:19:41] say the right things. We're nice to this
[1:19:43] person because we're trying to trying
[1:19:44] to, you know, get in good with this
[1:19:46] group of people and we're not so nice to
[1:19:48] this person because we don't really care
[1:19:49] about that group of people or whatever
[1:19:51] the situation is. And it's all little
[1:19:53] childish kind of things.
[1:19:56] It causes splits in churches. It causes
[1:19:59] clicks and all this stuff going on
[1:20:00] within families. You have families.
[1:20:02] People don't even talk to each other
[1:20:03] within the same the same family.
[1:20:07] Oh, but we're Christians.
[1:20:10] You say, "Well, they won't talk to me."
[1:20:12] I understand that if they don't talk to
[1:20:14] you, that's one thing. But what's your
[1:20:15] attitude? Are you still making that
[1:20:16] time? Are you still, "Hey, just want you
[1:20:18] to know I love you. I'll talk to you
[1:20:19] anytime you want to." You got to put
[1:20:21] yourself out there. You got to put
[1:20:22] yourself out there. hang on that cross,
[1:20:24] so to speak, and bear your own cross, I
[1:20:25] should say, because you have to be that
[1:20:27] person that's available when God wants
[1:20:29] to start dealing with them.
[1:20:31] They have to know that you love them.
[1:20:37] Try doing that in your human
[1:20:40] love. The next question is, have you,
[1:20:43] like we said this morning, what we try
[1:20:44] to do so many times, we try to control
[1:20:46] God through emotions. We try to appeal
[1:20:48] to God's
[1:20:49] emotions to try to get what we want.
[1:20:52] God, I'm really in pain right here.
[1:20:54] Don't you feel sorry for me? He said, if
[1:20:56] you start believing me, I could relieve
[1:20:58] your pain. But I don't work through
[1:21:00] pity. I don't work through your
[1:21:02] self-pity, through your victimhood. I
[1:21:03] work through faith.
[1:21:06] It's got to be
[1:21:09] faith. We pray in despair, in
[1:21:13] self-righteousness. I have wasted so
[1:21:15] many hours in prayer.
[1:21:17] wallowing in my self-pity and my grief
[1:21:19] and all my oh God I just I'm trying so
[1:21:22] hard and I just can't seem to do it and
[1:21:24] he's over there twiddling his
[1:21:26] thumbs he said you ain't even woke me up
[1:21:29] yet I am not even listening to
[1:21:34] you Romans 10 verse 5 for Moses
[1:21:38] describeth the righteousness which is of
[1:21:40] the law that the man which doeth those
[1:21:42] things shall live by them keeping the
[1:21:44] law but the righteousness which is of
[1:21:47] faith speaketh on this. Why? Say not in
[1:21:49] thine heart, who shall ascend into
[1:21:50] heaven? That is to bring Christ down
[1:21:51] from above. Who shall descend into the
[1:21:53] deep? That is to bring up Christ from
[1:21:55] the
[1:21:55] dead. See what you're doing? He said,
[1:21:57] "Well, I'm going to I'm going to pull
[1:21:59] Christ down. I'm going to pray him down.
[1:22:00] I'm going to pray him up. I'm going to
[1:22:01] live such a holy life. I'm going to get
[1:22:03] his attention. I'm going to do this. I'm
[1:22:04] going to do that. Try to bring Christ on
[1:22:06] the
[1:22:07] scene. Trying to bring Christ on the
[1:22:09] scene with my
[1:22:12] religion. But what saith it? The word is
[1:22:15] nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy
[1:22:18] heart. That is the word of faith which
[1:22:20] we preach. You want to bring Christ on
[1:22:22] the scene, speak the word of faith.
[1:22:24] Speak what he has revealed to you. Take
[1:22:26] God at his word. Say, God, I believe
[1:22:28] you.
[1:22:29] You know what he says back and I believe
[1:22:32] you. And because I know you're telling
[1:22:34] me the truth that you believe, I am
[1:22:35] going to move on that situation.
[1:22:42] Let me skip ahead. But I'm run out of
[1:22:45] time
[1:22:47] again. Song of Solomon chapter 2:7 says,
[1:22:50] "I charge you, oh you daughters of
[1:22:52] Jerusalem, by the rose and by the hines
[1:22:53] of the field that you stir not up nor
[1:22:55] wait my love till he
[1:22:57] please." What's he talking about? He's
[1:23:00] taking a
[1:23:02] rest. In in Hebrews it says, "Enter into
[1:23:05] his rest." What is it? You have entered
[1:23:09] into the covert of his wings. You've
[1:23:10] gone into that strong tower and he's
[1:23:12] resting and he's resting with you. Why
[1:23:14] are you resting? Because in the midst of
[1:23:16] the storm, you're taking him at his word
[1:23:18] and he's there resting and you're
[1:23:20] resting with him in the midst of your
[1:23:21] battles because by faith you have
[1:23:23] entered into that rest.
[1:23:27] He says, "Now don't stir him up and
[1:23:29] don't let him rest. He's got his bride.
[1:23:32] He's in there. Don't stir him
[1:23:34] up." Well, how would you do that? You're
[1:23:37] supposed to call Jesus on the scene. You
[1:23:38] are.
[1:23:40] There was a boat sailing across the sea
[1:23:42] one night and the storm was coming up.
[1:23:45] It was horrible. It was throwing it
[1:23:46] around and there was a there's a young a
[1:23:48] young man sitting laying in the back
[1:23:50] sleeping on a
[1:23:51] pillow. There's 12 men scared to death.
[1:23:54] The boat was filling up with water.
[1:24:00] Peter looked at John said, "What are we
[1:24:01] going to do? We're going to
[1:24:04] drown." John said, "Let's go get Jesus.
[1:24:10] They're Jesus. Don't you care? We're
[1:24:12] going to drown. We're going to die.
[1:24:13] Don't you care that we
[1:24:17] perish? What are you afraid of? Why have
[1:24:20] you no
[1:24:21] faith? Peace be
[1:24:24] still. They woke him from his rest
[1:24:27] before he was
[1:24:29] ready because there's no
[1:24:32] faith. What if they would have done
[1:24:35] this? Peter was, "Hey, we're sinking."
[1:24:38] Yeah, I know. What are we going to do? I
[1:24:39] don't Jesus is back there. What's he
[1:24:42] doing?
[1:24:44] Sleeping. Peter says, "Well, goodness
[1:24:46] sakes, if he's sleeping, I'm sleeping.
[1:24:47] Give me a pillow." He grabbed a pillow.
[1:24:49] He go and lay down next to Jesus and
[1:24:51] went to sleep. That would have been
[1:24:52] faith.
[1:24:55] You know what would woke up Jesus? About
[1:24:57] 30 minutes later, he would woke up with
[1:24:59] 12 guys snoring like sawdust, like like
[1:25:03] chainsaws in there. He said, "Man, you
[1:25:05] guys are waking me up with all this
[1:25:08] snoring. Peace, be still." And he would
[1:25:11] have rejoiced in spirit because he had
[1:25:14] believers around him.
[1:25:17] Yeah. You call Jesus on the scene, but
[1:25:18] don't do it in fear. Do it in faith. If
[1:25:21] they would say they're afraid, they're
[1:25:22] afraid that they're going to go down.
[1:25:24] They could Jesus. Jesus, hey, our boat
[1:25:26] is is sinking. It's just about down. He
[1:25:29] said, "Okay, but I know you can speak
[1:25:31] the word and fix it.
[1:25:34] The doctor comes to you and says, "You
[1:25:35] got cancer. You're going to die." Okay,
[1:25:38] thanks. But
[1:25:39] no, I got Jesus in my boat.
[1:25:44] I'm not afraid,
[1:25:46] but my family's falling apart. And
[1:25:48] that's all right. We got Jesus. He's
[1:25:50] right here. Where's he at? He's
[1:25:52] resting. Well, wake him up. Call him on
[1:25:54] and say, "What if something bad
[1:25:55] happened? My family's falling apart."
[1:25:58] Sh. Wait till he wakes up.
[1:26:01] He'll be here on time. In his time, in
[1:26:05] his season. Don't try to control him.
[1:26:09] Let him come when he's
[1:26:12] ready. He said, it says, uh, "Stir not
[1:26:16] up, nor wait my love till he pleases."
[1:26:18] Verse 7. Verse eight. Listen what
[1:26:20] happens when you wait until it's his
[1:26:22] time. It says, "The voice of my
[1:26:26] beloved, behold, he cometh leaping upon
[1:26:29] the mountains and skipping up on the
[1:26:31] hills." What? When it was time, he came
[1:26:34] right on time. And how many times have
[1:26:36] you been in a situation and it looked
[1:26:38] helpless, it looked hopeless, you didn't
[1:26:39] know what you're going to do. And all a
[1:26:40] sudden, you heard the voice of your
[1:26:42] beloved. And here he come running. Why?
[1:26:44] Because you allowed him to rest. You
[1:26:45] allowed him to come in his time, in his
[1:26:47] season. And he was free to come when he
[1:26:50] wanted to.
[1:26:52] Thank you, Jesus. In his time. You know
[1:26:55] what? You know what? Some of our
[1:26:57] greatest fear is when we put limits on
[1:26:59] God's time. When we say, "Well, God, you
[1:27:01] got to do it by this time. Well, I've
[1:27:02] been believing for a month. I've been
[1:27:04] believing for a year. I've been
[1:27:05] believing for this, and it's not
[1:27:06] happening yet." You're building fear in
[1:27:08] yourself because you're putting a time
[1:27:10] limit on him.
[1:27:12] You can't put a time limit. And also,
[1:27:14] you can't limit how he's going to do it.
[1:27:17] Right? Well, well, God, you healed this
[1:27:19] prison this way, or you delivered this
[1:27:20] person that way, or you gave this person
[1:27:22] the Holy Ghost this way, so this is the
[1:27:24] way I want it. He said, "You can go
[1:27:25] ahead and want it any way you want, but
[1:27:27] when I come, it's not going to be what
[1:27:29] you expected.
[1:27:32] It's never the way we expect, but it's
[1:27:34] always on time. It's always in this
[1:27:35] season. It's never too late."
[1:27:40] What is it, friends? Because we're
[1:27:41] trying to control what's going on. We're
[1:27:44] trying to control his love. were trying
[1:27:46] to control the spirit. That's why he
[1:27:47] said the spirit, you the wind, you hear
[1:27:49] it, it comes and it goes. You don't know
[1:27:52] where it's coming from. You don't know
[1:27:53] where it's going. You don't know what
[1:27:54] God's going to do through you. You don't
[1:27:56] know how he's going to use you. You just
[1:27:58] make yourself available so when the wind
[1:28:00] blows, you blow with it.
[1:28:03] Jesus. That's what it means, friends, to
[1:28:05] be a Christian. That's what it means to
[1:28:07] have that spirit of liberty.
[1:28:13] Think of think of nature. You you see a
[1:28:15] eagle soaring, right? They take off.
[1:28:17] They soar out there. Man, that's
[1:28:19] beautiful. There is nothing like seeing
[1:28:21] an eagle just rise up in that that blue
[1:28:24] sky and the sunshining and just soaring
[1:28:26] around there. Say, "Oh, I want to I want
[1:28:28] to keep that. I want to always have
[1:28:30] that. Let's put him in a
[1:28:34] cage." Have you ever done what I've done
[1:28:36] many times? God will do a certain thing
[1:28:38] for me and I said, "I I want to be able
[1:28:39] to get that whenever I How do I control?
[1:28:41] How do I set my mind in a way to think
[1:28:43] that I can get that back when I need
[1:28:47] it? It's like trying to hold fog in your
[1:28:51] hand. You don't do that. You know what
[1:28:54] you do? You trust him that he'll come
[1:28:56] when it's
[1:28:57] time. You trust him that he will be
[1:29:00] there because you know he loves you and
[1:29:02] you love him. And so whenever it's time
[1:29:04] and you can pray and pray and go to
[1:29:06] church and it seems like God's not
[1:29:07] moving and things just seem like it's
[1:29:09] not going right and you're in a danger
[1:29:11] of becoming of of leaning to your human
[1:29:13] love, say, "Well, God, I'm doing this.
[1:29:15] Why are you not doing something back? I
[1:29:17] I I need this reciprocation." He says,
[1:29:19] "No, you need to trust me.
[1:29:25] Well, if I go to church and God don't
[1:29:26] move what I'm supposed to do, sit there
[1:29:28] and praise him anyways.
[1:29:31] Give praise him for giving you enough
[1:29:33] faith to come to church. Praise him for
[1:29:35] giving you that that breath you're
[1:29:37] breathing right now. There's something
[1:29:38] to praise him about.
[1:29:40] Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:42] That's right. Friends, going through
[1:29:44] deserts are hard, but there's a lot
[1:29:46] harder. If you start thinking, well, I
[1:29:48] need something from God. God, I need you
[1:29:49] to answer me. God, I need you to answer
[1:29:51] me. And he said, well, what are you
[1:29:52] going to do? You're going back and you
[1:29:54] Jesus, wake up. Don't you care that I
[1:29:56] that I'm perish?
[1:29:58] He said, "I was, you were fine a minute
[1:30:00] ago. I'm still here. What you whining
[1:30:03] about?"
[1:30:05] It's a three-year-old child saying,
[1:30:07] "Daddy, I want this. Dad, I want this.
[1:30:09] I'll get it for you. Dad, I want I'll
[1:30:11] get it for you, D." Oh my goodness.
[1:30:21] Let him be
[1:30:22] free. He doesn't control you. He doesn't
[1:30:27] control your love. He doesn't force you.
[1:30:29] He says, "I will give you my love and
[1:30:31] let you love the way you want." And he
[1:30:34] said, "I will not be controlled by
[1:30:39] yours. You don't get to control the Holy
[1:30:42] Spirit. You don't get to control how he
[1:30:44] moves. You don't get to control why he
[1:30:46] preaches. You don't get to control how
[1:30:48] he manifests healing and deliverance in
[1:30:50] anything. You don't control him."
[1:30:52] Because why? Because he's up there. He's
[1:30:54] soaring up there. He says, "Why don't
[1:30:55] you just come up here with me?
[1:30:58] Lord, come on up and fly with me instead
[1:31:00] of laying down there feeling sorry for
[1:31:02] yourself because I haven't moved in your
[1:31:04] life for the last three
[1:31:05] weeks. I know what I'm doing. I know
[1:31:08] what I'm doing."
[1:31:15] I was I was hiking a couple couple years
[1:31:17] ago. I was in North Dakota and I was
[1:31:19] walking just by myself down this trail.
[1:31:20] I I I felt I heard this rumbling
[1:31:23] thunderlike sound and the ground started
[1:31:25] shaking a little bit underneath me. And
[1:31:27] about as far as from here to the back
[1:31:29] wall right there, the sound system is
[1:31:33] coming down through this little cut with
[1:31:35] about a hundred
[1:31:36] buffalo
[1:31:38] running. I ain't never seen anything
[1:31:40] like it. It almost makes you cry. Look
[1:31:42] at that. The heads were down there just
[1:31:45] pounding. They ran out there. I stopped.
[1:31:49] They ran out there. just a big open area
[1:31:50] and they just went out there and they
[1:31:52] started having a picnic. Some of them
[1:31:55] were laying down. Some of them were
[1:31:56] eating. The young ones were running
[1:31:58] around button heads and just playing
[1:32:00] with each other. I just stood there and
[1:32:02] watched
[1:32:04] it. Oh wow. How I'd like to keep be able
[1:32:08] to keep that. How you going to keep it?
[1:32:10] Put them in a corral. You destroy the
[1:32:13] very thing that makes it so amazing. You
[1:32:15] destroyed the very experience
[1:32:18] because I wasn't expecting it. All of a
[1:32:20] sudden, there it
[1:32:22] was. That's how the Holy Spirit is.
[1:32:24] You're not expecting it. Sometime you're
[1:32:26] going through your trial and you have
[1:32:27] this problem and you may you might have
[1:32:29] been dealing with this thing for years
[1:32:31] and all of a sudden you hear this sound
[1:32:33] of him coming running across the
[1:32:35] mountain skipping across the hills. It's
[1:32:36] the voice of my beloved. Her it's time.
[1:32:40] It's time.
[1:32:43] This is a season for your healing. You
[1:32:46] have come to a place where you're
[1:32:47] allowing me to express myself through
[1:32:49] you. And I have been waiting for this so
[1:32:52] long. You think you've been waiting for
[1:32:53] a while. I've been waiting since
[1:32:55] eternity.
[1:32:58] Oh, I've been waiting for you. I've been
[1:33:00] waiting for you to come to cuz I want to
[1:33:02] express myself through you so bad.
[1:33:07] Oh, please know what I'm talking about.
[1:33:09] Surely you've experienced this. If not,
[1:33:11] don't worry. It's coming over and over
[1:33:14] and over again if you just let him.
[1:33:17] That's right.
[1:33:20] Let me finish up. I'm going to go. You
[1:33:21] all know this story of the bull charging
[1:33:24] brother Brandham.
[1:33:26] All right. Well, we're going to go to
[1:33:27] that and watch this thought. I'm talking
[1:33:31] about the freedom. Let the Holy Spirit
[1:33:32] be free. Brother Brandham's talking
[1:33:33] about he said, "At first, it scared me
[1:33:36] when the bull came out. He said, "I
[1:33:37] looked for a tree. There wasn't any
[1:33:38] tree. I know he could outrun me to the
[1:33:40] fence. So I thought, well, this is it.
[1:33:42] Different place. He said, well, I'm
[1:33:44] gonna I don't want to die like a coward.
[1:33:45] I'm gonna die like a
[1:33:48] man. So then something happened. Oh God,
[1:33:52] if that would only stay there instead of
[1:33:55] going away.
[1:33:58] The prophet himself did not control the
[1:34:01] spirit. He did not control the
[1:34:03] expression of that love. We know what it
[1:34:05] is. That was love expressed through him
[1:34:07] to that bull and it took away the the
[1:34:09] violence from that bull. He said, "Oh,
[1:34:11] if it would just stay that way."
[1:34:14] You know what would happen if we always
[1:34:16] lived in that? We would not have a
[1:34:18] single trial the rest of our life.
[1:34:20] Because every time Satan comes against
[1:34:22] you, you'd look right at say, "What a
[1:34:23] stupid lie. That ain't gonna make me
[1:34:26] happy. That's misery.
[1:34:29] Go
[1:34:30] away." But he knows how to bring it.
[1:34:33] Yeah, he knows how to bring those
[1:34:34] temptations. He knows how to bring those
[1:34:36] vain imaginations, those thoughts.
[1:34:41] He said, "Oh, if it would only stay
[1:34:43] there instead of going away." Something
[1:34:45] happened. I wish God would let it,
[1:34:46] listen to this, I wish God would let it
[1:34:48] happen to everybody here tonight just
[1:34:51] long enough to get healed.
[1:34:56] In that atmosphere, Yeah. of perfect
[1:34:59] love, everything can be healed.
[1:35:02] Everything can be delivered. Everything
[1:35:04] can be done. But he doesn't do it that
[1:35:05] way.
[1:35:07] He doesn't do it that way because it's
[1:35:09] you and him as an individual.
[1:35:16] Something happened. I wasn't scared of
[1:35:18] the bull. I felt sorry because I
[1:35:19] disturbed him. I was in his field. He
[1:35:20] was laying out there not bothering me. I
[1:35:22] come along and woke him up. And so I
[1:35:24] felt sorry for him. Now you can't bluff
[1:35:27] it. It has to be there.
[1:35:29] That's right. You can't bluff Satan.
[1:35:32] You can't bluff this. You know, when
[1:35:34] people see something real, like I saying
[1:35:36] this morning, when they recognize
[1:35:38] something that's real about you, you can
[1:35:40] claim to be a Christian all you want,
[1:35:42] but if it's real, if it's genuine,
[1:35:43] you're not bluffing it. And that spirit,
[1:35:45] that atmosphere around you will project
[1:35:48] itself, and people will recognize it,
[1:35:49] and they're either going to love you for
[1:35:51] it or hate you for it. That's right.
[1:35:54] And then sometime when I'm not walking
[1:35:57] in the spirit the way I should, when I'm
[1:36:00] having whatever issues, I'm walking in
[1:36:02] unbelief or sin or fear, there's no
[1:36:04] atmosphere like that at all. And I'm
[1:36:05] just like everybody else.
[1:36:09] But when it
[1:36:11] happens, you're talking to someone, the
[1:36:14] checkout lady at Walmart and you've you
[1:36:17] just start chatting about something and
[1:36:19] just in a second you can tell there's
[1:36:21] just something different there and so
[1:36:23] can she and you walk away knowing that
[1:36:26] God just done something.
[1:36:30] Oh, I wish that was there all the time.
[1:36:32] But you can't fake it. You can't, well,
[1:36:34] I'm going to start talking to everybody.
[1:36:35] See if I can get it to happen. No,
[1:36:36] you're just being ill foolish as you're
[1:36:39] led by the spirit. He said, "Now, you
[1:36:41] can't bluff it. It has to be there."
[1:36:42] That's the way faith is. You can't bluff
[1:36:45] it. You got to really have it. The devil
[1:36:47] will know
[1:36:49] it. If you got faith, I believe. I
[1:36:52] believe. I believe. And the devil's
[1:36:53] saying, "No, you
[1:36:55] don't." Because faith is not something
[1:36:57] going on in here. It's something going
[1:36:59] on right here. Faith is from the heart.
[1:37:02] Because you can be terrified. That
[1:37:04] doctor can give you a diagnosis and
[1:37:05] scares you to death. But inside you say,
[1:37:07] "Yeah, but I'm not afraid down here."
[1:37:10] And this is what controls this.
[1:37:17] I looked at the bull. If anything, I
[1:37:19] could have cried for him. Why? I thought
[1:37:21] poor creature. Well, how wrong I am.
[1:37:24] Now, ordinarily, I wouldn't feel that
[1:37:26] way about it. Amen.
[1:37:31] He didn't say, "I walk around as
[1:37:33] Superman all the time and I feel this
[1:37:35] way all the time. I'm not afraid of
[1:37:37] anything." He said, "Ordinarily, I
[1:37:40] wouldn't feel that way about it." What
[1:37:41] was it? The wind blew. The Holy Spirit
[1:37:44] come. And it didn't come from there. It
[1:37:45] came from here.
[1:37:48] First, I was looking for the gun. I was
[1:37:50] glad I didn't have it. I'd have shot him
[1:37:52] and went and paid for it. But I didn't
[1:37:53] have the gun. I thought, "Well, poor
[1:37:54] creature. I'm in your pasture. This is
[1:37:56] your home. You have you're a brute. You
[1:37:58] don't know any different. You wouldn't
[1:37:59] want to kill me anyhow. But I disturbed
[1:38:01] you. I'm sorry I did that. I didn't mean
[1:38:03] to disturb you. Talking like I am now. I
[1:38:07] just couldn't help it. There was
[1:38:09] something talking in me.
[1:38:13] It wasn't the prophet saying, "Let me
[1:38:15] show my faith. Let me show you my love.
[1:38:17] Let me show you the the the great
[1:38:19] prophet of God that I am." It was
[1:38:21] nothing like that. It was just a person
[1:38:23] like you and the Holy Spirit moved on
[1:38:25] that situation. The supreme grace in the
[1:38:27] supreme moment and the Holy Spirit took
[1:38:29] over. Why? Because he had a surrendered
[1:38:31] vessel he could take over. That's right.
[1:38:34] That's the difference. Are you that
[1:38:35] surrendered vessel that he can take over
[1:38:37] and speak to somebody? Are you that
[1:38:39] surrendered vessel he can put on your
[1:38:40] heart? Get up and pray for someone right
[1:38:42] now. Pray for them. Are you that person?
[1:38:45] Hey, you need to call this person.
[1:38:47] They're going through a hard time and I
[1:38:48] want to speak to you to give them a word
[1:38:50] of encouragement. Are you that person to
[1:38:52] go to the go to your pas like brother
[1:38:53] Thomas I'm having a problem and I'm
[1:38:55] coming here to my pastor and I know that
[1:38:57] God will speak through you to my problem
[1:39:03] being led by the spirit why because you
[1:39:05] are a surrendered vessel you have died
[1:39:08] to that that human love that is
[1:39:10] protecting yourself oh brother friends
[1:39:12] if you get up every morning and tell
[1:39:13] Satan I got nothing to defend I got
[1:39:15] nothing to protect I got nothing to
[1:39:17] prove I got nothing for
[1:39:22] But what if someone says something bad
[1:39:23] to me? Don't defend
[1:39:28] yourself. It's all about self. We defend
[1:39:31] oursel. We protect oursel. I don't want
[1:39:33] to be hurt anymore. That's where uh uh
[1:39:37] complexes come from. That's what
[1:39:39] happened with the prophet. You know why?
[1:39:41] You know why he developed that complex?
[1:39:42] He was tired of being hurt.
[1:39:45] He said, "Those people should have
[1:39:46] believed me.
[1:39:48] They should have believed me and they
[1:39:50] didn't. He built that complex. And
[1:39:51] here's the most amazing part about that.
[1:39:53] He was confessing it to the people. And
[1:39:55] then he said, "And I know I shouldn't
[1:39:58] feel that way, but I still
[1:40:01] do." He said, "Pray for me that God will
[1:40:04] change my mind because I still feel that
[1:40:06] way." He knew it was wrong, but that
[1:40:07] complex had got so deep in here, not in
[1:40:10] here. That complex was so deep in his
[1:40:12] mind. He said, "I can't just just
[1:40:13] dismiss it and think different." He
[1:40:15] said, "I still feel that way.
[1:40:18] You don't just take a complex and just
[1:40:20] say, "Well, I'm just going to quit feel
[1:40:21] feeling that way. I'm just quit
[1:40:22] believing that way." No, you're not.
[1:40:24] Because that complex has been there a
[1:40:25] while. It's so buried in your
[1:40:27] subconscious that you don't get to
[1:40:28] control it anymore. That's where fears
[1:40:30] and doubts and things come from in our
[1:40:37] mind. He said, "Oh my, it's too bad we
[1:40:39] ever have to leave that. Just submit."
[1:40:42] God just took over. Real quick, I'm I'm
[1:40:44] gonna close here.
[1:40:47] He said, 'I was just talking as I am
[1:40:49] now, but there was something another had
[1:40:50] happened. I wasn't scared of him. I was
[1:40:52] no more afraid of the bull than I would
[1:40:53] be of my brother. That's where the
[1:40:56] church is. You're always scared it's not
[1:40:59] going to
[1:41:02] happen. That's the reason it don't
[1:41:05] happen. When that fear,
[1:41:08] love casts out fear.
[1:41:11] When you got love, fear is gone. Amen.
[1:41:14] But as long as you got fear, love cannot
[1:41:17] operate.
[1:41:19] Oh, how do you get that? I want us so
[1:41:21] bad. I do, too. How do you get there?
[1:41:23] It's all about dying daily to our own
[1:41:26] human love. What I want for myself,
[1:41:29] that's it. It's about defending self.
[1:41:32] Just let yourself die. Just let it go
[1:41:34] and say, "God, I ought to have you and
[1:41:36] nothing else." Amen. Amen.
[1:41:41] He said, "Then when the bull made his
[1:41:42] charge to come to me, he come within
[1:41:44] about 10 ft, stopped through his head,
[1:41:46] front feet out. He looked so depleted.
[1:41:48] He just looked this way and that. He
[1:41:49] turned, went back and laid down. I
[1:41:51] walked across the field, went out the
[1:41:53] pasture. He laid there, looked at me. It
[1:41:55] was love that took the fear away. And
[1:41:57] God seen me through."
[1:42:00] And then he says something that just
[1:42:02] blows my
[1:42:03] mind. Now, after I got out of the
[1:42:06] pasture and that left
[1:42:08] me, then I just shook like a
[1:42:13] leaf. What kind of humility is
[1:42:17] that? I would have got up here and say,
[1:42:19] "Man, you should have seen that. That
[1:42:20] bull came at me and I just stood there
[1:42:22] and that bull turned and walked away and
[1:42:23] I walked out of there. I was just fine."
[1:42:28] Yeah. That prophet has enough humility
[1:42:30] to say, "I shook like a leaf. It scared
[1:42:32] the fire out of me. because he thought
[1:42:35] he was going to die.
[1:42:39] But while I was in that presence of him,
[1:42:42] the fear had
[1:42:53] left. God refuses to control your
[1:42:58] love. He says, "You are a free moral
[1:43:01] agent. You can love me if you want. You
[1:43:03] can hate me if you want because I'm not
[1:43:06] going to force you because I don't want
[1:43:07] to be loved by a bride who's forced to
[1:43:09] love me. This ain't a forced marriage.
[1:43:13] I want you to love me because you
[1:43:15] recognize that I'm a lovable God.
[1:43:20] And he said, "I won't be controlled by
[1:43:22] your human
[1:43:24] love. Be
[1:43:26] free." You want to be a Christian
[1:43:28] tonight, you can be a Christian.
[1:43:31] You want to be born again, you can be
[1:43:32] born again. You want to have perfect
[1:43:34] love, you already got it. If you're born
[1:43:36] again, you already have perfect love.
[1:43:38] It's just waiting for those
[1:43:39] opportunities to express itself. And how
[1:43:41] much we would love if it would express
[1:43:42] itself more. The prophet himself said,
[1:43:44] "Oh, I wish it was like this all the
[1:43:46] time."
[1:43:47] But it's not. So we can go through our
[1:43:49] daily struggles, our battles, our
[1:43:53] trials, and wait for the time and season
[1:43:55] to hear him come running. Said, "It's
[1:43:58] time."
[1:44:00] Isn't he wonderful?
[1:44:02] Go ahead and stand.
[1:44:07] Amen. Lord Jesus, we're so grateful,
[1:44:10] Father, that you would come and show us
[1:44:12] a little bit of your character, your
[1:44:14] characteristics, your nature, and then
[1:44:16] we can see that little by little, we see
[1:44:18] it being formed in us. We see it
[1:44:20] expressing itself through us.
[1:44:23] Father, I don't know anything greater
[1:44:24] than to see Christ in me, the hope of
[1:44:26] glory, living itself out and seen into
[1:44:28] my brothers and
[1:44:30] sisters. Lord, will you just accept our
[1:44:32] praise now? We want to worship you a
[1:44:33] little bit. We want to we want to let
[1:44:35] you know, Father, just as individuals
[1:44:37] that we are so thankful for what you
[1:44:39] have done. We are so thankful what you
[1:44:42] are doing and will continue to do. Thank
[1:44:44] you, Lord
[1:44:45] Jesus. Can we sing that song? I will
[1:44:48] serve thee because I love you.
[1:44:54] I will
[1:44:56] serve
[1:44:58] thee because I
[1:45:01] love
[1:45:04] thee. You have
[1:45:08] given life to me.
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:16] I was
[1:45:20] nothing before you found
[1:45:24] [Music]
[1:45:26] me. You have
[1:45:30] given life
[1:45:33] [Music]
[1:45:35] to to me.
[1:45:38] whole
[1:45:42] heartache and broken
[1:45:48] piecees. Ruin
[1:45:51] lies are why you die on Calary.
[1:46:03] Oh is all I long
[1:46:09] for you have
[1:46:13] given life to me. God bless you brother
[1:46:19] and sister. Appreciate the fellowship.
[1:46:21] Appreciate the pull. You're easy people
[1:46:23] to preach to and that means a lot to a
[1:46:25] preacher. So thank you. God bless you.
[1:46:27] If I don't see you anymore, I will. But
[1:46:30] if not, I'll see you in the rapture. So,
[1:46:31] just make sure you're there cuz I'm
[1:46:33] going to be there, too. Okay. God bless
[1:46:35] you.
[1:46:39] [Music]
[1:46:41] Oh,
[1:46:45] heartache, broken pieces.
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:59] I don't
[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:08] care. I long
[1:47:12] for you have
[1:47:16] given life to me.
[1:47:22] Oh,
[1:47:24] something
[1:47:27] [Music]
[1:47:28] beautiful,
[1:47:31] something
[1:47:35] good. All my frustrations.
[1:47:42] He
[1:47:47] unerstood. All I had to offer him was
[1:47:55] brokenness and strife. But he made
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:03] something
[1:48:05] beautiful of my life. once again if we
[1:48:08] could
[1:48:11] tonight. Oh,
[1:48:15] something
[1:48:19] beautiful,
[1:48:21] something
[1:48:25] good, all my frustrations.
[1:48:32] He
[1:48:33] [Music]
[1:48:37] understood. All I had to offer him was
[1:48:45] brokenness and strife. But he made
[1:48:53] something
[1:48:55] beautiful of my life.
[1:49:01] Well, Jesus got a hold of my life and he
[1:49:05] won't let me
[1:49:09] go. Oh, Jesus got into my heart. He got
[1:49:14] into my
[1:49:18] soul. Well, I used to be oh so
[1:49:22] sad, but now I'm just free and glad
[1:49:27] singing Jesus got a hold of my life and
[1:49:32] he won't let me go. Aren't you thankful
[1:49:34] tonight? Oh, I'm singing Jesus got a

[1:49:58] sad. Now I'm just free and glad singing
[1:50:04] Jesus
[1:50:06] God and he won't let me go.
[1:50:11] Well, when I first fell in love with
[1:50:15] Jesus, well, I gave him all of my
[1:50:19] heart and I thought I couldn't love him
[1:50:24] more. But then I did right from the
[1:50:28] start. Cuz I look back over the
[1:50:32] mountains and the valleys where I've
[1:50:37] been. And it makes me know that I love
[1:50:41] him so much more than I did then. Well,
[1:50:45] I keep falling in love with him over and
[1:50:50] over and over and over again.
[1:50:54] I keep falling in love with him over and
[1:50:58] over and over and over again. Oh, he
[1:51:03] gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go
[1:51:07] by. Oh, what a love between my Lord and
[1:51:11] I. I keep falling in love with him over
[1:51:15] and over and over and over again. Well,
[1:51:19] there's a sand that I hold on to through
[1:51:24] each valley and each
[1:51:27] trial. And there's a shoulder that I
[1:51:31] lean upon as I face another
[1:51:35] mile. And there's a love that I can
[1:51:39] depend on. Oh, it's fresh and new each
[1:51:44] day. and with loving it is
[1:51:48] overflowing. And this is why I say well
