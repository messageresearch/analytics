[50:52] amen amen so if you will stand with to
[50:55] the word this
[50:57] morning let's bow our heads first Lord
[51:01] Jesus the prophet has taught us to
[51:04] always talk to Au of the word first ask
[51:07] for
[51:08] divine uh interpretation so to
[51:12] speak knowing god that it'll take your
[51:14] Holy Spirit to really open the word to
[51:16] our heart we can might know it in our
[51:18] minds it takes you to open it to our
[51:21] hearts so that we can really be changed
[51:23] and go from here different than what we
[51:26] come are goal and our mission is always
[51:28] to leave better than we came no matter
[51:31] father we just ask God that you'll just
[51:34] bless each one that has come this
[51:36] morning Father receive something special
[51:38] from you today as only you can give Lord
[51:41] Jesus for we know that when you speak
[51:43] Lord you make make a difference and you
[51:45] will maybe those coming from the road to
[51:49] us did not a heart burn within us as he
[51:52] spoke to us along the way Lord and we
[51:54] believe you're the same yesterday today
[51:56] and forever and I ask God you would just
[51:58] help me God to get out of the way step
[52:00] aside and let you operate Lord Jesus
[52:02] Through heart mind and lips Lord Jesus
[52:05] the things that you once said to your
[52:07] people keep me from saying anything in
[52:09] myself or that I shouldn't
[52:11] say name we ask amen and amen so I kind
[52:16] of feel like I've gone a on a little
[52:19] series anyway we'll just see how far it
[52:20] goes but amen I just I called it amen
[52:24] the gospel in the nutshell we want to
[52:26] just B kind of go over the whole scope
[52:29] of the whole Bible amen the whole thing
[52:31] amen and just kind of follow the
[52:33] inspiration of the Lord because we know
[52:35] that there's much there all right amen
[52:38] and so we just pray God will help us to
[52:41] uh you know to go and follow his way
[52:43] that he wants to go and amen and so I
[52:47] think
[52:49] amen talk a little bit about the power
[52:52] of knowledge knowledge being power ain't
[52:54] that right and so so we want to kind of
[52:58] pick up on that and maybe recap on it
[52:59] just a little bit but basically I felt
[53:03] like titling it Power by
[53:06] identification Power by
[53:08] identification
[53:10] amen so if you will let's go to our
[53:14] originales I guess over
[53:19] in First
[53:21] Corinthians First Corinthians I believe
[53:23] it is
[53:30] I don't have a ink pen or do I yeah I
[53:32] got an ink pen here I want to try to
[53:35] make these scriptures as I go through
[53:37] them amen First
[53:42] Corinthians and verse six how be it we
[53:45] speak wisdom among them that are perfect
[53:48] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[53:51] the princes of this world that come to
[53:53] not but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[53:55] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[53:58] ordained before the world unto our glory
[54:03] amen isn't that something that God said
[54:06] the hidden wisdom that he had stored up
[54:08] and kept secret was For Your Glory how
[54:12] many believe that that's For Your
[54:14] Glory it's yours not the world's it's
[54:17] yours and it's for you Amen in Ephesians
[54:22] also in
[54:23] Ephesians amen 1
[54:30] and we'll be begin with verse n having
[54:35] having made known un unto us the mystery
[54:37] of his will according to the good
[54:40] pleasure which he hath purposed in
[54:43] himself amen that in the dispensation of
[54:47] the fullness of times he might gather
[54:48] together in one all things in Christ
[54:51] both which are in heaven and which are
[54:52] in Earth even in him Amen in whom all
[54:56] Alo we have obtained an inheritance
[54:59] being predestinated according to to the
[55:02] purpose of him who worketh all things
[55:04] after the counsel of his own will that
[55:08] we should be to the praise of his glory
[55:10] who first trusted in Christ may God add
[55:12] His blessings to the reading of the word
[55:14] you can be seated amen I think we made
[55:17] it also clear
[55:23] um in in Wednesday
[55:27] 3 uh n it says and to make all men see
[55:30] what of The Fellowship of the
[55:33] mystery which from the beginning the
[55:35] world have been hid in God who created
[55:38] All Things by Jesus Christ amen that now
[55:42] unto Heavenly places and powers in
[55:44] Heavenly places might be made known by
[55:47] the church
[55:48] amen by the church to wisdom of God Amen
[55:54] praise the Lord
[56:01] amen amen so we see a hidden wisdom here
[56:05] amen that God has had kept secret for
[56:09] ages and ages and ages amen and with
[56:12] this wisdom or this
[56:14] knowledge uh and we might think of well
[56:18] what about Revelation brother berer what
[56:20] about Revelation it's more important to
[56:22] have Revelation than it is knowledge
[56:24] well Revelation is
[56:26] knowledge Revelation is knowledge
[56:29] because brother Bram said a revelation
[56:31] is something means something that was
[56:33] previously hid or covered but now it's
[56:36] uncovered and now you know now you have
[56:39] the knowledge of what's back there amen
[56:41] amen and so when that comes forth amen
[56:44] when that is made known it gives you
[56:47] power it gives you amen authority over
[56:49] the devil there's different aspects of
[56:51] that knowledge that knowledge can also
[56:53] be experienced amen because we learn
[56:56] through the School of Hard Knocks or
[56:59] amen Simply Having God come down away
[57:02] amen as every every son and daughter of
[57:04] God has to have a personal experience
[57:07] with almighty God Amen because if you
[57:10] don't have that personal experience you
[57:12] really don't have the knowledge of Jesus
[57:14] Christ amen
[57:18] amen we're living in quite an age aren't
[57:21] we quite an age it's quite something how
[57:25] to uh um I believe it was when John the
[57:29] Revelator had given the Book of
[57:32] Revelations and he wrote it isn't that
[57:35] right but he was told to seal it up amen
[57:38] and write it is that right there's a
[57:40] certain portion of it that he couldn't
[57:42] even
[57:43] right amen now how many knows what that
[57:47] was the seven SE ain't that right the
[57:50] Seven Seals he was forbidden to write
[57:52] just what it was amen and it was going
[57:55] to be revealed by the voice of the
[57:57] seventh
[57:58] angel so when we look at the knowledge
[58:00] of God begin to understand what uh what
[58:03] was in the mind of God Amen and uh and
[58:08] sometimes you think well this is
[58:09] something that we have learned and we're
[58:11] kind of past that sometimes when it
[58:13] comes to the church ages right there we
[58:16] think well the church ages that's
[58:17] something that's in the past you know or
[58:21] it's you know we're not into the church
[58:22] ages anymore we're in the bride age
[58:24] we've been called out of Leo
[58:27] but we know the prophet said the Leia
[58:28] age in the actual time goes all the way
[58:30] to the end it is the last age is that
[58:33] right amen but you know as I begin to
[58:35] study on this subject I begin to think
[58:38] of how much how much and really you
[58:40] could call this a uh uh Power being
[58:43] released through knowledge part two but
[58:45] I I named it something else because I
[58:47] want to kind of go in a different
[58:48] direction for a little while if I can
[58:50] with the help of the
[58:51] Lord
[58:53] amen I shouldn't have said that now I
[58:55] forgot my thought all
[58:58] right yes and I begin to think you know
[59:01] that's kind of in the past but you know
[59:03] uh there's this
[59:06] God it the seals in the church had to be
[59:09] something
[59:11] special it was something special for God
[59:14] to hide it and to keep it until the very
[59:17] end like what we have
[59:22] amen
[59:24] amen and it was only going to be opened
[59:27] hour now I've I think everybody here
[59:30] knows that taught that with the fullness
[59:32] of the word comes the fullness of the
[59:35] spirit right amen one place brother Dale
[59:38] Potter he said you know he thought he
[59:39] was born again he had a word birth but
[59:42] brother B one talked about you can't
[59:43] have a word full word birth until the
[59:45] full word
[59:47] comes know so even he was was kind of
[59:50] stifling cuz he thought you know until
[59:51] you have the full word come can't have a
[59:54] full birth amen and so like Luther sure
[59:58] you know he had a certain portion of the
[1:00:00] word but he had just shall walk by
[1:00:05] faith amen wednes T night we got touched
[1:00:08] on a have time to go into it I want to
[1:00:11] go into it just now even because it
[1:00:13] comes back to mind but we realize that
[1:00:16] as knowledge opens up power opens up
[1:00:20] there's power in understanding power uh
[1:00:23] in in in know knowledge power and that
[1:00:26] might begin to in my mind it got my mind
[1:00:28] went back to amen how that you know
[1:00:32] these these phones right here amen how
[1:00:34] they started out amen and how they used
[1:00:36] to communicate through what they called
[1:00:39] the telegraph system ain't that right
[1:00:42] amen they used to be able to lines and
[1:00:44] polls and everything and and and and
[1:00:46] they used to use Morris code right well
[1:00:50] I guess they did I wasn't sure so I
[1:00:51] asked Siri and this is what she told me
[1:00:53] okay she said developed in the beginning
[1:00:56] of the
[1:00:58] 1830s a telegraph line was a
[1:01:00] person-to-person textt message system
[1:01:03] consisted of multiple tele graph offices
[1:01:06] linked by an overhead wire supported to
[1:01:09] to Telegraph pulls to send the message
[1:01:12] an operator at an office would tap on a
[1:01:15] switch called a telegraph key creating
[1:01:17] pulses of electric current which spelled
[1:01:20] out a message in moris code amen so
[1:01:25] imagine that that that's the way they
[1:01:26] communicated and send the message was
[1:01:29] tap tap tap tap tap tap
[1:01:33] tap that's how this started out is that
[1:01:36] right and I thought that's kind of like
[1:01:38] Luther it was wonderful it was powerful
[1:01:40] that shall walk by faith they shall live
[1:01:42] by faith but how many know we've come so
[1:01:45] much further than
[1:01:47] that so much further but they ask if
[1:01:51] they could run those lines they didn't
[1:01:52] have to send mail
[1:01:54] anymore they could just Telegraph it you
[1:01:57] know and how many remembers that when
[1:01:58] you begin to actually get your uh phones
[1:02:01] and I don't know if it's brother Joe
[1:02:02] Adams Brother Brad or who it was but
[1:02:04] mention the old dialup phones you dial
[1:02:06] up and go wait until they come back wait
[1:02:09] till they come back wait till they come
[1:02:10] back and and at one time we remember how
[1:02:12] that in the to have a make a phone calls
[1:02:15] they would have operators right and the
[1:02:18] from what I understand seeing a picture
[1:02:20] somewhere in it I suppose it's right
[1:02:21] they would pull this wire out and this
[1:02:23] wire out and push it in here and you
[1:02:24] want to go over here or you want and
[1:02:26] they had to plug you
[1:02:28] in so that you can communicate with
[1:02:31] [Laughter]
[1:02:34] people folks I'm here to tell you about
[1:02:37] how it is with Catholicism and am me all
[1:02:39] the religions you know you got to go
[1:02:41] through me before you can get to CH man
[1:02:44] you got to go through this or do this in
[1:02:46] order to be in Christ no no not anymore
[1:02:49] Jesus is a mediator between God and man
[1:02:52] I don't care where you are you can talk
[1:02:54] to him anytime you don't have to have
[1:02:56] your pastor to talk to him amen thank
[1:02:59] the Lord ain't that right praise the
[1:03:01] Lord and so we think about that think
[1:03:03] about how that back in the old days you
[1:03:05] know we used to think that you know Mars
[1:03:07] Cod d d d you know try to get a message
[1:03:09] across it's almost like amen being Amish
[1:03:12] and they says boy I'll tell you what if
[1:03:13] you ain't Amish you going to hell well
[1:03:16] how that well tell me why I'm I'm going
[1:03:19] to hell or being menite or all this that
[1:03:20] or the other we've come much further
[1:03:22] than that we're much more precise than
[1:03:25] that but a brandham even said belonging
[1:03:27] to church ain't going to save you there
[1:03:29] ain't no church going to save you
[1:03:30] there's only one place to get saved that
[1:03:33] is in the Jesus Christ the son of the
[1:03:35] Living God there's no other name given
[1:03:37] under heaven whereby you must be
[1:03:40] saved I like that don't
[1:03:42] you praise the lord we think about all
[1:03:45] of those things all of the things that
[1:03:46] has been let loose and all the knowledge
[1:03:48] that has been increased we realize that
[1:03:50] there is a knowledge that has been
[1:03:52] increased in the natural world and
[1:03:54] brother brandham said the natural always
[1:03:56] types the spiritual Amen in power and
[1:03:59] everything what they can do and how they
[1:04:01] can how they can get around and so forth
[1:04:03] and is in the spiritual
[1:04:06] realm amen praise the Lord so we don't
[1:04:10] want to be in the horse and buggy age
[1:04:11] anymore is that right Amen brother bam
[1:04:14] if you'll remember most of you all
[1:04:16] understand the the message know that
[1:04:17] brother bam typed the uh the pro the
[1:04:20] progression of the Gospel amen as being
[1:04:23] in the type of a the fullness of Christ
[1:04:26] Christ in the form of a man coming back
[1:04:28] up that Luther was the feet Wesley was
[1:04:30] the chest area isn't that right y'all
[1:04:32] remember that wesle his chest
[1:04:35] magnification of the heart you know and
[1:04:37] they come along to speaking in tongues
[1:04:39] amen comes all the way up here and now
[1:04:42] we're way up Tong's age amen and then
[1:04:45] what was after
[1:04:46] Pentecost oh a prophet is here that
[1:04:50] could tell you what color hair Eve had
[1:04:53] that could tell you interpretation of
[1:04:56] the gospel of Christ amen no more than
[1:04:59] none of that but how many know that
[1:05:00] we're past even even mentioned being
[1:05:02] past that age that's not the last age
[1:05:06] that's not the last thing because what
[1:05:07] is above that what is above the eye the
[1:05:12] brain the mind what we call the Mind
[1:05:16] ain't that right and we're in the mind
[1:05:21] age amen now we're ready to preach
[1:05:25] we're in the mind age folks amen praise
[1:05:29] be to God Amen now let's look at this
[1:05:32] let's look at um and I want to look at
[1:05:35] with the help of the Lord and boy I feel
[1:05:36] like I just do a horrible job at it and
[1:05:38] my wife don't like when I demean myself
[1:05:40] up but I still when I realize how much
[1:05:44] better it could be we just do the best
[1:05:46] we can is that all
[1:05:48] right but as we think about this and we
[1:05:50] think about the the phrase that we say
[1:05:53] that with the fullness of the word comes
[1:05:55] the fullness of power isn't that right
[1:05:58] well you know that's just one phrase
[1:06:00] tell me brother B tell me how it is that
[1:06:02] with the fullness of the
[1:06:04] word power or it gives you amen the the
[1:06:08] the weapons to fight the devil
[1:06:13] withen and I want to try to take a
[1:06:15] couple of those things if I can this
[1:06:17] morning before communion and look
[1:06:19] at amen that actually gives us
[1:06:22] Authority ain't that right over the
[1:06:25] devil
[1:06:28] all right so before I go on the M I'm
[1:06:29] going to I'm going to jump back to
[1:06:30] something else that comes to my mind
[1:06:32] amen and and I'm going to go back
[1:06:35] another step because I think of
[1:06:36] something else that okay and amen and I
[1:06:38] want want if I
[1:06:40] can wow wow wow all right here we
[1:06:47] go must be right here when I started
[1:06:51] this series this is the quote that come
[1:06:53] to my mind when I thought about God in a
[1:06:55] nutshell and and the scope of it all
[1:06:57] amen so this is the quote that come to
[1:07:00] my mind amen think about God and what he
[1:07:02] had in his mind what his purpose was
[1:07:05] like we've read though what was the
[1:07:07] purpose of God that he uh does
[1:07:10] everything according to the counsel of
[1:07:12] his own will how many knows this is
[1:07:14] God's
[1:07:16] plan amen the thing about God in the
[1:07:19] mind of God is is we got to look at what
[1:07:21] God's plan
[1:07:22] is amen and what the what the whole
[1:07:24] thing is this is just a little fraction
[1:07:26] that I want to share it with you he says
[1:07:28] now here in is the love of God he
[1:07:30] desired in love a family of his own I
[1:07:34] mean know that's what God had in mind
[1:07:36] God wanted a family of his own a family
[1:07:39] of Sons Sons like
[1:07:42] himself amen we'll pull up on that like
[1:07:45] himself how many know we were
[1:07:46] predestinated to be conformed to the
[1:07:48] image of his son now when we go back
[1:07:51] into the identification in a little bit
[1:07:53] we'll talk about how that God puts a
[1:07:55] desire of in us to be be like somebody
[1:07:58] okay Amen to be like himself that Sons
[1:08:01] like himself therefore before him lies
[1:08:03] all of mankind as one lump of clay out
[1:08:06] of that same lump he will now make
[1:08:07] vessels of honor and the choosing will
[1:08:10] be his own choosing then those chosen
[1:08:12] ones that are born of his spirit will be
[1:08:15] trained to conform to the image of uh in
[1:08:18] their
[1:08:19] walk amen how many it in the nutshell is
[1:08:22] that God wants you to be a son he wants
[1:08:24] you to be and he wants you to learn and
[1:08:27] he wants you to grow into the stature of
[1:08:30] Christ that's ambition that's his
[1:08:34] goal that's why troubles that's why
[1:08:36] trials that's why tests that's why all
[1:08:38] of these things are that's the main
[1:08:39] ambition was he wants children just like
[1:08:42] what sitting with your children with
[1:08:44] this morning that was what God had in
[1:08:48] mind now it wasn't luy and City it
[1:08:51] wasn't Adam and Steve it wasn't no he
[1:08:53] didn't have all of that message
[1:08:58] right no he had a family a man and his
[1:09:01] woman they shall be joined to each other
[1:09:03] and and the making of a
[1:09:04] home that's what he had in mind but this
[1:09:07] is the quote that came to me as this
[1:09:09] series amen he reproves with all
[1:09:12] longsuffering with gentleness and mercy
[1:09:14] who chastens with nails SC
[1:09:16] hands spotter must take the vessel that
[1:09:19] he is working on and thoroughly break it
[1:09:20] down in order that he may rebuild it
[1:09:23] just exactly as he desired but it is
[1:09:25] love that is love another way of Love
[1:09:28] there is
[1:09:29] not praise be to
[1:09:32] God
[1:09:34] Amen
[1:09:37] Hallelujah
[1:09:39] now let's talk
[1:09:42] about the
[1:09:44] opening God bringing us the seven Church
[1:09:48] ages God bringing us and showing us the
[1:09:53] seals what it really was
[1:09:57] I believe that it released a
[1:10:00] power in his
[1:10:07] church
[1:10:09] amen look what was once in God's what
[1:10:14] was once God's secret great mysterious
[1:10:18] Secret in his
[1:10:19] mind is now put into the hearts of
[1:10:22] believers
[1:10:26] woo aren't you glad that what he had in
[1:10:29] his
[1:10:30] mind what was in the back part brother B
[1:10:33] called it back part of God's mind is now
[1:10:37] and the
[1:10:42] Believers
[1:10:45] amen that is the body of Christ which
[1:10:48] was and he says it again what was God's
[1:10:51] once great Secret in his mind before the
[1:10:53] foundation of the world is now made made
[1:10:55] manifest to think friends I'm sure that
[1:10:58] we don't get it I just can't see it we
[1:11:01] don't see it the way that we ought to
[1:11:03] I'm sure that we don't amen but God's
[1:11:07] mystery what the Eternal God had as a
[1:11:09] mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus
[1:11:12] Christ and it was given down to his
[1:11:14] church to manifold wisdom of God once in
[1:11:17] God's mind is now in the body of Christ
[1:11:20] says it again he's making love to his
[1:11:22] church his bride whispering secrets to
[1:11:27] her I want say Whispering secrets to her
[1:11:31] but he is giving her the weapon that she
[1:11:34] needs the devil in this
[1:11:40] hour praise be to
[1:11:43] God very familiar quote that we know but
[1:11:46] I want to read it again when we think
[1:11:48] about the church as well we don't think
[1:11:50] we can't just look it at as well you
[1:11:53] know the church page I message some
[1:11:55] people don't even believe in the church
[1:11:57] age book but brother BR that just never
[1:11:59] disallowed it hello and I believe God
[1:12:03] Vindicated it amen so listen Satan knows
[1:12:07] assured that the original church at
[1:12:09] Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16
[1:12:12] in action is the true church that Jesus
[1:12:16] claimed as his
[1:12:18] own praise the Lord I want to here's one
[1:12:22] of the weapons here's one of the things
[1:12:24] that I that because of the opening of
[1:12:26] the church age because of the opening of
[1:12:28] the seals amen the releasing of
[1:12:30] knowledge also releases power here's the
[1:12:33] first point I want to make you might not
[1:12:35] think so but I will bring it out let me
[1:12:37] show you another reason why Satan hates
[1:12:39] This Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:12:41] in the church he knows that Jesus is the
[1:12:43] same yesterday today and forever and he
[1:12:47] changes not how many knows that our
[1:12:50] messeng amen his theme was that Jesus is
[1:12:54] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:12:58] when you take that and you don't believe
[1:13:00] that the days of Miracles has passed the
[1:13:02] Holy Ghost wasn't just for the book of
[1:13:03] Acts and then people back then no but
[1:13:05] he's the same that gives you power to
[1:13:08] know that God is with you where you are
[1:13:11] wherever you're working whatever is he's
[1:13:13] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:13:16] the devil will be defeated because you
[1:13:18] believe
[1:13:22] that amen praise the Lord he knows it
[1:13:25] more than a lot of 90% of Theologian he
[1:13:28] knows that since God is immutable in his
[1:13:30] nature he is just as immutable in his
[1:13:33] ways amen then he says Satan knows
[1:13:36] assuredly that God is coming for a Mark
[1:13:38] 16 and
[1:13:40] amen this is the true church that she
[1:13:43] claims for all else is listen to this
[1:13:46] now he makes two points he says the true
[1:13:49] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:13:53] Acts
[1:13:55] amen Our foref Father wasn't Martin
[1:13:57] Luther John Wesley or that it was God
[1:14:00] all the way back to the bu acts we are
[1:14:03] continuation of the book of
[1:14:06] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[1:14:10] that the Antichrist spirit and what he
[1:14:13] would do that he would come in amen and
[1:14:16] try to make the he would try to make
[1:14:19] defile it make it lukewarm formal and
[1:14:23] Powerless how many know to learn to T
[1:14:26] that once you've been given the
[1:14:27] instruction once you have been informed
[1:14:29] once you have the knowledge of how the
[1:14:31] devil works and how did he punch us amen
[1:14:33] when that punch comes you can counteract
[1:14:35] that punch and knock him out amen but
[1:14:39] you got to know how the devil works and
[1:14:42] that's what Revelation does that's what
[1:14:44] knowledge of God does add to your virtue
[1:14:48] knowledge amen knowing right from wrong
[1:14:51] knowing the
[1:14:53] scriptures how me
[1:14:56] Godly knowledge of the word of God is
[1:15:02] important that's
[1:15:04] right amen so this church ages isn't
[1:15:07] over it's still giving us the power amen
[1:15:11] just if you want to know how just read
[1:15:13] the
[1:15:14] instruction say that a lot would that be
[1:15:16] okay if you want to know how to overcome
[1:15:19] the greatest battle ever fought if you
[1:15:21] want to know what the battle really is
[1:15:23] and where it is read that book if you
[1:15:25] want more faith in God we read perfect
[1:15:28] Faith amen that's what it means whenever
[1:15:31] you talk about with the fullness of the
[1:15:33] word comes fullness of power amen when
[1:15:36] that message come and it reveals things
[1:15:38] it gives you power but you can't just
[1:15:40] leave it in the on the shelves or on the
[1:15:42] book on the tapes you've got to tap into
[1:15:45] it cuz there's rapturing faith in this
[1:15:48] message hello but the B said there's
[1:15:51] untapped resources amen and there's
[1:15:53] rapturing Faith so I believe believe
[1:15:55] that in this message lays rapturing
[1:15:58] faith on the way to church I was
[1:16:00] thinking you know if you want to be
[1:16:01] dressed if you want to get dressed for
[1:16:02] the Rapture if you want to be dressed as
[1:16:04] the bride the brother B said I am
[1:16:06] dressing the bride this message dresses
[1:16:09] the bride this message bring ready for
[1:16:11] the
[1:16:16] Rapture praise the Lord GL to God we
[1:16:20] thank him for that otherwise we would be
[1:16:22] in Sodom we would be made like a gamorra
[1:16:26] amen we would be committing the sins of
[1:16:28] that great Harlot but we heard The Voice
[1:16:30] come out of her my
[1:16:33] people that you receive not of her
[1:16:36] plagues that you partake not of her
[1:16:45] sins I'm G say like Brother Brad let's
[1:16:48] just for time for a while it jumps at me
[1:16:51] you know you got communion you got to
[1:16:53] cut this short you'll never get through
[1:16:54] this get on back out of there devil
[1:16:56] we're going to take all day if he takes
[1:16:58] that amen we probably won't but we'll at
[1:17:01] have that mentality is all right all
[1:17:03] right amen all right praise the Lord God
[1:17:07] is good isn't he I like that exposes
[1:17:10] listen Revelation exposes the devil and
[1:17:14] he don't like that the word exposes the
[1:17:17] devil the seals exposed the devil and
[1:17:20] how he worked all and how he's working
[1:17:22] even today
[1:17:26] amen people will try to deceive the
[1:17:28] whole world but what gives us power amen
[1:17:32] is this this knowledge that God given to
[1:17:35] us first of all the Holy Ghost amen the
[1:17:39] need of the Holy Ghost it exposes Satan
[1:17:42] revealing his Works attempted
[1:17:44] destruction of God's people editing of
[1:17:47] God's word right down to the time that
[1:17:50] he is cast into the Lake of Fire he
[1:17:52] fights that he cannot stand it he knows
[1:17:55] that if the people get true revelation
[1:17:57] of the true church and what she is and
[1:18:00] what she stands for that she can do the
[1:18:04] greater
[1:18:05] work I like that but I'm here to tell
[1:18:08] you if you got little Revelation amen
[1:18:10] knowledge that'll give you a little
[1:18:11] power that word says that you can do the
[1:18:15] Greater
[1:18:17] Works not brother not Ron Spencer not
[1:18:20] Donnie Reagan not no you can do the
[1:18:22] Greater Works everyone none of a
[1:18:25] Believer can do the Greater Works all
[1:18:28] things are possible in that
[1:18:32] believe that that's right oh my listen
[1:18:38] what she stands for she can do the work
[1:18:40] Greater Works she will be an invincible
[1:18:48] Army Invincible stoppable like culos it
[1:18:53] don't matter how many many
[1:18:55] them he chopped them all out should I
[1:18:57] say Samson would be a better example it
[1:18:59] don't matter how many was
[1:19:03] invincible what this church this is what
[1:19:05] this Revelation this is what the
[1:19:07] knowledge of God the opening of the seal
[1:19:09] so for the church ages does it makes it
[1:19:11] where you you really want to
[1:19:13] be you can be
[1:19:16] Invincible but I believe that we got to
[1:19:18] have a perfect strength by Perfect
[1:19:20] weakness where the B says well we forget
[1:19:22] our own abilities and we die to
[1:19:24] ourselves and realize that it's God you
[1:19:28] that he's more than able to do the
[1:19:31] work we've got to have a little bit of
[1:19:33] total

[1:19:36] gives complete Victory God gives

[1:22:10] Victory how do we
[1:22:15] overcome By The Sword of the
[1:22:18] spirit amen the sword of the spirit I
[1:22:22] didn't a revelation of this until some
[1:22:25] time
[1:22:27] ago
[1:22:34] amen he was talking in Ephesians 5
[1:22:37] talking about finally my brethren be
[1:22:38] strong in the Lord in the power of His
[1:22:40] might put on the whole AR that you may
[1:22:42] be able to stand against the Ws of the
[1:22:45] devil and so forth take the whole helmet
[1:22:47] of salvation and so forth and above all
[1:22:50] take the shield of Faith wherewith ye
[1:22:52] shall be able to all the fiery dark
[1:22:55] of the flesh or the wicked ain't that
[1:22:58] right yeah by having the faith of God in
[1:23:02] your heart it Shields you from the fiery
[1:23:06] Darks of the enemy everything he throws
[1:23:08] at you how many knows that Shield of
[1:23:10] Faith really protects you from a lot of
[1:23:13] garbage a lot of
[1:23:20] mess but the point I want to make is in
[1:23:22] verse 17 and take helmet of and the
[1:23:26] sword of the
[1:23:29] spirit now in our minds we've been
[1:23:33] taught a lot about
[1:23:35] knowledge
[1:23:39] Faith or the word of
[1:23:41] God knowledge word of
[1:23:44] God letter by itself
[1:23:48] dead huh but it takes the spirit to
[1:23:51] Quicken it I mean is it two-part
[1:23:59] amen and sometimes we realize that
[1:24:03] perhaps it's like the mechanics and the
[1:24:06] Dynamics maybe you know all the
[1:24:08] Dynamics but you need I mean you know
[1:24:11] all the
[1:24:12] mechanics but don't have the Dynamics
[1:24:15] well what if you have all
[1:24:18] spirit all spirit and no
[1:24:22] mechanics now didn't brother say Jesus
[1:24:25] didn't try to defeat the Devil with
[1:24:27] speaking in tongues or using his
[1:24:30] gifts he didn't try to use him oh I feel
[1:24:33] it whenever the Devil Comes you and and
[1:24:36] you need to overcome this Lord I want to
[1:24:38] feel it is that what you
[1:24:41] use no you don't go by
[1:24:44] emotion what do you
[1:24:46] use
[1:24:47] mechanics the word is that right the
[1:24:51] spirit is the Dynamics the word it's the
[1:24:54] mechanics I'll tell you what you go out
[1:24:56] there throw a gallon of gasoline on the
[1:24:59] grass and light it and boom it just
[1:25:01] burns out and it it barely even Puffs
[1:25:04] huh but you take and you run that gas
[1:25:07] through a motor into a motor into a
[1:25:09] cylinder and just one
[1:25:11] little as you pick put the gas pedal
[1:25:13] down there one little squirt in that one
[1:25:16] in that uh piston chamber isn't that
[1:25:18] right from what I little I understand
[1:25:20] about mechanics and it pushes that
[1:25:22] piston up the compression of that gas
[1:25:24] push pissing up and all of six or 16
[1:25:27] cylinders amen they putting gas not too
[1:25:30] much just enough to make that pop up and
[1:25:32] get your engine running that gas that
[1:25:35] just you know people huah praise the
[1:25:38] Lord I like all of that but put that but
[1:25:40] say sometimes we need to take some of
[1:25:42] that power and that that that Steam and
[1:25:46] then make the engine go instead of
[1:25:47] blowing it all out the
[1:25:52] whistle oh I like the whistle
[1:25:55] but we got to put it into action ain't
[1:25:57] that right put it into engine and the
[1:25:59] way that you live every day when you go
[1:26:02] to the job the way you treat your wife
[1:26:04] the way you treat your husband the way
[1:26:05] you treat your neighbors the way you
[1:26:06] treat your workers how faithful you are
[1:26:09] in church and how dedicated you are come
[1:26:11] on
[1:26:11] people how much you pray amen take some
[1:26:14] of the Dynamics and make it work with
[1:26:16] the mechanics amen and I'll tell you
[1:26:19] that's why the word of God that's been
[1:26:21] revealed is the mechanics and God gives
[1:26:24] all of this but if you don't know what
[1:26:25] to do you're still
[1:26:27] lost remember but says it's like one man
[1:26:30] has the money in the bank but he don't
[1:26:31] know how to write a
[1:26:33] check these said fundamentals they have
[1:26:35] money in the bank but they don't know
[1:26:36] how to write a check and the other one
[1:26:38] have all kinds of Mone because they got
[1:26:40] all kinds of money but they don't know
[1:26:41] how to ride
[1:26:42] it and me get them together get a bunch
[1:26:46] of money together and do
[1:26:48] that write out the check and know how to
[1:26:51] do it then you've got something it's it
[1:26:54] takes both amen ain't don't gas don't no
[1:26:57] good if you ain't got a car to driveing
[1:26:58] in Holy Spirit don't no good if you
[1:27:00] don't word to use on the
[1:27:02] devil it's also
[1:27:05] written
[1:27:07] amen Paul said in Ephesians say take the
[1:27:10] helmet of salvation of the spirit which
[1:27:13] is the sword of the spirit is the word
[1:27:16] of God that word is really
[1:27:20] cuts the word is what cuts hey amen so
[1:27:25] let's see if we can't just give a big
[1:27:27] old mouthful of this and let him choke
[1:27:29] on
[1:27:30] it all
[1:27:32] right
[1:27:36] amen so he says uh you know if we really
[1:27:39] get a true
[1:27:44] Revelation I I'm just G to go
[1:27:49] slow if they get a true revelation of
[1:27:51] the two Spirits within the framework of
[1:27:53] the Christian church
[1:27:54] and by God's spirit discern and with the
[1:27:57] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:27:59] powerless before here

[1:28:24] this come on folks Ain told you better
[1:28:27] discern the Antichrist Spirit the wrong
[1:28:30] spirit and if you discern it you know it
[1:28:32] you'll be able to guard against it but
[1:28:34] if you don't know what's going on you'll
[1:28:36] be caught up in that big bunch of gossip
[1:28:38] and you'll get all poisoned up

[1:30:18] these things is blind and cannot see a
[1:30:20] far off and hath forgotten that he was

[1:30:55] mistakes brother Brown said you'll
[1:30:57] always make mistakes as long as you have
[1:30:58] because it's this flesh always trips you
[1:31:00] up causes you to stumble but if you do
[1:31:03] things you'll never fall how many

[1:31:26] ready at any time whether camela gets in
[1:31:29] or whe whether she doesn't I believe the
[1:31:31] scripture is going to be fulfilled
[1:31:32] either way
[1:31:35] amen it would almost be more scary if
[1:31:38] she didn't get in amen because perhaps
[1:31:41] that scripture then is already fulfilled
[1:31:42] and the next thing's a
[1:31:44] fire for the world but it's for you and
[1:31:49] I

[1:32:05] have amen praise the
[1:32:09] Lord
[1:32:13] amen God Bible is a
[1:32:16] mirror a book of
[1:32:19] identification how many believes that
[1:32:21] that's the one thing another thing it is
[1:32:23] in this shell so to speak is it
[1:32:28] identifies it's a book of
[1:32:30] identification Jesus said a tree is
[1:32:32] known by its fruit and by their fruits
[1:32:36] ye shall know
[1:32:41] them if a man loves a man he's a
[1:32:44] sodomite he's identified as a sodomite
[1:32:48] we used to call them perverts because
[1:32:50] that's what they are I'll still call
[1:32:51] them that perverted
[1:32:57] amen I want to say something else is
[1:32:59] that okay a little bit political but not
[1:33:00] so much I'm sure brother Brandon would
[1:33:02] say it because he set the whole world go
[1:33:04] insane
[1:33:06] anyway anybody that thinks that
[1:33:09] biological males ought to play with
[1:33:12] biological females and that that is fair
[1:33:15] has lost their
[1:33:17] mind that's right you're crazy and you
[1:33:19] ought to be put in the Looney
[1:33:22] Bin half of our
[1:33:24] congressmen congresswomen off the Looney
[1:33:28] Bin that's right cuz that's crazy how
[1:33:30] many know is that right they've proven
[1:33:33] it physically and everything else amen
[1:33:36] the world has gone insane
[1:33:39] identify praise the Lord even Jesus said
[1:33:41] to the Pharisees you know you say that
[1:33:43] God R is uh the sky red and L you can
[1:33:46] discern the time but you can't discern
[1:33:48] the signs of the time and you say that
[1:33:50] if we' have been in the days of our
[1:33:51] fathers we would not have been partakers
[1:33:53] no with them and killing and so forth
[1:33:56] but here you reject me and that right so
[1:33:59] you bear witness of yourselves that
[1:34:01] you're the children of them that the
[1:34:03] prophet Jesus identified
[1:34:06] them as being
[1:34:09] Hypocrites and anybody that says that
[1:34:11] they believe the Jesus of Calvary on
[1:34:14] Calvary and then rejects what he did
[1:34:16] today is also a
[1:34:20] hypocrite you can't reject him there I
[1:34:22] mean reject him here and say you accept
[1:34:24] him there Jesus plainly said what you do
[1:34:27] with him today is you to done with him
[1:34:30] back
[1:34:32] then it's a book of
[1:34:37] identification amen boy looking in that

[1:35:57] baptized in the name of Jesus in the
[1:35:59] name of Jesus Christ in the name of
[1:36:01] Jesus Christ you're not ashamed to be
[1:36:03] baptized and identified as a

[1:36:09] American like Brother Brad was saying
[1:36:11] you know we have that uh patriotic
[1:36:13] spirit so to speak we hate it hurts us

[1:36:24] try not to let any Pol politics bother
[1:36:26] me
[1:36:29] amen don't know whether I'll go down to
[1:36:31] the voting station or not everybody's
[1:36:33] welcome to do it if you want to no

[1:37:04] soldiers that gave their lives to take
[1:37:06] off Hitler and evil to keep evil out and
[1:37:10] now these younger people that'll go up
[1:37:11] and say well we were there too and we

[1:37:28] fought and died for our freedom and then
[1:37:30] they spurn it they're not worthy of
[1:37:34] it amen aggravate people that give their
[1:37:38] lives blood hello and then to have
[1:37:40] others come and just squander it what

[1:37:45] millions of 20 year olds that sacrific
[1:37:47] their lives so we could have freedom and
[1:37:49] then the others don't mind if people
[1:37:51] take it from them no wonder it would get
[1:37:54] the righteous or the indignation of
[1:37:55] somebody like that up a little bit

[1:47:14] became a word like this it was expressed
[1:47:17] a thought expressed is a word a word
[1:47:19] expressed is a thought and then remember
[1:47:21] if you was ever
[1:47:23] in God's thinking then you'll always be
[1:47:30] there punch that devil devil don't try
[1:47:34] to talk to me okay my Prophet told me

[1:47:53] you'll always be there if you've got
[1:47:55] eternal life talking about being born

[1:48:44] world that we should be holy and Without
[1:48:46] Blame before him in love how many can
[1:48:50] say amen that's me I am in him and I'm
[1:48:54] in love with him he predestinated you to
[1:48:57] be in love with
[1:49:01] God
[1:49:02] Amen having predestinated unto the
[1:49:05] adoption of children but Jesus Christ to
[1:49:06] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:49:08] of his will
[1:49:10] amen praise the
[1:49:12] Lord his thinking at the beginning the
[1:49:15] only thing that you are is an expressed
[1:49:17] word after he thought it he spoke it and

[1:49:39] minute and the only thing that you are
[1:49:41] is expressed word he's spoken here you
[1:49:43] are if it isn't if you wasn't in his
[1:49:47] thinking there's no way for at all for

[1:49:54] there for he's the one that gives
[1:49:56] eternal life it's not him that willth
[1:49:58] nor him that runneth but God that shows
[1:50:02] Mercy all right so we
[1:50:04] said if you wasn't any thinking there's
[1:50:07] no way that you'll ever be there the
[1:50:10] flip side of it is if you wasn't if you
[1:50:14] was thinking there's no way for you to
[1:50:17] ever not be there

[1:50:39] Assurance it takes the
[1:50:41] fear of being lost
[1:50:46] away amen how do we identify ourselves
[1:50:53] by whether or not his life and we are

[1:51:11] scripture for it sister Patty let's get
[1:51:14] it
[1:51:16] Revelation is the scripture for this

[1:51:29] in the book of the lamb slain from the
[1:51:33] foundation of the world if your name

[1:51:37] worship the
[1:51:39] Beast oh brothers and sisters I can't
[1:51:42] tell you how much important it is how
[1:51:44] great a thing it is is if you have a
[1:51:47] desire for God if you have a desire to
[1:51:49] want to be one of his children that's
[1:51:51] the greatest thing that you could ever
[1:51:54] have whosoever will whoever wants to
[1:51:57] whoever has a desire to come

[1:52:31] identified by The Works that they
[1:52:36] do it's scary
[1:52:38] sometimes Lord help us I want my Works
[1:52:41] to match this right here the good part
[1:52:44] of it if you have oh so exciting that's
[1:52:46] why it takes the fear and doubt out
[1:52:49] that's why it crushes the devil when you
[1:52:51] realize that not only am mean now you
[1:52:54] realize who you are it gives you
[1:52:56] authority over the devil but you know
[1:52:57] where you come from you realize when
[1:52:59] Joshua spoke to the son I was there with
[1:53:02] him when they crossed the Red Sea I was
[1:53:05] there with him when Jesus died on
[1:53:07] Calvary I was there with him when he
[1:53:09] raised from the dead I was there with
[1:53:11] him when he ascended I am there with
[1:53:14] him W how do you know better because we
[1:53:18] had hasn't begun a good work in me

[1:53:55] with a congregation is a touchy thing is
[1:53:58] that right you don't know just how it'll
[1:54:00] go I'm gonna say it while I'm saying it
[1:54:03] but I appreciate Brother Brad amen when
[1:54:07] he knows there's a discontent or
[1:54:08] something like that he comes to me and
[1:54:10] talks to me don't think that you're
[1:54:11] going to go to Brother Brad and tell him
[1:54:12] little secrets and stuff you're not no
[1:54:16] because he's behind the pastor
[1:54:19] okay amen you got to and it's important
[1:54:22] I believe as a church to remember that
[1:54:24] amen I want him doing everything he
[1:54:26] possibly can but there's some things
[1:54:28] that need to be brought to the pastor
[1:54:30] going through the pastor ain't that
[1:54:32] right and I appreciate
[1:54:34] that amen and so I I really really
[1:54:37] appreciate amen his ministry and having
[1:54:40] him here
[1:54:43] amen and basically getting to know
[1:54:46] brother Brad ain't that right we're
[1:54:48] still getting to know each other how we
[1:54:50] are how we feel what we think do we
[1:54:53] think amen just an
[1:54:56] honor amen God bless you
[1:55:01] okay little cap yet a little bit and
[1:55:04] want me to cap it off let me cap it off
[1:55:08] that's right when

[1:55:16] many please that I can feel it that's
[1:55:18] right that's that giant one of you bring
[1:55:21] him down

[1:55:25] that lukewarm devil that the devil tries

[1:55:50] top of your voice he wants you to serve
[1:55:51] him with everything you
[1:55:54] got woo when you realize brother
[1:55:58] Glenn when God was all by himself there
[1:56:01] was nothing else but God there was no
[1:56:03] stars a moon no galaxies
[1:56:06] nothing eons of time before time ever
[1:56:09] began you and I and you were there with
[1:56:17] him if that don't do a little something
[1:56:19] to you knowing you were there if you're
[1:56:22] born again and you have eternal life you
[1:56:25] were

[1:56:58] quote if you wasn't in his thinking
[1:57:01] there there ain't no way that you'll
[1:57:02] ever be that's enough to scare the liver
[1:57:06] out of anybody that's not a
[1:57:09] Christian H because you realize you're
[1:57:13] not a part of God if you ain't part of

[1:57:17] really
[1:57:19] doomed it thought to scar say God I hope
[1:57:23] if anybody would hear it out there and
[1:57:24] hear this said ask yourself if that
[1:57:27] voice in there in your heart says you
[1:57:29] know but I believe I'm one of his flee
[1:57:32] to the altar flee to God run as hard as
[1:57:35] you can I don't care who you got to run
[1:57:37] over so to
[1:57:38] speak but you get to God that's the
[1:57:42] greatest desire you could have is I want
[1:57:44] to be a Christian I want to serve God
[1:57:46] with all of my
[1:57:48] heart because that's God tugging him
[1:57:51] calling
[1:57:52] if you're elected how many beliefs if
[1:57:54] you're elected you'll
[1:57:56] come Thomas berer we don't stand and we
[1:57:58] aren't existing and continuing on simply
[1:58:01] because of our own power of our own
[1:58:03] ability know it was God that held us
[1:58:05] together brother Steve it was God that
[1:58:07] sustains us and I'm so happy that if I
[1:58:10] could shout louder than I ever have if I
[1:58:13] could scream louder than I ever have I
[1:58:15] want to say that when my savior calls I
[1:58:17] will answer when he calls for me I will

[1:58:30] be there if I was there I'm going to be
[1:58:33] there

[2:00:40] as good as being
[2:00:42] free and clean and living for the Lord
[2:00:46] and to know who you
[2:00:49] are I literally badly feel bad for those
[2:00:53] folks who don't know what they
[2:00:56] are you know they're probably just
[2:00:58] trying to figure it out their teachers
[2:01:01] confused them told them they were a

[2:01:23] love one another let the bond of Love
[2:01:25] tie us together and bind us together
[2:01:28] amen stand with
[2:01:35] me let's bow our
[2:01:37] heads how many would say in their hearts
[2:01:41] that you want the weapons that God gave
[2:01:43] us in this hour you want the word that
[2:01:46] you have to have to combat the devil in
[2:01:49] this hour through the message of the
[2:01:50] hour say God help me give me wisdom give
[2:01:52] me knowledge give me understanding and
[2:01:54] how to use the word when I need to use
[2:01:57] it I've got the spirit but I need to be
[2:02:00] able to cut that devil's head off when
[2:02:02] he comes at me because in using the word
[2:02:04] of the Bible of course and then the
[2:02:06] revealed word of the hour that really
[2:02:08] brought it out plain Lord Jesus you see
[2:02:10] all of our hands God I ask for so much
[2:02:12] more wisdom than what I have Lord
[2:02:14] understanding and be able to make so
[2:02:16] that the devil amen doesn't know what to
[2:02:18] do with us so that truly we would become
[2:02:21] an invincible Unstoppable Army Lord and
[2:02:24] like Paul said having done all to stand
[2:02:27] help us to stand this this evil day
[2:02:30] against all that's out there trying to
[2:02:32] rob us of our happiness trying to rob us
[2:02:35] of our joy and our peace and our
[2:02:40] Serenity our love that we have with you
[2:02:42] father we ask God that you'd help us
[2:02:44] Lord Jesus to thwart the enemy at every
[2:02:47] path at every Crossing so to speak so
[2:02:50] that we would stand firm and like Peter
[2:02:52] said so we would never fall help us not
[2:02:55] to stumble Lord as much as what we do
[2:02:57] Lord Jesus let our stumblings Be Few
[2:02:59] father and our mistakes few father help
[2:03:02] us Lord Jesus to grow closer and be
[2:03:04] closer to you bless the communion
[2:03:06] service now as we go into it and want to
[2:03:09] remember God that it all hinged on
[2:03:12] Calvary for your word has said that you
[2:03:14] was actually slain before the foundation
[2:03:16] of the world but you did that 2,000
[2:03:19] years ago Lord Jesus and you paid the
[2:03:21] price for us
[2:03:22] so that we could have this Fellowship
[2:03:24] that we have with you this morning and
[2:03:25] we thank you for it in Jesus name amen
