[52:31] pray
[52:32] it was pouring down rain and we just
[52:34] stood there and we prayed
[52:35] his Pentecost and he started speaking in
[52:38] tongues and one of our other volunteer
[52:40] fire department he came over and he was
[52:42] Baptist when he heard us prayed in him
[52:44] speaking in tongues he left
[52:47] but you know all that Mary had wrong
[52:49] with her she wore neck brace for three
[52:51] days and that was it
[52:53] because God
[52:54] is an ever-present health
[52:57] in the time of trouble
[52:59] you can say a lot of things and it won't
[53:02] do a bit of good but you can never pray
[53:04] that it won't do some good
[53:06] because our Prophet taught us he said
[53:07] there's one thing you can never do too
[53:09] much of he said let's pray
[53:12] so when somebody in this church comes on
[53:14] your heart you fall on your knees and
[53:16] you pray for them
[53:18] you know I got thinking we went out
[53:20] there at the store yesterday and had
[53:24] that time that brother Tommy had had on
[53:26] his heart and tried to witness for the
[53:28] Lord and I began to think I thought you
[53:31] know I come home yesterday I thought man
[53:32] what a refreshing day
[53:34] to be in the presence of brothers and
[53:37] all we talked about was the Lord I said
[53:39] wow what a refreshing day I just felt
[53:42] refreshed
[53:43] and then of course sister Martha and
[53:46] brother Irvin won't like this but I'm
[53:48] going to say it anyways and they fed me
[53:50] lunch and of course they wouldn't take
[53:52] no money and it was good
[53:54] and uh I knew they wasn't going to take
[53:56] nothing because if I'd have been going
[53:57] to build it I would have put a lot more
[53:59] on it because I like a big sandwich
[54:02] and I thought you know you can't take
[54:04] advantage of someone that's being nice
[54:06] to you so I just was happy but when I
[54:09] build one at home it's I don't know if
[54:10] y'all ever seen those the comics that
[54:12] the Dagwood sandwiches about this tall
[54:14] that's me but I did appreciate brother
[54:16] Irvin and them and their Hospitality
[54:18] they're always so nice and
[54:20] you just about have to fight them to
[54:22] make them take money if you get anything
[54:24] in that store
[54:25] and I pray the Lord
[54:27] bless you
[54:30] I really appreciate all they do for the
[54:32] service of the Lord don't you and let's
[54:34] give them a hand this morning

[59:47] maybe an update amen so we all know
[59:49] where it's at amen amen as we watch the
[59:52] Lord do miracles for her amen so if she
[59:55] would just give us a little testimony
[59:57] this morning and give us a report on
[59:59] things
[1:00:00] amen
[1:00:01] thank you uh first I want to I do better
[1:00:04] singing than I do talking so sorry
[1:00:07] um first of all I'm at peace
[1:00:10] God's given me peace that's something I
[1:00:12] never thought I would say when I hear
[1:00:14] bad news about me my first thought
[1:00:16] usually is that okay it's bad I'm gonna
[1:00:18] I'm gonna have to die and nobody cares
[1:00:20] but because I know God and God's given
[1:00:23] me the peace that I I really need and
[1:00:25] I'm I'm very much at peace with whatever
[1:00:27] happens
[1:00:29] um I went to the hospital probably about
[1:00:32] a week and a half ago and they had found
[1:00:35] a mass on my colon two masses uh in two
[1:00:38] separate spots and I was asked but all I
[1:00:42] said that I needed to see a doctor asap
[1:00:45] and because he thought he might have
[1:00:46] been metastasized is that how you said
[1:00:48] and um so I was able to get the doctor
[1:00:51] the next morning I got to see her and
[1:00:54] then she referred me to a surgeon who I
[1:00:57] got to see two days later so everything
[1:00:59] went very quickly the surgeon decided
[1:01:02] that instead of a biopsy right away he
[1:01:05] wants to do a colonoscopy and in that
[1:01:07] colonoscopy if he can find a piece of
[1:01:09] that mess he'll go ahead and snip it
[1:01:12] I'll stay all night at the hospital and
[1:01:13] then they'll do a biopsy if you cannot
[1:01:16] get it then I'll have to go back a few
[1:01:17] days later and have the biopsy
[1:01:20] um but his options have been that if
[1:01:24] it's not cancer then he'll just probably
[1:01:26] take a piece of take him out and that's
[1:01:28] it if it is cancer and I'm not afraid of
[1:01:30] that word
[1:01:31] um then he will have to do a uh he's
[1:01:34] going to uh give me some chemo to help
[1:01:37] shrink everything down so he might be
[1:01:39] able to take it out that way I'm at
[1:01:41] peace because I know God's with me I've
[1:01:43] turned this over to God it's in his
[1:01:45] hands and whatever happens whether it is
[1:01:48] or is not cancer means makes no
[1:01:50] difference to me because I know the Lord
[1:01:51] and I know God will take care of me if I
[1:01:54] have to go through chemo or whatever I
[1:01:56] got his hand he's got mine and he'll
[1:01:58] help me through that whatever it is I
[1:02:00] just ask that you continue your prayers
[1:02:02] and I thank you all for the prayers that
[1:02:03] I've had we've had many many people
[1:02:05] praying and I want to thank you for that
[1:02:07] but anyway that's God is good he's
[1:02:10] awesome one of my favorite Bible verses
[1:02:12] is Psalm 27 1 is the Lord is my light
[1:02:14] and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear I
[1:02:16] Don't Fear The Devil he wants to give
[1:02:18] this to me God allowed it and God
[1:02:21] allowed it for a reason I don't know if
[1:02:23] it's for me or maybe for my husband who
[1:02:26] is having a hard time with it but I know
[1:02:29] that he's he's done this for a reason
[1:02:31] and I'm just going to trust him no
[1:02:32] matter what the reason is but thank you
[1:02:34] all for your prayers I do appreciate
[1:02:35] them
[1:02:38] [Applause]
[1:02:46] again
[1:02:56] we wanna
[1:02:58] amen I uh
[1:03:01] was praying and I thought well I think
[1:03:02] I'm done with that series
[1:03:04] amen and so I thought about going into
[1:03:06] that Sevenfold personage of Christ amen
[1:03:10] and Revelations the first chapter but
[1:03:13] amen as I meditated and prayed I just
[1:03:15] felt the spirit moving to amen and I I
[1:03:19] think I've touched on it before and
[1:03:21] maybe spoke a little bit on it but
[1:03:23] there's one more thing that I'd like to
[1:03:24] pull out of this series on the
[1:03:26] worthiness of the Lord amen
[1:03:28] amen so we're going to turn our bibles
[1:03:31] if you will and it'll be
[1:03:33] um speaking on blessing amen and I'd
[1:03:38] like to include thanks amen Thanksgiving
[1:03:40] because that's another word that was put
[1:03:42] in there amen that he's worthy of
[1:03:45] Thanksgiving and he's worthy of a
[1:03:47] blessing isn't that right amen and so I
[1:03:50] want to cover blessing for sure this
[1:03:52] morning I want to talk about the
[1:03:53] blessing amen
[1:03:55] uh and so Revelations once again we want
[1:03:58] to read
[1:03:58] the same scriptures that we have read
[1:04:00] but we want to read it again and then go
[1:04:03] from there amen and I do have uh some
[1:04:06] Old Testament different Old Testament
[1:04:08] scriptures and I've got some good really
[1:04:11] good Bible reading that we have that I'd
[1:04:13] like to do this morning Amen to try to
[1:04:16] cover this and there's two sides to this
[1:04:18] there's really
[1:04:19] is really
[1:04:21] um but I've I've spoke so many times on
[1:04:24] the one side that I may touch on the one
[1:04:27] side a little bit but I wanna
[1:04:29] touch more on the second side the first
[1:04:31] side is how that we're blessed amen
[1:04:35] and the other side is how we are to
[1:04:37] bless him amen
[1:04:39] because he's worthy of blessing amen and
[1:04:41] we want to look at that part more this
[1:04:43] morning amen perhaps in what we are
[1:04:45] because we know many many places that we
[1:04:48] could go to even in the Book of
[1:04:50] Revelation this blessed he that readeth
[1:04:52] amenity to hear the words of the
[1:04:54] prophecy of this book amen Jesus Christ
[1:04:57] saying blessed are the poor in spirit
[1:04:59] blessed are these all these different uh
[1:05:02] things that we're blessed by amen and so
[1:05:06] we know uh and just maybe a sense of
[1:05:09] humor a little bit I remember when I was
[1:05:12] in Mennonite we would sing this song uh
[1:05:15] praise God from whom all blessings flow
[1:05:18] amen praise God All Creatures here below
[1:05:23] Grace Father Son and Holy Ghost amen I
[1:05:27] was like well we won't sing that song
[1:05:29] but amen and we know that praise God
[1:05:32] from whom all blessings flow isn't that
[1:05:34] right we know all blessings flow from
[1:05:37] almighty God
[1:05:39] amen and we certainly are blessed of God
[1:05:41] Amen but this is more centered towards
[1:05:44] amen not God giving us but what comes
[1:05:47] back you know how many God knows is
[1:05:49] really focused on that how that God is
[1:05:52] worthy of of these things amen and I
[1:05:55] don't know about you but if you invested
[1:05:56] in something you'd expect a return in
[1:05:59] that investment wouldn't you amen and so
[1:06:02] we want to look with the help of the
[1:06:03] Lord a little bit on my how God has
[1:06:05] invested himself and what he has
[1:06:07] invested amen and in this world I know
[1:06:10] that God is going to get exactly back I
[1:06:13] mean what he expected whenever he began
[1:06:15] to invest isn't that right but there's
[1:06:17] an on the other side on the bad side and
[1:06:20] those who do not love God and those who
[1:06:22] are on Satan's side we realize that God
[1:06:25] really doesn't get any respect does he
[1:06:27] amen amen and so uh we'll talk about
[1:06:31] that a little in a little bit amen amen
[1:06:33] and so let's read here in Revelations uh
[1:06:37] fifth chapter I want to Revelations 5
[1:06:40] 11-12 and then go seven uh chapter 7 and
[1:06:46] verse 12. now
[1:06:48] notice here and when those beasts give
[1:06:51] glory and honor and thanks to him that
[1:06:54] sat on the throne
[1:06:56] amen who liveth forever and ever I'm
[1:06:59] sorry I'm reading the wrong scripture
[1:07:01] all right chapter 5 verse 11. amen and I
[1:07:05] beheld and I heard the voice of many
[1:07:08] angels round about the throne and the
[1:07:10] beasts and the elders and the number of
[1:07:12] them was ten thousands times ten
[1:07:15] thousands and thousands of thousands
[1:07:17] saying with a loud voice Worthy is the
[1:07:21] Lamb to receive not all of these things
[1:07:24] he's worthy to receive amen he's worthy
[1:07:27] to receive that's why I say we want to
[1:07:29] focus on what he gets back isn't that
[1:07:31] right amen receive power and riches now
[1:07:36] I never did Cover riches so much and
[1:07:38] wisdom even wisdom I don't believe I've
[1:07:40] covered too much but I did a little bit
[1:07:42] and strength amen and honor and glory
[1:07:47] and blessing amen and I'm going to look
[1:07:51] at that word blessing with the help of
[1:07:53] the Lord this morning amen before we
[1:07:55] take communion and so forth the other
[1:07:57] one is found in chapter seven and we'll
[1:08:00] begin with verse 10. and cried with a
[1:08:04] loud voice saying salvation to Our God
[1:08:07] which stood upon the throne and unto the
[1:08:10] lamb and all the Angels stood round
[1:08:12] about the throne and about the elders
[1:08:14] and the four beasts and fell down before
[1:08:16] the throne on their faces and worshiped
[1:08:19] God saying amen and blessing amen
[1:08:25] amen and blessing and glory and wisdom
[1:08:28] and Thanksgiving there's that
[1:08:29] Thanksgiving word and honor and power
[1:08:32] and might be unto our God forever and
[1:08:38] ever amen God bless the reading of the
[1:08:40] words you can be seated this morning
[1:08:42] amen amen we want to look at this and I
[1:08:46] think about how blessed how many believe
[1:08:48] that we're the last people you know I
[1:08:50] believe the prophet made a statement he
[1:08:52] says how that we are a privileged people
[1:08:54] amen now a privileged people amen is a
[1:08:59] blessed people
[1:09:01] amen not underprivileged but privilege
[1:09:04] amen is a blessed people you and I we of
[1:09:07] course think about how God has blessed
[1:09:10] us amen and we want to return with the
[1:09:14] help of the Lord blessing back to him
[1:09:19] and we're going to go ahead if you will
[1:09:20] turn with me if you got your Bibles
[1:09:22] follow me along amen y'all see all those
[1:09:25] tabs right
[1:09:27] that's how many scriptures we got so we
[1:09:29] could just do nothing but reading
[1:09:31] scriptures amen and as a matter of fact
[1:09:33] I'm not sure if I'm gonna go to that
[1:09:34] scripture it may be in Nehemiah where it
[1:09:38] talks about I believe they flip took
[1:09:40] about a fourth of a day in just reading
[1:09:43] the scriptures amen
[1:09:45] amen and the power of God came down I
[1:09:47] think in a mighty way but let's turn
[1:09:50] first of all the first one we've got
[1:09:52] here is in Deuteronomy the 8th chapter
[1:09:54] and we'll hey I've got mark down here
[1:09:57] one through 20. we want to read about 20
[1:10:00] scriptures amen and we want to just take
[1:10:02] some thoughts here with the help of the
[1:10:04] Lord all right and I'll I want you to
[1:10:08] notice how there's a lot of these
[1:10:09] scriptures that tie in with the new
[1:10:11] testament amen
[1:10:13] amen so even though they're out of the
[1:10:15] Old Testament and some people think it's
[1:10:17] not relevant you'll find that a lot of
[1:10:21] these scriptures will pull out by Paul
[1:10:23] and mentioned over in the New Testament
[1:10:25] so chapter 8 verse 1 it says in all the
[1:10:27] Commandments which I command thee this
[1:10:30] day shall ye observe to do well we're
[1:10:33] not under the law anymore
[1:10:35] oh
[1:10:37] but think about the New Testament how
[1:10:39] many of those it says it talks about
[1:10:41] well let me just I I really just comes
[1:10:44] to mind that it actually is going to say
[1:10:45] it for me in verse 4. all right so think
[1:10:49] about this you shall observe to do that
[1:10:52] ye may live and multiply and go in and
[1:10:56] possess the land which the Lord swear
[1:10:59] unto your fathers now we all know that
[1:11:02] we've got a promised land that we're
[1:11:04] supposed to go in and possess don't we
[1:11:07] so we have a promised land that we're
[1:11:09] supposed to go in for the uh and class
[1:11:13] can I just treat you like a class this
[1:11:16] morning amen what is what is the
[1:11:18] Promised Land
[1:11:20] the Holy Ghost brother John that's right
[1:11:22] the Holy Ghost remember where is it
[1:11:25] found where do you find that this this
[1:11:27] is the promise anybody can tell me where
[1:11:29] it's found
[1:11:32] Acts 2 38 and you shall receive the golf
[1:11:35] if he gives up the Holy Ghost for the
[1:11:38] promise amen the promise is to you to
[1:11:40] your children to them that are far off
[1:11:42] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:11:44] call amen so that's the promise right
[1:11:47] there that's where the promise of the
[1:11:48] promised land is you shall possess the
[1:11:50] land and thou shalt remember all the way
[1:11:54] remember all the way which the Lord thy
[1:11:57] God let thee these for 40 years
[1:12:00] in the wilderness amen now I'm going to
[1:12:04] just say it ahead of time one thing that
[1:12:06] as we begin to think about blessing God
[1:12:09] the Bible here is telling us that we
[1:12:11] need to remember something because we're
[1:12:14] going to raise a little bit about toraha
[1:12:16] it tells us to bless him and so forth
[1:12:18] but now here it's telling us and
[1:12:20] remember how that God has led us these
[1:12:23] 40 years amen Faith the Lord
[1:12:26] I think Brother David said he's buried
[1:12:28] 42 years no doubt he was a Christian
[1:12:30] when he got married so he's been going
[1:12:32] about 40 years there's probably a lot of
[1:12:34] us in here how many in here has been
[1:12:36] serving the lord for 40 years
[1:12:40] 40 years yeah quite a few of us isn't it

[1:12:46] led us for 40 years
[1:12:48] so we can put our name in there and I
[1:12:50] didn't look at what God is on and how he
[1:12:53] had let you

[1:13:03] wilderness to Humble thee and to prove
[1:13:06] thee that's right and to know what was
[1:13:09] in thine heart
[1:13:11] hey man everybody can shout praise God
[1:13:14] I'm a Christian you know but in time we
[1:13:17] find out what's in your heart don't we
[1:13:20] When Trials and tests come we find out

[1:13:31] times uh and this just comes to mind
[1:13:34] didn't write this down but brother
[1:13:35] Bannon preached a message on time tested
[1:13:38] memorials didn't he
[1:13:40] he talked about people who are tested by
[1:13:42] time and proven by time and they're
[1:13:44] memorials because they were simply
[1:13:45] tested by time amen all right to know
[1:13:49] what is in our heart whether thou with
[1:13:51] us keep his Commandments or no
[1:13:54] amen and he humbled me and suffered thee
[1:13:59] to hunger
[1:14:01] and fed thee with Mana which thou knew
[1:14:03] is not neither did thy fathers know that
[1:14:06] he might make thee know that man now
[1:14:10] here's the answer Alice coming to you
[1:14:12] remember
[1:14:14] that man does not live by bread alone
[1:14:17] but only but by every word that proceed
[1:14:20] is out of the mouth of God this man
[1:14:23] lived by see how it's tights right over
[1:14:25] in the New Testament amen if he said it
[1:14:27] back then amen he means for us to obey
[1:14:30] every command that he has said
[1:14:33] and the congregation said
[1:14:35] amen
[1:14:38] praise the Lord so that's pulled over
[1:14:40] even Jesus made that very pulled that
[1:14:42] thing Jesus himself pulled it out of the
[1:14:44] Old Testament man shall not live my
[1:14:46] bread alone but by every word that
[1:14:48] proceedeth out of the mouth of God I
[1:14:50] remembered in verse 4 by Raymond whacks

[1:21:56] part yet and we will only if we'll see
[1:21:58] what we have time for
[1:22:00] all right let's continue on Deuteronomy
[1:22:02] shall we we're not we're gonna we're not
[1:22:04] going to cover all these other but if
[1:22:06] you want to know contrary when if you
[1:22:08] want to know the other side of that
[1:22:09] redrub a Deuteronomy 28 the second half
[1:22:11] he says but if you don't do what God
[1:22:13] says then you're going to be cursed when
[1:22:15] you come in and when you go out and
[1:22:16] everywhere you go how many those of you
[1:22:18] ain't got the Holy Ghost it don't matter
[1:22:19] where you which direction you go it's
[1:22:21] cursing's everywhere
[1:22:23] amen
[1:22:25] all right
[1:22:26] so back to Deuteronomy 8 and we'll begin
[1:22:30] with verse
[1:22:32] um
[1:22:33] nine a land wherein thou shall eat bread
[1:22:36] without scares the Thou shalt not lack
[1:22:39] anything in it
[1:22:41] amen a man whose stones are iron and out
[1:22:44] of whose heels thou mayest dig brass
[1:22:48] and when that is eaten and are full
[1:22:53] then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God
[1:22:57] for the good land which he had given me
[1:23:01] Hallelujah God gives you everything and
[1:23:05] then he says now that you got everything
[1:23:07] it's time to get back a little bit
[1:23:09] it's time to praise him it's time to say
[1:23:12] bless your holy name
[1:23:15] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:23:20] amen
[1:23:24] you know
[1:23:26] I was over there yesterday supporting
[1:23:28] brother Tommy and his Outreach
[1:23:30] and we were sitting there in the cabin
[1:23:32] they had about four of them so I knew
[1:23:34] that was taken care of I said I want to
[1:23:35] get out there amongst the grow up the
[1:23:36] crowd I grabbed my Bible and put it up
[1:23:39] under my arm and went out there
[1:23:40] yesterday everybody trying to find
[1:23:42] somebody to witness to amen
[1:23:44] you know it's kind of funny the reaction
[1:23:46] you know how that people would look at
[1:23:48] you
[1:23:49] you know and say what's that guy doing
[1:23:51] with the Bible you know now you know
[1:23:54] what I thought you know I thought all of
[1:23:56] your little toys all your access didn't
[1:23:58] hammers that you're selling all of your
[1:24:00] your implements and all of this other
[1:24:02] stuff that you're just having a you know
[1:24:04] don't mind about getting blowed away and
[1:24:06] I'm sure it was raining it'd probably
[1:24:07] stand in the rain and you know for
[1:24:09] enjoying the things that God has made
[1:24:11] and so forth but when a man comes with
[1:24:13] the very God that give you everything
[1:24:14] that you have to play with you think
[1:24:16] that's kind of weird
[1:24:18] huh
[1:24:20] isn't that how human beings are we enjoy
[1:24:23] the creation but we don't you know we
[1:24:26] are shy of the creator
[1:24:29] huh I'm not ashamed amen of my creator
[1:24:33] praise the Lord
[1:24:36] anyway we got to talk to a few people
[1:24:39] but you know you can just tell whether
[1:24:41] people really want to talk about it or
[1:24:43] not
[1:24:44] amen
[1:24:46] but anyway so I was thinking look at
[1:24:49] what God has done how many knows
[1:24:51] everything we have
[1:24:53] it's been given to us by God
[1:24:56] in of all the places and I think I'll
[1:24:59] still go to it if I have time of all the
[1:25:01] times and the places that we worship God
[1:25:04] we worship because
[1:25:06] he is the creator of all things that's
[1:25:08] why we worship him because he's the
[1:25:10] Creator amen
[1:25:13] okay I'm uh I know I stop a lot but
[1:25:16] these scriptures here here I just I like
[1:25:18] to just
[1:25:19] milk them so to speak amen praise the
[1:25:22] Lord
[1:25:23] oh would it be all right Donna I'll tell
[1:25:26] her that yesterday you know and I
[1:25:28] appreciate our prayer band I really
[1:25:30] appreciate our prayer band and yesterday
[1:25:32] after Donna ask everybody to pray and
[1:25:34] boy she's got a lot of good response and
[1:25:36] everything and the Lord just intervened
[1:25:38] and got a lot better and so forth and I
[1:25:39] said well are you going to tell them
[1:25:40] that it's good now the Lord's you know
[1:25:42] he said no I'm I'm a little greedy when
[1:25:44] it comes to prayer I'm a prayer Hogue
[1:25:47] price tomorrow you know I thought that's
[1:25:50] good that's good that's nothing wrong
[1:25:52] with playing some more amen which it
[1:25:54] needed to be a little bit more but by
[1:25:56] God's grace amen it's wonderful to know
[1:25:59] when people pray God answers I mean how
[1:26:01] many believes that and I think it's
[1:26:03] wonderful I think that's one of the
[1:26:04] greatest things right now is amen that
[1:26:06] we got going is that prayer group amen
[1:26:08] that when somebody has a need everybody
[1:26:10] goes to praying amen
[1:26:13] so when you have eaten an Artful
[1:26:16] verse 10 then shall bow bless the Lord
[1:26:19] thy God for the good land which he has
[1:26:22] given thee beware that thou forget not
[1:26:25] the Lord thy God huh
[1:26:29] in not keeping his Commandments his
[1:26:32] judgments and his statues which I
[1:26:34] commend thee this day at least when thy
[1:26:36] is eaten and are full and has built
[1:26:39] goodly houses and dwelt therein
[1:26:42] and when thy hurts and thy flocks have
[1:26:45] multiplied and thy silver and thy gold
[1:26:48] is Multiplied in all that thou has is
[1:26:51] Multiplied then thine heart be lifted up
[1:26:55] and now forget the Lord thy God which
[1:26:57] brought before out of the land of Egypt
[1:27:00] but we'll say the land of scarceness
[1:27:03] huh
[1:27:05] praise be to God how many glad

[1:27:19] water who brought before us water out of
[1:27:22] a rock of Flint

[1:27:26] with Manna which thy fathers knew not
[1:27:29] that he might humble thee and that he
[1:27:31] might prove thee to do the good in thy
[1:27:35] latter end now look at verse 15 who let
[1:27:38] these two touch great and terrible
[1:27:40] Wilderness amen you see how does that
