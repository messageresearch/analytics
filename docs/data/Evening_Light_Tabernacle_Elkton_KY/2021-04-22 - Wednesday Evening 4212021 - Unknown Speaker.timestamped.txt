[30:31] meditation of our heart now in jesus
[30:33] name
[30:34] amen and amen amen i want to
[30:37] take a little subject out of haggai the
[30:40] book of haggai
[30:42] amen i was sitting back here in the
[30:45] pulpit actually back here
[30:46] just reading the scriptures when i came
[30:49] across this
[30:50] when i got to study and that came back
[30:52] on my mind
[30:53] so amen we'll just see what the lord
[30:55] will have for us would that be all right
[30:58] and haggai the first chapter
[31:08] and we want to speak with the help of
[31:10] the lord with those
[31:12] who uh obey the voice of god
[31:15] and those who do not obey the voice of
[31:18] god
[31:19] amen and we want to call it can
[31:22] call it considering
[31:25] consider your ways consider
[31:28] your ways amen
[31:31] haggai one in the second year of darius
[31:36] the king
[31:36] in the sixth month in the first day of
[31:39] the month came the word of the lord by
[31:40] hagia i the prophet
[31:42] unto zerubbabel the son of shial theo
[31:46] governor of judah and to joshua the son
[31:49] of
[31:50] jesudek the high priest saying
[31:53] thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying
[31:57] this people say the time is not come
[32:00] the time that the lord's house should be
[32:03] built
[32:04] then came the word of the lord by hagee
[32:06] i the prophet saying
[32:08] is it time for you o ye
[32:11] to dwell in your sealed houses
[32:14] and this house lie waste now therefore
[32:18] thus saith the lord of hosts consider
[32:22] your ways you have sown
[32:26] much and bring in little you eat
[32:30] but ye have not enough you drink
[32:33] but ye are not filled with drink ye
[32:37] clothe
[32:37] you but there is none warm and he that
[32:41] earneth wages
[32:42] earneth wages to put it in a bag with
[32:45] holes
[32:46] thus saith the lord of hosts consider
[32:49] your ways go up to the mountain and
[32:52] bring wood and built the house and i
[32:54] will take pleasure in it
[32:56] that will be glorified saith the lord
[32:59] he looked too much and lo it came
[33:03] too little he looked for much
[33:06] and lo it came too little when he
[33:09] brought
[33:10] it home i did blow upon it
[33:13] why saith the lord of hosts because when
[33:16] i
[33:17] because my house that is waste
[33:20] and he run every man into his own house
[33:23] therefore the heaven over you is stayed
[33:25] from dew and the earth is stayed
[33:28] from her fruit and i called for a
[33:30] drought upon the land
[33:32] upon the mountains and upon the corn and
[33:34] upon a new wine
[33:35] and upon the oil and upon that which the
[33:39] ground
[33:40] bringeth forth and upon men and upon
[33:42] cattle and upon
[33:43] all the labor of the hands
[33:46] then zerubbabel the son of xiaotio and
[33:52] joshua the son of
[33:53] jose deck the high priest with all the
[33:56] remnant of the people
[33:58] obeyed the voice of the lord their god
[34:01] and the words of haggai the prophet
[34:03] as the lord their god had sent him and
[34:06] the people did fear
[34:08] before the lord then speak haggai
[34:11] the lord's messenger the in the lord's
[34:14] message
[34:14] unto the people saying i am with you
[34:18] saith the lord amen may god had his
[34:21] blessings to the reading of the words
[34:22] you can be seated
[34:24] i just read that and there's actually
[34:26] only two chapters
[34:27] in haggai amen and so when i read that i
[34:32] was like wow you know and
[34:34] the lord just seemed to pick something
[34:36] up there that perhaps would be a
[34:38] blessing to us tonight
[34:39] amen and so i think
[34:43] what we have read already spoke volumes
[34:46] to us
[34:48] didn't it it's pretty simple
[34:51] but you know it's rare i want to say
[34:52] it's rare
[34:54] that people actually do verse 12
[34:58] right when they hear the voice of the
[35:00] lord and actually
[35:02] obey it
[35:05] right you know and so it makes a huge
[35:08] difference amen because
[35:10] the truth of the matter is that's what
[35:11] we're here all
[35:13] here on earth for and that right
[35:16] we're going to either do one or the
[35:18] other thing we're going to obey
[35:19] the voice of god and be blessed or we're
[35:22] going
[35:23] to disobey amen
[35:26] and things are not going to go so well
[35:27] amen the lord can never bless
[35:30] something that is disobedient to his
[35:34] word
[35:35] amen and so we looked at that and i
[35:37] might go back down here just a little
[35:39] bit but
[35:40] uh the prophet of god you know he
[35:42] preached a message thinking on our way
[35:44] you mean there's another scripture that
[35:46] talks about david i think it's as he was
[35:48] thinking on his ways
[35:50] but here it says consider your ways
[35:54] because
[35:54] apparently israel there i believe they
[35:56] were
[35:58] the lord's house had no doubt come to
[36:01] waste somehow i don't know the full
[36:03] story
[36:04] but according to this the house of the
[36:06] lord laid
[36:07] waste and the people said you know
[36:10] it's just not time yet we're not ready
[36:12] to build the lord's house
[36:17] you know and so the lord sent haggai
[36:20] to give him a message you know here he
[36:22] says you know
[36:23] my house lays waste and here you go to
[36:27] your house
[36:28] am i right you go to your sealed
[36:31] houses no doubt your deluxe houses your
[36:34] nice houses you enjoy
[36:37] that but you don't worry about that
[36:39] lord's how
[36:41] now how many knows that's a whole lot
[36:43] like leodocya
[36:45] they're reaching increased with goods
[36:47] they don't think that they have need of
[36:49] anything but
[36:50] don't realize spiritually they're
[36:53] suffering
[36:55] how many knows the layout of scenes they
[36:56] were seriously suffering
[36:58] because they were wretched miserable
[37:00] poor blind naked and didn't know it
[37:02] these people here you know
[37:07] god works interesting intricately in our
[37:10] lives
[37:12] amen
[37:19] and he gets specific god gets specific
[37:21] here with them
[37:23] you know right he says you know you so
[37:25] much
[37:26] but you bring in little i don't know
[37:28] about you but how many has ever been
[37:30] felt like you're just really spinning
[37:31] your wheels you work
[37:33] like who'da thought it but yet you get
[37:35] nowhere
[37:37] you sow a lot but you get no benefits
[37:40] hardly
[37:40] yeah amen and then it says you know
[37:44] but you you have so much and you bring a
[37:47] little in
[37:48] you eat but you don't have enough
[37:53] amen people are never happy with what
[37:55] they do have
[37:58] it's never enough they're still not
[38:00] satisfied
[38:03] then the next is the drink people drink
[38:05] you know they
[38:06] partake of something they drink but
[38:08] their
[38:09] thirst is never quenched
[38:13] amen but you are not filled with drink
[38:16] and then he said that you are clothed
[38:19] you clothed yourself
[38:21] amen but the love of many is wax cold
[38:26] and they're right people are as cold as
[38:29] ever they dress
[38:30] nicer than ever but they're colder
[38:33] inside than they've ever been
[38:36] hey man they might dress good you might
[38:38] have clothes on but
[38:39] you're still cold and that's what
[38:43] leoducia is isn't that right
[38:45] they ought to see they may have the best
[38:47] it may be droves but they're still
[38:49] that's what's on the inside
[38:52] praise be to god amen
[38:58] oh does why they did not build the house
[39:01] of the lord
[39:02] other things their own house and
[39:04] everything else is
[39:05] more important than the house of god now
[39:08] in our world we wouldn't necessarily
[39:10] talk about a tabernacle or a house
[39:12] amen we want to talk about this
[39:13] tabernacle because some of those
[39:15] this is the tabernacle of god and many
[39:18] people
[39:19] they'll tears they love so much they
[39:22] look
[39:22] mad they want the best food they want
[39:24] the best clothes they want the best
[39:26] house
[39:27] but they don't worry about what it looks
[39:29] like when we come to your house
[39:30] and no doubt it's going to be cleaned
[39:32] it's going to be swept it's going to be
[39:34] this thing that the other
[39:35] and you don't want no dog running
[39:37] through the house and get everything all
[39:38] muddy
[39:41] but a lot of times we'll let demons sit
[39:42] us with us in a recliner hello
[39:45] amen it is that or the other when you
[39:47] think about it our natural houses may be
[39:49] purty but why
[39:50] is our spiritual health what's that
[39:53] looking like what is our
[39:55] spiritual steak with the lord i tell you
[39:59] what
[39:59] notice how he talks about the oil and
[40:01] the wine
[40:02] and that right he says you know i'm
[40:04] gonna take out the fruit i'm gonna take
[40:06] out
[40:07] i'm gonna call for a drought and there
[40:08] ain't going to be no stimulation of
[40:10] revelation
[40:14] it's going to be shh oops wrong one
[40:22] quiet in the house of the lord
[40:25] huh no i don't know why
[40:29] no rain coming down now i want you to
[40:32] know something i
[40:33] am a believer that god controls
[40:36] the snow last night
[40:39] he controls the weather he controls
[40:42] whether it rains
[40:43] or whether it doesn't rain the bible
[40:44] clearly states that he is making sure
[40:47] that things get watered how many knows
[40:50] man can you imagine if god didn't see
[40:52] that all of nature and all the trees and
[40:53] everything gets watered
[40:55] well buddy i'll tell you this right now
[40:58] if you left it in the devil's hands we'd
[40:59] have some bad looking place out there
[41:03] it would be terrible but god cares about
[41:05] that and so
[41:06] does god care about you and me
[41:11] he cares about us i'm glad to be serving
[41:15] the living god
[41:16] not just the god of history but we're
[41:19] leaving we're dealing with somebody
[41:21] amen but what he's trying to say is i
[41:24] want you to get together and i want you
[41:26] to build
[41:27] my house build me a temple
[41:32] because he said here amen
[41:35] i will take pleasure in it
[41:40] praise be to god and i will be glorified
[41:45] save the lord
[41:48] now how many knows there's just no glory
[41:51] in a dead
[41:52] temple where there's no life
[41:55] that's right huh
[41:59] we get together and the same thing said
[42:02] over and over and over
[42:05] ritualistic we have a prayer book and we
[42:08] read the prayer every sunday morning
[42:11] huh
[42:14] but god is life and he will be glorified
[42:18] saith the lord i will take pleasure in
[42:20] it
[42:22] amen i like that and we know that we are
[42:25] the temple of god
[42:27] and he wants to be glorified in our
[42:30] temple
[42:32] people they look for much and law just a
[42:34] little bit
[42:35] king oh my let me go back down here
[42:39] so he's noticed and he that earneth
[42:42] wages
[42:42] earneth wages to put it into a
[42:46] bag of holes now how many knows many of
[42:49] us know the
[42:49] phrase about you know how sometimes our
[42:52] pocket
[42:53] it might get a lot of money in it but
[42:54] it's got a hole in the pipe
[42:56] yeah yeah
[43:00] i don't know about you but he ain't no
[43:02] good to make him a lot of money if you
[43:04] still
[43:05] got the money
[43:08] that's what he said you know you may
[43:10] earn and you may put it all in there but
[43:12] i'm gonna make sure
[43:14] that everything can go wrong will go
[43:16] wrong
[43:17] we all know that a lot of times your
[43:18] savings and so forth hey
[43:20] you just about time you get some money
[43:22] saved up something else the motor blows
[43:24] up in the car you need a new car
[43:27] well there it goes that you know this
[43:29] that or the other but that's what he's
[43:30] saying he's just going to make sure
[43:32] now he knows god cares about his
[43:34] children he's not going to cast you off
[43:36] but he's going to make life rough on you
[43:39] he's not gonna bless you
[43:41] god don't bless those that don't keep
[43:43] his commandments
[43:46] go ahead that's the truth
[43:49] if you want to be blessed do what god
[43:52] says
[43:54] if you want to be cursed go your own way
[43:57] do your own thing do it your way huh
[44:02] it's that simple i want to first dwell
[44:05] on
[44:06] those who disobey okay
[44:09] those who don't fear the lord then i
[44:12] want to go over the haggy eye here
[44:14] where it says the people did fear before
[44:17] the lord
[44:17] they had a reverence how many know
[44:20] that's what this world
[44:22] i oh my i've been a christian i guess 30
[44:24] somebody i don't even know how many
[44:25] years it's been so many years
[44:29] but i never get i never cease to get
[44:32] amazed
[44:32] how god is so great
[44:37] i mean to make the stars out there the
[44:40] moon the galaxies
[44:41] everything that there is including me
[44:46] and being so nice that he chose me to
[44:49] live
[44:51] isn't that right so nice
[44:55] you know praise be to god
[45:01] and the power the sheer power that god
[45:04] has
[45:06] the sheer powerful knowledge that he has
[45:09] the wisdom that he has the perfection
[45:12] that he is
[45:14] he never ceases to amaze me
[45:17] i guess the best way to explain it is
[45:19] that song says
[45:20] i stand i
[45:24] stand in all
[45:26] of you
[45:30] just stand there in awe of him
[45:33] like wow amen
[45:38] and he is worthy to be praying how did
[45:40] he's always been
[45:41] always will be he's ever present god
[45:44] he's not just a god of history but he's
[45:45] a god of
[45:46] today and the graciousness of god the
[45:50] mercy of god
[45:52] it's just i don't know about you brother
[45:55] glenn but i didn't stop this thing a
[45:57] long time ago
[45:58] we wouldn't have got this far they
[46:00] wouldn't have got this far
[46:05] he wouldn't have to let him go this far
[46:08] he'd be righteous to
[46:09] judge the world with the first or second
[46:11] offense
[46:13] you know that and then you know what
[46:16] else you know what else is the grace of
[46:17] almighty god
[46:19] i wouldn't even have let me go that far
[46:24] all right you don't think so yeah we're
[46:27] that way we like to judge each other
[46:29] quick
[46:30] we don't let each other get away with
[46:32] too much before we get judgmental and
[46:34] cannot get all condemnation about him
[46:38] god is a whole lot more forgiving than
[46:40] what we are
[46:42] he's the most forgiving god his mercy
[46:44] endureth forever
[46:46] and he watches us and he knows our
[46:47] hearts and he knows and everything we do
[46:50] and every time we repent amen he knows
[46:54] is that right he's merciful god
[46:57] the most merciful god is that you can
[46:59] ever imagine
[47:01] i thank you for that because i wouldn't
[47:03] stand a chance and neither with you
[47:06] amen but god is a gracious god okay
[47:11] so praise be to god so i'll tell you
[47:13] what man i'll tell you
[47:14] more you just because even jesus said in
[47:16] the new testament remember jesus said in
[47:18] the new testament
[47:19] you know i will liken you know the
[47:21] kingdom of god to a man who built this
[47:24] house
[47:24] upon the rock isn't that right and then
[47:27] he talks about those who
[47:29] keep his commandments are like the man
[47:31] that built upon a rock
[47:33] and those that don't keep his
[47:35] commandments are those who build the
[47:37] pond's hand
[47:39] amen because the winds are going to come
[47:41] and it's going to blow that house down
[47:43] but the one that
[47:44] doeth the will of heart of the father
[47:47] amen that obeys his commandment he's
[47:49] going to build
[47:50] his house upon a rock
[47:54] and then the fear of god is beginning of
[47:58] smarts it's the beginning of wisdom
[48:04] amen you are a fool
[48:07] bible says to say there ain't no god
[48:10] only a fool
[48:11] you are stupid beyond
[48:15] imagination
[48:18] well my version of it anyway
[48:22] praise be to god god is good
[48:25] you love him tonight he is awesome
[48:31] all right so let's think about this
[48:35] they feared the lord
[48:38] and the lord came back with haggy eye
[48:42] amen and they listened to the lord they
[48:45] obeyed his voice
[48:49] let me tell you something you know how
[48:50] many knows that god sent a gift one time
[48:52] through solomon
[48:54] and the people accepted that gift
[48:56] accepted god
[48:58] and they're right and they had the most
[49:00] greatest time that the world had
[49:02] probably ever known
[49:03] all the nations of the world feared
[49:06] israel
[49:09] why because not even the enemy and not
[49:11] even the kings of the enemy
[49:15] remember that one case where he says you
[49:16] know how does he know that
[49:18] i do this or said that and the prophet
[49:20] told that king he says you know
[49:22] he knows what goes on in your bed
[49:24] chambers
[49:25] that little conversation you and your
[49:28] wife have on your pillar when you
[49:29] haven't talked about it and i
[49:31] didn't think that he heard all that he
[49:33] knew all about it
[49:35] and they feared god it was a glorious
[49:40] age it is a glorious time
[49:43] for any individual that will do what god
[49:46] says
[49:50] it's that simple if it tells you you
[49:53] need to repent and get baptized
[49:55] buddy i'll tell you what how deep some
[49:56] water because i'm thinking take a dive
[49:59] huh get me in the water that's right
[50:02] because that's what god said
[50:04] he don't believe us shall be saved he
[50:05] not believeth not chubby damn
[50:08] amen obey the voice of god
[50:12] oh boy after tonight's service take this
[50:14] home
[50:16] amen and think about this tomorrow
[50:19] that if you really want joy unspeakable
[50:22] and blessings beyond your imagination
[50:25] do what god said
[50:28] you know saul he was he had mercy and
[50:31] grace shown to him
[50:33] they chose him to be king isn't that
[50:35] right
[50:37] but he thought it was better to bring
[50:38] all those sheep and the oxen back and
[50:40] sacrifice to god
[50:42] when god says destroy everything and
[50:44] samuel said no no
[50:45] no no saul god loves obedience a lot
[50:49] better than sacrifice
[50:51] i mean he knows that god loves obedience
[50:57] boy you talk about a rebellious
[51:00] generation a world we're living in and
[51:02] you know what the thing of it is
[51:05] the thing of it is not a one person
[51:08] is gonna get away with anything
[51:11] nobody's gonna get away with nothing
[51:14] you mock god all you want but it's
[51:17] coming back to you
[51:20] it's coming back to you all right so
[51:23] we'll pick this back up
[51:24] let's go to proverbs let's talk about
[51:27] another group
[51:29] that did not choose the fear of the lord
[51:32] amen that wanted to walk in their
[51:36] own way proverbs 1
[51:40] and verse 23
[51:47] turn you at my reproof see there and had
[51:49] yeah they actually turn
[51:51] and boy were they blessed and we are
[51:54] going to have a jew believe
[51:55] when we find out what god gave them as a
[51:58] reward
[51:59] for turning turn you at my reproof
[52:02] behold i will pour my spirit upon you
[52:06] and i will make known my words unto you
[52:09] aren't you glad in this hour that god
[52:12] does have a voice god does have
[52:16] words god does have instruction
[52:21] oh and it's so clear
[52:27] brother branham in his meetings he would
[52:30] many times he would preach the gospel
[52:33] and he'd be waiting for him to come
[52:35] right
[52:36] all of a sudden say he's here now the
[52:39] lord he's here now
[52:41] huh and i just listened to a tape after
[52:44] he says you know he's the angel of the
[52:45] lord he showed himself to him he was a
[52:47] tall
[52:48] dark man with hair down to her shoulder
[52:50] length somewhere
[52:51] he says it's the same one that uses my
[52:53] voice to speak
[52:54] and he saw him huh
[52:58] so you see folks how many knows we have
[53:00] a clear voice of god in this generation
[53:03] and even he said this voice the messages
[53:06] the tapes
[53:07] they will be played back on the day of
[53:09] judgment
[53:12] amen
[53:14] ah they might dispute it but he's gonna
[53:17] say then why did
[53:18] god pack it up god why did he vindicate
[53:22] it right afterwards god wouldn't
[53:23] have indicated back up something that's
[53:25] false
[53:26] no he wouldn't now though i will make
[53:30] known
[53:30] my words unto you because i have
[53:34] called and you refused
[53:38] i have stretched out my hand and no man
[53:41] regarded
[53:43] i mean that was over revelations he said
[53:45] i stand at the door
[53:47] that put him outside
[53:51] they refused him they rejected him
[53:56] you know what's waiting for that group
[53:58] atomic fire
[54:01] weeping and wailing and gnashing of
[54:03] teeth you don't just reject the lord
[54:06] put him outside and not expect to get
[54:07] your reward
[54:11] i have stretched out my hand and no man
[54:14] regarded
[54:15] you have said it not all my counsel and
[54:18] would none of my reproof i
[54:21] also will laugh at your calamity i will
[54:24] mock when your fear cometh
[54:26] and when your fear cometh as desolation
[54:29] and your destruction cometh as a
[54:31] whirlwind
[54:32] when distress and anguish cometh upon
[54:34] you
[54:36] oh my can i just stop a minute it comes
[54:39] to mind
[54:41] over in the book of revelations i
[54:42] believe it is
[54:54] it says
[55:00] hold on a second
[55:09] okay and the four and 20 elders
[55:14] verse 18 of chapter 11 and the nations
[55:17] were
[55:17] angry and thy wrath is come
[55:21] and the time of the dead they shall be
[55:23] judged
[55:24] and that thou should give reward unto
[55:27] thy servants the prophets
[55:29] and to the saints and them that fear thy
[55:32] name
[55:33] small and great and should destroy them
[55:36] that destroy
[55:38] the earth another place it talks about
[55:41] how that they will run for the rocks and
[55:43] the mountains and the hills to cover
[55:44] them
[55:45] and to hide them verse chapter 6 verse
[55:48] 16
[55:49] and said to the mountains and the rocks
[55:51] fall on us and hide us
[55:54] that saith on the throne and from the
[55:56] wrath of the lamb
[55:57] for the great day of his wrath is come
[56:00] and who shall
[56:01] be able to stand back in proverbs
[56:04] it says i i also will laugh at your
[56:07] calamity i will mock when you fear
[56:09] cometh
[56:10] when fear cometh as destruction and
[56:13] your destruction cometh as a whirlwind
[56:16] distressed and
[56:17] anguish cometh upon you how many knows
[56:20] when the trade tribulation period comes
[56:22] when the end of the world comes i really
[56:26] don't think anybody's going to be
[56:27] ignorant anymore nobody's going to be an
[56:31] unbeliever anymore they're all going to
[56:33] know
[56:33] that god's wrath is coming down on them
[56:36] there's not going to be any question
[56:38] because it even says the small the great
[56:40] kings of the earth
[56:42] they all went to hiding who knows just
[56:44] what the meaning of that is
[56:46] maybe going to canada maybe go into
[56:48] these mountains and caves
[56:49] maybe go into these bomb shelters to
[56:51] government build i don't know
[56:53] but they're going to try to go hide
[56:54] they're not going to go hide
[56:57] am i right but they'll know that
[57:00] god is going to god's wrath is coming
[57:03] and whenever god has his port out folks
[57:06] let me tell you something i would never
[57:10] want to be on the rise
[57:11] the wrong side of that
[57:15] because his wrath is poured out without
[57:18] mixture
[57:19] and who shall be able it is going to be
[57:21] cruel the bible says
[57:22] it's going to be cruel and fierce unlike
[57:25] anything you have ever imagined
[57:29] oh listen distress cometh upon you
[57:33] then shall they call upon me but i will
[57:35] not answer they shall seek me early but
[57:37] they shall
[57:38] not find me let me just stop there for a
[57:42] minute for those who reject his
[57:43] commandments don't obey him
[57:46] don't come when the holy spirit says
[57:47] come now tonight
[57:50] every service that god has when the holy
[57:52] spirit says come when you feel that tug
[57:55] give your heart to the lord but abram
[57:58] says there will come a time
[57:59] when the bride will preach to the total
[58:01] lost is that the people will actually
[58:03] come to the altar
[58:05] thinking they're getting saved sinking
[58:08] they're getting filled with the holy
[58:09] ghost did but they're not getting a
[58:10] thing
[58:11] but they come back they can come up they
[58:13] go back as empty as what they come
[58:14] they never did get it in the first place
[58:16] they don't even know what it is
[58:18] because they never had but they will not
[58:21] be able to get
[58:23] they'll seek me early but they shall not
[58:25] find me
[58:26] for they hated knowledge and did not
[58:29] choose the fear of the lord
[58:31] that reminds me of this world that we're
[58:33] living in our politics
[58:36] they hated the truth they hated
[58:40] to be corrected and they know
[58:43] that they are correct they know they're
[58:45] wrong but they hate
[58:47] that they don't choose that i don't
[58:50] choose
[58:51] to know that i'm wrong they choose
[58:54] they did not choose the fear of the lord
[58:59] amen it would none of my counsel they
[59:03] despised
[59:04] all my reproof amen how many knows
[59:08] as many as i love i reprove jason scorch
[59:11] each one that comes to god over in
[59:14] revelations
[59:15] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[59:17] as many as i love
[59:18] that was this generation to the prophet
[59:20] of god
[59:22] he rebuked this generation like none
[59:24] other
[59:25] he reproved this generation by coming
[59:28] and vindicating and proving that what he
[59:30] was saying was the truth
[59:31] he reproved it chastised it and so forth
[59:34] but there would
[59:35] none of it if they did
[59:39] if they did all the baptists all the
[59:41] methodists
[59:42] all the presbyterian would be packed
[59:44] into this little place right now
[59:47] go ahead yeah
[59:50] they would obey the voice of god but in
[59:54] the days of the voice of the seventh
[59:55] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[59:57] mystery of god
[59:58] god speaks through the seventh angel
[1:00:01] god speaks through his messengers all
[1:00:04] right

[1:00:14] of the fruit of their
[1:00:17] own way yeah you can go do your own
[1:00:20] thing
[1:00:21] but you'll pay for it i mean those none
[1:00:24] of us have a thought coming
[1:00:26] we do what god says we come his way
[1:00:31] or we get the prize for it we get to eat
[1:00:33] the fruit of our own way
[1:00:35] and they shall be filled with their own
[1:00:39] devices amen
[1:00:44] all right let's go back for just a
[1:00:45] minute and look at
[1:00:49] can i read quite a few scriptures was
[1:00:50] that all right
[1:00:52] another one of my favorite scriptures
[1:00:54] about blessing and cursing is found
[1:00:56] and i never forget this deuteronomy 28
[1:01:00] it says if you will hearken undiligently
[1:01:03] unto the voice of thy lord thy god
[1:01:05] to observe and to do all these
[1:01:07] commandments well brother father
[1:01:09] we don't have to obey his commandments
[1:01:11] we don't we
[1:01:12] we ain't saved by obeying nothing
[1:01:15] come on now i argue with me a little bit
[1:01:22] huh
[1:01:25] what did jesus say if you love me
[1:01:29] you ain't got to obey what i say no
[1:01:32] he said if you love me
[1:01:34] [Music]
[1:01:37] obey my commandments
[1:01:46] same thing here if you will observe to
[1:01:49] do all of his command which i commandee
[1:01:50] this day
[1:01:51] that the lord thy god will set me on
[1:01:53] high
[1:01:54] above all the nations of the world how
[1:01:56] many believe tonight that if you are
[1:01:59] saved filled with the holy ghost you
[1:02:01] couldn't come that way outside of
[1:02:02] obeying the commandments of god
[1:02:06] and now
[1:02:10] oh man i was going to make it short
[1:02:13] tonight but right now i think
[1:02:14] we go to 12 o'clock
[1:02:22] now you don't have to feel like they do
[1:02:26] huh you don't have to be
[1:02:30] empty on the inside like they are
[1:02:34] you don't have to get tattoos all over
[1:02:36] your body
[1:02:37] from one to the other because you're
[1:02:39] never happy

[1:02:42] be happily just as ugly as god made you
[1:02:51] quit wasting your money getting prettier
[1:02:55] my wife was telling me today she was
[1:02:57] telling me a story of
[1:02:59] a woman that spent hundreds of thousands
[1:03:01] of dollars and man she just got caught
[1:03:03] up
[1:03:03] in looking brighter and birdier and at
[1:03:06] the end of it she looked horrible
[1:03:07] and she was a hundred thousand or more
[1:03:09] in the day
[1:03:09] [Music]
[1:03:12] oh my it was terrible i thought yeah

[1:06:20] amen can i stop right there i'll pick it
[1:06:24] back up let's go back to haggy eye
[1:06:27] take another thought of haggy eye this
[1:06:30] is the same side now of the blessings
[1:06:33] of those who obey because what we're
[1:06:36] reading right now
[1:06:38] i really was going to read the other
[1:06:40] part first
[1:06:41] that if you don't obey cursed are you
[1:06:44] but i didn't so we're going to go back
[1:06:46] to haggai
[1:06:48] in chapter 1 and verse
[1:06:52] the last part of verse 12. all right
[1:06:56] the high priest with all the remnant of
[1:06:58] the people and they obeyed the voice of
[1:06:59] the lord their god in the words of
[1:07:01] haggie had a prophet as the lord their
[1:07:02] god had sent
[1:07:03] him and the people did fear before the
[1:07:06] lord
[1:07:06] then speak haggai the lord's messenger
[1:07:09] in the lord's message
[1:07:10] unto the people saying and listen
[1:07:14] after dating all that god just rewards
[1:07:17] them with one
[1:07:18] phrase
[1:07:22] he only rewards them with one phrase
[1:07:25] he says saying i
[1:07:29] am with you
[1:07:32] saith the lord and he says that down in
[1:07:34] verse 4
[1:07:35] of chapter 2 again he says be strong all
[1:07:38] ye people of the land
[1:07:39] saith the lord and work for i
[1:07:43] am with you
[1:07:46] hallelujah how many is glad that he is
[1:07:49] with
[1:07:49] you that's all that matters in this
[1:07:52] world
[1:07:53] i've lived six decades almost nine i'm
[1:07:56] here today
[1:07:57] the most glorious thing you'll ever have
[1:07:59] is to know that
[1:08:00] god is with you
[1:08:08] just have him with you
[1:08:11] and now not just with you
[1:08:17] but in you amen aren't you glad for that
[1:08:22] because if he's with you that's when you
[1:08:25] ain't got to worry about your enemies
[1:08:27] they'll come one way and they'll flee
[1:08:29] seven why because it ain't you
[1:08:33] mama lord jesus help us to think that
[1:08:38] man
[1:08:39] i am his lock stock and barrel
[1:08:43] and then when i got to thinking about
[1:08:44] this he says different times he says i'm
[1:08:46] with you don't worry about nothing
[1:08:49] i'm with you when they're here he says i
[1:08:51] want you to know some i'm with you
[1:08:54] praise be to god remember brother
[1:08:56] branham he was in the back of a little
[1:08:58] trailer one time with a little
[1:08:59] typewriter and so forth and
[1:09:01] and and oral roberts billy graham and
[1:09:02] all them had a multi-million dollars
[1:09:04] going and all this stuff and he says boy
[1:09:06] look at them

[1:09:09] buildings multi-million dollar buildings
[1:09:11] and all this and
[1:09:13] what have i got a little old typewriter
[1:09:16] right
[1:09:16] here he got the feeling bad
[1:09:20] boy i ain't nothing you know we
[1:09:25] revere the prophet of god highly don't
[1:09:27] we
[1:09:28] as a mighty man of god but while he was
[1:09:30] here on earth going through the motions
[1:09:32] and what he was going through he wasn't
[1:09:34] all that highly esteemed in the world
[1:09:38] he was living in arizona and none of
[1:09:40] those churches would even let him come
[1:09:42] in he had to just go where he could
[1:09:44] he was despised and thrown out and
[1:09:46] everything and oh my
[1:09:48] people disrespected him back then
[1:09:50] everything else
[1:09:52] but he had this little place he was just
[1:09:53] in his little place and he says you know
[1:09:55] but he said the lord spoke to him what
[1:09:56] did he say
[1:09:57] [Music]
[1:09:59] i am your portion same thing you told
[1:10:02] abram
[1:10:03] i'm your porsche
[1:10:08] that's plenty for me isn't that plenty

[1:20:07] of that cattle in the fruit of thy
[1:20:08] ground

[1:20:48] god you're going to end up borrowing
[1:20:51] amen the lord shall make thee the head
[1:20:54] and not the tale thou shalt be above

[1:21:03] this day
[1:21:04] to observe and to do them
[1:21:08] and if thou shalt go not aside from any
[1:21:11] of the words
[1:21:12] which i command thee this day to the
[1:21:13] right hand or to the left
[1:21:15] to go after other gods and serve them
[1:21:21] what's another god something that you
[1:21:24] put
[1:21:25] before the lord when god
[1:21:28] doesn't have first place in your life
[1:21:31] anymore
[1:21:31] you have went after another god
[1:21:35] how many god has to be first place in
[1:21:37] our life
[1:21:38] got the man's first place in our life
[1:21:42] let me close with matthew simple
[1:21:45] scripture that i've gone to
[1:21:47] refer to many times of how
[1:21:50] the lord cares about our daily
[1:21:54] life
[1:21:58] if god so clothed the grass of the field
[1:22:01] which today is
[1:22:03] huh how many knows god it's god that's
[1:22:05] actually causes the grass to grow
[1:22:08] he takes care of all that if he does
[1:22:11] that
[1:22:12] the grass of the field which today is
[1:22:13] and tomorrow's cast into the oven
[1:22:15] shall he not much more close you
[1:22:21] how many is glad to be clothed this
[1:22:24] evening
[1:22:25] and i'm not talking about this right
[1:22:27] here
[1:22:29] i'm talking about righteousness of jesus
[1:22:32] christ
[1:22:33] being on you the blood of jesus christ
[1:22:37] that made and gave you the access to a
[1:22:39] robe
[1:22:40] of righteousness isn't that right
[1:22:45] but did it say in revelations that the
[1:22:48] shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[1:22:51] anointed eyes with eyes have and clothe
[1:22:53] you that you nakedness do not appear
[1:22:55] amen he says to clothe us but he also
[1:22:59] means
[1:23:00] also means natural amen
[1:23:04] naturally and spiritually he'll make
[1:23:06] sure you got something to wear
[1:23:08] or what listen o ye of little faith
[1:23:12] therefore taking a thought saying what
[1:23:14] shall we eat or what shall we drink
[1:23:16] or where with all shall we be clothed
[1:23:22] i don't want to be here forever but
[1:23:24] that's what haggy i was saying
[1:23:26] you go to your house you're so worried
[1:23:29] about what you got to eat but you got
[1:23:30] the clothes
[1:23:32] all about your house and your world
[1:23:35] am i right that's where the problem lays
[1:23:38] is we are so concerned
[1:23:40] about our world instead of what
[1:23:43] god wants in his world his house
[1:23:46] and what he wants and as long as you are
[1:23:50] like that let me say this

[1:23:56] youtube wherever this goes as long as
[1:23:59] you like that
[1:24:00] and you make other things more
[1:24:01] prioritized and you do

[1:24:29] clothed for after all these things do
[1:24:31] the americans seek you like that

[1:24:37] seeks for
[1:24:38] clothing and housing and everything yeah
[1:24:41] and the world not just americans
[1:24:45] for your heavenly father knoweth that

[1:25:00] when you get something because you work
