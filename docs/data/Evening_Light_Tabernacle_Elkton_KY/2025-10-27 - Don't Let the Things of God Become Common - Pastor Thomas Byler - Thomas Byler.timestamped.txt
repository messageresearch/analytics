[0:00] But Abraham talks about some time ago a
[0:04] man on his road to the seaside. He was
[0:07] going for a little rest. He wanted to
[0:08] refresh himself. Ain't that right? You
[0:10] all remember the sword. He wanted to
[0:12] refresh himself and hear the seagulls
[0:14] and all these things, you know. He
[0:16] wanted to go down and relax and really
[0:17] enjoy the blue sky that reflects the
[0:19] water. And on his road to the seashore,
[0:21] he met a man with his old this old salt,
[0:24] the old sailor of the sea. He says,
[0:25] "Where goest thou?" He said, "I go down
[0:27] to the seaore to enjoy the goodness of
[0:30] the sea." The old Saul said, "You know,
[0:33] I don't see nothing strange about it.
[0:35] The waters are just waters. Sky just
[0:37] sky. The gull is just another bird." You
[0:40] see, he had seen so much until it became
[0:44] common to him.
[0:47] It wasn't thrilling to him anymore.
[0:51] How many knows that you got to be
[0:52] careful going to church, hearing the
[0:55] gospel? hearing the preacher it just
[0:58] becomes common to you.
[1:01] Brother Abraham said that commonness is
[1:04] is leisier. It's lukewarmness.
[1:08] Is
[1:08] &gt;&gt; that right?
[1:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't thrilling to him. And
[1:14] that's what's the matter with you
[1:15] people. Brother Bam says you've seen the
[1:17] goodness, the miracles, the divine
[1:20] things OF GOD MOVING AND WORKING UNTIL
[1:22] IT JUST BECOMES COMMON.
[1:27] We hear preachers under the inspiration
[1:30] FIREBALL AND AMEN. WE USED to Amen.
[1:32] preach it. We used to pull
[1:36] &gt;&gt; be careful.
[1:38] Brother M. Brother Michael sits under
[1:40] brother Donnie Reagan. Hello.
[1:43] But it can become common if you aren't
[1:45] careful. Just Well, there's Brother
[1:47] Donnie again. We were listening.
[1:49] Brother, there's Brother Ber, whoever it
[1:51] might be. We sit here, cross our hands,
[1:54] just become common.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing to let it become
[2:00] common. And it's easy to do. You would
[2:03] think that the love of God, the goodness
[2:05] of God, the, you know, the Holy Spirit
[2:07] moving in the atmosphere,
[2:09] amen, would would never get dullled,
[2:12] never get dim, never gets stale. But he
[2:15] can if you aren't careful.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; And you know what? I don't believe if
[2:19] somebody really stays on fire that and
[2:21] they will get away from that and they
[2:23] they will let it become common. But it's
[2:25] when you get away from God a little bit
[2:27] and you let the world come in a little
[2:29] bit too much. You pay too much attention
[2:31] to YouTube or whatever it might be AND
[2:33] YOU DON'T PRAY LIKE YOU OUGHT TO AND all
[2:35] of a sudden YOU GO AWAY FROM IT.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; I mean you got to be careful church.
[2:40] Let's be careful. Evening light
[2:42] tabernacle.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. that we don't let
[2:47] the preacher, the music, whatever it is,
[2:51] become common to where it's just another
[2:54] service. It's just another sermon. He's
[2:57] just doing what he's supposed to do.
[2:59] Lord help us.
