[28:59] [Music]
[29:06] so
[29:13] victory is my
[29:16] victory
[29:18] is mine
[29:20] victory today is
[29:26] [Music]
[29:32] victory today
[29:35] is
[29:37] [Music]
[29:39] victory is my
[29:42] victory
[29:45] is my
[29:46] [Music]
[29:47] victory today is mine

[30:13] love today
[30:15] is mine
[30:18] [Music]
[30:30] [Music]
[30:36] [Music]
[30:44] amen
[30:48] do you enjoy that let's give them
[30:50] another hand tonight
[30:55] i'm trying to figure out why brother
[30:57] thomas's door is always open when they
[30:59] sing and he's ready to come out
[31:01] maybe because he's grandpa
[31:04] amen surely appreciate that and
[31:07] amen there's nothing like seeing your
[31:09] children and your grandchildren serve
[31:11] the lord
[31:12] i i sure miss
[31:14] my little one coming and singing with me
[31:16] she keeps telling me she's going to come
[31:18] back to church but
[31:20] the devil just makes sure that she
[31:22] doesn't get that a chance but
[31:26] god will just give him a greater desire
[31:28] to
[31:28] in the house the lord
[31:30] you know he's the only one that can give
[31:32] him that desire
[31:34] you can preach to him all you want and
[31:38] say what you want but if god doesn't
[31:41] light that fire it doesn't do any good
[31:43] because
[31:44] if they come just because you want them
[31:45] to come
[31:47] somebody else can get them to go do
[31:48] something else so
[31:50] just remember my children in prayer
[31:52] and man they know the truth and
[31:55] they believe the truth but they've got
[31:56] good reasons they say why they don't go
[31:58] but
[31:59] we all know what that story is we all
[32:01] have seen that before but amen just pray
[32:04] for them god bless you let's stand

[38:29] beyond the dimension of time he went
[38:31] over there and one of the things that he
[38:33] said was he says there's not when you
[38:36] get there is no it's not it's a good day
[38:40] and then a bad day
[38:42] it's not pretty good and then pretty bad
[38:46] he said it's just perfect all the time
[38:49] it's the same
[38:51] all the time
[38:53] amen and we can't even imagine in our
[38:55] mind what that perfection how that
[38:57] perfection is
[38:59] but
[39:00] you know i mean no doubt but every one
[39:02] of us thinks about the times
[39:04] perhaps some of the best times in our
[39:06] life
[39:07] you know
[39:08] the very best times in our life
[39:12] and you know no doubt a lot of us had a
[39:14] lot of good times amen
[39:17] really good times
[39:20] and it's uh
[39:21] god made it that way how many know that
[39:23] god made it this way
[39:25] it was actually in the plan god's plan
[39:27] it's the way
[39:28] that he designed it it was a it was
[39:31] specifically purposed for this
[39:34] for us to have seasons to have good
[39:36] times to have bad times
[39:39] amen
[39:41] amen and to be able to go on
[39:43] mountains all the way up on the top of
[39:45] the mountain sometimes
[39:47] you know you feel so good you feel
[39:50] so happy you feel overjoyed
[39:54] you know perhaps we could think about
[39:56] brother brandon running around the tree
[39:57] just praising god just over joy
[40:01] sometimes uh kids they'll get so happy
[40:04] they'll just scream right
[40:06] hey sometimes kids in church will get so
[40:08] happy
[40:09] they'll just scream out
[40:12] that's right y'all remember here at a
[40:14] time or two isn't that right sometimes
[40:15] we get so happy they just scream out we
[40:18] get so oh it's so
[40:20] so smart and what we can bear
[40:23] i think it was brother howard carroll i
[40:24] learned to saying something he says how
[40:26] are you doing
[40:27] something about oh so good uh you know i
[40:30] need two of me or something you know
[40:32] you know i need you need another one of
[40:34] me to enjoy this more
[40:36] the abandoned meat get religious and
[40:38] he'd get in the spirit he began to say
[40:40] well my shirt just fits a little better
[40:42] just right right
[40:44] and and everything is just so much
[40:45] better all of just feeling good
[40:48] amen
[40:50] and i begin to think about this and the
[40:52] purpose of it and what it's all about
[40:54] and how did god intends for it to be
[40:56] that way one time brother bannon makes a
[40:59] mistake and i think y'all probably
[41:00] remember he says you watch your family
[41:02] and that family uh you know they'll be
[41:04] running smooth
[41:06] and then we might take that as a plane
[41:08] going down the plane and everything will
[41:10] run smooth for a long time
[41:12] huh
[41:14] now i'm talking about something that
[41:16] probably every last one of us if we've
[41:18] lived over 20 can fellowship with this
[41:21] there's times when it runs smooth
[41:24] amen
[41:25] and then all of a sudden but the bible
[41:27] says man it'll begin to go bad and he
[41:29] says when it rains it pours
[41:33] they'll just man it'll just go really
[41:35] bad for a while
[41:37] we all know what it's like to have a a
[41:39] good day
[41:40] right
[41:41] everything just falls in place we all
[41:44] know what it's like to have a pretty bad
[41:46] day
[41:47] and then we know what it's like to have
[41:48] a real bad day
[41:51] how many has ever had them
[41:53] just seems like nothing goes right it's
[41:56] terrible
[41:57] right
[41:59] amen kind of like in our marriage or
[42:01] sometimes oh my you're just so in love
[42:03] and you'll have a big old argument and
[42:04] you're just furious you're all tore up
[42:08] well hopefully somebody don't know what
[42:10] i'm talking about there but
[42:11] it does happen right
[42:14] and you got to go back and you got to
[42:16] make up and and then you get to feeling
[42:18] better again but you know it can go from
[42:20] you know
[42:22] i believe it's probably god taught he
[42:23] says you know if you just have felio
[42:25] love his filial love is all you have
[42:28] that feel your love will turn to hate
[42:32] and as we know that filio love it'll go
[42:34] further if it goes too far and so forth
[42:36] and into murder and into killing people
[42:39] who once loved each other hello
[42:42] but we all know what it's like you know
[42:44] you have a pretty good days you have
[42:46] kind of good days well not too bad
[42:49] right
[42:51] things ain't going too bad you know
[42:54] but just to learn how to cope with that
[42:55] learn how to deal with that tonight
[42:58] we're going to learn how to cope with
[42:59] that and what god expects out of all of
[43:02] that amen we've said it many times but
[43:04] we're going to say it again is that
[43:05] right
[43:06] so we'll take an example first we'll
[43:08] start perhaps with
[43:11] i job
[43:11] i was joke man i'll tell you what he was
[43:13] on the mountaintop
[43:15] he was my his children were uh at a
[43:19] party right
[43:21] and i think that's what it was called
[43:23] they were at a party they were having a
[43:25] party together
[43:26] you know and where was job at job was
[43:29] somewhere in his closet somewhere and
[43:30] praying for his children lord if they've
[43:33] sinned in any way god forgive them
[43:35] forgive them
[43:36] and that what he was praying for his
[43:37] children his that's a concern daddy
[43:40] and he was there and he was rich he had
[43:43] everything you could imagine he had
[43:45] flocks he had herbs he had camels he had
[43:48] children he had a big family a big sweet
[43:50] wonderful family
[43:54] hello
[43:56] amen a season for it to go good nobody
[43:58] know this better than solomon not
[44:00] solomon how many knows you go back into
[44:02] the song of solomon different places
[44:04] where he talks about you know proverbs
[44:06] different vanity of vanities how life is
[44:08] vanity and oh he saw the vanity of this
[44:11] world and the vanity of life
[44:15] and i've come to the conclusion myself
[44:17] when i look at it
[44:19] bringing into a thought where brother
[44:21] branham talked about what this world and
[44:23] what this really is
[44:25] i never really thought about it that way
[44:27] until i preached on it
[44:30] and we was talking about how that in
[44:31] this world and how brother bam says when
[44:33] he become born again when he got the new
[44:37] birth
[44:38] he said he was in a what
[44:42] it was like he was in a nightmare
[44:46] he
[44:47] identified this world that we're living
[44:49] in as a nightmare
[44:52] and he's trying to wake up
[44:54] [Music]
[44:58] trying to wake up
[45:02] because you know i mean we
[45:04] as long as things are going pretty good
[45:06] for you and everything you know that's
[45:07] all fine and dandy
[45:10] but
[45:11] when you think about the pain that's out
[45:14] there
[45:15] you think about the murder that's you
[45:16] think about the filth that's out there
[45:19] you think about the evil that's out
[45:21] there you look at your nursing homes and
[45:23] the conditions that people get into when
[45:25] they get older it's no fun thing
[45:30] there's nothing joyous whatsoever it is
[45:32] truly a nightmare
[45:34] i mean as many of those people want to
[45:36] die
[45:37] please let me die since your hand back
[45:40] there not in the head brother bad you've
[45:42] worked there you know they don't want to
[45:44] live in this anymore when i left my army
[45:47] visited my army's bishop
[45:49] of when i was a child here he is and he
[45:51] can't function he can talk for a little
[45:53] bit and then he'll lose his focus and so
[45:55] forth and he'll say he doesn't know why
[45:57] he's up here anymore he wants to go down
[45:59] he wants to go there he kept talking
[46:00] about wanting to go down i know what
[46:01] he's talking about
[46:03] why can't he go down
[46:05] he wants to get out of this world he's
[46:07] done with his world
[46:09] amen and overall that's truly what the
[46:12] what it is this is truly what this world
[46:14] is is a nightmare
[46:15] [Music]
[46:17] how many knows it was a nightmare for
[46:19] lot
[46:20] lot lived in a nightmare when he lived
[46:22] in sodom and two angels came down
[46:25] and those sodomites they come in there
[46:27] and they were wanting to make a
[46:29] relationship with those guys they were
[46:30] beating his door down i don't know about
[46:32] you but if some bunch of homosexuals
[46:34] trying to beat my brother that would be
[46:36] a nightmare
[46:39] huh
[46:41] but how many of those they are trying to
[46:42] take over they are
[46:44] working their agenda pushing their
[46:46] agenda
[46:48] brother bam says if you send your kid to
[46:50] school there or what to become two-fold
[46:53] more a child of hell he didn't have much
[46:55] for schools at all back then
[46:58] huh
[46:59] look at it what it is today
[47:02] amen
[47:04] but anyway we won't go down there
[47:06] but i was trying to say when you think
[47:07] about the nightmare he was saying that
[47:09] that's what this world really is like
[47:10] for a believer
[47:12] if you're too if you're very at home
[47:14] here
[47:16] you better get on your prayer bones
[47:18] you better get it on your knees and
[47:19] realize hey this world is not a fit
[47:22] place to live anymore and it's getting
[47:24] worse by the minute i've said it before
[47:26] i want to say it again
[47:28] listen both here and on the streaming
[47:30] world
[47:32] this snowball is starting to snowball i
[47:35] mean it is really starting to come down
[47:37] over this hill
[47:40] it's going faster and isn't that exactly
[47:42] what the prophet of god said he says in
[47:43] the last few hours of jesus christ's
[47:45] ministry more scripture was fulfilled in
[47:48] the last few hours in his whole life he
[47:50] said that's how it's going to be just
[47:51] before the rapture those scriptures and
[47:53] things in prophecy they're going to
[47:54] fulfill real quickly
[47:56] we believe that that's what's happening
[47:59] it's happening and it's fulfilling very
[48:01] very quickly
[48:03] amen
[48:06] so anyway
[48:07] it's getting darker
[48:09] and you've got to think about it you
[48:10] know i think about the people that i've
[48:12] buried people that worked hard on life
[48:15] work one place were faithful for 40
[48:18] years they had a great retirement plan
[48:23] and they dropped their first retirement
[48:25] check
[48:26] the next one we buried him
[48:29] huh
[48:32] i think he was right about one maybe
[48:34] they got one
[48:35] joe hendrickson
[48:37] huh
[48:38] at kensington he was you know he could
[48:39] have retired he could have had 15 20
[48:41] years of kind of having it nice right
[48:44] well we know joe was a christian so
[48:46] we're not worried he has a greater
[48:48] retirement he would have ever had here
[48:51] is that right but what i was trying to
[48:53] say a while ago it's so that i would say
[48:57] that if it wasn't for the fact that
[48:59] truly is life after death if there is
[49:02] into heaven this wouldn't really be
[49:04] worth it
[49:08] it really wouldn't
[49:10] there's too much disappointment
[49:12] there's too much sorrow there's too much
[49:14] sadness there's too much pain there's
[49:16] too much
[49:18] horrible things it's a horrible world
[49:21] amen because it's governed by the devil
[49:24] if it wasn't for grace if it wasn't for
[49:26] god and that right if it wasn't for the
[49:29] fact that you know that god
[49:31] has had this plan and he allowed it to
[49:34] come into this
[49:35] to get a people ready amen are you with
[49:38] me together people ready to mold
[49:41] character in you and in me that's fit to
[49:44] live with him through eternity that's
[49:46] the purpose of times and seasons
[49:49] that's whether it's good that's where
[49:51] there's bad that's why you have your
[49:53] mountaintops and you have your valleys
[49:55] you have your deserts
[49:59] amen
[50:01] brother glenn i'm here to tell you
[50:03] sister

[50:06] spiritual desert

[50:14] and you walk and it's dry and oh my
[50:17] you're looking for an oasis you're
[50:19] looking for amen some trees you're
[50:21] looking for a little bit of water

[50:40] now i'm going to say something i never
[50:42] said but just about the time you just
[50:44] wonder if there's ever going to be an
[50:45] end
[50:46] god brings light at the end of time
[50:49] god turns it all around all of a sudden
[50:51] you look over the horizon you see the
[50:53] top of a tree
[50:55] i see a top of a tree and i know where
[50:58] there's a tree there's got to be some
[51:00] grass
[51:00] hey where there's some grass there's got
[51:02] to be some water hello and you come and
[51:05] you reach you come out of that boy you
[51:07] can regard you can leap you can dance
[51:10] where before you didn't feel like
[51:12] dancing
[51:13] he didn't feel like shouting
[51:15] huh
[51:16] i call it a desert because
[51:18] it's long trials
[51:20] trials last
[51:23] not a week not a day it's not a bad day
[51:26] i know what it's like to not have a bad
[51:28] day i know what it's like not to have a
[51:30] bad month
[51:32] i know what it's like to have a bad
[51:34] decade
[51:37] huh
[51:38] right many many years
[51:41] amen
[51:47] you know i thought about this message
[51:48] and i thought about job i thought about
[51:50] joseph how did joseph you know he had a
[51:52] vision of how our vision our dream of
[51:54] how you know even his mom and dad you
[51:56] know they were even going to bow to him
[51:58] and do obesity and everything he had all
[52:00] of this and what happened one bad thing
[52:03] after another it happened to him
[52:07] i went back and read joseph a little bit
[52:08] today and her brother said we're gonna
[52:10] kill him
[52:11] [Music]
[52:12] huh
[52:13] and you talk about god controlling the
[52:15] brains how many knows god controls
[52:17] people's brains
[52:19] amen and one of the brothers said ah
[52:20] let's not do that we don't want to have
[52:22] blood and let's just throw him in this
[52:23] pit
[52:26] and they threw him in the pit and then
[52:27] all of a sudden
[52:29] some some foreigners come traitors and
[52:31] so forth like caravan come and they say
[52:33] hey let's just sell them to them
[52:35] huh and sell a kill of them
[52:38] amen that was god how many that was god
[52:40] in god's hand all in god's doing god had
[52:43] it all
[52:45] why you and i can rejoice to know that
[52:48] god don't allow something to come upon
[52:51] you
[52:52] unless
[52:53] it's permitted
[52:58] ah this shouldn't have been well
[53:00] sometimes maybe
[53:02] you bring things upon yourself
[53:04] huh
[53:05] but most of the time we know when that
[53:07] time is not right
[53:09] most of the time if you didn't pay your
[53:11] water bill you knew what was going to
[53:13] happen
[53:15] you didn't pay the electric bill and
[53:16] they even send you a tax you ignore that
[53:18] and when they shut it off and it cost
[53:20] you an extra 45 dollars for reconnection
[53:22] you know that wasn't god that was your
[53:24] stupidity
[53:27] your negligence things like that things
[53:29] that you do and bring upon yourself but
[53:31] when there's something that is out of
[53:33] your control maybe you don't understand
[53:36] then you know it's what god allows
[53:40] amen he had this goal that and joseph
[53:42] had to go through these things god
[53:43] allowed them to go through these things
[53:45] you
[53:46] my you would think that god would have a
[53:48] mediocre about this a little more
[53:51] mediocre
[53:52] a little bit not as hard
[53:55] maybe that is quite as comfortable no he
[53:56] didn't he allows it to get really bad
[54:01] i mean he allows it to get really bad
[54:03] like he did joe joe was on top of the
[54:06] mountain he was on top of the world
[54:10] and all of a sudden it come crashing
[54:12] down
[54:14] then how many knows it was god's doing
[54:19] that's right
[54:22] you go back read job
[54:25] job i mean god from what i understand
[54:27] talk to the devil talk to satan because
[54:29] he comes to the house he says have you
[54:30] checked out my son
[54:32] have you considered my servant job
[54:35] they ain't not like him
[54:37] they ain't not like my servant joke
[54:41] and the devil says yeah i know but
[54:43] you've got a hedge around him
[54:46] you got a hedge around him and if you
[54:48] take the head you out and you let things
[54:50] get bad
[54:53] he'll curse you to your face
[54:57] no he won't no he won't
[54:59] yeah he will no he won't yeah i will no
[55:02] we won't

[55:07] see
[55:07] that says all right
[55:10] all right we'll do that
[55:12] i'll let you take it all the way all of
[55:14] these things just don't touch his life
[55:17] joke goes home on monday you talk about
[55:19] a bad week
[55:22] huh
[55:22] from the top of the mountain
[55:25] and i don't know about you but i
[55:27] wouldn't mind so much if i found out
[55:29] that all my camels got killed and the
[55:30] tornado came and got all my even my
[55:32] lambs and everything else really oh my
[55:35] oh my i lost all my sheep
[55:38] but i'll tell you i guarantee you just
[55:40] one thing it'll rip your heart out if
[55:43] you find out all your kids are dead
[55:49] knows
[55:50] we may scream to the top of our little
[55:54] lungs with joy sometimes but there's
[55:56] another time of life where you
[55:58] weep
[55:59] bitterly
[56:01] in this life you also find there's a
[56:03] season for weeping
[56:06] bitterly
[56:07] perhaps so strong that you can't even
[56:09] stand anymore you might fall to the
[56:11] ground you might pass out because of the
[56:14] immensity of the bitterness
[56:18] of having the love part with a loved one
[56:21] amen
[56:23] god help us you know we might lose our
[56:26] wife we might lose our husband we might
[56:27] lose grandpa or mom or dad or so forth
[56:30] and we know that's
[56:31] you know that's a certain amount of
[56:34] uh weeping a certain amount of
[56:37] sorrow but i understand
[56:39] they say that if you lose a child it's
[56:41] worse
[56:45] really bad if you lose your child one of
[56:48] your children go before you
[56:50] amen that's why us as parents probably
[56:52] all of us desire to go before our
[56:54] children do
[56:56] why because somebody knows it doesn't
[56:58] matter who or what them is your children
[57:00] and you love them with all your heart
[57:03] amen
[57:04] i hope i never have to experience it
[57:06] but in life you'll find that there's
[57:08] times when it's such bitter sorrow
[57:12] jesus even knew it
[57:14] the bible said he whipped bitterly
[57:16] isn't that right
[57:18] he knew what it was like to have to read
[57:19] uh raise lazarus from the dead but he
[57:22] also knew what he was to be betrayed by
[57:24] his friends and his everybody he'd be
[57:27] all alone
[57:28] to come to his own his own receive him
[57:30] not amen
[57:32] brother branham he said you know jesus
[57:34] didn't die from the spirit he died of a
[57:35] broken heart
[57:37] my
[57:39] died of a broken
[57:41] heart
[57:42] because i think if i'm not wrong be
[57:44] after he was dead they put that spear
[57:46] inside
[57:48] the water in the blood came out just to
[57:49] make sure he was dead
[57:52] amen but look at job
[57:55] from top
[57:56] all the way
[58:00] to the bottom
[58:02] amen
[58:06] and guess what can we say there's
[58:08] another season
[58:10] that is down from the bottom
[58:14] down from the bottom
[58:16] because remember
[58:17] job was faithful
[58:19] he said he worshipped went to church the
[58:21] next sunday he said the lord gave the
[58:23] lord taken away blessed be the name of
[58:26] the lord
[58:28] and then there was another one made you
[58:30] know
[58:31] he said sure yeah you won that one god
[58:33] you got me there
[58:35] but i guarantee you
[58:37] you know the man will do that but you
[58:39] let me touch his flesh
[58:42] let me touch his flesh then he'll curse
[58:44] you to the face to your face god says
[58:46] nah
[58:51] i don't know about you brother glenn but
[58:53] if i'd have been god i said devil you're
[58:56] pretty dumb
[58:57] don't you know i know everything
[59:01] i already know what job was doing gonna
[59:03] dude so why are you standing here
[59:04] arguing with me
[59:06] you know i'm that smart you know i know
[59:08] the future
[59:10] amen
[59:11] but he's not too smart
[59:14] huh god said no you won't
[59:16] [Music]
[59:17] said the devil said yeah he will i
[59:21] he said let go at it
[59:23] go ahead
[59:24] and job
[59:27] got miserable
[59:29] he got boils on his skin i don't know
[59:31] what all kinds of stuff he got right it
[59:34] was horrible
[59:36] i don't know about you but i've been out
[59:37] in the woods and when i get bit
[59:39] that's horrible all right i don't like
[59:41] the scratch here i've got one right here
[59:43] and
[59:44] and just them chiggers driving me crazy
[59:47] i can't imagine what job all over his
[59:49] body
[59:49] [Music]
[59:51] kind of like pharaoh no wonder he let
[59:53] him go all them fleas under his sheets
[59:55] and biting himself he said
[59:57] get out of here i can't take it aboard
[1:00:00] that right
[1:00:02] just go
[1:00:03] of course it was after the death he was
[1:00:05] even stubborn enough to wait until death
[1:00:06] of his firstborn
[1:00:08] then he said go
[1:00:09] god got his attention
[1:00:12] but job boils and and he was on the ash
[1:00:15] sheep but oh he was so miserable
[1:00:20] and if you'll read it he cursed the day
[1:00:21] that he was born and all kinds of things
[1:00:24] that he said
[1:00:25] you know
[1:00:26] everything which he wouldn't have been
[1:00:29] born and all these other things but he
[1:00:30] never would say
[1:00:32] he never would curse god
[1:00:35] right
[1:00:37] and then what did god do
[1:00:39] give him a revelation
[1:00:41] amen that on the last days my in my
[1:00:43] flesh i shall see god he got a
[1:00:45] revelation of god
[1:00:47] and god restored his life back
[1:00:51] restored children back
[1:00:54] is that right
[1:00:56] brother bratton was wide enough to know
[1:00:58] that he said that he had given him over
[1:01:00] yonder
[1:01:01] his children were preserved
[1:01:05] you know let me just say this since it
[1:01:08] comes
[1:01:09] any parent that loses a child
[1:01:12] if they know have complete confidence
[1:01:15] that the child is in heaven
[1:01:17] they can have some confidence and some
[1:01:19] comfort
[1:01:20] because even paul said don't
[1:01:22] weep you know like those who have no
[1:01:25] hope
[1:01:26] because if you don't have any hope
[1:01:27] you're going to weep twice as much
[1:01:29] if you think they're lost
[1:01:31] but if you know that they have hope if
[1:01:32] you believe that they're there
[1:01:34] that is great comfort and knowing that
[1:01:36] his kids were there he knew they're in a
[1:01:38] better place
[1:01:39] and sure the house fell in on them
[1:01:41] killed them all
[1:01:42] we're all going to die some way somehow
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:49] it's something that you think about it
[1:01:51] how many i don't know about you but
[1:01:54] i believe the bible says god gave us all
[1:01:56] things freely in life that we might
[1:01:58] enjoy it god does want you to enjoy life
[1:02:01] he does he gives us things freely and
[1:02:03] enjoy
[1:02:05] amen
[1:02:07] and now i'm thankful for that
[1:02:08] job he was restored all that so he went
[1:02:10] back up god raised him back up
[1:02:13] joseph he went through the horrible
[1:02:15] horrible it seemed like when it rained
[1:02:17] it
[1:02:18] poured you know it just doesn't come a
[1:02:21] little bit it just keeps coming keeps
[1:02:23] coming keeps coming
[1:02:25] how many knows god said that he wouldn't
[1:02:27] put more on you that you're able to bear
[1:02:33] what about those who can't bear it
[1:02:36] maybe they're not his
[1:02:38] huh
[1:02:38] because if you're his he promised he
[1:02:40] won't put more on than he can
[1:02:42] maybe somebody was impersonating or
[1:02:43] something i don't know but i know god is
[1:02:46] true
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:49] so how many is going on for that that
[1:02:51] guy won't put more on you then he can
[1:02:53] bear i was looking up smooth running and
[1:02:55] so forth because i was looking up where
[1:02:57] he was talking about a family i'd run
[1:02:59] smooth and everything and i've come
[1:03:01] across this place where he says he
[1:03:03] believed that it was lincoln or one of
[1:03:04] them that said he says he was made the
[1:03:07] statement in time of peace
[1:03:10] prepare for war
[1:03:12] he says and that would be a good for us
[1:03:14] thing for us to think about it in the
[1:03:16] time when everything's running smooth
[1:03:20] he says you better get ready
[1:03:23] isn't that the truth
[1:03:25] oh my we love i don't know about you but
[1:03:28] it's so easy it's it's uh to praise god
[1:03:31] on the mountain right when things are
[1:03:32] running smooth it's all good
[1:03:35] but get ready
[1:03:37] you're in this world
[1:03:39] that season's fixing to change
[1:03:41] just like it changes from summer
[1:03:44] to fall
[1:03:46] from fall to winter
[1:03:48] and from winter
[1:03:50] to springtime
[1:03:51] amen
[1:03:52] just as those seasons change
[1:03:56] are the seasons of our life
[1:03:58] change
[1:03:59] but when everything's running smooth get
[1:04:01] ready he says
[1:04:02] because satan isn't going to let it run
[1:04:05] smooth very long
[1:04:08] amen
[1:04:10] not very long
[1:04:13] how many knows let's talk about another
[1:04:14] one let's talk about israel for a few
[1:04:16] minutes
[1:04:19] israel knew what it was like to be on
[1:04:21] the mountaintop to god on the mountain
[1:04:24] right when they left egypt it says they
[1:04:27] were rejoicing if you ever watch the
[1:04:29] movie they're rejoicing in their oh my
[1:04:32] they got all kinds of gold it says the
[1:04:34] bible says the egyptians came them
[1:04:36] silver and gold and jewels and packed
[1:04:38] them full of stuff they went with their
[1:04:40] pockets full of money man they they were
[1:04:42] ready wow i got a perch full of stuff my
[1:04:45] neighbor gave me everything they had
[1:04:48] huh
[1:04:49] why they were happy weren't they they
[1:04:52] were on top of the world praising god
[1:04:55] but you know paul
[1:04:57] told us in first corinthians there
[1:05:00] that there's a direction that israel
[1:05:02] went that you don't want to follow
[1:05:05] that they were examples of what you
[1:05:07] don't want to be murmurers complainers
[1:05:10] and idolaters and all these things how
[1:05:12] many knows he never said that about
[1:05:13] moses he never said it about abraham's
[1:05:15] unbelief in the new testament but yet
[1:05:18] paul said it about them why
[1:05:21] because they're all as jesus said
[1:05:23] they're dead
[1:05:24] they're lost
[1:05:26] amen
[1:05:30] so there they were on top of the
[1:05:32] mountain
[1:05:33] season of victory
[1:05:35] victory is mine victory is mine
[1:05:40] well what about when victory isn't yours
[1:05:42] you're down and defeated
[1:05:44] down on the bottom
[1:05:48] amen because
[1:05:51] see this life we were born in sin
[1:05:54] shaped iniquity coming to this world
[1:05:57] speaking lies
[1:05:59] we come in a horrible place
[1:06:01] it was in a bad place we were
[1:06:04] to begin with
[1:06:06] amen and god wants to take and make
[1:06:09] something
[1:06:11] good out of something
[1:06:13] bad
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:15] life is like a rollercoaster right
[1:06:18] up and down
[1:06:21] huh
[1:06:22] and then sometimes you have to straight
[1:06:24] places
[1:06:30] i this just comes to me says all right
[1:06:32] i want to give everybody some
[1:06:33] rollercoaster advice
[1:06:35] you know cause i remember when i went on
[1:06:37] the first day for a rollercoaster one
[1:06:39] time and and they went up over the hill
[1:06:41] way too fast you know
[1:06:43] sure i was buckled in i was fine with
[1:06:45] that i'm buckled in but i guarantee you
[1:06:48] these wheels are coming off the track
[1:06:50] over this yo
[1:06:51] right
[1:06:52] they're gonna just go out over
[1:06:54] well i learned later you know they have
[1:06:56] them on bottom they've got them gripped
[1:06:58] on they're not going to fly out
[1:07:01] it's going to hold there you know
[1:07:02] but i guess when i went on the one i was
[1:07:04] afraid that's what scared me was what
[1:07:06] was it
[1:07:07] it's not going to come back on the
[1:07:08] tracks so don't worry you're not going
[1:07:11] to leave the tracks
[1:07:13] how many please that's the way it's with
[1:07:14] christ folks that's up and it's down but
[1:07:17] just stay buckled in god's got you here
[1:07:19] he's got a control of it he ain't gonna
[1:07:21] crash
[1:07:24] unfortunately i guess the news here in
[1:07:25] the last lately a couple of them people
[1:07:27] getting killed on them things and stuff
[1:07:29] stuff wears out it's man-made
[1:07:31] amen
[1:07:33] but it's so
[1:07:35] oh my how many knows that
[1:07:38] especially
[1:07:39] especially younger
[1:07:41] now we like to say that sisters and
[1:07:44] women

[1:07:48] right don't we like to say that
[1:07:51] their emotions up and down and moan
[1:07:54] they're just supposed to be more
[1:07:55] emotional

[1:07:58] well let me tell you something i mean
[1:07:59] those guys
[1:08:00] we don't we aren't so far behind
[1:08:03] amen if we don't have christ

[1:09:52] folks
[1:09:53] this world is not so inviting anymore as
[1:09:55] time goes on
[1:09:57] how many knows that's why it is so
[1:10:00] important to have christ
[1:10:04] he made it that way god designed it that
[1:10:06] way why
[1:10:08] to let you know that you need an anchor
[1:10:12] you have to have something that anchors
[1:10:15] you
[1:10:16] so whether you're in the valley or
[1:10:18] whether you're on the mountain
[1:10:22] whether you're in a storm or wherever
[1:10:25] you are
[1:10:27] you really don't change
[1:10:29] it really don't change you
[1:10:32] aren't you glad for that
[1:10:35] because if you don't have the anchor of
[1:10:36] the holy ghost
[1:10:38] well i'll tell you what somebody asked
[1:10:40] you how you're doing i'm not doing so
[1:10:42] great i'm just doing terrible i'll tell
[1:10:44] you what i've had a back pain i've had a
[1:10:46] toe pain i've had a knee i don't want to
[1:10:48] hear about you all grapes that's just
[1:10:50] part of it
[1:10:52] yeah
[1:10:53] you walk around
[1:10:55] oh yeah i'm doing great praise be to god
[1:10:58] everybody's crying and learning to smile
[1:11:00] through your tears
[1:11:03] that's what you got to do
[1:11:05] right you got to learn to smile through
[1:11:07] your tears why because you know
[1:11:10] you have something more than just this
[1:11:11] life
[1:11:12] you got something more than just those
[1:11:14] high places
[1:11:15] those screaming hollers and praise be to
[1:11:17] gods or those deserts or those valleys
[1:11:20] those low places
[1:11:22] isn't that right
[1:11:25] paul he was prestigious he had probably
[1:11:27] a nice house
[1:11:29] i'll tell you what
[1:11:30] his trim the nicest table the nicest
[1:11:33] chairs he was the next gay ephesus he
[1:11:35] was prestige he was in good standings
[1:11:37] everybody said there goes saul that saul
[1:11:41] pharisee of the pharisee he called
[1:11:43] himself
[1:11:45] and there he was and after he got
[1:11:46] converted he went from jail to jail
[1:11:49] didn't have but a coat yet to ask for an
[1:11:51] extra coat
[1:11:53] amen his good times when him and paul
[1:11:55] and silas got thrown in the inner jail
[1:11:59] they were at midnight
[1:12:03] oh i tell you that it's so hard to be
[1:12:05] agreed
[1:12:08] no
[1:12:10] they begin to pray and sing songs
[1:12:13] they begin to worship god glory
[1:12:15] hallelujah
[1:12:17] huh
[1:12:18] remember brother bam talk about the
[1:12:20] church age book you know he says you
[1:12:22] know he did all that he did for us and
[1:12:24] what we have to do is to learn to
[1:12:25] conduct ourselves with joy amidst the
[1:12:27] trials that god allows to come our way
[1:12:30] amen to conduct ourselves
[1:12:33] with joy
[1:12:34] in the midst of the trials that god
[1:12:36] allows
[1:12:38] to come our way
[1:12:43] i've learned not to get too excited
[1:12:44] about stuff
[1:12:46] don't get so excited
[1:12:48] when an ambulance comes and you're next
[1:12:50] to death
[1:12:52] you want to take your
[1:12:54] uh maybe put something around your arm
[1:12:56] and you're bleeding and stuff and this
[1:12:58] out of the other they know what they
[1:13:00] need to do first don't panic keep you
[1:13:02] cool right and do what you know you need
[1:13:05] to do we'll get to that in a minute huh
[1:13:09] that's the way the christian is don't
[1:13:10] let your trials that come upon you
[1:13:13] suddenly and surprise you don't let them
[1:13:16] surprise you and don't let them throw
[1:13:17] you off guard
[1:13:19] amen
[1:13:22] my
[1:13:23] but look aren't you glad we don't have
[1:13:25] to have
[1:13:26] amen go with the way that we feel all
[1:13:29] the time
[1:13:31] like i said coming to church i was
[1:13:33] sleepy i was tired i said how can i
[1:13:34] preach feeling like this i feel terrible
[1:13:38] you know what i did
[1:13:42] i went to dairy queen
[1:13:44] i went to dairy queen and i got me a big
[1:13:46] old shake a vanilla shake like i need it
[1:13:50] huh i got me a crispy chicken sandwich
[1:13:53] that's right not a burger
[1:13:55] the the flamethrower was
[1:13:58] yesterday oh my
[1:14:01] god me some fries i ate all of that down
[1:14:04] i'll tell you what i felt pretty good i
[1:14:06] you know and i realized maybe i need
[1:14:07] food
[1:14:09] nightmare i thought came to my mind how
[1:14:11] can you eat before preaching aren't you
[1:14:13] supposed to be fat and i said i'm not
[1:14:14] fasting right now i need food right now
[1:14:18] paul said whatever you do do it with
[1:14:21] faith
[1:14:22] right
[1:14:24] but just to show you you know yeah yeah
[1:14:28] you're feeling this way and after you
[1:14:29] know in the next hour or so you feel a
[1:14:31] different way
[1:14:33] folks i'm telling you we'd be very every
[1:14:35] one of us would be hard to live with if
[1:14:37] we live by our emotions
[1:14:42] it would real a real be a ride
[1:14:44] i think in james it talks about you know
[1:14:46] a double man double-minded man is
[1:14:48] unstable in all his ways he's like a
[1:14:50] wave driven with the wind
[1:14:53] a person without the holy ghost in this
[1:14:56] world it's like having a sailboat with
[1:14:58] no rudder
[1:14:59] wherever the wind pushes them that's
[1:15:01] where they go

[1:15:48] valves of murphy's law and it hits us

[1:15:58] cup of coffee and it's all on your lap
[1:16:01] can't i even hold a cup of coffee
[1:16:04] anymore
[1:16:06] no it's just a trial sent your way

[1:16:18] that whether i feel like i'm a christian
[1:16:21] or whether i feel like i'm saved that
[1:16:22] ain't got nothing to do with it i know
[1:16:24] the experience that god gave me i know
[1:16:26] that he has kept me and helped me
[1:16:28] through every storm through every wind
[1:16:30] amen
[1:16:32] so i know that just because you don't
[1:16:34] feel like this or this out of the other
[1:16:35] that's got nothing to do with it
[1:16:38] amen
[1:16:41] oh yeah first thing god allowed israel
[1:16:43] to do is go down to the red sea get in
[1:16:44] the trap
[1:16:46] and what did they do did they praise the
[1:16:48] lord
[1:16:49] but wasn't that was what god was looking
[1:16:51] for that's exactly what god was looking
[1:16:53] for
[1:16:54] he wanted them to dance on this side of
[1:16:56] the river
[1:16:58] they wanted miriam and them to dance on
[1:17:00] this attitude that's what god was
[1:17:02] looking for praise be to god god
[1:17:05] delivered us out of egypt and look here
[1:17:08] they have to come after us
[1:17:11] then poor people
[1:17:13] we're wondering what god's gonna do next
[1:17:16] let's just praise him
[1:17:20] you know what let me just be a
[1:17:22] presumptuous preacher tonight is that
[1:17:24] all right
[1:17:26] they wouldn't have got grounded in the
[1:17:27] red sea god had come down with the fire
[1:17:30] and destroyed them guys
[1:17:32] he'd been so happy with his children
[1:17:35] because they were doing what they wanted
[1:17:36] just like the three he was children of
[1:17:38] the fiery furnace right
[1:17:40] he was so happy with him he came and
[1:17:42] walked in there with them
[1:17:45] he didn't give up israel would have done
[1:17:47] that that's what god was looking for
[1:17:49] that's what god is looking for you and
[1:17:50] you you and me
[1:17:52] is in those valleys those deep
[1:17:57] valleys
[1:17:59] i mean not all of us is a joke right
[1:18:02] not all of us is a mo joe
[1:18:04] a uh
[1:18:05] israel or a joseph
[1:18:08] but this is one thing
[1:18:10] that we all are if you're sons and
[1:18:12] daughters of god hebrews 12 says
[1:18:15] that if you're his son
[1:18:17] you are going to be chastised
[1:18:20] every son that comes to him is chastened
[1:18:23] am i right
[1:18:24] god is going to chasten you he is going
[1:18:27] to rebuke you he is going to correct you
[1:18:30] and that right
[1:18:32] brother bam says one place he says when
[1:18:33] he was in his bottom when he was in his
[1:18:36] valley
[1:18:37] when he was in the bottom of the bottom
[1:18:39] of his valley
[1:18:41] you know right and god he was calling on
[1:18:43] god to at least spare sharon rose
[1:18:46] his baby
[1:18:47] god's buried i did this not my baby
[1:18:51] god put a black sheet on him the devil
[1:18:54] tried to tell him
[1:18:56] well he don't love you
[1:18:58] and brother in his mind was thinking
[1:19:00] devil's trying to tell him well if god's
[1:19:01] going to be that way
[1:19:03] am i right
[1:19:04] that's right and brother branham she
[1:19:06] says the lord give the lord taken away
[1:19:08] blessed be the name of the lord and he
[1:19:10] makes a statement that every sun comes
[1:19:12] to that spot
[1:19:13] every sun comes to that
[1:19:16] all the way at the bottom of the valley
[1:19:18] to see what you're made out of
[1:19:21] so if it's peace if it's running
[1:19:22] smoothly what do you do
[1:19:25] keep your head up
[1:19:26] be ready
[1:19:28] here he comes
[1:19:30] amen
[1:19:34] that's right
[1:19:35] every son
[1:19:36] of god must be chastened
[1:19:38] must be tried
[1:19:40] paul certainly was
[1:19:44] what kind of a man was paul
[1:19:46] he had been beaten
[1:19:48] how many remembers all the things that
[1:19:50] he said there in corinthians about he
[1:19:52] was shipwrecked he was left for dead
[1:19:55] thrice was not beaten with rods
[1:19:57] he had a rough life
[1:20:01] he had a hard
[1:20:03] life life was certainly a nightmare for
[1:20:06] him
[1:20:07] but it didn't matter he could go through
[1:20:08] the nightmare as long as god is in it
[1:20:11] how many knows we can go through this
[1:20:13] nightmare
[1:20:14] as long as we have god
[1:20:18] that god that is what god wants he wants
[1:20:21] us to have an anchor
[1:20:23] of our
[1:20:24] soul
[1:20:25] not be tossed by every valley by every
[1:20:27] mountain
[1:20:30] i'm still going to have my mountaintop
[1:20:31] experience i'm still going to shout
[1:20:33] scream
[1:20:34] hopefully get happy enough to dance in
[1:20:36] the spirit
[1:20:38] huh sure
[1:20:40] i'm still going to have my low times
[1:20:41] when i'm so sad i don't know how to get
[1:20:43] any sadder
[1:20:45] but it don't matter whichever it is i'm
[1:20:48] still going to worship and praise god
[1:20:50] amen
[1:20:53] paul said
[1:20:55] this
[1:20:57] is what paul said
[1:20:59] i speak in respect of need
[1:21:02] or of want
[1:21:03] for i have learned in whatsoever state i
[1:21:06] am
[1:21:07] therewith to complain
[1:21:10] therewith to be
[1:21:12] content
[1:21:16] my contentment
[1:21:19] i know both how to be a based
[1:21:25] can you imagine when he was left for
[1:21:27] dead bleeding they thought he was dead
[1:21:29] we killed the guy
[1:21:31] he wasn't quite dead yet
[1:21:35] shipwrecked
[1:21:37] wasn't he didn't he have ship how many
[1:21:39] times did he have shipwrecked
[1:21:42] two or three times maybe he was
[1:21:43] shipwrecked
[1:21:45] how can you miss
[1:21:47] i would have a little complex after a
[1:21:49] while hey i ain't getting on this boat
[1:21:51] everybody goes down
[1:21:56] one wasn't too happy with it god allowed
[1:21:58] it
[1:21:59] right
[1:22:00] paul had it rough
[1:22:02] and in his inauguration
[1:22:05] in paul's inauguration
[1:22:07] when god called him
[1:22:09] he said that god showed him all the
[1:22:11] things that he
[1:22:12] must
[1:22:13] suffer
[1:22:15] he says he's you buddy i'm here to tell
[1:22:16] you i'm introducing you buddy you're
[1:22:19] going to have a hard life
[1:22:20] you're going to suffer a lot of things
[1:22:22] for the kingdom of god's sake
[1:22:25] but he had something in here
[1:22:27] he had joy
[1:22:29] and peace
[1:22:30] and an anchor it didn't matter if he did
[1:22:33] die
[1:22:34] am i right he says i'm more than willing
[1:22:37] to go up to jerusalem and be killed
[1:22:39] for i have a desire to be with present
[1:22:41] with the lord but it's needful for me to
[1:22:42] hear to stay with you but my desire is
[1:22:45] to be with him
[1:22:46] because he knew where he stood he had an
[1:22:48] anchor
[1:22:49] in his soul
[1:22:51] i trust everybody here
[1:22:53] has that anchor
[1:22:54] in your soul because if you don't you're
[1:22:57] in for the ride of your life
[1:23:00] i mean it's all them tattoos all that
[1:23:02] they're all just being woof
[1:23:04] any women to come i'm gonna load ring it
[1:23:07] i'm gonna put an earring i'm gonna put
[1:23:09] this big old thing
[1:23:11] hmm i know who is in the neighborhood i
[1:23:13] shouldn't say too much but there was one
[1:23:15] guy that was talking about going into
[1:23:16] the ministry and he had one of these
[1:23:18] african where they take the ears put a
[1:23:19] big big o in it big big old circle you
[1:23:22] know they make it bigger and bigger i'm
[1:23:24] like dear lord what have we got to
[1:23:26] somebody want to go into ministry
[1:23:27] looking like an african heathen
[1:23:33] huh
[1:23:34] i was i was me and my wife going down
[1:23:37] the road you know you can't go to dairy
[1:23:38] crew without them having a bull bull
[1:23:40] ring in their nose anymore
[1:23:44] if you took a picture of the african
[1:23:46] heathens
[1:23:48] and put some of these tattooed people up
[1:23:50] these over here these american heathers
[1:23:52] look worse than the africans probably
[1:23:55] and it just kind of hit us it kind of
[1:23:57] hit me and my wife how that even brother
[1:23:59] bam said that civilization the pinnacle
[1:24:01] always spins back so what he said
[1:24:04] think about that he said that the 50s
[1:24:05] and 60s he says it'll go right back to
[1:24:07] hedonism look at what his prophecy is
[1:24:10] exactly right
[1:24:11] swinging back now there are a bunch of
[1:24:13] heathens out there with a bunch of paint
[1:24:15] all over their face and nose and arms
[1:24:17] painting themselves up
[1:24:19] just
[1:24:20] like
[1:24:21] heathens
[1:24:23] nose rings earrings all these other
[1:24:24] things
[1:24:27] tossed
[1:24:28] with the wind because they have no anger
[1:24:32] their emotions
[1:24:33] feelings
[1:24:37] no wonder our politics our politicians
[1:24:40] can't get along
[1:24:42] they got if you ain't got god you can't
[1:24:45] get along with nobody you can't get
[1:24:46] along with your dog
[1:24:51] you'll kick him
[1:24:53] when he's just being a dog and wanting
[1:24:55] the nibble
[1:24:58] huh
[1:25:00] no wonder the world's in the state it is
[1:25:02] because they don't have god
[1:25:04] they don't have christ
[1:25:05] they haven't got the holy ghost how many
[1:25:06] is glad for the holy ghost
[1:25:08] folks i don't know about you but i don't
[1:25:10] i want the holy ghost more than anything
