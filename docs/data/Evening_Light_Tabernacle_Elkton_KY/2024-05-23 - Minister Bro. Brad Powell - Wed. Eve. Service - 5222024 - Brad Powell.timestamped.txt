[5:11] tonight thankful Lord Jesus that once
[5:13] again to be assembled together in Your
[5:15] Name Lord and we realize that those
[5:17] words to that song they're just as real
[5:20] today as they were when you spoke them
[5:22] on the shores of Galilee Lord that you
[5:25] still have a table spread and you still
[5:28] call to your children to come and to
[5:30] dine spiritual food in due season you've

[5:51] of the service May honor and glory be
[5:53] brought to your name
[5:55] God lord and we thank you for each one
[5:57] that is here tonight Lord and for those
[5:59] that'll be listening listening we pray
[6:00] God your blessing upon them Lord Jesus
[6:02] we ask God that you bestow a special
[6:05] blessing upon the minister Brother Brad
[6:07] tonight as he brings the word tonight
[6:09] Lord may it be just the right word for
[6:11] the right hour just what we have need of
[6:13] and we just know that you work that way
[6:16] Lord and we just ask God you'll receive
[6:17] our worship and our praise to you
[6:19] tonight in Jesus name amen and amen you
[6:23] can be seated for a second amen I'm
[6:25] going to do something just a little
[6:26] different amen I've had a pretty good
[6:29] rest amen and so amen hadn't preached
[6:32] for a little bit and today I was just
[6:33] had a little thought so can I just
[6:35] preach to you for just a couple minutes
[6:37] amen my thought was on Amen and
[6:39] surrendering amen that's what my thought
[6:41] was on the power of surrender and so
[6:44] forth amen we know that to surrender is
[6:45] to submit it's to yield and the
[6:48] international basically symbol of
[6:50] surrender is amen how many knows what it
[6:54] is right I don't care if you're I
[6:57] don't care if you're North Korea I don't
[6:58] care where you are you put your hands up
[7:00] that means you surrender you yield amen
[7:03] praise the Lord and we're thankful for
[7:04] that because it also means that uh
[7:06] whatever battle you're fighting it means
[7:08] that you have yielded Amen to the
[7:12] opposition or to another party and
[7:14] you've become by surrendering you become
[7:16] a prisoner amen how many believe that by
[7:19] surrendering you come become a prisoner
[7:21] amen and sometimes that's not easy to do
[7:24] people don't want to surrender to Christ
[7:25] people would rather die and go to hell
[7:28] than to surrender They'll Never
[7:30] Surrender they'll never yield amen but
[7:33] God's people will yield amen they'll
[7:35] surrender and you become a prisoner and
[7:37] when you are a prisoner amen that
[7:41] whoever you're a prisoner to owns
[7:44] you they own you both uh Body Soul and
[7:48] Spirit ain't that right they want to
[7:50] kill you they can kill you if they want
[7:51] to make a slave out of you make you work
[7:54] make you do this whatever it is you
[7:55] become subject to the will of the one
[7:58] that you surrender to amen is anybody
[8:00] listening to to me tonight how many
[8:01] please that that's exactly what the
[8:03] Christian does when we yield to Christ
[8:05] amen now he has the power to do whatever
[8:07] he wants with you and through you and
[8:09] work through you amen just had a little
[8:11] little mini sermon here but just a
[8:13] little bit of a exhortation amen but we
[8:16] be become a prisoner you also become a
[8:18] slave amen am mean you become a servant
[8:20] that's what servant means sometimes is
[8:22] amen you become a slave amen we're know
[8:24] that we're love slaves to Christ isn't
[8:26] that how many believes that we're love
[8:28] slaves to Christ praise the Lord amen a
[8:31] prisoner to him tend I like the fact
[8:34] that you become subject to the will of
[8:38] the one that you're prisoner to amen now
[8:41] God can fulfill his will through you
[8:43] when you are a prisoner to him
[8:47] amen listen to this he says about uh
[8:50] about Paul Paul called himself a
[8:53] prisoner in uh Ephesians 3 for this
[8:57] cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus
[8:59] Christ to you Gentiles amen listen to
[9:02] what he
[9:03] says amen he says God is looking see the
[9:06] love of God had been so tremendous a re
[9:09] Revelation to Paul that he could not get
[9:11] away from it that's the true experience
[9:13] of every True Believer who meets God you
[9:16] come in contact with something that's so
[9:18] great that you become a prisoner to
[9:21] everything else you get away from
[9:22] everything else and imprison yourself to
[9:25] this one thing I had mentioned that is
[9:27] that if you do become a prisoner and you
[9:29] do yield you do surrender Onin this it
[9:31] has to be your
[9:33] choice it has to be your choice to do so
[9:37] amen praise the Lord I'm just glad that
[9:40] you mean God helped you to make that
[9:41] right choice to become a prisoner
[9:43] because it has to be upon the basis of
[9:45] free moral agency of something that you
[9:47] want and desire and in any battle you
[9:49] have to choose hey this is I I want to
[9:51] surrender to this so he says now notice
[9:54] he says God is looking for prisoners
[9:55] he's always done it you might search
[9:57] through the scripture a man has to be a
[9:59] prisoner to Christ against anything else
[10:02] you cannot be connected with anything
[10:03] but Christ even your father your mother
[10:05] your brother sister you can't love
[10:07] anything else more than you love Christ
[10:09] you prisoner to it a it right even your
[10:11] father your brother husband wife he says
[10:13] he listen you're only and and you're
[10:15] only connected to Christ and him only
[10:18] then God can use you until then he can't
[10:21] amen Moses was an elected deliverer and
[10:24] finally God had elected his elected
[10:26] subject a prisoner to him Hallelujah he
[10:29] could only move is the word of God moved
[10:31] in him who shall I say sent me I am how
[10:35] will I do it I'll be with you how many
[10:38] believes that when you become a prisoner
[10:39] to Christ amen you just only do what the
[10:42] word tells you to do you follow it amen
[10:45] and how many's glad to be a prisoner
[10:47] because I'll tell you this how many
[10:48] knows another thing is is that uh Jesus
[10:52] says you can only you know nobody lives
[10:54] to himself no man dies to himself you're
[10:56] going to be a servant to somebody
[10:59] remember the guy with the sign in
[11:01] California with sign on his back he says
[11:04] on the front it was I'm a fool for
[11:05] Christ and on the back it said and who's
[11:07] fool are you you're going to serve
[11:09] you're going to serve somebody how many
[11:11] knows that you're not a
[11:14] God God don't serve nobody a't that
[11:18] right no and we're not Gods we're
[11:20] subjects we're servants and he says no
[11:24] man can serve two masters you're going
[11:25] to serve one or you going to serve the
[11:27] other you going to be a slave or a
[11:28] prisoner or to one or the other and how
[11:31] many knows anybody that's ever served
[11:32] the devil realizes he's a tough
[11:36] Taskmaster he'll make things look good
[11:38] he'll make it things oh my things great
[11:41] but he'll leave you empty and dry amen
[11:43] and spit your bones out so to speak amen
[11:46] and not care for you and just destroy
[11:48] you but praise be to God when you have
[11:50] become a prisoner to Christ then guess
[11:53] what he's responsible for clothing you
[11:56] he's responsible for feeding you he
[11:58] takes care of you he knows the fall of a
[12:01] sparrow he knows the number of your hair
[12:04] he fights all your battles for you he
[12:06] gives you Joy he gives you peace I don't
[12:09] know about you but I like being a
[12:10] prisoner to Christ Give the Lord a hand
[12:13] say thank you Lord

[34:48] like you're ready to worship and and
[34:51] defitely praising God tonight and and
[34:54] your hands of surrender as brother Bor
[34:56] said and that just goes right along with
[34:57] our thought tonight so uh we uh want to
[35:01] get right into the word if we could and
[35:03] and uh want to just share a little quote
[35:05] with you before we get into the
[35:07] scriptures tonight and uh just just
[35:10] listen to what the prophet's saying he's
[35:11] preaching in in 1959 here and in the in
[35:15] the message blind
[35:16] bardus and he says we tonight could hold
[35:19] on to God's representative like that now
[35:22] just just take that statement in in mind
[35:24] and think about that if you could tell
[35:27] the holy Spirit
[35:28] tonight as sure as you are the immortal
[35:31] spirit of God you give me a promise in
[35:34] the Bible of my healing and I'm going to
[35:37] hold on to it till I see something
[35:41] happen he said there would be Miracles
[35:43] taking place he says there would be
[35:45] Miracles taking place the lame would be
[35:48] jumping and running and doctors all over
[35:50] Los Angeles would be surprised tomorrow
[35:52] to see their patience healed and well he
[35:55] we could just hold on uh take a hold of
[35:58] God's agent God's agent today is the
[36:01] Holy Spirit and hold on to it he said
[36:04] and whenever you come in contact and you
[36:06] feel the Holy Spirit on you then hold on
[36:09] to it and say I'll not leave
[36:12] you stay with it like Jacob did when he
[36:16] wrestled with the angel I'm going to
[36:18] hold on till you bless me and give me
[36:22] the things that I'm
[36:25] Desiring think about that
[36:28] think about that direct statement I'm
[36:29] going to hold on to you until you bless
[36:32] me and give me the things that I'm
[36:34] Desiring he said wouldn't it be
[36:36] wonderful a Revival to break out he said
[36:39] all up and down the coast here people
[36:41] right here tonight those that are
[36:42] listening on the air if they would take
[36:44] that attitude towards the Holy Spirit
[36:46] tonight now a lot of times we try to
[36:49] approach the Holy Spirit I feel like a
[36:51] and we're asking and and and we're calm
[36:55] and and we're we're uh more like at the
[36:58] feet of the of of the table you know
[37:00] what I'm saying we're kind of like can
[37:01] you please pass the bread or can you can
[37:03] you please pass the
[37:05] potatoes but he says if we could just
[37:07] take the attitude of this to the Holy
[37:09] Spirit and say I'm going to stay with
[37:11] you until I find out the thing that I
[37:13] want to
[37:15] know yes wow that's a that's a quite a
[37:19] direct statement and I believe so many
[37:21] times as Believers we have promise after
[37:24] promise we we know God's A Healer we
[37:27] know God a deliverer we know he's a
[37:29] savior we know he's he's all these
[37:31] things and all the attributes that God
[37:33] is we know these things but we fail to
[37:35] Simply attain it because we simply fail
[37:38] to hold on to
[37:42] it oh God I know you're a Healer I'm
[37:46] sick and then we let it
[37:49] go oh God I I I I know I need
[37:51] deliverance from this problem or this
[37:53] habit or this this this affliction
[37:57] I know you're the I know you're the
[37:58] person to do it but then we let it go
[38:02] that's right so I want to speak to you
[38:04] tonight on wrestling for your promises
[38:07] turn with me in the Book of Genesis if
[38:09] you would and we're going to try not to
[38:11] hold you too long tonight so uh brother
[38:13] Bor gave quite an exhortation and and it
[38:16] kind of got me fired up I think he's
[38:18] fired up he's had a little break and
[38:20] he's he's ready to go I just thought
[38:21] about handing him my notes and say
[38:24] go but uh we we certainly appreciate the
[38:28] Holy Spirit Genesis 25: 20 and 26
[38:32] through
[38:33] 26 and Isaac was 40 years old when he
[38:36] took Rebecca to wife the daughter of
[38:38] bethuel the
[38:41] Syrian the sister to Laban the Syrian
[38:44] and Isaac entreated the Lord for his
[38:46] wife because she was Barren and the Lord
[38:49] was entreated of him and Rebecca his
[38:52] wife conceived now watch now and the
[38:54] children struggled together within her
[38:57] and she said if it be so why am I thus
[39:01] and she went to inquire of the Lord and
[39:03] the Lord said unto her two nations are
[39:05] in thy womb and two manner of people
[39:08] shall be separated from thy bowels the
[39:11] one shall be stronger than the other
[39:13] people and the Elder Shall Serve the
[39:16] younger and when her days to be
[39:18] delivered were fulfilled behold there
[39:20] were twins in her womb and the first one
[39:24] came out red all over like a hairy
[39:26] garment and they called his name Esau
[39:30] and after that came his brother out and
[39:32] his hand took hold on Esau's heel and
[39:36] his name was called Jacob now we know
[39:39] the word the name Jacob the prophet
[39:41] tells us over and over in many of his
[39:42] messages means Sur planter and what that
[39:45] means is somebody or something is taking
[39:48] the place of another through Force
[39:50] Through scheming through deceit through
[39:52] strategy or some of the like like that
[39:55] so here we've got Jacob here the surlan
[39:58] now go with me to Genesis
[40:00] 32
[40:07] 24-30 and Jacob was left
[40:10] alone sometimes that's a place we need
[40:12] to get
[40:14] to Jacob was left alone and there
[40:18] Wrestled a man with him until the
[40:19] breaking of day and when he saw that he
[40:22] prevailed not against him he touched the
[40:25] Hallow of his thigh and the Hallow of
[40:28] Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he
[40:30] wrestled with him and he said let me go
[40:33] for the day breth and he said I will not
[40:35] let thee
[40:37] go except thou bless me and he said unto
[40:41] him what is thy name and he said Jacob
[40:45] and he said thy name shall be called No
[40:47] More Jacob but Israel for as a prince
[40:51] hasth thou power with God and with men
[40:53] and Hast prevailed and Jacob asked him
[40:56] and said tell me I pray thy name and he
[40:58] said wherefore is it that thou doest ask
[41:01] after my name and he blessed him there
[41:04] and Jacob called the name of the place
[41:06] pel for I have seen God face to face and
[41:10] my life is preserved you can have your
[41:13] seats may the Lord add his Blessing to
[41:15] the reading of the words tonight so I I
[41:18] want you to notice here and I want you
[41:19] to look and and notice here that that
[41:22] God asked Jacob in verse 27 what is your
[41:25] name now was this because because God uh
[41:29] didn't didn't know who Jacob was is this
[41:33] because he didn't know who he was
[41:34] wrestling with or he was confused or had
[41:36] forgotten where he was at in time and
[41:38] and he's just got a hold to this guy and
[41:40] he's thinking man what am I doing here
[41:41] who is this no he didn't ask him that
[41:43] for that reason he asked him what his
[41:45] name was because he wanted he wanted
[41:48] Jacob to describe and openly admit who
[41:51] he was and so Jacob by looking at God in
[41:54] the face to face and say my name is
[41:57] Jacob he was telling God exactly who he
[42:00] was I'm a deceiver I'm a liar I'm a
[42:03] surlan he's recognizing who he is in the
[42:07] face of God and brothers and sisters we
[42:09] a lot of times need to get to a place
[42:11] where we look at God and we tell God
[42:13] exactly who we are I'm a fa you know
[42:16] many times we hear we're bride we're
[42:18] bride we're bride and we love to hear
[42:20] we're bride right amen but there's a job
[42:23] for the bride to do there's a job for
[42:26] the bride do there is an attitude that
[42:28] the bride has to have and that is an
[42:30] attitude of submission to God it's an
[42:33] attitude that that I'm weak and he is
[42:36] strong it's that kind of an attitude so
[42:39] God is having Jacob describe who he was
[42:42] and we listen to the prophet describe
[42:43] him and and it kind of sets us back to
[42:45] think that the prophet of the hour would
[42:47] describe a man as this but listen to
[42:50] what he says he says let me explain this
[42:52] example to you he said we want to keep
[42:54] the keep it in the scriptures while
[42:56] we're on these two spirits
[42:57] he said Esau was far better man in every
[43:00] way that you wanted to take than Jacob
[43:03] was he said now Jacob he said God
[43:06] forgive me for my
[43:08] remarks so he's fixing up he's fixing to
[43:11] put the rubber on the road right here
[43:14] God forgive me for my remarks he says he
[43:17] was a little sneaker he said I want you
[43:20] to notice how he was he was a little
[43:22] tattletail he was a big liar he said if
[43:26] I'm saying something wrong wrong God
[43:27] forgive me but he lied and he is a cheat
[43:31] and there never was one hardly like
[43:34] him he said he took them speckled sticks
[43:37] you know the story you you you know the
[43:39] Bible he said he took those speckled
[43:40] sticks and he put them in the water and
[43:42] he callused the the pregnated cattle and
[43:44] the Sheep to bring forth speckled sheep
[43:45] speckled cows so that he could take them
[43:47] into his own instead of giving them to
[43:49] his father-in-law he said he did that he
[43:51] said he even impersonated his brother by
[43:54] putting on his brother's coat over some
[43:56] over some wool
[43:57] and and went before his blind prophet
[44:00] father and lied and said I'm Esau he
[44:03] said why he was a little Shyer he really
[44:06] was he said you think in your mind that
[44:09] he was a great man of God and I don't
[44:11] want to say something bad about him you
[44:14] see he said but I'm just trying to point
[44:16] out a little little things that he did
[44:18] just look how sneaky he was a liar sure
[44:22] he was he was terrible
[44:29] woo poor
[44:32] Jacob poor Jacob brothers and sisters
[44:35] that that's what the prophet had to say
[44:37] say about Jacob in the Bible we're
[44:39] talking about Jacob who come from a
[44:40] Royal bloodline Abraham was his
[44:43] grandfather he has come from a Royal
[44:45] bloodline he'd been around the message
[44:47] his entire life he knew the message
[44:50] frontwards and backwards he knew all the
[44:52] lineages he knew all the tablets he knew
[44:54] everything that it could be and here he
[44:56] stands in the Prophet says this man is a
[44:58] liar he was
[45:01] terrible so if he says that about him
[45:04] what does he say about you and I oh do
[45:07] we want to hear this ah we
[45:10] cringe he said except a man be born
[45:14] again he gives us that except a man be
[45:18] born again he said why must he be born
[45:20] again he's dead with with the flesh he's
[45:23] in he's a hybrid he's got to be born
[45:25] again because he was born in sin he was
[45:27] in Eve sin shaped in iniquity coming in
[45:30] the world speaking lies he's a liar to
[45:32] begin
[45:33] with he's talking about us before a
[45:39] conversion the Bible says he is it don't
[45:42] matter how holy his parents was or
[45:44] anything about it he's a liar to begin
[45:46] with the only way we can tell the truth
[45:49] is to say what truth is through his own
[45:51] lips the only way the truth can come
[45:53] anything contrary to that word he's a
[45:55] liar he says now that's pretty flat but
[45:58] that's what God Said let every man's
[46:01] word be a lie and mine be true he said
[46:03] see he's got to be born again he's got
[46:05] to have every word the only way he can
[46:07] be born again is that life of God in him
[46:10] to produce that
[46:13] life it takes the life of God on the
[46:15] inside of us it takes a a face-to-face
[46:19] conversation with god and letting God
[46:21] have control of Our Lives before God can
[46:23] work through us and in us and be able to
[46:26] call ourselves bride of Jesus
[46:30] Christ we're going to spend some time on
[46:32] Jacob tonight and Jacob's life was not
[46:36] not an easy life we might say and but a
[46:38] lot of the problems he went through he
[46:40] brought up on
[46:41] himself I don't know about you but I've
[46:43] brought some problems upon
[46:45] myself and so Jacob has brought some
[46:48] problems upon himself but this very
[46:50] started at the very beginning when he
[46:52] was conceived uh by Rebecca after she
[46:55] became the wife of Isaac
[46:57] and so right there we see in the very
[46:59] womb we see this wrestling match begin
[47:02] to take on and Rebecca's now having a
[47:05] rough time this pregnancy has not been
[47:07] what what we would call the perfect
[47:08] pregnancy because the No Doubt from what
[47:10] the scriptures say her stomach was in a
[47:12] rumble there was a war going on a fight
[47:14] inside of her and Rebecca goes before
[47:17] God and she says I want to know the
[47:19] reason that there's a struggle going on
[47:22] inside of me what is going on and God
[47:25] speaks back to her and says you are
[47:26] having twins and they're struggling for
[47:29] dominance over one
[47:32] another and in time these two nations
[47:36] with very different
[47:38] personalities one of them is going to be
[47:40] stronger than the
[47:42] other and the older is going to serve
[47:46] the
[47:49] younger what does this put through her
[47:52] mind now what does she begin to think
[47:55] what does she begin to think when all
[47:56] this this is going on and and God just
[47:58] told her that your your second born is
[48:01] going to be the the ruler and the leader
[48:03] over your first
[48:04] born brothers and sisters I want you to
[48:06] notice even at the moment of birth when
[48:08] Jacob reached out and he grabbed a hold
[48:11] of Esau's
[48:12] foot he grabbed a hold of him as to
[48:15] during the delivery as to say you're not
[48:17] you might get a hold of me you might be
[48:20] first you might be the first but I'm
[48:22] going to grab a hold of you and I will
[48:24] let you know I'm on your tail
[48:27] right there from the very beginning he
[48:29] grabbed a hold of that that heel he
[48:31] grabbed a hold of a
[48:34] lifestyle from birth he grabbed a hold
[48:37] of a lifestyle of lies and mischief and
[48:40] deceit and cunning
[48:42] trickery and Jacob's personality of a
[48:45] deceiver and a conniving mind was
[48:48] developing as he drew his very first
[48:51] breath a newborn
[48:54] child and he's given the name
[48:57] Jacob now Esau we look at Esau poor Esau
[49:00] and Man Poor Esau born full of red
[49:05] hair must have looked like an
[49:07] animal that's what the Bible says right
[49:10] when he was born said he had look like
[49:11] he had a fur coat on poor
[49:16] thing they even nicknamed him
[49:19] red did you know that they called him
[49:22] Edom which means red so they nicknamed
[49:25] him like we would hey red
[49:27] so here is Esau now and and and things
[49:29] are starting out in a kind of a bad way
[49:31] for these but these twins they grow up
[49:33] now and these opposite personalities
[49:36] begin to pronounce themselves and the
[49:39] competition between one and the other
[49:41] begins to get greater and greater and
[49:43] greater the competition to gain the
[49:45] respect the competition to gain the love
[49:49] and the Adoration of their parents is is
[49:51] now growing all the time in them one
[49:53] wants the all the love and respect from
[49:55] this parent one wants all the love from
[49:57] this parent and here is Esau now Esau's
[50:00] living up to uh he's he's living up in a
[50:03] nature type he's a hunter he he he's a
[50:06] hunter and he's a man of the field and
[50:07] he loves camping and sleeping under the
[50:09] stars and fishing and hunting and
[50:12] outdoor activities and Isaac loved Esau
[50:15] because he was a man's
[50:18] man he was an excellent shot with a
[50:21] bow Isaac loved it when he would go
[50:24] hunting cuz he would bring home all the
[50:25] good venison to him
[50:28] and he would have great meals because
[50:29] Esau would provide with his bow the
[50:32] hunter but now here's Jacob on the flip
[50:36] side now here's Jacob the opposite of of
[50:39] Esau a
[50:41] homebody he wants to stay inside the
[50:44] tent he wants to stay out of the sun he
[50:47] wants to hang around Rebecca's skirt
[50:50] tail mama's boy he learned how to cook
[50:54] and how to clean the tent he won the
[50:56] heart of his Mama because she just
[50:58] spoiled him little mama's
[51:00] boy and so here is Jacob now always
[51:03] going there he's trying to stay inside
[51:05] Esau's out hunting Jacob's at home
[51:07] cooking
[51:09] stew think about it he's stewing on ways
[51:12] he can cheat his
[51:15] brother and he's stewing on these things
[51:18] how can I get my brother how can I get
[51:20] better than him how can I gain more more
[51:22] more than he's got and so Jacob's mind
[51:24] was constantly trying to figure out how
[51:26] can I cheat somebody and manipulate them
[51:29] and manipulate them to where I can have
[51:31] them do exactly what I want them to
[51:33] do you see sooner or later it was almost
[51:37] inevitable that these two brothers with
[51:38] different personalities are going to
[51:40] clash and they're going to clash in a
[51:42] manner that's going to bring division to
[51:44] the
[51:45] family and the parents no doubt begin to
[51:49] show obvious preferential
[51:52] treatment read the Bible
[51:56] as parents we shouldn't do
[51:58] that as parents it causes
[52:01] Division and we see it in the Bible here
[52:04] that Isaac loved Esau more and Rebecca
[52:07] loved uh Jacob more and they began to
[52:10] put their lines between the two and it
[52:12] started be causing a
[52:14] division and here Jacob is
[52:17] now we look here and we see what is
[52:20] happening here he begins to wrestle in
[52:22] his
[52:23] head and he begins to sneak around and
[52:26] connect KN and he says I've got to
[52:28] figure out a way to steal my brother's
[52:32] Birthright I got to figure out a way how
[52:35] I can become the one who owns that
[52:38] Birthright and it all started out with a
[52:41] pot of
[52:43] stew think about how simple this is it
[52:47] all started out with a pot of stew it
[52:48] started out when Jacob was at home and
[52:51] he's making stew and he's cooking and he
[52:53] knows that Esau's soon going to return
[52:55] from his hunting trip
[52:57] and so Esau comes in and Esau sits down
[52:59] there and he says Jacob feed
[53:02] me please feed me I'm hungry can't you
[53:05] see I'm famished I I'm going to
[53:07] die I'm I'm about to faint and Jacob
[53:10] says oh are you
[53:12] hungry are you hungry you look a little
[53:16] famished you look like you might be on
[53:18] your last last leg are you feeling okay
[53:21] no I'm not feeling okay I told you I'm
[53:23] I'm hungry I'm going to die please feed
[53:25] me something
[53:27] how much does that Birthright mean to
[53:30] you come on Jacob can you imagine this
[53:34] conversation come on Jacob give me
[53:36] something to eat I I I will but how much
[53:38] does that Birthright mean to
[53:41] you that's
[53:43] right but it don't mean nothing to me if
[53:46] I'm dead well sell it to me for this
[53:48] bowl of pottage for this bowl of
[53:51] Stew think about
[53:53] this and so Esau gives up his birth
[53:57] right and sells out his birth right
[53:59] because he feels he's at the point of
[54:01] death and what profit is it going to be
[54:03] for him so he gives it up and now Jacob
[54:06] says swear to
[54:08] me swear to me swear to me that this is
[54:12] mine from now on it's yours you can have
[54:15] it just feed
[54:19] me so Jacob gives Esau bread and pottage
[54:23] of lindal and he ate he drank and he
[54:26] rosed up and after he got his belly full
[54:30] it said Esau despised his
[54:33] Birthright can you think about that what
[54:36] was this Birthright what was the
[54:38] importance of this Birthright this
[54:39] Birthright that was sold for a bowl of
[54:41] Stew this Birthright was his natural
[54:44] privilege to the firstborn son to become
[54:46] the head of the family to have all of
[54:49] the responsibility of the family to have
[54:51] the authority in the family to be the
[54:53] head of the family to be the most
[54:55] powerful sibling in the
[54:59] family and to own all of the family
[55:06] property this person would be
[55:08] responsible for his younger Sons the
[55:11] widows the unmarried daughters all of
[55:14] the kids the
[55:17] grandkids that would still be around
[55:19] after Isaac died not only that but he
[55:22] would this person would be entitled to a
[55:24] blessing from God
[55:27] now back in those days a blessing of God
[55:30] God would deal with the head of the
[55:31] family above and so the blessings went
[55:33] down into the head of the family the
[55:35] oldest the firstborn those with the B
[55:37] the
[55:39] birthright so now Esau has given this up
[55:42] do you think maybe Esau thought man
[55:44] Jacob was only joking with
[55:46] me maybe he thought Jacob was only
[55:48] joking with me but Jacob wouldn't surely
[55:50] force me to to keep this into the
[55:52] bargain he knows I'm the oldest he knows
[55:54] I'm the birthright he knows I'm going to
[55:56] get the
[55:59] blessing but boy was he
[56:03] wrong his name alone santer the deceiver
[56:06] the
[56:08] conniver he got
[56:11] him he got him had him right where he
[56:14] wanted he had planned this out all along
[56:16] and he knew he was going to steal Esau's
[56:18] right to the authority of the family and
[56:20] take it for himself
[56:27] you think about it and you think poor
[56:29] Esau he really it it don't look like he
[56:32] cared it don't look like he cared
[56:34] because all he wanted was his stomach
[56:36] full all he wanted was that's all that
[56:38] mattered was right at that moment that's
[56:40] what happened he couldn't wait and and
[56:43] and see what would happen he had to take
[56:44] care of it right now how careless and
[56:47] foolish was
[56:48] Esau think about it how careless and
[56:51] foolish was he to sell out the blessings
[56:53] of God but people do it every day
[56:58] believers do it every
[57:00] day they sell out the blessings of God
[57:03] for the things of this
[57:06] world there's people sitting at home
[57:08] tonight watching
[57:12] television they're not streaming this
[57:15] service they're watching tevision
[57:27] where's their
[57:28] Birthright how much do they care they're
[57:32] happy Esau was happy with a full
[57:36] belly but boy didn't life get
[57:39] rough didn't life get rough because now
[57:43] Jacob has this Birthright but this
[57:45] wrestling match with Esau wasn't over
[57:48] because now Rebecca helps him to fool
[57:51] Isaac into stealing from Esau once again
[57:54] and and being a little mama's boy paying
[57:56] off for
[57:58] Jacob being a little mama's boy is
[58:00] paying off and and Esau is being
[58:03] blindsided by his conniving lying
[58:05] brother and
[58:08] mother you say man you preaching hard on
[58:11] them
[58:12] Patriarchs hey they live they put their
[58:14] pants on just like we
[58:16] do that's how we learn that's how we
[58:19] don't make the same
[58:23] mistakes Genesis chapter 27
[58:27] the story is told how Jacob being
[58:29] disguised by Rebecca to fool her blind
[58:31] husband places animal skins on his arms
[58:33] and on his neck and and causes Isaac to
[58:36] pass the blessing of the firstborn onto
[58:38] Jacob instead of
[58:40] Esau so now Jacob has the birth
[58:45] right and the blessing of his
[58:49] father the two most important things
[58:52] that a firstborn could
[58:54] have you see how you see what it meant
[58:56] when he come out of that womb and he
[58:58] grabbed a hold he grabbed a hold of a
[59:01] lifestyle he grabbed a hold of a way of
[59:03] living and a way of life that he would
[59:05] grab a hold of whatever he needed to get
[59:08] him wherever he wanted to
[59:09] be and there's people around the world
[59:12] doing
[59:13] that they set Church
[59:15] aside to grab a hold of the things of
[59:18] this
[59:23] world so it appears
[59:27] he's got the birth right he's got the
[59:28] blessing so now it appears that he's in
[59:30] control of his life I mean he's got it
[59:34] all he's got all that you could ask for
[59:37] he's got power he's got Authority he's
[59:39] got land he's got
[59:41] Prestige and brothers and sisters we
[59:43] have to be careful that we don't fool
[59:44] ourselves to think that
[59:47] possessions mean that we are living
[59:49] where we need to
[59:52] live hey I see a lot of politicians
[59:56] like to eat ice
[59:58] cream you know what I'm talking
[1:00:04] about has made millions and millions and
[1:00:07] millions and has gained lands and lands
[1:00:10] and properties and
[1:00:13] properties and I'm not just picking on
[1:00:15] Uncle
[1:00:18] Joe but it's it's
[1:00:24] politicians it's church members
[1:00:31] yep it's pastors it's
[1:00:37] evangelist we got to get to the flip
[1:00:39] side of this thing before we get going
[1:00:41] too deep
[1:00:44] here but don't fool
[1:00:47] ourselves so now we get to a
[1:00:50] place that Esau says I have had
[1:00:53] enough of Jacob
[1:00:56] and it says under his breath he saysi
[1:00:59] hate
[1:01:01] Jacob in my heart I hate
[1:01:04] him he's lied to me he's deceived me I'm
[1:01:09] his brother he has taken two things that
[1:01:11] are absolutely mine I will slay my
[1:01:17] brother now you see how this division is
[1:01:21] taking us down two
[1:01:24] roads Rebecca finds find out and she
[1:01:26] goes to Jacob and says Jacob you got to
[1:01:28] run for your life you got to run for
[1:01:31] your life after all the deceiving and
[1:01:34] the manipulating that you've done you're
[1:01:36] not a
[1:01:37] fighter you can lie you can Swindle you
[1:01:40] can cheat but you can't
[1:01:43] survive your brother Esau he is a dead
[1:01:46] shot with a bow and arrow he hunts he
[1:01:48] can shoot a squirrel at a 100
[1:01:53] yards he won't miss you
[1:01:56] you got to run so Jacob leaves the scene
[1:02:00] and Esau goes on the hunt after
[1:02:02] him you see I told you that you would
[1:02:04] pay a price for taking precedence of one
[1:02:07] child over the other now Rebecca stands
[1:02:09] here with no
[1:02:13] children no children of her own her
[1:02:16] husband is now soon to be
[1:02:18] dead and she stands here all alone
[1:02:22] causing the division of her sons all
[1:02:25] because she wanted what she thought was
[1:02:27] best for
[1:02:32] one what we sow we shall also
[1:02:36] reap so here's Rebecca now she's
[1:02:38] beginning to look and she's beginning to
[1:02:40] see that the seeds that she
[1:02:42] sowed are not going to be a good outcome
[1:02:44] for her children if things don't
[1:02:47] change no doubt she can look and say
[1:02:49] what have I done what have I put my
[1:02:52] children through what am I doing why did
[1:02:55] I do all this now they're gone and one's
[1:02:57] going to kill the other or the other's
[1:02:58] going to kill this one they've stolen
[1:03:00] from each other they've lied to each
[1:03:02] other they hate each
[1:03:05] other and this wrestling match is
[1:03:07] beginning between Jacob and Esau it's
[1:03:09] escalated into a fight to death listen
[1:03:13] now this goes on for 20
[1:03:17] years 20 years this division is taking
[1:03:20] place between Jacob and
[1:03:22] Esau though they go their separate ways
[1:03:24] now Jacob can you imagine Jacob always
[1:03:27] looking over his
[1:03:29] shoulder now that don't sound like a
[1:03:31] born again Holy Ghost filled Christian
[1:03:33] to
[1:03:34] me if I got to walk my daily walk
[1:03:37] wondering if somebody's about to kill me
[1:03:40] shoot me in the back cut my
[1:03:43] throat I'm not living exactly where I
[1:03:45] need to
[1:03:47] live and so here's Jacob for 20
[1:03:52] years for 20 years this is going on and
[1:03:57] for 20 years Esau and Jacob watch this
[1:04:01] they are
[1:04:05] prospering think about this this is two
[1:04:09] two people that's that's Waring at one
[1:04:11] another God's
[1:04:14] people living lives that you can't
[1:04:17] imagine one with a murderous Spirit one
[1:04:20] with a deceiving Ling spirit and they're
[1:04:24] prospering
[1:04:26] let me tell you this you see Satan he
[1:04:28] don't care that you
[1:04:30] prosper Satan don't care that you
[1:04:32] prosper he don't care that you make
[1:04:34] money he don't care that you're in
[1:04:36] church he don't care that you sing in
[1:04:38] the choir he don't care that your kids
[1:04:40] go to Sunday
[1:04:42] school he don't care about any of that
[1:04:45] no he don't care as long as there's
[1:04:48] division as long as there's wrath as
[1:04:50] long as there's
[1:04:52] hatred as long as that's the life you're
[1:04:54] living as long as long as the as long as
[1:04:56] they was living below their promises and
[1:04:58] their god-given
[1:05:01] privileges he don't care you see that's
[1:05:04] why I say it's not enough just to be
[1:05:07] saved that's where people
[1:05:10] stop they get saved and they stop right
[1:05:14] there and they may Prosper they may go
[1:05:17] to church their kids may sing all these
[1:05:21] things happen but are they getting all
[1:05:23] the promises that God has offered them
[1:05:26] because what good is it to be saved
[1:05:28] don't take this the wrong way we all
[1:05:29] need to be saved if you're not saved
[1:05:31] let's get to the
[1:05:32] altar but what good is it to be to to be
[1:05:35] a child and never an heir of
[1:05:38] anything that's
[1:05:40] right and so here for 20 years revenge
[1:05:43] is ruling the heart of Esau for 20 years
[1:05:46] fear and dread ruled the life of Jacob
[1:05:49] and he's Forever on the run from a
[1:05:51] brother who vowed to kill him what good
[1:05:54] did stealing the birthright do him at
[1:05:56] this
[1:05:57] point what good does it do to own the
[1:06:00] birthright and you can't even go out to
[1:06:02] celebrate
[1:06:03] it you're living a life hiding and
[1:06:07] struggling just to stay
[1:06:11] alive until the day when Jacob's heart
[1:06:14] begin to
[1:06:16] change Jacob's heart begin to change and
[1:06:18] he thought to himself you know I've been
[1:06:23] wrong you know it's something about when
[1:06:25] you're a child God you may run for a
[1:06:27] long time you may tell a lot of lies you
[1:06:32] may deceive a lot of
[1:06:34] people you may you may do some
[1:06:37] horrendous things in your life but when
[1:06:39] God begins to speak to the heart and
[1:06:41] Pricks the heart of that child of God
[1:06:44] and he began to prick the heart of Jacob
[1:06:46] and Jacob said I'm wrong I've done my
[1:06:49] family wrong I've done my brother wrong
[1:06:51] I've done all these people wrong I've
[1:06:53] stolen I'm a liive before God I need to
[1:06:58] make
[1:07:00] peace but he didn't know
[1:07:03] how and he's afraid if he goes to try to
[1:07:06] see Esau that to make things right that
[1:07:09] Esau is going to cut his
[1:07:12] throat and so he sends out people to
[1:07:14] fill it out he sends out his servants to
[1:07:17] fill it out and see what's going on and
[1:07:20] as they go and they come back and The
[1:07:22] Messengers return to him and they say we
[1:07:24] saw you brother Esau and he's coming to
[1:07:26] meet you oh that's nice with 400 of his
[1:07:32] men oh
[1:07:35] Lord Oh
[1:07:39] Lord what can I do and he begins to get
[1:07:43] distressed and Afraid and and he he
[1:07:45] begins to think what can I do so he says
[1:07:47] take half of my flocks and half of my
[1:07:50] family and go this way take the other
[1:07:52] half of my flocks and my family and go
[1:07:54] this way surely of goodness his people
[1:07:56] can't catch us
[1:07:59] all and while we're doing that I'm going
[1:08:01] to set aside 200 she
[1:08:03] goats 20 he goats 200 's 20 Rams 30
[1:08:08] camels with coats 40 kind that's
[1:08:12] cows 10 Bulls 20 she asses and Foos and
[1:08:17] when he comes and he sees all this I'm
[1:08:19] going to say my
[1:08:22] Lord this is
[1:08:24] yours I I've been saving this for
[1:08:29] you whose is this Jacob it's yours Esau
[1:08:32] that's what I've been doing I've been
[1:08:34] Mak I've been I've been I've been
[1:08:35] planting all this stuff I've been been
[1:08:38] having these these animals and and
[1:08:40] reproducing and it's all I was doing it
[1:08:42] all for
[1:08:43] you now Esau's
[1:08:46] Revenge he knew he was still coming to
[1:08:48] kill him and he's divided now the two
[1:08:52] directions a a and and he sends him
[1:08:55] and he sends these people away and now
[1:08:58] here he stands
[1:09:00] alone and the Bible says he stood there
[1:09:02] alone you see when your life is on the
[1:09:05] line you begin to look at things a
[1:09:08] little
[1:09:10] different you know you're really
[1:09:12] sometimes young people they don't think
[1:09:14] about God until some tragic accident
[1:09:17] happens then all of a sudden God is the
[1:09:19] first and
[1:09:21] foremost and now Jacob stands here and
[1:09:24] he's looking at this and he says I'm all
[1:09:26] alone what am I going to do and the
[1:09:29] Bible tells us that he begins to cry out
[1:09:32] he begins to pray and he begins to cry
[1:09:34] out but I'm going to tell you this is
[1:09:36] where his real wrestling match
[1:09:39] started because now here he is it's not
[1:09:42] a fight with Esau now that's on the
[1:09:45] that's on the back burner now this is a
[1:09:47] this is a fight between himself and
[1:09:49] almighty God because you see Jacob
[1:09:52] realized something has got to change in
[1:09:54] me something has got to change in me I
[1:09:57] can't stand myself the way I am
[1:10:01] anymore sometimes we got to get to a
[1:10:03] place it would say I can't stand myself
[1:10:05] no matter how good things are I can't
[1:10:08] stand
[1:10:11] myself you say who are you talking to if
[1:10:13] I'm not talking to you I'm talking to
[1:10:16] myself because when Brad Powell gets in
[1:10:18] the
[1:10:19] way I can't stand myself
[1:10:28] and he's looking at this and he says I'm
[1:10:31] tired of living a life on the run I'm
[1:10:34] tired of living a
[1:10:36] life and on the run and and I want God
[1:10:39] to be in my life I want the blessings of
[1:10:42] God the way I should be getting the
[1:10:45] blessings of
[1:10:49] God Jacob needed
[1:10:51] Deliverance Jacob needed deliverance and
[1:10:54] the Bible tells us that he's alone and
[1:10:55] he's he's emptying out and he's he's
[1:10:57] crying and he and he's right there in
[1:10:59] prayer and all of a sudden a man
[1:11:02] approaches
[1:11:03] him and this man not only approaches him
[1:11:06] it doesn't say he said anything it just
[1:11:07] says that all of a sudden they become
[1:11:10] entangled in a wrestling
[1:11:13] match and so now this man that Jacob is
[1:11:16] wrestling with this was not
[1:11:20] Esau it wasn't himself who was this man
[1:11:24] that grabbed a hold of Jacob
[1:11:26] it was none other than God
[1:11:28] Almighty now God has a h of Jacob and
[1:11:32] they're fighting one after another hour
[1:11:35] after hour after hour hands locked
[1:11:38] together can you
[1:11:41] imagine we've all done it we've all
[1:11:43] played Uncle right Mercy uncle whatever
[1:11:46] you call
[1:11:48] it I was pretty good at it when my kids
[1:11:50] were about
[1:11:53] 12 but I I don't try it
[1:11:56] anymore these arthritic fingers can't
[1:11:58] handle
[1:12:00] it but can you imagine being locked
[1:12:03] together with all of your
[1:12:06] strength battling back and forward and
[1:12:09] and God is looking at him and no doubt
[1:12:11] God begins to push the pressure down on
[1:12:14] Jacob can you imagine as he begins to
[1:12:17] push the pressure down on Jacob and say
[1:12:19] get this out of your
[1:12:21] life get the doubt out of your life get
[1:12:24] the reception out of your life get the
[1:12:27] world out of your
[1:12:30] life and now Jacob is pinned down from
[1:12:33] this position and he's looking up into
[1:12:35] the eyes of God
[1:12:36] Almighty and now Jacob is looking up and
[1:12:39] he begins to think okay I'll get that
[1:12:41] out of my life and he begins to press
[1:12:43] and he begins to press and he begins to
[1:12:46] press and he said but I want to be
[1:12:48] blessed I want you to bless me I want
[1:12:51] the blessings of healing I want the
[1:12:53] blessings of Deliverance I want the
[1:12:55] blessings of love and the blessings of
[1:12:57] joy and the blessings of my
[1:13:00] family I want all these
[1:13:03] blessings but get hatred out of your
[1:13:07] life and this battle's going back and
[1:13:10] forth and back and forth for hours and
[1:13:12] hours you see Jacob in order for him to
[1:13:15] get deliverance from lying and cheating
[1:13:16] deceiving conniving he had to get to a
[1:13:19] place where God could deal with him one
[1:13:21] onone hand in
[1:13:23] hand brothers and sisters we need to get
[1:13:25] to a place where we can get where God
[1:13:27] can get with us and deal with us one
[1:13:29] onone hand in hand if we want the
[1:13:32] blessings of
[1:13:35] God we have to be willing to submit to
[1:13:41] God I don't know where people get the
[1:13:43] idea that you can have blessings just by
[1:13:45] calling yourself a
[1:13:47] Christian there's sacrifices that's
[1:13:52] made you see that's the way God still
[1:13:55] deals with us today we're here in a
[1:13:57] Congregation of what 50 people I don't
[1:14:00] know and we're here in this congregation
[1:14:02] but the spirit of God begins to deal
[1:14:04] with us individually one to one each one
[1:14:06] of you know that God is speaking to you
[1:14:08] in a different
[1:14:10] way and I can tell I can look the pastor
[1:14:13] can look and see who God is dealing
[1:14:15] with and he's dealing with each one of
[1:14:17] us in a different way and a different
[1:14:19] time now he's speaking across the whole
[1:14:21] congregation but your need
[1:14:27] your grasp that you grabbed the heel
[1:14:29] that you grabbed a hold
[1:14:31] of are you with me the heel that you
[1:14:34] grabbed a hold of is different than the
[1:14:36] heel I grabbed a hold of now I could
[1:14:39] tell every one of you and confess what
[1:14:40] bothers me and you could confess to me
[1:14:43] what bothers you but those confessions
[1:14:46] will do nobody any good it's only when
[1:14:49] we come face to face and confess to God
[1:14:52] that's when we get somewhere with God
[1:14:54] that's that's when God can been to pour
[1:14:56] out Deliverance onto your life that's
[1:14:59] how Jacob got Deliverance it wasn't when
[1:15:01] he was with the group of people it
[1:15:03] wasn't when he was with the family but
[1:15:06] it was when he separated himself and
[1:15:07] said God I need
[1:15:13] you so there's a wrestling match taking
[1:15:15] place right now in our hearts in your
[1:15:18] heart my heart there's no doubt
[1:15:21] something that you've got in your mind
[1:15:22] right now that God is dealing with you
[1:15:24] with
[1:15:25] he's dealing with you about that and so
[1:15:27] right now the Holy Ghost is locked in on
[1:15:31] us aren't you thankful he cares that
[1:15:33] much to visit us I tell you I was back
[1:15:36] there in the study and I had no idea how
[1:15:38] this was going to go this wasn't what I
[1:15:40] had intended to preach up until about
[1:15:42] four hours ago but I was sitting back
[1:15:45] there and it just felt different I was
[1:15:47] sitting back there I sat in a different
[1:15:49] place and all of a sudden I was praying
[1:15:51] and I could feel that anointing the
[1:15:53] spirit Holy Spirit coming out and the
[1:15:54] peace
[1:15:55] that that come upon me and I thought
[1:15:58] Lord I don't know what you're doing
[1:16:00] tonight but this is going to be a
[1:16:02] special kind of
[1:16:03] night because Deliverance is in the
[1:16:06] building surrender is in the building
[1:16:10] freedom is in the building we don't have
[1:16:12] to wrestle ourselves anymore just get
[1:16:15] before God and let God do the
[1:16:23] work you see Jacob's heart wasn't easy
[1:16:25] to change there was a struggle there
[1:16:28] within and without this wrestling match
[1:16:30] wasn't about pinning somebody down to
[1:16:32] the ground for the count of
[1:16:33] three no this was more of a spiritual an
[1:16:36] emotional wrestling match and Jacob
[1:16:40] finds himself right there and he's he's
[1:16:42] getting ready to get right there before
[1:16:45] God and he's still got all these pain
[1:16:47] and hurt and fear and doubts and
[1:16:51] trouble so let me ask you tonight what
[1:16:54] are you wrestling
[1:16:56] and how long are you going to wrestle it
[1:16:59] and let it keep you away from the
[1:17:00] promises of
[1:17:06] God Jacob finally is getting into a
[1:17:10] place in this wrestling match and God is
[1:17:13] putting the pressure on him but Jacob
[1:17:16] refuses to give up I like that about him
[1:17:19] we heard a lot of negative about him let
[1:17:21] me tell you I could tell you a lot of
[1:17:22] negative about me you could tell me a l
[1:17:25] of negative about you I'm not worried
[1:17:27] about that what I'm worried about is are
[1:17:30] you willing from this day forward to
[1:17:31] grab a hold of God and say God take a
[1:17:35] hold of my hand when I can't walk help
[1:17:37] me walk when I don't know what to do
[1:17:39] Lead Me Lord when I don't know which
[1:17:42] direction to turn bless me Lord when my
[1:17:45] kids are sick bless them with healing
[1:17:51] lord they're in this struggle and God is
[1:17:54] is is putting it all on him and he's
[1:17:55] trying to get him to surrender to his
[1:17:57] own
[1:17:58] will and God touches him in the hollow
[1:18:01] of his thigh
[1:18:03] oh do anybody ever had hip
[1:18:06] pain back
[1:18:08] pain sciatic how about
[1:18:14] that so now God has got his
[1:18:18] attention God has put his thumb right in
[1:18:21] the hollow of his thigh and dislocated
[1:18:23] his hip joint
[1:18:26] why did he do
[1:18:28] that why did God do that was was it so
[1:18:32] that he could win so that he could
[1:18:33] him so that he could make him a
[1:18:35] for the rest of his
[1:18:37] life no but he' done that so that he
[1:18:40] would have to walk a little
[1:18:43] different he done that so that he would
[1:18:45] realize I I I no longer walk as a sneaky
[1:18:49] snake I no longer walk as a caniver but
[1:18:52] now I walk in truth now now I walk in
[1:18:55] love now I walk in forgiveness now I
[1:18:58] walk in the trust of the Holy
[1:19:01] Ghost he's walking a little
[1:19:05] different he ain't as powerful as he
[1:19:07] once
[1:19:10] was I can imagine him quoting some
[1:19:13] prophetic scripture when I'm
[1:19:16] weak then I'm
[1:19:19] strong because it ain't
[1:19:22] me it's God
[1:19:27] long about Daybreak comes
[1:19:30] in and God says let me go for the day
[1:19:33] breth and he says I'll not let you
[1:19:39] go do you ever wanted something so bad
[1:19:41] you'd do about anything for
[1:19:44] it how about a blessing from
[1:19:48] God I'm not going to let you go unless
[1:19:51] you bless me unless you bless me with
[1:19:55] all that I have need of because I need
[1:19:58] Victory I will wrestle you God Almighty
[1:20:01] until I become Victorious through your
[1:20:04] blessings hold on to
[1:20:07] it but how many of us
[1:20:10] have held on and wrestled with the same
[1:20:13] old
[1:20:17] problems you got things in your life you
[1:20:19] just can't
[1:20:21] overcome well I guess I'm the only one
[1:20:24] brother B
[1:20:27] and you battle day in and day out and
[1:20:29] and you got this same problem how long
[1:20:32] you going to wrestle with that until you
[1:20:33] let God have the
[1:20:36] victory how long are you going to look
[1:20:38] over your shoulder and wonder when that
[1:20:40] old Satan that old Devil's going to come
[1:20:41] back after
[1:20:43] you how long are you going to hold on to
[1:20:46] it Jacob wasn't worried about the rising
[1:20:49] of the sun he didn't care how long this
[1:20:51] match lasted can you imagine 8 to 10
[1:20:54] hours in a grappling match let's put
[1:20:57] this in
[1:20:58] perspective I'd like to see these two
[1:21:00] guys right here go for 30
[1:21:05] seconds they'd be out of breath sweating
[1:21:08] snorting spitting
[1:21:11] snotting but Jacob refused to give up on
[1:21:14] the blessings of
[1:21:16] God and he held on and he held on and he
[1:21:20] kept holding on
[1:21:25] and he held on until this wrestling
[1:21:27] match was
[1:21:30] over and the Lord had
[1:21:33] won you say the Lord won Jacob won who
[1:21:36] won well the Lord won and Jacob won
[1:21:39] because Jacob yielded to the
[1:21:43] Lord I don't care how you slice it they
[1:21:46] both
[1:21:49] winners how was Jacob and winter his
[1:21:51] whole identity had changed he's a new
[1:21:53] man he's a new new heart a new vision
[1:21:56] he's a new creation in Christ and he
[1:21:58] looks down here and his name which was
[1:22:03] Jacob as he looked God in face to face
[1:22:06] and had to tell him my name is Jacob I
[1:22:08] am a deceiver and he said not any more
[1:22:13] that's right you are a deceiver anymore
[1:22:16] you've asked for blessing you've asked
[1:22:18] for everything that you ever wanted and
[1:22:20] now I'm going to bless you and I will
[1:22:22] now call your name Israel because you
[1:22:25] have come face to face with
[1:22:31] God I love to come face to face with God
[1:22:36] I love it when God just Woos me right
[1:22:38] into his presence and pulls me right up
[1:22:41] there and the Holy Ghost anointing comes
[1:22:43] over us and we can tuck ourselves right
[1:22:45] up into the bosom of God and look at him
[1:22:47] face to face and say oh my
[1:22:52] Lord and Jacob looks at this place and
[1:22:55] he calls it
[1:22:57] panel he names this place the place of
[1:23:00] panel for I have seen God face to face
[1:23:03] and my life is
[1:23:06] preserved do you notice he didn't worry
[1:23:09] anymore about
[1:23:12] Esau it didn't matter anymore because he
[1:23:16] had come in contact with God no matter
[1:23:19] what happened his life was preserved
[1:23:22] he'd come face to face with God and now
[1:23:24] he knows what it means to live in the
[1:23:26] very presence of God his whole identity
[1:23:32] changed stand with me tonight I told you
[1:23:35] I wasn't going to keep you
[1:23:41] long listen to what the prophet
[1:23:44] says he said after Jacob wrestled all
[1:23:48] night instead of trying to war away that
[1:23:51] man Jacob held on to him he said I wish
[1:23:54] we had about a half an hour on that how
[1:23:57] that wrestling Prince how he was able to
[1:24:00] hold on until he got what he was after
[1:24:03] he held on until it took all night but
[1:24:06] he stayed there he wanted to be
[1:24:08] absolutely convinced and he stayed until
[1:24:11] God changed his
[1:24:13] walking he was convinced he says that's
[1:24:16] the trouble with us today we don't stay
[1:24:19] long enough till we get our walking
[1:24:22] convinced we don't walk like Christians
[1:24:25] we just stay long enough with
[1:24:32] him just stay long enough with
[1:24:39] him do we have the determination it
[1:24:43] takes do we have the determination that
[1:24:46] it takes for us to stay with him a
[1:24:47] little longer until he makes us walk
[1:24:49] different talk different live different
[1:24:52] act different believe different be
[1:24:53] different
[1:24:55] yeah because that's what the prophet
[1:24:56] said Jacob did yeah he said the things
[1:24:59] that we don't the think that we don't
[1:25:01] stay long enough we don't hold on he
[1:25:03] said Jacob held on he said let me loose
[1:25:06] I got to
[1:25:08] go how many of you have held on and
[1:25:10] prayed to God long enough that he says
[1:25:12] hey I got to
[1:25:16] go not too many hands went up there was
[1:25:21] it but how many times we I wish wish we
[1:25:24] could get lost in a place to where time
[1:25:27] don't
[1:25:29] matter to where the next appointment
[1:25:31] don't matter to where the next job
[1:25:35] matter to where the next ball game don't
[1:25:38] matter and we just get lost in
[1:25:43] God and he says he he had him there
[1:25:46] where he could talk different live
[1:25:47] different act different believe
[1:25:49] different be different he said he held
[1:25:51] on he said I'm not going to let you go
[1:25:53] until I'm thoroughly convinced he said
[1:25:56] and when you take a promise of God and
[1:25:58] hold on to that don't let him
[1:26:03] loose when you have a need when you have
[1:26:06] a a a a sickness in your life don't turn
[1:26:09] him loose don't settle for oh well I'm a
[1:26:13] Christian I'm
[1:26:15] saved say
[1:26:17] God bless me with
[1:26:19] healing and I'm going to hold on to
[1:26:22] that and if this sickness takes me to
[1:26:25] the Grave I'm going to hold on being
[1:26:32] healed he said and when you're
[1:26:34] convinced you want to know how you're
[1:26:38] convinced when you're convinced he said
[1:26:40] then you're concerned for
[1:26:43] others you see it didn't matter to Jacob
[1:26:47] anymore he let Esau have everything he
[1:26:50] he had it didn't matter money didn't
[1:26:52] matter popularity didn't matter matter
[1:26:55] cattle didn't matter homes don't matter
[1:26:57] cars don't
[1:26:59] matter but when you got something from
[1:27:01] God and you got a h of it then you're
[1:27:04] concerned for others he said there's
[1:27:06] something about it that makes you
[1:27:10] concerned let's just bow our heads
[1:27:12] tonight and
[1:27:14] pray Heavenly Father we just come before
