[44:01] was talking about how that he was
[44:03] had the job on the ash sheep i guess for
[44:05] a longest time and he preached on a
[44:07] certain series over a year i guess
[44:09] it was a long time and he i never could
[44:11] get job off that ashy man so
[44:14] you know i'll remember the woman asking
[44:16] brother brandon when are you going to
[44:17] get job off the ash sheep so he must
[44:19] have got a lot out of that ash sheep
[44:21] amen

[44:25] that place is like
[44:28] most of us have been there before amen
[44:31] all right so revelations one
[44:46] and verse 7-8 behold he cometh with
[44:50] clouds
[44:51] and every eye shall see him
[44:53] and they also which pierced him and all
[44:56] kindreds
[44:57] of the earth shall wail because of him
[45:00] even so
[45:02] amen
[45:04] even so so be it right
[45:07] that's right
[45:09] i am alpha and omega
[45:12] the beginning
[45:13] and the ending saith the lord
[45:16] which is which was
[45:18] and which is to come
[45:20] the almighty
[45:23] over in samuel ii samuel 22.
[45:35] i'm sorry not samuel
[45:36] exodus three
[45:39] exodus three
[45:45] and verse 13
[45:48] and moses said unto god
[45:50] behold when i come unto the children of
[45:52] israel and say unto them
[45:55] the god of your fathers has sent me unto
[45:57] you
[45:58] and they shall say unto me what is his
[46:00] name
[46:01] what shall i say unto them
[46:03] and gets god said unto moses i am
[46:07] that i am
[46:09] and he said thus shalt thou say unto the
[46:11] children of israel
[46:12] i am has sent me unto you
[46:17] amen may god add his blessings to the
[46:19] reading of the word you can be seated
[46:22] once again with for a little while
[46:24] tonight i'd like to look at
[46:27] uh who god is is that all right
[46:30] and just who god is now
[46:33] tonight we want to speak on the subject
[46:36] and i want to read this scripture yet
[46:41] a couple more scriptures if i might
[46:45] in colossians 1 verse 16 says for by him
[46:48] were all things created
[46:50] that are in heaven
[46:52] and that are in earth visible
[46:55] and invisible
[46:57] whether there be thrones or dominions
[47:00] or principalities
[47:02] or powers
[47:04] all things were created by him and for
[47:08] him
[47:09] and he is before
[47:11] all things
[47:13] now notice there
[47:15] notice it says he is right
[47:18] that's the same meaning as
[47:21] i am
[47:22] right before all things were he was
[47:26] that's why i can always say i am yeah i
[47:28] am
[47:30] it's to if you would just to think
[47:32] naturally speaking you'd kind of
[47:34] think of it as a strange name
[47:36] you know if i ask you what's your name
[47:38] you'd say i am
[47:40] well i am too now what's your name right
[47:43] we all are right
[47:45] but that's what he called himself god
[47:46] called himself the i am
[47:51] amen
[47:54] i don't know if i do but just that very
[47:56] thought does something for me
[48:01] now you know because with god ain't
[48:03] nothing shallow
[48:05] right
[48:06] but god ain't nothing shallow it's it's
[48:09] deep
[48:10] and that you know and i and we read over
[48:12] there where it says in revelations he
[48:15] says
[48:16] uh i am
[48:18] he which was
[48:22] and
[48:23] which is
[48:25] and which is to come
[48:30] now
[48:32] what does that mean that means that he
[48:35] is the past
[48:38] he's the future and he's the present
[48:41] he's the past he's the present
[48:43] he's the future
[48:47] amen
[48:48] that's what he is
[48:50] he's everything that ever was
[48:53] he's everything that he is
[48:56] he is everything that is to come he's
[48:58] the future
[49:01] and it doesn't matter when the future
[49:03] comes he'll still be the i am of the
[49:05] future he'll say i am i told you i was
[49:09] you know he's always the i am whether
[49:11] it's in the past the future you see i am
[49:16] amen
[49:18] now we know that everything that was
[49:20] created now
[49:22] i've read that i i didn't have it here
[49:24] right here but
[49:26] the one thing i believe that
[49:29] one of the things that this message the
[49:31] prophet of the hour
[49:32] brought out to us that we didn't really
[49:34] believe or know before and i i don't i i
[49:37] don't understand it
[49:39] i just know the word says it
[49:42] so my mind has to conform to what it
[49:44] says
[49:46] and i can show you in scriptures there
[49:47] where he says behold he says he says
[49:50] i create these things and then it
[49:52] cleanly says i
[49:54] create evil
[49:58] that's what he said
[50:00] i create evil
[50:06] huh a little bit hard for us to imagine
[50:08] right but that's what it says
[50:11] i create evil there was nothing
[50:13] according to scripture there's nothing
[50:14] made that was made
[50:18] true right
[50:19] absolutely nothing could have been could
[50:22] be
[50:22] unless he created it
[50:26] and you don't have to understand it you
[50:28] just got to believe it
[50:30] amen
[50:31] all right
[50:32] we'll leave that alone for now
[50:35] but
[50:36] so we see here that everything that was
[50:37] made
[50:38] he is all of the past he's the present
[50:41] he's the future
[50:43] what that tells me
[50:45] is that he is
[50:47] and always will be
[50:49] and always has been
[50:51] he is what was that it means that he is
[50:55] forever
[50:56] he is eternal
[51:05] so that gives you a smile because why
[51:08] how many knows that
[51:10] you are
[51:12] but if you don't get to be part of the
[51:15] one that is eternal
[51:17] they'll be kind when you're not
[51:22] there come a time
[51:24] when you will cease to exist
[51:27] that's called losing your soul
[51:30] all right that's the worst thing that
[51:32] can ever happen to anybody is for them
[51:34] to what lose their so you will be lost
[51:40] in other words gone
[51:43] forever
[51:46] and i can't help but think that when
[51:48] people are in hell being punished for
[51:51] their sins
[51:52] one of the worst things is that they're
[51:54] going to realize is that they're going
[51:55] to cease to exist
[51:58] huh
[51:59] that's right they're going to come to an
[52:01] end
[52:03] now
[52:04] most churches most people most
[52:07] denominations and especially where i
[52:10] come from
[52:11] one thing they believe is that hell is
[52:13] eternal
[52:17] all right they believe that you're gonna
[52:19] burn
[52:21] that's right you're gonna sizzle
[52:24] burn
[52:26] what water is gonna be in fire
[52:30] far
[52:31] eternity
[52:36] if that don't scare the liver out of you
[52:38] i don't know what will
[52:42] if that don't try to make people do
[52:44] right i don't know what will
[52:47] no break
[52:48] [Music]
[52:49] never no end that's what they believe
[52:52] in that the truth how many knows that's
[52:54] what most people out there believe that
[52:56] it's eternal
[52:58] but we find out
[53:00] that it doesn't go with all the
[53:02] scriptures
[53:04] amen
[53:05] because it talks about he that is part
[53:07] of the first resurrection cannot be
[53:09] touched by the second death
[53:12] right
[53:13] the soul that sinneth it shall surely
[53:17] die
[53:19] that's right
[53:21] amen
[53:22] and so even in a natural st natural
[53:26] sense
[53:26] people can do things that will earn them
[53:30] 10 20 lifetimes in prison right
[53:33] or one lifetime in prison
[53:35] or so long in prison
[53:38] according to what they do
[53:40] but they do have a limit on it there is
[53:42] a time limit right
[53:43] [Applause]
[53:45] amen don't you just love the way that
[53:47] people have compromised on
[53:49] uh life terms life terms ain't no life
[53:52] terms anymore you ain't in prison for
[53:54] life you're only there for 20 years
[53:56] well if you live to be 60 you can live
[53:58] another 40 years after you're out of
[54:00] jail you know it's not life
[54:03] they call 20 years i guess you find that
[54:04] wrong right
[54:06] it's just a certain amount of time
[54:08] and then you can get out on good
[54:09] behavior perhaps
[54:11] oh my anyway let's not go down there
[54:15] amen so tonight what i want to want to
[54:17] deal with
[54:19] with the help of the lord for just a
[54:20] little while
[54:22] is the next scripture
[54:30] it's found in ephesians 4
[54:32] and 6.
[54:35] no it's not
[54:37] my forgive me now
[54:39] let me look where this is
[54:43] i've got so many scriptures a lot of
[54:44] times that
[54:46] and i'm praying and looking at others i
[54:48] don't get them lined up the way that i
[54:50] want to
[54:54] here's 116
[54:57] and then i have another one
[55:00] colossians 3 11 okay
[55:02] colossians 3.
[55:06] eleven there it is
[55:08] this will be our thought
[55:15] where there is neither
[55:17] greek
[55:18] well let me go back to verse 10 so we
[55:20] can understand what we're talking about
[55:22] and have put on the new man which is
[55:24] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[55:27] him
[55:28] that created him
[55:29] all right
[55:31] where
[55:32] now notice where there is neither greek
[55:35] nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision
[55:39] barbarian thin
[55:41] born nor free
[55:43] but christ
[55:45] is all
[55:47] and
[55:48] in all
[55:50] all in all
[55:52] amen so that's what we're going to talk
[55:54] about tonight with the help god is all
[55:58] and in
[56:00] all
[56:02] whoo
[56:03] how he believes that uh over in
[56:05] colossians i believe it was it says that
[56:07] he is the head of the body colossians 2
[56:10] 1 and verse 18. he is the head of the
[56:11] body the church who is the beginning the
[56:13] firstborn from the dead that in all
[56:15] things he might have the preeminence
[56:20] amen
[56:23] that he meant all things he might be
[56:25] over in revelations to scripture we all
[56:26] like real well they worshipped him
[56:28] because she they said thou has created
[56:30] all things and for thy pleasure they are
[56:34] and were created
[56:36] how many knows everything was created
[56:39] for his pleasure
[56:42] everything folks
[56:45] oh my
[56:47] was created for his purpose
[56:50] for his reason
[56:52] in other words nobody's gonna get the
[56:54] advantage and change the plan
[56:56] the plan's not going to get changed
[56:59] everything was created by him
[57:01] and for him
[57:04] praise be to god
[57:09] amen
[57:10] and he is all
[57:13] and he is in
[57:15] oh
[57:19] let me read you a couple stories
[57:24] some time ago a man was on his road to
[57:27] the seaside
[57:29] and he was going over there for a rest
[57:31] and he wanted to refresh himself
[57:33] because he loved the thought
[57:36] that he would hear the seagulls as they
[57:38] flew over the water and skipped down by
[57:41] the great white-tipped waves as they
[57:43] roared
[57:45] and bursted in the air
[57:48] he wanted to smell the salt water
[57:52] he said it'll be such a rest to live by
[57:54] the seashore for a while
[57:56] i just want to rest i want to live by
[57:59] the seashore and see all the things that
[58:01] she has to offer the blue skies as it
[58:04] reflects from the sky to the water
[58:06] how the foam of the salt water will boil
[58:09] up to the great waves strike
[58:12] and roll
[58:14] and he said if i can just stand and look
[58:16] at that and hear the scream of the gall
[58:21] those of us who likes to go to the beach
[58:22] can know what i'm talking about here
[58:26] amen get on one of the
[58:28] uh i hate
[58:31] gravity chairs and
[58:33] just lay back
[58:34] right
[58:35] those wave rolling and the seagull
[58:38] screaming and all of that if you hear it
[58:40] long enough you can actually sleep under
[58:42] all of that
[58:44] and just rest
[58:45] wake up with the sunburn or whatever
[58:48] but yeah listen so he wanted to go there
[58:50] and just rest
[58:52] on his road down okay
[58:54] he says and on his road down to the
[58:56] seashore he met a man coming and he was
[58:59] an old salt an old sailor from disease
[59:01] says where goes thou
[59:03] and he says i go down to the seesaw to
[59:05] enjoy the goodness of the sea
[59:08] the old saul said i don't see nothing
[59:11] strange about it the waters are just
[59:13] waters the skies just the sky
[59:16] the gaul is just another bird
[59:20] you see
[59:21] he had seen it so much until it had just
[59:23] become common to him it wasn't thrilling
[59:26] to him anymore and brother bams that's
[59:28] the way the church has gotten about
[59:30] god amen
[59:34] that's the way the people have gotten to
[59:36] where god is all around
[59:39] amen how many i don't know this is one
[59:41] thing that i really enjoy and that i
[59:44] really get and that is whenever i see a
[59:46] beautiful sunset or beautiful clouds
[59:50] even right
[59:52] i mean
[59:53] beautiful and i just say lord
[59:57] thank you jesus for painting me such a
[59:59] beautiful picture
[1:00:01] huh or maybe he's the best greatest
[1:00:04] artist that i have ever seen
[1:00:07] and just as the sun goes down it isn't
[1:00:10] just a stationary picture on the wall it
[1:00:13] is evolving all the time sometimes it'll
[1:00:16] get greater sometimes it'll diminish
[1:00:19] huh
[1:00:20] man he'll have he'll have eagles up
[1:00:23] there he'll have all kinds of different
[1:00:26] you know how many know that people have
[1:00:28] seen the clouds and it looks like an
[1:00:30] angel up there and they'll take a
[1:00:32] picture and it looks like an angel or
[1:00:34] jesus returning and all kinds of things
[1:00:36] that god will paint
[1:00:39] but people don't even realize it
[1:00:41] oh that's just the sky that's just the
[1:00:43] cloud no that's god up there
[1:00:47] god is all around how many believe god
[1:00:49] is all around
[1:00:54] the old salt it had just become common
[1:00:56] to him
[1:00:58] that's the way it is with us that's the
[1:00:59] way it is with people on the world they
[1:01:01] just it's god everywhere but they just
[1:01:04] don't see him
[1:01:05] amen
[1:01:07] three stories i want to read here just
[1:01:09] to lay a foundation
[1:01:13] the next one is
[1:01:15] here not long ago
[1:01:16] a little boy going to sunday school down
[1:01:19] in our city
[1:01:20] and to a very prominent church he heard
[1:01:23] so much about god till he said to his
[1:01:24] mama
[1:01:25] mom i want to ask you something
[1:01:28] could some could anybody see god
[1:01:31] oh he's so great he said oh he's so
[1:01:34] great
[1:01:35] i'd like to know if somebody could see
[1:01:37] him
[1:01:38] why she said sonny ask your sunday
[1:01:41] school teacher
[1:01:43] so you asked the sunday school teacher
[1:01:45] she says well i don't know you better
[1:01:47] ask the pastor
[1:01:50] the pastor was coming home with them for
[1:01:52] lunch and he said pastor i want to ask
[1:01:54] you a question can anyone see god
[1:01:57] he said oh no of course not no man can
[1:02:00] see god no one can see him
[1:02:02] well the little fellow was disappointed
[1:02:05] and he used to stay down on the river
[1:02:07] near the ohio river he used to go down
[1:02:09] there with an old fisherman up there on
[1:02:11] the river
[1:02:12] a piece towards the six mile island
[1:02:14] fishing all the time
[1:02:16] and one day after a big rain along this
[1:02:19] time of the year he was coming pulling
[1:02:20] down through those waters you know
[1:02:22] and anybody any boatman knows the music
[1:02:25] is after rain is over and a little bitty
[1:02:27] waves on the water and you let your oars
[1:02:30] clip across it
[1:02:32] as you pull pulling your boat and it was
[1:02:34] clipping along like that and the old
[1:02:36] fisherman had a long white beard
[1:02:39] he began to look over his shoulder and
[1:02:41] where the sun come out and the rain had
[1:02:43] been and made a rainbow and he pulled
[1:02:45] ours you know
[1:02:47] and he turned around and looked and the
[1:02:48] little fellows noticed here stripping
[1:02:50] from the old white man's beard
[1:02:53] as he dropped down and he pulled a
[1:02:54] little further and he looked back
[1:02:57] an older little boy he got he was
[1:02:58] sitting by the bow of the boat so he ran
[1:03:01] up there towards the stern of the boat
[1:03:02] and he said sir
[1:03:03] i'm going to ask you a question that my
[1:03:05] mother couldn't answer my sunday school
[1:03:07] teaching teacher couldn't answer or my
[1:03:09] pastor
[1:03:10] he said god is so great said can anyone
[1:03:13] see him
[1:03:14] and the old fisherman pulled his oars
[1:03:17] into his lap throwed his hands to his
[1:03:19] face like that and wept out
[1:03:22] grabbed the little fellow and hugged him
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:27] and said god bless your little heart
[1:03:29] honey
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:33] what does that tell you first of all it
[1:03:35] tells you this man was sensitive
[1:03:38] this man had feeling
[1:03:40] when the boy asked him just a simple

[1:06:51] figure out what makes this little little
[1:06:53] old blade of grass

[1:07:32] he's in nature
[1:07:34] everywhere i see him there
[1:07:35] [Applause]
[1:07:37] and i happened to look and i heard now
[1:07:39] notice he heard one place he's called to
[1:07:42] the wolf
[1:07:43] no coyote hollering up the hill there
[1:07:47] amen
[1:07:54] right
[1:07:57] right
[1:07:58] that's right
[1:08:00] oh we hear him down and i holler all the
[1:08:02] time
[1:08:03] i like to get my mind millimeter go out
[1:08:04] the backyard
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:07] eat that up the holler for a little bit
[1:08:10] we don't like coyotes too much we're
[1:08:11] missing way too many chickens
[1:08:17] that's right
[1:08:21] but anyway
[1:08:22] but what was it one calls here isn't it
[1:08:25] something
[1:08:27] better man preaching on the deep cause
[1:08:28] of the deep he was preaching on life
[1:08:30] he was talking about how that you know
[1:08:32] that
[1:08:33] you know you can hear it i can hear it
[1:08:34] out there at my place man i'll tell you
[1:08:36] what if one goes across the road way
[1:08:37] over there and he begins to yipping or
[1:08:39] whatever all of a sudden down in the
[1:08:41] hall away over there something that
[1:08:43] lands back
[1:08:45] huh
[1:08:46] i mean they know each other's call
[1:08:50] they know the sound and i guarantee you
[1:08:52] they probably know each other well
[1:08:54] enough that they know whether it's the
[1:08:55] alpha or the next to the alpha or
[1:08:57] whatever dog it is or coyote it is they
[1:09:00] know which one they know all of them
[1:09:04] huh
[1:09:06] and i'll tell you what you can sound
[1:09:08] like a cow
[1:09:10] you won't get no answer
[1:09:12] you might get your cow to answer it
[1:09:15] why but it has to be the right sound
[1:09:17] that's why jesus said my sheep know my
[1:09:21] voice
[1:09:22] in a stranger's voice they will not
[1:09:25] follow
[1:09:27] what did he see in the coyote of the
[1:09:29] world what did he hear
[1:09:31] he heard a absolute
[1:09:35] ingenious creator design
[1:09:38] in that animal kingdom
[1:09:41] right something that god had put it
[1:09:43] there it might sound weird and strange
[1:09:47] my wife still say look that ain't no
[1:09:48] coyote you don't sound like that because
[1:09:51] they can make some really weird sounds
[1:09:53] folks
[1:09:55] you can almost make sound like like a
[1:09:56] baby screamer and crying or whatever
[1:10:06] but no they're just talking their
[1:10:07] language
[1:10:10] anyway think about it it's all unique
[1:10:14] another random heard that oh my he could
[1:10:16] hear god in the coyote
[1:10:19] his mate answered him back down in the
[1:10:21] bottom now
[1:10:22] oh my you talk about the deep calling to
[1:10:25] the deep hear the squall of the coyote
[1:10:29] or timberwolf
[1:10:30] that just sets my soul aflame
[1:10:34] i hear him over here hollering he lost
[1:10:37] his mate perhaps through the storm and
[1:10:38] she answered him way down over here in
[1:10:40] the bottoms
[1:10:42] and i thought oh god i gotta make two
[1:10:44] now call and he'll answer me one of
[1:10:47] these days
[1:10:49] oh god there you are
[1:10:53] amen
[1:10:55] how many likes to see god
[1:10:57] you can see god all around folks
[1:11:00] if you don't see god you need to look
[1:11:02] harder
[1:11:03] one place brother man preached on god in
[1:11:05] his universe god in his uh
[1:11:07] nature god in his word
[1:11:10] and god in his people
[1:11:12] only god is in his people
[1:11:15] it's not easy it's not hard to see god
[1:11:17] in one another
[1:11:20] amen
[1:11:21] how many believes that it's not hard to
[1:11:23] see
[1:11:25] i'll get to that
[1:11:26] here in a minute
[1:11:28] but no not notice
[1:11:31] oh my
[1:11:33] i heard the bugle of the elk
[1:11:36] that i was trying to catch up with
[1:11:38] big old male elk he let a long bugle out
[1:11:42] and i ain't gonna sound like that
[1:11:44] we're in the pulpit after all
[1:11:47] no not really but anyway
[1:11:49] listen
[1:11:50] big old bugle
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:53] i like the sound
[1:11:54] i practiced a long time on my whoa
[1:11:58] and i'm keeping it down
[1:12:01] i was like but now
[1:12:03] my oh my i like that that call it sounds
[1:12:07] masculine it sounds like you he's big
[1:12:10] bad and mean
[1:12:12] but you know what they say you don't
[1:12:14] want to use that too much what you want
[1:12:15] to use is this little cow call that just
[1:12:17] says this little
[1:12:19] some kind of i can't make the sound but
[1:12:21] just little little call
[1:12:23] for the cow because you know you want to
[1:12:25] make the cow sound make the
[1:12:27] people think that it's a cow
[1:12:30] but just the different things listen he
[1:12:31] said you heard that great elk bugle
[1:12:34] the storm had separated the elk up there
[1:12:36] on high
[1:12:37] he had lost his hurt and he was calling
[1:12:39] to them i thought oh god
[1:12:41] you live up here
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:47] i remember long time ago i was watching
[1:12:49] something about people who live out
[1:12:51] there in the woods
[1:12:53] maybe in russia or something they lived
[1:12:54] out there for as long as longest time
[1:12:56] and one thing one thing they said was
[1:12:59] this out here has a way of purifying you
[1:13:04] this out here purifies you
[1:13:09] i believe it
[1:13:11] i believe it does because god is out
[1:13:13] there there's no city there's no sin and
[1:13:16] wickedness out there everything's pure
[1:13:19] hey and you learn to pray the bear don't
[1:13:21] bite you and eat you and pray for your
[1:13:23] food and you just get close to god
[1:13:26] you may not believe it that's a way of
[1:13:27] being pure
[1:13:30] because god is out there
[1:13:32] you live out here that's right here you
[1:13:34] are
[1:13:36] and there he was in the elk herd
[1:13:38] there he was in the call of the wolf
[1:13:42] then they went on to talk about seeing
[1:13:43] that spine squirrel and seeing the uh
[1:13:47] the great big old eagle that was down
[1:13:49] the beautiful eagle and so forth and
[1:13:52] after brother branham heard the elk the
[1:13:54] uh the uh the elk bugle and the coyote
[1:13:57] scream and so forth you're almighty god
[1:14:00] so overjoyed he went to dancing around
[1:14:02] the tree
[1:14:04] there was a hollering and screaming he
[1:14:05] said man if somebody would have heard me
[1:14:07] then he said you got a maniac out here
[1:14:11] i mean he's acting like a maniac lately
[1:14:14] why because you've seen god so much
[1:14:17] you hear god so much
[1:14:19] until it overjoys you
[1:14:22] but you got to have him where
[1:14:25] in here how many knows to learn this if
[1:14:27] you want to see him anywhere outside
[1:14:30] see him in here
[1:14:31] how many knows it's so easy when you got
[1:14:33] the holy ghost and somebody does a kind
[1:14:35] deed for you do something good for you
[1:14:38] have a little kindness i mean is that so
[1:14:41] wonderful you can see christ in kindness
[1:14:43] be kindly affectionate one to another by
[1:14:45] the bible says
[1:14:47] it doesn't say be rude
[1:14:50] huh
[1:14:51] be gentle or be rough
[1:14:54] no gentleness
[1:14:56] oh my i tell you what
[1:14:58] my boss should have fired me for that
[1:15:00] but he's patient with me
[1:15:02] huh

[1:15:06] you see him in long suffering you see
[1:15:08] him into gentleness in people right

[1:15:16] all out they don't can't even wave to
[1:15:19] you or say hi to you
[1:15:25] huh

[1:15:46] huh you're not just real short with
[1:15:48] people but you're long suffering
[1:15:51] amen i believe brother brad touched on
[1:15:53] that forgiveness i broke down here
[1:15:55] how many knows god is in forgiveness and
[1:15:58] the way that we forgiving one another
[1:16:00] the bible and as christ has forgiven you
[1:16:02] so i want you to forgive your
[1:16:04] those who trespass against you

[1:16:24] sorry i did this i shouldn't have done
[1:16:26] that
[1:16:28] that's god
[1:16:30] why because it takes god to humble
[1:16:31] somebody enough to say i'm sorry or i'm
[1:16:33] wrong
[1:16:34] sorry i was wrong
[1:16:36] folks them things it takes a lot of holy
[1:16:39] ghost
[1:16:40] for people to be able to say that
[1:16:42] brother i was wrong most of us most of
[1:16:44] us
[1:16:45] we don't even
[1:16:46] want to acknowledge or don't see it if
[1:16:48] it isn't for the holy ghost
[1:16:49] but forgiveness amen
[1:16:52] kindness
[1:16:53] on the other hand if somebody holds a
[1:16:55] grudge
[1:16:56] you know that isn't god
[1:16:58] amen
[1:17:00] but he is in everything he is all
[1:17:03] and he is
[1:17:05] all
[1:17:06] i wrote down here teaching on creation
[1:17:10] this is the way he ought to teach it
[1:17:12] that god created everything
[1:17:14] and he is in his creation
[1:17:17] you can see it in the
[1:17:19] oak tree
[1:17:20] in every kind of plant
[1:17:22] [Applause]
[1:17:24] you can see god
[1:17:26] actually
[1:17:31] well
[1:17:33] brother branham said that people that
[1:17:35] are trying to disprove disprove their
[1:17:37] own theory
[1:17:38] about evolution and they'll mix this
[1:17:40] corn with this and and they can hybrid
[1:17:43] it can mix and become something else but
[1:17:45] it can't never breed back
[1:17:47] so it proves no you got to stay with the
[1:17:49] original
[1:17:51] if you're going to have anything that
[1:17:52] reproduces itself
[1:17:55] amen
[1:17:56] you can see it in the trees you can see
[1:17:58] in nature you can see it in every aspect
[1:18:01] you can see god if you want to look and
[1:18:04] see for him because he's there
[1:18:06] you can see him in his people we can see
[1:18:08] it in one another
[1:18:10] how many believe that
[1:18:12] and we can certainly see it in his word
[1:18:16] i don't believe we can see god in his
[1:18:18] word he's he is all and he is in all you
[1:18:21] just have to look a little harder

[1:21:54] the other but
[1:21:55] but it just seemed like the anchor
[1:21:57] anchor doesn't do you any good if you're
[1:22:00] hitting the bottom and all it is is sand
[1:22:04] i mean there's a current it's going to
[1:22:05] just drag you right along
[1:22:08] we're heading right for the fall
[1:22:12] man if you die tomorrow without god
[1:22:14] you're done forever right
[1:22:17] but it was just nothing there but the
[1:22:19] water was really clear
[1:22:22] and i was heading down towards that fall
[1:22:24] and i looked and i see my anchor drag
[1:22:26] you know i don't know what to do i don't
[1:22:28] know what to do
[1:22:30] right
[1:22:31] because god had placed something in my
[1:22:33] heart a hunger for god
[1:22:34] i was a ship i was a boat i'm a person
[1:22:37] i'm a human i'm
[1:22:38] so drifting on the sea
[1:22:41] but it doesn't do any good if you just
[1:22:42] got sand on the bottom
[1:22:44] you need something for it to grab a hold
[1:22:46] of it how many knows an anchor comes
[1:22:47] down here like this and has a y like a
[1:22:49] hook here right hook here and hook there
[1:22:52] that's not made to catch sand
[1:22:54] it's made to catch a hard object
[1:22:57] that's connected to the bottom
[1:23:00] and it's called the rock
[1:23:02] all right
[1:23:03] he's a rock
[1:23:07] that's another thing he is
[1:23:09] he's a rock in the weary land oh jesus
[1:23:12] is a rock in a weary land a weary land
[1:23:15] are we relent right
[1:23:18] and as i was going i see this rock
[1:23:20] because i could see i know that's a rock
[1:23:23] but guess what that anchor needed to
[1:23:26] grab that rock
[1:23:29] am i right
[1:23:31] amen as i went over it like watch them
[1:23:34] oh i pray god do something save me i
[1:23:36] can't save myself you know and you might
[1:23:38] have tried this and tried that and man
[1:23:41] you know you just can't do anything
[1:23:42] without christ
[1:23:44] and sure enough by god's grace
[1:23:48] even as i went past it i couldn't look
[1:23:50] under there but all of a sudden i felt
[1:23:53] something tug
[1:23:55] and jerk my boat whoa
[1:23:57] right
[1:23:59] folks i don't know about you but that's
[1:24:01] shaking and that tugging and that jerk
[1:24:03] is the best thing that ever happened in
[1:24:05] my life
[1:24:07] because i knew
[1:24:08] that i wasn't coasting anymore there was
[1:24:11] some resistance to me heading towards
[1:24:13] the fall
[1:24:16] oh my aren't you glad
[1:24:18] folks your daddy can't do it your mama
[1:24:20] can't do it every individual has to have
[1:24:23] that personal experience
[1:24:26] and revelation of catching that anchor
[1:24:29] on the rock rock of ages cleft for me
[1:24:32] let me hide myself in thee
[1:24:34] amen it gripped
[1:24:37] praise the lord
[1:24:38] [Music]
[1:24:40] amen it gripped that rock that was there
[1:24:42] and it held and it jerked and it saved
[1:24:45] my life
[1:24:48] praise be to god aren't you glad for
[1:24:50] that
[1:24:52] amen
[1:24:54] like the song says you wanna you know
[1:24:56] because a lot of people have
[1:24:58] chills that have experiences in church
[1:25:01] and chills run down their spine and oh

[1:25:05] shake and everything else you know and
[1:25:07] praise the lord but the next day they're
[1:25:08] about they're doing the same thing they
[1:25:10] did before
[1:25:12] huh
[1:25:13] they're just you know they're just
[1:25:15] grabbing a hold of small stones or
[1:25:17] something and getting a little jerk
[1:25:18] that's about all they get
[1:25:20] but bibles or the song says be very sure
[1:25:24] be sure be very sure your anger holds
[1:25:29] and grips the solid rock
[1:25:37] amen how many is left
[1:25:39] that your heart grip the solid rock

[1:33:11] scriptures and show you that sometimes
[1:33:13] sometimes i'm going to show you
[1:33:15] where the prophet of god said that
[1:33:18] as
[1:33:19] all that christ was
[1:33:21] he all the god was reported into what
[1:33:23] christ
[1:33:25] all that christ was he poured

[1:34:07] let's stand tonight
[1:34:12] with our heads bowed
[1:34:16] both here and out there on streaming
[1:34:19] with our heads about how many
[1:34:22] would like to say i really
[1:34:25] want to see him more than i do
[1:34:28] i want to see him
[1:34:30] planer
[1:34:31] than what i do
[1:34:34] if that is your hand and confession
[1:34:36] tonight then remember
[1:34:39] the question is now how do i get to see
[1:34:42] him
[1:34:43] well we just said it earlier if i was to
[1:34:45] quiz you or test you
[1:34:48] the answer would be
[1:34:50] that you have to have more of him
[1:34:53] on the inside isn't that right
[1:34:56] because when you have him on the inside
[1:34:58] you'll see him on the outside you'll see
[1:35:01] him in all everything that he's created
[1:35:03] because he's in it all
[1:35:05] let's bow our heads lord jesus you see
[1:35:07] our hearts you see our hands up and
[1:35:09] we're saying lord jesus help us
[1:35:11] not to be like the story of the old salt
[1:35:15] that had seen so much of it until it
[1:35:17] just didn't mean anything into him
[1:35:18] anymore don't let us be like that but
[1:35:21] lord help us to be sensitive father lord
[1:35:23] when we see
[1:35:24] the seagull when we hear the waves when
[1:35:27] we see the ocean when we see the sun
[1:35:29] rising in the morning we know that's you
[1:35:32] you created everything that is created
[1:35:35] comes from you is a part of you god
[1:35:39] lord jesus we just ask god tonight that
[1:35:41] you would help us
[1:35:43] tonight and tomorrow morning when we go
[1:35:46] to work that we wouldn't be the same as
[1:35:48] we did and were when we come to church
[1:35:50] tonight
[1:35:51] but tomorrow we would look harder for
[1:35:53] you and say god i need more
[1:35:57] of you
[1:35:59] so that i can see
[1:36:00] you
[1:36:02] plainer
[1:36:03] than what i see you right now forgive us
