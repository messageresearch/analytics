[14:05] they are more than can be
[14:18] numbered then said I lo I come in the

[16:06] give him a hand say thank you Lord Jesus
[16:09] for your wonderful promise amen
[16:29] morning brothers and
[16:32] sisters I was uh one of those uh
[16:35] scriptures that are stuck out to me
[16:37] excuse me brother we read in that
[16:42] Psalm the seventh one it said then said
[16:45] I lo I come in the volume of the book is
[16:48] written of me and I was just thinking
[16:50] everything that all the promises we have
[16:53] everything that we encounter our life is
[16:56] written in the promises of God and in
[16:58] the word word of God this
[17:00] morning this has been I don't know how
[17:03] little bit difficult of a week you know
[17:05] we all as men and as women you know we
[17:08] start as children and then you know as
[17:10] your life it's like a needle it goes
[17:12] from it you know it's opposite though
[17:14] you start full and you wind up empty at
[17:17] the end as you go on to your Eternal
[17:19] reward and you know I me and uh
[17:22] Ecclesiastes three were fussing W with
[17:25] each other you know in my life I've done
[17:27] I've had two separate careers years I
[17:29] you know I spent all those years on
[17:30] active duty and I had to go off active
[17:33] duty and I was just not trying to be
[17:35] funny I had to turn that service truck
[17:37] in and that was a hard that was just as
[17:40] hard to do for me as uh leaving active
[17:43] duty because you know when you do
[17:44] something so long you get kind of hooked
[17:47] to it you know what I mean but but I was
[17:49] thinking about Ecclesiastes 3 you know
[17:52] there's a time and season for everything
[17:54] and I was thinking more of the young men
[17:56] and young women here if if God is
[17:59] opening a door for you and closing
[18:01] another one don't be afraid to walk in
[18:03] it however he's leading you in the word
[18:05] of God or whatever he's wanting you to
[18:08] do don't be afraid of closing a door and
[18:10] opening another one in your I know in my
[18:13] own life there's times that I've missed
[18:15] opportunities because I was afraid to
[18:17] close one door and open another door but
[18:20] if you would turn with me to um I'm not
[18:22] going to read the third chapter of
[18:24] Ecclesiastes but I was just thinking um
[18:27] if you would turn with me to I'm trying
[18:30] to figure out where to go this morning
[18:31] turn with me to First
[18:38] Corinthians in the second
[18:44] chapter and also was thinking after
[18:47] Wednesday night we all know that God is
[18:51] more than able to meet the need you just
[18:54] have to have the faith and Faith only
[18:56] comes by what does it say in Roman
[18:58] Romans 10:1 17 Faith only comes by
[19:02] hearing of the word of God plain and
[19:04] simple if you're putting your trust in
[19:06] anything other than the word of God
[19:08] there you know I I think of people that
[19:11] have that have no word or have no
[19:15] presence of God and how how do you have
[19:17] faith the believe or anything without
[19:19] the word of God and without the presence
[19:21] of Jesus Christ but I'll uh this second
[19:25] chapter
[19:27] here this morning I'll read read a few
[19:29] verses
[19:30] here and I Brethren when I came to you
[19:33] came not with the Excellency of speech
[19:35] or wisdom declaring unto you the
[19:38] testimony of God so Paul's U Paul's
[19:42] identifying something here he didn't
[19:44] come with his own ideas or his own ways
[19:47] or he came with God's ways God's ideas
[19:50] for I determined not to know anything
[19:52] among you say Jesus Christ and him
[19:55] crucified and I was with you in weakness
[19:58] and in fear and in much trembling so
[20:01] he's he's letting people know even
[20:04] though he's God's man for the day he's
[20:05] still a man he still has has emotions
[20:09] goes on to say and my speech and my
[20:12] preaching was not with enticing words of
[20:14] man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of
[20:17] the spirit and of power and this really
[20:21] important that your faith should not
[20:22] stand in the wisdom of man but in the
[20:25] power of God and it goes on to say here
[20:28] in the sixth verse how bet we speak
[20:31] wisdom among them that are perfect yet
[20:34] not the wisdom of this world nor the
[20:36] princes of this world that come to not
[20:39] but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[20:41] mystery even in the hidden wisdom which
[20:44] God ordained before the world unto our
[20:47] glory and he goes on to say here which
[20:50] none of the princes of the world knew
[20:52] for they have known they would not have
[20:54] sacrificed the Lord Of Glory but is it
[20:57] written I ha not seen and these are the
[21:00] scriptures these are the promises that
[21:01] we hold on to this morning eyes have not
[21:04] seen and ear have not heard neither have
[21:06] entered into the heart of man the things
[21:08] which God had prepared for them they
[21:10] love them so no matter what our
[21:12] situations this morning what do you have
[21:14] to be afraid of not to say that your
[21:16] enemy isn't trying to make you put
[21:19] circumstances on you to make you worry
[21:22] make you fear but really what do you
[21:24] have to worry about this morning if
[21:26] you've got the presence of Jesus Christ
[21:28] in your heart that's the real important
[21:30] thing this morning it's not a it's not a
[21:34] hopeful type of Salvation it's a
[21:37] Salvation where God has come deep in
[21:39] your heart and he's reconciled with you
[21:42] through the word of God your
[21:43] relationship with him if you have that
[21:46] this morning you no matter what happens
[21:48] you have nothing to fear and I'll just
[21:50] keep
[21:51] reading and I've lost my place seen or
[21:54] heard neither have they entered into the
[21:55] heart of man the things which God hath
[21:57] prepared for them that love him but God
[22:00] hath revealed them unto us by the spirit
[22:03] for the spirit searches all things yay
[22:05] the Deep things of God and I apologize
[22:08] I'm going to wind up reading this whole
[22:10] chapter and he goes on to say so that's
[22:12] the spirit of God searching those things
[22:15] out in our hearts and lives for what man
[22:17] knoweth the things of a for what man
[22:20] knoweth the things of man say the spirit
[22:22] of man which is in him so he's basically
[22:25] we know the things in the natural life
[22:27] because we're in the Natural Life
[22:30] basically even so the things of God
[22:32] knoweth no man but the spirit of God so
[22:35] without God's presence in your heart and
[22:37] life you're not going to know the things
[22:38] you need to know now we have received
[22:41] not the spirit of the world but the
[22:43] spirit which is of god and we might know
[22:46] the things which are freely given to us
[22:49] of God for which things also we speak
[22:52] not in Words which man's Wisdom teacheth
[22:55] but with the Holy Ghost teaches
[22:56] comparing spiritual things things with
[22:59] spiritual and that's a real brother
[23:01] brandom taught about this a lot
[23:03] everything you do in life has to come
[23:05] through the word of God and he goes on
[23:08] but the natural man receiveth not the
[23:10] things of the spirit of God for they are
[23:13] foolishness not to him neither can he
[23:15] know them because they are not they are
[23:18] spiritually discerned but he that is
[23:20] spiritual judges all things yet he
[23:23] himself is judged of no man for who we
[23:26] have known the mind of the Lord that
[23:28] that he may instruct I didn't read that
[23:31] for who hath known the mind of the Lord
[23:33] that that he may instruct him but we
[23:36] have the mind of Christ and that's where
[23:38] we're all at this morning I
[23:41] was I know I say this a lot but simply
[23:44] if without the presence of Jesus Christ
[23:46] in your heart and life you're not going
[23:48] to have the right mind to deal with that
[23:50] insane world that's out there this
[23:52] morning I it's so insane and so crazy
[23:55] out there I wouldn't even want to talk
[23:57] about it but it it is actually insane
[24:00] this morning and I was
[24:01] um you know I have an office full of
[24:04] things but I was thinking of what I was
[24:08] reading this quote here this
[24:10] morning and this is uh it comes out of
[24:13] the devotional in January
[24:17] 21st I might just finish with that this
[24:20] morning
[24:22] um trying to figure a good place to
[24:25] start here
[24:29] he brother brandom's talking here this
[24:31] is the last two paragraphs out of this
[24:32] quote it says when I first come among
[24:35] you your groups 10 years ago if you look
[24:39] it looked like a church but today it
[24:41] looks like the world and that this is
[24:44] several years ago so what when we think
[24:46] of our own lives what is it like today
[24:49] you know what you see in people's lives
[24:51] it's the truth something happened
[24:54] somewhere you got to wearing better
[24:56] clothes you got to making a little more
[24:58] money not that doing those things is bad
[25:01] you just made a sap out of you that's
[25:03] all no that's the truth that's right
[25:06] you're trying to act like the rest of
[25:08] the world today is a compromising time
[25:11] now when I think of this I think about
[25:13] the late 1950s and
[25:15] 1960s and you think of the technology
[25:18] that we have today that so easily can
[25:21] get you off the beaten path that's true
[25:24] you paint your steps red watch see if
[25:27] your neighbor don't paint his his steps
[25:28] readed sure if you wear a little round
[25:31] hat to church up with a little feather
[25:34] up in it watch all the women go to
[25:36] church with the little round hat and the
[25:38] feather up in it you know that's just
[25:40] how people are what I don't man or woman
[25:43] they like to copy each other that he I'm
[25:45] just paraphrasing here and all all of
[25:48] them want to look like one another and
[25:51] stopping at this per here you know it's
[25:54] human nature to want to be in the group
[25:57] but the thing you have to be concerned
[25:59] about with human nature about being in
[26:01] the group it's the group that you choose
[26:04] to be in that you have to watch if
[26:06] you're in a group that's leading you
[26:08] away from what you know is right then
[26:10] that's not the group you need to be in
[26:12] and my mind goes back to the first Psalm
[26:15] I mean you know that you wouldn't sit in
[26:18] the counsil of the ungodly or sit in the
[26:20] way of Sinners but it goes on it's a
[26:23] it's a matching time you know that's
[26:25] true it's a matching time amen now I'm
[26:28] going to tell you my brother I don't
[26:30] care whether
[26:32] you excuse me here but I don't care
[26:35] whether my shoes match my trousers or my
[26:38] trousers match my coat so basically it
[26:40] doesn't care what you look like what you
[26:42] sound like what state you are what
[26:45] whether you're in poverty or you're a
[26:47] billionaire it doesn't make a
[26:49] difference or trousers match you co I
[26:52] want my
[26:53] experience and you all know what he's
[26:55] about to to match God's Bible that's the
[26:58] matching time and it's always you know
[27:01] it's always been a matching time in the
[27:03] 1950s and in 2024 it's still a matching
[27:07] time if you want to if you want to match
[27:10] something match your experience that's
[27:12] why I read Paul that chapter in
[27:15] Corinthians match your experience
[27:17] against Paul amen that's what we need
[27:19] today it's a matching time with Paul's
[27:22] faith in the Bible that's our example
[27:25] right A M real matching time don't try
[27:28] try to match with your neighbor match
[27:30] some of the Saints of the Bible if
[27:32] you're a saint but when I read that I
[27:35] think in my own life you know there are
[27:37] plenty of good examp brother brandom's a
[27:39] good example most of all Jesus is a good
[27:42] example you got to be careful of the
[27:44] people you choose for example and a real
[27:48] Christian no matter who you choose to
[27:50] mimic or I'm not saying you should mimic
[27:54] the most important if you wind up
[27:56] following other men if they fall you're
[27:59] going to fall with them so the most
[28:01] important thing in life is that your
[28:03] example needs to be Jesus Christ in the
[28:06] word of God so no matter who you you
[28:08] know we all have people we respect but
[28:12] if they fall you're not going to be
[28:14] shaking because your trust and your
[28:16] foundation is not in men it's in the
[28:18] word of God and your own personal
[28:21] experience with the word of God and I'll
[28:23] finish what he had to say that's what we
[28:26] need today
[28:28] matching time with Paul's faith in the
[28:30] Bible that's our example right real
[28:32] matching time don't try to match with
[28:34] your neighbor match some saying of the
[28:37] Bible it's your Saint act like a saint
[28:39] walk like a saint dress like a saint man
[28:42] that's where the world is lacking right
[28:44] there talk like a saint pray like a
[28:46] saint believe like a saint dress like a
[28:49] saint be a be like a saint live a saint
[28:52] die like a saint go to heaven like a
[28:54] saint amen and
[28:56] that and I was just
[28:59] thinking all of us have a choice this
[29:03] morning I was going to read this one
[29:05] thing but
[29:06] I I don't want the stuff to fall down I
[29:09] was just thinking this morning as we
[29:12] whether we're young or old tall or small
[29:15] it don't make a difference we all have a
[29:18] choice this morning in this late hour
[29:20] that we live in who are we going to
[29:22] serve this morning who's going to be our
[29:24] post what is our post going to be tied
[29:26] to what is our God going to be this
[29:29] morning is it going to be the word of
[29:30] God and the message of the hour or are
[29:33] we going to be running after things that
[29:34] really don't matter this
[29:37] morning and you know after the prayer
[29:39] meeting on Wednesday I'm not going to
[29:41] read it but what brother brandom had to
[29:43] say in that healing thoughts book that
[29:46] first paragraph I know I read this a lot
[29:48] but it comes out of Ephesians the 4th
[29:50] chapter and I'm not going to re read
[29:53] that whole fourth chapter but any
[29:56] promise of God is yours this morning if
[29:57] you you have enough Faith to reach out
[29:59] for it and remember the one most
[30:02] important thing brother brandham talked
[30:04] about in that
[30:06] quote is no matter what is going on in
[30:09] your life however what how great
[30:13] decision or
[30:14] how always he always said to have a
[30:18] Gentle Spirit a loving Spirit a spirit's
[30:21] willing to reach out to people no matter
[30:23] what their circumstances that's the kind
[30:25] of spirit that God has for us that's
[30:28] what we should have for our brothers and
[30:29] sisters brother
[30:37] David amen let's stand if we could this
[30:43] morning appreciated that this morning
[30:45] and I I was he read that uh quote of
[30:50] brother
[30:50] brandom's uh about your socks or your

[42:32] one of the ones we're not so proud of
[42:35] but you know what Wednesday night I was
[42:37] never so proud to be part of a family of
[42:39] God as I was Wednesday night I
[42:43] was and I thought you know the devil
[42:45] come in and he thought he's going to
[42:47] Black our eyes but you know we stomped
[42:49] his head in Wednesday night and you know
[42:52] what we're not done
[42:54] stomping and we've got a ton of prayer

[56:34] certainly good to us thank you musicians
[56:36] and for your your songs and for the
[56:39] everything that's been said this morning
[56:40] so far and it uh it just seems like it's
[56:43] just all falling falling in place and
[56:46] when I feel scattered and in shambles
[56:48] it's it's just all falling in place so
[56:52] uh that just shows you we we're not in
[56:54] control so uh I do want to take a little
[56:57] thought this morning and just kind of
[56:59] continue with some faith building and
[57:01] and look at some some things in the word
[57:03] here and if you want to be turning into
[57:05] your Bibles you can turn into Genesis 22
[57:08] and it's kind of a gloomy day outside
[57:11] but the Sun's shining inside he's
[57:13] shining in my heart I'm thankful for
[57:16] that this
[57:19] morning I want you to listen to what
[57:20] brother brandham says here and he's
[57:22] reciting scripture and he's preaching
[57:24] and you'll know the the the service here
[57:27] but he says now I want you to remember
[57:29] thy seed shall possess the gates of his
[57:32] enemies yeah the seed shall possess he
[57:35] says now he's he's talking now of
[57:37] Abraham's seed and how do we become
[57:41] Abraham's
[57:42] seed and he says by being dead in
[57:47] Christ that's all you got to do by being
[57:50] dead in Christ he says in Galatians 3
[57:52] when we're dead in Christ we become
[57:54] Abraham's seed see we're dead to the
[57:57] things of this
[57:58] world and begin a new creature in Christ
[58:03] then the holy spirit that was in Christ
[58:06] is in us and that's what makes us
[58:09] Abraham's seed and that's what gives us
[58:12] you know what it gives us Abraham's
[58:16] Faith by being dead in Christ that makes
[58:19] you Abraham's seed and by being
[58:21] Abraham's seed that gives you Abraham's
[58:24] Faith so people say oh I I wouldn't
[58:27] believe in Divine Healing he said I was
[58:29] talking to a minister the other day and
[58:31] nothing against the man he's got a right
[58:33] to his own ideas he's an American same
[58:36] as we are but he said brother brandom I
[58:37] don't care if you could produce 10,000
[58:40] Miracles I still do not believe in
[58:47] healing listen what brother brandham
[58:49] said certainly not it wasn't for
[58:52] unbelievers
[59:00] it wasn't for unbelievers it was just
[59:02] for those who believe he says that's
[59:04] right it's not for the unbelievers it
[59:07] was only meant for believers and that's
[59:09] all the holy spirit is to them that
[59:12] believe Divine Healing is for those who
[59:15] believe not unbelievers it's
[59:19] Believers amen Genesis chapter 22 read
[59:23] this scripture here and it came to pass
[59:26] after these things that God did tempt
[59:28] Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he
[59:30] said behold here I am and he said take
[59:34] now thy son thine only son Isaac whom
[59:40] thou lovest and get thee into the land
[59:42] of Mori and offer him there for burnt
[59:45] offering unto one of the mountains which
[59:47] I will tell of thee so now right here I
[59:51] want you to notice here is where
[59:53] Abraham's Journey Begins
[59:57] follow God or follow my
[1:00:00] feelings do I follow God or I follow the
[1:00:03] way I feel do I follow what what the
[1:00:05] word says or do I follow what Satan
[1:00:09] says and Abraham rose up early in the
[1:00:12] morning and saddled his ass and took two
[1:00:14] young men with him and Isaac his son and
[1:00:16] clav the wood for the burnt offering and
[1:00:18] Rose up and went into the place of which
[1:00:21] God had told them now watch and then on
[1:00:24] the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes
[1:00:28] so here's a time
[1:00:29] frame on the third day now think about
[1:00:32] this on the third day this is a Time
[1:00:35] Abraham has now been watching for three
[1:00:37] days he's been dwelling he's been having
[1:00:40] times to to hear doubt he's been having
[1:00:42] time to have unbelief and fear are you
[1:00:46] with me for three days he sees the
[1:00:48] mountain a far off and he says it looks
[1:00:50] he lifts up his eyes and he
[1:00:52] sees the place that's AAR off for three
[1:00:56] days he's looking knowing what's about
[1:00:59] to
[1:01:01] happen are you with
[1:01:03] me but he says unto his young men I want
[1:01:06] you to abide here with the ass and I and
[1:01:08] the lad will go up yonder and
[1:01:14] worship
[1:01:17] worship God has asked him to sacrifice
[1:01:20] his one and only
[1:01:22] son and he's going up to a mountain that
[1:01:24] he's been dwelling on this this very
[1:01:26] situation for three
[1:01:28] days and he says I'm going to go up
[1:01:31] there and
[1:01:33] worship and we can't worship if we stump
[1:01:36] our big
[1:01:39] toe and he said and I and will come
[1:01:42] again to you and Abraham took the word
[1:01:45] the wood of the burnt offering and laid
[1:01:46] it upon Isaac his son and he took the
[1:01:49] fire and his hand and a knife and they
[1:01:51] went both of them together and Isaac
[1:01:54] spake unto Abraham his father this must
[1:01:57] have been the most hurtful hurtful
[1:01:59] words as he's dwelling on these thoughts
[1:02:02] that's going through his head and I and
[1:02:04] Isaac says to his father my father here
[1:02:07] I am my son he says behold the fire and
[1:02:10] the wood but where is the Lamb for the
[1:02:12] burnt
[1:02:13] offering you better be able to think
[1:02:15] quick right then
[1:02:17] Papa you better know where you stand
[1:02:20] right there that's right and Abraham
[1:02:22] looks at him and says my son God will
[1:02:26] provide
[1:02:28] himself a
[1:02:30] lamb he didn't say he's going to provide
[1:02:33] it for me but he's going to provide
[1:02:35] himself a lamb for a burnt offering so
[1:02:38] they both went to them went with them
[1:02:40] together and they came to the place
[1:02:42] which God had told him of and Abraham
[1:02:44] built an altar and laid wood in order
[1:02:47] and bound
[1:02:50] Isaac That's what Satan tries to do to
[1:02:52] us so many
[1:02:54] times oh you you think you're in the
[1:02:56] word of God I'll bind you you think the
[1:02:59] word of God's more powerful than me I'll
[1:03:00] bind you that's right you think you
[1:03:03] think you think you know more than I do
[1:03:05] and you and you you can stand upon the
[1:03:06] promises of God I'll bind
[1:03:09] you and now Isaac is bound his son and
[1:03:12] he laid on the altar upon the wood now
[1:03:16] Abraham stretched forth his hand took
[1:03:18] the knife to slay his
[1:03:22] son to slay you talk about obedience
[1:03:25] Amen to slay his son and the angel of
[1:03:28] the Lord called out from heaven and said
[1:03:31] Abraham Abraham he said here I
[1:03:34] am and he said lay not thy hand upon the
[1:03:37] lad neither do anything unto him for now
[1:03:41] I know that thou fearest
[1:03:43] God seeing that thou Hast not withheld
[1:03:46] thy son thy only son from
[1:03:53] me and Abraham lift up his eyes and
[1:03:56] looked can you imagine as he hears that
[1:03:59] voice and he bows down and think oh
[1:04:00] thank the Lord thank you Lord thank you
[1:04:03] Lord
[1:04:04] God and then as he raises up and looks
[1:04:06] into there's a ram caught in a Thicket
[1:04:09] and all along in his mind through all
[1:04:12] the doubts through all the unbelief
[1:04:13] through all the
[1:04:16] criticism
[1:04:17] criticism are you with me no doubt those
[1:04:20] guys that went with him thought man this
[1:04:21] man is crazy that's right but through
[1:04:25] all the doubt in the criticism and the
[1:04:26] unbelief now he sits there and he lived
[1:04:29] upon that word where it said God will
[1:04:31] provide
[1:04:33] himself a
[1:04:36] sacrifice and here's the ram called in
[1:04:39] the thicket and Abraham said the place
[1:04:41] now be called Jehovah Gyra as it is said
[1:04:44] to this day in the Mount of the Lord it
[1:04:46] shall be seen and the angel of the Lord
[1:04:49] C called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the
[1:04:51] second time and said by myself I have
[1:04:53] sworn sayeth the Lord for because thou H
[1:04:56] has done this thing and has not withheld
[1:04:59] thy son thy only son you see how he
[1:05:01] keeps stressing how important this was
[1:05:03] to
[1:05:07] Abraham in that I Will Bless in blessing
[1:05:11] I Will Bless thee in multiplying I will
[1:05:14] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[1:05:16] heaven and as the sand upon the
[1:05:19] seashore and thy seed shall possess the
[1:05:24] gates of his
[1:05:27] enemies let's just bow our heads

[1:05:40] we're here to hear from you we're here
[1:05:41] to hear from the word and because we
[1:05:43] draw our strength from the word we get
[1:05:45] our faith from the word we we get our
[1:05:47] overcoming power from the word and
[1:05:49] through the holy spirit that moves in
[1:05:50] our lives Lord so we just ask that you
[1:05:53] would come down and anoint us today
[1:05:54] anoint the speak

[1:05:58] and and take these these thoughts that
[1:05:59] you've placed on my heart to to be able
[1:06:01] to share them with the people Lord but
[1:06:03] and let the people be receptive this
[1:06:05] morning that it's a two-way
[1:06:07] communication Lord that they will be
[1:06:09] able to receive what you would have in
[1:06:10] store and each person's individual
[1:06:12] Challenge and struggle and and wherever

[1:06:35] of his enemies how many's got enemies
[1:06:38] I'm not talking about your neighbor or
[1:06:39] the banker or the I'm talking about
[1:06:42] Satan I'm talking about a demonic Force
[1:06:45] that's been placed upon you or placed at
[1:06:47] you and these are your enemies but the
[1:06:50] word tells us because we have the same
[1:06:52] Faith we've died to oursel we've died to
[1:06:55] the world and the word tells us that we
[1:06:57] have the same faith that Abraham St
[1:07:00] stood upon and thy seed I'm a Seed of
[1:07:03] Abraham so by being that I can possess
[1:07:06] the Gate of every enemy that comes to

[1:07:20] him and possess his
[1:07:22] Gates you know sometimes that's what we
[1:07:25] just need to do we just need to shut the
[1:07:26] gates of hell and S tell Satan just get
[1:07:30] back in there you have no rights to
[1:07:36] me
[1:07:37] so all of us at some point in our time
[1:07:40] have been on a on a
[1:07:42] journey we've been on a journey and and
[1:07:44] and a journey we know is traveling from
[1:07:46] one place to another and it usually
[1:07:49] takes a a pretty good while a long time
[1:07:51] to travel and this journey has a
[1:07:54] starting point and eventually it has an
[1:07:56] ending
[1:07:58] point but the adventure is what happens
[1:08:00] in
[1:08:03] between some of you know what I'm
[1:08:05] talking about you just went on a road
[1:08:06] trip with with your family and you think
[1:08:08] yeah there's a lot of Adventures go on
[1:08:09] in
[1:08:11] between but here we're talking about a
[1:08:13] journey a passage a progress from one
[1:08:16] stage to another and all of us can say
[1:08:19] this morning that life is a journey and
[1:08:21] and and we go from one stage in our life
[1:08:24] to another stage stage and then we start
[1:08:26] another portion into another stage into
[1:08:29] another
[1:08:31] stage but many
[1:08:34] times we forget about God and how he's
[1:08:37] involved in this journey of Our
[1:08:39] Lives you see brothers and sisters I
[1:08:41] want you to know this morning that in
[1:08:43] the good
[1:08:44] times God is there in the bad times God
[1:08:49] is there in the times of Sorrow God is
[1:08:52] there in the times of Health God is
[1:08:55] there you he never left
[1:08:58] Abraham he never left Abraham he never
[1:09:01] forsook Abraham he asked him to do
[1:09:03] something and Abraham was obedient to
[1:09:06] the word of God so that that's how
[1:09:09] important it is that we're obedient to
[1:09:10] the word of God and here he is on this
[1:09:15] journey as we go through this journey I
[1:09:18] want you to think about this as we think
[1:09:21] about Abraham and we just recited that
[1:09:23] story
[1:09:25] here is
[1:09:26] Abraham on this journey that he's going
[1:09:29] on up to this mountain to worship
[1:09:33] God and as we go through this
[1:09:36] journey our journey defines who we
[1:09:40] are your
[1:09:42] journey defines who you are how you
[1:09:46] react in a
[1:09:48] crisis it defines who you are the
[1:09:52] journey is what defines your character
[1:09:56] your journey tells people that's a real
[1:09:58] Christian that's a real believer they
[1:10:01] stand up the word that's a real man or
[1:10:03] woman of Faith that's a real Godly
[1:10:06] person based on your journey now if
[1:10:09] every time hardships come and every time
[1:10:11] situations arise you cow down and back
[1:10:15] away well that describes your character
[1:10:17] as well well they don't truly believe
[1:10:20] what they say they
[1:10:21] believe they don't truly stand on the
[1:10:24] word that they Proclaim
[1:10:26] that's right they don't really believe
[1:10:28] what they say they believe but on this
[1:10:30] journey it is the deciding factor of how
[1:10:33] how your journey goes so in continuing
[1:10:36] my thought on the King's Highway I'm
[1:10:37] going to speak this morning on going
[1:10:39] through the
[1:10:40] Journey going through the journey and
[1:10:43] the journey of life we have ups and we
[1:10:46] have
[1:10:49] downs we have
[1:10:52] highs and we have lows
[1:10:55] we have moments when we feel like there
[1:10:57] is nothing in the world that can defeat
[1:10:59] us and we have times when we feel like
[1:11:02] all the world and all of hell is stacked
[1:11:04] against us that's
[1:11:07] right it's a journey so I ask this
[1:11:11] question this morning how many of you
[1:11:12] are going through a journey hands all
[1:11:14] over the building each if you're living
[1:11:17] here you're breathing you're in a
[1:11:19] journey something is happening in your
[1:11:21] life and how are you reacting to it
[1:11:23] whether it's at school young young young
[1:11:25] people whether it's at your job whether
[1:11:27] it's in your marriage whether it's it's
[1:11:29] it's here at church whether it's a
[1:11:31] situation in your life whether it's a
[1:11:33] sickness whether it's a disease we're
[1:11:35] all in a
[1:11:37] journey amen that's
[1:11:45] exactly but the thing about a journey as
[1:11:48] an individual is your journey is
[1:11:50] different than this journey where you're
[1:11:52] at is different than where you're at
[1:11:55] what you're battling is is is
[1:11:57] completely different than what than what
[1:12:00] Gideon's
[1:12:01] battling Journeys are based upon
[1:12:05] individuals you see in this building
[1:12:07] right now there's people that are
[1:12:08] currently on the mountain
[1:12:11] top
[1:12:12] yeah and there's people that's
[1:12:14] absolutely walking through the
[1:12:18] valleys you say man how how how you
[1:12:20] preaching this after the kind of service
[1:12:21] we had on Wednesday because it's
[1:12:23] reality brother random said whenever you
[1:12:26] go and you get prayed for for healing
[1:12:27] you just better watch
[1:12:29] out yeah that's what he said he said
[1:12:31] because that makes Satan mad and Satan's
[1:12:33] going to try to come back and weasel his
[1:12:35] way back
[1:12:40] in so that's why we look at these things
[1:12:42] now I want you to watch what he says we
[1:12:44] find that in our Virtues Of Life
[1:12:46] everywhere you take to the pro and the
[1:12:48] con the law of average now we don't
[1:12:50] always live every day of our life in the
[1:12:52] wowy wowy Woos like Brother Jules
[1:12:54] preaches is doing no we can't live there
[1:12:57] you cannot live there you'll be in
[1:12:59] you'll be in an asylum somewhere if
[1:13:00] you're living day after day after day in
[1:13:02] the Wy wowy Woos so brother Brown says
[1:13:05] we take the law of average you have to
[1:13:07] have the night in order to to know how
[1:13:10] to appreciate the day and he says you
[1:13:13] have to have uh the the rain in order to
[1:13:16] appreciate the sunshine and you have to
[1:13:19] have the valley to appreciate the
[1:13:23] mountain you say I don't know why we we
[1:13:25] got to go through valleys so that you
[1:13:27] can appreciate what God is doing in your
[1:13:32] life that's exactly we look here and and
[1:13:36] we find Abraham and Sarah and we find
[1:13:39] Abraham and Sarah they after years had
[1:13:42] received this little
[1:13:43] one and he's now about the age of 12
[1:13:46] years old and and and he's taken or or
[1:13:49] it's requested that God by God that
[1:13:52] Abraham would take his only child up and
[1:13:54] sacrif acfic
[1:13:57] him that has one meaning to take his
[1:14:01] life and so he he he requests that he
[1:14:04] goes up there and sacrifices this very
[1:14:06] child that he promises and so God now
[1:14:09] ask Abraham who is it Abraham is it me
[1:14:13] or
[1:14:18] Isaac is it me or Isaac that you cling
[1:14:22] to is it me or Isaac that means more to
[1:14:26] you is it me or Isaac that that you want
[1:14:29] to please and you want to serve and that
[1:14:30] you want to love with all that's within
[1:14:32] you is it me or is it the blessings I
[1:14:34] gave
[1:14:37] you you see we get ourselves in that in
[1:14:40] that problem right there we sometimes
[1:14:42] get oursel in that little trap but
[1:14:44] Abraham the prophet said he did not
[1:14:46] disbelieve God for one minute he said he
[1:14:50] could not disbelieve God for one minute
[1:14:52] because for years 25 years he'd been
[1:14:55] promised a child and he said now here he
[1:14:58] was in a place that he was dead as good
[1:15:00] as dead Abraham was
[1:15:03] dead and he said the very male was
[1:15:06] inside of him was dead Sarah's womb
[1:15:11] dead and he said he knew that if God
[1:15:14] could give him a child one who was
[1:15:17] received as from one who came from the
[1:15:20] dead Isaac was was given to them as one
[1:15:24] who was given from the dead that's no
[1:15:26] different than than the raising of
[1:15:31] Lazarus and so so Abraham knew that if
[1:15:34] God could give him a child from his from
[1:15:36] his baren loins and from her baren womb
[1:15:39] he knew that he could he had seen God in
[1:15:41] action and he knew by his
[1:15:45] faithfulness and his obedience he was to
[1:15:48] God that he was going to take his son up
[1:15:51] there and do exactly what God
[1:15:55] had commanded
[1:15:56] him so he begins to load everything up
[1:15:59] and he goes up there and he's beginning
[1:16:01] to get up there and he's he's at the
[1:16:03] altar now and he's laid Isaac down on
[1:16:07] the Altar and he says my Lord you can
[1:16:09] imagine the conversation he must have
[1:16:11] had my God I don't understand why this
[1:16:14] is
[1:16:16] happening I love you with all my heart
[1:16:18] I've served you my entire life I've
[1:16:21] given my life to you Lord and now you're
[1:16:23] asking me to give my give my one and
[1:16:25] only
[1:16:26] child but I will do what you say
[1:16:30] God and as he begins to take on the the
[1:16:33] sacrifice here and he begins to raise
[1:16:35] his hand back in Abraham's
[1:16:39] faithfulness it was at the point of
[1:16:46] death when God answered the prayer it
[1:16:49] was at the point of death when it didn't
[1:16:52] seem like there was any way out and he
[1:16:53] was fixing to l
[1:16:55] this this uh this dagger right in
[1:16:57] through his son's heart it was then when
[1:17:00] God moved on the
[1:17:02] scene he's an ontime
[1:17:07] God this journey may be rough this
[1:17:10] journey may be hard this journey may be
[1:17:13] full of doubts and fears and unbelief
[1:17:15] and disbelief and
[1:17:18] heartaches but in the moment when you
[1:17:20] need it most at the point of despair
[1:17:26] God moves on the
[1:17:29] scene here's
[1:17:32] Abraham here's Abraham think about this
[1:17:34] journey here's Abraham three days
[1:17:37] journey says he lifted up his eyes and
[1:17:39] he sees the
[1:17:40] mountain here he is 75 to 100 miles the
[1:17:44] prophet said from
[1:17:47] civilization he said up there there was
[1:17:49] no grass there was no water there was
[1:17:53] nothing but rocks surround
[1:17:55] him can we say there was no life there
[1:17:59] this was a desert isolated burning hot
[1:18:03] Rocky Top no life
[1:18:07] mountain and the prophet says up there
[1:18:10] there could not have been a ram up
[1:18:12] there he said it was impossible for a
[1:18:15] ram to been up there because if it would
[1:18:16] have got up there by itself something
[1:18:18] would have killed it along the
[1:18:21] way but here he is away from
[1:18:25] civilization 75 to 100
[1:18:28] miles thinking on the
[1:18:31] situations you know that's when that's
[1:18:33] when the devil tries to whisper to you
[1:18:36] it ain't when you're at the family
[1:18:38] reunion no it's not when you're at at a
[1:18:41] get together or a ball game it's not
[1:18:42] it's not so much here in church you know
[1:18:44] he'll give you a little time here but
[1:18:46] it's when you go home it's when you're
[1:18:49] all alone it's when you're 75 miles away
[1:18:52] from civilization that those negative
[1:18:55] thoughts begin to run through your
[1:18:57] head that's when doubt begins to creep
[1:19:00] in that's when when those fear begins to
[1:19:03] creep in and every negative thought
[1:19:06] would come to him you know what he would
[1:19:10] say my Lord will provide himself a
[1:19:15] sacrifice this this Ram is up there and
[1:19:19] Abraham don't know it because this is a
[1:19:22] spoken word Ram of God
[1:19:27] and and brother brother Bram said that
[1:19:29] that that Ram that was up there he said
[1:19:31] that was the Lord Jesus Christ exactly
[1:19:33] in figurative speaking that's who it was
[1:19:36] the ram of God and he said that that
[1:19:39] that when Abraham was up there and that
[1:19:41] began to take place in him in complete
[1:19:44] obedience God tried that
[1:19:48] patriarch we don't like trying
[1:19:52] times we don't like trying times he says
[1:19:55] but he tried his
[1:19:57] servants he tried his servant and every
[1:20:00] Son of God has to come that way tried
[1:20:03] and chastened you see being tried is
[1:20:06] part of the
[1:20:08] journey being tried is what makes you
[1:20:10] who you
[1:20:12] are so God is trying him here and we
[1:20:16] look at this a are we going to accept
[1:20:19] the laws of
[1:20:21] Satan but you know Abraham sitting there
[1:20:23] he could have accepted did what Satan
[1:20:25] was
[1:20:26] saying but that's what happens with
[1:20:28] people that's where they fall away they
[1:20:30] don't stay right there obedient they're
[1:20:32] not willing to be
[1:20:34] tried you see when you're tried is when
[1:20:36] you got to stand on your two feet and
[1:20:38] say my god
[1:20:42] reigns when times are hard my god reigns
[1:20:46] my God provides when I'm sick my God
[1:20:48] heals but he said the problem is many
[1:20:51] fall away because they can't stand that
[1:20:53] trial so what are they doing they're
[1:20:56] instead of fighting for what God Said
[1:20:58] and for fighting what the word promises
[1:21:00] they're now accepting what Satan says
[1:21:03] they're listening to the
[1:21:06] negative how many times have you heard
[1:21:08] you're not going to make
[1:21:10] it yeah how many times have you heard
[1:21:12] your children don't stand a
[1:21:14] chance yeah yeah sure you have was that
[1:21:18] God talking to you no that wasn't God
[1:21:22] that was Satan now let me ask you how
[1:21:23] many of you has said okay I think that
[1:21:25] voice is right I'm just going to quit
[1:21:27] I'm just going to give up I'm going to
[1:21:28] turn around I'm going to walk away I'm
[1:21:29] not going to accept my healing I'm not
[1:21:31] going to accept what God will do for my
[1:21:32] children I'm not going to accept that
[1:21:34] I'm that I'm not going to make a Rapture
[1:21:36] how many of you did that don't you raise
[1:21:38] your hand we're going to talk if you
[1:21:42] do no you didn't do that why because
[1:21:45] you're standing on the infallible word
[1:21:47] of God that says no matter what Satan
[1:21:50] says the word says
[1:21:55] God was so pleased with Abraham and his
[1:21:58] obedience on his
[1:22:02] journey God knew he wasn't going to have
[1:22:04] to kill that that child God knew that he
[1:22:08] knows before the foundation of the world
[1:22:10] he knows where each and every one of us
[1:22:12] the battles that we're fighting today
[1:22:14] it's what are you going to do on the
[1:22:16] journey to get
[1:22:17] there we knew the outcome when I began
[1:22:20] to tell the story you knew Isaac wasn't
[1:22:22] going to die but have you thought about
[1:22:24] the journey it took for Abraham to get
[1:22:28] there you see when God spoke to him he's
[1:22:32] on that journey and God spoke to him
[1:22:34] what to do and said it's it's time for
[1:22:36] you Abraham to lay your Isaac down it's
[1:22:38] time for you to lay him down sacrifice
[1:22:40] your one and only give me your treasure
[1:22:43] child that's when the thoughts
[1:22:46] came it wasn't when he was rejoicing
[1:22:49] because he'd been given a child
[1:22:51] no it wasn't in the times of Rejoice
[1:22:53] that those NE negative thoughts came it
[1:22:56] was in the times when he said now give
[1:22:58] me
[1:22:59] back that's when the doubt came it's
[1:23:01] when he's Gathering the supplies for the
[1:23:04] to get to get to the end of the journey
[1:23:05] the wood the knife the people the the
[1:23:07] the mules or whatever it was going to
[1:23:09] pack that's when fear be to strike and
[1:23:11] the
[1:23:13] disbelief because he got no doubt began
[1:23:15] to think this is really
[1:23:17] happening this is really taking place in
[1:23:19] my life this is really something I'm
[1:23:21] fixing I have to go through
[1:23:24] and when he's looking at this mountain
[1:23:26] for three days off in a distance no
[1:23:28] doubt anxiety had to begin to
[1:23:30] build as he thinks about the Altar and
[1:23:34] he has to now explain to
[1:23:37] Isaac what's about to
[1:23:40] happen you see brothers and sisters when
[1:23:42] we're going through the Journey Through
[1:23:43] the battle through the trials through
[1:23:44] the valley through the desert
[1:23:47] places that's where the struggle
[1:23:50] is it's not when you get the big
[1:23:52] paycheck
[1:23:54] it's when you don't know if you got food
[1:23:56] to
[1:23:58] eat it's not when you when you when when
[1:24:01] you're healthy and everything's well
[1:24:02] it's when you're not not you you got the
[1:24:04] report that everything's not so
[1:24:06] good that's when the struggle starts but
[1:24:09] it's when those times is when we have to
[1:24:12] put aside the struggle and rely right
[1:24:15] back on to what the word
[1:24:18] says the word will carry you through the
[1:24:21] Journey the word is what carries you
[1:24:23] through the Journey Journey Abraham had
[1:24:25] to keep relying on the word God will
[1:24:28] provide a
[1:24:29] sacrifice God will provide a sacrifice
[1:24:32] well there's that mountain God will
[1:24:34] provide a sacrifice well I got firewood
[1:24:37] I've got a knife I got a slame God will
[1:24:39] provide a
[1:24:44] sacrifice listen what the prophet says
[1:24:46] before any Victory can be
[1:24:48] won there has to be great prices
[1:24:52] paid he says oh what prices sometimes
[1:24:56] they're very
[1:24:59] deep
[1:25:01] deep prices to be
[1:25:04] paid sometimes the the road the journey
[1:25:06] that we're on requires you to overcome
[1:25:08] some
[1:25:11] things it requires you to let go of some
[1:25:15] things young people it may require you
[1:25:17] to set aside some
[1:25:19] friends so-called
[1:25:22] friends it may require you to to when
[1:25:25] when the Pain's there it may require you
[1:25:27] to to hold on to something you never
[1:25:29] knew you
[1:25:30] had scars he says it'll take make great
[1:25:34] scars and tearing down but in order for
[1:25:38] you to have that mountain in order for
[1:25:40] you to have that mountain we've got to
[1:25:42] have that Valley he says before we can
[1:25:44] have the sunshine we've got to get the
[1:25:47] rain before we can have the light we've
[1:25:49] got to get the night before we can have
[1:25:52] right there had to be wrong
[1:25:55] and a and if you would have never known
[1:25:57] what wrong was how could you know what
[1:25:59] right
[1:26:00] was you know I don't know anybody that
[1:26:03] ever came to Christ
[1:26:08] perfect no cuz how could you ever know
[1:26:11] the saving power of God
[1:26:13] Almighty if you f if you thought that
[1:26:15] you done everything right that's why
[1:26:17] you're born in this world speaking lies
[1:26:19] because you got to know what it feels
[1:26:21] like to tell the truth when the truth
[1:26:22] hurts
[1:26:25] so there's a contrast that's taking
[1:26:27] place I want to look down another road
[1:26:30] here I'm going to turn to Daniel 1 if
[1:26:31] you want to follow
[1:26:37] along man I tell you as gloomy as it is
[1:26:39] outside it seems like a nighttime
[1:26:41] service in
[1:26:45] here Daniel chapter
[1:26:49] 1 in the third year of the
[1:26:52] reign of J hok ho J the king of Judah
[1:26:56] how about
[1:26:59] that came Nebuchadnezzar the king of
[1:27:02] Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it
[1:27:05] and the lord gave the king of Judah into
[1:27:08] his hand with part of the vessels of the
[1:27:10] house of God which he carried into the
[1:27:11] land of Shar to the house of his gods
[1:27:14] and he brought the vessels into the
[1:27:16] Treasure House of his God and the King
[1:27:19] spake to Ash panz the master of the Unix
[1:27:22] that he should bring certain children of
[1:27:25] Israel and of the king's seed are you
[1:27:27] with me the king seed and of the princes
[1:27:32] children in whom was no blemish but well
[1:27:35] favored and skillful in all wisdom and
[1:27:38] cunning of knowledge and understanding
[1:27:39] of Science and such boy I tell you
[1:27:41] that's describing something to
[1:27:45] me bring them to him and he says and
[1:27:48] he's just such as had ability in them to
[1:27:50] stand in the king's Palace and whom they
[1:27:52] might teach the learning and the tongue
[1:27:55] of the Cal the calans and the King
[1:27:58] appointed them a daily provision of the
[1:28:00] king's meat and of the wine which he
[1:28:02] drank so nourish them for three years do
[1:28:06] you see a time
[1:28:08] frame there's a journey
[1:28:10] beginning and I want to look at this
[1:28:12] this this little scripture today in
[1:28:14] probably a way that maybe most of us
[1:28:16] even myself included until about 2:00 in
[1:28:18] the morning didn't
[1:28:20] realize but here they're at the end of
[1:28:23] nurse them for three years that at the
[1:28:25] end thereof they may stand before the
[1:28:27] king so I want you to notice here these
[1:28:31] kids these kids here have been
[1:28:35] kidnapped these kids here have been
[1:28:37] brought into bondage they've been pulled
[1:28:40] into slavery this was the King's kids
[1:28:43] these were blameless faultless
[1:28:45] Christians Believers bride of Jesus
[1:28:48] Christ has been pulled in now and
[1:28:50] kidnapped for 3
[1:28:52] years and it says now among these were
[1:28:55] the of the children of Judah
[1:28:57] Daniel hananiah Michelle and
[1:29:02] azeri now I want you to watch what
[1:29:04] happens
[1:29:05] here unto whom the prince of the Unix
[1:29:08] gave names for he gave unto Daniel the
[1:29:10] name of belto
[1:29:12] shazar and he gave unto hananiah of
[1:29:15] Shadrach and he gave to Michelle of
[1:29:18] meach and of Azariah
[1:29:22] abedo I'm all right are you with me but
[1:29:27] I want you to watch here what the devil
[1:29:28] is doing he's taking these children of
[1:29:31] God these four young men of God and he's
[1:29:35] trying to change completely change their
[1:29:38] identity he's trying to change who they
[1:29:40] are and the devil thinks if he can get
[1:29:42] you to change the way you think the way
[1:29:44] you talk the way you act then he can
[1:29:47] change what God has done in your
[1:29:50] life but these four kids would not stand
[1:29:53] for
[1:29:56] such he's trying to tell them that
[1:29:58] you're not really a child of God you can
[1:30:01] tell that light of somebody else
[1:30:03] devil because I know who I am I know in
[1:30:07] whom I have
[1:30:09] believed I know who saved my soul I know
[1:30:12] who delivered me from the sin and the
[1:30:14] Wrath of the life I was
[1:30:19] living and here in Daniel it talks about
[1:30:21] these young men they're probably 15 to
[1:30:24] 20 years old thank you
[1:30:25] Carson probably 15 to 20 years old from
[1:30:28] No Doubt wealthy influential families
[1:30:31] think about it stable Noble backgrounds
[1:30:34] good-look intelligent young men but here
[1:30:37] they find themselves
[1:30:39] kidnapped they find themselves kidnapped
[1:30:41] and they've been taken from their homes
[1:30:43] their families they've been ripped from
[1:30:45] the culture and the Heritage that they
[1:30:47] know to go now and start being uh uh
[1:30:51] pushed upon them false Idols false gods
[1:30:53] false
[1:30:55] teachings music that was not
[1:30:57] inspirational of
[1:31:01] God and now this has been pushed upon
[1:31:04] them and a and as we look at this I want
[1:31:07] you to look at their names and I want
[1:31:08] you to watch how Satan does so
[1:31:12] hananiah his name his given name means
[1:31:16] the Lord shows
[1:31:20] Grace how'd you like that to be your
[1:31:23] name
[1:31:25] well this this this this Devil comes in
[1:31:28] and he changes his name to
[1:31:30] Shadrach this says that means command of
[1:31:33] Aku a Samaritan Moon
[1:31:38] God so he begins to strip what he is in
[1:31:41] his life he begins to strip his identity
[1:31:43] and compare him to a moon
[1:31:45] God you see that's the way Satan is he
[1:31:47] tries to belittle you he tries to take
[1:31:50] away what God's done in your life and
[1:31:52] belittle you oh you're nobody
[1:31:54] they can't use you at church people
[1:31:56] don't respect you people don't look at
[1:31:58] you you can never stand up and sing a
[1:32:01] song Let's just let's just call you
[1:32:07] failure devil ever told any of that to
[1:32:11] you
[1:32:13] Michelle his name means who is what God
[1:32:17] is I like that one I like people look at
[1:32:20] me and say that's exactly who God is
[1:32:22] right there
[1:32:24] he looks and acts and talks and smells
[1:32:26] just like
[1:32:28] God but they look at him and they said
[1:32:30] we're going to change your name to
[1:32:32] meach which means who is what aou is so
[1:32:37] now he's part of this Moon
[1:32:40] God how many times has Satan said that
[1:32:42] oh you're not good enough in the kingdom
[1:32:44] of God so just serve this serve this for
[1:32:47] a while serve cigarettes serve drugs
[1:32:50] serve alcohol serve pornography serve
[1:32:53] these things
[1:32:54] we're going to call you who is what aou
[1:32:58] is and here is Azariah the name means
[1:33:02] the Lord
[1:33:03] helps these were Godly children who had
[1:33:06] Godly names and godly bringing ups and
[1:33:09] now Satan looks at him and says we're
[1:33:10] going to call you abendigo the servant
[1:33:13] of Nebo another false
[1:33:15] god how many ever seen that in the word
[1:33:19] before you see we always think oh oh
[1:33:22] Shadrach Meshach and if we called
[1:33:24] them that they're not going to be
[1:33:26] happy when we get to the other side you
[1:33:28] better remember
[1:33:31] Michelle and
[1:33:33] Azariah you better remember them by
[1:33:35] those names because if you go say hey
[1:33:36] Shadrach they're not going to enjoy what
[1:33:39] you're calling
[1:33:41] them but that's the way we're taught as
[1:33:44] children that's the way we look at this
[1:33:45] but there was a there was something that
[1:33:46] was happening on the journey in these
[1:33:48] kids these young kids life Satan was
[1:33:51] coming in and trying to disarray the
[1:33:53] whole life and taking these young men
[1:33:55] and totally isolating them and
[1:33:57] separating them from what God was trying
[1:33:59] to do in their
[1:34:04] lives we look at these young
[1:34:07] men and think about the kind of
[1:34:09] dedication and commitment they had to
[1:34:11] make to a god at 15 to 20 years old been
[1:34:15] held
[1:34:17] captive and here Nebuchadnezzar builds a
[1:34:20] a 90ft 8 story tall Idol
[1:34:26] this huge Idol that's sitting there and
[1:34:28] it's been placed in front of them and
[1:34:29] says this is Nebo let everyone know that
[1:34:32] every knee will bow to Neo and when they
[1:34:36] hear the music bow to
[1:34:40] Neo and anybody that refuses will be
[1:34:45] incinerated you realize what that
[1:34:50] is that's burnt to death
[1:34:54] that's burnt to where you don't have any
[1:34:55] bones left that that that that's burnt
[1:34:58] to a place that you you you're not even
[1:35:00] recognizable by nothing more than some
[1:35:02] ash
[1:35:04] incinerated we call it a Crematory
[1:35:07] that's for the
[1:35:08] dead they're going to throw them in
[1:35:10] there alive if you don't worship this if
[1:35:13] you don't worship
[1:35:15] Nebo and so around about verse 12 and
[1:35:18] we're little reading down through this
[1:35:19] the king gets word that these three Jews
[1:35:22] these three Jewish boys are not obey
[1:35:25] him that they're not going to fall down
[1:35:27] at the feet of the Statue of
[1:35:31] Nebo and so they call them in there
[1:35:34] because these three had actually been
[1:35:37] handpicked did you see how God likes to
[1:35:40] shall we say throw it in the face of
[1:35:42] Satan they had been handpicked because
[1:35:44] they were so good they were so righteous
[1:35:46] they were so perfect they were so
[1:35:48] without flaw they never lied they never
[1:35:50] done anything against anything that they
[1:35:52] ever said they were just perfect perfect
[1:35:53] little three little boys
[1:35:56] teenagers and so they had been
[1:35:58] handpicked to do some work for the king
[1:36:01] and the King really didn't want to have
[1:36:02] to kill him but the decree said the
[1:36:05] decree was put out there that anybody
[1:36:07] that don't bow down is going to had to
[1:36:09] be incinerated so here are these three
[1:36:12] powerless youth trapped Now by a
[1:36:15] Commandment that says you got to serve
[1:36:17] our
[1:36:18] Gods let me tell you I'm not serving any
[1:36:20] gods of this
[1:36:22] world I'm not serving any of the idols
[1:36:25] of this
[1:36:27] world so here they are coming here to
[1:36:30] this fiery death now you think about
[1:36:32] this
[1:36:33] situation they could have rationalized
[1:36:36] the situation you know that's what a lot
[1:36:37] of times we try to do we try to
[1:36:40] rationalize the situation so they could
[1:36:43] have just said you know what this is
[1:36:44] just a pile of rocks some metal it's
[1:36:48] just it's just a statue and it isn't
[1:36:50] even a real God it's just it's just an
[1:36:52] idol and you know if we just bow down to
[1:36:56] it it would save our lives is that is
[1:36:57] that really such a bad thing it doesn't
[1:37:00] it make sense to live instead of die you
[1:37:04] see they begin to
[1:37:05] rationalize but what God what did God
[1:37:07] say don't bow before any graveen image
[1:37:10] don't bow before any other Idol don't B
[1:37:13] I'm I'm the Lord your God and I'm I'm
[1:37:15] who you serve and so they've been taught
[1:37:18] that from their youth but they begin to
[1:37:19] rationalize they could have compromised
[1:37:21] and said well we we'll just do this to
[1:37:23] save save our lives and and and if we do
[1:37:26] it we can just work harder we'll pray
[1:37:27] harder we'll give more to God God will
[1:37:29] be mindful of that knowing that we done
[1:37:31] it just to so that we could pour more
[1:37:33] back into him you know sometimes that's
[1:37:35] what we do God don't care if I miss
[1:37:37] church I I'll just come back I'll do
[1:37:39] this and I'll do that
[1:37:41] and
[1:37:47] compromise they didn't
[1:37:49] compromise Believers don't compromise
[1:37:52] that's right the word is the word and we
[1:37:54] stand upon the word and so here they
[1:37:57] come to a place they wasn't going to
[1:37:58] compromise so the next time the music
[1:38:01] started and and they begin to tell them
[1:38:03] to
[1:38:04] worship they said no you see because
[1:38:07] when we compromise it leads to the next
[1:38:10] big thing and it leads to the next big
[1:38:13] thing and when you compromise doubt
[1:38:15] begins to get manifested in a bigger way
[1:38:18] doubt manifests doubt unbelief manifests
[1:38:21] unbelief and it begins to grow
[1:38:25] so do you think these guys might have
[1:38:26] been nervous when they stood before the
[1:38:29] king well sure they
[1:38:32] were sure they were because they didn't
[1:38:34] know what what what what for sure was
[1:38:36] going to happen all they knew is that
[1:38:37] they were going to have to stand up on
[1:38:38] the word of God no matter what happens
[1:38:41] and the Bible tells us that Shadrach
[1:38:43] Meshach and Abednego answered to the
[1:38:45] king and said oh Nebuchadnezzar we are
[1:38:47] not careful to answer thee in this
[1:38:49] matter and they said if it be so our God
[1:38:53] whom we
[1:38:54] serve is able to Deliver Us From The
[1:38:57] Burning fiery
[1:39:00] furnace so now they're taking the word
[1:39:03] and throwing it back at the Devil you
[1:39:05] see why it's so important that we know
[1:39:07] the word that we can recall scripture
[1:39:10] when we need it then when we're in a
[1:39:12] time of trouble we can we can rely back
[1:39:14] on what we've been taught in the word
[1:39:16] because why we're kicking it back into
[1:39:18] Satan into his face and saying we stand
[1:39:20] on what God says not what you want he
[1:39:23] will
[1:39:25] deliver he'll Deliver us out of the
[1:39:27] fiery furnace and then he go a step
[1:39:29] further and says and he will deliver us
[1:39:31] out of thine hand oh
[1:39:37] King sometimes you got to stand Toe
[1:39:39] totoe with the
[1:39:43] devil you're not taking my health you're
[1:39:46] not taking my children you're not taking
[1:39:49] my family you're not taking my job
[1:39:53] standing Toe to Toe because why God will
[1:39:55] Deliver Us in these
[1:39:57] situations he says but if if it not be
[1:40:00] it known unto thee Oh King that we will
[1:40:03] not serve thy
[1:40:05] Gods we will not worship the golden
[1:40:08] image which thou Hast set
[1:40:16] up let me tell you they were they were
[1:40:18] familiar with the law of
[1:40:21] Moses you know we've been given some
[1:40:23] some particular things in our life too
[1:40:26] we've been given a
[1:40:27] message they had the law of Moses we got
[1:40:30] the message of the
[1:40:32] hour and the message of the hour began
[1:40:34] to reveal what the Scrolls were really
[1:40:37] saying so they stood up upon Moses We
[1:40:40] Stand upon the message they had these
[1:40:41] Godly Parents that instilled the love of
[1:40:43] God into them and the love of doing
[1:40:45] what's right and obeying God so they had
[1:40:48] all of
[1:40:49] that and here they are they're standing
[1:40:51] there with circum circum circumstances
[1:40:53] that are rising in their life and
[1:40:56] they're having to stand now on biblical
[1:40:59] principles and these biblical principles
[1:41:02] are what's guiding them so here they're
[1:41:05] standing on the word of God on this
[1:41:06] journey something else they're standing
[1:41:08] up is each
[1:41:10] other are you with
[1:41:15] me they had each
[1:41:17] other that's why it's so important that
[1:41:20] you forsake not the Assembly of
[1:41:21] yourselves even as the day grows closer
[1:41:23] sir why because they drew strength from
[1:41:26] each
[1:41:27] other hey Shadrach what do you think I
[1:41:29] don't know what do you think I don't
[1:41:30] know Michelle tell me what you think I
[1:41:32] think we stand on the word I like the
[1:41:34] way you
[1:41:36] think and we come together and that's
[1:41:38] what happened on last Wednesday night we
[1:41:40] came together and we brought our licks
[1:41:41] of fire we brought brought our our our
[1:41:44] what God had done in our lives and we
[1:41:45] pulled together for each
[1:41:49] other right and we stood upon the word
[1:41:52] of God we didn't didn't come up with
[1:41:53] something new we didn't try to come up
[1:41:55] with a new new serum or a new injection
[1:41:58] or an anoc
[1:41:59] anation we didn't need that all we need
[1:42:02] is the word of
[1:42:03] God the word of God will defeat Satan in
[1:42:07] any place anytime anywhere under any
[1:42:13] circumstance so what
[1:42:15] happens here is
[1:42:18] Nebuchadnezzar these three that he
[1:42:20] enjoyed so much now he has done built up
[1:42:22] a f of fire against
[1:42:25] them and that's the way Satan is you
[1:42:29] make him mad get
[1:42:31] ready before Wednesday night service I I
[1:42:34] I I text brother Ron Spencer I said

[1:42:48] mad and I said you know when you make
[1:42:50] him mad you got a battle on your

[1:42:57] battle and I said so please pray for
[1:43:01] us he said you don't fight

[1:43:12] family that goes around the world and
[1:43:14] around the world and around the
[1:43:16] world I got a phone call last night from
[1:43:19] brother Ted to ask how the situation was
[1:43:21] how's sister Donna's doing how's I said
[1:43:23] man we had a real meeting God really
[1:43:25] moved and he said well just let
[1:43:27] everybody know we're praying let
[1:43:29] everybody know Tucson's praying let
[1:43:31] everybody know Phoenix is praying let
[1:43:33] everybody know Dewey's
[1:43:38] praying he began to name preachers I
[1:43:41] never had even heard of he said they
[1:43:43] called me and said have you heard yeah
[1:43:45] we're praying about
[1:43:47] it they drew strength from each other
[1:43:50] but here now this Nebuchadnezzar full of
[1:43:53] Fury against these three and he says
[1:43:56] light it up seven times hotter you know
[1:44:00] that's the way the devil is when you're
[1:44:02] going through a trial you're going
[1:44:03] through a battle he just tries to pour
[1:44:05] the heat pour the heat pour the heat
[1:44:06] more gas more gas more
[1:44:10] gas I just say this the bigger the
[1:44:12] battle the bigger the
[1:44:14] victory the hotter the fire the bigger
[1:44:16] the victory is and so here these three
[1:44:19] come in here Shadrach Meshach and abedo
[1:44:22] and he begins to cast them into the
[1:44:23] furnace they bind them bind them with
[1:44:26] their coats and their hos and it says
[1:44:28] their hats and other garments and they
[1:44:30] bind them and wrap them
[1:44:34] up and it was exceeding hot it says that
[1:44:37] it was so hot that the fire slew the man
[1:44:40] that took Shadrach mesach and
[1:44:43] abedo they couldn't even come into the
[1:44:45] presence of the fire it was so hot and
[1:44:48] here comes these three bound children 15
[1:44:51] 20 years old and they're bound and
[1:44:54] they're pushed off into the furnace into
[1:44:55] the pit of the furnace and it says
[1:44:58] Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and he
[1:45:01] rose up can you imagine as he looked
[1:45:02] down in
[1:45:08] there what is
[1:45:10] that I would not be
[1:45:14] denied I would not be
[1:45:17] Deni till Jesus came they wasn't bound
[1:45:22] anymore no they were down there it says
[1:45:24] they were walking around I don't think
[1:45:25] they was walking I think they was
[1:45:27] dancing I think they was cutting a rug I
[1:45:29] think they was praising God for moving
[1:45:31] on the
[1:45:32] sea so much that they had a hold to the
[1:45:35] hand of God because Nebuchadnezzar said
[1:45:37] who is that Fourth Man in the fire it
[1:45:40] looks like God it looks like the God
[1:45:43] they're talking about who is that Fourth
[1:45:46] Man In The
[1:45:49] Fire we don't fight alone
[1:45:54] it looks like the Son of God come here
[1:45:56] and look at this can you imagine as they
[1:46:00] walk in there and all the princes and
[1:46:02] the governors and the captains and all
[1:46:03] the counselors they begin to gather
[1:46:06] around it's hot you you ever looked into
[1:46:09] a
[1:46:10] fire you think man I ain't going to have
[1:46:12] no
[1:46:14] eyebrows
[1:46:18] well and they look off into the
[1:46:21] fire and oh my
[1:46:24] goodness look at these three boys and
[1:46:28] this man that's with them look at them
[1:46:30] this fire Nebuchadnezzar the fire that
[1:46:32] you build has no power against
[1:46:35] them the devil's fire his breath of Fury
[1:46:38] cannot have any power against us and he
[1:46:42] says look at him there's no power not
[1:46:44] even a hair on their head are singed
[1:46:47] their clothes are not even scorched and
[1:46:50] they come out of there and it says that
[1:46:52] they didn't even smell like
[1:46:56] smoke you talk about an all powerful God
[1:47:00] now we knew the
[1:47:02] outcome but the journey was
[1:47:05] hard the journey is where they had to
[1:47:07] make their stand the journeys where they
[1:47:10] had to make their stand and say We'll
[1:47:11] bow before no Idols we believe that our
[1:47:14] God is the only God we listen to only
[1:47:16] Godly music they began to make the stand
[1:47:19] on their Journey going through the fire
[1:47:21] was easy
[1:47:23] are you with me when you're in the fire
[1:47:26] and God's there with you what's hard
[1:47:28] about that but it was the journey that
[1:47:31] built their character it was the journey
[1:47:33] that told it proved to God who they were
[1:47:36] you know Daniel went through the same
[1:47:37] kind of situation they looked at Daniel
[1:47:40] and and they they brought Daniel in
[1:47:42] there and and I believe it was Darius
[1:47:44] Daniel had been been given away at the
[1:47:46] age of 16 to Darius by
[1:47:50] Nebuchadnezzar and now at 80 years years
[1:47:54] old Daniel stands there you talking
[1:47:56] about a
[1:47:57] journey 16 to 80 y'all we got some
[1:48:00] mathematicians how many years is that
[1:48:02] Sarah put you on the spot it's not that
[1:48:05] wasn't good enough for God God said I
[1:48:08] want more out of you Daniel so he made
[1:48:10] Daniel so favored that the governor said
[1:48:13] Daniel I'm going to promote you from
[1:48:15] ambassador to ruler over the entire
[1:48:20] nation it's a journey yeah it's a
[1:48:24] journey and sometimes we don't know why
[1:48:25] we're doing or what what why this
[1:48:27] Journey's taking us where we're
[1:48:29] going but God looks down here at
[1:48:32] Daniel and and blesses him in this time
[1:48:35] of trial and but the people got so
[1:48:38] discouraged the other ambassadors the
[1:48:40] other the other uh politicians might we
[1:48:43] say they got jealous of what what NE
[1:48:46] what what Darius was going to do for
[1:48:48] Daniel they got jealous and so they
[1:48:50] wanted to set up something against him
[1:48:53] I'm I'm glad the politicians today don't
[1:48:55] do
[1:48:58] that I'm glad they just changed the
[1:49:01] position of power just graciously
[1:49:07] and but back in those days they were
[1:49:11] jealous and so they were jealous of what
[1:49:14] God had done to for Daniel and they
[1:49:16] begin to look at there and say how can
[1:49:17] we get him in trouble with the King
[1:49:23] well the king had already Saidi am King
[1:49:25] I Am Lord only serve me and these other
[1:49:30] dignitaries these these politicians they
[1:49:31] looked out there and they said you know
[1:49:33] what if we could just get Daniel to show
[1:49:36] himself in front of the king we got him
[1:49:39] because he prays every single
[1:49:43] day he devotes himself for hours every
[1:49:47] single day to pray to that God he's got
[1:49:55] they saidwell why don't we just have the
[1:49:56] king write a decree that no can pray to
[1:49:58] no other gods outside of our God so
[1:50:02] unbeknown only darus he begins to write
[1:50:04] and he begins to make this script and
[1:50:06] this this this pledge and it goes out
[1:50:07] and says nobody can pray to any other
[1:50:09] God and if you're caught it's into the
[1:50:12] lion's
[1:50:15] den 64 year Journey coming to a
[1:50:20] head captivity
[1:50:23] so he's sitting there now and he's he's
[1:50:25] going in here and he's beginning to look
[1:50:27] and and everybody knows how trustworthy
[1:50:29] is everybody knows he won't back away on
[1:50:31] what he wants to or what his God wants
[1:50:33] him to do everybody knows he will not
[1:50:35] cow down everybody knows that he's still
[1:50:37] going to serve his
[1:50:39] God no matter what they
[1:50:42] say so at the noon of the
[1:50:45] day you know what Daniel did it says he
[1:50:48] stood tall on his knees
[1:50:53] in the
[1:50:56] window for everybody to
[1:50:59] see he stood tall on his knees for
[1:51:02] everybody to see what he was about to
[1:51:06] do you are my Lord my god Jehovah you
[1:51:11] are the one who provided for a a
[1:51:14] sacrifice for Abraham can you imagine as
[1:51:16] he began to pour out himself and they
[1:51:18] look and said now watch look at him King
[1:51:21] look at him Darius look what he's doing
[1:51:23] he's bowing down and you know Darius
[1:51:26] tried every way possible not to not to
[1:51:29] put him into that Lin's Den he loved
[1:51:33] Daniel but he had been conjured into
[1:51:35] writing a
[1:51:36] decree so he brings Daniel up and he
[1:51:39] begins to talk to Daniel and he tells
[1:51:41] him the situation and they say you got
[1:51:44] no no choice Daniel we've got to throw
[1:51:46] you into the lion's
[1:51:48] den at sundown
[1:51:54] so they bring
[1:51:56] Daniel up to the to the threshold of the
[1:51:59] Lion's
[1:52:00] Den now can you
[1:52:02] imagine 80y old
[1:52:05] man fixing to be thrown into a a rocky
[1:52:10] pit because he loves his
[1:52:13] Lord and so right there they begin to
[1:52:15] look in there and they begin to go and
[1:52:17] they grab Daniel no
[1:52:20] resistance if this is what it it comes
[1:52:23] to my God will
[1:52:26] provide you know sometimes we we we we
[1:52:29] take we accept what people say or what
[1:52:30] people do the critics the doctors
[1:52:32] whatever we accept that and we just kind
[1:52:35] of stand there but not Daniel he said if
[1:52:37] if this is the Lord's
[1:52:41] will push me
[1:52:45] in and so they take Daniel and they
[1:52:47] begin to push him in but I want you to
[1:52:50] notice at the very instant the angel of
[1:52:52] the the Lord come down and says and shut
[1:52:54] the lion's
[1:52:58] mouth Time After Time After Time people
[1:53:00] have been put in and devoured before
[1:53:02] they even their bones even hit the floor
[1:53:05] of the pit Daniel an 80-year-old man
[1:53:09] pushed into a pit he should have been
[1:53:11] broken to
[1:53:14] Pieces but he's down there feeding the
[1:53:18] cats come here Felix
[1:53:25] yeah can you
[1:53:28] imagine you see great victories are
[1:53:31] won but it's how you get
[1:53:34] there brother brandham said great
[1:53:36] victories have been won he said I can
[1:53:38] remember the first world war as a little
[1:53:40] boy and I could hear the whistles
[1:53:42] blowing I could imagine we could hear
[1:53:44] whistles blowing when Daniel's in the
[1:53:45] Lions Den he said I could hear whistles
[1:53:48] blowing and and farmers in the field
[1:53:50] they stopped their horses they wav their
[1:53:51] hats they scre dream they hollered what
[1:53:53] had happened he said the war was finally
[1:53:57] over the victory had been
[1:54:00] won stay on the
[1:54:03] road no matter where your journey takes
[1:54:06] you stay on the road stay on the path if
[1:54:10] your journey takes you into to doing
[1:54:12] things that you wonder how in the world
[1:54:13] am I ever going to get through this stay
[1:54:16] on the path if it takes you down a road
[1:54:18] that when you say my goodness uh how how
[1:54:21] will I ever be able to go through this
[1:54:22] fiery furnace stay on the path when the
[1:54:25] lies are breathing down your neck stay
[1:54:28] on the
[1:54:31] path God's mindful of each of our
[1:54:34] situations God's mindful of what we're
[1:54:37] going through he knows what we're going
[1:54:39] through listen to this he says before
[1:54:41] any Victory can be won great prices must
[1:54:44] be paid but in order to conquer and to
[1:54:46] win the greatest battle that ever won
[1:54:49] one stepped out to Glory many years ago
[1:54:52] you see that battle's not
[1:54:55] ours how do I go through these things
[1:54:58] you want
[1:54:59] alone how do I how do I go through how
[1:55:02] did Daniel go through the Lion's Den how
[1:55:04] did Shadrach Meshach and abedo go
[1:55:05] through the fiery fire they wasn't alone
[1:55:09] he said he he did not come as some great
[1:55:12] person he said but he's going to I'm
[1:55:13] going to prove it didn't take muskets
[1:55:15] and bullets and atomic bombs it don't
[1:55:17] take those things to beat the
[1:55:20] devil he said it don't take those things
[1:55:23] but he clothed himself you want to know
[1:55:25] how he clothed in
[1:55:29] humility can you imagine those three
[1:55:31] Hebrew children walking in
[1:55:33] humility Daniel walking in
[1:55:37] humility it was the road they
[1:55:42] traveled Adam's race all in bondage they
[1:55:45] were without hope without god without a
[1:55:46] chance without Mercy without anything
[1:55:48] that could help them great enemies of
[1:55:51] the lower region of the Lost had them
[1:55:53] shut up in
[1:55:54] darkness there was no way
[1:55:57] out sometimes you going to feel that way
[1:55:59] on your
[1:56:01] journey that I'm shut out there's no way
[1:56:03] out that I'm shut in they've got me held
[1:56:05] down they've got me they got me held
[1:56:07] captain and there was no one that could
[1:56:08] help nothing could be done it looked
[1:56:10] like a total and complete
[1:56:13] loss but our
[1:56:16] hero didn't he have a way with words my
[1:56:20] hero give me my hand my my hero your
[1:56:24] hero he came down from the portals of
[1:56:27] Glory
[1:56:28] condescending on man to do a job where
[1:56:32] no other man on Earth could
[1:56:35] do that's my god let's stand to our
[1:56:46] feet thank you Lord one more quote as we
