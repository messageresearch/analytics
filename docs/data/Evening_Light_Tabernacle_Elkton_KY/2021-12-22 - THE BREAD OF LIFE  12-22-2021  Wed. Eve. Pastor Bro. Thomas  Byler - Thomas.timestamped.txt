[29:03] um
[29:05] let me see let's go to
[29:08] luke
[29:10] 2
[29:12] luke 2 we'll start with
[29:15] the christmas so to call christmas scene
[29:18] or the very first gift that god gave to
[29:21] man
[29:23] amen in luke 2 and we'll
[29:26] begin from 8 down to
[29:34] verse 14.
[29:36] and there were in the same country
[29:38] shepherds abiding in the field
[29:40] keeping much over their flock by night
[29:42] and lo the angels of the lord
[29:45] came upon them and the glory of the lord
[29:47] shone round about them and they were
[29:49] sore afraid
[29:50] and the angel said unto them fear not
[29:53] for behold i bring you good tidings of
[29:56] great joy
[29:57] which shall be to all people
[29:59] for unto you is born this day in the
[30:02] city of david as savior
[30:04] which is christ the lord
[30:06] and this shall be a sign unto you you
[30:08] shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling
[30:11] cloth
[30:12] lying in a manger
[30:14] and suddenly there was
[30:15] with the angel a multitude of the
[30:18] heavenly hosts praising god and saying
[30:21] glory to god in the highest and on earth
[30:23] peace
[30:24] and good will towers men may god at his
[30:27] blessings to the reading of the word you
[30:28] can be seated
[30:29] amen
[30:34] tonight we want to deal with
[30:38] uh why
[30:40] one of some of the reasons
[30:42] uh both of why people
[30:44] have rejected and have
[30:47] rejected this
[30:49] wonderful gift that god gave amen
[30:53] you know
[30:55] because truly that that's what they did
[30:57] how many knows
[30:59] and
[31:00] you know when i when i as a minister
[31:03] the more i look
[31:04] look at
[31:05] what people do with god
[31:09] and the way they treat him right
[31:12] the more pathetic
[31:14] it is
[31:15] the more it shows the patheticness
[31:18] of humanity
[31:20] right
[31:21] i mean it's really it's terrible
[31:24] now first of all i say and reject it you
[31:26] know let me i'll just read one scripture
[31:28] here
[31:30] uh
[31:32] in isaiah 53
[31:34] and 3 it says that he is despised
[31:38] and rejected of men
[31:41] right
[31:42] never said accept it now we know a few
[31:44] do right
[31:45] but in general it's pro the prophecy was
[31:48] that he was despised and that he was
[31:50] rejected of many men of sorrows and
[31:53] acquainted with grief
[31:54] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[31:57] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[32:02] amen surely he hath borne our griefs
[32:04] carried our sorrows
[32:06] yet we did esteem him stricken
[32:08] smitten of god and afflicted but he was
[32:11] wounded for our transgression he was
[32:12] bruised for our iniquities the
[32:14] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[32:16] and with his stripes
[32:18] we are healed now i'll get into that
[32:20] second
[32:22] part there
[32:24] amen
[32:25] uh verse 5 about being wounded and all
[32:28] but later but the part that i want to
[32:30] get to is first the rejection the
[32:32] rejection
[32:33] of this wonderful gift this first
[32:36] christmas gift that was ever gave to man
[32:38] the greatest gift that could have ever
[32:40] been given amen uh all of the heavenly
[32:44] hosts were singing and so forth but we
[32:46] find we know the story of how that mary
[32:48] and joseph went to pay taxes in their
[32:50] hometown and so forth and there was no
[32:52] room for him in the end right we all
[32:54] remember that story of how there was no
[32:56] more room you know and they had to go
[32:58] rent a stable right they go out into
[33:02] stable and
[33:05] put some straw down i don't know if they
[33:07] had to clean out all the manure first or
[33:09] not
[33:10] but they had to rent a stable and get
[33:12] waddling cloth with what they put around
[33:14] the ox and then the you know their their
[33:17] neck before that put their main thing on
[33:19] from the pool it's just some cloth i'm
[33:21] on the cloth like they have and he was
[33:23] wrapped in that amen so it was very a
[33:27] very very humble scene isn't that right
[33:30] it was god brought uh jesus christ to
[33:33] the world through humility amen and
[33:35] through a little
[33:37] uh a virgin mary they were not rich how
[33:40] many know joseph was a carpenter and
[33:41] neither one of them were wealthy they
[33:43] were considered poor people
[33:45] amen so there were some poor people
[33:47] there and and jesus born in a stable and
[33:50] so forth and and you know it just didn't
[33:53] look like what god was going to do when
[33:55] he was going to do the greatest thing he
[33:56] ever did
[33:58] i mean it was just so simple and so
[34:00] humble
[34:02] and that was one of the reasons that
[34:03] jesus christ was rejected was because it
[34:06] didn't come in pomp it didn't come in uh
[34:09] flashy things as brother brown said
[34:10] around christmas everything has to be
[34:12] sparkly everything has to be shiny
[34:14] everything has to be all of that he
[34:16] didn't come that way at all
[34:19] and then we see the end of jesus let's
[34:20] look at the end of jesus the end of
[34:22] jesus was that even his own disciples
[34:25] left him
[34:28] they even forsook him
[34:31] that right
[34:32] just about everybody forsook him he had
[34:35] nobody hardly on his side but me but
[34:36] maybe his mama going up beside him or
[34:39] going to calvary and still talking about
[34:41] it what has he ever done and so forth
[34:43] right but he was completely rejected the
[34:45] bible says in saint john sit down the
[34:47] first chapter and he came to his own and
[34:50] his own what
[34:52] received him not
[34:54] people now i want to look at that with
[34:56] the help of the lord amen now i'm going
[34:58] to try to do something this evening i
[35:01] want to
[35:02] start basically with a
[35:05] uh with a quote from brother branham he
[35:08] was preaching i believe it was on god's
[35:10] wrath gift listen he says this is now
[35:13] why
[35:14] was the reason they didn't receive this
[35:17] rap gift
[35:18] why what's the reason for it
[35:20] they knowed what was on the inside of it
[35:24] right
[35:25] and it didn't this is this key word that
[35:27] i want to go off of tonight they didn't
[35:30] want it
[35:33] they didn't want it
[35:36] now they knew what was inside of it they
[35:38] knew what he really was
[35:40] because nicodemus came
[35:42] to him at night and he was of the
[35:44] pharisees and what did he admit he just
[35:46] said we know that you're a man of god
[35:49] we know that you're of god because
[35:50] nobody could do these things unless he
[35:53] was of god
[35:58] but did they receive him even though
[36:00] they knew it was right they still didn't
[36:02] want it
[36:05] and that want is what i want to try to
[36:08] uh define a little bit
[36:12] the meaning of want
[36:15] all right the meaning of what to me
[36:17] now this is maybe not according to the
[36:19] dictionary but this is according to me
[36:22] is
[36:23] to desire
[36:28] right it's to once you desire something
[36:31] you
[36:32] even
[36:34] even thirst can be brought in because
[36:36] there's something that you just gotta
[36:38] have
[36:40] it's
[36:41] say something
[36:43] something not in your soul
[36:45] and you just got to have it
[36:47] you want it
[36:49] or you don't want it
[36:51] right
[36:53] so it's a desire
[36:55] so
[36:56] tonight i want to tell you that i
[36:57] believe the core problem with rejecting
[37:00] god is people's desire
[37:10] it's what they hunger for
[37:14] it's what they thirst for
[37:20] well when the lord started showing me
[37:21] this stuff i'm having a good time
[37:25] isn't that right
[37:27] they didn't want it they didn't want
[37:29] jesus one of the big reasons was because
[37:31] it did not come the way that they
[37:33] thought it ought to come
[37:36] folks how many knows that don't never
[37:38] get in your mind that this is how it
[37:40] ought to be
[37:43] when it comes to god you better come and
[37:44] find out how does he want it to be
[37:48] many times they thought the messiah
[37:50] would come down on the red carpet and
[37:52] god would say k ephesus here is my
[37:54] messiah he's going to deliver israel
[37:56] we're going to drive these romans out
[37:58] and we're going to have our own
[37:59] jerusalem and everything yet wasn't
[38:01] nothing like it
[38:03] not even close not even the red devils
[38:07] of what they thought it was going to be
[38:11] it came down so humble
[38:14] and when it did come it absolutely
[38:18] condemned them for the way that they
[38:20] were doing
[38:21] they sure didn't think that was going to
[38:22] happen
[38:24] but it didn't come their way
[38:27] not the way that they wanted it to come
[38:32] folks i'm telling you right now
[38:34] you know
[38:35] didn't brother bam say one place he said
[38:36] when you think you got the rapture all
[38:38] figured out just remember you're
[38:39] probably wrong
[38:42] huh
[38:43] so you got to have an open heart lord
[38:46] you pay for things sometimes let me tell
[38:48] you this sometimes you'll pray for
[38:50] things and i believe god hears you and i
[38:52] believe god answers you but it don't
[38:54] come the way that you think it does a
[38:56] lot of times
[38:57] it don't happen the way that you want it
[38:59] to
[39:02] and you got to be open say lord it
[39:03] doesn't happen
[39:05] well it just comes to my mind and now
[39:07] what it says not my will be done but
[39:09] dying
[39:12] not doing it i want it but let your way
[39:14] be done let your desire be done
[39:19] the whole problem of the
[39:21] whole world is that word want
[39:24] it's what they want
[39:29] because people are going to do
[39:31] what they want
[39:35] isn't that right
[39:36] people are going to do what they desire
[39:40] fire
[39:45] you're saved you are sealed and saved
[39:49] for all of eternity you cannot be lost
[39:51] if you're really saved
[39:54] huh
[39:55] because you're not really saved if
[39:57] there's a if
[40:03] huh
[40:04] no you're not really saved maybe you
[40:05] might be
[40:07] but if you're saved
[40:08] period
[40:10] he believed that i could you know that
[40:12] i'm saying for time that man i would go
[40:14] paint the town red i would go have me a
[40:16] time
[40:19] i see it shows what he
[40:22] really wanted
[40:34] and it wasn't right
[40:36] his desires change
[40:40] because that's what it's all about
[40:42] if you don't love god from your heart if
[40:44] that desire isn't down there then do it
[40:47] in vain anyway
[40:49] there's millions out there doing it in
[40:51] vain
[40:56] i wanted to establish i won't go into it
[40:57] but i want to establish you the fact
[40:59] that jesus said one place he says when i
[41:01] come back to earth will i even find
[41:02] anybody
[41:04] that has faith that loves me that wants
[41:07] to serve me that wants to accept me
[41:09] that wants me
[41:12] i mean they don't want him but how many
[41:13] knows we want him
[41:16] it's about your desire about what you
[41:18] want
[41:20] praise be to god
[41:22] and then that brought me to another
[41:24] thought was that uh
[41:26] uh
[41:28] you know
[41:29] the prophet god he says you know boy
[41:31] they'd go drinking and and everything
[41:33] else and somebody asked the question i
[41:35] believe it was brother can a person
[41:36] drink or can a person do this you know
[41:38] if they're christian you know and
[41:40] you know he says when you're saved you
[41:42] can do whatever you want
[41:48] he says you know if you'll just get
[41:50] first saved then do what you want
[41:53] first get saved you'll do the right
[41:55] thing you'll want the right thing
[42:00] yeah amen even he brought it to god said
[42:01] he says you know i've drank all the beer
[42:04] i want in the last you know
[42:06] i've gotten to drink it all i smoked all
[42:08] i want i smoked all the pot i want
[42:11] [Music]
[42:13] i did all the crack i want today
[42:17] and it's zero
[42:19] right
[42:21] why because of desire
[42:24] they want to
[42:26] they didn't want it
[42:28] [Music]
[42:29] i believe the uh
[42:30] johns brothers had a song they don't
[42:32] want him then they didn't want him now
[42:34] they didn't want him then
[42:36] they don't want it
[42:38] because they got the wrong desire
[42:41] the wrong passion
[42:44] amen
[42:47] oh my
[42:50] you know
[42:51] i believe another place he says you know
[42:52] i've been getting drunk for the last
[42:54] as long as he's been saved
[42:56] ever since i've gotten the holy ghost
[42:58] i've been getting drunk
[43:01] yeah drunk on what the spirit
[43:05] it just makes me feel real good come on
[43:07] folks it really does
[43:09] you think i act funny oh my
[43:12] when the day of pentecost happened and
[43:14] they come up out of the room
[43:21] it said they staggered like a bunch of
[43:23] drunk men
[43:25] they got so full of the holy ghost they
[43:26] staying in the rounds like them
[43:31] huh how many believe we could have some
[43:33] more though goes we should want more of
[43:35] the holy how many brother bran's
[43:36] revivals all those early 1900s
[43:40] you know the preacher wouldn't even come
[43:41] out yet and people be healed everybody
[43:43] got healed because they come expect me
[43:46] people stay all night why
[43:48] they got choked from the holy ghost they
[43:50] forgot it was nine o'clock they forgot
[43:51] it was 10 o'clock they forgot it was 11
[43:53] o'clock now they just got such a happy
[43:56] time they got so full of the spirit they
[43:58] got drunk in the spirit
[44:01] i've heard them at church where folks
[44:02] you got me ahead in the end of the
[44:03] service the young folks and everyone was
[44:06] out there climbing trees i heard
[44:12] now the lord was just praising god and
[44:14] the lord was just i mean he was just
[44:16] rejoicing in their praise and angels all
[44:18] everywhere
[44:20] huh
[44:23] but
[44:24] anyway
[44:27] so the question is
[44:30] what do you want
[44:33] what do you want
[44:42] a little bit let's go back and look at
[44:43] something
[44:44] how many knows that jesus it's a pearl
[44:46] of great price
[44:48] he's like a diamond probably god said
[44:50] this in in his message he talked about
[44:52] called jesus like a diamond
[44:54] all right jesus is like a diamond
[44:56] now you just take a diamond out of the
[44:58] mines
[44:59] and it doesn't look very much
[45:02] i think brother brad preached
[45:04] a days ago
[45:06] but about a diamond it has to be cut
[45:09] right
[45:10] it has to be cut
[45:13] a certain way you gotta have something
[45:15] very sharp to cut it it got to be cut
[45:18] just right and why the little it'll
[45:20] reflect the glory of what's on the
[45:23] inside of it when light strikes it it
[45:25] makes all kinds of beautiful colors
[45:29] it's supposed to impress the ladies
[45:32] huh
[45:34] that's why we get our wife a wedding
[45:36] ring a diamond ring right
[45:39] oh wow it's expensive it's beautiful
[45:44] yeah
[45:46] and it's beautiful why but it's cut and
[45:49] it reflects something
[45:51] and you know even though listen
[45:54] jesus was taken out of the earth so to
[45:56] speak and he was cut on isn't that right
[46:00] he was bruised
[46:07] he was wounded
[46:09] cut
[46:11] cut deep
[46:13] but what did he bring out
[46:16] a beautiful reflection
[46:21] he was wounded
[46:23] he was killed for what
[46:29] my transgressions
[46:32] oh my that horrible bloody cuts that put
[46:35] upon him the stripes he put on his back
[46:38] amen and
[46:39] the bruise of the side of the
[46:42] spear that went in his side and cut him
[46:44] open
[46:45] brought forth a beautiful thing
[46:48] called the forgiveness of your sins
[46:53] it you know
[46:57] brother sean
[46:58] listen it made look at all the people
[47:00] that made smile
[47:02] and why i'm happy because my sins are
[47:04] gone
[47:06] they're underneath the blood on the
[47:08] cross of calvary
[47:10] made beautiful songs from it
[47:13] oh my he was bruised for our iniquities
[47:18] what is iniquity stuff that you know
[47:21] that you shouldn't do and you still do
[47:22] it
[47:25] how many would not be here anymore if it
[47:28] wasn't grace in the times of times when
[47:31] you
[47:32] knew you shouldn't you still did
[47:35] huh
[47:37] nobody would be here
[47:39] if it wasn't for his grace for your
[47:40] iniquities
[47:43] huh that's right
[47:45] so it's another beautiful chisel
[47:47] another beautiful chop
[47:50] another beauty something that looks so
[47:52] hard but yet it was so beautiful
[47:54] it's a gym
[47:57] it's the most treasured thing that we
[47:59] have isn't it
[48:00] it's like that diamond because of his
[48:02] wound because of his bruising for our
[48:04] iniquity
[48:06] amen
[48:08] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[48:10] him and with his stripes
[48:14] hallelujah
[48:15] when they put those
[48:18] lights on his back
[48:21] it was for
[48:23] healing you never overcome cold but when
[48:26] the first sickness comes along you'd be
[48:28] dead
[48:30] amen
[48:31] and his stripes were for our healing
[48:35] aren't you glad for that
[48:37] amen i'm so glad
[48:39] and yet people
[48:41] don't want it
[48:45] they just don't
[48:46] want the greatest treasure there is
[48:51] why is it
[48:52] one reason i said of course sunday
[48:55] is because their own the works are dark
[48:57] evil
[49:00] this is the condemnation
[49:02] because men love darkness rather than
[49:04] life
[49:08] they know there's a price that comes
[49:10] with it
[49:11] they know it'll do something for you
[49:14] it'll change you
[49:21] oh my
[49:22] how many wives try to change their
[49:24] husband
[49:26] how many husbands try to change their
[49:28] wives
[49:30] does it work
[49:33] we got quite a few honest folks here
[49:35] tonight
[49:39] no
[49:40] no
[49:40] it don't work
[49:42] oh my
[49:44] me and my wife was having just a little
[49:46] counseling and i i you know
[49:48] you know at the truck
[49:50] and he says honey i'll try to do better
[49:51] on that
[49:54] you know it's a simple thing like maybe
[49:55] not fellowship as much as what i've said
[49:58] and i'd like for you to talk to me more
[49:59] okay honey i'll try to make sure i do
[50:01] that
[50:02] you know
[50:04] but will i do it
[50:05] most likely not unless i just get closer
[50:07] to the lord
[50:10] because then you'll want to please the
[50:11] lord and you want to please your wife
[50:14] but let me know there's only one
[50:15] changing power
[50:17] i mean there's only one thing that
[50:19] changes there's only one thing that
[50:20] would change these people and that is
[50:23] the power of the holy ghost
[50:28] see in order to have a different desire
[50:30] you have to have a different spirit
[50:34] how many knows when you get a serial
[50:36] killer spirit it's a spirit that's
[50:39] on
[50:41] them
[50:42] they'll do it again and again they have
[50:44] to get rid of that spirit any kind of
[50:46] spirit i don't care
[50:49] so that it'll change what you want
[50:53] because jesus confirmed this message
[50:56] tonight when he said that wherever your
[50:59] treasure is
[51:01] that's where your heart is going to be
[51:03] that's where you want to be
[51:06] that's what you'll want to do
[51:13] what you thirst for
[51:16] what you long for what you love to do
[51:19] [Music]
[51:20] what did brother bam say you gotta call
[51:22] yourself a christian
[51:24] go to a man's garage he said with all
[51:26] kinds of pictures and stuff that ought
[51:28] to be up there right
[51:30] well he's just ruined his testimony
[51:35] and they're right
[51:36] because his actions
[51:38] can speak louder than his words
[51:41] but you get the holy ghost you rip them
[51:43] things right down
[51:46] right
[51:47] what you eat on what you feed on every
[51:50] day
[51:51] oh my
[51:53] now let's get to our message and i'll
[51:55] give you my title is that okay
[51:58] this is
[52:01] i saw that
[52:02] bread of life
[52:05] amen
[52:06] your fathers did eat man in the
[52:08] wilderness and are dead
[52:10] this is the bread which cometh down from
[52:12] heaven that if any man eat thereof and
[52:14] die not
[52:15] i am the living bread
[52:18] praise be to the lord i miss glad for
[52:20] that
[52:22] which came down from heaven if any man
[52:24] eat of this bread he shall live forever
[52:27] and the bread that i give him is my
[52:30] flesh which i will give for the life of
[52:32] the world
[52:33] the jews therefore strove amongst
[52:35] themselves saying how can this man give
[52:37] us his flesh to eat
[52:40] then jesus said unto them barely barely
[52:42] i say unto you
[52:44] step you eat the flesh of the son of man
[52:48] and
[52:49] drink his blood you have
[52:51] no life in you
[52:55] who so eateth my flesh and drink with my
[52:57] blood
[53:00] and my blood is drink indeed
[53:03] now understand he was saying something
[53:05] to them that they did not understand
[53:09] what do you do when you come across the
[53:11] word of god where you
[53:13] just don't understand it
[53:15] do
[53:16] you say well that that ain't right
[53:20] if you say that ain't right
[53:25] the word of god is true
[53:28] you just let it rest well maybe god will
[53:30] show me one day
[53:32] i don't understand it
[53:37] but unfortunately too many people just
[53:38] think it ain't right
[53:40] that's why they explain the way
[53:41] predestination and foreknowledge and all
[53:43] those things because
[53:46] it's it it is
[53:49] it has a way
[53:51] of trying to not want to fit into here
[53:55] but no that's not how it works
[53:57] he made the choice
[53:59] long before you ever thought of making a
[54:01] choice
[54:02] before the foundation of the world
[54:04] amen because he saw what was in you he
[54:07] knew what you would do
[54:10] oh my this is fixing to get good
[54:14] all right
[54:16] my flesh is
[54:18] meat and deed and my blood is drink
[54:19] indeed he that eats my flesh and
[54:21] drinketh my blood dwell often me and i
[54:23] in him
[54:25] as the living father has sent me and i
[54:28] live by the father so he to he that
[54:30] eateth me
[54:31] even he shall live by me
[54:35] let me ask you something what does the
[54:37] holy ghost feed on
[54:39] only one thing
[54:41] that's the word of god
[54:42] the holy ghost cares only about this
[54:45] word
[54:46] that's what it feeds on
[54:49] and let me tell you something this is
[54:51] jesus
[54:52] in the beginning was the word the word
[54:54] was with god and the word was god
[54:57] and the word was made flesh
[54:59] this is jesus when you feed on this
[55:02] you're feeding on him
[55:04] now unfortunately this is the whole
[55:06] thought tonight is people don't like to
[55:08] feed on this
[55:10] they like to feed on some man
[55:14] made doctrine
[55:15] jesus says you teach for doctrines to
[55:17] what
[55:19] the commandments of men
[55:22] and they liked it
[55:26] came to accepting the word they couldn't
[55:28] do it
[55:30] let me go further here
[55:34] and this is the bread which came down
[55:36] from heaven
[55:38] not as your fathers did eat man and are
[55:40] dead he
[55:41] that
[55:43] this bread shall live for
[55:46] ever
[55:46] now remember he said i am the living
[55:49] bread
[55:51] that's what our subject is the living
[55:52] bread
[55:54] he is the living bread
[55:58] a believer
[55:59] has a taste he wants
[56:03] more
[56:04] of the living bread
[56:10] i don't know if i ever do you can you
[56:12] can judge
[56:13] but do you ever hear me give some of my
[56:15] own ideas up here
[56:17] my own thoughts
[56:19] times when you have to say well i think
[56:21] that's just brother byler's idea
[56:24] you know you might because i'm human
[56:26] most of the time if i do that i try to
[56:28] say look this is my idea like paul said
[56:30] this is not me but the spirit
[56:32] but i guarantee you if i do that
[56:35] you
[56:36] no doubt will pick that up and say well
[56:39] i'm not so sure about that
[56:42] all right
[56:46] well you don't have to be honest with
[56:47] you i do that with preachers folk i'm
[56:49] back there brother brad and i'm
[56:51] listening about preachers behind my pope
[56:52] but now i want to try to make sure
[56:54] they're giving the right stuff out so
[56:55] yeah i'm always is that right or not is
[56:58] that right is that right you know
[57:02] you know and sometimes i'm like we'll
[57:04] just take it that was a take that with a
[57:06] grain of salt that might have been a
[57:07] bone we'll spit that out i like the rest
[57:08] of it you know
[57:10] i'm gonna throw the preacher out but
[57:12] sometimes i don't quite understand
[57:14] and then i just leave that alone
[57:16] but a believer loves the word of god
[57:21] and you know when you're reading the
[57:22] word you are absolutely reading it 100
[57:24] right amen
[57:28] all right now let's go on
[57:36] many therefore his disciples this is in
[57:39] verse 60.
[57:42] when they heard this said this is a hard
[57:45] saying who can hear it
[57:48] when jesus knew in himself that his
[57:49] disciples disciples murmured about it
[57:53] he said unto them does this offend you
[57:56] why don't you shall see the son of man
[57:58] and send up from where he was before
[58:01] and that really
[58:02] really stumbled some of the pharisees
[58:05] because they said what he means to stand
[58:06] up from where he was before we know mary
[58:08] and we know joseph we know where he come
[58:10] from he didn't come from above
[58:13] you know
[58:14] and he's saying he came from above
[58:17] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[58:18] flesh prophet of little or nothing the
[58:21] words that i speak unto you they are
[58:22] spirit and they are life
[58:24] but there are some of you that believe
[58:25] not for jesus knew from the beginning
[58:27] who
[58:28] who would be
[58:30] who they were who believed not and who
[58:31] should betray dream and he said
[58:34] therefore said i unto you that no man
[58:36] can come unto me except it were given
[58:39] unto him
[58:40] of my father
[58:43] we could stay all night on that one
[58:49] blessed are they which hunger and thirst
[58:53] after righteousness
[58:55] for they should be filled
[58:57] who do you think put that hunger in
[58:59] there
[59:01] who do you think put that i want that in
[59:03] there
[59:07] amen
[59:08] because you could just as easy as have
[59:10] i don't want no no
[59:13] part of that
[59:15] holy holy
[59:16] fanaticism and all the other stuff that
[59:19] people
[59:20] call it
[59:21] okay except that we're giving them to
[59:23] him of my father from that time maybe
[59:27] for 70 there was a big old group that
[59:29] all walked away
[59:33] there was another time whenever i think
[59:35] it was before this i should we go back
[59:36] but listen it may have been just before
[59:38] this but one place he says you know why
[59:40] have you come out here you didn't come
[59:42] out here to hear the word but you came
[59:44] out here and you are here for one reason
[59:47] and it's not for the spiritual food but
[59:49] it is for the loaves and the fishes
[59:52] some people were just following jesus
[59:54] for the
[59:56] blessings of the
[59:57] benefits of the blessing
[1:00:02] but following jesus is much more than
[1:00:03] that
[1:00:05] amen
[1:00:08] so many of them
[1:00:10] walk back
[1:00:12] no more with him
[1:00:14] amen and then said jesus unto the twelve
[1:00:17] will you also go
[1:00:22] will you all
[1:00:23] also go
[1:00:26] then simon peter answered him now notice
[1:00:28] the disciples were kind of
[1:00:32] many therefore
[1:00:34] of his disciples
[1:00:36] wait a minute verse 61 and when jesus
[1:00:38] knew that in himself that his disciples
[1:00:40] murmured at it he said unto them
[1:00:44] now then said jesus
[1:00:46] is unto them will you also go simon
[1:00:48] peter's answer and says lo lord to whom
[1:00:51] shall we go
[1:00:53] thou has the words of eternal life and
[1:00:55] we believe that and are sure i like that
[1:01:00] and are sure that thou art the christ
[1:01:02] the son of the living god
[1:01:04] he said the right thing
[1:01:07] he believed the right thing he had
[1:01:09] been given something how many know
[1:01:12] of the father to believe with
[1:01:16] that desire
[1:01:17] that want
[1:01:22] folks if you didn't want to come to
[1:01:23] church tonight you wouldn't be here
[1:01:26] people don't want to go to church that's
[1:01:28] why they're not here
[1:01:31] people don't want to praise the lord
[1:01:33] so they know
[1:01:36] people don't want to serve god so they
[1:01:38] know
[1:01:41] people want to live haphazard so they do
[1:01:43] they want to think their own thoughts go
[1:01:45] their own way dude go ahead
[1:01:48] it's only the
[1:01:50] grace of god that gives you the desire
[1:01:51] to want to feel
[1:01:53] follow him all the way
[1:01:55] amen because jesus wasn't he wanted if
[1:01:57] you want to follow him
[1:01:59] i'll go with him through the garden and
[1:02:01] then take up your course and follow him
[1:02:04] hate your very own life i don't want
[1:02:05] anything else but christ
[1:02:08] paul for paul for me to live is christ
[1:02:11] today's game
[1:02:13] it was everything to him
[1:02:18] amen
[1:02:23] oh my
[1:02:25] let's talk about that one
[1:02:28] aren't you thankful for that one
[1:02:34] quote but abandonment may i stop here
[1:02:36] just a minute
[1:02:38] and i realize i'm facing clergymen and
[1:02:40] smart men
[1:02:41] that i ran many times with the eighth
[1:02:42] grade education would be preached to
[1:02:44] many phds lld's doctors of divinity and
[1:02:48] everybody he preached to him he wasn't
[1:02:50] afraid
[1:02:51] because he knew that was truth
[1:02:53] and that jesus would come and back him
[1:02:55] up
[1:02:56] he had nothing to be afraid of
[1:03:01] but i'd just like to say this
[1:03:05] i believe this and know it that jesus
[1:03:07] never went to the cross and died
[1:03:10] for some haphazard affair
[1:03:13] of perhaps maybe somebody might feel
[1:03:15] sorry because he died
[1:03:18] so they'll come and get saved
[1:03:21] huh
[1:03:24] so now here down to this listen
[1:03:30] god doesn't want
[1:03:31] any business like that
[1:03:35] no
[1:03:36] god runs his business by for knowledge
[1:03:40] knowing before the world was ever formed
[1:03:42] who
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:03:45] who wouldn't want to
[1:03:49] another place brother bam says you know
[1:03:51] he never came for those who didn't want
[1:03:52] him
[1:03:53] because if it had all been that
[1:03:56] way he'd probably never come
[1:03:58] because he knew none of them won him
[1:04:00] anyway
[1:04:01] he wouldn't run his business and do
[1:04:02] something vain
[1:04:05] huh
[1:04:06] but he came because he knew there would
[1:04:09] be people
[1:04:10] that would want him
[1:04:13] that would desire him
[1:04:15] just like david my soul first for thee
[1:04:18] god for the living god as the heart
[1:04:21] pantheth for the water brook oh when you
[1:04:23] want more of god and you're willing to
[1:04:25] stay up till nine ten o'clock you're
[1:04:27] willing to meditate on him whenever you
[1:04:29] work and wherever you are to think about
[1:04:31] him
[1:04:32] first after him your life will change
[1:04:35] your atmosphere will change
[1:04:39] your desires and your appetites there
[1:04:42] you go that's a good word appetite
[1:04:45] how many knows
[1:04:46] jesus says which is not their appetite
[1:04:52] show me your appetite
[1:04:54] what you love the feast on i'll show you
[1:04:56] who you are
[1:04:57] hmm
[1:05:00] you like to slop all in the slop of the
[1:05:02] world and eat all the filth up for the
[1:05:04] world
[1:05:06] you're a pig
[1:05:08] that's what pigs do
[1:05:10] they
[1:05:11] eat slop
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:14] you come to church and walk hallelujah
[1:05:17] preach it brother that's so good and
[1:05:19] then go out there and eat a bunch of
[1:05:20] dead cow
[1:05:22] land on some dedication and eat on it
[1:05:25] you're a crow
[1:05:29] you're you know they can eat on
[1:05:32] wheat or they can eat on a carrion
[1:05:35] huh
[1:05:37] show me your desire what you want i'll
[1:05:39] show you who you are
[1:05:43] better take a good look at ourselves
[1:05:48] you know as i get older
[1:05:51] brother glenn
[1:05:52] i'm getting a little older
[1:05:55] you too
[1:05:56] i get to thinking about one thing just
[1:05:58] had a new thought the other day just
[1:06:00] kind of come to me i begin i love to
[1:06:02] think on nothing but the word and and
[1:06:04] the lord try to do that as much in my
[1:06:05] business and whatever i do
[1:06:08] thinking you know i like to meditate
[1:06:09] about being with the saints over there
[1:06:12] huh
[1:06:14] i like to think hey you know what's it
[1:06:16] going to be like to see all the saints
[1:06:18] maybe meditate and kind of think about
[1:06:21] that every day so that whenever you come
[1:06:23] down to the door of death you'll say
[1:06:24] well i guess i'm just going where i've
[1:06:26] been wanting to go for a whole long time
[1:06:30] you know getting ready for that hour
[1:06:32] expectation
[1:06:36] i want to see him i want to see the lord
[1:06:39] saint john first john ii john summoner
[1:06:42] three says you know that we shall see
[1:06:44] him as he is and everyone that has this
[1:06:47] hope in him purifieth himself even as he
[1:06:51] is pure
[1:06:52] we are under expectation to see him one
[1:06:55] of these days to see our loved ones one
[1:06:57] of these days
[1:06:59] amen
[1:07:01] it's what we want
[1:07:03] aren't you glad
[1:07:05] so he came for those who knew who would
[1:07:08] desire to have it
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:12] oh yeah you have a desire for it yes you
[1:07:15] make a choice for it
[1:07:17] it's just that he puts it in for you to
[1:07:19] do it with
[1:07:20] aren't you thankful
[1:07:24] i really don't know what i would do if i
[1:07:26] had wings when i think about the grace
[1:07:28] of god
[1:07:31] if you know that you're a believer you
[1:07:33] know your god has done something for you
[1:07:36] that you're a christian
[1:07:38] that your life has changed your
[1:07:40] appetites have changed your desires have
[1:07:42] changed that that is the grace of god it
[1:07:45] ought to make you the happiest person in
[1:07:46] the world
[1:07:48] because that's a great almighty god
[1:07:50] that's something that you just can't
[1:07:51] give yourself
[1:07:53] god has to give that to you
[1:07:58] i'm going to take a couple examples if i
[1:08:00] could yet
[1:08:01] one of them was
[1:08:04] simon can i read the story
[1:08:07] let's go let's go to another story of
[1:08:10] people some people who wanted him
[1:08:14] and people who
[1:08:15] did not want him
[1:08:19] luke 7.
[1:08:26] that's actually just a page over from
[1:08:27] where we're at
[1:08:29] if i'm on the right place
[1:08:38] you know it would help if i go to luke
[1:08:39] and not john excuse me
[1:08:45] all right now let's hope i got it right
[1:08:48] 7 and 36.
[1:08:58] nope that's
[1:09:00] that's not what i was looking for but
[1:09:02] i do have this scripture wrote down
[1:09:05] 7 36 wait it would help me if i go to
[1:09:08] seven and not eight all right
[1:09:10] still on the eighth chapter
[1:09:13] now if i have it wrong here we'll just
[1:09:15] close church for tonight
[1:09:21] i'll go take some medicine or something
[1:09:25] 7 36 and one of the fairest
[1:09:27] he's desired him
[1:09:30] that he would eat with him
[1:09:33] and went in unto the pharisees and he
[1:09:35] went into the pharisees house and sat
[1:09:37] down to me
[1:09:39] and behold a woman in the city which was
[1:09:41] his
[1:09:42] sinner and when she knew that jesus sat
[1:09:44] at meat with the fair and stood at his
[1:09:46] feet behind him
[1:09:49] weeping
[1:09:52] and began to wash his feet with the with
[1:09:54] her with tears
[1:09:56] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[1:09:58] head
[1:09:59] and kissed his feet and anointed them
[1:10:03] with the ointment
[1:10:05] amen
[1:10:09] remember this was very expensive stuff
[1:10:11] that she got
[1:10:14] right
[1:10:18] because
[1:10:20] as we
[1:10:21] understand through the prophet
[1:10:24] that they had a certain and then have
[1:10:26] they'd have a foot wash wonky to wash
[1:10:28] his feet you know and anoint him and and
[1:10:30] so forth and kiss him make him welcome
[1:10:32] and all these things you know and
[1:10:34] he sat in that room and just sat there
[1:10:37] i believe it was simon the pharisees if
[1:10:39] i'm not wrong
[1:10:40] how did he invited him to come and then
[1:10:42] just left him sitting there
[1:10:44] can you imagine the disrespect
[1:10:49] do you think he really wanted him there
[1:10:51] i don't think so
[1:10:53] i think he wanted to make fun of him
[1:10:56] but listen
[1:10:57] anointed them with the ointment and when
[1:11:00] the pharisee's pharisee which had bitten
[1:11:02] him saw it he spake within himself
[1:11:05] saying this man if he were a prophet
[1:11:08] would have known who in what manner of
[1:11:10] woman this is that touches him
[1:11:13] for she's a sinner
[1:11:18] oh my
[1:11:20] can i stop there for a minute
[1:11:22] listen to me
[1:11:24] how did this get in the scriptures
[1:11:27] how did it get in the scriptures
[1:11:30] well luke wrote it
[1:11:32] so perhaps because i don't know that
[1:11:34] jesus ever told
[1:11:36] that pharisee
[1:11:37] hey i already know what you're thinking
[1:11:40] right but jesus knew what he was
[1:11:41] thinking
[1:11:43] no doubt but jesus rehearsed perhaps
[1:11:45] this to his disciples say i already knew
[1:11:47] what he was thinking
[1:11:49] right
[1:11:51] and jesus
[1:11:52] answered said unto
[1:11:55] him simon
[1:11:57] i have somewhat to say unto dumb
[1:12:01] by meaning he kept his mouth shut didn't
[1:12:03] say anything
[1:12:06] but this is one of those times where i
[1:12:07] opened his mouth
[1:12:10] but said i've got something to say to
[1:12:12] you son
[1:12:15] i mean those there's coming a day when
[1:12:17] he's gonna have something to say to a
[1:12:19] lot of people
[1:12:20] oh yeah a lot to say to a lot of people
[1:12:25] about how they treated
[1:12:28] him while he was here on earth
[1:12:30] and what he did in his end time
[1:12:32] amen
[1:12:35] and he said master say on
[1:12:37] there was a certain creditor which had
[1:12:39] two debtors
[1:12:41] the one owed 500 pence in the other 50.
[1:12:44] when they had nothing to pay he frankly
[1:12:46] forgave them both tell me therefore
[1:12:47] which of them will love them the most
[1:12:49] simon answered and said i suppose that
[1:12:51] he to whom he forgave the most and he
[1:12:53] said unto them thou hast rightly judged
[1:12:55] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[1:12:58] simon
[1:13:00] see is that this woman
[1:13:04] i entered into thy house and that gave
[1:13:06] us me no water for my feet
[1:13:09] you unwelcomed me
[1:13:12] now
[1:13:13] didn't make him welcome
[1:13:16] but she has washed my feet not with
[1:13:19] water
[1:13:20] but with tears
[1:13:22] i mean she wanted him
[1:13:26] she desired forgiveness
[1:13:29] she no doubt believed that he was the
[1:13:30] messiah
[1:13:32] that he was the savior that he was the
[1:13:33] son of god
[1:13:35] not believe brother bennett but that
[1:13:37] whenever simon sent his little servant
[1:13:39] to go call jesus and to invite him
[1:13:41] that little servant boy was just
[1:13:43] interested in hey my master wants you to
[1:13:45] come to eat that boy should have ran up
[1:13:47] to his feet fell down
[1:13:50] shipped him out
[1:13:52] that's forgiveness for his sins
[1:13:54] amen
[1:13:56] even as brother branham i believe in i'm
[1:13:58] thinking it was perhaps in canada when
[1:14:00] he was preaching he told them that way
[1:14:01] too starchy they're way too stiff
[1:14:03] they're way too formal and he had an
[1:14:05] altar call and so forth and he says
[1:14:07] barely anybody would come and he'd hurt
[1:14:09] jesus christ
[1:14:10] even after the german went forth telling
[1:14:13] them who they were what their names was
[1:14:14] and everything like that then people
[1:14:16] still wouldn't repent when jesus was
[1:14:18] right there
[1:14:20] wouldn't you like to have the desert
[1:14:21] wouldn't you like to have the chance to
[1:14:22] run to the altar and say god forgive me
[1:14:25] in my sins save me lord jesus help me to
[1:14:27] serve you with all of my heart
[1:14:29] sure we all would have how many is with
[1:14:30] me
[1:14:31] we didn't love that chance
[1:14:34] but she has washed my feet with tears
[1:14:37] and wiped them with the hairs of her
[1:14:39] head
[1:14:40] and thou gave me no kiss but this woman
[1:14:42] since the time i came in has not
[1:14:46] ceased to kiss my feet

[1:15:11] he gave us all these things that people
[1:15:13] don't
[1:15:14] want it amen
[1:15:17] i think one of the things that god's
[1:15:19] going to say at judgment
[1:15:20] he's going to prove to him that
[1:15:23] now you didn't really want it that's

[1:15:39] amen but that's i hope that sticks
[1:15:43] people want other things more than they
[1:15:45] want christ

[1:16:32] forgiven
