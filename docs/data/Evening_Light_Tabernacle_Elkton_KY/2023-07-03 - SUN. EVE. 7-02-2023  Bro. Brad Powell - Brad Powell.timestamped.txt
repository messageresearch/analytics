[24:48] everyone out here
[24:50] okay

[25:05] When the Crowds
[25:08] came that day
[25:10] [Music]
[25:12] took him
[25:14] from the garden
[25:17] and his disciples
[25:20] [Music]
[25:21] walked away
[25:24] what could have gone through his mind
[25:30] as they nailed him
[25:33] to the tree
[25:37] oh but now
[25:40] now I know
[25:42] [Music]

[26:30] all of the time so when I could be free
[26:38] it's hard to understand
[26:52] everybody
[26:54] [Music]
[27:03] there's Jesus
[27:05] on on the cross that day
[27:09] a multitude
[27:12] gathered around
[27:16] each one
[27:18] he was dying to save
[27:21] but he saw more
[27:24] than just that crowd
[27:26] [Music]
[27:28] for his mind
[27:30] went to the Future
[27:33] when he would hear
[27:36] this Sinner's plea
[27:40] for he knew
[27:43] I too would need a savior
[27:46] thank God
[27:49] he was thinking of me
[27:55] he was dating
[27:58] for me
[28:03] all the way to
[28:06] Calvary
[28:09] he had me on his mind all of the time
[28:16] [Music]
[28:21] it's hard to understand
[28:23] [Music]
[28:27] but now I can't see
[28:31] you
[28:33] he suffered and died so that I could
[28:38] have life he was thinking to love me
[28:43] [Music]
[28:46] oh Jesus
[28:49] has never failed me
[28:52] since I met him
[28:55] bad day
[28:58] and his spirit
[29:01] brings me Comfort
[29:04] when life Trials
[29:07] come my way
[29:09] [Music]
[29:15] [Music]
[29:17] and it blows
[29:20] eternally
[29:22] he paid it all
[29:25] though the cost was great
[29:29] Jesus Paid that price for me
[29:34] [Music]
[29:37] he was thinking of me
[29:43] [Music]
[29:47] free

[29:52] all of the time so that I could be free
[30:00] it's hard to understand
[30:06] but now I can't sleep

[35:31] Calvary for us for our sins that that as
[35:35] you look through down upon us Lord you
[35:37] see no sins but you see see us as clear
[35:39] and clean and we thank you for that Lord
[35:41] Jesus before we just ask the Lord that
[35:43] you just be in the service tonight and
[35:45] this little thought as we finish up this
[35:47] topic and and close out the thought here
[35:49] Lord we just ask that you would help
[35:51] Help the People your bride to be
[35:53] attentive and and and give them energy
[35:55] to be able to to uh withstand the the
[35:59] few minutes it will speak Lord that they
[36:01] could be taken into the word and and the
[36:04] word would Captivate them to a place
[36:05] that it would draw them close to you and
[36:08] myself as well Lord would you anoint my
[36:10] lips to speak what you would have laid
[36:11] on our heart we just want to tell you we
[36:13] love you and we appreciate you in Jesus
[36:15] name we pray amen amen you may have your
[36:18] seats
[36:19] if a son therefore shall make you free
[36:22] you shall be free indeed that's an
[36:25] amazing statement and goes right along
[36:27] with what we talked about this morning
[36:29] and brother Brown's talking in this
[36:31] message here where he's preaching and it
[36:34] says the message God talked to Moses and
[36:37] he said the Holy Ghost is moving on
[36:39] signs and wonders are following and
[36:41] demonstrations and powers of God and
[36:44] healings woo he says that's me he says
[36:46] that's what I like
[36:48] amen that's what I like and that's what
[36:51] the prophet says he's he likes those
[36:53] things he said he who the son has made
[36:55] free is free indeed he says no bondage
[36:59] no he says no you're free and Liberty
[37:02] where Christ has made you free that's
[37:05] right he says knock that little old
[37:07] hevite out of the way not that little
[37:09] ojedicide out of the way take that
[37:12] little low Canaanite and just kick him
[37:14] away so what he's telling us here is all
[37:16] these little be setting sins that just
[37:19] nag and pick and nag and poke and prod
[37:21] at you get rid of them just kick them
[37:23] away because you don't have to endure
[37:25] those anymore get them out of your life
[37:27] and kick them away he said don't let him
[37:30] live
[37:32] yeah
[37:34] don't let him live don't babysit those
[37:37] little things don't just carry and hold
[37:39] on to those little things and pet them
[37:41] you know sometimes we have our Petsense
[37:43] the little things in our life that we
[37:45] brush and we pet and we love and we
[37:47] nurture and we hold because oh I like
[37:49] this but God says don't do that kill it
[37:54] get rid of that sin in your life in that
[37:56] little thing kill him he says destroy
[37:58] him don't just say oh my dear little
[38:01] friend I'll be back to see you again as
[38:04] soon as Revival's over
[38:07] uh-oh how many times have we done that
[38:09] how many times do we as Believers if
[38:11] we're not careful we go to meetings we
[38:13] go to Services we go to the house of God
[38:16] on Sunday and we leave so energized so
[38:18] encouraged and so inspired to tackle the
[38:21] world just to tell our little sin just
[38:23] just wait till I get back home
[38:26] come on church we got to be beyond that
[38:28] we're in an age where we're beyond that
[38:30] he says don't never do that if you do
[38:33] that you will never get the promised
[38:35] land he says no take out your sword
[38:39] and go to fighting
[38:41] go to fighting and take those little
[38:44] things by the throat
[38:48] um
[38:49] so these are powerful and encouraging
[38:52] words that the prophet tells us and if
[38:55] you're free tonight give yourself a pat
[38:57] on the back
[39:00] everybody ought to be Patton amen
[39:02] because pat yourself on the back not
[39:04] because of anything you've done
[39:06] no not anything you've done but you can
[39:09] be proud as a Christian knowing that God
[39:11] thought about you before the foundation
[39:13] of the world and said you're more
[39:16] important to me than anybody else you
[39:19] realize that's the way God sees you
[39:20] brother Peter he sees you as more
[39:22] important than anybody else in this room
[39:25] for the joke you're more important than
[39:27] any each one of us has to recognize that
[39:29] God sees us as individuals
[39:33] and God wants our individual worship
[39:36] back to him
[39:39] so word free if you're free tonight you
[39:41] can be happy in that because that word
[39:43] free means to liberate it means to be
[39:46] exempt from liability
[39:48] do you hear what I said it means to be
[39:50] exempt from liability it means the
[39:52] things that you should be
[39:54] punished for
[39:57] the sins that you've done wrong and the
[39:59] punishment that should come for those
[40:01] sins you're exempt from the liability of
[40:04] that
[40:05] foreign
[40:07] he went to the Cross brother Glenn like
[40:09] you said he died and made you exempt
[40:12] that's where we get the song He Paid a
[40:14] Debt that I could never repay and that
[40:17] is Christ in this hour in this life
[40:19] we're living in if we read that we
[40:21] should really read like this the Sun
[40:24] liberates or exempts from liability will
[40:28] really be liberated and exempt from
[40:31] liability
[40:39] because consider two different
[40:40] conclusions first of all what has Christ
[40:43] freed you from
[40:45] what does he freed you from and then the
[40:47] second thing that I would look at
[40:48] tonight is what is Christ freed you to
[40:52] [Music]
[40:55] oh yeah when you get delivered there's a
[40:59] freedom that God begins to give you
[41:01] things it's just like the story on the
[41:04] checkbook and he can't just give you an
[41:06] open checkbook
[41:09] if you're not ready to handle an open
[41:11] checkbook
[41:13] but when you're free and you're within
[41:15] in the hands of God and God trusts you
[41:17] he can then allow you to write the
[41:18] checks whatever you have need of
[41:21] foreign
[41:24] we went to the or I I'm gonna pick on
[41:28] Carson for a minute
[41:30] he was at a a three-week governor
[41:33] scholar program we gave him a debit card
[41:36] and I talked about car Weston and his
[41:38] debit card at school well I guess he
[41:40] missed the service
[41:44] we're looking on our
[41:46] card statement and we've got like a
[41:49] thirty dollar charge for a Mountain Dew
[41:52] door Dash
[41:57] hey
[41:59] what what's going on up there I was
[42:01] thirsty I was hungry
[42:05] he using that card for doordash I need
[42:09] some fingernail clippers I said them
[42:11] fingernail clippers will cost you 150
[42:13] don't you order no fingernail clippers
[42:15] through door Dash let them things grow
[42:18] out or bite them off
[42:22] but you had to get to a place to where
[42:24] God can trust you
[42:28] we live are the examples and God looks
[42:31] at us and he says I could trust him in
[42:33] this and I can trust him in that but
[42:35] right here I got to kind of put the
[42:36] brakes on for a little bit he's not
[42:37] quite ready for that but when we're
[42:40] freed there's Freedom there that God
[42:42] gives us things so looking at both sides
[42:44] of that coin they're both critical but
[42:47] what has Christ freed us from Christ has
[42:50] freed us from the bondage of sin
[42:54] sin no longer is your Captor
[42:58] you're no longer captive by sin because
[43:01] someone who is liberated let's loose the
[43:05] bound the bonds someone who's been
[43:07] liberated the change no longer Federal
[43:10] you're no longer tied down to a ball in
[43:14] a chain the way you used to drag it
[43:15] around and you used to walk like this
[43:18] and you used to say I had doubt I had
[43:20] sin
[43:22] I did this I had nicotine that's that's
[43:25] your sin I had alcohol I had drugs I had
[43:29] pornography and you began to realize
[43:31] that you're dragging these sins around
[43:33] but when you're free through the blood
[43:35] of Jesus Christ you drag those sins no
[43:38] more
[43:43] [Music]
[43:46] captive is one who's confined
[43:49] I'm not confined down to the things of
[43:51] this world
[43:53] you and I are not confined by the things
[43:55] of this world because God has promised
[43:58] us a better place
[44:02] that's what you're freed from sin
[44:05] what is it to conquer he says the
[44:07] prophet says conquering Victory is the
[44:09] same this is one of my favorite quotes
[44:11] I've used it many times the Conqueror
[44:13] means to beat down to override to
[44:15] handcuff or to throw into prison
[44:18] it means that the sin that once ruled
[44:20] you you rule it now
[44:24] you say when you come to the Cross
[44:26] things change in your life there's a
[44:28] turnaround something happens it gives
[44:30] you power and authority and the ability
[44:33] to say sin you no longer bind me I bind
[44:36] you get out of my house
[44:38] and so here you've you'll rule it now he
[44:42] says it means you've overcome it you've
[44:44] whipped it I like his I like his
[44:46] Kentucky grammar you've whipped it how
[44:48] many of us know what it means to whip
[44:49] something
[44:51] yeah yeah that means you ain't playing
[44:54] around
[44:55] when you don't whoop somebody
[44:57] you're done you know you don't open a
[45:00] can of Kentucky wolf on them
[45:02] and you don't whoop them and you put
[45:04] them into a place that they no longer
[45:07] look at you and say I'm going to try to
[45:09] try you again no they're not going to
[45:10] try you again when you whoop somebody
[45:12] they don't come back at you
[45:15] and that's the kind of power we have to
[45:18] have the prophet said oh I feel
[45:19] religious right now
[45:25] in our days before living in Christ
[45:29] we don't want to Harbor and look back
[45:31] and and bring up and relish and and
[45:33] those things we're not doing that
[45:35] tonight those things are gone
[45:39] but thinking thinking about the life
[45:41] before Christ
[45:43] whatever sin wanted sin got
[45:48] if sin wanted to get drunk you got
[45:50] alcohol
[45:51] if sin wanted nicotine you got tobacco
[45:55] if sin wanted to get high you got drugs
[46:00] those are what the things that sin did
[46:03] Sin God was sin wanted
[46:06] but now that you've made a turn in your
[46:08] life
[46:09] you took off the old coat
[46:13] and you put on a new coat
[46:16] and you see yourself in a different
[46:17] light that no longer are those things
[46:20] that are trying to get you
[46:22] gotcha
[46:25] sin can want all it can want but it has
[46:28] no place
[46:30] in this vessel
[46:34] Romans 6 tells us Paul tells us that sin
[46:38] at that time in your life was your
[46:40] master
[46:41] hmm
[46:44] but then that beauty happened
[46:48] and just like turning on a switch
[46:52] you say well it didn't happen to me like
[46:54] oh yes it did if you accepted Jesus
[46:55] Christ your life was changed instantly
[46:58] you may not have felt different you may
[47:00] not have sang different you may not have
[47:02] run different you may not have shouted
[47:04] different
[47:05] but if you truly accepted Jesus Christ
[47:08] it was a finished work right then and
[47:12] there
[47:13] God gave
[47:15] you a whole new nature and then more
[47:18] importantly that as time goes on he
[47:21] begins to fill you with you with his
[47:23] Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost in your
[47:26] life is is what takes over now and
[47:28] you're no longer under control of that
[47:30] sinful nature when you got that Holy
[47:32] Ghost that's when you're in control
[47:35] it no longer controls you when you've
[47:37] got the Holy Ghost and you're filled
[47:39] with the Holy Ghost that's when you're
[47:41] walking and you're telling sin what to
[47:42] do get out sin go here sin I'm not
[47:45] listening to you sin you can't tell me
[47:47] to go there you
[47:48] you can tell me but I'm not going I'm
[47:52] not watching I'm not listening
[47:57] there's a song I like
[48:00] and it's an old Pentecostal song and
[48:02] maybe most of you probably know but it's
[48:04] called two coats
[48:06] two coats I'm gonna read the lyrics to
[48:09] you I wish we could had it and could
[48:10] sing it but I need somebody a better
[48:12] singer than me
[48:13] but it says two coats were before me an
[48:15] old and a new and I asked my sweet
[48:18] master oh what must I do the old coat
[48:21] was ugly so tired and torn the other one
[48:24] a new one that had never been worn
[48:26] he said I'll tell you the best thing I
[48:29] ever did do was put off the old coat and
[48:32] put on the new
[48:35] listen to those lyrics I took off the
[48:37] old coat and put on the new he said the
[48:39] first man was Earthly made from the
[48:41] ground we all bore His Image the whole
[48:44] world around the next was my savior from
[48:47] heaven so fair he bought me this new
[48:50] coach you now see me where
[48:52] oh brothers or sisters that was a price
[48:54] paid for a life change in your life and
[48:58] Christ bought that and said here put
[49:00] this on it looks better on you
[49:03] because that filthy coat that filthy
[49:05] rags the the the the the the the dirt
[49:08] and the filth and the muck and the mire
[49:10] they never maybe your coat looked like
[49:12] it had never been washed
[49:15] and he says here's you a new garment to
[49:18] wear
[49:20] Paul
[49:21] sums it up and he says uh
[49:24] the Lord is the spirit and we're the
[49:26] spirit of the Lord is there is
[49:29] Freedom Liberty Freedom Liberty and
[49:33] freedom
[49:36] when you have this Freedom you are freed
[49:39] from the penalty of sin
[49:44] regardless if you want to believe it or
[49:45] not the book of Romans tells us the
[49:48] wages of sins death
[49:49] and we were all born into this world
[49:52] speaking lies
[49:55] we all had to go through that nature
[49:57] change
[49:59] and until you go through that nature
[50:00] change you don't know what I'm talking
[50:02] about
[50:03] because you know to be honest
[50:06] outside of Christ you had a death
[50:08] sentence
[50:11] and when you're living in sin and you're
[50:13] running and ripping and and snorting
[50:16] around through towns and so forth
[50:18] foreign
[50:20] the fact that you're invincible
[50:23] you tend to think that there's nothing
[50:25] that can harm you you tend to think that
[50:27] there's nothing going to stop you
[50:29] but they're wages of sin
[50:33] is death
[50:34] separation it's a you might as well have
[50:37] been living on death row
[50:41] can you imagine what it's like to be an
[50:43] inmate or a prisoner and you're living
[50:45] on death row
[50:46] that was you
[50:48] you ought to be able to imagine it
[50:50] because that was you
[50:51] that's what it was like before Christ
[50:53] came into your life and unfortunately
[50:56] I'm afraid there's too many people still
[50:58] living today that don't recognize the
[51:00] wages of sin
[51:02] because this world is going deeper and
[51:04] deeper and farther and farther into a
[51:06] world of sin and to a world of of of uh
[51:10] perversion
[51:12] that is not going to make it
[51:14] when men try to become women and women
[51:17] become men and homosexuality is rampant
[51:21] you know I used to be a little bit
[51:22] hesitant about preaching on that because
[51:24] I thought man that made you up come back
[51:26] and give me some backlash I don't care
[51:28] anymore
[51:29] the word is a word
[51:33] there was an Adam and Eve not Adam and
[51:35] Steve
[51:37] there is no way medically possible I
[51:41] know science I'm a nurse and I know
[51:43] there is no way medically possible
[51:46] for two men to have a baby there's no
[51:49] way medically possible for two women to
[51:52] have a baby
[51:54] it's not possible
[51:56] God didn't make it that way
[51:58] so why should I be ashamed to stand up
[52:00] here and say that's not right
[52:02] because this sin if somebody don't call
[52:05] it out how will they ever know you say
[52:07] well they'll hate you they'll resent you
[52:09] they'll talk about you they may make fun
[52:11] of you I don't care somebody's got to
[52:14] tell them truth
[52:15] and these pastors and preachers in this
[52:17] in the worldly denominations and maybe
[52:19] even I don't know I hope there's none in
[52:21] the message but it could be it says this
[52:23] is okay
[52:25] [Music]
[52:28] I hate it for him
[52:30] I hate it for him
[52:34] be sinners
[52:36] that I'm talking about
[52:40] they're proud
[52:42] yeah
[52:43] they have Liberty
[52:47] and they take Liberty
[52:51] they say what they want to say
[52:53] they do what they want to do
[52:55] they act the way they want to act
[52:57] in front of your kids or not
[52:59] promoted in front of
[53:01] kids that's Liberty they're taking their
[53:03] Liberty while they've got Liberty on
[53:04] Earth
[53:06] but there's someone today when they
[53:07] won't have that kind of Liberty
[53:09] because those kinds of that kind of life
[53:12] right there that lifestyle is going to
[53:14] lead to separation
[53:16] it's going to lead to a life of death
[53:18] and a life of darkness and a life and
[53:20] they're going to go down a path can you
[53:23] imagine the path
[53:24] that leads to that kind of Darkness
[53:29] think about it we talk about death but
[53:31] death is not anything real death is just
[53:34] a bluff to the believer
[53:36] like I said in my last time I preached
[53:38] up here death is just a bump in the road
[53:40] There Is No Death should not even be in
[53:42] the vocabulary of a Christian
[53:45] it's non-existent word because we step
[53:49] from life into eternity
[53:52] we don't step from life into death if
[53:54] we're stepping out we're stepping in the
[53:55] wrong places
[53:57] we're stepping from life into eternity
[54:00] can you imagine the separation
[54:06] imagine if you will you're in complete
[54:09] utter Darkness
[54:13] darkness that you can't even see the
[54:15] hand in front of your face
[54:18] and it's eerie and utterly silent just
[54:22] imagine this is the separation
[54:27] eerie
[54:29] silent
[54:30] lonely
[54:33] has anybody ever told these people
[54:36] this is the feeling they'll have
[54:38] so lonely
[54:40] brother Brown said he went pray for that
[54:42] that colored boy in Memphis I believe it
[54:44] was and said he walked in there what was
[54:45] he doing mama
[54:50] there was nobody there to comfort him
[54:53] there was nobody there to Pat him on the
[54:54] back there was nobody there to wrap
[54:56] their arms around him and he was laying
[54:59] there in that darkness and he said it's
[55:00] getting dark didn't tell what he said
[55:02] it's getting dark it's getting dark mama
[55:05] mama where are you can you imagine being
[55:07] in a place like that that will
[55:09] eventually only be turned to a life of
[55:11] Chaos
[55:13] foreign
[55:16] let me tell you can Rejoice today
[55:20] just thinking about that and knowing
[55:22] that you have eternal life a life of a
[55:25] life that goes on forever and ever and
[55:27] ever and you'll be in the very presence
[55:29] of God and you'll hear Angelic choirs
[55:32] sing and there will be just a vast
[55:34] amount of people that are praising God
[55:37] and worshiping God and loving on God can
[55:40] you imagine that ought to get you up and
[55:41] shouting that ought to make us run
[55:43] around the pews
[55:45] laughs
[55:48] you're free from that penalty of death
[55:53] you're free
[55:55] you've been freed from guilt and shame
[55:57] of your sin
[55:59] you've been free
[56:02] from the things that you did that you
[56:04] wish you could take back and you can't
[56:09] you're free from that
[56:11] our nature our our conscience wants to
[56:15] hold on to it and say
[56:17] yeah but you're free from that
[56:20] the things that you've done
[56:25] um
[56:26] they can haunt you
[56:29] they can you
[56:31] and that is one of Satan's biggest
[56:33] weapons against the believer
[56:35] as he begins to point fingers at you
[56:37] remember remember remember
[56:40] do you remember do you remember
[56:43] I remember that's what he'll tell you
[56:45] let me remind you
[56:47] and that is his biggest weapon as he
[56:49] begins to come down there and he
[56:51] encourages you look back on those
[56:53] shameful moments look back on all those
[56:56] shameful and condemnation that the life
[56:58] of condemnation that you live look back
[57:00] on that and relish that and remember it
[57:04] sisters we're freed from that
[57:07] when that blood was shed and dripped
[57:09] down on Calvary
[57:11] that blood covered every bit of that up
[57:14] and it's not even seen no more the devil
[57:16] may see it we know it's there but God
[57:19] said it's as though it never even
[57:21] happened
[57:22] so how can the devil remind you of
[57:25] things that God don't even know happened
[57:31] you've been set free
[57:34] that's your freedom
[57:39] brother Brown tells a story
[57:42] and I'm going to tell you this because
[57:43] we allow this to burden this
[57:46] maybe y'all don't I do I sometimes think
[57:49] and I think man this is this is a burden
[57:51] how how could God ever accept me
[57:54] with the things I used to do
[57:57] and sometimes I find that gets a little
[57:59] heavy on me
[58:00] and then I hear the story of what
[58:02] brother Brown was talking about the the
[58:04] woman and the man
[58:05] in the in the little gambling joint the
[58:07] little hole in the wall gambling joint
[58:09] you know what I'm talking about and he's
[58:11] looking at that and he's watching out
[58:12] and he says oh my God how can you stand
[58:15] to look down on
[58:17] such as this
[58:21] and he said the Lord call me behind the
[58:23] door can you imagine that
[58:28] come here
[58:32] yes sir
[58:35] yes sir
[58:37] he said he called me behind the door and
[58:38] I saw a vision
[58:40] and he said I saw the world in it
[58:42] turning and he said I saw that my sin
[58:45] and other people's sins was going up and
[58:47] I said God why don't you just blow this
[58:50] place up how can you stand it
[58:52] he said but then I seen around this
[58:55] world was a crimson stream
[58:58] around this world was a crimson stream
[59:01] and I seen the Lord Jesus standing there
[59:03] in all of his pity
[59:06] and he's looked down upon the Earth and
[59:09] I've seen my sins as they went up to him
[59:11] but that blood acted like a bumper
[59:20] never reaching no harm
[59:23] and he said I see that blood it acted
[59:25] like a bumper before God they could not
[59:27] come to him
[59:30] as though you never done it my sins they
[59:34] could not come up to him and he said
[59:36] I've seen every time I've done something
[59:38] wrong
[59:39] his blood which
[59:40] between me and the Judgment of God
[59:44] thank God
[59:46] thank God tonight for a blood bumper a
[59:48] barrier that covers Us and goes between
[59:51] us and a judgmental God who will judge
[59:54] this Earth
[59:59] and he said I walked up to him and I
[1:00:01] said Lord in the vision is this my sins
[1:00:05] doing that
[1:00:07] I said forgive me God I didn't mean to
[1:00:10] do it
[1:00:12] forgive me God I didn't mean to do it he
[1:00:15] said he stuck his hand in his side and
[1:00:17] reached over and got a little book
[1:00:19] that my name was written on
[1:00:22] and he said he got a little book that
[1:00:23] had my name written on it
[1:00:27] pardoned
[1:00:30] he wrote pardoned across it
[1:00:35] and he went put it on the shelf for a
[1:00:36] later rep
[1:00:38] S no
[1:00:39] no that's not what he said
[1:00:41] he said in the vision he took out a
[1:00:42] little book out of his side and it was
[1:00:44] William random's book and he wrote
[1:00:45] pardon on it he said he threw it behind
[1:00:47] him
[1:00:48] he threw it behind him and got rid of it
[1:00:51] into the sea of his forgetfulness that
[1:00:54] book today is in the bottom of the
[1:00:56] deepest depths of the ocean
[1:01:00] they won't take no submarine down there
[1:01:02] to find it
[1:01:09] and he said now I forgive you for your
[1:01:12] sins
[1:01:15] but what about you saying that about
[1:01:18] that woman
[1:01:20] um
[1:01:24] but we're free
[1:01:25] we're free from that
[1:01:28] we have freedom to live
[1:01:31] and when I'm talking about living I'm
[1:01:33] talking about living to the greatest
[1:01:34] capacity that that you could ever
[1:01:36] imagine in Christ
[1:01:38] we have the ability to live
[1:01:40] and we have to understand that when
[1:01:42] we're free from bondage and penalty and
[1:01:44] the guilt of sin it increases our
[1:01:46] capacity
[1:01:48] you know the prophet said that if
[1:01:50] there's a desire in your heart for more
[1:01:52] of God
[1:01:53] there's what more of God for you
[1:01:58] so when you find yourself that you are
[1:02:00] free you're free uh to live in God it
[1:02:04] opens up the capacity that makes your
[1:02:07] heart desire give me more God give me
[1:02:10] more God
[1:02:12] I want to worship more God I want to do
[1:02:15] more for you God I Want To Praise You
[1:02:17] More God and it begins to build in Your
[1:02:19] Capacity your heart just begins to swell
[1:02:21] and swell and swell and swell and swell
[1:02:29] it just come to me first message I
[1:02:31] preach was preach was heart of a
[1:02:33] thoroughbred
[1:02:36] and as you begin to fill up with God
[1:02:38] your heart as I said so
[1:02:43] how many knows the sectarian
[1:02:47] Secretariat
[1:02:49] at the Belmont Stakes I believe it is
[1:02:52] when he won by 32 links 34 links you
[1:02:56] ought to listen to the call it'll send
[1:02:58] Shields down you
[1:02:59] when the guy is talking about the horse
[1:03:01] begins to run and he's running and he's
[1:03:03] racing and he's giving and he's going
[1:03:05] more and he's getting stronger and
[1:03:07] stronger and the the horse is trying to
[1:03:10] Trail him and the big debate was he ends
[1:03:12] up beating him by 32 links
[1:03:16] the other horse wasn't even in the view
[1:03:18] of the camera
[1:03:20] they did an autopsy of Secretariat
[1:03:23] what makes this horse so different what
[1:03:26] gives him the drive what makes him so
[1:03:28] strong what gives him the energy and the
[1:03:30] endurance to run away from the field
[1:03:32] like never seen before still holds all
[1:03:34] three track records the the Belmont the
[1:03:37] Preakness the Kentucky Derby the Triple
[1:03:39] Crown records
[1:03:41] you know what he was
[1:03:44] it's hard
[1:03:46] the average horse heart weighs seven
[1:03:49] pounds
[1:03:51] Secretariat's heart weighed 22 pounds
[1:03:58] 22 pounds
[1:04:01] brothers and sisters as we get more of
[1:04:03] God in us and more of God in this and
[1:04:06] more of God in us we begin to find that
[1:04:08] we can run the race a little bit farther
[1:04:10] we can run the race a little bit faster
[1:04:12] we can find ourselves getting on around
[1:04:14] the track a little bit faster than our
[1:04:16] enemy can
[1:04:18] oh
[1:04:24] you remember in the Garden of Eden Adam
[1:04:26] and Eve
[1:04:27] they sinned
[1:04:29] and when they sinned what was the first
[1:04:31] thing they did
[1:04:34] they hid
[1:04:36] they cover themselves
[1:04:39] and they hid themselves
[1:04:42] that's sin caused their capacity to be
[1:04:46] at a minimum
[1:04:48] because instantly they couldn't
[1:04:49] fellowship with God the way they used to
[1:04:52] fellowship with God
[1:04:54] so that's why it's so important that we
[1:04:56] don't allow these besetting things to
[1:04:58] hang around us that we don't find
[1:04:59] ourselves in places we shouldn't be or
[1:05:01] seeing things we shouldn't see hearing
[1:05:03] but we can go on and on and on and we've
[1:05:06] been talking about this all day but the
[1:05:08] importance of it is when Adam and Eve
[1:05:09] found themselves in that guilty state of
[1:05:11] mind because they knew they had done
[1:05:12] wrong they hid themselves and covered up
[1:05:15] and God then had to go looking for him
[1:05:18] Adam Adam
[1:05:20] do you think God was confused of where
[1:05:22] they were at
[1:05:24] no
[1:05:26] but thank God that God caused
[1:05:29] God had known exactly what had happened
[1:05:32] and God knows
[1:05:36] exactly will clear out the claw
[1:05:39] s
[1:05:40] because God knows it anyway
[1:05:43] don't find yourself held back from the
[1:05:46] from the from the goodness of God
[1:05:48] because there's not enough capacity in
[1:05:49] your heart because you're harboring and
[1:05:51] hiding a little low secret sins little
[1:05:53] secret sins that are not going to do
[1:05:55] nothing but tear you down
[1:05:57] get rid of those things in your life and
[1:05:59] open up and have more for God
[1:06:04] James says come near to God and he'll
[1:06:06] come near to you
[1:06:08] that's what freedom is
[1:06:10] I want to know that when I go with stand
[1:06:12] before God I can come freely before God
[1:06:15] and I don't have to hide myself I don't
[1:06:18] have to be in shame now you say are you
[1:06:19] perfect no no I'm far from perfect
[1:06:22] but I know when I do wrong just like you
[1:06:25] know when you do wrong
[1:06:27] you don't have to have somebody pick
[1:06:29] your life apart tell you now you know
[1:06:30] you shouldn't have done this you
[1:06:31] shouldn't have done that you shouldn't
[1:06:32] no no no
[1:06:34] your conscience tells you
[1:06:36] you know that little dub on this
[1:06:38] shoulder sits there and it sits there
[1:06:39] and it's just kind of cooing and cooing
[1:06:42] and cooing and all of a sudden
[1:06:45] it's gone
[1:06:46] where did it go what did I say what did
[1:06:48] I do that's my first question why do I
[1:06:50] feel the way I feel what did I do
[1:06:53] and instantly I say God forgive me I
[1:06:56] should not have done that I should not
[1:06:57] have said that I should have not have
[1:06:59] have partaken in this and in that little
[1:07:01] dove
[1:07:09] that's the way God works
[1:07:12] that's the way God operates
[1:07:15] when you have the freedom
[1:07:17] you also have the freedom to serve
[1:07:20] you know one of the biggest things
[1:07:23] that is also the one of the biggest
[1:07:24] things that God likes and requires but
[1:07:27] is one of the most challenging things
[1:07:28] for us to do is serve
[1:07:31] did you know that
[1:07:34] man you are quad
[1:07:37] y'all been pretty pretty pretty active
[1:07:39] until that
[1:07:40] I guess that turkey hit you hard or
[1:07:42] something
[1:07:45] serve
[1:07:46] servitude
[1:07:48] to be a servant of Christ
[1:07:51] to go out into the highways and the
[1:07:53] hedges and
[1:07:55] wait Dion did y'all scratch that out of
[1:07:57] y'all's book
[1:08:00] serving others
[1:08:03] being there for others when others are
[1:08:05] in need you find yourself serving when
[1:08:07] you're free you're able to do those
[1:08:09] things because God can then use you and
[1:08:11] brother says I want to be whatever God
[1:08:13] would have me to be I want to be that
[1:08:15] kind of servant that when God calls me
[1:08:17] to do this or to do that I'm available
[1:08:19] to go and I have no guilt on my
[1:08:21] conscience about doing it
[1:08:24] freedom to serve
[1:08:27] so brothers and sisters
[1:08:29] there's only one thing left to do and
[1:08:32] that's live free Galatians 5 it says to
[1:08:36] Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[1:08:37] wherewith Christ hath made us free and
[1:08:40] be not entangled again with the Yoke of
[1:08:43] bondage
[1:08:45] you see that we all have to make a
[1:08:47] decision in our life
[1:08:48] I've had to make it you've had to make
[1:08:50] it if you haven't made it you will have
[1:08:51] to make it
[1:08:54] will you serve God
[1:08:56] or will you go the other way
[1:08:58] like our story this morning will you
[1:08:59] cleave to what God has said what you've
[1:09:01] heard all your life and when you begin
[1:09:03] to nurture it and and nourish that or
[1:09:05] will you turn your back and kiss him
[1:09:06] goodbye
[1:09:09] one thing about it when the decision is
[1:09:11] made
[1:09:13] when you go make that decision to serve
[1:09:15] Christ
[1:09:16] there's no looking back
[1:09:19] you can't look back you can't be in both
[1:09:21] places that's wishy-washy that's
[1:09:23] lukewarm
[1:09:25] and that God spews it out of his mouth
[1:09:28] there was a woman in the Bible you may
[1:09:31] have heard of her her name was Rahab
[1:09:32] anybody heard of Rahab
[1:09:36] you might think of her about her first
[1:09:38] thing you popped in your mind was her
[1:09:40] profession
[1:09:42] right
[1:09:44] yep when I said that name everybody
[1:09:46] thought prostitute harlot
[1:09:49] she made a decision
[1:09:52] this woman Rahab
[1:09:56] she was kind of like the relative that
[1:09:58] we don't want to talk about
[1:10:01] you know when you go to the family your
[1:10:04] family reunions that's the one you never
[1:10:06] bring up
[1:10:08] you don't talk about it
[1:10:10] she's filthy
[1:10:12] she's dirty
[1:10:14] she's living a life of prostitution
[1:10:17] she's found herself as a living as a
[1:10:19] harlot all of her life
[1:10:22] but Joshua sends out some spies
[1:10:26] the Book of Joshua tells us that he sent
[1:10:28] two men secretly it says go spy out the
[1:10:31] land
[1:10:32] and they came to the house of a
[1:10:34] prostitute named Rahab and they lodged
[1:10:37] there
[1:10:38] you see Brothers
[1:10:39] brothels and
[1:10:41] bars and red light districts they were
[1:10:45] reality back then too
[1:10:47] and these men go and they find
[1:10:49] themselves there to go find a place to
[1:10:52] rest their weary bodies
[1:10:55] you see Rahab was known as an Innkeeper
[1:10:58] so she's an Innkeeper well
[1:11:01] kind of like a
[1:11:04] kind of like that story brother Brown
[1:11:05] talks about that little gambling joint
[1:11:07] That was supposed to have been like a
[1:11:08] little restaurant a little cafe that was
[1:11:10] a front
[1:11:12] this was a front
[1:11:14] this was more than an and that Rahab was
[1:11:17] running
[1:11:18] she goes they go in there and they begin
[1:11:20] to to get in there and and and and Rahab
[1:11:23] who says she's the Inn Keeper
[1:11:26] living the life of prostitution now Life
[1:11:29] as a harlot
[1:11:31] she looks at these two spies and God had
[1:11:33] spoken something to her heart
[1:11:38] the prophet didn't stay there
[1:11:41] did you think about that
[1:11:44] the preacher didn't stay there the
[1:11:46] prophet didn't say there
[1:11:48] there was not a man sent from God before
[1:11:50] these two
[1:11:52] so God had spoken to her heart
[1:11:55] and she looked at those two men and she
[1:11:57] said I know that the Lord has given you
[1:11:59] the land
[1:12:01] and the fear has fallen upon us
[1:12:04] and all the inhabitants of the land
[1:12:07] because they will melt away before you
[1:12:11] hmm
[1:12:13] we've hurt
[1:12:16] we have heard my people has heard my
[1:12:19] family has heard how the land how the
[1:12:21] seed dried up into dry land and Moses
[1:12:24] went across with chariots yes
[1:12:29] thousands of people walked across we've
[1:12:31] heard about that
[1:12:32] we've heard about it when the two kings
[1:12:36] of the amorites who were just beyond
[1:12:38] Jordan we had heard how you destroyed
[1:12:40] them
[1:12:44] we've heard this we've heard it in our
[1:12:47] hearts have melted
[1:12:53] um
[1:12:54] can you imagine Rahab as she said there
[1:12:56] and she's talking to these two guys
[1:13:00] and then all of a sudden they hear a
[1:13:03] knock on the door
[1:13:07] nobody can know you're here
[1:13:12] open up Rahab
[1:13:14] we've seen them
[1:13:17] we know you got them
[1:13:21] who you're looking for their spies in
[1:13:24] your house
[1:13:26] there's nobody here
[1:13:28] I don't know what you're talking about
[1:13:31] we saw him come up here we know they're
[1:13:33] here we know you're having business with
[1:13:35] them why are they we want them we want
[1:13:37] them right now
[1:13:39] I don't know what you're talking about
[1:13:40] you can allow you want Rahab you can
[1:13:42] make this up but let me tell you one
[1:13:44] thing we're going to go get more help
[1:13:45] and we're coming back we will find those
[1:13:48] guys
[1:13:51] and can you imagine when the door closed
[1:13:54] and Rahab said hurry
[1:13:57] they're gonna kill you hurry hurry get
[1:14:00] out the window get out the back door go
[1:14:02] down get down but but we want to be able
[1:14:05] to do something for you Rahab you've
[1:14:07] been so good to us you've hit us what
[1:14:08] are we gonna do here
[1:14:16] right here
[1:14:18] yeah
[1:14:20] when The Invasion comes
[1:14:23] you hang that out your window
[1:14:26] and we will tell every man under the
[1:14:28] Army under the nation of God Almighty
[1:14:31] whatever you do don't you touch that
[1:14:34] Scarlet rope because that Scarlet rope
[1:14:37] has been under the blood that Scarlet
[1:14:39] rope has heard from all sin it hides her
[1:14:42] from all iniquity it hides her from all
[1:14:44] transgression and whatever you do don't
[1:14:47] you hurt that odds people
[1:14:49] how does a harlot go from being a harlot
[1:14:52] to God's people
[1:14:55] I don't know but God said it
[1:14:58] it's in his plan
[1:15:02] bear that road that rope hangs outside
[1:15:05] her window
[1:15:09] and because of this because of what Ray
[1:15:11] have it done in her life
[1:15:13] her life will come make a complete
[1:15:15] change a complete 180. she's no longer
[1:15:19] oh we hear her name we call it harlot in
[1:15:21] the Bible
[1:15:22] you know it's even in the book of
[1:15:23] Hebrews in the chapter 11 number 30 and
[1:15:26] verse 31 or something like that I think
[1:15:27] and they have Harley who saved the spies
[1:15:32] you know why she's mentioned as a harlot
[1:15:35] she's mentioned as a harlot not because
[1:15:37] that's what she was
[1:15:39] no it's well or not because that's what
[1:15:41] she is but it's because of what she was
[1:15:43] for Christ came into her life
[1:15:45] and it tells each one of us when we open
[1:15:48] this book it turned to Hebrews chapter
[1:15:50] 11 that no matter how sinful your life
[1:15:53] was no matter what mock admire and no
[1:15:57] matter what distress you found your life
[1:15:59] in
[1:16:00] you're good enough for God
[1:16:02] all you've got to do is accept God and
[1:16:05] hang out the Scarlet Road
[1:16:11] it's not for me to decide if she's too
[1:16:14] filthy
[1:16:15] it's not up to me to decide if you've
[1:16:17] lived too vulgar
[1:16:19] too rough a life
[1:16:21] that's not for me to decide it's for me
[1:16:23] to tell you the word
[1:16:25] and the word says
[1:16:27] that you can be free
[1:16:29] [Music]
[1:16:32] this woman
[1:16:34] getting ready to close now think about
[1:16:36] this this woman
[1:16:38] Rahab her faith in God
[1:16:42] and grafted her into a new family
[1:16:46] rehab soon became into the physical
[1:16:48] family of Israel
[1:16:50] she became the wife of salmon
[1:16:54] one of the leaders of Israel who
[1:16:56] supported Moses when he left Egypt she's
[1:16:58] she's moving up in ranks
[1:17:01] and Rahab and Simone
[1:17:04] you can read about them all through the
[1:17:06] Old and New Testament but this woman who
[1:17:08] had been a harlot became a Godly wife
[1:17:11] a mother in the lineage of Israel
[1:17:17] salmon and Rahab became the parents of a
[1:17:21] little boy named Boaz
[1:17:25] remember him from this morning
[1:17:29] you mean they're the ones that began
[1:17:32] Boaz I know we skipped that a lot in our
[1:17:35] Bibles Flip Flip Flip
[1:17:39] but it's in there you'll find in the
[1:17:41] first chapter of Matthew
[1:17:47] Simone father Boaz by Rahab and Boaz
[1:17:52] fathered Obed by Ruth
[1:17:54] and oh bad father Jesse and Jesse father
[1:17:58] David
[1:18:00] you mean to tell me the great great
[1:18:03] great grandmother
[1:18:06] of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:18:10] Jesus Christ who died on the cross for
[1:18:12] the entire sins of the entire world
[1:18:16] his
[1:18:17] great-grandmother was a prostitute
[1:18:22] um
[1:18:23] don't hear that often do we
[1:18:27] what does that say about how much God
[1:18:29] loves you
[1:18:33] when you look at your life and you say
[1:18:35] there's nothing for me to do there's no
[1:18:37] hope for me I've gone too far I can't
[1:18:39] find myself out of this pickle you know
[1:18:42] we have a family in baseball that's what
[1:18:43] we call it pickle
[1:18:45] as when a runner gets caught between two
[1:18:47] bases and you're trapped
[1:18:50] and this Runner this person's got the
[1:18:52] ball and you're running this way he
[1:18:53] throws it and you run back this way they
[1:18:55] got the ball chasing you they throw it
[1:18:57] and you run back this way you're in a
[1:18:58] pickle how many's ever felt like Satan
[1:19:01] has you in your life end up self running
[1:19:04] here and then you're running this way
[1:19:06] and then you're constantly trying to
[1:19:07] dodge it let me tell you Jesus Christ is
[1:19:11] the answer Jesus Christ remember that
[1:19:14] woman with the scarlet cord
[1:19:16] when you think you're insignificant when
[1:19:18] you think God confuse you when you think
[1:19:21] you've gone too far when you think your
[1:19:22] children have gone too far when you
[1:19:24] think your loved ones will never be able
[1:19:26] to get back in
[1:19:27] you know preachers always want to call
[1:19:29] talk about that Mercy line
[1:19:32] that's not made to judge
[1:19:34] there is a line where you cross that you
[1:19:36] can't come back
[1:19:38] but there's also a place called Calvary
[1:19:41] they can completely transform your life
[1:19:44] and that's where Rahab was remember the
[1:19:47] Scarlet cool brother Adam said also I
[1:19:49] remember red in the Bible is a covering
[1:19:52] red is an atonement red is safety
[1:19:58] safe behind the Scarlet
[1:20:01] red he said Remember the Harlot Rahab
[1:20:04] let the spies down on that red string to
[1:20:06] safety there's always safety under red
[1:20:12] the blood is red you take your
[1:20:15] scientific research take a red piece of
[1:20:17] cellophane and look through it through a
[1:20:19] red piece of cellophane at red letters
[1:20:20] and it's white
[1:20:22] you take red through red it's white
[1:20:25] he said well no wrongdoings are read
[1:20:28] though your sins be like Scarlet though
[1:20:30] through the shed blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:33] God is looking through their red looking
[1:20:36] through red that bumper
[1:20:39] thank God for the bumper tonight
[1:20:43] there is your righteousness
[1:20:46] he'll never see it
[1:20:49] your good works he'll never know it
[1:20:52] until you come beneath the blood then he
[1:20:54] sees you as his own
[1:20:56] beloved Son
[1:20:58] or daughter
[1:21:00] there's your answer to Rahab
[1:21:03] her sins which were many
[1:21:08] though her sins be like Scarlet
[1:21:11] he looked down and said I don't see
[1:21:14] nothing but a grandmother in my lineage
[1:21:18] can you imagine
[1:21:20] God's good to us you love the Lord
[1:21:23] tonight

[1:21:41] remember this it changed her from a
[1:21:43] woman of the night

[1:22:03] take home words that can glean from Lord
[1:22:06] that will just help us to recognize who
[1:22:08] we are and what that blood covering has
[1:22:10] done for us in our lives and how that
[1:22:12] blood covering Keeps Us close father and
