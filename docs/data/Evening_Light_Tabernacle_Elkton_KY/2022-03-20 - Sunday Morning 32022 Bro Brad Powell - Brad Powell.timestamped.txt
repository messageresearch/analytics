[18:31] and uh
[18:32] some of you have watched brother barry's
[18:35] update on ukraine of different things
[18:36] and we tried about five times before we
[18:39] got the play through
[18:41] every time he would start reverting back
[18:43] to the very start and
[18:45] it would just quit and
[18:47] i told janet i said well it's just at
[18:49] the end of me he doesn't want us to hear
[18:51] what what needs to be said so i said
[18:54] we'll just keep on we'll be you know

[18:58] and brother barry began to give a couple
[19:00] of testimonies and he asked that we'd
[19:02] remember those saints and there's some
[19:04] that came out and he went and talked to
[19:07] some of them but he was talking about
[19:09] how that one of the believers over there
[19:10] and
[19:13] a big bomb dropped in their backyard
[19:15] they said it was a very large bomb and
[19:18] said it didn't go out didn't go off
[19:21] said our god is able to defuse do
[19:24] anything he needs to take care of his
[19:25] children this morning

[19:31] we have been truly blessed
[19:33] we live in a such a wonderful country
[19:34] that and as we see it go downhill it
[19:37] tears our heart apart
[19:39] but we're thankful for what god has
[19:41] allowed us and where he's allowed us to
[19:43] be born and why those people couldn't
[19:46] been born here i don't know why all of
[19:48] his bride couldn't i don't know that
[19:50] but he's got his children in his hand
[19:52] and there's not one thing going to
[19:53] happen to any of them

[20:15] and he said she said they didn't know
[20:17] within the next minute they were going
[20:19] to kill every one of them
[20:21] and we were me and jan were sitting
[20:23] there riding i thought
[20:25] she said that just gives me cold chill

[42:06] so
[42:07] uh
[42:08] i it's one of my favorite stories that
[42:10] the prophet tells and and i think it
[42:11] just types so well
[42:13] uh of what we're looking for in in the
[42:15] hour we're looking for and it's just a
[42:17] simple story he told and he was talking
[42:18] about how he was nervous and he was he'd
[42:21] been out on the field and he was just
[42:22] nervous and couldn't sleep and
[42:24] uh he he bent up and
[42:27] i think about around one o'clock in the
[42:29] morning he said he got up and set out in
[42:31] his chair in the living room and he was
[42:33] just meditating on things that was
[42:35] coming you know and things that he'd
[42:36] been through and and all along about
[42:38] daylight he said he was sitting there
[42:40] and
[42:40] and
[42:42] thinking about things and all of a
[42:43] sudden he heard
[42:44] uh from the girls room his daughters he
[42:46] heard a little rustling going on
[42:49] and
[42:50] next thing you know he said he looked up
[42:51] becky had woke up and she she thought to
[42:54] herself it's daylight daddy must be home
[42:56] so she jumped up woke up her little
[42:58] sister sarah
[43:00] and said that uh
[43:01] becky he said she was kind of a skinny
[43:03] long-legged thing and she come running
[43:05] through the room and sarah was shorter
[43:07] and young and he said she was just a
[43:09] kind of a toddler type and becky come
[43:12] running real fast she could outrun her
[43:14] and said becky jumped up in his lap
[43:16] and set a straddle of him and jumped up
[43:19] in there and was hugging on him and
[43:20] loving on him and
[43:22] thrown her arms around his neck and and
[43:24] he said you know how that makes your
[43:25] heart feel
[43:26] and uh he said there was come little
[43:28] sarah traipsing along
[43:30] uh you know in her hand-me-downs and
[43:33] said she was short and those little legs
[43:35] was sticking out over her feet and i
[43:37] could just imagine this going on in the
[43:39] house you know you see your youngest one
[43:40] come trying to catch up with big sister
[43:42] and can't catch up and the little feet
[43:44] you know the legs longer than her feet
[43:46] in their pajamas and
[43:48] and he said he he looked down there and
[43:51] becky looked up there and she was
[43:53] wanting to try to come and get up there
[43:54] and she was stumbling and falling
[43:57] and he said that she finally got there
[43:59] and
[44:00] and becky looked around and said sarah
[44:02] my sister i want to tell you something
[44:04] i was here
[44:06] first got all of daddy and there's
[44:09] nothing left for you
[44:12] he said a little sarah's lip dropped and
[44:14] drooped and the little tears began to
[44:16] well up in her bright brown eyes and i
[44:18] began to water
[44:20] and he said he stuck his other leg out
[44:22] and he said she looked up and he he kind
[44:24] of pulled her up there and she climbed
[44:26] up there like she was saddling a horse
[44:28] you know and she was about to fall off
[44:30] both sides she's too young to have her
[44:32] balance and legs wasn't long enough to
[44:34] touch the floor and toddling around you
[44:37] know and she looks up and says rebecca
[44:39] my sister
[44:40] i want to tell you something
[44:42] it's true that you've got all of daddy
[44:45] but i want you to know daddy's got all
[44:47] of me
[44:49] and i thought what an hour we're living
[44:51] in
[44:52] if we could just get so wrapped up
[44:55] and let him wrap us up
[44:57] take the story and combine it let's wrap
[44:59] up to jesus and let him wrap us up
[45:02] what have we got to fear
[45:04] and i thought man that's such a such a
[45:06] good story there and i just i've always
[45:08] loved that story and and it goes kind of
[45:10] along with what we're going to talk
[45:11] about here in a minute if you would turn
[45:13] with me into the book of matthew
[45:15] and we'll go to chapter 25
[45:27] i'm going to read from two very familiar
[45:29] places here and
[45:30] gonna kind of expound on them and try to
[45:32] maybe take a little bit of a history
[45:34] lesson learn a little bit about customs
[45:36] and
[45:37] and some of the procedures and and why
[45:39] the
[45:39] why jesus spoke the way he spoke and why
[45:42] he typed things the way he typed and why
[45:44] the message of the hour types things the
[45:46] way it types
[45:48] and it all we'll see it all lines up
[45:50] matthew 25
[45:52] verse 1
[45:54] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[45:55] likened unto ten virgins which took
[45:58] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[45:59] bridegroom
[46:01] and five of them were wise and five were
[46:04] foolish
[46:05] they that were foolish took their lamps
[46:07] and took no oil with them but the wise
[46:10] took oil in their vessels with their
[46:12] lamps
[46:13] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[46:15] slumbered and slept
[46:17] and at midnight there was a cry made
[46:20] behold the bridegroom cometh
[46:23] go ye out to meet him
[46:25] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[46:28] their lamps and the foolish said unto
[46:30] the wise give us of your oil for our
[46:32] lamps are gone out
[46:34] but the wise answered saying not so lest
[46:37] there be not enough for us and you bego
[46:40] ye rather to them that sell and buy for
[46:42] yourselves
[46:44] and while they went to buy the
[46:46] bridegroom came
[46:47] and they
[46:49] that were ready went in with him to the
[46:51] marriage
[46:53] but watch what happens next and the door
[46:55] was shut
[46:58] afterward came also the other virgin
[47:00] saying lord lord
[47:02] open to us but he answered and said
[47:04] verily i say unto you i
[47:07] know you
[47:08] not genesis chapter 7 quickly if you
[47:11] would
[47:16] genesis
[47:19] and we'll look at
[47:21] verse 13.
[47:28] give you a minute to get there
[47:31] chapter 7 verse 13.
[47:34] in the self-same day entered noah and
[47:37] sham and ham and japeth the sons of noah
[47:40] and noah's wife and the three wives of
[47:42] his son with him into the ark
[47:45] they in every beast after his kind and
[47:47] all the cattle after their kind and
[47:48] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[47:50] the earth after his kind
[47:52] and every fowl after his kind and every
[47:54] bird
[47:55] of every sort
[47:57] and they went into
[47:59] and they went in unto noah into the ark
[48:02] two and two of all flesh wherein
[48:05] is the breath of life and they that went
[48:08] in one female of all flesh as god had
[48:11] commanded them and what happened and the
[48:14] lord shut him in
[48:17] and the flood was 40 days upon the earth
[48:19] and the waters increased and bear up the
[48:22] ark and it was lifted above the earth i
[48:25] want to speak this morning if we could
[48:27] for just a few minutes on the hour of
[48:28] preparation the hour of preparation
[48:31] let's just bow our heads
[48:33] heavenly father we come before you this
[48:35] morning with thankful hearts lord
[48:36] thankful to be able to assemble this
[48:39] morning
[48:40] and to come and feast around your word
[48:42] to hear the word and trust the lord that
[48:44] you're going to speak to every heart
[48:46] that's here and we're so thankful for
[48:48] that lord as we come to you this morning
[48:50] we lift up our pastor once again that he
[48:52] would get to be feeling well
[48:55] that all symptoms would subside lord and
[48:57] that he would get back on his feet and
[48:58] ready to preach the gospel
[49:01] lord back to with power and authority
[49:04] lord we just want to tell you lord we we
[49:06] love you we appreciate you we thank you
[49:08] for all you do for us we dedicate this
[49:10] service
[49:12] to you lord jesus just to bring honor
[49:14] and glory to you and to draw us closer
[49:17] to you
[49:18] we love you lord with all of our hearts
[49:20] in jesus name we pray amen you can be
[49:22] seated
[49:26] i think that
[49:28] i think it's kind of allergy seasons
[49:29] getting kicked up a little early this
[49:31] year and sinuses and i've noticed i've
[49:33] had a little cough and and so forth so
[49:35] may have to bear with me a time or two
[49:39] but i think that uh paul said it best in
[49:41] second corinthians 11 there and he said
[49:44] for i am jealous over you with a godly
[49:46] jealousy for i've espoused you to one
[49:48] husband that i may present you as chaste
[49:51] virgin
[49:52] to christ
[49:54] and as we look at these scriptures this
[49:55] morning i want to take just a few
[49:56] minutes and examine the parables
[49:59] of the 10 virgins and i want to look at
[50:01] noah and and the ark and the situation
[50:04] it happened there because both of these
[50:05] stories i feel like either
[50:07] point us to repentance acceptance
[50:10] holiness but more importantly than that
[50:12] these both point us to preparedness and
[50:15] we're living in an hour that as
[50:17] christians we have to be prepared we're
[50:19] living in an hour when preparations have
[50:21] to be made and and and we we see that
[50:24] it's more than just being around the
[50:25] church
[50:26] we see that it's more than just hearing
[50:28] the word it's more than just knowing the
[50:30] rituals or the plans but it's about
[50:33] living a life that is completely
[50:35] surrendered and prepared in christ
[50:38] because even in life
[50:40] we have to be prepared we have to take
[50:43] uh in order to be successful in life i
[50:45] should say we have to be prepared
[50:48] our children when they go to school when
[50:49] they have a test coming up we have to
[50:52] prepare the children right we have to go
[50:54] through the spelling words and they
[50:55] write them and they do over and over and
[50:57] they go through the math problems over
[50:59] and over we're getting them prepared for
[51:01] the situation that's to come at hand in
[51:03] life as adults you go through times that
[51:05] you maybe you have to go through a job
[51:07] interview maybe you have to write papers
[51:09] maybe you have to give speeches there's
[51:11] times in your life as an adult that
[51:13] you're going to have to make
[51:14] preparations if you're going to be
[51:15] successful i don't think there's anybody
[51:18] that would go to a major job interview
[51:20] and not be thinking about or prepare
[51:22] yourself for the questions that may come
[51:24] at you
[51:27] or the things that you might want to say
[51:28] the things you would want to emphasize
[51:30] you want to be prepared in life and
[51:33] we're in open hour that we have to be
[51:35] prepared brother brandon was talking
[51:37] about the watchman up in the tower and
[51:40] he says i feel that great holy spirit
[51:42] today is the same as the watchman that
[51:44] was in the tower in the beginning that
[51:46] holy spirit that tells us be ready be
[51:48] ready be prepared
[51:50] commit yourself and be ready for what's
[51:52] to come at hand he says that great holy
[51:55] spirit sitting up there as the watchman
[51:57] in the tower he said he's still the
[51:59] warning voice that speaks prepare to
[52:02] meet thy god
[52:05] every time he said you see a gray hair
[52:10] it's something telling you to prepare to
[52:12] meet your god
[52:14] he said every time you see an ambulance
[52:16] going down the road it's something
[52:18] telling you prepare to meet your god
[52:22] every time you go by a graveyard it's a
[52:24] sign that you've got to prepare to meet
[52:26] your god he said prepare now before
[52:30] because the hour is approaching
[52:33] now brothers and sisters we look at
[52:34] these 10 virgins that we just read about
[52:38] living in a day when they should have
[52:40] been prepared
[52:44] they are quiet this morning but you're
[52:46] listening
[52:47] these 10 virgins should have been
[52:49] prepared because they knew what was
[52:51] about to take place
[52:54] there was no surprise in what was going
[52:56] to happen
[53:01] but what we find is
[53:05] only half
[53:09] it was this many
[53:11] but this many
[53:13] actually believed
[53:14] what they heard
[53:18] only five had actually set back and and
[53:20] actually took to heart the message of
[53:22] the hour that went out and the
[53:23] seriousness and the level of dedication
[53:25] that was needed to enter into that
[53:27] marriage feast
[53:28] and there was only one way to enter into
[53:30] this feast
[53:36] are you with me
[53:38] and we see the common theme of jesus's
[53:40] teaching is centered around weddings
[53:44] and we think about the wedding of canaan
[53:46] of galilee we remember john the baptist
[53:48] he called himself the bridegroom who's
[53:50] going to introduce the ground the groom
[53:52] at the wedding feast
[53:54] we see the wedding parable where the
[53:56] king is announcing the and invited
[53:58] people to come to the wedding feast for
[53:59] his son
[54:00] and now we see this wedding parable
[54:03] concerning the five wise and the five
[54:05] foolish
[54:07] so we're going to have this little
[54:08] history lesson and look at these
[54:11] 10 virgins at this feast because in
[54:13] order to understand the wedding parable
[54:15] we need to look at the customs of the
[54:17] wedding feast jesus day as they were
[54:19] just a little bit different than ours
[54:23] america most in most places around the
[54:25] world
[54:27] we see a young man a young lady
[54:30] they'll see each other maybe there's
[54:31] something that attracts to one another
[54:33] their eyes catch one another and they
[54:34] find an attraction there
[54:36] and this attraction takes place and the
[54:38] two begin to feel a pull towards one
[54:41] another
[54:42] and they feel this pull towards one
[54:44] another and they begin to go uh over
[54:47] time this courtship takes place and they
[54:49] get to know each other better and better
[54:51] and better until they get to talking a
[54:53] little bit
[54:54] most of us have been there they get to
[54:56] talking a little bit and then try to
[54:58] decide should we get married
[55:00] it's more of a mutual thing most of the
[55:02] time right
[55:04] every now and then i guess there's one
[55:06] romeo that just pops the question out of
[55:07] the blue
[55:08] but most of the time it's a it's an
[55:10] agreed upon thing
[55:13] and so customarily they talk about this
[55:15] until this formal engagement takes place
[55:17] where usually the man will go and he'll
[55:19] propose to the lady
[55:22] and at that time
[55:24] it all sets in motion right
[55:27] everything is set in motion for the
[55:29] wedding to come there's what's the first
[55:30] thing people say what day is it
[55:34] when you're getting married have you set
[55:36] a date
[55:39] everybody wants to know what that date
[55:40] is because nobody wants to miss the
[55:42] wedding date
[55:44] everybody wants to be there at the
[55:46] wedding and nobody wants to miss it so
[55:48] they put it on their calendars and
[55:49] that's a big difference from what the
[55:50] wedding arrangement was for back then
[55:53] their wedding arrangement was quite
[55:55] different
[55:56] it was a ranged marriage from the
[55:58] families of the groom and the bride
[56:00] and over there in galilee the people of
[56:02] one village
[56:04] a lot of times they were closely related
[56:07] and you know everybody knew everybody
[56:09] everybody was kind of family
[56:10] so in order to prevent
[56:13] genetic defects and faults they would go
[56:15] out into the village next door
[56:17] they were trying to prevent cousins and
[56:19] cousins and aunts and nephews and
[56:22] you could imagine
[56:24] so it's customary for them to go out
[56:26] into the other villages
[56:27] and they're looking out there and so
[56:29] this practice had to bring around some
[56:31] cooperation between villages right
[56:34] and they go out there into these
[56:35] villages and so when a son come of age
[56:38] his father would take him to another
[56:40] village to find this bride
[56:43] and as he's going out into the village
[56:44] and he's searching out to try to find
[56:46] this pride
[56:48] he's looking and he's trying to see and
[56:50] so he says hey i kind of like this this
[56:52] lady right here i like this family right
[56:54] here
[56:55] at that time the negotiations will begin
[56:57] to take place between the father of the
[56:59] bride
[57:01] and the father of the groom
[57:04] and these preparations begin to take
[57:06] place in these negotiations and they
[57:07] begin to talk about it and they become
[57:08] on an agreement
[57:10] and they seal it with the oath of a
[57:12] handshake and a cup of wine
[57:14] a little bit different than
[57:16] what we're used to right
[57:19] so now they have come to a place in
[57:21] their life
[57:22] where these two are engaged
[57:25] this young man this young woman has now
[57:26] become engaged from two different
[57:28] villages
[57:30] and as they're sitting there engaged
[57:33] the marriage couldn't be consummated
[57:35] until the son goes and builds a room
[57:38] onto his father's house
[57:40] where the bride could live
[57:43] are you with me
[57:44] so the groom had to leave
[57:47] his bride
[57:50] and he tells her i'm going to go and
[57:51] prepare a place for you
[57:54] and we see the very same thing as jesus
[57:57] comforts the disciples in saint john let
[57:59] your heart not be troubled you believe
[58:01] in god you also and me and my father's
[58:03] house are many mansions
[58:05] his brothers maybe maybe different ones
[58:07] and he's typing it back so they can
[58:09] understand what's happening with this
[58:11] marriage supper
[58:12] in my father's house or many mansions if
[58:14] it were not slow i would have told you i
[58:16] go to prepare a place for you
[58:20] and he said and if i go to prepare this
[58:22] place for you
[58:25] i will come again and receive you unto
[58:28] myself that where i am you may be also
[58:31] and whether ye i know you know the way
[58:34] imagine this conversation
[58:38] it's just like that of the young man and
[58:40] the young woman
[58:42] as this young man and this young woman's
[58:44] parents have come to agreement this
[58:46] young man looks at her says listen
[58:48] i'm gonna go and i'm gonna build you a
[58:50] place
[58:52] i'm gonna go build you a home like
[58:54] you've never seen before it's gonna take
[58:56] me a little while
[58:58] i'm gonna be gone but i promise you i
[59:01] will come back and i'm gonna bring you
[59:03] into my place
[59:07] we're living right now
[59:10] waiting to go to that place
[59:13] there's a place that's being prepared
[59:15] over for us there's a place that jesus
[59:17] promised us i will come again and i'm
[59:20] going to bring you unto myself so while
[59:22] the groom is out building this home
[59:26] the groom is out building this home
[59:28] the engaged bride's duty is to be ready
[59:33] plain and simple that's all she has to
[59:35] do is to be ready she has to be ready
[59:38] when her groom comes back to claim her
[59:41] she has to be ready
[59:43] this may take a year
[59:47] it may take a year and a half
[59:50] it may take a it may take six months who
[59:52] knows how long this will take but during
[59:54] this time she's going to go through the
[59:56] process of preparation for the wedding
[59:59] and during this time she has to choose
[1:00:01] bridesmaids to accompany her
[1:00:05] in this situation we're talking about
[1:00:07] she picks ten
[1:00:09] bridemaids
[1:00:12] must have been a pretty wealthy fella
[1:00:17] more bridesmaids more wealth more money
[1:00:20] more cost
[1:00:23] but here we have 10 bridesmaids
[1:00:27] and then this right here her garments
[1:00:30] had to be prepared
[1:00:33] am i going too slow too fast are you
[1:00:35] with me
[1:00:37] all right
[1:00:39] her garments had to be prepared
[1:00:40] revelations 19 7 8 says let us rejoice
[1:00:43] and be glad and give the glory to him
[1:00:46] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:00:48] and his bride has made herself
[1:00:51] ready
[1:00:52] and it was given to her to clothe
[1:00:54] herself and find linen bright and clean
[1:00:58] for the fine linen is the righteous
[1:01:01] of the saints
[1:01:04] but i want you to remember now
[1:01:06] this bride
[1:01:08] didn't have a set date
[1:01:13] there was no set date of when this
[1:01:15] marriage was going to take place
[1:01:18] all they knew is he promised i'm going
[1:01:19] to come back
[1:01:21] i'm going to build you a place and i
[1:01:24] will come back
[1:01:26] so she didn't know exactly when the
[1:01:27] groom would return
[1:01:29] only the only thing she knew is that the
[1:01:31] groom would turn return when he had
[1:01:33] everything set in order
[1:01:36] so the bride and this entire village
[1:01:44] so the bride and the entire church
[1:01:48] had to be ready
[1:01:53] now i can imagine
[1:01:57] that the word of his coming must have
[1:02:00] went before the caravan
[1:02:05] now they didn't have the kind of news
[1:02:06] we've got they didn't have cell phones
[1:02:08] they didn't have computers they didn't
[1:02:10] have email
[1:02:11] they didn't have text message
[1:02:14] but you know this guy probably got ready
[1:02:15] to pack his bags he's packing his camel
[1:02:18] he's packing his stuff up and people
[1:02:19] probably say where you going john
[1:02:22] where are you going bill
[1:02:23] [Music]
[1:02:24] i got to go get my bride
[1:02:27] when are you leaving
[1:02:28] three days
[1:02:30] hey you know john's headed down there to
[1:02:32] get go get his bride
[1:02:35] did you know did you know that he's
[1:02:37] fixing to go out there the caravan's
[1:02:38] fixing the leg and they're whispering in
[1:02:39] each other's ears trying to get the word
[1:02:41] out and before you know it the word gets
[1:02:43] there to the next village
[1:02:46] so now the bride is in anticipation the
[1:02:49] word has went forth
[1:02:52] and the bride finds herself in great
[1:02:54] anticipation
[1:02:58] and no doubt as the groom begins to
[1:03:00] enter into the city
[1:03:04] the groom is entering into the city
[1:03:07] and his
[1:03:09] best man accompanying the group
[1:03:11] when he gets there he begins to blow a
[1:03:13] trumpet
[1:03:21] can you imagine what that bride must
[1:03:22] have felt
[1:03:27] as a trumpet sounds and he announces the
[1:03:30] arrival of the groom
[1:03:32] make yourself known the groom is coming
[1:03:39] and upon arrival this trumpet sounds the
[1:03:42] announcements made it awakens who the
[1:03:45] sleepers
[1:03:47] it awakens the sleepers it awakens those
[1:03:50] that were slumbering and sleeping and
[1:03:51] brothers and sisters we've heard the
[1:03:53] trumpet for our day
[1:03:55] the sound has went forth there shall be
[1:03:58] nobody sleeping in our camp
[1:04:01] there should be nobody unprepared in the
[1:04:04] church
[1:04:06] if you're unprepared it's your own fault
[1:04:09] and we'll see as we look at these these
[1:04:11] 10 virgins we'll see the difference here
[1:04:13] because the midnight cry has been made
[1:04:16] that trumpet when it sounded the entire
[1:04:18] wedding party the village they had to be
[1:04:20] ready to follow him back as he come and
[1:04:23] got his blood
[1:04:26] so the groove has come down the trumpet
[1:04:29] is sound the words went out the
[1:04:30] announcements made he's here to take her
[1:04:33] home
[1:04:34] and he goes into the village and he gets
[1:04:37] a hold of his little bride
[1:04:41] and the whole village begins to get
[1:04:43] ready to follow the bridegroom back to
[1:04:45] his village
[1:04:49] you see this world is not our home
[1:04:54] where that bride lived that was not
[1:04:56] truly her home
[1:04:58] because he had went and built her a
[1:05:00] place he had went and built a mansion a
[1:05:02] place prepared for her
[1:05:04] so he has to realize this is not my home
[1:05:06] anymore he's come back for me
[1:05:10] and these
[1:05:11] uh bridesmaids
[1:05:13] it's their
[1:05:15] job to be able to prepare the way as
[1:05:17] they head back to the village
[1:05:20] so their job is to be ready to lead this
[1:05:22] this procession this wedding procession
[1:05:24] back to the village
[1:05:26] to where he lived
[1:05:28] so they come through here day or night
[1:05:30] they have to be ready so if the groom
[1:05:32] comes at night they've got to light
[1:05:33] their torches their little lanterns
[1:05:34] they've gotta light those so that the
[1:05:37] path could be clear of where we're going
[1:05:39] we're going to the marriage supper
[1:05:40] here's how you get there here's the
[1:05:42] light we're gonna light the way for you
[1:05:44] brother sisters the way has been lit for
[1:05:46] us
[1:05:50] can you imagine
[1:05:53] the difficulty
[1:05:55] of being ready for this kind of wedding
[1:05:57] procession
[1:06:01] maybe i should put it this
[1:06:02] way you are living with the difficulty
[1:06:06] of being ready for this wedding
[1:06:08] procession
[1:06:11] remember no date
[1:06:14] no date
[1:06:16] and trying to live with daily
[1:06:17] distractions
[1:06:19] these tens were these ten virgins were
[1:06:21] distracted
[1:06:23] but five of them were
[1:06:25] not
[1:06:26] prepared
[1:06:28] they had jobs
[1:06:30] they worked they uh uh places to be
[1:06:33] places to go
[1:06:35] just like you and i we work we have
[1:06:37] families we have uh homes we have to
[1:06:39] take care of does all this sound
[1:06:40] familiar
[1:06:41] but yet you got to be prepared when that
[1:06:43] trumpet said when the bridegroom comes
[1:06:45] you better be ready your all better be
[1:06:47] full and your cruise of oil better be
[1:06:49] full
[1:06:55] so the announcements was made
[1:06:59] this groom has come
[1:07:01] and they knew he was coming
[1:07:04] but it seemed a little bit overdue
[1:07:08] so here they are sleeping and slumbering
[1:07:11] in this parable
[1:07:13] they seem to think that that it would be
[1:07:15] that very night because they were ready
[1:07:16] like i said the word had traveled before
[1:07:18] the caravan
[1:07:19] and no
[1:07:21] point is the bride's maid should have
[1:07:23] known that they had enough oil
[1:07:26] and what we need to make sure of is that
[1:07:28] we've got enough of the holy spirit
[1:07:31] we need to make sure in this hour we're
[1:07:33] living in that we have enough of the
[1:07:34] holy spirit
[1:07:36] that leads us and guides us and prepares
[1:07:39] us and gets us to a place that we're
[1:07:41] dedicated before god that there is no
[1:07:44] question when he comes whether or not
[1:07:46] i'm going to be able to see the way
[1:07:53] let me tell you it doesn't
[1:07:54] matter what denomination a person's from
[1:07:57] you know that's a that's a
[1:08:00] that's something that we get tagged with
[1:08:03] that were isolators
[1:08:08] i don't look at us as isolators
[1:08:11] i look at us as
[1:08:13] prepared being filled with the holy
[1:08:15] ghost
[1:08:17] i looked up this
[1:08:20] a little quote i was looking for and i
[1:08:21] was trying to find i couldn't find it in
[1:08:23] the in the message and i knew it was
[1:08:25] there and i was digging and digging so i
[1:08:27] typed it into google
[1:08:30] and the quote was on wikipedia
[1:08:34] and they tag us as isolators
[1:08:37] but only we are the only ones that can
[1:08:39] go because we're the only ones that can
[1:08:41] ever have the holy spirit
[1:08:43] if that's our way of thinking we're
[1:08:44] wrong
[1:08:46] because the holy spirit is free out
[1:08:49] there for anybody that will have it
[1:08:51] the holy spirit is out there it doesn't
[1:08:53] matter what denomination you're from
[1:08:56] it matters what is on the inside of us
[1:09:00] these 10 virgins they had a little
[1:09:02] crucible five of them had it what was
[1:09:05] that that was a special place in their
[1:09:07] heart
[1:09:08] that's a special place in our heart
[1:09:10] where the holy spirit dwells
[1:09:12] and they had this little cruise and
[1:09:14] brother brown said now watch all of them
[1:09:16] were holy
[1:09:19] all of them were holy they had to be
[1:09:22] sanctified
[1:09:23] because that's the only cleansing a holy
[1:09:25] strain that god had is sanctification
[1:09:28] now watch all 10 of them were sanctified
[1:09:32] but five didn't have any oil in their
[1:09:34] lamp and five had oil in their lamp what
[1:09:37] does the old represent
[1:09:40] he said now it's not the purity of the
[1:09:43] virgins
[1:09:47] the whole story people want to get hung
[1:09:49] up on the virgins
[1:09:50] they want to get hung up on the life
[1:09:52] that those virgins was living and
[1:09:54] there's truth to that but the whole
[1:09:56] story it revolves around the oil because
[1:09:59] the oil represents the holy spirit so we
[1:10:02] can't focus on just what the virgins did
[1:10:04] or their works or their goodness
[1:10:06] a lot of times people want to get hung
[1:10:08] up on works and goodness and what i did
[1:10:10] for the church what i did for the gospel
[1:10:11] what i did for the message
[1:10:14] but you better make sure that you've got
[1:10:15] the old
[1:10:16] because all 10 of them were virgins all
[1:10:19] 10 of them were pure all 10 of them were
[1:10:21] just as clean living as could be
[1:10:25] but five
[1:10:26] had the oil
[1:10:30] there's not a church on earth that can
[1:10:32] live any more pure
[1:10:35] than the nazarene
[1:10:36] now listen to this
[1:10:38] he said in their teaching pilgrim
[1:10:40] holiness in them that's right they
[1:10:42] absolutely believe in the purity of
[1:10:44] sanctification
[1:10:45] their women don't wear rings or jewelry
[1:10:47] or anything
[1:10:49] purity sanctification
[1:10:51] every way they believe it
[1:10:53] the holiness organizations
[1:10:56] all
[1:10:57] the legalists
[1:10:59] that's their teaching they believe it
[1:11:00] holy holy holy holy he
[1:11:03] exclamations it
[1:11:04] women
[1:11:06] wear long hair long skirts man they're
[1:11:08] not even supposed to roll up their
[1:11:10] sleeves
[1:11:12] they don't smoke they don't drink they
[1:11:13] don't do none of that holy you couldn't
[1:11:16] live any cleaner
[1:11:20] but
[1:11:22] listen now but that same nazarene church
[1:11:25] if a man would speak in tongues in the
[1:11:28] church
[1:11:29] he'd be shot out the door
[1:11:33] he said they say they wouldn't even sit
[1:11:36] with one
[1:11:37] he said if you don't believe it try it
[1:11:39] find out
[1:11:40] find it out once they hate the very
[1:11:42] thoughts of it they say it's the devil
[1:11:44] but in my bible it says on the day of
[1:11:46] pentecost
[1:11:48] there was a upper room experience where
[1:11:50] there was 120 people and the
[1:11:52] the the the russian mighty wind came in
[1:11:55] and consumed over those people and the
[1:11:57] fire fell down and there was a holy
[1:11:58] globe and in that one they uttered
[1:12:00] unknown tongues
[1:12:02] but in the utterance of those unknown
[1:12:04] times everybody knew what everybody was
[1:12:06] saying
[1:12:07] and they were astonished
[1:12:10] so why is it people think because we
[1:12:12] believe in the gift of the holy ghost we
[1:12:14] believe in speaking in tongues and the
[1:12:16] gift of the holy holy ghost
[1:12:19] why is it people think we're standoffish
[1:12:21] or isolators
[1:12:26] it's just a sign of the old
[1:12:30] listen now
[1:12:32] all ten of them were virgins five was
[1:12:34] wise and had oil in their lamp another
[1:12:36] five was just as pure and holy but they
[1:12:38] had no wool
[1:12:40] they were sanctified without the holy
[1:12:42] ghost
[1:12:43] first john 5 and 7 says
[1:12:46] three that bear record in heaven father
[1:12:48] son and holy ghost these three are one
[1:12:50] but but there's three that bear record
[1:12:52] on earth water blood and spirit they're
[1:12:55] not all one but they agree as one
[1:12:58] you can't have the father
[1:13:01] without having the son
[1:13:04] you can't have the holy ghost would have
[1:13:06] it without having the father son and
[1:13:08] holy ghost they're one they're
[1:13:09] inseparable
[1:13:12] but you could be justified without being
[1:13:14] sanctified
[1:13:17] now we're getting to the topic
[1:13:20] you can be justified without being
[1:13:22] sanctified
[1:13:23] you can be sanctified without having the
[1:13:25] holy ghost
[1:13:26] be clean you live the pure life and you
[1:13:29] have a form of godliness but deny the
[1:13:31] power of healing and speaking in tongues
[1:13:33] and the great gifts of god
[1:13:34] and every one of them in there
[1:13:37] and one of the best examples and the
[1:13:39] easiest way for me to ever understand
[1:13:41] this when i was younger
[1:13:43] and i think this is a great way to
[1:13:44] explain it to young people is when
[1:13:46] brother brown said you know there's a
[1:13:47] glass laying out in a hull pen or a
[1:13:50] chicken pen
[1:13:51] and he said you go out there and you get
[1:13:53] that glass
[1:13:54] and you pick it up
[1:13:56] that's justification
[1:14:00] but it's still been laying in the hog
[1:14:02] pin
[1:14:03] it's still dirty
[1:14:05] [Music]
[1:14:06] it's not clean yet
[1:14:08] and he said you've got it in your hand
[1:14:10] you just can't use it yet
[1:14:12] that glass needs to be cleaned
[1:14:15] he said so then you take it and you wash
[1:14:17] it you sterilize it you boil it you take
[1:14:20] all the germs out of it and that's what
[1:14:22] god does through sanctification
[1:14:26] he picks us up and he looks at us and he
[1:14:28] says you're dirty
[1:14:29] [Applause]
[1:14:31] you're filthy
[1:14:33] i'm going to clean you up i'm going to
[1:14:35] sanctify you i'm going to make you worth
[1:14:38] using
[1:14:40] and so he takes it he takes the desire
[1:14:42] of sin out of her heart he cleans us up
[1:14:44] and next thing you know we're a
[1:14:45] candidate he says for a feeling of the
[1:14:48] holy ghost
[1:14:53] sanctify means to be cleaned and set
[1:14:55] aside for service
[1:14:58] he said so in the old testament he said
[1:15:00] the altar sanctified the vessels and
[1:15:02] cleanse it and set it aside
[1:15:05] not in service
[1:15:06] not in service
[1:15:08] but set aside for service
[1:15:12] and so now we've got this glass that was
[1:15:14] dirty and filthy it's been picked up
[1:15:16] it's been justified i know who you are i
[1:15:19] know what you are he's cleaned it he's
[1:15:21] taken all the dirty and the filth and
[1:15:23] the sin out of its life now i'm ready to
[1:15:25] use you so i'm going to set it aside now
[1:15:27] what do we have to have he says the holy
[1:15:30] spirit comes in and fills that vessel
[1:15:32] until it's bubbling over and over
[1:15:35] running
[1:15:38] now you're in
[1:15:40] service for the lord
[1:15:43] now you're in service for the lord so
[1:15:45] brothers and sisters think about that
[1:15:47] glass
[1:15:48] we have to find ourselves accepting the
[1:15:50] holy spirit you can't go without it
[1:15:53] you can be picked up
[1:15:55] you can be cleaned but without the holy
[1:15:58] ghost you're not going to go in the
[1:16:00] rapture
[1:16:02] i should've had a whole lot more amen
[1:16:03] there
[1:16:06] because that's what's happening right
[1:16:07] now people's denying that
[1:16:09] around the world
[1:16:11] here's your five virgins he said who had
[1:16:13] the old rapture in faith they believe in
[1:16:15] all the signs the wonders the prophecies
[1:16:17] and everything
[1:16:18] he said and the rest of them still
[1:16:20] virgins will not be lost but they'll go
[1:16:22] through that tribulation period
[1:16:25] so tell me you don't have to have the
[1:16:26] holy ghost to go
[1:16:28] i'll tell you you're wrong
[1:16:32] you have to have that holy ghost you
[1:16:34] have to find yourself go through all
[1:16:36] three stages justification
[1:16:38] sanctification filled with the holy
[1:16:39] ghost
[1:16:41] and here are these virgins and they say
[1:16:43] give us some of your old we want the
[1:16:45] holy ghost now
[1:16:49] he said it represents that holy ghost
[1:16:52] that all does he says that's the reason
[1:16:54] we anoint people with old
[1:16:56] when you come up to get paid for it you
[1:16:58] need to know why you're being anointed
[1:17:00] with oh it's because the preacher is
[1:17:02] saying i'm going to put this little spot
[1:17:04] of oil on you
[1:17:05] as a token that the holy ghost is going
[1:17:08] to touch your body
[1:17:10] not the preacher's prayer
[1:17:13] as good as it may be
[1:17:15] they may be able to pray and they may
[1:17:16] have a healing campaign in their life
[1:17:18] and that's great but it's a token of the
[1:17:20] holy ghost on your life that they'll
[1:17:22] cleanse you and heal you from your
[1:17:24] infirmities
[1:17:27] he said now these had the holy ghost
[1:17:29] they were sanctified they were
[1:17:31] sanctified plus the holy ghost they
[1:17:33] believed in the phenomenons they
[1:17:34] believed in all of god's power
[1:17:37] everything god spoke of here they
[1:17:38] believed it
[1:17:40] these were taken up
[1:17:43] and these said give it to us now
[1:17:47] we don't have enough
[1:17:50] to give it to you
[1:17:52] and they went in the rapture
[1:17:56] notice he didn't say they went into the
[1:17:58] marriage supper he kind of changed his
[1:18:00] thought there
[1:18:02] because we know that that marriage
[1:18:04] supper is the rapture
[1:18:06] he said they went into the rapture
[1:18:08] so when the trumpet sounded and the
[1:18:10] brother says when the announcements was
[1:18:12] made all these bride maids lit their
[1:18:14] torches in anticipation
[1:18:19] and brothers and sisters we see that in
[1:18:20] the world today the whole christian
[1:18:22] world is an anticipation for the second
[1:18:24] coming of christ
[1:18:27] that's all you hear talked about
[1:18:29] they talk about a coming of christ the
[1:18:31] second coming of christ they talk about
[1:18:32] a rapture
[1:18:34] and i've said it before rapture wasn't
[1:18:36] even a word many years ago they didn't
[1:18:37] they didn't use that word but now it's
[1:18:39] used every church on every corner
[1:18:42] they're talking about a rapture
[1:18:44] and every denomination every church
[1:18:46] every proclaimed christian plans to go
[1:18:49] in this marriage supper
[1:18:52] but only five of them
[1:18:55] had extra purchased oil
[1:19:03] only five of them
[1:19:06] were prepared if
[1:19:08] the groom tarried a little longer
[1:19:16] what was it predicted 77
[1:19:20] we're tarrying
[1:19:22] the lord's tearing
[1:19:25] he's waiting for that last one he's
[1:19:26] waiting for that very last one to to get
[1:19:28] themselves in and to be ready
[1:19:31] and the cry's gone out and here are
[1:19:33] these five virgins that had the extra
[1:19:35] oil
[1:19:36] let me tell you it's going to take
[1:19:37] something extra if we're going to make
[1:19:39] it
[1:19:41] it's going to take something extra in
[1:19:42] your life something extra in my life
[1:19:45] right here deep down right here in my
[1:19:48] heart
[1:19:51] and these five foolish bride mates
[1:19:53] started to run out of oil
[1:19:56] and you know there's not a lot of places
[1:19:58] that probably worked after hours
[1:20:01] back then
[1:20:03] and the father i said hey you you're
[1:20:05] gonna have to go somewhere else i've
[1:20:07] only got enough for myself this is my
[1:20:09] experience and these five foolish had to
[1:20:12] go out in the middle of the night and
[1:20:14] they begin searching from door to door
[1:20:16] no doubt in panic
[1:20:18] no doubt frantically begging for more
[1:20:21] oil and i looked up a picture i like to
[1:20:23] look at the paintings because painters
[1:20:26] the artists that god inspires they can
[1:20:28] pull out details out of these out of
[1:20:30] these scriptures we hear in just a
[1:20:31] picture
[1:20:32] that's unimaginable
[1:20:34] and the picture i saw was the five wise
[1:20:37] wise virgins and the torches were
[1:20:39] burning were huge and there was a glow
[1:20:42] an ambient glow all around those five
[1:20:46] and the other five were almost on their
[1:20:48] knees with anguish on their face and
[1:20:51] fear and crying and begging you could
[1:20:53] see it in their mouth fixing the clown
[1:20:55] please give me some more
[1:21:00] frantic
[1:21:08] go
[1:21:10] go get your oil
[1:21:12] this is ours
[1:21:15] and in that picture
[1:21:17] the five wise
[1:21:19] had their torch in one hand
[1:21:21] and a little cruise
[1:21:24] of oil in the other
[1:21:26] hand you know what the five foolish had
[1:21:31] just a little
[1:21:33] dimly lit torch
[1:21:36] just a little flicker of a flame
[1:21:39] and fear and panic because it was fixing
[1:21:42] to be dark on them
[1:21:44] they could see the closing of time
[1:21:50] and so while they go out and they begin
[1:21:52] to look for more oil
[1:21:54] they're out begging for all door-to-door
[1:21:56] i need oils anybody have oils anybody is
[1:21:58] anybody awake come on is the store owner
[1:22:00] awake please open the store i need oil
[1:22:04] while they're out doing this and begging
[1:22:06] here comes the groom
[1:22:09] here comes the groom slipping in and he
[1:22:11] comes in there just quietly
[1:22:15] in the midst of the night
[1:22:17] catches away his little bride
[1:22:20] and the procession begins to follow
[1:22:23] him
[1:22:24] with the five wise virgins leading the
[1:22:26] way with their torches lit burning
[1:22:28] bright
[1:22:32] and they enter into his city
[1:22:35] they enter into a place that he has
[1:22:37] prepared for them
[1:22:41] and the you know what the custom is
[1:22:44] once that wedding party comes into the
[1:22:45] city
[1:22:47] the doors are shut
[1:22:51] so no
[1:22:53] nobody can enter into that city
[1:22:56] unless they came in
[1:22:58] with the groom
[1:23:01] we better have a relationship with god
[1:23:03] this morning
[1:23:06] nobody was able to enter into that city
[1:23:08] those those foolish virgins they came
[1:23:10] back and they come back and they look
[1:23:12] and say can we let us in will you please
[1:23:14] let us in we don't know you
[1:23:18] we don't know who you are the wedding
[1:23:20] party has already come into the end to
[1:23:22] end they're already at the table they're
[1:23:24] feasting
[1:23:26] i don't recognize you
[1:23:30] but i had to go get more oil
[1:23:32] i'm sorry
[1:23:34] that's too late
[1:23:43] brother sisters no one knows
[1:23:45] when that day will be
[1:23:47] just like that wedding
[1:23:49] they didn't know what day it was going
[1:23:50] to be they knew it was coming
[1:23:53] but there was no date set
[1:23:56] nobody knows all i know is the truth
[1:23:58] says that jesus said he gave us some
[1:23:59] clues he gave us some conditions and i
[1:24:02] believe we determined even last week we
[1:24:04] know we're living in that time
[1:24:06] we know that the groom is coming back so
[1:24:08] brother sister we need to make sure
[1:24:09] we're full with the oil
[1:24:11] as we look at noah
[1:24:14] god had him to preach 120
[1:24:18] years
[1:24:20] this is simple
[1:24:22] preaching and teaching
[1:24:24] but this is reality of what happened
[1:24:28] and if we don't take heed to the reality
[1:24:30] of the past we won't change our future
[1:24:34] we should learn from our past
[1:24:36] noah preaches for 120 years
[1:24:40] right in the midst of the most
[1:24:42] scientific age
[1:24:46] scientific world
[1:24:48] than we've got today
[1:24:52] they built the pyramids
[1:24:55] they built the sphinx
[1:24:58] they embalmed bodies to look more
[1:25:00] natural than we could ever imagine but
[1:25:02] today they still look like they're alive
[1:25:06] thousands of years later
[1:25:09] he said they had color and dye that they
[1:25:11] made
[1:25:12] that
[1:25:13] last for 4 000 years and have never
[1:25:15] changed
[1:25:17] and it showed that they had a
[1:25:18] civilization like that
[1:25:22] you say why are you bringing that out
[1:25:23] because the bible says as it was
[1:25:27] in the days of noah
[1:25:29] so shall it be
[1:25:30] in the coming of the son of man
[1:25:34] we are living in the most
[1:25:35] technologically
[1:25:37] scientifically proven age
[1:25:40] since the time of the pyramids
[1:25:43] now we can't fathom that because
[1:25:46] we look at a bunch of rocks and stones
[1:25:48] and sand
[1:25:49] and we think oh that's neat looking
[1:25:52] but it's impossible for us to build it
[1:25:54] today
[1:25:57] we don't have the technology to build
[1:25:59] what they built today
[1:26:07] and here noah is
[1:26:09] and he's preaching it's going to rain
[1:26:13] because the word of god said so what are
[1:26:15] you talking about noah it has never
[1:26:18] rained how can you be talking about rain
[1:26:20] it's not going to rain
[1:26:29] you see noah was a prophet on the scene
[1:26:36] and anytime there's a prophet on a scene
[1:26:38] what follows a prophetic message
[1:26:40] judgment
[1:26:43] so noah here is up there preaching and
[1:26:45] he's preaching and the people are
[1:26:47] turning it down
[1:26:48] they laugh in his face
[1:26:51] and they look at him and they and they
[1:26:53] say
[1:26:54] you don't meet our scientific way noah
[1:26:58] what you're saying is not true noah
[1:27:03] there's no such thing as rain
[1:27:07] there's no such thing as speaking in
[1:27:08] tongues
[1:27:11] there's no such thing as the holy ghost
[1:27:14] if you just accept christ
[1:27:16] and clean your life up
[1:27:19] you're good to go noah
[1:27:22] and noah says it's gonna rain it's gonna
[1:27:24] rain
[1:27:25] you're just old-fashioned noah
[1:27:28] let me tell you we're probably some of
[1:27:29] the most old-fashioned people around
[1:27:34] we're so old-fashioned they don't even
[1:27:35] call us old-fashioned anymore
[1:27:38] do you realize that
[1:27:39] [Music]
[1:27:41] they don't even look at us with
[1:27:43] significance anymore we're just that's
[1:27:46] that group
[1:27:47] that's that crowd
[1:27:51] but i'm gonna tell you we're
[1:27:52] old-fashioned because the bible says we
[1:27:54] have to go back
[1:27:57] we have to go back to an original state
[1:27:59] we have to go back to to a garden of
[1:28:01] eden experience we have to go back to
[1:28:03] that day of pentecost experience
[1:28:06] that's what god is looking for
[1:28:11] and he said that scientific people
[1:28:13] looked at no one said look fella you're
[1:28:15] off in your head
[1:28:18] you're off in your head we got a radar
[1:28:20] we got a doppler we got machines that
[1:28:22] can go up there and it'll tell us
[1:28:24] exactly how much moisture is in the air
[1:28:26] and i'm going to tell you know what
[1:28:27] there is not one drop of water between
[1:28:29] here and there so where is it coming
[1:28:31] from
[1:28:34] you realize it had never rained before
[1:28:37] and for 120 years noah preaches rain
[1:28:42] how did he even know what to call it
[1:28:47] because it had never rained so here's
[1:28:49] noah saying i know it's going to do it
[1:28:51] because god said so
[1:28:53] and god is my jehovah jireh
[1:28:56] if he said it he'll provide it if he
[1:28:59] promised it he'll give it
[1:29:01] if he saved you you'll make it
[1:29:04] and noah's up there preaching over and
[1:29:06] over and over it's going to rain there's
[1:29:08] coming to rain
[1:29:10] the whole world is going to be washed
[1:29:11] away and the wickedness is going to be
[1:29:13] washed off the face of the earth it's
[1:29:15] going to rain
[1:29:18] it's going to happen
[1:29:25] ah
[1:29:27] that's nonsense
[1:29:32] that's nonsense
[1:29:35] we got our churches and our pastors
[1:29:37] don't say nothing like that
[1:29:40] our pastors don't preach on marriage and
[1:29:41] divorce
[1:29:44] our pastors don't preach on holiness
[1:29:48] our pastors don't preach on sin
[1:29:52] gambling
[1:29:55] no we we just love jesus
[1:29:59] he loves us
[1:30:03] oh
[1:30:04] joel
[1:30:06] you know who i'm talking about
[1:30:10] mr oldstein
[1:30:12] everybody's love everybody's happy
[1:30:15] god's good life's grand there's never
[1:30:18] nothing wrong for the people that love
[1:30:19] god
[1:30:21] glory to god i get on my jet and fly
[1:30:24] from here to canada tomorrow
[1:30:28] god's good
[1:30:33] you know joel osteen says some pretty
[1:30:34] good things from time to time but he's
[1:30:36] leaving out a lot of the meat
[1:30:39] he's got a lot of chocolate
[1:30:42] he got a lot of pie
[1:30:44] but he don't have a lot of meat and
[1:30:46] taters
[1:30:48] here's noah
[1:30:50] it's going to rain it's going to rain oh
[1:30:52] man you're off your head why are you
[1:30:54] building this ark up there do you think
[1:30:56] anybody's ever going to believe you
[1:30:59] the brother says let me tell you when
[1:31:01] god gets to a place
[1:31:03] that he's had enough
[1:31:05] god is going to get his point across
[1:31:09] god is going to make his authority
[1:31:12] understood
[1:31:13] and he tells noah he says i've heard
[1:31:15] they're scoffing enough noah
[1:31:17] you've preached you've been consistent
[1:31:19] you've been diligent in what you're
[1:31:21] doing i've heard all i'm going to hear
[1:31:23] now go get ready go get in and the
[1:31:25] animals will come two by two
[1:31:29] and two by two a male and female parrot
[1:31:32] flew in
[1:31:34] a male and female sparrow flew in a male
[1:31:38] and female goat a male and female sheep
[1:31:40] a male and female line a male and female
[1:31:42] tiger a male and female elephant a male
[1:31:45] and female giraffe
[1:31:47] and we could go on and on and on
[1:31:50] now you tell me
[1:31:52] how the people could sit there and watch
[1:31:54] this caravan of animals
[1:31:57] come into this ark
[1:32:01] and not believe
[1:32:02] the word as it went forth
[1:32:05] how can people see the signs that have
[1:32:07] been given
[1:32:08] and yet not believe the word that has
[1:32:10] come forth
[1:32:13] over and over one two by two two by two
[1:32:15] and noah tells them this is
[1:32:19] your last sign
[1:32:22] this is your last chance and they
[1:32:24] wouldn't believe it they told him said
[1:32:26] go on up there and live with your
[1:32:28] stinking animals
[1:32:32] go on up there and live with your
[1:32:33] stinking animals
[1:32:35] all we do we know you trained them
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:38] you trained them to follow you you
[1:32:40] probably fed them with bread and cookies
[1:32:42] and crumbs and now they're just
[1:32:43] following you up there
[1:32:47] what a deceived bunch of people
[1:32:52] and noah says no matter what the world
[1:32:54] says
[1:32:56] i'm going to listen to god
[1:32:59] no matter what the world says about
[1:33:01] us you me
[1:33:05] follow god
[1:33:09] and he said some of those borderline
[1:33:10] believers
[1:33:12] you know you got those everywhere
[1:33:15] they're everywhere
[1:33:17] those borderline believers they sit
[1:33:19] around there and listen to his message
[1:33:22] and they set off just a little piece
[1:33:24] away
[1:33:26] and said you know what
[1:33:28] that old man may be right
[1:33:31] but we don't want to get too close to
[1:33:32] that
[1:33:35] i like some of the things they say
[1:33:38] but i don't think we need to get too
[1:33:40] close to that
[1:33:42] so let's just go up there and sit around
[1:33:45] and if it starts raining
[1:33:49] if it starts raining and that door shuts
[1:33:51] all we have to do is knock on the door
[1:33:56] because he's a kind-hearted man he's
[1:33:58] crazy
[1:34:01] but you know he'd do anything for
[1:34:02] you you ever heard that people say that
[1:34:05] man and people over there they do
[1:34:06] anything for you but they crazy
[1:34:11] oh no he'll do anything for you but he's
[1:34:13] crazy all you gotta do if it starts
[1:34:15] raining we'll knock on the door and
[1:34:16] he'll just let us come on right on but
[1:34:18] that's not what the bible said the bible
[1:34:20] said
[1:34:21] god shut the door
[1:34:24] and when god shuts that door there is
[1:34:27] not anything
[1:34:28] in this world that can pull that door
[1:34:30] back open
[1:34:32] and when god shuts the door for the
[1:34:34] final time there will be nothing in this
[1:34:37] world that can pull that door open and
[1:34:40] when i think about as the flood waters
[1:34:42] begin to come down and i think about
[1:34:44] these flood waters coming down on that
[1:34:45] ark and i think about the people
[1:34:47] standing around the outside
[1:34:49] and i imagine as the flood waters come
[1:34:52] up
[1:34:53] and how long about the time it hits them
[1:34:55] in the knees maybe the thighs begin to
[1:34:57] look around
[1:34:59] and they begin to wonder
[1:35:01] where's higher ground
[1:35:05] hey noah
[1:35:07] are you in there
[1:35:08] [Applause]
[1:35:09] something's happening out here
[1:35:13] something's happening out here noah
[1:35:15] and then the waters begin to come on up
[1:35:18] their waist
[1:35:19] and up to the throat and they begin to
[1:35:21] find themselves they can't bottom you
[1:35:23] ever been out in the ocean and all of a
[1:35:25] sudden you find yourself you can't touch
[1:35:26] the bottom
[1:35:28] and you're looking you about 200 feet
[1:35:30] from the shore
[1:35:32] you know you're going to swim back but
[1:35:34] still there's just that instant of a
[1:35:35] little bit of a concern
[1:35:38] because all of a sudden you were out
[1:35:39] there and the tide maybe changed a
[1:35:41] little bit and the wave come up and your
[1:35:42] feet's not touching anymore
[1:35:45] and here these people are as the rain
[1:35:47] waters come down and fall upon them
[1:35:49] they're not touching anymore
[1:35:51] and they look and shortly after there's
[1:35:53] no more tree branches to hang on to and
[1:35:56] the only thing is out there that they
[1:35:57] can see is this big boat bobbing up and
[1:36:00] down
[1:36:03] and they're thinking if i could just get
[1:36:05] to that boat
[1:36:09] that's not the way god works
[1:36:12] god gives opportunity
[1:36:14] god gives chances
[1:36:17] he says for whosoever will
[1:36:20] he never told anybody that they couldn't
[1:36:22] make it
[1:36:24] never
[1:36:25] but he gives you opportunity and here i
[1:36:27] can only imagine as this boat is going
[1:36:29] up and down and i can imagine claw marks
[1:36:32] in the outside of that boat
[1:36:41] but talking about noah
[1:36:45] it's the same thing he had to go through
[1:36:49] justification
[1:36:51] sanctification
[1:36:53] being filled
[1:36:55] the prophet said when he was in there on
[1:36:57] that first level
[1:36:58] he was down there with the creeping
[1:37:00] things and the chickens and so forth
[1:37:03] he said that was his justification
[1:37:08] he said then he went on up until the
[1:37:09] next level where the birds were
[1:37:12] in the ark
[1:37:14] that was his sanctification
[1:37:17] he said then he went up there where he
[1:37:18] could look out that little window and
[1:37:20] see the light
[1:37:23] and that was his buddhism of the holy
[1:37:25] ghost
[1:37:27] we all got to come that way
[1:37:30] justification sanctification being
[1:37:32] filled with the holy ghost
[1:37:36] and he said noah comes down there right
[1:37:38] to the end of this thing and he tells
[1:37:40] his family says
[1:37:42] in the morning
[1:37:44] god's going to close the door
[1:37:48] it's getting late but in the morning
[1:37:51] there will be darkness all over the
[1:37:53] earth
[1:37:54] in the morning the rains will go to fall
[1:37:56] and then this ark is going to float away
[1:37:58] and god will diminish every one of those
[1:38:01] cruel centers that disbelieved
[1:38:04] my message
[1:38:09] all of them's waiting
[1:38:13] he said the next morning they got up
[1:38:16] went into the ark
[1:38:18] does anybody know what day they went
[1:38:20] into the ark
[1:38:23] becky i knew you was going to have it
[1:38:26] may 17th
[1:38:28] sister alicia
[1:38:30] you say how does he know that
[1:38:34] it's all in the hebrew calendars the
[1:38:36] bible tells you
[1:38:38] may
[1:38:39] the 17th
[1:38:40] when noah was 600 years old
[1:38:44] after preaching for 120 years
[1:38:48] the rain comes down
[1:38:54] and all them people on the border
[1:38:59] said he's just
[1:39:03] but you see
[1:39:05] he said there's a divine line between
[1:39:07] belief
[1:39:08] and unbelief
[1:39:10] and you either come out on one side
[1:39:13] or the other
[1:39:15] and there's a time when you'll receive
[1:39:17] your last call
