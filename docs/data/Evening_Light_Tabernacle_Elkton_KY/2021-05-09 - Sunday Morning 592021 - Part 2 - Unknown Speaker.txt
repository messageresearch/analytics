========================================

we look at the mother and the meaning of mother and it's it's endless it's virtually endless a mother is a protector she's a disciplinarian she's a friend she's selfless she's a loving human being he must sacrifice their wants and their needs for the wants and needs their family you win every one of you know what i'm talking about you've given up time you've given up days you've given up things you wanted things you desired in your own life just know that your kids could have happiness so that your kids a mother works hard to make sure their children are equipped with knowledge skills and abilities to make them competent as a human being a mother is probably the hardest yet most rewarding job in the world i was thinking the other day you know help get to thinking and i was thinking i wonder what it'd be like to be a mother and i there's no way that i could feel them shoes because a mother's work it doesn't just start when they when they wake up and there's an ant it's it's endless it's close it's laundry it's dishes it's cooking i'm gonna tell you face it raising jesus was not an easy we're talking about a child that ran off yeah yeah this is a child about 12 years old and his mom and dad say hey we're going to go to the market you stay right here you look at the lambs you look at the doves you stay right right there we'll be back in 15 minutes don't go nowhere scour the city in and out here and there in buildings out of buildings and they're in a panic and frantic worry is jesus where's our son and then they find him over in the temple and he's preaching and what does he do but say hurtful things to his mom he says hurtful things and things to belittle her and he acts in such a way that they thought he was mad mary was just like every other mother you want to be proud of your children you want you want to be able to to put your children out there and you want to be an upstanding young man young lady and you want the people to speak highly of your children sure you do your mothers that's what you do but no not jesus not jesus we begin to look at it and all through his life at the very beginning of his ministry what did he do but offend people in the synagogue whose child is this it's that carpenter and a woman you know that carpenter and that woman said she had a she was a virgin and she conceived whose son is this and he's standing and he's continually upsetting the pharisees over and over and over to the point that mary is says and and luke i think it is uh or no i'm sorry it's a mark where she says he heard about this and they went to take charge of him because they thought he was out of his mind mary and the other siblings are going to fight him what are you doing why are you upsetting these people all the time why are you embarrassing us and jesus said this i didn't come to bring peace i didn't come to bring peace but i brought a sword i've come to turn man against his father daughter against his mother daughter and all against mother-in-law and man's enemy will be the members of his own household how do you think that made her feel my son's a renegade we know we know what jesus was doing we know the end of the story but think through the mind of mary you're the mother and this is your child this is what's going on and brothers and sisters jesus didn't care if that blood was family or not exodus said honor your mother and father and jesus said who is my mother who are my brothers and he looks out amongst the crowd he said you'll know my mother and brothers and father is right there anybody that does the will of my father you're my brother you're my sister you're my mother how hurt how hurt should could she have been can you imagine i may be angry how could you do this jesus how could you say such words how could you hurt me like that think about mary now and jesus and mary they're at the disciples wedding at a wedding with the disciples and mary runs and tells jesus the host is out of wine the host is out of wine jesus and mary knowing his ability she knows that jesus can do miracle after remember she's seen it behind the scenes she knows what he's capable of and so obviously she wants him to step up and do something out of the ordinary and produce all of this wine show us what you can do jesus and what's he saying woman woman what does this have to do with me it's not my time yet now let me tell you something brother and sister i don't know about you but if i looked at my mom i said woman i'd be picking up my teeth my grandmother my mother no and he says woman what does this have to do with me i can't help but think what mary's thinking at this point in her life let me tell you something boy at 13 years old i carried you in my one at 13 years old i walked up and down the hillsides of judea while i was pregnant at 13 years old i gave birth to you in a stable i worked my fingers to a bone i traveled five days every year to get the appointing anointing upon you and this is the way you repay me all you can say is woman can you imagine that stare all your mothers have that stare you don't have to say a word it's all right here you know as a child you don't have to you don't have to ask what's wrong you know something's wrong because that stare comes so i can imagine now staring through jesus how embarrassed she must have been in this house full of people but a mother's love endures a mother's love endures first corinthians 13 says love endures all things it beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things love doesn't give up love doesn't give up it doesn't give up on a person love because of love it willingly remains it stands firm no matter how difficult the situation you know motherhood and parenting bringing the fathers in here a little bit it can be tough it causes you to have to suffer sometimes you know as a parent sometimes you go through seasons of life seasons of suffering whether it be a child's sickness you hate to see your children sick your mothers you hate to see your children sick there's mothers that have long-term kids that have long-term needs and disabilities they carry that their whole life there's mothers that have heart ache and brokenness because they know what's at the end of the road i can't imagine a mom of the little one she endures she walks the children through difficult seasons they hold their hand they cry when the love when the child is hurt they hurt when the kid loses their best friend they cry with mama when a child loses their dog they cry with mama it's my hand that nurtures and pulls a man and takes care and pulls them in close and tight love of a mother is a love that endures continues well after the child leaves home those of you whose children have married and gone off you didn't quit loving you still think about them every single day no matter what road they go down your mother is thinking about you enduring love love without resentment from teething to tantrums to teaching to trials enduring love is committed to a lifelong enduring love it realizes that parenting is a lifelong relationship and that the mother with enduring love can walk alongside her child through all difficult seasons sometimes when you're in those teenage years you think you don't need mama you think you don't need daddy you think you don't need mama as soon as something goes wrong who's the first person you go to mama enduring love trust in god's promises enduring love trust and faith that god's sovereign goodness where god makes no guarantees what a love what a love that that is what a love that mary had enduring love as we read through the chapter 19 of john if you want to follow along i want you to envision you're at that scene through the eyes of mary the mother of jesus and you're at that scene and pilate therefore took jesus and scored him and the soldier plated a crown of thorns and put it on his head and put a purple robe and said hail king of the jews remember last time mary heard that it was hell god's found favor now it's hell king of the jews and they smote him with their hands and pilate went forth and to bring him forth and to find no fault in him but jesus came forth wearing a crown of thorns a purple robe and pilate said behold the man the chief priests therefore the officer saw him they cried out crying crucifying crucifying can you imagine mary at that scene can you imagine mary there and you're watching your son be scourged you're watching them people cry out crucifying crucify and you've seen miracle after miracle after miracle even when jesus said woman what does this have to do with me he filled six vats of wine the chief priest and officer saw him they cried out crucified by him crucify him take him away and crucify him jesus answer said we have a law and by our law he ought to die and the jews answered him sorry we have a law in our law he ought to die because he's made himself the son of god pilate therefore heard him saying he was the moore for afraid and he went into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus whence art thou jesus gave no answer then saith paul speaketh thou not unto me knoweth thou not that i have power to crucify thee and i have power to release thee and jesus answered and said goodness thou have no power at all against me except they were given to thee from above and mary's hearing all this mary is beginning to realize exactly who she was she's beginning to realize that she carried the first miracle onto the face of the earth and she's hearing this and and then pilates overheard them saying and brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place called the payment and but the hebrew gabitha and it was a preparation of the past it's over in the sixth hour and saith the jews behold your king and that cried out away with him away with him crucify him skipping on down a little bit and he bearing his cross went forth to a place called of the skull which is called in hebrew golgotha where they crucified him and two others with him one on either side and jesus in the midst verse 23 then the soldiers this is where it starts to get real then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus they took his garments and made four parts and to every soldier apart and also his coat now the coat was without seen woven from top throughout and they said them therefore amongst themselves let us not rent it but cast lots for it whos whose it shall be and the scripture might be fulfilled they that part of my raymond among them for my vesture they did cast lots these things therefore the soldiers did jesus is going through the most horrendous time of his life he's been scored he's been mocked he's been spit on he's wearing a crown of thorns he's been made a mockery of and he's carried the cross all the way up to galgotha colump columbus as that cross hits the ground and what's the next one saying now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother if that don't rip your heart out you don't have one there stood at the foot of the cross jesus his mother and his mother sister mary the wife of cleophas and mary magdalene watch now when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciples standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son it's a different interpretation here it's not woman this what does this have to do with me that's not this interpretation but now he's looking down and he says woman that's to say ma'am here is your son this is what my work was for this is what you carried me for when the angel gabriel come to you and said hell this is what it was for it was so that the world could live i'm dying a sinner's death mom what a cross she bore what a cross she bore it says then the disciples said behold thy mother and they took her in to his own home what a scene what a scene mary was the only person to be present with jesus at his birth and at his death joseph was he had died according to theology scripture he found anywhere account of luke mary a single mother at the foot of the cross mother this is who i am by these words i think we can look now and say that jesus deeply cared for his mother jesus deeply cared and and cared personally for his mother mary there was a witness of jesus's last hours on earth she was probably close to 50 years old at that time what torture that must have been in mary's heart what torture that must have been on mary and i wonder whether the angels were from three three decades earlier earlier did they haunt her or did they comfort her remember mary she said am i that one am i that one that's going to birth a governor of the world am i the one that's that's going to birth the one that takes away all the all the sickness of the world the sin of the world am i that one a virgin sal conceive she was the one she didn't know all the heartaches she didn't know all the disappointments she didn't know the cross that she was going to have to bear but she picked up her cross and followed jesus you think well that's where the story ends but really it doesn't jesus died who was at the tomb mary mary magdalene and mary was that where it died is that where it stopped is that where it all ended is that where mary gave up on jesus when he was gone and off to say no in the upper room she's one of the 120 in the upper room and asking god send down the fire upon us send us down the holy ghost that we could live just the way jesus lived that we could live just like my son lived not that i'd done anything for him he was yours all along i was just part of the element you love him this morning you love your mothers amen god's certainly good to us let's stand to our feet i told you i wasn't gonna keep you alone uh i tell you when you're thinking about these services and i you try to think of a way to close them and you pray for the god lead you and sometimes in service like you just don't know how to close you just don't know what to say what do you say after that scene i just thank god that mary didn't give up on him life would have went on the history would have been the same it wasn't going to change the course but it paved the way from others just by our heads heavenly father it's a different kind of message this morning lord and i i know that but it's the reality of of what mothers face from day to day as we hear the challenges that were brought forth the life that susana wesley lived the dedication that she lived just so that she could see her sons and children the rest of her children be successful not only successful but men of god no doubt her desire was make my children men for you and god you honored her prayer through the hardship through the sacrifice she still didn't waver from her dedication and millions were saved and mary through all of her hardship chasing jesus around in the in the in the city lord trying to find him and panicked and and worried and her heart broken from the comments that he would make and what seemed to be belittling to us in the natural we could only see that he was having to take a spiritual approach at his mother but on that final day on calvary as he looked down upon his mother words of peace as he said ma'am here's your son what you've done has helped save the world we don't idolize mary we don't lift her up as a saint as other religious factors do but lord we know you loved her she gave everything that she had lord for you and lord in return as we look at that part of the scripture how she lived her life for you was with you everywhere you went every step you took she was by your side i want that kind of dedication lord that every step i take every stride i make is by your side lord because i can't make it without you lord lord i pray a special blessing upon the mothers not only this day but in the days and years to come they're so special lord there's a special place for mom and our hearts we can reminisce about our childhoods us older ones and we can just feel page after page after page if we could just stop and think for a minute of what mom does for us in our life lord i know i'm thankful for mine [Music] the reason i'm who i am today is because mom [Music] many times i had anger with things that she would make us do make me do i'd have resentment but every bit of it was for my own good [Music] and that's the way we are as christians every bit of what we go through what mom puts us through when mom is angry and she gives us that stare young young children listen here mom's doing that for you mom loves you your mom wants to see you successful your mom wants to see you and be proud of you and see you not go the ways of the world but stay firm in the ways of christ lord we thank you for our moms i just pray lord that the service was an eye-opener to some of us husbands [Music] children and mothers alike lord [Music] thank you lord jesus [Music] um to be like sling it with all your heart now to be like jesus to be like jesus [Music] on earth thy long to [Music] to glory i only ask to be like him once again let's just worship him this morning to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth
