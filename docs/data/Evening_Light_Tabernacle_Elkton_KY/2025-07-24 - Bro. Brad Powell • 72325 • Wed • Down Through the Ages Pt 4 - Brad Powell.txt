I said, "Lord, we just want to be in your presence tonight and worship you tonight." &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's just so good to be in the house of the Lord. I'm just excited tonight for what God's going to do for us. If you didn't come expecting to do something for you, you might as well stayed home &gt;&gt; because we come expecting God to move. &gt;&gt; And you know, we played volleyball Monday night. I didn't. They did. And I got to thinking, I was watching Sister Donna play. And here's a lady. The doctor's done said she's she's going to die. I wish they could see her now &gt;&gt; out there playing volleyball with the kids. the young people, I shouldn't say kids. Brother Brandham said they're out kids because kids are goats and we're not goats. We're children of the king tonight. &gt;&gt; I thought my wouldn't they be what would they think to see what our God has done? &gt;&gt; Amen. He's an awesome God tonight. Amen. And this song come on my heart. God is good. And it says, I like this verse. It first verse. says, "If you're walking through the valley, there are shadows all around, do not be discouraged. Do not fear because he will guide you. He will keep you safe and sound. He has promised he would never leave you nor forsake you." And guess what? His word is always true. Hallelujah. Oh, I love you tonight. Let's sing it with all the heart if we can. Well, if you're walking through the valley, oh yes, and there are shadows all around. Do not fear. Well, he will guide you. Well, he will keep you safe and sound. Oh, yes. He has promised you he'd never leave you nor forsake you. And his word is true. Well, God is good all the time. He puts a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time and through the darkest night his light will shine. God is good. Oh yes, he's so good all the time. Well, we were sinners, so unworthy. Yes, Lord. But for us, he chose to die. Oh yes, he filled us with his Holy Spirit. Now we can stand and testify. [Music] Oh that his love is never ending and his mercy well they will never end. Oh, God is good. Oh, all the time. He puts a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time. And through the darkest night, his light will shine on the screen. Oh yes. Oh, he's so good all time. And though I may not understand all the plans you have for me, oh yes, but my life is in your hands and through the eyes of faith I can clearly see. Oh God is good. Oh yes.

Oh, he's so good all the time. Amen. You love him. You may be seated tonight. Sorry to keep you standing so long. And amen. We just love the Lord tonight, don't you? And want to welcome those that are streaming tonight. And just pray that God will just bless your heart tonight. And we were talking about the different ones that stream. I know Sister Peggy and Sister Parish and uh Sister Becky told me that her sister Kay uh she streams a lot. So, God bless you, Sister Kay. And we just just pray that God will bless each and everyone. And I know Brother Glenn and them are on vacation. So, I'm sure they're streaming if it possible. So, we just want to say God bless you. We miss them tonight, but we're just thankful for you that are here tonight and thankful for the presence of the Lord and Amen. Let's sing that little song if we could. He paid a debt he did not owe. I owed a debt I could not pay. Amen. Well, he paid a debt. He did not owe. Oh, I owed a debt. I could not pay. I needed someone to wash my sins away. And now I sing a brand new song. Oh, amazing grace. All day long, Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. He paid a debt at Calvary. Well, he paid a debt at Calary. He cleansed my soul and set me free. I'm glad that Jesus did all my sins erased. Oh, I now can sing a brand new song. Oh, amazing grace. All day long, Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. And one day he's coming back for me to live with him eternally. Won't it be glory just to see on the day? Yes, I will sing a brand new song. Amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. Amen. Amen. Aren't you thankful he paid that debt this tonight? Amen. And you know, I was praying this morning and in the last couple of mornings, it's just been on my heart and I begin to think and is around 6:00 and I begin to think where brother Brandham said that when he come back, he'd come back between 6:00 and 9. And I said, "Lord, one of these days when you come back, what a day that'll be. There'll be no sorrow there, Brother Joe. I won't be sick. I won't have diabetes. I won't be old. I won't hurt, but I'll be meeting him in the air. &gt;&gt; And what a day that'll be when my Jesus I shall see. And when I look upon his face, Amen. And what a day that will be. Oh, when my Jesus I shall see. And when I look upon his face, the one who saved me by his grace. And when he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land. Oh, what a day. A glorious day that will be. There'll be no sorrow there. Oh, and there'll be no sorrow there and no more burdens to bear. No more sickness, no pain, and no more ping over there. And forever I will be. Oh, with the one who died for me. Oh, what a day. A glorious day that will be. Yes. Amen. Oh, and what a day that will be. Oh, when my Jesus I shall see. And when I look upon his face, me by his grace. And when he takes me by the hand, the promised land. Oh, what a day. Glorious day that will be. Amen. and brother Michael John and brother Caleb. Brother John, uh, would you come help him? Hersburgger, I had one of them minutes. You excuse me? I'm sorry. We've got too many. We've got more than one, Brother John. So, Amen. Now, we have some prayer requests tonight. We want to take to the Lord in prayer and uh, we want to continue to remember Sister Parish and Sister Peggy. Continue to remember our shutins. And like I said, Brother Glenn and them are gone. going to pray, continue to remember them in prayer as they're gone. And continue to remember Sister Janette and Sister Donna. And also, Sister Becky asked me that we would pray for Sister Larb or the Matt's Matthew's wife that God would touch her. Didn't you say she was in the hospital? She's she's been in the hospital. She's having different thing, something going on, and they can't really figure it out. But she needs a touch from the Lord tonight. So, let's just remember her in prayer with all that's in within you tonight. If you have need on your heart, you might let it be known but uplifted hand. And we're going to ask brother Tommy if he'd stand and pray over these needs and and the offering tonight. Brother Tommy Amen. Let's sing that little chorus. There's never been a day like this day. If we could. Oh, there's never been a day like this day to me. There's never been a day like this day I see. Oh, there's never been a light that shines so bright as this day. His glory us. Let's stand as we ask brother Brad to come tonight. Oh, there's never been a day like this day to me. There's never been a day like this day I see. Oh, there's never been a light that shines so bright as this day. His glory as the I think I can remember this verse. For Christ is revealing himself unto me. He has opened my eyes and now I can see. Oh, his word is becoming a reality. Oh, in this thing, this glory. I'll get you some. God bless you. [Music] like this day to me. There's never been a day like this day. I see. There's never been a light that shines so bright as this day, this glorious day. Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you hungry tonight? &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be victorious? Why don't you just say, "Hey, devil." &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; we win. &gt;&gt; We win. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Give the Lord a hand, a clap of praise this night. &gt;&gt; Certainly good to be in the house of the Lord. If you want to be turning in the in the scriptures, if you want to turn, we'll read from Mark tonight. And we're going to continue on our thought down through the ages. And tonight's topic I want to look at and I'm going to try to I'm going to try to just kind of maybe slow down behave just a little bit. And uh we'll just go as as far as we feel to go and but I want to my my subtitle would be submission to the commission. Submission to the commission. How many knows we are all commissioned to do something for God. We have a commission in our life. And now whether or not you carry out that commission depends on whether or not you submit to that commission. &gt;&gt; Are you going to be submissive to God? &gt;&gt; That's the question. So as we look at these church age messengers and we look and you got Paulinius, Martin Cola, Luther, Wesley, brother Brandham, they had to submit to a commission that was given to them. John the Baptist had to commit to submit himself to a commission that was placed in his life. Moses, brother Brown said, Moses had a commission. &gt;&gt; So, we have to establish and as we're looking at these church ages, a commission who it is, what it's for, what it does for the people. So, uh we're looking at that tonight in and Mark 16. As you're as you're there, I'm going to read you this uh this quote here and it really stood out to me as we get started. says that that fuzzy face, gray-haired, whiskered, baldheaded, skinny arms 80 year old Elijah sitting up there in the wilderness looking out upon the sins of the people. You know, Elijah had a commission as well. God spoke to him one morning. Here's his commission. God spoke to him one morning and said, "Go down there and tell Ahab that not even the dew will fall from heaven till you call for it." He said, 'I can see that little those little old eyes looking out through that fuzzy looking white beard, that stick in his hand, walking down the road like a 16-year-old boy. He knew who he was. He knew what his commission was. He know he knew what he was called to do. &gt;&gt; So, he's just got a little bit of a pep in his step. I'm going to go down there and tell them just what God said for me to tell them because God said I'm going to tell him that's my commission. He walks down there like a little 16-year-old boy and he walks right up into the presence of the king and says not even dew will come from heaven till I call for it. He wasn't ashamed of God or his word tell the king or anybody else. He said he wasn't ashamed. He didn't have to hide it. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have to hide who we are. &gt;&gt; Listen, listen. The prophet himself had conviction in his heart over this. He said, "It puts me in mind of something like ourselves." I told I said to the people, "I'm getting to a spot. I need more faith." Can you imagine the prophet of the hour saying, "I'm at a spot. I need more faith. I need more faith." and that's why I'm home is to get a new burst of faith. He said it's gotten so that we look and we pray for people that you apologize. Mr. Devil, he says, would you please move over and let me Mr. Devil, would you would you please step aside so we can be happy? Mr. Devil, would you please let us have our joy? Mr. Devil, would you please? He said, ' That's the place that we've gotten to was right there. He said, 'But you don't got to do that.' He said, 'You don't have to do that.' He said, ' There's nothing to that. Faith has got muscles. He says, it's got hair on its chest. When it speaks, everything else shuts up. &gt;&gt; That's what faith, that's what a commission in our lives does. It places a an authority and a power that's given to us by the word of God. Not me, not you, not our abilities. It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; The word of God builds your faith. The word of God is the foundation of the church ages. &gt;&gt; We're going to prove that one of these days when we get there. Get out of here. He said, "I'm a son of God, &gt;&gt; commissioned of God. Leave them alone." And that moves it. He said, "You have to have no apology to the devil. nothing to do with him. Not ashamed of the word. Not ashamed of your commission. Not ashamed of who you are. &gt;&gt; So many times I feel like we we we we we kind of hide away our true identity. &gt;&gt; Are we ashamed? Are we scared? Are do we wonder? He says, "But as his servant," how many &gt;&gt; as his servant, I'm not ashamed. Brothers and sisters, we don't have to be ashamed to be the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We don't have to be ashamed of your holiness. &gt;&gt; Ladies, you don't have to be ashamed. Young men, you don't have to be ashamed. You don't have to be ashamed to pray in public. You don't have to be ashamed for to let the world know that you've been set free by the blood of Jesus Christ and that he's still a redeemer today and that the same blood that set you free can set them free. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of his word whether it's denominations. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, we have to stand up against them. kings potentates. &gt;&gt; When we talk about a commission when he was called, we're going to get into this at a later date, but I'm share a little bit right now. Brother Brown said when the when the commission when the angel come to him, he said you'll stand before kings, you'll stand before proteinates and you'll go around the world with this message. &gt;&gt; That's a commission. &gt;&gt; But he says whatever it might be, just get ready to give an answer. God calls for it. So I asked you earlier, how many of you's got a commission? &gt;&gt; God's going to call for it. Mark 16. I said I was going to behave. Mark 16. And they when they had heard that he was alive, now we know this. This story here starts. This is where Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of G of Jesus and James uh and I believe it's Solomon goes there and they go to the tomb to anoint Jesus who had died. So they're now they're at the tomb. They they've seen that the stones been rolled away. They see that the God is that Jesus is no longer there and they come back and they tell everybody what they saw. And so now he says, "When they heard that he was alive and had been seen of her, believed not. After that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country." And they went and told it to the residue, neither believe they them. Afterward he appeared unto the 11, as they sat at meat, and upgraded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart. So now he's scolding a little bit. because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. Isn't it something how he gave him the word over and over and over and told them and told them and told them who he was and what was going to happen the the the order of things I'm going to that you're going to take this temple down three days it's going to come back but yet they believed it not even though he had risen and watch what he says and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature the good news and he that believeth and is what? Baptized shall be saved. But he that what? Believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe. What's that next say? &gt;&gt; In my name. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's something about the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; In my name, they shall cast out devils. In my name, they shall speak with new tongues. In my name, thou shalt take up serpents. In my name, they shall drink any deadly thing, and it shall not hurt them. In my name, &gt;&gt; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Think about this. So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, he was received up into heaven and set on the right hand of God, and they went forth and preached everywhere. and the Lord working with them and confirming the word with &gt;&gt; signs following. So be it. May the Lord add his blessings to the reading of the word. You can have your seats. I got something here that I want to pull up and I want to read this to you and I want to talk about this name for just a minute because it struck me and I said, I know brother Brandham said something about it and I know I've heard it many of times but I couldn't find it. So, I finally found it before he came out. And he's talking about in my name. Listen to what he says. He's praying. Dear God, as we come to thee now reverently, quietly, soberly, and in faith, believing that you hear and will answer prayer because, there's the key word, because we come to you in that allsufficient name of thy son, the Lord Jesus. who is the infallible one who gave the promise that if you ask the father anything in my name I'll do it then we know that we will receive just what we ask for we come in his name &gt;&gt; for there is no other name that we could approach you in &gt;&gt; oh I thought about this and I I've changed my whole way of thinking when I read when I heard this the other day a few weeks back. I changed my whole way of of the way I pray and approach the Lord. Oh, we got quiet. &gt;&gt; So, what changed? What changed was I begin to say, "Heavenly Father, I come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; The word has taught us that. Why was I not doing it? I preached about it. I've talked about it. I've preached about it. I've told it when Jesus said, "Pray like this. Pray like this. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." So now my approach is different. He said, "And and we come in his grace, &gt;&gt; not me. &gt;&gt; I'm fallible. more than once, many times, sometimes in a day. &gt;&gt; Come on, angels. &gt;&gt; But we come in his grace, not confessing that we deserve anything. &gt;&gt; I never You never approached God and say, "God, you owe me this. [Music] &gt;&gt; He paid a debt that I can't pay. I I owe him everything. He owes me nothing. But he made a propitiation for us that he died for us. That he atoned for us and we feel that we can stand justified in your sight by his death. That is our faith. And asking for nothing that would be evil, but that which would be good for us. John 14:14. You got that one, Carson. John 14:11. I'm sorry, Carson. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me, or else believe me for the very work's sake. Now, this is a key key scripture here. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also. And what greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father. Catch this one. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my &gt;&gt; name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son. If ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it. &gt;&gt; How many got your church age books? No, no, no. I mean, there's some They're in the back. That's what I'm telling you. Did you get one when you come in? If you need one, they're here. I'm trying to tell you that. It just the I just broke right there. I'm not I'm not putting you on the spot. If you need a church age, let me rework. If you need a church age book, Brother Tommy's got them in the library, okay? So, we will be referring to parts of it. If you ask anything in my name, I will do it. So, I want you to know tonight, I want you to look at just how simple that verse is when it's put into action. I want you to think about tonight as a how simple that thought is. And it's such a simple thought that people around the world take and they run away with that very sentence and they apply to apply that very sentence to everything they need in their lives. Lord, I need a new job. Lord, I need more money. Lord, I need a a a new car. Lord, I need a new house. Lord, I need this. Lord, I need that. Lord, my I'm hurting. Lord, I The world applies that one sentence. If you shall ask anything in my name, I will do it. And they think it's a magic wand. They believe it's a magic wand that if I say this in Jesus name, he's going to give it to me. I need a million dollars. &gt;&gt; It's not happening. And whether or not they attend church, they use this scripture. &gt;&gt; Whether or not they they they they going to the bars, they use that scripture. whether or not they're living it up in a life of doping it up, drinking it up, adultery, fornication, &gt;&gt; they use that scripture. What are they doing? They begin to dissect the word and they begin to pull out. Why is it that people want to pull out, oh, this I'll apply this to my life because this this makes my life good, but I'm going to put this over here and I don't really believe that because man, I don't want to have to submit to that. &gt;&gt; And they take and they dissect that word and they use that word. And many of times it's people that's just playing church. &gt;&gt; They're not submitted. They're not committed. Don't get quiet on me. &gt;&gt; You know it's the truth. &gt;&gt; And they want every time something's wrong. Will everybody pray for me? &gt;&gt; I liked when brother Brown said, "Now you done the sinning, Billy Paul. You do the praying." But they want to apply that word over and over and they want to but then they wonder why nothing happens. And the reason and then they begin they get discouraged. Have you ever heard them people? Well, I I I I called on the Lord but he never done nothing. I I've called and I've asked for this and he's never moved. He's never come on the scene. He's never this. He's never that. Now, I'm not speaking to any of y'all cuz I know God moves on the scene, right? &gt;&gt; But the reason that they're there because they fail to read and follow the verses before. &gt;&gt; Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me. Or else believe me for the work's sake. &gt;&gt; Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he that be what? believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto my father. So, think about this. Here it is. He that believeth on me, this scripture right here is a commission. &gt;&gt; It's a call to the believers. &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me, &gt;&gt; this is not a commission to the sinner. This is not a commission to the doubter. This is not a commission to the unbeliever. This is not a fixall for the world to use whenever it's convenient. But this is a message and a commission to the believer. It says if you'll just believe on me, believe on the very work's sake. In other words, if you have seen, if you have heard, &gt;&gt; if you believe &gt;&gt; the word of God &gt;&gt; with all your heart, you can apply this to your life. &gt;&gt; This is a simple little scripture, but it's so simple that we a lot of times we make it too big and we go around it and we think, "Oh, I can't do this. I'm not good enough. I'm not this." It just says all you got to do is believe. How many believes he was a healer? &gt;&gt; How many believes he was a deliverer? &gt;&gt; How many believes he was a savior? How many believes he can bring your prodical children back? &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? It's a word in action. That's faith. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you how simple this is. Brother Brandham tells a story about a a young lady, the daughter of be Reigger. You heard the story. You know who I'm talking. I'm about to share it with you. So, Brother Brandham's talking about he was out preaching meetings in Fort Wayne Gospel Tabernacle. I think it was Fort Wayne, Indiana, somewhere up in that area, I think. And he said there was a great man of God, Be Regger. Now, I looked up who be Reigger was. So, be Reigger was a man. He was a he was a preacher that he would go into into rural communities and churches that had started kind of dwindling away, falling away. They they kind of lost their support in the fellowship in the churches. and he would go in and he would bring in the word of God and he would go into the community and he begin to rally the people back to come to the house of God again. So his ministry was to go out and spread the word and pull people to come back into the house to restore their faith, get them back to serving God. And brother Brandham talks about this be reticer and he said he was a great man of God. He said he was a mighty man of faith and the Lord really blessed this brother and he said I was just a little boy and he said I was sitting there in the services used to be with Paul Rder as a young minister. Now think about this. A young minister William Brham preaching meetings sitting in meetings and is astonished by this B be Rigger and he says and then I heard brother Reigger's daughter had lost her mind. She went insane. He said she went insane and and and one day she went back into the coal shed there at the church one Easter morning and they told me he said there's some insane girl back there in the coal shed at the church. Now listen he said I just come off of a campaign and I went back there and I found out it was Be Radiger's daughter and Sister Reigger sitting there and my heart like to failed me. another place he said, "I thought I thought so much of of Sister Ricer because she was such a lady of God. She was such a such a a a woman of faith." And he said, "It just about my heart just like to failed me." And he said, "She was standing there and she was combing her beautiful long hair with her fingers and this girl was hollering, "A nickel is a nickel. A penny is a penny. A nickel is a nickel. A penny is a penny. A nickel is a nickel. A penny is a penny. And he said, "She sat there, this beautiful woman sitting there and and he said, I was thinking about Brother Reter, and she was sitting there with her head down in her mother's lap and frothing at the mouth. A nickel's a nickel. A penny is a penny." H watch this. He said, "The anointing had done left me." Oh, we're talking about a young William Brandham who was out praying for the sick, who was anointed to pray for the sick, but now the anointing has left him. You mean the man who who sat there and saw the the milky white clouds and the healing campaigns and he saw all the the the the the blind eyes open and the deaf ears open and I just heard today where he was sitting there and he said this old woman he called her mother. He said, "You remind me so much of my mother. Take my hands." He says, "You're blind. You're going blind." And he and she began to she began to answer, "Yes, I'm I can't see nothing." He said, "Well, we're going to pray." So, he prayed just a simple little prayer and said, "Now, touch my nose." &gt;&gt; How many fingers am I holding up? One. And the crowd erupted. I didn't have to be there to know what happened. &gt;&gt; How many fingers am I holding up now? Two. She said, &gt;&gt; "That's right." &gt;&gt; He said, "If the blinded eyes of this woman can be opened, the blinded eyes of everybody in the building can be opened." &gt;&gt; But now the anointing had left him in this story. And she just sat there with her head down frothing at the mouth. And I knelt down there and I said, "Lord Jesus, be merciful to her. That was it. &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said? &gt;&gt; He didn't come in some big power authority and try to call in this and and take this under commission and and take this under under subjection or this spirit or that spirit or re rebuke and reject this. He said, "Lord Jesus, be merciful to her." And that was it. &gt;&gt; He said that was it. Now she's married, got two or three kids, she's just fine. &gt;&gt; See, it's grace and simplicity. He said, "We try to reach way over the top of him." And he said, "And way over the top of him, but honestly, it's just simple believe. Have faith &gt;&gt; and don't doubt. Lord Jesus, be merciful to her." looking at a couple of words tonight. I want to look at these words submission and commission. Submission. We look at submission and we we see that it means to willingly yield up the authority or leadership of another. How many would say I want to yield up my self to the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So willingly giving yourself. So willingly I give myself up. You raised your hand. So willingly you have to say, "I'm going to give up my thinking. Willingly I'm going to give up my bad attitude. Willingly I'm going to give up my desires." You see how this works? Willingly, I'm going to give up my pride. willingly. If God is going to move in my life and I'm going to see the commission that God called me out for to carry out, I'm going to have to lay everything of myself aside and allow God to use me to allow God to move in my home, to move in my life, to move in my children, to move in my job. I'm giving it all up. But the problem is so many times we don't want to give up self. We want to hold on to what we like. We want to hold on to what pleases us. We want to hold on to the things we think are good. &gt;&gt; But in order for God to carry out a commission through you, you have to submit and say, "I willfully &gt;&gt; give myself up to your authority." &gt;&gt; You know, everybody's got a boss. &gt;&gt; Mine just sits on a throne. I want you to watch this. If we submit oursel to the word of God, if we submit oursel to the authority of God and his word, what does that do? It goes back to that commission to go into all the world and preach the gospel. Because what it does when you give yourself up, it allows others to s to see God's supreme authority and God's will working in your life. How is it you can look at some people and say, "That's a real man of God. That's a real woman of God. That's a that's a real servant of God." What is it? It's them allowing getting theirel out of the way and allowing God to move in their life. Whether it's a ministry, whether it's in their home, whether it's at the song in the song service, whether it's at the piano, whether it's at the Walmart, &gt;&gt; they allow God to move in their life. And it tells the world that this life you see is not my life. You see, when I get my life in the way, notice I said in the way. &gt;&gt; When I get my life in the way, it disrupts God's program and plan because God might want me to go over here and I try to go over here. You heard of a man named Jonah. We won't get into his story, but you know what I'm talking about. We We get into a place that we don't allow God to move in our life. But the Christian life is not about me me or I I I. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; You know as well as I do whenever you hear somebody and all they can say is God used me. God manifested through me. I God I prayed and God worked through me and I went here and I did this and I Oh, you better watch him. &gt;&gt; You better watch that fella. You better watch that woman that I I I I because it's not about I. It's about God. It's about God. It's about living for others. Letting your light shine through others. You know Jesus, he prayed in the garden of Gethsemane. Brother Ber, is that clock right? Mercy me. Well, mine ain't right. I'll tell you why. I got it on upside down. Praise the Lord. Jesus in the in the garden of Gethsemane. Now, think about this. Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane. And he begins to express his human desire. human desire to avoid suffering. Do you realize that he sat there? He knew what was going to come. He knew what was about to happen. And he prayed there one of the most powerful expressions of faith and submission to God's plan that has ever been prayed. He knew it was going to hurt. He knew it was going to be painful. He knew that he was fixing to be tortured like no man had ever endured in their life. it was coming his way. And he says, "Father, if it be if you be willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done." &gt;&gt; So, he's looking out here. Jesus is showing obedience and willingness to sacrifice himself for the salvation of all the world, for you and I. He's looking out there now. His flesh, his flesh was saying, "No, no, no." &gt;&gt; But his heart said yes, &gt;&gt; yes, yes. And so when we take the communion, it'll be such a reminder to us when we look at that blood and we look at that wine and we look at that bread that's sitting there before us of the blood that was shed on Calvary. And just we ought to think and think how he just as a human element, he said, "No, I don't want to do this. I don't want to go through this. Father, if you be willing, let it pass from me, but nonetheless, not what I want. Not what I want in life, what you want, what you want. Jesus had to submit himself to the plan. He had a commission, savior of world. We've already established he couldn't have done it in Moses's time. He couldn't have done it in mo in Noah's time. He came in his time. It was his time in the garden of Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; And it was his time to accept the plan of God. In order for you to have overcoming power, Jesus accepted the plan. In order for you to have the Holy Ghost in your life to lead you and guide you, it was Jesus submitting to the plan. &gt;&gt; In order for you to be redeemed, &gt;&gt; pulled out of the old pawn shop and and out of the grips of the sticky fingers of Satan, God Jesus had to submit to the plan. So what about you? &gt;&gt; What about us? How submissive are we? How how submissive are we when God calls us to do something? How submissive are we when he says, "Get this out of your house. Get this out of your home. Get this out of your life. &gt;&gt; It's going to hurt because you enjoy it, but I can't take you no further until submitting to the plan." You see, we look at the Bible. We look at the church ages. For time's sake, I'm going to skip some of this. We'll bring it in at a later date. We look at this Bible and we look at the church ages and we have to acknowledge and we have to establish that there were commissioned men of God on the scene. There was a Moses. Moses had to be coni commissioned to be a deliverer. There had to be a David on the scene. There had to be a David who was a warrior who could stand and look at the the the very giant you face from day to day and look at giant right in the eyes and say, "I come to you in the name of the Lord." We had to have a David who was commissioned. There had to be Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter, Andrew, all the disciples. They had to be a commission in their lives. They left everything. &gt;&gt; Think about the life they lived. They walked away from it all. Matthew, a very prominent tax collector, despised by his people, but rich. Real rich. He walks away from it all. There had to be a Paul who had a commission. &gt;&gt; There had to be an Irenius with a commission, a Martin. There had to be a Paul with a commission. What was his commission? I want you to take the word and go to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Do you know that that started that you was in the mind of God when he commissioned Paul? &gt;&gt; You and I were in the very mind of God when all of that started before the foundation of the world. And God sets us all this plan in order. &gt;&gt; There had to be women commissioned of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There there there had to be a Ruth so that we would know what a kinsman redeemer was. There had to be an Esther. There had to be a Mary, mother of Jesus. There had to be there had to be a a Rahab the harlot &gt;&gt; to show us there is a way back. There had to be a Mary Magdalene, somebody who would pour out everything that she had at the feet of Jesus and just worship him and love him and show us how to adore our Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; There had to be a woman at the well &gt;&gt; who when she heard the prophesying of the word said, "I know where this comes from. This comes from what I've been taught from my childhood that when the Messiah cometh, he'll tell us all these things and you must be the one. &gt;&gt; She was commissioned. &gt;&gt; It wasn't by chance that he was sitting at the well or that she had to go draw water. &gt;&gt; I think the prophet said too, omnipotence met. There was even there was even a little boy that was commissioned in the word. 5,000 men sat on a hillside with their wives and children hungry, feeding on the word, feeding on the word, losing track of time and so much that they said, "We've been sitting here all day and almost all night and they haven't eaten. Lord, what are we going to do?" And this little boy comes walking up with a little bag, a little satchel, a little box. It's not much, but mama gave me five loaves and two fish. You think he wasn't commissioned to be there? &gt;&gt; You think he wasn't pre-ordained? You think it wasn't by the mind of God that said, "Hey, I need this little boy to come and teach these people how to share what they've got with the people. I'm going to share and I'm going to give and I'm going to share. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Until they took up 12 basketfuls. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got a commission, too. It's not just the little boy in the Bible. It's not just Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. It's not just Ruth. It's not just Naomi. It's not just these people. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's me and it's you. &gt;&gt; It's your children. &gt;&gt; Want you to listen to this prayer. I'm going to read this prayer to you. If brother Brandham's praying. He says, "Heavenly Father, take us now, Lord. Let us let the great shepherd, the great redeeming shepherd, the great shepherd who left glory." What a words. He said, "Knowing that some of the attributes was lost on them great valleys of sin where the wolves and the animals would soon devour that little sheep. But he left his golden corridors, came down into the earth, and was made one of us so that he could declare the love of God to us. There he found them." Some denominations. How many come out of a denomination? Raise your hands. Yeah. Say there's a handful of us. Well, I'm going to get the rest of you. I promise. Some of them out of houses of ill fame. You might not want to raise your hands. If you was drugging, drinking, doping, partying, carousing. Some of them on the streets, some of them blind. And I think about that when he says blind, I think some people just blind to the word. &gt;&gt; Blind to the word. Not not not physically but spiritually just blind. He got them. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Some of them in the hedges and the highways. Now, how many some of this I said applies to you. &gt;&gt; Raise your hands. Come on. Defy gravity. Say it applies to you. Everybody in here. Everybody raise your hands. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Because it applies to you in some aspect. And he says, "But he redeemed every single one that the father had ordained him to redeem." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Listen to the next statement. He says, "He commissioned us." &gt;&gt; He didn't see you as a tax collector, a drunkard, a harlot. He saw you as somebody that he was going to commission to do a work and to do a job &gt;&gt; on your life. He looks beyond your faults. &gt;&gt; He commissioned us that we would live, listen to this, this is important, that we would live this part of the word for our ages. Somebody's going to live this leodysian church age. &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to overcome the lukewarmness of this age. There's been a commission that's went out and said somebody's going to rapture out of this world. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, what if the grave?" Don't worry, he ain't forgot you. &gt;&gt; But somebody's going to rapture out of this world. He commissioned. We see the great reformation of Luther in that age. Wesley and the Pentecost. But now we're looking for the headstone of that city, the capstone. &gt;&gt; Love. &gt;&gt; I like brother Matthew and he brought it out. Love, charity being the greatest of the three. Love. He's looking for that capstone. He says, 'We know the age and the promise that we are given for this day. It has to be restored again. The evening light shall ripen the fruit of it. Now listen, it does the fruit no good if it's setting hanging on the vine in the shade. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that's just hanging. They're hanging fruit. But they're not reaching for the light. &gt;&gt; Where's your best apples, Brother Steve? It don't take a genius. You got to get in that light. You say, "I know I'm a child of God." Get in the light. &gt;&gt; I know there's more for me. Get in the light. I know that God can use me. Get in the light and let yourself start to grow and produce into the fruit that God intends you to be. Don't just be hanging fruit on the bottom of the tree. &gt;&gt; You know what happens to that hanging fruit on the bottom of the tree? It loses its strength. The animals come by and eat it. It falls off the tree onto the ground and it rots away. So don't be that hanging fruit on the bottom of the tree. He said, "It shall come to pass that in the evening time it shall be light." Listen what he says to these people. Now we all raised our hands. They did, too. Because he said, "Lord, help these who raised their hands." How many of us say, "Lord, help me tonight. &gt;&gt; Help me tonight." And he says, "Lord, help these who raise their hands. May they buckle up a little tighter. &gt;&gt; We're on a ride, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; You want to be strapped in for this &gt;&gt; because things are happening so fast." He says, "May they buckle up a little tighter, shod themselves with the gospel of peace, put on the full armor of God, the pull the helmet down, &gt;&gt; put up the shield of faith, march forward from today on, grant it, Lord, because just in a little while, he says, "We're going to be summoned." &gt;&gt; What is a summon? &gt;&gt; They come knocking on your door and say, "Hey, you got to show up in court." That's not the summon he's talking about. He's saying the trumpets are going to sound. The dead in Christ are going to rise. The rapture, somebody's leaving here. Might as well be you. &gt;&gt; I said it might as well be you. Everybody wants to win. Hey, devil. We win. &gt;&gt; The Kentucky Lottery. Well, that's what they say, ain't it? Somebody's going to win. Might as well be you. &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to rapture. &gt;&gt; Might as well be you. &gt;&gt; So down through the ages, believer after believer after believer, they've been called. They've been chosen. They've been pulled into the work of God and commissioned to carry out through the word. &gt;&gt; Without a commissioned people, where would we be? &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't think about that a lot, do you? Do you realize Jesus was a one-man mission? Do you realize when his ministry started, it was Jesus? &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus started ministering at what age? &gt;&gt; 30. I'm quizzing you a little bit. The Hoffman's head of Christ is is depicted Jesus at what age? &gt;&gt; 33. &gt;&gt; 33. So he he ministered for somewhere around three to three and a half years. Do you realize that? &gt;&gt; You know, they you got so much technology now that you can do and look up and find anything. They took and they took all the sermons that he preached that were documented, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. All the documented sermons. And then they begin to pick them out and found out which ones overlapped where and which ones were written about twice. And they determined they wanted to determine how many sermons, how many days did Jesus preach, documented, preached in his three and a half years. You know how many days it was? 27 days. You can go into any corner of the world and people know the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; For 27 days, he preached in a three three and a half year span. And now through the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; this end time message. &gt;&gt; You want to talk about a commission? How many times did it go around the world? &gt;&gt; Seven times around the world. We're going to get into that a little later, too. When we think about what happened in in Leota, when that church age began over here in in the Leosian church age, when it began right there in 1906, so many so many tremendous things happened and opened up. And when you line it all up, you begin to see that God, he don't make no mistakes. &gt;&gt; He caused events to happen, people to come on the scene. because they have a commission. When you talk about a commission, I want you to look at this for just a minute here. When you talk about a commission, commission means you're written a warrant granting power to perform various acts and duties. When you've been written a commission, it gives you the authority to act for, in behalf of, or in place of another. Oh, who you working for? Huh? I wish I could think of what I seen the other day. It was good. You're either working for God or you're working for the devil. &gt;&gt; There's no there's no middle ground. I think it takes us right back to that scripture where it says he likes you either hot or cold. &gt;&gt; If you're lukewarm, he's going to what? &gt;&gt; You ever you ever took a drink of warm water? &gt;&gt; I'm going to challenge you to go home and do it. You get you a glass of lukewarm water and you turn it up and you see if your belly don't boil. He wants us either hot or cold. We're either for him or against him. There's no two ways about it. &gt;&gt; You're either for him or you're against him. We look here in the word and we see that John the Baptist, John the Baptist was commissioned to do the work of God for his hour. Now you say, why are you going down the road of John the Baptist? Because John the Baptist role plays so much in William Brham's role. &gt;&gt; So John the Baptist here, he came out into the wilderness. He came out of the wilderness preaching and telling him to what? Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. And he comes out and he brings this message. And he's telling them, this is the word that was spoken by Isaiah. This is the word that you should know. I am the one of the voice crying out of the wilderness. Prepare yourself a way for the Lord is coming. Make paths straight. Now Isaiah 43, that was in Matthew 3. Now listen to what Isaiah 43 describes it. 40:3 he describes the one of the voice calling out in the wilderness. He says, "The voice of him that crith in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God." Now, they should know this word. You think about these Pharisees. They should know the word of God. Every valley shall be exalted. Every mountain and hill shall be made low. Every crook shall be made straight. and the rough places plain. And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together. For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. So we look at John the Baptist and here he has a call for repentance and he's trying to get them to spiritually prepare themsel for the Messiah. Now I want you to look at his commission here. He is sitting out here and he's coming into Jerusalem and he's baptized. They that were baptized of him in the Jordan confessing their sin. And now all these Pharisees are looking around. &gt;&gt; You know, anytime when God's on the move, there's the devil's always going to look and say, "What in the world is going on? &gt;&gt; What are those people doing? Are they getting closer? Are they getting farther?" And these Pharisees sitting there and they're looking around. They're trying to see. They come to this baptism and John the Baptist cries out to them. He knew they wasn't going to give up their old ways. He knew they wasn't going to give up they wasn't going to give up their traditions. He knew they wasn't going to they wasn't going to submit to the Messiah the way he was coming. He knew they wasn't going to going to submit to him being one crying out of the wilderness. Can you imagine what this guy looked like? Some of us would look at him and say, "Man, he looks like some kind of scallwag. Long hair, beard, living out in the forest, stinking probably." And these Pharisees come up here and they're looking at this and what does he say to them? You generation of vipers. And he says, "Don't tell me I hadn't warned you about what's about to come. I'm giving you a chance. I'm giving you a chance. I'm giving you a chance. I'm giving you the warning. I'm giving you the commission of the hour." And here's these Pharisees. They're out there. And he knew they couldn't do it. And he tells them, listen what he tells them. bring forth fruits for repentance. In other words, show me you've changed. Show me something in your life is different. &gt;&gt; Show me that you mean business between you and God. &gt;&gt; They couldn't do it. They couldn't do it. They couldn't give themselves over and get rid of their old traditions. And they said this. They said, "We have Abraham to our father. We've got the laws of Moses. We've got the word of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. We've got all the scrolls. We've got all of this and and we've got all of this." And he says that God is able for these stones to rise up children unto Abraham. What does he tell them? The axe is laid to the tree. In other words, they could not be fruitful anymore. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And he tells them, "I baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes that I'm not worthy to bear, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire." You see, John the Baptist never pointed anybody to me. &gt;&gt; He always pointed them to Christ. &gt;&gt; He kept pointing them back to Christ. Back to Christ, back to Christ. In your church age book, if you want to mark, if you're making notes, church age book, it's verse uh or paragraph 21. He says, "Now you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book that we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and in his and his works in the future ages." So brothers and sisters, John the Baptist was trying his best to get these Pharisees to see what was happening and he was trying his best to show them the correct way, but they couldn't accept the message for their hour. They could not be obedient to it. Do you see part of commission? If you're going to be commissioned, part of that is to be obedient. &gt;&gt; Obedient to the word. When you hear the word, you take it in and you begin to you begin to eat on it. You begin to feast on it. You begin to live that word that you hear and that you take in. And they couldn't do it. That's why we need the Holy Spirit to live in our lives to show us the revelation of where we need to be in this hour. Listen, he says it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we fail to get it. Bringing these two thoughts together, you'll see that it doesn't just take an ordinary study and thinking to make this book real. He said it's going to take an operation of the Holy Ghost. That means this book can't be revealed to anyone but raise your hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; A special class of people. &gt;&gt; A special class of people. It will take one with a prophetic insight. &gt;&gt; He's talking to you. &gt;&gt; It's going to take somebody that's going to come and open this word. It'll require the ability to hear from God. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you see why it's so important that we find ourselves in a quiet place? That we get alone. Sometimes you got to get alone. Let me tell you, men, women, children, find yourself in a quiet place and say, "God, Lord Jesus, speak to me." &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Ber made a statement back here. You may not have seen it the way I did, but he was talking to me. He's preaching. He turned. He said, "Brother Brad, if you will listen, God will speak to you." And that sounds elementary. That sounds simple, but so many times our minds are cluttered with the noise of the world, the job, the home, the kids, the work, all the stuff begins to add up. The bills are due, the cars broke down, the lawnmower quit. And do you even listen? Can you hear when he begins to speak? So, we need that quiet time. He says, "Not just a student comparing verse for verse. You can get together in Bible studies and you can sit here and you can debate with a Baptist, a Methodist, a Pentecostal, an Amish, a Menanite, a message." &gt;&gt; I said it. You can be go verse for verse for verse. He said, "But that's not what we're talking about. That's good, but the Pharisees were good, too. The Pharisees were the best scholars of the day. It is said that they could take a pen. I've had this in my Bible for years. I'm going to show it to you. Anybody know what that is? It's a hat pen. Found it in an estate sale and it struck to me. I thought I'm going to stick that in my Bible because the Pharisees could take a pen and run it down through the scrolls and tell you what chapter it was in. I ain't that good. But they knew the word. They were the best scholars of the day. They knew it word for word, verse for verse. They could recite it. They knew the laws. They knew what you're supposed to do, what you can't do, when you can do it, what was acceptable on the Sabbath. They knew all of this stuff, but they didn't have a revelation. &gt;&gt; They knew Isaiah. They knew what Isaiah said. But think about this. 700 years had passed between Isaiah's prophecy and when John the Baptist came on the scene. How quickly they forget the word. How quickly they forget the word. They just looked at this man and said, "Man, this man is crazy. John the Baptist is a crazy man. Don't listen to him. Don't go to his meetings. Don't go with him. It's mental telepathy." I just heard today Brother Brown said they accused him of being in sorcery. He just kind of chuckled. He knew his commission. He says, "But a mystery requires a teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear." You see the it is the revelation of God that will give you the authority over the devil. How many wants authority over the devil? We all seek that and desire that that whenever we have face to face with the devil, we want the authority to be able to say, "Get thee behind me, Satan." That we can apply the word in our lives, the spoken word to rebuke the devil and get him out of our life. Let's move on. I don't want to miss nothing important. It's all important. Verse 27, I say verse, paragraph 27. The seven spirits before the throne is a spirit that would come in each of the seven messengers. Now, I want you to listen what he says those those seven spirits do. The se to the seven messengers, it's giving them their ministries. It's giving them their commission. The seven messengers, the seven stars, the seven messengers, the spirits come down and has given them their commission. He says, "Now we have all these expressions. Him which is, him which was, is to come. Faithful witness, firstborn from among the dead, the prince of kings of the earth, the alpha, the omega, the almighty. These are titles and descriptions of the one and the same person." &gt;&gt; H listen to this. The spirit of God in John expresses thusly in order to set forth the supreme deity of Jesus and to reveal the Godhead as &gt;&gt; one God. He says today there is a gross error. Now listen, it isn't there are three gods instead of one. There is one God with three titles, father, son, holy ghost. This mighty revelation is what the early church had. I meant to I meant to send a a thing to Carson to have him put it on the screen and keep it up there. We're talking about Ephesus, Paul, faith. This is what the early church had. They didn't believe in no three gods. &gt;&gt; No, they they they witnessed it. &gt;&gt; They witnessed God in action. They witnessed God as a father and as a son and nana and then as the Holy Ghost as the day of Pentecost. They witnessed the very same thing. So they didn't believe that we have one God. He's all of this. I'm the alpha, the omega, the beginning, the end, which was, which is, and which is to come, the almighty. Brothers and sisters, based on the trinitarian traditions, we would have to break God down into hundreds of gods. Not just father, not just son, not just holy ghost, but we would have to break it down into into these numbers that we couldn't even keep up with. God the love, God of peace, God of joy, God of power. Now, I'm going somewhere with this. God of holiness, God of mercy, God that overcomes, God of grace, God the creator, God the healer. Can you see how this list goes on and on and on and on? So, where did this come from? He says it was a it was in the Nyan council. The Nyan council. That's where this nonsense came from. They took the word and they began to have a foundational doctrine in in 325 AD, the trinitarian doctrine, and they had based upon the many gods that Rome had. So when you're baptized in the name of the father, son, and holy ghost, you are baptizing yourself into a pagan religion. Is this okay, brother Ber? When you're baptized in those titles, father, son, holy ghost, that is a pagan religion. Now, I want you to watch here how the how the devil tries to hide his perverted agenda with with the word and pull people away from the one true God. He said instead of having Jupiter, Venus, Mars, etc., etc., now we have Paul, Peter, Fatima, Christopher, etc., etc. They make it a pagan. They cannot make their pagan religion work out with just one god. pagan religion. You know what pagan means? That's satanic. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to listen to this. I'm trying to get to a stopping point. Here's a comprehensive list, an extensive comprehensive list of the saints that the Catholic Church recognizes. Do you know how many saints there are? Or who would like to guess? Just somebody throw me a number. Josh, brother Josh show, throw me a number. How many saints are there in the Catholic Church? &gt;&gt; 400. Somebody else. This is this is interactive here. That means go higher. &gt;&gt; 600. &gt;&gt; How? Who said that? &gt;&gt; Got it. Who said 10? Who said 10,000? Brother Ber Rachel did y'all split the prize. Give them a hand. 10,000 saints that they have identified in their perverted religion. 10,000 saints. St. Michael a warrior. St. Francis lover. St. Joseph an earthly father and model. St. Patrick a patron saint of Ireland. You know, brother Brown talked about St. Patrick. a lot of good things about St. Patrick and he talks about him in that age. St. Paul the Apostle, a key figure. These these are no doubt men of God. But saints, you're placing them up there right there. You're placing them up there in a in a place of deity with Jesus Christ. Come on, church. St. Mary Magdalene, St. Augustus, St. Thomas, St. Nicholas, St. Valentine. Oh, don't we love him. I'm just going to keep going. St. Lucy, St. Martin, St. John the Baptist, St. John the Apostle, St. Peter, St. Clare. This is just a starting point. On and on and on and on and on. all of these saints put in place under the umbrella of religion. If I had to try to remember all these saints to get down and pray to, &gt;&gt; I I I'll just be honest. Sometimes I struggle just to pray to God. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's a chore and it str it struggles me and it's it's it's it's it's taxing on me to take time to go say, "Lord, I need to speak to you." Now, can you imagine if you had to go speak to every one of these? St. Valentine, my wife's mad at me. Can you please tenderize her heart? I didn't mean to do it. I meant to take the trash out. Can you imagine how the the nonsense and the hypocrisy of having to pray to this God after God after God after God after God when all we got to do is stand and turn to the Lord Jesus Christ. He meets all of our needs. He's the alpha, the omega, the beginning, the end, the first, the last. He's the omnipotent one. He's the one that reignth. He's the king of kings, the lord of lords, &gt;&gt; the mighty redeemer. That's what he is. He's all of these. And I thought about it this way. I thought about it this way. This is the way it came to me. All of this that God is. How many knows what DBA is in business? Doing business as? That's what DBA stands for. So you could be you could be uh Guthrie Scrapyard doing business as Joe's Lawn Care, Joe's furniture shop, Joe's whatever. You can add all these DBAs. And when I heard that, I thought that's the way my God works. He is all these things. &gt;&gt; When I'm sick, he does business as a healer. When I'm grieving, he does business as a comforter. &gt;&gt; When I'm lost, he did business as a savior. &gt;&gt; So, he's all of these things. When you're anxious, he's peace. When you're sad, he's joy. When you're depressed, he does business as the lily of the valley. &gt;&gt; That's what God is. All of these titles, he's every bit of it. But, father, son, holy ghost, healer, lover, comforter, that's not a name. There's one name. &gt;&gt; There's one name. Now listen to what he says. That's why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. just stood out to me. He goes on to say, "This is the this is the name of those titles." Just like you take a newborn baby who is a son and name him, baby is what it is. Son is the title, then you give him a name, John Henry Brown. Now, here's where it stood out to me that man, we have to be real, real careful. Now, we all believe in baptizing in Jesus' name, right? You don't just baptize in Jesus' name because there's thousands of Jesus's in the world. I had to think back, my friends. &gt;&gt; Who have I baptized? How did I baptize them? &gt;&gt; Did I baptize them in Jesus' name? Or did I baptize them in the Lord Jesus Christ? He said because there's many Jesuses in the world. There has been before Jesus and there will be many more. He said but there's only one of those that were born the Christ. He says that's the Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; Christ. &gt;&gt; So do you see how the commission goes out? How the commission goes forth? How important it is that we do exactly what he says? &gt;&gt; Word for word, jot on jot, tit on tit. We do exactly what the word says. Want you to listen to this. What? We talk about baptism and we're going to close. The importance of baptism. We've had a lot of baptisms here lately. That's good. That's that's wonderful. Every soul's worth 10,000 worlds. But if you have not been baptized correctly, you might want to think about this because we talk about being commissioned of God. And being commissioned of God means that you have to stand up on his word. You have to be obedient to the word. &gt;&gt; That means you have to do it exactly the way the Bible says do it. &gt;&gt; Stay with me. He says they say, "Well, let me back up. When Paul passed through the upper coast of Ephesus and comes into the church, there were 12 men in it. That's right. They were all good people. We're talking about Paul witnessing to the 12 now. He says they were all good people. He said they shouted and they had a great time, but they had not received the Holy Ghost yet. And Paul said, "You haven't se received the Holy Ghost since when?" Since you believed. &gt;&gt; All right. They said, "Well, why did we didn't know that there was a Holy Ghost?" &gt;&gt; Okay, that's justifiable. Okay, that's a justifiable statement. He said, "Then how was you baptized?" &gt;&gt; He said, "If it didn't make a difference, what did he say to that church there?" &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of times people will look at you, they say, "I don't really see that it matters. &gt;&gt; I don't really see that it makes a difference." Whether it's father, son, holy ghost, whether it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I don't see a difference. &gt;&gt; The word says there's a difference. &gt;&gt; The Bible says there's a difference. Paul says there's a difference. He looked at those 12 right in the eyes and says, "You can't get the Holy Ghost until you go back and do it the right way." They said, "We've already been baptized by one of the greatest men that ever stood on the face of the earth, John the Baptist, who baptized our Lord." Ain't that baptizing good enough? He said, "Yeah, I guess it'll be all right." No, no, no, no. He said, "No, sir. No, sir. You've got to be baptized over You say, "Well, that's shameful." I'm not ashamed. &gt;&gt; I was baptized father, son, holy ghost the first time. &gt;&gt; Then when I saw it in the word, I said, you know what? I need to do this the right way. &gt;&gt; I need to do this the right way because now I feel like I'm I'm living for Christ. There's a move in my life and God is God is working on me. God is dealing with me. I want to do this the right way. So we went to brother Brian, Sister Janette's swimming pool, ice box, whatever you want to call it. I was doing cold bath before cold bath was cool. We pulled that tarp back over there. Brother Daniel Williams held meetings here. I said, "Brother Daniel, will you baptize me?" He said, "I sure will." It's funny how the world comes around. You know, that's Sister Lauren's uncle, right? Great uncle. We pulled back that that water. Pulled back that tarp. He dipped me down in that water. I now baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I come up. And nothing was different. You say, "You didn't jump. You didn't shout. You didn't scream. Nope. People clapped. I stood there. Why did you do it? The word said do it. &gt;&gt; I want to be obedient to the word. &gt;&gt; I don't want to come up on that day and say, "You know what? You done all this great things. You done this. You done that." Not that I'm great. Don't take me wrong. You've done this. You done that. You went here. You did this. You helped this one. You done that one. But you never did give your heart to me fully because you never were baptized. &gt;&gt; Huh? But I was baptized at the Christian church in the name of the father, son, holy ghost. No, that's not the way we do it around here. &gt;&gt; You see, you either believe it or you don't. &gt;&gt; You either live it or you don't. You're either obedient or you're not. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. you love the Lord tonight. And I'm not trying to scold anybody. I don't know who's been baptized, who hadn't been baptized. If you've been baptized four times, 10 times, I don't know. Just make sure you baptize the right way. You don't want to come up short on that day. Brother Ber just mentioned in a few services ago, he would hate to be standing in the very presence of God knowing that he was not baptized, right? &gt;&gt; He said, "No, sir. You got to be baptized over cuz the kingdom is sealed to anything else. &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said? &gt;&gt; Lord, let me in. We got a seal. We got a lock on this place. Only the true, only the faithful, only the righteous, only the obedient, only the humble, only the meek, only those who've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can enter through this sealed city. And when they heard this, they said, John only baptized unto repentance, not for remission of sins, saying that you should believe on him to come that is on Jesus. and they heard this and they were rebaptized. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? When they heard it &gt;&gt; and they they it was explained to them the difference between remission &gt;&gt; and redemption. &gt;&gt; And repentance, you see, when we look at this, repentance means to turn away from your sin. Repentance just means that it involves you recognizing that you've done wrong. It involves you feeling remorse. It involves you making a decision to change your behavior. &gt;&gt; But when you're baptized into remission, it's as though you never done it. I want to be baptized in the redemption of Jesus Christ as though I never done it. That that blood covers all of my faults, all of my sins, &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, for this day and thank you for this time you've given us together and just to speak the word tonight, Lord. And thank you for what you've laid on our heart. And we just ask that you continue to bless the services, Lord. Bless bless our pastor and his wife, the church here. And we just see great things happening in our midst, Lord. And we just know as the word goes forth, the people grow. And the more the word goes, the more the people grow. A greater love begins to form. A greater desire and a passion. We can see it in some that has been so hardened. Now they're beginning to soften up. Now they're beginning to be submissive. So Lord, please continue to send your submissive spirit and power out amongst the people. If there's any flaws, if there's any hindrances, if there's anything that we're not doing that's obedient to your word, Lord, I pray that you'll just come and speak into our hearts that you will just quench something, a fire on the inside, start a fire on the inside that would say, "I want to be right, and I'm not going to quit until I get right. If it means I have to fall on my knees and pray for hours upon hours. If it means I got to fast. If it means I got to to to go and and make things right with people. I want to be right before you, God. And if there's anything that's hindering me from fulfilling the commission that you've placed in my life and in the believers in this church's life. Bring it to our awareness, Lord. Bring it to the forefront. We want to address the issues, not sweep it under the rug. Not just say, "Oh, well, it it happened yesterday and that we don't have." No, we want to tend to our faults. We want to tend to the failures. And we want to be able to say that we are truly redeemed as though we never done it as we stand under the blood of Calvary. Thank you, Lord, for all that you do in our lives, for moving in our midst. We love you, Lord. We just want to praise you. We want to worship you. We want to thank you for calling us, commissioning us as part of the bride of Jesus Christ, a group of people who will live the commission in this age as your prophet taught us. Thank you Lord. We love you with all our hearts in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. What you playing sister Becky? There is power, power, wonder working power.
