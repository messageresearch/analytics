[11:44] amen you love him with all of your heart
[11:46] tonight
[11:47] amen let's stand if we could tonight and
[11:51] amen just appreciate each and everyone
[11:53] that's out tonight and
[11:55] just looking forward what god has for us
[11:57] by the way of his word and
[12:00] we don't have any uh written requests
[12:02] tonight
[12:03] which we're always thankful for that and
[12:07] we finally got the results back
[12:09] yesterday and
[12:11] i guess it was yesterday my day's all
[12:13] run together it was tuesday or wednesday
[12:15] i talked to janet's doctor and all the
[12:18] blood work
[12:19] and everything and her kidneys her liver
[12:22] and
[12:22] her everything was good and he said
[12:26] everything's just
[12:27] good and and they'd done uh
[12:30] some kind of test on her heart and
[12:32] everything was good with that and
[12:35] so we just got a lot to be thankful for
[12:38] and appreciate your
[12:40] uh prayers very much and we still got a
[12:44] long ways to go
[12:45] but we're thankful for god's uh
[12:49] healing power tonight and what he's done
[12:50] for her so
[12:54] she's not here tonight and some of that
[12:57] medicine she takes and
[12:59] when it hits her she's she she's kind of
[13:02] she sleeps a lot sometimes and but just
[13:05] continue to remember her in your prayers
[13:06] and
[13:06] i don't know how many of you had seen on
[13:08] facebook we
[13:10] had a prayer request here while back and
[13:13] forth terry tidwell and sister vicky had
[13:15] to ask
[13:16] everyone to pray sister vicky was having
[13:18] some complications
[13:20] and it reminded me of brother branham
[13:22] saying the
[13:23] cat back at the door scratching wanting
[13:25] in
[13:26] and they had posted today that
[13:29] all her tests had come back everything
[13:31] was good and the cancer
[13:33] she had some symptoms of it and and she
[13:36] said everything was good and they just
[13:37] wanted to thank everyone and
[13:39] i wanted to pass that along to the
[13:40] church and i thought you know
[13:43] just whenever it might look dim god is
[13:45] always there
[13:47] and i always think of that song that
[13:48] brother austin likes he's an on-time god
[13:51] yes he is
[13:53] it doesn't always happen when we want it
[13:55] to
[13:56] but when it's his time there's nothing
[13:58] can stand in the way
[14:00] so we appreciate that and just continue
[14:02] to remember them in prayer
[14:04] he's think of a brother in arkansas that
[14:06] had cancer in his blood and
[14:08] and he told me he said brother david
[14:11] every time
[14:12] that i testify of god's goodness and
[14:14] mercy and
[14:15] what his healing power has done for me
[14:17] he said the next day i can almost count
[14:19] on the symptoms trying to come back
[14:22] and i thought you know we have to
[14:26] bear a burden sometimes we have to carry
[14:28] a cross but
[14:30] we're so thankful that we serve a god it
[14:31] is so awesome tonight
[14:34] it's just it's just awesome how our god
[14:36] is and
[14:37] i'm just so thankful tonight to serve
[14:39] him and
[14:41] and his mercy and sure don't deserve it
[14:44] brother glenn but i'm thankful for his
[14:45] goodness and mercy tonight so
[14:47] if you have need on your heart you might
[14:49] let it be known but uplifted hand
[14:50] tonight and
[14:51] amen we're going to ask brother steve
[14:52] langley if he'd open the service in a
[14:54] word of prayer tonight
[15:24] amen you may be seated at night and
[15:26] let's sing that song

[38:04] we ask these blessings in jesus name
[38:06] amen and amen
[38:08] amen i'm going to talk to you about an
[38:11] old subject amen
[38:13] the oldest subject there is i guess
[38:15] we've heard it many times in this
[38:16] message amen but i want to just speak
[38:19] to you again amen so is that all right
[38:24] amen god bless you amen so
[38:28] amen um
[38:33] amen may god has added blessings to the
[38:35] reading amen
[38:37] so let's turn our bibles if you will to
[38:38] the book of job we'll start
[38:40] with the book of job amen and we're
[38:43] going to speak
[38:44] on omniscience
[38:47] this evening omniscience
[38:51] amen god is all knowing isn't that right
[38:56] and that's what we're going to talk
[38:57] about for a while amen to be honest with
[39:00] you i've been speaking to somebody in
[39:01] the church here
[39:03] about this subject for a little bit and
[39:05] it just got me really
[39:07] stirred up and i began to have
[39:10] a few things that just i felt like were
[39:11] fresh to me amen so i trust it'll be a
[39:14] blessing to you
[39:15] amen so over in the book of job this was
[39:18] the last scripture i had to just
[39:20] look up just before coming out amen
[39:22] because i really wanted to find that
[39:24] and with the help of the lord and a good
[39:28] computer i got to be able to pick it up
[39:30] real quick
[39:31] amen by just punching in the right words
[39:34] amen so i tell you what
[39:38] you know it used to be we'd come up here
[39:39] with four or five different books six
[39:41] books maybe
[39:42] for our quotes and you'd have to study
[39:44] that whole book by the dale potter i
[39:45] think he was a good one for that he
[39:47] he'd read the books you know and he
[39:49] didn't know how to operate a computer
[39:50] but
[39:51] ever since you can pull up you know on
[39:54] your computer both the bible
[39:56] and the message you can find something
[39:57] pretty quick if you want
[39:59] amen so all right job 38
[40:03] job 38
[40:08] how many knows that job perhaps he
[40:12] suffered very much in that right even
[40:14] though he was the most perfect man
[40:16] in the land yet god had
[40:20] uh you know he had he challenged
[40:23] basically
[40:24] he challenged the devil if i'm not right
[40:27] if i'm not wrong
[40:29] uh satan came into the congregation
[40:32] you know and it was god that said to
[40:36] satan said you know have you considered
[40:38] my servant job
[40:40] amen and so he says yeah but you know
[40:45] you keep a hedge around him you protect
[40:47] him and everything's always going good
[40:49] and
[40:50] we know how humans are as long as
[40:53] everything's going good well they'll
[40:55] praise god and bless god
[40:57] hallelujah right but he says you know
[41:00] but take your hand upon his things and
[41:01] so forth once and
[41:03] he'll curse you he'll curse you to your
[41:05] face that was the uh
[41:09] that was a proclamation that satan had
[41:12] it's still cursed yet
[41:13] and of course after the first round we
[41:16] realized that
[41:17] after all of his children died and all
[41:20] the things that he
[41:21] had was lost that
[41:25] he worshipped god saying the lord gave
[41:28] the lord taken away blessed be the name
[41:30] of the lord
[41:31] he worshiped god that way amen and again
[41:35] god challenged us and said so have you
[41:36] considered mr
[41:37] job he said yeah but i've what is it
[41:40] skin for skin or something like that but
[41:42] if you touch his body
[41:43] then he'll curse you and he didn't touch
[41:46] his body just don't take his life
[41:48] and job became perhaps the most
[41:51] miserable person amen
[41:55] i mean boils and things that were just
[41:58] made him cursed and dated he was born
[42:00] and made of stars not shine
[42:02] and all of these things you know you
[42:05] know it's just terrible
[42:06] and so forth but in the end even after
[42:09] his wife said boy honey you are so
[42:11] miserable
[42:12] you know why don't you just curse god
[42:14] and die and he said thou speakest like a
[42:15] foolish woman
[42:17] amen like one you're you're my
[42:19] sweetheart and you're not foolish but
[42:20] you're just talking one like one right
[42:22] now right
[42:23] and so you know in all of that he
[42:26] wouldn't curse god
[42:27] you know and so the day came that god
[42:31] revealed himself to him
[42:33] amen in chapter 38
[42:36] and verse one through seven then the
[42:39] lord
[42:40] answered job out of a whirlwind and said
[42:42] who is
[42:43] this that darkeneth counsel by words
[42:46] without knowledge give up the lion
[42:50] loins now like a man and i will demand
[42:53] of thee
[42:54] and answer thou me amen that's something
[42:58] amen uh you know
[43:01] it's kind of like us as a dad saying hey
[43:03] come on boy be a man
[43:05] you know that's what god was telling job
[43:08] come on now gird it up gird up your
[43:09] loins like a man
[43:10] and i will demand of thee an answer thou
[43:13] me
[43:14] where was thou when i laid the
[43:17] foundations
[43:18] of the earth declare if thou has
[43:21] understanding
[43:23] who had laid the measures thereof if
[43:25] thou knowest
[43:27] or who has stretched the line upon it
[43:30] whereupon the foundations
[43:33] thereof are fastened or who laid the
[43:37] cornerstone thereof
[43:39] when this morning stars sang together
[43:43] and all the sons of god
[43:45] shouted for joy amen may god had his
[43:49] blessings to the reading of the word you
[43:50] can be seated
[43:52] i want to go to i've got a lot of
[43:53] scriptures here this evening and i want
[43:55] to just start
[43:56] but as we begin to think about god's
[43:58] omniscience his
[43:59] all-knowingness amen
[44:03] now you know atheists and different
[44:06] people
[44:08] that really don't want to believe in god
[44:09] and so forth it's it's
[44:11] it's true that just to the carnal mind
[44:14] to believe that
[44:16] there is actually a creature or should i
[44:19] say a god like god
[44:21] is in the universe that actually
[44:24] created all of this it does take
[44:27] amen it takes faith amen let me know
[44:30] that
[44:31] otherwise he he made it plain enough to
[44:34] know to be able to look around and know
[44:36] that there is a god
[44:37] right but just in that fact
[44:40] itself and we know it without question
[44:43] is that there
[44:44] has to be a god and that he is
[44:46] omniscient he's all-knowing
[44:49] uh that he knows everything and so forth
[44:52] it's uh
[44:54] it is well not just not that part so
[44:57] much as it is just knowing that he made
[44:59] everything
[45:01] how many knows that the bible says that
[45:03] without him was not anything made that
[45:05] was made
[45:07] everything that was was made by him in
[45:10] the scripture i'm going to just go to as
[45:12] i think about it
[45:14] i believe it's found over in revelations
[45:17] 4 and verse
[45:18] 11 it says thou art worthy all the
[45:20] elders fall down say thou art worthy or
[45:22] law or lord to receive
[45:24] glory and honor and power for thou hast
[45:27] created all things and for thy pleasure
[45:31] they
[45:31] are and were created
[45:35] he did it for his own good pleasure
[45:38] amen amen
[45:43] and also over in revelations the first
[45:46] chapter in verse eight you know
[45:48] he says you know he says i am the alpha
[45:51] and the omega i am the beginning
[45:55] and the ending all right
[45:59] so we know that he is the start and he
[46:01] is the finisher
[46:03] right he started this and he is ending
[46:06] this
[46:07] amen and so the beginning and the ending
[46:10] look at the beginning what is the
[46:12] beginning the bible says in the
[46:13] beginning
[46:14] god created the heavens and the earth
[46:18] isn't that right
[46:19] so we see that in the beginning he is
[46:21] the very beginning
[46:22] over in saint john the first chapter i
[46:24] believe it was he said that
[46:26] um in the beginning was the word the
[46:29] word was with god
[46:30] and the word was god isn't that right
[46:34] amen verse chapter one he says
[46:37] the same was within the beginning with
[46:38] god and all things were made by him and
[46:41] without him was not anything made that
[46:43] was made
[46:44] and then down in verse 12 verse 13 he
[46:47] says
[46:48] i'm sorry 14 and the word was made flesh
[46:51] and dwelt among us
[46:52] and we beheld his glory the glory is of
[46:54] the only begotten of the father full of
[46:56] grace
[46:57] and truth another place in revelation
[47:01] chapter 1 verse 11 says i am the alpha
[47:04] and omega
[47:06] amen that's the second time he says it
[47:08] now within three or four verses
[47:10] alpha of course being the a of the
[47:12] alphabet and the
[47:13] being the z of the alphabet i mean he is
[47:16] the first
[47:17] and he is the last
[47:21] amen i like that because over revelation
[47:23] we begin to
[47:24] we as we know that the biblical
[47:26] revelations has been opened to us
[47:28] and we know now that he is not just the
[47:31] beginning
[47:32] amen not only is he the beginning but he
[47:34] is also
[47:35] the end amen
[47:38] so we look at god and we look at his
[47:40] foreknowledge we look at his knowledge
[47:41] period his omniscience knowing that
[47:43] there is not anything that he doesn't
[47:46] know
[47:47] how many believes that nothing that he
[47:50] doesn't know and whatever he did
[47:53] he did where where did he do it before
[47:56] he actually anything ever happened
[47:58] was before the first start us was made
[48:01] for his first hour
[48:02] before the first thing ever was created
[48:05] amen
[48:05] he had thoughts isn't that right
[48:08] he had his thinking amen
[48:12] amen and so i began to think about that
[48:14] how that
[48:15] you know his thinking is what the is the
[48:18] bible you know the bible was manifested
[48:21] through prophets and
[48:22] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[48:24] god amen
[48:25] so god wrote the bible so we know that
[48:28] this here
[48:29] is exactly what god was thinking
[48:32] before he made the first stardust before
[48:34] he ever created the first thought
[48:37] amen and isn't it something that's
[48:40] what's what i really like about it is
[48:42] that job god asks
[48:43] job in his distress
[48:47] amen he asks him he said now where
[48:50] was you right you know before i laid the
[48:54] foundation of the world where was you
[48:56] declared to me
[48:57] where he was now i don't know if job
[49:01] knew exactly what god was trying to tell
[49:04] him do you
[49:05] he may not have understood it but you
[49:07] and i are understanding it now and that
[49:10] right
[49:10] because of the opening of the seals
[49:12] because of the opening of the book of
[49:14] revelations and so forth
[49:16] we see that god amen wasn't even god at
[49:19] one time
[49:20] and maybe because it's god means an
[49:21] object of worship
[49:23] amen so way back according to the
[49:25] scriptures we find
[49:27] that before anything happened it
[49:28] happened first in the mind of god
[49:34] praise the lord amen
[49:37] and just to make a long story short
[49:40] let me just read you something would
[49:42] that be all right
[49:46] now remember the statue that
[49:49] you are in this morning brother bam says
[49:52] if you wasn't
[49:53] in his thinking then then you're not now
[49:58] there's some part of you that was it
[50:00] that's eternal and that eternal only
[50:02] belong to god
[50:04] and in god was his thinking of you
[50:07] sitting right where you are now
[50:14] oh praise be to god you know when i got
[50:17] to thinking about how that if you are
[50:20] and
[50:20] that's what we desire in our lives
[50:24] all right is to be in his
[50:27] perfect will now this is permissive well
[50:31] because because i
[50:32] you know his permissive will that's an
[50:34] even a completely another subject
[50:35] altogether
[50:37] because god has this is what i want you
[50:38] to do huh
[50:41] but how many know that even if you get
[50:43] out of his perfect will and you get into
[50:45] his permissive well god knew that you
[50:46] would do that
[50:49] there isn't nothing that god didn't know
[50:54] before it ever started
[50:59] i mean that's what that man i'm telling
[51:01] you what that that's this is not
[51:03] everybody can believe this not everybody
[51:05] wants to believe this
[51:08] amen because we'll show you scriptures
[51:10] where even the works
[51:12] were finished before the world began
[51:16] amen so let's look at first of all
[51:20] for one thing we realize that it all
[51:23] works according to the work uh to his
[51:27] will
[51:27] who worketh all things after the council
[51:30] of his will i mean believes that he does
[51:31] that
[51:32] let's go and i like that because he
[51:34] works all things after his will
[51:36] and and we get into this and this is
[51:39] real this is real touchy because
[51:43] it's teaching teaching is equally
[51:46] dividing the word of truth
[51:48] amen it's trying to make a puzzle fit
[51:50] and if you aren't careful
[51:52] and then you'll have a cow up on top of
[51:54] a tree eating grass
[51:55] it just don't work that way it all has
[51:58] to fit
[51:59] and there's a lot of scriptures a lot of
[52:00] things that look like
[52:02] it meant that he could contradict like
[52:04] the bible could contradict itself
[52:07] now right but we know that can't be
[52:09] because god is too infinite to do that
[52:12] there's not a contradiction if there's
[52:14] it looks like a contradiction
[52:16] it's not a contradiction it is something
[52:18] in our mind that isn't
[52:19] coming into the place that that'll be
[52:22] and with this we go into for
[52:24] the nation we go into predestination and
[52:26] then we go into free will
[52:28] and free of moral agency amen and
[52:32] a lot of times whenever i preach on
[52:34] predestination and foreign knowledge and
[52:36] things like that
[52:36] you know people kind of get to tend to
[52:38] be quiet amen
[52:40] because for one thing most of the time
[52:42] when we talk about those subjects
[52:45] we think that it's something that god
[52:47] all right that god
[52:49] uh you know dictates or so forth
[52:52] or makes do but all all predestination
[52:56] is
[52:56] let me tell you what predestination is
[52:58] according to the prophet predestination
[53:00] the word heart
[53:01] is hard amongst people because now
[53:04] notice
[53:04] he says predestination always looks
[53:08] back to for knowledge
[53:12] that right so we know and
[53:15] foreknowledge looks to destiny and god
[53:17] being infinite
[53:18] in the beginning knew the end from the
[53:21] beginning
[53:22] and therefore he knew the people who
[53:24] would what people
[53:25] would do
[53:28] now he didn't how many knows he didn't
[53:30] come on calvary god didn't
[53:32] come on calvary down in his son amen
[53:34] just have
[53:35] people pity him oh isn't it sad what he
[53:38] did he didn't run his business that way
[53:40] he came for those and he died for those
[53:43] that he
[53:44] knew what they would do
[53:50] this is what excites me this is what
[53:53] really got me on this
[53:54] is the foreknowledge of god knew what
[53:56] you would
[53:57] do what your choice would
[54:01] be
[54:04] see it ties it in perfectly ties it in
[54:08] perfectly
[54:09] it doesn't make it uh separated or
[54:12] confusing
[54:13] amen so if you'll notice
[54:17] that's right amen
[54:22] all right let's go to a scripture and
[54:24] talking about how that
[54:26] first of all for knowledge now for
[54:29] knowledge that's just what it says
[54:30] but it's not really you don't really
[54:33] have to
[54:33] get a dictionary to get that one up
[54:37] you know the little kids might not know
[54:38] what it is but that's
[54:40] knowledge that you had beforehand for
[54:42] knowledge you know
[54:44] earlier knowledge previous knowledge
[54:46] knowledge beforehand
[54:47] all right four knowledge not all that
[54:49] hard something that he knew way
[54:52] back then amen and then he would use
[54:56] what he knew
[54:58] right to cause people
[55:01] and to cause destiny to come into
[55:04] existence
[55:05] right now just imagine
[55:08] if you was in that kind of a position
[55:11] that you knew everything and not only
[55:13] now this is the part that people don't
[55:15] get
[55:16] is that god knows everything and he also
[55:19] has the power
[55:21] to move things around the way that he
[55:25] wants
[55:25] it to work
[55:30] all right praise be to god
[55:34] according to how he wants things to work
[55:37] amen because i believe that uh the
[55:39] scripture talks about haru he got it god
[55:41] works all things after the counsel of
[55:43] his will
[55:44] amen which i think we'll get into all
[55:47] right so let's go
[55:48] next here amen we'll go over to the book
[55:51] of ephesians
[55:52] that's all we go
[55:55] book of ephesians
[56:01] ephesians 1. now notice in
[56:04] chapter 1 verse 3 blessed be the god and
[56:08] father of our lord jesus christ
[56:09] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[56:12] blessings
[56:13] in heavenly places in christ according
[56:17] after he has chosen us
[56:22] in him
[56:26] before the foundation of
[56:32] [Laughter]
[56:34] [Applause]
[56:37] that is so self-explanatory
[56:41] does everybody understand that isn't
[56:43] that real simple
[56:45] it's real simple it's not hard to
[56:47] understand at all that god
[56:49] chose us in him
[56:53] isn't that something how that god can
[56:54] choose us
[56:57] well why would he choose you
[57:01] now why did he choose you because he
[57:03] knew what you would do
[57:05] his foreknowledge it's all about his
[57:07] foreknowledge
[57:08] he knows exactly what you would do amen
[57:13] because i don't believe that god puts
[57:14] something in you to send you to hell
[57:16] huh no we're based on free moral agency
[57:20] isn't that right
[57:21] we all make a choice god never wrote the
[57:23] first name down
[57:24] until he knew what you'd do that's how
[57:27] he could write your name down
[57:29] before the foundation of the world he
[57:32] could write your name down
[57:35] and in that how many knows that there's
[57:37] also a group of people
[57:39] who have their names taken off
[57:42] according to yeah one thing's for sure
[57:45] is you can't just dump
[57:46] something you don't want well i don't
[57:49] want i don't believe in the names not
[57:51] taken on all your names there forever
[57:53] decided the other well there's names
[57:55] that are going to be taken off the book
[57:58] and you know who those is what kind of
[58:00] category you want to see what kind of
[58:01] category
[58:02] those people is and it would take a
[58:03] whole service but over in the old
[58:05] testament
[58:06] if you know this that moses one time he
[58:08] says you know the people have sinned and
[58:10] they
[58:10] were there they fell down before golden
[58:13] calves and everything else
[58:14] amen and moses said i pray thee
[58:17] blot out my name he said lot my name out
[58:21] of the book your book
[58:22] on behalf of them and god says i'll tell
[58:25] you what whose names i'm going to blot
[58:26] out is those who sinned against me he
[58:29] said those
[58:30] and i think dan and benjamin or ephraim
[58:34] one it might have been ephraim and dan
[58:35] and then those two got their tribes they
[58:37] got blotted out because they worshiped
[58:40] idols one of them was for idol worship
[58:43] that they got the names blotted out all
[58:45] right
[58:46] so one of them is for idolatry and
[58:48] here's another reason that your name
[58:50] removed
[58:51] amen and i know that judas was one of
[58:53] those who had their names on the book
[58:54] because he was chosen
[58:56] amen and he was a part of the ministry
[58:57] and everything but he had his name
[58:59] removed because he didn't go on
[59:02] all the way i notice
[59:06] in verse 19 chapter 9 verse 19 of the
[59:09] last chapter of revelation he says
[59:11] if any man shall take away from the
[59:13] words of the book of this prophecy
[59:15] god shall take away his part out of the
[59:18] book of life in other words if i
[59:20] thomas byler add my own idea in this
[59:24] if i add to this word or if i take away
[59:27] from this word
[59:28] that is grounds for having my name
[59:31] removed
[59:34] so how many knows it's kind of important
[59:37] to try to get it right
[59:42] amen you got to get it right you hear
[59:45] people say well now the bible says this
[59:47] but it don't mean that because you
[59:49] better be careful
[59:50] you'll have your name taken out don't
[59:53] say it doesn't mean what it says because
[59:54] it says what it means it means what it
[59:56] says
[59:57] that right amen and the preacher
[1:00:00] especially is on thin
[1:00:01] ground he has to be careful that he uh
[1:00:04] that he says exactly what the word says
[1:00:06] it has to all dovetail
[1:00:08] amen it all has to come together
[1:00:11] praise be to god all right so out of the
[1:00:14] now notice take his part out of the book
[1:00:16] of life and out of the holy city and
[1:00:18] from the things which
[1:00:20] are written therein so he'll have his
[1:00:22] part taken out if
[1:00:24] he takes amen and adds in his word or
[1:00:27] doesn't
[1:00:28] interpret it right praise the lord let
[1:00:30] me ask you a question tonight
[1:00:33] if you was to take the advice if you was
[1:00:35] to believe what a denominational church
[1:00:37] out there just some church whatever
[1:00:39] church it is there's many different ones
[1:00:41] out there
[1:00:41] if you just believe what they said what
[1:00:44] would your chances be of being right
[1:00:51] be pretty slim wouldn't it all right
[1:00:55] now the prophet of god said we ought to
[1:00:57] be the happiest people on the face of
[1:00:58] the earth
[1:01:00] you know why he said that we ought to be
[1:01:02] because we have god come down
[1:01:04] and come down in the platform and when
[1:01:06] the preacher says something
[1:01:07] go out there and vindicate it every time
[1:01:10] as long as the man lived jesus would
[1:01:12] come and he could prove
[1:01:13] that this is the right interpretation
[1:01:15] this is the truth what is your chance
[1:01:17] of being right by believing the gospel
[1:01:20] the bible and the message of this hour
[1:01:25] i'll tell you this your chances are
[1:01:26] pretty good because jesus proved it and
[1:01:29] vindicated and stood behind it
[1:01:31] amen hey i guarantee you if i sit up
[1:01:35] here and say no
[1:01:36] if i tell you the truth if jesus don't
[1:01:38] come and vindicate that he's here
[1:01:40] and then it's really him the resurrected
[1:01:42] christ you ain't got to believe it and
[1:01:44] if he
[1:01:45] he come and do that wouldn't you be
[1:01:48] convinced but see he came already and
[1:01:51] vindicated this message this vindicated
[1:01:53] message don't have to be vindicated
[1:01:54] anymore it's already been vindicated
[1:01:57] for 33 years god vindicated it
[1:02:00] i already i believe it amen i still
[1:02:02] believe god does miracles
[1:02:04] amen amen but i'm not in a position of a
[1:02:08] prophet and god reveals his secrets to
[1:02:10] his servants the prophets
[1:02:11] amen the prophet it means a divine
[1:02:13] interpreter of the word of god
[1:02:16] only really only a prophet has a right
[1:02:18] to interpret it because he speaks
[1:02:20] directly with god
[1:02:21] amen all right and so as long as we
[1:02:24] preach
[1:02:25] what that message says what the bible is
[1:02:27] according to about
[1:02:28] we're going to be fine it's going to be
[1:02:30] safe other than that
[1:02:32] you're not safe at all because there's
[1:02:33] so many different interpretations
[1:02:36] amen where was me book of ephesians
[1:02:38] right
[1:02:39] i kind of got sidetracked a little bit
[1:02:42] praise be to god
[1:02:47] ephesians
[1:02:54] ephesians chapter one
[1:03:02] all right according as he has chosen us
[1:03:05] in him before the foundation of the
[1:03:08] world
[1:03:09] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:03:11] before him
[1:03:13] in love now the first half of that
[1:03:15] sentence is telling you
[1:03:17] when we were chosen and who we were
[1:03:22] chosen and the second part tells us what
[1:03:25] condition that we were predestinated to
[1:03:27] be in
[1:03:28] and that is to be holy and without blame
[1:03:32] before him in love but the work was done
[1:03:34] when
[1:03:37] when we said when was your chosen to be
[1:03:38] without blame and holy
[1:03:40] before the foundation of the world god
[1:03:42] picked you
[1:03:43] he chose you one in there something out
[1:03:47] of jesus will say
[1:03:48] well whosoever will let him come another
[1:03:50] place he'd say
[1:03:52] you have not chosen me but i have chosen
[1:03:54] you
[1:03:57] and ordains you is that right amen
[1:04:00] because i'll tell you this long before
[1:04:02] you chose him
[1:04:04] he chose you already he chose you before
[1:04:07] the foundation's world
[1:04:09] now i want to say this that we are based
[1:04:12] on free moral agents we are
[1:04:14] free moral agents all human beings are
[1:04:16] from all ages
[1:04:17] judas was a female agent and cain was a
[1:04:20] free moral agent
[1:04:21] and jesus and god himself went out of
[1:04:23] his way
[1:04:24] to try to get cain to do right didn't he
[1:04:28] he sure did same with any same with the
[1:04:30] pharisees
[1:04:32] same with the sadducees he says
[1:04:34] whosoever will let him come the
[1:04:36] colleagues
[1:04:37] anybody that wants to come come on god
[1:04:39] is not willing that
[1:04:40] anybody pay he's not willing
[1:04:44] but he sure does know who he's gone and
[1:04:46] who doesn't
[1:04:47] he is the beginning and the end he he
[1:04:50] knew how
[1:04:51] you know even the even the raptures
[1:04:53] already wrote the destruction of the
[1:04:55] worlds already wrote
[1:04:56] amen even the new millenniums already
[1:04:58] wrote the new having a new mirth
[1:04:59] it's all predestinated
[1:05:03] isn't that right
[1:05:08] sure it's all predestinated listen to
[1:05:10] this
[1:05:13] now notice let's go over to
[1:05:17] verse 11. in whom we have obtained an
[1:05:20] inheritance
[1:05:22] being predestinated all right
[1:05:25] according to the purpose of him
[1:05:29] who worketh once in a while something
[1:05:31] after his will
[1:05:34] do you think there's anything out there
[1:05:36] that is not according to what his will
[1:05:38] is
[1:05:40] no there's people that's absolutely lost
[1:05:43] now children that god knew it's going to
[1:05:45] go that way
[1:05:47] who worketh all things after the counsel
[1:05:50] of his will praise be to god
[1:05:54] in 111 and then also 14
[1:05:59] all right down through 14
[1:06:02] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:06:04] glory
[1:06:05] who first trusted in christ in whom he
[1:06:07] also trusteth
[1:06:08] after you have heard the word of truth
[1:06:10] the gospel of your salvation
[1:06:12] in whom also after you believe you were
[1:06:15] sealed
[1:06:15] with the holy spirit of promise which is
[1:06:18] the earnest of our inheritance until the
[1:06:20] redemption
[1:06:21] of the purchased possession unto the
[1:06:23] praise of god so he's saying there
[1:06:25] the baptism of the holy ghost is the
[1:06:27] earnest money it's the
[1:06:29] down payment so to speak amen
[1:06:36] praise be to god you know
[1:06:40] seeing the things if you look carefully
[1:06:44] if you look in the mirror you'll see who
[1:06:46] you are
[1:06:47] it's like looking in that mirror with a
[1:06:49] little boy you'll recognize who you are
[1:06:52] amen and just as jesus talked to the
[1:06:57] pharisees and the scribes and they
[1:06:59] claimed that they were abraham with
[1:07:00] their father and everything you know but
[1:07:02] they simply couldn't hear his words
[1:07:07] you know he that is of god hears god's
[1:07:10] words
[1:07:11] if it's the truth you hear it amen
[1:07:14] you'll come to it just as sure
[1:07:16] as anything but then he went back and
[1:07:19] says no
[1:07:19] you're not abraham's children but you
[1:07:22] are of your father the devil and his
[1:07:24] works will you do
[1:07:25] pretty strong amen
[1:07:28] like i said we've heard it before but
[1:07:30] for some reason god seemed to want me to
[1:07:32] go down this road is that all right
[1:07:35] amen maybe i should just go ahead and go
[1:07:38] a little further while i'm at it would
[1:07:40] that be okay
[1:07:41] because we not we know that jesus taught
[1:07:45] he says you know the world is like a
[1:07:46] field
[1:07:47] and the good sower went forth and he
[1:07:49] sowed good speed
[1:07:51] and then at the tares there's another
[1:07:53] one came in so
[1:07:54] tares amen and then he went to
[1:07:57] explaining what the wheat and the tares
[1:07:59] were he says the
[1:08:00] tares are the children of the wicked one
[1:08:05] and that what he says and then in saint
[1:08:07] john 3 somewhere
[1:08:08] of 312 or somewhere not as cain
[1:08:11] who was of that wicked one
[1:08:16] this is what scares people to death
[1:08:19] is the fact that they're children of god
[1:08:22] and there is children of that serpent
[1:08:27] in this world there's two kinds of
[1:08:29] people in this world
[1:08:31] and the people that are of the devil i
[1:08:33] don't care how much he preached to him
[1:08:35] i don't care uh if you prove to them
[1:08:38] you prove to them without any question
[1:08:42] huh remember that uh preacher that came
[1:08:45] to brother branham he says you know i
[1:08:47] don't believe in divine healing now you
[1:08:48] couldn't get me to believe it and so
[1:08:50] forth you know
[1:08:51] and and he says i'll give a thousand
[1:08:52] dollars to anybody that can prove
[1:08:55] that there's any divine healing and
[1:08:56] brother and went and got an absolute
[1:08:58] affidavit from a doctor stating
[1:09:00] that he was absolutely a miracle he
[1:09:02] showed it to him he said well i got to
[1:09:04] go to texas this side or the other let
[1:09:05] me get a child and cut her
[1:09:07] hand and you heal it then i'll believe
[1:09:09] but the man says when you're shown
[1:09:11] something like that and then you still
[1:09:13] don't believe he says
[1:09:15] election's off
[1:09:19] elections off in other words no other
[1:09:22] gods
[1:09:24] that's pretty strong in it because a
[1:09:27] real child of god down in here
[1:09:29] when the prophet said from down in your
[1:09:30] heart somewhere even as a child you knew
[1:09:33] there was something about it in there
[1:09:35] there was a call there there was
[1:09:37] something there i could bear witness of
[1:09:39] it
[1:09:40] i am a witness that even when i was in
[1:09:42] sin i already knew that there was
[1:09:43] something down in there
[1:09:45] that was different i didn't know what it
[1:09:47] was until i stumbled into
[1:09:49] in a good old service and come across
[1:09:51] the gospel the gospel i
[1:09:52] shine on here and i found out who i was
[1:09:54] and what i was
[1:09:57] amen that's exactly right we know that
[1:09:59] this gospel is what brings us to our
[1:10:01] recognition we know that
[1:10:02] we weren't saved uh we were actually
[1:10:05] saved before the foundation of the world
[1:10:07] even jesus said that the works were done
[1:10:09] amen before the foundation of the world
[1:10:11] that jesus was even crucified before the
[1:10:13] foundation under the war and everything
[1:10:15] else amen
[1:10:16] you might say we're just going through
[1:10:17] the motions we are just going through
[1:10:19] the emotions
[1:10:20] as far as god's concerned
[1:10:23] because it's already written he already
[1:10:26] knows so
[1:10:26] there's no surprises to him whatsoever
[1:10:29] there's nothing new to him
[1:10:31] but what are we doing we're playing our
[1:10:32] part so to speak isn't that right
[1:10:34] we find out in this life amen and the
[1:10:37] choice that we make
[1:10:38] we find out who we really are you've
[1:10:41] heard the phrase
[1:10:42] amen that a man is defined by the
[1:10:45] the choices that he makes is that right
[1:10:47] we bear our fruit you can tell a person
[1:10:49] by the life that they live but what
[1:10:51] choices they make
[1:10:52] tells you who you are
[1:10:56] amen that's why i believe every son of
[1:10:58] god i choose god
[1:11:00] i choose god i might i give my god my
[1:11:03] uh my heart and my all what is it that
[1:11:06] causes you to do that
[1:11:07] something down in here called the seed
[1:11:10] germ
[1:11:11] of god
[1:11:15] everybody else can hear it know it and
[1:11:16] everything else and just walk away
[1:11:20] and there was millions that saw the
[1:11:22] power of god in our generation
[1:11:24] like never can i say this like never in
[1:11:27] all of those stars and all the last 2000
[1:11:29] years
[1:11:30] never was such a display of god world
[1:11:33] over
[1:11:34] at all it was in germany it was in
[1:11:37] england it was certain places but this
[1:11:39] was world over
[1:11:41] that god manifests himself to challenge
[1:11:42] the hindu the buddha
[1:11:44] that seeks to change all of them say if
[1:11:45] your god can open this blind man's eyes
[1:11:48] i will follow your religion anybody
[1:11:51] come on come on up
[1:11:56] that's what he said do it
[1:11:59] but in my lord jesus who i represent not
[1:12:02] him being jesus
[1:12:03] but who i represent who i proclaim to
[1:12:06] you
[1:12:06] the resurrect resurrected jesus christ
[1:12:08] that died two thousand years ago
[1:12:09] died for our sins he is here today if
[1:12:11] he'll open this blind man's eyes how
[1:12:13] many will receive him
[1:12:16] huh and how he knows god opened his eyes
[1:12:18] and thirty thousand
[1:12:20] received it it's not what you did with
[1:12:24] jesus yesterday it's what you do with
[1:12:26] jesus the truth today
[1:12:28] amen praise be to god
[1:12:31] amen all right shall we go a little
[1:12:33] further
[1:12:35] all right ephesians
[1:12:40] romans is another one
[1:12:43] romans 8.
[1:12:48] for we know that all things work
[1:12:49] together for good to them that love god
[1:12:52] to them who are the called
[1:12:54] according to his purpose now we know
[1:12:56] that many are called
[1:12:58] right but jesus said few
[1:13:02] are what chosen by who
[1:13:08] chosen us unto salvation when before the
[1:13:11] foundation of the world
[1:13:13] god did the choosing amen why because
[1:13:17] he knew what you would choose he knew
[1:13:18] what you would do
[1:13:20] his foreknowledge causes them to be able
[1:13:22] to do that
[1:13:24] how many knows we serve a big god and we
[1:13:27] cannot we can
[1:13:28] never try to bring god down to our
[1:13:30] thought
[1:13:31] our idea our doctrine or anything we
[1:13:33] have to open up
[1:13:34] our mind to what god is what he thinks
[1:13:38] the way he thinks
[1:13:39] and what he has said amen
[1:13:42] praise be to god all right
[1:13:47] to the according to his purpose for whom
[1:13:50] he did
[1:13:51] for no that's pretty simple all right
[1:13:54] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:13:58] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:14:00] the firstborn among men and brethren
[1:14:02] moreover who he predestinate
[1:14:06] them he also call praise be to god
[1:14:10] and whom he called them he also
[1:14:12] justified whom he justified
[1:14:14] them he also glorified
[1:14:19] amen praise be to god how many knows
[1:14:22] that this was all done
[1:14:24] before one star was created we
[1:14:27] experienced
[1:14:28] it in our life in that right by
[1:14:30] experiencing
[1:14:31] salvation justification sanctification
[1:14:36] and also glorified our prophet explained
[1:14:39] to us that
[1:14:39] we have a theophany waiting for us if we
[1:14:42] would die and drop dead before this
[1:14:43] service is over
[1:14:45] huh there's another body waiting
[1:14:47] according to
[1:14:48] paul if this earthly tabernacle of this
[1:14:50] house will be dissolved
[1:14:52] we have one already waiting for us in
[1:14:54] heaven you know right
[1:14:55] we've won that's our glorified body is
[1:14:58] already over there
[1:14:59] so we are already glorified amen praise
[1:15:02] be to god
[1:15:04] now notice and what shall we say then
[1:15:07] these things if god before us who
[1:15:10] can be against us
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:13] praise be to god who can be against us
[1:15:17] amen verse 9
[1:15:21] chapter 9 verse 11. all right
[1:15:25] verse 11 he says it this way
[1:15:28] well let's go back a little bit shall i
[1:15:31] let's go to ten and not only this but
[1:15:32] when rebecca
[1:15:33] also had conceived by one even by one
[1:15:37] father isaac for the children being yet
[1:15:40] not
[1:15:40] born neither having done any good or
[1:15:43] evil for the that the purpose of god
[1:15:45] according to election
[1:15:47] might stand not of works but of him that
[1:15:50] calleth
[1:15:52] it said unto her the elder shall serve
[1:15:55] the younger
[1:15:56] and it is written jacob have i loved but
[1:15:59] esau
[1:15:59] have i hated before they had done
[1:16:14] amen says this way god could say he so
[1:16:17] have i hated jacob ever loved
[1:16:18] because he foreknew what they would be
[1:16:25] amen because he knew how esau
[1:16:29] would be amen
[1:16:32] amen praise be to god what shall we say
[1:16:35] that is their unrighteousness with god
[1:16:38] and that's where people think there's
[1:16:39] unrighteousness with god they think that
[1:16:41] god makes you do this god makes you do
[1:16:42] that let me tell you something i
[1:16:46] thank god for everything that he has
[1:16:48] predestinated in my life
[1:16:50] you know why because so many times
[1:16:54] before
[1:16:54] i even pray for something before i even
[1:16:57] ask for something
[1:16:58] i have a need of something and god will
[1:17:01] just supply it right there how many has
[1:17:02] ever been there
[1:17:06] you say boy that couldn't have worked
[1:17:07] out better you know
[1:17:09] and that or you'll pray for something
[1:17:11] and it almost happened instantly
[1:17:12] what is it god knows what you have
[1:17:16] need of the bible says before you
[1:17:19] even ask if you're a son of god or
[1:17:23] daughter of god
[1:17:24] he supplies your niece he'll take care
[1:17:26] of you he knows that you have need of
[1:17:28] clothing and food
[1:17:29] seek first the kingdom and all these
[1:17:31] things shall be added unto you
[1:17:33] not if you beg for him first no he shall
[1:17:36] be added unto you
[1:17:37] god is watching out for our lives aren't
[1:17:39] you thankful for that
[1:17:41] and i don't know about you but my
[1:17:42] heart's desires lord just help me
[1:17:44] to find that perfect will that you have
[1:17:47] in my life and i believe i'm where i'm
[1:17:48] god wants me to be
[1:17:50] i believe i'm serving this purpose i'm
[1:17:52] happy with that
[1:17:54] amen sometimes i think well i'd assure
[1:17:56] the like i've been a missionary go out
[1:17:58] there you know and
[1:17:59] really have to stretch my faith and you
[1:18:01] know and see god do great things out
[1:18:03] there and so forth and i was like what
[1:18:04] did i ever do
[1:18:05] more missionary work why didn't i go out
[1:18:06] there and do more
[1:18:08] then i think baby well isn't that what
[1:18:10] god wanted you to do
[1:18:12] you're doing what god wanted you to do
[1:18:15] amen
[1:18:16] that's why i think sometimes listen if
[1:18:18] god is blessing you where you're at
[1:18:21] and you believe that you're in god's
[1:18:23] will
[1:18:24] be your lord i thought dear lord stay
[1:18:27] right where you are
[1:18:29] because well i'll tell you you get out
[1:18:30] of that will and you can get into
[1:18:32] chaos if you get in the permissive will
[1:18:35] of god you watch god's hand come down
[1:18:37] on you because lord his child and he
[1:18:40] isn't an old granddaddy
[1:18:42] yeah uh he isn't no grandfather no
[1:18:46] he is a daddy he is he will whoop you
[1:18:51] amen aren't you glad for that though
[1:18:54] straighten your back up bring you right
[1:18:55] back in line
[1:18:57] praise be to god all right
[1:19:00] let's go a little further
[1:19:04] all right for he saith to moses i will
[1:19:06] have mercy on whom i will have mercy and
[1:19:08] i will have compassion on whom i will
[1:19:10] have compassion
[1:19:12] there's people that think they can tell
[1:19:13] god what to do
[1:19:15] let me tell you something ain't nobody
[1:19:16] going to tell god what to do
[1:19:19] ain't nobody going to tell god that he's
[1:19:20] unjust
[1:19:22] he knows exactly who to have mercy on on
[1:19:24] and who not to have mercy on
[1:19:28] because they know what they'll do and so
[1:19:31] then it is not of him that willeth nor
[1:19:33] of him that runneth but god
[1:19:34] that shows mercy for the scripture saith
[1:19:37] unto pharaoh
[1:19:38] even for this purpose have i raised thee
[1:19:41] up that i might show my power in thee
[1:19:44] and that my name might be declared
[1:19:46] throughout all the earth
[1:19:51] god knew that pharaoh was going to be a
[1:19:53] rascal
[1:19:55] he know that pharaoh was stubborn isn't
[1:19:58] that right
[1:19:59] he knew that he would never let him go
[1:20:02] he knew what was in pharaoh's heart he
[1:20:04] says i'm telling you what
[1:20:05] i'm going to make you and even he even
[1:20:08] hardened pharaoh's heart
[1:20:12] there was no injustice in that because
[1:20:14] he already knew exactly what pharaoh
[1:20:15] would do
[1:20:16] and how he would
[1:20:22] therefore hath he mercy on whom we will
[1:20:24] have mercy and whom he will
[1:20:27] he hardeneth praise be to god
[1:20:31] thou wilt say then unto me why does he
[1:20:34] yet find fault for who has resisted his
[1:20:36] will
[1:20:37] but no man who art i that replies
[1:20:39] against god shall the thing form say
[1:20:41] unto him that formed it
[1:20:42] why hast thou made me thus
[1:20:46] had not potter power over the clay of
[1:20:48] the same lump to make one vessel
[1:20:50] unto honor and another unto dishonor
[1:20:54] amen sure he does praise the lord
[1:20:59] let's go to another scripture talking
[1:21:01] about before the foundation of the world
[1:21:03] did i read the one in first corinthians
[1:21:05] let's go to first corinthians 1.
[1:21:26] huh
[1:21:28] i'm gonna try second corinthians because
[1:21:30] that's not the right one
[1:21:36] if that's not it we'll move over to the
[1:21:38] next one
[1:21:41] nope that's not it either i don't know
[1:21:43] why i've got that wrote down but we'll
[1:21:45] go to
[1:21:46] second timothy go to second timothy with
[1:21:48] me would you
[1:21:52] second timothy 1 8 and 9.
[1:21:56] be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[1:21:58] testimony of our lord nor
[1:22:00] of the me his prisoner but be thou
[1:22:03] partaker
[1:22:04] of the afflictions of the gospel
[1:22:05] according to the power of god
[1:22:07] who has saved us and called us with a
[1:22:11] holy calling
[1:22:13] not according to our works but according
[1:22:16] to his own
[1:22:17] purpose and grace which was given
[1:22:20] us in christ jesus before
[1:22:25] the world began
[1:22:30] let's give the lord a hand praise be to
[1:22:32] god
[1:22:33] hallelujah
[1:22:37] and you know what else you know why i
[1:22:39] believe that's why jesus said so much he
[1:22:41] says
[1:22:42] blessed are your ears
[1:22:45] if they can hear blessed are your
[1:22:49] eyes of understanding
[1:22:52] because they can understand blessed are
[1:22:56] you
[1:22:56] many prophets and different ones look to
[1:22:58] seedy things and have not seen them
[1:23:01] but blessed are you if you listen to
[1:23:04] think about this
[1:23:05] if you have given your heart
[1:23:11] unreserved absolutely signified
[1:23:13] back to you that he has accepted you
[1:23:16] that you are a part of him that you have
[1:23:18] given your life to him you've been
[1:23:20] baptized in his name fills you with the
[1:23:22] holy ghost you know what that means
[1:23:24] that means that you were in his thinking
[1:23:26] and that you've got your name
[1:23:28] written on that book of life and you
[1:23:31] ought to
[1:23:33] be the happiest person on the face of
[1:23:35] the world
[1:23:37] you might say well you made your choice
[1:23:38] yeah you did have the how many knows we
[1:23:40] all got a choice
[1:23:42] we all have to come you all have to
[1:23:43] accept that amen and god knew who
[1:23:45] wouldn't
[1:23:46] that's why it's a different subject but
[1:23:48] listen you tie that in and it's exactly
[1:23:50] god knew you would
[1:23:52] and if you did you are ought to be the
[1:23:54] happiest person
[1:23:56] in the world to know that not just
[1:24:00] he know that before the foundation of
[1:24:01] the world but he knows that you would
[1:24:04] be saved and he would actually lead you
[1:24:07] he would guide you
[1:24:10] how many has ever had uh sure we've had
[1:24:13] times where we just have to decide well
[1:24:15] do i want to move here
[1:24:17] or don't i want to move here do i want
[1:24:19] to get this job or do i want to do this
[1:24:21] and we don't
[1:24:22] get confused don't we all sometimes
[1:24:27] and then we finally do something right
[1:24:30] but to think that god knew that you'd
[1:24:32] have that
[1:24:33] and then he knew what choice you would
[1:24:35] make and the
[1:24:37] big thing about it is if you're a son
[1:24:38] and daughter of god you got down on your
[1:24:40] knees and say god what do you want me to
[1:24:42] do
[1:24:44] amen and god guides you right into what
[1:24:46] you're supposed to do
[1:24:49] amen he blesses you and he keeps you
[1:24:51] right there isn't that right
[1:24:52] how many is glad for that amen
[1:24:56] so god is never confused we get confused
[1:24:58] sometimes when we think well
[1:25:00] i made this choice but let how many
[1:25:02] knows you don't want to lead yourself
[1:25:05] no sheep have to have a leader they have
[1:25:07] to have
[1:25:08] a shepherd we as children of god we have
[1:25:10] to have a separate lord
[1:25:12] lead me amen that's why we say lord lead
[1:25:15] us into all truth
[1:25:20] how in the world are can they gonna say
[1:25:22] whosoever will let him come and another
[1:25:24] place talk no man come
[1:25:26] come unto me my father draw him many are
[1:25:28] called but few are chosen isn't that
[1:25:30] right
[1:25:31] over there it talks about their name put
[1:25:33] on the lamb book of life from the
[1:25:34] foundation of the world many places
[1:25:37] am i right all wander after the beast
[1:25:39] whose names were not put on that lambo
[1:25:41] because god knew and he wrote that name
[1:25:43] down
[1:25:44] but they still have to play that part
[1:25:46] out they'll still wonder
[1:25:49] if their names aren't there please be
[1:25:52] aren't you glad to serve a god that has
[1:25:54] it together

[1:26:04] called the laodicea age
[1:26:07] people are going to be rich and they're

[1:28:52] to him that hath to him shall be given
[1:28:55] to him that hath not
[1:28:56] from him shall be taken even that which
[1:28:58] he had
[1:29:00] got to have the germ of eternal life was
[1:29:02] in
[1:29:03] you at the beginning and you were there
[1:29:05] you were in his thinking
[1:29:07] your name and all another place he says

[1:29:20] he didn't know
[1:29:25] that's right in your parents conception
[1:29:29] he was chosen by him out of a million
[1:29:32] to live in the first place
[1:29:37] aren't you glad for that
[1:29:40] your name and all and he by
[1:29:42] foreknowledge ordained you
[1:29:45] to see this and you
[1:29:49] that would that was not ordained
[1:29:52] you'll never see it another place the
[1:29:55] prophet of god said he says
[1:29:57] those predestinated ones are really the
[1:30:00] only ones that's even
[1:30:01] considered in redemption
[1:30:06] because that's the only ones that's
[1:30:07] going to accept it that's the only one
[1:30:09] that's going to be redeemed
[1:30:10] is the one he's written that name on and
[1:30:13] when that last name
[1:30:15] is redeemed because remember redeem
[1:30:18] means to bring something back
[1:30:20] that was lost amen
[1:30:23] a part of god that was lost
[1:30:26] when adam and eve fell amen
[1:30:30] but even now god still has his children
[1:30:33] that he has that he had in his thinking
[1:30:35] for the foundation of the world i'm so
[1:30:37] glad for that i'm glad by god's grace
[1:30:42] that i am in fellowship with him that
[1:30:45] you're in fellowship with him
[1:30:48] and you can know that if you ever and
[1:30:50] the prophet put it this way he says
[1:30:52] if you have eternal life
[1:30:55] if you have it then you always was with
[1:30:58] god
[1:30:59] amen because you was a part of god
[1:31:03] and it shows you it shows you that you
[1:31:05] was a part of god
[1:31:06] from the very beginning amen but you
[1:31:09] can't really say that if you don't have
[1:31:10] eternal life
[1:31:12] you don't know yet who you are or what
[1:31:14] you are
[1:31:15] but once you have that eternal life then
[1:31:18] you know that you
[1:31:19] are a part of him and you can no more
[1:31:21] pass away
[1:31:22] then god can pass away you love him
[1:31:25] god bless you let's stand this evening
[1:31:27] musicians if you'll come
[1:31:33] two thoughts i had on and that is lord
[1:31:34] jesus i am so thankful
[1:31:38] that i have made my choice
[1:31:41] to follow jesus i have decided
[1:31:44] to follow jesus no turning back no
[1:31:47] turning back
[1:31:48] because that choice that i made showed
[1:31:52] that i was in his thinking showed that
[1:31:55] my name must have been on that book
[1:31:58] god must have known that that's the way
[1:32:00] that i would choose
[1:32:02] because those pharisees and so forth man
[1:32:05] even though
[1:32:07] lazarus rose from the dead
[1:32:10] it still didn't convince them
[1:32:13] they wanted to go kill address get rid
[1:32:15] of death what kind of
[1:32:17] unbelief darkness that they're living in
[1:32:22] rejecters of jesus christ
[1:32:25] rejected of the vindicated word shows
[1:32:29] who they really are that they were not
[1:32:32] god's children
