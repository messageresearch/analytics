[9:25] the 14th chapter The Book of John the
[9:28] 14th chapter and then also I want to
[9:30] look in the book of Hebrews the 11th
[9:32] chapter but we just have a few things
[9:34] here tonight upon our heart and we just
[9:36] pray that something can be said to bless

[9:59] Devil's past and we're here on the other
[10:01] side of it amen amen The Book of John

[10:06] and the 12th verse and just before we
[10:09] read the word let's just buy our hearts
[10:10] together tonight amen and let's just
[10:13] speak to the author tonight Heavenly
[10:14] Father Lord as your Believers have
[10:16] gathered here on this beautiful Saturday
[10:18] afternoon
[10:19] Lord I know to the world it's a day of
[10:22] relaxation it's a day of pleasure Lord
[10:24] It's a day of activities father Lord to
[10:27] some may have so misinterpreted your
[10:29] word that they've Lord made it the day
[10:31] of the Sabbath Lord the father as
[10:34] Believers here tonight we're not here to
[10:36] honor a Creed or to honor a Doctrine or
[10:39] to honor an idea but Lord to us it's
[10:42] another day to serve you it's another
[10:43] day to live for you and to come into
[10:46] your house and to come into your
[10:48] presence and Lord to lift up holy hands
[10:50] father hands that once held things that
[10:52] were Lord displeasing in your sight
[10:54] hands that went and and feet that took
[10:57] us places we should have never been Lord
[10:59] but father by your blood you've redeemed
[11:01] us out of every tongue and every nation
[11:03] or whatever Kindred oh God the Father
[11:06] you brought us under the umbrella of
[11:08] your word and Lord as we come here
[11:09] tonight we've come to do one thing and
[11:11] that is to lift up the name that is
[11:13] above every name that's not the name of
[11:15] a man but it's the name of the Lord
[11:17] Jesus Christ for Lord we know that if
[11:19] that name every knee has to Bow every
[11:22] tongue has to confess Lord every devil
[11:24] is defeated at the mentioning of the
[11:26] name of Jesus so Lord we're inviting you
[11:28] tonight may you may you come in this
[11:30] building may you take the preeminence
[11:32] Among Us Lord father may you drive out
[11:34] every Spirit that's unlike the Holy
[11:36] Spirit Lord may you bring an anointing
[11:38] father Lord may you bring an atmosphere
[11:40] into the building tonight Lord that
[11:42] hearts and lives could be changed oh God
[11:44] lord we know there's needs father but
[11:46] Lord we know the need meter you are the
[11:49] Waymaker so tonight Lord we surrender
[11:51] Our Lives into your hands come have your
[11:54] way Among Us Lord Reveal Your word to us
[11:56] and we'll be sure to give you all the
[11:58] praise all the honor and all the glory
[12:00] for it to do thy Wonderful Name the name
[12:02] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we
[12:05] pray and all the believer says
[12:08] a man and amen The Book of John the 14th
[12:11] chapter and in the 12th verse Jesus
[12:14] you're speaking of the power of the
[12:15] Believers and he says verily verily I
[12:18] say unto you he that believeth on me the
[12:23] works that I do shall he do also and
[12:26] Greater Works than these shall he do
[12:28] because I go unto my father now the
[12:32] prophet of God makes it very plain that
[12:34] you're not going to do greater in
[12:35] quality but you'll do greater in
[12:38] quantity so he said he stopped nature
[12:39] raised the day and healed the sick so
[12:41] you're not you're going to do something
[12:42] he didn't do but actually you're going
[12:44] to do more of it because now he is in
[12:47] you whatsoever ye shall see or else if
[12:50] you shall ask in my name he says that
[12:52] well I do that the father may be
[12:55] glorified in the son now watch this if
[12:58] ye shall ask anything in my name he says
[13:01] I will do it amen if you shall ask
[13:05] anything in my name amen I will do it
[13:09] now if we turn to the book of Hebrews
[13:10] the 11th chapter I know you're very
[13:12] familiar with this reading
[13:14] in Hebrews 11 but I think here is where
[13:18] we find uh the source of the power to
[13:21] ask those things in his name in Hebrews
[13:24] the 11th chapter we want to look in the
[13:26] very first verse Paul here writing he
[13:30] says now Faith is the substance of
[13:33] things hopeful
[13:35] it's the evidence of Things Not Seen
[13:38] for by it the elders obtained a good
[13:41] report so for by faith the elders
[13:44] obtained a good report verse 3 through
[13:47] faith we understand that the worlds were
[13:50] framed by the word of God so that the
[13:53] things which are seen were not made of
[13:56] things which do appear amen we ask the
[14:00] Lord this evening to add the blessing
[14:01] and to the reading of his word as you
[14:02] can have your seats here this afternoon
[14:05] uh from those passages of scripture this
[14:07] afternoon I want you by the help of the
[14:09] Lord to speak to here for a few moments
[14:11] and if I entitle this and I I want to
[14:13] speak to you on the bride's uh Paradox
[14:16] the brides Paradox you know I I believe
[14:19] that we're living in a season amen of
[14:21] paradox don't you I believe we're
[14:23] leaving it living in a season amen where
[14:25] God is among the church and he's doing
[14:27] Mighty Miracles he's doing Mighty
[14:30] powerful wonderful uh things that Minds
[14:32] cannot even understand or comprehend and
[14:35] then because it's not a minute but it's
[14:36] the Lord himself doing it you know as
[14:39] you as your Believers you're well Tall
[14:41] you know that the prophet of God will
[14:43] actually preach about six times a sermon
[14:45] called Paradox and in 1963 he says now
[14:49] according to Webster a paradox is
[14:51] something that seems incredible but it's
[14:54] true so therefore Paradox he said would
[14:56] be the same as a miracle a paradox is
[14:59] when something that seems like it
[15:01] couldn't be he said the knowledge of the
[15:03] human mind is all together incredible
[15:06] amen but yet it's proven true now a
[15:09] miracle would be the same thing for a
[15:11] miracle cannot be explained so when you
[15:13] actually see the word paradox you can
[15:16] interchange that word with the word
[15:18] miracle because a paradox actually is a
[15:20] miracle amen and a miracle is a paradox
[15:23] he said now a miracle would be the same
[15:25] thing he said it's something that
[15:27] happens and you cannot explain it he
[15:29] said see that makes it a paradox it's
[15:31] incredible but yet it's the truth and
[15:34] our people today he said a lot of
[15:36] modernists believe that the days of
[15:37] Miracles are yes I don't even believe in
[15:39] such a thing as Miracle he said but yet
[15:41] I believe that the world is full of
[15:43] paradoxes I believe and then that the
[15:46] world is full of Miracles I believe amen
[15:49] that the Paradox is constantly so this
[15:52] is not something amen that's just
[15:54] happening once in a while it's not
[15:56] something just happening once a year or
[15:58] twice a year amen but a paradox the
[16:00] prophet of God said is something that
[16:02] has happened and constantly amen because
[16:05] it's a miracle and we know who is The
[16:07] Miracle Worker amen The Miracle Worker
[16:10] is the Holy Spirit The Miracle Worker
[16:12] amen is Christ now if you study Through
[16:15] the Bible you'll see that the Bible
[16:16] actually specifically uh Records about
[16:19] 45 Miracles amen of Christ beginning
[16:22] with him turning water into wine amen at
[16:25] the marriage when they ran out of wine
[16:27] now as I'll say this tonight maybe if I
[16:29] can just maybe make a declaration here
[16:31] amen I believe that we have seen
[16:33] Miracles how many would agree amen we've
[16:35] seen Miracles I believe amen that we are
[16:38] seeing Miracles I believe that right now
[16:40] amen we're seeing Miracles but I also
[16:43] believe amen that we shall see Miracles
[16:45] so payment we have seen Miracles we are
[16:47] seeing Miracles and we shall see
[16:49] Miracles amen because the god of Miracle
[16:52] has returned to the church in the form
[16:55] of the anointed word now the prophet of
[16:57] God makes it very plain he says anything
[16:59] amen that's out of the ordinary gets a
[17:02] miracle anything that is out of the
[17:04] ordinary that is a miracle so you say
[17:07] well amen I'm just an ordinary Christian
[17:09] well if you as an ordinary Christian
[17:10] amen you would be in church on a
[17:12] Saturday night because ordinary
[17:14] Christians and then they don't go to
[17:15] church on Saturday night if you was an
[17:17] ordinary Christian you wouldn't still be
[17:19] believing after everything you've been
[17:21] through amen if you was an ordinary
[17:23] Christian you still wouldn't have a love
[17:25] in your heart and a desire eight men to
[17:27] hear the things of God Amen but because
[17:29] you're a miracle amen you're not an
[17:32] ordinary Christian you are a miracle you
[17:34] are a paradox amen and after everything
[17:36] that you've been through amen you're
[17:39] still believing you're still confessing
[17:41] amen and you're still moving forward
[17:42] amen because you yourself are a paradox
[17:46] now when you start thinking about this
[17:48] Paradox the prophet says it very
[17:50] beautiful but I said world is full of
[17:52] paradox amen now do you realize out of
[17:55] all the planets tonight there's only one
[17:57] that's mentioned in the Bible
[17:59] there's Mars Neptune Jupiter there's all
[18:02] these planets but there's only one
[18:03] mission in the Bible amen and that is
[18:06] the earth that you're setting on Amen
[18:08] and the Bible says that we understand
[18:09] that the worlds were framed by the word
[18:12] of God
[18:13] amen so that the things which are seen
[18:15] and they're not made of things which do
[18:18] appear now the prophets of this very
[18:20] Earth that we're sitting on is a paradox
[18:22] what is it amen it's the word of God
[18:24] made manifest amen he made it without
[18:27] anything to make it out of Amen the only
[18:30] thing he had was his word amen and his
[18:33] word is a creation in itself and then
[18:36] his word is a creation in itself he said
[18:39] then when it's once spoke the word it
[18:42] can never return to him until it's
[18:44] accomplished amen that which it is
[18:47] restore amen he said all his word cannot
[18:50] return amen until it is accomplished
[18:52] that which it's been spoken for amen God
[18:55] is waiting this afternoon Amen on a
[18:58] people that'll take a hold of that word
[19:00] amen and they will hold it until it's
[19:02] accomplished amen that which it is
[19:04] purposeful listen if God sends his word
[19:07] amen he does not send it by accident he
[19:10] does not send it by chance it is not
[19:12] send it by happenstance amen but if God
[19:15] sends his word he said he sent his word
[19:18] and he healed the people amen then his
[19:20] word is the Healer his word is to
[19:22] deliver his word is the Waymaker amen
[19:25] and if his word is in the church tonight
[19:27] amen that his word will not come into a
[19:30] meeting and return unto him void amen
[19:33] but if he sends his word to deliver
[19:34] somebody's going to get delivered and he
[19:37] sent his word to heal somebody's going
[19:39] to get healed if he sends his word to
[19:41] bring you an answer somebody's going to
[19:43] receive an answer listen we are not
[19:45] following the call of our image
[19:54] and he's the same yesterday today and
[19:56] forever amen and his word is never
[19:59] failed amen it will never fail amen
[20:01] because heaven Earth will pass away amen
[20:04] but my words shall never pass away
[20:06] because it's a word and it's a creative
[20:09] word and God is looking for somebody
[20:11] Amen to take a hold of that word oh man
[20:14] it cannot return void hey man
[20:18] it can cause it to authoritative amen
[20:20] creative word now amen do you realize
[20:22] what kind of words you're taking a hold
[20:24] of you're taking a hold of creative word
[20:26] then what that tells me brother Tom
[20:28] Thomas is we are under the power of a
[20:31] creative word now I tell you what a
[20:33] prophet said he said every man and woman
[20:35] in here has everlasting life by the
[20:39] creative word of God who's spoke things
[20:43] into existence and then then the god
[20:45] that is in your life is the card that is
[20:48] spoke the world into existence he's the
[20:51] god that hung the moon he placed the
[20:53] Stars he put the sun in its place come
[20:55] on church amen and that God Amen is in
[20:58] you tonight by the baptism of the Holy
[21:01] Ghost listen amen if the devil give you
[21:04] eternal life the devil can take it away
[21:06] amen but the devil didn't give it to you
[21:09] so the devil can't take it from you even
[21:11] because the same God Hallelujah the same
[21:14] God Amen that said let there be a son
[21:17] and let there be a moon it's the same
[21:19] God that spoke over your line and spoke
[21:21] into the depths of your soul and placed
[21:24] a seed of life in there listen friends
[21:26] amen I'm not talking about an imaginary
[21:28] God I'm talking about the God of John 1.
[21:31] in the beginning was the word and the
[21:34] Word was with God and the Word was God
[21:36] Amen and the Word was made flesh and
[21:39] dwelt Among Us amen see them the scope
[21:41] can word cannot be taken back for a
[21:44] mistake
[21:47] the spoken word cannot be taken back
[21:51] from a stake he said in the beginning
[21:53] was the word now the word of God written
[21:56] in the Bible is just to us Amen in every
[21:59] promise has the same power of creation
[22:01] behind it he said that's God's word did
[22:04] at the beginning he meant if we believe
[22:06] it to be the word of God he said it
[22:09] depends on where the seed Falls amen if
[22:12] it falls into a ground that can create
[22:14] that has a moisture and a nourishment
[22:16] around the promise of God it'll bring
[22:19] forth every promise that the Bible made
[22:21] he said in the right mental attitude
[22:23] towards any Divine promise of God Amen
[22:27] will bring it to pass if you'll just
[22:29] look at it and take care of the word
[22:31] amen because the infinite God spoke and
[22:34] it's his word then do you realize who
[22:36] you are amen you're not just church
[22:38] members amen but the Book of Luke says
[22:42] there were four types of ground amen and
[22:44] there were four seed different types of
[22:47] seed rather rather one seed fell into
[22:49] four different types of ground amen I'll
[22:51] get it straight in a minute four types
[22:52] of ground one seed amen and there was
[22:54] only one type of ground a man that
[22:56] brought forth a fruit amen because it
[22:59] was a good ground and the prophet
[23:01] identifies amen that a good ground is a
[23:03] creative ground then do you realize what
[23:06] you are tonight is you are a creative
[23:08] ground Amen to receive a creative word
[23:11] amen and there's a power behind that
[23:13] word there's an anointing behind that
[23:16] word there's a Deliverance behind that
[23:18] word there's a power behind that word
[23:20] listen listen friends it's your turn to
[23:23] speak amen it's your turn to believe
[23:25] amen it's your turn to be a miracle it's
[23:28] your turn to see the Red Sea open it's
[23:30] your turn to shout the Jericho walls
[23:32] down it's your turn ain't meant to
[23:34] believe God for the impossible amen it's
[23:37] your turn to step out amen and speak to
[23:40] the mountain and the mountain have to be
[23:45] amen and someday somehow maybe some way
[23:48] by the time we'll get good enough amen
[23:51] but let me give you a disclaimer amen if
[23:53] you memorize every word and every take
[23:56] there is you'll never be good enough
[23:58] without the baptism
[24:00] of the Holy Ghost amen so God has
[24:04] provided a propitiation Amen to put a
[24:07] bride amen back on the speaking terms
[24:09] with God and she can stand before any
[24:11] obstacle she can stand before he mounted
[24:14] and she can declare greater is he that
[24:16] is in me and he that is in the enemy
[24:19] against me
[24:21] yes sir if he abide in me and my word in
[24:24] you then you ask what you will and it
[24:27] shall be given to you come on Church
[24:29] Moses stood there and said let there be
[24:32] frogs and the prophet of God say if the
[24:34] blood of a bull or a goat amen be used
[24:37] for a bleach which can only cover amen
[24:40] could put a man in position are you
[24:42] hearing me could put a man in position
[24:44] to speak the creative word and bring
[24:47] flies into existence amen then why would
[24:50] you stumble at The Bleach of Jesus
[24:52] Christ blood which could speak us coil
[24:55] into existence amen the same as he did a
[24:58] frog a bone church and then if somebody
[25:01] tonight somebody told me one time
[25:02] brother they said you know what amen if
[25:04] you're so big on this spoken word amen
[25:06] then where's your squirrels you know
[25:09] y'all forgive me okay hey but if you're
[25:11] going to ask me a dumb question you're
[25:13] going to get a dumb answer okay I'm not
[25:16] squirrel hunting
[25:18] I don't need squirrels tonight I'm not
[25:20] squirrel hunting amen well if you got
[25:22] that Turtle then why aren't you speaking
[25:24] the storms amen cause I'm not out in
[25:27] nature hunting tonight amen but I'm in
[25:29] the poop head and I'm preaching the word
[25:31] of God and I need an atmosphere amen I
[25:34] need a pool of feet amen I need an
[25:36] answer amen so I'm not going to speak
[25:38] for something that I don't have neither
[25:40] of Amen I'm going to speak for something
[25:43] I need and some of you all need your
[25:45] babies to be saved you need your Revival
[25:47] back you need your joy restored you need
[25:50] the peace of God Amen to come into your
[25:52] life and the only way it's going to
[25:54] happen is if the god of paradox ain't
[25:57] been coming to your soul and anoint your
[26:00] faith to believe amen it only takes one
[26:02] believer it only takes one believer amen
[26:05] see a paradox amen if God can just get
[26:08] one man that he can wrap his Spirit into
[26:11] him he said he'll tell the rest of it
[26:13] there will be an another Paradox until
[26:16] he can get someone that is completely
[26:19] surrendered he said that's the way God
[26:22] does his work is he uses paradoxes he's
[26:26] got to get someone who is completely
[26:29] surrendered now you all know we are
[26:31] either surrender to God or we're
[26:34] surrendered to Satan
[26:41] or were surrendered to Satan now the
[26:43] problem of God shows you that the maniac
[26:45] of gadera he said he was surrendered to
[26:48] the devil he said he was cutting himself
[26:49] he said that was the devil's power he
[26:52] said if you ever seen somebody with
[26:55] double their power it's a maniac they're
[26:58] completely annoying to a Satan
[27:01] are you hearing me they are completely
[27:03] Anointed with Satan he said but if
[27:06] satanic power amen gives them twice
[27:08] their strength he said if a person
[27:10] completely surrendered to the devil will
[27:13] give him twice his strength amen then
[27:15] what will a man who is completely
[27:18] surrender to God do Oh Glory if a man
[27:22] can so surrender to the devil that he
[27:24] can actually become completely anointed
[27:27] amen with a devil power and he can bind
[27:30] himself and break himself out of chain
[27:31] amen then what about the Bride of Jesus
[27:34] Christ he said it on me said it'll make
[27:36] you so weak he said maybe you're
[27:38] crippled and you can't stand up amen but
[27:41] if you'll surrender yourself to God and
[27:43] a new life and a new strength comes in
[27:45] you amen you a coach or walking away
[27:49] if the devil can put you down the street
[27:52] that I can get you up if the devil can
[27:54] put you on the bottom the strength of
[27:56] God can lift you to the top and we
[27:58] forgot who we're serving we're not sir
[28:00] Buddha we're not serving Muhammad amen
[28:03] we're serving Jehovah amen and I believe
[28:06] there's some Believers in here tonight
[28:07] that need to reach above your problems
[28:10] you need to reach above your situations
[28:12] you need to reach above your hurts and
[28:14] get a hold of Jehovah amen and pull the
[28:17] streets of Jehovah into your life amen
[28:20] he'll raise you up out of that condition
[28:22] and you'll walk again you'll believe
[28:24] again you'll worship again no praise
[28:27] again you'll see God again you'll enjoy
[28:30] the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost when
[28:33] new life comes in you
[28:37] I love what my Bible says Isaiah said it
[28:39] like this he said the Lord Jehovah is my
[28:42] strength
[28:44] my strengths ain't the Republicans and
[28:47] it sure ain't for Democrats my strength
[28:49] is not be independent and it sure ain't
[28:51] the Liberals my strength is Jehovah can
[28:55] I tell you like this and Isaiah goes on
[28:58] to say trust in Jehovah for in the Lord
[29:01] Jehovah is Everlasting strength that's
[29:05] why you're still here tonight is because
[29:08] in you it's not just the strength of
[29:10] your human ability amen but the strength
[29:13] that's in you is the strength of Jehovah
[29:16] now sometimes I just gotta preach a
[29:19] little bit amen cause I get to thinking
[29:21] amen if we really realized how strong we
[29:23] were hey it'd probably have to sit us
[29:26] down during service amen they'd probably
[29:28] they'd probably think we're a little too
[29:29] loud Brother Brad and then because when
[29:31] it really Dawns on you amen that the
[29:34] strength that's in you it's not the
[29:36] strength from your honestly mother it's
[29:38] not the strength from the earth say
[29:40] father Amen to Sister Nancy the shrinks
[29:42] that's on the inside of you has come
[29:45] from The Experience on the back side of
[29:47] the desert when you met God for yourself
[29:49] and there was a quickening power amen
[29:52] that dropped in your soul alone Church
[29:54] you know what I think we ought to do we
[29:56] ought to tell that devil I'm stronger
[29:58] today than I was yesterday I'm stronger
[30:01] tonight than I was this morning amen and
[30:04] if I'm here tomorrow I'll be stronger
[30:06] tomorrow and if I'm here next week I'll
[30:09] be stronger next week amen because my
[30:12] street amen is not coming from a
[30:14] temporary scores amen not streaks it's
[30:17] coming for Jehovah and he's the Eternal
[30:19] Everlasting infinite God and His shrinks
[30:23] is Everlasting oh my what are you saying
[30:26] I'm saying Jehovah then is the god of
[30:28] paradox and then because sometimes to
[30:31] see a paradox you've got to believe for
[30:34] a long time sometimes to see a paradox
[30:37] you better believe when every physical
[30:39] evidence is giving you reason not to
[30:42] believe amen but something on the inside
[30:44] of you takes a hold of God's word amen
[30:47] and you know what you confess you
[30:49] confess God's word is the truth
[30:54] God's word is the truth now Amen brother
[30:57] when I set you like this probably God
[31:00] tells us that truth is more Stranger
[31:02] Than Fiction do you realize people
[31:04] actually amen believe fiction before
[31:07] they believe and then you all know they
[31:09] tell the story it meant that William
[31:11] Tell put an apple upon this boy's head
[31:14] and he shot the app off of his son's
[31:16] head but you realize that didn't even
[31:18] happen amen but it's fiction and it's so
[31:21] great the minds of people that
[31:23] generation after generation after
[31:25] generation amen fiction has been passed
[31:28] down because it's more it's more amusing
[31:31] maybe than really truth is do you
[31:33] realize the prophet said he was over in
[31:35] France one time he said and then we went
[31:37] up on a hill and he said while I was up
[31:39] there I began to say something and they
[31:40] looked at me and said shh you're not
[31:42] allowed to talk up here he said well why
[31:45] am I not allowed to talk they said
[31:46] because years ago there was a man down
[31:49] in the city who got in a fight and he
[31:51] got killed but he didn't want to die
[31:53] there got his head cut off but he didn't
[31:55] want to die there so the man with his
[31:57] head cut off reaches over picks his head
[31:59] up carries it up the mountain lays it
[32:02] down and dies there and he said now this
[32:04] is a sacred spot come to God said my
[32:07] faith amen is too weak to believe that I
[32:10] had to get on the same page with brother
[32:12] Branham amen my faith is too weak now
[32:15] come on Church there's people that will
[32:17] believe that amen but they will not
[32:19] believe that a cancer can disappear in
[32:21] the body there are people that will
[32:23] believe that but they cannot believe
[32:25] that an alcohol demon can be destroyed
[32:28] in the life of a man and make him a real
[32:30] man they'll believe that but they won't
[32:33] be that God Amen can take a young person
[32:35] addicted to the perversion of the world
[32:37] and set him free and fill them with the
[32:40] Holy Ghost amen I tell you what I don't
[32:42] believe that picture but I believe the
[32:44] truth and the truth is amen who the son
[32:47] is made free is free indeed and there
[32:51] ain't no devil can stop it because it's
[32:53] not coming from a source of fiction it's
[32:56] coming from truth
[32:58] [Applause]
[32:59] are you hearing me amen I'm not
[33:01] preaching fiction I'm preaching truth
[33:04] you know what kind of truth I'm
[33:05] preaching Vindicated truth foreign
[33:10] I'm not preaching any kind of truth I'm
[33:13] preaching Vindicated truth then the
[33:17] world will accept fiction but they will
[33:20] reject Vindicated truth let me set you
[33:22] like this you all agree with me we're
[33:24] living in Italy we're living in an evil
[33:27] world
[33:29] we're living in an evil world where the
[33:33] world is full of fiction now let me set
[33:37] you like this but we
[33:40] are Sanctified by the god of
[33:43] righteousness so we're in this evil
[33:45] world but we're actually Sanctified by
[33:48] the god of righteousness see now I'll
[33:50] tell you what that is that's a paradox
[33:52] are you hearing me that's like being in
[33:54] the fire and coming out and not even
[33:57] smelling like smoke
[33:58] are you with me that's like going into a
[34:01] into a into a a a a a a smoke infested
[34:05] building and coming out and you smell
[34:07] like you just walked out of the mall or
[34:10] something you know what I'm saying
[34:11] you're in it but there's actually
[34:12] something keeping you from what's around
[34:14] you are you hearing me y'all know what
[34:17] I'm you you deer hunters know what I'm
[34:19] talking about and then you don't walk in
[34:21] the mall before you go to the tree stand
[34:22] hey because you walk in there and
[34:24] there's stuff in that atmosphere that
[34:27] will attach itself to you there'll be
[34:29] smells get on you are you hearing me
[34:31] amen so you gotta you gotta be preserved
[34:34] oh Church of the Living God Amen you are
[34:37] walking through the most deceptive most
[34:39] fictional most evil age it's ever been
[34:42] but here you are tonight in the house of
[34:45] God they've been believing in the power
[34:48] of the Holy Ghost what is that amen it's
[34:51] the prayer of Jesus over your life you
[34:54] know what Jesus said he said I pray
[34:56] father that thou shouldest take them out
[34:58] of world Amen but thou says keep them
[35:01] from the evil amen so they're going to
[35:04] be in the world but they're going to be
[35:06] kept from the evil that's in the world
[35:08] they are not of the world as I am not of
[35:11] the world he said so sanctify them
[35:14] through thy truth and thy word is the
[35:18] truth in your sanctifying power your
[35:21] cleansing power is the word now I just
[35:24] want to read this to you from the church
[35:25] age book remember I said here is most
[35:27] heavily set forth that the perfect
[35:29] manifestation of God in the sun was by
[35:33] the indwelled manifesting in word and
[35:36] work somebody say word
[35:38] worked word
[35:41] worked now I've been on the field long
[35:44] enough to meet people and brother Thomas
[35:46] y'all tell me we're on Word Church we're
[35:48] a word church and they actually Pride
[35:51] themselves in being a word church hey we
[35:53] ain't got none of them worked we ain't
[35:54] got none of that emotion of that
[35:56] shouting we're just a word church and
[35:58] then I've met other churches and they
[36:00] ain't in a word they're just works you
[36:02] know everything's works but here's the
[36:03] beautiful thing about it there is no
[36:05] such a thing there is no such a thing as
[36:07] a word church and then a Works Church
[36:09] well let's go be a word church amen the
[36:12] prophet of God said amen that the word
[36:14] and the words work together he said when
[36:17] the bride will get back to being a word
[36:19] bride she will produce the very Works
[36:22] amen that Jesus produced the word is God
[36:26] the spirit is God they are all one so
[36:29] one cannot work apart from the other if
[36:33] one truly has the spirit of God he will
[36:36] have the word of God that is how it was
[36:38] with the prophets because they have the
[36:40] indwelling spirit of God God and the
[36:43] word came to them so the word comes to
[36:46] the spirit he said see in Jesus in him
[36:49] was the spirit without measure and the
[36:52] word came to him he said now remember
[36:54] John the Baptist was both prophet and
[36:57] messenger of his name he was filled with
[36:59] the holy ghost from this mother's womb
[37:01] when he was baptized in the Jordan the
[37:03] word of God Jesus came to him because
[37:06] the word always comes to the truly
[37:09] Spirit field then you cannot be a word
[37:11] church and not have the spirit and you
[37:14] cannot be a spirit church and not have
[37:16] the word amen because the word comes to
[37:19] the spirit and the spirit comes to the
[37:21] word amen because they are the self same
[37:24] person I say oh thank you Lord we're not
[37:27] about your formals and one and a
[37:30] bunch of Fanatics in the other amen but
[37:32] God who is rich in Mercy has sent an
[37:35] adoption message to bring us out of the
[37:37] confusion of armenianism and the
[37:39] confusion of Calvinism and to places in
[37:42] the middle of the road in the book of
[37:44] Ephesians amen positionally placed
[37:49] amen we're not here trying to make
[37:51] something happen we're not here trying
[37:53] to work something up amen the word and
[37:56] accompanies the works and the spirit
[37:59] comes to the word
[38:01] now y'all know I'm telling you the truth
[38:04] amen the word and the spirit are the
[38:06] same he said that's what Jesus said
[38:08] would be the evidence the Holy Ghost
[38:10] which you would be in the word of your
[38:12] age
[38:13] right now did you notice that Jesus said
[38:16] oh watch this the world cannot receive
[38:19] the Holy Ghost you're in that world you
[38:22] are in the world that cannot receive the
[38:24] Holy Ghost but yet Mr Hannah you got the
[38:26] Holy Ghost amen amen you got the Holy
[38:29] Ghost young people amen but you're in a
[38:31] world that cannot receive it do you know
[38:33] why you got it because Jesus prayed for
[38:35] you and he prayed that the father amen
[38:38] would sanctify you by the word and in
[38:40] you as a creative ground that when the
[38:43] people you grew up with and the people
[38:45] who you go to school with amen were born
[38:48] to reject it there was a creative crown
[38:50] on the inside of your soul that was
[38:53] ordered to receive it listen if you got
[38:55] the Holy Ghost you'll ought to be the
[38:57] most happiest person in this building
[38:59] tonight that you're in a world that
[39:01] cannot receive it amen by the grace of
[39:04] God has predestinated your womb to
[39:07] receive the Holy Ghost
[39:10] and because they can't receive the Holy
[39:13] Ghost they cannot receive the word
[39:16] but watch this amen here again we find
[39:19] the word coming because of the spirit of
[39:21] God now amen I like to I like to study
[39:24] the prophet of God
[39:26] and in John 16 13 he gives you some
[39:29] beautiful commentary on the on one verse
[39:31] he says now how be it with he the spirit
[39:34] of truth I'm going to stop she says the
[39:36] word is come he will guide you into all
[39:39] true he stops again and since Thy word
[39:41] is truth
[39:43] he shall not speak of himself but
[39:46] whatsoever he shall hear he stops again
[39:48] and says word of God that shall he speak
[39:51] and he stops and says word and he will
[39:53] show you the things that he is to come
[39:56] now watch this he said see the spirit
[39:59] bringing the word of Prophecy amen now
[40:02] come on Church you're in a world that
[40:05] cannot receive the Holy Ghost you're in
[40:07] a world that cannot receive the word but
[40:09] here you are tonight and you're
[40:11] receiving what the world you're living
[40:13] in cannot receive why it is it because
[40:16] the prophet said you are a prophetic
[40:19] class of people so the spirit bringing
[40:22] the word it was not a dead letter amen
[40:24] it was not an intellectual letter it was
[40:27] a prophetic word that would fall into
[40:29] your soul and here would be the evidence
[40:32] that you would be in the truth you would
[40:34] be in the word of God for your age he
[40:38] would be in the word of God for your age
[40:41] evidence has to do with receiving the
[40:43] word here it is the evidence of a
[40:46] Spirit-filled Christian believer is not
[40:49] to produce the truth which is the word
[40:51] amen but to receive the truth the word
[40:54] and to believe it and to obey it the
[40:57] evidence of a Believer is not to work
[41:00] something up now Amy can I just take a
[41:02] little liberty here amen I believe if
[41:03] you preach the message the church will
[41:05] shout
[41:07] somebody said what side are you on I
[41:10] said what do you mean they said are you
[41:11] on emotional versus are you on emotional
[41:14] versus intellectual or intellectual
[41:16] versus emotional I said well brother you
[41:18] got the wrong guy here he said what do
[41:20] you mean I said but I've never taught
[41:22] that he only taught two verses
[41:24] Christianity versus idolatry and wisdom
[41:27] birth
[41:29] Liberty and preach whoever made it a
[41:32] fight over shouted in the house of God
[41:34] didn't get it from brother Brandon
[41:37] now you all telling the church amen we
[41:40] live in a day and time amen where guys
[41:42] will spend hours trying to find quotes
[41:44] to justify shouting and other guys will
[41:47] spend hours find the quotes Amen to
[41:49] justify while we shouldn't be shouting
[41:51] and you can find quotes on both sides
[41:53] but can I just ask you this whatever
[41:55] happened to just preaching the message
[41:57] I mean whatever happened to just tell
[42:00] him what a prophet said and just
[42:02] preaching it well we got to get them
[42:03] worked up well if you work them up
[42:05] somebody else will work him down amen
[42:07] but if you'll preach the message and let
[42:09] an atmosphere come in the building and
[42:11] the believer will recognize her position
[42:13] in an evil age that they're Sanctified
[42:16] by the god of Truth Listen that'll make
[42:18] me want to shout more than a hot guitar
[42:20] it'll make me want to shout more than a
[42:22] set of drums is to know I'm living in a
[42:25] world that is rejected truth but God who
[42:28] is rich in Mercy has allowed me to
[42:30] receive amen the evidence of his word
[42:33] and the age I'm living I said and when
[42:34] you receive that you'll outrun the
[42:36] horses of Elijah when you receive that
[42:39] you'll get your hearts off the willow
[42:41] trees to know that you have been the
[42:44] elected chosen Lady of almighty God
[42:48] brother
[42:49] and I guess I think we got that day
[42:51] without a building
[42:54] preach the message
[42:56] now you say Belinda you're getting sorry
[42:58] out there am I really were in a battle
[43:01] and it's a battle for truth probably God
[43:03] said in the my sins has it been lost but
[43:06] God said they would be restored again in
[43:08] the last day now watch this we're
[43:10] looking for that property of Malachi
[43:12] Thor but we're not looking tonight we've
[43:14] seen him he said now we're looking for
[43:16] his manifestation and we'll see the
[43:19] Vindicated word of God now listen this
[43:21] there will be just a few understand it
[43:25] there will be just a few understand it
[43:29] as it was in the days of MOA so will it
[43:31] be in the coming of the son of man in
[43:33] the days of locks three were saved amen
[43:35] so shall it be in the Communists and a
[43:38] man there will be very few saved amen
[43:41] translated in that time because one of
[43:43] the Mysteries of the church being taken
[43:46] up amen so in this age brother Joe
[43:48] there's only going to be a few that's
[43:50] going to be able to receive amen the
[43:53] understanding of the word of God now
[43:55] listen friends somebody asked me one
[43:56] time they said why do y'all preach at
[43:58] Malachi 4 why do you all preach at that
[44:00] word has got to be restored Joel too
[44:02] amen because the bride will take the
[44:05] Rapture by the word she does not take
[44:08] the Rapture by feelings she does not
[44:10] take the Rapture by emotions come on
[44:12] church she does not take to Rapture by
[44:15] the way she feels she takes the raps
[44:18] sure by the word that's why the prophet
[44:21] of God said you're a word bride in a
[44:23] word age under a word anointing because
[44:25] the only thing that can Rapture the
[44:27] bride is the word oh my I feel like
[44:30] preaching on that point for a second you
[44:32] all realize on the morning of the
[44:33] Rapture you may wake up and feel lower
[44:35] than a snake's belly you may wake up
[44:38] feel like everybody hates you nobody
[44:40] loves you amen you're the most unworthy
[44:42] person amen if anybody should be lost it
[44:45] ought to be you you're the chief of
[44:46] Sinners you're the lowest thing that God
[44:49] ever made and then why you're standing
[44:51] in the mirror they've been combing your
[44:53] hair you'll see your loved one appear
[44:55] behind you do you realize they did not
[44:57] appear because of how you felt they did
[45:00] not appear because of how good you
[45:02] thought you were they appeared because
[45:04] God sent a prophet to restore the word
[45:07] of translation to the Church of the
[45:10] Living God and to put her in positions
[45:12] for Rapture listen friends we're going
[45:14] home we're not going to stay here we're
[45:17] going home one of these mornings our
[45:19] bodies are going to be changed and
[45:22] they're not going to be changed by the
[45:23] way we feel they're not going to be
[45:25] changed by how high or how low we are
[45:27] they're going to be changed because the
[45:29] word has put them under obligation to be
[45:32] changed oh man somebody shot a change
[45:37] see it's coming from the that's why
[45:40] you're a paradox you're in an age an
[45:42] intellectual age but you still believe
[45:45] that God keeps his word
[45:47] in this intellectual age you still
[45:50] believe this the same yesterday today
[45:52] and forever you still believe me can
[45:55] discern the thoughts of the human heart
[45:57] you still believe he can change a man
[45:59] you still believe he can keep every word
[46:01] that he promised in this day I'm on
[46:03] church and you still believe that the
[46:06] same angel of God
[46:08] the same angel of God that was here is
[46:12] doing the very same thing it did when he
[46:15] was here on Earth Amen manifested in
[46:18] human flesh oh my y'all see this picture
[46:20] here some people get tore up about that
[46:22] picture and the problem is all they see
[46:24] is a man but I see God
[46:28] now y'all forgive me I actually see God
[46:31] I see a prophet but I see God I see the
[46:34] logos I see the creator of the heavens
[46:37] and the earth I see God above his head
[46:40] and what is in that Pillar of Fire was
[46:43] what got into Moses is what God in Nepal
[46:46] I'm old church that's the same thing
[46:48] that got into Jesus are you hearing me
[46:51] that's the same anointing that's the
[46:53] same Angel amen that choker the same
[46:56] angel that met Moses and brought the
[46:58] children of Israel the law it's the same
[47:01] angel that met Paul and brought him from
[47:03] the dispensation of law into Grace is
[47:06] the same angel that met a man named
[47:08] William Branham on the Ohio River and
[47:11] commissioned him to preach a message
[47:12] that would put the bride in a Rapture in
[47:15] order
[47:17] do you know what God is wanting he's
[47:20] wanting somebody to believe that's him
[47:22] he's wanting somebody to believe it's
[47:25] not just a man it's not just a
[47:27] Kentuckian it's not just a preacher
[47:30] that's the logos of God he's looking for
[47:33] somebody he meant to believe that's the
[47:35] Creator he's looking for somebody to
[47:37] believe that hello him he's looking for
[47:40] somebody to believe that's Jehovah-jireh
[47:42] he's looking for somebody to believe
[47:45] that he is
[47:46] yeah
[47:48] and he's still with his church tonight
[47:51] yes sir he said I believe God is one of
[47:53] the people Amen to believe in Paradox
[47:56] amen I believe it should be a paradox
[47:58] right here I believe that God is willing
[48:00] to take and he's wanting to take his
[48:01] people and show himself if he can only
[48:04] get a man or woman boy or girl to lay
[48:06] down their own talks you got to lay down
[48:10] your own thoughts and you got to become
[48:12] a prisoner to him and believe him listen
[48:16] if you're going to see a paradox you've
[48:19] got to become a prisoner to the god that
[48:21] performs Paradox he is his word
[48:25] can I say it to you like this in the
[48:27] beginning was the word
[48:30] and the Word was with God and the Word
[48:32] was God and the Word was made freshly
[48:35] wealth Among Us can I go ahead and bring
[48:36] it on home brother Thomas and the
[48:38] prophet said and now he is in you
[48:41] [Applause]
[48:43] brother well Glory now he is in you he
[48:50] just brought him from the creation to
[48:52] the age you're living in and said he's
[48:55] in you the hope of glory and he's the
[48:58] same yesterday today and forever and he
[49:01] automatically connects his presence and
[49:03] you to John the 14th chapter and says he
[49:07] that believeth on me amen The Works that
[49:10] I do shall he do also are you hearing me
[49:13] see now watch this he's a preacher
[49:15] that's beautiful but that's in the
[49:17] future I say that's now
[49:20] brother I say now he is in you
[49:25] well someday brother we'll get over in
[49:27] the Millennium and he'll get in us no
[49:29] what about right now you say preacher
[49:32] you ain't got no scripture for that oh
[49:33] but I do it's First John 3 beloved now
[49:37] are we the sons of God and it does not
[49:40] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[49:42] that when heat shall appear we shall be
[49:45] like him for we shall see him as he is
[49:48] don't you see who you are you are the
[49:51] mighty goat
[49:53] you are the Bride of Jesus Christ The
[49:56] Mighty God has been unveiled on the
[49:59] inside of you and now all that God was
[50:02] he poured into Christ and all that
[50:05] Christ was he is poured into the church
[50:07] listen trans I say that's now amen don't
[50:11] you let some Catholicism death or come
[50:13] in the ranks of this message and put
[50:15] this in the future it's right now
[50:18] and don't you let some Church of Christ
[50:21] therefore come in this message and put
[50:23] in the past it's right now right now we
[50:26] are redeemed oh God hallelujah right now
[50:30] we are healed right now we are saved
[50:32] right now we are the certain Daughters
[50:34] of God listen I know the devil's put
[50:36] this off in the future and the church is
[50:38] sitting there twidding their thumbs and
[50:40] talking about a day going by and looking
[50:42] for a day to come but why don't you
[50:44] tonight in the name of the Lord rise up
[50:46] and realize this is your hour this is
[50:49] your message this is your anointing this
[50:52] is your age this is your season this is
[50:55] your time this is your Paradox this is
[50:57] your hour to believe God and she
[50:59] surround across the Red Sea this is your
[51:02] hour he meant to see the Miracles this
[51:04] is your hour to see the power of God
[51:06] calling the church again
[51:09] it's not in the future it's right here
[51:12] now
[51:13] it's not in the future it's right here
[51:16] now now we are the sons of God oh now
[51:21] this very hour right now
[51:23] not we will be
[51:25] this very hour
[51:29] brother what are you saying preacher I'm
[51:32] saying we are in the god of paradox
[51:37] we are in the god of paradox but the god
[51:43] of paradox is in US
[51:45] [Applause]
[51:48] we are in him but he is in US
[51:53] can I prove it to you about the Bible is
[51:55] it any man be in Christ
[51:58] he's a new creature old things are
[52:01] passed away and behold all things are
[52:03] become new can I prove it to you to whom
[52:06] God would make known what is the richest
[52:08] of the glory of this mystery among the
[52:10] Gentiles which is Christ in you
[52:15] the hope of glory so if if you are in
[52:18] him you're a new creature and if he is
[52:22] in you you're on your way to Glory
[52:25] brother let me have a little dancing
[52:27] room right there if he is in you then
[52:31] all things are passed away old habits
[52:34] are gone but setting sins are defeated
[52:36] and he has made you a new creature in
[52:40] Christ Jesus and in fact God is in you
[52:42] and he has transformed you
[52:46] ever born again member of the body of
[52:48] Christ is a paradox in themself he said
[52:51] I believe each one of you Methodist
[52:53] Presbyterian Lutheran that never had the
[52:55] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[52:57] Spirit was in some formal church that
[52:59] did not believe in the genuine New Birth
[53:00] and has now received the baptism of the
[53:03] Holy Ghost is a perfect example of a
[53:07] paradox because something happened to
[53:10] you that changed your whole being and
[53:12] anyone can look
[53:14] it's you and know what a paradox is a
[53:18] miracle
[53:20] some of y'all got ready tonight and you
[53:22] said Lord I want to see a miracle and he
[53:24] was looking at one in the mirror
[53:29] by the Thomas they want to see a miracle
[53:32] and they they feel the Lick in the
[53:34] mirror they are a miracle y'all know I'm
[53:37] telling the truth amen everything the
[53:39] devil tried it didn't work because
[53:40] you're still here
[53:42] [Music]
[53:45] but you're still here and you're still
[53:48] believing and you're still preaching
[53:50] that man it must be amen it's not the
[53:52] strength of the Ballers it's not the
[53:54] strength of your father it's the streets
[53:56] of Jehovah that got on the inside of you
[53:58] that has claimed you
[54:01] well devil get out of here there is a
[54:04] paradox in the building tonight because
[54:06] you were born again and when you're born
[54:08] again you believe in miracles because
[54:10] you're a part of God see what is it it's
[54:13] Jesus on the inside
[54:15] and he's working on the outside oh what
[54:18] a change in my life see what's happening
[54:22] is is God is interpreting his own word
[54:25] in your life through your flesh
[54:29] I can read it to you the father God said
[54:32] he is the word with his true
[54:33] interpretation now you say oh leave me
[54:35] the Bible sir we believe the Bible but
[54:37] now if you believe the Bible Jesus said
[54:39] in the Bible Saint John 14 12 he that
[54:42] believeth on me the works that I do
[54:44] shall he do also that's the true
[54:47] interpretation of the Bible for God
[54:49] himself is in you speaking back his own
[54:53] interpretation Glory he said God in you
[54:57] interpreting his own word didn't Jesus
[54:59] say these signs shall follow them that
[55:01] believe it's God in you giving his own
[55:04] interpretation you don't have to look to
[55:07] somebody else all you got to say Amen is
[55:10] believe it and it will interpret itself
[55:13] because it's God using you to interpret
[55:17] his own word are you ready for this
[55:19] Christ is the living interpretation of
[55:24] his own word that I can stand before you
[55:26] tonight and declare without hesitate
[55:28] nation that we are not following
[55:31] cunningly devastables amen which we made
[55:33] known unto you amen the power and coming
[55:36] of our Lord Jesus but we were
[55:38] eyewitnesses of his majesty come on
[55:41] Church we're not just on Lookers we're
[55:44] eyewitnesses of the Majesty of the only
[55:47] true and living God
[55:50] are you hearing me are you hearing me
[55:52] now you know what the Bible says at the
[55:54] memo okay on time
[55:55] the Bible says that we've not followed
[55:58] kindly devised fables do you know what
[56:00] that word kindly means it means to play
[56:03] the part of a sophist it means to play
[56:05] the part of a sofas so actually when you
[56:08] look at pay the sofas you know what that
[56:10] is related to that is related to
[56:12] skepticism so we're not following amen
[56:15] skeptic fables we're not we're not
[56:18] Skeptics here tonight listen to a
[56:20] prophet can I can I preach to you he
[56:22] said may we see tonight the living
[56:24] Christ who is not dead raised again for
[56:26] our justification now live among us in
[56:29] the person of the Holy Ghost may he come
[56:31] tonight and speak to every heart visible
[56:34] and invisible audience and may he
[56:37] perform in their hearts that work of the
[56:40] new birth and bring them to the
[56:42] Redemption power of his resurrection and
[56:45] take away all Shadows of doubt and
[56:47] unbelief and destroy all skepticism come
[56:51] on church that's what his presence is
[56:53] here to do his presence is here to
[56:55] destroy boy I'll skepticism that the
[56:58] church might move on in perfect harmony
[57:01] with the will of God as presented by the
[57:04] Bible and the Holy Spirit Well I might
[57:07] as well preach I'm here don't you think
[57:09] it's time to grow up and quit being
[57:11] babies don't you think it's time to quit
[57:13] fussing him
[57:14] fighting like a bunch of babies on the
[57:16] playground amen that's the devil of
[57:18] skepticism
[57:20] and you want to see Miracles amen I pray
[57:23] to God you'll see one tonight I pray the
[57:26] same Holy Fire that fell on the altar or
[57:28] tall in your heart and Destroy everyone
[57:31] else's skepticism
[57:33] I know where I'm standing amen some of
[57:35] y'all ain't skeptical this message
[57:37] you're not skeptical of the Prophet
[57:39] you're skeptical of your own self amen
[57:41] well I've done this and I've done that
[57:42] and I can't do this but I'm gonna tell
[57:44] you what the prophet said he said my
[57:46] Ministry is different from the pastor my
[57:49] Ministry is different from the
[57:50] Evangelist he said my Ministry is to
[57:52] declare him he is here
[57:56] my Ministry is to declare him he is here
[57:59] now can I can I read it to you he said
[58:02] now I know this sounds rational but if
[58:04] you'll just bear with me I believe that
[58:07] I by God's help with his word and
[58:10] according to his word I can bring him
[58:12] right here before you
[58:16] brother I believe that God's help of his
[58:20] word and according to his word I can
[58:23] bring God right here before you you say
[58:26] Petro I want you back off of that
[58:28] message because that's the only Avenue
[58:30] being the god of Eternity into this
[58:33] building is by his word according to his
[58:36] word and by the help of his Spirit
[58:38] listen friends

[58:48] well preach amen I know what I'm talking
[58:50] about amen it used to be people come to

[59:31] foreign
[59:34] but I'm here when you realize that it's
[59:37] not a preacher here if he's preaching
[59:39] this message it's not a man just filling
[59:42] a poop head rehearsing to you some
[59:43] scriptures and some quotes and he's
[59:45] labored over it's a servant of God who's
[59:48] underneath the same Pillar of Fire and
[59:51] by God's help and his word he's bringing
[59:55] the church into the church oh God that's
[59:58] why brother Thomas said when you come to

[1:01:05] act like you got some sense
[1:01:07] I said praise God there's still a few
[1:01:09] left in the world
[1:01:15] still a few left well Barbara was
[1:01:18] cutting my hair and you know what he
[1:01:19] said he said man I love Grandma I was
[1:01:21] like
[1:01:23] a few minutes later that boy he is
[1:01:25] sitting over and here's what he's doing
[1:01:26] he's going
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:34] grandma got up
[1:01:36] she went over there she stood over him
[1:01:37] she said
[1:01:39] you drive that up before I give you
[1:01:40] something to cry about
[1:01:42] [Applause]
[1:01:45] he just kept on sitting there sniffling
[1:01:47] brother and carrying on and I love what
[1:01:49] she said she said draw all that nonsense
[1:01:51] up said you ain't hurt your feelings are
[1:01:55] oh he wasn't hurt his feelings work and
[1:01:58] y'all know that's what happens a lot of
[1:02:00] times is you think the preacher hurts
[1:02:02] you he didn't hurt you he hurt your
[1:02:04] feelings
[1:02:06] but I got a quote for that the prophet
[1:02:08] of God said it's time to separate your
[1:02:11] feelings from your faith and if you're a
[1:02:13] real believer you will not let your
[1:02:16] feelings amen stop you from getting a
[1:02:18] blessing from God
[1:02:20] if the preacher steps all over your toes
[1:02:22] you'll come back on the morning service
[1:02:24] and say preacher step on him again
[1:02:27] because I want to be a paradox
[1:02:34] bypass the Judgment I want to be a
[1:02:37] miracle
[1:02:41] it's a it's a Ministry of God bringing
[1:02:44] the presence of God in the building to
[1:02:46] show you who your maid is now what he's
[1:02:49] doing is he's keeping you in line are
[1:02:52] you with me he's keeping you alive
[1:02:54] because the prophet said he said the
[1:02:56] dove is always loyal to his mate
[1:03:00] whoa he said it may I stop here just a
[1:03:03] moment and say the true Bride is a
[1:03:05] female dove she is loyal to her man it
[1:03:08] won't inject it at all my any
[1:03:10] nominational doctrines anything in the
[1:03:12] world it'll stay loyal to its make to
[1:03:15] work
[1:03:16] it's amazing the meat
[1:03:18] the word
[1:03:20] your mate is the word
[1:03:23] that's what you must stay loyal to now
[1:03:26] you don't know that the Bible is the
[1:03:28] word right and if we took time we could
[1:03:31] show you that the Bible from Genesis to
[1:03:33] Revelation is full of paradoxes right
[1:03:35] full of paradoxes we could show you what
[1:03:38] the prophet God said about Noah he said
[1:03:40] no about faith said there would be rain
[1:03:42] and God said there would be rain God
[1:03:44] said so the saith the Lord he said is
[1:03:46] what Noah moved upon he said instead the
[1:03:49] order God said so amen it never meets
[1:03:52] the scientific approval of the day
[1:03:54] another place okay so when that time
[1:03:56] comes the word to be fulfilled it Reigns
[1:03:57] just the same now watch this we can
[1:04:00] speak of the three Hebrew children can
[1:04:01] have a few more minutes is that okay we
[1:04:04] can speak of the three Hebrew children
[1:04:05] who was a paradox of the keeping power
[1:04:07] of God we could speak of Daniel who was
[1:04:10] a paradox they went in a den full of
[1:04:11] hungry lines and how that could could be
[1:04:14] that man on a group of hungry lines stay
[1:04:16] there in the cave all night without any
[1:04:17] harm we could speak of Samson who is
[1:04:20] just an ordinary man young boy curly
[1:04:22] headed shrimp boy they've been
[1:04:24] part of God said he walked up there one
[1:04:25] day picked up a Jawbone that was dry I
[1:04:28] saw a thousand for listings right we
[1:04:30] could speak of we could speak of Joshua
[1:04:32] stop in the sand now probably God said
[1:04:34] he stopped the son not the Earth
[1:04:36] remember
[1:04:37] he said now watch he said the Bible
[1:04:39] teacher said no it was the earth he said
[1:04:41] no it was the son he said what did he do
[1:04:43] he stopped the sign he defied nature
[1:04:48] when he stopped the sun are you with me
[1:04:51] I'm turning the corner now he defied
[1:04:54] nature
[1:04:56] now the prophet of God said that is
[1:04:58] today the same God
[1:05:01] if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:05:03] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:05:04] that what you said will come to pass you
[1:05:06] can have what you said that's defy
[1:05:08] nature but you have to have a motive and
[1:05:10] objective to that that's connected with
[1:05:13] it see find out in the word of God if
[1:05:15] it's supposed to be done and then if God
[1:05:18] is calling you to do it it'll do it and
[1:05:21] you know that it's spoken in the word to
[1:05:23] do it then God has called you to do it
[1:05:25] then it'll happen if your motive and
[1:05:28] your objective is right he said now
[1:05:30] watch that's why the Visions take place
[1:05:32] so can I set you like this Jesus when he
[1:05:35] was on Earth he was a paradox
[1:05:39] can I read this to you remember Jesus
[1:05:42] when he was on Earth he walked on the
[1:05:44] water now explain that to me
[1:05:45] scientifically tell me how a man can
[1:05:47] walk on water it was a paradox are you
[1:05:50] ready for this one one day he took five
[1:05:53] biscuits and two fish and fed five
[1:05:55] thousand now I know we say five thousand
[1:05:57] but if it's okay let's make it a little
[1:05:59] bit bigger
[1:06:01] Bible says he fed five thousand men and
[1:06:04] their wives
[1:06:06] so if they had wives That's ten thousand
[1:06:09] and then we'll say they had kids and
[1:06:11] they had five apiece now we've gone from
[1:06:13] five thousand to fifty thousand
[1:06:16] uh y'all know I'm just just showing you
[1:06:18] how big our God is
[1:06:20] amen amen let's make it as big as we can
[1:06:23] to show you who he is now watch this now
[1:06:26] brother remember said when he said those
[1:06:27] he said what kind of Adam did he turn
[1:06:30] loose
[1:06:33] what kind of Adam did he turn loose he
[1:06:36] said now that wasn't now that fish
[1:06:38] wasn't even alive now listen church when
[1:06:41] he broke that bread he broke it off a
[1:06:43] piece of a biscuit and when he handed it
[1:06:46] out and he got his hand back there was
[1:06:48] another biscuit there I already raised
[1:06:51] the wheat in the field already cooked
[1:06:53] all the great Senate see seasoned here
[1:06:55] was a piece of fish
[1:06:58] he
[1:06:59] he broke it off and another piece of cut
[1:07:01] fish Hallelujah are you ready for this
[1:07:03] this is where I want to close he said
[1:07:05] that element is given to us
[1:07:07] [Applause]
[1:07:11] that element amen if you can give me a
[1:07:13] bit more in this year I'm gonna try to
[1:07:15] appreciate it that element is given to
[1:07:17] us it will just abide in the word if we
[1:07:21] can just abide in the word think about
[1:07:23] it if we can just abide in the word and
[1:07:26] stay there he said I believe we're on
[1:07:28] the verge of sin that happened in his
[1:07:30] hand he lived true to the word there you
[1:07:33] are he had cooked fish and there was a
[1:07:36] paradox amen can I set you back this
[1:07:38] tonight Church whatever element was in
[1:07:40] his hand is promised to be in his church
[1:07:44] come on now are you hearing they lined
[1:07:47] up and Jesus took that hand and he
[1:07:51] handed out a piece of fish and bread and
[1:07:53] by the time he got his hand back there
[1:07:55] was already another fish
[1:07:58] there was already another piece of bread
[1:08:00] and he handed that now you all know I'm
[1:08:03] telling the truth amen somebody was the
[1:08:05] first in line and somebody was the last
[1:08:08] in line but can I tell you the beautiful
[1:08:10] thing about it is the person last in
[1:08:12] line got the same thing
[1:08:17] yeah the person lasting line got the
[1:08:21] same thing the person first did on God
[1:08:23] because what happened the human element
[1:08:26] went out he said what was it it was
[1:08:28] deity being revealed in human beings
[1:08:31] listen friends amen if you lay aside the
[1:08:34] human element you lay aside the human
[1:08:36] mind get all the human elements out you
[1:08:39] will see the supernatural element come
[1:08:41] in the church and the prophets that
[1:08:43] human element goes out Supernatural
[1:08:45] element comes in can I say this to you
[1:08:47] and miracles only happen by the super
[1:08:51] sign and by The Sixth Sense which is the
[1:08:54] super sense can I have a few more
[1:08:56] minutes he said therefore the Lord
[1:08:58] himself shall give you what a sign
[1:09:00] Behold a virgin shall conceive and Mark
[1:09:03] 11 22 Jesus answering saith unto them
[1:09:06] have faith in God the blood membership
[1:09:09] is very beautiful he says we are
[1:09:11] grateful to God that we have the five
[1:09:13] senses but by no means were those five
[1:09:15] sixes given to you to guide you they
[1:09:18] were given to you for your Earthly
[1:09:19] contact he said about the Sixth Sense
[1:09:22] belongs only to the Christian
[1:09:25] how many Christians do we have here
[1:09:28] tonight amen then the Sixth Sense
[1:09:30] belongs to you and you cannot have the
[1:09:32] Sixth Sense until you become a Christian
[1:09:34] he said the Sixth Sense is better known
[1:09:37] to the Christian as Faith are you ready
[1:09:39] for this it's the one that governs and
[1:09:42] guides you and it's Superior to all
[1:09:46] other senses well glory to God anyhow
[1:09:50] amen The Sixth Sense which is the super
[1:09:53] sense is the sense that God sent to
[1:09:55] guide you and to govern you and that
[1:09:59] sense is superior to all other senses
[1:10:01] I'm laying some word in here now super
[1:10:04] sense he is the holy spirit he said it's
[1:10:07] the faith of God that dwells in you and
[1:10:10] if you're left of five senses be yielded
[1:10:12] to the sixth sense it will guide you and
[1:10:15] will bring all the other five senses
[1:10:17] under the control of that super sense
[1:10:20] are you ready for this that Sixth Sense
[1:10:23] will make you act where you do not think
[1:10:26] the five senses would ever think about
[1:10:28] well glory to God Amen I'm gonna bring
[1:10:31] this home and this is the one the devil
[1:10:34] hates and the devil can get into these
[1:10:37] five senses and he can lie to you but he
[1:10:40] cannot
[1:10:43] the devil can get in your eyes and he
[1:10:45] can lie to you he can get in your
[1:10:47] hearing he can get in your Smail he can
[1:10:50] get in your taste come on church he can
[1:10:52] get in your field he can get in your
[1:10:54] memory your reason your affection your
[1:10:56] conscience your magic he can get in all
[1:10:57] those and lie to you but he cannot touch
[1:11:00] the super sense that's far beyond his
[1:11:03] reach because
[1:11:05] that comes from God it's called faith
[1:11:08] and the six it come for this reason only
[1:11:10] that was to make five stitches in you
[1:11:13] did not anything that's contrary to the
[1:11:16] word of God what are you saying preacher
[1:11:18] I'm saying how many wants to see a
[1:11:20] miracle
[1:11:21] can I ask you this how many needs a
[1:11:25] miracle can I tell you this to see a
[1:11:27] miracle you got to cast down imagination
[1:11:30] and every High thing that exalted itself
[1:11:33] against the knowledge of God and bring
[1:11:35] into captivity every thought to The
[1:11:38] Obedience of Christ what is the super
[1:11:40] sign brother amen he says the super sign
[1:11:43] is God in man
[1:11:47] ifesting his written word now what are
[1:11:50] you saying preacher I'm saying God has
[1:11:52] been above us God has been with us now
[1:11:55] he's got in US
[1:11:58] and Greater Works than this shall he do
[1:12:00] because I go to my father how many knows
[1:12:03] this quote Christ in the true church is
[1:12:06] a continuation of the book of Acts are
[1:12:09] you ready for this I'm going to skip to
[1:12:11] the bottom of that quote he says and he
[1:12:13] knows that if the people if the people
[1:12:15] get the true revelation of the true
[1:12:19] church and what she is not what she will
[1:12:22] be and not what she was but what she is
[1:12:25] and what she stands for and she can do
[1:12:28] the Greater Works she will be an
[1:12:31] invincible Army
[1:12:32] if she can get the Revelation she will
[1:12:36] be an invincible Army who is that she
[1:12:38] that she is the bride that she is the
[1:12:42] bride are you she
[1:12:44] [Applause]
[1:12:45] brother Richmond are you she are you she
[1:12:50] come on church are you she well then if
[1:12:53] you're she and I tell you what a prophet
[1:12:55] done a prophet referred to the Bride As
[1:12:58] She you know what he referred to her as
[1:13:00] as little bride I'm going somewhere he'd
[1:13:03] referred to her and say LeBron he said
[1:13:05] now don't you worry you little bride
[1:13:07] another place in the midst of Darkness
[1:13:09] who is going to bring the little bride
[1:13:10] out in another place he is pulling his
[1:13:13] little brown out in the Masterpiece he
[1:13:16] is going to bring this little brother
[1:13:17] smitten right back to the original side
[1:13:20] of the original word another place thank
[1:13:23] God the little bride has made herself
[1:13:25] ready recognizing your day 64 but when
[1:13:28] that little Bride come into you it was
[1:13:30] different she was the Alpha and the
[1:13:32] Omega
[1:13:34] oh God help me Lord can I give you
[1:13:37] another one lots of bridegroom taking
[1:13:40] the bride to her surprise how the little
[1:13:42] bride stands and all as she looks at her
[1:13:45] future home are you ready for this one
[1:13:47] now the humble little bride of Christ
[1:13:49] just simply believes the word whoever
[1:13:52] she is it's individuals I know what
[1:13:55] you're asking right now you're saying
[1:13:57] preacher why did you take time to
[1:14:00] emphasize on this bride being little
[1:14:02] bride because my Bible says that
[1:14:04] Proverbs 15 16 that batter is little
[1:14:07] with the fear of the Lord than break
[1:14:10] treasure and trouble therewith you know
[1:14:12] that word littleness means it means
[1:14:14] fewness you know what Jesus said he said
[1:14:17] fear not little flock it's your father's
[1:14:20] Good Will to give you the kingdom what
[1:14:22] are you getting that preacher I close
[1:14:24] with this little is much
[1:14:28] yeah
[1:14:29] I'm guessing it's still working littlest
[1:14:32] much
[1:14:34] little as much
[1:14:36] God
[1:14:38] is in it
[1:14:42] he's been above us he's been with us but
[1:14:46] little Brian he is now in US
[1:14:49] and literally as much if God is in it
[1:14:53] Tom but he's saying preacher I'm saying
[1:14:57] she nears that headstone you know what
[1:14:58] she's going to be
[1:15:00] she's going to be fewer in number
[1:15:02] but she's going to be greater in power
[1:15:05] [Applause]
[1:15:07] look at that pyramid starts out real
[1:15:09] wide at the bottom what's the closer you
[1:15:11] get to that Capstone the fewer it gets
[1:15:14] the more narrow it gets you know why
[1:15:16] because it was it was more at the bottom
[1:15:19] but there was less power come on Church
[1:15:21] there was more at the bottom but there
[1:15:22] was less power but when she nears The
[1:15:25] Headstone the prophet of God said the
[1:15:27] true bride Christ seed she will be the
[1:15:29] Super Church a super race as she nears
[1:15:33] him what are you saying I'm seeing God
[1:15:34] God into two fish and Five Loaves and
[1:15:37] fed 50 000.
[1:15:40] God got in water and turned it into wine
[1:15:42] if God can get in that he can get in one
[1:15:45] believer
[1:15:48] and perform a paradox he said what was
[1:15:52] it it was a living God and a man that
[1:15:53] could lay itself out for God according
[1:15:56] to the word of God and the word of God
[1:15:58] will be made manifest to him what are
[1:16:00] you getting that preacher I'm saying
[1:16:02] it's ride time
[1:16:04] it's seed time
[1:16:06] it's harvest time I know I've gone a
[1:16:08] little bit long but give me just a
[1:16:09] grease right here he says I believe that
[1:16:12] Jesus Christ
[1:16:13] reincarnated in flesh in the human
[1:16:16] church here on Earth doing signs and
[1:16:20] wonders
[1:16:23] can I give you one more the ministry of
[1:16:25] Jesus Christ reincarnated in his church
[1:16:28] in this last day
[1:16:30] what is it it's bride time it's adoption
[1:16:32] time it's the time the Satan has
[1:16:36] challenged
[1:16:38] Satan is challenged
[1:16:40] but the prophet is challenged and I love
[1:16:43] to say these words to him stupid devil
[1:16:48] stupid devil you know the challenge he's
[1:16:50] made is if God is in your midst where's
[1:16:53] all the Miracles
[1:16:56] God's in your midst
[1:16:58] and where's all the Miracles
[1:17:00] God's in you if God's in this message
[1:17:02] then where's all the Miracles
[1:17:05] you know what I say
[1:17:07] look no further stupid devil
[1:17:11] [Applause]
[1:17:16] this is the bride's paradox
[1:17:19] are you hearing me it's an age when God
[1:17:21] has come on the scene I don't mind this
[1:17:23] I hope you don't mind a few testimony
[1:17:25] I believe God's in the midst of the
[1:17:27] church
[1:17:27] I believe if you'll preach this message
[1:17:29] the god of paradox will come in the
[1:17:31] building
[1:17:33] and he will perform
[1:17:34] by the promise of his word I was out at
[1:17:37] the other day at Pennsylvania brother
[1:17:38] Jim Shu makes preaching while I was
[1:17:40] preaching I just stand there reading
[1:17:41] some discernments and my mom was reading
[1:17:43] to him but Thomas you know how it is
[1:17:45] you're preaching through something real
[1:17:46] quick and he's trying to get to a point
[1:17:47] and I just I just hit my iPad and
[1:17:49] skipped over a quote and spirit Lord
[1:17:51] just struck me said go back read it I
[1:17:54] said yes Lord so I said y'all forgive me
[1:17:56] I gotta find this I I scroll through
[1:17:58] found it and it was a discernment the
[1:18:00] prophet God said you you've got sinus
[1:18:01] trouble he said Do you believe Jesus
[1:18:03] Christ is the high priest Can Be Touched
[1:18:05] by the feeling of your infirmities he
[1:18:06] said now if you believe that he said now
[1:18:08] who you're touching he said he said
[1:18:10] you're you're 30 feet from me he said
[1:18:12] you're touching the high priest and when
[1:18:14] I read that I said praise God he's right
[1:18:16] here in this building tonight and
[1:18:18] brother brother I just went on preaching
[1:18:19] my message brother John is where I don't
[1:18:21] put you know and I got over to brother
[1:18:22] Jim's house and his son Jimmy was
[1:18:24] sitting there and we're sitting around
[1:18:25] the table eating and all of a sudden
[1:18:27] Jimmy goes just like that
[1:18:29] those kind of sniffs a little bit he
[1:18:31] goes
[1:18:32] and he goes oh my Lord dad he said I
[1:18:35] can't believe it he said for years I
[1:18:37] think he maybe said 15 or 20 years he
[1:18:39] said the side of my sinuses has been
[1:18:41] stopped up he said but Andrew I haven't
[1:18:43] been able to breathe out of this he said
[1:18:44] but I just remembered something it's
[1:18:46] about two hours later he said when you
[1:18:49] read that quote he said he said I
[1:18:50] believe that and said yes Lord I believe
[1:18:52] it and he said nothing changed he said
[1:18:54] but I said I believe it anyhow and two
[1:18:56] hours later a miracle was perfect
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:19:02] miracle was performed in that man's body
[1:19:07] who'd done it I didn't
[1:19:10] the word did it what are you saying
[1:19:12] preacher I'm seeing God is in the midst
[1:19:15] of his church it was out the other day
[1:19:17] I'm just going to share a few and I'm
[1:19:18] done it was after the day at brother
[1:19:20] biscals I was preaching there in a in a
[1:19:23] camp last year I was there preaching
[1:19:24] some of y'all hear probably know brother
[1:19:26] brother Murphy Wong he's a precious
[1:19:27] brother from China gotta hold this
[1:19:29] message and burn the world up with it
[1:19:31] now she's out there preaching and I
[1:19:33] didn't know his family but his daughter
[1:19:34] Grace and her husband brother Luis I
[1:19:36] believe is his name was sitting over in
[1:19:38] the meeting and while I was preaching I
[1:19:40] stopped math for third pool and I said
[1:19:41] now listen I said if a prophet spoke
[1:19:43] squirrels into existence I said and I
[1:19:46] stopped and I said like this I said God
[1:19:47] didn't come down and he didn't go down
[1:19:49] there and find some squirrel gut
[1:19:50] squirrel blood squirrel bones and say
[1:19:53] abracadabra abracadoo I make a squirrel
[1:19:55] out of you
[1:19:56] I said he didn't do that there was
[1:19:58] nothing there to make a scroll out of
[1:20:01] but he spoke to a prophet and a squirrel
[1:20:04] come into existence I said I believe the
[1:20:06] same God that could create something out
[1:20:07] of nothing can do the same thing for you
[1:20:09] I didn't know what our sister was going
[1:20:12] through her and her husband had been
[1:20:13] married for several years and they was
[1:20:15] just hiring a child that next year I go
[1:20:18] back for that camp and here comes
[1:20:19] brother Murphy if you know brother
[1:20:21] Murphy he's just about to that but now
[1:20:22] he's all happy you know he comes up and
[1:20:24] he says I must ask you I want to tell
[1:20:26] you or something you know brother Murphy
[1:20:27] talks he said I want you and he starts
[1:20:29] telling me and he said you remember last
[1:20:31] year when you was here and his daughter
[1:20:32] walked over there she said Let Me Tell
[1:20:34] It Hat she said while you were preaching
[1:20:36] she said I've been to the doctor and the
[1:20:38] doctor told me I could not have a child
[1:20:41] without a surgery amen because there was
[1:20:44] something missing in my body to conceive
[1:20:46] a child she said with Andrew I went
[1:20:48] through a prayer line two years before
[1:20:49] she said and brother Ron had a vision
[1:20:51] brother vision and said she'll have a
[1:20:54] baby she said I believe that my brother
[1:20:56] Ron's vision from God and the surgery of
[1:20:59] the doctor I would have that child she
[1:21:01] said but last year on that Wednesday
[1:21:02] night while you were preaching she said
[1:21:04] something struck my heart that if he
[1:21:06] could create a squirrel then he could do
[1:21:08] something to my body she said I went
[1:21:11] home the next day I got up to go to Camp
[1:21:13] the next morning she said I took a
[1:21:15] pregnancy test she said hardly nobody
[1:21:17] knew it but I come to Camp last year
[1:21:19] carrying a positive pregnancy test and
[1:21:22] she said here's the baby tonight
[1:21:25] [Applause]

[1:21:35] now I know I've gone over and you
[1:21:38] forgive me but I got to say this
[1:21:40] God has done something for every single

[1:22:42] and praise God I got to testify so to
[1:22:44] make a long story short the year before
[1:22:47] brother Nikki had been to the Amazon on
[1:22:49] a missionary trip when he got there he'd
[1:22:51] come back to the States He preached he
[1:22:53] went home to South Africa next day he
[1:22:55] gets home he ends up in the ICU in an
[1:22:58] isolation room with a with a disease he
[1:23:01] contacted in the Amazon literally
[1:23:03] destroying the organs in his body
[1:23:05] he said but Andrew or while he was
[1:23:07] testifying he told me later I forgot the
[1:23:09] pictures if you want to see him he said
[1:23:10] the scans were they were running scans
[1:23:12] and he said my lungs was leaving my body
[1:23:15] they were disappearing that that that
[1:23:16] that that disease was eating them up he
[1:23:19] said I was laying there praying and he
[1:23:20] says testifying he said I was laying
[1:23:22] there praying and I said God I got to
[1:23:24] have lungs to preach I got to be able to
[1:23:26] declare your word he said Lord I believe
[1:23:29] you're a Creator he said father would
[1:23:31] you come down right here and would you
[1:23:33] create a new set of lungs for me he said
[1:23:36] and I just breathed in just just took a
[1:23:38] real deep breath he said and it was a
[1:23:39] different breath he said it was a
[1:23:42] different breath he said the next day
[1:23:43] with Andrew they ran a scan he said and
[1:23:46] when they ran the scan they come in and
[1:23:48] said Mr Sonic we don't know what
[1:23:50] happened we ran several stands here's
[1:23:52] the scan yesterday his lungs was eat up
[1:23:55] to hear his lungs was leaving his body
[1:23:58] that scan showed a brand new set of
[1:24:01] created
[1:24:05] a brand new
[1:24:07] set of creative lungs a brand new set of
[1:24:12] them I thought oh my when he said that
[1:24:14] testify I said praise the Lord and when
[1:24:16] I said that brother I was sitting about
[1:24:18] there and all of a sudden this the
[1:24:20] spirit of God swept over me kind of like
[1:24:22] he did to him just kind of swept over me
[1:24:24] and I had my notebook out and I wrote
[1:24:27] down these words this is a creative
[1:24:29] meeting
[1:24:30] and I thought dear Lord why that I said
[1:24:32] I said this is a creative meeting and
[1:24:35] brother Thomas God is my witness the
[1:24:37] Holy Ghost spoke right out of me and I
[1:24:38] wrote it down as the Holy Ghost was
[1:24:39] giving it to me this is a creative
[1:24:42] meeting and cancer is trespassing on
[1:24:45] Creative lungs I wrote it down I still
[1:24:48] got it cancer is trespassing on Creative
[1:24:51] lungs and when I said that I thought oh
[1:24:53] dear God
[1:24:54] this meeting is the same meaning that
[1:24:57] brother Ron Spencer was preaching in
[1:24:59] 2000 or but this brother was pitched in
[1:25:01] 2009 and he just come to the fire and
[1:25:03] brother Ron's lungs was destroyed and he
[1:25:06] stands up Harbor The Edge preaching and
[1:25:08] God creates a new set of lungs in his
[1:25:10] body
[1:25:11] y'all just forgive me a brand new set of
[1:25:14] lungs and here's a man in the Pulpit
[1:25:17] nearly 10 years later testifying that
[1:25:20] the same God that created the Heaven to
[1:25:21] the earth created lungs in his body and
[1:25:24] we're fishing to hear of the Ron preach
[1:25:26] and he's going to preach from those
[1:25:28] lungs that were creative but now the
[1:25:30] devil says he's got lung cancer so in
[1:25:33] the back room being the guy I am I said
[1:25:35] brother Ron I said I want to ask you
[1:25:36] something I said do you mind if I share
[1:25:38] some of your testimony he said bro you
[1:25:39] go right ahead I said well I just want
[1:25:41] to share this portion I started my about
[1:25:44] to test one in his lungs and I said
[1:25:45] brother if it's okay I want to share
[1:25:47] that explainer he said you share it he
[1:25:50] said and let me give you something else
[1:25:51] you might want I promise you I'm down
[1:25:52] here he said let me give you something
[1:25:54] else you might won't I said I'll take
[1:25:56] all I can get he said the other day they
[1:25:58] ran scans on my lungs he said when they
[1:26:01] ran them scans he said
[1:26:03] the doctors come in there and said Mr
[1:26:05] Spencer you have one and cancer but
[1:26:08] here's the difference said your lungs
[1:26:10] are so powerful that the cancer cannot
[1:26:13] get in the lungs he said the tumors are
[1:26:16] hanging on the lungs
[1:26:18] I said oh mercy
[1:26:21] ouch don't you tell me that my God is
[1:26:25] not a Creator he created those lungs and
[1:26:28] you say why'd you say that because I
[1:26:29] said that to say this God created those
[1:26:32] lungs and the devil ain't strong enough
[1:26:34] to get into what God created so because
[1:26:36] he's a trespasser he cannot get in him
[1:26:39] so he'll trespass on them but you know
[1:26:42] what I stand here tonight to say that
[1:26:44] devil has no legal rights

[1:27:12] Holy Ghost I say Satan take your hands
[1:27:15] off for God's Property and release their
[1:27:17] face to believe in the god of paradox
