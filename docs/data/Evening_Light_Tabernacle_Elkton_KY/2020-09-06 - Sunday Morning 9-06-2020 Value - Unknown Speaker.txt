========================================

[Applause] and thank you for what you've done for us lord our hearts and ourselves this morning lord jesus for the things this world don't mean nothing like they did ten years ago [Music] our number face to face lord i don't think there's no way we can concrete the lord to see the scripture this morning when it says the gift of the house of god will not be done that's what we're supposed to do or we can either walk out better than when [Music] lord we ask you that was one more time this day lord jesus and we thank you lord for getting us through our situations in the last few weeks before that said we report to them every morning [Applause] [Music] in every aspect of the service this morning and we keep you all the honor glory praying for your word we love you lord jesus christ amen amen oprah ask us to open our bibles to matthew 5 we'll read verses 1 through 16 the last one together and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say shall and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its savior wherewith shall be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden underfoot of men neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house light your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father

talk about who we are but you realize when they walk down that hall and you walk where you work at you know who you are think about who you are you are jesus christ walking in flesh to this generation and brother branham said when this little bride recognizes who she is we'll be gone and they may look at us and they may think they're just religious fanatics they dress a certain way but they do not realize who they have been in their presence they do not realize that that's god he's letting them see him in this generation and i am so thankful and that's why i get so excited and so happy to that he's helping me realize who i am no matter what kind of mistake i make when i ask him to forgive me he's there to help me and i say lord let these people see jesus christ in me don't let them see me because all they're going to see is a failure and someone that can be very short and very not understanding but let them see the compassion the love of jesus christ in their heart life this morning

learn father that whether lord we have it good or whether we have it bad lord jesus we want to give you the same honor and the same glory and the same praise lord knowing that not always is everything

together lord in your precious name lord and to present ourselves before you and to give you honor and glory for all that you are and what you mean to us we ask god that you bless them bless the reading of the word and then the meditation of our heart father and that which we feel you've laid upon our heart to minister this morning we just pray that they would minister to your children and that each one here or father would be fed from the word of god we love you lord jesus and we commit this time and this day to you now in jesus name amen and amen may god bless this reading of his word turn your bibles if you will to matthew matthew 13. matthew 13 and verse 40 four we'll begin with 44. the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hidden in a field the which when a man had found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he found the pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it over in matthew let's go to chapter 10 matthew chapter 10 and verse 29 actually yeah that'll be fine 29 are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear ye not therefore for ye are of more value than many sparrows and over in matthew 6 matthew 6 verse 19 lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth moth and rust that's corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven where neither moth nor rust does corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also may god add his blessings to reading the words you can be seated this morning i want to take some of the simplest things that we already know and perhaps just look at it a little bit different with the help of the lord this morning amen even the scriptures that we've read and this one this one word is what came to my heart and mind when i began to study for a message and that is found in the 10th chapter again in verse 31. he says fear ye not therefore for ye are of more value than many sparrows and i want to talk about value just that word value is that all right let's talk about value amen and so as i began to think about that i began to think about what jesus talked about before he talked about value and then i began to think about what he said about how the actual even the kingdom of god is about like or is it he took for an example of course and we know that there's many different examples but the one example that he took was of a merchant man all right a businessman isn't that right looking for something of value right because i don't know about you but i think every one of us that when we go shopping what do we look for value right something that is uh you know that's when you pay your money you know because all of us no doubt have been ripped off right we've just been you know we realized we buy some sometimes you probably are maybe online or whatever it might be and when you get it you're like man i paid good money this is not worth it right it wasn't didn't have the value that you thought that it did and so all of us as human beings if we lived any amount of time and i think that the older that you get you are more careful before you buy something isn't that right you want to look things over you want to check it out good isn't that right you take the extra time to make sure that you're getting your value and i believe that's what jesus was saying here that the kingdom of heaven is kind of like that in this world a smart man looks for value amen but abandoned he preached on something called investments isn't that right that before people going investing things you know they check things out you don't want no fly by night you know thing that just overnight and get rich quick scheme he says most of the times those don't pan out to be what they're uh cracked up to be isn't that right so even in there it talks about how that is in many different places god talked about value he talked about trading he talked about having given up been given a talent and then you go and multiply with that talent and so forth and you know and if you don't use what you got and come back and and you bury it or whatever you know you'll be cast out as an unprofitable servant but i want to take this thought with just for a little bit for the help of the lord about value and what is real value amen what real value is amen and so we looked at that and see now that jesus said here he said you know that uh like a merchant man going and what does he do when he finds that pearl of great price and you know a lot of people i want to tell you a lot of people you know people go to church for a lot of different reasons people are christians for a lot of different reasons amen a lot of times those reasons are wrong all right and i have concluded this one thing and that is there's uh uh really two different kinds of believers that mattered a real genuine believer amen his true value is in jesus christ and almighty god and in the things that are not seen all right and then there's so many christians that perhaps go to church and you know they're just trying to appease their soul because maybe they're afraid of what the afterlife is or whatever it might be but they go for another reason and they might say that they have their eyes set on christ and and on on the true value of life but they they may come to find out they really don't amen because the bible talks about he says wherever your heart is wherever your treasure is that's where your heart is going to be also amen where whatever you value that's what you're going to think about amen watch what constantly comes out of a person's mouth and you'll find out where their value is what they really think where their real treasure is and what what what it really means to them amen you talk about a fisherman that's a true fisherman he's going to talk to you about how big a bass he caught and and this that or the other or a hunter or whatever it might be but you take a christian amen like the prophet said you know and he's interested in talking about christ amen that's the top priority amen amen i just appreciate the lord revealing a couple of things to me this weekend and showing me a couple things and i just want to share that lord but i looked at that and it says it talks about value first of all i want to talk about value and then i want to talk about the how that the true valuable things it meant anything that is truly valuable is something that you can't see and then we want to talk about two or three different things if the things that you can't see amen go through detail with those with the help of the lord amen but uh let me see here so jesus said here that you got to be careful about laying up treasures on the earth how many knows that a true christian according to 1st john 3 i believe it is he says he says that we ought to set your affections on things above and not on things beneath we as human beings everything everything that has to do with this flesh in this world amen has to do with the material things of this world amen and so a lot of times it has a big pull on us right it has a big pull on us because it affects our life here all right but we realize that all of this as it you know all of these things that we have here truly aren't valuable all right they're truly not they're not they're not real value at all anything that you can see so he says don't don't don't do that don't lay it up in the in the down here but lay it up lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven we're not you know because it doesn't matter i think in this world every one of us likes to have i like to have new stuff i like to have good stuff don't you but it doesn't matter how newest stuff you buy how good a stuff you buy it isn't very long till it's junk doesn't matter what it is it all wears out it all rusts out amen it all gets old no matter how good it is and it's the same way with your even your own body amen no matter if you're 20 years old and how strong you are eventually it's gonna turn gray eventually you're gonna lose your strength that you have and it's gonna get weaker and weaker it's gonna get old it's gonna wear out amen so the things of the earth the things of this world aren't really truly all right and guess what they're not even really real amen they're not really real how many knows but bam says you know he says you might say you've seen me but we realized that he said that i've never really seen you and you have never really seen me amen because the real valuable thing is on the inside the thing that you can't see this is just the house that we live in that has to be changed for some time all right but abandoned was up in canada i believe it was and he was preaching and i believe he had called out that soldiers so forth and yet discern uh the thoughts and tense of the heart to the people you know jesus christ did through him and the next day he was down by a merchant man somewhere amen and they had a television going i guess it was some kind of a television salesman or something but he got to talk in this man and this man said oh he says you ain't with this branham outfit down here are you and i said yes sir i am and he said oh he said what do you think about that guy i says well oh i don't know and he says well he says i'll tell you i think he's the biggest hypocrite that i ever seen i said you really do and yes i sure do he said the first thing he's got nothing but psychology and i said what uh were you there last night he said yeah and i said what that soldier they brought up there all crippled up and so forth oh he said that soldier could have walked anyhow if he just tried it hm and i says are you a christian he says oh no said i don't believe in none of that stuff and i said oh he said i'm a scientist he says he said and anything that cannot be scientifically proven it's absolutely an heir amen it's not real [Music] in other words it's really not worth nothing oh and i said uh-huh i said i hate to take the other side but i said i'm gonna tell you the real things that are things that cannot be scientifically proved praise the lord the real things are things that cannot be scientifically proven all right oh he says you're wrong that says all right i want to he said if it can't be scientifically proven then it's not real now i said well partner i believe that the things that are real cannot be scientifically proven and anything that's scientifically proven is not real amen oh my it's perishable brother branham's ass i mean believe that it's perish even heaven earth shall pass away it even gonna put everything that we see it's gonna perish it's gonna burn with fervent heat you know they can take you back they can take your body back to ashes and back to dust amen not real but he says anything like that is not real and he said oh he said i think you're wrong and i said i want to ask you one thing are you a married man he said sure got any children yes i said you love your wife he said yes sir and i said what is love i said scientifically show me what love is amen all right what is love all right show me what love is what's the difference about that woman than the other woman what's different about the children then these other children love you couldn't scientifically prove your love that you have for her it can't be scientifically proven that you even have a mind that's right and i thought i had the next page but i don't but it comes to find out this brother this man here brother branham finally comes down to telling this man that he's actually brother branham and brother and he says you know well i just called you a hypocrite to your face and brother brown says well that's the way to do it if you're going to say them tell it to my face you know but you know mother bantam the point that he was making here amen is that anything that is visible anything that is seen is not real how many knows that we get so excited about things that we can see feel here and so forth but you know anything that's not seeable is real and paul said it this way paul said in first corinthians he says for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but the things that are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal so even paul bears out that the things that you can see they're only temporary amen and the real things that are real good and that are real are things that you can't see praise the lord how many knows that one time that sometimes when you're worshiping amen or when you're praying amen sometimes you just close your eyes because why you're shutting off your contact with the world because when you look it has an effect everything has an effect on what you see remember somebody moving around it but when you close your eyes amen you begin to look at the unseen because how many knows that god you don't see god with your eyes praise be to god you can't see him with your eyes but he's there everything that's real in your life this morning it is by because of the things that you don't see praise the lord you know i might back up a little bit amen let me back up a little bit talk just a little bit more about uh this great treasure the most valuable things in the world the most valuable things in the world amen and we know of course how many knows that your life is worth how much you know people will play with their life am i right a lot of times people will risk their lives they don't realize that their life is worth ten thousand worlds now we put a price tag on it of ten thousand worlds but i'm going to give you my opinion of that i don't even believe that's a correct opinion a correct number because that's giving a way out their number that it's just hardly even imaginable for you and i is that right i mean what this world would be worth and then having 10 000 worlds that's just almost infinite so i can say this morning i believe that there's just really no telling how valuable your life really is is that right how many is that you know that's why we sometimes we take that for granted how many know we take everything else serious and don't realize sometimes that the most valuable thing that you have is your life amen how many believes that i don't know about you but i'm glad to be alive let's not be like that no i am glad to be alive i am glad that god chose me out of a million people to come from my mother's womb he chose me to have and to come into this world thank you lord not right but now we know that that life was granted you it was predestinated by god you know the bible says that this life that we now have it was born in sin shape and iniquity come into this world speaking lies and if you only have this life you are going to lose your life how many knows that there has to be a preservative to this life amen there have to be a way to preserve your life because if you just live this life out as a sinful human being you're going to lose it even jesus said that he that saves his life will lose his life amen so we find out that one of the greatest the or should we say the greatest the greatest thing upon the face of the earth is the means by which you are able to preserve your life whatever that means is is the greatest value in the world the means of preserving your life amen aaron what is it can you tell me what that is stephen what is the means that we have of preserving our life close yes serving the lord jesus is the only preservative who knows he that hath the son hath life he that hath not the son has not life he is what preserved it is that right jesus christ of course yeah christ is what preserves our life amen now how many knows that in order to purchase in order to purchase the preservative of your life there has to be a price paid amen jesus said it had to let me see if i can find it there one place there right after he said ye are of more value than many sparrows amen many worlds and whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will i confess before my father which is in heaven whosoever will deny me before man him will i deny him from my father which is in heaven now i want to go down to here amen in verse 38 he says that he now let's go back up a little bit he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me now how many knows oh my and he that love a son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me can we say or husband or wife or job or church even brother branham says you can't love your church if your church is wrong and you're not willing to forsake your church for the sake of christ you aren't worthy of this great pearl [Music] amen i'll tell you what it takes the love of god in your heart he says i'll tell you what you gotta love this pearl amen right here more than any you gotta value me over your hood but over your wife you gotta value me over anything else including your own life huh you gotta value him more than your own life let me tell you this you'll never be a proper christian you'll never be and live a proper christian life until you completely die to yourself and let christ rule in your heart it'll always be you'll always have way terrible glitches it'll be a deformed stalk a deformed christian until christ has supreme control of your life he said if anybody if you value anything else more than me you're not worthy of this preservative if you preserve your life here and you want to live your life he said you're going to lose it but if you will lose your life for my sake you will preserve it [Music] in other words how many did he take to dying of ourself to let christ rule and become top priority in our hearts and souls that's the only way that is going to work and there's so many let me tell you there's so many that say and claim to be serving god but they're really serving their self they're really still living their own life thinking their own thoughts still have worldly ambitions a real true christian let me make this clear a real true christian's ambitions are not on the things of this world their ambitions are for the other world not that you don't take care of things here in progress and all that but your heart is over there your heart looks to the things that are not seen not at the things that are seen that's where your desires are that's where your values are [Music] is that all right it's a little different way of looking at it but the lord just showed me that because jesus believes in value amen trade in me your life and i'll give you a life way better than what you got what a deal everybody likes a good deal [Applause] jesus gave humanity a great deal it's a good deal trade in your life you can have mine keep your life and you'll lose it simple deal do you want this preservative do you want this great value or don't you want this value amen praise the lord that's right more than me son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me that taketh not his cause and followed after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it praise be to god hallelujah amen how many know that even your soul is spiritual it's not natural it's unseen your still soul still lives even after your body dies even it is spiritual amen all these temporal things that really don't hold any value what did jesus say he said what will a man give in exchange for his soul what will he do if he gains the whole world but if he loses his soul he has lost everything he has gained absolutely nothing even less than nothing amen why because you got to pay for all of that amen what will a man give in exchange for his soul the most valuable thing that we have is of course your life and jesus christ the number two thing i want to say is the means by which we preserve our life and that is jesus christ is the most valuable that's true value amen i sound like paul harvey don't i how many heard paul harvey i remember mixing mud up in ohio cold winters and having a wheelbarrow mud and my boss they like paul harvey and every news time 12 o'clock they wouldn't miss paul harvey and now you know the rest of the story is that him that's way back in my mind somewhere i didn't even think about it till just then but yeah you know the rest of the story that's true value he always promoted that hardware true value hardware you know i thought i'll say what true value is the lord jesus christ that's true value amen how many loves him this morning i say thank god for all the things he's done you know i think that's so appropriate for us to worship the lord and say thank you for all that you've done for us because you don't realize folks how how valuable that the lord jesus christ is and the things that are not seen amen so let me go into the second phase if i can but i want to read you another fairy tale and kids are y'all ready for a fairy tale the morning brother bam tells a fairy tale kids he says this is come follow me tucson arizona 63. kids you each one seem like mine you each one seem like you're just my sons and daughters he says and in one way that you are spiritually speaking that's right the lord has put your souls into my care because you come and listen to me and you believe me and in one sense of the word you are my sons and daughters that's right and always remember keeping the commandments of god is a great thing being raised in a good home is a heritage from god and being a fine kids with personalities to have good wonderful to have an education it's wonderful to even live in this free land we've got many things to be thankful for and there's one thing that you just don't inherit he says you've got to accept it and that's eternal life and you're and you'll only do it do that by following jesus and being born again having an experience don't neglect that he says a little story one time i heard a man say he was poor how many of us were all born poor amen he always wanted it's a little fairy story like it always stuck with me though and one day he picked up a flower and the flower was magic and the flower had answered him and said you've been poor all your life and he says now ask what you will and it will be given to you amen isn't that what the lord told us ask what you will and you shall receive it amen you shall ask and you shall receive he'll knock and it'll be opened unto you let me tell you that's our lord isn't it and he said yonder all right you've been now listen he says the flower answered him uh you before oh you're like i asked what you willing to be given to he said yet that yonder mountain would open up and i could go there in and find gold in that mountain he says well you'll have to take me wherever you go see you'll have to take me with you so wherever i am then ask what you will how many beliefs unless without jesus he says without me you can do nothing somebody believes that if you're ever going to be blessed it'll be because you take jesus wherever you go always take him with you and ask what you will and i'll tell you you will find the true treasures of life how maybe there's treasures in that mountain there's treasures in christ oh my just can't imagine amen praise the lord you want to stop the son joshua did you want to slay giants david did amen you want to slay a thousand philistines devils amen samson did nothing was impossible even back then nothing was impossible and nothing is impossible with us as long as you're in christ all right but you got to take me with you he walked up to the mountain and the mountain opened up he went in and the shells was full of gold and diamonds and as the little fairy story goes he laid the flower down on a table or a rock and he run and he grabbed the big gym and he said i must go show this to my friends and how rich i am i'll be i have everything now i'ma show this so the flowers spoke up and said you've forgotten the main thing so he runs back and picks up a set well maybe i'll get a piece of gold i'll get a piece of silver and i'll hurry i got to go tell how rich i am or while i what i've got and he went to the door and flower said but you forgot the main thing so he runs back again he says in here are all kinds of materials so he picked up a stone he says i'll take the stone and show the people what kind of stone this mountain's made up so i can find my way back again see and he started out the door to flowers that it's the final time you have forgot the main thing oh he said shut up see he didn't want to hear no more he forgot the main thing and he ran out the door and when he did the door closed behind him with the flower on the inside and the main thing was the flower see the main thing is the flower honey believes the lord has been good to us lord is good he give you breath he'll give you a life he gives you he gives you everything that you have you wouldn't be here without him but sometimes we have a tendency to forget the main faith praise the lord how many knows the main thing is the baptism of the holy ghost it is having christ in your heart on a daily basis that's the main thing having the fire of the holy spirit burning in your soul daily amen not just revival now and then but to be in a constant fire burning for the lord that's the main thing don't get so caught up with everything that god gives you that you forget the main thing he is worthy of praise and honor and glory and thanks and constant worship but we get so busy about the gold and the silver and the stones and everything else that god has made we forgot the flower we've got him amen praise the lord oh my so let's not forget the main thing is him okay let's talk about something else let's talk about some other real valuable things in our life most valuable things are things that are not seen amen all right we know over in hebrews it says that faith is the substance of the things hoped for it is the evidence of things not seen i mean those a lot of people have problems with faith unbelievers especially they gotta they have a problem with faith they want something that they can either do themselves or that they can see or they won't believe it unless they can see it right you know that's not the way it is with a christian oh my i suppose i should go back a little bit i'm going to go back a little bit and talk about even more pressure things because faith is something that's a little further down the line one of the greatest one of the greatest treasures one of the greatest values that we have today is grace god's grace because we don't be done without his grace and his forgiveness i want to talk about this forgiveness a little bit and i want to say forgive me but i want to say that god can't just forgive you huh god can't just forgive you all right and i hope i'm not out of line god can't just forgive you no he can't just forgive you because we know the bible says that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins huh so there has to be a justification for your sin huh god has to make a way that he can forgive you right because guess what how many knows under the old testament on the bulls and goats those people were what forgiven right but not justified and they were forgiven and the brother bam says that he just covered their sins the beloved bulls go it only covered it it did not remit it and what is it they could never go into paradise under the covering of bloods or goats isn't that right they could never go out of that place they could never ought to leave out of that place that they were until after calvary isn't that right because god's not going to take anything sinful or anything wrong into heaven how many knows remembers this statement that all sin has to be paid for not just forgiven but paid for all right because god's not an unjust god god's a just god if he forgives you he's forgiving you because he's paying for what you did all right that's right so without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness there is no remission outside of the shedding of the blood that's why a substitute had to give his life for god not to kill adam and eve he accepted a substitute of a sheep and the lamb except that and that covered it but it didn't remit it i mean it believes that we have remissions of sins now grace amen made a way for us to be forgiven amen aren't you glad for that it provided a way for us to be forgiven and that all ties back to calgary oh precious is the flow that makes me white as no no other fountain i know nothing but the blood of jesus i love that song maybe we can sing nothing but the blood nothing but the blood we always look back to the blood because it did everything that we needed it provided for us they couldn't go to heaven they couldn't just go up there amen until their sins were remitted until they were gone and the real price had been paid for them that price had to be paid amen and jesus christ paid that price the brother says all sin has to be paid for amen not believe that without the remissions there is no forgiveness there is no remitting of sins amen so now we see grace providing jesus christ providing a lamb so that we can be forgiven i'm so aren't you thankful for forgiveness forgiveness through faith in jesus christ the lord that's the only way there is any permission there's only forgiveness through faith in jesus christ faith in what christ did for you and for what he did on calvary because i'll tell you every one of us oh what do you think about it that we were supposed to die we were supposed to be separated from god amen we were supposed to pay the price that he paid but he paid the price for you and i now he can forgive you you can either accept that forgiveness how many knows you can accept that forgiveness he's already spoken to forgiveness he died for the sins of the whole world but a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received many believes you have to accept that he forgives you amen amen you accept that he forgives you of your sins he took your sin upon him upon himself at calvary everyone here since why do you think that when brother branham seen that blood and when he seen his scenes coming up against that blood every time he would every time his sins would hit jesus would like bend over it would like it would hurt him every time every time you seen it hurt him and he paid for that sin for that hurt on the cross of calvary and he took his side and his blood and with his blood he said pardoned for all of his sins how many is glad for that amen so real real value is of course in the grace of almighty god which is comes by amen now we come down to how we receive it amen how to receive this grace how to accept this grace how do we get this grace for by grace are you saved through faith amen praise the lord oh my i'll tell you what what if what if a banker whatever with a president of the bank would have his vault full of money huh full of money and he would say i'm quitting i don't want that bank no more brother joe here's the key can you imagine what that'd be like would you be happy i ain't got to crash no cars no more all right all right guys coming out of the tree down brother john you know you it would be you'd have it no but all you'd have to have is that key huh and let me tell you something that's exactly what this romans go with me to romans if you will let's look at this key way over in romans the 5th chapter romans 5 is the key oh my it says romans 5 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith how many believes that everything that you get from god amen you get by faith amen the joy that you have the peace that you have the forgiveness that you have it don't matter what it is it is goes and travels on the vehicle of faith that's what gets it the vehicle the channel should we say of faith something that's totally not seen that's the only way that we receive all of these great values is through the operation and channel of faith praise the lord oh my we have access by faith into this grace praise be to god it is faith that brings you and gives you amen brings you to the place of grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god praise be to god hallelujah think about it oh by faith by faith we have access to god how many believes that one of the one of the great values of this world first of all is to be happy happiness and how many knows that you're never gonna be happy outside of justification outside of having your sins forgiven huh how many believes that that's right because we as human beings especially us of all of us who were brought up in church no there's a judgment day coming not right we realize we got to give an answer for everything that we ever did unless it gets under the blood and we carry that around we carry this weight so to speak around amen and so we have this and we begin to it weighs us down and it causes not to have any joy not to have any peace let me tell you something this world look at the chaos that's out there all of that chaos is for one reason and because of one reason and that is because they have not taken the greatest value thing that there is in this world and that's jesus christ by faith that's why they're so tore up about equal rights and everything else huh how many of those we as christians hey if you want to chop our head off chop our head off if you want to burn us at the stake burn is at the stake jesus says don't be afraid of what they can do to your body huh because they can kill you they will be thou faithful unto death isn't that right those hundreds of thousands of people right after the book of acts that would go to the martyrs even they would die and give their life they forfeited their right to live huh hey if they wanted to not forfeit their right to live they'd have taken up arms and fought huh but we're all paul said like sheep to the slaughter we're just interested in one thing and that is serving god and if everybody had that attitude you know think of where the world would be at we try not to do each other wrong or harm we try to treat the other guy as we want to be treated isn't that right it would be a great place we'd be in the millennium we'd be in heaven if everybody followed this here but we know that we're living in a wolf country that right i sent you forth as sheep among wolves be careful be wise therefore we're in wolf country amen but let's go back to think of the list look at this faith by faith we have this how many believes that that is something that's not seen but it's one of the most powerful things that we have brother man also he makes a statement he says that well it's a right according to corinthians even um let me just read the scripture second corinthians 5 i think it is well i have it wrote down here i think i do talking about even the weapons that we have spiritual weapons that we fight against the devil with i should know my bible a little better no all right so we'll just repeat it for the weapons of our warfare while we are in the flesh we do not war against the flesh paul's head the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but spiritual to the pulling down of strongholds we cast down reasoning and imagination and everything that exalts itself above the word of god amen so we realize that the the weapons that we have to fight against the devil they are even unseen they're not something that you see it's something that's on the inside but yet it's real how do you believe that you overcome the thoughts and the number one battle is in our mind the number one thing that we have to overcome is the imagination and the reasoning in our mind amen that's the first thing that jesus and the faith real genuine faith will capture every thought paul said capture every thought and bring it down to the obedience of christ amen moses when he was over in hebrews talks about by faith moses amen when he he he was born he was hit three months from his parents because they thought that he was a proper child but they were not afraid of the king commandments and by faith by moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter praise the lord how many knows that it is absolutely what governs our life is the faith that's in our arms we make choices based either on doubt or we make choices based on faith and it governs our life moses it says that he said he esteemed he too chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of god and then what was our bible reading this morning uh blessed are you when men shall cast your name out and persecute you and all these things amen that's the way of a christian christian they're going to be talked bad about when they don't do bad they're going to be called evil when they're not evil and moses he chose rather to suffer with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season moses had his eye on that great value of eternal life and he knew even as brother branham described that you talk about the best life that a man could ever imagine all the pleasures that you could bestow upon yourself as a human being and in the flesh moses could have had it but he forfeited all of those things because in verse 26 he esteemed the reproach of christ greater riches than all the treasures of egypt hallelujah how many believe that every son of abraham does the same thing we esteem the treasures of god greater than any of these things that the devil would want to entice you with let me tell you something in this world it isn't just about being a christian amen and escaping hell but it's about having in your heart the greatest treasure there is on the face of the earth that's what it's all about god is not just something amen to be scared of or worried about that but god is a treasure how many believes that men i'll tell you god is your treasure that's where your heart's going to be oh let me just say while it comes to my one of the greatest things that we have also amen i believe in the arsenal of the believer amen is prayer i read in the bible here is that jesus said that men ought always to pray even jesus was telling us you need to pray you need to pray i mean please it's a real joy to go down let me just say this amen if you don't everybody here i hope that you'll commit this morning that if you don't take time on your knees pray you need to make time to pray you don't realize the value of it right brother joe the value of prayer it is valuable it'll bring peace to your heart it'll bring joy to your heart it'll bring the presence of god into your heart so that when we come to church we bring the presence of god with us how many believes that's what we want god help me to bring the presence of god with me when i come to church not just be wally wally wu jerusalem so to speak with bible real joy in my heart amen it's a real value prayer faith joy it's a value it's one of the greatest values there and it's all supernatural brother bram says you know anything you can see it's not real but how many knows joy is real happiness is real peace is real the holy ghost is real being justified is real praise be to god hallelujah let me touch on this i thought of justification for a minute shall we i mean remember brahman in the invisible union he talks about how that we are not only he says now you're not only forgiven hallelujah because i believe it takes a little bit more than just being forgiven no it takes being justified praise the lord how many knows he rising he justified freely forever in other words he made us just he made us right oh my but you're justified romans 5 1 says we're therefore justified by faith look at the word the word don't even mean forgiven whoa i guess brother brown had a good thought he says it don't mean forgiven that word means justified and it don't mean that you're forgiven for instance you heard that i got drunk and did some evil thing and so forth come around to me saying well i found out you did that and i forgive you he says then you come and i say forgive me i didn't do it hallelujah how many believes that that's where you stand if you're gonna go in the rapture amen if you're gonna meet the lord in the air you aren't just gonna have your sins covered they're gonna be completely remanded not disremoted but justified you'll stand justified as though you've never done it in the first place as far as god's concerned you have never even done those things justified in the sight of god [Music] praise be to god i'll be thankful for justification amen if you have completely have your sins remitted in the sea of god forgive them you ought to be the happiest person in the world why because you have peace with god amen how many thankful for that peace that you have in your heart amen i can tell you that i could sin to sit under an evergreen give me a thousand years just to sit there and fold my hands and say thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus year 500 thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you for the peace that's in my heart lord thank you for what you did for me thank you for calvary lord thank you for making a way that i could be forgiven not just covered but remitted not just remitted but completely justified as to i never did it in the first place thank you lord and then i would take another thousand years put a beat hallelujah hallelujah [Music] down through the echoes you know of the valleys i want to hear that going hallelujah [Music] glory glory glory glory amen to my worship the lord for about a million years it's the joy it's the happy it's what we live for i mean looking forward to being over there brother branham at an early age he lost his wife and a child so he had ambition to be with them all of his life he had a sight set over the under and try to get as many in as he possibly could amen i hear him talking about taking the tithe of the people he says and as soon as i get some tithing saved up amen i head to the mission fields and go over there and win another million that was better branham's goal amen because the souls are what real value here is store them up in heaven amen moth won't corrupt over there they won't get old over there hey maybe the gospel if it wouldn't have been for you coming and sharing this gospel and leave me to christ i wouldn't be here today and that what the old lady said thank you wouldn't it be for you going i wouldn't be here and you can look in those people who've you've led to the lord amen and see that they'll be eternally in the heavens our true values our true treasures are over there amen in heaven our true treasure and our true value is in the supernatural realm that's why i believe brothers and sisters if you don't get anything else out of the service this morning said it in your heart how many wants a closer walk with the lord then said it in your heart that you will not just say a prayer perhaps so loosely but get down on your knees find a place to go before the lord because i truly believe brother and he says god loves for you to kneel down before him and go to prayer and talk to him god loves for you to do that amen i was in my office this morning and studying and usually i have that last minute pushing for all the things you know i said i think they'll be fine i says i think it's more important that i pray a little that i talk to the lord and it felt so good it always feels good every time this morning at home just to get down on your knees and talk to the lord how many knows what it feels like it just feels good amen you feel you know it feels good just to talk to him and know that he hears you and he draws you closer and it changes you to me that's worth more than any comfort that the devil would try to give somebody that's more comforting than any booze or beer or doper drug that he could offer yeah because all of that other stuff is just substitutes they're lies they don't give them any more peace they don't give them any more a comfort no they're more miserable afterwards than they were before how maybe there's only one way to have true comfort and that is to have this peace of god in your heart amen there's no greater place to be whether you have a dime in the bank or whether you're below whether you have a bouncing check account if you've got god in your heart you've got everything let the poor say i am rich amen amen because if you've got god if you've got the holy spirit if you've got peace in your heart if you have faith in god you have one of the most valuable things that there is on the earth amen the blood of jesus christ cleanse you amen at calvary amen i'm just glad for calvary it made the way for everything it made it possible for god to forgive you and justify you and sanctify you filled with the holy ghost and made a way to go to heaven all hinges right back on calvary god bless you let's stand this morning musicians if yellow will come i hope you enjoyed that the lord just kind of showed that this week and i thought thank you lord jesus amen some of the simpler scriptures that we are very familiar with but yet amen just bring it about in another way that makes it even more real to me thank you lord jesus i had never really thought about that they couldn't even go into paradise until after calvary because it took a remitting it took a the perfect lamb not the substitute lamb we took the perfect lamb man for to be able to be justified let's power heads this morning how many would just say i'm guilty of not praying like i should this morning brother bio and i want to raise my hand to the lord and say god i ask you to forgive me lord person than i am this morning if i prayed more i'd be happy a person i'd be closer to god if i would take the time to pray more if i get more serious about my walk with the lord father you see the hands all over the building lord jesus and my hand up is too god hand is up also lord for i get sometimes just too busy lord and that business that doesn't really bring me the things that i want lord but it's prayer it's my time with you that really gives me what i want father and i ask god this morning lord as you see every hand this morning that they realize they need to pray more lord it's a valuable tool to getting closer to god and have more of you lord and we ask god that you would help us to use this father to pray more as you have told us to that we ought to pray father we ask god that you draw every heart closer to you lord during this labor day weekend father that you bring us all closer father lord jesus forgive us of all of our sins and our failures we accept our forgiveness we accept what you did on calvary lord and we ask god that you'd wash every heart white bring us to justification and so we never did it in the first place lord we love you lord jesus and above everything else we want you to know that father we do never want to lay you down we never want to forget you you are our flower you are our lily in our valley lord jesus you're everything to us you're the most valuable thing that we have and we ask god that you'd help us lord to treasure you above everything else to love you more than anything else in this world father for you truly are the great treasure of our life and where our treasure is our heart is also we ask god set every heart this morning on you in jesus name amen and amen god bless you bye david
