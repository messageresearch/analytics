[25:40] for allowing time

[25:44] really my feeling i just feel like it's
[25:46] just a real blessing of the lord to be
[25:48] here with you
[25:49] i sure love you folks and appreciate you
[25:52] and i want to ask you to pray for a
[25:55] little situation
[25:56] uh i had a boy today that for the last
[25:59] several days has been
[26:00] trying to do a little contract and work
[26:02] there at the house and
[26:04] real bad shape he's on drugs and
[26:07] he showed up today high
[26:09] eyes bloodshot and all kinds of things
[26:11] carrying on cussing throwing things
[26:13] hollering i had to ask him to leave and
[26:16] just take his tools and go home
[26:18] and after a few hours of him carrying on
[26:21] he's in my backyard and i'm trying to
[26:23] pray them through the lord jesus he's
[26:25] crying asking god for mercy
[26:28] pray for this boy will you his name is
[26:29] russ harris i want you to hold him
[26:31] before the lord
[26:32] god don't put people like
[26:34] wait for no
[26:37] some help he needs some real help so
[26:39] pray for him if you will evidently he's
[26:41] um got himself in some trouble with the
[26:43] law of drugs you know and things and so
[26:45] next week he may
[26:47] be committed incarcerated for a bit i
[26:50] don't know he's talking about maybe
[26:51] having to go to jail but i stood there
[26:54] by him and as i listened that his story
[26:56] i thought about the lord jesus
[26:58] when he come up on that woman at the
[27:00] well and him standing there like that
[27:02] looking at her and i thought now
[27:04] wouldn't this be almost the same kind of
[27:05] picture if jesus was standing here like
[27:08] this and then it hit me
[27:10] he has no hands but our hands he has no
[27:13] eyes but our eyes no ears but our ears
[27:16] and i told the young man i said listen
[27:18] i said if the lord jesus was here he
[27:20] might look at you and say go and sin no
[27:23] more lest a great thing might come on
[27:24] you later on time
[27:26] but uh i said jesus is here he's just
[27:29] standing here with my hands and my eyes
[27:32] and my thoughts well there's a little
[27:33] bit much for him to handle but he said
[27:35] there's something about you he said i
[27:37] know that's different i said well i'll
[27:39] tell you what's the different part i
[27:41] said a little piece of god living right
[27:43] here and that's what you're wanting you
[27:45] need that but you don't know how to get
[27:47] there and then he started crying you're
[27:49] right he said i'm completely out of
[27:50] control he said i don't have power or
[27:51] anything
[27:52] and uh just real sad to see people bound
[27:55] like that so if you would just hold him
[27:57] up in prayer i think maybe his
[27:59] uh he told me one thing he said that
[28:01] everywhere he looks he sees demons
[28:03] like this and just while we were
[28:05] standing there i thought well
[28:07] when people get into drugs and things
[28:08] like that they hallucinate and see
[28:10] things
[28:11] i kindly felt in my spirit like he might
[28:13] be being tormented by evil spirits as
[28:16] well might be why you're seeing that so
[28:19] i've used this expression for a long
[28:21] time now my brother brown with them
[28:23] prayer lines and them demons
[28:25] saw they needed help they started crying
[28:27] brother joe help me help me get him to
[28:28] disbelieve and i've used the remark i
[28:31] stole it from a friend of mine but i use
[28:32] the remark on time
[28:34] demons had enough sense to be able to
[28:36] call for help when they got in trouble
[28:38] saints ought to be able to do the same
[28:39] thing
[28:40] and just like you folks when you prayed
[28:42] for me when i was in the hospital i
[28:44] didn't have faith enough for myself
[28:46] i knew god was gonna bring me out but i
[28:48] didn't i couldn't pray for myself and
[28:50] those situations like that you know how
[28:51] it is it's hard to pray for you hard to
[28:53] believe for you
[28:54] and saints of god were rallying around
[28:56] me and believing for me well let's do
[28:58] this with man just believe god will do
[29:00] something for him let's he ain't got the
[29:02] faith so let's have it for him and pray
[29:04] for him if you would and i know you
[29:05] don't know him and as far as knowing him
[29:07] from adam you wouldn't know him at all
[29:08] but
[29:09] if you trust me and you trust that i got
[29:11] a good judgment then you just trust me
[29:13] when i say he he needs help so we love
[29:16] you god bless so nice to be back in the
[29:18] house of the lord
[29:20] and i want my mama to come and sing
[29:22] you'll have to walk all the way upstairs
[29:24] i know it's a it's a journey
[29:25] [Laughter]
[29:29] you grab that rail well
[29:32] you want a mic down there you just won't

[36:35] samuel let's get right into the word of
[36:36] god if you have your bible philippians
[36:39] chapter 2
[36:40] and how appreciative we are surely
[36:43] enjoyed all of the music the singing and
[36:45] everything and it just so happened
[36:47] sister had the song i wanted right open
[36:49] on that page over there so
[36:51] i like that spiritual people look for
[36:53] spiritual things and i don't think
[36:55] that's a coincidence amen
[36:58] hallelujah you love the lord
[37:01] really really
[37:02] really do you
[37:04] i i i'm kind of guessing at this point i
[37:06] want you to convince me one time do you
[37:08] really love him
[37:10] yeah i know that sounded like believers
[37:12] i know he knows and amen all right
[37:14] philippians chapter 2 verse 5. i want to
[37:16] speak to you this evening the lord
[37:17] helping us upon overcoming
[37:21] by the cross
[37:22] overcoming by the cross
[37:25] all right
[37:26] let this mind be in you which was also
[37:30] in christ jesus
[37:32] who being in the form of god
[37:34] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[37:37] god now watch this first brother brown
[37:38] talks about
[37:40] more faith this word form immorphy god
[37:43] changing himself from one thing to
[37:45] another to another to another
[37:47] but made of himself no reputation he
[37:49] ain't like our guys today the kingdom
[37:51] bill jesus had no interest in that
[37:54] and he took upon him
[37:58] what
[38:01] the form of a service now we've got two
[38:03] forms
[38:04] you have one man standing here in the
[38:06] form of god
[38:08] and same man standing there in the form
[38:10] of a servant
[38:11] so he immorphed himself or changed his
[38:14] form
[38:16] into
[38:17] this cross right here
[38:19] he crossed himself
[38:22] with man and god
[38:23] y'all got a big cross here usually
[38:25] you've got some in the church you've
[38:26] seen the old rugged cross symbols
[38:29] if if we had one to point to like this
[38:31] let's pretend it's here
[38:34] hey
[38:36] oh that's a good one yeah thank you
[38:37] that's that'll work
[38:39] normally we'd say something like this is
[38:41] the cross that saved me
[38:43] let's close
[38:45] i'm going to do my best to get you so
[38:46] riled up before we even start i don't
[38:48] have to worry about working you up right
[38:49] now
[38:52] that's not the cross that saved me
[38:56] many men died on the cross just like
[38:58] that brother tom
[38:59] matter of fact there were two thieves on
[39:01] either side of him when he died
[39:04] the death of the cross brought forth
[39:06] life
[39:08] but it's not the what
[39:09] it's the who
[39:11] because the real cross that saved me
[39:14] was the cross between god
[39:17] and man
[39:19] indictment message brother brahman says
[39:21] like this
[39:22] who is that hanging on that old rugged
[39:24] cross
[39:25] the prince of life the lord of glory
[39:29] it wasn't just a man hanging there
[39:32] it was almighty god
[39:35] in a form of a god
[39:37] in a form of a servant
[39:39] he crossed himself
[39:41] and that's what saved me
[39:44] let's pray together for the word
[39:46] lord jesus what a privilege it is to
[39:47] stand here in your presence
[39:50] lord we are at ready on the edge of our
[39:52] seat to hear from you
[39:54] our hearts are wide open and we are
[39:56] receptive oh god
[39:59] thank you for this beautiful people
[40:00] tonight lord i love preaching to him so
[40:02] much
[40:03] of all my evangelistical journeys lord i
[40:06] just
[40:07] appreciate the
[40:08] honest spirit that's amongst this little
[40:10] body
[40:12] come in this place tonight lord
[40:14] and minister to all of us be included
[40:17] don't leave a one of us out lord
[40:19] if we need healing give it to us we pray
[40:21] if we need deliverance may you visit us
[40:24] with it whatever we have need of tonight
[40:26] god let that be the thing that you give
[40:28] to us
[40:29] we ask for it as you would bless your
[40:31] word and the speaker and the listener
[40:33] and all of this together in jesus name
[40:36] and the church said amen
[40:38] may be seated may the lord bless you
[40:40] now
[40:42] notice this next part when he says that
[40:44] he took upon him
[40:45] the form of a servant it was made in the
[40:47] likeness of men
[40:49] and being found in fashion as a man
[40:52] everybody say as a man
[40:55] very good
[40:56] he humbled himself and became obedient
[41:00] unto death
[41:02] on even the death of the
[41:05] cross now he's talking about this cross
[41:07] here
[41:07] he became obedient to the death of the
[41:09] cross you know jesus could have chose to
[41:12] die
[41:13] god i should say could have chose for
[41:15] jesus to die in any way
[41:18] it didn't have to be crucifixion he
[41:20] could have let him die in a car accident
[41:22] he could let him be assassinated he
[41:23] could have let
[41:24] any kind of death take place all it
[41:26] would have had to be is for the prophets
[41:28] to prophesy about what kind of end that
[41:31] the son of god would come to
[41:33] but the reason we know that god chose
[41:35] this way
[41:36] is because the old rugged cross will
[41:39] become a symbol of salvation for the
[41:41] entire world thank god it is because
[41:44] this symbol
[41:45] represents everything that we hold dear
[41:48] in christianity but let's not stop there
[41:51] remember the prophet of god said that
[41:53] many men as he said i quoted to you a
[41:55] moment ago he said many men died upon
[41:57] there
[41:58] but how we know that jesus was who he
[42:01] said he was
[42:03] was because after he had died after he
[42:06] had been buried within three days before
[42:08] corruption could touch one holy cell he
[42:11] rose again in the resurrection
[42:14] amen listen i am in the easter seal and
[42:16] in the easter seal messages he says that
[42:19] proved what calvary was all about
[42:22] hallelujah showing that it wasn't just a
[42:25] man being put by corporal punishment
[42:27] this would be the equivalent in their
[42:29] modern time as somebody going to an
[42:31] electric chair or somebody being
[42:33] executed by lethal injection this was
[42:35] capital punishment for the romans and it
[42:37] wasn't the what you see catholics and
[42:40] these people they get so hung up on the
[42:42] what they sell crosses and they you know
[42:44] they put them on the market and they
[42:46] have rummage sales and little crosses
[42:48] every which away and in their mindset
[42:50] that cross that cross this old rugged
[42:53] cross these two pieces of wood
[42:55] represented deliverance and salvation
[42:57] for the entire world but it wasn't those
[43:00] two pieces of wood to save me
[43:03] hallelujah no and it wasn't it wasn't
[43:05] that cross that brought me redemption it
[43:08] was the who that was hanging on that
[43:11] wood hallelujah
[43:12] that brought redemption to you and i it
[43:14] was that cross between god and man
[43:17] all right now i'm about to get in
[43:19] trouble brother tom i love you and i'm
[43:21] about to get in trouble here here we go
[43:23] i'm going to preach a little god head to
[43:24] you tonight all right
[43:26] now we need to talk about jesus who he
[43:28] was
[43:29] first of all let me get this out of your
[43:31] mind because if i start heading the
[43:32] direction i'm heading immediately you
[43:34] might start thinking well two lord i
[43:37] don't believe in a trinity and i don't
[43:38] believe in a trinity
[43:40] all right i don't believe in two gods
[43:43] but there's a thing that we have to
[43:44] understand about the lord jesus in order
[43:46] to get the godhead right
[43:48] because if we don't see the godhead
[43:51] correctly we cannot see ourselves
[43:53] correctly you believe that say amen
[43:56] in order for us to see our
[43:58] correctly we've got to be able to
[44:00] identify this cross
[44:02] because there'll be a part of you that
[44:04] ain't nothing but man nothing but you
[44:07] that that's uh humanity and whatever
[44:09] more soaked in sin and all that but
[44:11] there'll be a part of you that's god and
[44:13] that god part
[44:15] is absolutely not an heir with this
[44:18] human part by no means
[44:20] and what we have to kind of take into
[44:22] our human spirit
[44:24] is that in order for us to receive
[44:26] salvation
[44:27] the only way that we could be saved is
[44:29] when god
[44:31] would then take upon him the form
[44:34] of a servant now we know how this goes
[44:36] when jesus was the birth of the lord
[44:38] jesus was coming it was upon this wise
[44:42] mary being found with child
[44:45] of the holy ghost all right now we're
[44:47] not oneness people we do not believe
[44:49] that the flesh of jesus christ was the
[44:52] holy ghost he was conceived by god god
[44:56] was his father
[44:58] that's your cue to save man god was his
[45:01] mother come on now help me amen and god
[45:03] was the one that brought that body amen
[45:07] into its creative conception of state
[45:09] where mary then brought it to birth
[45:11] somebody said to me one time but brother
[45:13] ben
[45:14] if if mary then by the umbilical cord
[45:17] fed that body that didn't she also
[45:20] contribute her human part into that body
[45:23] i said no i said the fella i was talking
[45:25] to he was a dog raiser and i said when
[45:28] you raise your dogs do you feed them
[45:30] he said of course i do i said right i
[45:33] said but when you feed your dog some
[45:34] kind of a little certain you know
[45:36] conglomeration or whatever you give to
[45:38] them does that turn that dog into a
[45:40] chicken or change it into a rooster or
[45:42] change it into a into a into is it
[45:44] absolutely not i said why because the
[45:47] cells that made it a dog in the
[45:49] beginning
[45:50] all you did was feed those cells
[45:53] amen come on somebody amen so jesus was
[45:56] a created body
[45:58] jesus was not born eternal jesus was not
[46:01] born the holy ghost the holy ghost
[46:04] proceeded from jesus after death burial
[46:08] and resurrection but jesus's flesh was
[46:11] not the eternal spirit god
[46:15] amen i might have to do the amen and two
[46:18] while i'm preaching for a little bit but
[46:19] that's all right i don't mind you
[46:21] listening that's good i want you
[46:22] listening in church now pay attention to
[46:24] this next remark because this is where
[46:25] we have to get it straight
[46:27] many many years ago and i could call
[46:29] some brothers names and you'd know who
[46:30] they are and they preached the two lord
[46:32] and the two god and they got it all
[46:34] mixed up that jesus was no more than
[46:36] just your elder brother that jesus was
[46:39] just you know the son of god but he
[46:41] wasn't god himself now many of these
[46:43] brethren by the time when they first
[46:44] started this back in 1991
[46:47] i had just started on the field myself
[46:50] and i traveled and listened to these
[46:51] brothers preach some of them were close
[46:53] personal friends of mine for many years
[46:56] and one brother started in on this whole
[46:58] thing that you know jesus was not spirit
[47:00] god and jesus was separate from the holy
[47:03] ghost and jesus was this and jesus was
[47:05] that
[47:06] and i called him on the carpet so to
[47:08] speak when he was on the steps of the
[47:09] church i said brother i said please
[47:11] listen to me i said everything you are
[47:14] saying about the lord jesus is absolute
[47:18] correct until you come to that
[47:20] resurrection and when you come to the
[47:22] resurrection if you don't make it body
[47:25] spirit and soul god all the way through
[47:27] it you've got a trinity an idolatry
[47:29] you've got a trinity
[47:31] amen you got two and i said in order for
[47:34] you to get it right you've got to take
[47:36] that body and make it all god after the
[47:38] resurrection i said or you're a heathen
[47:41] plain and simple
[47:42] before the resurrection the son could
[47:44] say the son the body does nothing but
[47:47] what he first sees the father do
[47:50] the things that i do he said is not of
[47:52] me he said but the father that dwelleth
[47:54] in me
[47:56] you can't keep that state the same way
[47:58] after the resurrection
[48:00] because we don't have a son of god
[48:02] sitting up on the throne and the holy
[48:04] ghost running down like a little wild
[48:06] man and
[48:06] dodie old god grandfather up here at the
[48:08] long beard sitting on the throne next to
[48:10] him
[48:11] john when he looked on that
[48:13] holy spirit when jesus ascended back up
[48:16] his body his spirit is so all that he
[48:19] was transformed back into that pillar of
[48:22] fire paul met him on the road to
[48:23] damascus
[48:25] amen when he saw him out there and he
[48:26] called that light lord and that light
[48:28] that recalled lord spoke back brother
[48:30] joe and said i am jesus whom you
[48:33] persecute
[48:34] he put him right back together at the
[48:36] resurrection
[48:37] prior to his death and his burial and
[48:39] resurrection jesus had a time he started
[48:42] amen everybody all right she ain't gonna
[48:43] pass out anybody need a break for a
[48:45] heart pressure or heart blood pressure
[48:46] building amen blood pressure all right
[48:48] are you doing good all right notice
[48:50] before the resurrection he could feel
[48:52] pain
[48:53] he could feel temptation
[48:55] before the resurrection the lord jesus
[48:57] could stand right there and be made fun
[48:59] of and ridicule and his feelings could
[49:00] get hurt he could experience what it
[49:03] meant to feel cold stifling across his
[49:05] body to feel sickness enter into his
[49:07] human temple
[49:09] but after the resurrection they're not a
[49:11] demon or demon power or demon diseased
[49:13] germ that could ever touch him again
[49:15] once he was glorified brother batman
[49:17] said god became god again all of it put
[49:20] together now i know your question you
[49:22] might be thinking to yourself yeah but
[49:24] what about when he sees her sees him in
[49:26] the uh when mary or martha which one was
[49:28] it mary i think met him in the garden
[49:30] one and mary or martha one of them
[49:33] and he says i think it was mary and and
[49:36] he said don't touch me don't touch me
[49:37] yet remember that he said i haven't
[49:39] ascended yet he said but you go tell my
[49:41] disciples i go to your god and i go to
[49:44] my god i go to your father and i go to
[49:48] my father and one fellow said to me now
[49:50] see there two of them speaking
[49:53] i said pardon me i said but your
[49:55] argument is weaker than the broth made
[49:57] from a shadow of a chicken starred half
[49:58] to death
[50:00] i said anybody knows what god means god
[50:03] is an object of worship
[50:05] and jesus the created being had a father
[50:08] that's the mystery of the godhead and
[50:09] how we got saved is that father spirit
[50:12] god created a body that he could cross
[50:15] himself in so he could experience what
[50:17] we experienced humankind
[50:20] it was jesus of worship
[50:24] who do you all think he was praying to
[50:26] when he said father hallowed be thy name
[50:29] he was worshipping god just like you and
[50:31] i worship god
[50:33] praise the lord
[50:35] who was his father almighty god we don't
[50:37] believe we had two fathers now
[50:39] we don't believe he had two fathers
[50:40] remember a spirit cannot die a spirit
[50:43] can't feel pain a spirit cannot feel
[50:46] loss a spirit cannot be overcome with
[50:48] sickness or depression or oppression or
[50:51] fear or nervousness spirit god had no
[50:55] understanding of what it meant for a
[50:57] king to live in this hellhole that we
[50:59] live in
[51:01] so god said i'm going to create a body
[51:02] so i can cross myself with them so i can
[51:05] understand what it is they're going
[51:06] through
[51:07] that ought to make every one of you
[51:08] shout hallelujah and praise the lord
[51:11] right
[51:11] now notice when jesus was then conceived
[51:15] now let me read to you a statement here
[51:16] at the church age but where brother i'm
[51:18] talking about this body he said
[51:20] it could not have been god he said
[51:23] crossing himself i'll just put it in my
[51:24] language here in other words he said it
[51:27] couldn't have been god
[51:29] using her egg he said to cross himself
[51:32] with i'm just paraphrasing to save time
[51:34] i don't want to get too late on us but
[51:36] in other words if it would have been her
[51:38] human ovum
[51:41] that the holy ghost would have taken a
[51:42] seat of life a germ cell or a sperm cell
[51:45] and mixed it with that human ovum
[51:48] that human ovum from mary would have
[51:50] been absolutely sinful mankind producing
[51:54] another body because it would have been
[51:55] a god cell
[51:57] and a fallen hybrid cell
[52:00] crossing itself up together and folks
[52:02] that's what put us here in the first
[52:04] place was crossing them two things up in
[52:06] the beginning
[52:07] amen tree of knowledge of good and evil
[52:09] in anybody
[52:11] that's what brought us here in the first
[52:12] place there's an expression in the world
[52:14] is what brought us to the dance amen you
[52:16] probably heard that one amen that's what
[52:18] got us in this condition in the first
[52:19] place was that god a holy pure
[52:23] cell amen was taken a woman that was
[52:26] created by god as a byproduct and under
[52:29] that holy veil she mixed herself with
[52:31] the serpent that's what put us in that
[52:33] state in the first place
[52:35] amen and the only way that god could
[52:38] have changed that
[52:39] he couldn't have took one cell not one
[52:41] chromosome not one speck of dna from any
[52:44] human being on this planet if you would
[52:46] have done a dna test on jesus christ
[52:49] you would have never found not another
[52:51] living relative on this planet
[52:55] but you would have found a relative if
[52:56] you'd have looked at spirit god
[52:59] because jesus was a direct descendant
[53:01] from almighty god in so much he called
[53:04] himself equal
[53:06] with god
[53:07] god crossing himself taking the form of
[53:09] man and taking the form of god
[53:12] and he crossed them together and that's
[53:14] where jesus comes from
[53:16] now let's let's look at something in the
[53:18] beginning then
[53:20] now when you pick this up
[53:24] and you i'm going to say a couple things
[53:25] here now this may sound a little a
[53:27] little rough but
[53:29] all right
[53:30] talks in condemnation by representation
[53:32] about eve he said eve was the mother of
[53:35] high breeding
[53:38] he said miss the human race when she had
[53:42] this affair with the serpent which was
[53:44] not a serpent the bible said he was most
[53:47] supple of all the beasts of the field
[53:50] he said science now trying to find the
[53:51] bones of some creature between a monkey
[53:54] and a man you see that all the time
[53:55] these gigantic skulls and these jobs and
[53:58] all of these things and they think they
[53:59] found the missing link
[54:02] the bible tells us where that mr link
[54:03] was at
[54:05] he said trying to apply it to the
[54:07] colored race we would say today the
[54:09] black race african-americans he said
[54:11] they're as ignorant as they can be
[54:14] the serpent was
[54:16] a man
[54:18] praise god
[54:20] the blood of an animal won't mix with
[54:23] the blood of a human
[54:25] no sir but this species was so close
[54:29] until he did mix
[54:31] with eve
[54:34] now look at what that low down good for
[54:36] nothing rotten low down devil did
[54:39] he saw an opportunity
[54:41] to enter into the human race
[54:45] he saw this creature that was so close
[54:47] to adam
[54:48] that he looked like perhaps
[54:50] just as much of a man
[54:52] as a man would look like today
[54:55] but brother bradman when you read the
[54:56] serpency message you think yourself
[54:59] he talks a lot about the serpent you
[55:00] think well what was the mystery of the
[55:01] serpency he didn't even get down to the
[55:03] affair and he didn't get down to the sin
[55:05] of it he just kept talking about serpent
[55:08] hello
[55:10] hello
[55:11] that was the key of it
[55:14] that was the guy
[55:15] that caused all the problem in the
[55:17] beginning
[55:18] because he was a vehicle that the devil
[55:21] used to enter into the human race
[55:25] he was smart enough to know the devil
[55:26] was smart enough to be able to look at
[55:28] that woman and how that the rest of
[55:30] creation would bring forth it meant
[55:32] through sex reproduction and all of a
[55:34] sudden a thought hit his mind
[55:37] i wonder if i could get control of this
[55:39] man
[55:41] he tried it one day no doubt brother
[55:43] talked about how satan will enter into
[55:45] animals and things like that i wonder if
[55:47] there was a beast going through the
[55:48] garden of eden and the devil tried to
[55:50] influence and he found out hey
[55:53] i can do something here
[55:57] you know maybe she was going through the
[55:58] garden of eden and saw the serpent going
[56:00] through the field
[56:03] and the devil said let's take a test run
[56:07] yay eve
[56:08] and he hears the serpent repeat it back
[56:10] yay eve and he thought oh
[56:13] we got something here
[56:15] no telling how many moments or years or
[56:17] days or months or centuries or whatever
[56:19] it might have been had passed
[56:21] before satan made his move
[56:24] because remember he told us that the
[56:26] serpent had a place for a soul but he
[56:28] had no soul so satan took his soul you
[56:32] say has a soul thou hast sin thy soul
[56:35] has sinned
[56:37] why are they falling from heaven or
[56:39] lucifer he tells him how his soul had
[56:40] sinned
[56:42] so he took his soul of what he was
[56:44] placed it in that serpent
[56:46] and took possession of that creature
[56:49] once the serpent and eve had crossed
[56:52] their dna
[56:55] naturally it was the serpent seed
[56:57] created
[56:59] but spiritually satan
[57:01] crossed himself into the human race
[57:05] and it produced death every ambulance
[57:07] you ever hear every funeral you ever
[57:08] tend every year somebody sneeze or wipe
[57:10] their nose it was because of that cross
[57:13] right there
[57:15] that god sent the memory in and folk i
[57:17] want to tell you something there is not
[57:19] enough message books there's not enough
[57:20] message churches or message preachers to
[57:23] separate that sin
[57:25] from your dna
[57:28] no matter how long you wear your dress
[57:30] or how much you don't cut your hair
[57:32] sister brother no matter how much you
[57:34] behave yourself and and act like a
[57:36] gentleman
[57:38] as this boy told me today well i'm a
[57:39] good person i said there's what you're
[57:41] failing
[57:43] none of us are good the bible said all
[57:44] have sinned and come short of the glory
[57:46] of god
[57:47] you'll never separate this from your dna
[57:49] it's a part of you
[57:52] now the difference between you and i was
[57:55] are you and jesus i mean to say between
[57:57] me you and jesus i'm trying to say
[58:01] is that jesus was influenced externally
[58:05] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride
[58:07] of life you and i have it internal and
[58:10] external you ever do anything and then
[58:11] say to yourself why in the devil did i
[58:13] do that
[58:17] what did i do that for
[58:19] do you know that they have even proved
[58:21] in science
[58:22] that a little piece of your ancestors no
[58:25] matter how far back it goes every
[58:27] ancestor you've ever had you got a
[58:29] little piece of them inside of you
[58:32] so if your
[58:33] great-great-great-great-grandfather if
[58:35] he was a a flander
[58:39] and and maybe they had a smart like
[58:40] attitude
[58:42] don't let it surprise you too bad when
[58:44] them things just
[58:45] pop out
[58:47] they're hiding in there brother joe
[58:50] they're hiding in there all of that amen
[58:53] is crossed up in your dna somebody say
[58:55] amen
[58:56] that's what put us in this mess in the
[58:58] first place she hybrid us
[59:02] and satan entered into the human race by
[59:05] way
[59:06] of spirit
[59:08] and the evil okay let's look at it
[59:11] now here you have cain and abel standing
[59:12] at the altar right
[59:14] a message called true and false vine 3
[59:16] 11 56
[59:17] the prophet of god said cain and abel
[59:19] came to the altar with the same faith
[59:24] both boys believed god
[59:27] both boys were not communists he said
[59:29] they came as believers
[59:31] swallow that one for a little while
[59:34] that'll tell you why message people need
[59:35] the holy ghost right there
[59:37] you can be a believer all day long but
[59:39] you must be born again you can't just
[59:40] sit in church and pretend this message
[59:42] you've got to have it living inside of
[59:44] your heart by new birth
[59:46] amen help me somebody
[59:50] and the prophet said they build their
[59:51] altars right at the spot in eden where
[59:53] they were kicked out
[59:57] abel is standing at the altar with a
[59:59] dead lamb on his altar
[1:00:01] cain has got the fruits of the garden
[1:00:03] you know the story he's got everything
[1:00:06] decorated standing there you know
[1:00:09] he might have been one of these guys
[1:00:10] yeah
[1:00:11] yeah
[1:00:14] that's the catholics if you don't know
[1:00:15] what i'm talking about
[1:00:17] he might have had incense burning ain't
[1:00:19] no telling it must have been a real sign
[1:00:21] now watch
[1:00:23] whenever god
[1:00:25] looks down now you heard me quote this
[1:00:26] before but when the bible said he had
[1:00:28] respect on the eighth abel's offering
[1:00:31] that means that fire proceeded from god
[1:00:33] and licked up that offering
[1:00:37] and now cain sees god except abel and he
[1:00:40] gets mad
[1:00:43] huh
[1:00:44] mad anger
[1:00:46] where'd that come from
[1:00:49] and now not only is he mad but he's
[1:00:50] jealous
[1:00:52] huh
[1:00:53] i wonder where that come from
[1:00:55] now you're looking at cain from the
[1:00:57] outside probably tall like his daddy
[1:01:00] probably good looking like his daddy
[1:01:03] religious like his daddy
[1:01:07] but now all of a sudden something comes
[1:01:09] out of this boy and watch how god does
[1:01:11] this folks watch
[1:01:13] when god reveals it to abel it is a
[1:01:16] personal revelation to abel
[1:01:19] but when he tells cain how to get right
[1:01:21] he don't reveal it personally to cain he
[1:01:24] says
[1:01:25] do like your brother there and you shall
[1:01:26] be accepted
[1:01:29] that's what god wants to do with you
[1:01:30] tonight he wants to make you a billboard
[1:01:32] he wants to give you such a revelation
[1:01:34] in your heart amen and shake you before
[1:01:36] the world and tell sinners you want to
[1:01:39] get right do like my boy and my girl
[1:01:40] right here
[1:01:42] and you'll get right he never come to
[1:01:44] cain personally
[1:01:46] he said do like your brother he pointed
[1:01:48] to the manifestation of abel's
[1:01:50] revelation
[1:01:52] and said do like him and you'll be all
[1:01:53] right
[1:01:55] goes to prove that only god can reveal
[1:01:57] it to his own
[1:02:01] oh why don't that make you shout louder
[1:02:04] it ought it ought to make you cry and
[1:02:06] scream
[1:02:08] because you know how many tens of
[1:02:09] thousands of people will go on their
[1:02:10] pillow tonight and go to sleep and god
[1:02:12] ain't never talk to them not the way he
[1:02:14] talks to you
[1:02:16] come on somebody help me now
[1:02:19] not the way that he did abel when he
[1:02:20] revealed it when he was sitting back
[1:02:21] here on that pastor no doubt as i heard
[1:02:23] brother teach him one morning how they
[1:02:25] said maybe abel was laying back up
[1:02:27] against the rock
[1:02:30] and he said we'll think maybe he said he
[1:02:32] looked over them sheep and he saw him
[1:02:33] bringing forth in the springtime i've
[1:02:34] never forgot this little example you
[1:02:36] used
[1:02:37] he said he was laying up against that
[1:02:38] rock and he said all of a sudden
[1:02:40] one of them lambs went
[1:02:45] and it struck him
[1:02:47] i bet that's how we got here
[1:02:50] you imagine what the conversation the
[1:02:52] dinner table might have looked like
[1:02:54] adam eve cain and abel
[1:02:58] maybe a little abel
[1:03:00] mama how would get here
[1:03:03] they get past the skies blue after a
[1:03:05] while if you all don't know that just
[1:03:06] hang on it's coming
[1:03:09] why is the sky blue why is it so i
[1:03:12] remember years ago when elizabeth was a
[1:03:14] little girl and the sun was setting and
[1:03:16] she said
[1:03:17] where's the sun going mama where's it
[1:03:19] going we had a friend in australia that
[1:03:21] time and she said going all straight to
[1:03:23] see our friend
[1:03:26] but eventually that little conscious of
[1:03:28] theirs that little god part inside of
[1:03:29] them that sensitivity of that
[1:03:31] holy spirit touch that's birthed in all
[1:03:33] of us starts asking the question how'd i
[1:03:35] get here
[1:03:37] you imagine what it must have been like
[1:03:39] when abel looks at adam and eve and say
[1:03:42] why is my brother so much bigger than me
[1:03:45] remember the prophet of god said that
[1:03:47] serpent was ten foot tall
[1:03:49] where the giants come from y'all
[1:03:52] men of renown
[1:03:54] in the days of genesis the sons of god
[1:03:56] sees the daughters of men and that day
[1:03:58] dwelt giants cain's people
[1:04:02] smart people
[1:04:04] i don't mean just because you're smart
[1:04:05] you're the lineage of cain
[1:04:08] having a good brain doesn't necessarily
[1:04:10] mean that you're influenced by evil
[1:04:11] things
[1:04:13] frankly i wish we'd be baptized a bit
[1:04:15] more a good brain in these days
[1:04:18] i could use a few more doses
[1:04:22] but artificers of brass
[1:04:24] and instruments some of the first people
[1:04:27] to create musical instruments were canes
[1:04:32] now you've got cain looking at abel and
[1:04:34] now he's angry to the point he wants to
[1:04:37] kill his brother does
[1:04:42] somebody please tell me
[1:04:44] where did that murderous ungodly filthy
[1:04:47] spirit
[1:04:49] where did that ever come from in that
[1:04:51] boy
[1:04:54] satan had crossed himself
[1:04:56] into the human race
[1:04:59] and now that sin visits generation after
[1:05:02] generation after generation after
[1:05:03] generation until 6 000 years later we
[1:05:07] become the dumping bucket for all of
[1:05:09] their past sins
[1:05:11] brother if this doesn't reveal to you
[1:05:13] why you need the holy ghost and why you
[1:05:15] need to be born again you're blind as a
[1:05:16] bat
[1:05:18] this is why you'll never overcome on
[1:05:20] your own steam this is why you'll never
[1:05:22] overcome just by memorizing a bunch of
[1:05:24] quotes come on somebody
[1:05:26] this is the reason why you'll never get
[1:05:28] any farther without jesus on the inside
[1:05:30] working to the outside
[1:05:33] because you ain't just fighting you
[1:05:36] you're fighting years of sludge
[1:05:40] years of sin
[1:05:42] years of things like that
[1:05:44] oh you said brother ben do you fight
[1:05:47] listen
[1:05:48] jesus lived 33 and a half years and
[1:05:51] never made a mistake i can't go 33 and a
[1:05:53] half seconds without doing something
[1:05:55] wrong
[1:05:59] why is that
[1:06:00] i'm hanging on a tree
[1:06:02] tonight the tree of knowledge of good
[1:06:05] and evil i'm hanging on that tree and
[1:06:07] every time my heart beats i get a little
[1:06:08] bit closer to its final destination the
[1:06:11] fruit of it is death thereof
[1:06:17] look at how paul described it he said a
[1:06:19] wicked tree jesus even said the same
[1:06:21] word
[1:06:22] emulation wrath strife heresy seditions
[1:06:27] where does all of that come from it
[1:06:29] didn't come from just one man walking in
[1:06:31] the garden called serpent
[1:06:34] it was when the devil crossed himself
[1:06:36] with that serpent
[1:06:38] and then planted all of that right down
[1:06:39] in the womb of eve and then all of this
[1:06:41] on the other side because of the law of
[1:06:42] god
[1:06:44] the soul that sinner shall die
[1:06:48] you can have your token over your kids
[1:06:50] you can have your token of your family
[1:06:52] all that does is you're claiming them
[1:06:54] you're earmarking them for god to do
[1:06:56] something in their lives without that
[1:06:58] token there's not another person that's
[1:06:59] planning to ever pray for
[1:07:02] you're the ones that hold that ear mark
[1:07:03] over their lives that god can deal with
[1:07:05] them
[1:07:07] but if they're not willing to let the
[1:07:08] holy ghost separate from them
[1:07:12] the sin that easily besets them amen
[1:07:15] not all of our our people will be saved
[1:07:18] no
[1:07:19] noah had three sons
[1:07:21] one of them was an absolute devil his
[1:07:23] name was ham
[1:07:26] some people think ham is still the devil
[1:07:28] hope you get that joke anyways we're
[1:07:29] moving on
[1:07:30] [Laughter]
[1:07:35] but when you look at what he was look at
[1:07:37] him
[1:07:39] he's the very reason why we have the
[1:07:41] tower of bible
[1:07:43] ham comes out the very first thing they
[1:07:45] start doing they come out with religion
[1:07:47] because folk satan is a religious
[1:07:49] creature
[1:07:51] satan is not a drunk hanging in an alley
[1:07:54] or a gutter in a bar room the devil
[1:07:56] that's sin sort of that sin but that
[1:07:58] ain't the sin that's going to deceive
[1:08:00] the world
[1:08:01] the world ain't deceived by budweiser
[1:08:04] hello come on talk to me the world ain't
[1:08:06] deceived by marijuana
[1:08:08] i didn't say right then
[1:08:11] the world ain't deceived by none of that
[1:08:12] kind of stuff
[1:08:13] the world is deceived by religion
[1:08:16] all whose names were not wrote on the
[1:08:17] land's book of life they fell down and
[1:08:19] worshiped the beast the false prophet
[1:08:20] and so on so forth they took the mark of
[1:08:22] the beast this is why religion is still
[1:08:25] today the most deadly force
[1:08:28] on the face of this planet
[1:08:30] a preacher and platform can do more
[1:08:32] damage to the souls of mankind
[1:08:35] than all the beer joints in the nation
[1:08:39] because that's the thing that's been
[1:08:41] bred into us see
[1:08:43] religion without the holy ghost
[1:08:47] now you see the way that
[1:08:50] that this goes you see the direction of
[1:08:52] this
[1:08:54] now listen to these words
[1:08:56] now the prophet of god
[1:08:58] thank you jesus
[1:09:00] oh i just i love it don't you
[1:09:03] now the prophet of god said that mary
[1:09:06] then brought this holy child to birth
[1:09:09] now remember the immaculate conception
[1:09:11] says
[1:09:12] that mary was so holy
[1:09:16] that she could give a part of herself
[1:09:19] to the holy ghost to produce the body of
[1:09:21] jesus christ
[1:09:22] with what i just described to you how in
[1:09:24] the world could she have ever crossed
[1:09:26] herself with god
[1:09:28] and produced the holy body of jesus
[1:09:30] christ
[1:09:33] that blood
[1:09:34] was created by god
[1:09:37] right it the blood cells of jesus was
[1:09:40] not brought here by the tree of
[1:09:42] knowledge of good and evil
[1:09:45] you believe that's amen
[1:09:47] right there said that would not have
[1:09:49] produced the last man adam
[1:09:53] god not mary provided that body
[1:09:56] oh but how the devil liked it believe it
[1:09:58] would have been
[1:10:00] you see because satan knew how we got
[1:10:02] here
[1:10:04] he knows what it looks like
[1:10:06] you imagine when mary was brother carol
[1:10:09] you see his example a lot he said you
[1:10:11] know a woman be standing there at the
[1:10:12] stove cooking sausage and smell him she
[1:10:14] has to grab her mouth like in morning
[1:10:16] sickness you know
[1:10:18] and
[1:10:20] maybe she was standing there at the
[1:10:22] stove one morning and all of a sudden
[1:10:23] she turned green as we say
[1:10:26] the devil said
[1:10:27] i've seen that before
[1:10:31] then they go down through a process of
[1:10:33] time or belly of course now i'm
[1:10:34] beginning to swell because the body is
[1:10:36] beginning to grow
[1:10:39] and somebody walks over and says hey
[1:10:42] you you got a child
[1:10:45] satan says yeah seen all that before
[1:10:48] normal
[1:10:49] same as always
[1:10:52] she comes through the process where
[1:10:53] she's getting ready to give birth and
[1:10:55] she hits what they call braxton hicks
[1:10:57] false labor
[1:10:58] her body is preparing itself for the
[1:11:00] deliverance of this child so she's
[1:11:02] standing in the market one day and a
[1:11:04] pain shoots through
[1:11:08] ah get joseph
[1:11:12] i remember the first time that pain hit
[1:11:13] samantha we were standing in a walmart i
[1:11:15] thought she was going to climb the
[1:11:16] shelves
[1:11:18] i'm not laughing at her cause it's funny
[1:11:20] it just
[1:11:21] amen but
[1:11:26] the devil looked down and said
[1:11:28] i've seen that before
[1:11:30] now they're coming to the time of the
[1:11:32] burst he breaks the water
[1:11:34] the blood is coming forth and jesus
[1:11:36] comes forth a crying baby there's a
[1:11:37] placenta
[1:11:39] and there's an umbilical cord did you
[1:11:41] know adam didn't have a belly button
[1:11:45] because adam had no mother
[1:11:47] god was his mother
[1:11:50] he wasn't tied to the earth like you and
[1:11:51] i are our belly button is proof
[1:11:55] that we're connected to that tree of
[1:11:57] knowledge of good and evil
[1:12:00] and when jesus was born and the
[1:12:01] umbilical cord is connected to the
[1:12:03] placenta which is the little center
[1:12:05] where the
[1:12:06] woman uh sends in the new the nutrients
[1:12:09] and so forth for the baby to receive his
[1:12:11] food and things
[1:12:13] and the devil looked said it's got a
[1:12:14] belly button it's got a placenta it's
[1:12:16] got an umbilical cord
[1:12:18] i know it was born off the tree
[1:12:21] of knowledge of good and evil this is
[1:12:22] why matthew 4 he said if
[1:12:24] thou be the son of god
[1:12:27] you wonder how could he have ever
[1:12:28] doubted it
[1:12:30] because when he looked at the natural
[1:12:31] birth it looked exactly like every other
[1:12:33] baby that was born
[1:12:35] oh but nanny nanny devil that was the
[1:12:38] secret
[1:12:40] that was the mystery that was hiding
[1:12:43] underneath this birth
[1:12:45] think of it friends why did isaiah
[1:12:47] prophesy a virgin shall conceive
[1:12:52] watch you have to be a virgin
[1:12:54] because
[1:12:56] the other part was what gave us the
[1:12:57] cross
[1:12:59] that's what crossed us up in the first
[1:13:01] place
[1:13:04] so the only way that jesus could
[1:13:07] uncross us
[1:13:09] was to create another cross
[1:13:11] praise god
[1:13:14] this is why in luke 9 23 jesus said if
[1:13:16] any man will come after me let him deny
[1:13:18] himself
[1:13:20] take up his cross
[1:13:24] and follow me now my cross may not look
[1:13:26] like yours
[1:13:27] your cross may not be like mine and my
[1:13:29] cross may not be like this one or that
[1:13:31] one and vice versa around
[1:13:33] but if i'm going to follow the lord i've
[1:13:35] got to take up my cross
[1:13:38] you see i got my daddy's nose and my
[1:13:39] mama's forehead
[1:13:41] but i've also got their temper i've also
[1:13:44] got their impatience whatever was passed
[1:13:46] to them
[1:13:48] is also passed down to me it was an
[1:13:50] inheritance in the natural birth
[1:13:52] oh jesus
[1:13:55] that tree
[1:13:58] is what put me in this cross in the
[1:13:59] first place
[1:14:03] did you know that brother brown said
[1:14:04] even drinking and gambling
[1:14:07] is a strain in a person's life it's
[1:14:10] passed through families
[1:14:13] down to other people
[1:14:16] i had a man just the other morning in
[1:14:18] indiana had come and he asked for prayer
[1:14:20] and he said brother ben he said i did
[1:14:22] good with alcohol i stayed alcohol free
[1:14:25] i was delivered he said then my wife was
[1:14:27] cooking in the house and had a little
[1:14:28] bottle of wine sitting on the table and
[1:14:30] was cooking with it he said i got that
[1:14:32] bottle and took a sip and i was hooked
[1:14:33] again i said you know why
[1:14:36] i said because that stuff was born in
[1:14:37] your cells
[1:14:41] i want you to listen to me carefully
[1:14:43] when you got saved
[1:14:46] there were certain things that god took
[1:14:47] from you immediately
[1:14:50] you know why i did it
[1:14:52] he did it because he knew you couldn't
[1:14:54] whip it on your own
[1:14:56] but there were also things that were
[1:14:58] left in you
[1:15:00] the bible calls it superfluity if you
[1:15:02] study that it means carryover or residue
[1:15:06] there were things that were left in you
[1:15:11] y'all want an example
[1:15:14] pride
[1:15:16] stubbornness
[1:15:18] it's usually a complex he said that
[1:15:20] causes this i've watched it by
[1:15:21] discernment thousands of those that had
[1:15:23] that complex he said and they inherited
[1:15:25] it from their mother and their father
[1:15:31] so when you were a cigarette sucker
[1:15:35] any suckers in
[1:15:36] here you were an alcoholic or whatever
[1:15:39] you were womanizer manizer that's not
[1:15:42] the right one but you get my boy
[1:15:46] and you come to the altar and you got
[1:15:47] yourself right with god and god just
[1:15:50] took him things from you
[1:15:53] but when you receive the holy ghost
[1:15:56] he could not separate that temper
[1:16:00] from your dna
[1:16:04] you know why he left it there
[1:16:06] if he took the one because he knew you
[1:16:08] couldn't whip it
[1:16:10] then he left the other because he knew
[1:16:11] you could
[1:16:12] [Laughter]
[1:16:15] whoo somebody preached to me
[1:16:19] he left it in you because he knew you
[1:16:22] had the ability to whip it if my temper
[1:16:25] would have never been a thing that i
[1:16:27] could have ever overcome god would have
[1:16:29] fixed me in a way i'd have never had
[1:16:30] another temper again as long as i live
[1:16:34] but the very fact he let that cross
[1:16:36] through me
[1:16:37] is evidence god says
[1:16:39] i know you can whip it don't worry about
[1:16:41] it
[1:16:42] i i know you can overcome it don't worry
[1:16:44] about it
[1:16:46] just keep eating that word just keep
[1:16:48] drinking from the waters of life
[1:16:51] amen my grace will be sufficient for you
[1:16:57] you see friends that this is not i'm not
[1:16:59] against an older call but this is why
[1:17:00] we've got to get in our mind we've got
[1:17:02] to understand coming to an altar and
[1:17:06] beating and screaming and hollering and
[1:17:07] crying
[1:17:09] that's good
[1:17:10] but until you start recognizing the very
[1:17:12] thing that's tormenting you is in this
[1:17:15] dna
[1:17:17] and you're never going to separate it
[1:17:19] the only thing you can do
[1:17:21] is get someone in there that knows how
[1:17:23] to overcome it
[1:17:24] [Music]
[1:17:26] is it any wonder why the bible said
[1:17:28] greater is he that's in me
[1:17:31] than he that's in the world
[1:17:37] the cross
[1:17:39] that's what put me in this condition
[1:17:42] my mother not that one
[1:17:45] but mother eve
[1:17:47] she entered she introduced all kinds of
[1:17:49] things watch now romans chapter 8 verse
[1:17:52] 1. you got your bible turn there with me
[1:17:56] romans 8 1. i'm about to perform a
[1:17:58] miracle tonight i'm getting ready to
[1:18:00] close
[1:18:00] [Music]
[1:18:02] oh god some of y'all holiday man i heard
[1:18:03] it
[1:18:06] no i'm just kidding
[1:18:08] i mean about that part not the closing
[1:18:10] part i am getting very close
[1:18:13] romans chapter 8 verse 1. now notice the
[1:18:16] lead up to this the build up to this
[1:18:18] romans 7
[1:18:19] romans 7 is where paul is speaking about
[1:18:22] the duality of man
[1:18:24] the good i would
[1:18:26] that's the things i don't do
[1:18:28] the things i don't want to do
[1:18:30] that's the things i find myself doing
[1:18:33] now a lot of people put themselves in a
[1:18:35] condition when they read that chapter to
[1:18:37] say well see there ain't nothing i can
[1:18:39] do about it
[1:18:41] the problem with most folks is they
[1:18:42] never read far enough down
[1:18:45] you ever take a medicine
[1:18:47] all of a sudden it does a little
[1:18:48] something to you and you're wondering
[1:18:49] how in the world it happened but the
[1:18:51] problem was you only read that part of
[1:18:52] the bottle you didn't read the rest of
[1:18:54] it
[1:18:55] same thing here you can't read half the
[1:18:57] prescription believe me you got to keep
[1:19:00] going to romans chapter 8 verse 1
[1:19:02] because once you understand
[1:19:04] that in your flesh dwells no good thing
[1:19:08] once you understand that combination
[1:19:10] that mixture that cross
[1:19:13] once you understand that your body
[1:19:16] is going to be that black dog until the
[1:19:19] day it's changed
[1:19:22] and it ain't never going to change no
[1:19:23] matter how much make it live right no
[1:19:25] matter how much you take it to church
[1:19:27] or drag it to a prayer closet make it
[1:19:29] pray
[1:19:30] you can never separate this from dna
[1:19:36] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:19:40] to them which are in christ jesus
[1:19:44] this word condemnation right here you
[1:19:46] know what it means
[1:19:47] it means that the judge has carried out
[1:19:49] his final sentence
[1:19:51] he has swing the gavel
[1:19:53] and he has carried out his final
[1:19:55] sentence
[1:19:56] i learned
[1:19:58] that when a person is justified
[1:20:02] do you know what real justification of
[1:20:04] the law is
[1:20:06] when you're dealing with a dead man
[1:20:10] if he's dead
[1:20:12] you can't hold anything against him
[1:20:15] you can't charge him with anything
[1:20:17] you can't find him with anything
[1:20:20] you can imprison him he's dead that's
[1:20:22] what's called justification of the law
[1:20:24] hallelujah and praise the lord when you
[1:20:27] got the holy ghost
[1:20:29] you became dead in christ
[1:20:33] and there's no charges against you
[1:20:38] oh but you say i still have the holes in
[1:20:39] my ears and the tattoos on my arm but
[1:20:41] there's no condemnation to them which
[1:20:43] are in christ jesus
[1:20:46] i might have been born in this brother
[1:20:48] joe but i am not tied to it
[1:20:52] by the way of my soul
[1:20:55] hallelujah and praise the lord
[1:20:59] who walk not after the flesh
[1:21:02] but after the spirit now see we got real
[1:21:04] revival preaching until we read these
[1:21:05] next parts
[1:21:11] they hear a lot of times people say my
[1:21:13] choice my choice i chose
[1:21:17] let me show you about your
[1:21:20] worthless good-for-nothing choice
[1:21:24] the law of the spirit of life in christ
[1:21:27] jesus hath made me free from the law of
[1:21:29] sin and death
[1:21:30] for what the law could not do and that
[1:21:32] it was weak through the flesh
[1:21:38] so you know how we like to brag around
[1:21:40] this message about what we chose and
[1:21:42] what we didn't choose and what we
[1:21:47] anybody here on sunday say you're going
[1:21:50] to go to mexican and wound up in chinese
[1:21:51] anybody
[1:21:55] let me tell you about your choice
[1:21:57] if you think your choice is what made
[1:21:59] you saved
[1:22:00] what you need to know is that you were
[1:22:02] just anointed or smart enough i don't
[1:22:05] even know the right word for it
[1:22:08] but enough happened where god could jam
[1:22:11] his foot in the door
[1:22:12] and take over and do the rest
[1:22:16] because you're sitting here looking at
[1:22:17] me the same way i'm looking at you
[1:22:19] i tell god i want to serve him today
[1:22:22] something bad comes along and i resign
[1:22:24] from christianity
[1:22:26] come on don't look at me like that
[1:22:27] preach to me
[1:22:29] your choice don't even mean that
[1:22:33] you wake up in the morning you say i'm
[1:22:34] gonna have ham and eggs and now i'm
[1:22:35] gonna have ham and eggs and one on the
[1:22:37] heart isn't getting a biscuit
[1:22:42] at the end of the day brother if you
[1:22:44] think your choosing is so important
[1:22:47] then i want to ask you a question now
[1:22:48] i'm not saying that any important don't
[1:22:49] misunderstand me but if you think it's
[1:22:52] soul prime at the top of the list and it
[1:22:54] must be there i'm going to ask you one
[1:22:56] question why did abraham
[1:22:59] stand before god and hear god say the
[1:23:01] words because i don't trust you and i
[1:23:03] don't trust any other human
[1:23:06] i can swear by no greater so i'm going
[1:23:08] to swear by myself so y'all don't mess
[1:23:10] this up
[1:23:15] because you know why
[1:23:17] you'd say yes to god today and in a
[1:23:20] month from now you're saying no i wish
[1:23:22] that i never said it
[1:23:24] come on somebody be honest with me
[1:23:26] tonight
[1:23:29] our choice yeah
[1:23:31] it's weak
[1:23:33] through the flesh folks
[1:23:34] it's weak
[1:23:36] it's the weakness of the law
[1:23:39] mind you brother david when god visited
[1:23:41] me i had to say yes sure i had to accept
[1:23:44] it right i had to say amen yes lord i
[1:23:47] want it
[1:23:48] thank god
[1:23:50] somehow i hit the sweet spot
[1:23:52] i still really know how to describe the
[1:23:54] thing
[1:23:54] because the more i study this the more i
[1:23:56] think man it is a miracle
[1:23:58] that i even said yes
[1:24:02] oh the halos are a shiner tonight
[1:24:05] for each brother ben
[1:24:07] come on
[1:24:09] it's a miracle
[1:24:11] that i even stopped long enough to say
[1:24:13] oh yes lord here i am
[1:24:18] come on sir
[1:24:22] we got ourselves so pumped up in this
[1:24:24] method
[1:24:25] i made the choice no you didn't
[1:24:30] god chose you
[1:24:32] before the world began
[1:24:34] and if it hadn't been for that choice
[1:24:36] you would have never been able to say
[1:24:37] yes
[1:24:39] the words would have never even come out
[1:24:40] of your mouth
[1:24:42] hallelujah
[1:24:44] the fact that he chose me brother
[1:24:47] was the very reason his anointing could
[1:24:49] fall on me just long enough for
[1:24:51] jam his foot in the door
[1:24:54] don't worry joe i'll take over from here
[1:25:00] the lord jesus
[1:25:02] was a new cross brother ma'am i got
[1:25:04] quotes laying up every time then
[1:25:06] beginning creation of god it was a new
[1:25:07] creation
[1:25:09] listen be careful we're going to go home
[1:25:11] the first creation now if you go to the
[1:25:13] book of peter future home
[1:25:15] the old world
[1:25:16] and the new world right
[1:25:19] the old world was built eve
[1:25:22] all the rest of them was built
[1:25:24] with a weakness in them
[1:25:26] so they could fall
[1:25:29] all of it the tigers the bears the lions
[1:25:32] oh my
[1:25:34] few smiles all right there are some
[1:25:35] wizard of oz watchers in here
[1:25:41] all of that was built so it could fall
[1:25:43] botany life
[1:25:46] trees
[1:25:48] wood fibers anything you want to think
[1:25:50] of it was built so it could fall brother
[1:25:52] john
[1:25:55] eve was predestinated he said listen to
[1:25:57] those words she was predestinated
[1:26:00] so she could fall
[1:26:03] the weakness was already built into them
[1:26:07] oh but i love this makes me want to
[1:26:09] dance
[1:26:11] when god recreated this bride and he
[1:26:14] changed her
[1:26:16] in this new thing where old things pass
[1:26:18] away and all things become new
[1:26:22] i am so born again a god that not even
[1:26:24] god can break the seal over my soul
[1:26:29] because once i am sealed he can't take
[1:26:31] it back
[1:26:34] and us that are virgin born by his holy
[1:26:36] spirit
[1:26:37] even our bodies will be changed
[1:26:40] to not even ever reflect this weakness
[1:26:42] that was built into us
[1:26:45] when brother brown went beyond the
[1:26:46] curtain of time he said then women come
[1:26:48] hugging him he said now look any man a
[1:26:50] woman hugging on him like that's gonna
[1:26:52] have thoughts and think things or
[1:26:53] whatever have a sensations the way he
[1:26:55] put it sure
[1:26:57] because he said there were beautiful
[1:26:58] women hugging him over there
[1:27:00] but you know what the difference was
[1:27:02] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:27:04] had been taken from his body
[1:27:06] he was looking at that old tree sitting
[1:27:08] on the bed next to him
[1:27:10] but he already entered into a new cross
[1:27:14] hallelujah to god and thank you jesus he
[1:27:16] had already entered into a new situation
[1:27:18] and in this new body will be completely
[1:27:21] absolutely separated
[1:27:23] from the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:27:25] evil
[1:27:27] it's a cross
[1:27:30] god crossed himself with mankind
[1:27:33] so what the weakness of the law
[1:27:36] could not do
[1:27:38] because you see you get born again today
[1:27:41] anybody ever felt like giving up
[1:27:44] two eye blinks three head nods three
[1:27:46] hands went up
[1:27:49] ah let's try again let's try i know we
[1:27:51] could do better
[1:27:52] i've got faith you could do better
[1:27:55] anybody ever felt like giving up
[1:28:00] so
[1:28:02] so did god listen to your choice
[1:28:07] that's right brother
[1:28:08] thank you lord
[1:28:13] it goes to prove that my choice only
[1:28:16] aligned momentarily to his will
[1:28:19] and when my choice aligned to his will
[1:28:21] then god was able to
[1:28:23] fire everything he had at me
[1:28:26] if my name was on the lamb's book of
[1:28:28] life if i was a predestinated gene seed
[1:28:30] in his mind if i was a thought before
[1:28:32] the world ever began
[1:28:34] what's the second and all it takes is a
[1:28:37] second
[1:28:38] that my will aligned with
[1:28:40] his he could just launch in you see this
[1:28:44] is where legalist
[1:28:46] if you're of a legalist type nature
[1:28:48] you
[1:28:49] i'm not saying that you shouldn't be
[1:28:52] rules and regulations that's a part of
[1:28:54] service to god too but if you're of a
[1:28:56] legalist nature you need to get this
[1:28:58] thing out of your spirit it's only going
[1:28:59] to harm you walk with god
[1:29:01] because if you ain't careful you're
[1:29:03] going to take the power of who you are
[1:29:05] into your own hands
[1:29:06] and you have no control over who you are
[1:29:09] i am fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:29:12] someone made me
[1:29:15] i didn't make myself
[1:29:20] thank you lord
[1:29:23] it's a cross
[1:29:25] because once he crossed himself with
[1:29:26] mankind
[1:29:28] you see when he goes to the river jordan
[1:29:31] the holy ghost enters into this body
[1:29:33] right without measure you'll never find
[1:29:36] one scripture in the bible anywhere that
[1:29:38] said jesus was full of the holy ghost
[1:29:40] until after he walked out of that river
[1:29:43] then jesus being full of the holy ghost
[1:29:45] to the wilderness be tempted people get
[1:29:47] this wrong on their mind they think
[1:29:49] jesus received the holy ghost sure did
[1:29:52] but he didn't do it as a center that
[1:29:53] needed salvation
[1:29:56] he was a seed paul said not of seeds of
[1:29:59] many but a seed and we all know that a
[1:30:01] seed needs water quickening power
[1:30:06] god was simply quickening
[1:30:10] the messiah sign the messiah seed the
[1:30:13] messiah life
[1:30:15] so he could enter into his ministry
[1:30:18] to be washed killed
[1:30:21] buried
[1:30:23] and to be resurrected
[1:30:25] don't separate god from him
[1:30:29] but you also can't make that body 100
[1:30:32] spirit god
[1:30:34] it was pained
[1:30:36] when they hit him
[1:30:38] when people lied on him and hurt his
[1:30:40] feelings brother joe like it does me
[1:30:43] like it does you
[1:30:46] when that roman soldier walked up there
[1:30:48] and smacked him in the face and ripped
[1:30:50] bits of his beard out
[1:30:52] and they put that bag over his head and
[1:30:53] they hit him and said now prophet tell
[1:30:55] us who prophesied tell us who tell which
[1:30:57] one of us did
[1:31:00] i could only imagine what it might have
[1:31:02] been going through his mind
[1:31:05] but because of his blood and what kind
[1:31:07] of tree he was born off of
[1:31:10] with his hands stretched out in agony
[1:31:13] father forgive him
[1:31:15] they just don't know what they're doing
[1:31:20] i can't do that with this blood
[1:31:23] this blood makes me hate
[1:31:26] listen to me
[1:31:28] this blood makes me have anger
[1:31:31] this blood makes me envious jealous
[1:31:35] but the holy spirit
[1:31:38] inside a man's heart
[1:31:41] changes what tree he's on one more
[1:31:44] scripture be going home
[1:31:46] jesus said
[1:31:48] a good tree
[1:31:50] bringeth forth good fruit
[1:31:52] and an evil tree bringeth forth evil
[1:31:54] fruit happily that
[1:31:57] whatever cross whatever tree you're
[1:31:58] hanging on because see jesus come from
[1:32:00] the tree of life
[1:32:01] he come directly to us theophany that's
[1:32:03] genesis 1 26
[1:32:06] let us make man in our own image
[1:32:08] see that man up there is plural that
[1:32:10] ain't just one man adam
[1:32:12] that's every man every theophany every
[1:32:15] child of god was contained in that
[1:32:17] pillar of fire including jesus
[1:32:21] and we know that because when he's
[1:32:23] standing on earth he said father glorify
[1:32:25] me with the glory we had before the
[1:32:27] world ever began
[1:32:32] when the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:32:35] and the morning starts saying together
[1:32:38] so when he come to this earth
[1:32:40] he remembered
[1:32:43] he had perfect recall of what it was
[1:32:44] like
[1:32:46] but you and i
[1:32:49] [Music]
[1:32:50] up here
[1:32:53] we're so clogged
[1:32:55] i mean
[1:32:56] that we can't hardly remember anything
[1:32:59] but once jesus
[1:33:01] puts a little spiritual drain on those
[1:33:02] lines
[1:33:05] and it burns out some of that old stuff
[1:33:07] things you've been taught things you've
[1:33:09] learned yourself things you read on the
[1:33:10] internet some book or website you got
[1:33:12] into somebody preached something to you
[1:33:16] and all of a sudden the man of god comes
[1:33:18] brings the word of god in such a plain
[1:33:20] way have you ever been in church and all
[1:33:22] of a sudden it's like something goes ah
[1:33:25] i see it
[1:33:27] you got a line clear that's what
[1:33:28] happened
[1:33:30] and all the goodness of god come running
[1:33:32] right into your soul to let you know
[1:33:34] where you come from and who you are
[1:33:37] have you ever seen a preacher get happy
[1:33:39] and shout
[1:33:41] spiritual drano he's claiming he's
[1:33:42] cleaning out all of them clogged
[1:33:44] plumbing hey listen you may think i'm
[1:33:46] saying that i mean that sacrilegious but
[1:33:48] that's a quotation i'm actually quoting
[1:33:50] to you
[1:33:50] brother brahm said the reason we don't
[1:33:52] know who we are he said because
[1:33:54] we're clogged up
[1:33:57] he called it one place spiritual amnesia
[1:34:00] i just don't remember who i am
[1:34:04] but one of these days brother
[1:34:07] that little white button
[1:34:08] that entered into me
[1:34:10] he's gonna grow under my hands growing
[1:34:11] up my feet growing in my mouth my eyes
[1:34:14] growing in my mind and my soul all
[1:34:15] through me
[1:34:16] and one of these days i'm going to be
[1:34:18] standing on this earth and it's going to
[1:34:19] strike me in such a fashion
[1:34:22] i'm a king's son
[1:34:25] can you imagine brother branham that all
[1:34:27] them years seen all the miracles
[1:34:29] traveled all the millions of miles
[1:34:31] only to come to 12
[1:34:33] 12
[1:34:34] 65
[1:34:35] last message he ever preached 12 12
[1:34:38] 65
[1:34:40] and he said i now realize i am no longer
[1:34:42] the son
[1:34:44] of charleston hello branham
[1:34:51] when are we coming there
[1:34:55] that moment going to strike us to
[1:34:57] the son of god i'm a daughter of
[1:35:04] i could ever get my lines unclogged
[1:35:08] maybe i'd see a whole lot more see this
[1:35:09] is why you come to church spiritual
[1:35:11] plumbing
[1:35:13] because sometimes you might be connected
[1:35:14] with the t when you need to be connected
[1:35:16] with a lie
[1:35:18] or sometimes you might be running
[1:35:19] downhill when you should be running
[1:35:20] uphill only you plumbing folk understand
[1:35:22] a word i'm talking about
[1:35:26] in other words everything's all muddied
[1:35:28] up why you were born on the wrong tree
[1:35:31] and you were crossed up
[1:35:33] but remember what saved us wasn't the
[1:35:35] what
[1:35:36] it was the who
[1:35:40] who is he he said the prince of life
[1:35:43] the lord of glory
[1:35:46] i i'm going to spare you the reading of
[1:35:47] it i won't belabor it but up there
[1:35:49] brother brahms i got a statement where
[1:35:50] brother bram said that once you realize
[1:35:52] that you've come through this blood cell
[1:35:54] of christ he called it he said then you
[1:35:55] realize you've got a piece of his dna
[1:35:58] inside of you
[1:36:00] that's not here
[1:36:03] no you ain't got god right now here in
[1:36:04] this flesh no that's that part inside
[1:36:06] that soul
[1:36:08] that's what makes you live right that's
[1:36:09] what makes you want to live right that's
[1:36:11] what makes you crave to read the bible
[1:36:13] and go to church and love people even
[1:36:15] though you've got a right to slap the
[1:36:17] time out of them
[1:36:19] something inside of you says you know
[1:36:20] what i'm going to love you anyways you
[1:36:22] ain't getting me like that
[1:36:25] you ever just get so aggravated just
[1:36:27] like gonna shake somebody
[1:36:28] what's the matter with you
[1:36:32] oh god here come the halos again
[1:36:38] what is it in your heart that makes you
[1:36:40] say lord
[1:36:42] i'm a human being too
[1:36:44] i get upset and angry too
[1:36:46] i forgive them
[1:36:48] what makes you do that
[1:36:50] if you follow the bible
[1:36:51] nothing in the bible ever declares that
[1:36:54] you and your flesh could ever say them
[1:36:56] words
[1:36:58] it's like raising my hand to find
[1:37:00] gravity what makes me defy this
[1:37:04] it's that cross between god and man
[1:37:05] because when god become a man
[1:37:08] he became me
[1:37:10] that i could cross myself with him
[1:37:15] and become him
[1:37:17] this is why i said rise of the son she
[1:37:20] is
[1:37:21] him
[1:37:25] no matter how you see the river jordan
[1:37:27] okay people debate this all the time i
[1:37:29] don't really care it's not
[1:37:31] important
[1:37:32] no matter what the debate of it is at
[1:37:34] the end of the day jesus had to have the
[1:37:37] father enter into his heart at some
[1:37:39] point
[1:37:41] because as a man
[1:37:43] a created man
[1:37:46] without the anointing
[1:37:49] all he could do was quote and debate
[1:37:51] now listen close we're going home
[1:37:53] when he was 12 years old he quoted and
[1:37:55] debated find me one miracle
[1:37:59] finally one dead person he ever raised
[1:38:02] finally one person in scripture during
[1:38:04] that time where jesus ever went in there
[1:38:07] and opened a blinded eye
[1:38:10] all he could do before the anointing
[1:38:11] came was debate quotes
[1:38:16] why people in the condition
[1:38:19] because until that anointing moves under
[1:38:20] that little seed of god
[1:38:23] all they've got is a debate of quotes
[1:38:27] that's why this message is more
[1:38:29] than a debate
[1:38:33] stand with me
[1:38:35] i told you'll be going home give me but
[1:38:37] here we are
[1:38:41] i know because i usually preach along to
[1:38:43] you
[1:38:45] a little different tonight just slowing
[1:38:47] down and talking a little bit this is
[1:38:49] what i felt led to do
[1:38:52] because i feel like in my heart that
[1:38:56] that we really need to understand this
[1:38:58] relationship
[1:39:00] i don't know about you but
[1:39:02] i find that the more i live in this
[1:39:05] whole body right here
[1:39:07] i find that number one the devil i've
[1:39:09] come to realize this he's not really my
[1:39:11] worst
[1:39:13] and i'm not really trying to fight
[1:39:16] against the devil so much
[1:39:19] but it's keeping me in subjection
[1:39:22] to what is true
[1:39:23] what is right the greatest struggle of
[1:39:26] your life
[1:39:27] is going to be bringing this subject to
[1:39:29] the word of god
[1:39:33] again i don't care how you see the river
[1:39:35] jordan
[1:39:36] one thing you've got to take away from
[1:39:37] that is
[1:39:38] jesus was not able to enter into his
[1:39:41] full ministry
[1:39:43] until the anointing came upon that seed
[1:39:45] and activated
[1:39:48] you see when he went into the wilderness
[1:39:49] and come out of there and stepped into
[1:39:51] his ministry
[1:39:52] whatever was laying in those prophecies
[1:39:56] was activated
[1:39:58] when that dove came out of heaven and
[1:40:00] said this is my beloved son
[1:40:02] in whom i well pleased to dwell in
[1:40:05] it activated
[1:40:07] lord of god
[1:40:10] and here you walked on the floor as a
[1:40:11] baby you crawled
[1:40:14] mama said oh it's so beautiful look how
[1:40:17] beautiful
[1:40:18] when you was a little bitty a toddler
[1:40:21] you got little sticky hand prints all
[1:40:22] over everything
[1:40:24] i said oh it's mama's angel
[1:40:27] when you've got a teenager you was in
[1:40:29] trouble
[1:40:31] got in one trouble after another
[1:40:34] oh that boy he's driving me crazy that
[1:40:36] girl i don't know what to do with her
[1:40:39] and all along there was that little
[1:40:40] speck of god hiding in there
[1:40:45] your first cross
[1:40:47] brought you into lying and being
[1:40:49] deceitful and everything else did
[1:40:50] anybody have to teach you how to do it
[1:40:53] no it was automatically in you
[1:40:58] this is why if you've really genuinely
[1:41:00] truly got the holy ghost nobody has to
[1:41:02] teach you how to live right or be a
[1:41:04] christian
[1:41:06] it's automatically in you that's not to
[1:41:08] say we don't need instruction that's not
[1:41:10] not to say that we don't need help in
[1:41:12] figuring things out
[1:41:14] but there should be an automatic
[1:41:17] something that comes out of a believer's
[1:41:18] life
[1:41:20] you may not know how to identify it you
[1:41:21] may not know how to describe it you may
[1:41:23] not know how to put it into words
[1:41:27] but if you've got god in there you ought
[1:41:28] to be able to love and not explain why
[1:41:30] you're even doing it
[1:41:32] if you've got christ in there
[1:41:34] you ought to be able to forgive and not
[1:41:36] even have an explanation for why you can
[1:41:37] do it it's just automatically
[1:41:43] overcoming
[1:41:45] by his cross
[1:41:47] let's pray together
[1:41:49] lord jesus thank you for your word
[1:41:51] tonight
[1:41:52] lord we're so thankful for what you've

[1:41:57] i am so grateful for the old rugged
[1:42:00] cross i'll never stop singing about it
[1:42:03] but lord help us realize
[1:42:06] that lord jesus that's not the real
[1:42:08] cross that saved us
[1:42:11] had not you come and took our stock
[1:42:14] and crossed yourself with mankind
[1:42:16] with humankind
[1:42:18] lord had not you done that we have still
[1:42:20] been sin
[1:42:21] in sin and sinners
[1:42:24] and death is the fruit thereof
[1:42:27] oh god thank you tonight lord
[1:42:32] thank you tonight
[1:42:36] for allowing us to have something that
[1:42:38] will reverse
[1:42:40] this process in our lives

[1:43:14] and lord for the record i'm thankful
[1:43:16] that i don't have to depend upon my
