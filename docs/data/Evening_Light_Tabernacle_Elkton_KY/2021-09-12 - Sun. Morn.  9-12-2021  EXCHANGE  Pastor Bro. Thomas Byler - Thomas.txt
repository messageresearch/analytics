========================================

foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] well so well okay so [Music] [Music] foreign my um uh well so so uh this my brothers and sisters has asked us our please stand breath brad would you open us in prayer please so and my children can be dismissed with something ask us to open our bibles to first john 4. we'll read that whole chapter first john 4. beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and that and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world they are the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them love let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god and this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him we love this god so loved us we ought also to love one another hereby know that we do well in him and he and us because he hath given us his spirit whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he and god aaron is our love made perfect that we might have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world we love him because he has first loved us last one together and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god loveth his brother also brother brian if you return with me to romans the 13th chapter you know that chapter we were reading if you know if you just meditated in that chapter for days on end you would i can only speak for myself you would find a lot of the things that you hold to you probably wouldn't hold to them anymore but uh before i get started uh since the youth anklet is over and we're coming out of the summer i thought i hadn't done this in a while so i the way i do this i do keep some cash uh ready cash because i have to pay some instant bills and i have to give money to people that won't be able to write a check out but so if i were to the total available in the general fund as of this morning including that ready cash is nine thousand four hundred and eleven dollars not talking about since but we have some obligations out of that money where people have put money in their account for like missions and stuff like that cleaning and things like that obligations so when you take those obligations out that leaves right now the balance seven thousand three hundred and eleven dollars so um then we have a building fund that has about three thousand dollars in it that i make the building payment out as of this morning uh i figured principle lies in the church we have on left on the loan 85 668 now the bank my defer with me a few pennies this way or that way but that's what's left to pay on the principal [Music] and as of this morning the two outstanding bills that i have to pay between now and when it gets really cold is uh i have to pay the insurance and i got the insurance bill and it's actually a couple of last year was like thirty nine hundred dollars this year it's actually uh thirty seven hundred dollars and that's everything that's uh the building fire and damage and hail and all that other kind of stuff and plus the liability insurance both on this building the property and the fellowship that's thirty seven hundred dollars for the year and then uh figuring fuel that we used last year i have a balance from the summer you know you prepay for the summer i have a balance of like 246 dollars in the church account i i haven't met i have until the 30th of september to deposit money in that account for them to come by and fill the tanks up now last time i checked we were almost at 80 on the big tank i hadn't checked the little tank in a while um but so we're starting with enough so i'm thinking i'll only have to add about 2 000 to that we should be right where we need to be if we don't have an extremely cold winter but the new boiler seems to be a little more efficient and uh it's not using as much fuel as the previous ones did but because of what we have in the general fund the seven thousand dollars i am not going to pay the i'm not going to pay them all the insurance i'll pay it into installments until the general fund builds up and then i'll probably pay it off i just don't want to pay that kind of money and get low in the general fund so i'll probably pay that in installments and then the fuel i'll probably add some to the fuel account by the end of the month so we have something to start the year with so if you got any questions don't be afraid to come up and ask me um like i said the principal is you know we've gone from our actual matu from when we started the loan we've gone again from two hundred thousand dollars down to eighty five thousand dollars in less than probably 2021 probably 14 probably 16 years the loan went active on me i believe don't hold me to this because it took so long to build a building i think it went active like on 2005 we went from a construction loan to a building loan so that's not really too bad for the amount of money that we had uh invested in it i said if you got any questions don't be afraid to ask me kind of switching here to romans 13. i was thinking this morning you know i know i don't mean to say things a lot the older you get i guess time goes faster i i can only testify to that you know i used to laugh at old men when they told me when i was 20 years old you wait until you get to be 60. i used to you know just like any young man i used to giggle when they told me that but you know as you get older you realize that they weren't lying to you and they were telling you the truth but uh let me turn you to the 13th chapter of romans you know that the world that we live in right now is a crazy place i don't have to tell you that you experience every day when you get out there you don't you don't become them but you have to be around them that's there's a big difference between the two but it's hard not to see the way the world is going and i was thinking this morning i'm gonna read this chapter here but what happened after rome fell in in the third century happened in a certain area which was the mediterranean area the whole world went into darkness after rome fell because there wasn't a central government to maintain the roads and to maintain the things that the romans did so the world went into darkness in a in that area but now we're in 2021 and scripturally it's not just that area the whole world when everything falls is going to go into darkness and it's it's pretty pretty painful for those that are going to be in that darkness with what's happening you know you know it only took a few german tribes to collapse the whole roman empire and we're doing it to ourselves internally so let me read this chapter here it starts starting at this first verse it says let every soul be subject on to the higher powers for there's no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god and whosoever therefore resists the power resists the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation and i was thinking what's going on out there in the world is there pulling people to the left they're pulling them to the right so they don't trust authority anymore they don't have any confidence and authority and the minute you use you know like the brother browner said that you lose confidence in your pastor then you're in a pretty bad place because you don't know if you're being told the truth you know you're in a bad spot well it's the same thing in a national sense if you don't have any confidence in your government and the people that lead you then you don't then it's a bad place to be and it goes on to say for rulers and not a terror to good works but to the evil both thou now not be afraid of power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same so as we start every morning you know brother brown told us the scriptures tell us no matter what the situation out there in the world is it gives me no right to treat people in a bad light or in a bad way you always have to treat people the way you would want to be treated and he goes on for he is the minister of god for to thee for good but if thou do thou which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god or revenge to execute wrath upon them to do with evil wherefore you must need to be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake now you can look at this in two different ways it it does deal with us as christians that we should be in subjection to the holy ghost and into the rule that god puts over us but also in the other sense christians shouldn't be carrying guns and trying to overflow their government also at the same time and it goes on today for this cause pay you tribute also for they are god's ministers attending continually upon this very thing render therefore to their duties tribute to which tribute is due custom to its custom fear with whom fear honor to whom honor oh no man anything but love one another for he that loveth another are fulfilled with law for this thou shalt you know i think i'm not trying to be funny here i think of this scripture right here and and our country right now they're you know that that is is totally opposed to that scripture even even jesus and paul said if you don't work you shouldn't eat you know the whole concept of what we have out there in the world has just gone totally crazy and he goes on to say for this thus will not commit adultery thou shall not kill thou shall not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet if there be any other commandments it is briefly comprehending this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and you know that's a golden rule this morning if you can't love yourself how can you love someone else and the only way you can love yourself and i say this a lot is that you have a relationship with jesus christ if you don't come into a relationship you're going to always question your character you're always going to question what you're doing or what you're not doing and he goes on to say here love worketh no will to his neighbors therefore love is fulfilling the law and and that knowing the time that now is not high time to wake out of sleep for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed you know that kind of speaks to what brother thomas was talking about on wednesday night brother brother luke and all the ministers that you know it's a it's later than we think right now i mean the world and the darkness that out there keeps thinking you have another week or another year but the scripture says something different the night is far spent and the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of the light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering unwantedness not in strife and envy but excuse me but if you but if but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provisions for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof and i was going to jump over here i could read titus 2 but i'll just jump over and sit down in these few scriptures my point being this morning is that the only thing we have confidence in this morning is the word of god if you're trying i know i say that a lot i don't mean to say things a lot but you know uh being in the old soldier i am it's always the fundamentals that people forget and it's the same thing for christians you have to know your fundamentals you have to you have to do your fundamentals every day of your life to be successful if you forget your fundamentals then you're not going to be successful and brother branham gave us those fundamentals the abc's always believe christ read your bible and pray every day those are simple fundamentals that you have to do read your bible a plot you know you can just read it all you want but you have to apply it to your life because god leads you you have to apply it and let me go here and i'll read a few of these scriptures is in my chain reference bible you know years ago the guy i used to drive my guys crazy because that's how the kind of guy i was you know if they weren't doing the fundamentals we stopped everything and they'd say well we're well past that well if you're not dealing with the fundamentals you're not doing the right thing at the right time then all this big stuff you want to do doesn't mean anything you still have to do the same thing every day and read your bible pray and always believe christ and uh some of the scriptures that deal with this are psalms 34 the 14th verse depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it and then it goes to what brother thomas was saying and what the 119th psalm says you know if you're going the wrong direction you got to turn around and go back the other way it's pretty simple and psalm 37 and 3 trust in the lord do good and thou shalt dwell on the land and verily thou shall be fed and luke the 6th chapter and the 35th verse but love ye your enemies and do good and and lend hoping for nothing again for your war shall be great and you shall be the children of of the highest and for for he is kind on to the unthankful and to the evil you know that's sometimes hard for us to fathom you know when we see evil people getting good things i mean it shouldn't bother a christian but sometimes that bothers people when they see evil people good things happening to them but god said right here he sends goodness to the lead and the tariffs at the same time you shouldn't struck we don't meet a struggle over that we just need to do what god tells us to do and then in hebrews the 13th chapter and the 16th verse but do but do good and communicate forget not for which such sacrifice god as well please and then james therefore to him that knoweth to do good and dealth it not to him it is sin and we don't want to be in that place this morning when brother david comes up like i said if you got any questions about the general fund don't be afraid to ask me brother david you love him with all your heart let's stand and sing that more than ever before lord i love you more than ever before i need you this morning is that how you feel in your heart this morning more than ever before lord i love

brother thomas this morning out back and i mean we just i i felt like not only was the weather perfect last week but the ministry of the word was perfect and just enjoyed everyone and our timing the lord and but the luke said he just really enjoyed himself and said the young people really pulled on him and he said he's looking forward to next year so amen and so just just just keep pressing on

says a wonder wonderful change in my life if you say amen to that this morning if you can't see a change i'm i don't i'm going to say that you probably need to go back to the altar again if you can't

praise the lord for that you know i was prepared that maybe had not didn't have enough faith but if something was to go bad or whatever and we was going to start spreading it or something like that we did just shut it down but i'm thankful we didn't have to do anything like that amen so praise the lord all right so praise god so amen i can't think of any another announcement so if you will stand with me we'll just get right into the word of god this morning amen and speak amen that we've all heard before but just what lord laid on my heart to speak and trust that the lord will have his way amen turn your bibles well let's just pray before we open the bible lord jesus we come before you this morning lord jesus knowing lord it's more important to know the author than just the book or just the word father we just ask god this morning that as we open your word did you give us the true revelation of it father we know that it's not just like a newspaper father it takes a special revelation from you lord and we ask god that you'll open the book for us that you'll speak father to our hearts lord that you'll change this lord jesus with the word that we hear and let your presence come in a special way this morning and anoint every both the speaker and every hearer this morning lord we know father that you're the god of the impossible the god of the supernatural lord and also a god of the unordinary sometimes you just do things unexpectedly and lord we just ask lord jesus that you just come and lord just do what you do father and that is just uh heal the sick raise the dead bring back back sliders lord and forgive sins lord jesus and bring joy and happiness to people father and just have your way lord jesus have the preeminence in the services today we ask god that you just be with us now in jesus christ's name amen and amen amen let's turn if you will to matthew 16 amen matthew 16 actually 19 go to 19th chapter matthew 19. amen want to speak on kind of a basic a basic lesson this morning but it's just what i felt like the lord laid on heart to speak on so that's what we'll do amen you never know you know we may have heard something a half a dozen or dozen times but maybe maybe maybe there's somebody that needs it right and so you just never know what the lord will do it's always just to follow the leading of the spirit isn't that right matthew 19 and we'll begin with verse 16. and behold one came and said unto him good master what good things shall i do that i may inherit that i may have eternal life and he said unto him why call us down me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou will enter into life keep the commandments and he said unto him which and jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and i shall love thy neighbor as thyself the young man saith unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what lack i yet amen amen another question we could all ask ourselves amen what do i like lord amen you might not like what he tells you but i think it's a good question amen and jesus said unto the unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell it thou has and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but the young man heard that saying and he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions down in verse bubble picked up maybe 27 a little bit later may god had his blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated brother branham he used this message here when he uh preached on investments amen and he talked about this young businessman and this no doubt but that he had gotten rich this was a rich young ruler and so forth and he was no doubt as the prophet said he was a businessman he was used to making deals used to trading and and so forth and so he knew what it was like to uh you know but he had this thing in his heart to where he realized that all of these things you know they're all temporal the law passed away and he really desired to have one more thing and that is eternal life amen eternal life and so he was you know he was trying to figure out just how he might get it and it was quite something he said what good thing must i do that i may have eternal life and jesus finally you know and it's quite something that jesus went down through this here and i don't think he mentioned all of the ten commandments but he mentions a lot of them and no doubt but jesus knew exactly what to say amen and what kind of a answer to give him and say do this and this and this maybe maybe let's presume maybe this morning that maybe there was a few of them that he uh uh didn't keep but these here that he mentions this young man can say ah you know i kept every one of them you know i kept all of them i've done all of that you know and then then he says you know there's one one more thing all the things of a dot but this one more thing that you like and then he says go and sell all that you have give to the poor amen and i shall have treasure in heaven so jesus was basically making him a deal pack and now he was making a deal and when you think about it you know uh you know it doesn't matter whether it's business how many knows that no matter what avenue or channel that you're talking about whether you're talking about a boss when you're talking about a master when you're talking about a businessman jesus god is the master of it all he's a master businessman he's a master deal maker amen amen and so he says here he knew where his problem was he knew that his the things that he possessed mean meant more to him than uh that than eternal life now let me tell you something this young man he did you know that was not can we say this that was not a good deal that he did this young man was a very he made a very foolish deal very foolish deal to think that his possessions were worth more than eternal life not very smart businessman is he not very smart businessman amen different times talking about amen insurance assurance and selling insurance and different ones you know because people do want an assurance of eternal life it meant this man wanted and he wanted eternal life but you know he was not willing to give what he was supposed to give it was a can we say it was a good deal i don't know about you but i don't care if i would be completely broke i don't care if it costs my farm i don't care if it costs me everything i possess i would gladly say you can have it are you with me this morning you can have it because there is nothing as valuable as what your soul your soul there is nothing of equivalent that's worth as much of what your soul is we sit here folks and we just take so much for granted amen of what we possess the most valuable possession that you and i have is your life it's your soul amen i want to read another one over in matthew 16 now and uh jesus says this this way in uh verse 24 of chapter 16. let's go back to 24 yeah then send jesus unto his disciples he said if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it i want to talk about making trades we'll talk about making trades all right and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it amen for what is it it profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul in other words what kind of deal is if you gain the whole world but you lose your soul oh my we're going to talk about that for a minute the value of our soul the value of our life amen folks i don't care if you flip motorcycles upside down three or four times i don't care if you go to the x games due to all these things if that's what you want to do but one thing you do before that is make sure your soul is secure because uh you know otherwise you are very very very very foolish right because your risk in your very life amen just a temporal life and that temporal life if you haven't surrendered that to god that's all it is you're going to lose even that temporary life but if you are forfeit your temporary life this life that we have god always calls for a sacrifice god is not going to give you something now we know that salvation is free but he still has many requirements that he requires of us if we're going to receive what he's already paid for it don't come cheap it don't come free don't kid yourself it don't oh my folks how many knows how many live long to know that when somebody tells you someone tries to tell you something for free you know i just back away you lying i just don't believe it hardly at all why because oh you can go on this freeze cruise and you can throw in this free desk yeah right you know it ain't free that's gonna cost you but listen and with salvation with christ he already said many places if you're not willing to forsake your own life also then there's not gonna be no deal no deal we wouldn't talk about because the devil made a deal with jesus the devil's made a deal with jesus jesus had to make a deal with it you know whether he had made a deal he didn't he didn't make a deal with him but he was offered a deal by the devil amen so we see this and here he says listen what is it prophet and that's just to sum the whole thing up if the man prospers this rich man if he has everything brother down one place he says you know if jesus come down and he told me look i'm gonna turn you back to a 20 year old man and then you're going to be in the prime of your youth that will make you the king of the whole earth for a ten thousand years i'm quiet because i want that to sink in perfect 20 years old the prime of your life the king of the earth and he says everything go good not like it's gone nowadays we wouldn't want to be the king oh my we'd resign quickly who's going to be the president i wouldn't want to be the president for nothing huh folks i'll tell you what you ought to be happy you have got to deal with all that i pity our congressman don't you i pity all them guys they ain't a terrible body they got terrible jobs amen but listen so you think about this we think about this young man we think about how did he have all these worldly possessions and where is he today [Music] he's somewhere saying boy i was stupid well that was a terrible deal that i made i made many deals that i prospered i got rich i had to build bigger barns i had to do all of that huh so my thought and my my title is this morning is on exchanges exchanges we have to make an exchange how many believes yet you have to make an exchange god wants to make an exchange with you he wants you to candid your old tattered garment am i right and he'll give you a robe of pure white give him a give him a life of serving the devil now how many knows that when it comes to a boss and a master and so forth and amen we know that if you serve god it's one way if you serve the devil he rewards you too but most of the time he'll reward you with be ending up in the gutter somewhere and dying in a gutter somewhere and he'll leave you laying there and laugh at you as you're laying there that's how the devil rewards you amen but god amen he lifts you up out of all of that if any man come after me you know let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me jesus said if a man come after me and hate not his own father mother brother sister he is not what worthy of me unless you're willing to you've heard you've heard the phrase saying that you know what we need to do is to sell out to sell out completely to god you know this morning i'm convinced no doubt when i look at this i look at myself and i look at the congregation here and i see where we're at and i thank god for the for the progress that i've seen here with every individual in here amen that's right because a lot of you you'll call me you'll text me you'll do this out of the other and i can tell by those things of whether or not god is working in your life and which way you're going and whenever i see that people are progressing and getting closer to god i thank god for that if it wasn't for that it'd be real discouraging isn't that right but to see that people are getting closer to god and i mean they're not so much worried about the things of the world they made character is being built to see our character that we're not the characters god forbid that we used to be oh boy i mean as we look back we thought 15 20 years we said my lord i was a character back then hey i'm the first one i was a character you know if i didn't like you i'd invite them double doors to swing open and don't let the door hit you on the way out but i've kind of you know tried to be a little more patient than that with people nowadays realizing maybe sometimes i ought to be doing the walking dead amen but listen folks let me just tell you how many knows that we're saying god help us keep exchanging amen ourselves for him is what we want this man was not very smart he was not very wise god has been making deals with people the whole time he's the best businessman ever was there ain't never nobody better than made a better deal he made cain a good deal oh he made canada look kane just do like your brothers and i'll accept you is that a deal no right and cain because of his jealousy and his hatred didn't want the deal it's hard to imagine scissors that we could be in heaven with cane y'all agreed now we could be in heaven with cain he was made the offer all he had to do was take it but he didn't did it why because he had treated man he wanted to people love their anger they love their jealousy they laugh they hate to turn somebody else they don't want to get rid of it he didn't want to get rid of it he sure wasn't going to repent he didn't want to say i was wrong i know people lots of people go to hell because they never want to say i'm wrong huh never want to confess they're wrong confess their sins cain was one of them that right god made him a deal he says look this is what i'll do this is what i'll do for you jesus make that offer to everybody here look this is what i'll do for you if you come and if you want to die to yourself and deny yourself and come to me i'll accept you amen but you got to deny yourself oh my you think about that this rich young man where is he at today if you look on down through life look at uh judas is that right look at judas what did he do he sold out he made a deal with the devil made a deal with the pharisees look for 30 pieces of silver i'll tr i'll betray i'll tell you where he is give me this money he sold his birth right so to speak for just 30 pieces of silver but said elvis he was born in a pentecostal church he learned some of his shaking a little bit of some of that stuff in church yeah he learned it in church and then he took and sold that out to the devil for a fleet of cadillacs he sold his soul for a fleet of cadillacs and he's dead today where is he at over he under man me and donna we came back from nashville yesterday and there was a sign said something about enjoy the to enjoy the life that you have big sign because there's no here no afterlife i was like going to have the last laugh when they get over they're going to find out there is an afterlife yeah oh my too late to tell me now we've done bad people go over there come back and tell us how it is [Music] we've had people going to the reasons of the loss tell you whatever you do don't go down that way [Music] don't go there it's atheism it's what it is somebody put another sign up further down the road disregard the first sign it's a lie there is a life after death that's right aren't you glad though man if we only had hope in this life we'd be of all people most miserable ain't no way that this great god and what he is and how he has created everything amen that you put it down here like a bunch of dogs and cats and animals without a soul that just died that's all there is to it that's not how it is aren't you glad that the lord saved you that he showed you that oh you know because if it would have been up to them we'd all think that we come from a bunch of monkeys evolution and so forth oh my but people will sell their soul for riches they'll sell their eternal life their very soul that's the most treasured thing that we have is the fact that god chose you to life how many knows i'm just glad that god chose you to live and that's the most valuable valuable possession that you have and sometimes we'll go to a restaurant i'll never forget to go on pizza hut i think it was brother bruce and a pizza hut with brother bruce and he pulled up something out of that cheese and it was a used band-aid that's pretty bad ate it because you know me i just threw that piece out later on i'm lying to you we need to eat no more after that right you knew i wouldn't do that that's right that's it right ain't gonna eat no more that and we'll listen we're so careful about what we feed this body but then we're not so careful about what the devil puts in our head puts in our mind puts in our heart and how we feed on god i only ask you something how many knows come unto me all ye no it's a uh uh talk about let me see here just a minute let me read the scriptures here um hold on a second i'll find it here john six yeah i'm in the wrong book john six we just are so careful i don't know about you but i am i don't like to eat just anything if i can possibly help it and jesus said listen he said in verse 26 of saint john 6 he said jesus answered them and said very very verily i say unto you you seek me not you seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled i mean those are so many people that are just there to get the natural things the natural blessings of god but jesus says labor not for the meat which perishes but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you amen muhammad believes that god has bread for us to eat he has meat for us to eat our spirits now i want to ask you a real stickler of a question how many knows that revelation is the believer's food broadband said pray for revelation more than anything else in the world i mean we'll come to church a pastor will have a revelation he'll have something that he feeds the people and you'll go out and say what wasn't that good i really enjoyed that but they're the last time you enjoy it until you come back next sunday or wednesday huh are you with me my question is when if jesus and we know that god wants to feed us spiritually and that right he wants to feed us spiritually i believe just like i said that the lord talks to us all the time but we don't hear him i believe jesus wants to feed us all the time but we aren't hungry don't raise your hand but in my heart tell me if you don't need a fresh revelation from god if you don't need some fresh meat from god to say the lord spoke with me about this he spoke to me about that or whatever it is that that you need talking to and then he showed me this and i'm feeding on the spirit of food that god has for me remember the spiritual food wasn't just startup it meant to put in a freezer for the same storage it was meant for us to feed on to eat to feed our soul amen how many beliefs we need more of it i believe every one of us could admit i need more of that spiritual food how many needs more of that spiritual food amen we need more spiritual food in due season amen praise the lord you love him this morning all right we're going to take our time this morning i hope that's okay with you amen let's read another one in luke 12. in luke 12 jesus had a couple people come to him and so forth and wanting to want to want to have a mediator for dividing their inheritance so forth in chapter 12 verse 14 and he said unto him man all right first time i heard jesus talk about his man man who made me a judge or a divider over you and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness how many believes that something we got to do here in this layout is the age every one of us you have to be careful of covetousness like i said wednesday there is everything out there all the dainties and the delicious things and all that there is is out there before you know it you can want those things and your soul lusts after those things more than it longs after god gets so busy with covetousness until your your soul amen is skinny no hallelujah no amen no praise no no preach it brother preach it brother luke there's no zeal there anymore folks i try to when i try to when i say it i try to get into the service hey man i don't come here just to spectate and then when he says something worthy we all clap we all ain't been clapping that's a that's a receiving that's the truth brother amen that's right but we guess we could be so we can be have to be careful of covetousness for a man's life consists not in the abundance of things which he possesses your life has got nothing to do with what you have are you with me this morning your life is whether or not it is sealed in god and preserved in god for eternity that's what he came to do remember i came to give my children eternal life and to raise him up at the last day the purpose of christ's coming was that he we might have eternal life how many knows a lot of times we trade the holy ghost we'll trade the holy ghost for a temper we'll trade the holy ghost for gossip we'll trade to go holy ghost because we just simply don't have time to pray too much interest in other things amen exchange it we exchange it ma so now notice does not not of the abundance of things she possesses and he spake a parable unto them saying a certain age was rich if i may re-read this a little bit a certain ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully and he thought within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room where to bestow my fruits and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns i will build greater and there will i bestow all my fruits and all my goods i will say to my soul soul that's much good laid up for many years take that ease and be merry for god's and god said unto him thou fool huh this night thy soul shall be required of thee then who shall those things be which thou has provided so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich towards god therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or for the body of what yes you shall put on now here's the point i want to get to the life is more than meat and the body is more than raiment amen it's not about what you have and it's not about the clothes that you wear but it's what's down in here that's important that's what jesus was saying think about this down here oh my people don't people don't think about it our thinking of of god and all that he is and how that he has created everything and how that the people nowadays are worshiping the creation more than the creator if we aren't careful we will get caught up and we will like what he has made and worship it but put it before god if we aren't careful that right we put we put the things that he has made the things that we have to have before god i don't know about you but i believe he is worthy when we come to church we come here to worship him in spirit and in truth we come to i love him and adore him i thought about that i was singing that song when i was thinking about this this this message of the great greek creator became my savior and all god's fullness dwelleth in him what condensation bringing us redemption amen but the great creator it's that's we're supposed to worship him not his creation look at the world out there i don't believe that the church does i don't believe you do but we still have to be careful they out there they do they actually worship the creation more than the creator gets so caught up in the things of this world all right more than ravens and so he goes on and talks about that listen my how many knows better than he says you know i wouldn't extradite my experience for nothing how many does that feel that way this morning i wouldn't trade my experience with god for nothing we sing that song i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now i gotta make it to heaven somehow now though the devil tempts me tries to turn me around though he's offered everything that's got a name all the wealth i want the world of fame well it may not be all the wealth and worldly fame but he'll offer you something he'll try to get you to take something to stop you on your journey but i wouldn't take nothing from my lord i wouldn't take nothing for my experience folks i remember when i was without god amen and i said god if you'll just save me if you'll just help me lord i'll serve you it doesn't matter my future amen i want it to be completely in your hands because the devil ain't worth serving i don't care how much dope you smoked how high you got how much blood why you drew drink i don't care how much pleasure you had amen it all ended up with zero and all that me meant that you were empty inside an emptiness that i didn't like oh i'm so glad that i was not wasn't made to be empty he wasn't made to be empty he wasn't made to be robbed by the devil there's got to be something more than that amen and then boy i'll tell you what ever since he picked me up he's become my provider he's your provider he's our sustainer if you need deliverance from something he's your deliverer amen if you have a battle amen i'll tell you what he becomes your warrior he fights your battles for you why would you want to exchange that for getting in trouble and the devil not helping you out a bit the devil will take your joy he'll turn it into sorrow and you ask the devil for joy do you think you're going to get any no you're not going to get any oh brother man like he said he said they'll take another drink they'll go get drunk again try to forget the blues and the next time they're twice as miserable as they were before it just adds up and gets worse all the time till they put a gun to their head does he try to talk him out of it no he don't he sits back and says that's what i wanted he's the one that tells him to go do it there's a voice that told me just to go end it that was the devil talking to him that was the bad master talking to him aren't you glad to be a christian or i would rather be a christian than anything i know i'd rather be than the president of the united states or king anything else i would rather be a christian i would rather serve a master that is fair that cuts me a good deal lord trade in your sorrow trade in your depression for joy trade in your sin for forgiveness and grace amen your schmidty sin for holiness and purity you can't beat that how many knows beat serving god you can't beat being a christian i don't care if it gets so bad until you don't know which way to go how to turn and what to do you can fall on your knees and you can maybe not get over and pondered around that but this god will take you through i'm a witness somebody else's witness that god will take you through the devil won't take you through he will end you that's a good place the devil won't take you through he'll end you oh my god might let you get in trouble he does god lets you get into out of trouble many are the afflictions of the righteous but god delivereth them out of some of them thank you he delivers them out of them all oh my praise be to god i'll tell you what serving god is the best deal you'll ever do it's the best deal you ever make trade in your life this is what we like folks this is where some of us especially like that and that is to completely give up yourself notice jesus didn't sell unless you and he didn't say unless you deny something else he said unless you deny yourself because he knew where your biggest enemy is you are your own biggest enemy if you deny yourself god can control you no let me tell you what the devil will offer he'll offer us the same thing he offered christ he made him an offer he made him a deal the devil was a businessman and he made him a deal in matthew 4 took him up into a high mountain that right first he offered him said he tempted him and said if you're if you are make these bread into stones and disown into bread and so on and so on but the last temptation was he took him into a high mountain and he offered him all the kingdoms of the world now i took a prophet to say he offered america he offered russia he offered china yeah north korea he offered every kingdom of every world all the wages he offered him all give you all these kingdoms why do we expect anything good from the devil's kingdoms huh we want to you know what are we expecting no can we say this america in 1956 was no more under the protection of jesus christ we was born a christian nation we fear god and god god will respect anybody any nation that fears him but when you turn from god then the devil has you you can't win no wars everything you do will go wrong all right come on people how many knows you get away from the lord everything goes wrong everything that can't go wrong and goes wrong and you know why it goes wrong because god don't bless sin god don't bless you backslid but became the kingdom of the devil and now look how it is he says now you watch sin go to the core my goodness decor is the president that's the core right he's the leader of it all amen when we have a president that yay we're now a homeless explanation we know it's gotten rotten all the way down ah that's exactly all the way down and now to me it seems like it's going further than the core they don't know where to end it's still going and it's going to keep going until it burns up amen oh my so don't expect anything good out of any country or nation that is run by the devil don't expect anything good from people that are run by the devil amen only amen all right let's talk about a couple more is that all right we had david nathan was doing okay right until nathan wanted to be somebody and he said moses you're not the only holy one around here all right and he wanted to be popular huh he wanted popularity he wanted recognition let me tell you something evening like tabernacle any church any people you have got a problem in your church when there's somebody in that church wants to be a somebody you got a problem you got a serious problem because god don't like it at all huh you don't upset at all is it god or is it the devil it's the devil that makes thomas byler want to think he's anybody or make you want to be anybody or somebody special you ain't nothing special i ain't nothing special outside of the grace of god we're just a sinner saved by grace you're not greater than me i'm not greater than you we're all on the same level are you with me we're brothers and sisters oh my and the prophet of god remember he says don't call me doctor don't call me you don't have to call me reverend or whatever what do you say if you love me call me brother just call me brother oh that's that's humility and to us it was the mightiest prophet ever sent just like brother luke said jesus had more success ten times more success in his ministry than his own he was on the earth his jesus ministry even in acts acts two amen there was a uh what was it three thousand souls in one day thirty 000 in his meetings in one day down in africa where those africans they seen the power of god blind men opened their eyes and and so forth and they would take their idols and throw it down and the dust would come up they'd give their heart to god one of the brothers said no no that's just accepting their healing and so forth that's all it was the brother bam says how many was that for except from the lord jesus christ and they raised their hands one just for healing it was for accepting the lord jesus christ that's what we think there's people here on the message go too far and they made him jesus christ he says i'm coming off the field and you're responsible for every soul that would have come you're gonna pay for if you don't shut that up i am not jesus christ i know it looks a lot like it just like it huh because it was his eyes he was using brother bram says i have to go back and play the tape see what i said to me when i never heard that before i thought for sure he knows everything he said but brother bannon wouldn't even know what he was saying a lot of times god would be using his mouth in that major because whenever he would discern his lady's thoughts and the tongues of her heart and says your address is so-and-so and that her friend afterwards come to her and says that's not your address he was wrong and she says i'm sorry but yeah i moved and that is my new address hello never fall never fails amen let me tell you something to people you know why we're in this darkness let me tell you why we're in this darkness because people traded light for darkness they would rather go in the basement and say no none of that is real the sun ain't really shining jesus isn't making it manifest like that and they meant they traded their own understanding they lead to their own understanding above the vindicated and proven word of god huh people would rather stay with their church and the way that they were taught than the proven word of god in this generation that's why we're in darkness that's why it's as bad as it is because people receive darkness except the darkness rather than light and jesus said they would amen people love darkness more than they love life folks whenever you come in a message you've got to realize one thing that this is this is the word of everything has to line up with this everything i was told that is an amish boy that you gotta wear a hat you gotta wear a black coat you gotta wear a bar drive drive a buggy hey folks let me tell you some folk they all think a lot of them folks that you are english and you are they do not believe you're saved you gotta drive a horse buggy to be saved you gotta wear black clothes to be saved huh i have to forget you've got to forget everything wrong that you understand about the scripture to accept the vindicated truth to receive this well there might be you might think it's a contradiction matthew 28 28 18 says boy into all the world uh baptizing them in the name of the father son of the holy ghost acts 2 says he went out and baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ we might not understand that but a prophet come along and said that is the name of the father son and the holy ghost it's perfect it's just our understanding need to clear up we i like it shake brother tears steve he's uh you know people think he can come shake their hand the preacher's hand join the church and they're saying no that ain't good enough he says by one spirit are we all baptized into one body you come come to church here every day of your life and never fail one bit but that still don't put you in the church of christ only one thing that puts you in god's church and that is the new birth amen you must be foreign again jesus said born of the spirit of god but people will trade it for the slightest little thing can you imagine jesus christ coming and proving himself alive and people will still go say no i don't think it's real people call it telepathy mind reading huh now jesus says whenever i discern your thoughts in terms of the heart you call that be elderly above the devil i'll forgive you for that but when the holy ghost has come and he does it through the church and you call it the devil it won't be forgiving you in this world or the world to come you know people might think we know it was just terrible of the pharisees and the scribes and and those jews for killing jesus the very messiah how could they accept a barabbas when pilate i believe he says you know i'm gonna have to release a prisoner to you which one do you want me to release jesus or somebody else they didn't want to let jesus go they accepted barabbas and said let barabbas go but kill this guy you say well we would never do that the gentile church did just that they did the exact same thing they accepted their own ways the traditions of man they didn't want to let go of their churches how many believes the message of this hour from god is this god has sent a prophet behold i behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord that's our proclamation god said it back then but now we proclaim god has done this god is saying malachi he ascended i will send you lies in the prophet god has been a prophet you hear so much god's in the prophet god said well that's the message of the hour that's what god did and he'll turn the hearts back to the father he'll bring us back to the bible where we ought to be amen how many believes that you know what else is the message for this hour another message to this hour is that you can't stay in them churches anymore brother again there ought to be a whole lot of folks following you this place ought to be full of people that are leaving them to denominational churches because the message is come out of her my people that you partake not of her sins that you receive not of the plagues that god is going to bring down upon him the only way to escape god's wrath is to come out of them churches because now she has absolutely accepted a lie lead to her own understanding over the vindicating word she has swapped traditions for the vindicated proven word god and took plunged the whole human race into darkness amen there's only one thing to do is come out of her do you realize it would read different there's a different place it says i gave her space to repent does it say and she repented no the bible says and she repented not of her sins she is the mother of harlots catholic church is the mother but she has children harlots claim to be married to christ huh christ says it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair let her be covered let her have long hair ah that doesn't matter i can do it anyway let me listen to another man and i'll cut my hair and do all of those things spiritual fornication when you do one thing contrary to what god has said you're committing spiritual fornication folks i didn't have this in the script but is that all right he did amen you love the lord i just thought about that back in the office talking about i was thinking about malachi 4 thinking about you know behold i'll send you elijah the prophet great and dreadful there lord he'll turn the hearts back and then they reject they actually accepted a barabbas except that something that'll take him to death over the word of god oh my quite all age no wonder the tribulation period is setting in no wonder our government is in the condition that it is in because the church is let down the church has opened it up now they're going to have to vote whether they have homosexuals or not they're going to have to decide all these things oh we're way past the women wearing skirts that are way too tight and and wearing pants and and preaching and way past all of that we're all the way up in the homosexuality realm now won't be long they'll probably have to uh you know figure out whether they'll let members that are having a sex change stay in their church huh that's right i haven't with just what i want to say about that yet but it ain't going to be good is it huh you don't know what kind you're of huh our goal my anyway we're getting really down home now is that all right but people absolutely trade their soul for the slightest little thing let's make sure that we don't treat our experience that we don't treat the holy spirit ain't made for an unclean spirit for any reason notice how that jesus was offered all the kingdoms of the world with what with no sacrifice to us you can just stay the way that you are and yet you can be a deacon you can be a preacher you can call yourself a christian but you don't have to get rid of this you don't have to die to yourself you don't have to go to no caliber you don't have to die to yourself that's the offer that the devil makes to everybody huh that you don't have to change he wasn't requiring anything of jesus he didn't want to go to calvary he wanted to make him an offer i'll give them all to you right now all you got to do is worship me huh boy i'll tell you what the devil will offer you the holy ghost he'll on your flesh be a church member go to church do this out of the other but just don't die to yourself stay alive a little bit of yourselves keep doing it your way boy i hope this goes down deep for all of us keep thinking the way you want to think keep living the way you want to live but keep going to evening light tabernacle and i've got you why because when you come to christ you don't get to think the way you want to think you don't get to do the way you want to do act the way you want to do live the way you want to live uh-huh you don't get to when you come to christ now you want to do what he wants you to do you'll want to live the way that he wants you to live how many this morning need an improvement in your life in this area i believe it i believe from the pastor there's no little one from the least to the greatest there's no such but still every one of us i believe needed i know i need it my heart's open this morning lord show me well lord show me what i like yet show me where i'm still living a little bit of my life doing it my way thinking my thoughts and still claiming to be a preacher and a pastor huh it gets hard for me and i believe it needs to get hard for every one of us because we're getting down home close now we're getting close folks and i believe the holy spirit is honing down in our art he's honing right down to where we live he's pointing it right out to us if there's still too much of ourself because he don't want to take that him he's not going to take that up there with him no no no that has to be gone that has to be dealt with down here amen because when we go there we're going to be completely surrendered to christ completely surrendered to christ you love him let's stand
