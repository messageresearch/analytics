Psalms 118. we're going to start at verse 16. the right hand of the Lord is exalted the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly foreign he had not given me over unto death of the Lord this gift of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter the stone which the builders refused is become The Headstone of the corner all right this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it bless be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord Thou Art my God and I will praise thee Thou Art my God and I will exalt thee give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy and Earth forever God bless you may be seated brother Brian brothers and sisters aren't you glad that he did become that Cornerstone that we read in that Psalm if you would turn with me to uh Proverbs the second chapter I told Pete on Friday that he could tell on me but he said he wouldn't do it so you might want to ask him what I'm talking about you know as you get older you can get frustrated real easy you know but you can't hide sometimes you you know that's the thing about being a Christian you know sometimes you make mistakes if you um before I read the second Proverbs I was going to read something out of Timothy the fourth chapter and then jump back into Proverbs you know I've said before I've I mean I've done I've been teaching Sunday school for many years and I know I didn't out of Psalms and Proverbs did the chapter studies but and one of the things I said this is years ago it's just like uh every day you have a proverb or every day or every part of the year you have a gospel that you read a chapter from every day of the year but Proverbs is one of those books if you read a chapter a day and you keep going back you can see the wisdom of 4 000 years ago it's the same wisdom of today and that's the thing about human beings you know our technology might change but like brother random thought in the scriptures teach that nature in man that never changed just the tools that he has at any given time he can do more to himself than he could have done maybe a couple of thousand years ago but I'll just read a few of these verses here in Timothy the second Timothy the fourth chapter and I this is what Paul had to say to Timothy I charged he therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead and disappearing in his kingdom and I know we all looked at that day coming but he tells Timothy here to preach the word the instant in season and out of season so basically he's telling Timothy whether whatever you're doing in season or out of season you need to be the same person you need to be consistent in everything you do and he goes on to reprove rebuke the jar with all long-suffering and Doctrine for the time this is the and this is actually speaking today for the day and you know everyone says well this is the day he was speaking of and I in my heart I might say that but only God knows what day this day is but when you see all the signs around us you know we're getting close to that day and he says and he says for the time of come well they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own love shall Heap to themselves teachers that have engineers and that's where we're at today in the world and in the church World they were in that's they people don't want the truth they want to be told alive so they can live their lives the way they want to live them and it goes on and and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned on the Fables the watch thou and all things and he this is Paul's giving him something letting him know no matter what the world is doing no matter what the church might be doing he's giving him a time to watch all things and endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist and make full proof of thy Ministry and then he goes Paul's talking about what's about to happen to him how he's going to finish the course and you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to be a great man of God but God gives you even as a father or as a mother whatever you do in life he gives you your own Ministry and you got to be faithful and whatever God has put you on this faith of Earth to be what and whether it's just to be a father a worker whatever it is you got to be faithful in that just as much as any man that's standing on this pulpr you still have to be faithful in what God has given you to do and jumping back here to uh Proverbs the second chapter you know these first four chapters and Proverbs there's a I mean there's all the wisdom of God is in this in Proverbs but uh in these uh 22 verses here there's a lot of wisdom too let me read a few of them you know that what in my in my life the way I am if I as I read the scripture as you continually put it before God and before yourself as you read the scripture God will teach you and show you the things in it you've got to read it though you've got to study it though for that to happen and it goes to say my son if thou will receive my words and hide my Commandments with thee and that's not the only time that verse is mentioned in the Bible the verb might come before the noun or it might be changed in a certain way but the truth is still the same it's consistent throughout the Bible and it says so Valentine thy ear unto wisdom and apply thy heart onto understanding so he's telling the people in this proverb that you have to be open both in your heart and in your mind to receive the truth as it's given to you yea if thou crys out the knowledge and lift is up thy voice for understanding have thou seekest her silver and searches for hers hit treasure so the truth of God is like a physical thing it's like gold or silver though it's received in the heart it's a physical thing in your heart that you can receive and he goes on to say I lost my place I hope I don't do that a lot then thou shall understand the fear of the Lord and to find the knowledge of God so the whole thing here Solomon is saying you're not a amoeba as a Christian you have to search that you just don't you just don't exist you have to you have to search for it you got to strive for the truth of God and for your Christian experience and he goes on to say for God giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buffalo drop rightly a buckler or a shield you know that your face you're sealed your trust in the Living God that's the shield that's what actually you hide behind and I just lost my place again he keepeth the paths of judgment he deserves the way of his Saints Thou shalt Thou shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity yay every good path when wisdom enter into thine heart knowledge is Pleasant onto the thy soul and I was just thinking of this word here this morning discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep thee to deliver thee from the way of the evil man and from the man to speak it Forward things and I was just thinking of that that word this morning discretion and I I have a a exhaustive dictionary and it has you know any any noun or verbal noun like this will have numerous different meanings depending on how you use it in language but the synonyms of this word are prudence weariness and circumspection okay forgive my pronunciations this morning but I was just thinking every believer really needs and this day that's the one virtue but one thing that's missing in the world today is discretion the way you interact with people the way you interact with your family whoever discretion and I wrote down some things some thoughts this morning as I was reading that and I was reading this chapter this morning and going back to Timothy you know prudence the one you can't be have discretion biblical discretion you can't possess that virtue if you're a gospel it's impossible you don't have discretion if you're a gospeler and I'm only thinking of myself this morning you you can it's impossible if you're telling everybody everything about everybody there's no way you can have discretion that's impossible and uh the uh and that's and Prudence is would keep you from doing you're prudent with what you know and how you apply the things that you do know and I'm just gonna jump back in my Bible here I hope I have the right spot here I might not have the right Prudence I was just going to read some things about prudence and I might have lost my place I'll just keep with the thought that I have right now but I was also thinking if I wrote some other things part of that is tact you know as a military guy that's one of the virtues they try to be to be tactful in everything you do but basically being tactful is only saying the thing that needs to be said at that time and not all the other garbage and Medusa that you might think you need to say but it's being on point and only saying what needs to be said in a small way at that time that's tactfulness people don't need to hear everything else all they need to hear is a simple point that you're trying to make and the other thing is always weighing your actions and everything that you're gonna do or think about you're going to do you can't have discretion if you're not that way you've got to weigh your actions and see what they're going to bring about basically you got to be the kind of person or believer that thinks before they ask you know there's a lot of people in the grave this morning that didn't think before they acted they just they just went out and did something without having all the facts about what they were doing and don't believe everything people tell you Prudence tact awareness all these things don't believe uh doesn't mean you you don't believe people but you have to prove everything someone tells you or everything you're reading you got to prove it you got to back it up with something more than just what someone's telling you and uh you get the one the hardest thing for a Christian I'll finish with this point that comes out of this proverb I know this is a hard thing for everybody it's it's a it's Human Nature and sometimes you just got to let people have their opinions whether you agree with their opinion or not you just got you just got to let people have their opinion if you talk to someone and you stay on point and are tactful and they don't agree with you and you got to allow them to have their opinion you can't force them to believe like you do or act like you do or maybe do something like you do you sometimes you just you got to be willing to just let go and let people have their own way sometimes if you because you'll wind up in your life fussing with everything you're dealing with if you don't have and I was thinking about that this morning his discretion I that's the one thing people out there in the world should don't have this discretion I mean they they just can't keep their mouth shut they have to say something about everything but God wants prudent people in this bayonets that we live in Brother David amen God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen let's stand if we could this morning and sing that little chorus I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord this morning amen well I was glad when they said unto me oh I was glad when they said unto me well I was glad when they said unto me oh let us go to the house oh they'll be singing in the house [Music] House of the Moon Oh They'll be singing in the house of the Lord let us go to the house uh they'll be preaching this morning where they'll be preaching in the house of the Lord [Music] [Music] I was glad this morning when I was glad when they said unto me oh I

[Music] unto me I was glad when they said unto me oh let us go to the house they matter you're happy this morning to be in the house of the Lord amen and amen you know I I was thinking this morning and I I thought about doing and I thought nah that I won't do that but you know if we turned off all the lights in here this morning and just about everybody has a cell phone don't they who don't have a cell phone other John don't well on on the cell phone everybody's got these and I thought you know if we turn the light off and everybody turn that light on that's what happens all this light that gathers this morning that fire that light becomes bigger and bigger and bigger you know after hearing the message Wednesday night I thought Lord we come to worship you this morning and I began to just feasted on that this week and I thought Lord we don't we don't have a lot of lights and fire and smoke we definitely don't have a professional singer but I said Lord we have your Holy Spirit we have truth this morning and we come to worship you with all of our heart this morning and I pray that's your desire this morning amen you know we sing that little song This Little Light of Mine well we all have a little light but when you put that light together it's a great big light and I prayed this morning that the holy spirit will just come down and so flood I said we don't even know what to say you say really yes sir I I tell you I love to be in his presence so much that all I can do is just sit there and weep and to know that he he just loves me and he squeezing my heart and tells me saying I love you you know and I I just love him this morning and this song that I prayed this morning I thought Lord let these songs let it minister to people's hearts this morning this song we're going to

have this land sold amen we do not have didn't quite get as much as what uh we had hoped for but you normally you probably don't but we still I feel like we did get a good price for it it was around around 6 000 acre I think it is so we got 36 000 and uh Larry the guy over here does the window tinting I mean he kind of fell in love with it and he uh he made an offer and that trustee board and Deacon board we all agreed to go ahead and take that for it amen and so we appreciate the Lord doing for us amen selling for us and we'll be taking care of some of those details in the next week and then we'll let brother Brian get you a balance and all that in a week or two okay amen let's give the Lord a hand say thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord amen [Applause] amen certainly I do know that uh the way that it went a little bit is um he had talked about given as an easement and so when he didn't he gave us a low offer and uh I didn't really want to take that offer so I went and I talked with going to talk to him about the easement you know and I guess him and his dad had gotten together and they were worried about what was going to happen back there so amen and they don't they don't know they said we don't know what's happened but they said they want to take another look at it so they did and they really liked it and he said he was very very serious about this time and of course I seen him driving over several times but uh so I don't think we have to worry if anybody's going to be very careful about what comes there he's going to be more careful not probably even we would have been so amen amen we're just thankful that it's that way amen amen let's pray kind Heavenly Father we come before you Lord Jesus and we just want to thank you Lord for the atmosphere Lord that we feel we feel your presence is here Lord and that's the greatest thing that we can have Lord is for you to be with us Lord even in us to the End of the Age Lord and we thank you for each one that has gathered this morning we thank you for every soul and for every life Lord Jesus that loves you Lord Jesus and gathers in Your Name Lord that little special that was sung we thank you for that Lord for it seemed to lift our spirits up Lord and to glorify you even more and it was just such a blessing Lord father now I ask God that as we go into the word of God as as we have sang Lord and praised you we ask God as we go into the battle that you give us a great Victory Lord this morning Lord we love you and we ask your blessing upon the reading of the word now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen I was listening I was uh I think I was listening and reading uh in second chronicles there where there was a certain group of Israel the Israelites that got in trouble and and they needed a victory and a battle and it said that they went out there and sang and played music and so forth and the Lord really liked it and amen and they got a victory because of it and I believe that was where the prophet of God talked about in the ultimate Testament they used to sing songs before going into battle they kind of typed the church you know here we sing songs before we go into battle amen amen and trust God will give us a victory this morning amen it's after praying diligently and seeking the Lord and just seeing what he want me to have there was a certain thought that I kind of had but uh it just felt like the Lord led me back to something that we spoke on last week and kind of just took that little thought and I feel like he blessed it and so we want to speak on it so if you will we man we'll go to Matthew amen Matthew 6 and we want to read one part of the scripture or we'll read one scripture there and then we'll I'm going to go back to Second Chronicles I've really it just seems like sometimes God will anoint certain books in a special way I don't know if you ever have that happened to you but there'll be a certain certain book or something you just can't get away from it and you're just you got to read it over and again and over again and so forth and that's what's happened with me kind of with second chronicles amen and the prayer of uh Solomon and so forth and then and then also as we touched on last weekend The Lord's Prayer first we want to read the first verse of the Lord's Prayer amen Matthew 6. and verse 9 after this matter therefore pray ye Our Father which art in Heaven halloweth be thy name and the point that I want you to kind of pick up on is Our Father which art in Heaven Again in second chronicles we're going to pick up this in second chronicles and I never realized until I did the study on this of how many times that uh Solomon spoke on under different it was eight different times that at least that I picked up with a short study eight different times that Solomon mentions and says then hear thou from Heaven amen so second chronicles 6 and we'll begin with uh Verse 18 through to 23rd verse but will to but will God in every in very deed dwell with men on Earth behold Heaven and Earth heaven and heavens of Heavens cannot contain thee how much lest this house which I have built have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication O Lord my God to hearken and to decry and the prayer of thy servant prayeth before thee that thine eyes may be opened up Upon This House day and night and upon the place where thou has said that thou would has put thy name there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth Towers this place hearken therefore unto the supplication of thy servant and of thy People Israel which they shall make Towers this place hear thou from thy Dwelling Place amen how many knows where he dwells in heaven in that right in heaven and even from heaven when thou hearest forgive and if any man sin against his neighbor and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear and the oath come before thee uh thine altar in this house then hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servant amen if you'll I just want to read a couple more in verse 25 he says then hear thou from the heavens and forgive the synthetic People Israel verse 27 again then hear thou from Heaven verse 30 then hear thou from Heaven thy Dwelling Place verse 33 then hear thou from the heavens even from thy dwell to have a word of prayer you can't pray too much right anyway Lord Jesus we come before you thanking you Lord Jesus once again to be able to assemble ourselves together Lord and just asking God that your Holy Spirit would once again have the preeminence in our hearts Our Lives Lord and Lord I just feel God that you've got something special for us this morning Lord as you always do we ask God that just just bless every heart the need of every heart Lord now come and hear our prayer Lord Jesus and father come down in this special way as we already sense and already have in our prayers God that you would come Lord and anoint Lord and Let Your Presence be felt here this morning in a special way Lord we ask a blessing upon the reading of the word now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen I got to thinking about that about hearing from Heaven amen praise the Lord how many is that that we have a line we have a phone line so to speak to heaven there's a lot of people in them you know it's it's sad it I really feel bad that there are millions and billions of people out there that pray is that right yeah they're very staunch about their prayers and about about talking to their God isn't that right but a lot of them prayed Allah they pray the different ones and all kinds of different places but I mean there's only one amen that is in heaven that can answer their prayer and if you're asking the wrong person you're not going to get anything but we're trying to be tonight demand to know that when we pray we're praying to the god that is in heaven Our Father which is in heaven this morning amen I just want to title this hearing from heaven hearing from Heaven people who heard from heaven amen what a great thing it is what a great thing it is you know we had we used to work for a man by the name my guess of David Trousdale and he got into this Ham radios and so forth and you know he would tell me about all the different countries and the different languages and all the different things that he would hear and he was fascinated and spent a lot of money on this radio and putting on these antennas out and boy being excited about the next bigger bigger ham radio and this side of the other here and all these things you know you know I thought that must be intriguing Perhaps it is for a person that's into that but I had to think when I was studying on this but how much greater is it to be able to hear from heaven [Music] Amen to be able to touch him because you know a lot of people's prayers I may know a lot of peers prayers perhaps just go as high as the ceiling I mean we don't want our prayers just to hit the ceiling and that's as high it goes because if your prayer if your prayer makes it up there and he hears it something's going to happen I already know something's gonna happen and isn't that what it's all about is having your prayer hurt had to have him to hear you from heaven because if he hears you how many knows we've heard the statement that God will bankrupt Heaven before he doesn't answer your prayer if he hears and acknowledges your prayer amen he'll get all of Heaven behind you behind him and be that and it'll happen that's what it's all about because a lot of a lot of times Sinners and I know what it's like to be a sinner and perhaps praying and praying and praying it just feel like God just doesn't hear you you just don't make it through you just don't get the baptism you're holding up you don't get saved like you want to the people try to pray and pray and pray but let me tell you something when God hears you it's all over it praise be to God why the Glorious thing to have him to hear you amen praise be to God and to hear we talk about the voice of God but we're talking about the voice of God this morning because we know when you hear the voice of God it's important to hear it for you to hear it when he speaks amen amen praise the Lord I'll just take a I want to go down with the Old Testament for a little bit but you know oh you know he's talking about this that when anybody would turn their face to Arts I mean I believe it was probably God that said that even Jonah turned his face that way and he says one more time will I see this Temple and so forth he prayed to God and I don't care if you're in the bottom of the ocean in the belly of the whale when you have the right approach to God God will hear you ain't no matter how far down you are how much down in luck you are I admire you are when God hears you that sit back and see she's gonna spill you out you're gonna accomplish your mission amen no matter how deep insane a person is I don't care if you're married and you're a prostitute I don't care if you had five husbands and you're way down to the mire d if God hears you huh God here's your prayer God hears you you're in for a treat you have all of Heaven that's going to come behind you isn't that right for oh my when you think about what a privileged people we are how many believe that we're a privileged people Hallelujah Lori when we think about that not everybody's privileged to have a Heavenly Father Like You and I even the brother banham says you know the birds when they get up in the morning to have a heavenly father and they sing to the top of their voices and they're always singing and singing and singing hey man he says man he looked down from the trees and they see people walking gloomy and sad and all tore up isn't that right he says they must not have a Heavenly Father like what we do to take care of them he's got an All-Seeing Eye that's watching you [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen praise be to God Amen he'll hear from the heavens of heavens if you'll notice I like this If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked way then will I hear from heaven now this actually goes over into the New Testament already and I want to just cover some of the old but you know that comes up and that matches up with Acts 2 38. how many knows that acts 2 38 whenever Peter was preaching to Israel and it's all looking about how that they have with Wicked hands they can and crucified the Lord of Glory and the Bible says that they were pricked in their hearts and they said man and brother what must we uh and what did Peter say that repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and go hear your prayer for I want you to know you can repent all you want you can do all this down or the other in yourself but until God accepts your repentance until he looks down in your heart and he sees that you really mean that you mean to give you his your life completely funny sees that he'll answer with what how will he answer he will answer you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost probably God said when you are a genuine repentance and it's genuine God is obligated and you ain't gotta wait and carry for a bunch of days and she'll give it to you right there then he'll answer you aren't you glad for that he'll answer your repentance with the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh my God praise be to God oh Hallelujah God is good is it what about Jehoshaphat remember many times and many times in viable times when a king or a leader would humble themselves and say man we can't come against his army they're like the sand of the sea we have no chance against them but God we need your help whenever God answered let me tell you something the whole Army was just crying without them doing anything they killed each other when God answers great things happen when God answers the presence of God comes out when God answers that's what we need amen how many knows we need answered prayers we need God to hear it doesn't do any good if you don't hear doesn't do a bit of good why do you think our prophet and our generation was so close to God hello he says if you'll get the people that believe not even cancer well it's nothing will stand in your way amen nothing will stand in your wait amen and about everything he prayed for God would answer him or tell him no or whatever it is but most of the time it would happen wouldn't it Hallelujah we think about Daniel let's think about Daniel for just a minute how many knows he played a lot he committed himself to God and God heard his prayer when God heard he didn't just send an angel down to protect man you know but God says you know it must have been the pillar of fire that showed up it must have been God that showed up and then scared those lines because they're afraid of fire and they protect Nathaniel the whole night when God answers the enemies are destroyed three more children they trusted in their God they prayed to God they trusted it almighty God and they had communicated God's seen their faith he saw it and he says I'll go down myself until the king said then did we sinned we did we put three men in there I see four men God was so proud of them he answered by coming down himself that's the prophet of God said wormwood a water Angel and all of this wind Angel I'll blow it off I'll water that place down they'll put that seventh fold more fire out in no time I said no no no no no no no no no no just stay your place one more just stay in your place this one that one he says now you said he whipped up a cloud and stepped on the clock Who's down in there drop down and said let's go I did that they were walking around in the fire and today we're probably dancing around all right that's what happens when God comes down you walk around I don't get what it is we have problems in your heart trials and then when you know God is in you can shout and praise God anyway amen as long as he's in the fire when God answers he's in the fire um let me tell you something God is worthy of our praise he's a great God and he should be praised greatly amen Hallelujah I like that don't you Hallelujah whenever what was it Samson one time he had backslid give it away a secret he was in the pit of backsliddenness he was in despair of getting away from God blind jammed his eyes out both of them he couldn't see a thing made him grind at the will to screw up him whooping you keep grinding at the wheel keep grinding at the wheel after the day after the weekend very long time oh my God my long time and then they were having a big Feast they were going to have a big celebration to their God and he heard about it and a little boy took him by his neck and by a leash let him like a dog up there and they were gonna prayed him up there and say look what we did we conquered our enemy the guy that made us look so humiliated and everything is look we're gonna make fun of him today we're gonna have a toast it's not him today you can't make fun of God's people who God is looking down at you don't you do anything against God's people unless you want a real bad things to happen to you nah oh my you let him out there there he was there's Hampton was and they were making fun and drinking they had the biggest party ever saw on God there he was humidity and here I am I'm a wreck I'm terrible but God rejected my hair that was it's time to grow now until all my hands go down he said God just one more time just once more fill me with your power many places that's the way it is with the bride of Jesus Christ sometimes we feel like God just one more time fill me with your power let me feel that only ghost one more time amen that good old-fashioned Revival people used to have let me feel it one more time lord it could happen to us this morning if you'll just believe maybe you'll just ask God to come down he'll come down [Music] oh my and what happened I don't think it was changed I think he felt two pillars he was between two pillars he felt them pillars right must have been just enough room brother man to push [Laughter] them things come down on all the pillars on the whole house that huh I see them fancy dress women and fancy dressed men flinging over the balconies and falling down and the building come crashing down let me die with my enemies but let me feel your power again huh took out more than than he ever did why he'd have never done it if God didn't hear him he just stayed humility humiliated the rest of his days but when God hears God heard from heaven and all the powers amen how many knows it takes Angels it takes a power to make that happen in the other dimension is that right Angels no doubt caught onto them pillars and pushed it huh pushed it over amen why because we know that angels are camped around all over the place I mean they're there to Bible and fight for us to watch out for us amen praise be to God maybe I'll just mention the story y'all remember Elisha right amen Elisha and Elijah amen and syrians come down the Assyrians come up against Israel the prophet went over and told the king of Israel where they were going to camp at and then the Syrian King says you know can't y'all man can't y'all tell us who in our camp is against us we've got to trade her somewhere and his leader said no we don't have a trainer but Elijah I'm telling you he tells the king what you say in your bad Chambers [Applause] Glory he says well what can we do where is he and guess what they found out where he was and they surrounded the city remember they surrounded the city and his servant said man what are we going to do what are we gonna do oh my Elijah said you know just hang in there right opened his eyes and he opened his eyes and there was chariots everywhere and then Elijah prayed and he said you know God blind strike him with blindness is that right and he struck him blind and you talk about I thought back there when I was studying on this you talk about it put a spell on people they they you know he went out there and he says Hey the man that you're looking for I know where he is and uh I'll lead you to him and that whole Army followed the prophet all the way to Samaria and when they got to Samaria the father prayed said now open up his eye open up all of their eyes and they opened open up this realize they're right in the middle of the enemies Camp they had to surrender the server says should I kill them all no he said don't they're your captives put bread and food before him huh but what is the point to point is remember he opened his eyes to see over into that dimension how many knows there's seven dimensions brother bam taught us there's seven different dimensions three of them is uh time matter and space I believe it is which what we live in the fourth is of course the uh radio and television they've proven through science it's all of that is going through here they're right then they also said that even cancer was a fourth dimensional disease even demons there in that fourth dimension demons and so forth that fourth dimension what a terrible thing and then The Fifth Dimension is a region of the loss a place that you go to by the band said and I've got it here he says you know it's a place of the Lord I mean it's like a nightmare you can't go to heaven and you can't come back you're just stuck there huh sixth dimensional bam he says that's where I've seen when I went to a division sixth Dimension is saved but the Sabbath is the heavens of the Hills see when God answers he answers you from that dementia oh mine how many knows each and every one of us is either influenced by that demonic Dimension or influenced and inspired this morning by that higher Dimension the seventh Dimension the Mansion of God praise be to God we're drawing our strength from one of those amen I thought you know it's so important foreign it's so important that we have an atmosphere and a home the reason kids don't turn out right is because parents haven't drawn enough of that atmosphere down in their own remember this your kids growing up they need to have an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost how do you expect them ever to turn out if they aren't under the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit amen man and that comes through prayer that comes through Dedication that every parent has to ask themselves what kind of atmosphere am I creating in my home amen what kind of children are are my children going to turn out to be they should be able to say Daddy I want what you have mommy you're gonna say Mommy I want what you have I want the joy that you have you got fighting and bickering and I ever have no peace and they're all kind of Chaos in your house huh they would want to live in that kind of Dimension they'll know or in that kind of atmosphere Lord help us this morning you pull from that out of their atmosphere that's why I may believe that even when we come to church we come to church early to pray to create that atmosphere to pull God down hallelujah amen oh you love that or what many different things you think about the power the power we're talking about the power of Heaven and the power of hell we know that but Abraham said that there's right now the lid has come off of hell Friday how did the lid come off of help with a song one little song way back and I don't know even what 20 maybe they got a sexy song about roll them up little girls or something about their I don't know their stockings and stuff you know it has to do with something about the girl's legs huh he says and they used to censor things they let that slip through boys along we had an Elvis Presley and everybody else hello and all these Psalms brought in all of this thing that let it out let it out kind of denoma look at where we are today can you imagine going to a school nowadays is that a girl or is that a boy is that a girl or is that a boy they all look kind of alike I guess they want them all to be girls I don't know uh I hate to say it and you shouldn't pick on people but even if there was a boy in our school a lot of times he'd get picked out as being a little you're scrawny little huh brother was kind of that way and he always have his mouth bashed because he wasn't no says he let him nine no but we don't do that isn't that right but still trying to teach him not to be a girl be a man amen my my mind now look at where we are successful the very Cesspool of sin where he says full of hell has belched out it opened itself up demons flying everywhere brother man said he got into the pulpits got into the people Don't Preach nothing anymore they got a deacon board and a trustee board that if they don't say something they don't like audios you gotta really watch what he says well I'm sure glad it's not that this way that this way this way here that way here amen you're worried about what I said right I'd be uh gone a long time ago you love the Lord but how many knows for all the gates of hell have opened up the windows of Heaven have opened up that has poured itself out today don't read the word of God that to know who you are where you come from who your dad is what genetics you're off to tell you who you were from what your genetics is and if you're not in Sea Gene of God amen never will be you got to be a seed Gene of God praise be to God amen listen we think of all these things all these Old Testament people who call God down hello God did these marvelous things for him but one thing he could never do was what he could never become one with him he could give him the baptism he could give him a a you know like Samson and different ones he could give him the measure of the Holy Spirit to do things and so forth but you could never change their nature he could never dwell there because it was unfit place this is what the prophet of God said listen when God came down in the form of a dove and lit upon the lamb and Abode on the lamb and never did leave the lamb for they were one that was one of the greatest events that the world has ever had ah just look at that for a minute but how did the heavens and earth Embrace each other now we've got the heavens of Heavens coming down and embracing the Earth the great God that was in Heaven is now come down in the human flesh Embrace each other heavens and earth embracing each other greatest thing ever happened amen how did God and man became reconciled to get together amen praise be to God so heavens and earth when he came Embrace each other and how many knows that when you receive is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is God coming down and embracing you just like David said Embrace him he's embracing you and there's very few things in this world that's better than the good embrace huh a good embrace it shows love there's no animosity there's just pure love there a real good hug a real Embrace let me tell you something to me there's nothing that ever has happened in my life better than when God come into my heart and embrace me Heaven and Earth Embrace each other God in my eye became one praise be to God Hallelujah how many knows God uses the fivefold ministry now to speak to you can use my voice this morning and say something that you would have never expected me to say you didn't see it coming but yet it spoke right to your heart huh God speaks through the FireFold Ministry let me tell you he don't just speak to them but he speaks to every born again son and daughter of God you now have the voice of God said the bride is the final voice to the final age God's Prophet was here in his word was the say of the Lord he had the voice of God amen praise be to God let's talk about another portion of Heaven something else in heaven Amen in order for you to actually hear the voice of God because even Jesus said blessed are you your ears that can hear isn't that right not everybody can hear Jesus how many knows when Jesus was on Earth he was the voice of God every word to come out of his mouth was the voice of God it was God's voice everything he said was God speaking amen and describes the Pharisees take couldn't receive it they didn't receive it They didn't accept it they refused it they said this beelzibar a fortune teller but he came to a woman at the well isn't that right and she had had five husbands and yet whenever he began to give her the water that he was talking about he said the water did I give you if I give you this water it'll be last everlasting life springing up into everlasting life she says she didn't say well you must be a fortune teller no she said give me this water everybody Sons and Daughters of God said give me this water they hear the voice of God amen now listen so he says look at this little woman she had fallen from God's thought she could be redeemed she was a subject she had representation in heaven amen what a difference between her and those preachers oh my she said she could teach Birmingham something she could teach the rest of the world something yes sir she could teach the Theological Seminary something that he's the same yesterday today and forever Christ could come and did come and did the very same things to our prophet yes is that right very same things how many knows that a prophet is a seer he sees God's will he sees God's plan he can do whatever God wants him to do and that's why when we lost love to God as he Prophet on that measure we lost a great thing there's a lot of people that wants to be a prophet and this that or the other but that don't make him a prophet ah whenever I see people trying to do that I realize that's counterfeit that ain't right I don't say that there's my prophets hello there can be Minor Prophets but if you are a minor Prophet believe me you'll be you'll be what God made you it won't be no gimmick or put on it'll be real amen but he could see he could he had he had so many Visions he could see God's will so much until he had the time to go out in the mountains sometimes and get away from some of the visions and so forth is that what he did buddies if you remember he got that says well because God show you Visions like that out here now forget just what it was but it uh but a brother he told him what he was there for you know his mom and everything about him and so forth told all him about why this was on his heart he was shocked he says he does see Visions he was just that tuned with God until he could see visions he could tell things foretell things aren't we privileged today to know that very God that was back there that was in the heavens of Heaven says come now and become man come into human beings hey man aren't you thankful for that when I think about uh you know you know Acts 2 38 you know repenting and so forth in the book of Acts listen I just want to go to this but before I do let me finish this about representation how many knows that this representation brother random later on talked about how that the representation of predestination and he talked about that being our theophany hello huh can I have something up there to represent you now I've got a scripture quote here where he talks about them whenever you heard the word and whenever you receive the word of God he said you heard from your theophany all right another place he says you know the check yes sir she would kind of thirst you have amen do you want to be better do you wanna you wanna be perfect do you search for perfection or do you not care about how you are check your desires it'll tell you where you're from either from above or From Below either you got a theophany that you're Desiring to have and to put on because he mentions that about representation he says if we have this Earthly body be dissolved we have one already waiting a theology body over in heaven that's calling us drawing us [Music] here's a good one does in little imperfections that you got in your life that you still hate so bad you don't have to raise your hand but most of us probably still have them if we're still in the flesh we still have those little imperfections those little places those maybe just not as diligent as what we should be it could be a sinful habit it could be something this Saturday or whatever it is and you just that you you know if you if it doesn't bother you you could be in trouble huh if you have a lot of faults you do things wrong and you just want to blame somebody else then blame somebody else no they did it you're trying to justify yourself you never want to look at yourself real hard and say look how I really am no that's me I need to repent I need to get right because I want you to know when you hear from your theophany when you hear God's voice in your heart the first thing you say is God I'm so sorry Lord forgive me of my sins remember my failures I'm not by the other people that's what they'll tell you are you with me this morning that's when you're really here from heaven and I believe we as Christians everybody listen this morning we as Christians this morning amen if I thirst in our hunger is to get more like Christ be granted Christians than what we are you're going the right way because I'm not up here to testify your sin and make it easy for you to sin and all of that stuff nah we're not going that way say Lord I believe I read it in one of the Psalms David says you know creating me a clean heart of God see if there be any wicked way in me Lord if this take it out Lord amen search my heart oh God Lord help us amen your theophany from Heaven calling you isn't that awesome amen your theophany calling you praise be to God what was the greatest day the greatest day was when God and man became one now how many notes that did not happen when Jesus was on Earth that was not happened when Jesus won Earth because the Holy Ghost wasn't come yet he was with God was with man but he wanted something more than that didn't he Acts 2 says when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place amen let me let me back up let's go to chapter one and being assembled together verse 4 with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which he has uh which he saith you have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence and we're there when they therefore will come together to ask of him saying Lord with that this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the season which the father hath put in his own power amen but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you why do you think that Peter was not able he didn't have the capability to confess these and say yes I am one of them he was scared to death that he was going to die and he wasn't ready to die in a sinful State hello you see he wasn't willing to die he wouldn't want to give it they won't didn't want to he didn't want them to catch him so he lied but afterwards he said what don't crucify me like him crucify me upside down I'm not worthy to be crucified upright like he was amen Peter might have been a little bit rambunctious but I want to shake his hand when we get there whatever he did he wanted to do 150 percent yeah we have to say that about him but he was gonna do you know amen and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samara and then to the other most parts of the Earth this is when God and man became one suddenly it there came a sound from heaven Glory how many knows you come all the way all the way from Glory Jesus had to go back and forth to the form of the Holy Ghost and when he come back it's come like a rushing Mighty Wind oh my sound from Heaven of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were City I don't know about you but I'd love to have that happen again wouldn't you wouldn't it be nice if this morning we just have a variety rushing Wind come down amen amen he he would if we really desire it amen really desire filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each one of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance pray ERS be to God aren't you glad for that that's when God come down amenity became one with almighty God after that Peter could go out and say nice silver and gold don't I have any up but just as I have I give unto you rise up in the name of Jesus Christ and walk and people are people from I understand we just want to get into the shadow of Peter and get healed just a shadow can you imagine walking out in the parking lot Peter preaching out here and going out and parking lot the Sun's shining a certain way Amen in some somebody sick person that he couldn't get didn't get here in time or something and Peter just get in this Shadow just get in the shadow about it rise up and jump and scream I'm Healed you talk about God and man becoming one now the voice of God isn't just coming from Heaven not the voice of God is in where you and me I mean it believes you have the voice of God amen what a responsibility that puts upon us let me get down to where we live how many thankful that every day you can hear that voice you can hear the voice from Heaven you can have an answer come from God speak to him daily every day not just once in a while but every day you can hear God's voice I don't know about you but I do he speaks to me amen I trust he does to you if you'll listen I'm he's with me tonight you're with me you'll realize that if you'll listen real hard he talks to you Doug talks to me all the time aren't you glad that you can hear from heaven then will I hear from heaven every time you see your prayer and today and that's my God thank you come on people you really have this God I'm talking about the same yesterday today and forever it does something to you make you appreciate and be thankful to almighty God that we can hear from heaven and whatever we ask in his name he will are you there if you had the faith of the grain of a mustard seed you say to this tree be plucked into the ocean we planted up whatsoever think you lie When you pray you believe it and you shall have it [Music] he'll hear he promised to hear our prayers amen if you'll believe with all your heart and you ain't got no clogs huh you ain't got no clogs stopping the uh the prayers from going up amen oh my Lord help us how many needs to get the clothes out this morning Lord take the clogs out anything that disrupts my communication with you Lord take it away amen I want to hear from almighty God I want to hear from heaven what a privilege it is to talk to the one that created the heavens and the Earth and all the things that are in it and everything are there but not anything created that he did not create that's who you're talking about the mighty creator no greater privilege I no greater honor let me say this no greater feeling amen than to have fellowship with our heavenly father Hallelujah we're taught that you know man he's always waiting for God for what he did and for what he will do and some sometimes ignoring what he is doing but this morning we're talking about and praising God for what he did do and for what he is doing amen and for what he will do praise be to God how many knows that whenever the Seven Angels Came Down in Arizona brother bam says it was a huge loud thunder clap like you had never heard and he makes mention it a little later on talking about how that anything that fast any Angels traveling that far from eternity in a split in a in a thought would cause a big crack just like the pain of a sound barrier whatever he mentioned it and I was like that must be what he's talking about that challenges come from eternity in a split second boom the Rocks fell out of the mountains and everywhere everybody was ducking and getting under trucks and everything else huh and what did that voice say to brother about him he says go back to Jeffersonville because the seven uh seals are going to be opened at this time I mean believe we heard a voice from heaven I heard heard of Oz and it sounded like a scriptural voice to me amen as the Young's brother I believe it sayings when he came Seven Angels Came Down isn't that right when they went back up they formed the Hoffman's head of Christ amen so high scientists didn't know what it was nobody knew what it was but we know what it is they might deny it how many believes this will be played back on the day of judgment yeah that was me y'all that was me coming opening up the revelation of the Seven Seals and we heard a voice oh from heaven praise the lord we heard Revelations 18. after these things I saw a mighty Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is filed on this Fallen and become the habitation of devils and the hope of every foul Spirit what is Babylon confusion what is confusion 900 different churches is confusion and that Babylon fell God was not in it anymore but it became the habitation of devils amen and I dare say it the way the reason that America is in the condition that it is in is because the preachers rejected Christ the preachers the churches rejected Christ the parents rejected Christ when you reject Christ there's nothing left but chaos it let every evil thing because that's what held that's what was conservative anyway do you see that in the news the other day that uh conservative young people were reading the Bible and those leftists came and ripped at all the shreds and destroyed it and ate their pages and everything else that's How brave the devil is getting amen we're getting very bold very very vocal amen and that's what he's gotten do amen every foul spirit in the cage of every unclean hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are wax switched through the abundance of her Delicacies and I Heard a Voice so yeah sounded like a scriptural voice to me I heard another voice from him saying come here my people oh my God come on come on her y'all remember that he screwed and how many has come out aren't you glad you came out you heard that voice come out of her let me just stop there for a minute there was a minute there was a long time where Brother Band would say now you go find your good church we got a
