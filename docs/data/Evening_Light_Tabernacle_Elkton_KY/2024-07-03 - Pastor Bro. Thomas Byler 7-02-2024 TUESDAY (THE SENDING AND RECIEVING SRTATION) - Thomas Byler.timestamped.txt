[35:45] minister according to your word father
[35:48] keep ourselves out of it Lord Jesus and
[35:51] let it all be your spirit that we do it
[35:53] by we ask these blessings and favors in
[35:55] jesus' name amen amen and amen I want to
[36:00] Res I want to title this the sending and
[36:04] receiving station amen the sending
[36:07] station and the receiving station amen I
[36:12] was originally going to uh title it
[36:15] orders from headquarters amen I decided
[36:19] to go with something a little different
[36:20] amen so amen this is uh we'll just see
[36:25] what the Lord will have because I you
[36:27] know when you sometimes when you get
[36:28] into this and you think about this and
[36:30] you study and you realize how basically
[36:34] a lot of times I feel anyway scattered
[36:37] amen a little bit scattered so I mean if
[36:40] I'm a little scattered I just pray God
[36:41] will bring it together amen ain't that
[36:44] right
[36:45] because uh I was I was thinking studying
[36:50] and praying and been preaching for for
[36:53] for 30 years and still no good at it and
[36:55] I thought Lord if I had maybe another
[36:58] 200 years maybe I'd be a little better
[37:01] maybe 300 maybe 500 I don't know but
[37:04] you'd bound to get a little better after
[37:05] a while
[37:07] amen but you know you only got 60 70
[37:10] years is all you got ain't that right so
[37:13] amen but you really amen we're going to
[37:15] have all the time in the world over
[37:17] there amen and on this side you always
[37:20] progress always want to get better ain't
[37:22] that right you have room for growth and
[37:25] betterment but over there you'll be
[37:27] perfect amen so we won't have any of
[37:30] that over there but amen I just can't
[37:33] imagine where those folks got to and how
[37:36] far they got how much they learned how
[37:38] wise they were by the time they got six
[37:41] or 700 years
[37:42] old imagine being 750 years old oh I'm
[37:46] 850 years
[37:48] old that's inconceivable almost isn't it
[37:51] for us amen so this little 70-year life
[37:55] is awful short lifespan it's awful short
[37:58] amen but anyway so we'll do the best we
[38:01] can with the help of the Lord amen and
[38:03] if you will I just have two scriptures
[38:05] is all I've got one is
[38:08] in uh John John 3 and then Romans 8
[38:15] amen amen just to show you amen this is
[38:19] this this service of course this
[38:22] is amen all right St John 3
[38:28] 5 through 8 Jesus answered verily verily
[38:33] I say unto you except a man be born of
[38:35] water and of spirit he cannot enter into
[38:38] the kingdom of
[38:40] God that which is born of the flesh is
[38:43] flesh and that which is born of the
[38:45] spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I said
[38:48] unto thee ye must be born again amen how
[38:53] many remember brother Bram preaching on
[38:55] you must be born again Welly that was
[38:57] powerful wasn't it nothing else will do
[39:00] is that
[39:03] right now where are we going to go is
[39:06] after this thought of being born again
[39:08] he says verse eight the wind bloweth
[39:11] where it listeth and he heareth the
[39:14] sound thereof but can not tell when it
[39:18] cometh or and whether it goeth so is
[39:22] everyone that is born of the spirit may
[39:26] God add His blessings to the read of the
[39:27] word amen let's read one more before
[39:30] you're seated I caught you on that one
[39:32] didn't
[39:33] I all right Romans 8 and 29 for whom he
[39:40] wait
[39:41] 8:28 and we know that all things work
[39:44] together for good to them that love God
[39:46] to them who are called according to his
[39:48] purpose you can be seated amen amen I
[39:51] like that praise the Lord so this first
[39:54] scripture that we want to just start
[39:56] with amen talks about how that a person
[39:59] that's born of the spirit amen is like
[40:03] the wind amen like the wind and there's
[40:07] very few times I think that the
[40:09] scripture talks about somebody being
[40:12] like the wind that is born of the spirit
[40:14] amen we talk much about amen being
[40:17] anchored to the Rock isn't that right
[40:20] amen and to be unmovable and all these
[40:22] other things that it talks about and and
[40:25] uh uh you know it talks about the the
[40:27] wind driving the chaff away you know it
[40:30] just talks about a lot of things but
[40:33] here uh it talks about basically from
[40:35] what I'm understanding in this is that
[40:39] the
[40:40] spirit amen is what leads a
[40:43] Christian and I think one example that
[40:46] came to mind I believe it was philli
[40:48] isn't it what was uh ministering
[40:50] somewhere brother bam said having a
[40:51] Revival and God wanted him to go
[40:54] somewhere and he just transported him
[40:56] over to that unic with that Chariot
[40:58] ain't that right transported him right
[41:00] there in the middle of it now brother
[41:01] brandham talking about it he says you
[41:03] know he's learned to always follow the
[41:05] leading of that Spirit ain't that right
[41:08] amen and brother Brandon got in trouble
[41:10] of course you know when he went to
[41:12] Africa I believe it was and God Holy
[41:14] Spirit they were had one meeting at a
[41:16] certain city I don't know just which one
[41:18] it was anymore but and the Holy Spirit
[41:20] was telling them stay right here stay
[41:22] right here but he had already made a
[41:24] league basically and was with a bunch of
[41:26] men ministers amen and he was already
[41:30] basically had agreement with him that
[41:31] we're going to go this that or the other
[41:33] and and uh you know there was no room
[41:35] for hey this is what God tells us to do
[41:38] you know but we want we've got plans to
[41:40] go up and they would not change their
[41:41] plan well from what I understand there
[41:43] was monsoons and everything that could
[41:45] go wrong did go wrong when they didn't
[41:48] follow the leading of the spirit much is
[41:50] to be said there because even Billy Paul
[41:52] said Dad man if God told you to do it
[41:54] then do it you know and brother brandham
[41:55] didn't and for years he was sick sick
[41:57] isn't that right he suffered for years
[41:59] because that he didn't follow the
[42:01] leading of the spirit amen and so I
[42:04] think after that he talked he said he
[42:06] talked about amen getting messed up with
[42:08] a bunch of
[42:10] preachers amen so how many knows whether
[42:12] it's should church or whether whatever
[42:14] it is when you're led by God it's
[42:17] important that you follow God not just
[42:19] every not and it's important to have a
[42:20] head isn't that right important to have
[42:22] a leader is't that right and that leader
[42:25] is the Holy Ghost how much better off
[42:27] all of those brothers would have been if
[42:29] they had recognized that this was a
[42:31] prophet of God cuz he came and told them
[42:34] he says God said to not to go and you'll
[42:35] pay for it if you do I mean yeah he told
[42:38] them he warned them he did his part but
[42:40] they still wouldn't
[42:42] listen amen how many know that when you
[42:44] don't do what the Holy Spirit tells you
[42:46] to do you end up paying for it it's it's
[42:49] never
[42:52] good
[42:55] amen amen so I want to I want to just
[42:57] take a few illustrations if I can I want
[42:59] to start with governments I want to talk
[43:01] about cars I want to talk about families
[43:03] I want to talk about your jobs amen and
[43:05] so forth amen and bring into into our
[43:07] thought amen of leadership basically you
[43:10] know because like I said this could be
[43:12] titled many headship leadership Unity
[43:15] whatever you might want to say but amen
[43:18] um so we want to look at the government
[43:20] first of all how many knows that now
[43:22] we're living in a world where they don't
[43:23] want any kind of
[43:25] order they don't want want any kind of
[43:28] leadership amen people are getting uh
[43:31] they're getting upset with the Supreme
[43:33] Court because they made a decision is it
[43:35] right oh they're just a bunch of you
[43:37] know they're they going against this
[43:39] just shut up that's what they decided on
[43:42] ain't that right but AB Bram talked
[43:44] about an absolute you know in a ball
[43:46] game you know that Empire it doesn't
[43:48] matter how hot you get it don't matter
[43:49] what that that that humire is the
[43:52] absolute and it's a good thing you got
[43:55] it cuz can you imagine the parents that
[43:58] fight each other and everything else go
[44:00] on if they had a democracy about whether
[44:02] that was a ball or whether that was a
[44:03] strike why they could never make it to
[44:05] the second
[44:07] inning why because no this one said it
[44:09] was this and that one saw it all was
[44:11] that oh my you just have chaos I want
[44:13] you to understand that a world that is
[44:15] not does not have leadership is a world
[44:18] of
[44:19] chaos I don't care if it's in your
[44:21] family I don't care if it's in your
[44:22] church I don't care if it's your
[44:24] individual I don't care where it is
[44:27] amen we know the government set up Amen
[44:29] to where we have like the president of
[44:30] the United States He is the leader isn't
[44:32] that right and then the leader of a or a
[44:35] state is called the governor the leader
[44:37] of a city is called a mayor amen then
[44:40] you've got your Police Department in
[44:41] that City and so forth he is called the
[44:43] sheriff and under him of course is
[44:45] connected to your deputies and so forth
[44:48] just like in a family we've got the
[44:50] husband who's the head of the uh family
[44:52] isn't that right then you've got the
[44:53] wife you got the children everything is
[44:55] connected
[44:58] and as long as everything is in order
[45:01] everything works
[45:04] good how good it all works when it works
[45:08] the way that it's supposed
[45:11] to
[45:12] [Music]
[45:13] amen
[45:17] hallelujah how good it
[45:19] works to be a
[45:21] Christian when you're the kind of
[45:23] Christian that you're supposed to be
[45:26] isn't that right
[45:28] amen now how many knows that God in
[45:32] every in all of nature all of nature God
[45:36] said I believe in Romans he says that
[45:37] you can look at the nature and see God
[45:40] why because everything is a reflection
[45:42] of him brother bam said all the natural
[45:44] types the spiritual and that all natural
[45:47] types the spiritual and so you can look
[45:49] at the natural and all of that and see
[45:51] that this God is the way that he
[45:53] ordained it and today while we've got
[45:55] you know all the conf confusion that we
[45:57] do is
[46:00] because a lack of leadership a lack of
[46:04] Direction and I thank God for direction
[46:07] I'm glad when somebody said you can't do
[46:10] that you shouldn't do that how you glad
[46:14] for rules why if you didn't have any
[46:17] rules you'd have a
[46:20] Walmart scenario with a mom going down
[46:23] through there and the kid screaming to
[46:25] the top of their voice
[46:28] quiet now quiet now quiet be
[46:32] quiet huh you'd have
[46:34] chaos ain't that right but when you got
[46:38] rules you got somebody sitting there
[46:41] quietly mama ain't got to fuss mama
[46:43] ain't got to have all those
[46:46] issues got to have order how beautiful
[46:50] that order
[46:53] is when things are in
[46:58] control and you and I were
[47:02] made to have something in
[47:06] here that leads
[47:09] us that controls
[47:12] you how many believes you're going to be
[47:14] led by
[47:16] something
[47:18] amen that's right you're going to be led
[47:21] by something you're going to be full of
[47:22] something let me change my settings here
[47:25] for just a minute on home screen so that
[47:28] it'll stay on for
[47:31] me from two minutes to 10
[47:39] minutes I'm going to go go ahead I only
[47:42] got a five
[47:43] six five or six
[47:46] here now
[47:48] listen how many believes that there's
[47:50] only two
[47:51] Powers two powers in the world brother
[47:53] bam said that's right two Powers there's
[47:55] two kingdoms in this world world that
[47:57] we're living in amen all the rest all
[48:00] the minor things that's connected with
[48:01] either one of those Powers that's the
[48:03] power of God or the power of Satan as I
[48:06] was thinking about that even today
[48:08] remember every little deed that people
[48:10] do every move people make every move
[48:13] that you make every thought that you
[48:14] think how many believes it's all by one
[48:16] power or the other and what I'm getting
[48:19] to every war every disorder everything
[48:23] that comes along it's either controlled
[48:24] by God's power or Satan's power because
[48:27] there's only two powers and that is the
[48:29] power of God and the power of life I
[48:31] like what it said it's either
[48:34] controlled controlled by God's power so
[48:38] you're going to be moved by
[48:40] something ye
[48:43] amen you're going to be moved by
[48:50] something I don't know what we would do
[48:52] if we didn't have the message of the
[48:53] hour
[48:57] ain't that right where would we
[49:00] be if we would be in Pentecost think of
[49:03] where we would be look at the confusion
[49:06] and the mess that's
[49:08] there Baptist Methodist wherever it
[49:11] might be
[49:14] amen I'm going to say this you leave the
[49:16] message you you you leave believing that
[49:20] you better stay with what the prophet
[49:21] you leave that and you start adding to
[49:24] your own ideas and everything else and
[49:26] you'll be in the mess
[49:28] also you'll be in a chaos amen I don't
[49:32] think you got to be in a denomination to
[49:33] be a
[49:34] denomination you know you know you can
[49:36] be a denom one man one person
[49:39] denomination it's when you want to do it
[49:41] according to the way that you think that
[49:43] it ought to be done rather than the way
[49:44] that the word says that it was
[49:47] done I've lived long enough I preached
[49:50] long enough to know that most of the
[49:51] time when you're preaching when you're
[49:53] any part of this word there's always two
[49:54] sides of it there's always two ways of
[49:56] looking at it whether you're such a dry
[49:59] church until icicles are hanging off of
[50:00] the wall ain't that right or on the
[50:02] other part if you're really full you're
[50:04] a quiet person you know or you can be
[50:06] quiet he might be still hello amen so it
[50:10] can be either way and it takes what I'm
[50:11] trying to say is it takes the Holy
[50:13] Spirit to lead you and to guide you know
[50:16] when like uh Ecclesiastes talked about
[50:20] he says there's a time for this and
[50:21] there's a time for that and a time for
[50:23] this ain't that right and for you to
[50:25] Navigate to navigate through all of this
[50:27] it takes the leadership of the holy
[50:31] spirit
[50:33] amen and so you got to have a navigator
[50:35] you got to have something that navigates
[50:37] you a GPS so to speak
[50:42] amen amen two powers and you're going to
[50:45] be controlled that's going to control
[50:47] amen you got to have a country how many
[50:50] knows our country is what out of
[50:54] control plum out of
[50:58] control you can't have women's sports
[51:01] nowadays ain't that right folks you know
[51:05] just not so long ago one an athlete I
[51:07] they just forfeit it because it was
[51:09] going to be a trans coming against her I
[51:11] just
[51:12] forfeit why because the left that wants
[51:15] everything so equal they want it all so
[51:18] e equal and so fair they want they don't
[51:20] want nothing Fair they don't want
[51:21] nothing equal they sure don't want
[51:23] nothing
[51:24] Fair amen
[51:31] oh my I might as well say it there gry
[51:33] matter has really got scbl up up in
[51:35] there it's some really I don't know what
[51:37] kind of bug got up in there but it's
[51:39] really
[51:40] bad because they can't think right
[51:42] anymore and you're controlled by one or
[51:45] you're controlled by the
[51:47] other
[51:49] amen
[51:53] now my story basically the story that I
[51:56] wanted to start with was the uh when
[51:57] brother Brandon was up in Canada if you
[51:59] remember and he was preaching and there
[52:00] was this um TV salesman that he was
[52:04] going down through there the next next
[52:06] year I guess he was going down the
[52:07] streets and so forth and he went by this
[52:09] guy that was selling
[52:11] TVs and he got to talking to this guy
[52:14] about the TV screen and so forth because
[52:16] that guy said ah you aren't with that
[52:18] with what do you you with that brandom
[52:20] outfit are you yeah I just what do you
[52:22] think about him yeah I think he's the
[52:24] biggest hypocrite ever and all that
[52:25] other stuff you you know and then here
[52:28] just a little bit later in the
[52:29] conversation brother Braham says I am
[52:30] brother Braham he says oh wow so I just
[52:32] called you a hypocrite to your
[52:34] face he says I would rather you do it to
[52:37] my face than behind my back he said
[52:39] that's the right way to do it just s it
[52:40] to my
[52:42] face you
[52:44] know I don't know that this man got
[52:46] converted but there was very few people
[52:48] that didn't get converted when they come
[52:50] in contact with brother brandom ain't
[52:52] that right that Infidel of 70 years I'm
[52:54] getting off my subject I guess but
[52:55] that's not all right but the Infidel of
[52:57] 70 years ain't that right when he was
[53:00] going to squirrel
[53:04] hunting I can't think of his buddy that
[53:06] took him squirrel hunting but his buddy
[53:08] went up there because he knew his dad
[53:10] ain't that right so he went up there and
[53:12] talked to him a little bit and he got
[53:14] this say you mean you've gotten so low
[53:15] down you got to carry a preacher
[53:16] wherever you go ain't that right he says
[53:19] and the brother BR says well I may you
[53:21] think maybe I need to step out he
[53:23] stepped out of the cow come on up there
[53:25] with all of that blood on him and all
[53:26] this side or the other and you all know
[53:27] the story amen and finally got to
[53:30] talking about the
[53:31] apples and the apple trees isn't that
[53:34] right you know the apple trees that he
[53:35] planted you know the Bible talks about
[53:37] becoming all things to all people isn't
[53:39] that right so that you might win some
[53:42] that don't mean necessarily become like
[53:44] them hello folks and so forth amen but
[53:46] to be able to go down on their level and
[53:48] begin to call pick up their conversation
[53:50] if you're a farmer talk about farming
[53:52] amen come down to where they are but
[53:54] certainly don't partake of their s or
[53:56] there wrong
[53:58] amen but anyway so what I was saying is
[54:01] that even there he led him but here he
[54:03] was brother brandham was talking about
[54:04] how that uh he was talking about this uh
[54:07] television and how you know uh how that
[54:11] there's a uh in that television because
[54:14] that man didn't believe anything that he
[54:15] couldn't be scientifically proved right
[54:17] anything that isn't scientifically
[54:19] proved you know and he says I'll prove
[54:21] anything that you can see isn't real and
[54:22] only the things that you can't see is
[54:24] real everything that you see is temporal
[54:32] just had a thought coming in mind I hope
[54:34] I can pick it up later but I'll just say
[54:37] this how many believes that we we it's
[54:39] time that we have the mind of God it's
[54:42] time that we pick up the mind of God and
[54:44] think the way that he
[54:45] does amen that's all about that control
[54:48] that control down on the inside will
[54:50] cause you to think the way that God
[54:52] thinks and it won't look so much on the
[54:54] things of this Earth as it does about
[54:55] your spiritual welfare where you are
[54:57] with God the things of God are will be
[54:59] number one over anything else when
[55:02] you're thinking the way that God thinks
[55:04] amen God bless you Josh and sister Leah
[55:08] amen so uh anyway I want to get on that
[55:11] maybe a little bit later but I wanted to
[55:13] just say that before I forget it because
[55:14] it came to mind but that's part of Amen
[55:17] what's happening I truly believe that's
[55:19] what's happening but this this uh he was
[55:22] talking to him and so forth and he was
[55:23] talking about how that in is he said
[55:25] it's super natural he said it's
[55:27] supernatural because he man he says
[55:29] where's that guy you know on this
[55:30] television there was somebody doing some
[55:32] music or whatever plumbed down in
[55:34] Chicago and they were way up there and
[55:36] he says you know there's this you know
[55:37] there's it's no telling how many PL
[55:40] people that that invisible picture has
[55:42] to go through a't that right because
[55:45] maybe you just have an antenna or
[55:47] whatever and it's got to pick up a
[55:48] signal and so forth and he says you know
[55:51] uh and he could prove he was trying to
[55:53] say to brother brand I can prove that
[55:54] you know it it's real because you it
[55:56] picks it up right here the crystal picks
[55:58] it up and he said to brother bam he says
[56:00] they have a sending station where they
[56:02] send all the signals and the pictures
[56:04] and it comes here and we pick it
[56:07] up amen and he picks it up and he says
[56:11] oh that's wonderful see there's
[56:13] something Supernatural about and he said
[56:15] oh yes but see that's easy he said we've
[56:18] got that's easy to explain because we've
[56:20] got a sending station and a receiving
[56:22] station and I said I said so do we
[56:27] so do we how many believe that God has a
[56:31] place where he's sending his signal
[56:33] sending his word but there has to be
[56:36] somebody to receive
[56:40] it we which are alive and remain into
[56:43] the coming of the Lord so that somebody
[56:45] has to receive that that has to come
[56:48] into somebody and change their body and
[56:51] prove that it's real to go from the
[56:54] invisible to the visible
[56:57] amen so have we amen that's right we got
[57:00] a sending station and a receiving
[57:01] station certainly just tune out all the
[57:04] static the unbelief out and watch what
[57:07] takes place watch that picture clear up
[57:09] that's right you say oh yes I Lord I see
[57:11] it now that's what makes the different
[57:14] it depends on how much static you let
[57:16] get in see amen just stay right with God
[57:19] and with the word and God will bring it
[57:21] right straight to path pass as positive
[57:25] every time
[57:28] amen the thought tonight is connection
[57:33] connection
[57:37] amen somewhere that it's sent from and
[57:41] then it has to connect somewhere else
[57:44] when a president says something ain't
[57:46] that right his word is pretty
[57:48] powerful everybody's supposed to knck
[57:50] down they're supposed to do what he says
[57:53] amen
[57:56] they're supposed to especially when it's
[57:58] according to the law and so forth and
[58:00] everything that that he's supposed to
[58:02] uphold the chain of command comes on
[58:05] it's all connected comes down you know
[58:07] just like uh uh you know the the a
[58:10] federal law is supposed to be over a
[58:12] state law a that right they're supposed
[58:15] to be but the state laws are supposed to
[58:17] be
[58:17] subject but makes it it makes a little
[58:20] bit of a static it makes it a little bit
[58:22] disconnected when the federal law is
[58:24] breaking the law yeah and you're trying
[58:27] to uphold the law as we've seen with
[58:30] what we over in Texas and so forth with
[58:31] immigration ain't that right and
[58:33] upholding the law this out of the other
[58:35] then you get all kinds of friction but
[58:37] you know it's supposed to work together
[58:39] good how many believes that and when you
[58:42] don't it get it all messed up you got to
[58:45] have all of that all of the connections
[58:46] has to be the way that it's supposed to
[58:48] be and me when it is you have
[58:51] Unity ain't that right when everything's
[58:53] unified it's just so much
[58:56] better amen but I'm thankful
[59:01] now I've got another one I don't think
[59:06] that I had time to put this on my iPad
[59:10] when God made man he made him
[59:15] thus amen he made him with this little
[59:18] compartment in the man in his own for
[59:22] his own throne for his control tower
[59:26] part of the reason I said you know I'm
[59:28] so glad that we have the message so that
[59:30] we understand that we as human beings we
[59:33] were not meant to control or lead oursel
[59:36] and we were made a certain
[59:39] way how many believe we were made a
[59:42] certain way and if that certain way
[59:45] isn't connected the way that it's
[59:47] supposed to
[59:48] be
[59:50] amen then you've got major
[59:54] problems you've got confusion
[59:57] usion you've got
[59:59] incompletion
[1:00:02] amen I was I wasn't going to say this
[1:00:04] but I was trying to one of my lights
[1:00:06] under my cabinet blew a few weeks ago
[1:00:09] and I bought a new Under The Cabinet
[1:00:11] light wired it up flipped the
[1:00:14] breaker and you know I guess when the
[1:00:16] plug in I should have made sure I marked
[1:00:18] the the little part where supposed to be
[1:00:20] the ground or the white one and the

[1:04:25] deceived that's where SE Satan deceived
[1:04:28] Eve by what she could see the fruit was
[1:04:31] pleasant so is it tonight God wants to
[1:04:33] lead man so he made himself a little
[1:04:35] control tower in the midst of his heart
[1:04:38] so that that man would be led by the
[1:04:40] spirit of God getting off of his own
[1:04:43] leadings amen which is what separated
[1:04:46] him from the fellowship to begin with
[1:04:50] man
[1:04:52] always trying to achieve something by
[1:04:54] his head
[1:04:56] he says but he's supposed to achieve by
[1:04:59] his
[1:05:01] heart amen that's the control tower
[1:05:04] where God wants to control him and
[1:05:06] directs his thoughts directs his walks
[1:05:08] directs his
[1:05:11] emotions sometimes I get so happy I just
[1:05:13] have to let loose and if I look around
[1:05:16] and see some somebody then see see I got
[1:05:18] my eyes on people then but God help me
[1:05:20] to close my eyes keep my eyes closed and
[1:05:23] I just want to be led by the spirit of
[1:05:24] God that the flesh will have nothing to
[1:05:27] do with it

[1:12:13] different it might sound mechanical but
[1:12:16] I know this is not a
[1:12:17] mechanical mechanical thing but even the
[1:12:21] brother Brandon brought it down to a
[1:12:22] mechanical thing
[1:12:25] when he talked about the Cadillac is
[1:12:27] that right and the mechanics of all the
[1:12:29] Cadillac is't that right and then also
[1:12:32] of the Dynamics you got to have both
[1:12:34] isn't that right both mechanical and he

[1:12:55] there's also what we would call
[1:12:58] connection or
[1:13:00] order that if you don't have that you
[1:13:03] will be
[1:13:04] defeated is that right if you don't have
[1:13:08] order you'll be
[1:13:13] defeated he said the brains of an army
[1:13:16] lays in its captains the intelligence
[1:13:19] raml in Germany I guess it's raml in
[1:13:23] Germany was the brains of Germany not
[1:13:25] Hitler raml that's right Eisenhower
[1:13:28] military men Patton those men who were
[1:13:30] at the front it depend on which way they
[1:13:33] gave the order you follow your
[1:13:37] captain can you
[1:13:43] imagine who was it listen follow your
[1:13:47] captain if he's got the right kind of a
[1:13:49] general if he's the right kind if he's a
[1:13:52] fourstar if he's proved if he's proven
[1:13:55] to be right follow him though it may
[1:13:57] seem wrong to you go on to the front do
[1:14:01] as you are told Hallelujah we've got a
[1:14:03] five-star general spelled j s u s
[1:14:07] placing five stars of on us Faith he's

[1:14:15] grave all the Devils out of the way he's
[1:14:17] a great Captain so the devil isn't even
[1:14:19] in the picture Amen in the greatest
[1:14:22] battle he ever fought
[1:14:25] amen our captain our five-star general
[1:14:28] in World War
[1:14:29] II brother Glenn you was in the military
[1:14:31] so I've got your ears but Brian too can
[1:14:35] you imagine a Little Grunt or a little
[1:14:37] private coming up and say hey Captain
[1:14:39] you I got a good idea for this
[1:14:44] one I I think I know how we can do
[1:14:48] it huh oh my how many wars have you been
[1:14:53] this is my first one
[1:14:57] kick him in the backside and get back in
[1:14:59] your place you'll get us all killed
[1:15:01] ain't that
[1:15:03] right no you would never listen to
[1:15:05] somebody like that not some amateur not
[1:15:09] somebody that doesn't know hasn't been
[1:15:11] there those festar generals they've been
[1:15:13] s so many battles and everything they
[1:15:15] know how to lose they know how to win a
[1:15:18] that right and man they know how to go
[1:15:20] about it 100 times better than what that
[1:15:23] grunt or that young one does
[1:15:25] so it's the intelligence of
[1:15:28] it wo think about our general how many
[1:15:32] knows our general is a fstar general j s
[1:15:36] u there ain't a smarter General
[1:15:41] anywhere we know that the devil has had
[1:15:44] 6,000 years of
[1:15:47] experience ain't that right he has got
[1:15:49] 6,000 years of smarts built up
[1:15:57] he's gotten
[1:15:58] smarter and he's got smarter the dumb
[1:16:01] guy
[1:16:06] did dumb guy got
[1:16:09] smarter I said dumb guy for a reason
[1:16:12] folks cuz my captain never was
[1:16:15] dumb my go my captain never did have to
[1:16:19] learn he never have to have
[1:16:22] experience he's the author he's the
[1:16:26] engineer his mind and his thoughts are
[1:16:29] perfect to begin with he's never had to
[1:16:32] evolve how manyan believes his weapons
[1:16:34] and his Warfare amen they never have to
[1:16:37] get any
[1:16:39] better W think that's our captain when
[1:16:43] you're connected to him you'll defeat
[1:16:46] that devil every
[1:16:48] time that's
[1:16:52] right one of the schemes
[1:16:55] the devil wants and he likes is for you
[1:16:57] to make you believe that you can defeat
[1:16:59] him without the holy ghost that you can
[1:17:02] defeat him on your
[1:17:04] own he wants you to think that because
[1:17:07] he knows you
[1:17:09] can't ain't that
[1:17:13] right all
[1:17:16] right I I think I'll drop off of that
[1:17:19] one but in the military everything has
[1:17:21] to be yes sir is that right yes yes sir
[1:17:26] yes
[1:17:27] sir how many believes in with us who's
[1:17:31] he that loveth me if you love me keep my
[1:17:36] Commandments yes
[1:17:38] sir if you love God and if you want to
[1:17:40] win do what you're
[1:17:42] told I ain't got to figure out how to
[1:17:45] win I got to just listen to what he said
[1:17:48] and do what he said and you'll
[1:17:52] win try to do it your way one time and
[1:17:55] find out how much you lose unfortunately
[1:17:58] there's a lot of message Believers think
[1:18:00] they can do it their way and win no you
[1:18:03] can't you can't go against the word of
[1:18:06] God and win you won't
[1:18:08] win it has to be according to the word
[1:18:10] of
[1:18:12] God God help our minds ain't that right
[1:18:15] I love it when me and my wife man will
[1:18:17] she'll say something and I'll say that's
[1:18:19] what I was thinking maybe working
[1:18:22] together with my boys you think
[1:18:23] something and that's what I was thinking
[1:18:25] that's on the same
[1:18:27] wavelength same wavelength how many beli
[1:18:30] you've got to be
[1:18:31] linked on the same wavelink as
[1:18:36] Christ if you're going to BN if you're
[1:18:39] going to
[1:18:41] overcome because remember
[1:18:45] Jesus is Worthy of all praise all honor
[1:18:48] and all glory is that right but it says
[1:18:51] that his bride's going to sit with him
[1:18:53] in his throne because she is worthy how
[1:18:57] many believes you're going to be worthy
[1:18:58] God's going to make you
[1:19:00] worthy amen you don't want you wouldn't
[1:19:03] want you want somebody that with the
[1:19:06] intelligence I like that and I brought
[1:19:07] that about intelligence it's the
[1:19:10] intelligence of anybody any kind of a
[1:19:13] battle it's it's it's the general that
[1:19:16] has the brains they try to figure it out
[1:19:18] they you know it's the smart of
[1:19:21] them amen and God trans ERS his
[1:19:26] smarts amen down into not your
[1:19:30] head not your head but into your
[1:19:35] heart
[1:19:37] amen that's the control to that's that's
[1:19:39] the power pack as we might say
[1:19:44] Amen praise the
[1:19:48] Lord
[1:19:50] amen next next example
[1:19:55] I want to read
[1:19:57] this and maybe just get a fresh
[1:20:00] Revelation a little bit new revelation

[1:20:46] them filled with gasoline that's the
[1:20:48] running power the gasoline because in it
[1:20:51] is the octane now when you go to startom
[1:20:54] although both of them look Al light and
[1:20:56] there was one of them didn't have any
[1:20:57] spark any firing power well you say the
[1:21:01] power is in the gasoline brother brandom
[1:21:04] but I don't care how much power is in
[1:21:05] the gasoline unless there's spark there
[1:21:07] to manifest that power amen L there's a
[1:21:11] power there to confirm that it's
[1:21:13] gasoline it might as well be
[1:21:18] water
[1:21:22] amen we've got the mechanic
[1:21:26] we've got what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:21:28] for we've got perfect Faith perfect love
[1:21:30] we've got all of the mechanics of the
[1:21:33] word how many believe the fullness of
[1:21:35] the word has been
[1:21:37] restored it's been given us back acts
[1:21:40] 238 repentance in Jesus name baptism my
[1:21:44] every part of the mechanics it's all
[1:21:47] there amen tells us that we're sons of
[1:21:51] God that we're redeemed back amen into
[1:21:53] the same condition that Adam was before
[1:21:55] the
[1:21:57] fall W how many knows that's a big
[1:22:00] mouthful that you're restored back to
[1:22:02] God and fellowship with him just like
[1:22:05] Adam was before the fall amen that you
[1:22:07] can speak to mountains and they'll move
[1:22:10] trees they'll
[1:22:11] move Bulls they'll move Hornets they'll
[1:22:14] move storms they'll move they were an
[1:22:18] example wasn't that an
[1:22:19] example all the mechanics is there but
[1:22:22] if it's just if it doesn't have that
[1:22:25] spark there if that connection's not
[1:22:28] there it might as well be
[1:22:30] water it don't mean nothing
[1:22:33] thing if the spark ain't there let me
[1:22:37] tell you you got to plug in that plug in
[1:22:39] if the breaker's off it is do a bit of
[1:22:43] good and that's the way it is with a
[1:22:45] Christian tonight you come to church you
[1:22:48] ain't got the Holy Ghost you need the
[1:22:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost how do you get
[1:22:52] it by repenting
[1:22:54] turning around from the way that you're
[1:22:56] do and saying God I Repent I ain't doing

[1:28:54] but you
[1:28:57] know I wanted to say and I wrote down
[1:29:01] here God is my gas
[1:29:05] pedal God is my
[1:29:08] brakes what is what what what is it that
[1:29:12] causes the car going down the road uh
[1:29:14] you know speed up and slow down is this
[1:29:16] little pedal that you put foot pushes
[1:29:18] just some little pedal isn't that right
[1:29:20] you push on that pedal and whoa here we
[1:29:23] go is that right then there's another
[1:29:26] little pedal over here on the left
[1:29:27] called the brake
[1:29:29] pedal and man when you want to slow down
[1:29:33] right now what if you just had a pedal
[1:29:36] there that was disconnected and you know
[1:29:38] sometimes we need one over on the other
[1:29:40] side for our partner right just give
[1:29:42] them a pedal to push on because they
[1:29:44] want to help you
[1:29:49] drive my wife did not so long ago I was

[1:30:02] car text Tex oh you know sometimes you
[1:30:06] think it's important you about run off
[1:30:07] the
[1:30:08] road but that's right if you had that
[1:30:10] pedal it wasn't connected but that
[1:30:12] connection goes to what to a cable or or
[1:30:15] or something that puts us on a cylinder
[1:30:17] amen and it goes into a brake line it
[1:30:19] goes all the way down into them
[1:30:21] brakes and it squishes them break pads
[1:30:24] together just the pedal don't do it but
[1:30:27] because it's connected there's power
[1:30:31] there amen they don't call it power
[1:30:33] steering for nothing God is oh my here

[1:30:57] knows that God gives you Faith he gives
[1:31:00] you that key and says take this key of
[1:31:02] Faith amen and turn the thing over cuz
[1:31:05] when you turn that thing over something
[1:31:07] comes from the battery amen it brings a
[1:31:09] spark to the spark plug am me that spark
[1:31:12] go goes from there amen it goes to
[1:31:14] something that's making that thing shoot
[1:31:15] a little bit of gas in there and boom W

[1:32:09] that's the same is God
[1:32:13] speaking you receiving the
[1:32:16] word amen and being changed and going
[1:32:20] out there a different person than what
[1:32:22] you came in but you got to get ready too
[1:32:25] just like the preacher got to get
[1:32:27] ready you come in here oh it's a
[1:32:30] Wednesday night again you're going to
[1:32:32] hear Thomas B again rattling and on and
[1:32:35] everything
[1:32:36] else I hope it's more than rattles to
[1:32:40] you I hope it's a little
[1:32:42] more when any preacher comes up here but
[1:32:45] you come and say God I know that no
[1:32:47] matter who's up
[1:32:49] there huh cuz we got a little James 3 in
[1:32:53] us some sometimes well if it's certain
[1:32:55] preacher I'll amen and mo I'll be really
[1:32:56] into it but if it's another one nah not
[1:32:59] really you respect your a person
[1:33:02] backslid sorry
[1:33:04] outfit
[1:33:09] amen I don't care if we get a donkey up
[1:33:11] here I'm
[1:33:16] expecting huh God's used the donkey
[1:33:21] before amen boy that guy I don't think
[1:33:24] much of him he ain't much of a Preacher
[1:33:25] but come expecting open up your ears a
[1:33:28] little bit you'll get something all
[1:33:30] right Ain in that I
[1:33:32] me that's right and another thing it
[1:33:36] means brothers and sisters is sending
[1:33:39] and receiving station it comes down into
[1:33:42] your heart a't that right and then that
[1:33:46] controls that controls and brother Bram
[1:33:50] talked about how that the headship the
[1:33:52] head has come down the head ship has
[1:33:54] come down to the body and that headship
[1:33:56] is the word is't that right the word
[1:33:59] typifying the head now you might think
[1:34:02] well your mind your mind whether I jump
[1:34:06] or
[1:34:06] not depends on whether I want to or not
[1:34:09] it's what my head tells me what my head
[1:34:12] tells
[1:34:14] me everything my head tells me that I
[1:34:18] do
[1:34:20] amen however it goes deep ER than that
[1:34:25] because this here needs to be in charge
[1:34:28] of this
[1:34:29] here a't that right not just this being
[1:34:32] in charge of the body but this being in
[1:34:35] charge of the
[1:34:36] body because you just go by this brother
[1:34:39] Bram said what the devil uses a man's
[1:34:41] head God uses a man's heart all you have
[1:34:46] is this here and you don't have that
[1:34:47] control tower buddy you'll go places and
[1:34:50] do things
[1:34:51] unimaginable I mean you look out there
[1:34:53] and you can see what that's all
[1:34:55] about amen not a place that you want to
[1:34:58] go amen back to the carford just a
[1:35:01] minute amen I remember brother Braham
[1:35:03] talked about having automatic faith and
[1:35:05] manual faith and things like that and
[1:35:08] people live their lives manually
[1:35:09] basically or or automatically like and
[1:35:12] everything is supposed to be automatic
[1:35:14] because I used to have a 72 Chevy truck
[1:35:16] I remember when I first married my wife
[1:35:19] the rocker panels was rusted out and you
[1:35:21] could probably see out the door a little
[1:35:22] bit down through there and you know
[1:35:24] every time we come up to a red light I'd
[1:35:26] have to stop the truck get out pop the
[1:35:28] hood and get them gears I'm
[1:35:31] stuck cuz well he one of them shifters
[1:35:33] you know and I almost every light I had
[1:35:35] to go out there and do it folks she sat
[1:35:38] up beside me and loved me just as much
[1:35:39] as if I was driving a nice
[1:35:44] Corvette but I'll tell you it's not
[1:35:46] something that's fun to do is to go out
[1:35:48] there and have to CH I'll manually do
[1:35:50] this at or the other what that isn't it
[1:35:52] nice just to pull it down out woo can I
[1:35:55] say something Christian just put it in
[1:35:57] drive and let him drive cuz he's my
[1:36:00] steering will he's I'm not the captain
[1:36:03] he's the captain that's steering whe in
[1:36:05] my life let him turn you this way like
[1:36:08] he did Phillip turn you that way like
[1:36:10] you did Brother bam and me turn you this
[1:36:11] way or that way he is in
[1:36:14] control he is my got a hold of my
[1:36:16] steering wheel he got my gas pedal amen
[1:36:19] he's my throttle when he says go I go
[1:36:22] when he says stop I
[1:36:25] stop how many times God tells you now
[1:36:27] don't do that you know you won't want to
[1:36:30] do that don't do that don't don't do
[1:36:32] that and then you stop who where God
[1:36:36] tells you to do
[1:36:38] something step on the gasp go do this go
[1:36:42] do that ain't that
[1:36:45] right
[1:36:46] amen and you're riding with him joy
[1:36:49] unspeakable and full of Glory peace that
[1:36:52] passes understand standing like the cars
[1:36:55] we got today just turn on the good good
[1:36:58] music a't that
[1:37:07] right hey man I thought had to double
[1:37:10] think of whether I wanted to say it or
[1:37:12] not I'll go ahead and say it you might
[1:37:15] need to laugh I was coming home from
[1:37:17] Hopkinsville the other day and I was
[1:37:19] listening to one of my I you know I got
[1:37:21] this new uh little GPS thing in my truck
[1:37:25] because when I bought the truck I wanted
[1:37:27] the truck with the screen and backup and
[1:37:29] all that other stuff lights you know
[1:37:31] like you know and when I got this one I
[1:37:34] bought it it didn't have any of that so

[1:44:44] look at that again we should look at
[1:44:45] that again see if we're really up there
[1:44:47] where we should be but he talked about
[1:44:49] how that there man has been able to
[1:44:51] achieve amen going into outer space but
[1:44:55] they did it and they would control the
[1:44:57] shuttle and the space shuttle I think at
[1:44:59] Mars and and and that robot they had on
[1:45:01] one of those planets you know they would
[1:45:03] control it from down here ain't that
[1:45:04] right can you
[1:45:06] imagine some other planet I'm not sure

[1:45:18] my in the same way he was talking about
[1:45:20] hot at man when he was up there
[1:45:27] in that way up there in as an
[1:45:31] astronaut not notice the natural
[1:45:34] astronaut has a something to control him
[1:45:37] when the astronaut is in the air he has
[1:45:39] something backwards here back here here
[1:45:41] on the earth that controls him it's
[1:45:44] called radar that radar moves him
[1:45:50] around amen I'm sure you read me
[1:45:53] spiritually shows where he's at tells
[1:45:56] where he's going and that radar controls
[1:45:59] him from that radar Tower here on Earth
[1:46:01] that's the natural astronaut so the
[1:46:04] spiritual astronaut has a control
[1:46:07] Power has a control tower amen it's not
[1:46:10] down here like man see it's up there and
[1:46:13] it's the Holy Spirit that's in him
[1:46:15] that's controlling him the Tower of the
[1:46:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost

[1:46:38] heart it picks up the signal hey I want
[1:46:41] you to do this I want you to do that

[1:47:11] happens it's always under control he's
[1:47:13] got a control tower that's the Holy
[1:47:15] Ghost amen that's God's program amen now
[1:47:20] listen so they got in their great
[1:47:22] science ific tube here not long ago the
[1:47:25] astronaut tube and are talking about a
[1:47:27] countdown heading to the Moon they're
[1:47:30] getting off here too he says and they
[1:47:33] got an astronaut in a big tube powered
[1:47:35] by atomic power and they can send it
[1:47:37] plump to the Moon they claim and then
[1:47:39] they got it in their tube and they're
[1:47:41] waiting for that
[1:47:43] countdown now notice the spiritual
[1:47:45] astronaut got in Christ and is listening
[1:47:49] to the
[1:47:51] countdown how many May beli we're
[1:47:53] looking for a
[1:47:55] countdown we're listening like Terry

[1:48:15] countdown of the word oh my they're
[1:48:18] headed to Heaven not the moon amen
[1:48:21] they'll pass the moon so fast they won't
[1:48:23] even see it waiting for that countdown
[1:48:25] waiting for the countdown that's right
[1:48:27] what are they doing they're wrapped in
[1:48:29] Christ in rapturing Grace nothing they
[1:48:33] did
[1:48:34] themselves how many believe that it's
[1:48:37] not what you did it's not what we do
[1:48:41] it's his grace his
[1:48:44] Mercy that we're wrapped in in the tube

[1:48:52] which you have in your
[1:48:53] heart we'll go further than just that
[1:48:56] but it'll go and it'll change his very

[1:49:11] amen
[1:49:14] amen
[1:49:17] leadership control tower a guide
[1:49:21] something Unity
[1:49:23] all of the mechanics of that c
[1:49:25] everything that works together it makes
[1:49:28] it work
[1:49:29] good but Abraham says if we could be so
[1:49:32] unified as a group in faith nothing
[1:49:34] would be impossible isn't that right
[1:49:36] takes Unity it's working together when
[1:49:38] everything works the way that it's
[1:49:41] supposed
[1:49:42] to that you have
[1:49:44] really amen at what's
[1:49:49] makes us to be able to
[1:49:52] move and have our being in Christ to the

[1:50:02] past time that's your heart's
[1:50:05] desire that's my heart's

[1:50:58] enemy it'll stop the devil from being
[1:51:01] able to get a hold of you the way that
[1:51:04] he would like

[1:51:59] Prophet when he was lost and going in
[1:52:01] circles he thought he was a guide that's
[1:52:04] what we think a lot of times that's what
[1:52:05] the world thinks that they can guide
[1:52:08] themselves Lord and during a death walk
