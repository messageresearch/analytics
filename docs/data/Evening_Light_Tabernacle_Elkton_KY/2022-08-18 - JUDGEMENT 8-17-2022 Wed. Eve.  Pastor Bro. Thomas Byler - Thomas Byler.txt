lord so i don't know when brother john's having a meeting or whatever but amen just uh amen let's do like we usually do i guess and see if we can't be a blessing to somebody amen and certainly looking forward to it i need to call but luke hadn't talked to him for a while i don't know if he's bringing the bus or not or just what he's doing but certainly looking forward to him coming up ministering for amen so praise the lord um can't think of anything so let's just power heads lord jesus we just come before you lord and we want to tell you that we're grateful father to be assembled together again lord lord jesus how sweet it is lord when believers come together lord and you're there in our midst in our hearts lord jesus your goodness your kindness lord jesus in every heart lord the love of god being shared abroad in our hearts having loved one for another praying for one another lord and being brothers sisters of like faith lord believing god that you'll come down tonight lord and just speak to us along the way and help us learn father what you want us to learn tonight lord and just have your way you know lord jesus just what i've been meditating on lord jesus and so forth but god we know that your holy spirit is just in control and once you have the preeminence in everything father we love you and we just appreciate those who are feeling better again lord jesus and pray for those that are still not feeling the best lord jesus we ask god you'd raise him up quickly lord jesus and help us all to appreciate everything you've done for us now jesus name amen and amen praise the lord tonight i just want to have a bible study would that be okay kind of a bible study amen and i mentioned wednesday or sunday i believe it was amen as we spoke amen uh perhaps speaking on the amen and so if you will let's turn to the book of revelations if you will and i do want to do quite a i actually i want to do quite a bit of reading i mean out of the bible i don't even think i have one quote yeah i got one here but other than that it's all just scriptures amen and so we'll go to the 17th chapter of revelations and i really want to cover 14 15 16 17 18 18 and maybe it's up to you if you want to cover a little on 19 or not if you want to go that long but anyway i want to cover some of those and there's certain things i want to pull out of there and we want to just learn something here with the help of the lord and so revelations i believe it's 17 i want to go to revelation 17 and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven miles and talked with me saying unto me come hither and i will show you show unto thee the judgment of the great that setteth upon many waters amen whom with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication amen may god bless his word you can be seated amen i want to go back to the third chapter because we know that this is the same woman jezebel found in the 20th verse of the second chapter notwithstanding i have a few things against he because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication amen so we see her already there causing his servants to commit fornication over in verse 2 of 17 he says that uh with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication now we know the prophet of god taught us that wine represents stimulation don't he i always wondered what would that what that could be you know and uh i suppose you know i suppose that there is a certain stimulation that comes with fornication all right to if you're evil and you got a bad spirit on you to actually cheat on your spouse or this side or the other and and there's perhaps some thrill that they get out of that hello something that goes along with that you know some kind of a simulation that people get you know and it's the same way spiritually it seems that certain people get certain stimulation out of actually uh you know defying god or coming against god amen and so but it has to be something that's very alluring to the world to the world let me say this this is just me but when we look at the book of revelations we find out one thing about the book of revelations that you really don't find near as much over in the new testament okay and that is plain talk right i mean it gets really specific right it talks about uh the filthiness of her fornication and so forth and and all of these things the abominations and everything he gets real and calls her a calls her little churches harlots and things like that getting real strong you know because you know brother bam said that the church goes up in the third chapter of revelation come back in the 19th so you know a lot of this here how many knows a lot of this is in the tribulation period of course after the blood is lifted is that right the blood is lifted already gone from the earth when god looks at sin in that right it look he calls it for what he is and he gets real plain in the book of revelations about what it is and we know the battle let me say this first of all that the battle and these language that he uses the mother of harlots and so forth you know he's not talking about the sinner as a matter of fact he don't talk all that much about the just unbeliever but he talks more about the make believer or what you call the antichrist or that which is so close that if it was possible it would deceive the very elected he deals with a church when he talks about a woman a woman who represents a church and she is the mother of holland she's the mother of churches amen tonight with the help of the law we also want to look at at what the prophet of god said and it was pretty startling because when the man gets real plain he says you can't have an education in anymore you know because it's of the devil you know a lot of time you send your kids to school unless they are really you know even nowadays you got to be very very careful amen you know because he said they'll come out twofold more a child of hell than what they went in and uh colleges of course we know they're nothing but this the absolute corruption all right and and everything that's being taught there and so he says education what did he say he says civilization and education and so forth and uh science and progress what he said is all of [Music] the devil now talk about civilization civilization as a whole everything all of this civilization this whole civilization first of all is of the devil amen and so we see here that it can satan everything here is going to ultimately talking about uh the mark of the beast and so forth and that squeeze that we talked about sunday how that it'll come to where people will lose things and i just read a quote today even better bam says he says you know there's going to come a day when they're going to put a sign on our door closed amen that's what he said about his own he believed that they would come and you know and it's right at that time you know we know that right at that time it's when the bride's gonna leave amen right during that screech during that time amen i believe that god is going to come and take us home praise the lord because god always takes care of his people don't he how many is glad for that and again we see that this is not a not not so much a uh you know dealing with sinners and so forth but it's dealing with with churches it's dealing with uh the mark of the beasts and so forth the mark of the antichrist dealing with the antichrist somebody something that looks like christ or churches in general isn't that right and i just put down here that you know sign civilization everything even even your money i want to say even your money is controlled by the devil all right now i don't want to say that it's of the devil because you know i wouldn't want anything in my pocket that was straight up off the devil now the love of money is the root of all evil how many knows that but it's controlled by the devil amen and if uh you know so people get the love in that and and so forth and um i want to do more reading but listen when you think about it you know it's going to come right down to it's going to come right down to that to where uh you know you won't be able to buy or sell unless you are taking the mark of the beast now i read a quote today brother adam's talking about the market beast he says the mark of the beast is going on right now it's happening right now he says the mark of the beast let me tell you what it is he says is to reject the baptism of the holy ghost [Music] tonight we talk about the judgment of the holy part with that thing you can't be associated with it you can't think like it thinks because i read a quote today he says you know it's not a tattoo on your forehead no it's knowledge it has to do with what you have knowledge of or believe or what you partake of he called it a deed either partaking of it and and you know whether it's sponsoring or be a part of it or to believe what it believes it's really something brothers and sisters if somebody comes and he somebody gossips to you and they tell you something about somebody and you believe that i'm here to tell you right now you will take a spirit that comes with that or you can choose to police say no i don't really believe that you know you know well i'll tell you what you keep the right attitude let's just pray for that person but if you leave an evil report well this comes just as i'm thinking here brother bram says even if you listen to gossip the holy ghost will go just for listening to gospel but what i'm trying to say the point that i'm making is same way with false doctrine because remember the three unclean frogs right the three unclean frogs they were a trinity doctrine and you get a you get a real trinity person that has that spirit of trinitarian on them and you try to tell them there's no three gods i'll tell you what they can get very angry they call you names call you antichrist and everything else and they get a real added there's a spirit that comes with that thing amen everything's just here so you know father son holy ghost and so forth hello it's a trinity false doctrine amen all right let's teach a little shall we so we see here let me put this down i've got to plumb up around my neck here all right all right first of all let's go to chapter 14 we want to start our top all right and that's that if you can do the search on brother branham he makes preference when he reads his scripture he makes reference to billy graham oral roberts and then the last of cage age messenger there's a third messenger he talks about that and you know the thing that we speak about here we we find so much of this all right well let me just leave that alone and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell upon the earth and to every nation notice billy graham and different ones went to every nation right preaching the gospel every nation and kindred and tongue and people sing with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come isaiah i believe it was i don't think i got it mark but isaiah let me let me just pick this up a little bit like i said if we could take a lot of time on these things but talking about now notice here he says the hour of his judgment is come how many believes that's where we're at we're coming right at the hour of this judgment i believe it just comes to mind how that brother banner if you remember he the spirit told him to pick up a rock and throw it up in the air right he talks about judgment he's going after it went up and came back down he said it created a whirlwind and it went north somewhere you know and a day or two later he says alaska like to have some and all up and down he says you know and from what i gathered it was like the beginning of judgment just i went after look all over the earth look at the tsunamis a couple years ago 500 000 wiped out just one after the other after the other you know but it's the hour i believe it's the hour of judgment amen not you know not the tribulation period but god's judgment and word now notice and worship him that made heaven and earth and sea and the mountains and waters now what i went to isaiah for for just a minute because jesus repeated this scripture but he didn't read all of it when he says the acceptable year of the lord and that's where he stopped it didn't go on the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek he has sent me to bind the brokenhearted to proclaim limiting the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound and to proclaim the acceptable year and right there jesus stopped and then he says but the bible says in that same one and the day of vengeance of our god wow see there's another message coming there's another part of that it has to be fulfilled the day of vengeance of our god how many believes that's upon the world and the tribulation will be the day of the vengeance of almighty god okay let's go on so he says that's right and he stops there all right that was pretty much that first angel's message and there followed another angel saying babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication amen and the third angel followed not only does the third angel follow them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb and the smoke of their torment ascended up forever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image boy if brother banham didn't clear that up he says that the beast of course we know is rome the image of the beast is the world council of churches all right or any denomination that rejects the word of god remember to reject one word of god but i heard him say he says your soul is hanging it's dangling over hell by one word you just break that one word it's all it takes because jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god what about all these people that are throwing a lot of it out go on god is not going to have a bride up there that disagrees with his word i mean that's not going to be an argument with us now what he says is true [Music] amen the wife can say no you're wrong but not with god because he always says the right and perfect thing amen hallelujah and here now notice so all those that receive his mark is going to be tormented so here's the patience of the saints and here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus christ amen now let's go on down and just keep reading here and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me right blessed are the dead to die in the lord from henceforth yea saith the spirit that they may rest from all their labors and the book and their works do follow them and i beheld a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown amen one set like unto the son of man having a golden crown and his in his hand a sharp sickle and another angel came out of the temples cried with a loud voice saying the ambulance out on thrust in thy sickle and reap for the time is come for thee to reap amen for the harvest of the earth is right how many believes that we're at harvest time we are at harvest time and god is going to reap one of these days all that he has bought and purchased and everything that he has sowed god is going to reap to himself all of his children of all the ages that's laying there under the altar how many know the prophet brother madam right now he's over there where he saw the vision of all those that he was shaking his hand never had going on before he's over there with that crowd but he's not with the crowd of irenaeus or martin or columba or paul he's not with that crowd isn't that the truth amen each one each age is gathered with their messenger amen like he says will paul have to answer yes he will you know they're over there they're gathered and they're waiting and and god is god is waiting to reap the benefits of what he did all that he's done i call it the finale i thought i call it almost the greatest event that's ever taken place in the in history because everything that god did from from the first star that he made the first thought that he ever had was to be with you and i how many believes that that was his heart's desires to be with his children and those who he has redeemed through the foolishness of preaching that believe his word how many knows church is powerful the word of god is powerful it just depends on if you receive it or not it all depends on how you're getting this amen praise be to god same way with the message of the hour it just depends on how you get it or not if you get it or not then it does you any good but god am in all of the ages see them all the way by the time surely we can sing like brother uh my mind jewel can't even think of jewel's name that's pretty bad won't it be a time oh yeah it's gonna be a time how many he's gonna be a time you know you gotta forgive me i get a little happy but you know it's just a little that foretaste a little bit a little bit of you know down payment we got the earnest how many believes you're sitting there with the earnest of the resurrection you already got the quarter you've already got part of it i'm looking forward to it you're looking forward to it and the one thing i didn't mention it just came to my mind so we'll pop back a little bit and go backwards because what we're doing is we're really looking at a christian looks at not the things that we see isn't that right but the things that we cannot see amen like paul said first second corinthians 2 and ii corinthians 2 and verse 18 while we look not at things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen brother bran and remember he got into this dispute with somebody one time and he says you know i won't believe anything that i can't see he's and you know if i can't see it it ain't real and brother bam says i prove to you that anything you can see is not real it's only the things that you can't see that are real and in other words for the word real would to be would be temporal because guess what i'm live here i'm going jesus but it's not real because in time i'd be dead in the grave gone hello and so forth it passes away it's temporal paul calls it but the love that i got that eternal life and the soul that you can't see that thomas that's on the ins that's real and see folks i'm here to tell you tonight if you don't get nothing out of the message tonight other than this remember this that we put too much emphasis on the things that we see not enough emphasis on the things that we can't see that are really real such as love the holy ghost and we have to remember to keep our eyes on god and the things that are eternal because these things are all everything is temporal we know that this is all getting shut down this is all going to be done one day this is going to be over with coming to church being here let me believe it's all going to be done it's going to be over with what then where are you going to be then amen that's why i love i love the lord because he promised us eternal life amen that temporal life but i want to just put that in there remember tonight that that's what we're looking at we're looking at eternal things and things that last forever and we're good looking at what i call the climax of satan and his kingdom i mean he has a climax we're coming that climax or as we're we called it here the reap for the harvest of the earth is ripe right so uh you know let me just say this this is my thought on it this is not what the prophet taught i don't even know what he taught that that certain certain scripture because i love to be able to go while brother ben said this about that scripture in revelations and that's that's what it is but if you didn't mention it guess what just have to and so to me he said that angel go and reap what you have go reap and i read this word it said it this way thrust in thy sickle and reap for the time is come for thee to reap it is time for you to reap the son of man on a cloud it's his time to read but verse 16 says and he had sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle and the earth was reaped and the earth was reap and in the conjunction another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also had a sharp cycle now here's another one now here's one group talking about perhaps the wheat and the tears and the angel came out from the altar which had power over fire and cried with a loud voice unto him that had the sharp sickle saying thrust in the icicle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth remember brother ben preached on two vines i mean there's two vines there's a false vine there's a true vine and here the bible says that this vines these vines have come to fruition now how many know the good vine is coming to fruition my question is is that you is that me are we coming to fruition are we coming to being right just like a fruit you don't want to take it you don't want to pluck it until it's right lord help us that we're right spiritually on the good side which means nothing less than this christ in you living out his life completely surrendered and the other vine how many knows it's coming to fruition let's look at what this one looks like and what happens to this one of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe i like that fully right let me tell you something when they can go when anybody can go into a school and shoot little four fourth graders fifth graders six innocent little children and slaughter them like dogs and just kill them like that that's right that's real right folks that's as evil as it gets in other words you're getting more evil and evil and evil and evil they've reached the pinnacle of their evil yeah the false mind is getting real ripe out they're coming to the fullness of what they are my and you think about that being in little kids because those are just 18 17 year olds i'm not sure how young they go of that what they do if that is those children think of the evil that is in the other greater people well i think it was los angeles where they had that shooter that was in the concert and killed all of those people just shooting them shooting them it's just show shows they're right if you oh my i hate to use walmart donna says you ought to use walmart if you want to see the world's ripe or not just go there amen we went today and and elena wanted to buy her mom a birthday present and so we went in the jewelry department and finally got somebody over there nice young lady except it was the greenest hair just craziest color and i was like i'm sure i want to say you really look prettier with your normal hair i shouldn't say that but i was thinking i was like where's she actually you look a lot better than that stuff but just think about how many knows the world is right right for judgment okay now gather them together how many knows those clusters those bind the bundles together for what the burning that right amen the tares get tied and bundled together that's exactly what's happening is that bundling now i i have a hard time to believe that but but that uh england and and france and a lot of those countries they're all already bundled up but they're coming after you and me to bundle us up also amen trying to make us a third we'll come all come subject to that antichrist amen because you're going to be in one bundle or the other how many believes it amen they're fully ripe and the angels thrust in his sickle in the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into hello didn't talk about the other people getting cast into anything up here but here it talks about cast them into a great wine press of the wrath of god now we know that ain't bright huh that's got to be that false vine anybody that doesn't have the baptism of the holy ghost in their soul so all those that have taken the mark of the beast amen all right and the wine press was trotting without the city and blood came out of the wine press even unto the horse's bridles let me tell you that's some deep blood in it by the space of a thousand six hundred furlongs my my my amen now we want to skip over to let me see here chapter 16 chapter 16 and verse 1. and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels if you there's so many sevens in here seven angels seven miles three woes and so forth seven angels go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth and the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and there fell a noiseman griezor upon the men amen which had the mark of the beast amen you think covets bad you wait until they get their sword it's going to be a whole different story upon them which worship his image and the second poured out his vial upon the sea and it became as blood of a dead man and every living soul died in the sea and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and upon the one uh the waters and they became blood let me tell you something how many please even the prophet god said in the tribulation period moses and elijah they'll do what they used to do call flies turn the water into blood and all these things huh elijah will call for to stop the rain there won't be no harvest for anybody it is absolutely inconceivable how bad the tribulation period will be you can't imagine it being that bad and i heard an angel of the wilder say the angels of the waters say our righteous lord which art i like that which was and which shall be i like that he's everything he's the fastest he's the future he's the present because thou has judged thus wow remember it's god's judgment upon the horde for they have shed the blood now notice who jesus they have shut the blood of saints and of prophets and thou has given them blood to drink for they are worthy and i heard another out of the altar say even so lord god almighty true and righteous are thy judgments how many believes that when he serves judgment upon the world it'll be just because brother josh was singing oh love of god how rich and pure how measureless and strong it shall for it could we within the ocean field were something of parchment made where every on earth aquila and every man ascribed by trade another word a writer by trade to write the love of god with drain the ocean dry god has had so much mercy so much mercy i was thinking today you know if god would just pour out some wrath if he just pour on some rest once in a while everybody probably respect him a little more and even the prophet said you know god sends wars and any time there's wars second world war everybody comes to church you know everybody is good but whenever he said whenever everybody's prospering doing good church is empty out that's about how it is when man has it easy because we're prone we're prone to you know do do things the last thing or be pushed into it aren't we amen that's thus comes to saying if it wasn't for the last minute i wouldn't get done we kind of wait for the last minute we wait until we're pressured into things before we do it let me tell you something don't live like that don't be like that not until you're pressured into it no do it out of your heart through god now yeah sure he could i i am convinced maybe this is me but i'm convinced that god could get everybody to repent or try to or think about it you know yeah he could but he doesn't want to force him to he doesn't want people like that living with him huh just like marrying a wife you wouldn't want a wife that you forced to marry to marry or be with you amen at least i wouldn't if you forced her to do it and you punished her and beat her and all of that other stuff i'd hate to sleep beside her ain't no telling what my amen is saying with the lord he wants people that love do it out of your heart because you love it not because of fear not because of punishment or because of hard times don't don't wait to you know serve the lord desperately just because of desperation don't wait for desperate do it now are you with me praise the lord so we find here in one place as we go through here we'll find it here you find once again that they shed the blood you can't do you can't shed the blood of a righteous man you can't even give a cup of cold water to one of god's children but we receive a reward you can't say a word against them you say a word against each other say bad things about a preacher on that day of judgment he'll say you are guilty of murder 500 times because that's how many times you killed the influence of a preacher you're a murderer just because you said a little something yeah that's how serious wash the lips how many believes it the bible says you're going to give a word for every idol word you said we give an account for every word you say i've said it before let me say it again ain't nobody getting away with nothing nobody gets away with anything it's all recorded amen aren't you glad to go to judgment we're in judgment right now we're in purgatory right now that's what the prophet said that's right purge getting purged lord take that we come to church and that the judgment paul peter said begins at the house of god we preach a word and you judge yourself and say god i'm guilty lord forgive me see there's still mercy with judgment here you can be given you can be put it on the blood and be gone but we need mercy's lifted there's no more mercy with judgment the bible says he's going to have judgment without mercy amen on that white throne judgment there will be people that are giving life eternal let many knows that you know why because you did this and you did that they'll be judged according to these all right you did so and so the prophet god said there'll be a lot of people giving life and and so forth because of the good deeds that they did to his children huh that'd be the sheep it says on the right and there'd be goats on the left be separated but they're gonna be look look i know you did this but i'm gonna forgive you no there ain't gonna be none of that over there you know otherwise there would be mercy with judgment he says he's funny in that judgment day there's no mercy there's only what you did or didn't do and he judges you accordingly and we don't want to be there don't ask me why but look up the quote where brother brown says i don't want to be at that white throne judgment pierce me through with hot wires and all kinds of different things he said do do this but don't let me be at that white zone judgment oh it's going to be a terrible day amen see folks our politicians and all these people are doing whatever they're doing they just don't realize hey they're going to have to give account they're going to receive judgment for everything they do amen all right but let's thank the lord for his grace and say lord if there's still something in your heart well i'll tell you what there ain't no way brother byler knew that but yet he touched that on my life right there you should say thank you lord you know because you're you're dealing with me on that spot and you want that gone because you have any sins if you have any sins like that you are you know you're gonna have to be judged with a amen because he's coming with for us pride that he's without spot without wrinkle amen search my heart of god see if there be any wicked way in me this is the hour of getting purged cleansed and so forth amen all right so now we're going to jump over to 17th chapter 17th chapter and there came one of the seven angels which had seven vials and talked with me saying on me i guess we this is the one we read earlier isn't it come here and i will show you the judgment of the great that sitteth upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication so he carried me away in the spirit in the wilderness and i saw a woman set upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman kick was was a raid in purple and scarlet couple cup color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having in her golden cup in her hand oh my full of the abominations and the filthiness of her fornication i don't know about you but that's just about every word that you could possibly come up with to describe a dirty filth and a that's what he sees her as but that's the truth that's what she is and upon her forehead was the name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth amen and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wonder with great admiration no doubt but outwardly perhaps she looked good all splendor in all glory but what's in her backyard a bunch of crosses a bunch of whole 68 million christians slaughtered in the most inhumane way think about this if that beast ever gets that power again that ultimate power that priest could tell the policeman arrest him and he would arrest him take him to jail i'll deal with him tomorrow that priest will be his judge and they'll decide what to do with him isn't that right churches going so forth they had the power they had more power than the cops or the local authority did amen we all know that it all goes back to roma right everything he goes back to rome think about this the catholic church is the only one that has ever survived the whole length of time huh rome fell greece different places fell all kinds of places fell but they endured that antichrist and it says it'll go you know another one will take its place and so forth and the last will take his place and go all the way into produce it's prophesied they would last but it's the antichrist all right i want to make sure i get to get down tonight and notice here i wonder with great admiration amen and of course now i'm not going to get into his seven hills it was sat on uh verse nine here's the mind that has wisdom it's on seven mountains two amount two different cities brother brown talked about in the world has seven mountains cincinnati i believe it was and then rome amen she said it's a pawn all right now let's go on to 18. let's just skip to some of this and go to 18. and after this i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory amen brother bannon makes reference to the message of the hour on this and he truly was how many knows he was absolutely lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice i wanted to play that song right about now remember remember that song it's the voice of many waters those little gospel preachers amen telling the story of the old rugged cross amen come out here we all remember that come out strong voice i like that it's inspirational it's the truth we had a strong voice amen amen strong voice saying babylon baptist methodist confusion which one's right 900 different ones you know what he said you're dead all of them did i heard them today say you know we're not in pentecost we're past the pentecostal we're in hardest time now praise be to god but he con consent told them all they were all fallen that's what he said it's fallen his fallen has become the habitation of homosexuals devils and people that hate you if you tell them the truth people that hate you if you tell them their denomination is of the devil denomination is absolutely why is it of the devil because they reject the word of god jesus can come right in front of him and madness and manifest himself like he did he walked the shores of galilee hundreds of times over and they still won't believe it you'll go to hell for that aren't you glad to be a believer i thank god to be a believer because i'll tell you what the bible says all whose names are not written in the book of life shall wander after that beast they'll take the mark of the beast if you're naming on there and if you aren't part of that you're going to take the mark of the beast somewhere along the road you're going to disbelieve the word of god amen yes you're going to do all right become the habitation of devils and hold of every foul spirit in a cage of every unclean and hateful bird people will just take anything amen they'll take anything into them churches for all nations notice this all nations how many knows were coming to a one world government it's going to be they're quiet about it but we're not fooled but yet we we don't we don't realize half of the things that go on behind the scenes brother john what they decide and what their what their agenda is right now uh you know my son mike and we'll talk about and they'll tell me he says they got it all fixed they let trump win last time just to give us a little reprieve they know what they're doing they're gonna do this side or the other i'm like well i don't know maybe devoted people does that's a little something they don't think it does but truly it is coming to it isn't that right surely it is true that that antichrist will come down and amen and just do what the bible says they're going to do all right all nations have drunk of the wine of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornications with her amen and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies who has the gold of the world rome does fort knox from what i understand is empty where's all that gold at huh many knows we are one busted nation we're busted i mean we are broke i mean completely broke i don't even know what the number is now it's in the 20 20 trillion something huh they just borrowed another eight almost another trillion 800 billion or so close to another trillion that's the second time didn't they do it a little bit earlier if it wasn't a trillion or something when they you know started and so forth you know where does it all come from probably your pocketbook is where they want to get it from but anyway we know that and and they're probably going to pay it back right you reckon they're going to pay it back now and they're going to have to go get different debt until the pope has to bail him out with all that gold he's got he probably has already promised look i'm gonna take care of you but you just make sure that this gets done and that gets on change this law and do this that's why our politicians they're absolutely inspired to do what they do you know those of us who are conservative hey we're just going along the road and enjoying the freedoms that we have but them folks they're inspired in doing what they there has to be something behind it and they're right somebody's pushing somebody and i'm here to tell you the whole world gathers you let the pope go into any country and i'll tell you what every preacher and everybody all the others get flocked to him amen brother brandon wanted to meet him one time he had he was going to meet the pope one day isn't that right he got in the room you all know the story he says now all you got to do is when you get up there is what is it kneel down and kiss his ring i just i'd like to meet the man i like to say hi dude pope i know you know how you doing or whatever talk with you but i am not kneeling in front of you and i ain't kissing no ring i said this little appointment is off he said ain't no way i'm gonna worship anybody no his feet stink just like mine he ain't no god i ain't gonna bow down him he's old and gonna die just like i am i want to go kneel to somebody that's immortal amen like jesus christ all right all right so now notice through the abundance of her delicacies got 10 minutes over delicacy and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out come out of her my people that you be not partakers of our sins remember this that's what you have got to be absolutely careful that you don't partake of virgins that's add to add to one add to to the word of god or take away from the word of god amen that's all you got to do because that's all eve did that's what she does that's what her children do that's what the churches do well we're going to we're going to have a church we're going to have a baptist presbyterian methodist whatever we're going to have amish men tonight or we're going to have tractors without steel wheels we can have rubber or we're going to have tire we know everybody has their own different doctrines he got a thing to do with christ and so forth huh put their own interpretation to it god goes right over the top of it all passes it right by comes and vindicates his word and proves what's right let me tell you let me tell us something we are an honor people today to have a vindicated and proven message of the message that god sent that you do not have to wonder whether it's the truth or not you gotta you have to know and i don't we all want to i want to know what my soul hangs on i want to know for sure amen okay come out of her that you cannot partake of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and god has remembered her iniquities reward her even as she has rewarded you and double it double it double onto her according to her works in the cup which she had filled filled to her double in other words she filled it with filthiness and abominations we're going to fill up the cup of the wrath of almighty god and we're going to pour it over and then we're going to pour another one full we're going to give her double how many knows mentions his mind saith the lord i will repay so much as she has glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment sorrow give her for she has said in her heart i see the queen and i'll never see a sorrow folks a lot of times that's what people do when they get all rich they think well i've got it made now huh sit back think i'm not going to see any czar don't you think you could be dead before morning amen and shall see no therefore shall her plagues come in one day in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burnt with fire for strong is the lord god that judges her amen brother baby says i'll prove to you that condom communism is working straight straight in the hands of almighty god now the quote said they're nothing but a hedonistic ungodly barbaric world or a nation that god has in her hands he says i'll tell you there's only one percent of russia that is communism the rest retards christianity but it's that one percent that rules right he says if it wasn't god's will if they weren't in the hands of god to do this he says those people would have overthrown russia a long time ago how many knows that all of all of these other countries you know uh over the middle east man if the people rise up just a little bit that whoever's president better run for his life it's done it's not hard for people to rise up in any government and overthrow it they could do it but i heard brother ram say but it's not the will of god to do it because he says they're in the hands of almighty god to destroy rome he says i this as i say this is god's prophet a russian empire will drop an atomic bomb of some sort on the vatican city and destroy it in one hour thus saith the lord he says and the bible said that god took them cruel hearted men and put them in his hands and there were instruments in his hands to fulfill his will and to bring back to her exactly what she had coming to her amen now notice strong is the lord that judges her the kings of the earth and that have who have committed fornication and live deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament her when they shall see the smoke of her burning standing afar for fear of torment saying alas alas the great city babylon that mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment come and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no mankind merchandise anymore the merchandise of gold silver precious stone pearls fine linen purple silk scarlet dying wood all manner of vessels of ivory all manner of vessels now listen fast men are vessels of most precious wood and brass and iron and marble cinnamon odors ointment frankincense wine oil flour wheat oh my think of everything that the bible is mentioning here that she supplies sheep horses chariots slaves souls of men the fruits that die so less than after are departed from thee i want to say this to everybody that has their heart and their minds on money and the lusts of money you remember if you lust after those things those things will depart from you one day amen don't you set your heart don't you set on your goal amen you take this whole world but give me jesus just take this whole world give me jesus amen amen departed from the in all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all the merchants and the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand off for fear of her torment weeping and wailing and saying alas alas a great city that was clothed in fine linen purple and scarlet hello and gold and precious stone and pearls for in one hour so greater riches to come the naught every shipmaster and all the country company of ships and sailors as many as trade but set off suited far off and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying that great city oh what city is like unto this great city and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing singing last alas a great city where where wherein were made rich all that ships into sea by reason of her costliness for in one hour she is desolate ma so just imagine how many of those everything that catholicism way back here everything nobody buys or sells all the things she has oh how rich she is got control of everything and the climax of all of that she's ever done in life comes to not in one hour blown all to pieces and gone how many knows brother bram said he's seen america also blow to pieces amen i don't know if he said russia but he did say that russia's got a bomb with louisville and this place and the other but somebody's going to blow us up all to pieces also amen folks that didn't have it it only had didn't happen one reason because it's not god's time but it's coming and all of that think about that the whole world all this richness all every every materialistic thing is going to pass away this economy the whole world's economy is all hinged on their goal how many know you they've got the goal of the world amen so all of our finances and things remember it's controlled by the devil amen it's controlled by it not that we can't have and so forth i want everybody to have life as good as you can as long as you can how many believes that but i'm here to tell you it'll all come to end and ultimately it points back to this guy right this people right here but now i like this next verse rejoice over her thy heavens and you holy apostles and prophets for god hath avenged on her vengeance is mine say of the lord i will repay and listen that judgment then that fire because you know they got atomic bombs that'll blow your mind kind of different word thing there but harashima if i'm gonna understand they got hundred like a hundred times maybe more it's enormous if it's not two hundred it was a large number of how did they have atomic bombs but abram i just heard today he says you know if they let them things loose and i i was listening to where he says you know how that russia has bombs that they can send up and they can send one to every major city that will put a whole 60 some feet in the ground and so many miles that it go out the power that's there already folks is just inconceivable almost it can certainly well i don't know if i can get this exactly right how many times over but i believe he said they have enough nukes and so forth to burn the old earth over every green glass green piece of green grass he says everything will be burnt over two three times i'm not sure the number i'm thinking two or three but it's multiple times amen but rejoice rejoice over her because god has venged you with him and the mighty angel took up a stone like a millstone and cast it into the sea saying thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down and shall be no more at all the voice of harpers the musicians the pipers the trumpets shall be heard no more at all in the craftsman and whatsoever craft tb shall be found any more in thee the sound of a millstone shall not be heard anymore at all in thee the light of a candle shall not even shine at all all the way down to a little candle and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries we're all nations deceived wow and in her was found the blood of the prophets and of the saints and all that were slain upon the earth you'd be amazed at how much she is behind wars and things how many how many times you all read whenever the pope says stop fighting that war ends huh if he's got power to stop wars what about starting him in closing we'll let you go home and get some sleep no you got to work tomorrow after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven weeping and wailing no they were saying hallelujah hallelujah after the earth is burned amen ah come on mother david hallelujah [Music] sing it [Music] lord we praise you lord we praise you lord we praise you lord we praise you hallelujah you love him don't you just love his atmosphere stand with me musicians if you'll come such a different picture such a different picture in

doesn't really mean this that doesn't really you whoremonger you prostitute huh that's what it is committing spiritual fornications against the word of god that's all that's all it right down to that and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said hallelujah [Music] [Music] yeah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] lord we praise you yes lord we pray you oh lord we praise you
