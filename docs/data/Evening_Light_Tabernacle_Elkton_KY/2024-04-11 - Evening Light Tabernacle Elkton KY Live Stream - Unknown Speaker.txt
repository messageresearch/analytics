Lord would have me to speak there and and just want to be a blessing anywhere we go so if you would turn in your Bibles tonight and we'll get right into the word I don't want to hold you long tonight I know it's a midweek it's been a dreary day and we're probably tired and and try to ease into this tonight if we can but turn in the in the scriptures to the Book of Luke chapter 15 and while you're turning there I want to read you a little quote that I come across and and um it it it goes with the service tonight but it it really I just found it out of out of uh I just found it in passing and I thought it was good but the prophet said God does everything in threes he wrote three Bibles he had three coming of Christ there's three dispensations of Grace there's the three manifestations of one one person in the godhead all those things he said now like Jesus came the first time he's been here once hasn't he he says he come to redeem his bride he comes the second time to receive his bride to catch her up in a meeting in the air and he comes the third time with his bride as king and queen aren't you looking forward to that day as king and queen he says see there's also three uh three uh there's three also there's three manifestations of God God manifested himself once in the fatherhood as he led the children of Israel next time God manifested himself in sunship the Lord Jesus Christ the third time God manifested himself is with us now the Holy Spirit see three manifestations everything in threes how many knows God's numbers three amen so as you you're in Luke chapter 15 we're going to read a portion of scripture here and uh we'll read a few verses if you got it say Amen am all right we're all on the same page then Drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him and the Pharisees and the scribes murmured saying this man receiveth Sinners and eateth with them so look at the look at the attitude here we got these Pharisees and these scribes these he highminded and and Hy and and they're full of Pride and they're full of arrogance and and and they're sitting here and they're beginning to looking they trying to judge Jesus on this and here Jesus is and it says he spake this Parable unto them now watch now he's he's fixing to give them three different illustrations but it's still one Parable all the three make one so watch what he does here he says what man of you having aund sheep if he loses one of them does he leave the 9 and9 in the wilderness and go after that which is what lost until he finds it so here you got sheep you know if you know anything about sheep you know sheep are dumb sheep are real dumb animals I raise them and I've told you before they live to die when they B when they're born they lay there and they try to find every way they possibly can to die and so here the scriptures telling us that a sheep who is no doubt straight away from the rest of the flock and so this sheep that maybe he was just eating grass and he was in the congregation and he was eating and nibbling and he was right there with all of his brothers and sisters and he just begins to kind of get over here and pay attention exactly where he's going in life and he finds himself in darkness and now come all around him he thinks man I'm all by myself I'm all alone I have strayed away and the Bible tells us that this Shepherd is going to leave all 9 and N to go and get this one watch what he says and when he has found it aren't you thankful to be found when he found it he didn't put a halter on it he didn't lead it back and say come on you dumb animal no he picks it up a healthy Wella body sheep he picks it up throws it over his shoulder and he begins to tote it back rejoicing God won't let you stay out there and stray away he'll put you on his shoulders he'll carry you all the way he can he's going to get you where he wants you to be and when he cometh on he cth together his friends and his neighbors and his brothers and the sisters and the congregation and the pastor this is a big event he calls them together saying Rejoice with me Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was what lost I say unto you that likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than the 9 and N just persons that need no repentance so here we see God the son the Redeemer of those that was lost go on down to verse 8 and here's where I'm going to get my text tonight either that woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece does not light a candle and sweep the house and she does what she seeks diligently say that seeks diligently she seeks diligently till she finds it and when she has found it she just sat around and said well finally she she just she just closed the door and and was quiet no it says when she found it she cth her friends she calleth her neighbors she call us the sisters of the church the congregation the pastor the deacons you say well you're adding that in We're All in This Together are we on are we all making this one race together sure we are so we why would we not call everybody say rejoice with me I found that now that I lost what Satan tried to take from me I seek until I found it and I got it [Applause] back and when she had found it she called her friends and the neighbors together saying Rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I had lost so here is God the Holy Spirit the light now lighten the way through the Holy Spirit to find that which is lost W you go ahead and have your seats for time sake we're going to just illustrate the last one for you may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word his word is great and greatly to be praised and in the last one we see the the uh prodal we see the prodal son the the lost son as it said so we have a lost sheep a lost coin a lost son and we know that that prodical son he went out there he decided that his wasn't good enough for him anymore he decided he wanted to do it his way he decided he wanted to live the life he wanted to live even though he knew right he knew wrong he knew the limitations of God he knew the limitations of house he decides I'm going to do it my way so he finds himself straying out and going out on his own all by himself only to find out he's made a mockery only to find out he has turned himself away from a from the life he once knew the good life into a life now that is that debauched and ridiculous to the point that he has to come crawling back to his daddy and say just make me a servant whatever it takes just get me back in the house God the Father so here we see God does things in threes first he speaks of the love of God the the son the god uh second he speaks of the love of God the Holy Spirit third he speaks of the love of God the father and I'm going to message my uh title my message tonight if I could lost lost did you hear what I said lost now lost that's a that's a terrible condition to find yourself in if you lose something it it's a terrible place to be how many's ever lost something that you that you had maybe in your pocket or something you knew you put somewhere and you go to get it it's not there it's lost and it's a bad feeling when you start thinking about that and I want to look tonight at this woman and I want to focus on the coin that was lost in the second part of this Parable and if you look at the definition of the word lost it's something that has been taken away or cannot be recovered usually we lose things we begin to get a little bit stressed over it we begin a little panicked we get a little anxiety built up on it I'm talking about items I'm talking about pocket knives I'm talking about car keys I'm talking about those kinds of things but there are people who actually find themselves losing their identity and they have an identity crisis and they begin to lose their identity and maybe we sit here tonight some of you maybe have sat here and you think man maybe sometimes I feel like I have completely lost my identity who am I as a Christian who am I in the gospel who am I to God where is my place who am I maybe you feel like you've lost your identity maybe you have no idea what you want in life maybe you have no idea that and you look around everything's falling apart and you have no idea even who you are anymore this is a real this is a real [Applause] problem tonight by the grace of God we're going to find out how to fix it God don't want people losing their identity and if you you sit here and you look at identity crisis it could be something as simple as people ask you what you want for dinner and you think I don't know this is serious business you can find yourself in a place where people may ask you what is your song what's your favorite color what's your favorite car what's your dream car and you look at them with with a glaze across your eyes I don't know you don't know who you are anymore you've lost something and you're trying to gain it back you're trying to think what in the world did I lose why am I not the person I once was why is this void here and why is my life vacant has you ever been there yeah some of us have and we find ourselves there what is it it's the thing that once made you has gone missing think about that the very thing that made you who you were before you lost your identity has gone missing now how many Christians do we have here tonight amen you know I was reading what brother Brown was talking about he was fixing to preach on the prodical son and he began to preach on the prodical son and he said you know what he said I don't really know why I'm preaching this because everybody here is saved there's no Sinners here but I'm preaching on a prodical son something that you once made you has now seemingly missing you've lost something on the inside you've lost something that gave you drive you've lost something that gave you passion you lost something that you that made you care about things so much that now You've Lost That Care You've Lost That desire You've Lost That passion brothers and sisters and when that happens in our life begin to see that sin begins to creep in and that's when you find ourselves we begin to start falling short in our walk with God and and we see that sometimes these things have gone missing and the very thing that made us who is what what is what we are is missing and the prophet preached the message the second coming of the Lord he read this portion of scripture in Luke when he preached the second coming of the Lord and he said now I want you to think about this he says now it may seem like a very odd scripture for the second coming of Christ but it's speaking of the second coming of Christ so let scripture that on the parable what is it actually talking about brothers and sisters it's speaking about being ready it's speaking about having things in order it's speaking about having your eyes dotted and your tees crossed it's speaking about living your life to the fullness of the word of God and living by the fruits of the spirit living a life that is full of love and joy and peace and longsuffering it's talking about living a life that is that is full of gentleness and and faith and meekness that's what he's talking about and he said this great subject here as we get into it now he said it's one of the most vital subjects in the entire Bible and he's speaking about this tablet and he's talking about the coming of Christ the two in my mind don't line up as I begin to look at it I'm thinking what in the world how is he taking this scripture about this young lady losing a coin out of her headdress out of her tablet and how is he tying it to the second coming of Christ but he says there's nothing as important as the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ if he doesn't come we've been found as false Witnesses our dead that's in the grave they're perished there's no hope left for us if Jesus didn't come the second time watch what he goes to talking about next I'm just I'm just going to paraphrase this but he begins to talk and he says he talks about the rumors of wars and he begins to talk about earthquakes and listen he says Moscow and the missiles that they could place on the Fourth Street in Louisville Kentucky and he goes on to talk about the Fig Tree is putting forth her Bud now listen to what he says next and get a hold to this this sounds like we're reading yesterday's newspaper he says and have you been noticing in the paper that we the United States are taking sides with the Arabs and he says the handwriting is on the wall whoever blesses Israel will be blessed and whoever curses Israel will be cursed he says we're at the end time we are here and there is no way to stop it why is he tying these two illustrations together why is he talking about the end time and he's talking about this woman why because he want to make sure that that bride of Jesus Christ has herself ready she's made herself ready she has every bit of her tablet is in order she's not missing a piece she's not living just any old way she's not claiming Christianity and living a different life and he's trying to tell you it's so important to have yourself ready he says we're at the end time you can put an aisen Howard in every County and it would never stop it he says Jesus said these times would come we're here that's his words we're here we're right here at the verge of this it's later than we think so brothers and sisters we don't come to church just to occupy a Pew we don't come to church just to hear Fancy preaching we don't come to church just to hear good music or good singers we like those sure we do we go to clap we ought to praise but we come to make sure we find ourselves ready we come to make sure that we're checking up time we come to make sure that God is moving in our lives and we're not letting anything go [Applause] lost Jesus says he Likens us to a to a woman he says and in our subject tonight he says we found this woman and her husband had gone out so imagine this woman now she's sitting there a newly a newly married the Young Bride is sitting there and she's going about her business and she's taking care of the house chores kisses her sweetheart goodbye for the Day's Journey and she's sitting there and she's going there and all of a sudden as she's going through chores she begins to notice that she has lost one of the coins out of her tablet so let me ask you married sister something if you were to lose your engagement set all you married sisters got one yeah okay there you go all right I'm just making sure we're where're where we're supposed to be if you lose that engagement set how would that make you feel how would that make you feel if you lost that engagement set you no doubt you begin to feel hurt you begin to feel nervous you begin to feel feel maybe some depression and you'd be filled with sorrow and the pain of losing that ring would be devastating to you ladies not because of the monetary value some of you's Diamond may not be much bigger than a of sand it's not about the monetary value thank God for that I told my wife here a while back I said you know honey I already to try to find you a a new new set new engagement and we'll get you a new set a little bigger I don't need that she said this is just fine I said praise the Lord I like what I found but that ring it's not about the monetary value but it's it's because of the love that it represents between you and your husband he was attracted to you and he began to date you and he began to love you and he began to make memories with you and he made a commitment to you because you were everything he was looking for in a and so that engagement set that we're talking about that wedding ring that he gave you it's significant in the and that it matches the character and which he saw in you you were something special for him to put that ring on your finger am I right man you better say Amen it's going to be a long ride at home but you were something special he saw character in you and he he placed that ring and and the lady when she see when she accepts that ring she signifies to the bridegroom or the husband that you will always love him right man y'all ought to be a lot louder y'all quiet that she will always love him she'll cherish him in sickness and in health you've heard these before for richer or for poor you'll be committed to him till death do you part so when that ring was placed on your fingers it now signifies and it tells the whole world that that is Miss pal that's who she is Miss Langley that's Miss Wade Miss Bor when you wear that ring it signifies that there's been an identity change to take place then now you belong to to someone you don't see the man put on a ring until the final day right but that woman then once she puts on that ring it tells the world that you're off limits and so the prophet that's why he said if a if a woman is married now this may step on a toe or two but if a woman is married she should wear a wedding ring as a sign she's married I've seen some that don't I think you should he said you should he said because what that does it it keeps other men from having anything to do with her he said and they look and they see that she is a married woman so brothers and sisters the fruits of the spirit are displayed in the life as you put on that ring you begin to display who you are and this tablet displays who you are and and as you put it display the fruits of the spirit in your life it tells Satan that this vessel is taken this vessel is off limits this vessel cannot be touched amen you see back in those days they didn't have wedding rings they had a tablet and this tablet was either worn across the headband or it was a necklace that they wore around their neck you've seen pictures of the Jewish girls and they have those little gold coins hanging around a band right you've seen those right that's not just a part of costume jewelry that means they're taken that's the tablet that's the headband that the prophet's talking about and so he says it has 10 coins in it those coins were dramas and those dras were worth each about about a day wage each so you can figure about 10 days Wages that's not much of a value on a diamond ring is it like I said it wasn't about the value of the tablet it was about the ation that went along with it it was about the sincerity of what it meant to him it meant that this was a married woman and no man was the fool with them no boys were to FL with them because they were married and brothers and sisters that was their identity and the prophet said each one of those coins meant something and he says that those coins that were in place they meant a certain virtue to a woman the first one meant her love to her husband and he said the second one meant that she would pledge her virt you to live clean for him and he said the third and the fourth and 5ifth and 9th and 10th it goes on on and he says but I want you to listen close here I want you to listen real close because this is why we needed a prophet of the hour a messenger to come and bring us and break open the word of God not only in marriage and divorce and serpent seed and godhead and water baptism but in the simple things that we get overlooked and the church world overlooks the church World here they say that the woman in the parable represents the Holy Ghost that's what the church world says that the woman in the parable represents the Holy Ghost looking for a for a lost soul what the prophet said he said if you look it up look in Galatians 5 and he said you will find out that that woman represented the church and woman rep and that woman represents the church and the church as an INSP Ed wife to Christ boy that changes the whole perspective of that Parable doesn't it yeah sure it does and and he says the the tablet and the church is supposed to wear is found in Galatians 5 which is love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience can you see those coins now do you see what they represent to the Bride of Jesus Christ do you see why it's so important that we take this Parable we look at and say let the holy fill my life so that I can find whatever I've lost if I've lost my joy I need to find it if I've lost my peace I need to find it let's just turn to Galatians 5 oh we're moving good tonight there's a hair on me and I tell you what it's like a hair and a biscuit that thing won't come off Galatians 5 this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh isn't that something all you got to do is walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so if you're walking in joy and love and peace and longsuffering and meekness and gous patience kindness if you're walking in all those that's what the spirit is Right ain't that what God said he was that's what the spirit is so if you're walking that you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh the prophet said there's two factions on the earth the believer the unbeliever the one of the Lord is coming to receive the on is of the Lord is coming to condemn he said at his coming the one he will bless the other one he will curse so here These two factions are for it says for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these two are contrary to one another so you can imagine Satan shoots a dart at you and the Holy Ghost puts a shield up to deflect it as long as you're behind the shield of the Holy Ghost living in the spirit of Christ Satan can shoot dart after Dart after Dart and he will never get by The Shield of the Holy Ghost yes you shall not walk and fall to the lust of the flesh so let him shoot he's going to shoot brothers and sisters I don't care if you're 15 25 55 95 or 105 Satan is going to shoot darts at you now the works of the flesh are manifest and these are uhoh adultery fornication uncleanly lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath Strife seditions heresies envyings murdering drunkenness revelings man that don't sound like the kind of guy I want to hang around with that guy right there gets you in trouble that guy right there take you down roads and streets that you don't want to find yourself down and watch what he says the like such are the like of those which I tell you before as I as I have also told you in times past they which do such things might make it end no that's not what it says they that do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God so if you find yourselves in this kind of attitude it's this Pharisee sadducee scribe kind of attitude prideful arrogant full of hatred you're better than every everybody nobody can do nothing right you're so critical of everybody you know the Pharisees were some of the most critical people there were if you find yourself there doing these things you shall not inherit the kingdom of God but I love it when the when the when the word puts a butt in there but the fruit of the spirit is love and joy and peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith faithful Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law praise the Lord he says if we live in the spirit let us walk in the spirit you say what do you mean by that that means everywhere you go you're displaying love everywhere you go you're displaying Joy amen that means on your job in Fr of all them Burly men you're showing love you're showing Joy you're showing peace why CU that's what God gave to you at school wherever you go you're walking like that you say well brother if if I that they're going to laugh at me if I do that that they're going to call me crazy they're going to call me a fanatic they're going to call me a holy rer well I'll tell you what if you continue to do that one of these days they call you gone they're not going to see you anymore because they're going to be here you're going to be there there's going to be a Rapture to take place and you won't be there anymore they won't be able to call you nothing that be saying where is he at he ain't showed up for work in the last 20 days he must have got another job now he got another body so that's why the prophet when he preached this message the second coming of Christ he said there ought to be a time right now that the church ought to take inventory and find out what coins she's got amen you say well I I got most of them we'll find out that ain't good enough well I I got everything but but I've got everything but patience man I tell you what that longsuffering patience I tell you that ain't good enough we're living in a tremendous time and and the Very halts and clouds of destroying civil civilization is hanging over the Earth and he said it's a tremendous time when there's wickedness and people just go to church for a sham people go to church to try to hide from their meanness people people go to church to try to profess Christianity and live like the rest of the world doing everything drinking smoking gambling women and moly dress wearing clothes they ought to be wearing in their own dressing room out on the streets notice he said clothes that they shouldn't be wearing in their own dressing rooms out on the streets and he said andly love is a thing that's passing huh now I don't think he's talking to this church because I know I I've seen a love and I've seen a compassion and I've seen a brotherly kindness that is that has begin to take over and sweep through this church like it's never been seen before God is doing something special God is doing something special in this last hour and if you haven't seen it open your eyes and get yourself ready because it's not brother and sister he says we have not lost one coin but we've practically lost every one of them can you imagine being in the seat when he was preaching that message to the people and he said here's this woman and it's getting night he said and remember her husband would return you say well like I said I've got most of them I just don't have patience I I don't have longsuffering you know I I I'm I'm pretty good and and and I'm kind of Meek huh that husband would return if he found her without one of those coins it showed she had been marked not virtuous not pure not spotless not holy but it showed she had been marked a harlot one coin you say why love so important you see why patience is so important why longsuffering is so important is show that she had been marked a a har it show that she had defiled herself it showed that she'd been seen by the people brought before the priests and somebody had witnessed this and that she had been a married woman and they would take the tablet and rip the coin out of it it showed that she had mared herself you mean when we lose just one full Spirit it shows that we've been un faithful to our Lord Jesus Christ that's a different perspective isn't it just one tablet one fruit and he said he she said he said she was be getting along towards the dark and she realized that she had lost this thing and it was time for her husband to come in and it was getting late what was she to do how are we going to find what we've lost it's getting late in the hour and you say I don't have enough Joy I don't have love I I don't have these things you're talking about what am I to do he say she lit a candle come on here's where your Holy Ghost comes in it says she lit a candle and he said not only did she light a candle but she got a room this woman in business yeah not only did she light a candle but she got a bloom and she says he says she went to house cleaning she went to sweeping the Brom back and forth she was cleaning house trying to find what she had lost and brothers and sisters she began to ask herself is my life full of love unconditional if not get out of here Satan is my life full of joy unspeakable come on if not get out of here Satan and she began to sweep and sweep and sweep do I have that peace that passes all understanding get out of here Satan I won't quit till I thought it I'll take the C down I'll tear the fans off the ceiling I'll tear the lights out I won't quit until I find what's God god-given [Applause] right she wanted these things so she began to clean and clean and clean trying to find out what she had lost amen and the prophet says so if there ever was a time of a lightning needed of a candle he said to send forth that Gospel Light that Holy Ghost back into the church not for emotion no he said it wasn't for emotion it's not for that it's not for some Fanatics or some Fantastics or for some emotional workup or a jump for joy but it is a heart searching experience where men and women come to the Altar and they get right with God let me tell you you get right with God you'll be a you get full of joy you'll dance a little bit you get full of love and peace you'll jump and you'll shout a little more than you did [Applause] yesterday brother and sisters this ain't about dos and don'ts no it's not about dos and don'ts and emotions but it's about the quality of the character in that tablet It's My Life on display it's your life on display lit that candle to give her a little light and every candle in the ought to be lit tonight he said not only that but she got a broom and the neighbors could see the dust of flying when's the last time the neighbors seen our dust flying and saying I won't give up until I get it God she didn't want to be called a harlot I don't want to be called Falling short I don't want to get down there on that day and God look at me and say oh you've done so well you've made so many strides in life but now here I can see you just don't have joy you allowed Satan to take your joy where's your love I don't want to be there on that day and God look at me and say that but I want to find myself ready and work and free and seek God [Applause] I want that tablet to be on display for the entire world to see he says the church is loling I thought it was a misprint I've heard of L Lolly gagging but he says they're Lolly and I looked it up it means to sit to hang down in a relaxed informal or uncontrolled way or a waste of time he says the church has no conscience anymore that's where we got to be careful that when we come to church it's a Growing Experience not trying to grow numbers sure we want to see people come in every day I wish every Pew every seat in this Pew in this building the balcony standing in the foyer I wish it was full of people if they're willing to search and seek and find God if they want to change if they want a life full of love and peace and joy in longsuffering but numbers is just numbers souls are [Music] souls we can't lose our light we can't lose our Holy Ghost he said the Lutheran Church lost those the methodists the Pentecostals they lost theirs he said but we're at the endc the coming of the Lord and his house cleaning time she she she was doing a real spring cleaning might we say this was so important she she began to scour it say she took down the swept Down the Walls she took down the cobwebs and she kept on until she found what she had lost brother and sisters she was determined not to quit until she could grab a hold of what made her who she was because she knew this tablet was her life on display for the whole world to see and tonight without all of the fruits of the spirit on display in our lives we can't fully display God yeah because let me just tell you let me guarantee you this one thing you can do everything right but the moment that you lose your temper you're marked that's right you can do everything right you can be as patient you can be as gentle you can be as Meek you can be as humble you can be as loving but you come in that back door sold up like a a frog eating buck shot you're marked brother Steve you seen them before had you yeah yeah we see them when you're up here you see those things let me just tell you where I smile yeah when we when we up here we see a lot of things let me tell you just having one fruit ain't enough God's not looking for an apple he's not looking for a banana he's not looking for a grape you seen those fruit baskets that everybody loves to get at Christmas got that big old cellophane around it every about 10 or 15 fruits in there ain't it you get an apple an orange a grapefruit a tangerine some bananas grapes apples you did it all that's what God's looking for he's looking for the total package in this hour somebody who lived it all not just a portion so how do we get we light up a fire with the Holy Ghost and we start sweeping amen this anger that you got in your life it's got to go this Grudge that you're holding against somebody it's got to go because you won't go any farther in Christ until you sweep it out of the house and fill it with love you know the funny thing I found out the hard way man I tell you I'm going to give you my testimony here before we call close but I found out you know those people that I held such grudge against and anger against and and I lost sleep hours of sleep over people they sleeping like babies it didn't matter to them they didn't care they didn't even know and here I was I tell you what if I could put my hands around their neck I I took a life out of them we need to ask the Holy Ghost to come in and examine us from day to day show us what we're falling short tear us tear tear the house apart God loves you so much that he'll tear the house apart he'll turn it upside down to help you find what you have need of you say he' do that for me you mean he would do that for me yeah you know why because you matter every one of us sitting here matter to God you matter to each other whether you think it or not you're somebody even though you think you're a nobody all theing sometimes we just think we get lost in the shuffle and like brother JW wowy wowy woo yeah we just get lost in a shuffle God doesn't know me I I I'm Just a Nobody with all the multitude of the people around and and God God sees all these other people he he don't even know I exist well let me tell you he does know who you are he does know what you have need of he does know your desires and he even knows your very thoughts amen now I told you I was going give you a little bit of a testimony and I'm going to share some personal personal stuff with you stuff that I've held on and kept and I hadn't told nobody I didn't W hurt nobody and I'm not going to say anything tonight in a hurtful way but it's my testimony and it deserves to be spread and it deserves to be shared for what God has done for me I started preaching at about 25 years old and this is not to to lift myself or pick any scabs anywhere so don't think don't take it that way it's not for that but it's to give glory to God and expose Satan for the for the for the things he does in people's lives because if it was me yesterday it may be you tomorrow that's right and I started preaching about 25 years old just young and things were going really good we were here brother B was our pastor and sister Donna from the time we were 16 right they came about the time I started coming to church 16 years old he took the church so about 25 I I felt the call and I began to minister the word and things were going good and and and friendships were being made I I got to I got to KN ministers really close ministers are prominence around the message and they're still my friends dear friends but I'm going to show you how Satan works and I felt my Ministry was growing and that God was going to use me fast forward 10 years and that same Ministry that was growing and doing so well the wheels fell off of it it collapsed it was like a house of cards if I could use that illustration you pull that one card and it folds on you and Satan began to attack me and hit me from every angle that you could imagine even to the point of my health friendships people rumors hatred envies jealousies at me me being young still at the time I allowed Satan to take my love for the people you say that's hard to say you better believe it's hard to say but I allowed Satan to come in and take and just steal away my love for people and he took my joy and he took my happiness he took my joy he took my happiness and serving him and serving others I had no longsuffering you done me wrong I tell you what you're damned to hell no longsuffering and he took it all he gripped it and he took a hold of it not only did he take my love for people but he be to replace it with hatred and anger terrible anger you say that don't sound like you it wasn't me you're right that wasn't me that wasn't me at all but I had lost some coins in my tablet I had lost some coins in my tablet and I allowed Satan to come and take portions of who I was and he made me an incomplete Christian and with this hatred I'm being honest with you don't hold it against me learn from it with this hatred there was times if somebody would have pushed my button the wrong way I would have killed him people hurt me they hurt my family they hurt my children they hurt my wife and you want to talk about a bowl up inside of you how could that happen where was my joy where was my peace where was my love where was my servitude for the people that I love so much and now I hated them for the next 10 years brothers and sisters I wasted what time God could have been using me full of hatred and Malice and and I can remember how many watched the youth services at Louisiana some of you a couple of you some of you did some of you well anyway I'm going to tell you what happened and and and this is going to I'm going to show you how God brings things around so we for 10 years I hated that those the hated people and I was wallowing in anger and I was wallowing in blame and I was wallowing in negativity some of you it's been hurt bad know where I'm talk where I'm going it it's such a terrible feeling because that's not you and you don't want to be that way and I can remember I called brother Ron Spencer and I don't remember much about the conversation but I can remember I was unloading to him I was looking for somebody to vent to and for somebody to take my side well you know he's a pretty wise fell he didn't take nobody's side he didn't even make an offer I thought man what kind of buddy are you this was my this was my one of my my biggest Confidant I I loved this man I looked up to this man I respected this man no words of wisdom so after years of misery and holding on to these and I think my wife would say it's okay to say this she held on to is worse maybe it's worse than I did but you know we come to a place and I said you know what this is not working this is not us this is not who we are we've allowed Satan to Rob us we've allowed Satan to Rob us of our freedom we've allowed Satan to Rob us of our love not only our love but the love of Christ the love of church the love of the message and it was robbing my children and we needed a change so we we decided there at one point we were going to go to a denominational church I'm not going to name the denomination man they they were good they had good singing the preacher preached good messages man it don't feel us when you've been eating Eagles food come on scratch grain don't taste too good that's right but we Toler why because we couldn't look at people so we did that for a while and we said you know what we we we can't continue to do this we we know better so we begin to find ourselves and we we begin to make a decision where can we go we couldn't come here and still too many hurt feelings and if you go somewhere and you got anger there's no need in going that's right come on brother Steve thanks for helping me I'm glad somebody else knows where I walked you can't go there because there's anger in the every little word to S I know he's putting that right in me I'll tell you what if I could just so we decided we go to Murphysboro two hours away two hours every Sunday for 2 years and people thought we were crazy man behind behind the closed doors you could hear the Mings I don't know why they going over there they go to church just down the road I don't know why they're going over there they go over here I don't know why they're going over there looks like they get over this two years for two hours every day you say well well why why did you have to go there because we were hurting so bad we needed a trauma unit you know sometimes as Christians we get hurt so bad that just going to church ain't enough you got to have somebody that can that can look at you through a different set of eyes who can go through an MRI who can look through an x-ray who can go through there and fix the bones that are broke and the wounds that are deep and gashing and [Applause] bleeding so we had to go somewhere that we could not that we could not point fingers at anybody and slowly over the next two years under the ministry of the Holy Ghost God began to call us talk to us to me that anger I began to realize there was really not that much to be angry about it was mistakes everywhere it wasn't me it wasn't them it was us and I begin to realize that if I could forgive them I might be able to love them and if I could love them the way I used to I might be able to have joy back in my life and so we begin to do this and we begin to go there and I begin to get there and I thought you know what I know during this I know beyond a shadow of doubt I never lost my calling I never lost my Christianity I was still a child of God but I just didn't have all the goods you think he saved me to lose me did he save you to lose you no no matter what you go through it's just a Turning Page it's a turning point and so we begin to find ourselves we begin to move forward and we begin to find out that there was there was longsuffering after all and what I begin to find out is I begin to find out that there was more longsuffering than had ever been before because I realize that even though we're Christians even though we're filled with the Holy Ghost even though our lives are supposed to walk in a certain way full of love joy peace longsuffering gous meekness kindness we're human and until that human element is gone we're going to have these doarts thrown at us so slow we begin to find ourselves want to get back in church and so I want to do something for the Lord I'm feeling good I'm ready I'm I'm want to preach but you know what we're driving two hours I can't be there on Wednesdays what kind of preacher can preach if he can't be at church ever service so God says to make a decision you're going to have to go back and face people is this all right you're going to have to go back and face people yeah I can never forget the anxiety when we walk through those doors will they accept us were they foged no it was brother so time time begins to go on and and and you know that that calling that I had that that that God give me is want is want to is want to manifest but yet I'm still a little bit on this outskirts of trust you know when somebody's been hurt trust is sometimes a hard thing to gain back so I didn't want to say nothing I don't want to do nothing but I have a Praying Wife Andrew Glover come here to preach I stayed home I didn't I didn't I didn't want to come I was still in that battle I want to do it I know I got to do it I know I need to do it I need to be there but yet I still not just quite ready and she comes up for prayer when Andrew Glover was here this was several years ago and they prayed and prayed and prayed that I would find myself that I would get back into the pool pit that I would be preaching again that that we would get back full of love and joy pece and longsuffering and he gave her a handkerchief now I don't know if she stuck it under my pillow I don't know if she tied it to my socks I don't know if she held on to it or what she done with it but for a year a year and a half two I don't know two years she held on to that prayer cloth to that handkerchief until one day I told Brother B I said brother B I think I'm I think I'm ready if you'll if you'll have me I went home we talked about it Andrew Glover was supposed to preach the next week here so we get ready for church come Sunday I didn't know about this handkerchief now you know women do things they secret she comes up to him and she says here take this what am I supposed to do with that I don't need that you give it to Andrew Glover and tell him it's finished she said he prayed for you he prayed for you he prayed for you and he gave me this this anointed cloth and told me to continue to pray for you until you find yourself back in the pull pit I come to church walked through that door walked up this steps like I owned the place walked right through that door I said here this is yours I don't need it [Applause] anymore can I give 10 more minutes fast forward to this year Louisiana camp that camp was for one person me you know it don't matter preachers want to preach right preachers want to share preachers want to help Friday night yes Friday night they had a little altar call and said all the ministers come up and it wasn't it was just kind of standing in the room only and the ministers were stepping up people and I didn't go I guess I was the only Minister there didn't go and you know sometimes preachers get the wowy Woos too and so on the way back to the to the room after that night I told Jo I said you know I don't know if my ministry will ever go anywhere I don't know if it'll ever do anything I don't know if it ever helps anybody maybe people just tolerate me wowy wowy woo I said nobody even knows who I am they don't know my name they don't know where I go they don't know a thing about me just here comes this ball guy wearing a suit who does he think he is and she said well you know you probably bring a little bit on yourself why didn't you go up there tonight I don't know so we we go to I get up the next morning and guess who's preaching Andrew Glover and let me tell you about Andrew Glover I'm going to share this with him I told him I had a story to share with him it's funny how God has a sense of humor in things because Andrew Glover I I didn't like him for a while cuz I thought who is this 19y old boy think he is are any of you human yeah amen praise the Lord who does he think he is going to try to come preach the way he preaches who does he think he is so he's preaching on Saturday morning and we're sitting there and he's talking and he's just preaching and just out of the way and I remember the night before I had the wowy wounds and I was like nobody knows me nobody cares and he says that man sat right back there brother Brad pal he said his wife come up to pray for him I gave her a handkerchief two years later he brought me back that handkerchief he's back in the pull pit he knows who he is it gets better I thought well they probably maybe maybe somebody caught that Saturday night Ron Spencer's preaching my buddy and I I I'm listening to brother Ron preaching he's preaching on the prodal man he's wearing that prodal out let me back up we go to the ministers meeting before we knew we was going to have a prayer line and and brother te I want to get everybody all the ministers together and talk about how this was going to operate and and what we you know the spirits we' be facing and and so forth and how to conduct and so forth and when I walked into the room there come brother Ron in the door he come over there with them arms he said you know when you called me that day he said I was standing under a power line and he said when I hung up the phone I fell to my knees and I prayed for you like never before and I was wondering why don't he give me any advice why don't he share any wisdom why don't he tell me what to do why don't he call me why don't he see how I'm doing you know sometimes we have to walk through Dry places we had prayer and the service is going and and he's preaching he's he's laying all this stuff out on the prodal and he's standing I'm sitting about where Adriana is I guess you'd say compared to the pull pit and he's walking over way and then those eyes they fixed on me I thought oh Lord what's he going to do and if you've ever been under SE brother Ron under the anointing his eyes have a different kind of fire about them and I knew as soon as he laid those eyes on me something was different I seen it him in one other time and that was when Adriana come up for prayer once and brother Ron and I prayed for you I don't know where we were at or what we was doing but those eyes were like a glow of fire and he fixed Those Eyes Upon me and he said you were used this morning wasn't you yep I'm going to use you tonight and he said don't you get mad if you get mad I'm going to get you he said that's Brad he said that's Brother Brad he said I've been in his home I've been in his house I've been around his family I know him they're my he's my friend he's my buddy and he said he called me one day he said and I could pick up such a negative attitude of hatred and anger and he said I hung up the phone and he said you know a lot of people would say well he is going to get what he's got coming he said but I didn't do that he said I was standing under a power line and I fell down to my knees and he said I began to pray for him and I thought that was the end of the story and I thought well people are kind of starting to know who I am and he looks he said and he's a preacher and he said you mean preachers can have those things happen to them he said well sure they can he said but I'll tell you this he can preach Grace and he can preach love like nobody can ever preach it that's how God brings things around to Circle you say well somebody told him nobody told him you say You must have talked to Andrew I didn't see Andrew before the service who was it it was the Holy Ghost and so before all of this happened I had been praying before s Saturday morning I looked out across the crowd before Andrew started preaching I looked out across the crowd and I said Lord there was multitudes that just thronged you and they had to touch you they had to be by you and you knew exactly it was it touched you and anybody that called upon you in that multitude they got what they had need of Lord I need to hear from you today in the multitude of 600 people God speak to me not once but twice was I called out among 600 people and you're going to tell me God's not mindful of who we are list our feet you love the Lord tonight amen you know the Bible says in Roman 8 if you live by the after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live the spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God how many tonight can say Lord I'm a Child of God now with Honest Hearts how many can say I'm I'm I'm Laing a little bit in some of these some of these fruits

Brotherly Love whatever it is we they know in their own heart as well as you know father so Lord we ask tonight that you would come down and and you would begin to to woo us with your presence light
