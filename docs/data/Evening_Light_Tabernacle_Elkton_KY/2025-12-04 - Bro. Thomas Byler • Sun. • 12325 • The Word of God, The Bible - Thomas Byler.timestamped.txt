[27:14] [music and singing] place.
[27:16] Hallelujah. Good to be in the house of
[27:18] the Lord tonight.
[27:20] I said, 'It's good to be in the house of
[27:21] the Lord tonight.
[27:23] You look around, you think, well,
[27:25] there's not. It's not a full house. He
[27:27] didn't say it had to be a full house. He
[27:29] said where two [music] or three are
[27:30] gathered. So, how many believers do we
[27:32] have here tonight? How many come? Amen.
[27:34] How many come to pull on the gift of the
[27:36] Lord tonight?
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We do have a lot of needs before
[27:40] us tonight. So, we want to bring those
[27:42] needs before the church. And if we
[27:44] could, Brother Caleb and maybe Brother
[27:46] Tommy, y'all just make your way up.
[27:48] Brother Steve, if you'll come up too and
[27:50] brother Steve is going to lead us in
[27:51] prayer and we'll just take the knees
[27:53] before the Lord and and take up the
[27:55] offering at the same time [music]
[27:56] tonight. And
[27:58] [clears throat]
[28:00] uh brother brother David, sister Janet,
[28:02] [music] they're they're sick and not
[28:04] feeling well and uh they're on the mend
[28:07] I think but [music] uh it became kind of
[28:09] a sticky situation I think for Sister
[28:12] Janet. And so just remember them in
[28:13] prayer. Brother Shawn, he couldn't be
[28:15] with us. They couldn't be with us
[28:17] tonight. his his back is giving him
[28:19] trouble tonight. And Sister Sherry's not
[28:22] feeling well tonight. I think uh little
[28:24] Hie is is uh still not 100%. So remember
[28:28] her in prayer. Uh and also remember
[28:31] Lacy. She's sick tonight. [music] So a
[28:33] lot going around and but we know God's a
[28:36] healer. God's a provider. Whatever we
[28:39] have need of, he's more than able. Also,
[28:40] we want to remember Brother Troy, Sister
[28:42] Robin. They're traveling and on their
[28:45] way out to Arizona. So just ask that the
[28:47] the Lord would be with them. And Brother
[28:49] Devon, Sister Jana, I think are
[28:50] traveling tonight as [music] well. So
[28:52] remember them in prayer that the Lord
[28:54] would just have his guardian angels
[28:57] about them and [music] and uh watch over
[28:59] them and protect them. So, Brother
[29:01] Steve, if
[29:04] [music]
[29:04] &gt;&gt; dear most gracious heavenly father,
[29:06] you've heard all of these requests,
[29:08] Lord. And Lord, I'm sure there's others,
[29:11] Lord, that didn't get mentioned that
[29:13] maybe we overlooked or we didn't know
[29:15] about, but the thing about it is, Lord,
[29:18] we know that [music] you know each one.
[29:20] And Father, we just believe, Lord, we
[29:23] come tonight believing. And we've seen
[29:25] your powerful hand, Lord, move amongst
[29:28] us. And Lord,
[29:31] it's not a certain day or a certain time
[29:34] that something's got to happen,
[29:37] but through you and through your power,
[29:41] Lord, all things can happen at your time
[29:43] and at your place. And Lord, we just
[29:46] pray that you be with these, Lord,
[29:48] traveling, these that are sick.
[29:51] Lord, just be with each one, Father. And
[29:53] we just want to thank you for the
[29:55] multitude of healings [music] that has
[29:57] been brought Lord to our
[30:01] remembrance and different times in life.
[30:04] Lord, we've seen your hand, Lord. And
[30:06] you're the same God today, yesterday,
[30:08] and forever. [music] And we just thank
[30:10] you for that in your name. Amen.
[30:22] While they're getting their song ready,
[30:23] I do just want to make a quick
[30:24] announcement. Brother Keith Reed did
[30:26] want to just send greetings and thanks
[30:28] and uh for the offering that we were
[30:30] we're sending over and it's in transit
[30:32] right now and and uh he said it was just
[30:35] a just a just a terrible situation as
[30:37] they still begin to look at it and but
[30:39] they're so grateful so grateful for for
[30:42] the offering that we sent and um I don't
[30:44] think it's been announced how much we
[30:46] was able to take up but I I will
[30:48] announce it uh now it hasn't been
[30:50] announced yet has it? I think we we were
[30:52] able to send $6,500 to Jamaica. So, very
[30:55] good offering. They're very grateful and
[30:57] thankful and just continue to remember
[30:59] them in prayer. They're being overrun
[31:01] with uh with rats and roaches. Uh the
[31:04] water table pushed all the varmints out
[31:06] of the ground and they're out of rat
[31:07] poison and so they're they're fighting
[31:09] rats and and roaches. So, uh that I
[31:13] don't think that's too much information,
[31:14] but it's a need. They have a need. They
[31:16] they need us to pray that that things
[31:18] would get back to a normal state for
[31:20] them that they could have church. So,
[31:22] you can be seated tonight and won't keep
[31:24] you standing. Brother Steve, Sister
[31:25] Becky has a special for us tonight.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; We uh sing this song tonight. We visited
[31:34] with her a little bit this afternoon and
[31:36] um
[31:39] she's doing really well. Uh just
[31:41] remember her her hands and her feet
[31:44] still giving her some trouble but uh she
[31:47] looks really really good. Uh and we just
[31:51] thank the Lord for what he's done in her
[31:53] life. I mean it's just a miracle. Uh
[31:57] some of y'all might not have seen her
[31:58] when she was at her lowest but she is a
[32:02] total totally different person today. So
[32:05] just thank the Lord for that.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[32:20] &gt;&gt; All alone and [singing and music]
[32:22] brokenhearted
[32:24] trying to calm the raging battle in my
[32:27] mind. [singing]
[32:33] I searched for many answers, but my
[32:37] troubled [music] soul just couldn't seem
[32:40] to find. [singing]
[32:46] &gt;&gt; I saw a flower [singing] blooming where
[32:50] there was no rain or sunshine.
[32:59] And I knew [singing and music] not that
[33:01] this flower would change the rest of my
[33:07] life. [singing]
[33:10] &gt;&gt; I found a lily in my valley.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; I found strength when I was warm.
[33:22] [music]
[33:23] &gt;&gt; I found a place to leave my burdens.
[33:29] I found [singing] a refuge from [music]
[33:31] the storm,
[33:36] &gt;&gt; a place to train my dark
[33:42] to [singing] beaming rays of sunshine.
[33:48] I found [singing] a lily [music] in my
[33:51] valley
[33:55] and [singing] he blooms all the time.
[34:03] So if [singing] you're down and
[34:05] brokenarted
[34:06] and you just can't seem
[34:08] [singing and music] to find peace of
[34:10] mind,
[34:13] [music]
[34:16] &gt;&gt; you're searching for your answers, but
[34:19] your problems are [singing] getting
[34:21] worse all the time.
[34:25] [music]
[34:28] Just reach your hands to Jesus.
[34:31] [singing]
[34:31] He'll take you and break the ties at
[34:35] mine. [singing]
[34:40] &gt;&gt; He'll be your lily in your [singing]
[34:43] valley. [music] You can watch him bloom
[34:47] all the time.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; He'll be [singing] your li and your
[34:54] valley.
[34:58] He'll be strength when you're warm.
[35:01] [singing]
[35:03] [music]
[35:04] &gt;&gt; He'll be the place to leave your
[35:06] [singing] burden.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; He'll give you refuge from the [singing]
[35:13] storm.
[35:15] [music]
[35:17] A place to trade your dark skies
[35:20] [singing]
[35:23] to beaming [music]
[35:24] rays of sunshine.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; He'll [music] be your lily in [singing]
[35:31] your valley
[35:35] and he'll bloom all [music] the time.
[35:42] I found a lady in my valley. [singing]
[35:48] &gt;&gt; I found strength when I was warm.
[35:52] [singing]
[35:54] &gt;&gt; I found a place to leave my burdens.
[35:59] [music]
[36:01] &gt;&gt; I found a refuge from the storm.
[36:06] [music]
[36:08] A place to train your dark skies
[36:13] [music] to beaming rays of sunshine.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; I found a lily in my valley [music]
[36:27] &gt;&gt; and he [singing] blooms
[36:30] all the time.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[36:42] &gt;&gt; It's good to know that no matter what
[36:44] you're going through, you have a a lily
[36:46] in your valley.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand if we could. And I
[36:50] just don't think we can sing this song
[36:52] sitting down. And you need a lot of air
[36:54] to sing this song. So, it's been been
[36:57] preached about a lot here lately. And
[36:59] and Sister [music] Becky is going to
[37:01] help me some with this. And I know
[37:02] there's about four or five of you in
[37:05] here that has sung this as [music] a
[37:06] special. So, let's just let the glory
[37:09] roll when the roll is called in glory.
[37:12] [music] Let's try to give that a song, a
[37:15] chance if we could. I'm going to let the
[37:17] glory roll when the roll is called
[37:20] [music] in glory. [singing]
[37:23] I'm going to get beside myself. When I
[37:26] get beside [music] the key, [singing]
[37:28] that day I'm going to have the time of
[37:31] my life. When the time of [music] my
[37:33] life is over,
[37:36] I'm going to get [singing] carried away.
[37:39] When I get carried away,
[37:44] well, I don't know why I become a little
[37:46] shy when I get around a whole [singing]
[37:49] lot of people. And I can't figure out
[37:52] why I never shout about the love that
[37:55] floods my soul. [singing]
[37:57] I must confess. [music] I can't express
[38:01] the feeling [singing] deep inside me.
[38:04] The things I know and cannot [music]
[38:06] show. One day [singing] will overflow.
[38:11] I'm going to let the glory roll. When
[38:14] the roll is called in glory,
[38:16] [singing and music]
[38:18] I'm going to get beside myself. When I
[38:21] get beside the king, that day I'm going
[38:25] to [music] have the time of my life.
[38:27] When the time of my life [singing] is
[38:29] over,
[38:31] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[38:35] get carried away,
[38:38] [singing]
[38:39] well, I'll pass the cloud and I shout so
[38:41] loud it may sound [singing and music]
[38:44] like thunder. My tearful eyes may fill
[38:48] the skies until it looks like rain. When
[38:52] I leave [music and singing] this world
[38:54] and gates of pearl, I stand before my
[38:57] savior. I lift my soul. [singing]
[39:00] Let the glory roll. When the roll, he
[39:03] [music] calls my name.
[39:06] I'm [singing] going to let the glory
[39:08] roll. When the roll is calling glory,
[39:12] [music]
[39:13] I'm going to give a side of myself. When
[39:16] I get beside the king, that day
[39:19] [singing]
[39:20] I'm going to have the time [music] of my
[39:21] life. When the time of my life is over,
[39:26] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[39:30] get carried away,
[39:33] I'm going to let the [singing] glory
[39:35] roll. When the roll is called in glory,
[39:41] [music]
[39:42] when I get beside the king that day, I'm
[39:47] going to have the time [music] of my
[39:48] life. When the time of my life is over,
[39:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get [singing and music]
[39:54] carried away.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; When I get carried away,
[39:59] hallelujah. Give him my hand clap of
[40:01] praise tonight.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good to be. Amen. I
[40:08] appreciate you helping there. We needed
[40:10] the help. So, [music] let's just if we
[40:13] could just change the order of the
[40:14] service. We'll invite Brother Ber to
[40:16] come and and we'll have Amazing Grace.
[40:18] We'll sing that as brother Ber [music]
[40:20] comes. It's amazing
[40:24] [singing]
[40:25] grace
[40:27] how sweet
[40:30] the sound
[40:33] that save
[40:36] a rich
[40:38] like [singing] me.
[40:44] I once
[40:46] was lost, [music and singing]
[40:49] but now
[40:52] I'm found.
[40:55] I was blind,
[40:58] but now
[41:00] I see.
[41:04] [singing and music]
[41:05] It was grace
[41:09] that told [singing]
[41:12] [music]
[41:12] God bless you, brother Brad.
[41:17] And your grace
[41:19] my fears
[41:22] raing. [singing]

[41:31] did [music]
[41:33] that grace

[42:45] for making
[42:47] me whole.
[42:51] Thank
[42:52] you Lord [music] for giving
[42:57] to [singing] me.

[43:18] his grace. Amen. and that he gave to you
[43:21] so rich
[43:23] and so free. Amen. God bless you. Good
[43:26] evening, everybody. [clears throat]
[43:28] &gt;&gt; It's good to be in the house of the Lord
[43:30] &gt;&gt; where it's warm. Amen. Been a little bit
[43:33] nippy the last couple days, but thank
[43:36] you musicians.
[43:38] Thank you for leading songs tonight.
[43:40] Appreciate that. Amen. Thank you all for
[43:43] coming out. Amen.
[43:46] Amen. So, we just see what the Lord will
[43:48] have for us this evening. It's just kind
[43:52] of kind of a different Amen. direction.
[43:55] Amen. I feel like the Lord's taking me
[43:58] tonight. So, we'll just try to follow
[44:00] the leading of the Lord. Is that okay?
[44:03] Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, as we come
[44:06] bow our heads to the dust from where we
[44:08] were made, Lord, and realizing, Father,
[44:11] we are but clay in your hands. And we
[44:12] ask God tonight that you would just use
[44:15] us for your honor for your glory. Be
[44:16] with the speaker, ears of the hearer,
[44:19] those streaming, we pray God that you'll
[44:21] give them all a special blessing, Lord,
[44:23] as we open your word and talk about your
[44:25] word tonight in Jesus name. Amen and
[44:28] amen. Amen. Have we got a title up there
[44:30] yet? Go ahead and throw that up there if
[44:32] you haven't. Amen. The word of God,
[44:36] the Bible. Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. you know, it's
[44:42] just gonna
[44:45] Amen.
[44:47] Um,
[44:48] we know that the Bible is the word of
[44:51] God. Amen. So, Amen. Let's turn, if you
[44:56] will, to the book of Revelations. We'll
[44:58] read a scripture there
[45:00] all the way back in the book of
[45:01] Revelations. We'll just do a little
[45:03] teaching tonight. Amen.
[45:07] And uh give you a little drama. Amen. At
[45:11] the beginning here, but in Revelations
[45:14] 19,
[45:19] um, let me just stop there and
[45:23] make a little correction. Amen. That is
[45:27] long overdue. Amen. Brother Chris Kathy,
[45:31] last time that he was here, and we're
[45:33] fixing to have him here Sunday again. By
[45:35] God's grace, he's going to minister for
[45:37] us Sunday morning and Sunday evening.
[45:39] Amen. So Chris Kathy will be with us.
[45:42] But last time he had made some a
[45:44] statement in his preaching that he
[45:46] wanted me to correct and I haven't done
[45:48] it. Amen. And it just slipped my mind.
[45:50] Amen. And so did I. I thought about it
[45:52] this evening. So I wrote it down. So um
[45:55] I want to do that. Amen. And he was
[45:58] preaching and he said, you know, that
[46:00] about his wife. He was about talking
[46:02] about the Lord and uh giving him a wife.
[46:04] Y'all might remember it, probably won't,
[46:06] but anyway, he was telling the Lord if
[46:09] God would give him uh, you know, a wife,
[46:12] you know, a godly wife and all that, he
[46:14] would serve him, you know, and that is
[46:17] not what he had intended to say. Amen.
[46:20] Because he doesn't serve him just
[46:22] because he give him a wife. He serves
[46:24] him for another purpose. You understand
[46:25] that? But he meant to say that he would
[46:28] protect her. Amen. He would protect her.
[46:30] So he wanted me to relay that, you know,
[46:32] but like I said, that was about a month
[46:34] ago, so you all forgive me. Amen. But
[46:38] anyway, we do that sometimes. Ain't that
[46:40] right? Later on, we'll think about
[46:41] something. And especially, it's easy for
[46:43] me to make a corre correction the next,
[46:46] you know, service or all. But if
[46:48] somebody don't come back for a while, I
[46:49] mean, I can see why they would want to
[46:51] correct something like that. And he's
[46:52] very sensitive and we appreciate him.
[46:55] Look forward to hearing him again this
[46:57] weekend. Amen.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, Revelations 19 now
[47:00] and we'll begin with verse 11. And I saw
[47:03] heaven opened, and behold, a white
[47:04] horse, and he that sat upon him was
[47:06] called faithful and true, and in
[47:09] righteousness does he judge and make
[47:11] war. His eyes were as a flame of fire,
[47:14] and on his head were many crowns. And he
[47:17] had a name written that no man knew but
[47:19] he himself. He was clothed with a
[47:21] vesture dipped in blood, and his name is
[47:25] called the Word of God. And the armies
[47:27] which were in heaven followed him upon
[47:29] white horses, clothed in fine linen,
[47:32] clean and white. And out of his mouth
[47:34] goeth a sharp sword, that with it he
[47:36] should sm the n smite the nations, and
[47:39] he shall rule them with a rod of iron.
[47:42] And he treadth the wine press of the
[47:44] fierceness of the wrath of almighty God.
[47:46] Amen. May God added his blessing to the
[47:49] reading of the words. You can be seated.
[47:52] Now, basically, we're basically I mean,
[47:55] this is going to be a little bit what
[47:57] you might think just really really down
[47:59] to the to the basics. Really back to the
[48:02] basics. And just talking about this
[48:05] book, this book right here.
[48:09] And
[48:12] the Bible,
[48:15] how many knows that in a lot of it's
[48:17] outlawed? You can't have it. You can't
[48:20] have this. They don't want you to have
[48:22] this.
[48:24] Why? Because it does something to
[48:27] somebody. It it does something when you
[48:30] open it and when you read it,
[48:34] &gt;&gt; it does it has such profound effects
[48:37] upon people until they would rather have
[48:40] you chop their head off than to take
[48:42] this from them.
[48:44] Is that right? Many times dictators like
[48:48] Russia, Stalin, different ones, China,
[48:50] any dictator, they don't want you to
[48:52] read this because they want you to
[48:54] worship him. I've heard some uh uh uh of
[48:58] North Korea's dictator and how that he
[49:01] would allow certain people come and have
[49:03] the cataracts taken out of their eyes.
[49:05] And I was reading how he, you know, lets
[49:08] different ones to be doctorred on and
[49:10] they worship him and they absolutely
[49:12] worship him and thank him and make him
[49:14] God. He's he's God to them.
[49:18] But you know when they when you open
[49:19] this when when when this book right
[49:21] here.
[49:23] Amen.
[49:24] That's what I want to talk about. With
[49:26] the help of the Lord, we know that it is
[49:28] God's word.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's the most precious word
[49:33] book that there is. Is
[49:36] &gt;&gt; that right? There's nothing like it.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Nothing like in all the world. No other
[49:40] book like it. Amen. and King James
[49:44] version of this Bible, this Bible the
[49:45] way that it is. Amen. I certainly take
[49:50] King James version of it. Amen.
[49:53] We know because there's many different
[49:55] versions. There's uh additions and
[49:57] everything else and you know uh and they
[50:00] change a lot of things. But you know,
[50:02] the prophet of God used this and one
[50:04] reason I like it so much is because the
[50:06] prophet of God used it. He believed this
[50:08] was the right correct book that it was
[50:10] right. It was it was correct. Amen. And
[50:14] God would of course vindicate it and
[50:15] prove it. So that makes a big
[50:17] difference. Amen. But my thought I want
[50:20] to just share with my thought. Amen.
[50:23] Beginning with uh I I was beginning to
[50:26] you know just to think about the word of
[50:27] God and before it was even before there
[50:30] was even the word even before the word.
[50:34] Amen.
[50:36] Back when way back when God wasn't even
[50:39] God. He was by himself and he was there
[50:41] alone with his thoughts. And I got to
[50:44] thinking of how that when you think
[50:46] about in tonight's service, I want to
[50:49] with the help of the Lord a little bit
[50:50] realizing that this is a service where
[50:53] uh and I uh I like that song. My faith
[50:57] looks up to the thy lamb of Calvary.
[51:00] Amen.
[51:02] My faith looks up to thee. So, I've been
[51:04] humming that song all all day almost cuz
[51:07] that's what we do tonight is we want to
[51:10] we I love to look at him. Don't you
[51:11] don't you like to look at Christ?
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Cuz having your eyes down on the world
[51:15] and the things of the world or down
[51:17] here, you know, it doesn't do much for
[51:18] you. It doesn't look you don't you don't
[51:21] get very far by looking at yourself or
[51:23] looking at your sickness or whatever it
[51:25] is. That don't do much for you. But look
[51:28] up. Amen. How many believes this causes
[51:30] us to look up?
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:33] And brother Benham and I'm going to read
[51:35] you a little story here and this will be
[51:36] the drama part. Amen. Brother Benham and
[51:40] taking us way back. Amen. He says, "Now,
[51:43] would you like to hear what I think
[51:45] about God become? Would you like to take
[51:49] a little trip with me for a few minutes?
[51:51] Have I got time now? Be reverent just a
[51:54] minute now and let me get this
[51:55] straightened out for you. Let's take a
[51:58] little trip in a little space now in a
[52:01] mental vision and go back a 100red
[52:03] million years before there was even a
[52:05] star in the sky by your mind. It was
[52:09] God. He always has been God. Amen. And
[52:13] then standing here watching creation
[52:16] come into existence.
[52:18] There's not a star. There's not nothing.
[52:22] And then let's notice out yonder. I see
[52:25] now all that space,
[52:29] all that is God.
[52:32] How many knows that he's omnipresent? He
[52:35] fills all time and all space.
[52:40] Amen. Omnipresent. He's omnisient,
[52:43] which is all knowing. Is that right? He
[52:47] knows
[52:49] uh how much tally a knat would make. I
[52:52] have no idea what tally is out of a
[52:54] knat. Do you?
[52:57] Nats make tally. All right. Well,
[52:59] anyway, apparently they do. Bible the
[53:01] Bible says tells us, did he? God knew
[53:04] just each gnat, every little bug, but
[53:07] every
[53:08] much how many times it would bat its
[53:10] eye. Isn't that right?
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Wow. How many believe? Now we're looking
[53:16] in the right direction.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at how great God is. Now, we
[53:22] realize that even Brother Bam said later
[53:24] in his ministry, he says, "Don't try to
[53:25] figure God out. You'll never figure God
[53:28] out."
[53:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; He says, you know, he didn't make us to
[53:32] be able to figure him out. How can he
[53:33] know all this? How can be all powerful?
[53:36] And how can he be ever present? How can
[53:38] he do what he does? I have no idea.
[53:41] There's a lot we don't know.
[53:44] And uh so but it's the but the thing of
[53:47] it is is for us to believe him. That's
[53:50] what he does.
[53:52] Amen. Especially after proving himself.
[53:55] Aren't you glad that he come and prove
[53:56] himself? I'm here to tell you right now,
[53:58] if we wouldn't had Malachi 4, we'd be in
[54:01] bad shape. Amen.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; All the psychology, all the different
[54:06] religions and all of this and wondering,
[54:08] you know, and and and they don't, you
[54:10] know, they don't have the kind of signs
[54:11] and wonders that what the prophet of God
[54:13] God did through brother Bam.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Is that right? But he come down and he
[54:18] showed himself real alive. So, so plain
[54:21] and so simple with the simplest I love
[54:25] him songs, only believe songs.
[54:29] So simple but yet come and showed
[54:31] himself alive and real. So I'm thankful
[54:36] for what God did. So he says here now
[54:39] notice you're standing there and this
[54:41] was in pillar of fire Joeboro 53
[54:46] out yonder. I see all that space that
[54:49] all is God without form forever for
[54:52] eternities.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[54:56] &gt;&gt; eternities.
[54:59] How far back?
[55:01] &gt;&gt; How far back? We in our mind, if you
[55:04] want to blow your mind, don't think this
[55:07] thought. You can't think the thought,
[55:08] how did God start or where did he start?
[55:12] How can there be a being that never
[55:14] started?
[55:15] Because we are we are so uh birthday, uh
[55:18] death day, uh all the dates and
[55:21] everything is about time and beginnings
[55:23] and endings for us. But he never was
[55:26] never had a beginning that's
[55:27] unfathomable almost unfathomable.
[55:31] He never did begin.
[55:35] We want to say how many trillion years
[55:37] before he ever begin to think about what
[55:38] he wants to do.
[55:42] How long was it?
[55:45] Well, that's where we really don't
[55:48] really understand eternity yet, don't
[55:50] we? I think brother Brandham explained
[55:53] it to us a little bit. He tried to get
[55:55] us to fathom a little bit of what
[55:57] eternity is when he went beyond the
[55:59] curtain of time. When he went up there
[56:00] for 20 for about 20 feet up there and
[56:03] what did he say? He said there's no
[56:06] yesterday there and there's no tomorrow.
[56:12] You're just there. You've just arrived.
[56:17] And I don't know about you, but I long
[56:19] for that time. Haven't you ever had a
[56:22] really great time, a really good moment,
[56:24] and wish you could just lock that in for
[56:26] a while, but it ain't no time it passes.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; It's gone.
[56:32] Amen. For us that are 60 and above, we
[56:36] think about our youth.
[56:38] Oh my. And I was telling the boys the
[56:40] other day, I says, "Boy, if you're in
[56:42] your 30s, that's still prime time. 30s,
[56:44] you know,
[56:47] &gt;&gt; or 40s ain't bad.
[56:50] And I'm here to tell you, it's a
[56:52] nightmare when I think, Brother Brian,
[56:53] of Well, 50s wouldn't even be all that
[56:56] bad.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. They're gone. They're long
[57:00] gone. I'm turning I'm next month I'll be
[57:03] 64 years old.
[57:06] 64.
[57:08] Hello.
[57:09] But there there's no yesterday, there's
[57:13] no tomorrow. It's just eternity.
[57:17] Can't fathom. But that's God.
[57:20] Amen. There is no when did he start? He
[57:23] always was
[57:25] filled all time, filled all space.
[57:28] Noted everything.
[57:30] Amen.
[57:33] Forever for eternities. No beginning, no
[57:36] ending. It's all God. Before there was
[57:39] even error, there was God. The very
[57:42] beginning of the nature of the creation
[57:45] was God. Now the Bible teaches that the
[57:48] logos went out of God or I might say
[57:51] that God becoming his first body
[57:58] in the form when he was the logos that
[58:01] went out of God. Now another place he
[58:03] calls that logos a fire or pillar of
[58:06] fire. He also calls that logos Jesus.
[58:11] Is that right? the logos, the pillar of
[58:14] fire
[58:16] that went out of God. So where's God? We
[58:21] come out of God. Here it is. The pillar
[58:23] of fire. Now he's more invisible
[58:24] perhaps. And we know that Jesus, what
[58:27] did Paul see when he or he whenever the
[58:30] pillar of fire struck him down the
[58:32] light, he saw a light, he went back. I
[58:33] come from God, Jesus said, and I go back
[58:36] to God. In other words, I come from that
[58:38] logos or the pillar of fire and I go
[58:40] back to the pillar of fire.
[58:43] What do you think it was when he
[58:45] separated himself in the uh cloven
[58:47] tongues of fire? Ain't that right, upon
[58:49] each believer?
[58:53] So, where's God tonight? Well, we do
[58:55] want to go down that little alley, but
[58:57] we realize that God, I'm looking at God
[59:00] or at the temple that God is in. Isn't
[59:02] that right?
[59:03] &gt;&gt; He's in each and every one of our
[59:05] hearts.
[59:06] Praise the Lord. I will not leave you
[59:08] comfortless. I will be with you even in
[59:11] you to the end of the world. So here the
[59:14] logos went out of God. Let's look what
[59:17] that looked like. No one has seen the
[59:19] father at any time nowhere. Never did
[59:21] and never will.
[59:24] But when the logos went out of him, he
[59:27] became like a little halo of light.
[59:30] And then he says, "Let's see him playing
[59:31] yonder like a child before the doorstep
[59:33] of the father." And now I see him. He
[59:36] moves over here and he draws his uh or
[59:40] in his mind a picture of what the world
[59:42] should be.
[59:45] Amen. No. So one of the things that
[59:48] brought me to this thought was first of
[59:49] all realize that when God he he has he's
[59:52] a fountain of all knowledge.
[59:55] And when God thinks
[59:57] he ain't like a bunch of businessmen,
[1:00:00] executives
[1:00:02] are having a bunch of executives get
[1:00:04] together and they mill around for an
[1:00:06] hour or two to try to figure out the
[1:00:09] best way to do something. Ain't that
[1:00:10] right?
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; You got to get the best heads and and do
[1:00:15] the very best that you can to try to
[1:00:16] figure something out. No, this won't
[1:00:18] work. I know that won't work. No, God
[1:00:20] don't have to do all that. His first
[1:00:23] thought is exactly perfect.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know if I'll get to say
[1:00:33] this, but I want to say this that
[1:00:35] tonight, if you don't get nothing else
[1:00:37] out of the service, be thankful that you
[1:00:39] are part of the program and the plan of
[1:00:42] God.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's many things that God tells
[1:00:47] you well by how did Paul say um
[1:00:56] we know we are they are they that are
[1:00:58] the sons of God are led by the spirit of
[1:01:00] God. Now he that hath not the spirit of
[1:01:02] God is none of his. Amen. So we know
[1:01:05] that we're his because of his spirit
[1:01:07] that's on the inside of us. So that's
[1:01:09] one way that you can know that you're
[1:01:12] part of God. Amen. All right. So maybe
[1:01:16] get into a little more of that later.
[1:01:18] But so he says, "Look now notice."
[1:01:22] All right.
[1:01:24] In his mind, a picture of what the world
[1:01:26] should be. Now there's not a star nor
[1:01:29] nothing. I hear him say, "Let there be."
[1:01:34] Amen. Let there be.
[1:01:38] See folks,
[1:01:40] do you realize how powerful Genesis 1
[1:01:43] and1 is? In the beginning, God created
[1:01:47] the heavens and the earth.
[1:01:51] I was going to talk to you about the
[1:01:52] power,
[1:01:55] how powerful faith in this word of God
[1:01:57] really is. Ain't that right? The power
[1:02:00] of faith in this word.
[1:02:04] dictators, different ones might say they
[1:02:06] might teach evolution, Darvin theory, or
[1:02:08] whatever. But if you open this Bible and
[1:02:10] you believe it's God's word and you read
[1:02:12] just that, it'll tell you where you come
[1:02:15] from.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that? It tells
[1:02:20] us where we come from,
[1:02:25] where we what we're here for, and where
[1:02:27] we're going. The only book that does
[1:02:29] that, ain't that right?
[1:02:32] See, in the beginning, 1 John 1 and1
[1:02:35] says, "In the beginning was the word.
[1:02:37] The word was with God, and the word was
[1:02:40] God." Amen. All things were made by him.
[1:02:44] Without anything without him was not
[1:02:46] anything made that was made, things
[1:02:50] present, no matter what it is, there was
[1:02:52] nothing made that was made. How many
[1:02:56] knows that this here tells where
[1:02:59] everything comes from?
[1:03:02] Everything that ever come from anywhere
[1:03:04] tells you where it come from and who
[1:03:07] done it.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:14] My when I when I think about this, no
[1:03:17] wonder brother Brandham carried it right
[1:03:19] where? Right here. He carried it right
[1:03:22] here.
[1:03:23] Why? Because this this book is precious.
[1:03:28] This is the best thing that you have.
[1:03:30] This is the greatest thing you own.
[1:03:32] I'm reading uh a few few things that
[1:03:35] come up uh and and I'll probably read
[1:03:38] the quote yet, but in Christ the mystery
[1:03:39] of God revealed 1965, brother Brandham
[1:03:43] uh he said that this book right here is
[1:03:45] the complete revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:49] The complete revelation of God of Jesus
[1:03:52] Christ. And in there he says this is God
[1:03:58] in leather form.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; It's God in leather form.
[1:04:04] The words in here
[1:04:08] the Jesus said the words that I speak to
[1:04:10] you they are spirit and they are life.
[1:04:16] Most powerful words in the universe. Can
[1:04:20] we say that the most powerful words are
[1:04:23] right here in the whole universe?
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; I I I'm just I'm just going to go ahead
[1:04:30] and keep going a little bit. That all
[1:04:32] right. You can open this Bible and you
[1:04:35] can read the words in here and actually
[1:04:40] have endless life. I say eternal life,
[1:04:43] but eternal life. We hear it so much to
[1:04:45] callous. Endless life, brother John, by
[1:04:49] simply opening this book and reading it
[1:04:52] and believing it.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Endless life lays here.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Everything that you ever have need of
[1:05:03] lays here.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; It's the Bible.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; The B I B L E. Yes, that's the book for
[1:05:12] me. I don't care how simple it sounds.
[1:05:15] It's still the book for me.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's still the greatest
[1:05:21] book
[1:05:22] in the universe.
[1:05:25] You know how many people known down
[1:05:27] through the dark ages and that have
[1:05:29] actually given their lives because they
[1:05:32] had perhaps been found with the Bible
[1:05:34] and wouldn't renounce it, wouldn't bow
[1:05:36] down from to the to the dictators and
[1:05:38] they would actually die gladly because
[1:05:40] they knew that the one that wrote this
[1:05:44] would take care of them.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:49] All right.
[1:05:54] He said, "Let there be."
[1:05:56] And an atom broke out yonder.
[1:06:00] Amen. An atom broke out yonder because
[1:06:03] how many knows were put together with
[1:06:04] molecules, atoms, and so forth.
[1:06:08] And when it did, the some sun come into
[1:06:10] existence and began to whirl. And she
[1:06:14] burned for millions and millions of
[1:06:16] years.
[1:06:19] And after a while, I see a flicker
[1:06:21] clicker fly off of it.
[1:06:25] Brother Bam makes a noise. What was it?
[1:06:27] It was the first star that flew from the
[1:06:31] sun.
[1:06:33] He watches it fall for a few million
[1:06:36] years and he stops it.
[1:06:41] Amen.
[1:06:42] Now, we're going to have a long service
[1:06:44] tonight if I go to talking about all
[1:06:46] these stars because there's millions of
[1:06:48] them.
[1:06:50] Ain't that right? That's right. Went so
[1:06:52] far he knew where this side was supposed
[1:06:54] to be.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Where that is supposed to be.
[1:07:02] Brother Glenn's nephew has that I forget
[1:07:05] that thing down in Dixon that we went to
[1:07:07] and they say that there's more stars
[1:07:10] there in than there is sand upon the
[1:07:14] earth.
[1:07:17] Can you imagine?
[1:07:19] Well, I'll just be honest with you.
[1:07:21] That's hard to believe
[1:07:26] cuz you know how many deserts there is
[1:07:28] and you know how thick that sand is?
[1:07:30] That's a lot of sin.
[1:07:35] Not just one country, but many different
[1:07:37] countries.
[1:07:41] Amen. Stretching my faith a little bit.
[1:07:44] Go look up there one time.
[1:07:48] It's absolute phenomena.
[1:07:51] Absolutely amazing. Even David talked
[1:07:54] about the creation. If you look at it,
[1:07:56] how it'll stand make you stand in awe. I
[1:08:00] stand I stand in awe of you. How many
[1:08:04] believe we should be in standing in awe
[1:08:06] of almighty God?
[1:08:08] One star way out there and then another
[1:08:11] and then another and then another and
[1:08:12] then until they were all there created
[1:08:15] the moon, the north star. [screaming]
[1:08:19] Brother Ben says he created and wrote
[1:08:20] his first Bible up there from the virgin
[1:08:23] to Leo to lion to the first and second
[1:08:25] coming of God. Christ wrote the Bible up
[1:08:29] there. Zodiac,
[1:08:32] all of that that's up there. Hung it all
[1:08:35] out there
[1:08:38] and it's still there. How many know
[1:08:41] those things don't shift around
[1:08:42] according to the prophet of God? No. If
[1:08:45] that moon got closer out of its place,
[1:08:47] why the floods had come over and
[1:08:49] everything else, everything it's stays
[1:08:51] in its place.
[1:08:54] Why? Because we look at God, this great
[1:08:57] being called God that is omnipotent, all
[1:09:02] powerful.
[1:09:04] I don't know about you, but it it did
[1:09:05] take a lot of power to keep all of them
[1:09:07] in their place, turning and revolving
[1:09:10] just the way that they're supposed to.
[1:09:18] How many believes that we need to have
[1:09:20] the Lord to help us to increase my
[1:09:22] faith?
[1:09:24] Lord, increase my faith.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Then we wonder sometimes when we pray in
[1:09:33] God, we feel like God don't answer.
[1:09:36] Well, if I wonder if God is really with
[1:09:38] me. Does God still do it? And this,
[1:09:40] that, and the other. Hello. Let me tell
[1:09:42] you something. We serve a God that hung
[1:09:43] the star. They're still out there. He's
[1:09:45] more than able
[1:09:48] to take care of whatever you got coming,
[1:09:51] whatever happens. Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; All right. He flicker it and so forth.
[1:10:04] He watches it fall for a few millions,
[1:10:06] then stops it. Another one flies off and
[1:10:09] he lets it go for a few million years
[1:10:10] and stops it. What's he doing? Writing
[1:10:13] his first Bible, the Zodiac. Amen.
[1:10:17] God has wrote three Bibles. One was in
[1:10:20] the zodiac. One of them was in the
[1:10:21] pyramids and one on paper. Thank you,
[1:10:25] Lord.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's glad for their Bible?
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. We take it for granted. I
[1:10:33] mean, we take it too much for granted.
[1:10:38] And when you read it, you pray and say,
[1:10:40] "God, make this real to me." Amen.
[1:10:50] That's right. And then he goes talk
[1:10:51] about end starts with the virgin ends up
[1:10:53] with Leon Lion. But when he writes that,
[1:10:56] he says, "Man is to look up. God is
[1:10:59] above." And then after he gets all of
[1:11:01] the heavenly solar system written out, I
[1:11:04] see him moving over over a little
[1:11:08] clicker was this world. This little
[1:11:10] clicker was the world. And it was
[1:11:12] nothing but a iceberg hanging out. uh
[1:11:16] out of it and he moves over it like
[1:11:18] around the sun and as he begins to
[1:11:21] revolve it around he melts all the water
[1:11:23] off the ice off of it. The iceberg come
[1:11:26] flying through Texas was formed
[1:11:28] Louisiana and down through there where
[1:11:31] it scraped off as chronologicals tell us
[1:11:33] the icebergs went off over into the Gulf
[1:11:37] and so forth. Amen.
[1:11:44] And he begins to say speak how that the
[1:11:47] earth was formed, each country,
[1:11:49] continents and everything else. In
[1:11:51] another message, he talks about how that
[1:11:53] the Holy Spirit begin to brood over the
[1:11:55] earth. Ain't that right.
[1:11:58] Amen. And a little Amen. He said, "Let
[1:12:00] there be." And a little flower came up.
[1:12:03] Let there be. And something else
[1:12:05] happened all the way down to man. And he
[1:12:08] wanted to have man to be in his image
[1:12:10] which was in spirit form. How many know
[1:12:12] the first Adam? Amen. Was created a
[1:12:15] spiritual being.
[1:12:20] Spirit being.
[1:12:24] I've heard old men or older people tell
[1:12:29] me before, you know, the body's getting
[1:12:32] old, but that inward man, he don't get
[1:12:35] old. And I can testify that inside
[1:12:40] Thomas that does that guy don't get old.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; No. Uhhuh. It's not an age thing. It's
[1:12:47] in the spirit realm. It's this. It's the
[1:12:49] house that I'm in.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's what gets old. God created
[1:12:55] man in his own image. And then after
[1:12:58] that, he created him out of the dust of
[1:13:00] the earth to put him into it. Give him
[1:13:03] the five senses. And brother Brandon
[1:13:04] when planning all of this goes all into
[1:13:07] this and he had something in his mind.
[1:13:09] Ain't that right? But I mean know the
[1:13:12] first time first time God begin to open
[1:13:15] his mouth cuz God has a mouth. Brother
[1:13:18] Bam says, "Yeah, he does. He can speak.
[1:13:21] He has a finger. He can write the Ten
[1:13:23] Commandments. He spoke to Moses."
[1:13:26] But one of the first time God be to
[1:13:28] speak, man, I'm here to tell you things
[1:13:31] happened.
[1:13:33] The light shine. The earth was created.
[1:13:35] The sires were created.
[1:13:37] Warmth comes upon the earth. The animal
[1:13:40] kingdom was created. Everything was
[1:13:42] created according to Genesis 1.
[1:13:47] You were created. I was created. But
[1:13:51] says our dust. Amen. And what we come
[1:13:52] from and made out of, we was laying
[1:13:54] there in that dirt. Amen. When before he
[1:13:57] ever even melted the ice, we were here.
[1:14:02] Amen.
[1:14:04] But we think about it. God begin to
[1:14:06] speak. Now to think that there is a
[1:14:09] being that is absolutely perfect in
[1:14:11] knowledge. He is absolutely perfect in
[1:14:13] power. He is all present.
[1:14:17] To think of a great God like that.
[1:14:20] I And this is how I kind of come to my
[1:14:22] message. I thought what if that God if
[1:14:25] that person that being would speak?
[1:14:29] But if he would speak,
[1:14:32] wouldn't you want to know what he said
[1:14:35] and maybe write it down
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; knowing that his knowledge is perfect
[1:14:40] and whatever he said, Amen. is going to
[1:14:43] happen. It's true. It's a absolute. How
[1:14:46] many know we need an absolute in this
[1:14:48] day in our day?
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; We need something that's silent.
[1:14:53] Something that's a rock. And it's not
[1:14:55] Thomas B's words, but it's me repeating
[1:14:58] this right here.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; That's the rock.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; All other ground is sinking sand.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad tonight
[1:15:09] that in a world of confusion,
[1:15:12] there is unconfusion.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; There is clarity.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; God says, "My word will not come back
[1:15:21] void. Heaven and earth will pass away,
[1:15:24] but my word will never pass away.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; How precious. How many thankful to God?
[1:15:33] Amen. That when he speaks something,
[1:15:35] it's forever true. It's eternal.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; It can't be changed.
[1:15:41] All right. Before we get into the main
[1:15:42] part of our service, I want to just read
[1:15:45] you a quote where brother Bam talked
[1:15:47] about uh he was talking about the Bible.
[1:15:49] He says a lot about the Bible in uh
[1:15:51] Amen.
[1:15:53] And
[1:15:55] this one here didn't print it out for
[1:15:57] some reason. 1965
[1:16:00] Christ revealed
[1:16:02] his word. But anyway, listen.
[1:16:06] Well, every denomination is an ultimate
[1:16:08] to believer to their believers. But to
[1:16:10] me and to the ones that I hope that I'm
[1:16:13] leading to Christ by Christ, the Bible
[1:16:17] is our ultimate.
[1:16:19] Amen. How many believe that? It has to
[1:16:23] be the ultimate. Amen. Let every man's
[1:16:25] word uh you know be a lying mind of
[1:16:28] truth. He said Paul said if come anybody
[1:16:30] come and preach anything other than what
[1:16:31] we've said if he's an angel from heaven
[1:16:33] let him be accursed.
[1:16:36] Amen. That's right. So he says that let
[1:16:38] every man's word be a lie of truth. So
[1:16:41] he says and I believe the Bible is God's
[1:16:43] ultimate. No matter what anybody else
[1:16:45] says, it is the ultimate.
[1:16:49] The Bible is not just a book of systems.
[1:16:51] No sir, not just systems, not a code of
[1:16:54] morals, but the Bible is Amen. He says
[1:16:56] it again. Not a book of systems. So many
[1:16:58] systems and so forth. No sir.
[1:17:00] Amen. And it's not all together a book
[1:17:03] of history.
[1:17:05] Amen.
[1:17:07] Isn't it something how you know it's got
[1:17:10] the history. It is. It is a book of
[1:17:12] history. But yet even the record of that
[1:17:16] history is still anointed.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; How many believes it's still anointed?
[1:17:23] All scripture is given by inspiration of
[1:17:26] God. It is profitable for doctrine, for
[1:17:28] reproof, for correction, righteousness.
[1:17:30] Amen. That's right.
[1:17:34] And brother Brandham in his message goes
[1:17:35] into great detail talking about how how
[1:17:38] that
[1:17:39] uh you know it's not like science
[1:17:44] and
[1:17:46] history of science and how they had you
[1:17:48] know that in the time of George
[1:17:51] Washington you know he said that if you
[1:17:53] didn't feel good if you was trying to
[1:17:54] get over something you know I'm not sure
[1:17:56] just what it was anymore but [snorts]
[1:17:58] they'd pull your toenail off and bleed a
[1:18:00] pine of blood. I don't know about you,
[1:18:03] but if I'm not feeling bad, please don't
[1:18:05] pull my toenail off yet on top of it.
[1:18:09] But they do it.
[1:18:11] And then the scientific talking about a
[1:18:13] ball, if he goes over the terrific speed
[1:18:15] of 30 miles an hour, it would go off the
[1:18:16] earth and fall off. He says they don't
[1:18:18] refer back to you to that. But he said
[1:18:21] he goes into detail talking about this
[1:18:23] wrote by 66 different people. I believe
[1:18:25] it was 66 books and so forth. and and
[1:18:30] over a period of thousands of years. And
[1:18:32] he says, there's no contradiction in it
[1:18:34] at all.
[1:18:35] And he says, you know, it's not a book
[1:18:37] of man because man would have never told
[1:18:39] about Abraham and Sarah and and Hagar
[1:18:43] and all these others. He wouldn't have
[1:18:44] said all these bad stuff. They wouldn't
[1:18:46] have wrote about David and all the
[1:18:48] things, the rascal things he did.
[1:18:50] Brother Bam goes into detail or all the
[1:18:52] adultery and everything else that Israel
[1:18:55] caused and did. No, but they wrote what
[1:18:57] they were inspired to write. Right.
[1:19:00] Amen. I believe it was Moses that wrote
[1:19:03] the book of Genesis. Can you imagine
[1:19:04] being under the anointing to just begin
[1:19:06] to write? In the beginning, God created
[1:19:08] the heavens and the earth. Tell the
[1:19:10] whole story. That takes God.
[1:19:13] Amen.
[1:19:15] So he says, "So the Bible is the
[1:19:17] complete revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:19:20] it was wrote by prophets. Hebrews 1:1,
[1:19:22] God in sun dry times and spake to the
[1:19:25] fathers. Amen. in times past by the
[1:19:27] prophets has in these last days spoke to
[1:19:31] us through his son Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:19:36] [clears throat]
[1:19:44] Let me see here.
[1:19:47] No author but God himself could be so
[1:19:50] accurate. Not one word contradicts the
[1:19:53] other one. remember 1600 years apart or
[1:19:56] so. Amen. Was the Bible wrote all the
[1:20:00] way to John on the aisle of Patmas.
[1:20:03] Amen.
[1:20:04] Now he says that's our Bible. Let other
[1:20:07] men's words fail. No man can add to it.
[1:20:10] You don't can't add to the Bible or take
[1:20:12] away from it. This is the complete
[1:20:14] revelation of it all.
[1:20:17] Brother Bam says like the seven seals.
[1:20:20] Someone kept saying to me, he said, "The
[1:20:22] Lord will speak to you, Brother Bannam,
[1:20:24] when those seals are revealed and you
[1:20:26] will tell us how to get closer to God."
[1:20:28] They were trying to say that you're
[1:20:30] going to write more Bible.
[1:20:34] Yeah.
[1:20:36] And how to do? I said, "No, sir. It
[1:20:40] can't be." Because the Bible, the seven
[1:20:42] sees seals on it had the seven mysteries
[1:20:45] hid. It was already wrote, but they
[1:20:48] don't understand what it is. Watch now
[1:20:50] how they plowed along with that being
[1:20:52] even baptized in Jesus' name. See, that
[1:20:55] wasn't is the name of Jesus, the Lord
[1:20:57] Jesus Christ is what it was. All those
[1:20:59] things cuz there's many Jesuses
[1:21:02] and I got several friends here on earth
[1:21:04] named Jesus, minister friends and so
[1:21:06] forth. Amen. But he was trying to say
[1:21:08] that they were trying to say that you're
[1:21:09] going to you're going to tell us
[1:21:10] something, you know, something new or
[1:21:13] different that's going to get closer. He
[1:21:14] said, "No, brother." Mommy knows he
[1:21:16] would know where they're going with it.
[1:21:18] He says, "No, you can't add to it or
[1:21:20] take away because he said this is a
[1:21:22] complete this is complete. If it's not
[1:21:24] the complete body of Christ, then guess
[1:21:26] what? Then you would need to uh finish
[1:21:29] the body or fulfill it.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; But it's complete." How many believes we
[1:21:33] have a complete book?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says, you know, that in the
[1:21:37] last days he came to Jesus.
[1:21:40] Amen.
[1:21:43] Amen. Now let's let's look for look at a
[1:21:46] few scriptures here.
[1:21:49] Amen.
[1:21:50] When when when Jesus Christ spoke,
[1:21:56] well actually let's go to first John
[1:21:58] first. First John it says in the
[1:21:59] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:22:01] with God and the word was God. That's
[1:22:04] why we can say that this is God in
[1:22:08] letter form.
[1:22:12] another place. And and let me say this,
[1:22:15] I believe that this word, every every
[1:22:17] word in here
[1:22:19] is inspired.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; It's got inspiration. It's not a dead
[1:22:25] letter. No. Amen. Remember remember uh
[1:22:29] that I think I don't know if it was
[1:22:31] Billy Graham or one of those, Brother
[1:22:32] Graham didn't mention his name that was
[1:22:34] on a plane talking to a Muhammad and and
[1:22:36] they were talking about he says uh you
[1:22:38] Muhammad makes us happy, too. He gives
[1:22:41] us peace too. He gives us this that or
[1:22:43] the other, you know. And he debated with
[1:22:47] the man and says, you know, but your
[1:22:48] Bible says that the your Bible says that
[1:22:50] the works that I do shall you do also.
[1:22:54] So he he was saying, "So what about
[1:22:56] these works?" He says, "Well, we found
[1:22:58] out the man said to the man, he said, we
[1:23:00] found out that Mark 16 from the certain
[1:23:02] verse on where that was all in there,
[1:23:05] that wasn't inspired."
[1:23:09] That guy looks around. He said,
[1:23:10] "Really?"
[1:23:12] He says, "Well, I want you to know all
[1:23:14] the Quran sp
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; and better said he just changed the
[1:23:20] subject." That man was defeated.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; But he did say he'll meet the he'll meet
[1:23:25] the wrong one day. Amen. He'll have
[1:23:28] somebody that will be able to show it.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And didn't he do it in India? Is
[1:23:34] that right? Invited all of them come on
[1:23:36] and up here. That's what that was. How
[1:23:39] many know that was brother Brandham's
[1:23:40] ministry ministry was many times in his
[1:23:43] services. Now the Bible says St. John
[1:23:45] 14:12 the works that I do shall you do
[1:23:48] also and greater than these shall you do
[1:23:51] because I go to the father.
[1:23:56] Amen.
[1:24:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:02] So these words according to St. John 6
[1:24:06] and verse 63
[1:24:08] he says Jesus makes a statement it is
[1:24:11] the spirit that quickenth the flesh
[1:24:14] profiteth nothing the words that I speak
[1:24:17] to you they are spirit and they are life
[1:24:22] how many glad that every word it's
[1:24:25] spirit and it's life
[1:24:28] do you think that we claim even over in
[1:24:30] the old test Isaiah 53 3-6 Six. He was
[1:24:35] wounded for our transgression, bruised
[1:24:37] for our iniquities. The chastisement of
[1:24:39] our peace was upon him, and by his
[1:24:42] strife we were healed.
[1:24:45] How many believe I like I like the we e.
[1:24:50] Amen. Whether it's e whether were or
[1:24:53] are, it doesn't matter. I'll take either
[1:24:55] one of them. You are healed. You were
[1:24:57] healed.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; When he died on Calvary, you were
[1:25:00] healed.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you'll believe that, guess
[1:25:04] what? Something's going to take place.
[1:25:07] How many believe the word has, the Bible
[1:25:09] says one place, the word is n thee even
[1:25:11] in thy mouth. How many believe you got
[1:25:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that word
[1:25:16] is in you.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; How many believe the logos or the not
[1:25:23] the logos, but the word that God spoke,
[1:25:27] Amen. It has to find a dwelling place.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:34] Listen to this.
[1:25:41] Amen.
[1:25:43] See, one place he says, "Whosoever
[1:25:45] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[1:25:47] die. Believest thou this." Anytime Jesus
[1:25:49] says, "He that believeth on me shall uh
[1:25:51] have eternal life." Now,
[1:25:54] and what is he? He is the word.
[1:25:58] Amen. We We don't have the physical body
[1:26:00] of Jesus Christ. didn't say I believe
[1:26:02] you. No, but he was the word. So if you
[1:26:04] believe this word, you're believing
[1:26:06] Jesus.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; John 3:16.
[1:26:20] John 3:16
[1:26:23] is a promise of God. It's God's word.
[1:26:26] For God so loved the world that he gave
[1:26:28] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:26:31] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:26:34] have everlasting
[1:26:36] life. How many know that is the pardon?
[1:26:40] That's the pardon to the world. Brother
[1:26:42] Bram says all the way from Genesis to
[1:26:44] the Revelation from the first sinner
[1:26:46] whatever. Amen. Eve's beginning all the
[1:26:49] way to the end. It it it covers it all.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's the forgiveness for
[1:26:55] every sinner that's out there.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'll get to it, but
[1:27:02] Jesus says, "I didn't if if man does not
[1:27:04] hear my words," he says, "I judge him
[1:27:06] not." He says, "But the words that I
[1:27:08] speak, they'll judge him at that day."
[1:27:11] So the very words that Jesus said,
[1:27:13] they'll judge him one day. But that that
[1:27:15] wasn't his purpose of coming was to
[1:27:17] judge people. But yet the word will
[1:27:20] judge him. So guess what? Uh, John's
[1:27:22] 3:16. It's going to be presented to
[1:27:25] everybody. Didn't you ever hear it?
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; I mean, glad for that. I'm glad for John
[1:27:30] 3:16 because
[1:27:33] he didn't put my name there. I'm glad he
[1:27:36] didn't put my name there.
[1:27:42] Said if Thomas Ber would believe in him,
[1:27:45] he should not perish but have ever I'm
[1:27:46] glad he didn't put my name there.
[1:27:53] Y'all wondering where I'm going, ain't
[1:27:54] you?
[1:27:56] If you know what brother Brandham
[1:27:57] taught. Brother Brandham said he he
[1:28:00] another man had once said he says I'm
[1:28:02] glad he didn't have that name there
[1:28:04] because there's many Thomas Bers
[1:28:08] might not be me
[1:28:11] but he said whosoever will that's me.
[1:28:14] I'm a who.
[1:28:16] Whoever wants to come let him come. But
[1:28:19] if you have a name there, guess what? It
[1:28:21] may be another one. There's many of
[1:28:23] them. That's what he said. And I thought
[1:28:25] that's right. Whosoever will coverth
[1:28:27] anybody that wants to. [screaming]
[1:28:29] Whosoever will, let him come and drink
[1:28:31] of the water of life freely. It's a
[1:28:33] pardon, right? This is a pardon.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; One of the things that I thought about
[1:28:38] when I was meditating on this, how sweet
[1:28:40] this book is. David said it's sweeter
[1:28:43] than honey in the honeycomb. There's
[1:28:45] honey in the rock. How many believe this
[1:28:47] is the rock? There's honey in the rock,
[1:28:49] my brother. There's honey in the rock
[1:28:51] for you. Amen. This is a good book. Not
[1:28:54] a bad book. It's a good a book of mercy.
[1:28:57] A book of grace.
[1:29:00] Amen.
[1:29:02] A book of forgiveness. A book of
[1:29:04] redemption.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It tells you, Amen, about
[1:29:09] the fall of Adam, the fall of man. But
[1:29:11] praise be to God, it talks about a
[1:29:13] second Adam.
[1:29:16] I'm just glad for the second Adam to
[1:29:17] restore
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; and to give us peace again to give us
[1:29:21] joy.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Why? Because this world, I'll tell you
[1:29:25] right now, you get away from God any
[1:29:27] Amen. And you get away from the Holy
[1:29:29] Spirit and you deal with all the
[1:29:30] oppression and everything that there is
[1:29:32] in the world. It's a terrible world out
[1:29:34] there. I can say like brother Bam says,
[1:29:36] "Man, I don't know what I'd do if it
[1:29:38] wasn't for being a Christian. If it
[1:29:40] wasn't for this book, what will we do?
[1:29:42] [screaming]
[1:29:43] Where will we go?
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God for the word of God. Praise
[1:29:48] God for Amen. Coming down to the mercy
[1:29:50] that he's had.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. The word of God, the
[1:29:57] Bible,
[1:29:58] he said, "These words that I speak to
[1:30:01] you, they are spirit
[1:30:04] and they
[1:30:06] are life."
[1:30:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:18] You know
[1:30:21] the thing about this the thing about
[1:30:23] this here
[1:30:25] word
[1:30:27] is that it has to be mixed by faith. You
[1:30:30] have to have faith. You got got to
[1:30:34] believe it.
[1:30:37] How many know it just doesn't do any
[1:30:38] good unless you believe it.
[1:30:45] And if you do believe it,
[1:30:48] well,
[1:30:49] all things are possible. There's nothing
[1:30:52] impossible
[1:30:54] to those that believe.
[1:30:57] No impossibilities anymore. All things
[1:31:00] are possible. But the scribes and the
[1:31:02] Pharisees, if you'll notice, it didn't
[1:31:04] do them any good. No matter. and and and
[1:31:07] talking about this great God that is all
[1:31:10] powerful and he actually raised Lazarus
[1:31:13] from the dead after that. They probably
[1:31:15] went to the funeral. Can you imagine
[1:31:17] going to a man's funeral and burying the
[1:31:19] guy and then about 4 days later he's
[1:31:21] walking around?
[1:31:24] Boy, you would have to have a cold heart
[1:31:28] to hate the one that did it.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; To not believe.
[1:31:36] But the Pharisees, they just could not
[1:31:39] seem to believe.
[1:31:42] Notice he said to the Pharisees, "Woe
[1:31:45] unto you scribes and Pharisees,
[1:31:47] hypocrites, because you build the tombs
[1:31:49] of the prophets and garnish the
[1:31:51] supplicants of the righteous and say, if
[1:31:53] we had been in the days of our father,
[1:31:55] we would not have been partakers with
[1:31:56] them in the blood of the prophets." I
[1:31:59] thought, you know, there's one thing
[1:32:00] that this Bible, this Bible will do, and
[1:32:02] it will identify who you are.
[1:32:06] Whether you're a hypocrite, whether
[1:32:08] you're serpent seed, whether you're a
[1:32:10] buzzard, or whether you're an eagle.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:32:16] And how in this case, in this scripture,
[1:32:18] it tells you that what you do with the
[1:32:22] manifestation.
[1:32:24] See, a lot of people claim that they
[1:32:26] believe the word. Yeah, I believe the
[1:32:27] Bible. I believe the word. But the
[1:32:29] question is, do you believe the
[1:32:31] manifestation of the word?
[1:32:37] It's quite something how that brother
[1:32:39] Brandon when he was preaching the
[1:32:40] message about what I just read you and
[1:32:42] all it wasn't but a few quotes later
[1:32:44] that he talked about this fire and this
[1:32:46] pillar fire that came into his window
[1:32:48] when he was born.
[1:32:51] Ain't that right? That window it wasn't
[1:32:52] called a window. It was some kind of
[1:32:54] little door that they open and shut. But
[1:32:56] that light came down in there. People
[1:32:58] will believe that you know Mary was
[1:33:01] overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and so
[1:33:02] forth.
[1:33:04] and so forth. But they can hardly
[1:33:05] believe today that God might do
[1:33:07] something like that with somebody today.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Or even Paul, they don't have a problem
[1:33:13] with that. But what about the voice that
[1:33:14] came out of the uh of the tree and said,
[1:33:17] "Don't drink or smoke or defile you."
[1:33:18] Can you believe the manifestation?
[1:33:22] Don't say you believe the word and then
[1:33:23] don't believe what it does. How many
[1:33:25] believe? You got to believe what it
[1:33:26] does.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:30] So notice here he's talking to them.
[1:33:35] You say, if you had been in the days, if
[1:33:37] we wouldn't have been partakers of them
[1:33:38] which uh in the blood of the prophets,
[1:33:41] wherefore ye be witnesses unto
[1:33:42] yourselves, that ye are the children of
[1:33:44] them which killed the prophets. Fill ye
[1:33:47] up then the measure of your fathers, ye
[1:33:49] serpents, you generation of vipers. How
[1:33:51] can you escape the damnation of hell? He
[1:33:54] says, "Wherefore, behold, I send you
[1:33:56] prophets and scribes and wise men. Some
[1:33:58] of them you shall kill and crucify and
[1:34:00] scourge in your synagogue." Amen.
[1:34:04] And persecute them from city to city.
[1:34:09] Amen.
[1:34:13] John 8. Okay. John 8. Another one.
[1:34:18] He was talking to the Pharisees.
[1:34:21] They answered him, "We be Abraham's
[1:34:23] seed." And were never in bondage to any
[1:34:26] man. How sayest thou, "Ye shall be made
[1:34:28] free." Jesus answered them, "Verily,
[1:34:30] verily, I say unto you, whosoever
[1:34:32] committh sin is the servant of sin. And
[1:34:34] the servant abideth not in the house
[1:34:36] forever, but the son abideth forever. If
[1:34:38] the son therefore shall make you free,
[1:34:40] you shall be in freed. I know that you
[1:34:43] are Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill
[1:34:45] me because my word
[1:34:52] has no place in you. How many is glad
[1:34:57] that there's place in your heart for the
[1:35:00] word? You receive the word.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; They couldn't receive the word. How? Oh
[1:35:06] my. If you can't, if you need healing
[1:35:08] and you can't accept Isaiah 53, you're
[1:35:11] not healed.
[1:35:13] How many knows that he sent forth his
[1:35:16] word and healed them?
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; That's what he still does today. He sent
[1:35:20] forth his word, he healed them. God
[1:35:23] still sends forth his word and he saves
[1:35:26] people. He still sends Acts 2:38,
[1:35:28] "Repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:35:30] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:35:32] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:35:34] Holy Ghost, the promises to you, to your
[1:35:36] children, to them that are far off."
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; How many believe that's still inspired?
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's the promise. How many
[1:35:46] glad to be in the promised land?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; This is the promised land. Israel had
[1:35:50] their promised land. We've got our
[1:35:52] promised land.
[1:35:54] How many knows it's some good grapes?
[1:35:56] They had grapes. They had to have
[1:35:57] several men to pack them.
[1:36:01] What is the fruit of the spirit? Joy,
[1:36:05] peace, longsuffering. I hope you got so
[1:36:08] much it'll take about two of you to pack
[1:36:10] it. Brother Abram says, "Man, I he says,
[1:36:14] you know, I just need to be twice my
[1:36:16] size." He said,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; "I feel so good. I be twice my size.
[1:36:20] That's how good it How many glad to be
[1:36:22] free? How many glad to be have the peace
[1:36:23] of God in your heart? Why? How did it
[1:36:26] come? It came by the word of God. Why in
[1:36:28] the world do you think that preachers
[1:36:30] preach? They preach the word of God and
[1:36:32] it falls, Amen. on people right then and
[1:36:34] there and they receive it. It's much
[1:36:37] more powerful than an altar call is for
[1:36:39] the word to go forth and you receive it
[1:36:41] right there and right then.
[1:36:45] That's how we're supposed to get it.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember
[1:36:54] the centurion.
[1:36:57] Amen. Had a soldier sick and so forth, I
[1:36:59] believe it was. And he said, "Just speak
[1:37:02] the word. I'm not worthy that you come
[1:37:04] under my roof."
[1:37:06] Man, that's a humble man.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy that you come under my
[1:37:09] roof if you But I'm a man under
[1:37:11] authority. I know that if I say
[1:37:12] something, somebody's going to go do
[1:37:14] something. Ain't that right? He says, "I
[1:37:16] know that you're this under authority. I
[1:37:18] know that if you'll say it, it'll be."
[1:37:20] And Jesus marvelled at his faith. Be it
[1:37:23] unto you according to your faith. How
[1:37:25] many believe that goes for us tonight?
[1:37:27] Be it unto you according to your faith.
[1:37:31] Amen. Every promise. But I like that.
[1:37:35] Listen, because Abraham because the word
[1:37:37] didn't have any place in you. I speak
[1:37:40] that which I have seen of my father and
[1:37:42] do that which you have seen of your
[1:37:43] father. You do that which you have seen
[1:37:45] of your father. If ye be Abraham's
[1:37:47] children, you do the works of Abraham.
[1:37:50] Amen. Now you seek to kill me, a man
[1:37:53] that has told you the truth, which I
[1:37:55] have heard of God. This did not Abraham.
[1:37:59] Oh my, I don't think I can get it right
[1:38:01] quick, but
[1:38:04] there was another one I really wanted to
[1:38:05] share. Here I am in the middle of this
[1:38:07] one. I need to finish this one first.
[1:38:14] There it is.
[1:38:16] All right. So he says u
[1:38:24] but you seek to kill me. This did not
[1:38:26] Abraham you do the deeds of your father.
[1:38:29] Then they said unto him, we be not born
[1:38:31] of fornication. We have one father, even
[1:38:34] God.
[1:38:37] It just goes to show it doesn't matter
[1:38:38] how religious you are if you don't
[1:38:40] recognize the God that's in front of
[1:38:42] you.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:45] You want to call You want to call
[1:38:47] Abraham your father and God your fa I
[1:38:49] mean Abraham your the father of the
[1:38:50] faith so to speak children of Abraham
[1:38:53] and God is your father and then you
[1:38:55] absolutely want to kill the very Messiah
[1:38:58] when he comes. Jesus said unto him if
[1:39:01] God were your father you would love me.
[1:39:03] Amen. How many believe that? How many
[1:39:06] loves him?
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? That means God is
[1:39:09] your father.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; I proceed and came forth from God.
[1:39:12] Neither I came of myself but he sent me.
[1:39:14] Why do you not understand my speech?
[1:39:16] Because you cannot hear my word. It's a
[1:39:21] terrible thing when the word when God
[1:39:23] speaks and that word can't penetrate
[1:39:26] somebody's life.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; It's a terrible thing. Can't change him.
[1:39:31] Won't change him.
[1:39:33] Amen.
[1:39:36] There he again says, "You're of your
[1:39:38] father the devil and his lust will you
[1:39:39] do on down." He says, "Which one of you
[1:39:41] convinces me of sin? If I say the truth,
[1:39:44] truth, why do you not believe me?" And
[1:39:46] here's the statement. Here's the punch
[1:39:48] line on that. He that is of God heareth
[1:39:52] God's words.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Ye therefore hear them not because ye
[1:39:59] are not of God. Another place I told you
[1:40:04] and ye believe not. the works that I do
[1:40:06] in my father's name, they bear witness
[1:40:08] of me. But ye believe not, because you
[1:40:11] are not of my sheep.
[1:40:14] As I said unto you, my sheep hear my
[1:40:18] voice, and I know them, and they follow
[1:40:21] me. Praise the Lord. How many glad for
[1:40:24] that? And I give unto them eternal life,
[1:40:27] and they shall never perish. How many
[1:40:30] glad? Neither shall any man pluck them
[1:40:32] out of my hand. Another illustration,
[1:40:36] John
[1:40:38] 12
[1:40:40] verse 44. Jesus cried and said, "He that
[1:40:44] believeth on me believeth not on me, but
[1:40:49] on him, wait a minute, but on him that
[1:40:53] sent me."
[1:40:56] Amen. How How much we can say that about
[1:40:59] the prophet of God? If you believe the
[1:41:01] prophet, you believe the pillar of fire.
[1:41:03] You ain't just believing the prophet,
[1:41:05] you're believing the God that sent the
[1:41:07] prophet.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; I am come the light of the world, and
[1:41:14] whosoever believeth on me should not
[1:41:16] abide in darkness. If any man hear my
[1:41:20] words and believe not, I judge him not.
[1:41:23] For I came not to judge the world, but
[1:41:24] to save the world. Now, notice this is
[1:41:27] what I want to kind of stop with here.
[1:41:29] He that rejectth me and receiveth not my
[1:41:33] words hath one that judgeth him. The
[1:41:35] word that I have spoken, the same shall
[1:41:37] judge him on the last day. That's not
[1:41:39] what I was looking for. It's the next
[1:41:40] one. For I have not spoken of myself,
[1:41:42] but the father which sent me, he gave me
[1:41:45] the commandment that I should say and
[1:41:47] what I should speak.
[1:41:50] Amen. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:42:00] John John 17 and13 it says and now come
[1:42:05] I to thee. It was Jesus's prayer where
[1:42:08] he prayed for those who would afterwards
[1:42:10] come and so forth.
[1:42:13] Now I come to thee and these things I
[1:42:16] speak in the world that they might have
[1:42:18] my joy fulfilled in themselves. I have
[1:42:21] given them thy word. How many believe
[1:42:25] that when Jesus spoke, it was the
[1:42:27] father's words that he was bringing? It
[1:42:31] was God's very word that he was
[1:42:33] bringing,
[1:42:35] not somebody else, but God's word.
[1:42:39] And the world has hated them because
[1:42:41] they are not of the world, even as I am
[1:42:43] not of the world. And I pray that thou
[1:42:46] shouldest not take them out of the
[1:42:48] world, but that thou shouldest keep them
[1:42:50] from the evil. They are not of the world
[1:42:53] even as I am not of the world. How many
[1:42:55] believes that we are from somewhere
[1:42:58] else? We are coming from a different
[1:43:01] world. And then I don't know that I've
[1:43:04] got it but Jesus said one place he says
[1:43:07] at that day what will you know at that
[1:43:10] day you will know that the father is in
[1:43:12] me. I and the father you are in me and I
[1:43:17] am in you. How many is glad to be part
[1:43:22] of God,
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; part of his thoughts, part of his being?
[1:43:26] Not just the word going forth out of his
[1:43:28] mouth, but we are part of that word.
[1:43:31] We're actually born, the Bible says,
[1:43:32] without going into too many things. He
[1:43:35] says we're born by the word of God.
[1:43:38] Amen. God bless you. Let's stand
[1:43:40] tonight. You love him.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:54] Let's bow our heads.
[1:43:56] Lord Jesus, as we come to the close of
[1:43:59] this service,
[1:44:01] speaking, Father, of your word, the
[1:44:05] Bible, simplicity, but yet it's the most
[1:44:08] powerful thing that there's on the face
[1:44:10] of the earth. a sinner finding this
[1:44:13] Bible somewhere in the
[1:44:16] side of the road or whatever it might
[1:44:17] be. If they could just open it and the
[1:44:20] grace of God would reach down and just
[1:44:22] open their eyes and help them to believe
[1:44:24] it, it could change them. Lord, it could
[1:44:28] change them from a sinner, a drunkard, a
[1:44:31] harlot, a prostitute, a gambler,
[1:44:34] somebody that's mean,
[1:44:36] Lord, to a beautiful person, to a good
[1:44:39] person, a kind person. Lord, this Bible
[1:44:42] has the power to change lives, change
[1:44:44] the universe. We know that this Bible
[1:44:47] right here is going to change this
[1:44:49] world, Father, from a world of sin. It's
[1:44:52] going to come and it's going to crush
[1:44:54] and grind to powder the kingdoms that
[1:44:57] are here now. Russia, America, China,
[1:45:01] North Korea, all the nations of the
[1:45:04] world will be ground to powder, Lord,
[1:45:06] when you come. The stone that was heuned
[1:45:08] from the word from the mountain, Lord.
[1:45:10] It'll come one of these days and it'll
[1:45:12] transform. But before that happens, God,
[1:45:15] we believe, go Lord Jesus, that you're
[1:45:17] going to take your people that's been
[1:45:18] redeemed by your blood that's believed
[1:45:20] your word,
[1:45:22] Father has taken it and allowed it to
[1:45:25] change them from what they are to what
[1:45:26] they should be. We ask, God, that you'd
[1:45:29] help us to be at that great day, Lord
[1:45:31] Jesus, at the rapture, at the
[1:45:33] resurrection, Lord Jesus, to be ready to
[1:45:35] meet you. For we believe it with all of
[1:45:37] our heart. God, help us to believe all
[1:45:39] of your word. For we know that our soul,
[1:45:42] as your prophet has said, hangs over
[1:45:44] hell by one of one word of God. To
[1:45:46] disbelieve one word could cast us off in
[1:45:49] hell. Lord, so we believe every word,
[1:45:51] God, that you have spoken. Lord, help us
[1:45:53] to live every word. Father, forgive us
[1:45:55] of our sins and shortcomings. Lord, we
[1:45:58] ask, God, that you lead us, Father.
[1:46:00] Lord, coming into winter now, Lord. It
[1:46:02] may be cold. It may be be get a little
[1:46:04] kind of stiff outside but Lord keep the
[1:46:07] tenderness of Christ in our hearts and
[1:46:09] in our soul. Keep us warm in your
[1:46:11] presence Lord Father through these
[1:46:13] winter months. Lord we ask God that you
[1:46:15] just bless each one now in Jesus name.
[1:46:19] Amen and amen. God bless you brother
[1:46:22] Brad.
[1:46:29] My God is awome. [singing]
[1:46:33] He can move the mountains,
[1:46:38] keep [singing] me in the valley,
[1:46:42] hide me from [singing and music] the
[1:46:44] rain.
[1:46:47] My God is awome. [singing]
[1:46:51] Heals me [music] when I'm broken.

[1:47:20] So awome. [music and singing]
[1:47:23] My God is awome.
[1:47:28] [singing and music] He's awome.
[1:47:33] He's awome. [music]
[1:47:37] He's [singing] awome.
[1:47:40] My God is awome.

[1:47:48] world. Giver [music]
[1:47:50] of salvation.
[1:47:53] By his [singing] stripes I'm healed.
[1:47:58] My God is awome. [music and singing]
[1:48:02] Today I am forgi.
[1:48:06] His grace [music and singing] is why I'm
[1:48:08] living.

[1:48:29] He's [singing] awome.
[1:48:33] My God is [music] awome.
[1:48:37] [singing]
[1:48:38] He's awome.
[1:48:43] So awome. [singing]
[1:48:47] He's [music] awome.
[1:48:51] My God is awome.
[1:48:56] Aren't you thankful for an awesome God?
[1:48:59] You [music] know, I was thinking as
[1:49:00] brother Baler was preaching and not to
[1:49:02] not to repreach his sermon, but what an
[1:49:05] awesome God. You know, the song sing
[1:49:07] talk about the there if the if the sky
[1:49:10] was parchment made, there wouldn't be
[1:49:11] enough parchment to write the goodness
[1:49:13] of God. And I think about the the
[1:49:16] awesomeness of God. And I think, praise
[1:49:18] the Lord, thank God that men were
[1:49:20] inspired down through the ages to write
[1:49:23] and pin the things that we've been
[1:49:25] taught, the [music] things that lead us
[1:49:27] and guide us and direct us in our lives.
[1:49:31] God is awesome. Before we go, why don't
[1:49:33] we sing that song? Oh, I want to sing.
[1:49:38] As I journey through the land, [singing]
[1:49:42] singing as I go,
[1:49:46] pointing souls [music and singing] to
[1:49:48] Calvary
[1:49:49] to the crimson flow.
[1:49:53] [singing] Many arrows pierce my soul
[1:49:56] [music]
[1:49:57] from without.
[1:50:00] [singing]
[1:50:01] But my Lord [music] leads me on. And
[1:50:04] through him [singing] I must win. And
[1:50:08] oh, I want to [music] see him. Look upon
[1:50:13] [singing] his face.
[1:50:16] There to sing forever
[1:50:20] of his [singing and music] saving grace.
[1:50:23] And on the streets of glory,
[1:50:27] let [music and singing] me lift my

[1:50:33] [singing and music] last. hither to
[1:50:36] rejoice
[1:50:39] when [music]
[1:50:39] before [singing]
[1:50:40] me billows rise from the mighty deep.
[1:50:46] [music] Then [singing] the Lord directs
[1:50:48] my bar. He does safely [music]
[1:50:52] keep
[1:50:54] and he leads [singing] me gently on
[1:50:58] through this world [music] below.
[1:51:01] And he's a real friend to me. [singing]
[1:51:05] Oh, I love him so
[1:51:08] and oh I want to see [singing]
[1:51:12] him. Look upon his face
