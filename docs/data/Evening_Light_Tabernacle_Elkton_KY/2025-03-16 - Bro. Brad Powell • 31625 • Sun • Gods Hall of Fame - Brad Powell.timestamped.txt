[21:33] Lifted Me Up and Hast not made my foes
[21:35] to Rejoice over
[21:41] me oh oh Lord thou Hast brought up my
[21:45] soul from the grave and thou Hast kept
[21:48] me alive that I that I should not go
[21:50] down to the pit
[21:58] for his anger endureth but a moment in
[22:02] his favor is life weeping may endure for
[22:05] a night but joy cometh in the

[22:53] sing praise to thee and not to the be
[22:55] silent oh Lord my God I will give thanks
[22:58] on thee forever amen God bless you you
[23:01] may be seated brother
[23:15] Brian morning brothers and
[23:22] sisters I was uh thinking about that one
[23:24] scripture we read in that Psalm I'll
[23:27] just reread it it again and it says in
[23:31] in my Prosperity I said I shall never be
[23:34] moved and I was just sitting there um I
[23:37] can't be nothing like I say I say it a
[23:39] lot being honest with you you know you
[23:43] can study all night and you can study in
[23:45] the morning and you can still be blank
[23:48] but I was just thinking in my in my own
[23:51] life uh the old army Navigator in me you
[23:55] know you can be in the middle of a
[23:57] desert you have no reference point have
[24:00] nothing that can guide you to walk and
[24:02] find your place but there's two things
[24:04] that God gives you to know where you're
[24:06] at that you're always going to have a
[24:08] sun that moves and stars at night so God
[24:11] always gives you reference points always
[24:14] gives you the ability to find where
[24:17] you're going and the destination that
[24:19] you need to follow and I was just
[24:21] thinking as I was uh at as you can tell
[24:25] I'm not going to say I know I say that a
[24:26] lot but on that uh from Corinthians the
[24:29] fif 1 Corinthians the 15th
[24:32] chapter of the First Corinthians those
[24:35] scriptures that are up there really
[24:36] struck me this morning and it goes I'm
[24:40] totally off what my point this morning
[24:43] but for us as Christians in this day and
[24:45] AG that this morning if the the reality
[24:49] of the
[24:50] Resurrection really doesn't have a hold
[24:53] on us this morning what are we where are
[24:55] we at what Have We Become and I was
[24:58] thinking uh I'll just read this this
[25:02] is and I was all those scriptures
[25:05] speak you you can go to church all your
[25:08] life you can say you're a Christian all
[25:11] your life you can fool your neighbors
[25:14] you can fool your brothers and sisters
[25:16] but does the reality of the Resurrection
[25:19] really possess your heart and soul this
[25:21] morning is your sole desire and your
[25:23] life to be part of the Lord and his
[25:26] kingdom this morning and I and and like
[25:28] the brothers have been talking about the
[25:30] last couple of weeks it's not the church
[25:34] it's you the individual in the church
[25:36] that matters and that relationship that
[25:38] you have this morning with Jesus Christ
[25:41] and I was um this is this is the quote
[25:45] from yesterday that was in the voice of
[25:47] God
[25:48] recording and uh it goes back to what
[25:50] brother Thomas was talking about on on
[25:53] Sunday last week and um
[25:58] I was just thinking about it this
[26:00] morning I I'll try not to go all over
[26:03] the place this morning like but I'll
[26:05] just read what brother brandom had to
[26:07] say in this quote kind of St uh sticks
[26:09] to what I'm thinking about this morning
[26:12] and brother Thomas was talking about
[26:13] this Sunday and we all know and this is
[26:16] what brother brandom had to say an eagle
[26:18] won't build his nest on the ground of
[26:20] course it won't Eagles build their nest
[26:23] way as high as he can get it in the
[26:25] highest peak well any bird of Praise is
[26:29] going to do this because it's vulnerable
[26:31] and it goes on to say the Reason God
[26:33] liken his church you are a candle that
[26:37] set on a hill so I'm I'm going to go to
[26:40] that scripture later but you're that
[26:42] candle that God sets on the hill for
[26:45] people to see the life of Jesus Christ
[26:47] in you you're that candle you're that
[26:49] representation this morning of the
[26:51] Church of Jesus Christ it's an awesome
[26:54] responsibility that we have and he goes
[26:57] on to say
[26:59] that's right High ambition High
[27:02] anticipations we're expecting great
[27:04] things and I hope everyone here is
[27:06] expecting you know as the world gets
[27:08] older we all know that we are needy
[27:09] people and the world is really needful
[27:11] this morning we're not to say well I'm
[27:14] Pentecostal that settles it well you
[27:16] could change that word right there not
[27:19] being sacrilegious and you could say I
[27:21] know all the message that that doesn't
[27:24] settle it either I I don't know for me
[27:27] I'm expect great
[27:29] things and he goes on to say I'm Baptist
[27:32] I'm Methodist I'm Oneness Tess threeness
[27:35] you know you you could put all the
[27:36] doctrines of the that people go D stray
[27:39] with in the message in that sentence too
[27:42] whatever you are that doesn't satisfy me
[27:45] I've got an ambition to move on till I
[27:48] meet him up and up and I that goes back
[27:50] to what what that chapter in Corinthians
[27:53] really stuck to me you know if we don't
[27:55] have the power of the Resurrection in us
[27:57] this morning
[27:58] really miserable people you're going to
[28:00] be miserable all your life until that
[28:02] power takes a hold of your spirit your
[28:04] soul this morning I got that ambition to
[28:07] move on until I meet up and up I receive
[28:10] the Holy Ghost and that settles it I
[28:13] didn't it didn't with me I'm just still
[28:16] talking I'm moving higher and higher
[28:18] that's right just moving on higher
[28:21] higher Ambitions higher expectations
[28:24] Ambitions now the brother brandom's
[28:26] talking the all these expect ations and
[28:28] all these Ambitions are in the word of
[28:31] God nothing of these things are outside
[28:34] of the word of God or the message
[28:36] there's nothing new about it it's the
[28:38] word of God and the power of Jesus
[28:40] Christ and he goes on to say here not
[28:43] well we've got plenty of nice little
[28:45] churches and and he goes on we just
[28:48] settle down me and this crowd that goes
[28:50] what I've been hearing the other
[28:52] ministers talk about you know the this
[28:54] church or any church can settle down and
[28:58] find itself off the Mark just as easy
[29:00] and he goes to say here we got a pretty
[29:03] nice little church we just settled down
[29:05] me and this little cow crowd we don't
[29:08] want none of the rest of you in our
[29:10] group you can have that anywhere in the
[29:13] world not me I just want to reach out a
[29:15] hand to every Fallen Creed brother ever
[29:18] what it is bring them in Ambitions do
[29:21] something expectations for a man that
[29:24] has ever walked in the truth is to see
[29:26] the truth you'll never get him in there
[29:29] the way by Drowning him you've got to
[29:32] put your armor that's really true you
[29:34] can you can drown people in the word of
[29:36] God and the message of the hour but you
[29:39] God has to be on the other side of it if
[29:42] God ain't on the other side of it
[29:43] they're really not going to move not to
[29:46] say that you don't tell people the truth
[29:48] you've you've got to put your arm around
[29:51] him love him let them know who you
[29:53] you're a brother and then something will
[29:56] happen you know I as in my my younger
[29:58] life that's you know occasionally when I
[30:00] was younger before God saved me you know
[30:03] the kind Christian is the one you
[30:05] remember the Christian that shows you
[30:07] love and understanding without brow
[30:10] beating is you is the one that you
[30:12] really remember and he goes on to say
[30:15] you've got to put your arm around him
[30:17] love him let him know what you you're a
[30:19] brother then something will happen if
[30:22] you're kin to Jehovah you'll do that if
[30:25] you got his Spirit he comes to the one
[30:29] that hated him despised him and spits in
[30:31] and spit in his face basically no matter
[30:34] what what they did to him he still loved
[30:36] them and was willing to give them
[30:38] salvation and he prayed and he saved
[30:40] them certainly and that's the spirit of
[30:42] God in man and let
[30:45] me and I was just thinking about you
[30:47] know when I read that up there on the
[30:50] thing I when I read the one from 1
[30:53] Corinthians the 15th chapter I'm not
[30:56] going to turn to it and read it I won't
[30:57] won do that this morning but I
[30:59] immediately go to 2 Corinthians and the
[31:01] 5th chapter and if there's any Bible
[31:04] that you want to read chapter in the
[31:06] Bible just like Romans the eth chapter
[31:09] that's a Bible in the chapter that you
[31:10] really want to know I'm not going to
[31:12] read it this morning but I'll just read
[31:14] to in uh Matthew the 5th chapter and
[31:16] then I'll sit down I was I was listening
[31:19] to brother random last night and this
[31:21] morning and it goes to what this uh
[31:25] quote was about it's the fifth chapter
[31:28] and it's I'll start at I won't read this
[31:31] is a long chapter I promise I won't read
[31:33] it all starting at about the 10th verse
[31:35] of the fifth
[31:37] chapter blessed blessed are they which
[31:40] are persecuted for righteousness sake
[31:42] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven and
[31:45] blessed are you when men shall revive
[31:47] you persecute you and shall say manner
[31:50] of evil against you falsely for my sake
[31:53] you know you have to accept the fact
[31:55] when you give people the truth not
[31:57] everyone is going to receive it openly
[32:00] and you just have to love people whether
[32:02] they receive it or not and he goes on to
[32:03] say rejoice and be exceedingly glad for
[32:07] great is your reward in heaven for so
[32:10] persecuted they the prophets which were
[32:12] before you and I was just thinking about
[32:15] these scriptures right here from like
[32:16] the 13th to the 19th this morning and
[32:19] this is it goes to what brother branam
[32:21] was talking about in this quote and we
[32:23] all know this scripture here the 13th
[32:26] verse here you are the s of the earth
[32:29] and if ye the salt have lost his favor
[32:32] where shall it be salted and henceforth
[32:34] good for nothing but cast out and be
[32:36] trodden under their foot of men so
[32:38] you're that salt goes to what I was
[32:40] saying earlier you're the salt that
[32:42] changes people's life it's the
[32:44] relationship you have with Jesus Christ
[32:46] this morning that shows something to
[32:48] people that saltiness that there's
[32:50] something better than what they're
[32:52] living in their lives and he goes on to
[32:54] say you are the light of the world a
[32:56] city that is set on on a hill cannot be
[32:58] hid and it goes back to what this quote
[33:00] these scriptures here can be hid neither
[33:03] do men put a light a do men light a
[33:05] candle on put it under a bushel of
[33:07] course we know that would be stupid
[33:08] you'd burn the whole house down but put
[33:11] but put the Candlestick in it give it
[33:13] light onto all that are in the house let
[33:16] your light so shine before men that they
[33:19] may see your good works and glorify your
[33:21] father which is in heaven think not that
[33:24] I have come to destroy the law or the
[33:27] prophets I have not come to destroy but
[33:29] to fill and then this last verse I'll
[33:31] finish with this L we all know this
[33:33] verse for verily I say unto you until
[33:36] Heaven and Earth pass away one JW or one
[33:38] ttle shall not wise pass from the law
[33:41] till it be fulfilled and I was thinking
[33:43] this
[33:44] morning if you I don't I don't want to
[33:48] read a lot I was going to let me just
[33:50] read this a couple of these verses if I
[33:52] didn't lose my place here this
[33:56] morning so
[33:58] I can only speak wherever you're at in
[34:00] your relationship this morning whether
[34:02] you're on in a valley or you're on a
[34:05] Mountaintop it can your circumstances
[34:07] can change as long as you put your heart
[34:10] and trust in the Lord this morning and
[34:13] um I want
[34:16] us we all know this I'll start at uh
[34:20] about the seventh verse here and just
[34:22] read a few of these and sit down I know
[34:24] I just said that I promise I won't say
[34:25] it again the seventh ver remember them
[34:28] which rule over you who have spoken unto
[34:30] you the word of God whose whose Faith
[34:33] follow and consider the end of their
[34:36] conversation and then we all everyone
[34:38] knows the scripture Jesus Christ the
[34:41] same yesterday today and forever and be
[34:43] not carried away with diverse and
[34:45] strange doctrines for it is a good thing
[34:48] that the heart be established and it
[34:50] goes back to what I was saying out of
[34:52] Corinthians and at what this quote says
[34:54] here be not carried away with diverse of
[34:57] Str doctrines for it is a good thing
[34:59] that the heart be established with Grace
[35:02] and not with meat which have not
[35:04] profited them which have then have not
[35:08] been occupied therein forgive my reading
[35:10] here and we are in an altar whereof that
[35:13] have we have an altar whereof they have
[35:16] no right to eat where of serve the
[35:18] Tabernacle for whose um I'm out of place
[35:22] there I'm just going to finish with this
[35:24] simple thought this morning
[35:28] that's not actually what I wanted to
[35:30] read but I from from my heart the only
[35:33] thing I can say is as as the word of God
[35:37] present presents itself to us in this
[35:39] age that we live in I find
[35:42] that we I don't know how to say this I I
[35:45] only can speak for myself I need that
[35:48] new refreshing every day in my heart and
[35:50] life this morning you you need to know
[35:54] that you know that Jesus Christ is alive
[35:56] this morning there there's no hope for
[35:58] us outside of that this morning and if I
[36:00] could say anything that matters anything
[36:03] it it's the truth and God will fulfill
[36:06] his word in our hearts and lives this
[36:08] morning brother David or brother Josh

[1:13:36] dance in back there I thought Lord help
[1:13:38] me help me uh submit to this
[1:13:41] atmosphere God is certainly good and
[1:13:43] mindful so if you want to get into your
[1:13:45] Bibles we'll turn into the Book of
[1:13:47] Leviticus and it's just uh I've never I
[1:13:51] just never ceased to be amazed by the
[1:13:53] way God works and his the way he moves I
[1:13:56] I was going to call brother Josh this
[1:13:59] week and ask him would you try to get
[1:14:01] that song Together the champion of God
[1:14:05] or champion of love I think is how it's
[1:14:07] and I thought no I'm just I'm not going
[1:14:09] I'm not going to call him I I'm not
[1:14:11] going to throw a new song on him for the
[1:14:14] congregation but we're going to speak
[1:14:16] this morning on God's Hall of
[1:14:21] Fame we're going to take it through the
[1:14:23] Old Testament the New Testament in
[1:14:25] present day and show you that God has a
[1:14:29] Hall of
[1:14:29] Fame and it was the same yesterday today
[1:14:33] and
[1:14:34] forever it doesn't it doesn't we we
[1:14:36] don't look at our shortcomings we look
[1:14:37] at the we look at the final
[1:14:39] outcome are you with me let's turn to
[1:14:42] Leviticus chapter
[1:14:44] 8 we're going to read here for just a
[1:14:46] little
[1:14:49] bit I got to settle myself down I'm
[1:14:52] shaking like a leaf up here
[1:14:57] Leviticus chapter 8 and the Lord spake
[1:15:01] unto Moses saying take Aaron and his
[1:15:04] sons with him and the garments now I
[1:15:07] want you to notice the garments so here
[1:15:08] he is he's dressing Aaron you know the
[1:15:11] bride is dressed in the word of
[1:15:14] God and take and the garments and the
[1:15:17] anointing oil so now we see Spirit
[1:15:19] coming into
[1:15:20] play and the bullet for the sin offering
[1:15:23] and two Rams and a basket of 11 bread
[1:15:25] and gather thou all the congregation
[1:15:27] together unto the door of the Tabernacle
[1:15:29] of the
[1:15:30] congregation and Moses did as the Lord
[1:15:33] commanded him and the assembly was
[1:15:36] gathered together unto the door of the
[1:15:38] Tabernacle of the
[1:15:41] congregation and Moses said unto the
[1:15:43] congregation this is the thing which the
[1:15:45] Lord commanded to be
[1:15:47] done and Moses brought Aaron and his
[1:15:51] sons and washed them with water where we
[1:15:55] heard that Ephesians 5 and 26 says that
[1:15:58] he might sanctify and cleanse her with
[1:16:01] the washing of the Water by the
[1:16:04] word the same yesterday today and
[1:16:08] forever we're a word
[1:16:11] bride and he put upon him the coat and
[1:16:15] girded him with a girdle and clothed him
[1:16:16] with a robe and put the epod upon him
[1:16:19] and GED him with a curious girdle of the
[1:16:21] epod and bound it unto him therewith and
[1:16:24] he put the breast plate upon him and he
[1:16:26] also put the breastplate the urum and
[1:16:27] thumb and he put the miter on his head
[1:16:30] and on the miter up even on the for
[1:16:32] Forefront did he put the golden plate
[1:16:35] the holy crown as the Lord commanded
[1:16:37] Moses so now we're transferring a royal
[1:16:42] priesthood we've been had a royal
[1:16:44] priesthood transferred to
[1:16:49] us and Moses took the anointing oil now
[1:16:52] watch this this is important mooses
[1:16:54] Moses took the anointing oil and
[1:16:56] Anointed The Tabernacle and all that was
[1:16:58] where the therein and Sanctified them
[1:17:01] and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar
[1:17:03] seven times and Anointed The Altar all
[1:17:06] of the vessels both the Laver and his
[1:17:09] foot and sanctify them so he now is
[1:17:11] taking this anointing oil and I want you
[1:17:13] to notice he's just sprinkling it in the
[1:17:15] church he's anointing the things of the
[1:17:16] church by
[1:17:18] sprinkling there's a there's an certain
[1:17:20] anointing in the
[1:17:22] church there's a sprinkling in the
[1:17:25] church
[1:17:26] systems but what does he do with Aaron
[1:17:30] and he poured the anointing oil upon
[1:17:33] Aaron's head and anointed him to
[1:17:35] sanctify him so brothers and sisters
[1:17:37] that's what we need today in the hour
[1:17:40] we're living in we don't need just a
[1:17:41] sprinkling of the Holy Ghost the church
[1:17:44] world can do the church World things we
[1:17:46] need an anointing poured out upon
[1:17:49] us a holy ghost anointing that we are
[1:17:52] above and we beyond and we become the
[1:17:55] Champions the Hall of Fame champions of
[1:18:00] god let's just pray Heavenly Father we
[1:18:03] come before you today Lord with grateful
[1:18:05] Hearts thankful for this opportunity to
[1:18:07] be in your house and thankful so
[1:18:09] thankful and grateful Lord that we feel
[1:18:11] such a powerful presence amongst us this
[1:18:13] morning and the hearts of the people are
[1:18:15] hungering and pulling already and the
[1:18:17] songs of worship and praise and the
[1:18:19] songs of Victory and and the the the the
[1:18:22] the cries and the anthems of champion
[1:18:24] ships this morning Lord we find
[1:18:26] ourselves in that picture Lord so help
[1:18:29] us Lord to step ourselves out of the way
[1:18:30] that we could be submissive to you
[1:18:32] father that everything we say and do
[1:18:34] would be uh pleasing to you and it would
[1:18:36] be exactly where you want us to take
[1:18:38] this message this morning and we thank
[1:18:40] you Lord for all that you do in our
[1:18:42] lives we pray for healing for those that
[1:18:44] are sick and and for those that can't be
[1:18:46] here we just ask your blessings upon
[1:18:47] them and bless bless now the remainder
[1:18:49] of the service in Jesus name amen you
[1:18:52] can have your seats
[1:18:58] so we look here in Leviticus chapter 8
[1:18:59] and I want you to to kind of look at
[1:19:02] this for a few
[1:19:04] minutes this this anointing o in the
[1:19:07] Bible what does it symbolize so it tells
[1:19:09] us in in Leviticus chapter 8 here that
[1:19:11] he poured this anointing oil upon
[1:19:13] Aaron's head and anointed him to
[1:19:15] sanctify him so we know in The Book of
[1:19:17] Leviticus this is the third book of the
[1:19:19] Hebrew Bible that was written and it
[1:19:21] deals with rituals and laws and
[1:19:23] Logistics that are taken taking place in
[1:19:25] the in the church World on that day so
[1:19:27] this verse comes in a message in a
[1:19:30] passage where God has dealt with Moses
[1:19:33] and Moses or God comes down and he
[1:19:35] commands Moses Moses I want you to set
[1:19:38] the church in
[1:19:39] order you've come out of an exodus
[1:19:41] you've left Egypt now I want you to set
[1:19:43] the church in order and I want you to do
[1:19:45] it this way and I want you to take Aaron
[1:19:48] and his sons and I want you to
[1:19:50] consecrate them as priests priests in
[1:19:53] the church that will follow the order
[1:19:56] that I set before them and so this
[1:19:58] anointing o mentioned in this verse it
[1:20:00] was made from a special recipe you can
[1:20:02] find it and it talks about it in the
[1:20:04] book of Exodus and and so they take this
[1:20:06] special oil and it's used to consecrate
[1:20:09] the priest and watch this it's used to
[1:20:12] set them apart for the service of
[1:20:17] God it sets them apart from everybody
[1:20:20] else and that's what I want to be in
[1:20:21] this hour brothers and sisters I want to
[1:20:23] be set apart from the church world I
[1:20:26] want to be set apart from the people who
[1:20:28] are just doing churchy things I want to
[1:20:31] be a living acting Christian moving with
[1:20:34] God in my life and making a move for God
[1:20:37] on the scene are you with
[1:20:41] me and so here we see see here that even
[1:20:45] in the Old Testament we see the process
[1:20:47] taking place in this very Book of
[1:20:49] Leviticus back here we see a new
[1:20:52] testament uh a new testament order
[1:20:54] taking place in the Old Testament with
[1:20:57] justification sanctification and now
[1:21:00] with the anointing oil which is a symbol
[1:21:02] of a New Testament Holy
[1:21:04] Ghost what he's doing when he pours out
[1:21:07] the oil over Aaron what he's doing he
[1:21:09] says now I am telling you that God is in
[1:21:13] the
[1:21:14] people that God is in control of the
[1:21:18] church that God will set things in order
[1:21:21] the way it should be not man not my
[1:21:24] ideas not your ideas not my opinions
[1:21:27] they don't matter they're they're worth
[1:21:29] not a whole lot Aaron's opinion in
[1:21:32] himself was worth not a whole lot but
[1:21:35] when they poured the oil on him and he
[1:21:36] found himself covered and saturated in
[1:21:39] the oil of the anointing of the Holy
[1:21:42] Ghost that set Aaron
[1:21:47] apart so we look at this anointing oil
[1:21:49] in the Bible so literally it was a sense
[1:21:52] of anointing oil being poured to to Mark
[1:21:55] a person physically that that person had
[1:21:58] been
[1:21:58] chosen that that person had been
[1:22:01] selected I I I saw a portrait I I was
[1:22:04] looking this up and I began to look I
[1:22:05] thought I want to know how how serious
[1:22:07] this was and I saw a portrait the best
[1:22:09] one I found and Aaron was sitting in a
[1:22:11] in a chair and all of his sons were
[1:22:14] surrounding him and Aaron is is dressed
[1:22:17] in his Priestly robe and everything that
[1:22:18] have been done in in Leviticus that we
[1:22:20] read there in Leviticus 8 and Moses is
[1:22:23] standing behind him
[1:22:25] and he he he he's taking he don't take a
[1:22:28] little
[1:22:30] jar he's not taking one of
[1:22:33] these now he he's not just dabbing a
[1:22:36] little bit on like cologne or
[1:22:38] something but here sits Aaron in this
[1:22:40] chair and he's got a vessel a clay
[1:22:43] vessel a vase and it shows him and he's
[1:22:46] just over the top of his head pouring
[1:22:49] the oil over Aaron this was a sloppy
[1:22:52] mess
[1:22:54] but one thing Aaron could prove he could
[1:22:57] prove before everybody that he went in
[1:22:59] the presence of that I have been in the
[1:23:01] presence of God because I'm anointed
[1:23:03] from head to toe with the anointing of
[1:23:06] God Almighty that's where we need to be
[1:23:09] in this hour anointed from head to toe
[1:23:11] with the anointing of the Holy Ghost and
[1:23:13] you'll look different you'll walk
[1:23:15] different you'll talk different before
[1:23:16] the people you come in contact with it
[1:23:19] set him apart from who the Ordinary
[1:23:22] People was
[1:23:25] so this this oil let's look at what it
[1:23:28] does for us what it did for him back in
[1:23:31] those days it let him stand before the
[1:23:35] people as an anointed servant of God and
[1:23:38] a mediator between the children of
[1:23:41] Israel and
[1:23:43] God you know there's people that take
[1:23:45] that and run with
[1:23:48] that did you hear
[1:23:50] me there's people that think we can let
[1:23:52] our family members in
[1:23:55] that we're
[1:23:56] mediators that anointing oil does not
[1:23:58] give us the mediation rights we've been
[1:24:01] there has been given one mediator in
[1:24:02] this day and his name was Jesus Christ
[1:24:05] he went to a cross called Calvary and
[1:24:07] the blood was shed and he stands as the
[1:24:09] mediator between us and God and that's
[1:24:11] the only that's the only bloodline it
[1:24:14] is but what that Holy Ghost what that
[1:24:17] anointing does for us in this case it
[1:24:20] gives us Divine empowerment and it gives
[1:24:23] us Authority
[1:24:27] that Holy Ghost when it comes upon us it
[1:24:30] equips us just like it equipped him as
[1:24:33] the oil was poured out on him it put him
[1:24:35] in a place in a presence that he can now
[1:24:37] say I am God's man on the
[1:24:45] scene how many of you are amateur
[1:24:48] Gods well some of you
[1:24:51] are I said how many of you are amateur
[1:24:54] God
[1:24:55] the prophet said when the Holy Ghost
[1:24:57] comes upon you become just like God you
[1:24:59] become an amateur God he said that's
[1:25:01] what Adam was in the very beginning he
[1:25:03] had the power to create the power to
[1:25:05] move the power to make the atmosphere
[1:25:07] anything he
[1:25:08] wanted are we being a restoration
[1:25:11] Bride come on church so here was Aaron
[1:25:15] just an ordinary everyday
[1:25:18] man just like everybody
[1:25:21] else he walked he walked everywhere he
[1:25:24] went he had proba maybe a little cottage
[1:25:26] a little house that he lived in maybe he
[1:25:28] had a little little side job he pedal we
[1:25:31] don't know anything much about him other
[1:25:33] than than he was called to God to be the
[1:25:34] priest but just an ordinary man but when
[1:25:37] that oil was poured over him it done
[1:25:39] something for
[1:25:42] him let me tell you this
[1:25:45] morning if you ever get that oil poured
[1:25:47] on to you young people if you haven't
[1:25:50] had the Holy Ghost if you're a new
[1:25:51] Christian you don't know what it means
[1:25:53] to have the anointing allil the Holy
[1:25:55] Ghost poured upon you it will make do
[1:25:57] something for you it'll make you
[1:25:59] different than what you are the before
[1:26:02] you got the
[1:26:04] oil it's a presence on the inside that
[1:26:08] changes it's a nature change that
[1:26:11] happens on the
[1:26:14] inside there's something that changes it
[1:26:16] reminds me of that song the two
[1:26:19] coats there was two coats before me an
[1:26:21] old and a new
[1:26:24] I could have had either but what should
[1:26:26] I
[1:26:28] do the old coat was torn the old coat
[1:26:32] was torn but the other one was new and
[1:26:34] had never been worn I tell you the best
[1:26:36] thing I ever did was put on that new
[1:26:40] coat the best thing you'll ever do is
[1:26:43] put on that new coat and let the Holy
[1:26:44] Ghost dwell on the inside and let it
[1:26:47] lead and guide and direct you every step
[1:26:49] that you take of your life you say well
[1:26:52] that makes you perfect no it makes me
[1:26:53] human and it makes me fallible but it
[1:26:55] makes me get
[1:26:57] [Applause]
[1:27:04] up so Aaron just an ordinary guy just an
[1:27:09] ordinary guy under the anointing of the
[1:27:12] Holy
[1:27:14] Ghost he began to look
[1:27:17] different you won't look the
[1:27:20] same when you get the Holy
[1:27:23] Ghost you say well I've been in church
[1:27:25] my whole life nothing really changed you
[1:27:27] ain't never got the Holy
[1:27:29] Ghost you're still in
[1:27:31] Egypt I said you're still in Egypt you
[1:27:34] still eating onions and eating Garlic
[1:27:36] you're still in Egypt you're working for
[1:27:38] a slave called the devil because you
[1:27:39] never got the Holy Ghost if nothing ever
[1:27:41] changed when you come to Christ you
[1:27:43] never got an
[1:27:47] experience because the Holy Ghost makes
[1:27:49] you look different act different walk
[1:27:50] different talk different you quit
[1:27:52] listening to the lies of the devil
[1:27:58] how do you do that the Holy Ghost gives
[1:28:00] you the confidence knowing that with
[1:28:02] Christ all things are
[1:28:06] possible this oil make it's marking
[1:28:10] Aaron as dedicated to God's service it's
[1:28:12] separating him from an ordinary
[1:28:16] life you know we all got neighbors have
[1:28:18] everybody here got a neighbor are you
[1:28:20] different than your
[1:28:22] neighbor some of you says I sure hope
[1:28:25] so I know some of you
[1:28:27] neighbors I hope so
[1:28:29] too but Aaron was no longer ordinary
[1:28:33] anymore something had happened something
[1:28:35] be to take place and this oil absolutely
[1:28:37] set him apart the oil sets the bride
[1:28:40] apart from the
[1:28:42] church remember what I said as Mo as
[1:28:45] Aaron began to sprinkle or Moses be to
[1:28:47] sprinkle the oil in the
[1:28:49] church nothing wrong with church systems
[1:28:51] there's a place for them but there's a
[1:28:53] place for a bride that is a walking
[1:28:57] talking action driven bride of Jesus
[1:29:04] Christ so this we look at this oil now
[1:29:07] and I want you to look at this because
[1:29:09] God is looking for individuals in this
[1:29:12] day God is looking for individuals in
[1:29:14] this day to to set apart from the world
[1:29:18] individuals that will live a life that
[1:29:20] that is pleasing to God he's looking for
[1:29:23] individuals that will prove that God is
[1:29:27] alive and I think about church a lot and
[1:29:31] I think about the people in the church
[1:29:33] and a church is only as
[1:29:35] alive as the people that are living in
[1:29:37] the
[1:29:40] church when we become
[1:29:43] ritualistic are we really alive for
[1:29:48] God when we if if if God has placed
[1:29:52] something on your heart and you're not
[1:29:53] obedient to it are you really living for
[1:29:56] God
[1:29:58] no but when God places something on the
[1:30:01] inside under the anointing under the
[1:30:03] inspiration of the Holy
[1:30:05] Ghost you'll examine that make sure that
[1:30:09] it's from God and you will move and act
[1:30:11] upon what God is asking you to
[1:30:14] do how else is God going to move in the
[1:30:17] church how else is God going to speak to
[1:30:20] us as individuals if he doesn't lay
[1:30:22] something on the pastor's heart
[1:30:23] something on the preacher's heart how is
[1:30:25] God going to come down and meet your
[1:30:27] needs how is God going to have somebody
[1:30:29] to lay hands upon you if nobody ever
[1:30:31] accepts the call of God in their
[1:30:34] life but it's under the anointing of the
[1:30:36] Holy Ghost that we're able to do these
[1:30:38] things because under the anointing of
[1:30:40] the Holy Ghost doubt has to
[1:30:43] flee listen to what this does under the
[1:30:45] anointing of the Holy Ghost under the
[1:30:47] anointing of the Holy Ghost doubt has to
[1:30:50] flee fear has to flee your anxieties
[1:30:55] have to flee listen to me doubt fear and
[1:30:58] anxiety can't stay in the same vessel at
[1:31:02] the Holy
[1:31:05] Ghost I need to slow down give y'all
[1:31:07] time to
[1:31:14] applaud because light and darkness will
[1:31:17] not coexist in the same
[1:31:19] environment I've been in a cave before
[1:31:22] I've been in a cave so deep but I
[1:31:24] thought I wasn't coming out I was scared
[1:31:26] my wife we won't get into
[1:31:30] that but in that cave we turned off all
[1:31:33] the lights and I'm going to tell you you
[1:31:34] couldn't see your hand this far in front
[1:31:35] of your
[1:31:36] face there was such a darkness in there
[1:31:39] it was an eerie dark it was just almost
[1:31:41] a hellish
[1:31:43] atmosphere I said man we got to turn
[1:31:45] some lights on and we had a little low
[1:31:47] flashlight and we lit that little and
[1:31:49] you could see a room a c a cavern bigger
[1:31:52] than this church building right here
[1:31:53] just wide open why was that because
[1:31:56] light pushed out the Darkness Darkness
[1:31:58] can't exist where light is if your life
[1:32:01] is dark this morning if your life is Dre
[1:32:04] this morning get the light of the Holy
[1:32:06] Ghost on the inside and darkness has to
[1:32:09] flee sickness has to
[1:32:14] flee under the anointing of the Holy
[1:32:16] Ghost under the anointing of the Holy
[1:32:19] Ghost you are able to overcome The
[1:32:21] Temptations that plague your
[1:32:26] mind how many of you are
[1:32:29] human you've got
[1:32:32] Temptations you've got thoughts you've
[1:32:34] got desires that you know are not
[1:32:37] pleasing to
[1:32:38] God and if you entertain those thoughts
[1:32:42] if you entertain those desires and those
[1:32:46] Temptations without the Holy
[1:32:50] Ghost I hate to tell you but you're
[1:32:52] going to get caught in Satan's snare
[1:32:55] you're going to find yourself in a snare
[1:32:57] thinking how did I get here I know
[1:32:59] better than this you may have known
[1:33:02] better but you submitted yourself to a
[1:33:04] spirit that wasn't the anointing of the
[1:33:06] Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will
[1:33:09] tell you to turn your back and go the
[1:33:10] other
[1:33:11] direction the Holy Ghost will tell you
[1:33:13] not to say those things not to watch
[1:33:15] those things not to listen to those
[1:33:20] things young
[1:33:22] people you need an experience with the
[1:33:25] Holy Ghost and I trust you've had
[1:33:28] it if not we're willing to pray until we
[1:33:31] get
[1:33:32] it because the Holy Ghost will keep you
[1:33:34] to falling into temptations that will
[1:33:36] scar you for the rest of your
[1:33:42] life you say well I'm this and I'm that
[1:33:44] it won't happen to
[1:33:45] me be
[1:33:48] careful because it can happen to you you
[1:33:51] know Satan is no respector of person
[1:33:55] he don't care if you're the preacher the
[1:33:58] Deacon the lay member the janitor he
[1:34:01] don't
[1:34:02] care his job is to do one thing to steal
[1:34:05] kill and destroy he don't care who it is
[1:34:08] that's why the importance of the Holy
[1:34:09] Ghost is so important in our lives that
[1:34:11] we're able to have an anointing upon us
[1:34:13] that recognizes when Satan moves in on
[1:34:16] the
[1:34:17] scene cuz if you don't recognize it
[1:34:20] you'll just keep falling for it you know
[1:34:23] that little Mouse when he's running
[1:34:24] through there and he he goes in there
[1:34:26] and he gets that he goes into that and
[1:34:28] that bucket that's got the cheese down
[1:34:29] in it or the Trap that's got the cheese
[1:34:30] in it he'll just keep doing that and
[1:34:33] he'll keep doing that until he
[1:34:35] recognizes one day he got
[1:34:39] me I don't want to be that
[1:34:43] guy I want to recognize before I get
[1:34:46] there say man this looks like a trap
[1:34:48] that Satan has set for me this looks
[1:34:50] like something I shouldn't get into and
[1:34:52] I better just back myself away from
[1:34:56] it so under the anointing of the Holy
[1:34:59] Ghost you're free from the bondage of
[1:35:02] sin you don't have to go back into Egypt
[1:35:05] you know I was in Egypt one
[1:35:07] time do any of you remember your life in
[1:35:11] Egypt that's the exact word I was
[1:35:14] looking for I was going to say was any
[1:35:16] of you
[1:35:17] miserable yeah why because there's
[1:35:20] nothing for the believer in Egypt you're
[1:35:23] under bondage you're under shackles of a
[1:35:25] of a Tormentor and a slave that all he
[1:35:27] wants to do is torment torment torment
[1:35:30] you that's
[1:35:32] right but under the anointing of the
[1:35:34] Holy Ghost you're set free from that
[1:35:36] bondage of sin it's like the prophet
[1:35:38] said he said that you are a conqueror
[1:35:41] and you have victory in the Holy
[1:35:44] Ghost and as a conqueror it means that
[1:35:47] you have beaten down you have overridden
[1:35:50] you have handcuffed handcuffed and
[1:35:52] thrown into prison
[1:35:57] you have thrown into prison that which
[1:36:00] used to overrule
[1:36:02] you you now rule it that's what a
[1:36:07] conqueror
[1:36:11] is he said you you've whipped it you've
[1:36:15] overcome it you are greater than it is
[1:36:23] ain't it just nice when you can walk and
[1:36:25] you can say that don't bother
[1:36:29] me and you know at one time you were so
[1:36:32] Shackled by that by that
[1:36:34] devil and you can look at this and and
[1:36:36] you
[1:36:37] say don't bother me devil go pick on
[1:36:40] somebody else I ain't biting I ain't
[1:36:43] buying what you selling
[1:36:49] devil remember these Israelites they had
[1:36:51] recently been freed from slavery in
[1:36:54] Egypt and God is now establishing a new
[1:36:57] community for him a new
[1:36:59] order and this priesthood is going
[1:37:01] through a crucial institution in in in
[1:37:04] into Israel here as a
[1:37:07] mediator God and his people they're
[1:37:09] offering sacrifices they're maintaining
[1:37:11] the Holiness but now let's jump over to
[1:37:13] the New Testament for just a few minutes
[1:37:15] St John chapter
[1:37:18] 1 I'm read it here verse
[1:37:21] 38 and Jesus turned and saw them them
[1:37:23] following and said unto them what seek
[1:37:25] ye and they said unto him Rabbi which is
[1:37:29] to say being interpreted
[1:37:31] Master aren't you thankful that you can
[1:37:33] recognize who Jesus is Master his people
[1:37:37] know who he
[1:37:39] is where dwellest thou and he sath unto
[1:37:42] them come and see and they came and saw
[1:37:45] where he dwelt and Abode with him that
[1:37:48] day for it was about the 10th hour one
[1:37:51] of the two which heard John speak and
[1:37:54] followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's
[1:37:57] brother he first findeth his own brother
[1:38:00] Simon and said unto him we have found
[1:38:03] the
[1:38:04] Messiah as being interpreted the
[1:38:08] Christ which we know as if if we were to
[1:38:11] add another line onto that put a comma
[1:38:13] there we would know through the message
[1:38:15] of the hour and we would know through uh
[1:38:18] historical Scholars that when it says
[1:38:19] the Christ it means the anointed one
[1:38:24] isn't it something how this anointing is
[1:38:26] flowing and following down through the
[1:38:28] Bible it started way back there in the
[1:38:31] first church that come out of Egypt it
[1:38:33] started way back there in the levitical
[1:38:35] priesthood where laws were that
[1:38:37] anointing was poured out and now that
[1:38:39] Jesus is on the scene he arrives as the
[1:38:42] anointed
[1:38:45] one so here we see the symbolism of this
[1:38:48] anointing oil carried forward into the
[1:38:50] New Testament and Jesus here so what
[1:38:53] does that tell telling us it's telling
[1:38:55] us that as Christians this concept of
[1:38:57] anointing with oil is empowerment this
[1:39:01] concept of anointing with oil is is
[1:39:04] gifting of the Holy Spirit it means that
[1:39:07] God is setting an order in his church
[1:39:09] his bride
[1:39:12] Church you see he had to set it into
[1:39:14] order in the levitical church and he had
[1:39:17] to set it in order in the last day
[1:39:20] Church ah for years years people thought
[1:39:24] the the gift of the Holy Ghost was no
[1:39:26] more than shouting dancing speaking in
[1:39:28] tongues
[1:39:29] interpretations and that all is a part
[1:39:31] of the Holy Ghost I love
[1:39:34] it I'm like I heard brother Tommy's
[1:39:36] prayer I'd like to see more of
[1:39:39] that but if it's not if it's not genuine
[1:39:42] if it's not anointed of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:44] we're going to stay away from
[1:39:46] it because we know now what we see in
[1:39:49] our hour and what the what the messenger
[1:39:51] brought in this hour is not just a not
[1:39:54] just an emotion not just a a feeling not
[1:39:56] just a song or an interpretation but
[1:39:59] it's a God moving in his people it's a
[1:40:02] god of action in The Bride of Jesus
[1:40:05] Christ a bride that takes the word and
[1:40:08] has dressed herself in the word and
[1:40:10] stands and acts on the
[1:40:17] word
[1:40:19] Jesus I want you to notice here Jesus
[1:40:21] the prophet said had a need to to go to
[1:40:25] Samaria he's headed down to
[1:40:29] Samaria I like the way the prophet tells
[1:40:32] this because he says as he heads down to
[1:40:34] Samaria he said he don't know exactly
[1:40:36] what's going to happen is that isn't
[1:40:37] that an amazing
[1:40:39] statement that he would say that Jesus
[1:40:42] Christ knows he's got to go to Samaria
[1:40:44] but he don't know exactly what's going
[1:40:45] to
[1:40:47] happen that's what he
[1:40:49] said but there's a woman there so he
[1:40:52] thought he'd carry on a conversation
[1:40:53] with her and so he said he went on and
[1:40:56] talking about her and talking about a
[1:40:57] drink and she went to talking about how
[1:40:59] they worship in the mountain or in this
[1:41:01] mountain and that mountain and so forth
[1:41:03] but directly watch the
[1:41:06] spirit the anointed one he said but
[1:41:09] directly he caught what her trouble
[1:41:15] was that's God In Action he caught what
[1:41:19] her trouble was and she he said sure she
[1:41:22] had five husband husbands he said go get
[1:41:24] your husband and come here so I want you
[1:41:27] to look now and think about this and
[1:41:29] let's paint this picture for a few
[1:41:30] minutes here is this woman who is an
[1:41:32] outcast of the
[1:41:36] city now remember now we're talking
[1:41:38] about Hall of Fame and we're talking
[1:41:42] about
[1:41:43] Champions and one of Jesus's first
[1:41:46] encounters is with a prostitute in a
[1:41:48] city that's drawing water by herself
[1:41:50] because she can't draw water with the
[1:41:51] rest of the women an
[1:41:59] outcast and
[1:42:03] Jesus under the anointing picks up her
[1:42:07] situation aren't you glad he picked up
[1:42:10] your
[1:42:11] situation he picks up her situation and
[1:42:13] says tell me about your
[1:42:15] husband and she says I have no
[1:42:18] husband and he says that's right you've
[1:42:21] said well because you've had and the one
[1:42:23] you're living with now is not your
[1:42:25] husband is that in that thou sayest the
[1:42:28] truth you talk about standing in an
[1:42:33] anointing when you stand in that kind of
[1:42:36] an
[1:42:37] anointing you can't
[1:42:40] lie you can try you can try to doubt you
[1:42:44] can try to make up excuses but when that
[1:42:46] kind of anointing when you're standing
[1:42:48] face to face with Jesus Christ and he's
[1:42:50] calling you out and he's pulling at your
[1:42:52] heart strings there is an anointing
[1:42:54] there that you can't hide
[1:42:56] from she stands in that anointing and
[1:42:59] the prophet says I got to nail this down
[1:43:01] I want you to look at the difference
[1:43:02] between that woman in the shape that she
[1:43:05] was in and those High cultured ministers
[1:43:09] we're talking about the difference
[1:43:10] between a champion and the
[1:43:12] church oo let that sink in we're talking
[1:43:17] about the difference between a champion
[1:43:19] and the church you see the church had
[1:43:21] their rituals the church had their
[1:43:25] rituals this woman said sir I perceive
[1:43:28] that you're a
[1:43:29] prophet so she came into the presence of
[1:43:33] an anointing like she had never
[1:43:35] experienced in her
[1:43:39] life she stands in that presence
[1:43:43] now knowing that the messiah's got to
[1:43:46] come knowing what the messiah's got to
[1:43:50] say knowing how they currently worship
[1:43:54] knowing the life that she's lived and is
[1:43:57] living she didn't come to him holy she
[1:44:01] didn't come to him all lifted up a Hall
[1:44:03] of Fame
[1:44:05] player you know sometimes we we think we
[1:44:07] got to get good we got to get right to
[1:44:09] come to church no come to church and you
[1:44:11] might get
[1:44:13] right but she came to church just like
[1:44:17] she
[1:44:18] was little did she know that she was
[1:44:20] going to stand in a presence like she
[1:44:22] had never felt and she stands there
[1:44:24] while the priest and the educated the
[1:44:27] cultured with their pride and their
[1:44:29] arrogancy
[1:44:31] and their righteous status they look at
[1:44:34] the same person the anointed one and
[1:44:37] says you are a devil be
[1:44:44] o are we Champions or are we a
[1:44:47] church I'm a
[1:44:49] champion she stands there and looks at
[1:44:52] and the woman says sir I perceive that
[1:44:54] you're a prophet because we know that
[1:44:56] when the Messiah come he's going to tell
[1:44:58] us these things he's going to share
[1:45:01] these things with us and and and and and
[1:45:03] this is the sign of the Messiah and the
[1:45:05] prophet said that same Messiah Messianic
[1:45:08] sign is the same yesterday today and
[1:45:11] forever it's got to be the same it don't
[1:45:13] change so when you come into the
[1:45:15] presence of God we ought to be able to
[1:45:17] recognize the spirit of God recognize
[1:45:19] the truth when the truth is spoken
[1:45:21] that's how you can believe that right
[1:45:23] there that's how you can believe that
[1:45:25] right there that's how you believe that
[1:45:26] right there and that's certainly how you
[1:45:28] believe that right
[1:45:30] there it's because something in you
[1:45:32] recognize an anointing that goes along
[1:45:34] with it that said hey something is
[1:45:36] calling
[1:45:44] me she said I know we know that when a
[1:45:47] messiah come he'll be called the Christ
[1:45:49] the anointed one he'll tell us these
[1:45:51] things but who are you and he said I am
[1:45:54] he that speaks with you and the prophet
[1:45:57] said that was it in an instant brother
[1:46:01] and sisters in an instant we look at
[1:46:02] things different she looked at things
[1:46:04] different when the light flashed upon
[1:46:06] her
[1:46:08] life she was no longer in the gutters
[1:46:11] living a life of sinful prostitution but
[1:46:14] immediately she ran she got up and she
[1:46:16] said you must be the prophet you must be
[1:46:19] the Messiah and she ran into the city to
[1:46:22] tell everybody come and see a
[1:46:25] man when that anointing got upon her she
[1:46:29] couldn't help but testify of what God
[1:46:31] would done in her
[1:46:34] life I really question the experience
[1:46:37] sometimes and I've had to question my
[1:46:38] own as a young
[1:46:41] Christian I thought I was a Christian I
[1:46:43] thought I was I thought I was doing what
[1:46:44] I was supposed to do but I was
[1:46:46] afraid I didn't have that attitude of
[1:46:49] run and tell everybody what he'd done
[1:46:50] for me I was like thank you God for what
[1:46:53] you've done for me but we just keep that
[1:46:56] private
[1:46:58] well I'm glad all y'all was run and
[1:47:01] shouted from the
[1:47:06] rooftops but when that light hits you
[1:47:10] can't help but do what the light wants
[1:47:12] you to
[1:47:13] do brothers and sisters when you come in
[1:47:15] contact with that anointing of the Holy
[1:47:17] Ghost your life will never be the same
[1:47:23] we've been talking about
[1:47:24] Joseph and the prophet said it was
[1:47:26] Christ and Joseph that made him portray
[1:47:29] Christ H he was sold for 30 pieces of
[1:47:33] silver loved by his father hated by his
[1:47:34] brethren in a prison house Christ was on
[1:47:37] the cross once one was saved the butcher
[1:47:40] one was sa lost the butler one saved one
[1:47:42] lost the same thing set at the right
[1:47:44] hand of
[1:47:46] pharaoh it was Christ and Joseph that
[1:47:49] made Joseph like Christ now how many of
[1:47:52] you you want to be like Christ now do
[1:47:54] you have Christ in your
[1:47:58] life you see how that
[1:48:02] works today we're talking about God's
[1:48:05] Hall of
[1:48:07] Fame these verses and these themes
[1:48:09] talked about sanctification empowerment
[1:48:11] Purity and all these implic implications
[1:48:14] that we talk about here it serves as a
[1:48:17] reminder of the Consecration and
[1:48:19] dedication we got to have
[1:48:23] I asked myself many times am I dedicated
[1:48:25] to Christ the way I should
[1:48:28] be am I fully
[1:48:31] consecrated I laid in the bed this
[1:48:33] morning from 1:30 to 5:30 couldn't sleep
[1:48:36] thinking about this couldn't study
[1:48:38] couldn't sleep just laid there and I
[1:48:40] thought I told the Lord I said I'm being
[1:48:42] honest with you now church I'm being
[1:48:43] honest I laid there for a while and I
[1:48:46] said
[1:48:46] Lord I don't think I've done everything
[1:48:49] I should do I don't think I have fully
[1:48:52] prepared
[1:48:53] the way I should have been prepared or
[1:48:56] preparing Lord forgive
[1:48:59] me because I need to give more of me to
[1:49:03] you for you to use more of
[1:49:08] me and I've been thinking about this
[1:49:10] message for over a
[1:49:13] week but I didn't feel like it was
[1:49:16] adequate I didn't feel like ID put in
[1:49:18] all that I should
[1:49:20] have this Holy Ghost begin to prick in
[1:49:23] my
[1:49:30] heart and as I've made that
[1:49:33] confession I can't explain it to you I
[1:49:35] hope you experience the same thing but
[1:49:38] there's times when I pray and I
[1:49:40] pray and there's times when I pray and I
[1:49:44] feel his
[1:49:47] presence and and you know that when
[1:49:49] you're speaking he hears every word
[1:49:53] and you feel such a warm tender
[1:49:58] presence and I laid there this morning
[1:50:00] as I made that
[1:50:03] confession and it was almost like
[1:50:05] something
[1:50:07] said get
[1:50:10] up it's
[1:50:13] okay sometimes we just need to be told
[1:50:15] it's
[1:50:16] okay and the presence was
[1:50:20] a was a was an anointing like I've never
[1:50:23] I won't say I've never but one like I've
[1:50:25] rarely feel at that height of a presence
[1:50:29] and I just lay there and I begin to just
[1:50:31] kind of tear and cry at I don't know
[1:50:33] what time it was 1 2 3:00 I don't know
[1:50:35] what time it was but I begin to just
[1:50:37] feel that presence and I said Lord thank
[1:50:40] you thank you that you don't just throw
[1:50:42] me out because I fail thank you that you
[1:50:46] don't just cast me aside because I fell
[1:50:48] short thank you that that that you
[1:50:51] you're still going to meet me when I
[1:50:52] walk out to the platform because it's
[1:50:54] not about me to begin
[1:50:57] with it's about the
[1:50:59] people my gift is for
[1:51:06] people and I began to pray and that
[1:51:09] warmth come over and I said Lord I'm
[1:51:12] going to live more consecrated more
[1:51:14] dedicated I'm going to serve you Lord
[1:51:16] more than I've ever served you I don't
[1:51:19] want to waver I don't want to be
[1:51:21] slothful
[1:51:23] I don't I don't want to I don't want to
[1:51:24] be the person that that just comes in
[1:51:26] and gets into the routine of coming and
[1:51:28] going and and just in a routine of doing
[1:51:30] what we do because that's what we
[1:51:34] do I want to be under the
[1:51:38] control you know you hear the prophet
[1:51:40] talk about the he's talking about
[1:51:42] somebody praying for somebody and he
[1:51:44] said I'm praying for this person and
[1:51:46] this person's uh joining me and we're
[1:51:48] praying and he said we're just conducts
[1:51:50] we're conduits we're just running
[1:51:52] through the
[1:51:53] conduit that's what I want to be just a
[1:51:55] holy ghost conduit that whatever God
[1:51:58] wants in my life that that's what I can
[1:51:59] pour back out into the
[1:52:02] people because brothers and sisters
[1:52:04] without Christ in our lives we
[1:52:08] fail we fail the prophet said numerous
[1:52:11] times over and over put it in type it
[1:52:13] into your computer fail and
[1:52:17] failure and see how many times he said
[1:52:20] without you
[1:52:24] I'm a
[1:52:25] failure this prayer line if you don't
[1:52:29] come it's a failure that's
[1:52:32] right without you in my life God I
[1:52:37] fail and he says it over and over and
[1:52:40] over and it made me realize that no
[1:52:42] matter how hard I fall God just wants me
[1:52:45] to get back up God just wants you to get
[1:52:47] back up you're going to make mistakes
[1:52:50] [Applause]
[1:52:55] that's exactly right Joseph was a
[1:52:58] deliverer now I've read this quote for
[1:53:00] the last three services and every time I
[1:53:02] read it I find something else so we're
[1:53:05] going to read it again is that all
[1:53:07] right job's on that Ash Heap but Prophet
[1:53:10] said for I don't know how long we're
[1:53:12] going to get Joseph out of this
[1:53:13] prison Joseph was a deliverer he saved
[1:53:16] his people from famine what did God have
[1:53:19] to do to him he said he put him in
[1:53:21] prison he put him right straight in the
[1:53:22] prison yes sir sold by his Brethren to
[1:53:25] an Egyptian they sowed him to Piper
[1:53:28] Piper gave him a little bit of Liberty
[1:53:30] and the first thing you know it was
[1:53:31] taken from him and there he said in
[1:53:33] prison crying and crying because God had
[1:53:35] stripped
[1:53:39] it but now notice he says all the time I
[1:53:42] believe he's in that prison remembering
[1:53:44] that the vision said he was going to sit
[1:53:46] on a
[1:53:48] throne so something called me
[1:53:53] at about 16 years old and said you're
[1:53:57] different you're different than the rest
[1:53:59] that you're hanging out
[1:54:00] with you're different than those people
[1:54:03] that that you're running around with
[1:54:04] you're
[1:54:18] different there was a vision that took
[1:54:21] place
[1:54:22] something called out to you there was a
[1:54:25] vision that took place in Joseph's life
[1:54:26] there was a vision that took place in
[1:54:28] your life something called out to you
[1:54:29] and said you're
[1:54:32] different serpent seed marriage and
[1:54:38] divorce the
[1:54:40] seals Church
[1:54:44] ages is that
[1:54:49] different did it call out to you
[1:54:51] different
[1:54:53] now let me ask you when you believe
[1:54:55] those things when you believed in Christ
[1:54:58] when you believed in the message when
[1:55:00] you believed in these things did you
[1:55:01] ever have any mistakes from then
[1:55:06] on yeah you see the mistakes don't
[1:55:10] determine the
[1:55:13] vision the
[1:55:15] blood the blood is what determines the
[1:55:19] vision the blood on Calvary is what
[1:55:21] determines the the vision now listen
[1:55:23] what he says he said all the time he
[1:55:24] knew he was going to sit on the throne
[1:55:26] but he because he knew that his gift
[1:55:27] come from God and he knew that it had to
[1:55:29] come to pass and so if we could keep
[1:55:32] that in our minds and according to the
[1:55:34] word that in these last days that God is
[1:55:37] going to have a church he is going to
[1:55:39] have a bride he's going to have a people
[1:55:41] a word bride without spot or
[1:55:45] wrinkle how's she going to do that she's
[1:55:47] going to be clothed with the word
[1:55:49] anointed with the holy ghost moving in
[1:55:51] the presence of
[1:55:54] God how do you know these things I know
[1:55:57] him because he promised
[1:55:58] it why would I
[1:56:01] doubt why should we doubt why should we
[1:56:03] worry why should we
[1:56:07] fear he said he would do it we're living
[1:56:09] in that time we're here 2025 we're
[1:56:11] living in a Time think about this we're
[1:56:13] living in a time that is the most evil
[1:56:15] time that the world has ever seen but
[1:56:18] for the
[1:56:19] believer It's the Most Blessed time
[1:56:23] that the world has ever seen you're
[1:56:25] living in a time when you're seeing God
[1:56:28] move on the scene in ways that we've
[1:56:30] never seen before I am just astonished
[1:56:33] I'm excited to be living in this very
[1:56:35] hour we're living
[1:56:37] in when we can hear the Miracles that's
[1:56:39] taking place we can see God in ACS and
[1:56:41] you say I don't know what you're talking
[1:56:42] about Ron Spencer had a death sentence
[1:56:44] five years
[1:56:47] ago he's still
[1:56:49] alive not only is he alive he's still
[1:56:52] preaching as hard as he can
[1:56:54] go a death sentence 5 years
[1:57:00] ago we've seen people here that's been
[1:57:03] healed we've seen people that are being
[1:57:11] healed this ain't in my notes but it's
[1:57:13] just it's just
[1:57:15] inspiration you know they told sister
[1:57:16] Donna your limp nodes are full is that
[1:57:19] right she goes back gay take four out
[1:57:22] and they say we can't find
[1:57:27] nothing don't tell me my God is not a
[1:57:30] god of
[1:57:33] action they tell they tell our pastors
[1:57:36] said I don't know he showed them
[1:57:37] pictures and scans and pictures of of
[1:57:39] wounds and so forth and they look at him
[1:57:40] and said I don't know what you're doing
[1:57:42] but you better keep doing it and she
[1:57:44] said keep
[1:57:46] praying why because you're calling God
[1:57:49] on the
[1:57:50] scene it's it's not just the mighty Army
[1:57:53] it's the war it's the it's the general
[1:57:55] behind the
[1:58:01] Army he's going to have a
[1:58:04] people so quit listening if you're one
[1:58:06] of his people quit listening to the
[1:58:08] devil this
[1:58:09] morning because he's only telling you
[1:58:11] half the
[1:58:13] story you ever notice that's the way he
[1:58:15] works he talked to Eve told her a lot of
[1:58:19] the story but just not all of it
[1:58:23] just enough but not all of it but I want
[1:58:26] you to look at what Matthew 19:26 says
[1:58:28] Jesus says with man this is
[1:58:32] impossible now how many times has a
[1:58:34] devil quoted that to
[1:58:36] you what you're trying to do is
[1:58:38] impossible what you're trying to
[1:58:40] accomplish is impossible you think God
[1:58:43] can do that in your life it's impossible
[1:58:44] because you're a man he left out the
[1:58:47] other
[1:58:48] part he's a little bit stupider than he
[1:58:51] than we than give him credit for we say
[1:58:54] he knows the Bible yeah he does but he
[1:58:55] don't know how to use it we know how to
[1:58:58] use it we've been given a gift to use
[1:59:01] the word the word says with man it's
[1:59:04] impossible but With
[1:59:06] God all things are
[1:59:14] possible the prophet I'm going to finish
[1:59:16] this quote and we're not going back to
[1:59:17] it the prophet said that Joseph was
[1:59:20] sitting there thinking and be became a
[1:59:22] total
[1:59:24] failure I never picked that up till I
[1:59:27] studied this Joseph sitting there
[1:59:29] thinking he'd become a total failure to
[1:59:33] himself he knew that all that he
[1:59:35] understood and everything but he became
[1:59:37] a total
[1:59:39] failure to where when people would look
[1:59:41] at him they would turn their head they
[1:59:42] wouldn't pay him no attention because he
[1:59:45] became a
[1:59:48] prisoner isn't that the way it is when
[1:59:50] when you make a mistake you could be
[1:59:52] going along good in life and man church
[1:59:54] is going good and man you filled with
[1:59:56] the Holy Ghost and you you fall flat on
[1:59:58] your face next thing you know you
[2:00:02] Outcast oh look at him he never was a
[2:00:04] Christian to begin with that's right he
[2:00:06] done fail he he he didn't even fall
[2:00:08] because he never had it that's what they
[2:00:11] say come on
[2:00:14] church but listen what listen what the
[2:00:16] prophet said God said when Joseph was in
[2:00:18] the prison after he fell and he made
[2:00:20] himself a a place in the prison and he
[2:00:22] thought of himself as a total failure
[2:00:25] God said here's my
[2:00:29] man come on church when you're laying
[2:00:32] there and you think you've made become a
[2:00:34] total failure God looks at you and says
[2:00:36] there's my man there's my woman there's
[2:00:39] my young person there's my young lady
[2:00:42] that's the way God sees you the world
[2:00:45] sees you as a failure the devil accuses
[2:00:47] you of being a failure but God says
[2:00:49] that's my man that's my conqueror that's
[2:00:52] my
[2:00:59] Victor Hebrews 12
[2:01:02] And1 I'm going to have to tell that time
[2:01:05] to stand
[2:01:07] still Hebrews 12
[2:01:09] And1 says therefore we are surrounded by
[2:01:12] such a great cloud of witnesses let us
[2:01:13] throw off everything that hinders us and
[2:01:15] the sin that so easily
[2:01:18] entangles Oh you mean we're in a
[2:01:21] wrestling match
[2:01:25] oh Paul knew what he was talking about
[2:01:27] we're in a wrestling match and let us
[2:01:28] run with perseverance the race that's
[2:01:30] marked out before us so now we're racing
[2:01:32] we're trying to we're trying to beat
[2:01:34] somebody we're trying to get to the
[2:01:36] Finish think about this fixing our eyes
[2:01:39] on Jesus now there's the
[2:01:42] key fixing our eyes on Jesus the the
[2:01:46] perfector of
[2:01:49] Faith as we look at this and we think
[2:01:51] about the
[2:01:53] the author here comparing the Christian
[2:01:55] Life to a race a race of endurance Paul
[2:01:57] he knew what he was talking about you
[2:01:59] got to think about the time that he
[2:02:01] wrote this the time what was going on
[2:02:02] the Romans were known for their
[2:02:04] games right we got the Olympics today
[2:02:07] because they were fond of their games
[2:02:09] the competition to see who could win who
[2:02:11] was the elite who could win in wrestling
[2:02:13] who could win in in all these things and
[2:02:15] so we have the Olympics so if you was an
[2:02:17] Olympic runner you know what you did
[2:02:19] your entire life
[2:02:22] you
[2:02:23] ran if you were an Archer you spent the
[2:02:27] better part of your life trying to get
[2:02:28] better with a bow and
[2:02:32] arrow if you're a wrestler you would eat
[2:02:34] right you would dieet right you would
[2:02:36] get stronger You' practice and you want
[2:02:37] to be the best wrestler that you could
[2:02:40] be so now watch this a watch these
[2:02:42] athletes these
[2:02:43] Champions they get rid of everything and
[2:02:46] anything that prevents them from
[2:02:48] reaching their
[2:02:49] goals now how many of us could say we
[2:02:52] got some things we need to get rid of to
[2:02:54] reach our
[2:02:56] goals come on
[2:02:59] hands defy gravity show God that you
[2:03:01] mean
[2:03:04] business they get rid of things in their
[2:03:06] life that they don't need things that's
[2:03:08] going to slow them down in the race they
[2:03:09] get rid of things that's going to hold
[2:03:11] them back from shooting straight they
[2:03:12] get rid of things that's going to keep
[2:03:14] them from winning the grappling in the
[2:03:16] wrestling
[2:03:17] match they get rid of these things they
[2:03:19] ain't eating biscuits
[2:03:23] they're training they got a goal they
[2:03:25] got a purpose and they're training this
[2:03:27] is the kind of focus that this Hebrew
[2:03:29] author they were talking about it was
[2:03:32] determination that no matter what comes
[2:03:34] my way I'm
[2:03:35] determined now we have what's called a
[2:03:37] Hall of Fame and about just about every
[2:03:39] sport men and women and they stand a
[2:03:42] little taller they shine a little
[2:03:44] brighter they move a little faster a
[2:03:48] little quicker on their feet
[2:03:53] basketball Michael Jordan don't argue
[2:03:56] with me I'm not going to argue with you
[2:03:58] it's Michael
[2:04:03] Jordan football Johnny Unitas running
[2:04:06] Carl Lewis Usain Bolt Jackie joner ciry
[2:04:10] you can name them the Hall of Famers
[2:04:11] Babe Ruth baseball Carl Yus krimsky
[2:04:14] baseball you I could go through hundreds
[2:04:16] of them and I could begin to list these
[2:04:18] Hall of Fame athletes but what is it
[2:04:20] that makes them different
[2:04:23] they
[2:04:25] grind they don't settle for just getting
[2:04:29] by they're committed to what they do you
[2:04:31] say man I wish I could be like Kobe
[2:04:33] Bryant no you don't because you're not
[2:04:35] willing to do what Kobe Bryant did to
[2:04:36] get there do you know Kobe Bryant was up
[2:04:39] at 4:30 every day of his life since high
[2:04:42] school in a gym shooting free throws and
[2:04:45] shooting jump shots before the rest of
[2:04:47] the world was
[2:04:50] awake oo
[2:04:54] Muhammad Ali said he' get up and run
[2:04:56] every morning at 5:00 and have a morning
[2:04:59] jog because he thought that he could get
[2:05:01] a little bit of edge over the
[2:05:03] competition that was still
[2:05:08] sleeping that's
[2:05:10] right these guys were
[2:05:13] Grinders are we grinding to get to where
[2:05:16] we want to
[2:05:17] be uh that's why I said we don't want to
[2:05:19] be slothful
[2:05:21] but we want to be diligent when we take
[2:05:23] the word and we reading the word we want
[2:05:24] to dig into the word and really get into
[2:05:26] the word I said I read that quote three
[2:05:28] times and I found three different things
[2:05:31] out of just one paragraph to preach on
[2:05:33] how much more is in that one
[2:05:35] paragraph but it takes grinding it takes
[2:05:38] getting in
[2:05:40] there I want you to look let's look at
[2:05:42] Michael Jordan for just a minute we'll
[2:05:43] get off the Bible for a minute I I like
[2:05:45] Michael
[2:05:47] Jordan Michael Jordan said I have missed
[2:05:49] more than 9,000 shots in my care
[2:05:53] career he said I have lost almost 300
[2:05:57] games 26 times I've been trusted to take
[2:06:00] the game winning shot and missed now
[2:06:03] does that sound like a
[2:06:07] champion he said I have failed over and
[2:06:09] over and over again in my
[2:06:11] life and that is why I
[2:06:16] succeed you mean as a
[2:06:18] Christian you're going to fail
[2:06:21] over and
[2:06:23] over and over God may ask you to do
[2:06:28] something 9,000
[2:06:31] times he may give you 9,000 shots to do
[2:06:34] something
[2:06:35] right and you miss the
[2:06:40] Mark Jordan said I can accept failure
[2:06:43] everyone fails at something but I can't
[2:06:45] accept not
[2:06:49] trying if you going to get anywhere with
[2:06:50] God you got to try
[2:06:53] it you know people they want to talk
[2:06:56] about success and it don't matter what
[2:06:57] it is any any part of life success
[2:06:59] whether it's business a home or whatever
[2:07:02] it don't just fall into your
[2:07:04] lap it's a lot of trial and error it's a
[2:07:07] lot of of getting back up when you get
[2:07:09] knocked
[2:07:10] down it's a it's a lot of of finding out
[2:07:12] that that that you can't be afraid to
[2:07:14] fail that's what Jordan says don't be
[2:07:16] afraid to fail be afraid not to
[2:07:19] try as Christians we have to be willing
[2:07:21] to do what God wants us to
[2:07:23] do he says it doesn't matter if you fall
[2:07:26] down it's whether you get back up
[2:07:28] Michael Jordan is a pretty good
[2:07:31] preacher that's
[2:07:33] right his life don't line
[2:07:36] up but he got some good
[2:07:39] quotes the key to success is
[2:07:42] failure
[2:07:47] oh if you never sharpen the pencil
[2:07:51] you'll never make a mistake that's
[2:07:54] right if you ain't making mistakes you
[2:07:57] ain't
[2:08:02] working listen to what he says here I
[2:08:04] know that fear is an obstacle for some
[2:08:07] people but it's an illusion to me huh
[2:08:11] failure always made me try harder next
[2:08:15] time Babe Ruth was known for home runs
[2:08:19] right 714
[2:08:21] career home
[2:08:23] runs
[2:08:25] 1,330
[2:08:29] strikeouts you know what his quote his
[2:08:31] most famous quote is never let the fear
[2:08:34] of striking out keep you from playing
[2:08:35] the
[2:08:37] game I might fail God today tomorrow
[2:08:41] next week but I'm still playing this
[2:08:44] game and it's the game of life and I got
[2:08:46] to have that holy ghost in my life it's
[2:08:49] that Holy Ghost that keeps me playing in
[2:08:50] the game we look at King David we think
[2:08:52] about David no question one of the
[2:08:54] Bible's most important
[2:08:56] figures faces a giant called Goliath he
[2:09:00] has a great friendship with Jonathan he
[2:09:03] worships and writes Psalm after song
[2:09:05] after song and he he endures the
[2:09:08] wickedness of King
[2:09:10] Saul one of our most beloved characters
[2:09:13] in The Bible and who would ever thought
[2:09:15] he'd been guilty of breaking half of
[2:09:17] God's
[2:09:20] Commandments this is a Hall of Fame
[2:09:22] champion of
[2:09:25] God coveted your rise wife committed
[2:09:29] adultery with her stole her from her
[2:09:31] husband lied to him and murdered him
[2:09:35] that's that's five
[2:09:42] right what about
[2:09:45] Elijah think about
[2:09:47] Elijah he had experiences of Miracles
[2:09:50] over and over over and
[2:09:52] over you'd think he'd have unshakable
[2:09:55] faith wouldn't you you would think after
[2:09:57] all he'd SE after all he'd see he caused
[2:09:59] the rain to stop for more than three
[2:10:03] years think about this he's fed by
[2:10:06] Ravens he sees a limitless jar of flour
[2:10:09] and a jug of oil just keep building up
[2:10:11] building up you can't you can't use it
[2:10:13] up and he's witnessing this and he and
[2:10:17] he sees the the Widow's son Resurrected
[2:10:21] he beats the prophets of baale by
[2:10:23] calling down fire from
[2:10:26] heaven but when The Showdown comes
[2:10:28] between baal's worshippers and an
[2:10:30] angered King Ahab and Jezebel Elijah
[2:10:33] couldn't take it he High tailed Into the
[2:10:37] Wilderness does that sound like a
[2:10:39] champion that sound like something I
[2:10:41] might
[2:10:44] do you see God God uses us over and over
[2:10:50] and then we make mistakes and we fall
[2:10:52] and then God picks us up and he uses us
[2:10:55] and he uses and we make mistakes and we
[2:10:58] fall John Mark you read about it in the
[2:11:01] Bible Paul and Barnabas they picked John
[2:11:03] Mark up to go on a mission trip to
[2:11:05] Jerusalem now how honored would you be
[2:11:08] as a young young man you're fixing ago
[2:11:11] on a missionary trip with with Paul and
[2:11:14] Barnabas you fixing to go you fixing to
[2:11:17] go see some
[2:11:18] stuff and the Bible tells us that they
[2:11:21] get going there and they get down going
[2:11:22] down through there and they're doing all
[2:11:23] these things and you can just read
[2:11:24] through the Bible there and read through
[2:11:26] in the acts it's about acts
[2:11:28] 13 and John Mark decides I've had enough
[2:11:30] of this and he just deserts
[2:11:34] them he leaves
[2:11:37] them don't nobody really know why he
[2:11:39] just enough's enough I'm out of here and
[2:11:41] years
[2:11:43] later after being abandoned Paul is
[2:11:46] sitting in a prison awaiting trial he
[2:11:48] writes a letter to the Church of the
[2:11:49] Colossians and he he tells them about
[2:11:52] John markk he said he's with me and he's
[2:11:55] been a great comfort to
[2:11:58] me but before that happens Paul and
[2:12:02] Barnabas get upset at each
[2:12:04] other and they're in a conflict because
[2:12:07] I think it's Barnabas wants to go he
[2:12:10] wants to go back and try to find him and
[2:12:12] Paul says no I'm not going after him and
[2:12:14] so they get into a squabble back and
[2:12:16] forth back and forth and division takes
[2:12:18] place in the church
[2:12:22] this is a
[2:12:24] hero because Paul then later writes he
[2:12:27] says he's right here with me he's a
[2:12:28] comfort to me he's been my greatest
[2:12:30] comforter while I'm in this prison if
[2:12:33] you see him welcome him into your
[2:12:35] presence he's a
[2:12:39] brother that's a
[2:12:43] champion Peter denies
[2:12:47] Christ can you imagine Peter think about
[2:12:49] Peter
[2:12:51] this is guy walks on water
[2:12:53] right he's a little bit boisterous he's
[2:12:55] a little bit loud he's he's kind of like
[2:12:57] the center of attention he's one of
[2:12:58] Jesus's right hand he's right there with
[2:13:01] him and he's the one who walks on water
[2:13:04] and he's walking walking on water to
[2:13:07] Jesus and his faith begins to waver and
[2:13:10] in his walk he starts going down down
[2:13:13] down and as he's going down down down
[2:13:15] Jesus does
[2:13:17] what come
[2:13:19] on come on
[2:13:24] am you see sometimes your faith goes
[2:13:27] up and sometimes your faith goes
[2:13:30] down but Jesus is always right there to
[2:13:32] say come on come on and here's Peter
[2:13:37] Peter sitting here now and he's he's
[2:13:38] looking at this and he and Jesus tells
[2:13:40] him you're going to deny
[2:13:42] me Peter listen now you're going to deny
[2:13:45] me and Peter says no
[2:13:47] way I will never deny you
[2:13:51] he says listen before the crows in
[2:13:53] the morning you'll deny me three
[2:13:56] times no
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:03] way do you know that man called Jesus
[2:14:07] never seen him I thought I saw you
[2:14:09] walking with him in the market wasn't me
[2:14:13] I thought you was with all those other
[2:14:14] guys that call themselves The
[2:14:16] Disciples it must have been some other
[2:14:18] guy with a beard like mine
[2:14:23] [Music]
[2:14:26] but that's the guy that Jesus says I
[2:14:28] will you're my
[2:14:34] rock so you see it throughout the Bible
[2:14:36] we see God using imperfect
[2:14:39] people and a lot of times we think we
[2:14:41] have to be perfect or God can't use us
[2:14:43] we think we have to be a preacher or God
[2:14:45] can't use us we think we have to be a
[2:14:47] deacon or God can't use us just be a
[2:14:50] believer
[2:14:51] and see how God can use you just find
[2:14:54] yourself under the anointing of the Holy
[2:14:55] Ghost and see if you're not one of those
[2:14:57] people that God can use he took a team
[2:15:00] of
[2:15:02] Misfits think about that he took a team
[2:15:04] of Misfits it wasn't the popular it
[2:15:08] wasn't the rich it wasn't the successful
[2:15:10] people it was the poor it was the needy
[2:15:14] it was the
[2:15:15] broken but they were faithful
[2:15:21] and he took those people and turned them
[2:15:23] into champions of God so when you make a
[2:15:26] mistake in your life don't don't let it
[2:15:28] just sit just don't don't lay there and
[2:15:30] just lay there and lay there get
[2:15:32] yourself back up and find your way back
[2:15:34] on your feet and put one foot in front
[2:15:36] of the other after the other after the
[2:15:38] other and say no matter what I do no
[2:15:40] matter how I fall I will serve God I
[2:15:43] will trust in
[2:15:44] God if I don't make it I'm going to go
[2:15:47] down trying
[2:15:51] God has a lot of broken people he deals
[2:15:54] in broken
[2:15:56] people and all we do is see the heroic
[2:15:59] side of them you don't think about
[2:16:01] Michael Jordan missing 3,000 shots 26
[2:16:05] game winning shots you remember the one
[2:16:07] time that he jumps in a playoff when
[2:16:10] they throw him the ball he hits it at
[2:16:12] the last second and he jumps about this
[2:16:14] high off the ground I'm not even going
[2:16:15] to try I'm not brother Bor I can't get
[2:16:17] up
[2:16:18] here he jumps about this high off the
[2:16:20] ground hung out pumping his
[2:16:23] arms every one of you know the picture
[2:16:25] don't you I know I'm bald but I don't
[2:16:27] look like
[2:16:30] him that's what we remember we remember
[2:16:33] Abraham but when you think about Abraham
[2:16:35] he was just an old
[2:16:37] man yeah when you think about Elijah you
[2:16:40] think about all those Miracles he was
[2:16:42] suicidal depressed
[2:16:46] stressed you think about job he went
[2:16:50] bankrupt
[2:16:52] did you ever think about that lost
[2:16:53] everything he had serving
[2:16:56] God Moses had a speech problem Gideon
[2:17:00] full of
[2:17:01] fear Samson
[2:17:06] womanizer
[2:17:08] Rahab prostitute Samaritan woman
[2:17:12] divorced and prostitute Noah drunk
[2:17:14] Jeremiah he was just too young Jacob was
[2:17:17] a cheater David a murderer Jonah ran
[2:17:20] from God Naomi was a widow Peter denied
[2:17:23] Christ three times Martha worried about
[2:17:26] everything think about Martha in the
[2:17:28] Bible she was a
[2:17:29] warrior
[2:17:31] disciples they fell
[2:17:33] asleep in Jesus's most desperate hour
[2:17:38] his best friends fall asleep on
[2:17:44] him and the Bible tells us that we know
[2:17:46] that all things in God works to the good
[2:17:49] for those who love him
[2:17:52] and all of these things they had a
[2:17:55] purpose so I want you to know this
[2:17:57] morning that you're
[2:18:00] worthy we as Believers were worthy I'm
[2:18:02] coming to a
