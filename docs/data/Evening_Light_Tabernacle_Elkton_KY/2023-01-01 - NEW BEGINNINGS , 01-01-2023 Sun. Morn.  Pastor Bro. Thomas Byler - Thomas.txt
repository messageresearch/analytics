thank you [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] if you want to offer Ed all the places I know foreign when a man's ways please the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him a man's heart devises his way but the Lord directeth his steps just wait and balance are the Lord's all the weights of the bag are his work righteous lips are the Delight of kings and they love him that speaketh right in the light of the king's countenance is life and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain the highway of the upright is to depart from Evil he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than than to divide the spoil with the proud the wise in heart Shall be Called prudent and the sweetness of the lips increases learning the heart of the wise teacheth his mouth and added learning to his lips so far there is a way that sameth right into a man but the end thereof are the ways of death and ungodly man dicketh of evil in his lips there are there is as a burning fire a violent man enticeth his neighbor and leadeth him into the way that is not good the hoary head is the Crown of Glory if it be found in the way of righteousness the law is cast into the lab but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord whoever's foreign brothers and sisters I hope you're enjoying your first day of the new year you know that song we just read there's I'm not some why did I say some that proverb that I guess I'm getting old that probably we just read I mean there's so many different truths that you could spend hours starting and it's unbelievable but I was just thinking you know today today's the first of January in the year of 2023 and I was just thinking it's it's a marvelous thing for the believer but it's also a terrible thing for the unbeliever and I and that's Psalm we were eating kind of talks about that point you know and I was just thinking you know a king without righteousness is an evil thing a government without righteousness is an evil thing and I was just thinking this morning and that's where we're at this morning all the governments of the world are corrupted they're corrupted by their own desires for evil and political slash monetary gain everything's corrupted so what uh hope do you have this morning what should you be worried the only thing you really should be worried not even worried all you should be doing is forcing you to push you further into Jesus Christ if anything that's going on in the world it should be doing the opposite of what it's doing to the world and be bringing you closer to our relationship this morning with Jesus Christ without drawing you away from it but it actually should be leading you toward but before I get started this morning I was uh I as we start the new year uh we hadn't had Church in a couple of services so we go into the new year the loan amount that the principal amount on the loan is nineteen thousand dollars 600 and a little bit of change uh because we're so far ahead in the in the church loan I don't get the I still have to make an interest payment but they don't send me envelopes anymore because we're so far ahead for the year so that's where we're at in the uh building fund we have twenty three hundred dollars as we go into the new year and in the general fund after the deposit before Christmas we have ten thousand dollars and a little bit of change in it so God has blessed us um and you all know the issue we had this week uh we haven't I haven't made any claims yet until we resolve all the issues um it's changing going right back to where I was was that before you know I was listening to some messages this morning and it's really important for the year that we live in there are two well as we go into the year 2023 brother Brown was in these messages as I'm playing on my old talking about and the messages that deal with investment and the one thing I heard this morning that really struck me is that God's only he's concerned about it don't get me wrong with what I'm about to say but he's actually looking at a god-inspired God set up church and a god-led church that's what God's desire is to have the inspiration of the Holy Ghost in the Church of the hour that we live in and that will bring about God's construction Force it'll also keep you set on the path for the year that's coming ahead that we're going to have to go through you know you know I was just I was thinking there you know where actually I was just thinking in the year two in the 2020s all the upheaval that's going on in the world that we live in is no different than the 1920s now was any for someone to be alive to know what was going on in the 1920s he'd almost have to be 120 years plus to be a young man or a young woman going through that period but all the problems are is no different today in our own country the country is about to go into an economic clap collapse if they don't change their ways all the crazy stuff that was going on in the 1920s is going on in the 2000 and 2020s so it's but for the believer there shouldn't be any hesitation any fear as you look at the calendars as the years keep going by it's your Brent like I said uh repetitive but it should keep bringing you back to the truth of the word of the hour if you would turn with me um I was about to say something I say it a lot so I I stopped from saying if you told me to Luke this morning the 17th and the 18th chapter of Luke and I'll just read a few of these scriptures this morning also uh wrote this other stuff down over here but but I was I was thinking of this uh Parable um the truth if you'll turn with me to Luke the 17th chapter starting about the fifth verse there you know there's a lot if you I have a Thompson Chain or reference Bible but if you open a Thompson Chain reference between the 17th into the 18th chapter there's a lot of things that go on in the life of Jesus Christ and his disciples but I'll start at this fifth verse here and the apostles said unto the Lord increase our faith and I I'm raising my hand this morning I'm sure everyone else is the same way as we go into a new year Lord just increase my faith that I'm not looking at the circumstances but I'm looking at the promises and it goes and it goes on to say here increase our faith and the Lord said if you had Faith as a grain of a mustard seed you might say unto this forgive my pronunciation sock Mind Tree be plucked up and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you and that's where everyone else is this morning if you have that faith God can bring about the change of your circumstances this morning but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he has come from the field go and sit down to meet will not rather say unto him make ready where we're I may stop and gird myself and serve me I have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shall eat and drink and and he goes on death he does he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded of him I trial not basically I believe not so likewise ye when you shall have done all the things which you were commanded you say we are unprofitable serpents and we have done that which was our duty to do and that's where we're at this morning no matter what's going on all you can me is the servant that God wants you to be this morning and keep plugging along in the year that's ahead I wrote these things down these I've really I guess I wrote them to myself these uh five questions I guess we have to ask ours ourselves every day and every year to us is God real to you is God real life in your walk in every that way you rub up against the people in the world your own families is God real to you this morning and I can't answer that for you I can only answer it for myself and then the other question I would ask myself and sometimes this is that this is when Satan comes to you does God really care about me does he care does God care about my situations that are going on with me and my life you can answer that question I can answer I believe that God cares and I know he cares but like I said that's a question that your enemy is going to ask you every day of your life do you think God Bears about you next one is God in the heart of his people or I would say to myself as God in my heart is he continually leading me in the truth of his word and the hour that we live in this morning the other thing is most important one here the fourth one I have is God real in his church you that's really important God has to be real in his church the power of the Holy Ghost has to be inspiring every individual here this morning it's just not a duty that we're going but we're doing it out of love for Jesus Christ and the other question I wrote to myself and I'm going to go back to this chapter and read it because God raised the standard to meet the new year or to meet what your circumstances are and you can answer that question I can't answer it for you but I was going to jump back here and read that some of you will probably know where I'm going if I haven't if I haven't lost my place here which I have a habit of doing but it's in the 59th chapter of Isaiah and it's start I'll start at a about the 16 th verse here in the 59th of Isaiah in a hurry don't give you time to catch up I'm going to start at the 15th first year yeah true faileth and he that departed from Evil maketh himself a prey and the Lord sought and it displeased him that there was no judgment I can just think of our current society that we live in you know there's no judgment people just continue things and you always wonder sometimes they're ever going to be any accountability and he goes on to say here in the 16th verse and he saw there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor there was therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness had sustained him for you put on righteousness as a breastplate and a helmet of salvation and he put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing and was caught with the seal as a cloak and according to their deeds according he will repay Fury to his adversaries reprehens to his enemies and to the islands he will repay replicants and we know as we go back in the gospel what Jesus had to say about there's always a time for judgment right now is the time of Grace and this 19th verse is what I was thinking about this morning so shall the fear of the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun and this is really important to me or to watch this year and me shall come in like a flood and the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and that's where we're at this morning wherever your circumstances are if you put your trust in him he's going to raise up that standard for you he's going to lead you and make you successful whatever your tribulation is this morning you know you've got to believe it for yourself people can encourage you lead you guide you but you have to step out in faith yourself and it goes on on the 21st here and said the Redeemer shall come design and unto them that turn from transgression to Jacob saith Lord and this last verse as for me this is my Covenant with them saith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the Lord from henceforth and forever you know it's a you know it goes back to what God said to Moses in the burning bush it's a living God I am that I am and it's the same thing for us this morning Jesus Christ hasn't changed we might get away from him but the spirit of the Holy Ghost and Christ himself he never changes as long as you're pushing toward him he's going to meet you Brother David foreign it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and looking forward to what God has for us by the way of his word this morning and you man I don't know about you but I'm excited this morning and looking forward to what he's got for us in store and hey man I sing that little course I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord this morning if we could amen well I was glad when they said unto me oh I was glad when they said unto me
