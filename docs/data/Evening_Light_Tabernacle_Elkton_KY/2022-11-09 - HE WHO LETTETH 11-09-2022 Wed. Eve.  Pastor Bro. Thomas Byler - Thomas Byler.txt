you know I was thinking as they were singing that song and I don't know how many of you that listen to gospel music ever remember the magruders they were out over there for about an hour from where we used to live out in Arkansas they were Pentecostal family that uh sang gospel music and uh they were real good friends with uh but Earl Gregory and we went to several their concerts but Priscilla Magruder got cancer and uh there's a song that she wrote her and her husband and when they were saying that the Bible that's that's the book of me I stand up on the word of God well she got so sick with cancer that she didn't know what else to do so her husband came by one morning and he said he's seen her standing and she was standing on top of the Bible he said I thought she had done lost her mind because of her medication that she was on and he said Priscilla honey he said what is wrong with you she said all else has failed she said there's only one place to stand she said I'm standing on the word of God and I thought of that song this while they were singing that night and you say well that's kind of where else could we go tonight but to God's word for everything that we have need of in our hearts and life amen let's stand tonight if we could and pray this song service been a blessing to you tonight and looking forward to what God has for us by the way the word and amen listen to

how I lost [Music] amen praise the Lord good evening good to be house Lord hey that is enjoying this nice summer weather amen praise the Lord thank you musicians amen it's certainly amen I don't know about you but you better enjoy the last couple of days isn't that right because some of that nice nice weather's coming right around the corner where you can put on a few more jackets and I don't have to run to air anymore I've been running my air at the house I thought well it gets warm in here if it's warm it's warm so I got a couple more days left I've never ran the air air hardly November but amen but I like it cool I don't know about you when I go to sleep I like to have a blanket over me or too and have it cool so amen God is good isn't he amen amen radical but turn them lights on would you put in the balcony I'm not used to having it that dark back there amen remember John God bless you I know brother Danny different ones I know the different ones that are feeling the best so we have some of that old stuff going around but amen we just pray the Lord will raise everybody right back up again enjoy the weekend did you I mean that was good wasn't that really enjoyed that Amen Brother Bill being up here and ministering for us and getting to hear him again amen and so amen I can't think of any announcements or anything so let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you father tonight once again Lord being assembled together in your name we know that wherever two or three are gathered in your name there you are in our midst Lord and as we open the Bible tonight father and want to speak just on something we feel oh God that you've revealed to us Lord Jesus we ask God do you just give the inspiration and help us to say what you once said tonight benefit and edify the body of Christ Lord Lord meet all the needs you know what they are Lord and I know the different ones are not feeling the best amen Joshua's tonight he's not feeling too good from what understands we ask God do you bless him touch him Lord and Lord we just ask now father that you just help us bless the meeting together our gathering together the effort that everybody has made Lord Jesus to be here and those that get online Lord and listen we ask God that you'd blessed him also made ourselves to you yield ourselves so you use this for your purpose to God Jesus Christ's name amen and amen amen I just had this uh low thought come to me and amen I guess you know I just try to follow the leading of the spirit amen and so I think I have at least a couple little things probably maybe that you've not heard before amen amen but most of it we probably have amen but this is just kind of different so if you will turn to Second Thessalonians second Thessalonians the second chapter and I was trying to think of what I was thinking about when I come to this scripture and and so forth but for some reason it was just a certain portion of this scripture that kind of stuck with me and and I began to build on amen and so uh amen but I trust it'll be a blessing to you tonight you know I may just say this I truly believe that we need revelation amen and I suppose you know I don't want to say just especially but especially uh preachers amen uh because I know the Eagles feed on Fresh Revelation isn't that right amen and something that's just fresh to you it doesn't matter what it is amen and we certainly appreciate it so this to me it was just a different different something different I felt like the Lord just give them to me in a different angle but um it just stemmed from the second chapter of second Thessalonians we'll begin with verse 1. that would beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gather there unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by letter nor by word nor by letter s from us as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that they shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition amen amen now can I just stop there a minute and and how many knows who the Son of Perdition was really when you think about it uh it was what God brought in in the way by serpency and that right which was Cain isn't that right he was the first son of perdition amen and he talked about him being revealed when did we ever have a message coming how the church has fought against what serpency right they just couldn't take that but that's not a Perdition is revealed who opposes and exalters himself above all that is called God or that is worship so that he asked God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withholdth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity it does already work only who who now letteth will let till he be taken of the out of the way and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming may God add this blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated amen perhaps uh perhaps it was this it just comes back to me now and I think that perhaps I was thinking about the age in which we were living in and the hour in which we're living in and the way that things are going and how wicked things are getting and how much it looks like certainly we can say that it just you know that the devil is in control amen and that the devil is running things that's it folks I mean the devil's run things yeah truly he is he's running things here on Earth you know and better man I mean when the message from the God of this evil age and he was just talking about how horrible things were and we find out that she is naked and lewd and nude and the world seems to be in the most evil age ever never in any age that women act the way they did it never but just before the destruction of the andaluvian world and Jesus referred to it he says and then he'll get to that after a while now he's talking about that and I get to thinking about how her brother Bannon perhaps talked about the women the way they were he talked about of course homosexuality and when we when I think about it and how that what they're doing and they're just messing everything up including our kids now isn't that right and how many knows that we we realized and I kind of looked for it years ago realized that whenever the Sodom and Gomorrah they pushed themselves over into lot righteous rot lot as the scripture says you know uh that it Rex his righteous soul and so forth you know that even they pushed themselves into that we find ourselves that that homosexual spirit and so forth is uh uh uh you know pushing themselves all the way into our children and I was amazed to see on the news somewhere and then where they're even teaching uh you know about sexual preferences to our kids since in public some public schools and there's liberal places including if you'll notice perversion or a sodomy if you understand uh you know and so forth that's what the teaching you I thought man I look at how terrible it is man I don't know about you but wouldn't you just jerk your kids out of there if you knew anything was like that being told her your kids come back but you know and you and you look at where it's going amen and then we look at that and then we see here uh you know that and I want to title this he who now let us will let amen he who now let us will let now notice but abandoned right after he says this and Jesus referred to it and we'll get to it after a while has God lost control well he perhaps says that because perhaps it looks like it right it looks like the devil has just got full control because we know that he's making a Satan's eating isn't that right but I noticed I want you to notice something here that you know when brother Branham explained this scripture in the second Thessalonians the uh the seventh chapter from what I understand only he who now led us will let until he be taken out of the way the way that I understand the prophets call explaining that until he he said he the Holy Ghost is taken out of the way is that right how many understands that if you don't understand but about method he says one day the holy spirit will be taken out of the way isn't that right and then the mystery now notice and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming we know that God one day is going to pull the Holy Ghost there's going to be a Rapture take place isn't that right God's gonna pull these people out of here before he destroyed the Devil with the brightness of his coming amen all right so has God lost control now now I have another just one more line here that I really want to get to but let me go back and just kind of expound a little bit for we know that the mystery of iniquity certainly does already work right this thing is really working the spirit of iniquity is certainly working overtime is that right and I like this he says only he who now let I wish I'd wrote this all down I didn't take the time like I said amen because when you look at that it says there's somebody that's letting something happen right now when you let something happen right you're in control right in other words before somebody does something they got to have permission to do it or if they do it it's because you let them do it now I want to tell you tonight that who's who's the letter who lets God right he's the one that's truly in control has gotten lost control no he's in control but he's letting he's allowing right and I got to thinking about that he's letting it happen anything that's happening God's letting it happen right so it's it it it to me it displays power right it talks about having the greater power we know that God is the greater power not the devil amen oh my so we see here we see God in this scripture I mean those how brother bam said this just comes to me but bam says you know you got to find thought in scriptures Jesus Christ find him in every scripture and I see him in this one only he who now let us we'll let amen dude I get a little something out of that it's just for me the letter because without the letter ain't nobody gonna do nothing nothing gonna happen unless he lets it happen he would have never fallen if God wouldn't have let it have got the oh my God you all get too happy with me now nothing but what he loves amen but what he allows only what only he who let us will not let until [Applause] he be taken it out of the way let me put this down so now what happens when God takes him out of the way right let me see with that word I like this word here I want to just Revel in it a little bit okay only he who now letters will let until [Applause] to a certain point right to a certain place you live until he be taken out of the way [Music] and I just want to say then God will have his day isn't that right I mean that's when the day of the Lord will come cruel like a thief in the night amen we just can't fathom what God's going to do in that tribulation period the people that are left here on the Earth are in for our some real I mean we're not talking we're talking about yeah something on the scale of Noah cataclysmic Universal only it's going to be by fire this time there's going to be earthquakes involved there's going to be volcanoes coming forth erupting everywhere how many heard the story of yellow yellow stone is it and the volcano if that one ever erupted it would destroy almost the whole world if that one ever come up out of there and brother bam says man the volcanoes will rub the inside will go inside out and everything else oh burying people you wipe this thing clean folks he'll fold that thing he'll fold this thing up like you ain't never seen because he's going to come whenever he takes that out of the way he's going to destroy the Devil with the brightness of his coming amen because why he's up there and he's fixing to come he's fixing to come back and as he comes back he's going to destroy the world until so there's a point that which he's not going to let any more amen so back in 64 God of this evil age has God lost control or is he just permitting huh is he just permitting another agency to control huh so if the devil has any power now if he's can doing any controlling it's because that lets him do amen back to back to the battle uh that brother Brad preached on Matthew 5 there where the devil took him up on all the mountain and he showed him all the kingdoms and he had he would be all belong to him not only did all the kingdoms belong to him all of humanity belonged to him you're quiet on me now why and the devil it was a it was a power struggle is what it was it was a power struggle and just before he went and paid for it at Calvary to never tried to offer it to him isn't that right tried to make a deal he tried to have more power than God I don't want to say the devil's stupid but the devil's stupid not to think that he could challenge God and win come on man didn't you live with him up there for a while you got to know they ain't nobody ever gonna win against him but he had to try yeah but he had to try and he did it wasn't but a few years maybe a year and a half I don't know just how long or later when Jesus went to Calvary folks huh when he went to Calvary and when he shed his blood and when he spilled his blood upon the Earth how many knows that he paid for it he bought it up now before then the devil had permission that the devil had what we call a right to everybody we were in what the devil's pawn shop weren't we he had control of us I'll tell you what no matter how much our holy David was no I'm not a righteous David wasn't how much like a man of God the devil still had rights huh and that's why that most of those people never were complete Overcomers because they had the devil had rights yet same way with Samson Moses a temper and everything else kept him out of the Promised Land the devil had rights not just permission but he had a right to be there amen he had everybody get rights to be there it was his it belonged to his because it was forfeited Adam forfeited it and the devil had control of it until Calvary now many knows when Calvary happened when he shied his blood it was momentous it was a Monumental thing because God the power question of power was over then all right the power question was over amen he paid the price and then Ephesians Paul says the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word to believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrote In Christ when he raised him from the dead it set him at his own right hand in Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named foreign not only in this world but I in that within the world that is to come and that's put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all so we see now that after Calvary he ascended and he is above every principality every Power every night every Dominion he's above it all he has the right to do whatever whenever however he wants to how many he believes that he has a right now God bought it back he purchased it amen and he give us an inheritance in him and we are his body isn't that right now I notice how it says that we are his body and God has put all these things under his feet so if you're in the body of Christ every devil every Dominion every principality every sickness every devil is under your feet you're above all of it one time you couldn't do that you had to be sad you had to be sorrowful you couldn't overcome sin you had to sin again you had to be sad again you had no Victory there ain't no way for you to ever maintain victory uh sometimes we don't appreciate the joy and the peace the Forgiveness the grace the love that we have it's the greatest thing that we possess is these things amen and sometimes we take him for granted isn't that right now notice I like this this is what comes to me when I got to thinking about he who led it oh I like to get in the paws my mind when he got this inspiration to say that only he who now let us will let I like that it may be so simple it may be twisted English I don't know but I like it only he who now let us will let he's gonna let him have dominion he's gonna let him iniquity abound he's going to do holiday he think until a certain time amen so I like that this is all let me just say this all of what's happening today is happening by permission by permission because God could come and claim what he has purchased at any time is that right he could come and change it he could say time shall be no more he could say all right I've had enough he could say it is done it is finished anytime but he knows when he's going to say that what time he's going to say that but who knows he's going to say it's done he's gonna say time is no more huh he's gonna say that's it I'm not permitting it anymore I don't know about you but I can go and not say we had a great service because we found out that God is in control huh anything that's happening to only happen by permission they got to have a permit God has to give him a permit before he does anything poor devil can't do anything with answer all right I mean that goes for you that goes for me I'm not the prophet taught is that with job the devil that could not touch Joe God had an edge around it and so much more you and I God's believers we've got to hedge around us and nothing can happen to us according to the Bible according to the prophet of God the devil's got to have permission before he does anything and me as a human being I'm sure you as a human being we don't say God sent me God we say no Lord thank you for the Hedge keep the heads there huh beeping out don't open the gate don't let him in huh and God knows how to do it is what he's doing it's quite unique let me say this it's quite unique because the most of the world don't believe it that anything that happens to you as a Christian God has to permit it first if it happens to you it happens for a reason God is allowing it I like to know that don't you they don't know what in the world is going on wow all these things happening to me to get chaos because they don't have a God Like United you can have confidence tonight that to know that nothing can happen to you without permission God can't touch you without permission and God does allow a thing about the debt but God does give the devil permission to touch you even one place how many times you better bam say the devil's got a Punch coming he's got one punch coming it may be this and it may be that and it may be the other huh we're gonna cover that tonight all right praise the Lord Revelation series brother bam says now notice oh this does me so good I get to really feeding oh let's let our hearts just loose a few minutes Satan is a squatter he don't legally own this oh my when Christ came as a Kinsmen Redeemer and redeemed it back to us but Satan possesses or he has a right or or he has a he's a squatter he says but you know after this fight's all over he's cast into the Lake of Fire and so forth he'll be done away with and all them that worship with him but The Heirs of Salvation will come with Christ but now he's a squatter amen how many knows that if somebody comes into your house they're called squatters they have no legal right to be there and you can kick it off if you want to praise be to God but Abraham says remember in the Old Testament a man lost his inheritance in this quarter coming on his land and he could hold it he could hold it any longer for annihilation from the owner until 50 years now after 50 years the Jubilee came by that Do You Believe come along and then everything went back to the original again all slaves if he got into slavery no matter how much bad you were then your whole family becomes late when that do believe sounded you had a parcel of land that was yours and you might lose it none of us get a ride to it but after 50 years it goes right back to the original owner which means what that means no matter how much of his baby I become that land still belongs to you that's where it was with the Old Testament I'll tell you what that no matter what it was old big name the devil was squatting on Humanity but when that Jubilee sounded we had a right to go back and possess our land and our land is to be back with God the way that Adam was right with God that's why you can ask and it would be given unto him praise God oh my anybody that got on that in that 50-year span they were just squatters let me tell you something that's what the devil is right now because Jesus has done sound of Jubilee is that right we have something that you believe in everybody that hears that Jubilee that Jubilee sound you can go back and possess that land amen how many knows I land is eternal life the holy ghost that Adam lost amen how many knows now this Bliss land here this ground here belongs to God huh it belongs to God and the devil has no legal right to jump on your property amen and if he does something happens because a lot of times the sickness will jump on you this will jump on you that'll jump on you huh what do we do kick him out cast out the devil amen no no legal writing anymore praise the Lord he's just a squatter praise be to God oh my when he was on earth when Christ was on Earth he conquered every gate the enemy had is that right well whatever it was he conquered the gates of sickness he conquered the gates of death whatever whatever and he said whatever you ask on Earth but it will be bound on Earth and I'll be healed mine in heaven you give us the key to the gate he conquered the Gate of Temptation by the words and the key was resist the enemy and he'll flee from you he conquered it all every sickness death hell the great he conquered death and Hell Oh my he conquered what the others couldn't conquer because they're The Original Seed this is the spiritual seed he conquered the gates of the grave and Rose up on the third day for our justification and now we are more than conquerors oh and we just walked right into our inheritance more than conquerors now he says we are this is what the quote I was looking for we are dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated Glory I mean those probably got many times said whenever Jesus died on Calvary he stripped the devil up every rights that he had he ain't got no legal rights anymore at all oh he stripped him he robbed him about everything he had any power he had any rights that he had he stripped him of it and gave it to you huh praise be to God now praise be to God let no wonder Paul could say all things are yours remember that scripture we said all things whether it's life whether it's dance whether it's things present whether it's Paul no matter what it is whether it's things that come on oh thing to yours Paul said he got such a revelation that it's out that he said everything's ours [Laughter] do you see how it ought to give us just a little more joy than that realize everything is yours you ain't got to be afraid of cancer you ain't got to be afraid of death you ain't got to be afraid to die you ain't got to be afraid of any fear or not you ain't got to be scared of anything you're dealing with a defeated enemies we're disputing he says we are disputing with a conquered enemy oh my I like that no wonder Paul could say when David was building The Chopping Block to chop his head off he says oh death where is your sting oh my show me where you can make me squirm and scream grave where is your victory oh you think you'll mold me out there I'll point you to an empty tomb over there and I'm in him and he'll raise me up at the last Paul didn't scream that didn't make Paul squirm and scream he says I'm more than willing to go let him let Ray Ray and let it slide down there and let my head fall into the bucket he didn't mind because God does permit things like that to happen God permits his Saints to be killed and I got to thinking about that when I was meditating on this well what about that look at what God permitted down through the Dark Ages be thou faithful unto death even Jesus said don't be afraid of those that can destroy your body don't fear them huh because how many of those Satan can only do so much right one of the worst things he's going to ever do to us is take control of your money you ain't buying and selling unless you belong me that's all the power he got if we're not huh Jesus had enough to give us joy and happiness forgive us amen he's going to raise us from the dead he's going to give us immortality give us power over all of that all the only Power the devil have is these natural means and so forth huh to try to persuade people to go his way deception lusts and all that other stuff amen all right praise the Lord Hallelujah a defeated enemy brother Brown said why he's operating under permission God could take this thing rightfully anytime that he chose to amen I know we could go in a Nebuchadnezzar and all the kingdoms could go hurt especially remember Herod told Jesus he says the power to kill you or to free you what was Jesus reply you would have no power unless my daddy my father give it to you this father that's in me unless he had given it to you you wouldn't even be where you are now here we come to the part that I trust you probably never heard before because I didn't I'm going to read just a little bit first I want to read let's talk to Matthew if you will I want to give you a 40-minute sermon tonight but I think it's going to be a little longer before we go into this let me just cover something else another place remember Herod you have no pollen levels given and Jesus says one place he says that they don't take my life written that right he says I lay it down whatever they did he permitted them to do it he allowed them to do it yeah they didn't they didn't take him by force they took him by permission tell me something when they came at Jesus the first time from what I understand they were all thrown back there was such a power they were thrown back from what understand is that right they were thrown back even though they were thrown back I don't know what power that was maybe a bunch of angels but they were thrown back and then a second then they came back at him and of course they took him and led him away but you know no he he willfully laid down his life here we find in Matthew 14 22 and straight away Jesus constrained his disciples again to his ship and to go before him on to the other side and while they sent poorly sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was not in the midst of the sea tossed with ways for the wind was contrary and much of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when his disciples saw him on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit in the creek I cried out for fear I believe in John it talks about how that he would have he walked by he made like he was going to walk by him but straight with Jesus fake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid didn't but a man preach my message called it is I be not afraid when he did something and he talked about what he what he did when Jesus made himself known and did Miracles like that and even brother bam says in this generation all the phds and all those thought man it's a spirited celebrity it's a devil or it scared him and brother Banner preached your message don't be afraid it is Jesus it's here to help you and Peter answered and said on him Lord if it be thou bid me coming to thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but what he saw the wind was boisterous and he was afraid and Begins the beginning of sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou little faith wherefore did down now amen Jesus got right to the point didn't he and when they were coming to the ship I noticed not until but when they were come into the ship the wind ceased and they that were in the ship came in worshiped saying of a truth Thou Art the son of God brother Ben I'm talking about this says it this way one night after preaching a long time he sent his disciples away and he they got into a ship and went out there without him oh my and when did he when he did then he then he's out into the sea that little ship was and the little Storm come up and the devil said I've got them away from me now I've got these holy rollers away from their masses I'll see how much message they're going to take the whole world I'll drown under one of them out there so there come up a great storm the devil begin to snort his breath and the storm came up and the little ship began to bounce up and down like this the sails broke the horse dropped the ship filled with water and it was the darkest time no doubt they were holding one another around the waist and crying they thought oh where has he gone what has happened to him why didn't we wait to take him with us why didn't we want uh what didn't he we have him in the boat and many times you think the same thing my friend you have out went out they're off without him but remember he's still watching you he knows right where you are oh man he says here I'm in me trouble it may be trouble in your home it may be trouble in your soul there may be trouble in your body whatever it is don't you worry he's got his eyes on you amen he's watching you he climbed up on top of a mountain the Bible says remember he went up on the mountain he was looking out there and he seen every trick that the devil was playing Hallelujah he not only climbed but he climbed the ramparts of Glory not only to Calvary but the ramp parts of glory and he sets night at his majesty he looks down on Earth here's the part I don't think he ever heard before but this is what I want to make my point that is not even a ripple can come on the water without his permission the sea can't move a leaf can't move a bird can't fly without his permission now I added that permission last time but that's what he was talking about not even a ripple on the ocean not a leaf fall from a tree not a bird fighting not the engine Supreme control how many square for that that's right be Not Afraid oh blessed be the name of the Lord he's above all principalities and Powers amen oh you might think well we ought to just take control we've got to be over this we over that remember God's just allowing the Devil to do these things but he'll stop him one day oh my the Earth may hit the lowest thing that could be brought God gave him the highest name that could be given the Earth put him in as low as they could get him into Sinner's grave but God raised him into the highest why he's so high then he has to look down to see heaven Hallelujah His Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know he want to with me aren't you glad tonight God's watching you wherever you go hey man he's making sure that no courage and no wreck amen you get over to the car because you're texting or something amen and if that wheel drops off into that big ditch it's gonna suck you right into it hey man it could throw you right into that tree you're gonna die and you come with an inch just be checking back you know what I'm talking about yeah some of those places you almost run off probably die but he watches you he's watching you Hallelujah aren't you glad he's to travel the ramparts of glory and he's got his eye on you the devil can't take you nothing can happen to you until God is done with you praise be to God his eyes on the sparrow he knows everything that's gonna oh yeah God's in control sure the devil he may be doing what he does but he's only doing it by permission that makes me happy how many know when I see these blessings and these promises in the Bible I can see what brother bam says we ought to be the people in the world we ought to be the happiest people in the world to have a god like we have the promises we haven't possess what you possess amen I'll say what comes to mind every Earthly possession you'll probably no doubt lose one day all of our possessions and the things that we get at church from God it's the only thing that we'll have at the very end so let's make sure we enjoy church we enjoy the things of God amen don't let it get stale to you don't let it get old to you don't let preaching get old to you amen I know I sit out there I know how easy it is man I'll give you some rocks to sit on you we get way too comfortable back there and folding our hands and spectate I wonder what the preacher's gonna vote for you I like that that's a good thought to know that's more thought that's the Holy Spirit revealing and giving things and and I'll tell you what if you really want to bring the spirit of God down get into the spirit the way that the preachers in the spirit we'll have service then hey man how he believes that amen I always try to amen and not just be too comfortable on my seat because we're here to Worship in spirit any truth amen I'm trying to preach and that means that this is a good lesson for us preachers amen the preacher that's out there when you're sitting there the way you want to be amen and Hallelujah amen because that's the kind of service we're going to have each and every one is not a spectator we're all participant participators amen praise be to God all right oh my praise the Lord he watches you he knows every thought that's in your mind he knows every faction that every action that you make you know everything about you that's right you say well I'm backslid motherboard that ain't gotta make a big man don't make a bit of difference huh he knows exactly why you're backslaughter slid over maybe this is out there on the internet maybe your backslid well I can't get back to God don't you even think that God's got his eye on you he knows why you are where you are he's got his eye on you he knows exactly where you're at without him oh my but listen he's knocking at your door trying to get you back he's still got his eye on you oh my listen to this no matter what you've done he still got his eye on you those disciples went off without him in the darkest hour when the devil got them away from there away from his dress and she began he begins to storm on them maybe that's what he's doing to you tonight huh can you imagine how many knows Jesus knew all about that he was watching him he's seen the Storm come he knows they were about to sink and did he show up he showed up oh my just a thought that comes God won't send you somewhere where it won't take care of you isn't that right and Jesus sent him go on across the devil tried to sink and before they got the cross but I told them go across oh my brother man says he went without him he got out of his presence and they begin to sink Jesus come back on to see him because there he was foreign and when he finally got back on the boat the winds calmed down how many knows that's the way it is sometimes when you get away from God from God Amen these storms happen they all happen for a reason but he's always there in The Darkest Hour amen listen to what brother bam says maybe that's what he's doing to you tonight he got out of his presence he might give you a cancer foreign the devil to give you a cancer right give you this he might give you that he might give you a he might give you a tore up car he might give you worry she might give you a headache he will do but there's one thing I do know that God still got his eye on you he wants to see what you'll do he wants to test you he goes on to talk to him he's laying around the other one he talks about our troubles and our trials is what shackles away breaks the shackles of the world a lot of time a lot of times those trees sing shackles of the spirit get us gets us free from all the Warmness because of the easy and everything nice that don't hardly ever do anything for us make you lazy oh my same way with the disciples remember another time he was even in the boat you're right but he was asleep Jesus was asleep he was in his subconscious he was out of it so to speak right and the devil coming he blowed his breath and the man they were sinking isn't that right throwing stuff off and then they were they were fat in fact hey Jesus it's time to wake up put in trouble out here we know you made the water in the wine you you made fishes and Loaves and all these Miracles you done you can take care of it they should just don't fret this wake him up how about that in our triple in our world still Fred just wake him up call him on the scene commit him to the case oh my one thing's sure he's got his eye on you this may be your darkest hour I don't know God does but just in that Darkest Hour when they were just about ready to go down then Jesus come walking on the waters amen just all undisturbed the big waves just flattened out there in front of him as he walked along Peter said Lord if that be me you bid me come to you he says come on walk out here ask and you shall receive see can you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you amen praise the Lord even they can they can do go on without permission amen the Devil Couldn't sink them without permission now couldn't he amen I like that they couldn't do it without without God's permission can't do anything without God's permission praise the Lord I don't know about you but I'm I'm expecting the Lord to come and bring the stuff that is one of these days we already know what the scripture says about Daniel remember Nebuchadnezzar the dream that he had the head of gold all the way down to the iron and the clay Christian from Gorbachev and the two kingdoms and fighting each other all the way utility and until the stone was cut out of the mountain it comes in crushes the world amen one more lesson one more thought here sometimes God opens the gate sometimes God takes that hedge away from the Stoney things happen to us we don't understand we always want to be on top of the world listen to this this will be a lesson for us like Paul said he had an infirmity something was bothering him the devil would Buffet him huh remember that the devil would just buff it Paul blow after blow and he consulted the Lord three times to take that thing away he said I don't want this Lord take it from me now I may know that whenever you're in the Lord's care and you're a child of God whatever comes to you the best thing to do is to commit it to the Lord trust the Lord in it believe the Lord Jesus Christ and go on what some people do is that well I don't understand why he hasn't healed me I don't understand why this is on me and I have to complain don't worry about it you don't know what it is if God's done it and you know it's his doing there's for a reason it's for a purpose Paul he didn't want that thing amen take it away from him then one night the Lord spoke to him said Saul or Paul my grace is sufficient for you he says well then I'll glory and my infirmities let me remember how many times Paul says I'm gonna brag I'm bragging about my many infirmities all right all right I'm not going to glory in how big a church I have and how big of preaching how many Souls I've said I'm just going to glory in my infirmities I've been Shipwrecked I've been Beat to Death I've been left for death three times with life he's twice without giving stripes and so forth and stone and everything else and praise be to God don't you realize that whenever Jesus talked to Paul first I'm going to show you the things that you're going to suffer from my kingdom and my when the first things God promising me to go do some suffering I'd like to have a Ministry god promise you I'm going to let you suffer a little here I'll glory in it I know you're a Healer I've seen you heal the sick raise it at cast out Devils Open the Eyes of the blind but if I've consulted to you and you tell me it's your grace is sufficient then this devil that bothers me is Growing Pains of your grace whoa then our glory and my infirmities why if these I be exalted above the abundance of the revelations man I'll get lifted up too high with these Revelations I'll just get up too high come on folks we sometimes don't think we can get up too hot yeah you can get up so high until you think you're invincible and you're all this and you're all that God has to knock you down realize no you're not all this and you're not all that he had something the other disciples did not have have he saw them after the death burial and resurrection and Ascension amen now on down he saw him back in the pillar of fire form see Paul did he was very special he had and Paul said except I be exalted and want to build me some great seminaries or something else and great big something or another at least I'd be exalted about the abundance above revelation God let a guy God let a messenger of the Devil Keep Me beat down whoa I don't like to hear that um can I just say something maybe maybe that's why God don't give us some of us millions of dollars huh maybe some of us just need to be happy with who our God give us he's just no matter how hard some people try to get rich they just can't get rich why don't you just be happy you know because brother bam says there's as many Penny errors as there's millionaires what was it Paul and Susie one time his brother told me he says you know they knew that certain guy that he'd stumble over the dollars to get to pennies listen how much money he liked money so well he'd tumble over the dollars to get the pennies anyway I'll let you interpret that yeah what is it Paul here he says you know God knows to keep it how to keep us down he says Paul says for and what did the Holy Ghost say he says for when you are weak then am I strong amen there was a point that I wanted to make now we'll make it here keep me beat down he said I'm weak I'm strong strong Amen brother bass says Growing Pains of Grace what does it make what do trials do it makes us reliant on him relying we could stay that on a long time he says you know and so forth Oh my he may permit Crossroads he may permit Crossroads to try us to perfect us to his service amen he may permit that now church both here and on to take world he may permit the crossed roads for our service like he did Daniel that little Crossroad one time he says you know he was on and he let the king turn against him and throw him into the lion's den how many knows the laws of little land in that hour turn to where he come against Daniel and it got thrown I mean it was the laws of our land is turning certainly against you amen and it did him he had got a loud these things allowed that happened to Daniel the hell out it happened to three Hebrew children job is a perfect example of a man that was so perfect before God but God permitted the devil to come in and so forth how many knows even his wife couldn't hold on and told job not to hold on but God knew he would hold on he would hold his Integrity God said he says there ain't a man like him you can't make him curse me and he couldn't amen he may cross permit Crossroads amen now notice one more one more just quick thought one thing that we uh the point I want to make going back to the boat if you'll notice how that uh let me see here where's my story well I think it's in the scripture itself and when they were in this and and then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of the truth Thou Art the son of God let me just in closing say this and I want to call it the most precious thing in our life what's the most precious thing in our life and I know we'd say the Holy Ghost but I want to take a scriptures and just read you a scripture and that when we're going through these things Wendy's disciples seen what God come how did he delivered them and the power that he had and he'd come in there on the ship they realized the tread of a truth out the son of God Jesus said yet a little while and the world seeth me no more let me say this the most precious thing we have but ye see me because I live ye shall live also all around the message you can hear it in different churches everybody's talking about well God healed me and God did this and God did this and God did that all we can talk about is what God did what God's doing you know what it is every one of I I don't care who it is every one of us wants to see Christ in our life are you with me the most precious thing is when you go through trials and when God delivers you out of that trial it shows that he's on the ship that he's watching you that he's caring for you that he's on board and I don't know about you but that's the most precious thing we have is to know when God comes and he shows himself that he's with us just the other day Brother David called me amen and he said uh texted me or call me he says you know something Tommy send him you know something that was working on him and God just showed him it was just a verification oh and he was all excited I was like praise be to God that's it that's right that's what we look for we look for verification we look for God to confirm himself wouldn't the day I see him I see him that's what makes us happy is to see Christ in our life how many believes that the most precious thing we have is to know and he's watching us and then nothing can touch us without his permission and that he's on board that's all we care about is that we've got not left him but he's here in every heart amen not necessarily just in the church but in every individual's house where many believe that I like that scriptures the world they don't see no don't see him I think it was Bill that read a scripture that says you know uh you know every house is built by a man he says but which has the greater glory the house or the man that built it right and it's the same way with God what's greater the creation what is the most glorious the creation of the Creator I mean the whole world is enjoying his creation but they don't realize what's greater than the creation is the creator if people just give him the glory let's do it he's one that's worthy of it I'll stand with me tonight God bless you I hope you enjoyed that little thought Lord laid on my heart only he who let it will let he's in control the devil's been stripped he ain't no got no rights I thought about bringing the flashlight and shutting all these lights off and we could have done it with just simple uh just a simple light switch and you know it's like the devil and all of everything that he is and it seems like it's so powerful but you turn them lights off and you just turned Ash light on right and if you turn that flashlight on and it came on but yet everything was dark if it stayed dark you'd say that flashlight wouldn't be working right in your mind because you know that when that flashlight comes on the darkness scatters they can't make a light they can't make a light that takes out or or Another Life a Darkness a dark light that'll take out light amen light always pushes the darkness away and that's the same way it is with Christ when he's in your heart the second that light comes in from this fleas sorrow fear all of that goes away let's bow our heads Lord Jesus and before I pray I'm sure it's your heart's desire but how many in here receive want to see more of God in your life say Lord I want to see more of you in my life art I want to see you because you promised us you said that the world wouldn't see me but you're gonna see me you're gonna see me working in your life you're going to see me do things and that's what we are that's our our belonging of our heart our hearts desire both here out there listening everybody that's listening no doubt but that's our hearts desire our Lord is we want to see you we want to see you Lord working in our life and we want to be sure to know that you're on the ship and we never want to leave your presence father anytime we get in trouble we're so thankful that we can call on the Great Master we can call on you from the ramparts of glory and you will be there just like you were for the Hebrew children from Daniel for your children you'll be there Lord and we see you in that way God we want to thank you Lord Jesus and we raise our hands say oh I want to see you Lord Jesus in a greater way in our life Lord from this Wednesday night on Lord help me to be looking let me be listening
