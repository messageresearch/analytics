said if someone comes on your heart this ain't exactly the way he said it I can't remember that well but he said if you feel like praying for him he said pray for him he said because your prayer is what God's waiting to here for for them to get their healing I thought Lord don't let me be a slacker in praying you know there's a lot of needs and but I'm I'm still believing and still believing with all my heart that God's A Healer aren't you you know and I think of sister Sherry and I think of the different ones and little Jonathan and I think Lord if we can only believe all things are

you tonight amen praise the Lord amen trust you're having a good week amen so God bless you we want to continue Amen on our series with the help of the Lord amen and amen I felt like U um just the Lord just begin to pour a little something out on onto me and I uh anyway so sometimes when you get under that inspiration things come and so amen we'll just see what the Lord will have for us tonight amen praise the Lord so if you will let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we come before you Lord once again coming into your presence Lord Jesus and Desiring God that you'll have your way and that your holy spirit will have the preeminence and everything that is said and done Lord Jesus and that you'd receive honor and glory and praise father from what is said tonight Lord Lord and that you look upon every heart father we're so grateful Lord Jesus that you know every part of us Lord and every thought of our mind exactly what our condition our heart is in Lord and you know exactly what we have need of and you're such a great physician Lord that we just pray God that you would take Lord Jesus and father Lord as you know father exactly what is wrong with us Lord that you would bring Lord the antidote so to speak father and that the medicine that we would re receive would give us the cure for what we have need of to make us the kind of people that we should be Lord father we ask God that you just bless the meditation of our heart that which we feel you've laid upon the heart to speak now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord amen all right let's turn our bibles if you will to the book of um let me see which one I wanted to go to First amen and I believe it [Applause] was first Timothy First Timothy put this down a little bit like okay amen I know when I adjust it they have to adjust it so we want to try to let them know first Timothy amen First Timothy 6 and verse 12 1 Timothy 6 and 12 and then also second Timothy 4 and 7 says fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life where unto thou W also called and H has professed a good profession before many witnesses second Timothy 4 and verse 7 it says it this way second Timothy 4 and verse 7 I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not only to me not me only but unto all them that love his appearing may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you can be seated tonight amen so my thought is I'm not sure which part this will be but amen this is going to kind of once again speak about an overview of the Christian amen and I want to speak on two aspects of it with the help of the Lord tonight amen I want to speak on what a Christian isn't and what a Christian is amen amen and so we're going to try to help with the help of the Lord uh just to speak for a little while and and uh try to take it as slow as we can amen and we want to first start with what a Christian isn't amen what a Christian Isn't So praise the Lord amen so I've got several things wrote down here amen and uh I want to start with a quote amen a quote that brother Benham made and then we'll try to get a scripture for it amen certainly he thought Brother Brad did an outstanding job Sunday morning didn't he amen of course he always does so that's nothing new amen really appreciate Amen brother Brad's Ministry amen amen certainly you know and I want to kind of start here from this quote you people here from the Farms many of you know it you can take a hand and you can lay a uh it can lay an egg but if the male bird hasn't been with her it'll never hatch it's not fertile Amen in the old mother bird in the springtime he says the old mother bird can get out and make her a nest and lay a whole nest full of eggs and she can sit on that nest and hover over those eggs and turn them every few minutes and sit there until she gets so poor she can't even fly off the nest and if she hasn't been with the male bird that mate those eggs will never hatch that's right they're rotten right there in the nest that's correct and it reminds me of some old cold formal churches that we got around in Indiana here he says just a nest full of rotten eggs you can Pat them and please them and join them into the church shake their hands and everything else but all you got is a nest full of rotten eggs what we need tonight is men and women with an experience of God that come in contact with the mate of the church Church Jesus Christ has so germanized it by the Holy Ghost amen has got faith to believe the word of the Living God Amen so the one thing the first thing I want to say is that how many believes that a Believe real genuine believer is not amen a unitized seed or AEG they're not a rotten AEG amen where we know that the prophet taught he says you know that if you have an egg amen you can take an egg and you can put it of course an incubator we know that keeps the right temperature all about the warmth and the atmosphere that brings that hat that hat set now I've got a few several incubators myself amen and it has a after so many weeks or whatever amen that incubator will go this way and it'll kind of slowly go that way and they go over this way and over that way I don't know why but I guess I get tired of laying on one side too wouldn't you yeah that's supposed to be funny but anyway yeah you know and and rotates it you know and uh but you know was the atmosphere that does it but notice how that with with with somebody that is unitized without that germ of life amen it doesn't matter how warm it is how long it is warm right it don't matter how good the preacher preaches how many shouts and Hallelujah and praise gods and everything else and then they just sit there amen it really doesn't do anything for him amen but now I want to maybe perhaps with the help of the Lord maybe talk about the other side here in a minute I got two pages one is for the Christian amen and what he is but the Christian amen isn't like that how many knows he's not like that Christian has been with the male bird amen and he uh amen whenever the right temperature comes and brother bam says you know when the light strikes across a real genuine seed of God that seed comes to it quick it hatches so to speak amen how many believe that whenever it comes forth and amen that mother has something to mother it's isn't just sitting there amen and beating its head off and man starving itself to death amen trying to make sure and Curry out go up there I go out there and eat a little bit come back and sit down until my just gets puny amen but that's not how a Believer is amen so in other words it's just something that you can't people amen some people you just can't do anything with and it goes back to genetics isn't that right goes back the seed line amen amen I think it's uh uh 13 let me see in 36 amen I've got a few scripture here amen let's first go to John 3 John 3 and 19 I thought this scripture would go along with with talking about how that um the the emphasis tonight is on the fact that it doesn't matter how much warmth they get or atmosphere they get amen it doesn't do anything for them it's like water off of a duck's pack amen I like what the prophet of God said one place he talks about a Christian like a sponge amen and we just absorb everything that God has for us amen yeah a a a sponge absorbs it that's the way a Christian is he's absorbent amen when we come to the house of God the preachers preaching we try to absorb it right take it in amen and you get as much out of it as what you really want amen it just depends if you're absorbing amen but now we know amen there's those that do not have that seed and not me just before we read this um in John let's just go to the woman at the well the brother B talked about he said she had that germ of life in there didn't she she had that germ of life and when that light struck amen she come to life right quick didn't she amen she went into the City and almost the whole city was converted believed on him because of her report because of what she had said but he said the Pharisees and scribes they weren't that way amen amen and we'll take our uh look here first of all talk about the light shining and so forth and and the atmosphere that is there amen for uh even It Shines on the unbeliever now let me see um St John I mean in Matthew here I've got quite a few scriptures so just bear with me three St John 3 and you know I you could bring this into you know the favorite I guess the golden scripture for God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen but let's go over to uh verse 19 and this is the condemnation am mean this is the condemnation that light is com to the world Amen and Men love Darkness rather than light amen amen because their deeds are evil how many know a Christian loves the atmosphere of God loves amen the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost but not everybody likes that not everybody likes to be called out in church amen that everybody likes the light because their deeds were evil amen amen and everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light least his deeds should be reproved amen now notice there how it says you know even though God how many knows God's lighten is to whosoever will let him come but there's some bad eggs in the world how many know we have some bad eggs so Topic in the world Amen the next one's going to be John 8:42 a John actually let's go first before we go to John 8 let's go to Matthew 13 Matthew 13 I think this one would be even better into describing why some eggs just don't seem to hatch it just doesn't have any effect on it Ain that right first of all we go back to the mystery back to the mystery of uh things that people just don't even believe it nowadays but it's true nonetheless all right 13 and 36 this is where Jesus had talked about the Harvest uh the swer the enemy that swed them and so forth the wheat and the tears Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came to him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears in the field amen he answered and said unto them he that soth The Good Seed is the son of man the field is the world and the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels amen as therefore the tears are gathered and burned into fire so shall it be at the end of this world now this is a scary thing almost for people that don't know God isn't it cuz you know remember one time two people were in brother braham's meetings and brother Bram preached on a buzzard and he preached on an eagle and is that right and one man after service says man he called me a buzzard well that's funny he called me an eagle how many Eagles have we got tonight amen it just depends on which side of the fence you're on just depends whether you're receptive to it or not amen whether you've come to the light to or not amen amen and not only that but it's clearly declares amen where the people amen uh are going to end up at the tears where they going to end up at the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall GA out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and nashing of teeth amen then shall the righteous shine forth as the son in the Kingdom of their father who have ears to hear let him hear now we go back to John 8 back to John 8 we want to look at this ineffectiveness of the atmosphere and the word of God to people amen how many's glad that the word of God has had an effect on you it has an effect on you every time you come to church every time you hear amen John 8 we'll begin with verse 42 it says it this way verse 42 it says and and then now he he they were talking about where the children of Abraham and all this all the stuff he said but now they were looking they were trying to kill Jesus in verse 40 but now you seek to kill me a man that has told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham you do the Deeds of your father then said they to him we be not before for be we be not born of fornication we have one father even God M how many knows just because people are religious just because people believe that God is their father don't make it their father amen oh my we're going to find out just exactly why and who is amen a child of God and who is not a child of do God find out who is Quicken and who has a German in there and who don't have a ger in there now notice Jesus said unto him if God were your father you would love me how many believe that one thing if you're a child of God if you're Christian you're going to love Jesus you're going to love God Amen my sheep hear my voice another they will not follow boy we try to persuade people and encourage people and coax people in into it and sell people you know that all that don't work you just tell them the truth and if they're of God they'll hear it in that comforting brother Brandon B racked his brain he was ready to go off the field people just won't you hear me but he realized hey not all of them supposed to hear it not all of them were he had to come to that realization before he went berserk almost hello man the people just won't hear me I'll just go out and live in the woods huh come out when God wants me because all of that God had done and people were still it was just running off of people's back like water off of Duck's back amen if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word amen now this is what we're not folks how many knows that's what we're were not they could not hear his word if you're not of God you're not going to hear God's word no we don't believe that my church don't teach that we don't believe in miracles our church don't believe that you just told me that you're not of God W come on folks because if you are of God you will hear God's words amen even because you cannot hear my words whoa you are of your father the devil amen that's why you never hatched that's why you never come to it never come to life never burst forth why because you don't have the germ of God in there The Germ of God in there you come forth just as sure as the world because how many knows God's going to see to it that every one of his children comes forth first forth in new life amen now notice you're of your father the devil and the lusts of your father will ye do he was a murderer from the beginning Abode not into truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own and because truth ye believe me not how many knows brother baham says evidence of the Holy Ghost is receiving your word for your day the evidence of the Holy Ghost is whether you can accept that word or not I don't care if you're sensation tongues whatever you might want to see Faith to move mountains that ain't it it's about whether you can receive that word for your hour amen my which one of you convinces me of sin I say the truth why do you not believe me you can't get any pler than verse 47 he that is of God heareth God's words right Ye Ye therefore hear them not because you are not of God man you can try to hatch an unbeliever as much as you want happen amen can't do it doesn't matter how long you would try amen man praise the Lord that's right the Pharisees had nothing to Quicken they love Darkness rather than light they love what they are same way with all the ons were all the way back to Cain don't it amen all the way back to Cain the truth was presented to him and he did not hear it he did not want it amen next thing I want to talk about is a hotbed plant one thing we're not is a hotbed plant amen oh my praise the Lord listen like hot B plants brother says you know you take a plant out of a hot house and you have to baby it and it don't know the weather it doesn't know the sunshine and things it's been covered over and baby nobody knows better than Brother Brad over here he plants them things and they got sheltered they don't know what the sun is you got make sure they get water you got to water them you got to have all of those drain lines and them water lines everything make sure they get just right amen and and keep the pests off them and all of those things off of them oh my what a what a lesson listen to what he says oh my it's been covered over and baby that's what's the matter with too many so-called Christians they're hot hot house plants subject to every bug that comes along W think about it didn't B say those plants in Arizona out there and the Heat and all of those that are original plants out there amen for some reason you Ain they don't never have to be sprayed they never have to be baby they never have to be watered but yet they go through the ruggedness of though oh my they you ain't got to keep attitude off of them you ain't got to keep this off of them keep that off of [Music] them not a Christian you don't amen but a hot bed plant you have to do it amen or can we say a hybrid a hybrid plant amen hot bed hybrid plan have to be sprayed to keep the bugs off it have to be babied have to be given attention constantly having to be given attention and baby amen have to constantly minister to it so to speak have to give it this and have to give it that amen my and after God had done all that they were like these little these people today has to be baby on God don't want babies God wants men and women like old buddy robins's testimony he says Lord give me the backbone of a uh the size of a saw log and plenty of knowledge in the Gable end of my soul let me fight the devil as long as I got a tooth left then let me gum him till I die that's what we need courage Wishbone not Wishbone but backbone a real spirit filled heart filled with the Holy Ghost Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Jesus Christ Living in a life walking in the path of God keeping his Commandments claiming every promise as your own property amen how many knows brother B said many times you say well I don't believe that part of the Bible and I don't believe this that of the other let me tell you something if you got the holy ghost in your heart you can't say them things it'll keep you from saying that I didn't know nothing about the message or this that nothing at all but when I come to God I says I believe this and I believe every last bit of it huh I don't know why well yeah I do now why because that's G on the inside the Holy Ghost don't deny his own word right amen is if if anything man the god is the same yesterday today and forever the days of Miracles is not passed they happen every day amen oh my praise the Lord and listen to Jesus didn't come to minister but uh to be ministered to but to minister amen didn't says still people that always want to be served and everything given to that they don't never amount to much it's always the people that are remembered or the people that served others amen he wasn't sick he didn't have to be need he wasn't Jesus wasn't sick and I we thinking about amen that's the way that a church is how many knows a church is like a hospital for sick people the whole world sick out there and this is a hospital this is where you get your remedy W this is where you get your inoculation I mean there's another thing that the world doesn't do and they don't get inoculated they uninoculated still in their sins amen still in their sins but how many believes there's a cure there's a cure aren't you thankful for that oh let me go back step back for just a little bit why would you not want to be a Christian I wrote a few things down you know the chiefest of Sinners can be forgiven of all of his sins you didn't ask to come into this world but yet you was born in sin shape iniquity come the world speaking lies and you may have been like Paul he called himself the chief of Sinners a murderer how about David a murderer and you can be forgiven of murder no matter how bad you've been all can be forgiven why would would you want that kind of inoculate what wouldn't you want to be a Christian like brother B I just don't understand why anybody would not want to be a Christian amen you're made clean you're made righteous you have peace we've been given peace of mind you don't have to fear huh you don't have to worry about your future your future is secure and in your presence God has given you a guide to lead you and to guide you my what else oh my he's given you care he's given you his [Music] love why

nightmare of his whole life when he spoke against Jesus Christ he said when he come back for another I ain't even going to say what I said I don't he said you know and then uh I'm thinking of that other there's a country amen that had a had a u uh had a whole parade of the Devil with a pitchfork and Jesus you know a man looked like Jesus and they were stabbing him and everything else mocking Jesus publicly it wasn't two days later that whole city almost drowned many lost their lives many a thousands were displaced mudslides that City almost went under you don't mock God I thought you know if God does that if God brings a judgment on upon people that do it right there and then how much more do you know and think about how that God is watching everything you do amen and how that he will you benefit from your prayer in the morning your prayer and how you respect God and God respect you honor God and God will honor you God is real folks these boys found out the hard way there was a

give him what he needed it but he refused to take it nowadays they blame the doctor wouldn't they bunch of idiots yeah they take they blame the doctor nowadays just like they're blaming Israel for starting the war when they them Hamas came in and beheaded babies and whatnot all else bunch of animals and then they want to talk gets your goat don't it yes it does all of you that stick up for them you are just as bad as they are that's right you're a Hamas if you stick up for one you are one hello that's right I ain't afraid to stick up for Israel are you he that blesses Israel will be blessed he that curses Israel will be cursed amen amen all right we'll leave politics out for a minute is that okay but theoc how many all my the world they don't have peace they don't got what you got cuz they hav a taken what you have taken the believer he meant he has been inoculated and it makes you act funny brother says sometime when the who got inoculation up in the upper room they come

as a dog but I'm telling you the inside man he is feeling good he all is well all is well with a genuine believer because he's taking the inoculation W aren't you glad that you've drank that why message amen you've taken and you said God whatever you got for me give it to me I want it I got this weight I've got this shortcoming I've got this problem I've got that problem well I'll tell you what you come to the right place to get it fixed amen this is where it gets fixed at they man quit wandering around the mountain going to the promised land Amen Let me see here here we go there was a certain Minister said today I heard it he said on the broadcast he said when he come into the country he had all of these great sinus troubles and they were taking talking about an operation and they said they was going to do this to his to that and cut him and operate and take part of his sinus glands out which would sink his face in and so forth like that and he said he taken pills by the barrel looked like there was so many pills that he had to take but when he come to a good Christian doctor the doctor said let's forget the pills and let's forget the operation and let's build up the body so that we can resist the [Applause] SST how many know them well I've got this problem I've got that problem let tell oh I got to repent of this again I got to repent of that again I got to ask God forgiveness let's forget about all of that let's take care of the core problem let's get rid of the desire of it let's you fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and you won't have those symptoms anymore I like that am me a good spiritual symptom Let's Build It Up let's pray let's read our Bible let's fill with the Holy Ghost you won't have problem with lust and lying and cheating and stealing and everything else I like that yeah amen take care of the problem get a real Born Again experience oh what we need is some original stuff not this hbd hybrid plants hot bed plants amen have to be baby and sprayed I thought I told my wife I says you know it doesn't matter if everybody is against you as long as You' got the one that counts for you right how many believe that I thought that was such a revelation God it doesn't matter if the whole world's against you as long as God's for you not that's another one of those thing why wouldn't you want to be a Christian when everything's against the whole world's against you but if God's for you it doesn't matter what's against you got God on your side amen just like Moses when he went to Egypt Egypt all of Egypt was against him but God was with him me there was a thousand Philistines against Samson it didn't matter he had God on his side there's millions of devils against you but it don't matter you got God on your side you're a genuine Christian that's what it means that's the overview of a Christian that's why we ought to be happy like we are cuz you got God on your side don't oh don't not go with me still will I follow I have decided to follow Jesus there ain't no turning back for a real believer there ain't no turning back my Paul said do you know that he that turth back my soul don't have any pleasure in somebody that turns [Music] back amen praise the Lord you know you take an old Herford cow let's talk about the old Herford turn him out here in the pasture and turn their Longhorn out there that longhorn can make his own way because he's original breed but you take a a brangus and or a herfor that's a cross breed and a hybrid it's a better car to look at sure fattier healthy healthy healthier but you turn them out there and they can't make their way they'll die cuz they got to be babies that's what's the matter with the church today you got a better dress punch of Christians a bigger Church a better education a lot of theophany uh theology but they have to be babed all the time you have to look through their glasses if you're going to be seeing it all what we need is some Thoroughbred Christians I you need some thorough some Originals how many believe we living in an hour when God's original word came back amen and we got a original birth again we got real genuine Sons and Daughters of God you ain't got to Pat them you ain't got to Baby them everything can go wrong like Paul says we're persecuted but not forsaken we're forsaken but as long as he don't forsake us we're all right cast down all of this stuff that Paul's po to Paul it didn't matter he was a pure bread he could take the Heat and me those po plants they couldn't take to eat they pour it up probably but it don't matter real Christian he can take the heat oh my praise the Lord what's the matter with people that don't live as long as they used to we have to take a shot for this and a shot for that and spraying ourselves over with all kinds of medicine what does it do it gets us soft fat and flabby and no good huh oh my and we're allergic to everything that's what he said let me finish the Herford story listen notice my we need Thoroughbred Christians born under the blood of Jesus Christ and live amen that live not off of church thethy but they live off of the word of God Amen they're not a hotbed baby BL it listen it what we need is God's inoculation by the word of God man shall live daily by that type of food to build his soul into inoculation from spiritual diseases that's flowing and jumping around the country amen how many many believes that that's right what we need to be of have is a real genuine amen backbone the another thing another number four iten that we don't want to be as a bunch of jellyfish yall know brother talked about jellyfish right jellyfish soft no backbone wishy-washy amen tossed about with every wind tossed and so forth how many beli that Christian isn't tossed he doesn't fuss he doesn't f he don't worry about things why because he's angered you can slap him you can do him wrong that ain't going to change him you can say bad things about him don't change him don't move him amen that's what he is but on the other hand number four on the believer I've got wrote down Rocky got nothing on the believer I don't hardly remember much of it but I know Rocky he was the underdog wasn't he he was the underdog and he got beat up and he got beat up but he kept getting back up how many believes that a believer has some get up about him you might get knocked down and you might look like a bloody mess but I'm telling you going to get up you will not quit you're not a quitter a Believer a Christian is not a Believer I mean a quitter a jellyfish man they just Splat there's no backbone to them wishy-washy huh no stability about him m toss and so forth but I like what he said about Buddy Romans he says give me a backbone the size of a saw log let me fight the devil that's what I read about Paul he knew what a p us Oh my he had all kinds of battles that he had to fight all the distresses and all the persecutions and everything that he went through huh you talk about a rocky Paul was a rocky it was tough how many believes a Christian is tough he's rugged brother Ram says but yet he's as gentle and as Meek as a lamb the other thing about a Christian is he doesn't have to take a bath like a dove a Dove's cleanly this it cleans from the inside out huh cleans from the inside out and oil that comes forth a holy spirit that goes forth amen you stay on your prayer bone you're in the presence of God and it just cleans you from the inside out amen but rugged I thought rugged and tough Christians are that this is what I thought man a Christian is the most unique species that you'll ever find upon the face of the Earth there is nothing like it in the world nothing like it Buddha Muhammad huh all of these other gods can you imagine coming up here speak against Buddha Buddha just a dead man false prophet huh should I be careful what I say huh all of these others all of them wrong not not not not correct at all there's only one that was right and that's Jesus Christ amen if Buddha was God I'd have to worry about it I might get struck but you ain't got to worry about speaking against them right cuz you're not God right they're dead in the grave but you talk about God he hears you aren't you glad he listens to you when you're speaking to him I'm glad to have him on my side I'm glad to have him in here Danny how about right there right there are you glad to have him right there you thought I was going his be a pre gent a d right take it easy how many glad to have God in your heart my just to know that how many just you know when you don't just think that but you know it it does something to you you have the power that created everything you've got the power that created the whole universe right there huh me and brother Glenn and sister Sharon when down to the what is it called now W wonders yeah Center we all got to go we almost me and Glen decided hey we're going to pack up the church some Sunday morning

something to see my friends for every grain of sand upon the face of the Earth there's a thousand stars amen yeah for every can you imagine the Sahara Desert deserts in Africa every grain of sand there's a thousand stars and they said just lately that's when was it maybe back in 2016 I have my dates wrong maybe but they found a little area between two stars that they just begin to focus on

upon Galaxy not just the are but galaxies in between there it was just blow their wow huh yeah his wonders and shows in the sky his wonders are declared in the heavens and I thought wow and that's puny little people down here don't realize what we have when we have that Creator right here it's more important than anything else in the world my friend amen how many those the Gentile Jesus said the Gentiles seek after the thing don't have a short range Vision H remember the bicycle story boy he me he looked at the end you got to have a long everybody in the world has this short range vision and they'll cheat Li and steel just to have a little worldly gain and so forth but that's not you and I how many we as Christians we're astronauts we are pass the sound barrier past the hearing oh I heard this past your sight what you see or what you feel right what you feel I don't care how sick you are don't go by that feeling you go by the word of God if you got to swallow your puke like the prophet don't go by your feelings you go by the word of God how many believe that we got to be past all of this nonsense of childishness Amen way past the sound barrier Christians are astronauts everybody else is living down here and just looking right in front of them the police believer is looking oh my how are you with me on this I'm looking for a body change one of these mornings I'm looking to change from this Dimension to the other I'm looking and even heard other preachers talking about the greatest event everything that Jesus ever built everything for was for his people and for his b and when we go to meet him in the air it's the culmination of everything it's a great man all that he died for all that he built for all that he created for there is his people we're going to go be with him it's great EV laying ahead don't just look down here how many believe we got something to look forward to amen our future is bright amen praise the Lord Brother Braham talked about the Herford also he says you know he has branded how many knows that they he said they used to take him they used to Brand these ones after about a year and they got pretty big but they would throw them down amen and they would take that hot IR and they would fry him it would fry to their hide he made they might hurt they might Squall they might scream but he said after that they knew who they
