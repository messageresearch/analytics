[20:01] amen God bless you this morning richly
[20:03] amen Amen brother
[20:12] Troy children can be dismissed for
[20:14] Sunday school too and then if you'll
[20:16] just go in the Proverbs with
[20:19] me we're going to go to uh chapter 15
[20:22] and then we're going to start in verse
[20:23] 16 which we read verse 16 last week but
[20:25] it's a really good one we'll start there
[20:27] and finish
[20:30] that Proverbs chapter 15 starting in
[20:33] verse
[20:37] 16 better is a little with the fear of
[20:40] the Lord than great treasure and Trouble
[20:49] therewith wrathful Man stirreth up
[20:51] Strife but he that is slow to anger
[20:54] appeaseth
[20:57] strife
[21:02] wise son maketh a glad father but a
[21:04] foolish man despises the
[21:14] mother without counsel purposes are
[21:18] disappointed but in the multitude of
[21:20] counselors they are
[21:27] established
[21:30] the way of life is above to the
[21:33] wise that he may depart from Hell
[21:39] [Applause]
[21:43] beneath thoughts of the wicked are an
[21:45] Abomination to the Lord but the words of
[21:48] the pure are pleasant
[21:57] words heart of the righteous studieth to
[22:00] answer but the mouth of the wicked porth
[22:02] out evil
[22:03] things Lord is the
[22:08] wick light of the eyes rejoices the
[22:11] heart and a good report maketh bones
[22:21] fat he that refuseth instruction
[22:24] despises his own soul but he that
[22:26] heareth reproof GTH
[22:29] understanding fear of the Lord is the
[22:31] instruction of wisdom and before honor
[22:34] is
[22:35] humility God bless you may be seated
[22:37] brother
[22:50] Brian morning brothers and
[22:54] sisters a lot of good scriptures there
[22:56] in our Proverbs I was just thanking
[22:58] if it wasn't sacrifice of Jesus Christ
[23:01] this morning where talked about how the
[23:04] wickedness that's in people's mind
[23:06] oppresses the Lord it wouldn't be a
[23:08] pleasant place to be this morning if you
[23:10] didn't have that buffer for us this
[23:12] morning there uh if you would turn with
[23:14] me to
[23:16] um the
[23:18] 12th chapter of
[23:25] Mark I'll have to apologize I may a
[23:28] deposit on Friday and it's been over a
[23:30] month so some of you probably knew it
[23:32] been a while since I made a deposit but
[23:35] everything up to then I made on that
[23:38] deposit on
[23:39] Friday and uh as of right now this
[23:42] morning
[23:44] the everything's paid off you all know
[23:46] the church has been paid off for months
[23:48] so and the fuel's paid off the insurance
[23:51] is paid off and depending on how bad the
[23:54] winter is so we go into the new year
[23:56] with both the general fund F in the
[23:58] building fund having more than enough
[23:59] money for any emergencies but I
[24:03] was uh listening into some messages this
[24:07] morning
[24:09] and a thought came to me I I'll I'll
[24:12] I'll try not to read this whole chapter
[24:14] but I'm just going to read about the
[24:16] first 15 verses here in this chapter we
[24:19] all know this Parable pretty well this
[24:21] morning and this is what Jesus had to
[24:23] say and he began to speak unto them by
[24:26] Parable you know and brother bandam told
[24:29] you and the word tells us you have the
[24:30] ability now to know the mind of God all
[24:33] these Parables you know the revelation
[24:36] of and know the truth of this morning
[24:38] you should be raised in your hands and
[24:39] just grateful that God deemed you worthy
[24:42] to understand the word of God he goes on
[24:46] a certain man planted a Vineyard and
[24:48] said set a hedge about it and dig a
[24:51] place for the wine fed and built a tower
[24:54] and led it out to the husbandman and
[24:56] went into a far country we know we're
[24:58] talking about God himself and the
[25:00] children of Israel and this he's just
[25:03] talking to the Pharisees here and at
[25:05] that season he sent to the husband
[25:08] husbandman a servant that he might
[25:11] receive from the husbandman of the fruit
[25:14] of the vineyard so basically tenant
[25:17] Farmers cash rent type of farming he
[25:19] they went back the owner went back to
[25:21] get his money and and this is what they
[25:23] did they caught him and beat him and
[25:25] sent him away empty and then it goes on
[25:28] in the fourth verse and again he sent
[25:30] onto them another servant and at him
[25:33] they cast stones and wounded him at in
[25:35] the head and sent him away shamefully
[25:38] handled and then again he sent another
[25:41] him they killed and many others beaten
[25:43] some and killing some so this land owner
[25:46] here was a pretty fair guide compared to
[25:49] what most land owners in our day would
[25:51] do and having yet therefore one son he's
[25:54] well beloved he sent him also onto to
[25:57] them saying they will reverence my son
[26:01] but the husbandmen said among themselves
[26:03] this is the hair come let us kill him
[26:06] and The Inheritance shall be ours and
[26:08] they took him and killed him and cast
[26:10] him out of the vineyard what shall
[26:12] therefore the Lord of The Vineyard do he
[26:15] will come and destroy the husbandman and
[26:17] give away give the vineyard to others
[26:19] that's where we're at this morning and
[26:21] he goes on to say have you not read the
[26:23] scripture the stone which the builders
[26:25] rejected is become the head of the
[26:27] corner and this was the Lord's doing and
[26:30] it's marvelous in our eyes and you could
[26:32] go back to First Peter the 2 and third
[26:35] chapter where it talks about this but I
[26:37] was thinking something different this
[26:39] morning and then he's these are the
[26:41] Pharisees here this Parable he was
[26:43] actually you know and the Sadducees
[26:45] weren't as stupid as you thought we
[26:47] think they are or the Pharisees they
[26:49] they knew that Jesus was talking
[26:51] directly to him he was this and they
[26:54] understood this Pharisee what he's
[26:56] exactly was saying here and they sought
[26:58] let L hold him in fear but the fear of
[27:01] the people for they knew that he had
[27:03] spoken a parable against them they left
[27:06] him and went away they and it just goes
[27:09] continually it keeps going on talking
[27:12] about how they tried to uh tempt him and
[27:15] test him and through it all he was true
[27:18] to the word of God and
[27:22] then I I'll just read jumping into the
[27:26] 29th verse and
[27:28] the one one privately one of the F
[27:31] Sadducees asked him or one of the
[27:32] lawyers asked him privately what is the
[27:35] best first commandment of all and in the
[27:37] 29th verse says and Jesus answered him
[27:42] the first of all the Commandments is to
[27:44] hear here oh Lord Israel the Lord your
[27:47] God is one Lord and we know we have that
[27:49] Revelation this morning the very God Of
[27:52] Heaven and Earth speaks to you this
[27:53] morning through the word of God and his
[27:56] presence in your heart this morning amen
[27:58] and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[28:00] with all thy heart and with all thy soul
[28:02] and with all thy mind with all thy
[28:04] strength this is the first commandment
[28:07] and this is I mean this goes back to uh
[28:10] the the Epistles of John the first the
[28:13] and the second is like namely this Thou
[28:15] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there
[28:17] is none other commandment greater than
[28:19] these and this scribe answers to the
[28:21] Lord backs and the scrib said unto him
[28:24] well Master thou has said the truth and
[28:27] he's just preaching the word right back
[28:29] to Jesus this morning just like we're
[28:31] expected to do
[28:33] ourselves thou thou said the truth for
[28:35] there is one God and there is none other
[28:38] but he and to love him with all thy
[28:40] heart and with all thy understanding
[28:42] with all thy soul with all thy strength
[28:45] and to love his neighbor as himself is
[28:47] more than all the whole burnt offerings
[28:49] and sacrifice so all the money you can
[28:52] give all the sacrifices you could give
[28:55] are meaningless unless these scriptures
[28:57] are abiding them unless you do
[28:59] everything in your life out of love for
[29:02] people and love for the Lord it it
[29:04] really ain't doing you any
[29:06] good my thought I don't have I was about
[29:09] to say something I won't say it but uh I
[29:12] say it a lot I we all have our own
[29:14] things that's all right but I'm thinking
[29:17] this morning go if you go with me to the
[29:19] third Epistle of John it's a real short
[29:26] one
[29:33] I was also hearing on that message one
[29:35] of the messages this morning was talking
[29:37] about that man Mr Andrews who had a wife
[29:40] that you know he thought had an appendix
[29:43] and then he found out he had she had a
[29:44] blood clot and he was a total unbeliever
[29:47] and he said he didn't need a preacher
[29:49] the doctors would take care of his wife
[29:51] and you know how everything F fully
[29:54] Cycles around where he comes knocking at
[29:57] at the door crying wanting brother
[29:59] brandom to to pray for his wife it just
[30:02] struck me this morning that's where
[30:04] we're at this morning that's what the
[30:05] world is likeed out there they don't
[30:07] think they need God this morning they
[30:09] don't need anything they got good
[30:11] doctors they got good education they got
[30:13] good everything they don't need any
[30:15] faith they don't need to believe believe
[30:17] in a living God but what's funny is God
[30:20] has a tendency to Humble The Humble
[30:22] people when they think when you get
[30:24] where you think you're so high before
[30:26] you know it God's Got you down on your
[30:28] knees and sometimes it's even got you
[30:30] lower than your knees before you realize
[30:32] that everything that you have or
[30:34] everything you're ever going to do is by
[30:36] the grace of Jesus Christ this morning
[30:39] and I was just think I wrote a note to
[30:41] myself here but I'll I listened to this
[30:44] chapter several times but if I
[30:45] mispronounce some of these words you'll
[30:48] have to forgive me this is what John
[30:51] said the Elder onto the wellbeloved
[30:54] Gallas whom I love in the truth so he's
[30:56] talking to this I don't know if he's a
[30:58] deacon or a pastor or this just a
[31:00] believer so John's writing this epistle
[31:02] to Gallas beloved I wish above all
[31:05] things that thou mayest prosper and be
[31:08] in health even as thy Soul Prosper for I
[31:11] Rejoice greatly when the Brethren came
[31:14] and testified of the truth that is in
[31:16] thee even as thou wst in the truth I
[31:19] have no Greater Joy than to hear that my
[31:22] children walk in truth I'm assuming the
[31:25] Lord feels the same way about this
[31:27] morning beloved thou th Faithfully
[31:30] whatsoever thou doest to the Brethren
[31:32] and to The Strangers so both to the the
[31:35] church and to the unbeliever he's saying
[31:38] here which have borne the witness thy
[31:41] charity before the church whom thou
[31:43] bring forward on their Journey after a
[31:45] Godly SW Thou shalt do well because that
[31:49] for his name's sake thou went forth Tak
[31:52] nothing of the Gentiles
[31:55] so not want to receive anything for
[31:58] himself ought to receive such that we
[32:01] might Fellowship in the truth and then
[32:03] there's a negative here in at the end of
[32:05] this chapter I wrote onto the church but
[32:09] theopus who loveth to have the pr so I
[32:13] was saying it's already happening here
[32:14] that's 2,000 years ago Christ had only
[32:18] been off the scene for what 30 40 years
[32:20] and it's already starting and this is
[32:22] what he had preeminence among them that
[32:25] received us not wherefore if I come I
[32:27] remember his deeds which he doeth
[32:29] righten against us with malice words and
[32:32] not content therewith nether do he
[32:34] himself receive the Brethren and you
[32:38] this goes on a lot this morning
[32:40] forbidding them that would would and
[32:43] cast them out of the church so it was
[32:45] even happening 2,000 years ago beloved
[32:48] follow not that which is evil but that
[32:50] which is good he that doeth good is of
[32:53] God and that goes back to what I was
[32:55] reading in mark this morning you know if
[32:57] a man's being good you can tell by the
[32:59] treasures that come out of his heart
[33:01] whether he's evil or he's good not that
[33:03] we have the right to judge people but
[33:06] you can tell by their character by their
[33:08] attitude by the things they do and they
[33:09] don't do who they are and you'd be
[33:12] surprised sometimes the sinner out there
[33:14] can have more brotherly love than
[33:16] Christians can have it's the truth
[33:19] sometimes they'll help people more than
[33:20] Christians to help people Brethren
[33:23] forbid of them that would cast them out
[33:25] of the church follow not that which is
[33:28] evil but which is good he that good
[33:30] doeth good is of God and he that doeth
[33:33] evil have not seen God and I'm just
[33:35] thinking of what brother brandham said
[33:37] here you know he you have a lot of
[33:39] preachers out there would tell you if
[33:41] you if you're going to live like a
[33:42] sinner you might want to live to the
[33:44] best you can but always here brother Ram
[33:46] saying always encouraging whether
[33:48] they're Sinners or Saint to live the
[33:50] cleanest and best life they know how to
[33:52] live and uh I my pronunciation D this

[1:05:37] Earth adore him Jesus is the God we
[1:05:45] serve aren't you thankful to serve a
[1:05:47] great big God this morning amen good to
[1:05:51] be in the house of the Lord thankful for
[1:05:52] your prayers and certain could feel them
[1:05:54] and I'm I'm kind of in the same boat
[1:05:56] with Brother David I've just felt just a
[1:05:58] real presence of the Lord for the last
[1:05:59] day or two or leading up into studying
[1:06:02] and and uh I just think if we could take
[1:06:04] our time this morning God's got
[1:06:06] something in store good for us and so uh
[1:06:10] we just Thanksgiving coming up and I
[1:06:12] just want to say I'm thankful for the
[1:06:14] blood I'm thankful for the blood this
[1:06:17] morning and and I want to speak this
[1:06:19] morning if I could on Blood Bought
[1:06:22] rewards Blood Bought rewards and uh if
[1:06:25] you want to turn in your Bibles we'll
[1:06:27] turn in the Book of Romans read a
[1:06:29] portion of scripture there Romans
[1:06:35] 8 thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:38] and all that it does for
[1:06:43] us read you a quote real quick as you're
[1:06:47] turning Prophet says his first decision
[1:06:50] when man sinned and crossed that great
[1:06:53] chasm between him and God leaving
[1:06:56] himself no way back God full of mercy
[1:07:00] and Grace accepted a substitute Only a
[1:07:04] God that is full of mercy and Grace
[1:07:06] could do a thing like that and he
[1:07:08] accepted a substitute and that
[1:07:10] substitute was
[1:07:12] blood that's the only place that man
[1:07:15] could ever come in fellowship with God
[1:07:17] again is under the shed blood he said
[1:07:21] and it's never been any time that a man
[1:07:24] could fellowship with God but only by
[1:07:26] the blood and it is so true where he
[1:07:30] fellowships with
[1:07:33] God Book of Romans chapter 8 very
[1:07:36] familiar scripture as we're talking
[1:07:39] about the blood and and a chasms and
[1:07:41] things that that that draw I guess a
[1:07:45] separation sometimes between us and
[1:07:47] Christ and things that get in our lives
[1:07:49] and maybe can hinder us and hold us back
[1:07:51] and that we hold on to sometimes at
[1:07:53] creates a distance it feels like but
[1:07:56] there's always that blood and that blood
[1:07:59] never
[1:08:00] fails and looking here in Romans it says
[1:08:03] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:08:05] Christ shall tribulation or distress or
[1:08:08] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:08:11] Peril or sword as it is written for thy
[1:08:14] sake we are killed all the day long we
[1:08:17] are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[1:08:19] nay in all these things we are more than
[1:08:22] conquerors through him that love loved
[1:08:24] us for I am persuaded that neither death
[1:08:28] I think this is one of brother B's
[1:08:29] favorite
[1:08:30] scriptures that neither death nor life
[1:08:34] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:08:37] nor things present nor things to come
[1:08:39] nor height nor depth or any other
[1:08:41] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:08:44] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:08:47] Jesus our lord you see we may have
[1:08:50] chasms in our lives and and and and but
[1:08:53] the thing to know that there is no Chasm
[1:08:54] that is that is too big it is too deep
[1:08:57] that is too wide no mountains Too Tall
[1:09:00] if we can put everything that hinders us
[1:09:02] or that holds us back if we can put it
[1:09:04] under the blood of Jesus
[1:09:06] Christ let's pray Heavenly Father we
[1:09:10] thank you for this day for many
[1:09:11] blessings thank you for your grace and
[1:09:12] mercy and thankful today as we're coming
[1:09:15] in this Thanksgiving season we're
[1:09:17] thankful to be Americans we're thankful
[1:09:20] for for the the freedoms that we have
[1:09:22] and the liberties we have and but Lord
[1:09:25] more than anything we're thankful for
[1:09:27] the blood of Jesus Christ that covers
[1:09:29] our sins and and puts them into the sea
[1:09:31] of your forgetfulness I just read where
[1:09:34] the Prophet said you know he get Black
[1:09:35] Ink on his shirt and his his mama would
[1:09:38] take some coal oil and try to smear it
[1:09:40] around and and it would just make a big
[1:09:42] old blood but it wasn't until they come
[1:09:44] out with Clorox bleach and she could dip
[1:09:46] it in that bleach as just as the blood
[1:09:49] of Jesus Christ and it could never be
[1:09:51] found again we're thankful for that this
[1:09:54] morning we love you and dedicate this
[1:09:56] service into your hands now in Jesus
[1:09:58] name we pray amen you can have your
[1:10:01] seats I'm going to try to take my time
[1:10:04] and uh and and and we're going to have a
[1:10:06] little different this morning it's going
[1:10:07] to be some history involved and some
[1:10:09] history lessons but I think if you'll
[1:10:11] stay with me you'll see where we're
[1:10:12] going to go I'm also going to be reading
[1:10:14] quite lengthy out of uh exod Exodus 12
[1:10:17] if you want to follow along and and
[1:10:19] looking at uh at this here for just a
[1:10:22] few minutes before we get into our text
[1:10:24] this will lay our
[1:10:25] foundation Exodus 12 and the Lord spake
[1:10:29] unto Moses and Aaron in the land of
[1:10:31] Egypt saying this month shall be unto
[1:10:34] you the beginning of months and it the
[1:10:37] first month of the year to you speak ye
[1:10:39] unto all the congregation of Israel
[1:10:41] saying in the 10th day of this month
[1:10:44] they shall take unto them every man a
[1:10:48] lamb every man a lamb oh the Lamb of God
[1:10:53] according to to the house of their
[1:10:54] fathers a lamb for a house and if a
[1:10:56] house oh be too little for the lamb let
[1:10:58] him and his neighbor next to his house
[1:11:01] take it according to the number of souls
[1:11:03] every man according to his eating shall
[1:11:06] make count for the lamb watch now this
[1:11:09] lamb your lamb shall be without blemish
[1:11:12] yeah that's nothing we can live up to
[1:11:15] that's nothing we as as men or as
[1:11:17] Christians as Believers we can't live up
[1:11:19] to a to a an unblemished life but here
[1:11:23] it says your lamb shall be without
[1:11:26] blemish a male of the first year you
[1:11:28] shall take it out from the sheep or from
[1:11:30] the goats and you shall keep it until
[1:11:32] the 14th day of the same month and the
[1:11:34] whole assembly of the congregation of
[1:11:36] Israel shall kill it in the evening and
[1:11:39] they shall take of the
[1:11:43] blood and strike it on the two side
[1:11:46] posts and on the upper doorpost of the
[1:11:48] houses wherein they shall eat and they
[1:11:51] shall eat the Flesh in that night roast
[1:11:53] with fire and unleavened bread and with
[1:11:56] bitter herbs they shall eat eat not of
[1:11:58] it raw nor Soden with all the with with
[1:12:02] all with water but roast with fire his
[1:12:04] head with his legs
[1:12:07] and thereof and ye shall let nothing of
[1:12:10] it remain until the morning that which
[1:12:11] remaineth of it until the morning you
[1:12:13] shall burn with
[1:12:15] fire and thus you shall eat it and G
[1:12:18] about your loins your shoes on your feet
[1:12:21] and your staff in your hand you shall
[1:12:22] eat and haast East it is the Lord's
[1:12:25] Passover for I will pass through the
[1:12:28] land of Egypt this night and will Smite
[1:12:30] all the firstborn in the land of Egypt
[1:12:32] both man and Beast and against all the
[1:12:35] gods of Egypt I will execute
[1:12:39] judgment I am the Lord and the blood
[1:12:43] shall be for you a token aren't you
[1:12:47] thankful this morning for the token
[1:12:49] aren't you thankful this morning for the
[1:12:51] blood that that that is is token over
[1:12:53] our lives saying that that we have been
[1:12:56] Blood Bought and we can receive the
[1:12:58] rewards of a Blood Bought Savior Jesus
[1:13:06] Christ and when I see the BL blood I
[1:13:10] will pass over you and the plague shall
[1:13:13] not be upon you to destroy you when I
[1:13:15] smite the land of Egypt and this day be
[1:13:17] unto you for a memorial skip down to
[1:13:20] verse 21 if you'd like then MO Moes
[1:13:23] called for the Elders of Israel and said
[1:13:25] unto them draw out and take you a lamb
[1:13:27] according to your
[1:13:29] families and kill for the Passover and
[1:13:32] you shall take a bunch of hisp and we
[1:13:35] look at this this herb this hsip is and
[1:13:37] there's significance there and and that
[1:13:39] the hsip is used for sprinkling and
[1:13:41] ancient Jewish rights of
[1:13:43] purification so when by taking the
[1:13:45] they're saying we need God to purify Our
[1:13:48] Lives we need something to clean us we
[1:13:51] need something to to help us to forgive
[1:13:53] us that's why David when you look in
[1:13:55] Psalms David was caught in the act of
[1:13:57] adultery with bath Sheba what did he say
[1:14:00] he said cleanse me with
[1:14:03] hup cleanse me with hup and basically
[1:14:06] he's saying cleanse me with hup cleanse
[1:14:08] me with the blood and I shall be clean
[1:14:10] and that's the only way why because this
[1:14:12] hipip signifies purification and it says
[1:14:16] and dip it in the blood that is in the
[1:14:18] Basin and strike the lenol with the two
[1:14:20] side posts with the blood that is in the
[1:14:22] basin and none of you shall go out at
[1:14:25] the door of his house until the morning
[1:14:28] for the Lord will pass through
[1:14:30] to Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth
[1:14:34] the blood on the lentil and on the side
[1:14:36] poost the Lord will pass over the door
[1:14:39] and will not suffer the
[1:14:41] Destroyer did you hear that the
[1:14:44] Destroyer he will not suffer the
[1:14:46] Destroyer to come into your house and
[1:14:48] smites you there's something about that
[1:14:49] blood when that blood token is over your
[1:14:52] life that that there is no more chance
[1:14:55] and no more of ability for the Destroyer
[1:14:57] to come into your house because there's
[1:15:01] blood there and when that Destroyer sees
[1:15:03] the blood he says I can't come in here I
[1:15:06] can't dwell in this house because
[1:15:08] something special has taken
[1:15:14] place and you shall observe this thing
[1:15:16] for an ordinance to thee and to thy Sons
[1:15:20] forever and it shall come to pass when
[1:15:21] ye come to the land where the the Lord
[1:15:23] shall give you according as he has
[1:15:25] promised that you'll keep this
[1:15:28] service and it shall come to pass when
[1:15:31] your children shall say unto you what
[1:15:33] mean ye by this service you will say it
[1:15:36] is the sacrifice of the Lord's
[1:15:39] Passover who passed over the houses of
[1:15:42] the children of Israel here's a token
[1:15:45] that he's that he's leaving a legacy of
[1:15:48] what happened in Egypt he's leaving this
[1:15:51] this token as a legacy of what what
[1:15:53] happens tell your children tell your
[1:15:54] grandchildren tell them if they can just
[1:15:57] apply the blood in their
[1:15:59] lives that the Destroyer can't come near
[1:16:03] and he says keep it in your mind and the
[1:16:05] people bowed their head and worshiped
[1:16:07] and the children of Israel went away and
[1:16:09] did as the Lord had commanded Moses and
[1:16:11] Aaron and it came to pass at the
[1:16:14] midnight the Lord smokee all the
[1:16:17] firstborn in the land of Egypt from the
[1:16:20] firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his
[1:16:22] throne to the firstborn of the captive
[1:16:26] that was in the dungeon and all the
[1:16:27] firstborn of the
[1:16:30] cattle judgment is
[1:16:33] tough if we live our lives outside of
[1:16:35] the blood judgment is
[1:16:38] tough and Pharaoh rose up in the night
[1:16:42] and he and his servants and all the
[1:16:43] Egyptians and there was a great cry in
[1:16:46] Egypt brothers and sisters can you
[1:16:48] imagine the
[1:16:49] Wailing and the cries and the groaning
[1:16:53] and the agony of every household in
[1:16:56] Egypt every single household stepping
[1:16:59] out and crying for their firstborn son
[1:17:01] who had been lost to the death
[1:17:06] angel for there was not a house look now
[1:17:10] that there was there was nobody outside
[1:17:12] of the blood that got saved if you
[1:17:14] didn't have the blood God didn't spare
[1:17:16] you because it says there was not a
[1:17:19] house there was that there was not one
[1:17:21] dead and every single household in Egypt
[1:17:25] suffered that's right so here we see
[1:17:28] that God he was he was going to set his
[1:17:31] people uh free from being slaves into
[1:17:34] the land of Egypt and so he sends Moses
[1:17:36] and Aaron to speak to
[1:17:39] pharaoh and and and they demanded that
[1:17:41] all of God's people be set free to
[1:17:44] worship God they demanded it and they
[1:17:47] told him said we want to be set free but
[1:17:49] each time what did Pharaoh say no
[1:17:54] no get out of my presence no and so God
[1:17:58] begins to send plagues upon the land of
[1:18:01] Egypt and God begins to send these
[1:18:03] plagues to show the people that they
[1:18:05] they should worship the Creator and not
[1:18:07] the creation because Egyptians were big
[1:18:10] into Worship in the creation Sun and the
[1:18:13] Moon and and the the animals and the
[1:18:15] Beast and they had all these different
[1:18:17] gods and images they worship but God is
[1:18:19] telling them don't worship he's trying
[1:18:21] to spam he says don't worship worship
[1:18:23] the creation but worship me the
[1:18:26] Creator and God was teaching the
[1:18:29] Israelites and the Egyptian that he
[1:18:32] alone is God guess why we go back into
[1:18:35] John 14:6 and Jesus says I am the what
[1:18:38] I'm the way I'm the truth and I am the
[1:18:40] life and no man shall come unto the
[1:18:42] father except through me and that's what
[1:18:45] God was trying to tell them these
[1:18:47] plagues are to show you that I am God
[1:18:50] and you have no control in your
[1:18:52] situation
[1:18:55] so he turned watch these plagues so he
[1:18:58] turns the Nile River into
[1:19:01] blood he comes down he fills the land
[1:19:03] with frogs can you imagine mounds of
[1:19:05] frogs in and out of your house
[1:19:07] everywhere you step you're stepping on
[1:19:09] croaking
[1:19:10] frogs in and out of your house he sends
[1:19:13] gnats oh there ain't nothing that annoys
[1:19:15] me more than a
[1:19:16] natat maybe ticks but then mats you know
[1:19:18] you get that certain time of the year
[1:19:20] when you got fruit or you got apples or
[1:19:22] something there Nats you can't get rid
[1:19:24] of them gats can you imagine your whole
[1:19:26] house swarming with
[1:19:30] gats flies swarming over the people can
[1:19:34] you imagine
[1:19:37] constant and you're fighting these flies
[1:19:40] constant and these plagues keep going
[1:19:42] and going and going disease on your
[1:19:45] animals diseases on the people balls
[1:19:48] break out all over their skin and
[1:19:51] blisters no I won't let him
[1:19:55] go no I won't let him
[1:19:58] go the worst storm to ever hit Egypt
[1:20:01] passes
[1:20:03] through Locust filled the sky so that
[1:20:06] the skies looked
[1:20:10] black these are some pretty pretty big
[1:20:12] plagues
[1:20:13] right there was Darkness for three
[1:20:17] complete days what must have been going
[1:20:19] through their minds when you wake up and
[1:20:22] there's no
[1:20:24] Sunrise yeah you go to bed you wake up
[1:20:27] and there's no
[1:20:28] Sunrise you go to bed and you wake up
[1:20:31] and there's no Sunrise for three days
[1:20:34] straight Darkness across the land of
[1:20:36] Egypt and in all these plagues God was
[1:20:39] trying to give the people the
[1:20:41] opportunity to listen to him he was
[1:20:43] trying to give the people an opportunity
[1:20:45] to trust him and believe in him but as
[1:20:48] he begins and but after this plague of
[1:20:50] Darkness Pharaoh gets fed up with it and
[1:20:53] he tells Moses get out of my sight do
[1:20:55] not come and see me again for the day
[1:20:57] you do is the day you
[1:20:59] die
[1:21:03] yeah that's a bold
[1:21:05] statement when you just went through
[1:21:07] nine
[1:21:09] plagues nine plagues that change the way
[1:21:12] you live day after day after
[1:21:16] day but here we see this this 10th
[1:21:20] plague we watch this 10th plague in this
[1:21:22] 10th plague it it attacks the very heart
[1:21:24] of Egyptian
[1:21:26] faith it comes into the very very life
[1:21:30] of Egypt because Egypt they they think
[1:21:32] it's life themsel and Egyptians were
[1:21:35] obsessed with life and they wanted to
[1:21:37] keep keep the good life as long as they
[1:21:39] could keep life in Egypt intact they
[1:21:42] were ready for the next world that's why
[1:21:44] they built tombs and and and and rituals
[1:21:47] it was and and they would put all these
[1:21:48] different herbs and spices and Honeys
[1:21:50] and and they were getting prepared for
[1:21:52] the next life because they were going to
[1:21:54] step from this life into another life so
[1:21:58] life is something that they treasured in
[1:22:03] Egypt they had a lot of
[1:22:05] gods that were just
[1:22:08] Representatives
[1:22:09] yeah they didn't serve a true
[1:22:13] God but they served
[1:22:15] life in this
[1:22:18] life they could tell themselves if if we
[1:22:20] could just make it to the afterlife
[1:22:22] we're going to survive and we're going
[1:22:24] to be a
[1:22:26] continuation and we know and and we look
[1:22:28] at life itself we know life symbolized
[1:22:31] in the first born
[1:22:33] right when we have our when we get
[1:22:35] married we begin our families and you
[1:22:37] have your first born you continuing on
[1:22:39] your name life continues
[1:22:42] right life continues and so here this
[1:22:45] this is this first
[1:22:47] born it hits him
[1:22:50] hard when this Ang angel passes through
[1:22:53] the land of
[1:22:55] Egypt and passes
[1:22:58] judgment a whole entire nation is
[1:23:02] brought to his
[1:23:05] knees a whole entire nation is brought
[1:23:08] with his knees to his knees because it
[1:23:11] was God's way of saying you treasure
[1:23:13] life but I want you to know that I am
[1:23:16] the way I am the truth and I am the life
[1:23:21] the life that you treasure you would not
[1:23:23] have without me the life that you live
[1:23:26] the Glorious life you live and the
[1:23:28] things you have you would not have if
[1:23:30] not for me and he puts This Nation on
[1:23:34] their knees and he begins to down there
[1:23:37] and and after this happens they're on
[1:23:39] their knees and you say well they
[1:23:42] permitted Israel to leave no They begged
[1:23:45] Israel to
[1:23:46] leave They begged Israel to leave why
[1:23:50] was that because God proved him self in
[1:23:53] action and he proved himself in such a
[1:23:56] way that with this 10th plague that this
[1:23:59] 10 10th plague was was not only
[1:24:01] significant but it prompted the
[1:24:03] Egyptians to let the Israelites go
[1:24:05] because it revealed the spiritual nature
[1:24:08] of
[1:24:10] Salvation stay with me now it revealed
[1:24:13] what
[1:24:14] salv was the pass over and and the the
[1:24:19] consecration of the firstborn and look
[1:24:23] at this we begin to look at this and and
[1:24:25] and this both recognition of the real
[1:24:29] enemy of Israel and the Hebrew race is
[1:24:33] death and that it has to be
[1:24:37] conquered let me say this a different
[1:24:39] way God although he was judging Egypt he
[1:24:43] also let it be known to the children of
[1:24:46] Israel that death has to be conquered
[1:24:51] yeah
[1:24:55] brothers and sisters you you got a lot
[1:24:58] to be thankful for this morning we got a
[1:25:01] lot to be thankful for this morning
[1:25:03] because there was a death a burial and a
[1:25:06] resurrection that Jesus Christ became
[1:25:09] and conquered the death hell and the
[1:25:12] grave for you and I so we have to be
[1:25:14] thankful for because brother BR this way
[1:25:16] he says Christians do not
[1:25:19] die Christians do not die there's no
[1:25:21] scripture the Bible that says that
[1:25:23] Christians die he says no he says a
[1:25:26] person that lives in pleasure is
[1:25:28] dead they live in pleasure they're dead
[1:25:30] while they're living but death means
[1:25:33] separation and a separation from
[1:25:37] God he said so Christians never separate
[1:25:42] from God he said they just leave this
[1:25:46] body here to be with the
[1:25:49] Lord so death is not something to fear
[1:25:52] that's
[1:25:54] right but a not of us want to be
[1:25:56] separated from
[1:25:58] God remember we're talking about chasms
[1:26:01] we're talking about blood we're talking
[1:26:02] about things that separate us things
[1:26:03] that can draw distance between us and
[1:26:06] God and looking at this this nature of
[1:26:08] the 10th plague it was different than
[1:26:10] the other
[1:26:12] nine you say why was it so different
[1:26:15] well with the other nine uh they could
[1:26:18] just sit back and watch what was
[1:26:20] happening the children of Israel could
[1:26:21] just sit back and say man God is really
[1:26:23] putting it on
[1:26:24] Egypt God is really putting it on Egypt
[1:26:27] he's really bringing the heat down on
[1:26:29] them I wonder how they're going to
[1:26:30] squirm today I wonder when these frogs
[1:26:33] come watch them squirm watch them watch
[1:26:35] them as they squeal and these women
[1:26:37] don't like these frogs and these flies
[1:26:39] and these nets watch them squirm but now
[1:26:43] God says there's something that you got
[1:26:45] to do
[1:26:47] Israel there's an action that you've got
[1:26:49] to do there's something that's got to
[1:26:51] take place in your life children of
[1:26:56] God so you mean to tell me we can't just
[1:26:59] sit back and watch the Judgment of God
[1:27:01] on people and say oh here we
[1:27:04] are there's things in your life we got
[1:27:06] to apply the blood to there's things in
[1:27:09] my life that I have to apply the blood
[1:27:10] to you say well you saying I'm not a
[1:27:12] Christian I'm not saying you're not a
[1:27:13] Christian I'm saying you may have things
[1:27:15] in your life you need to apply the blood
[1:27:16] to you need to plunge underneath the
[1:27:18] blood of Jesus
[1:27:21] Christ amen yes so this was not merely a
[1:27:25] curse on the
[1:27:27] oppressors but and the oppressed as
[1:27:36] well you see anything in your life
[1:27:38] shortcomings failures something that's
[1:27:40] hindering you something that's taking
[1:27:42] your Victory away yeah all of those
[1:27:44] things need to be plunged under the
[1:27:46] blood I want to live a Victorious life I
[1:27:49] want every day that I wake up to say
[1:27:51] today is a Victor life how can I be
[1:27:53] victorious Jesus
[1:27:56] Christ when hardships come my way When
[1:27:58] Trials come my way Jesus Christ
[1:28:01] everything I do from the moment I wake
[1:28:04] up to the moment I get go to bed has to
[1:28:07] be through the blood of Jesus Christ if
[1:28:09] not I'm separated from
[1:28:14] God if you're not living a life that's
[1:28:16] that that is living underneath the blood
[1:28:18] of Jesus Christ on a day-to-day basis
[1:28:20] you're separated yourself from
[1:28:27] God so the Passover teaches that the
[1:28:30] real enemy is death okay and Jesus talks
[1:28:33] about it in Luke and he he begins to
[1:28:35] look at this Passover and he begins to
[1:28:37] talk about at the Last Supper and he
[1:28:39] refers the symbolism to himself and what
[1:28:42] he's going to do for the world the next
[1:28:43] day in Luke chapter 14 or Luke chapter
[1:28:46] 22 I'm sorry Luke chapter 22 and all of
[1:28:50] all of the plagues that God sent into
[1:28:52] Egypt this was by far the
[1:28:55] worst remember every animal firstborn
[1:28:58] male every child firstborn male gone and
[1:29:04] the Bible talks about the loud cry that
[1:29:06] goes all over
[1:29:09] Egypt what a sad
[1:29:12] situation you know sins and shortcomings
[1:29:15] and and
[1:29:16] hindrances they spoil them they spoil
[1:29:18] the party don't
[1:29:20] they man you can be living so good and
[1:29:23] your life can be going so so good and
[1:29:25] you're right there walking day to day to
[1:29:27] day with God and you feel like
[1:29:28] everything's good and then one little
[1:29:30] thing will pop up and you make a mistake
[1:29:32] and this boils the whole
[1:29:36] atmosphere well the rest of you angels
[1:29:38] can let me let me know how y'all handle
[1:29:39] it after after the service
[1:29:42] today but it spoils the atmosphere that
[1:29:45] we have created around us because the
[1:29:47] prophet tells us we created an
[1:29:48] atmosphere and when we're filled with
[1:29:50] the Holy Ghost it is a God ly atmosphere
[1:29:53] but when things don't go right it spoils
[1:29:55] that
[1:29:57] atmosphere but remember now God had
[1:30:00] given opportunity after opportunity for
[1:30:01] them to put trust in him but what did
[1:30:03] they do they
[1:30:04] refused and I wonder sometimes how many
[1:30:07] of us God gives us opportunity after
[1:30:11] opportunity after
[1:30:13] opportunity to overcome fears anxieties
[1:30:18] stresses
[1:30:20] hindrances
[1:30:22] disease and we
[1:30:30] refuse we're not living in a day we
[1:30:33] should be refusing
[1:30:34] God God is doing amazing things in the
[1:30:38] this last day we're living in amazing
[1:30:41] things are taking place Miracles are
[1:30:43] taking place I hear other ministers I
[1:30:45] hear other things going on where people
[1:30:47] have been healed people's been
[1:30:48] delivered and it's happening here people
[1:30:51] are being healed and people have been
[1:30:52] delivered you say well I don't see it I
[1:30:54] you're not the one living it let me tell
[1:30:56] you when you don't feel good and you
[1:30:57] pray to God and you feel better the next
[1:30:59] day God is
[1:31:01] [Applause]
[1:31:03] moving it's not the doctors it's not the
[1:31:06] medicine it's the bomb of Gil it's the
[1:31:09] blood of Jesus Christ that flows down
[1:31:11] Calvary that's giving you the healing
[1:31:13] that's giving you the overcoming
[1:31:14] [Applause]
[1:31:15] power it's God's blood that tells you I
[1:31:19] can make it it's the devil that tells
[1:31:20] you you can't
[1:31:28] God gives Moses important
[1:31:33] instructions I'd say we've been given
[1:31:35] some pretty important instructions in
[1:31:36] our last
[1:31:38] day and brother Brown tells the story he
[1:31:41] begins to tell the story of that he said
[1:31:44] the first thing you know they can they
[1:31:45] heard a a p and a roar coming through
[1:31:48] the
[1:31:50] land
[1:31:53] oh can you imagine he said they heard
[1:31:57] that uh that hum and that war he said
[1:32:00] can see the that old Priestly father
[1:32:01] walking up and down the floor this 10th
[1:32:04] plague was different this 10th plague
[1:32:06] was an attention getter this 10th plague
[1:32:09] is life or death and he said that
[1:32:11] Priestly father was pacing and walking
[1:32:13] up and down the floor just as sturdy as
[1:32:15] he could be and he said I could hear
[1:32:16] that little boy say

[1:33:02] wind and there there's times in our
[1:33:04] lives when the wind begins to how and he
[1:33:06] says Daddy what is that wind he said
[1:33:08] that's just the Judgment of
[1:33:13] God before they sat back and watched
[1:33:16] today they're living
[1:33:17] it that's right there was a time when we
[1:33:20] might have sat back and watch but today
[1:33:23] brothers and sisters we're living it
[1:33:26] we're living in a late hour we're living
[1:33:28] in an hour when you will see God and
[1:33:31] you'll see God's judgment upon this
[1:33:33] Earth and that's when we're getting
[1:33:34] ready to leave this place when the winds

[1:35:54] Christ that lives in my home and in my
[1:35:56] life and in my family it will cover and
[1:35:59] take care of a multitude of
[1:36:02] sin there will be no death and no
[1:36:04] separation for
[1:36:11] me and the angel slips down to the door
[1:36:13] and spreads his wings over I see the
[1:36:15] blood and it takes
[1:36:17] flight it's seen the blood
[1:36:24] it's seen the blood boy time is
[1:36:31] rolling
[1:36:33] Abraham when Abraham was
[1:36:36] old he had to believe on God and Abraham
[1:36:40] and had to believe on God and God told
[1:36:43] him he said you need to go up there I
[1:36:45] want you to take your son Isaac and I
[1:36:48] want you to take your son Isaac
[1:36:51] and go and make a
[1:36:56] sacrifice and he said he looked down
[1:36:58] there and he told his people he said the
[1:37:00] lad and I shall return how I don't
[1:37:04] know because I'm going up to kill
[1:37:08] him hey that's a bold statement right
[1:37:10] there think
[1:37:12] about your
[1:37:16] child and Abraham says I don't know how
[1:37:19] we'll return but we'll return
[1:37:23] someway we'll be back and he sticks the
[1:37:25] knife in his
[1:37:26] belt and he said he stuck the knife in
[1:37:29] his belt and he laid the wood on Isaac's
[1:37:30] shoulders and Isaac begins to go up the
[1:37:32] hill being led by Abraham a beautiful
[1:37:35] type his son taking him up to the hill
[1:37:38] to the very altar where he would be laid
[1:37:39] on and he's packing it up the hill on
[1:37:41] his back just like God sending his son
[1:37:43] to galtha with a wooden cross on his
[1:37:50] back and he said that God spared not his
[1:37:53] own
[1:37:56] son and here's little
[1:37:59] Isaac one place I said I think the
[1:38:02] prophet said he was around 14 other
[1:38:03] place maybe a little younger at
[1:38:05] times but just imagine a 14y old who do
[1:38:08] we have as near 14 in here somebody
[1:38:10] raise your hand I know we got some
[1:38:11] somebody raise your hand 14 we got a 14y
[1:38:13] old right here how would you feel if
[1:38:16] your daddy's taking you up to the top of
[1:38:17] a mountain with a pile of wood on your
[1:38:19] back and he's got a knife in his belt
[1:38:24] because Isaac knew there had to be some
[1:38:26] some blood shed he knew enough about
[1:38:29] sacrifices that he knew some something's
[1:38:31] got to die on this
[1:38:33] Altar and here they go up into this
[1:38:36] mountain and he he knows that
[1:38:37] something's got to happen to complete
[1:38:39] this sacrifice and he's looking there
[1:38:41] and he says little Isaac said father
[1:38:44] here's the Altar and here's the fire and
[1:38:46] you got a knif but where's the
[1:38:48] sacrifice where is the sacrifice said
[1:38:51] and and Abraham looked at him and said
[1:38:53] God will provide a
[1:39:01] sacrifice and he said as he started he
[1:39:04] said he bound his son he throwed him up
[1:39:06] on the altar he pulled that knife out
[1:39:09] and he said God you gave it to
[1:39:12] me and he said he raised it up and
[1:39:15] started to pull that knife down and the
[1:39:16] angel grabbed his
[1:39:18] [Applause]
[1:39:20] hand
[1:39:22] there's something about when you need
[1:39:24] blood there's something about when
[1:39:26] there's blood needed in your life to
[1:39:28] cover something the angel of God comes
[1:39:30] and stops his hand and he says don't you
[1:39:33] touch that child Abraham I can see that
[1:39:36] you're faithful I'm going to give you
[1:39:38] the blood you love me you serve me you
[1:39:40] live for me you do everything for me and
[1:39:43] so now I give you the
[1:39:46] blood that's the life we have brothers
[1:39:48] and sisters it's the blood of Calvary
[1:39:50] it's not not on your good works it's not
[1:39:52] on your money you make it's not on your
[1:39:54] possessions but it's on you serving God
[1:39:57] and you live your life for God whether
[1:39:59] you've got failures whether you got
[1:40:00] faults whether you got things that
[1:40:02] stumble in your way God still sees you
[1:40:06] through the
[1:40:07] [Applause]
[1:40:10] blood
[1:40:12] [Music]
[1:40:14] Glory he said he he said he looked and
[1:40:16] he heard that little lamb bleeding that
[1:40:18] Ram bleeding in the thicket
[1:40:23] he said who was that
[1:40:26] lamb who let me ask you who was that
[1:40:30] lamb he said it was none other than
[1:40:32] Christ it was Christ who offered himself
[1:40:36] up for
[1:40:37] [Applause]
[1:40:39] [Music]
[1:40:42] Isaac and he called the place Jehovah
[1:40:48] Gyra I told you we're going to have a
[1:40:50] little history
[1:40:53] history March of
[1:40:57] 1822 our Mentor Ross Was Born Into
[1:40:59] Slavery on a large Plantation near
[1:41:02] Blackwater River in the Madison area of
[1:41:05] Dorchester County
[1:41:07] Maryland her childhood was not a
[1:41:09] childhood to be desired at
[1:41:12] all miny's mother was assigned to the
[1:41:15] big house and she had very little time
[1:41:18] for minty and her family and her
[1:41:20] brothers and sisters
[1:41:21] so as a child she took care of her
[1:41:22] younger brothers and the
[1:41:24] babies when she was five or six years
[1:41:27] old she was hired out as a nursaid for a
[1:41:30] woman named
[1:41:32] Susan me he was ordered to care for the
[1:41:35] baby and rock the cradle as the baby
[1:41:39] slept when the baby woke up and
[1:41:42] cried miny got a
[1:41:44] whooping five years
[1:41:48] old she later recounted the talked about
[1:41:51] this day when she said one day the baby
[1:41:53] cried so much she received lashes five
[1:41:55] different times before breakfast and she
[1:41:58] carried the scars for the rest of her
[1:42:01] life she would do things to try to get
[1:42:03] away she would try to run away for as
[1:42:04] much as five days a fivey old running
[1:42:09] away for up to five days at a time since
[1:42:12] she would wear heavy clothes and Patty
[1:42:14] clothes to try to protect herself from
[1:42:16] the lashes that she would get as she
[1:42:18] fought
[1:42:19] back
[1:42:21] also in her childhood she was sent to
[1:42:23] work for a
[1:42:24] planner and this guy she had to go out
[1:42:27] and check his muskrat traps in the
[1:42:30] marshes as a child going through the
[1:42:33] marshes of Maryland checking
[1:42:36] traps and as she walked through there
[1:42:38] she began to get sick and she come down
[1:42:40] with
[1:42:41] measles they wouldn't let her
[1:42:43] stop measles is a serious
[1:42:46] sickness and so here she is now tra
[1:42:48] traing through the woods checking traps
[1:42:50] with with measles until almost to the
[1:42:52] point of death I sent her back to her
[1:42:54] mama and said take care of
[1:42:55] her they left her there to sit there to
[1:42:58] basically a die she becomes so ill but
[1:43:00] then again her mama be to nurse her back
[1:43:02] and prayed over her and give herself and
[1:43:04] she lay in it over her and raised her
[1:43:06] back up to health but no no no longer
[1:43:10] was she she well and healthy that that
[1:43:12] she was hired out
[1:43:14] again she spoke about how homesick she
[1:43:17] was as a
[1:43:19] child

[1:43:33] Timber in and out of the
[1:43:36] woods at an as an
[1:43:39] adolescent she suffered a severe head
[1:43:41] injury she suffered a severe head injury

[1:44:01] unconscious she was returned to the to
[1:44:04] the house the enslaver house where she
[1:44:07] laid on the seat of a little couch or a
[1:44:10] little cot where she remained without
[1:44:12] medical care for two
[1:44:15] days Broken Skull blood
[1:44:18] flowing you say where you going this
[1:44:20] I've got a
[1:44:23] place after this incident she began to
[1:44:26] experience extremely painful headaches
[1:44:29] she began to have seizures and fall
[1:44:32] unconscious she was fall unconscious but
[1:44:34] it she claimed to be aware of all of her
[1:44:38] surroundings as she appeared to be
[1:44:40] sleeping and this condition remained
[1:44:43] with her for the rest of her life so
[1:44:44] after this injury mty began to
[1:44:46] experience visions and vivid dreams
[1:44:50] which he and interpreted as the
[1:44:51] revelations from
[1:44:53] God she began to see these spiritual
[1:44:56] experiences and had a had a profound
[1:44:58] effect on her personality and and and
[1:45:00] the passion that she had for the faith
[1:45:02] in God and although she was a literate
[1:45:05] she was told Bible stories by her
[1:45:07] mother she was told Bible stories by her
[1:45:11] mother and and she attended a Methodist
[1:45:13] Church and she found she found guidance
[1:45:15] in the Old Testament Tales of
[1:45:17] Deliverance she found encouragement in
[1:45:20] the relig stories of Moses and the
[1:45:22] Deliverance of the children of Israel
[1:45:23] and that the blood being applied and the
[1:45:25] token applied and she found she found
[1:45:28] some some encouragement in these
[1:45:35] words you see if anybody could say there
[1:45:38] was a
[1:45:40] Chasm a distance between themselves and
[1:45:43] God you want to talk about a lonely
[1:45:45] feeling think about that
[1:45:48] childhood think about you mothers think
[1:45:50] about that being your
[1:45:52] child but yet she found
[1:45:54] consulant she found cons consoling and
[1:45:58] Sav in the word of
[1:46:04] God
[1:46:05] sometime in October of
[1:46:08] 1851 miny made her
[1:46:13] escape and I love to hear about the the
[1:46:15] old stories like this and the
[1:46:18] documentaries and she stood in the woods
[1:46:22] to alert her family and friends of what
[1:46:23] she was doing and as she stood in the
[1:46:26] word in the in the in the woods she
[1:46:28] began to sing
[1:46:31] songs we call them Negro
[1:46:35] spirituals but they were more than just
[1:46:37] church
[1:46:38] songs they were road maps they were
[1:46:42] destinations they was
[1:46:45] goals accomplishments and right when she
[1:46:48] got ready to run away she she found
[1:46:50] herself in the woods and she said I will
[1:46:52] meet you in the
[1:46:55] morning and they could hear this echoing
[1:46:57] out of the
[1:46:59] woods and the next thing she said I'm
[1:47:01] Bound for the promised
[1:47:04] land and they begin to put this two
[1:47:06] songs together and they begin to hear
[1:47:08] and they begin to realize she's leaving
[1:47:11] she's fixing to give up this life of
[1:47:12] bondage she's going to make a run for it
[1:47:15] she's going to where there's a land of
[1:47:17] Freedom where there's a land of liberty
[1:47:19] she's going to the promised land the
[1:47:21] land that she's heard about and read
[1:47:22] about and stories been told over and
[1:47:25] over brothers and sisters we're headed
[1:47:27] for a land we're heading for a land
[1:47:29] where there be no more
[1:47:31] bondage
[1:47:33] thank that's
[1:47:36] right and if you've ever been in any
[1:47:42] [Applause]
[1:47:44] bondage you know what freedom feels
[1:47:49] like you know what freedom feels
[1:47:52] like after she made her Escape she
[1:47:54] changed her name and she changed the
[1:47:57] name may be more familiar with her name
[1:47:59] was Harriet
[1:48:03] Tubman her name was Harriet
[1:48:06] Tubman the route that she took on uh is
[1:48:09] UN it was unknown for years how she made
[1:48:11] the Escape into the Underground Railroad
[1:48:14] and she would go uh as she be to fight
[1:48:16] 90 miles on a track by herself
[1:48:21] you see sometimes things ain't always
[1:48:24] easy we got the blood but sometimes we
[1:48:26] got to
[1:48:28] fight there was a Chasm between her and
[1:48:30] freedom there was bondage and freedom
[1:48:33] and there was a place that she had to
[1:48:34] get the Gap out from in between yeah she
[1:48:37] be to go and she be to go 90 miles and
[1:48:39] it would take her uh five days to three
[1:48:42] weeks can you imagine as she run through
[1:48:44] the marshes and through the woods and
[1:48:47] the hounds following
[1:48:49] her how many of you's ever had the
[1:48:51] hounds of Hell after
[1:48:57] you she traveled a night and she said

[1:49:09] me she was illiterate she didn't have no
[1:49:13] education she couldn't read she couldn't
[1:49:15] write she didn't know her name if you
[1:49:17] showed it to her but she knew if she
[1:49:19] could follow that North Star that the
[1:49:21] north star that she had heard about her
[1:49:23] whole life would guide her to a place of
[1:49:25] freedom and she followed that North Star
[1:49:28] so that and she followed and went at
[1:49:30] night so that the
[1:49:31] fugitives or the ones who were
[1:49:34] collecting rewards couldn't catch her
[1:49:45] yeah one of her particular
[1:49:49] Journeys she began to go through the
[1:49:53] route this was on her first
[1:49:56] journey she come to a place that there
[1:49:59] was a neighborly type person a family
[1:50:02] they were against the slavery and they
[1:50:04] could hear the they could hear the
[1:50:06] hounds they could hear the the the
[1:50:09] people coming the the to come and pull
[1:50:11] them back into
[1:50:13] slavery and they told they said you grab
[1:50:15] a broom and you sweep the
[1:50:18] porch like you were
[1:50:20] here you grab a broom and you sweep the
[1:50:23] porch until they
[1:50:25] leave they looked all over for
[1:50:29] miny they all over for her couldn't find
[1:50:31] her and later that evening they they
[1:50:34] took and they tucked her into a wagon
[1:50:36] and covered her over into the wagon and
[1:50:37] she began to journey and they get they
[1:50:39] let her out and give her to the next
[1:50:40] person and handed her off to the next
[1:50:42] person who cared and as she goes down
[1:50:44] through here she said when she comes she
[1:50:46] recalled the experience of what it felt
[1:50:48] like when she crossed over into p
[1:50:52] Pennsylvania and she felt the experience
[1:50:54] a feeling of relief and awe and she said
[1:50:56] when I crossed over that line I looked
[1:50:59] at my hands to see if I was still the
[1:51:02] same
[1:51:03] person Lord can you imagine brothers and
[1:51:06] sisters oh there's coming a day when
[1:51:08] we'll cross over we'll get so close that
[1:51:11] we'll look at our hands and our hands
[1:51:13] will look new we look at our feet and
[1:51:15] they may be doing some dancing too
[1:51:18] because we are coming to day
[1:51:21] of Freedom Deliverance by the blood of
[1:51:24] Jesus
[1:51:27] Christ she saids the do you have time
[1:51:30] for some
[1:51:33] more after reaching
[1:51:36] Philadelphia Harriet said she's thinking
[1:51:38] of her family she said I was a Stranger
[1:51:41] in a Strange Land she said and she said
[1:51:44] but now I'm free and they should be
[1:51:47] free you know there's something about
[1:51:49] when you become to Christ and you've got
[1:51:51] that blood that's been applied to your
[1:51:53] life there's something about it that you
[1:51:55] just say man I want them to have the
[1:51:57] same blood that I've got I want them to
[1:51:59] have the same Deliverance that I've got
[1:52:01] I want them to be free just like me and
[1:52:05] she thought about it she said I'm going
[1:52:06] back for my
[1:52:08] family and the guy the head over the
[1:52:11] Underground Railroad he said you can't
[1:52:14] go you can't go har it because you are
[1:52:18] illiterate and you can't read the road
[1:52:20] signs you don't know which direction to
[1:52:23] go and she said don't you tell me what I
[1:52:25] can and what I can't
[1:52:27] do she said because I may not be able to
[1:52:32] read because God tells me where to go
[1:52:35] God leads me God directs me don't tell
[1:52:38] me what I can and can't
[1:52:41] do and she said she was going on this
[1:52:45] journey they discouraged her to take
[1:52:47] this journey she loaded up her bags she
[1:52:50] began to head back to Maryland to guide
[1:52:51] the rest of the family away and from 19
[1:52:55] or 1851 to
[1:52:57] 1862 she returned repeatedly to the
[1:52:59] eastern shore of Maryland she brought
[1:53:02] back 70 slaves in 13
[1:53:10] Expeditions she gave Specific
[1:53:12] Instructions to 50 or 60 more on how to
[1:53:15] get
[1:53:18] there
[1:53:20] you know what they nicknamed
[1:53:22] her
[1:53:28] Moses the the slave owners couldn't
[1:53:30] figure out who is taking all these
[1:53:32] slaves who is running off with our
[1:53:34] slaves how are we going to catch this
[1:53:36] person they said it's like
[1:53:38] Moses he sing he she would dress like a
[1:53:41] man said he sings the songs of Israel he
[1:53:45] she sings the songs of Deliverance of
[1:53:48] Moses
[1:53:51] amen so anytime they said Moses is
[1:53:53] coming how many people you think I'm out
[1:53:56] of the
[1:53:57] houses it's going home
[1:54:00] time Jesus is
[1:54:02] coming it's going home
[1:54:09] time by the late
[1:54:12] 1850s the slave owners held a public
[1:54:15] meeting and they wanted to to put an end
[1:54:17] to this Moses little did they know that
[1:54:20] there was a a little lady by the
[1:54:22] nickname of
[1:54:23] minty who stood about 5T
[1:54:26] tall
[1:54:28] petite 5 feet tall and she's the one
[1:54:31] responsible for freeing all these
[1:54:34] slaves and taking them
[1:54:37] 90 miles
[1:54:43] away they wanted her so
[1:54:46] bad I want you to listen to this stag
[1:54:48] green number they offered a $40,000
[1:54:51] reward for her
[1:54:53] death that's equivalent to $1.3 million
[1:55:02] today one do you know how much money
[1:55:04] that
[1:55:06] is 1.3 million she said I never run my
[1:55:10] train off track and I never lost a
[1:55:15] passenger you think man that's that's
[1:55:18] something they are play a key role in
[1:55:21] the the release of people in the when
[1:55:24] the when the Civil War took place she
[1:55:26] became a spy for the Union
[1:55:29] Army she became one of the only women to
[1:55:32] lead a armed battle against a an
[1:55:37] opponent she began to tell them exactly
[1:55:39] what was going she sent word to the
[1:55:41] slaves back in Maryland I believe it was
[1:55:44] that that they were going to come that
[1:55:45] the union was going to come and that
[1:55:47] they as they begin to come be listening
[1:55:48] for the sound sounds of the ships be
[1:55:52] listening for the whistles and when she
[1:55:54] begin to begin to tell them and they
[1:55:57] come up on the on the on the shore there
[1:56:00] they begin to sound the whistles and
[1:56:01] they stand there looking and all of a
[1:56:04] sudden she sees a a fleeing slavery
[1:56:06] Stampede coming towards
[1:56:08] her the Stampede of slaves is being
[1:56:11] chased by the Confederate soldiers and
[1:56:14] they're being chased and at that time
[1:56:16] the union all Point points their guns
[1:56:18] and she says she she tells the scene and
[1:56:21] she said it was a scene of chaos women
[1:56:24] they was carrying their stilling and
[1:56:26] running for everything that they could
[1:56:28] get taking everything they had with them
[1:56:31] they she said that the parents would
[1:56:32] have slings around their necks and
[1:56:40] babies
[1:56:42] 750 delivered that
[1:56:46] day 750 delivered in one day
[1:56:53] you see Harriet Tubman couldn't she
[1:56:55] couldn't help where she was
[1:56:56] born she couldn't help that she was born
[1:56:59] into slavery she couldn't help the life
[1:57:01] that she had been given she had no
[1:57:02] control over that in her life but one
[1:57:04] thing she knew that she could just cross
[1:57:07] that 90 miles of wilderness that there
[1:57:09] was a pardon waiting for her on the
[1:57:10] other side and and and freedom could be
[1:57:13] had and a new life could be lived a life
[1:57:15] of happiness and joy and peace and a
[1:57:17] life with God on her side that he could
[1:57:19] not
[1:57:21] fail let me tell you this morning
[1:57:24] brothers and sisters you may not have
[1:57:26] control over the situation in your life
[1:57:29] you may not can help who you were born
[1:57:31] to you may not can help where you were
[1:57:33] raised or how you were raised but one
[1:57:35] thing I can tell you is if you've got
[1:57:37] God on your side and the blood of Jesus
[1:57:40] Christ you cannot fail all the devil's
[1:57:44] going to tell you that you can't they
[1:57:46] try to tell her you can't because you're
[1:57:48] this or this this
[1:57:50] and that's what the devil does in our
[1:57:52] lives he says you can't make it you
[1:57:54] can't overcome you've got this in your
[1:57:56] life you've got that in your
[1:57:58] life look him in the face and say don't
[1:58:01] you tell me what I can and can't do
[1:58:02] devil don't you tell me what I can and
[1:58:04] can't do because I've got God on my
[1:58:07] [Laughter]
[1:58:10] [Applause]
[1:58:11] side that's
[1:58:14] right brother Brown said that there's
[1:58:16] something that you didn't have control
[1:58:18] over too
[1:58:20] I want you to listen to this he said my
[1:58:23] sins was something I couldn't
[1:58:25] help oh
[1:58:29] my my sins was something I couldn't
[1:58:33] help he said I was born into it he said
[1:58:36] I was born with Adam's nature in me but
[1:58:40] somebody pardoned me he said somebody
[1:58:43] paron me he said they rubbed that old
[1:58:45] account away one day and I was free from
[1:58:49] that day on he said but there's
[1:58:51] something about when man crosses that
[1:58:53] Chasm and they let that get between them
[1:58:55] and God he separated from God so
[1:58:58] brothers and sisters in your life think
[1:59:00] about your life today what is separating
[1:59:03] you from
[1:59:05] God what is the what is growing the
[1:59:07] distance between you and God not I hope
[1:59:11] it's something is short in the distance
[1:59:12] but if you've got something in your life
[1:59:14] fear do you let
[1:59:16] fear push you farther away from God
[1:59:22] you're getting quiet on
[1:59:24] me we're striking some striking some
[1:59:26] nerves here do we let doubt push us
[1:59:29] farther away from God do we let our
[1:59:31] unbelief push us further away from God
[1:59:34] do we allow anger to push us farther
[1:59:36] away from God I'm not saying you're not
[1:59:38] Christians I'm not saying you're not
[1:59:40] saved but it goes back to what I said
[1:59:42] earlier are there things in your life
[1:59:43] you need to plunge under the blood you
[1:59:46] can be a Christian you can serve God
[1:59:47] with all your heart but if you're you're
[1:59:49] allowing fear and anxieties and and
[1:59:51] doubts and anger and jealousy and
[1:59:54] mischief to keep you and hinder you from
[1:59:57] a full Victorious Life With God plunge
[2:00:00] it under the
[2:00:01] blood close that
[2:00:11] Chasm I'm gonna have to hurry I'm G have
[2:00:13] to skip
[2:00:16] some Winston Church Hill
[2:00:22] he became Britain's prime minister on
[2:00:24] May the 10th
[2:00:28] 1940 and he later
[2:00:30] wrote he later wrote that I felt that
[2:00:33] all my past life had been but a
[2:00:37] preparation for this hour and for this
[2:00:41] trial I thought my
[2:00:44] goodness a man who practically fought
[2:00:48] Hitler Toe to
[2:00:50] Toe and we think we've got
[2:00:57] trials on that very day that he was
[2:01:01] elected to fulfill his life's
[2:01:04] ambition Germany that morning had
[2:01:06] invaded France Belgium the Netherlands
[2:01:10] Luxembourg Britain had faced its Supreme
[2:01:13] test and it's his leadership through
[2:01:16] this F uh through through the 40 and 41
[2:01:20] you can look in and study the Battle of
[2:01:23] Dunkirk and you'll see that that's where
[2:01:25] Church Hill is best remembered right in
[2:01:27] this area here but what did he do what
[2:01:30] did he do so so
[2:01:33] great he knew how to rally the
[2:01:37] troops it said that his word was the
[2:01:39] greatest weapon that he
[2:01:42] had in a
[2:01:45] conference in in the message conference
[2:01:47] with God brother Brown said it was a
[2:01:50] conference because of World War II it
[2:01:52] was almost getting out of hands I want
[2:01:53] you to listen to how important Church
[2:01:55] Hill
[2:01:56] was brother R said they had to get
[2:01:58] together and put all their strategy
[2:02:00] together to work out something Mr
[2:02:02] Churchill and Roosevelt and the others
[2:02:04] they was trying to pull their senses
[2:02:06] together to pull it to it and to find
[2:02:08] out what was best because it was a
[2:02:10] crucial moment listen now it was a time
[2:02:14] when the whole free world would have
[2:02:16] blown up and Hitler today would have
[2:02:19] been a dictator of the whole world and
[2:02:21] we would not be having this meeting
[2:02:27] today you and I would be speaking German
[2:02:30] that's right there would be no America
[2:02:33] yeah that's right now well you got to be
[2:02:35] thankful for thank you Lord you would
[2:02:37] find yourself on one side or the other
[2:02:39] you'd find
[2:02:40] yourself supporting uh the old Germany
[2:02:43] or you find yourself supporting the Nazi
[2:02:46] party yeah the church here got together
[2:02:49] and Church Hill begin to talk and he
[2:02:51] begin to inspir he began to get there
[2:02:53] and he begin to talk and he got out
[2:02:55] there listen to what he says he says we
[2:02:57] shall go on to the
[2:02:59] end even though large tracks of Europe
[2:03:03] and many of those old famous States had
[2:03:05] fallen or may fall into the grip of the
[2:03:07] gestapo and the odorus apparatus of the
[2:03:11] Nazi rule we shall not flag or
[2:03:15] fail we got to come to a place where we
