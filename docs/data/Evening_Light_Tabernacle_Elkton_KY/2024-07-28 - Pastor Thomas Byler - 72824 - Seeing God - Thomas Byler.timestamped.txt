[43:14] name
[43:18] amen children can be dismissed to Sunday
[43:21] school and if you'll just stand with me
[43:22] and go with me in the Psalms here
[43:29] going to go to Psalm six this
[43:38] morning Psalm
[43:40] 6 just a few verses
[43:46] here oh Lord rebuke me not in thine
[43:49] anger neither chasen me in thy hot
[43:51] displeasure
[44:00] my soul is also sore vexed but thou oh
[44:03] Lord how
[44:10] long for in death there is no
[44:13] remembrance of thee in the grave who
[44:15] shall give thee
[44:25] thanks my ey is consumed because of
[44:28] grief it is waxed old because of all
[44:31] mine
[44:37] enemies the Lord ha heard my
[44:40] supplications the Lord will receive my
[44:42] prayer let all mine enemies be ashamed
[44:45] and sore vexed let them return and be
[44:48] ashamed suddenly God bless you may be
[44:51] seated brother Brian
[45:09] morning brothers and
[45:14] sisters if you would turn with me to
[45:18] Corinthians 2 Corinthians the 5th
[45:20] chapter but reading that Psalm there you
[45:25] know God does really care you know how
[45:26] how many of us have been in that
[45:28] position in our life where you've had
[45:30] some type of situation some type of
[45:32] trouble in your life where you've been
[45:34] like David here in the psalm and you've
[45:37] given your whole soul heart and mind has
[45:39] been fixed by the things around you and
[45:41] then all of a sudden God just speaks to
[45:43] your heart you just know that he's heard
[45:45] you and he's going to make it right by
[45:47] you you know that's a that's a
[45:49] comforting thought so in the word of
[45:52] God if I don't lose all these places in
[45:56] here
[45:57] I was just going to read I was
[45:59] U I don't know how many times I listened
[46:02] to that message this last night and this
[46:05] morning and other times that last one
[46:08] brother Brandon preached which is called
[46:10] leadership it was in uh 1965 in December
[46:14] but I I made a note I I'm for some
[46:17] reason I have a hard time printing out
[46:20] quotes off of that table so I just wrote
[46:23] down something that struck my heart but
[46:25] I'll just read few of these verses is
[46:27] here in 2 Corinthians the 5th chapter
[46:30] and I'm sure all you know this chapter
[46:33] by heart you know the most important
[46:35] thing we can do the brother Bram always
[46:37] told us you got to read your Bible every
[46:39] day and every person has a certain
[46:41] portion of the word of God that means a
[46:43] lot to him um I like this chapter I read
[46:46] this a lot too for we know of our
[46:49] Earthly House of this Tabernacle word we
[46:52] have a building of God a house not made
[46:54] with hands Eternal in the heaven
[46:58] so you know when you read that just that
[47:00] first verse there it really should open
[47:02] your heart to know that God cares you
[47:04] about you so much that he's thinking
[47:06] about you making this happen for you
[47:09] this morning and he goes on to say here
[47:11] for in this we grown earnestly Desiring
[47:14] to be clothed upon with our house which
[47:17] is from heaven and I'm sure everyone
[47:19] feels that way this morning that's anop
[47:22] that everyone talks about that's calling
[47:24] you in that song your desire is to be in
[47:27] that place it goes on to say in the
[47:29] third verse if so being clothed we shall
[47:32] not be found naked for we are for we
[47:36] that are in this Tabernacle do groan
[47:39] being burdened not for what we would be
[47:41] unclothed but clothed upon the mortality
[47:44] might be swallowed up of life now he
[47:47] that hath wrought us for the selfsame
[47:50] thing is God who ha given us the earnest
[47:52] of the spirit this morning you all have
[47:55] that this morning there therefore we are
[47:57] always confident you know th was we are
[47:59] at home in the body we are absent from
[48:02] the Lord and that's where we're all at
[48:04] this morning as long as you're in this
[48:06] body you're waiting to be on the other
[48:08] side in that body where you can see the
[48:11] Lord face to face and you know him and
[48:13] he goes on to say I lost my place but I
[48:17] for we walk not by faith but by sight we
[48:19] are confident I say and willing rather
[48:21] to be AB absent from the body to be
[48:24] present with the L Lord wherefore we
[48:26] labor that we present whether pres
[48:30] present or absent we may be accepted of
[48:33] him I'll just finish at that ninth verse
[48:35] if you would go with me to uh the
[48:39] Epistle of John this morning let me
[48:43] open I know I get in a hurry you know
[48:46] I'm one of those individuals I I don't
[48:49] have a lot to say some of you all know
[48:51] that about me I don't say a whole bunch
[48:53] but uh I was just thinking this morning
[48:55] I wrote I was listen listening to that
[48:57] message about leadership this morning
[49:00] and I couldn't get this quote to print
[49:02] out I and I don't like bringing my
[49:05] tablet here because I have all my
[49:07] business stuff on and I'm always I've
[49:09] said this before I'm always afraid of
[49:11] some customers video coming up and and
[49:14] being a little bit too salty but
[49:17] um this is what brother brandom had I
[49:19] don't the exact quote where it comes
[49:22] from but it really struck me this
[49:24] morning now he said now look look at
[49:26] yourself really are you a genuine Bible
[49:30] Christian full of the love of God and
[49:33] and in this message he talked about he
[49:36] had several examples he talked about the
[49:38] Rich Young Ruler and then he talked
[49:41] about the Infidel that he was squirrel
[49:43] hunting with he met he had certain
[49:45] examples that he was bringing then he
[49:47] goes on to say and I just wrote a uh a
[49:50] little note to myself here when brother
[49:53] brownon was talking about full of the
[49:55] love of God well we know this morning
[49:57] that you can only be full of the love of
[49:59] God unless the you have to have God's
[50:01] holy ghost you have to have the presence
[50:03] of the Holy Ghost in your heart and life
[50:05] or you won't be full of the love of God
[50:07] you'll still have the world in you and
[50:09] he goes on to say you remember the Bible
[50:12] said in the last days when this time T
[50:14] when this time takes place he said he'll
[50:17] send Mark and
[50:19] Angels through and he said through the
[50:21] churches and I was thinking about that
[50:23] this morning you know we're at that
[50:25] place this morning where God is watching
[50:28] everything we do everything we say
[50:30] everything you know I know I'm not
[50:33] trying to be funny but sometimes we
[50:34] don't think God is watching us and we do
[50:36] things we know that really can you bring
[50:40] the things we do can you bring them
[50:41] through the word of God and that's what
[50:43] in that first thing he said are we Bible
[50:46] Christians this morning we only do the
[50:48] things that we can bring Through the
[50:50] Bible this morning the fully through the
[50:52] word of God if anything we're doing this
[50:55] morning can't fully come through the
[50:57] word of God then we don't need to have
[50:59] it in our hearts and lives this morning
[51:01] and I'll just I didn't write it all down
[51:03] I didn't but he said he goes on to say
[51:07] the Bible says in the last days this
[51:09] time takes place he said send the
[51:11] marking Angels throughout the churches
[51:13] and that's where I didn't I I didn't I
[51:16] sto writing but I was
[51:18] thinking some of the other things he was
[51:20] saying he was he he was talking to
[51:23] everyone in that church service in
[51:24] California he wasn't just talking to the
[51:27] Methodist he just wasn't talking to the
[51:29] Baptist he just wasn't talking to the
[51:32] Pentecostals he was also talking to us
[51:35] this morning in that message and and the
[51:37] thing that struck me about that message
[51:39] this morning is that he was speaking to
[51:42] our hearts and lives to let us know that
[51:44] the only thing that'll be there on that
[51:46] other side is the character that God
[51:49] builds in your heart in life this
[51:51] morning and the only way that you can
[51:53] have that character goes about what I
[51:55] wrote Are you a true genuine Bible
[51:59] Christian this morning and the only way
[52:00] you know that is by the word of God this
[52:03] morning and uh I hope I didn't lose my
[52:07] place here I think it's in the uh in the
[52:10] second chapter of the first Epistle of
[52:13] John I I'm not going to say I know I say
[52:15] a lot of cliches but I'm I'm not going
[52:18] to say you know think about me I've
[52:20] maybe the Army ruined me but I'm the
[52:23] kind of person that everything has to be
[52:25] done in brevity I I don't like saying a
[52:27] lot or doing a lot of things verbally I
[52:30] like to be consise about what I say I
[52:33] don't I don't like just I don't like
[52:36] running on and running on I like to get
[52:38] to the point about things that that
[52:41] probably comes to my Army days but
[52:43] everything has to be concise and to the
[52:46] point that's just the how I am but it
[52:49] goes on to say here this first verse in
[52:51] this chapter the second chapter my
[52:53] little children these things I write
[52:55] onto you that you sin not so John the
[52:58] Apostle John is telling us he's writing
[53:02] these things so that we don't sin that
[53:04] if any man sin we have an advocate with
[53:06] the father Jesus Christ the righteous
[53:09] and heas is the propriation for our sins
[53:13] not of ours only but also for the sins
[53:16] of the whole world so John was seeing
[53:19] here that through throughout the until
[53:21] the coming of Jesus Christ that
[53:23] sacrifice was given one time for for the
[53:26] whole world for all those that would
[53:28] believe it and he goes on to say here
[53:31] hereby we know that we know him if we
[53:33] keep his Commandments and that goes back
[53:35] to what I was reading what brother I
[53:37] wrote down what brother banam said if
[53:40] you're a true Bible believing Christian
[53:43] you'll do what you'll do with this third
[53:45] verse you'll keep God's Commandments
[53:48] this morning and he goes on to say he he
[53:50] that saith I know him and and keepeth
[53:53] not his Commandments is a liar and the
[53:55] truth is not in him
[53:57] but whosoever keepeth his word in in him
[54:00] rarely is the love of God perfected
[54:02] hereby know we that we are in him and he
[54:05] goes on to say he that he that saith he
[54:09] abideth him ought himself also the walk
[54:12] even as he walked so he's telling us
[54:15] giving us a charge here this morning
[54:17] that that example that need we need to
[54:19] look at is the example of Jesus Christ
[54:22] in the gospels that's who we need to
[54:24] emanate that's who we need to bring our
[54:26] lives around the word of God and
[54:29] whatever Christ was that's what we need
[54:31] to be and I lost my place there but he
[54:34] goes Brethren I write no new commandment
[54:36] onto you but any old commandment which
[54:39] you have had from the beginning the old
[54:41] commandment is the word which you have
[54:43] heard from the beginning so John just
[54:46] like brother brandham just like any real
[54:48] man of God is always going to bring you
[54:51] back to the word of God he's not going
[54:53] to bring you to his own ideas or how he
[54:55] sees things
[54:57] he's always going to bring you back to
[54:58] God's word and and that's our
[55:01] responsibility as Christians genuine
[55:03] Christians is that everything that we do
[55:05] and believe has got to go back to the
[55:07] word of God and I'll just read read a
[55:10] few more verses and sit down and again I
[55:13] might reread the same verse again a a
[55:15] new commandment I write un you which
[55:17] thing is to and in you because darkness
[55:20] is passed and the True Light now shineth
[55:23] and he that sayith in he is in the light
[55:25] and he his brother is in darkness even
[55:28] to now we all live Above This I know and
[55:31] he that loveth his brother abideth in
[55:33] the light and there's none occasion of
[55:35] stumbling in him but I I'll finish there
[55:38] and I was just thinking you know the
[55:39] world brother Brandon in that message
[55:41] this morning you know I can't listen to
[55:44] it enough he
[55:46] was he was talking he was just he was
[55:49] talking like I said to pend he was
[55:51] talking to everybody and just like John
[55:54] said you can't think of yourself anymore
[55:56] more than you really are he was
[55:58] genuinely telling the people that to be
[56:02] there on that day the word of God has to
[56:04] have its full effect in your heart and
[56:06] lives and you're deceiving yourself if
[56:08] it doesn't and it and what it really
[56:11] struck me a lot of times about the
[56:14] message of the hour you know he's
[56:16] talking in
[56:18] 1965 to these people but we're now in
[56:22] 2024 about to go into
[56:24] 2025 and see the things right now that
[56:27] he's talking about the depravity that's
[56:29] out there in the world and it should
[56:31] only draw us closer to Jesus Christ this
[56:34] morning as we believe the word of God
[56:36] for the hour they were living Brother
[56:42] David oh sorry

[1:26:36] cometh and tth Andrew and Andrew and
[1:26:39] Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered

[1:26:45] son of man should be glorified verily I
[1:26:48] say unto you except the corn of wheat
[1:26:50] fall into the ground and die it abideth

[1:27:51] simple subject and I'm sure I've spoken
[1:27:53] of on it before but amen I just want to
[1:27:57] I feel led to speak on it one more time
[1:27:59] amen and basically I want to read a
[1:28:03] couple scriptures if I or a couple
[1:28:04] quotes if I could and me try to lay a
[1:28:07] little foundations and amen and and this
[1:28:09] is kind of where it's took off at I like
[1:28:11] to sometimes just take off kind of where
[1:28:14] we left at left off at brother bam he
[1:28:17] makes a statement he was talking about
[1:28:18] those soldiers he says that crucified
[1:28:21] him and so forth we could think tonight
[1:28:24] of what a irrational and a horrible
[1:28:26] thing it was for those soldiers to put a
[1:28:28] rag over the face of our Lord Jesus to
[1:28:31] make fun of him being a prophet and
[1:28:33] could notice that could no the secrets
[1:28:35] of the heart a rag over his face and
[1:28:37] sent him out there in the courtyard and
[1:28:40] took a stick and struck him on the head
[1:28:42] with it and then passed it one to
[1:28:44] another and said if you be a prophet
[1:28:46] prophesy now and tell us which one of us
[1:28:49] hit you see no respects at all he says
[1:28:53] they couldn't feel no virtue but that
[1:28:55] little woman with enough Faith That
[1:28:57] Could Touch His Garment she got her
[1:29:00] desires you see we've got to be we've
[1:29:03] got to be conscience of God's
[1:29:10] presence
[1:29:12] amen
[1:29:14] amen amen I what came to me a conscience
[1:29:17] of God's presence for amen our
[1:29:20] conscience has to be in tune with his
[1:29:23] presence
[1:29:26] amen it's quite something isn't it that
[1:29:29] we're living in a world we're living in
[1:29:30] a world where somebody could do that to
[1:29:34] the Lord Jesus Christ and treat him in
[1:29:36] that way isin't that right and then
[1:29:38] another person just by the touching to
[1:29:40] the ham of their garments after they had
[1:29:42] spent all their money on doctors a that
[1:29:46] right yet grew
[1:29:49] worse never could get her healing even
[1:29:51] not a doctor in the world could heal her
[1:29:53] never couldn't help her but when she
[1:29:55] just touched the Hem of His Garment she
[1:29:58] was made completely whole virtue went
[1:30:01] out of
[1:30:03] her amen how many believe that we're
[1:30:06] still living in the same

[1:33:13] manifest In the
[1:33:15] Flesh manifest In the
[1:33:18] Flesh the word was with God the word was
[1:33:21] made flesh and dwelt Among Us and they
[1:33:23] still did see him that's
[1:33:25] right they didn't see God even the
[1:33:29] disciples Brother Brad they looked at
[1:33:31] him they were around
[1:33:33] him they didn't see
[1:33:36] God a't that
[1:33:40] right see Philip saith unto him in
[1:33:43] Chapter 14 verse 7 verse 8 Philip saith
[1:33:46] unto him Lord show us the father and
[1:33:48] it'll satisfy us cuz he kept talking
[1:33:51] about the father didn't he
[1:33:54] show us the father and it'll satisfy us
[1:33:58] and Jesus says unto him have I been with
[1:33:59] you so long a time with you and yet H
[1:34:02] has thou not known me
[1:34:04] Phillip you still don't know who I am Oh
[1:34:10] my he that has seen me has seen the
[1:34:16] father and how sayest thou then show us
[1:34:18] the father believest thou not that I am
[1:34:21] in the father and the father in me
[1:34:24] amen how many the fullness of the
[1:34:27] godhead was manifested in him
[1:34:35] bodily I want to make a statement just
[1:34:38] because I see you don't mean I see
[1:34:46] you just because you introduced me to
[1:34:49] your friend for the first time doesn't
[1:34:52] mean I now know him
[1:34:55] you might know his name you might know
[1:34:57] how he looks but you don't really know
[1:34:59] him you don't know what kind of person
[1:35:01] this is do
[1:35:02] you because what he really is is his
[1:35:07] character his character defines
[1:35:10] him remember brother Brandon preached a
[1:35:12] message called way back in 1964 I
[1:35:14] believe is God is identified by his
[1:35:19] characteristics in other words his
[1:35:21] character is what defines God
[1:35:24] the way that you know God is by his
[1:35:29] character all can I go slower when I
[1:35:32] think about what we talked about here
[1:35:34] amen across the pulpit and how that we
[1:35:36] look at God and how that he was amen
[1:35:39] Before Time was way back there he was
[1:35:41] omniscient he was omnipresent and he's
[1:35:44] omnipotent amen all
[1:35:48] powerful but when now we want to look at
[1:35:50] the amazingness of his character and to
[1:35:53] be able to see him because of his
[1:35:57] character amen let me finish this here
[1:36:00] first so he says he how can you say that
[1:36:02] he saids now notice he says believest
[1:36:05] now not that I am in the father and the
[1:36:06] father in me the word the words that I
[1:36:09] speak unto you I speak not of myself but
[1:36:12] the father that dwth in me he doeth The
[1:36:15] Works believe me that I am in the father
[1:36:18] and the father in me or else believe me
[1:36:21] for the very work sake
[1:36:24] how many believes sudden here you're
[1:36:26] identified by What You
[1:36:29] Do by your actions your actions identify
[1:36:34] you say well I'm a Christian like
[1:36:36] brother brother Brian was saying so you
[1:36:39] say I'm a Christian but then let me see
[1:36:41] your works you can say it all you want
[1:36:44] to but let me watch your actions that
[1:36:46] speaks
[1:36:48] louder I can really see it when I see
[1:36:50] the love of God coming from you amen for
[1:36:53] the gra of God coming from you but if
[1:36:55] you say you're a Christian and you got
[1:36:56] bitterness and hatred and everything
[1:36:58] else there's something that's not Jing
[1:37:00] so to
[1:37:03] speak it don't add up you aren't what
[1:37:07] you claim you are I thought I knew you
[1:37:09] but I didn't really know
[1:37:11] you you don't know a person just by
[1:37:14] seeing them you know them by the actions
[1:37:16] that they have and that's what Jesus was
[1:37:18] saying The Works am mean if you can't
[1:37:20] believe me then believe the works

[1:44:46] testify about his testimony oh we like
[1:44:48] to hear each other's testimony what's

[1:46:06] it brother Brian's Sunday school that if
[1:46:10] you claim that you know him you claim to
[1:46:14] know him then you also ought so to walk
[1:46:18] amen how many believes you you claim to
[1:46:20] know God you claim to have seen God well
[1:46:24] if you really have and he's coming the
[1:46:26] way that he has said that he would come

[1:46:31] your walk is going to walk like him your
[1:46:34] affections is going to be on him you're
[1:46:37] going to love like him you're going to

[1:46:46] you praise be to
[1:46:48] God oh
[1:46:50] my brother brand preach a message called
[1:46:53] Paradox ain't that right he begin to
[1:46:56] talk about how that you can see
[1:46:58] God in his
[1:47:03] creation Now I wrote down here in my
[1:47:06] notes we take so much for
[1:47:09] granted we take God so much for
[1:47:12] granted because when you really think
[1:47:14] about it he made all things for him
[1:47:17] ain't that right all things were made by
[1:47:19] him and for
[1:47:21] him whatever he created he created for
[1:47:24] his good
[1:47:30] pleasure we'll never Elevate ourselves
[1:47:33] or get spiritual talking about each
[1:47:36] other what a great man this is or great
[1:47:38] man that is or this that or the other no
[1:47:40] there's one that we can talk about
[1:47:42] that'll Lift us up and that is the great
[1:47:44] man Jesus
[1:47:45] Christ Amen brother bandam I heard him
[1:47:47] yesterday preaching he was talking about
[1:47:49] the Kenedy in the different ones man
[1:47:50] they'll get one and they'll brag him up
[1:47:52] brag him up brag him up and get a
[1:47:53] platform for him he says we're here to
[1:47:55] build a platform to Jesus we're here to
[1:47:58] promote
[1:47:59] him amen a lot of people looking for the
[1:48:02] next president who's going to be the
[1:48:03] next
[1:48:05] president folks I'm looking for a new
[1:48:07] heavens and a new Earth not a new
[1:48:10] president it's all debauched isn't
[1:48:13] it
[1:48:15] amen praise the Lord let me just kind of
[1:48:19] take a little side street here we all
[1:48:21] know that when camela was when she was
[1:48:23] became the vice president and all of
[1:48:25] that that she wore the color of dress
[1:48:27] brother Braham said that a woman with a
[1:48:29] certain dress and it was the color of
[1:48:30] the dress wasn't it that's the kind of
[1:48:33] color clothes that she had on and we all
[1:48:35] like whoa is this the woman and really
[1:48:38] he's just set a great woman in office I
[1:48:40] don't know he ever said she'd actually
[1:48:41] be president but here we are at the very
[1:48:44] brink of her actually becoming president
[1:48:47] and let me tell you something with the
[1:48:48] Crooked voting machines I wouldn't be a
[1:48:50] bit surprised they get her in
[1:48:54] hello and if she does come in hello
[1:48:58] signs of the time ain't that right next
[1:49:00] thing was what a big old bomb blowing up
[1:49:03] and me I was doing a little research
[1:49:05] they said and Russia had three bombs
[1:49:07] just three of their bombs would make it
[1:49:10] an America
[1:49:11] uninhabitable just three of them they
[1:49:13] got plenty of
[1:49:15] them two of them for Europe just two of
[1:49:19] them for
[1:49:21] Europe wow hello it's amazing how power
[1:49:26] how much power they have but you know
[1:49:28] what the miraculous thing is is that
[1:49:30] they can't do it until God allows
[1:49:33] it thank you Lord you and I be gone out
[1:49:36] of here before that
[1:49:38] happens amen that's God that's a paradox
[1:49:41] I thought when I thinking about par
[1:49:43] that's a paradox a miracle how many you
[1:49:46] you see God in the Miracles that he
[1:49:48] works because he specializes in things
[1:49:51] thought impossible
[1:49:57] amen if we can just be
[1:49:59] conscious of his
[1:50:02] presence
[1:50:09] omnipresent the Bible says that
[1:50:11] everything is sustained by God it's held
[1:50:14] together by
[1:50:15] God every bleed of grass that has life
[1:50:19] in it has God in it
[1:50:24] ain't that

[1:56:53] God wrote it so to speak in our DNA he
[1:56:58] wrote it in the heavens he wrote it on a
[1:57:01] everyday basis why can't people just
[1:57:03] open their
[1:57:05] eyes and see there is a
[1:57:12] God if you don't believe in God don't
[1:57:14] believe in that there is a God you won't
[1:57:17] amount to too
[1:57:19] much you won't amount to too much you'll
[1:57:22] be all sailes no
[1:57:24] anchor that's how the world is they all
[1:57:28] sails and no
[1:57:31] anchor we think how well how can it get
[1:57:33] any worse how can it get any worse well
[1:57:36] I think imitating having a bunch of drag
[1:57:38] queens imitating the Lord's
[1:57:41] Supper huh
[1:57:44] what just before
[1:57:48] Olympics truly truly Sodom to the core
[1:57:53] Sodom and Gomorrah to the core it's
[1:57:55] about time to get out of here cuz God's
[1:57:58] not just going to let that slide
[1:58:00] forever no he's
[1:58:03] not Brother Brad I truly believe that as
[1:58:06] long as his children here that's the
[1:58:08] only thing that's keeping him from
[1:58:10] bringing judgment upon the world those
[1:58:13] that are still
[1:58:14] righteous
[1:58:16] remember Abraham said are you gonna
[1:58:18] destroy Sodom if there's five 40 or 50
[1:58:21] righteous all the way down just a few if
[1:58:23] there's any righteous will you destroy
[1:58:26] nope ain't that right what was it about
[1:58:29] four of them come out and the one turned
[1:58:31] back to a pillar of salt cuz she looked
[1:58:33] back very few even they had to come out
[1:58:36] that's why brother Ram says don't worry
[1:58:37] about the bride going through the
[1:58:38] tribulation period why God don't burn
[1:58:41] the his his people with the
[1:58:44] wicked no he don't he takes them
[1:58:47] out amen so it's the righteous people
[1:58:51] that are still keeping the wrath of God
[1:58:53] off of this world but when that Rapture
[1:58:56] takes place when that Rapture takes
[1:58:59] place and those two prophets say no more
[1:59:03] rain hello fleas frogs flies and bring
[1:59:07] all kinds of curses upon the Earth can
[1:59:09] you imagine I don't even want to imagine
[1:59:11] I don't want to be here to imagine amen
[1:59:14] it's going to be a terrible place and
[1:59:15] we're right on the verge of it any time
[1:59:17] now the Lord could come at any time
[1:59:19] folks be ready for you know not the day
[1:59:22] nor the hour but as we see the signs
[1:59:25] appearing amen you better be ready I
[1:59:28] like that how many wants to be ready
[1:59:30] Jesus said be ready he didn't say be
[1:59:34] almost
[1:59:35] ready he didn't say get ready he said be
[1:59:40] ready be ready for you know not when the
[1:59:43] hour comes when that thief comes in in
[1:59:45] and in maybe it'll happen at
[1:59:48] midnight but Bram says between 6 and 99
[1:59:52] is that
[1:59:54] right well only six and nine in about
[1:59:58] one place on the earth everything else
[2:00:00] is a different time amen so you better
[2:00:02] be ready no matter what time he
[2:00:05] comes but back to thinking about it you
[2:00:08] see God in every day in every day that
[2:00:10] you live you should be able to see God's
[2:00:13] testimony that there's a
[2:00:16] resurrection that there's it's not over
[2:00:18] with it's not finished you lay down at
[2:00:21] night you get your rest why in the
[2:00:24] morning Bo I'm fresh and ready to go
[2:00:26] brand new
[2:00:28] man every single day you
[2:00:31] testify of the death burial and
[2:00:33] resurrection of people amen that God's
[2:00:36] going to bring it to pass other things
[2:00:39] that we don't
[2:00:40] see like consider The Sparrows how God
[2:00:45] feeds them ain't that right they don't
[2:00:47] and the lies of the field they don't to
[2:00:49] but your heavenly Father Knows what you
[2:00:52] have need of seek the kingdom of God
[2:00:55] first in other words God's Providence a
[2:00:57] lot of times we don't see we don't
[2:01:00] recognize that every time you have need
[2:01:01] of something God supplies it for
[2:01:05] you maybe one job closes and something
[2:01:08] else will open up it's always if you're
[2:01:11] a child of God you don't have to worry
[2:01:15] God is going to take care of
[2:01:18] you he's going to take care of you and a
[2:01:21] lot of time we don't recognize how that
[2:01:23] God does take care of us I see God if
[2:01:26] don't let me Vis it I was a tractor
[2:01:28] supply I think yesterday and I wanted to
[2:01:30] get this little building just a little
[2:01:32] small building has that tent tarp over
[2:01:34] it whatever and I was looking for a
[2:01:35] certain size and I talked to the lady
[2:01:37] the lady says do you have any of these
[2:01:38] tents yeah over there we have these
[2:01:39] little buildings whatever little tents
[2:01:41] went over there and they didn't have

[2:02:19] there somebody grabbed and says I want
[2:02:21] is halfway out they said no I don't want
[2:02:24] this after all they said it there cuz
[2:02:26] God knew I would be coming in I wanted
[2:02:28] something I said that's God he knows
[2:02:30] what you need he knows what you want and
[2:02:33] before I ever got there before I ever
[2:02:35] come God do what I have need of can we
[2:02:39] say this morning God knew before the
[2:02:40] foundation of the world that you would
[2:02:42] want salvation that you would want joy
[2:02:44] unspeakable and full of Glory that you'd
[2:02:46] have needed forgetful forgiveness and
[2:02:49] that he would want it so he supplied it
[2:02:51] 2,000 years ago not just then but before
[2:02:54] the foundation of the world he made it
[2:02:57] ready for you he says I'm going to put
[2:02:59] it in writing CU I know and you as a
[2:03:02] Christian how many know everything you
[2:03:03] have need of God will have it
[2:03:07] there I believe the scripture says God
[2:03:10] had knows what you have need of before
[2:03:12] you even
[2:03:14] ask how many's glad to serve a god like
[2:03:17] that thank you God for supplying
[2:03:23] you can have less gray hair
[2:03:25] now you don't have to worry about stuff
[2:03:27] because you know that you're in God's
[2:03:29] hands God will take care of
[2:03:34] you what God wants from you what God
[2:03:37] wants from me is your
[2:03:39] heart make room in that heart for Him
[2:03:42] will you make time for God pray so that
[2:03:47] you can see him in a greater
[2:03:49] way amen I won't read is I wanted to lay
[2:03:52] this for a foundation but it just comes
[2:03:53] to my mind now but we'll just go we'll
[2:03:56] just go quick over this where brother
[2:03:58] Bram talked about a little boy that went
[2:04:00] to his mom I believe it was and goes can
[2:04:02] anybody see God Mom said well ask your
[2:04:05] Sunday school teachers he went he went
[2:04:07] to the Sunday School teachers and they R
[2:04:09] to Sunday school says well ask the
[2:04:11] pastor you know I don't know ask the
[2:04:14] pastor if anybody can see
[2:04:16] God
[2:04:18] Amen the pastor says no son no oh son
[2:04:22] nobody can see God is that right and
[2:04:26] this I'm going to read this part the
[2:04:28] little fellow was
[2:04:29] disappointed amen and he used to stay
[2:04:32] down on the river he says we live near
[2:04:34] the Ohio river and he used to go down
[2:04:36] there with an old fisherman up the river
[2:04:38] a peace Tower Six Mile Island fishing
[2:04:40] all the time and one
[2:04:42] day after a big rain along this time of
[2:04:44] the year he was coming pulling down
[2:04:46] through the waters you know and any
[2:04:48] Boatman knows how that is music after
[2:04:51] raining is over and the little bitty
[2:04:52] waves on the water and you just let your
[2:04:55] ore slip across as if you were pulling
[2:04:58] your boat and was clipping along and the
[2:05:00] old fisherman had a long white beard he
[2:05:02] be to look over his shoulder where the
[2:05:04] sun come out and the sun had rain it had
[2:05:06] just rained in and there was a rainbow
[2:05:09] he pulled the ORS he turned around and
[2:05:10] look and a little fellow NOS of tears
[2:05:13] coming off of his white beard as it
[2:05:15] dropped down he'd pull a little further
[2:05:17] and he'd looked back oh the little boy
[2:05:20] he was s in the bow of the boat so he
[2:05:23] run towards the stern of the boat and he
[2:05:25] says sir I'm going to ask you a question
[2:05:27] that my mother can't answer my Sony
[2:05:29] school teacher and my pastor he said God
[2:05:33] is so great said Can anyone see him the
[2:05:37] old fisherman pulled his ores into his
[2:05:38] lap throw his hands to his face and like
[2:05:42] that and wept out grabbed that little
[2:05:45] fellow and huged and said God bless you
[2:05:47] a little heart honey all I've seen the
[2:05:50] past 35 years has been
[2:05:55] God how many believes every Sunrise
[2:05:58] every
[2:05:58] sunset we can see God
[2:06:02] everywhere that's right thank you Lord
[2:06:05] how many's glad to be able to see God
[2:06:08] when you see a sinner repenting you see
[2:06:10] God touching somebody's Hearts when you
[2:06:13] see them giving their heart to God Amen
[2:06:15] it's the master putting an imprint
[2:06:18] touching their
[2:06:20] heart all the things that we sometimes
[2:06:23] fail to see fail to
[2:06:25] recognize and each other didn't the
[2:06:28] Bible say he says that uh many are weak
[2:06:31] and sickly among you and many are even
[2:06:35] dead because we don't discern the Lord's
[2:06:38] body how many believ that I'm looking at
[2:06:42] God's
[2:06:43] body know you not that you are the body
[2:06:46] of Christ and members in particular how
[2:06:49] many beli the Church of the Living God
[2:06:51] is where Jesus
[2:06:53] dwells when you see kindness come from
[2:06:56] somebody when you see love a care coming
[2:07:01] from somebody you see God how many
[2:07:04] believes wives and husbands you should
[2:07:06] see it in each other children should see
[2:07:09] it in their parents we should see God in
[2:07:12] one
[2:07:13] another how it's because of the
[2:07:16] character that we
[2:07:18] have you don't see Christ's character
[2:07:21] when somebody spitting mad and and
[2:07:23] cussing at you no that's not God how
[2:07:25] mean knows the devil is easy to see the
[2:07:28] devil ah it's not hard to see him at all
[2:07:30] but sometimes it's harder to see
[2:07:33] God it's quite something that even the
[2:07:35] disciples couldn't hardly see him they
[2:07:37] should have realized that's
[2:07:39] not that's not just a man that's more
[2:07:42] than a
[2:07:44] man that's why I'm so excited when I
[2:07:46] think about God in this hour the
[2:07:48] unveiling how many brother B preached
[2:07:50] unveiling of God
[2:07:52] God veils himself he said he hid it from
[2:07:55] the eyes of the wise and prudent and
[2:07:57] reveals it to babes such as will
[2:08:00] learn God actually hides
[2:08:04] himself hides himself in
[2:08:08] Simplicity and you know how he reveals
[2:08:10] himself according to the prophet it's in
[2:08:13] the same he reveals himself in the same
[2:08:17] way in simplicity
[2:08:24] it's a little thing sometimes that we
[2:08:25] don't recognize like we should amen when
[2:08:29] you see
[2:08:32] longsuffering huh not short but long
[2:08:35] suffering when you see
[2:08:38] gentleness when you see
[2:08:40] meekness when you
[2:08:43] see Christians forbearing one another in
[2:08:47] love is that right putting up with each
[2:08:50] other
[2:08:51] not get all hostile because somebody
[2:08:54] isn't quite where we are or the way that
[2:08:55] you think they ought to be because
[2:08:58] they're not all going to be the way that
[2:08:59] you think they ought to be but have
[2:09:02] patience how many beli we have patience
[2:09:05] one with
[2:09:07] another how about not holding
[2:09:10] accounts the devil holds grudges the
[2:09:13] Holy Spirit doesn't hold any
[2:09:18] accounts those Pharisees wanted to Stone
[2:09:21] that woman that was caught in the very
[2:09:23] act but God was
[2:09:25] merciful how many believes you see that
[2:09:27] you see God in somebody that's
[2:09:31] merciful find somebody in the church
[2:09:33] always condemning everybody else and
[2:09:35] this that or the other remember that's
[2:09:36] not
[2:09:37] God God will say let's pray for him
[2:09:39] we're going to believe God's going to
[2:09:40] deliver him from that let's pray for him
[2:09:43] not talk bad about
[2:09:45] him we see God in each other in what we
[2:09:48] say and the way we talk and our kindness
[2:09:50] one to another our love one for another
[2:09:53] Jesus said so much he says by this shall
[2:09:55] all men know that you're my disciples if
[2:09:57] you have love one for
[2:10:00] another love is forgiving love is kind
[2:10:04] love love suffereth long amen it's not
[2:10:08] boastful it doesn't seek its
[2:10:11] own don't we need a good great big old
[2:10:14] syringe full of I mean a big old syringe
[2:10:17] full I we need a big old syringe full of
[2:10:20] the shot of God God to get rid of our
[2:10:24] selfishness this is a generation of
[2:10:28] self-love it's about
[2:10:31] me huh we know that eternal life is
[2:10:35] living for others not for yourself but
[2:10:37] yet we're living in a very selfish
[2:10:42] age I don't know how to put it I don't
[2:10:44] know how to put it it's despicable it's
[2:10:47] repulsive to Thomas berer to see how to
[2:10:50] go how to the world am me treats the
[2:10:53] Lord how they treat the very God that's
[2:10:56] all around them and they don't even try
[2:10:58] to open their eyes and realize even the
[2:11:01] prophet of God talked about the rotation
[2:11:03] of the Sun and the Moon and how the moon
[2:11:05] holds the tides out if it would go out
[2:11:08] the whole T the whole thing it flood
[2:11:10] over the moon has to say in its place
[2:11:13] and the stars in their place and the sun
[2:11:15] in its place you think it's hot at 95
[2:11:18] with a heat index of 110 yeah it's hot
[2:11:21] but let it get a little bit
[2:11:23] closer and see what
[2:11:26] happens probably at 150 we'd all be dead
[2:11:29] our air conditioners are
[2:11:32] fry hello but it's all held by the
[2:11:36] mighty hand of
[2:11:37] God how many's glad that your world is
[2:11:41] held by the hand of God my life is held
[2:11:45] by the hand of God your life is held by
[2:11:47] the hand of God and why is that because
[2:11:50] God is giving you enough Grace for you
[2:11:52] to surrender yourself and say Lord here
[2:11:55] I am I'm
[2:11:56] yours I'm just a dumb sheep God I need
[2:11:59] your direction I can't do without you
[2:12:02] I'm totally lost without you I I'm
[2:12:05] incapable of making the right choices do
[2:12:07] the right things say the right things I
[2:12:10] always stick my foot in my
[2:12:14] mouth
[2:12:17] huh I need the Lord to help me keep my
[2:12:19] foot out of my mouth
[2:12:22] keep me from saying what I shouldn't say
[2:12:25] let him have the preeminence in my
[2:12:28] life I thank him so much amen that he
[2:12:32] keeps us in that way praise the
[2:12:38] Lord just's a very few
[2:12:40] people that have ever saw God ain't that
[2:12:44] right I think Moses was was uh permitted
[2:12:49] to see the backside of him you can't
[2:12:51] look at me can't see me but you can see
[2:12:53] the
[2:12:54] backside all right brother brandom I
[2:12:57] won't read the story but when he was
[2:12:58] praying for the Salvation of his dad you
[2:13:01] know and he was out and praying and he
[2:13:03] was on his porch I believe it was there
[2:13:06] he had went out in the field and then he
[2:13:07] came back in the house and he was
[2:13:08] praying for the Salvation something says
[2:13:10] get up and go and he got up and went
[2:13:12] back into that broom Sage field and
[2:13:14] there he was
[2:13:16] praying amen and something woke him up
[2:13:19] and not woke him up got him up and he
[2:13:21] looked and he seen Jesus y'all remember
[2:13:24] that the side of him and he said he had
[2:13:26] a he had a robe on he had beard short
[2:13:29] beard like and hair down to his shoulder
[2:13:32] I don't get some ideas now but he had
[2:13:36] his arms
[2:13:37] folded is that right kind of sideways
[2:13:40] brother BR was seeing him sideways and
[2:13:42] he kind of moved around he wanted to see
[2:13:44] him and he never moved he said until he
[2:13:48] said Jesus
[2:13:51] and he said he turned and looked at
[2:13:53] me when he turned and looked at him he
[2:13:55] says the closest description that he
[2:13:58] could give with behalf man's head of
[2:14:00] Christ he said the closest he could but
[2:14:03] he said it would seemed like if he would
[2:14:04] speak he could speak things out of
[2:14:06] existence or whatever is that right just
[2:14:08] so amazing that he he he lost
[2:14:13] Consciousness he found himself woke up
[2:14:16] amen went back to the house and saw him
[2:14:19] he said he was a shorter fell Jesus
[2:14:21] wasn't a tall he was a shorter fell he
[2:14:23] said so he got to see
[2:14:26] him
[2:14:28] amen I don't know about you but we see
[2:14:32] him by faith don't we we see his works
[2:14:35] we see his attributes we see what God's
[2:14:37] doing but we see don't see him face to
[2:14:40] face yet we don't see him eye to eye yet
[2:14:45] but I want to say this in closing think
[2:14:46] about this there's something on the
[2:14:48] inside of us and that that's been born
[2:14:51] Born
[2:14:51] Again These Bars of bone they hold my
[2:14:55] soul ain't that right but one of these
[2:14:58] days what is on the inside is going to
[2:15:00] work its way
[2:15:02] out but's on the inside that Holy Ghost
[2:15:05] that
[2:15:06] fire that man that's been born again
[2:15:08] when he's going to grow and this shell
[2:15:11] so to speak is going to
[2:15:13] crack and it's going to be changed how
[2:15:16] many believe it's going to be
[2:15:18] changed and what's going to happen is
[2:15:21] we're going to fill 1 John 3 and verse 2
[2:15:25] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[2:15:29] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[2:15:32] amen but we know that when he shall
[2:15:35] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[2:15:39] see him as he
[2:15:42] is amen this Jesus that we have in our
[2:15:45] hearts one of these days will become
[2:15:47] visible to us how many believes that
[2:15:52] and he is now in
[2:15:56] us but he shall be with
[2:16:01] us amen every time I've ever preached
[2:16:04] this he says he was with the disciples
[2:16:06] but we got something greater now they
[2:16:08] were with him but now he's in us but I
[2:16:11] want to change it again because it's
[2:16:13] going to change again to being in us
[2:16:17] back to with
[2:16:19] us Revelations 21:3 and I heard a great
[2:16:23] voice out of Heaven saying behold the
[2:16:25] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[2:16:29] shall dwell with them and they shall be
[2:16:33] his people and God himself shall be with
[2:16:36] them and be their
[2:16:39] God stand with me this morning and God
[2:16:42] shall wipe away all tears from their
[2:16:44] eyes and there shall be no more death
[2:16:48] nor sorrow nor crying neither shall
[2:16:51] there be any more pain for the former
[2:16:54] things are passed
[2:16:57] away and he that sat upon the throne how
[2:17:00] many believes he sitting on the throne
[2:17:01] of your heart right now amen and we're
[2:17:04] hearing this and believing this that one
[2:17:06] of these days the things that we believe
[2:17:09] by faith are going to materialize how
[2:17:11] many believe that the Rapture is going
[2:17:13] to
[2:17:14] materialize this body is materially it's
[2:17:18] going to change from mortality to IM IM
[2:17:21] mortality we're going to see like that
[2:17:24] song says oh I want to see him look upon
[2:17:27] his face there to sing forever of his

[2:17:48] able to see him touch him fall before
[2:17:51] him and forever live with
[2:17:55] him
