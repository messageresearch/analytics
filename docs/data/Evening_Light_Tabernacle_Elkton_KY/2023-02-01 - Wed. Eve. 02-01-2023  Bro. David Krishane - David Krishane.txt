brother Tom Christian is the pastor there he's been the pastor there for almost 20 years and we're leaving the same message that God sent a prophet according to Malachi 4 and 5 Revelations 10 and 7. um thank you brother Thomas for inviting us to come and uh you know I was uh on the way here I uh are on the way back to Kentucky I felt kind of LED that I should grab a suit and tell me just just in case they get stranded I didn't feel anything I just felt that I should and then we got stranded and we uh called brother Thomas bother up and we said brother uh I just want to let you know that uh I'm gonna be at your service tomorrow night and I want to know if you guys are starving church I said yes we are and I'm looking forward to hearing you speak so here I am amen you know I certainly counted an honor and a privilege to be here tonight with you all it is the greatest honor in my life to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to sing a special here I got a new battery for the guitar so it'll work this time is it working [Music] follow me crazy you can say I'm a fool I'm not saying it seems sometimes it seems so cruel [Music] but I remember where I I came from [Music] put me through and now I'm sitting with you [Music] you've had a chance to meet some sick [Music] and you've turned me to share more made a record of me now I'm giving to change Jesus foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] laughs foreign [Music] please made a wreck out of me but now I'm giving to Jesus Jesus the time and I'm saying it's all double unseen with her and I'm saying it's over devil I'm saying with you foreign silver Satan we're through and you don't just say that once that is not something you say when you're saved at the altar and then just you know dandelions and lollipops from there you say that every single day after every single mistake devil looks over Satan we're through amen so tonight I'd like to tell my testimony and I'll get into the sermon you know testimony is not just one event it's always growing it's always I guess just getting better some from a byc 2022 and other things like that on the stand we'll turn on our Bibles just one verse tonight we'll be turning to Matthew chapter 26 starting with verse 50. I'm gonna make sure I start my timer so I Don't Preach for four hours foreign there amen Matthew 26 and verse 50. and Jesus wherefore art thou come then they laid him hands on Jesus and took him and Lord has blessings the reading of his wordless bow our heads your gracious heavenly father I come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I thank you for bringing me here safely Lord through all the weather father Lord speak yourself tonight my voice is insufficient but what I do have I give unto you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you may be seated so as I said I'm Brother David Christine from Sweetwater Tennessee been baptized three times in my life once for the father once for the son once for the Holy Ghost I'm kidding I'm okay that's not actually it but the first time I was seven and I was just convinced into it really I just wanted to swim in the pool second time when I was 12 I don't remember why I did that but the third time when I was 13 and um it was the last service or the second the last service and brother Craig was preaching and this touch and I remember coming out of his mouth were the words when you want to be saved or something like that you've got to die out to your own thinking you can't have your own thing anymore you have to die to yourself so that Christ can live in you so then I went to The Altar and said Lord I'm ready to die and then I remember someone came up to me put their hand gently on my back and said when you're asking for the Holy Ghost ghost is not an emotion it's not an intellectual thought all you have to do is ask the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and God will give you what you're asking who saw me and I still remember to this day that April 17 2004 when I when that happened and I uh remember when they baptized me and said Jesus commit and fulfill that commandment tonight not baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I remember going into the water and coming out it was like it was like slow motion and from that time I was different you know but I went back and listened to my time there we go yeah listen to the recording of that sermon but those words that I heard about dying out to your own thing I'll never push this birth you have to go through applying First In The Same Spirit you can actually keep your style like he died you've got to die on his altar like Abel did with the light with his lamb you've got to die with your lamb you've got to die I'm thinking to be born to his thinking let the mind that was in Christ be in you so it wasn't for the Craig before it wasn't even on the recording but that was God himself in that one moment for salvation it's none of them recording but that's what I heard and after that I was a different person I went home and I I obeyed mom and dad not because they forced me to but because something in me was changed something in me baptized I believe I got it right when I was baptized because from that time to say David you were different I obeyed mom and dad because really it's not about an operational Act of do the dishes or do this or do that it's really to keep the house going because it needs to be going because when Things fall behind Everyone Falls behind in their spirit and something in me was changed you know and I believe that uh when you're changed you're different but the band said United under one head well you don't have to be that way Christ died that you might be cleansed from all of those things you might be filled with a bunch of Creeds you might be filled with a bunch of denominations but God don't want you to be filled with that God made a place in there to put himself in God wants you to be filled with himself what takes place when you're filled with when you're filled with God you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're filled with power you're filled with love with joy with peace with long suffering with good this David's you're filled with something I was filled with something but I preached the sermon they're in terms of time I believe there comes time to be in sin a time to be called repent be a baptized name with Lord Jesus Christ it's time to be filled with the Holy Ghost and then there Comes A Time for God to call you to what he wants you to be calling sometime after that I was in a about a year after that I was in a discussion with some friends and the subject of what do you believe when the godhead came up and you know I was related to one of these friends I was close friends with the other and they said well David I believe in they said what do you believe I said well I just believe in God and he said well I believe in God the father and his son the Lord Jesus Christ and at this time I didn't know one scripture one quote off the top of my head contradicting a false Doctrine like that but something they said that's not right and they knew more quotes than me they knew more scriptures than me to try to prove this doctrine that they said was so true they said well tell you what take two weeks study it out and then prove to us how we're wrong in those two weeks I started listening God had explained Mighty God and build before us he was a small kitchen the unveiling of God and I just fell in love with this with this message and it just was so true to me just for the random said it and I believe it you guys believe that he just kind of says it and that's just the way that it was and I was like well great he said Jesus was God not some other person I don't really understand that but I believe it and I went back I was so excited I'm going to show them how they're wrong and then we'll all be great and they didn't do that not at all and then they asked me what about this what about that and it's just I didn't know but it sparked a fire in me it activated something in me and it still has been up and put out to this day and as I went through time it'd be came less and less about some Doctrine to argue and they became well I'd like a life because as I started getting closer to God I would pour over these quotes and these scriptures compiling them by God's grace I think I have it's like 400 different notes of hundreds of quotes of just things pertaining to it and I fell in love with it but the slow Church they started separating themselves from others and now they're uh they're both they're divorced and their lives are in shambles and they no longer believe in this message this message is not about so much about a dark Spirit than to be right in my Doctrine and wrong in my spirit doesn't matter how right they are their lives are in shambles now my your life proves that what you're saying is right yes it wasn't it wasn't about some semantic of a father or a son or whatever else it was about not taking what brother Branham said what this message says and apply bring it to your life and saying it's the truth I don't understand it God said so and that's it but there will always come a feeling of power or feeling of intellectual superiority with any false Doctrine where I've I've saw that you know my dad's my pastor and I know I'm only 22 years old but something in me sees it what my dad sees and I think the doctrines have less to do with some semantic more with getting something over someone else I'm the man because I believe it this way brother Branham said in exposition of the seven Church ages we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifest in flesh and then Jesus felt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby again the time full of sun even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many members spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts it's not manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so-called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore can be reborn because we were seated is the reason we could be quick there is nothing to Quicken hold this carefully in mind I'm going to take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed Blood Bought back his own he brought back the spoke word seed bride my sheep hear my voice word and they follow me you always were a sheep are you never a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of Life produced as we were the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word there had to come anyone who would hear his voice and recognize that we are the sons of God when I heard that Doctrine something in me said that was wrong I believe there was a revelation in me from before the foundation of the world because I knew no knowledge contradicting the two Lord's Doctrine that's what the doctrine is something in me said it's not right they were my friends of mine I wasn't popular with them but some it activated a fire to me to where I go on Facebook arguing all the time I don't anymore don't worry but I used to but there was a fire in me that couldn't be put out went to Dad when I was that when that happened when I was 14 years old I said Dad I've got to preach he was wise so he told me I want you to think about it for a couple weeks and pray about it and then come back to me and of course I didn't and then when I was 16 I told my dad I said dad I don't care if I have to go on a street corner in a nursing home on a Facebook live I've got a fire in me and people are irritated because anytime God's ever mentioned I go on for 25 minutes about the things of God I've got to preach he's like okay all right we'll have you coming we'll have you preaching um remember the first sermon was uh when I went to try to type it up Dad said David I don't know what you're talking about so he gave me a title and then he said David have you heard the rule of Kiss I said what's that he said keep it simple stupid I'm like what he said David do you want the complaint to be that just too simple right and then it's too complicated to understand because I was like okay well I'll do my best he said he gave me the title of without faith that was June 14th 2017 I preached the first term sermon of without faith it's impossible to please God and it was 12 minutes and 38 seconds by God's praying there's been over five and a half years preaching by God's grace thank the Lord I'm 22 Doctrine but it wasn't really that it was a life that lives it's true it's for those of you who do not know the uh I had a sister my sister Amy there's a Facebook page present encouragement for Amy crocheting someone like the way that you are part of that was that uh I did my sister she went in and out of Mental Health hospitals for a little over 10 years and I had to uh that was probably the most consistent one of the hardest trials in my life and there was one point where I went five days without sleep because I was saying it was just going on me but God kept me through it but by God's grace Amy married and uh and a year and a half with no hospitals to praise the Lord for that amen because and you know we could think oh well you know we raised we laid hands on her the first time into it and nothing changed but over 10 years later she recovered you would lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so no matter what it looks like or what changes or what doesn't God will bring to pass his word I believe that one of the most important things that happens to us in order for us to learn is for us to fail and fall I know about you but I make a lot of I've made a lot of real dumb I believe there's no value unless they're suffering unless you've done something wrong you know I uh it seems odd to tell someone about this story but I believe it is good a good thing I once had a real nice 2008 Chevrolet Impala it was black real nice and you know why my dad would tell me David I want you to drive safer I want you to drive slow or don't go on this curve so fast get more sleep before you uh before you drive in the morning the next day and one morning I was a Wednesday night and I preached in this day up too late that so David go to bed and I didn't and um I ran a red light and I got T-boned it totaled the car by God's grace there wasn't hardly even a scratch on me it's a little scratch in my arm that was it and that seems like a it was a disappointing thing but what did it do God said okay I'll let you break your favorite car because God said enough I'm enough with David not driving safe and then it became complacent after that and there was another time when I was going around a corner in my new 2007 Cadillac CTS that I that I had and I uh two earbuds in and I was listening to something I shouldn't have been listening to went around a corner that went to the left and curved and it'll slant and it never went on that before and it was wet fish tailed this way fish tailed that way went into a forest and got stuck I had to replace three four doors the trunk the windows that were just tinted the glass broke in but it was it was like being in a roller coaster because all of a sudden you say David you're done driving stupid you're drunk driving fast I'm gonna put you in a position where now you will never forget that again and I never have so anyway everyone just why does David drive slow that's why yeah that's why I do my best to uh take these things that God puts us through and turn it into a stepping stone you know at a byc in 2012 to after one of the sermons preached by Brother Andrew Glover he said sent by a burden received by a blessing I felt so free and so happy you go to the escamson you're not exposed to the things of the world 24 7. it's just such a blessing and after we went back to one of our dorms they had all the guys in my dorm go out to a campfire and talk with the other guys and it's a really neat thing because where I'm from we don't have any youth to get anywhere with anyone my age I've got to drive about three hours to get within anybody in the message of my age and uh it was a really neat thing but I felt something in my heart that I wasn't dedicated to God enough I wasn't spending enough time with God and I uh I asked my my counselor you know I heard of brother Trevor eamond great guy I said Trevor I don't feel like I'm uh dead doing things would you feel dedicated like what do you mean but if Trevor doesn't just answer the question you want he'll ask you a question he said well you think you've spent four hours a day he asked me how much time per day you spend listening to a tape or studying I told him he said well what if you tripled that then would you feel better what if you spend five hours a day listening to a tape would you feel better then and I said no he said David do you love the Lord I said well yes he said you think I love me yeah of course they said do you think I have a checklist every day that I go by hug her tell her I love her watch the dishes or whatever else tonight no he's like well why I said because you love her you have a relationship with her he said exactly and you have a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ it's not about these acts of operational acts of love it's about a relationship a revelation right there that he wants to turn the message and the the things of the word of God into an operational religion well I'll get up and then I'll pray and then I'll do this and then I'll do all these other things of the world but I hate I prayed once and I read my Bible for five minutes so I'm good for the day just into a operational thing just search two times a week you're fine I especially I've struggled with that in my life I'm the pastor's kid we're raised in the message my dad doesn't have the checklist either he loves my mom and he does the things because he loves her he lives his life in the way that he does because he has a relationship with her and the message is not just about oh if I can listen to tapes for six hours a day if they're gonna read 20 chapters of my Bible every single day then I'll get it it doesn't mean anything if a God isn't in your soul not at all go back to a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ I've had the wrong frame of mind in my life and it comes from the devil will make you make a mistake well you just gotta repent on you be fine and then just spend the rest of your time thinking about the negative things Lord I need you to help me have a positive attitude Lord we have this financial thing Lord I have this thank you Lord for this this thing that I'm asking for Lord please help me you Praise In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ amen and then the rest of your time is filled thinking about how it won't happen how it it happens how it cannot be done that's what Satan wants that's why it said pray without ceasing don't stop in your prayer if I pray that God would give me a Camaro and I start thinking no I can't have it I can't have it I can't have it what's gonna happen I'm not gonna have it but how how much more with the things that really matter Lord help me to feel better Lord help my family Lord with this Lord help me to spend more time with you and then when you get done with the prayer you spend the rest of your time doubting if it'll ever happen that's your flesh we can't save our flesh that's why he said pray without ceasing we need to take God out of an operational part of our life and make it into a relationship I have a relationship with Danny he helps me stuff at the gym I help him stuff with the job that's just the way we do not because we're okay checklist oh I gotta make sure Danny's my friend because I gotta do this check no we're friends that's just how we do it brother Trevor told me David stop religion Inc I'm like what stop religioning it's not about this operational act that's good if you listen to tapes for three hours a day sure but I would rather listen for five minutes of a tape with God and I know this dedicated to God and to say oh well I listened to three hours of a tape every single day and I'm better than everyone else it's not about that it's about a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ he said I encourage you I said well what about when I'm really really busy he said David I would encourage you to talk to God throughout your day you always have your mind and your inner monologue the Bible says pray without ceasing these positive things keep them in your mind without ceasing my dad preached Sunday on seeking occasion Satan wants us to seek occasion to doubt if you seek Caucasian to doubt Satan will always give it to you oh the world's ending oh there's a recession oh I'm running out of money oh there's this and oh there's that Satan will always fit it to you because very similar to the power of God is close the power of the devil because he transforms himself into an angel of Light a Satan will always make you feel just amazing to do anything except the thoughts of God foreign but if we can take the things of God and apply them in a positive manner and just repeat the things of God that'd be a lot better than going into our own understanding but when you say that when you seek occasion also to edify others or to read your Bible or say you know what no matter what I go through no matter how many times my sister tries to hurt herself no matter how many times she ends up in that mental health hospital no matter how many times God will heal her and he did because the only one that could be 10 years late is to be 45 minutes early that's God Time After Time After Time Amy would go in two years into it and she three months no hospital business praise the Lord and then go right back into it again God kept her and not her God kept her through it it's not me keeping myself in the most message it's God I might need more water here in a little bit you know I always love when Satan attacks me makes me feel bad when I'm preaching because I know that he doesn't attack you unless there's something valuable there if you feel negative thoughts against you of any kind I don't care if about how you look your status what you make what you don't make anything if it's negative it's from the devil how do you know brother Thomas how do you know when the devil's lying when he talks when he talks every scripture he says every quote he says everything he ever says doesn't matter how right it seems It's always out of place it's always under context and it's always a lie every single time because even though my sister would be in the mental health hospital and we'd go there and say no you can't bring your phone but I said can I bring a Bible sure I guess no one's ever asked us that but yeah you can bring it and then even though it's screaming in the background of everyone else in the hospital they don't tell you that when you go into a mental health hospital and your sister's there they may shut the door where the rest of the people are but there's a lot of screaming and wailing and it sounds terrible but when I started reading that Bible quiet we went through it Time After Time remember one time Dad called me and it had been like nothing like eight months before Amy went to uh she'd go for four or five days without sleeping and we just try to help her stay safe and she'd been about I think like six to eight months no hospital visits and uh dad gave me a call when I was coming home from working I was about 18 and he told me David Amy left a house again we don't know where she is we're out looking for when you get home you got Ruth my younger sister and Thomas my younger brother when you get there I need you to stay positive and I need you to uh be an example for them because if you don't have the example of a strong mind they won't follow either and then I hung up and then I just started bawling it was hard on me but I said Lord I need you to help me I said no matter what happens whether Amy is in thank you back whether Amy's in in a church in a hospital or wherever she is she's still in the hands of God no matter where it is you know God doesn't love you anymore now and the message they did when you were in the world it's the same amount of love but God said Amy would be all right God said he was wounded for our transcriptions with his stripes Amy was healed ten years later she named a kid after me praise the Lord his name is Caleb David and it's a testimony doesn't matter what you go through no matter what happens God is alive and God will bring you through it why because all this has happened with Amy brought me and Amy and my whole family back to a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ in our text Jesus says friend to Judas that was Judas the one that he was talking to everybody knows which is what Judas is going to do he's gonna betray is the largest betrayal of all time betraying God himself to his face and Jesus looks at that man Judas possessed by the devil and says friend so when saying it's actually in your mind it's a mistake that you've made or some terrible thing you've done should remind yourself that Jesus looks into the eyes of Judas and says friend wherefore art thou come my friend what are you doing here he knew what he was doing there and this is just my belief I believe that that was judas's last chance to turn back I think it was his last chance but he didn't why did why did Jesus do that he's going to condemn him to the most of the most why because he wanted a relationship he doesn't want to condemn people God's not willing that he should perish he wants a relationship he wants you to know that he'll keep you safe and keep you in his love and grace no matter what remember Cain after committing the first murder God tells him what he's done and he says I'll punish you and I'll cast you out and Kane says my punishment's greater than I can bear too bad you did the first murder no we didn't God said I'll put a mark on you so that anyone that attacks you Sevenfold would be turned unto him and there were the saddest scriptures in the whole Bible and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord what if came when it said Lord please I don't know why but something in my nature something in me just wants to kill would you please help me but he wouldn't Scott wanted a relationship remember what Saul did King Saul pulled away at this encampment until I get there by Samuel the prophet Samuel and don't make a sacrifice until I get there the seventh day I'll be there the Bible says that there was I once said the mathematical uh I added up all the soldiers that were there as far as what the Bible says and I looked up what it would mean and approximately if I'm positions are right they were they were outnumbered I believe it was 300 333 to one that means for every one soldier they had there were over three thousand of the enemy surrounded the people were traveling Oh what do we do what do we do everything in the natural was tumbling down and Saul said I have to offer the sacrifice and as soon as he did Samuel shows up and then Saul knows say this wrong he says oh my the servant of God hello how are you but Samuel you offered the sacrifice you weren't supposed to well I had to do something you weren't here when you said you're going to be here he said I don't care is God not in control is God not here I believe that God knew what was going to happen he knew that that the Philistines were going to surround him and be outnumbered but God wanted a relationship with Saul God wanted someone to realize no no matter what you're surrounded with this isn't just about Soul this is about all of us no matter how many demons you're surrounded by no matter what your situation is no matter if the sword was half an inch from slicing Saul in half God would have stabbed his fingers and all of them would have disappeared because God brings his work to pass no matter what thank you but Satan or but Saul got to when my dad calls stinking thinking thinking of it in your own way well we're surrounded we're outnumbered excuses excuses the people are afraid you're the king but Satan got Saul to be thinking about turning God into a religion well God's a good thing to make me the king and yeah we offer the sacrifice and all that but really our strength is in our army our strength to keep ourselves in power but God wanted a personal relationship with Saul God wanted so much with him to where God would intervene in battles when Joshua said Son stand still and also Moon stay over there and then he kept fighting he didn't wait for an emotion he didn't wait for God to speak back to him he didn't check Google to see if it made sense he said Son stand still Moon's they were there and kept God himself God wanted Saul to ignore the proof and the evidence against him and the only thing that sold Focus he wanted the only thing soul to focus on is I have a relationship with God said you keep me safe God said this lamb was mine and I don't care if we're going to be fine same you'll have to wait for him that's what we're going to do no matter what look at Noah you know I had a thought a 120 year mindset what does that mean Noah preached 120 years from no evidence in fact all the scientifical evidence was against him typically prove there's no rain in the sky and it's not going to happen not at all we can shoot the moon with our radar and bring it down that's what they were thinking you know what though what's really neat is the people of the world at the time intellectually they were right through originally they were right but here's the thing reasoning doesn't have to add up with God no it didn't have some big Bible and a bunch of tapes to listen to We had three words or four words it's going to rain and that was it it's all he needed because God says so what about science God said so what about this philosopher this psychology or the speaker God said so and that's all that he needed and why did he preach the same thing with the same intention thing in day one as he did 120 years later because he didn't know in the Rapture I mean the flood was going to happen it's the same as I believe that's the type of today we don't know when the Rapture is going to happen but we still preach come to the truth please with the same intensity because there Comes A Time there came a time when it was too late the sun running it was too late please don't wait till it's too late run back to a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ foreign relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and trusted in God no matter what no matter what he saw no matter what he felt matter against popularity you know I bet there was some people that went to his church they enjoyed his uh spirit and his passion for 20 years maybe even 100 years but they didn't stay right with it well there's no proof all of the evidence of the world is against it so they left science contradicted what God said everything country and they could prove it by science but here's the thing God existed before science God existed before for technology God existed before reasoning the very one that it that that created your ability to fake is the one in control I once worked with a guy that said that he terrible two minutes did well um is that really the I said I had a quarter and I said uh could I could I could God make this if I drop this quarter is it going to fall on the ground every single time he's like yeah and I said could God make this quarter float in the air if I dropped it he's like well yeah I said well what do you mean well what about the Virgin birth he said okay it goes against the laws of nature prefer a virgin birth I said oh wait though you just told me that God could make a quarter floor and float in the air so if God command The Rules of Nature he can do anything right he didn't want to talk to me about religion from that time on you know I don't believe that people will bleed believe something that's wrong because they've reasoned it out in their minds but because they want to sit they they want us to mess around with people they want to smoke and drink and do drugs and and fornication and everything else they and they don't reason against God because they've figured out in their minds they're just defending what's wrong foreign that was it it's gonna rain oh but this oh but that it's gonna wreck imagine I hope my brother said oh well he was trying to convince he said these people of the message I said okay he said I'm trying to find the old document of George Lacy with uh FB I proving the uh the picture and I said well what if they say it's a fake he said what do you mean I said if someone doesn't want to believe something they're not going to believe it no matter what you say he said well I I just can't convince them I said well even if you did would do nothing he's like what he said if I can convince you into it you can get convinced out of it I said you show them the tapes you tell them you don't want to argue and if it doesn't activate a seed in them then that's that's all that you can do because we're not supposed to argue this message that was more and all of us put together all right but it's like well I feel like I'm not good enough to to tell people about Christ and tell people about the message I said well God himself was on earth and the smartest people in the world when it came to religion killed him so yes we should study and yes we should know what to say but if people still reject what you're saying even if you say over and over and over again just you're identified with the Lord Jesus Christ I believe that another way that God develops his relationship with us is by allowing us to fall because if you can't if you don't fall there's no value if I didn't mean for that to happen but if that cap didn't fall there'd be no value in me picking it back up and putting it back on the lid I once heard a speaker say if you're not failing you're not even trying ten thousand failed experiments before the light bulb I believe that making mistakes has sometimes will have less to do with the actual mistake but more with what you do afterwards how do you treat your mistake what will you do with them Saul offered the sacrifice when he wasn't supposed to and he didn't exactly repent you think God really cared that much about when he offered the sacrifice when he didn't or this operational thing what God really cared about is will you do what I say no matter what the circumstances are well you just follow what I say also God wanted to know when you really messed up Saul what are you going to do how are you going to approach it when Samuel comes back and cell realizes is wrong he's like oh would you please worship with me oh I'm sorry I was wrong but could you please worship with me so that can be restored and he's trying to reason his way out of it and then when he was supposed to kill the amalekites God give me another chance I want you to kill the amalekites kill the king kill the women kill the children kill the cattle kill all of them and then the people says oh we can use these things for sacrifice if we can use this for that it's like oh this makes sense stinking thinking again and then Samuel shows up and says hello Saul is like oh hello the servant of the lord it's like you're not a bit of the Commandment of the Lord thy God oh yeah I have obeyed the voice of the Commandment of the Lord but the people said we should spare The Oxen we can sacrifice them but obedience is better than sacrifice Saul he still doesn't get and he still tried to reason it out it's not about some big speech to prove that oh God I'm so sorry but please restore me it wasn't about that Saul didn't have the right kind of a relationship with God God had become a religion an operational act to Saul I'm still thinking thankful that God still restored Saul and Saul will be in heaven amen he appeared that day with us in Paradise is what Samuel told him but I once pushed a sermon what were your testimony be in heaven Saul is glad he's in heaven but does he regret doing that God wanted a relationship with Saul God wanted to just do what he asked kill a gag all of his people all of the but it doesn't make sense it's not supposed to make sense actually it's supposed to not make sense because it's God God's not supposed to make sense to us in order for us to do what he says it doesn't make sense that the the major prophet of the age of the seventh grade education guy but that's just the way God does it it didn't make sense for God to come down in just a uh forgot to come down in a stable he was supposed to come in it's better relation ship with the Lord Jesus Christ you know David made a mistake with Bathsheba King David had in Psalms because my name is David brother bam said that your your name is an impact and a character I would say that how many agree with what David did was a whole lot worse than what Saul did with Bathsheba David David the Bible says at the time when kings go forth to battle David stayed sees Bathsheba and then she gets pregnant and then he tries to Uriah to go with her maybe Uriah doesn't have loyalty to David David plans for and then he has Uriah killed you know that's him that's really bad thinker buried to offering sacrifice at the wrong time but then what was the difference though why why did God treat David differently than he did with Saul foreign and David said unto Nathan after Nathan shows David you were wrong this is what you did you did this your call what what does David say I know I've seen against a little bit could you please help me I'm so sorry could be reason to sound really yeah sinned against the Lord no explanation no transcend to David the Lord also has put away that sin Thou shalt not die what was it it was David's attitude I didn't want to say you're wrong you're lost forever I'm just going to kill you and that's done mistake that David made and restore David back to a relationship with him and he was able to do it because David said I've sinned against the Lord what do you think would happen if Saul would have said I have sinned against the Lord and that's all that he said a lot of times this is not about all all the things that we can say but rather than I was wrong I'm sorry David's identity was not anybody had done wrong but what God's said he was you're not in our mistakes it's not in our flesh it's what God said we are it's what the message says that we are we are Sons and Daughters of God no matter what you know my Dad recently I'll bury my dad a little bit here he read the Bible twice all the way through 2022 twice just start out his day and I'll read a whole bunch of it that wasn't because he was trying to impress anybody I'm trying to make a name for himself but because he realized you know he used to read it when he went before he went to bed but then he started doing it the first part of his day and he realized that it really put a big he put a big uh impact on his life it was out of love to God he's not he wasn't he wouldn't even tell anybody if I didn't tell people about it and it was a relationship that he had with the Lord Jesus Christ that's why he did it musicians please come on up you know I want to take these last few minutes I want to expose Satan for a few minutes about something that Satan uses on all of us to try to keep us down I want to talk a little bit about mistakes my dad preached a sermon a while back what will you do with your opportunity I'd say what will you do with your mistakes we're all going to have them what would you do I wrecked the two nicest cars I've ever had but what would I do with that turn it into a test imony drive slow there not a good idea and in that moment when I was stuck there and I was just there God made me with no neuroticism I wasn't surprised I wasn't scared I just was bummed out I was just well this is going to cost a lot of money this is really annoying and then I drove a lot carefully from then on but it was a mistake but what would you understand Oneness we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them but you see it's following his rules following what he said do stumble and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real true servant if he'll stumble he'll get up again if he wobbles God pulls him right back to the in the path as long as he's in the path of Duty but if he's off of the path of Duty God's not obligated to him but as long as he's in the path of Duty God's obligated to him knowing that he's just a man or a woman he's obligated to that person as long as they're on the path of Duty mistakes are about getting you out of the lines of fighting Satan got King David when David the Bible says when David when kings go forth to battle that's when Satan got David David stayed when kings were supposed to go forth to battle mistakes are always about making the mistake is about Satan wants to get you in a loop Temptation mistake guilt Temptation mistake guilt and get you to feel unworthy here's a big thing we're not supposed to feel worthy we're supposed to feel like we can make it and like we've really done right in fact I'd say we're supposed to feel unworthy because Jesus died for us sorry at my church I have Jesus on the right side so I'm used to doing that Jesus on the left side here I believe mistakes are there where Satan will try to make your identity with your mistakes but they're also there so that you can fall so that you can become a stronger again with God so God can restore you back to our relationship with him why would we have guilt when Jesus already paid for every mistake and every wrong we ever did when you make a mistake you repent and say God I'm so sorry God please help me I want to start a brother ready biscal preacher sermon the value of the flaw the flaw is the thing that gets you back to God over and over and over again God please help me God please be with me Paul said Cindy came exceedingly sinful you know armor is not just designed so that you'll never get hit it's designed so that when you do get hit it won't pierce your skin but you'll feel the impact but you can get back up again and keep on fighting just last quote and I'll uh I'll close the exposition of the seven shirts changes remember this Christ is the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts The Book of Revelation shows us pilot making them look warm and formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discredible discrediting of God's word write down he fights that he cannot stand he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and she will will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the frame work of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert but we love it true revelation Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them how many have made mistakes in the past week would you please stand up stand up if you made a mistake in the past week how many have done something they knew was wrong we didn't anyways obviously both hands how many are still fighting how many are still in this message regardless Invincible doesn't mean you never get hurt it doesn't mean you never fall it means that every time you you ever fell and I believe that I'm not looking at a will be invented well do you still believe in the message brother did you make mistakes though so did I but you're still fighting right you're an invincible Army invincibly means no matter what Satan did no matter how many mistakes God always restored you back to a relationship with him this is that's the sermon tonight is going back to a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you the time foreign Lord I love you [Music]
