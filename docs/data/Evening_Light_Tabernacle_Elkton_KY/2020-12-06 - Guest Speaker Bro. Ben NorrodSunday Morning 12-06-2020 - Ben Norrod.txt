holy name amen you say praise the lord this morning hallelujah hallelujah all right let's stand together get right into the preaching of the word i just love to worship the lord but the word's more important and i could go on like that all day long singing one song after another and anybody that knows me knows i love to sing and play and worship god but thank god we got a bible this morning we can look into thank god we've got a text we can read and we got a message we can bring thank god for it amen if you got your book with you now second timothy chapter three i'd like to look at verse 1 the lord helping us and i i want to read several verses god willing and uh what i want to try to do if the lord will help me is i want to speak to you on bride war bride war sounds like an odd subject on it but uh there is a bride war going on and i don't mean just ebride but i mean the bride there's a bride and bride going on in warring right now and uh different ones are calling themselves the bride in this day but there is one she is the real one she is the elected predestinated one she's the one that god's got his hand on and will continue to have his hand on and i believe somehow we are part of that program and wouldn't be sitting here today amen and i'm not going to believe we're on the other side of it i'm going to be on the good side of it ain't that right now second timothy chapter 3 verse 1 before we read before i forget i almost failed to mention this pray for me i go the 11th i have a dye test done on my eyes they found some diabetic retinopathy in my eyes from high sugars and things and and i will say that the lord's already touched my body in many different ways and things are changing in a way that i can't even begin to explain to you but i need the lord's help in it because i started having a little issue with that right eye just a bit and um some swelling has set up in that eye and i've got some possible he said maybe some possible bleeders in the left eye but what was funny about that and i was kind of laughing to myself at how good the lord is i went to one guy when he first diagnosed it he looked in the left eye and he said well you got hemorrhaging all over that eye and jonathan you know he lives right across the street from me i mean literally i walked to his house in 10 seconds and probably less than that trippy told us across the street and um i was staying out in the yard didn't know what to do and i said well you got to preach across the street from your dummy call him you know that's just mine how you think so i rang him i said come out here and pray for me he did and uh i felt like the lord moved for me well within about 12 days after that visit i went to this specialist and he said maybe i suspect you might have maybe some bleeders in that left eye so i feel like the lord's already moving but listen folks i don't know how to say this and please please please i know i know you'll probably mean best and you'll want to help me and you'll want to offer me every vitamin every piece of advice you can give me just pray for me please and understand this when i tell you this the bottom line is this is a battle i've got to win and it's been something i've been up against for eight years and i haven't done very good at winning it i've had victories i've had losses i've had on either side of it but i want you folks to i got confidence in y'all's prayers i really do and i believe if you pray for me i believe the lord will help me in it and will you pray for me will you do it thank you i can't lose my eyes i got i got too many things going on i need them amen i got people to preach to and i got scriptures to read and and you say well are you better than the apostle paul no no i'm really not if god chose to let me have trouble like at the rest of my day that'd be all right but i don't want it to be self-afflicted either amen amen i want the lord to help me with it all right now that i got y'all feeling so happy let's read the bible second timothy chapter three verse one bright war this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come and we know that word perilous actually means dangerous dangerous times shall come now let's look and see what's dangerous about this age for men shall be lovers of their own self covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traity heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god good lord what a wicked bunch that's awful ain't it uh read one more verse y'all getting it having a form of godliness so you mean to tell me these people we read about the church folk that's exactly what it is now on the outside they should you know they show forth a good image or some kind of a spiritual type way about them but really on the inside all of this stuff is hiding in there now listen you folks ain't always been christians you've been out in the world before haven't you haven't you ever heard people say that church people are the meanest people you ever meet in your life you don't think so ask a waitress she's the one that knows when we get done at them restaurants we don't never leave her the right kind of tea for him we let we leave all kinds of messes under the table oh god you're getting quiet already and yet you women walking under that long hair and them long dresses on and you men that make a lot of money or make enough money you don't even drop a dollar on the table because you know you just don't believe in that sort of thing but you do believe in wrecking the place and walking out with that long hair and long dress following you you know it ain't right it ain't right what do they say when they walk out them christian people are the worst the bible said so because on the outside they put forth a good front but all of this brother brad is hiding right down inside of that heart right there if they're not born again of the holy spirit that's what you're looking at with people in church traitors heady high-minded lovers on and on and on and on and on and having a form of godliness amen bride war let's pray lord jesus we love you so much father it's a privilege to be here in the house of god lord as we bow our heads to you we already feel the anointing of the holy spirit in this place and we know you have been with us from the very opening scripture that was read from the opening prayer as lord you promised where two and three are gathered you'll be right there in the midst of your believing children and the saints of god and father we're praying now that you'll come and take this text and these words and things that i've assembled here by the best of my ability lord i do what i can to follow what i believe is you but lord i trust you that if you need to speak something that ain't on this paper in front of me you take my mouth lord my mind my thoughts i yield it to you to use any way you desire lord may you edify us our coming together and may the holy spirit now grant to us your favor heal all the sick and afflicted be with everyone streaming online those will see the service later at some point maybe lord if they can't join us at this very moment say they've got a need lord god may the same holy spirit fall two hours from now as it would fall right now in the service and may your anointing just go right through that channel and bless everyone in divine presence that will come under the auspice of the word now as we commit this to you now both speaker and listener in the name of jesus christ amen and amen and all the saints said amen god bless you may be seated now hold your bible right there ii timothy don't get too far from you now because we're going to really really dig on this part right here and by the way when i went to get my eye test done the other day with my glasses on which i just got a slight stigmatism that girl said well i don't know what the big deal is you're reading 20 20. hallelujah anyhow we we thank the lord that whenever we have the opportunity to look at scriptures like this that we don't have to be in the dark about it that there is a true understanding of what it is that we're reading because of the visitation of this last day and because of the message of the hour we can look at these scriptures like this and have a clear understanding about what it means to you and i because i do believe with all of my heart that what we are seeing unfold around us and not just in the world on the outside but what we're seeing unfold even in the ranks of the church is everything that paul prophesied to us and this is prophecy about what would take place in the last days and the condition of man's heart and the idea that he has about uh you know humanity and life and love and politics and all that he is is just it's just going to bleed into every area of life whether it be in church whether it be in politics whether it be in whatever it is and uh you know when uh as some folks know uh you know brother brad he's worked in some political arenas before and he knows that you know it's the type of person it's not the politic it's the person that's behind the thing as to whether they're going to be genuine and they're going to have a real conviction about something and of course you go up so high with that and as brother branham said you could put like an abraham lincoln or somebody in the office now and because people are so evil in their heart and they entertain that so deeply no matter what you would say about it the devil has so legalized sin and made it such a on the front in the beginning in your face type deal that it would be almost impossible to squash out many of these unrighteous things that we see unfolding before us today in politics and in religion all these different arenas so we know that the reason of this is is the same as it was in the days of noah that the imagination of of every man and every woman their thoughts their intentions their ideas their mindsets was upon as the bible said evil continually day and night now paul gives the contrast to that when he tells you and i that what several things are lovely whatsoever things are holy whatsoever things of good report to think on those things and that word that he uses their thank in the greek is logismo which means to calculate to compute to reckon to count not just once but to do it again and again and again and again and again so if you have something of good report you should meditate on it you should think on it day and night it should be at the forefront of your mind rather than all of the politics and all the scandals and all those other i think what we're going to find out one of these days is that the majority of the things that we have seen transpire in just 20 20 alone has been the product of evil men with all of this inside of their heart that are trying to sway the world in a direction toward the marking of the beast i mean let's just be honest all it took was for one virus now listen you we've heard about the cold war and some of we uh you know some of us we lived through the time of the cold war i'm a 70s baby so i come up during the time when reagan and all them guys were working on all that and and you know we hear about russia and their bombs and we read those quotes by the tom about russia's got a a a bomb with our name on us got our number on it but we don't wake up of a morning and throw on a mask and sanitize our hands and go around in mortal fear that somebody's going to push the button we don't worry about those type of things because to us it's not really that kind of reality but all it took was one virus to get out one respiratory virus to get out amongst the public and circle through the world and the entire world went on lockdown within a few weeks time and brother that lets you know that the coming of the lord can be so quick and all of the events of prophet prophecy can come together so quickly that you may not think to yourself oh well there's no way that this could happen and that could happen and all there's got to be a woman vice president and a woman present and there's got to be this that and the other and let me tell you something when god pulls the trigger on this thing it will move so quickly it'll make corona look like it's standing still because all of the events of life are are are propelled forward in a certain direction and brother joe god's got an image in his mind of what the end looks like and what the last moment looks like and all the events are working toward that moment amen don't ever forget the lord jesus still has all of this world and everything around us right in the palm of his hand amen he's got the whole world in his hands absolutely right and then you look at the arena of politics and you look at the elements of all the politicians and you know of course all of them have got the answer amen and when trump was in and he was at the forefront of the thing you know he had all the answers and when obama was there he had all the answers and when reagan was there he had all the answers and when clinton was there he had all the answers they all got the answer to a problem that they never can seem to fix and you understand why that is because god is allowing it to remain in such an utter confusion that the only way it can ever be straightened out is for one supernatural leader to step on the forefront and to take control of the whole thing and that's what's being set up in rome right now as we speak amen that pope sitting over there may not be the guy because the bible tells us that the pope the beast that will rise up to take over the world economy to take over the world system it'll rise up out of the united states did you see what happened the other day they just got through putting i think it was eight or ten cardinals from the united states of america in a position to where if something happens to this pope they can elect from that pool of cardinals don't forget what brother bannon said and acts of the holy spirit 1954 that one day a pope would rise up out of the united states it's according to prophecy he said revelation 13 11 that that beast would rise out of the earth which is the united states 13 stars 13 stripes 13th chapter and it would raise up to take over all now now the people will say our politics have failed and our governments have failed and we can't seem to find resolution about anything but remember when this man rises up the bible said in the book of daniel that he will cause craft or manufacturing to prosper what a better time for them to step in on something like right now when manufacturing has taken such a hit over this little demonology thing resort somebody when all of the world economy has taken such a bus all it takes is for mr biden president-elect to get in there and hot shot himself around and shut us down for about another month and we are completely bankrupt we never survive another time i don't think what a better situation for mama to step right in and say we'll pay your bills we've got all the money you need to pay you out of debt we'll take care of you oh sure she will for an exchange of course as economists one of the first rule of economics and if you've ever done it in college young people or older people middle age if you ever been a college folk took economics what is rule number one there is no such thing as a free lunch somebody pays the piper somewhere and i guarantee they've got our answer all right but it comes at a heavy price you won't be able to buy nor sell unless of course you are supportive of their agenda and can't you see what's taking place right now look at the attitude people have if you dare go in public without a mask on and then the ones that's got a mask on they're on the other side of it you look at the attitude of people they are coming to such a unified way of thinking now friend whether you wear a mascara don't worry about it that's up to you i do where it's a bunch of come walking in the office tom's center looking at me now you can wear one sure no problem but the guy that don't think you should wear one he's got a clan too he's got a group that thinks you're completely out of your mind uh and then the other side going i can't believe they won't follow the cdc another group saying they're a bunch of nonsense all it takes is for this virus or some kind of situation to get bad enough that it causes both sides to unify and they will drop all of their pettiness especially if it means their money lord you all are getting quiet now you do listen to tapes right read books william branham you know him don't mountain okay because all this i'm talking to you about it's coming right out of the message i don't know now remember these things that are going to transpire is the same as it was in the days of jesus you remember pilate and herod historically speaking not even biblically historically speaking pilate and herod hated each other so deeply that it's never been recorded to have a more bitter revi uh a rival except for maybe the hatfields and the mccoys they absolutely so despise one another that even the name of the other was said to cause them to spit on the ground and yet when jesus stood before him and pilates all you know what the bible said that there was an alliance or a friendship made between pilate and herod because of jesus a common cause caused them to drop all of their politics and their this that and the other and come together as one against this one lord jesus christ claiming to be the messiah the king and the jews it caused them to so unify amen until these two men that hated each other found a mutual advantage in destroying the life of jesus christ you know the world is heading there you know why because they're getting a mind and they're getting a mind that comes directly from the devil himself the bride is getting christ's mind don't you think so i mean i sure hope that's what all this church and this preaching's about i hope we're not just sitting here warming up his pews and just doing a little religion for the day i sure hope and believe in john i hope the idea is that when we're sitting here that we're getting just a little bit more of the mind of christ than what we had before i'm sure believing that's a purpose what do you all reckon happens when people watch a new movie or read something in the paper don't you realize what's happening the message and the mind of the devil is being communicated in shaping people's thinking this it's not that you can't pick up a newspaper and uh you know i mean we're not careful we're going to be cursing everything's going to be the devil before we get out of here this is the reason in the token brotherhood said to throw out newspapers and to throw out television the idea wasn't that the television itself is going to send you to hell but in other words stop being such a ponzi to it or a patsy which one that's yeah that's the word quit believing everything you read and hear oh you're getting quieter and quieter buddy i know you got you thinking i know i'm not where i need to be i'll just you don't have to answer me but how many of you during the during the actual shutdown during quarantine the more you read the news the more scary it got oh there's a few of you want a minute joe i'm with you boy i mean you got to look you think what in the world is going on i wondered are we on the eve of the tribulation period you did too don't you look at me like that we got all of these quotes laying here from brother adam if there was any group at all that was wondering what was going to take place next it was this bride i guarantee you that especially with this woman vice president coming up it makes everybody start going what's going on huh and all of that was projected to us where from the bible from the pulpit did you get your fear because you come to sunday church or brother tom said oh church i don't know what we're going to do did you read that from where where peter said glory to god church we're hopeless you won't find such things as that word of god you sure didn't get it from the pulpit you sure didn't get it from the servants of the lord and you didn't get you didn't get that way by pushing play where did them thoughts come from hello come from the devil satan was implanting his mind and his influence upon you and i and oh because we're all connected and alone together our minds pretty much in sync oh there's a cloud all right but it ain't got nothing to do with microsoft google dropbox or nothing guys it's a cloud all right it's one of them dark ones and he's got everything he needs stored in that all you got to do is tap into some of the media now friends i'm not telling you to take a shotgun to your television i'm not trying to tell you to throw your cell phone the bottom of the lake but be mindful be aware of what's taking place around you because i'm going to read you some things in just a little bit you'll understand a little bit more why i'm preaching the way i am this morning but i'm going to read you some things in a moment that'll show you that all of this that's going on around us is on purpose don't kid yourself every agenda that shows up out of washington the devil's got a reason behind pushing it all right praise the lord now notice again let's go back to second timothy chapter three are you all right everybody okay anybody need to take a break go outside catch some breath come in okay all right good stuff hang in there with me then now watch again for this sword are they which creep into houses and lead captives silly women laden with lust led away with divers uh with sins rather led away with divers lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth so they've got that ability where they can learn and learn and learn and learn to learn the prophet said the prophet said the bible said the bible said the prophet said the bible said the bible said but they're never able to come to the real knowledge of it which this particular word knowledge is an intimate relationship it's more than just being acquainted with it by reading it's actually having an affinity with that which you are reading or a relationship with jesus christ to make it very simple because once you have that relationship or that knowledge of the lord in your heart then there's nothing in this bible you can read that that confuses you you may not understand it but you won't be confused you won't be standing on your head wondering what tomorrow is god will have your answer because you're a child of god and not say you won't wonder about things ponder them but the lord is never if you've really got the holy ghost this morning every one of us me included can testify i can't think of one time he's ever left me alone not once i can't think of one time that i ever really wanted to know something or desire to know or to see something in the word of god that eventually it didn't come down my pathway so god has got our answer if we allow him to lead us and teach us praise the lord we don't want to be ever learning but never able to come to a knowledge you read the bible of the morning or you sit down the coffee table and and you know you got your your your espresso or whatever you like to drink and you're sitting with your book open don't just read them words and say well now praises let me remember how did paul say that exactly ask yourself the real question how can i apply this to me what does this mean to me what's the lord trying to show me out of this particular verse right here that's what you call applying intimate knowledge it's more than just reading the text it's knowing it in a very very plain way now notice again and as janus and jamboree's withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds represent reprobate concerning the faith now you know i wonder sometimes where did paul get the authority to call these names moses never called their names where'd he get the idea the big idea him daring to call the magicians names in egypt well i reckon since he was a prophet of god and he had open vision himself i reckon he was allowed to call a few things of course some people probably put up a website and this day about it praise the lord right drop down to verse 13 but evil men and seducers shall get better and better and better it shall be so good you'll never hear of him again again come on now come on now you tabernacle folks preach to me huh what's your bible say worse and worse that just don't mean worse one time that means every day getting worse and worse and worse at what point did y'all think it would get better if the devil is coming to full power at what point did you think this was going to get increasingly better raise the lord somebody right because it cannot get better if the fact is that it is the very nature of the character of the devil that we just read about traitor heady high minded all that stuff you read it comes straight from the devil it's what he was in heaven he was heady he was high-minded he was a lover of pleasure more than he was a lover of god he wanted a big beautiful kingdom better than that and michael he wanted to worship to himself every characteristic we just read that come right straight from their daddy incontinent fierce don't get much more fierce than the devil talk into robbing a bank and then call the law on you for robbing it the kind of person is he's fierce all of that nature all of that characteristic is being projected down into the lives of human beings and they are simply reflecting the life of what they've come from plainly said the shame of it is it's not going to get better because if god is fully expressing himself today the devil has got to do the same exact thing he's got to express himself fully in some way or another because remember the last day bribe when she goes out of here she will not be an infant girl she will be a mature full-grown woman come on somebody and so this other bride can't be a little girl either she's got to be mature as well praise the lord now watch the word seducers here is the word goes which is actually spelled almost like an english word ghost g-o-e-s but it means a deceiver an imposter or a juggler so evil men and jugglers will get worse and worse well you know what a juggler is on you they're a person that has learned how to take so many balls or bowling bins or whatever it is and so they have just a few moments that they put a little emphasis on that one spot and then they let it go they grab another one put some emphasis and let it go grab another one put some emphasis and let it go and they've learned how not to put too much emphasis on one thing but just keep things moving all along always in motion never stopping seducers are very very good at juggling the truth never placing emphasis more than needs to be before moving on to the next subject for example when they come to church and they tell you that you need to get born again they glance the subject and move on to the next part they never preach in a way that gets the people quiet let me tell you what we need in this message we need some preachers that learn how to shut people up and get them quiet and get them thinking you don't need to kind of preach let me tell you something no man of god is really going to do credit to you or benefit your life will be somebody that you go to church and listen to and you can sit there and feel comfortable the whole service if he did that he's not a preacher he's a hireling he's a god called man at some point in the service you ought to feel a little uncomfortable somewhere because holy ghost fire is hot hello y'all it should be hot when he preaches it should be hot when he gets into your conscience and he works on you in such a way not just placing gentle emphasis upon well we we need to live live right and and you know real bride are saying yeah preach that get down to that talk about holiness man we need it right here and then he's on to the next subject anybody ever had a preacher like that in her life i have i've been associated with a bar shop they don't know how to get out there and really put the heat where it belongs to preach a service on nothing but repentance and try to get the people down the business and praying to get through to the holy ghost and to get right with god you well you can't do that and juggle all them other issues if you're going to really do something for the people in this day and age you've got to be a man that knows how to get off the subject quickly because of course in this day and age if you stay on a subject too long you might make somebody mad god forbid what a brand new concept i must be experienced in the last several years people get mad in church it's a new thing for me the fact is you're supposed to come to church and get your feathers ruffled every now and then come on somebody gonna sit there and look at me church preach to me you're not supposed to come to the house of the lord and feel comfortable the word should be so direct that it feels like it's personal even though it's not even though it's not the word should be so direct that it feels personal that's when it'll do you some good because you know it's easy for people to stand up here and read the bible and read quotes and over to god jesus is his savior and jesus is a healer and he's all that but if people don't have a right attitude i don't care what god is he can't touch them until they get their attitude straight now so the holy ghost i mean if they come walking in the house of the lord and they feel like there's some little elitist little thing you know most of you probably know i've told you this different times i've been teaching chinese kids uh how to speak english overseas online and i always know the little free madonnas that show up in the classroom i i know them i can almost tell them they're just light church people they're the ones if you're preaching and you look down at them oh heaven help you you looked at them when you said that well i gotta look at somebody it might as well be you unless you want me to preach to the lights up there get saved lights they can't they can't feel conviction that piano can't feel conviction but you can and maybe the holy ghost had the preacher look at you because you needed to be looked at whoo but the word should be so direct that it should feel personal even though it's not that's why real god called pastors god bless them they've got a real task on their hand because you imagine they got to come to church and make people feel like that pastor was coming down on them and then they got to get up the next service and do it all over again and then you got to kind of pet on the sheep a little while and get them back into the humor and then make them mad again god bless you brother tom [Laughter] and sometimes you don't even mean to step into them landmines but the holy ghost is a discerner of our thoughts and our intentions and he knows how to take that word and taper and tailor that word in a way that will go right down to whatever is hiding inside that heart no matter what the outside may look like no matter what the form may be come on now god knows what's hiding inside of our hearts so the juggle issues well i've actually heard preachers say they would never say it publicly of course this is just preacher talk at the table but i've actually heard preachers say i don't read those quotes because it might upset people i said why don't you read it all just read it all i mean if i believe this man was a prophet why don't i just read it all oh well he made a mistake there so i'll read that somewhere there's got to be a place he corrected i can read that one too right if i read that one i can read the other one huh what about the one where he said he lied oh but people might think something wrong against brother bannon like what he was a human being and he needed to repent and stay right with god uh-huh you see that's what we've done we have juggled so many issues and we do it as parents we do it as husband and wife that's some man married to some girl i mean he might think you know the uh what was it the teeth like a flock of sheep and the neck like a swan i guess that's compliments in 2020 i think you probably get slapped [Laughter] hair like a flock of goats and all that you'd have to find you'd have to find an updated version of that i think but get some girl like that and boy she knows how to work the system or get some man who is a manipulating gaslighter who knows how to manipulate that woman right down to the core sure juggle the issue why not stand up to it hey sister if he spends too much money why not just tell him he does brother she pouts too much why not just tell her tired are you pouting get out of the business talk the truth oh god half of you trying to run out the back door already stay put stay put why not be honest about things it's because a lot of times what we want to do is is juggling is a lot easier to deal with than actually facing an issue for preachers it's a lot more lucrative see i'm the dumbest evangelist on the planet you didn't know that did you but places that i have been that have put a lot of money in my pocket i've went in there and i've preached hard rough and rude and been mean downright mean because holy ghost told me to be mean and instead of keeping things going and then of course keeping the paychecks rolling if you want to call them paychecks or the offerings or whatever you want to say i go in and preach myself out of a job i'm the dumbest evangelist that ever walked the face of this planet but to me the word is more important than compromising and juggling an issue just because of how somebody can bless you i figure my father owns a cattle on a thousand hills he'll have some sinner pay my debts off if i need it jugglers juggle this chocolate rather than be men of god and stand up to the issue don't you realize that's why the world hates this man william branham because when you listen to them tapes he don't cut women no slack they don't cut to men by none either they're acting like a jezebel he calls him a charity bell that that man's acting like an ahab he just calls it right out i like that kind of preaching at least i know where i stand but seducers jugglers watch us in the rising of the sun he said now there's been churches churches brides brides churches brides brides and he said there's got to come one hallelujah says there's got to come a real bride one that's got not only the mechanics but the dynamics to make the church live and move in the power of the resurrection so here you have two brides set up one claiming with a form of godliness i am the bride of jesus christ and you got the authentic one standing there claiming the same thing both of them are mechanical oh believe me when they quote the scripture they're going to go they're going to do their best to quote it right and one ride will probably know more than the other bride someone might even be smarter huh even have signs and wonders you say brother ben that's ridiculous cain was more scientifically advanced than his little farmer brother abel don't forget that smartness and doesn't always mean that god's behind it the children of this world are a lot wiser than us as saints they have no uh they have no reservations if it comes to splitting atom they don't even stop to talk to the lord about it they just split the thing their wisdom comes from the from the ability to just throw caution to the wind and do whatever they want to they don't seek for the will of god and wait on the lord for the reality of what the consequence would be it's like i believe with all my heart and forgiveness if this sounds like a political statement i believe all my heart this virus is broke out in a a laboratory something that got away from them i believe that with all of my heart if maybe the men that have been behind that if they'd have stopped and prayed a little bit maybe the road would have been right to help humanity or do something to fight some kind of dreaded this that or the other maybe they'd have stopped and said lord what shall we do about this and god would say whoa don't you touch that but the children of this world they don't care about things like that comes to experiment on a human body they had to create laws to keep folks from doing studies that were completely unethical and damaging to the human body the world power had to put a stop to human beings from conducting studies on human participants without the consideration of their mind their body and their safety that's how cruel people are don't believe it look at nazi germany oh you say that was them read feast of the trumpets and listen what brother brahman said he said the same spirits that attack him jews in nazi germany are the same devils coming against you and i here today same spirits politically driven sure economically driven absolutely religiously driven 100 now notice let's go to exodus chapter 7 verse 10 now and let's look at the scene that paul brings up here everybody doing all right praise the lord so glad joe's with us this morning i wouldn't have no amens if he wasn't here bull and i y'all are just looking at me somebody [Laughter] watches exodus chapter 7 verse 10. and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did as the lord had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and before his servants and became a serpent then pharaoh called the wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of egypt and they did in like manner with their enchants enchantments for they cast down every man is rod and they became serpents but aaron's rod swallowed up their rods all right now let's let's take ourselves out of 2020. okay let's transport ourselves back in time to this moment all right now you don't know what's in moses hand you don't know what's in aaron's hand you've never seen this before this is the first time that any of this has ever taken place it's never happened before in the events of human history and you are standing on the sidelines in egypt and you watch this 80 old 80 year old man walk up there that boy on his hip and here he is walking up and two little crooked sticks in their hand and aaron of course who's a prophet to god which moses was god and aaron was the prophet what the lord told him you be god and marry and be your prophet he'll talk for you and aaron walks up and now thus saith the lord and throws his staff down it becomes a stick you've never seen this before you don't know what's getting ready to take place at the very moment he does that pharaoh starts cackling you think that's something hey y'all boys come show them something they're throwing their rods down becoming serpents just like what aaron did at the very beginning you might have went wow what's taking place here what's going on remember you've never seen this before and now the magicians are doing the very same thing all right even like tabernacle i want to ask you how are you going to call this ball game which one are you going to take a stand for you don't know nothing now except for what you're looking at all you can see is what's transpired before your eyes so which one is the true and which one is the false now the truth of the whole situation lay not in the beginning not in the middle but the whole truth laid at the end praise the lord because the true manifestation of what was real remember an enchantment can't has no digestive system sorcery has no real teeth and these men ever how they was able to manipulate they might have had gases they might they don't tell them what they've done to be able to perform what they did the bible said it happened that's all i know is it happened but when it come to actually being able to manifest that what was on the inside was also a snake there was no way in the world that they could manifest truth because all you were looking at was a form of godliness a cloud that was empty without any water in it and when aaron's rod begins to eat up these other snakes you know what it proved it goes to prove that the manifestation of what what aaron was saying was god because that wasn't no pretend snake it was a snake because god don't make pretend somebody should have had a holiday man on that one god don't make fakery god is no magician that's why he don't do miracles for the sake of funding around and just just putting on a show for people religion miraculous those powers of god they are not for entertainment they've got a purpose behind them and you know what happened to those other snakes well they was bottled up in aaron's rod praise the lord so here you've got in type two brides which one are you going to believe if you look at it from the beginning you're going to see one view if you look at it in the middle you're going to see another view but wait to the end of the story and you will know who the real one is this is the principle that's being shared with us in this book now watch here in israel in the church brother baby said now joseph was sold for almost 30 pieces of silver by his brothers the jewish church betrayed joseph today what is it in the church a betrayal now surely you all don't think that you know that our greatest betrayal is going to come from the religions out there now if you do please change your thinking because that is not where our greatest betrayal is going to take place but really if it was the brothers of joseph that did the betraying it wasn't the outside folk it was the inside folk the greatest betrayal of saints of god is going to come from those that call themselves saints god if y'all get any quieter i'm wondering huh oh but they say their bride sure at the beginning they can say that remember it's not he that begins the race it's the guy that finishes it that makes the difference all of them have a voice in the beginning but keep following on watch again he said i keep this in their in your mind they are going to have a confederation with all of their churches he said they're already here in america they're already he said confederating together and they're going to have a band here that will someday fight communism it'll hook up with catholicism the protestant church the catholic together and those inner denominations who stood for the truth that's y'all if you didn't know he said and got away from the dogma they've got will be persecuted the mark of the beast the seal of god the showdown will come soon he said brother that's not there you'll be deceived just as sure as the world how about the holy ghost he said now notice he said they'll make an agreement and bring all christianity should christianize the world back and it will look so good people will chop into it they'll confederate the churches to try to make christianity one unit well of course they will because christianity is so blasted divided friends is no joke it is you can't get one baptist to set down from another branch of the baptist and agree on nothing come on don't y'all look at me that way you can't get hardly two message people to sit down let them agree on anything but they've all got the answer you know how it is debating doctrine you know of course if you're in the debate you're the one that's the winner no matter if you're disproved or not you're the one winning right is that the idea well how can this one have the truth and that one have the truth have you ever seen fiddler on the roof and that guy says to him he's right and he's right they can't both be right [Laughter] but of course truth you understand comes from the bible not from men's political views not from their agendas or perspectives of world economics or world power or world whatever those things come from the bible let all mans be alive man's words be a lie and let mine be the truth so somehow another they're going to have to come together and the bible said in revelation he'll give power and everything under the image of the beast that's us if you all didn't know not canada not mexico not new zealand not africa not india the united states of america will become the image under the beast you'll speak with the same authority well if she's doing some talking you can't have a word without a thought and to have a thought you have to have a mind so where did her mind come come from you understand when not when when nazi germany when hitler decided that he was going to spread the third rock you understand what he did not only did he get into the media he controlled the media he controlled entertainment there wasn't a show that they put on that didn't have nazi germany agenda threaded all the way through the whole thing and some of us will sit down there with a remote control on our hand or we'll scan through to netflix or we'll turn on hbo max or one of these kind of deals like that amazon prime and we'll watch every old filthy ungodly thing and one all just entertain entertainment be careful somebody is projecting their mind to what you're watching i'm not telling you to be i'm not a legalist that you can't sit down and watch golf on tv god's sakes but we need to stop and consider what we're letting to the gates [Applause] because satan hasn't agenda everything he pokes at every time you pick up a paper whether it's electronic or on your ipad or wherever it might be there's an agenda attached to that have you all noticed how sweet the media has been since trump has been voted out since he has no more time if you notice how sweet they've got now every time you scroll through your through your through your phone now oh it's oh you know oh all the nations we're covering probably but we're standing together so you got somebody that wouldn't call you out no more one thing i loved about the guys he put them people in their place where they belonged a bunch of crooks and sidewinders and liars the day of judgment will declare everything they've ever done to push them fear tactics off on the people right if it suits them it'll suit them but there must come something eventually now listen to me these are little micro things little tiny stops and and divots and bumps in the road but there's got to come something big enough that will cause both democrat republican independent yellow green purple and all the rest of these parties to come together on a common basis now you think to yourself i know what you're getting ready to say but how could it be us they don't even pay attention to us and one little virus put the world in the condition it's in let me tell you something church when god gets ready to declare this bride and who she is it'll get the world's attention maybe not in the way we think it will it certainly won't be a worldwide revival come on but the power of god will not leave out of here without making a mark for it goes because there will be a showdown sure it won't come away we think it is just like the rapture resurrection won't be a bunch of angels out there with shovels and hoes and rakes in their hand digging bodies up and giving them change the graves are open but not the way you say open not the way i say open watch this again and the message called to see jesus do you realize in the last day when this duel of spirits come is i wasn't going to say this but the holy spirit is pressing on me now you realize the bible preaches in the last day that the two spirits has to come to a showdown that will not be some doctrine of churches or something i love this quote so in other words the final showdown will not be okay was my doctrine right or was your doctrine right did i have the right version or did you have the right version no no when the showdown comes listen brother bretton said the two spirits will be so close it could deceive the elected if it was possible surely you don't believe that exists outside the ranks of this message that's so close so close got to be close to be close friends you realize he said as janice and james withstood moses so these men reprobate concerning the faith they'll try to withstand the spirit of god in the last days listen to me don't you know that's what's taking place already go to some of our churches and just ask somebody what they think about the gift of the spirit it won't be long you'll find out number one many of them don't even know what you're talking about and number two a lot of them don't even want to talk gifts in a church of course they don't because gifts keep your church clean you can't go on with the lifestyles and where you live if you've got prophecy calling you out every time you pull it remember this demonic spirit that comes in it calls itself a bride but it's church formal and so its idea is we don't need worship even though they'll worship but they don't worship like worship like you got it they don't want spontaneous christian worship they want program manufactured clap on cue raise your hand on cue well i've seen you all quiet before but i've never seen you all die in a service like this [Laughter] huh say with me a little while don't you understand what's taking place that coldness that we feel amongst the ranks you can even feel it in your own church i'm sure i'm not i'm not speaking down about the believers here but i'm sure you get folks in here that possibly don't believe in worship and praise in the lord and things like that and then you try to cut loose you feel it it's coming from the back up the side where's it coming from it's coming i'll tell you something i appreciate about brother tom i believe he's a real man of god you know how i know that sister don and his wife's a real daughter of god i've watched that woman back here in that sound booth whenever it comes time the holy ghost goes to move and i've lost count i hope this is all right sis i don't mean to embarrass you but i've lost count of the times brother tom that i could feel the holy ghost getting ready to explode on the platform and watch her immediately respond before any of you all caught a word that lady back here is sensitive to the holy ghost i don't say that trying to suck up as they say that's not me just trying to kiss up to the boss but i'm saying this to be truthful you have to come to a place to where you realize that cold spirit that doesn't want you to move in the holy ghost that is a false bride anointing that would love nothing more than to shut down anything that looks like true pentecost that's why i spent a god have such a battle i i've just learned to come on whether you do or not i'm going to tell you to come on but i'm coming on whether you do or not it just makes it a whole lot nicer when you do come on you know i mean i've been in services where they've literally been swinging from the rafters almost and i'm going come on somebody cut on somebody i'm going to haul it like that no matter whether you're saying amen or not that's not really the point but the idea is there's a spirit amongst the people of this message that would love to just squash that supernatural part out we believe the prophet we believe the message but you know speaking in tongues prophecy what's the matter with you and yet do you realize the very s the very hope of the christian church is based upon the gift of prophecy that's called the coming of the lord how do you know about the coming of the lord because it was prophesied to you so that little insignificant gift of prophecy it is beneficial but this other group don't want that let me show you why brother man says here's a message called go tell he says come to a place the little church has believed the message amen and stood on both feet with her eyes centered on the cross he said the nations have got to recognize it it'll come to a showdown he said the council of churches and so forth is so honeycomb with communistic no wonder they can't believe in the supernatural no wonder they can't believe in divine healing they don't have any message in their heart he said that's why no matter how hard they're running now notice he says honeycomb with communism anybody know what the real meaning of communism is well i didn't so i looked it up communism means it is a system of social organization where all social and economic activity is controlled by a political party or by one person and brother brahm said the churches are honeycombed in communism oh so they're not out there running around with red flags and you know and goose stepping but this is the spirit that lay behind communism to control the churches by social influence because you know what they call these new up and coming social media types don't you they call them social media influencers and we have the same thing around the ranks so the message let me tell you something friends listen i didn't go to school to learn how to preach i i i'm gifted i believe by the hand of the lord but i've taken my cues from a hundred other preachers in this message i've learned how to preach by watching every preacher there is to learn how to preach to try to find a way to be have a good presentation and to help the people get somewhere but i'm going to say something i guarantee you in this day and age a man can't preach a sermon without being accused of sneaking around and reading or listening to somebody else's deal and it's always about five or ten or eight top men and if it didn't come from there then it didn't come from anywhere well i figured y'all get quiet but i'm coming on anyhow don't you realize what that is now i'm not saying that these particular brothers have a communistic spirit on them but what the people have done with them i mean i'll just point you to a place down in the east down by the ohio river that for some people's attitude is that if it doesn't come from that headquarters down there it didn't come from anywhere communism and on the other side of that i don't care what the preacher's name is if he controls his church or he controls his people based on social politics and who they like and who they don't like i've told you a million times people say who do you preach for what in the world has that got to do don't you know what that is that's a communistic devil because then see if i preach for this one this one this one and this one that i must be okay how do you do that praise the lord it's a social communistic spirit controlling the thing through social agendas some people some preachers i'm telling you friends and some people can do more damage sitting in a parking lounge or with a cell phone attached to their ear than they could if they ever got on youtube and broadcast it or whatever they did because all they got to do is call up their 15 buddies and tell them we don't like that guy and he's done i've seen many evangelists squashed like bugs on the field because of social pressures from the outside from men that didn't like the way they presented themselves i remember many years ago when i was a boy preacher before i was a preacher before i was even saved now i think about it i had a dream for whatever reason i was standing at the apostolic arc that but at the church it had a big overhang like this and there was always full of preachers and i never will forget in the stream i was sitting up there and i had a pair of overhauls on no shirt and the branches were short ragged tagged hanging down below my knee of course and all that and i got up i didn't have no shoes on didn't my hair wasn't comb sticking every direction i was muddy all over and they called me to preach and i got up to preach and all them preachers go you're not a part of our club you're not a part of our group you don't do it the way we do it i said it on then god was calling me for that kind of lifestyle because don't you realize even in a church if a family does a certain thing in a certain way that will be perceived as being the holy ghost that's right and if you're not careful that spirit spirit of communism will fall on you and you'll dress like them walk like them talk like them act like them well brother tom it's been fun majority years together sir huh it's a communistic spirit and this false thing weaves itself and threads itself through the church and of course he who has the most money wins because in some circles if they pay enough tithe or whatever all that influences the preacher right sure it does that's one reason why preachers should not get themself entangled with tithing accounts and all this other kind of stuff they should know and have opportunity to do with it what the they want ties belong to this man right here in this church you don't have a say to it it ain't none of your business what he does with it god if he wants to take it and buy him a brand new red something something truck it's his business god will answer make him answer on the day of judgment of course for high handling but how do you know he didn't need that red drug i need a red truck then go to work that's what he's doing okay couple of them if you need it listen i somebody said to me one time i can't get my young people to stop getting on this and doing what's the problem i said you let him lay at the house all day long with nothing but video games a cell phone and access to the internet if you want to solve their problems get them off the altar and get them in jobs i want a boy to get off the altar it's where they belong i said it ain't doing them no good to go to the altar because when they get done at the altar they're still getting involved in nonsense idle hands are the devil's playground somebody preached to me communism what y'all are in church this morning communism thank you jesus now notice again questions and answers brother i'm speaking on the mark of the beast don't you believe that'll be a tattoo or a number in your head or number on your hand i was absolutely amazed i'm a social media guy okay i like facebook and i've got facebook and and and if it's used right i think it's okay you know listen people years ago misused a telephone when it was connected to the wall and it was the little rotary jobby same anointing was on them people back then same ones on the facebook today it ain't the facebook it's in rotten people that are on it [Music] hallelujah social distance and i'm sorry [Laughter] but i was amazed during quarantine how many people i just went right down through the line about this rfid chip and cashless society oh this is it this is what we were warned of these are message people and i wanted to write in their soul haven't y'all ever listened to a tape any y'all and y'all ever read a book you who claim this man was a prophet of god never taught you that an rfid chip was the mark of the beast and he never taught you that cashless societies was the mark of the beast the mark of the beast listen is the rejecting of the baptism of the holy ghost not a tattoo i read one guy said he's supposed to be a message guy we're gonna get a number of those that won't take the vaccine that's oh god it hurts it hurts where do people get the ideas that they get they've been programmed do you understand when people are talking that doomsday stuff they've never really given themselves to the message of the hour because when all of this takes place jesus said didn't don't look the cnn don't look the fox don't look to none of the rest of them look up because your redemption draws nigh get your eyes off all of that mess out there just to pinch further let's quit handwriting on the wall he said i want you to notice he said the beginning of the gentiles when god dealt with them they were haughty in their heart and forced every man to worship a holy man the image of a holy man the gentile age comes in with that the gentile age will go out with that they said it will be issued the same way a boycott of the mark of the beast that will force people to worship images and do things that's been taught contrary to the word of god very next statement he said it will be a boycott against the bride you can feel that very spirit in the midst of our churches right now let a true servant of god preach truth to the people he will be marked as a troublemaker not so shall be acceptable and you'll hear people voice their unneeded unnecessary opinions i just don't like him since when did that become an uh the the the measuring stick for whether you hear what i gotta preach or not i got news you could not like anything about me you could think i'm the most repulsive human being you've ever met but if i preach the word to you you better get your mouth open say amen because when it comes to the word it ain't got nothing to do with my personality this is about god and what he said right here he said paul was hard to take peterson you know why paul was very plain spoken there's a pharisee he was conditioned to be that way well you know how the pharisees was with jesus rough rude straight in your face paul didn't lose too much of that when he was preaching because when he come to them galatians he said you want to give me your eyes until i told you the truth oh foolish galatians who hath bewitched you you know what he's saying somebody's cast a spell on you and you're like a heathen that's some hard preaching [Laughter] but it didn't have nothing to do with paul's personality it was about what paul had to say now listen close the other side of that is with this false group it has everything to do with personality because you see they don't have an agenda unless they have a personality to lead that agenda well since their foundation of this false bride has nothing to do with the word of god then it has to be controlled or inspired by something so a lot of times the inspiration behind them things is charisma well speaking listen i've been through enough college stuff in my life to hear a guy use the wrong language you know what i mean i had a lady tell me once i think i've told you this before she said you are smart as a whip i said thank you she said but the way you talk oh she was an english english gal she said you don't say nothing right i said what do you mean she said your wasn't should be words your words should be was i said yeah she said and you don't seen it you saw it her exact words for god's sakes you saw it i said yes ma'am that's true i said but listen to me the people i preached to they wouldn't understand the way you talk either because you use words that they'd haven't they need a dictionary people look at mine i said so i choose not to incorporate any of that into my language now i've been on a plane and i've sat next to doctors and different people and they're scholar learned people and you know i try to fall in the rhythm of being just me not change but i try to fall on the rhythm if they use certain words you know i i try to you know yeah i understand where you're coming from i refuse to become a personality a celebrity that's what they call them nowadays you know in the message we have celebrities now god help us friends it's a false bride creating a false agenda through social influence and social control i appreciate the internet i appreciate what god's been able to do for it i'm sure some of you listening this message right now at home streaming i'm sure you appreciate being able to hear the message this way but social media and social influences have been just as destructive as they've been beneficial because the second somebody becomes even a little bit visible all of a sudden they become an authority that's what we got to remember the only authority we come back to this right there oh and don't forget say only what was said on those tapes so the world is going to go out worshiping images now do you honestly think that if the pope walked in here in all of his reality and his popenos see what i mean about cause that poor professor to pass out you think he walked in here there be you message people will be gone oh you're holiness you think we'll be falling down and going home let me kiss your ring but what if a man stood up here and said brother adam said brother of adam said brother adam said oh y'all wasn't so quick to answer then but we've got the same anointing on us if we raise brother branham to a level that god never put him and we raised him to a level of almost worship to where everything the man did was god everything the man said was god william branham was not god william branham was a son of god he was god's messenger of the ladies and church age he was the voice god used to lead us back to the scripture and to reveal those seven seals i'm talking about the mysteries now to show the bride who she was where she come from where she's going it was a vessel god used but never ever ever did god ever intend for us to worship that man and to let his name fall off our tongue more than we ever said the name jesus christ false bride did that because you see if they can't create their personalities in the in their own little ministerial groups if they believe in ministers well then it's easy they'll use the messenger they'll just grab his words and they'll hold him up as being the authority of it all and it's the same gentile spirit that worshiped images as those folks that you see when they come down there and they kneel to the toe of the pope i just hope the man washes his feet i'm not trying to be disrespectful or funny it's pitiful and we look at that and we think him poor blinded people and yet we do the same thing when we come into these churches and sit down here and name the name of this message and we hide how's in our heart incontinent fears despisers of those that are good when we project an image on the outside and it's not really on the inside we're doing no different than a bunch of people that scrape their knees on the concrete trying to find penance before god come on somebody preach to me same spirit same anointing same revelation two minutes we're going home can you handle two minutes all right two minutes true sign and soda look there'll be a national showdown you know my mom told me this morning don't preach long you preach so long i'll try i'll try mama i'll try there'll be a power like they've never seen before trouble of it is this time it's going to be too late the doors will be closed remember we're at the end time he said the latter rain will come forth the mount carmel showdown as john the baptist fulfilled malachi 3 the messenger before his face planted the former reign was rejected by the churches the denominations and the pharisees and the sadducees in his day jesus had to come to mount transfiguration showdown and the forerunner the last days will sow the former rain and jesus jesus will be the showdown between denominations and creeds not doctrine not books not tapes not message jesus so if jesus is not on the inside then the real showdown comes between you and jesus god help me say this right but some of you folks have been sitting in here for 30 years maybe you started with brother tom if you are still not sure whether you're born again or not don't you reckon it's about time to get down to business we are not only at the end of it we're at the end of the end of the end too many things are happening around us for not to be close then again we could go 40 years we don't know i don't see how we could but we could brad mean you get old one day if that happens i feel like i'm kind of almost there how about you but eventually down the line somewhere we're going to have to admit to ourself the real showdown between the true bride and the false bride isn't okay what do they believe listen to me listen i feel i feel pressure i know you want me to quit i'm almost there just bear with me another moment set this one bride here that's a false one okay set the true one right there let's question and answer them right what do you believe on the godhead both of them are going to tell you i believe in one god his name is jesus christ how are you supposed to be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the mission of your sins water baptism how are you going to heaven believe the message get the token we're going to give you all those same standard answers moses snaring through down there rods magicians threw down their runs how are you gonna know who the real ones are because this group don't have jesus on the inside this group has jesus on the inside that's the real showdown brother the real showdown ain't got nothing to do oh brother time i finally figured it out i understand what tim plagues was in the fifth seal now praise god brother you're on your way and it got nothing to do with it i know god will reveal things to us out of his word i certainly don't discount the need for revelation but when it comes down to evening light tabernacle and whether or not we going out of here you better have more than just a form of godliness [Music] you want to know how you test it i'm done let's go to the four let's go to the first scripture you wanna know how to test it look inside your heart and just pick it up at verse 2. if it says men you put woman there okay men shall be lovers of their own selves you want to test yourself look at your life and say am i a lover of my own self because y'all better said eternal life is living for somebody else and not just for the people that are good to you but eternal life is living for those that would kill you praise the lord covetous i mean we can go on the rest of the morning you get that right all you got to do is test that heart out is this in me is this in me is this in me do i do these things because i'm just falling prey to influences and i bow to pressure and i i get under the wrong influences i do these things when i do them i feel convicted i repent that's a good sign right there too it's not that the elect won't ever do things like this some elect may be have uh parts of their nature for example let me give you an example some people that uh an example would be that some people love pleasure sports fanatics i'm not i'm not here kicking at your football or not i'm just saying you may have loved it all your life you may really really love it and there's nothing wrong with enjoying a football game but when you love that thing more than you love god you need to get down to business and say lord take that out of my heart [Music] friends i know people in this message that go to football games on sunday nascar on sunday they'll go to baseball games wednesday night instead of going to the house of god because they're just going to hear the same thing they have always heard and they're bored and uninterested and that helps them more than being in the house of god you know what brother graham said he said it is a joy to go to church under any circumstance whether it's cold or indifferent whether the people are fussing or fighting whether they're up down whether it's this way or that he said it is a joy come on somebody it is a try to go to the house of god we get bored oh come on don't look at me like that i know i can't admit that in church what would he think of me i think you're an honest human being instead of being that cardboard cutout you've been for the last 10 years [Laughter] we get bored sometimes i get that we have to entertain ourself i get that brother branham's entertainment was to grab a gun to grab a bag and go out to the woods and lay in the coal with icicles on his beard with squirrel blood all over him no thank you i'll pass i don't like the cold i don't like the heat i don't like nature i don't like i like guns i like shooting i'm a good shot i don't like all that that's not me so it'd be easy for me to have certain type of pleasure and maybe fall into that thing well you know it's wednesday night oh you know but you check yourself is that in my heart more than loving god if you can look inside yourself and see these things are the dominant influence in your life listen my words carefully if you can look and see these are the dominant influences of your life you better get down to business because only a christian i'm not saying you won't do this i'm not saying you won't be a traitor sometimes any men in here ever had to repent to their wife she thinks you're a traitor right now you know you know certain little things you know i'm talking about you do little errors or little things like that you know that little feminine type nature i mean you betrayed them you you broke you shattered everything that's one reason they run in the room shut the door i can't believe you after all of these years you're a traitor oh some of you men are scared to death a holler a man sure so you look at that you say well you know this is brother carol talk baby doll he'd say i'm sorry i did that i'm sorry i said that i'm sorry i acted that way well see that's what christians do when they recognize these kind of things raising up in their heart they say god forgive me but false pride brother tom they make excuses for it oh it's always somebody else's fault there's always response somebody else did it was let me tell you something one of the worst things you can do trying to repent is not to repent you know what i mean by that right when you start saying well i i'm sorry but you got messed up right there there is no i'm sorry but if you're sorry you'll just be sorry i repent i make it right i'm sorry i did that but if you had that oh you're not repenting you're starting to fight hush be quiet repent don't start that old nonsense like that [Music] but i'm gonna give her a piece of my mind and she's gonna know it be careful how many pieces of your mind you give away you may be regretting [Music] but you say brother ben i do see these things in my life what do i do repent don't go to god don't do that don't do that don't come to him and say lord i'm sorry but you know my daddy lord i take responsibility for what's inside of me and i'm sorry it's there and i want you to fix me if you ever get there you'll be in a whole lot better position than all that other nonsense don't make excuses one last statement we're going to quit done 20 after 12. i'm a liar you know that i'm going to preach quick to you uh-huh sure nobody believes that in this church let me tell you that right now truth the matter is i only preached about an hour or so with all that singing it seemed long but when you're talking about the false group just just look in revelation one time when god says i give her a space to repent but but what does she do just like balaam just like saul remember when saul got caught first thing saul started doing was blaming the people well samuel you know what's the bleeding of this oxen i hear well you know the people uh-huh and who's king over those people who was their boss who's the one that could have told ten men to go take care of it but you didn't right look at the difference in david and saul when nathanael come up and said let me tell you a story and such and such and so-and-so happened and on and on and whatever whatever whatever and david was standing there david didn't say but you know you don't remember what i went through with saul do you nathanael said thou art the man listen david had such a right attitude that god asked him how he wanted to be whipped do you want famine do you want pestilence what do you want i'm going to tell you something if a man without the holy ghost can live that close to the lord i want to have such a repentant attitude before god that when i mess up the lord gives me a choice of how i can take my weapon god just didn't pour it out on him he had a relationship with david and david didn't make excuses either he just come clean i'm sorry that's one reason dave if it was a man how to repent this other group will boycott you because they think that your tender attitude is a weakness they think that repented attitude is a weakness i've heard preachers say it i've never seen the gifts benefit a church i heard a man say that one time packing a bible in his arm calling brother man's name every few seconds what a shame of course what gifts they refer to as tongue interpretation and prophecy but when they get sick they sure want the gift of healing when they got devils come up in their home they sure want discernment to show up but this false group don't want nothing to do with anything supernatural they perceive that surrender to god as a complete weakness oh and have i got a message for you in closing that's what god wants out of us complete and total weakness because brother john when i get so weak that i can't fight anymore that's when jesus can take over and do things that my mind can't even comprehend it is a bride war how do you know what side you're on i know what side i'm on because i can be corrected by the word that's how i know who i am it doesn't mean i won't make mistakes i don't want me to mess up a thousand times it don't mean that i won't dave ramsey do stupid with zeros on the ends of it but it means when i do i'm willing to revent i thought you hasn't been just a moment all right here comes the showdown for you while you're sitting there this morning why don't you just just shut out everybody around you don't think about the time don't think about church after before next week don't think about nothing just steal your mind and then your thoughts just ask yourself this question lord is there any of these things that i've read in the bible today are they in my heart because if they are lord if they're in my heart i need a real move from you in the way of salvation and being born again by the holy ghost if you be willing to say that you'd be willing to be honest before the lord would you do me the favor and the honor i promise i will not repeat what i see i won't tell my wife i won't tell nobody only god and i alone will know what hand goes up next but if you're willing to be honest before the lord and say god i've got these things in my heart and i need to be born again would you slip your hand up to the lord so i can pray for you god bless those with your hands up i'm not even going to identify how many are sides of the building or where it might be at i'm just going to give you privacy because i don't want you to feel pressured by a preacher but if you know these things are in your heart you know you need to get right with god i need the baptism of the holy ghost i've got to get this stuff out of me because it dominates my life bad attitude bad spirit bad thoughts bad this bad that i can't seem to get victory to save my life you need the holy ghost friend now if you're willing to say that i believe god's willing not to meet you just halfway i believe he's willing to meet you all the way i wonder if you'd stand with me as a body this morning let's pray for each other can we let's ask the lord to help us each now i saw your hands i know who you are but i promise i'm not going to repeat nothing to nobody i wouldn't want to embarrass you like that i wouldn't want nobody to think less of you but i want you to have an opportunity to be honest before the lord and when you're standing there i want you to listen to me in just a moment once you hear my words what i'm going to say put it in your mind put it in your spirit you do not need me to lay my hands on you to be right you do not need brother tom or any other preacher in this building to lay their hands on you to get you right you do not need a great loud with our sister on the piano and our brother on the base of a bunch of music and things to make that kind of decision all you need is to just decide in your heart right now god from here on out i'm asking you to take a hold of the reigns take over and move forward from here on out you the boss because if you ever get desperate enough in your heart my precious friend that raised your hands if you ever get desperate enough that you realize you've come to a spot you realize you can't do it that's when a holy ghost can step in and do things you never even dreamed of but you be serious with god and watch and see if the lord ain't serious with you now in a moment when we start praying if you start feeling happy and the lord moves on you and you want to cut up well then i guess the cat's out of the bag of who you are then but that's up to you i'll keep your privacy i promise i won't reveal it to nobody not my wife not nobody only god alone in prayer will know those that i'm praying for perhaps brother tom was able to look as well i'm sure his heart's right there with me in the same way i'm sure as a pastor he wants to see his sheep come closer to god a man don't labor like he has all these years and my 30 years i've given to him since a boy you don't do them things because you just want to stand up here and be recognized as a preacher you're trying to help folks i want to see you get somewhere with the lord this morning so me and business i know this may seem a little baptist well just raise my hand and pray but you know really sometimes that's called for because when the lord moves on you this morning and i'm telling you he's going to move on some of you i already feel that in the anointing coming i'm just lingering just a moment because i'm waiting for faith to build to a spot i feel something moving but i'm just holding steady just a moment but when he does move on you heart no man deserves the credit and no man deserves the praise for what god does for you today if you've got real faith and you believe it watch and see if something don't change today if you believe what i've said is the truth pray with me with all your heart now you believers those that didn't raise your hand you with the holy ghost there were several one up i want you to help me pray all right ask the lord to be mindful let's join our hearts together now lord jesus so we stand here lord jesus in this cold december morning lord god coming to the close of such a tumultuous year and so many things have transpired and lord god no doubt fear and other things have crept into the hearts of people and lord no doubt their minds are muddled up with all kinds of confusions and lord influences from everything from social media to the news to lord everything around us from even press reports from the white house lord and just somehow our minds are shook our hearts are shook our lives are shook apart with what this world is calling a new normal lord jesus with all we see going on around us i can only believe that lord when you begin pulling out the feathers from underneath the nest that lord it means it's time for the eagles to learn how to fly on their own so lord jesus we want to come to you great mother eagle lord as you let us spin and topsy turvy down through this lord this course this walk of life father we know that we may fall we may make mistakes we may falter but lord jesus that thy watchful eyes upon a rock lord if we got too far down you can fly faster than we can fall for thy watchful eyes over us every moment every hour lord jesus thou art mindful of every heart lord of every soul of every thought of every intention lord from those and the youngest lord plum to the oldest representative in this group maybe across the internet this morning lord there'll be a little population that'll have their hand raised lord in their living room or where they might be sitting oh god thou who sees the end from the beginning i pray that you will move into this little congregation right now and lord that you will fall upon every uplifted hand lord you see the heart you see the difficulty you see the struggle you see where they've come from lord you see how many times they might have thrown in the towel how many times they've given up even in their own mind they might be thanking lord oh i've tried this before and i failed but lord god thou art the same yesterday today and forever and you can move on the seam and do a new normal in their life lord you can make a change o god that will drive out all of these things lord that have been identified by scripture lord jesus you can take their hearts and mold them and shape them and clear oh god that they can be in the image of jesus christ father i pray for everyone that had their hand raised in this building lord that you would take the holy ghost and fire and that you would burn out every sin every speck of unbelief lord god made you do something so wonderful so powerful so so beautiful lord that god will even mesmerize their own personal faith that lord that sitting shocking all at the power and the moving of the holy spirit may the holy ghost i pray foul in this place this morning lord and baptize everyone in the name of the lord jesus may you grant it for every sinner granted for every saint granted for every backslider in the name of jesus do a great work lord in every heart every life every hand that was raised lord they to fight gravity to raise up that hand lord maybe they're not desperate yet but jesus may from this moment on may that hour come to where they will not be still until they get themselves right with you granted lord jesus as we commit the prayers of the saints and we commit the needs of the people those that raise their hand outstretched to you god now may be like with simon peter may you reach back and pull them out of their own circumstances granted lord in jesus christ's name we pray grant it lord we pray in jesus name i love him love him because he first loved me and purchased my [Laughter] [Music] salvation [Music] let's sing that once again now i love him
