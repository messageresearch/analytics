[15:17] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[15:19] praise tonight. Amen. He's awesome,

[15:26] your heart tonight. It's good to be in
[15:28] the house of the Lord tonight. And Amen.
[15:30] You may be seated. God bless you. Uh, I
[15:34] always say that unlike brother Brian, I
[15:36] don't mean to keep you standing and but
[15:38] sometimes we just do. But it's just good
[15:40] to be in the house of the Lord and all
[15:42] of our visitors and Amen. You know, and
[15:45] I I've got a brother Glenn had asked me
[15:48] the other day about turning a prayer
[15:51] request in for a lady. She's works at a
[15:54] restaurant they eat at and her fiance
[15:57] has cancer and his name is Tony.
[16:01] Well, it's one of those times that I
[16:03] forgot, but the Lord doesn't forget.
[16:06] And so, they went in there and ate the
[16:08] other day and they asked how Tony was
[16:11] doing cuz they had been praying for him
[16:13] and different ones had been. I'm sure
[16:15] brother Shauna and them had. And uh she
[16:17] said, she said, "We're just praising the
[16:20] Lord." Said, "His tumor just keeps
[16:21] getting smaller, smaller, and smaller."
[16:25] Amen. That's how great our God is. Let's
[16:28] give the Lord a hand of praise tonight.
[16:29] He's an awesome God. And Amen. And you
[16:32] know, he he paid a debt for us tonight,
[16:35] you know, and I'm glad he paid my debt.
[16:37] And Amen. Let's sing that that song
[16:40] tonight. It come on my heart. And I was
[16:42] praying today and I got to find my song
[16:45] book. You know how I am. Amen. The
[16:47] reason all this is is because at the

[16:52] first saw the light. And that's where
[16:54] everything was paid for for me. Wasn't
[16:57] it you? Aren't you glad for that
[16:59] tonight? Amen.
[17:02] Alas,
[17:04] did [music]
[17:05] my savior bleed and did my sovereign
[17:12] die?
[17:15] Or would he [singing]
[17:17] devote that sacred
[17:21] head for such a worm as I.
[17:28] Oh, at the [singing] cross. At the cross
[17:32] where I first saw the light and the
[17:36] burdens [singing] of my heart were

[19:07] died for man, the creature
[19:11] [music and singing]
[19:12] sin.

[21:28] remember her in prayer. And also, it
[21:29] says, "Please pray for Mansky. She has
[21:32] been in a lot of pain." And also our

[21:38] that's cancer. Is that correct?
[21:45] Okay.

[21:53] tonight?
[21:55] We just bow our heads.
[21:58] Dear Lord, we come before you tonight,
[22:00] dear Lord, knowing, dear Lord, that
[22:02] you're still the same yesterday, today,
[22:04] and forever. Dear Lord, we sure are
[22:07] glad, dear Lord, that it's written in in
[22:09] your word, dear Lord, that it's not
[22:12] possible if we feel it, but it's

[22:16] just putting our little licks of faith
[22:18] together tonight, dear Lord, believing,

[22:21] [music] dear Lord. You heard every one
[22:22] of them. You know every one of them,

[22:29] the names that [music] were read, dear
[22:31] Lord, you know all about them. your
[22:34] arm's not short, dear Lord. You're more

[22:43] with these needs, dear Lord. We ask that
[22:45] you just touch the lives of these
[22:46] people, dear Lord. Ask that you work,
[22:49] dear Lord, your work in them, dear Lord.
[22:51] And we know, dear Lord, your scripture,
[22:53] scripture says, dear Lord, that you work
[22:55] everything for the good that them that
[22:56] love the Lord, dear Lord. And we pray,
[22:58] dear Lord, that you be with these needs,
[22:59] dear Lord. We pray that you move on the
[23:01] scene, [music] dear Lord. For the ones
[23:02] that are sick, dear Lord, are
[23:03] recovering, dear Lord. We ask that you
[23:05] just move even tonight, dear Lord, that
[23:08] they can see the situation getting
[23:10] better and better, dear Lord. The ones
[23:12] that need you, dear Lord, in their life,
[23:13] dear Lord. We ask that you just come in
[23:16] a mighty way, dear Lord, and show
[23:18] yourself to them, dear Lord, that they'd
[23:19] have an experience, dear Lord, that
[23:21] they'd never be able to walk away from,
[23:22] dear Lord, but you'd change your life
[23:24] forever, [music] dear Lord. We love you.
[23:26] We ask that you be with the remaining of
[23:27] the service now. be with with brother
[23:29] Tom, dear Lord, as he comes, dear Lord.
[23:31] Anoint the speaker, dear Lord, to speak
[23:33] and dear Lord, anoint our ears to be
[23:34] able to hear what you'd have to say to
[23:36] us. We ask these things in your precious
[23:38] name, Jesus name. Amen.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, he paid a debt. He did not. Oh, I
[23:55] owed a debt. I couldn't [music] pay. I
[24:00] needed someone
[24:03] to [music] wash my sins away.

[31:25] I believe.
[31:27] You are [singing] who you say you are.
[31:32] You'll do what you say you'll do.
[31:37] You'll come through. [singing]
[31:39] You are always
[31:42] able.
[31:44] I [singing] believe
[31:47] you've already made a way.
[31:51] So I'm running through parted ways
[31:56] straight to [singing] you.
[31:59] You are always
[32:02] faithful. [singing] I believe.
[32:06] [music]
[32:07] Oh, [singing]
[32:13] tonight on that day I'll run my
[32:17] [singing] race. I'll finally see you
[32:21] face to face. And nothing [singing]
[32:24] then will separate.
[32:27] I believe.
[32:30] I believe
[32:32] I'll join with every [singing]
[32:35] tribe and tongue [music]
[32:37] and bow before the [singing] lamb of God
[32:42] singing holy, holy, holy [singing] one.
[32:47] I believe.
[32:50] I believe.
[32:56] Amen.
[32:59] [applause]
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:03] And you believe tonight.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give him another hand. That
[33:07] was awesome, wasn't it? Amen.
[33:10] [applause]
[33:11] Amen.
[33:13] Amen. God bless you tonight. Let's stand
[33:14] and we ask brother Thomas to come and
[33:17] and uh pray the song service been a
[33:19] blessing to you and sure enjoy that
[33:21] special. Amen. Let's just sing that
[33:24] little chorus as Brother Thomas comes.
[33:27] Fill my cup, Lord. Is that your desire
[33:30] tonight that he'd just fill your cup?
[33:32] Amen. Oh, fill my cup,
[33:38] Lord.
[33:41] I lift [singing]
[33:42] it up,
[33:45] Lord.
[33:48] Come and quit.
[33:52] for this thirsting
[33:54] of my soul.
[34:00] Bread of [singing]
[34:02] heaven.
[34:04] Oh, feed [music] me till I want
[34:10] no more.
[34:13] Here's my cup.
[34:16] Fill it up and make [singing]
[34:19] me
[34:21] once again as brother Tom comes tonight.
[34:24] Oh, fill my cup
[34:28] Lord.
[34:30] I lift it up
[34:34] Lord. [singing]
[34:37] Oh come and quench.
[34:41] Oh, this [singing] thirsting
[34:43] of [music]
[34:44] my soul.
[34:49] Oh, bread of heaven,
[34:53] feed me.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Amen. [music]
[34:57] &gt;&gt; You too.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Here's my cup. [music] Fill [singing] it
[35:06] up and make me whole.
[35:12] One more time. Oh, here's my cup,
[35:17] Lord.
[35:19] I lift it up,
[35:23] Lord.
[35:24] [music]
[35:26] Come and quench
[35:30] it thirsting
[35:32] of my [singing] soul.
[35:38] Bread [singing] of heaven,
[35:42] feed [music] me till I want no more.
[35:50] Here's my cup.
[35:53] Fill it up and [singing] make me whole.
[35:59] [music]
[36:04] Amen. And I could just bask in that
[36:06] moment right there for 10,000 years.
[36:09] Amen. Don't you just love to worship
[36:11] him? Isn't it just nice just to bask in
[36:15] his presence? Amen. God bless you. Good
[36:18] evening, everyone.
[36:20] Amen. Praise the Lord. Good to see you,
[36:22] sister. God bless you. Amen. And you be
[36:24] kind Joyce there. Lord bless you. Amen.
[36:26] I had to open the door so he was
[36:28] singing. Amen. So, praise the Lord. God
[36:30] bless each and every one of you. Amen.
[36:32] And I think that'll be all for the music
[36:34] tonight. Amen. Last service of the year.
[36:39] Amen.
[36:41] Last service of 2025. I was thinking,
[36:44] you know, one of these days it'll be the
[36:47] last service.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The last special will be sung.
[36:54] Amen. The last sermon will be preached.
[36:59] Last prayer will be prayed.
[37:02] Amen.
[37:03] All the struggling,
[37:07] all the pain,
[37:10] all the sorrow,
[37:12] all the crying
[37:14] will be wiped away.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; All death will be wiped away. Aren't you
[37:20] looking for that day?
[37:23] &gt;&gt; I love that. Amen. I mean, that's God's
[37:26] promise.
[37:28] That's right.
[37:30] John
[37:32] saw that holy city, the new Jerusalem,
[37:34] coming down from God out of heaven,
[37:36] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[37:38] husband. And he heard a great voice out
[37:41] of heaven, saying, "Behold, the
[37:42] tabernacle of God is with men, and he
[37:45] will dwell with them, and shall be, and
[37:48] they shall be his people, and God
[37:51] himself shall be with them, and be their
[37:55] God."
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Don't expect him to be your God there.
[38:00] and not him be your god here.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God shall wipe away all tears from
[38:08] their eyes. There shall be no more
[38:10] death, nor sorrow, nor crying,
[38:15] neither shall there be any more pain.
[38:17] For for the former things are passed
[38:20] away. Amen.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; And he that sat upon the throne said,
[38:25] "Behold, I make all things new." And he
[38:28] said unto me, "Write, for these words
[38:32] are true
[38:34] and faithful."
[38:36] He said unto me, "It is done.
[38:39] I am the alpha, the amigga, the
[38:42] beginning, and the end. And I will give
[38:46] unto him that is a thirst of the
[38:48] fountain of water of life freely.
[38:53] Blessed are they which hunger and thirst
[38:55] after righteousness, for they shall be
[38:58] filled. How many believes that you have
[39:00] to be a little hungry and a little
[39:02] thirsty on this side if you're going to
[39:04] drink from that fountain.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you're not thirsty
[39:08] here, you probably wouldn't be thirsty
[39:10] for that one.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; But if you thirst, God will quench your
[39:15] thirst. God bless you. Let's bow our
[39:17] heads. Lord Jesus, as we come before
[39:19] your throne of grace tonight, once
[39:21] again, this side of eternity,
[39:24] in all of struggling humanity,
[39:27] in the peak of evil,
[39:30] and uh Eden of Satan,
[39:33] in the climax of all evil
[39:37] that we are in the midst of,
[39:39] we pray tonight, Lord, that you would
[39:41] just as we have gathered together this
[39:43] one more time in this one year of 2025,
[39:48] And we certainly stand here questioning
[39:51] and wondering if 26 will bring you back,
[39:55] Lord. And we're believing that it will.
[39:57] We're expecting for you to come. Amen.
[40:01] Perhaps even yet before the first, but
[40:05] Lord, if not, we'll be expecting you in
[40:07] 2026.
[40:09] And because of that, Lord, we come into
[40:11] your house. deem it a grand privilege
[40:14] and a great necessity
[40:17] and of a dire need, Father, to come
[40:20] together, Lord, to examine ourselves,
[40:23] Lord Jesus, to allow the Holy Spirit to
[40:27] speak to our hearts and to bring us
[40:28] closer to you, Lord. And if there's any
[40:31] evil way in us, that you would take it
[40:33] away, Lord, and that you could do your
[40:35] work that you have begun in our hearts.
[40:38] Father, we truly believe Lord Jesus that
[40:40] you're finishing the work. We ask God
[40:43] that you would just bless the meditation
[40:45] of my heart, my thoughts, and Lord, in
[40:48] the direction that I feel, Lord, you've
[40:49] led me to go. That you'll just bless my
[40:52] mouth, the words that come out of my
[40:54] mouth, my meditation of my mind. Lord,
[40:57] may it be used of you to give these
[40:59] people tonight what we have need of.
[41:01] those listening, bless them, Lord, as
[41:04] they listen, Father, Lord Jesus, out
[41:06] there. We ask, God, that you would bless
[41:09] them with your word and with your
[41:10] presence, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. We
[41:15] want to preach on part two of the
[41:18] father's business tonight. So, if you
[41:21] will turn to Matthew.
[41:24] Amen, Matthew. And um once again, thank
[41:28] you for your prayers. I feel like as I
[41:31] study, Amen.
[41:34] Um,
[41:36] Amen. I'm a little overwhelmed. Amen. I,
[41:38] you know, with what the Lord just kind
[41:41] of brings to me. And, and so I've got a
[41:44] lot wrote down. I've got a lot of
[41:47] scriptures.
[41:49] Amen. And I just ask you to pray for me
[41:53] that the Lord will direct me in the way
[41:54] that he wants me to go. Would that be
[41:56] okay? Amen.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Because we always want to be led by the
[42:00] spirit, not by our own head, by our own
[42:03] mind, or our own ability. Amen. Because
[42:07] it's him that doeth the works. Amen. So,
[42:11] in Matthew 2, I believe it is.
[42:17] No, I'm sorry. I apologize. It's not
[42:19] Matthew. It's Luke 2. Luke 2. And it's
[42:23] funny. I read that scripture in
[42:25] Revelations. I had no intent of reading
[42:27] that, but it'll certainly go along with
[42:29] what we want to minister on this
[42:32] evening.
[42:34] Amen. Luke 2.
[42:36] And it's the story
[42:39] of Joseph's parents going up every year
[42:42] to the feast of the Passover and so
[42:44] forth. And they had went there and then
[42:46] they went back a day's journey. And they
[42:49] thought that he was with them, but he
[42:52] wasn't. So they had to go back for a
[42:54] whole day to find him and they found
[42:56] him. Amen. We'll begin with verse uh 46
[43:01] of chapter 2 of Luke. And it came to
[43:05] pass that after three days they found
[43:06] him in the temple sitting in the midst
[43:08] of the doctors, both hearing them and
[43:12] asking them questions. And all that
[43:15] heard him were astonished at his
[43:17] understanding and answers.
[43:20] And when they saw him, they were amazed.
[43:22] And his mother said to him, "Son, why
[43:24] hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold,
[43:27] thy father, and I have sought thee
[43:28] sorrowing." And he said unto them, "How
[43:31] is it that ye sought me? Wish ye not
[43:34] that I must be about my father's
[43:36] business?" And they understood not the
[43:39] saying which he spake unto them. May God
[43:42] add his blessings to the reading of the
[43:43] word. You can be seated.
[43:56] Amen.
[43:58] We took a little thought Sunday on
[44:02] Amen. The father's business. And I want
[44:05] to and I kind of in my own way titled it
[44:08] God the businessman.
[44:11] God the businessman. In other words,
[44:14] Jesus said that his father had a
[44:17] business. Isn't that right? I must be
[44:20] about my father's business.
[44:23] Doing what his father did.
[44:26] And I think it's in Galatians 5. I'm
[44:29] going to go ahead just go there. Didn't
[44:31] intend to do it, but I think I can find
[44:34] it in a
[44:36] pretty quick way and maybe just read a
[44:38] little bit of it.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Galatians.
[44:55] All right. Must be Colossians.
[45:00] If it isn't Colossians, well,
[45:06] Huh?
[45:08] Well, well, well.
[45:11] It's where uh it talks about being
[45:14] brought up under tutors and governors
[45:17] and so forth. Amen. I thought for sure
[45:21] it was Galatians, but I guess not.
[45:25] Oh, there it is. Galatians 4. Now I say
[45:29] that the heir, as long as he is a child,
[45:31] differth nothing from a servant, though
[45:34] he be lord of all, but is under tutors
[45:37] and governors until the time appointed
[45:40] of the father. Even so we, when we were
[45:42] children, were under bondage under the
[45:44] elements of the world, when the fullness
[45:46] of time was come, God sent his son forth
[45:49] his son made of a womb, made under the
[45:51] law. Amen.
[45:54] Amen. Verse seven. Wherefore thou art no
[45:56] more a servant but a son and if his son
[45:58] than an heir of God. But now this point
[46:01] that I want to start out with is we as
[46:04] bornagain sons and daughters of God are
[46:07] under the tutorship of the Holy Spirit.
[46:10] How many believes that?
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:17] The tutorship of the Holy Spirit.
[46:21] Because
[46:22] as we know most of the times a child
[46:25] will take on his father's business, take
[46:28] over his father's business. Brother
[46:30] Banham of course preached on that and
[46:32] talking about how that you know how that
[46:34] that tutor how that he it's actually a
[46:37] teacher that brings reports back to the
[46:39] father and how that he says how he gives
[46:42] a report of how his child's doing.
[46:46] Ain't that right? Of how he's doing, how
[46:48] he's progressing.
[46:50] Amen. And you know that's what God is
[46:54] working on us with to see how we're
[46:57] acting. See what our actions are.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know that
[47:06] if we had the spirit of Dillinger or
[47:08] something that we probably carry guns
[47:10] and so forth. And I thought about how if
[47:13] we had the Holy Spirit or if we had the
[47:15] spirit of let's say Elvis Presley or one
[47:18] of those, you know, we might be singing
[47:20] about I don't know what what I don't
[47:23] know what some of call on songs about
[47:25] hound dogs and everything else,
[47:30] you know, go out there and we'd act like
[47:33] that. If we had a spirit of Michael
[47:35] Jackson, we'd sing like a girl.
[47:39] And I don't know about you, but I I've
[47:41] got a problem when a I can't when a guy
[47:43] singing it sounds like a girl, you know.
[47:47] I just don't know about all that.
[47:50] But anyway, but if we have the spirit of
[47:53] Christ,
[47:56] Amen. guess what? We're going to act
[48:00] like the spirit of Christ.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "The works that I do
[48:06] will you do also."
[48:08] SO, HOWEVER THE FATHER does is how we
[48:11] are to do
[48:14] &gt;&gt; recapping a little bit. We brought it up
[48:16] and all that Jesus did while he was in
[48:17] his ear earthly ministry and and uh I
[48:21] think it was Luke the third chapter or
[48:23] fourth chapter somewhere in there where
[48:24] he's pick up the Bible or the scriptures
[48:26] and he talk and it said that you know
[48:28] that that he was sent to preach uh to
[48:31] the brokenhearted and and so forth.
[48:34] Isn't that right? to bring bring uh
[48:36] freedom to captives and all that he was
[48:38] to do. And that was what I believe truly
[48:42] was his business
[48:44] in setting the captives free, healing
[48:46] the sick, OPENING THE EYES OF THE BLIND.
[48:50] HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S NOW BEEN GIVEN
[48:52] OVER? BECAUSE JESUS COULD JUST DO THAT.
[48:55] He could only do that in a limited
[48:59] sense. He had maybe 12 disciples that
[49:01] would go out and they would heal the
[49:03] sick. They would do this and that and
[49:04] the other, but you know, THEY COULD HAVE
[49:06] PREACHED THE GOSPEL ALL THEY WANTED TO,
[49:08] BUT the baptism of the Holy Ghost was
[49:10] not available. A nature change was not
[49:13] available yet. IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER
[49:16] CALVARY, NOT UNTIL ACTS 2:38 when the
[49:19] fire of God came back that they could GO
[49:22] OUT AND PREACH AND THE HOLY GHOST WOULD
[49:23] COME down and he would sanctify the
[49:26] people and IT WOULD FILL THE PEOPLE.
[49:28] AMEN. And then HE WOULD BE A a a a
[49:32] Jesus. so to speak because he separated
[49:36] himself. Amen. In the FORM OF THE HOLY
[49:38] GHOST. AMEN. AND I will be with you even
[49:41] in you to the end OF THE WORLD. AND
[49:43] TRULY WHAT GOD WAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE, he
[49:47] is achieving through his people or his
[49:49] bride or his church now.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:56] Amen. Praise the Lord. He's achieving
[49:59] now through the church.
[50:03] Amen. Hallelujah. So
[50:05] this evening I want to maybe go just a
[50:08] little bit different direction.
[50:11] Amen. Because we want to look at God.
[50:13] Amen. As a builder or as what you might
[50:17] call a contractor. How many believes
[50:19] that God is a builder? Amen. He's in the
[50:22] building business. Now we we're going to
[50:26] take we're going to take some time on
[50:28] this because we'll never cover a lot of
[50:30] it. that and I'm just feeling trying to
[50:32] feel which way the Holy Spirit wants me
[50:34] to go. But
[50:37] um because there is just so much so much
[50:40] Amen. when we talk about the father's
[50:44] business. Now let me just say uh
[50:51] that God is a contractor. But Abraham
[50:53] says
[50:54] he's a builder.
[50:56] Listen real close. He says God way back
[51:00] yonder. He says now we're going to take
[51:03] the chronological idea of it. God 100
[51:07] billion years ago when he was going to
[51:11] make a world.
[51:14] Amen.
[51:16] Well, he just started and he got an idea
[51:20] in his mind.
[51:23] Amen.
[51:25] Now he said contractor but I want to
[51:27] also bring in the fact that God is not
[51:29] only a contractor
[51:31] but he's a architect.
[51:38] God is a architect.
[51:42] What does an ARCHITECT DO? HE DRAWS UP
[51:44] PLANS.
[51:47] We had to have a statecertified
[51:49] architect to dry up draw up this plan.
[51:52] say in inspector had to approve it and
[51:55] everything to make sure that everything
[51:57] about the building was sound.
[52:01] Amen.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; And God is this architect. I want to say
[52:05] he's he's the contractor.
[52:08] He's the builder.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's everything.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; He's everything.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; And he had something in his mind.
[52:24] Like I said, Sunday when you have an
[52:25] architect when you're building something
[52:28] and I think even with Micah's house when
[52:30] you know we there was just some numbers
[52:31] didn't jive didn't add up. So you have
[52:34] to do whatever you want to do or
[52:36] whatever you can do change it or
[52:38] whatever but this architect
[52:42] he don't never have to change anything.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Now how many believes this is drawn up
[52:49] perfectly?
[52:58] his plan,
[53:00] his will,
[53:11] his plan, and his will.
[53:14] See,
[53:17] wherein Ephesians said, "Wherein he hath
[53:19] abounded towards us in all wisdom and
[53:22] prudence,
[53:24] having made known unto us the mystery of
[53:27] his will,
[53:29] according to the GOOD PLEASURE WHICH HE
[53:32] hath purposed in himself,
[53:36] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[53:38] of times he might gather together in one
[53:40] all things that are in Christ." Amen.
[53:43] both which are in heaven and which are
[53:45] in earth even in him. How many know is
[53:47] that in the fullness of time he will do
[53:49] that he will gather together everything
[53:52] that is in Christ
[53:56] &gt;&gt; the rapture
[53:59] he'll gather his children home like that
[54:02] magnet remember the story the magnet and
[54:04] the great uh in this great factory where
[54:06] they had all kinds of shavings and all
[54:09] kinds of things on the floor but in the
[54:11] evening they bring that great magnet
[54:13] across and everything THAT WASN'T BOLTED
[54:15] DOWN IT but take it up.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bam talking about how
[54:20] that's the way the believer is. If you
[54:22] are not bolted down to something, Amen.
[54:25] And if you're MADE OUT OF THE RIGHT
[54:27] MATERIAL, YOU'LL be pulled up.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; In the same way we are, Amen. the
[54:32] dispensation of he'll gathered together
[54:33] in one all things which are in heaven
[54:35] and which are in on earth, even in him.
[54:39] Now notice, in whom also we have
[54:42] obtained an inheritance,
[54:44] being predestinated according to the
[54:47] purpose of him who WORKKETH ALL THINGS
[54:50] after his plan or the council of his
[54:54] will, ACCORDING TO WHAT HE HAS DRAWN UP.
[54:57] HOW MANY KNOWS everything is working
[55:00] just according to plan?
[55:05] Don't think that things are out of cater
[55:08] and it's a turmoil and it's a mess. NO.
[55:11] BEFORE GOD PUT THE FIRST STAR OUT THERE,
[55:15] he knew exactly the condition that this
[55:18] world would be in at this time.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly THE CONDITION THAT YOU
[55:25] would be in. He knew what you would be
[55:27] up TO AND WHAT YOUR PROBLEM would be.
[55:34] Amen.
[55:36] See, in this great architect and this
[55:38] great builder, especially this
[55:40] architect, I love this scripture BECAUSE
[55:42] I READ IN REVELATIONS 21 WHERE HE WAS,
[55:45] and I love this because he said, "I am
[55:48] the alpha and the omega." That's the A
[55:52] and the Z. I am the beginning and I am
[55:55] the end.
[55:58] How many KNOW THAT GOD KNOWS ALL THINGS?
[56:03] &gt;&gt; He knows everything.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; He knew how much how many knats there
[56:09] would be, HOW MANY TIMES IT WOULD BAT
[56:10] ITS EYE, HOW MUCH TALLY IT WOULD MAKE.
[56:13] THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. HE KNEW
[56:15] EVERYTHING.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; And tonight, THAT'S GOING TO BE MY
[56:19] FOCUS. MY FOCUS IS ON WHAT GOD IS,
[56:24] &gt;&gt; what his plan is,
[56:27] &gt;&gt; AND HIS HOLDING POWER.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY'S GLAD FOR GOD'S HOLDING POWER?
[56:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[56:39] Isn't God good?
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, he is so good.
[56:45] Amen.
[56:50] Praise the Lord.
[56:55] Amen.
[56:58] So he said he was the beginning and the
[57:00] end and that we read pretty much uh I
[57:03] like this because in Revelations there
[57:07] he said he said uh I really like this.
[57:11] He is the beginning and he is the end.
[57:15] Now in Hebrews some some one place it
[57:17] says although the works were done from
[57:20] the foundation of the world. Now when we
[57:23] talk about the works being done from the
[57:25] foundation of the world we're talking
[57:27] about when God says anything it's as
[57:29] good as done.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; How many believe that heaven and earth
[57:32] will pass away but my word will never
[57:34] pass away.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; So even the Bible talks about the works
[57:38] being done from the foundation of the
[57:40] world in the mind of God they're done.
[57:43] And so that's why you could say way over
[57:45] in Revelation and he said unto me it is
[57:48] done.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Remember in CALVARY HE SAID IT IS
[57:52] FINISHED.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; We have COME TO THIS PL THIS PART NOW
[57:56] and it's done.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; I imagine there's going to be some
[58:01] enthusiasm when we sit there and we hear
[58:04] HIM SAY IT'S NOW FINISHED. IT'S OVER
[58:07] WITH NOW.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; THE LAST SERMON'S BEEN PREACHED. THE
[58:10] LAST SERVICE YOU HAD. THE LAST TRAVELING
[58:12] IN THE NIGHT YOU'VE DONE, THE LAST
[58:14] SACRIFICE YOU'VE MADE, THE LAST FUNERAL
[58:16] THAT YOU'VE WENT TO,
[58:19] &gt;&gt; the last time you've BEEN SICK, IT'S ALL
[58:21] OVER NOW. LET ME WIPE THE TEARS FROM MY
[58:24] EYES. THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE NO MORE
[58:25] DEATH. THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE END. THIS
[58:27] IS WHAT I THOUGHT OF FROM THE VERY
[58:30] START. THIS IS WHAT I WANTED. THIS WHAT
[58:33] I HAD IN MY MIND FROM THE VERY START.
[58:41] GLORY.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; How many glad that he's got a plan?
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Let's go deep.
[58:52] Let's go real deep.
[58:59] The prophet of God, he made a statement
[59:01] saying that, you know, you were really
[59:03] never saved on any certain day.
[59:08] is pretty strong. Never saved on any
[59:10] certain day.
[59:12] You was in the mind of God
[59:16] always saved.
[59:21] Come on now.
[59:35] Is it 12 and 8?
[59:41] Come on. I just had it earlier tonight.
[59:45] All right,
[59:47] I'm going to put y'all on the spot.
[59:50] Well, never mind. I found it.
[59:55] I'm still going to put you on the spot.
[59:58] What scripture is this found in? Where's
[1:00:01] this found
[1:00:04] about? And all that dwell upon the earth
[1:00:06] shall worship him whose names are not
[1:00:08] written in the book of life of the lamb
[1:00:10] slain from the foundation of the world.
[1:00:13] Anybody know where that is?
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Yep. But I tried. I thought I could
[1:00:21] remember it. I thought it was like 8:13,
[1:00:24] but at 138
[1:00:27] being twisted over after 60, you know.
[1:00:30] 138. Revelation 138. Amen. And to really
[1:00:35] How many knows that if you ever was
[1:00:38] there, your name was not put on at A
[1:00:40] CERTAIN TIME. IT WAS PUT ON THE LAMB'S
[1:00:43] BOOK OF LIFE FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:00:45] WORLD.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Many times in uh St. John 17, I believe
[1:00:51] it is, HE SAYS, "FOR THE FATHER LOVED ME
[1:00:53] FROM THE FOUNDATION of the world."
[1:00:56] HE KEPT TALKING ABOUT THE FOUNDATION OF
[1:00:58] THE WORLD WAY BACK THEN.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:04] Praise the Lord. It's strong, but it's
[1:01:07] true.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; How many is glad to be a part of God's
[1:01:11] plan?
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; To be a God to be a part of God's plan.
[1:01:17] Amen.
[1:01:19] Now, let me just read a quote to kind of
[1:01:22] relay lay a foundation.
[1:01:25] Bam says he said, "May I stop here just
[1:01:26] a moment and realize I'm facing
[1:01:29] clergymen and smart men, but I just like
[1:01:32] to say this. I believe this and I know
[1:01:34] it. Jesus never went to the cross and
[1:01:36] died for some haphazard affair. Perhaps
[1:01:40] somebody might feel sorry because he
[1:01:43] died in such a terrible way and they'll
[1:01:45] come and get saved." No. God doesn't run
[1:01:48] his business like that. God runs his
[1:01:51] business by forn knowledge,
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; knowing before the world was ever
[1:02:00] formed.
[1:02:09] I hope I didn't leave it back there.
[1:02:18] He makes a statement again. If you've
[1:02:21] got eternal life, in other words, if you
[1:02:23] know that you're saved,
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; you can't really say this if you don't
[1:02:28] if you aren't really saved. No, you
[1:02:31] won't know it. But if you have eternal
[1:02:32] life, if you got eternal life, Bam says,
[1:02:36] then you always were.
[1:02:39] Because there's only one form of eternal
[1:02:41] life, HE SAYS, AND THAT'S GOD'S OWN
[1:02:43] LIFE. AND HE ALWAYS WAS.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; How many KNOWS THAT THAT HOLY GHOST in
[1:02:51] you always was.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And you being in the mind of God, being
[1:02:57] in the thoughts of God, you was with
[1:03:00] God. YOU WERE A PART OF GOD.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; SEE, GOD HAD THOSE THOUGHTS AND HE SPOKE
[1:03:05] THE WORD and they materialized.
[1:03:11] No, I'm not here to preach my own
[1:03:13] message.
[1:03:15] I'm not here to say something the Bible
[1:03:17] don't say. Are you with me?
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; So, let's just see what the Bible says
[1:03:23] about it. See what he says about this.
[1:03:26] Amen.
[1:03:29] Now, I read a little bit and I didn't
[1:03:31] read as much as I'd like to, but I
[1:03:33] already read where he said, "He workketh
[1:03:36] all things according to the purpose and
[1:03:39] counsel of his own will that we should
[1:03:42] be to the praise of his glory, who first
[1:03:45] trusted in Christ." Now in Ephesians 1:3
[1:03:48] it says blessed be the God and father of
[1:03:50] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:03:52] with all spiritual blessings in CHRIST
[1:03:55] IN HEAVENLY PLACES IN Christ according
[1:03:59] as he hath chosen us in him before the
[1:04:05] foundation of the world.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; How many believes this word? Now not
[1:04:09] everybody can believe that. A lot of
[1:04:11] churches don't believe that. But if you
[1:04:14] don't, then you deny God's word. You How
[1:04:18] many believe you? You deny. You say
[1:04:20] God's a liar. No. Or Paul's a liar. No.
[1:04:26] It happened before the foundation of the
[1:04:29] world.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[1:04:39] God's not like me.
[1:04:42] I'll get a foundation together and I'll
[1:04:45] put the all the flooring down or
[1:04:47] whatever and I'll say, "Honey, let's
[1:04:49] come up here and let's design this
[1:04:51] house. Let's see where the bathroom's
[1:04:54] going to be, all where this is going to
[1:04:56] be and that's going to be,
[1:05:00] uh, you know, after we get so many of
[1:05:01] the walls up, well, I'm not sure how the
[1:05:04] roof's going to be.
[1:05:06] Just go ALONG AS FIGURE IT OUT AS YOU
[1:05:10] GO.
[1:05:12] SOME PEOPLE THINK GOD IS LIKE THAT.
[1:05:14] GOD'S NOT LIKE THAT. NO. God has the
[1:05:19] perfect plan. HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IT'S
[1:05:22] GOING TO BE BEFORE HE EVER STARTS.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. How many knows THAT WAY BEFORE UH
[1:05:34] uh the little children Herod was killing
[1:05:37] all the children, there was a scripture
[1:05:39] wrote of Rachel. weeping for her
[1:05:41] CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY WERE not
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; hundreds OF YEARS BEFORE HE PROPHESIED
[1:05:47] THAT HE WOULD DO THAT.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; And when the time came, and I don't know
[1:05:59] about you, but can you imagine your
[1:06:01] twoyear-old?
[1:06:03] How old's charity now?
[1:06:06] Seven already. Unbelievable.
[1:06:10] ain't two or three anymore. Time goes so
[1:06:13] fast.
[1:06:16] We don't have any two-year-olds. We got
[1:06:18] a new one.
[1:06:24] Salem, maybe SA,
[1:06:28] but she's not a boy, so that don't
[1:06:29] count.
[1:06:32] [clears throat] But anyway, THERE THE
[1:06:34] THE BOYS FROM HOW MANY KNOWS FROM TWO
[1:06:36] YEARS AND DOWN. CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING
[1:06:38] YOUR LITTLE BOY RIPPED OUT OF YOUR ARMS
[1:06:40] AND thrust through with a sword
[1:06:43] right in front of you? That'd be
[1:06:44] horrible. But they did it all through
[1:06:47] the land.
[1:06:51] Amen.
[1:06:53] But what DID THE ANGEL TELL JOSEPH AND
[1:06:55] MARY? FLEE. GO ON UP HERE.
[1:06:59] GET OUT OF HERE.
[1:07:05] What was it that uh
[1:07:08] I love that special y'all saying?
[1:07:11] You have already made a way. There was a
[1:07:14] phrase in there, you have already made a
[1:07:15] way.
[1:07:19] All right, we're going to go down this
[1:07:21] trail right here for just a minute
[1:07:24] in 1 Corinthians 10.
[1:07:27] 1 Corinthians 10.
[1:07:31] 1 Corinthians 10 10 and verse 13 says,
[1:07:34] "There has no temptation taken you, but
[1:07:37] such is common to man. But God is
[1:07:40] faithful, who will not suffer you to be
[1:07:42] uh tempted above that you are able, but
[1:07:45] will with THE TEMPTATION ALSO MAKE A way
[1:07:49] of escape that you may be able to bear
[1:07:53] it."
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad that when
[1:07:56] God designed his thing
[1:08:00] that he ALWAYS MADE A WAY? IT DOESN'T
[1:08:02] MATTER WHAT QUESTION COMES UP. NO MATTER
[1:08:05] WHAT TRIAL OR TEMPTATION OR WHETHER YOU
[1:08:08] WANT TO CALL IT A TEST, NO MATTER WHAT
[1:08:11] COMES UP, GOD HAS A AVENUE OF ESCAPE,
[1:08:15] HE'S GOT AN ANSWER FOR IT.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:08:21] It don't matter what it is.
[1:08:24] See the first Adam,
[1:08:28] how many knows that he took us all into
[1:08:31] death?
[1:08:33] He took us all into death. But what did
[1:08:36] God do?
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. HE BROUGHT US A SECOND ADAM.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Here it is. Brother Bam said, "Now
[1:08:50] you're going to say, WELL, IF HE'S SUCH
[1:08:52] GREAT, so great, Brother Bam, HOW DO YOU
[1:08:54] HOW DID HE EVER PERMIT THE devil to make
[1:08:57] sin?" Well, he says, "He knew before the
[1:09:02] devil was ever created that he would be
[1:09:04] a devil."
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, now glory. He says, "I feel
[1:09:10] religious now." HE KNEW BEFORE THE
[1:09:12] DEVIL, AMEN, WAS EVER A DEVIL THAT he
[1:09:14] would become a devil.
[1:09:19] No, he didn't. Oh, really? You reckon it
[1:09:22] was a surprise to God?
[1:09:26] Man, this guy just jumped up on my
[1:09:28] congregation and man, I don't know. Let
[1:09:30] me see what WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
[1:09:33] Nothing surprises God.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing surprises God.
[1:09:41] He knows WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FACE
[1:09:43] TOMORROW, THE NEXT DAY.
[1:09:47] HE KNOWS WHAT'S COMING IN 2026.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WE
[1:09:53] DON'T.
[1:09:57] [screaming]
[1:09:58] BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WORLD, LET ME TELL
[1:10:00] YOU WHO WE'VE WORKED FOR. LET ME TELL
[1:10:02] YOU ABOUT MY BOSS. MY BOSS HAS
[1:10:05] EVERYTHING IN CONTROL.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO WHATEVER COMES UP, HE'S GOING
[1:10:11] TO TAKE CARE OF.
[1:10:15] HE'S A GOD THAT ALWAYS MAKES A WAY.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; MAKES A WAY OF ESCAPE.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; He knew that that devil WOULD BE A
[1:10:23] DEVIL. HE KNEW ADAM AND EVE WOULD FALL.
[1:10:25] HE knew Eve would fall.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Sure he did.
[1:10:33] What I'm trying to say tonight is this.
[1:10:36] that no matter how devil the devil is,
[1:10:39] NO MATTER HOW DEVILISH THE DEVIL IS, NO
[1:10:42] HOW MUCH EVIL THE WORLD IS, NO MATTER
[1:10:44] HOW MUCH SIN that there is. AMEN.
[1:10:47] THERE'S A GREATER POWER THAN THE DEVIL.
[1:10:49] THERE'S A GREATER POWER THAN SIN.
[1:10:51] THERE'S A GREATER POWER THAN HEALING, I
[1:10:53] MEAN, THAN SICKNESS. [applause] GOD HAS
[1:10:56] MADE A WAY. [cheering]
[1:10:58] WHY? BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE THAT DREW IT
[1:11:01] UP.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE PUT IN ISAIAH THERE. AMEN.
[1:11:04] and by his stripes we are healed.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; SO MANY TIMES JESUS SAID, "WHATEVER YOU
[1:11:12] ASK IN MY NAME, I WILL DO IT.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; IF YOU ABIDE IN ME AND MY WORDS ABIDE IN
[1:11:17] YOU, YOU CAN ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND YOU
[1:11:20] SHALL HAVE IT." HOW MANY BELIEVES WE'RE
[1:11:22] ON THOSE BASIS? THAT'S THE ARCHITECT OF
[1:11:25] ALMIGHTY GOD IS TO GIVE US AUTHORITY
[1:11:28] AGAIN THE WAY THAT ADAM HAD IT BEFORE
[1:11:30] THE FALL.
[1:11:33] HOW MANY BELIEVE TONIGHT THAT WE CAN BE
[1:11:34] AS HAPPY AS ADAM AND EVE WERE BEFORE THE
[1:11:37] FALL?
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; THIS BODY IS THE ONLY THING THAT WE'RE
[1:11:41] WAITING ON FOR A CHANGE. THE INSIDE HAS
[1:11:44] ALREADY BEEN CHANGED.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS ALREADY BROUGHT US BACK TO
[1:11:49] HIMSELF.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; HAS LOST CHILDREN. HE'S ALREADY BROUGHT
[1:11:52] US BACK TO HIM. HE'S ALREADY FORGIVEN US
[1:11:56] IN HIS GREAT DESIGN. HE KNEW WE'D BE IN
[1:11:59] A SINFUL CONDITION. THAT'S WHY
[1:12:01] [screaming] IN HIS MIND HE KNEW, AMEN,
[1:12:03] THAT HE WOULD GO DOWN INTO HIS SON AND
[1:12:05] THAT HE WOULD GO TO CALVARY, THAT HE
[1:12:06] WOULD [screaming] DIE.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD,
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; THAT HE WOULD PAY FOR YOUR SINS. THAT HE
[1:12:10] WOULD MAKE A BLEACH THAT WOULD ERADICATE
[1:12:12] YOUR SIN,
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; ERADICATE YOUR GUILT,
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; NOW WE CAN LIVE IN SUCH A WAY. LET ME
[1:12:18] TELL YOU, WE CAN LIVE IN SUCH A WAY AND
[1:12:20] SO CLOSE TO GOD THAT you can die in
[1:12:24] peace.
[1:12:27] Have you ever heard that said about Oh,
[1:12:30] they died peacefully.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:38] We know of men that have said, "Hey,
[1:12:41] who's dying here? Raise them curtains.
[1:12:43] PLAY ME SOME MUSIC HERE." AMEN. Who's
[1:12:46] dying here? He's ready TO GO HOME.
[1:12:47] FOSWORTH. NO, BROTHER BEN. I'M NOT
[1:12:50] DYING. I'M JUST GOING HOME. WHAT WAS THE
[1:12:52] GREATEST TIME OF YOUR LIFE?
[1:12:55] THE SADDEST TIME OF OUR LIFE IS TO WATCH
[1:12:57] SOMEBODY DIE.
[1:13:00] HELLO.
[1:13:01] But he said, "THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT
[1:13:03] I'VE BEEN LIVING FOR. THIS IS WHAT I'VE
[1:13:05] BEEN WAITING FOR IS TO GO INTO HEAVEN,
[1:13:07] GO INTO HIS PRESENCE, and died without
[1:13:11] fear, shaking hands of loved ones. Can
[1:13:13] you imagine?
[1:13:15] Can you imagine somebody getting up out
[1:13:16] of their deathbed off after they've been
[1:13:18] in a coma for a while and just get up
[1:13:20] out of the bed, start shaking
[1:13:23] everybody's hands,
[1:13:25] shaking people's hands,
[1:13:27] shaking people's hands, shaking people's
[1:13:30] hands.
[1:13:32] Only
[1:13:34] you don't even see him.
[1:13:39] Boy, he's really went in a coma. That's
[1:13:41] what we think. He's
[1:13:43] He's way out there.
[1:13:46] But it was real
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; of people he led to Christ.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; How many's glad that God has made it in
[1:13:54] such a way
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; that you don't even have to be in fear
[1:13:57] of death.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Don't have to be afraid.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; You can die in peace. Paul said, "Oh,
[1:14:04] death, where's your sting?"
[1:14:07] I don't know if he did, but oh death,
[1:14:10] WHERE'S YOUR STING?
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; OH, GRAVE, WHERE'S YOUR VICTORY? WOO!
[1:14:15] [screaming]
[1:14:15] BUT I THANK CHRIST WHO GIVES US THE
[1:14:18] VICTORY.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; I don't imagine he does give us the
[1:14:21] victory, I guess.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; NO, HE GIVES US THE VICTORY THROUGH
[1:14:27] JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD. HOW MANY IS GLAD
[1:14:29] THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN DEFEAT?
[1:14:31] You can live in VICTORY BECAUSE IT'S IN
[1:14:33] THE DESIGN. [cheering and screaming]
[1:14:36] [applause] THE ARCHITECT drew it UP SO
[1:14:39] THAT YOU COULD LIVE VICTORIOUS.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; SO YOU COULD HAVE FULLNESS OF JOY
[1:14:45] SO YOU COULD HAVE COMFORT TO THE UTMOST.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; I LIKE THAT. COMFORT TO THE UTMOST.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; THE UTMOST. COMFORT. COMFORT TO THE
[1:14:55] UTMOST.
[1:14:57] Wonderful com. Wonderful comfort.
[1:15:03] Mhm.
[1:15:05] That's right. Brother Bram said that's
[1:15:08] what they used to do the Pentecost that
[1:15:09] they lick their lips. It's honey in the
[1:15:12] rock. It's so good. Now I know what he's
[1:15:14] talking about. Makes you feel like
[1:15:16] licking your lips a little bit. Mhm.
[1:15:18] That's good stuff.
[1:15:21] How many's laugh for good stuff?
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; I'm beginning to wonder about y'all.
[1:15:26] Y'all in this
[1:15:29] it so much until you begin to lick your
[1:15:31] lips.
[1:15:33] God is good.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; We'll do it for other things.
[1:15:39] YOU'LL GET A GOOD OLDFASHIONED SOMETHING
[1:15:41] kind of good food and you'll lick your
[1:15:43] lips.
[1:15:45] That was good. You might lick your
[1:15:46] fingers.
[1:15:50] That that barbecue rib was good. How
[1:15:54] many knows that? Oh, taste and see that
[1:15:57] the Lord is good is what the Bible says.
[1:15:59] OH, TASTE AND SEE THAT THE LORD IS GOOD.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; How many KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL
[1:16:04] ABOUT? IT'S ABOUT GOD COMING DOWN AND
[1:16:07] MAKING A WAY FOR US.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; IT'S [screaming]
[1:16:13] ALREADY DONE.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVES IT'S ALREADY DONE?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID IT. THERE'S GOING TO BE A
[1:16:21] RAPTURE. IF YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE IN IT AND
[1:16:23] THE PART OF GOD, THEN IT'S ALREADY AS
[1:16:26] GOOD AS FINISHED. IT'S ALREADY DONE.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOWS IF YOU'RE EVER GOING TO
[1:16:30] GET HEALED, YOU HAVE TO TESTIFY THAT
[1:16:32] IT'S ALREADY DONE.
[1:16:35] WOO! [screaming]
[1:16:36] THE BEGINNING, THE END, IT'S ALREADY
[1:16:39] DONE.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID [screaming] IT, IT WILL BE. SO,
[1:16:44] IF YOU ARE A PART OF THAT PLAN, YOU
[1:16:46] CAN'T MISS IT MORE THAN NOTHING.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:16:51] BROTHER B SAYS YOU CAN'T NO MORE PASS
[1:16:52] AWAY THAN GOD CAN PASS AWAY IF YOU'RE
[1:16:54] PART OF HIM.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; NO, YOU CAN'T THAT THAT THOUGHT CAN'T BE
[1:17:00] DEVIATED FROM.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; I've been a Christian since 20 years
[1:17:06] old.
[1:17:07] And I'm here to tell you something.
[1:17:11] I didn't do the hanging on.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; I didn't do the hanging on.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; You didn't DO THE HANGING ON. HE DID THE
[1:17:19] HANGING ON. AMEN. WHEN YOU BACKSLIDE, HE
[1:17:21] DOES THE HANGING ON. HE HANGS ON TO YOU.
[1:17:24] HE WON'T LET YOU GO. [screaming] HE
[1:17:26] WON'T LET YOU GO.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Crazy free training.
[1:17:46] [sighs and gasps]
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Got to be myself, right? Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we can be happy with our
[1:17:52] religion.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; How many glad for a heartfelt religion?
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; You feel it down in your soul. It's not
[1:18:01] just in my head. It's down here.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; That's what I WANT TO LIVE FOR. THAT'S
[1:18:06] WHAT I LIVE BY. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO
[1:18:08] PREACH BY. WHAT'S DOWN IN HERE?
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; This isn't THE GREAT ONE. THAT'S THE
[1:18:16] GREAT ONE. THE ONE THAT'S IN ME. GREATER
[1:18:19] IS HE THAT IS IN ME THAN IN ME THAT IS
[1:18:22] in the world.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; It don't hurt to give HIM A LITTLE CLAP
[1:18:27] AND SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD, FOR 2025.
[1:18:30] THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US THROUGH 2025.
[1:18:33] THANK YOU FOR HOLDING US TOGETHER AS A
[1:18:34] CHURCH IN 2025. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING
[1:18:37] ME CLOSER TO YOU IN 2025. AND IN 2026,
[1:18:41] YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET. [applause]
[1:18:46] WOO! [cheering]
[1:18:48] We're getting CLOSER TO THAT PLACE.
[1:18:49] WE'RE GETTING CLOSER TO HOME. AND THE
[1:18:51] CLOSER WE GET TO HOME, THE MORE WE'RE
[1:18:53] GOING TO RUN,
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; the louder we're going to scream,
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; the more we're going to rejoice.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz when we get over there, it's going
[1:19:01] to sound like thunder.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; That great voice OF A MULTITUDE SOUNDED
[1:19:06] LIKE THUNDER, SAYING, "HONOR AND GLORY
[1:19:10] AND POWER AND STRENGTH BE TO HIM THAT
[1:19:12] SITS ON THE THRONE HAS REDEEMED US BACK
[1:19:15] TO GOD.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; that allowed us to get lost so he can
[1:19:21] find us.
[1:19:24] All that the father has given me will
[1:19:27] come to me and I will lose none of them.
[1:19:30] I give them them eternal life and they
[1:19:33] shall never perish.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Not about those that just get a touch of
[1:19:39] the anointing just to deeper that or the
[1:19:41] other. But if God saves you, you're a
[1:19:44] saved person.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; How many slad for that?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Woo. [screaming]
[1:19:50] If he's kept me this long, HE'LL KEEPING
[1:19:53] ME.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE I'M A PART OF THE PLAN. HOW
[1:19:57] MANY GLAD TO BE A PART OF THE PLAN?
[1:20:00] HALLELUJAH. THIS IS HIS WILL
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; AND YOUR NAME IS IN THE WILL.
[1:20:08] [applause]
[1:20:14] Wouldn't you be shocked, Sister Mary
[1:20:16] Jane, Jessica, y'all back? Wouldn't you
[1:20:19] be shocked some guy in a black suit come
[1:20:23] back in here, come with his briefcase,
[1:20:25] set it on that last pew, open that
[1:20:27] briefcase, come over and hand y'all a
[1:20:29] letter.
[1:20:31] So, here you go.
[1:20:35] You're here is a a statement that you
[1:20:39] are part of an inheritance. You have
[1:20:41] received an inheritance.
[1:20:48] We might say, Donald Trump,
[1:20:51] you were in his will. You were in his
[1:20:54] will. And you hold that envelope. WE
[1:20:58] ARE. WE'RE PART of him, you know.
[1:21:02] Let me rip that thing open. Let me tap
[1:21:05] that thing down so I don't rip the
[1:21:06] paper. And rip the end open. Open. Well,
[1:21:11] how much?
[1:21:13] Open it up. Amen. You have inherited
[1:21:18] $2 billion.
[1:21:26] Brother Thomas and have to close church.
[1:21:28] All right, folks. We're just going to do
[1:21:29] what the Bible says and rejoice. told to
[1:21:31] rejoice the rest of the night. All
[1:21:32] right.
[1:21:36] Cuz there ain't going to be nothing else
[1:21:37] going on.
[1:21:42] Amen.
[1:21:44] But how many KNOWS
[1:21:46] WE'VE GOT OUR NAME IN HIS WILL AND WE
[1:21:50] WILL INHERIT THE EARTH. AND WE'RE SO
[1:21:53] QUIET
[1:21:55] [applause]
[1:21:56] when he said, "YOUR MEEK SHALL INHERIT
[1:21:58] THE [screaming] EARTH.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:22:02] [cheering]
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; ONE PLACE HE SAYS SHALL INHERIT ALL
[1:22:05] THINGS. PAUL SAID ALL THINGS ARE YOU
[1:22:08] YOURS. WHETHER THINGS PRE PRESENT, LIFE,
[1:22:10] DEATH, AMEN, EVEN DEATH, EVERYTHING IT'S
[1:22:13] YOURS.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; PRINCIPALITIES, POWERS, IT'S ALL YOURS.
[1:22:17] HOW MANY KNOWS WHEN YOU'RE A PART OF
[1:22:19] GOD, GOD OWNS IT ALL.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; GOD OWNS THE CATTLE ON A THOUSAND HILLS.
[1:22:23] YOU OWN THE CATTLE ON A THOUSAND HILLS.
[1:22:25] YOU'RE A JOY.
[1:22:28] AMEN. [sighs and gasps]
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; HE OWNS HEALING. YOU OWN HEALING. SAY,
[1:22:32] "HEALING IS MINE. SALVATION IS MINE.
[1:22:35] HAPPINESS IS MINE. JOY IS MINE. HEALTH
[1:22:39] IS [screaming] MINE."
[1:22:44] The architect said, "So, the builder is
[1:22:47] making it happen."
[1:22:51] Oh my.
[1:22:54] Told myself I'd quit at 20 after and
[1:22:56] sing a couple songs. Let you out early.
[1:22:58] So, ready? Time's quick.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Time goes fast when you're having fun,
[1:23:03] didn't it? [panting]
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more?
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Troy and Robin didn't come all that way
[1:23:09] just to be cut short, right? We're going
[1:23:11] to make sure you get that apple pie and
[1:23:13] a little bit of dessert now, right?
[1:23:15] Appreciate those who travel far. Amen.
[1:23:17] And near. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:21] But let me just say this, maybe take
[1:23:23] this in closing perhaps on a more
[1:23:25] negative thought. Don't like the
[1:23:27] negative. I don't like to close on a
[1:23:28] negative, but I'm going to do this. He
[1:23:31] says, brother Bam, illustrated. He says,
[1:23:32] you know, and talks about if a if a
[1:23:36] contractor or a bu, let's say somebody
[1:23:38] wants a house built, he hands the plan.
[1:23:41] He hands the plan because uh remember
[1:23:44] Paul talked about, you know, that Paul
[1:23:46] built something, Jesus being the
[1:23:47] cornerstone and the foundation. Isn't
[1:23:49] that right? Uh I'm not going to go to
[1:23:52] it, I don't think, but in Ephesians, it
[1:23:53] talks about all the whole uh building
[1:23:57] fitly framed together being built upon
[1:23:59] the apostles and prophets and so forth.
[1:24:01] Ain't that right? How God is building
[1:24:03] this building? And he also another
[1:24:06] scripture talks about now if anybody
[1:24:07] built wood or stubble or whatever, he
[1:24:10] says, "And if it DOESN'T HOLD UP, IT'LL
[1:24:12] BE BURNT." Ain't that right? SO WHEN
[1:24:15] YOU'RE BUILDING THIS BUILDING AND YOU
[1:24:17] GIVE IT TO A CONTRACTOR TO BUILD, AMEN.
[1:24:19] THEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT
[1:24:21] CONTRACTOR HAS TO BUILD IT THE WAY THAT
[1:24:23] the design and THE ARCHITECT HAS DRAWN
[1:24:25] IT UP.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO
[1:24:28] DO? WE GOT TO BUILD IT THE WAY THAT THE
[1:24:30] ARCHITECT IS DRAWING IT.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "SO HE GOES OFF TO FLORIDA
[1:24:35] AND HE SAYS, "BUILD MY HOUSE AND WHEN I
[1:24:37] COME BACK IN A FEW MONTHS, I WANT IT ALL
[1:24:39] DONE." HE COMES BACK AND IT'S DONE.
[1:24:42] AND THEN HE FINDS OUT THAT GUESS WHAT?
[1:24:43] THAT BAY WINDOW ISN'T IN THE KITCHEN
[1:24:45] LIKE HE WANTED. NO, THEY FOR SOME REASON
[1:24:47] THOUGHT IT WOULD FIT better and do
[1:24:49] better in the bedroom,
[1:24:52] you know, AND THEY MADE THE PORCH JUST A
[1:24:54] LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. And what is one of
[1:24:56] them wind things that you put on top of
[1:24:58] a roof called a wind something?
[1:25:02] Wind?
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Well, you know your little box on top
[1:25:08] and it has north, west, east, south.
[1:25:12] Thank you. That's what I was looking. A
[1:25:13] weather vein. THAT'S RIGHT. HE COMES UP
[1:25:16] AND HE LOOKS ON HIS HOUSE AND HE'S BEING
[1:25:17] A WEATHER vein
[1:25:19] and HE SAYS, "I DON'T SEE THAT ON THE
[1:25:22] PRINT. WHY? WE THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK
[1:25:24] GOOD."
[1:25:28] WELL, WE JUST THOUGHT THE BAY WINDOW
[1:25:29] WOULD BE BETTER OVER HERE.
[1:25:32] HOW MANY KNOW SOME PEOPLE THINK, AMEN.
[1:25:34] ACTS 2:38, HE SAYS, "GO YE." AMEN. And
[1:25:38] wait A MINUTE.
[1:25:39] PETER SAID TO THEM, "REPENT EVERY ONE OF
[1:25:41] YOU, AND BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF THE
[1:25:43] LORD JESUS CHRIST FOR THE REMISSION OF
[1:25:44] YOUR SINS, AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE
[1:25:46] GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST, PROMISES TO YOU,
[1:25:48] TO YOUR CHILDREN, TO THEM THAT ARE FAR
[1:25:49] OFF." THAT'S THE BLUEPRINT.
[1:25:52] JESUS SAID, "GO INTO ALL THE WORLD,
[1:25:54] PREACH THE GOSPEL, TEACH ALL NATIONS,
[1:25:56] BAPTIZING THEM IN THE NAME OF, NOT THE
[1:25:59] TITLE OF FATHER, NOT THE TITLE OF SON,
[1:26:01] NOT THE TITLE OF THE HOLY GHOST, BUT I
[1:26:03] WANT YOU TO USE THE NAMES OF THE TITLE."
[1:26:05] SOMEBODY SAYS, "YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S
[1:26:06] JUST BETTER that we do what Jesus said
[1:26:08] instead of Peter said, and we'll just
[1:26:10] use the titles."
[1:26:13] Nobody ever was baptized in the Bible
[1:26:16] ever one time under the titles of
[1:26:17] fathers on the Holy Ghost. Not one
[1:26:19] person. Everybody was baptized in the
[1:26:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Do you
[1:26:23] think they had it right? But no, you can
[1:26:25] tell people that and they don't care
[1:26:26] what you say. THEY DON'T CARE WHETHER
[1:26:28] YOU SAY, "NOBODY WAS EVER DONE THAT
[1:26:30] WAY." THEY THEY STILL WANT TO BUILD IT
[1:26:31] THEIR WAY.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; NO, WE'RE STILL GOING TO DO IT THIS WAY.
[1:26:34] GO AHEAD,
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; GOD. But we're HERE TO TELL YOU WHEN THE
[1:26:38] MASTER COMES, HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
[1:26:40] THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE PRINT WAS
[1:26:41] SUPPOSED TO BE.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, LET'S LET'S GET
[1:26:47] PEOPLE. I THINK IT'D BE NICE, MUCH
[1:26:49] EASIER." THIS IS PART OF THE REASON THEY
[1:26:50] SPRINKLE PEOPLE, PEOPLE THAT WERE UH
[1:26:52] MAYBE in wheelchairs or in inlet AND SO
[1:26:54] FORTH. AND AND MAY IT BE EASIER. LET'S
[1:26:56] JUST TAKE A CUP OF WATER AND SPRINKLE
[1:26:58] THEM.
[1:27:00] NOW, let me tell you something. There's
[1:27:01] a big different interpretation of
[1:27:03] sprinkling and baptizing.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Baptizing means getting to the water and
[1:27:07] immersing.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And they COME UP WITH
[1:27:11] JUST SPRINKLING AND USING THE WRONG
[1:27:13] TITLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE OR PUT JUST
[1:27:15] SHAKING THERE. LET THAT LET'S JUST GET A
[1:27:17] BOOK TOGETHER AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF
[1:27:18] THIS CHURCH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IN OUR
[1:27:20] CHURCH BOOK.
[1:27:23] And if you aren't A MEMBER OF OUR CHURCH
[1:27:24] BOOK, YOU'RE NOT SAVED. WELL, the Amish
[1:27:28] may not have a book, but they many
[1:27:29] churches think, well, if you're not a
[1:27:30] part of them, they're not saved. Hello.
[1:27:33] What do we believe here? [snorts] You're
[1:27:35] not saved because you go to this church.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; No more saved than a than a than a a pig
[1:27:42] is a sheep.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; No. Not one bit does where you go to
[1:27:47] church have whether you're saved or not.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you this, we will give you
[1:27:52] the right recipe. We will tell you
[1:27:54] according to the print that you've GOT
[1:27:55] TO BE BORN [screaming] AGAIN.
[1:27:58] YOU'VE GOT TO BE BORN BY THE SPIRIT OF
[1:28:00] GOD. NOW, HE THAT HATH NOT THE SPIRIT OF
[1:28:03] GOD, PAUL SAID, IS NONE OF HIS. AND BY
[1:28:05] ONE SPIRIT ARE WE ALL BAPTIZED INTO ONE
[1:28:08] BODY AND MEMBERS IN PARTICULAR. I MEAN,
[1:28:11] THAT'S HOW WE BECOME MEMBERS. BY GETTING
[1:28:13] SAVED, BY GETTING THE HOLY GHOST ON US,
[1:28:15] THEN YOU BECOME A PART OF THE BODY
[1:28:17] UNIVERSAL.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Don't deviate on the plan. Boy, I'm here
[1:28:24] to tell you, look around. Some people
[1:28:26] can have a tractor, but you got to put
[1:28:28] steel wheels on it. And I'm here to tell
[1:28:30] you, you're going to go through great
[1:28:31] expense and making them little ribs all
[1:28:32] around on every wheel and try to make
[1:28:35] them worthwhile something. Just throw a
[1:28:37] tire on it and put the hammer down and
[1:28:39] enjoy IT LIKE THEM OLD LADIES do flying
[1:28:41] down the road, will you?
[1:28:44] THAT'S RIGHT. WHY? ALL THESE DIFFERENT
[1:28:47] THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE, ALL THESE
[1:28:49] DIFFERENT IDEAS PEOPLE HAVE, ALL THESE
[1:28:51] DIFFERENT THE CHURCHES HAVE. WHAT IS IT?
[1:28:53] IT'S A DEVIATION.
[1:28:55] JESUS SAID, "YOU MAKE BY THE WORD OF GOD
[1:28:57] OF NONE EFFECT BECAUSE OF THE TRADITIONS
[1:29:00] THAT YOU HAVE PUT IN THERE. BY YOUR OWN
[1:29:02] TRADITIONS, YOU MAKE THE WORD OF GOD OF
[1:29:04] NONE EFFECT."
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; You got TO STAY WITH THE WORD.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Got to be born again.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:12] How many's glad for the architect that
[1:29:15] is promised?
[1:29:18] He that hath begun a good work in you
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; will perform it.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; I want to go on but I won't go too far.
[1:29:30] according he has chosen us and him
[1:29:31] before the foundation of the world that
[1:29:33] we should be holy and without blame
[1:29:36] before him in love having predestinated
[1:29:41] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:29:42] Jesus Christ according TO THE GOOD
[1:29:45] PLEASURE of his own will
[1:29:49] he does what he wants when he wants with
[1:29:52] who he wants.
[1:29:56] Amen.
[1:29:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:04] Let me just
[1:30:08] cap this off
[1:30:10] or so to speak drive the nail in.
[1:30:14] Romans 8 says, "For whom he did forno."
[1:30:18] Remember, God runs his business by
[1:30:22] fornowledge.
[1:30:25] He solves the problem
[1:30:28] before he gets there.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; I mean knows he makes the way.
[1:30:35] You don't think he knew that Israel
[1:30:36] would come down to the Red Sea?
[1:30:39] Sure. And he would have the chariots of
[1:30:42] Israel coming right at him and listened
[1:30:43] to just what they hear them coming. He
[1:30:46] wanted them to hear it coming. He wanted
[1:30:48] him. He wanted it to roar.
[1:30:52] man. Here, listen. That scared the liver
[1:30:54] out of those Israelites.

[1:31:28] WHICH WAY TO GO. SO, I'M TRUSTING YOU,
[1:31:30] LORD.

[1:31:35] and son and daughter, God of his, he
[1:31:37] takes them all to that place to see
[1:31:40] whether you'll lean to your own

[1:37:43] there, Lord Jesus. There be mercy there.
[1:37:46] There would be repentance on each one of
[1:37:48] their parts, Lord Jesus. Bring a heart
[1:37:50] of repentance. Bring a heart of sorrow,
[1:37:52] a sadness for where they're wrong and
[1:37:54] what they've done wrong. May they
[1:37:56] confess their wrong, Lord Jesus, and
[1:37:58] come back together. We look for it now
[1:38:00] in Jesus [singing] name.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God bless you.
