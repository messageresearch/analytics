[11:00] this's one together oh spare me that I
[11:03] may recover strength before I go hands
[11:06] and be no more God bless you may be
[11:08] seated brother
[11:26] Brian good morning brothers and sisters
[11:31] you know I was just thinking as we were
[11:33] reading as we were reading that Psalm
[11:35] this
[11:37] morning you know people have a tendency
[11:39] to want to build kingdoms here on the
[11:41] Earth but you can't take it with you you
[11:43] can build all the wealth have all the
[11:46] natural things in the world but when you
[11:48] die you can't take them with you so and
[11:51] like the psalm was saying the only thing
[11:52] we have hope of is what's on the other
[11:55] side and I was just thinking this
[11:58] morning over there um you know the world
[12:00] we live in is just headed to Oblivion
[12:02] they're just they're you know your
[12:05] preachers will tell you they they've
[12:07] they're going through the guard rails
[12:09] well they're they're past the guard
[12:10] rails they've overrun any type of
[12:13] semblance of modesty or morality in the
[12:17] world today they just run completely
[12:19] over the top of it and they're just
[12:20] headed to Oblivion and there's no coming
[12:23] back and I was just thinking over there
[12:26] about you know in the book Pilgrim's
[12:30] Progress the the first step you had to
[12:32] make is you all had to come everyone had
[12:34] to come through the wicked gate if you
[12:36] didn't come through the wicked gate you
[12:38] weren't going to be there on that day
[12:39] and is when you came through the wicked
[12:41] gate you went to the house of The
[12:43] Interpreter and you received your
[12:45] certificate if you didn't have that
[12:47] certificate no matter if you didn't come
[12:50] through the gate and you didn't get that
[12:52] certificate on the other day when they
[12:54] asked to see it you were lost and it and
[12:57] simply it means if you have haven't
[12:59] received salvation through the baptism
[13:02] of the Holy Ghost where God has placed
[13:04] his spirit in you you won't be there on
[13:07] that day and everything in the world
[13:08] this morning is trying to get you from
[13:12] that way they want you to go every other
[13:14] way but the right way this morning and I
[13:17] was
[13:19] um I was thinking if you you don't have
[13:21] to turn to it and it and I was thinking
[13:24] I was reading in job also this morning
[13:27] in the last couple of days I you don't
[13:29] have to turn to this chapter but it's in
[13:31] job 16 you got to be careful who your
[13:34] friends are but this is what job had to
[13:36] say to his friends not trying to have
[13:38] some humor here but and these are the
[13:41] three people that came to job to be to
[13:43] talk to him and this is what job had to
[13:45] say about him then an excuse me then job
[13:49] answered and
[13:50] said I have heard many such things
[13:53] miserable comforters are you all and
[13:55] he's basically telling his friends you
[13:57] haven't been any help to me you have
[13:59] accused me of secret sin of of hiding
[14:02] Sin from the Lord but none of this am I
[14:04] guilty of and I'm jumping over here
[14:08] to uh I was reading in Jeremiah thinking
[14:11] of I'm if I'm jumping around you'll have
[14:14] to forgive me this morning but I was
[14:16] thinking also in the world that with
[14:18] what's going on in Israel this morning
[14:21] the whole you know the Bible says the
[14:24] whole world will turn its face against
[14:26] the the children of Israel and is is it
[14:30] as it keeps each year goes by each month
[14:33] goes by you can see the whole world is
[14:35] just just ready to go on the different
[14:37] things I will just
[14:38] read this is what uh God's word said out
[14:41] of teronomy excuse me Jeremiah the 47th
[14:46] chapter it's not a very long chapter
[14:48] this has to do with Gaza this is what
[14:50] the Lord from Jeremiah had to say about
[14:53] Gaza and the area of Gaza is where the
[14:55] Philistines used to live many thousands
[14:58] of years years ago and this is the
[15:00] prophecy that Jeremiah gave to the
[15:03] Philistines and the word of the Lord
[15:05] that came to Jeremiah the prophet
[15:07] against the Philistines before the
[15:10] Pharaoh smoke Gaza and he goes on to say
[15:13] thus sayeth the Lord behold Waters rise
[15:15] up out of the North and they shall be an
[15:18] overflowing flood that shall overflow
[15:20] the land that all that is therein City
[15:23] and them that dwell
[15:25] therein then the men shall cry and all
[15:27] the inhabitants of the land man shall
[15:29] how at the noise of the
[15:48] stamplistic and from sedan every helper
[15:51] that remaineth for the Lord will spoil
[15:53] the Philistines and the remnant of the
[15:55] country of my pronouncing a in here cap
[15:59] the baldness to come upon Gaza and
[16:01] Escalon to cut them with the remnant of
[16:05] their Valley how long will thou cut
[16:08] thyself oh the sword of the Lord how
[16:11] long will thou ever thou be
[16:13] quiet put up thyself into thy Scabbard
[16:17] rest and be still how can be quiet
[16:19] seeing the Lord ha given it a charge
[16:21] against a ascalon and against the
[16:24] seashore that he hath appointed it so as
[16:27] I read that I know this morning that
[16:30] once God makes a prophecy like that it's
[16:32] going to come to pass and the and I was
[16:34] just thinking the world is going to
[16:37] support things that they're not going to
[16:39] that have any purpose but I'm going to
[16:42] jump over to Daniel and I was just
[16:46] thinking sometimes when you look at the
[16:49] state of the world and the current
[16:50] position that it is this morning and
[16:53] like I said coming at that Wiki gated
[16:55] the whole world is just going to be
[16:58] deceived one day that and I I was just
[17:01] thinking of the politics that the world
[17:03] is ready to receive somebody to give
[17:05] them peace to make everything okay the
[17:08] world that's the world's getting to a
[17:10] point this morning where they're looking
[17:11] for someone to make everything right for
[17:13] them and we know the scripture says that
[17:16] you can't change it it's going to go to
[17:19] destruction one day and it's just headed
[17:21] that way and we have a we have an
[17:24] ability right now through the word of
[17:26] God we know the end State we know the
[17:29] beginning and the end and I was going to
[17:30] read but I I was thinking of a guy one
[17:33] time his name was
[17:35] Nebuchadnezzar and you know God used
[17:38] Nebuchadnezzar to bring judgment to all
[17:40] the world around him and I'll just read
[17:43] but uh he had a dream one time and this
[17:46] is what Daniel told him the
[17:48] interpretation of the dream was but
[17:51] we're the world is just like
[17:53] Nebuchadnezzar I'll just read what it I
[17:56] hope I don't read too much the it's it
[17:59] has to do with the tree not reading all
[18:02] of it and I'll read where Daniel gives
[18:05] the interpretation starting at the 26
[18:08] 22nd verse of the fourth chapter here it
[18:11] is thou oh King Thou Art grown and
[18:13] become strong for thy greatness is grown
[18:16] and reacheth onto heaven and thy
[18:18] Dominion to the end of the Earth and
[18:21] where is the King s i Watcher a holy one
[18:24] coming down from heaven saying you the
[18:26] tree down and destroy it yet have the
[18:29] stump of the roots thereof in the earth
[18:32] even the band of iron and the brass in
[18:34] the tender grass of the field let it be
[18:36] wet with the Dew of heaven and let its
[18:38] portion be with the Beast of the field
[18:41] till seven times pass over him and this
[18:44] is the interpretation oh King this is
[18:47] the decree of the most high where has
[18:49] come upon the Lord my Lord the king that
[18:53] thou shalt Drive thee from men excuse me
[18:56] that they shall Drive thee from men and
[18:58] th dwelling shall be with the beasts of
[19:00] the field and thou shal make thy make
[19:04] thee to eat the grass as oxen and they
[19:06] shall wet thee with the de of the heaven
[19:08] and seven times shall they pass over
[19:10] thee until thou knowest that the most
[19:12] high ruleth in the Kingdom of men and
[19:14] give it to whomsoever he will so
[19:17] Daniel's giving him this
[19:19] prosy and then he goes on and finishes
[19:22] here he says where has thou commanded to
[19:25] Le the stump and the tree roots thy
[19:27] kingdom shall be sure unto thee after
[19:30] that thou shalt have known the heaven do
[19:33] rule wherefore oh King let my counsel be
[19:36] acceptable so Daniel's talking to the
[19:38] King after the interpretation oh King
[19:41] let my counsel be acceptable unto thee
[19:43] and break off thy sins by righteousness
[19:46] and thy iniquities by showing Mercy to
[19:48] the poor if it may be the lengthen of
[19:51] thy Tranquility so after the prophecy
[19:55] Daniel's trying to get the king to do
[19:57] right trying to open his heart to the
[19:59] true word of God and then we go on and
[20:02] and this came upon the King
[20:04] Nebuchadnezzar and then 12 months
[20:07] later uh and at the end of 12 months he
[20:10] walked into the Palace of the kingdom of
[20:11] Babylon and the King spake and said is
[20:15] not this great Babylon that I have built
[20:18] for the house of Kingdom by the might of
[20:20] my power for the honor of my Majesty so
[20:24] he's after 12 months he forgets
[20:27] everything that Daniel talked to him and
[20:28] he's lifting himself up and not God who
[20:31] did it through him and my Majesty while
[20:35] the word was in the king's mouth there
[20:37] fell a voice from Heaven saying oh King
[20:39] Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the
[20:42] kingdom is departed from thee and and
[20:46] they shall Drive thee from men and thy
[20:48] dwelling shall be with the beasts of the
[20:49] field that they shall make thee to eat
[20:51] the grasses the otion seven times shall
[20:54] they pass over thee till thou knoweth
[20:56] the most high ruleth in the Kingdom of
[20:58] men and giveth to what someone will he
[21:02] will when I read that I think I can
[21:04] apply it to myself you know sometimes
[21:08] everything is going good for you
[21:09] everything everything it just seems like
[21:12] everything's being perfect and sometimes
[21:14] you you can think of yourself more than
[21:17] you really need to be in those
[21:19] situations and you'll do something
[21:21] stupid you'll say something stupid and
[21:24] all of a sudden all the good things just
[21:26] disappear within an hour within a few
[21:28] seconds s and your whole world will fall
[21:30] apart around you and what Daniel is
[21:33] telling Nebuchadnezzar and the truth
[21:35] that's being revealed here when you
[21:37] think of yourself more than what you
[21:39] really are that's when you're going to
[21:41] have problems in this life you always
[21:43] have to think of yourself like God like
[21:46] there's nothing good about you and the
[21:48] only thing that you get good is God's
[21:51] mercy for you and that's what
[21:53] Nebuchadnezzar had to learn I'm not
[21:55] going to read it all but after seven
[21:57] years God spoke in Nebuchadnezzar again
[22:00] and he testified that God is God and his
[22:03] kingdom was returned to him and what I'm
[22:06] thinking we have example after example
[22:09] in our lives of when God raises people
[22:11] up or when God brings people down and I
[22:14] was just thinking even this morning we
[22:17] have examples of that I have examples in
[22:19] my own life where I've made mistakes and
[22:22] everything I thought was was going to be
[22:24] okay has been totally thrown away and
[22:26] then I have to start all over again it's
[22:29] no different for any of us but I was
[22:31] just thinking about old Nebuchadnezzar
[22:33] in this world that we live in I mean
[22:36] they've there is no more stops anymore
[22:38] there's no more
[22:40] um there's there's no guard poost for
[22:43] them anymore there's no gate stopping
[22:45] them anymore there's nothing stopping
[22:47] them the word of God isn't stopping them
[22:49] anymore they're headed to Oblivion and
[22:52] we don't want to be following them to
[22:54] Oblivion this morning we want to get
[22:56] back to the word of God and follow the
[22:58] word of God as it instruct Us in the
[23:01] message of the hour this morning and as
[23:04] I see you know I can say this as I get
[23:06] older I realize that all the things I
[23:09] say this a lot I'll keep saying it all
[23:12] the things that I thought was important
[23:13] when I was 30 or 20 or even 40 I
[23:16] realized that almost 65 that those
[23:19] things aren't as important as I thought
[23:21] they were the only real important thing
[23:24] for me this morning is to have a
[23:27] relationship with Jesus Christ and
[23:29] everything that I do should focus on
[23:31] that this morning to be successful in
[23:33] that and like I was saying you know in
[23:35] Pilgrims Progress if you you have to
[23:39] this is going to slide off this Pulpit
[23:40] here if you didn't have that certificate
[23:43] you weren't going to be there on that
[23:45] day and why go for you you there was a
[23:50] couple of examples of people that didn't
[23:51] have they went through all those
[23:53] struggles they went through all those
[23:56] situations but because they didn't come
[23:58] through through the wicked gate and they
[23:59] didn't come the right way it didn't mean
[24:01] anything on the end and it's the same
[24:03] for us if there's any little sin in you
[24:06] holding you back or something that you
[24:08] know you need to make right it's not
[24:10] going to go well for me or anyone on
[24:13] that day if you don't if you haven't
[24:15] come the right way and this morning I
[24:18] that's what I've heard from a lot of the
[24:19] ministers that come over the last
[24:22] several weeks it's real important that
[24:26] everything that we do is on the right
[24:29] foundation this morning and that
[24:30] Foundation is Christ through the word of
[24:33] God and the message for the hour that we
[24:35] all believe this morning anything
[24:37] outside of that it doesn't really mean
[24:40] anything this morning brother
[24:48] Josh amen good to be in the house of the
[24:50] Lord this morning why don't we just
[24:52] stand to our
[24:53] feet are you happy to be a Christian

[1:02:16] speak to you this morning upon a seat at
[1:02:19] the table a seat at the
[1:02:23] table and our scene opens the this
[1:02:26] morning with um David King David this is
[1:02:30] many years after the death of Saul and
[1:02:32] both Jonathan and he is inquiring of the
[1:02:36] the relationship or the kin or the
[1:02:39] family or whoever it might be Amen in
[1:02:41] the family of Saul David said is there
[1:02:45] yet any that is left in the house of
[1:02:47] Saul that I may show him kindness for
[1:02:50] Jonathan's sake there was at the house
[1:02:53] of Saul a servant whose name was Zeba
[1:02:57] when they had called him unto David the
[1:03:00] king said unto him art thou Zeba and he
[1:03:03] said thy servant is he the king said is
[1:03:07] there not yet any of the House of Saul
[1:03:11] that I may show kindness the kindness of
[1:03:13] God unto him and zebus said unto the
[1:03:15] king Jonathan hath yet a son which is
[1:03:18] lame on his feet verse six and M when
[1:03:22] MTH the son of Jonathan the son of Saul
[1:03:26] was come unto David he fell on his face
[1:03:28] and did reverence and David
[1:03:31] said
[1:03:33] MF and he answered Behold thy
[1:03:37] servant and David said unto him fear
[1:03:44] not I will surely show thee kindness for
[1:03:47] Jonathan thy father's
[1:03:50] sake and will restore thee all the land
[1:03:53] of Saul thy father
[1:03:56] and thou shalt eat bread at my
[1:03:59] table
[1:04:01] continually let's pray over the
[1:04:05] word Lord Jesus we're so thankful for
[1:04:07] the opp to come into your
[1:04:10] house Lord as we look into
[1:04:13] the word of God this morning to look
[1:04:16] into the pages of the Bible and the
[1:04:18] message Father it would take more than
[1:04:20] just the human instruments the senses
[1:04:23] that we've been
[1:04:24] given to be able to understand and
[1:04:27] comprehend how it all fits together
[1:04:29] therefore Lord as we take this moment to
[1:04:33] Bow our heads and to talk to you we do
[1:04:36] so
[1:04:37] Lord with the idea that if you don't
[1:04:41] come and open our hearts and our minds
[1:04:43] and our eyes and our understanding what
[1:04:46] we've just read means absolutely nothing
[1:04:48] to us but Lord Jesus if you will come
[1:04:51] this morning and take your word and that
[1:04:54] you will anoint it anoint me as the
[1:04:57] speaker anoint them as the receiver and
[1:05:00] let us all be receptive me included Lord
[1:05:03] that we might hear from you and that you
[1:05:05] would anoint us and open our hearts and
[1:05:07] Minds father we know that beyond a
[1:05:09] shadow of a doubt what we've read will
[1:05:12] not only affect us but change our lives
[1:05:16] so we're asking that you will come upon
[1:05:18] all that's been accomplished thus far
[1:05:20] and bless it and then Lord in the
[1:05:22] further part of this service may your
[1:05:24] anointing fall upon this word and anoint
[1:05:27] it as well help me Lord just to get out
[1:05:29] of the way completely that you might use
[1:05:31] me to speak to your children those
[1:05:33] things which they need to hear and Lord
[1:05:35] may you close my mouth to anything that
[1:05:37] is not becoming Lord or may not be
[1:05:39] appropriate for this season of their
[1:05:41] lives help me Lord to hit the targets
[1:05:43] that you want to hit this morning and
[1:05:45] Lord may we just keep pressing and
[1:05:47] pushing Lord until you've accomplish
[1:05:50] what you want to accomplish this morning
[1:05:51] as we commit these things to you in the
[1:05:54] name of Jesus Christ chist we pray amen
[1:05:57] and amen and all the saints said amen
[1:06:01] you may be seated God bless you thank
[1:06:03] you brother I do believe that's the
[1:06:05] first good amen I've heard out of y'all
[1:06:06] so
[1:06:07] far amen got mad at me over the lazy
[1:06:10] Christian remark sorry I pick
[1:06:15] sometimes amen you one thing you'll
[1:06:18] learn about me if I don't pick on you it
[1:06:20] means I don't like
[1:06:21] you so if I tease you a little bit then
[1:06:24] you know that you got my heart
[1:06:26] amen we thank the Lord for the reading
[1:06:28] now just looking at a couple of these
[1:06:31] things in the Bible about this
[1:06:34] particular story now now mind you
[1:06:36] there's a lot more to this that you can
[1:06:37] read that'll be a great blessing to you
[1:06:39] if you focus on it when you get to focus
[1:06:42] on
[1:06:44] it what you'll find is that the the
[1:06:48] history behind this boy the history
[1:06:51] behind his whole family and the family
[1:06:53] line coming from Saul Jonathan all the
[1:06:56] way up until you see mblf enter the
[1:06:59] scene and all of the particulars if you
[1:07:03] will that uh surrounded this um this
[1:07:08] setting that David is asking about the
[1:07:11] feeling of the people whether there's
[1:07:13] anybody left in the house of Saul now
[1:07:15] this is a very crucial thing for David
[1:07:18] because we know that David in his
[1:07:21] Bedrock beginnings and his first
[1:07:24] interactions with Saul
[1:07:26] when he comes up to the place to where
[1:07:28] now he is interacting with Saul uh over
[1:07:32] the challenge that Goliath makes you
[1:07:34] know he he no doubt as he came in to
[1:07:38] play his harp and he came in to have
[1:07:40] these great discussions with Saul at
[1:07:42] different times you know there was a big
[1:07:44] part of David that no doubt looked up to
[1:07:47] Saul as being what we would call today a
[1:07:49] mentor and we would think that perhaps
[1:07:52] maybe in his mind the way he would think
[1:07:55] that Saul would be somebody that he was
[1:07:57] very connected to not just by the way of
[1:07:59] Flesh and speaking back and forth but
[1:08:02] something very deep must have resonated
[1:08:04] in David's heart for who Saul was
[1:08:07] because we look at Saul from the
[1:08:09] perspective of almost like a uh like a
[1:08:12] business office in a sense he was a king
[1:08:14] and David was working side by side and
[1:08:17] they had conflict but this for David was
[1:08:20] much more than just an arrangement of
[1:08:23] such this was more to David than just
[1:08:25] well uh you know I I'm going to do a
[1:08:27] service for the king and you know maybe
[1:08:29] get paid or uh get accolades in the
[1:08:32] Kingdom but but for David this was a
[1:08:34] responsibility that he not only
[1:08:36] committed himself to physically using
[1:08:39] his talents and his gifts to help Saul
[1:08:41] but in his heart he knit himself
[1:08:44] together to be a complete and total
[1:08:47] dedicated servant to King Saul even
[1:08:51] though you imagine this is the complete
[1:08:53] absolute complete permissive will of of
[1:08:55] God alt together God never wanted Israel
[1:08:57] to have a king God never wanted them to
[1:09:00] be ruled or controlled by a king and yet
[1:09:03] here we are and David even in this
[1:09:05] permissive will condition decides this
[1:09:08] is the way God has allowed it and I'm
[1:09:10] going to follow through and be loyal as
[1:09:12] an Israelite you know and I think it's
[1:09:14] amazing how that you see the heart of
[1:09:16] David and the kind of attitude he had
[1:09:18] toward these kind of situations and then
[1:09:20] you meet people in the message and
[1:09:21] around that will be they'll be in a
[1:09:23] permissive will type situ situation and
[1:09:26] rather stay committed to the Lord if
[1:09:28] they can't have a perfect situation well
[1:09:30] they just throw everything baby and bath
[1:09:32] water out and say well I can't even
[1:09:34] serve God we could take a lot of notes
[1:09:36] from the way that David behaved himself
[1:09:39] in situations that were not perfect per
[1:09:41] se and I think that it was good for
[1:09:44] David to have this laying in his heart
[1:09:47] for a couple reasons the first reason I
[1:09:48] believe it was good for David was
[1:09:50] because David was in need of someone to
[1:09:54] kind of ruffle his feathers a little bit
[1:09:56] you know he'd been on the back side of
[1:09:58] the desert and he'd had so many
[1:10:00] victories and so many great things had
[1:10:02] been accomplished for him that he never
[1:10:04] really got to see the negative side of
[1:10:06] anything he never got to see what a
[1:10:08] leader who does the wrong thing uh look
[1:10:11] like he never was affected by someone
[1:10:14] that would lie to him or betray him or
[1:10:16] double cross him now in our mind way of
[1:10:19] looking at things we would say oh that's
[1:10:21] that's awful we we need to avoid such
[1:10:23] situations you know you read books today
[1:10:25] and you hear TED talks and you hear
[1:10:27] these people on YouTube different ones
[1:10:29] that'll say do your best to avoid a
[1:10:32] toxic situation anybody ever heard that
[1:10:35] terminology avoid toxicity but yet you
[1:10:38] realize as a Christian one of the first
[1:10:40] things that God does when you are good
[1:10:42] and ready is he does he don't just just
[1:10:45] nudge you he kicks you right in the
[1:10:47] middle of a toxic situation and that is
[1:10:49] like an eagle he takes you and kicks you
[1:10:51] out of the nest and says Fly Boy and see
[1:10:53] what you can do about it' and I think
[1:10:56] sometimes we think in our mind I believe
[1:10:58] we think that it's a bad thing to enter
[1:11:01] into such situations but actually the
[1:11:03] real people of God shine they shine
[1:11:07] forth their real character of who they
[1:11:09] are when everything is as wrong and as
[1:11:12] bad and as ugly as it can possibly be as
[1:11:15] a matter of fact the uglier it is the
[1:11:16] prettier the bride
[1:11:18] becomes I like that can you say Amen
[1:11:21] right because in those situations these
[1:11:23] are the things that form the character
[1:11:26] and mold those good things in us that
[1:11:29] make us what we are you don't really
[1:11:31] know what's inside of you you don't
[1:11:34] really have a clue of what you can
[1:11:37] accomplish in the Lord until you have
[1:11:41] buted up and went head to-head and
[1:11:43] competed against these kind of
[1:11:45] situations like that you know you wonder
[1:11:47] do I have love well just meet somebody
[1:11:49] that has perfect hatred you'll find out
[1:11:51] if you've got perfect love find out if
[1:11:53] you've got joy meet somebody that's
[1:11:55] negative all the time and all that
[1:11:57] effect and how they are around you and
[1:11:59] then just watch that something of God
[1:12:01] Bloom out of your life amen I believe
[1:12:04] that these things are not only necessary
[1:12:06] but I believe these things are going to
[1:12:09] be present in our life every day that we
[1:12:12] live and folks listen to me people in
[1:12:14] this world today in this 21st century
[1:12:16] we're living in with these young people
[1:12:17] sitting around here they are inundated
[1:12:20] every single day with the idea find
[1:12:23] peace find solitude find comfort and
[1:12:26] ease and yet you'll realize that that is
[1:12:29] not what brings true happiness in a
[1:12:31] person's life I I I had one of my
[1:12:34] students was telling me the day one of
[1:12:35] my polar students I teach English to and
[1:12:38] and he's he's fairly fluent and so he
[1:12:39] could describe this to me pretty good
[1:12:42] and he said he was reading a study about
[1:12:44] 10 men that they had taken and these men
[1:12:46] were multi- multi-millionaires raised to
[1:12:49] millionaire homes they had always been
[1:12:51] chauffered every meal had been cooked
[1:12:53] for them and uh you know they never met
[1:12:55] La their own bed they' never done any
[1:12:56] work somebody always cleaned for them
[1:12:58] and whatever whatever whatever they had
[1:13:00] a problem in school then somebody always
[1:13:02] done you know the tutoring and helped
[1:13:04] them along they never really offended
[1:13:06] for themselves and these 10 men and I
[1:13:09] don't know why it wasn't women it just
[1:13:10] men specifically I guess in the study
[1:13:12] but these 10 men were absolutely as
[1:13:15] unhappy as it could possibly be so they
[1:13:18] decided let's do something different
[1:13:21] Let's do an opposite of their life and
[1:13:23] see what results it brings so they made
[1:13:25] them fast several days they made them
[1:13:28] wear old clothes they made them Drive
[1:13:30] thems cook for themsel clean for themsel
[1:13:33] and after about a month of this they
[1:13:34] went back to evaluate the emotional
[1:13:37] state of these 10 men and lo and behold
[1:13:40] you would think oh they were more
[1:13:41] miserable than they'd ever been wrong a
[1:13:44] thanks for playing but actually they
[1:13:46] were more happy than they had ever been
[1:13:49] in their entire lives why because
[1:13:52] adversity negative brings something out
[1:13:55] of us that we would never see had not it
[1:13:58] showed up at our doorstep thank God for
[1:14:01] every time the Lord Jesus allowed us to
[1:14:04] go through hard times you understand
[1:14:07] that you'll understand why James made
[1:14:08] that perplexing statement my brethren
[1:14:11] counted Joy when you fall into divers
[1:14:15] Temptations I've always wondered about
[1:14:17] James making such a remark I thought
[1:14:19] that poor guy somehow or another he must
[1:14:21] have slipped his pen and put the wrong
[1:14:23] thing in there but it's the word of God
[1:14:25] it's got to be just that way why he had
[1:14:28] a revelation negativity brings out the
[1:14:31] positivity the dark expresses the night
[1:14:34] the bad expresses the good come on you
[1:14:36] with me all of these negative things
[1:14:38] bring out what's really inside of
[1:14:41] Us Praise the Lord you never know if
[1:14:44] you're good in math until you get a
[1:14:47] test you don't know how great you are in
[1:14:49] English until somebody sets a big exam
[1:14:51] in front of you all you can boast and
[1:14:54] walk around like message people do the
[1:14:56] prophet said the prophet said the
[1:14:57] prophet said but we wait till the test
[1:14:59] comes you'll find out when the test
[1:15:01] comes whether or not you got the goods
[1:15:04] of what you're talking about or not yes
[1:15:06] sir that's right now for David this
[1:15:09] negativity actually didn't make him
[1:15:11] worse of a Christian we would say it
[1:15:14] actually made him better you would think
[1:15:16] that in David's heart after having
[1:15:17] javelins thrown at him being called a
[1:15:20] dog being told that he was the worst
[1:15:22] person on the face of the planet being
[1:15:23] called all kinds of names
[1:15:26] being double crossed betrayed back bit
[1:15:28] lied to you'd think it would turn David
[1:15:32] into a person of such negativity and
[1:15:35] toxicity that he would spew his hatred
[1:15:37] to anybody got within a foot of
[1:15:40] him but actually it brought out a
[1:15:43] Sweetness in
[1:15:45] David it brought
[1:15:47] forgiveness and mercy in so much as to
[1:15:51] when those men had convinced him to go
[1:15:54] to the cave and cut a piece of Saul's
[1:15:57] garment the moment he done it he had
[1:16:00] such an affection for
[1:16:02] Saul that it smoted his
[1:16:05] heart that he dare touch the Lord's
[1:16:10] anointed you know in the day we live in
[1:16:13] smot His Garment I'd like to rip his
[1:16:15] face off his
[1:16:18] skull well Hallelujah the angels have
[1:16:20] showed up this morning okay all right
[1:16:22] Angels good flap your wings
[1:16:26] now y'all know better than that be
[1:16:28] honest in church God knows you're lying
[1:16:30] don't lie in
[1:16:31] church there are people you get so
[1:16:34] aggravated at you'd like to rip the
[1:16:36] goozle out of
[1:16:37] them three head nods four eye blinks
[1:16:40] you're doing better I'll get
[1:16:43] closer oh yes I'm a Believer but you're
[1:16:45] a human
[1:16:47] first and that human part of us that
[1:16:50] emotional side of us that person gets
[1:16:52] damaged and wounded and many times takes
[1:16:55] the hit before it actually drains down
[1:16:58] into the
[1:16:59] soul and it makes it so challenging for
[1:17:02] us you look at how brother Bram dealt
[1:17:03] with the complex of being rejected his
[1:17:05] entire
[1:17:07] life cuz he was raised in a bad with the
[1:17:10] Brams having a bad
[1:17:12] name always was poor alcoholic and
[1:17:15] everything else in the family and yet
[1:17:17] here is brother brandham with everything
[1:17:19] that God is going to do with this
[1:17:21] man
[1:17:23] struggling after after years of
[1:17:27] successes to take one moment and say you
[1:17:30] know what the Lord has done good around
[1:17:33] here we've accomplished some great
[1:17:35] things the Lord and
[1:17:37] I but he finds himself in a parking lot
[1:17:40] reading the license plates just to
[1:17:43] encourage himself that people didn't
[1:17:45] hate
[1:17:49] him that human side of us gets so deeply
[1:17:53] scarred so
[1:17:56] affected until bitterness and grudges
[1:17:58] and those kind of things can settle into
[1:18:00] us and we stay there
[1:18:03] forever or you say we don't I know
[1:18:05] people in message churches families that
[1:18:07] are split completely in half that ain't
[1:18:09] spoke to each other in 40 years and yet
[1:18:12] will sit on the Pew and worship and
[1:18:13] Shout speak and tongues run and dance
[1:18:15] and everything else in the world and yet
[1:18:16] have that thing hiding inside of their
[1:18:18] heart does God bless them sure in some
[1:18:21] ways he does but they can never fully
[1:18:23] move up into that full stature of a
[1:18:26] perfect human being until they achieve
[1:18:28] that part of Brotherly kindness and the
[1:18:30] true love of God where they are able to
[1:18:33] put themselves in somebody else's
[1:18:37] choose and learn to
[1:18:42] forgive as the old axim is to forgive is
[1:18:46] divine it takes God to put that inside
[1:18:50] of your heart and here is a man friends
[1:18:53] to our shame here is a man without the
[1:18:56] Holy
[1:18:58] Ghost and yet was able to obtain the
[1:19:01] power of forgiveness within himself by
[1:19:04] the grace of God he was able to forgive
[1:19:06] a man that was so
[1:19:10] vile today we would have called Saul
[1:19:15] bipolar because one day he loved David
[1:19:17] the next day he hated
[1:19:19] him one day David was the greatest thing
[1:19:22] he ever laid his eyes on and the next
[1:19:23] day he absolutely despised the ground He
[1:19:25] Walked on how many of you would like to
[1:19:28] live in such an environment all the
[1:19:30] time some of you
[1:19:33] have some of you have lived with the
[1:19:34] narcissist or you've lived with those
[1:19:36] bipolar type personalities or with those
[1:19:38] double-minded people like that it's
[1:19:42] misery and it leaves such an impression
[1:19:44] on you that it's almost impossible to
[1:19:46] erase that from your
[1:19:50] memory here's David sitting with his
[1:19:52] Little Harp singing
[1:19:55] the Lord is my sheer I shall not
[1:19:57] want he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:20:00] pure he rests and restores My Soul by
[1:20:03] Still Waters the man understood that as
[1:20:05] a human being he had no ability to do
[1:20:09] this within himself it took God to get
[1:20:10] him
[1:20:13] there and he also knew that Saul didn't
[1:20:15] anoint
[1:20:17] himself Saul was chosen by God even
[1:20:21] though God never wanted Saul to be in
[1:20:23] the place at
[1:20:26] first remember we told Samuel they
[1:20:28] didn't reject you they rejected me and
[1:20:32] yet God in his mercy and his grace
[1:20:36] appointed somebody to the desires of
[1:20:38] their heart mind you it was to the
[1:20:39] leanness of their soul yes but God still
[1:20:42] provided for them a king it goes to
[1:20:45] prove sometimes friends we think that
[1:20:47] God ain't going to do nothing for us
[1:20:48] because we're in a mess or we got
[1:20:50] problems or we haven't repented right or
[1:20:51] we got stuff to fix God will still bless
[1:20:53] you right on top of of that as long as
[1:20:55] your heart is willing to do the right
[1:20:58] thing it's only when you're stubborn and
[1:21:00] hard-headed and arrogant and egotistical
[1:21:02] and won't repent that's when you get in
[1:21:04] trouble with
[1:21:05] Jesus that's when he cuts all the
[1:21:08] blessings off is when you refuse to be
[1:21:10] hot
[1:21:12] soft-hearted with all the stuff that
[1:21:14] David did God said he's still a man
[1:21:16] after my own
[1:21:20] heart and now here we are many years
[1:21:23] later and after the death of Jonathan
[1:21:25] and the death of Saul Now the nursaid
[1:21:28] runs in haste Brother Brad runs as hard
[1:21:30] as she can to
[1:21:33] flee and like any human being might
[1:21:37] do she slips or Falls or tumbles or
[1:21:40] whatever she does and accidentally drops
[1:21:42] this boy
[1:21:43] MTH and causes a crippling
[1:21:47] injury that keeps him from being what we
[1:21:50] would call normal for the rest of his
[1:21:53] life
[1:21:57] now the thing you have to understand
[1:21:59] about this
[1:22:01] boy when he comes before David to me
[1:22:04] this is so
[1:22:06] remarkable David calls this boy into his
[1:22:11] presence you have to understand where
[1:22:14] this kid had come
[1:22:15] from his very name a fi actually means a
[1:22:19] breathing
[1:22:22] shame being the son of Jonathan and also
[1:22:24] the grandson of
[1:22:27] Saul here he is the descendant of the
[1:22:30] very King that God
[1:22:35] anointed his
[1:22:38] name
[1:22:42] signifies that he's not only a shame but
[1:22:44] a breathing
[1:22:48] shame he falls into a life of poverty
[1:22:52] and winds up into a city called Lo
[1:22:56] dear which the very name loar means
[1:22:59] lack lack of Life of
[1:23:03] poverty I wonder how many people spent
[1:23:06] time sitting around the dinner table
[1:23:08] when M ff's name would come up and said
[1:23:10] boy you know that was something about
[1:23:12] that kid how awful that was that poor
[1:23:14] boy I can't
[1:23:16] believe that woman what was a matter
[1:23:18] with him she should I as a baby she
[1:23:21] should have held on to that baby
[1:23:24] now that poor kid look at him did you
[1:23:26] see him in the street the other day
[1:23:30] begging no doubt like other children are
[1:23:33] my my wife's brother Chris some of you
[1:23:35] met him had a fetal stroke because of
[1:23:37] forceps around his head squeezed a nerve
[1:23:40] and caused a a a fetal stroke and his
[1:23:43] his right arm is crippled like this and
[1:23:45] he walks with a bit of a limp you
[1:23:47] actually can see a lot of those injuries
[1:23:49] from that time when they'd used forceps
[1:23:50] in the way they did I see a lot of
[1:23:52] people on the road that's got that same
[1:23:53] kind of injury as Chris and people
[1:23:55] always made fun of
[1:23:57] him he had to have brain surgery when he
[1:23:59] was 10 and have a shunt put in his brain
[1:24:01] because if not he would have been what
[1:24:02] they used to call years ago a Waterhead
[1:24:06] kid here is injured and my my wife you
[1:24:08] know the first time she ever learned to
[1:24:10] fight she said was when somebody made
[1:24:11] fun of Chris let me tell you something
[1:24:14] that little Spitfire woman of mine
[1:24:17] she'll bite your kneecap you better
[1:24:18] watch
[1:24:21] out old Pennsylvania Tennessee girl she
[1:24:24] rough as a corn cop oh she's sweet
[1:24:27] whenever she petting a kitty this way
[1:24:28] but don't believe her Hey listen she
[1:24:30] tough God knew how to make her she had
[1:24:32] to live with
[1:24:35] me then they'd make fun and put him down
[1:24:38] you like boy did you see him the other
[1:24:39] day in
[1:24:42] rags what good is his life anyway some
[1:24:45] people might have went and said why
[1:24:46] don't he just kill
[1:24:48] himself that's what young people he on
[1:24:50] social media these days you know
[1:24:54] the world as we know it looks at any
[1:24:58] imperfection as though there's something
[1:24:59] wrong with
[1:25:01] us but God orchestrated this
[1:25:05] fall cuz remember it was the fall that
[1:25:10] put him in that shape in the
[1:25:13] beginning the fall is what caused his
[1:25:15] breathing shame the fall is what caused
[1:25:18] him to live in low debar we've all been
[1:25:21] to that City haven't we low debar
[1:25:27] a place of lack a place of poverty I
[1:25:31] think I'm the mayor of the place
[1:25:35] sometimes how they must have looked at
[1:25:38] him in
[1:25:40] shame but
[1:25:43] David
[1:25:44] David because of his heart for Saul and
[1:25:48] his soul the Bible said was knit to his
[1:25:51] best friend Jonathan
[1:25:56] when David calls maef into his
[1:26:00] presence David looks upon this boy not
[1:26:04] as a breathing
[1:26:05] shame not as a beab bond or not as a a
[1:26:09] criminal of sorts or not as just a
[1:26:11] beggar when David looks upon this boy
[1:26:14] his heart is
[1:26:16] reminded this is a
[1:26:19] son and Grandson of a
[1:26:22] king and in his blood
[1:26:26] is
[1:26:31] royalty you see friends the world looks
[1:26:34] upon you as though you're not exactly
[1:26:37] what you need to be like take our girls
[1:26:40] for example they're under so much
[1:26:41] pressure in this day and age for for
[1:26:43] everything from makeup and fashion and
[1:26:45] how to dress and how to live who says
[1:26:47] they're the boss of how you ought to
[1:26:50] do God didn't create just you created
[1:26:55] all kinds of
[1:26:58] people so one person doesn't have the
[1:27:01] Monopoly on what says
[1:27:03] what Facebook sure isn't my authority
[1:27:06] neither is Instagram Tik Tok or any of
[1:27:07] these other social media hell
[1:27:10] pits oh they can do some good but you
[1:27:12] know as well as I do they're nothing but
[1:27:13] a hell pit
[1:27:15] sometimes but that's what our kids face
[1:27:17] in this day and age quit preaching your
[1:27:19] TV stuff that's so Antiquated and
[1:27:21] outdated they don't even understand what
[1:27:23] a TV's about like we used to you old
[1:27:25] people me
[1:27:27] too they don't live in that world they
[1:27:29] live in a completely different world
[1:27:30] than we do than we
[1:27:34] did what they're up
[1:27:36] against science says within 11
[1:27:40] seconds whatever image they see is
[1:27:43] ingrained into a subconscious part of
[1:27:46] their mind and it stays there
[1:27:51] forever how many hours of people scr
[1:27:54] rrolling through their social media
[1:27:55] Pages how much do you think actually
[1:27:58] enters into your subconscious mind and
[1:28:00] you don't even know it's
[1:28:02] there because it doesn't come through
[1:28:04] the first conscience as quickly as it
[1:28:06] comes through that subconscious
[1:28:09] part and every image you see will tell
[1:28:12] these girls to be beautiful you got to
[1:28:13] do this to be sexy you got to do this to
[1:28:16] be hot you got to do
[1:28:18] this hang on young people the old people
[1:28:20] are about to pass out on me but I've got
[1:28:23] to use terminology that they understand
[1:28:25] whether you do or
[1:28:28] not to be hap happening in Hip I'm using
[1:28:32] old people terms
[1:28:35] now you got to dress a certain way act a
[1:28:38] certain way behave a certain way and if
[1:28:40] there's any imperfection in you at
[1:28:44] all you might as well forget about being
[1:28:47] anybody at all but I got news for you
[1:28:50] and for the devil God takes
[1:28:52] imperfections and uses them glory to God
[1:28:56] for his glory to do great things for the
[1:28:59] kingdom of God we don't have to look at
[1:29:03] imperfections as a handicap especially
[1:29:06] since there's royal blood flowing
[1:29:09] through
[1:29:10] you oh glory to
[1:29:17] God the thing I wondered
[1:29:21] about was I wonder what David thought
[1:29:25] because if you read more of this chapter
[1:29:27] here the very next verse we stopped with
[1:29:29] verse
[1:29:30] eight when he comes before David he bows
[1:29:34] himself down like this somehow I don't
[1:29:36] know how he done
[1:29:37] it and he calls himself a dog and I
[1:29:41] wondered to myself when he heard those
[1:29:42] words I
[1:29:44] wondered Wonder something flashed
[1:29:46] through David's
[1:29:47] mind of all the times that he knew Saul
[1:29:51] was out to kill
[1:29:52] him but yet David would come before Saul
[1:29:56] and say my
[1:29:57] king I'm so privileged for you to come
[1:30:01] to me a
[1:30:02] flea a
[1:30:05] dog when he sees this boy call himself a
[1:30:08] dog I've always wondered did David stop
[1:30:10] and have a
[1:30:14] flashback no doubt maybe this is the
[1:30:16] point where the devil might have said to
[1:30:18] the boy to David now's your chance kid
[1:30:24] you know all that time you wanting to
[1:30:26] get
[1:30:27] even you want to get even with them over
[1:30:29] that social media post or what they said
[1:30:30] to your friends or that picture they
[1:30:32] spread around now you got
[1:30:35] them all you got to do is hit sin
[1:30:39] click
[1:30:43] post but you see when David looked upon
[1:30:45] this boy he didn't look upon him as an
[1:30:48] object or a target of his revenge
[1:30:55] nor did he pity
[1:30:57] Mev you see because I think sometimes we
[1:31:00] get in our mind that when God calls us
[1:31:03] for salvation it's as God is looking on
[1:31:06] us like we're a crippled up pathetic
[1:31:09] mess a breathing
[1:31:12] shame God's just having Mercy on us
[1:31:15] because we're such
[1:31:17] scum we're so low down and so good for
[1:31:20] nothing come on somebody preach to
[1:31:22] me that God God just looks down on us
[1:31:25] and says I've just got to have pity on
[1:31:27] them they're so pathetic they're so
[1:31:29] worthless but that is not the reason
[1:31:32] that God saved us brother BR said God
[1:31:33] don't run his business like that he said
[1:31:36] he didn't bring his son down here and
[1:31:38] say you know now somebody feels sorry
[1:31:40] for my boy said if God run his office
[1:31:42] like that he said what kind of a mess
[1:31:44] would it be
[1:31:46] anyways God knew who is going to save
[1:31:48] you for the foundation of the
[1:31:50] world and He sent Jesus to save those
[1:32:00] and so here comes
[1:32:02] David he looks down upon maef and he has
[1:32:05] a
[1:32:06] choice but you see because of the
[1:32:09] passion in his heart for the things of
[1:32:12] God and because he was dedicated to
[1:32:15] truth and
[1:32:18] fairness God's fairness not our
[1:32:21] version when he looked at this boy he
[1:32:23] said those
[1:32:26] words FF I want you to
[1:32:29] realize that for the rest of your
[1:32:32] life you have a
[1:32:35] seat at the king's
[1:32:38] table and do you know what I love about
[1:32:40] this type the seat was chosen before MF
[1:32:44] showed
[1:32:47] up the decision was already made before
[1:32:51] M said yes or no I got news for some of
[1:32:54] you you think you're in control of your
[1:32:55] life your destiny is not your own and we
[1:32:59] make all of these plans and these
[1:33:01] decisions I'm going to do this and I'm
[1:33:02] going to go to college and I'm G to get
[1:33:04] a certain education I'm going to marry a
[1:33:05] certain person and I'm going to drive a
[1:33:07] certain car and I'm gonna go to a
[1:33:08] certain place of business and I'm going
[1:33:10] to make so much money the Bible said if
[1:33:12] you're going to say it say if it be the
[1:33:14] Lord's
[1:33:16] will don't say I'm going to do this or
[1:33:18] that and make it absolute say if it's
[1:33:20] the Lord's will I'll do that cuz you
[1:33:23] don't know what tomorrow holds for you
[1:33:26] and you don't know what your destiny is
[1:33:28] come on somebody but God holds our
[1:33:31] destiny in the pal of his
[1:33:33] hand whatever he wants from me that's
[1:33:36] what I
[1:33:38] want when I get to think and I'm going
[1:33:40] to do a certain thing oh you better
[1:33:42] watch that arrogant
[1:33:44] spirit because you'll do what you do as
[1:33:46] God Wills you to do it and if you think
[1:33:49] you're bigger than him try him sometime
[1:33:51] and he'll show you how big his foot is
[1:33:52] when he kicks you through the wall
[1:33:55] smacks you upside the heads wake up
[1:34:02] dummy you say how do you know I've had
[1:34:06] it oh yeah the early days of being a
[1:34:10] Christian I hear that about spoken word
[1:34:12] spoken word speak the word so I was just
[1:34:14] going to do it all speak what I wanted
[1:34:16] do what I wanted do what I wanted you
[1:34:19] want to make God laugh just tell him
[1:34:20] your plans
[1:34:24] W preach brother man think I
[1:34:26] will come
[1:34:28] on we cannot decide based on where we
[1:34:32] were raised we cannot make decisions
[1:34:34] based on our background or our history
[1:34:37] God can take all of that disable tangle
[1:34:40] that toxic
[1:34:42] mess and do something beautiful out of
[1:34:45] it if we'll only allow him to do what he
[1:34:48] said he was going to do all things work
[1:34:51] together for the G of them that are the
[1:34:53] call according to his
[1:34:56] purpose amen
[1:34:59] amen if we can trust him like
[1:35:02] that and we don't have to worry about
[1:35:05] nothing then you can sing what I sang I
[1:35:09] ain't worried because God's in
[1:35:12] control praise the
[1:35:15] Lord do you imagine what this kid might
[1:35:18] have
[1:35:19] thought hearing David say these words
[1:35:21] now Meb have saw himself as a loser
[1:35:26] because he identified
[1:35:30] himself not with his true
[1:35:33] identity but he identified himself hang
[1:35:36] on
[1:35:37] everybody with who he
[1:35:40] thought he
[1:35:46] was big difference between who you think
[1:35:49] you
[1:35:50] are and who God thinks you are
[1:35:56] that one got so deep to some of you it
[1:35:57] couldn't even shake your head
[1:36:01] amen you see yourself in so many
[1:36:03] different
[1:36:04] capacities humans have this ability to
[1:36:07] kind of see the strengths and the
[1:36:08] weaknesses and then there's this MC mesh
[1:36:11] of whatever in
[1:36:15] between there are so many mysteries of
[1:36:17] God that quite honestly when the Lord
[1:36:19] reveals them they're the easiest things
[1:36:20] to understand and learn as you've ever
[1:36:22] got but there is one mystery that for
[1:36:24] the last 33 years I've been trying to
[1:36:26] figure out and that is the mystery of
[1:36:30] people they're the most complex and
[1:36:33] difficult to
[1:36:35] unravel one scripture says this one
[1:36:38] scripture says that one poet writes this
[1:36:41] one poet writes that one psychologist
[1:36:43] says this one doctor says
[1:36:47] that the Bible says this the Bible says
[1:36:49] that you think you got people figured
[1:36:51] out until you meet someone that is an
[1:36:53] absolute
[1:36:55] Enigma
[1:36:58] weirdos strange
[1:37:01] people you think how in the world could
[1:37:04] they think such a thing is normal how
[1:37:05] could they do such a thing and yet there
[1:37:07] they
[1:37:09] are it's kind of like brother Carol used
[1:37:12] to say about women preachers they said
[1:37:13] you believe women preachers I got to
[1:37:14] they're on every street
[1:37:18] corner not that he did but they were
[1:37:21] around same thing with us we think oh
[1:37:24] I've got life figured out until all of a
[1:37:26] sudden this curveball comes out of
[1:37:28] nowhere and you're swinging away and you
[1:37:30] can't hit
[1:37:32] it where' that picture come from that's
[1:37:35] the
[1:37:36] mystery poor girls they don't understand
[1:37:38] any of the analogies I'm using do
[1:37:44] that you wonder sometimes how this
[1:37:49] boy is so much like us in the way of how
[1:37:52] we see us
[1:37:56] his his
[1:37:57] identity was what was formed and
[1:38:00] fashioned based upon his
[1:38:04] history except for the history that
[1:38:06] spoke to who he really was is it funny
[1:38:10] how we have a tendency to cut off the
[1:38:12] main part and focus on the stuff that
[1:38:15] doesn't really matter
[1:38:18] anyways oh you say that's mean it
[1:38:21] doesn't matter he's crippled up he's a
[1:38:22] he's a beggar but in God's eyes and also
[1:38:25] in David's eyes it didn't
[1:38:28] matter what we put so much weight in
[1:38:31] what we put so much worth and value upon
[1:38:34] to God means
[1:38:40] nothing I've been like this
[1:38:43] boy sitting in church like you hearing
[1:38:46] men of God preach just like I'm
[1:38:49] preaching and hear them say you're the
[1:38:51] bride you're an overcome you're a
[1:38:53] conquer you're this God loves you this
[1:38:55] that and the other and sit there and
[1:38:56] think to myself how in the world could
[1:38:58] God really love
[1:39:04] me you say nobody
[1:39:07] uhhuh weirdos just don't forget
[1:39:11] that we're weird we're strange we're
[1:39:15] odd we
[1:39:17] are because the parts we should be
[1:39:19] screaming
[1:39:20] amen we're sitting there going
[1:39:24] how who what where when
[1:39:29] why oh praise the lord well one thing
[1:39:33] I've learned about El when I get you
[1:39:34] quiet I got you right where I want
[1:39:42] you why do we do that to oursel because
[1:39:45] we shape what we believe our own
[1:39:49] identity really
[1:39:51] is based on experience es we've
[1:39:55] had you take a person getting ready to
[1:39:57] get married take a young man young woman
[1:39:59] and they're inching toward getting
[1:40:01] married if they've ever had any bad
[1:40:03] relationships before that every
[1:40:06] relationship they ever had they will
[1:40:08] take those experiences and they will
[1:40:10] carry that baggage over into this new
[1:40:15] thing and the second he or she says
[1:40:18] something that sounded like their mean
[1:40:21] Daddy or mad mama
[1:40:24] or boyfriend or girlfriend that cut him
[1:40:26] or abused them or done some evil thing
[1:40:28] or hurt their
[1:40:31] feelings they see that person not the
[1:40:34] one that's in front of
[1:40:36] them why you form your identity of what
[1:40:40] you
[1:40:40] believe and friends when it really gets
[1:40:43] concrete it takes God to take that thing
[1:40:45] away from you and you've got to be
[1:40:47] willing to get rid of that
[1:40:49] too because if you're not willing to say
[1:40:51] to the Lord Jesus take all of this out
[1:40:54] of my heart move all of these thoughts
[1:40:56] away from me remove from me what I
[1:40:58] believe and fill my heart soul mind body
[1:41:01] strength with what you
[1:41:03] believe that's the only way you're going
[1:41:05] to win in this life is God has to fill
[1:41:08] your
[1:41:09] heart your soul your mind your body
[1:41:12] everything with what he believes about
[1:41:15] you why do you think we preach what do
[1:41:17] you think you come to church for it's so
[1:41:19] that we can by the grace of God somehow
[1:41:22] preach it in a way that you'll let go of
[1:41:24] this and let the word fill the
[1:41:26] other glory to God
[1:41:30] hallelujah That's The Power of preaching
[1:41:32] the gospel that demon is cast away from
[1:41:35] you and that idea is wrapped out of you
[1:41:38] or cut by a two-edged
[1:41:41] sword and then
[1:41:44] then the Holy Ghost can go into that
[1:41:46] absent place and
[1:41:48] go here's what I think about you you
[1:41:51] think you're a loser my fibf
[1:41:54] but I don't believe that about
[1:41:56] you I wonder how many nights this kid
[1:41:59] sat around going oh oh my life is such a
[1:42:02] mess oh I'm never going to make myself
[1:42:04] anything I'm never going to accomplish
[1:42:07] anything yet with all of them thoughts
[1:42:10] that MF had the one thing he never
[1:42:13] realized was
[1:42:15] that he was on David's mind
[1:42:18] too so don't worry where you're at in
[1:42:21] your life don't worry about it the King
[1:42:23] has got you on his
[1:42:26] mind he's thinking about
[1:42:29] you he's meditating on
[1:42:32] you he's meditating on you you know how
[1:42:34] you sit around you think about certain
[1:42:36] things and you meditate and you go back
[1:42:37] over and over and over is it hard for us
[1:42:40] to
[1:42:41] believe that Jesus is also meditating on
[1:42:45] us you know the Bible said about a
[1:42:47] minister that is to attend continually
[1:42:50] continually upon the needs of of the
[1:42:53] people he's preaching to well if a
[1:42:55] preacher is supposed to contend and
[1:42:58] always continue thinking over and over
[1:43:01] how can I help this one how can I bless
[1:43:02] that one how can I free this one of that
[1:43:05] what quote what scripture what thing can
[1:43:07] I find to help them overcome if I'm
[1:43:10] thinking that way as a preacher how much
[1:43:12] more is Jesus thinking that about you
[1:43:15] when he sees you've lost this and you've
[1:43:17] went through that and you've had this
[1:43:19] problem and that problem how much more
[1:43:22] is he thinking upon
[1:43:26] you meditating he's got his mind on what
[1:43:29] your needs are he's got his mind on
[1:43:32] where you're coming from and where
[1:43:33] you're
[1:43:37] going and whether we like it or not he
[1:43:41] don't see us the way we see
[1:43:48] ourselves I don't like that I know
[1:43:51] because it takes the control out of your
[1:43:52] hands
[1:43:54] but that's the way God wants us
[1:43:55] sometimes vulnerable weak and
[1:44:00] exposed because if you don't get there
[1:44:02] he can't help
[1:44:04] you you think you got it all wrapped up
[1:44:06] and Life by the tail and you got all
[1:44:08] this figured out that's when you're
[1:44:09] goingon to get in
[1:44:11] trouble praise the
[1:44:14] Lord no doubt this boy defined himself
[1:44:17] by his
[1:44:20] shortcomings comes before David and
[1:44:22] calls himself a dead
[1:44:24] dog that's pretty low ain't
[1:44:27] it you understand this terminology that
[1:44:29] he's
[1:44:30] using in the Bible in the Old Testament
[1:44:33] they wasn't even allowed to receive the
[1:44:34] tithe off a dog because it was
[1:44:37] considered the lowest animal in all of
[1:44:40] the animal
[1:44:42] kingdom nothing against your Pooch but
[1:44:44] we're talking about Old Testament
[1:44:49] now and this boy doesn't even call
[1:44:51] himself a dog
[1:44:54] he calls himself a dead dog it tells you
[1:44:57] where his mind was
[1:44:59] at what he what he thought about
[1:45:04] himself it's like the saraph phenician
[1:45:06] woman when Jesus says not me to give the
[1:45:07] children's bread under the dog the real
[1:45:09] translation when she said yes master but
[1:45:11] the dogs she didn't say dogs the real
[1:45:14] translation of that is the little dogs
[1:45:17] she humbled herself even lower Jesus
[1:45:19] called her a dog the lowest thing she
[1:45:21] made herself even lower than that I'm
[1:45:23] not even a full grown
[1:45:24] one I'm a baby dog a
[1:45:27] puppy praise the
[1:45:29] Lord what Jesus say I haven't found
[1:45:32] Faith like this in all of
[1:45:34] Israel because you know sometimes name
[1:45:38] calling is
[1:45:40] appropriate because God likes to test
[1:45:42] you sometimes to see what you're going
[1:45:44] to do it's like I said to someone just
[1:45:46] the other night what would you think if
[1:45:48] you were living in brother bram's time
[1:45:49] and you were sitting in the Pew and you
[1:45:51] sitting there as a woman and he said you
[1:45:53] got makeup on your face hello good
[1:45:55] morning Miss dog
[1:45:57] meat you know what the modern day woman
[1:45:59] does same thing they done back then call
[1:46:01] me dog meat I have you know I'll go to
[1:46:03] somebody else's
[1:46:04] Church they've got live streaming other
[1:46:11] places but a real Christian lady does
[1:46:14] when she hears things like that she says
[1:46:16] that's right I'm a dog not even a dog
[1:46:18] I'm a little
[1:46:20] dog but here my fi Chef is making
[1:46:22] himself even lower than that I'm a dead
[1:46:27] dog David says oh
[1:46:31] my if he could talk and maybe add
[1:46:34] comment narrative to this maybe David
[1:46:37] would have said something like I don't
[1:46:38] see you that way why do you see yourself
[1:46:41] that way why why do you think of
[1:46:44] yourself in this manner don't don't you
[1:46:46] love sermons like that when the Lord
[1:46:48] comes along and anoints Men of God to
[1:46:50] preach to you just in that manner here
[1:46:52] you've been beating yourself up all week
[1:46:54] made some stupid mistake or you're
[1:46:55] living with something in your past and
[1:46:56] in your mind you're just constantly
[1:46:58] wrestling and battling and you're
[1:46:59] telling yourself how awful you are all
[1:47:01] of a sudden Here Comes King David in the
[1:47:03] Pulpit I don't see you that
[1:47:06] way I don't see you as a failure I don't
[1:47:09] see you as a
[1:47:12] loser you're an undone creation of God
[1:47:15] dominated by the
[1:47:18] devil and I'm not here to have pity on
[1:47:20] you I'm here to offer you a seat at my
[1:47:25] table why so he can begin reidentifying
[1:47:30] himself because he's a royal he's a
[1:47:33] royal person so David wanted him to live
[1:47:36] like royalty eat like royalty talk like
[1:47:41] royalty function like royalty live in
[1:47:43] Royal
[1:47:46] places no wonder Paul said we are in
[1:47:49] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus God
[1:47:53] wanted us to go ahead and get a little
[1:47:54] taste of what royalty felt like on this
[1:47:57] side glory to God not wait till we get
[1:48:00] to the Millennium not wait till we get
[1:48:01] to heaven but he said I'll catch you up
[1:48:04] right now in the Heavenly places so you
[1:48:06] can know what it's
[1:48:11] like that's why when we pray read the
[1:48:13] Bible come to church and we get caught
[1:48:15] up in that atmosphere that's why it's
[1:48:16] good for us to get a
[1:48:19] taste of what it means to be royalty
[1:48:26] praise be to
[1:48:29] God now let's turn to Exodus chapter
[1:48:33] 30:1 let me show you a couple
[1:48:36] types and in some of these types I want
[1:48:38] to show you we're going to kind of
[1:48:41] change the scene just a little bit but
[1:48:44] we're going we're staying with the same
[1:48:45] idea
[1:48:46] here about imperfections and things of
[1:48:49] this nature I I want to show you how
[1:48:50] this fits in Exodus chapter 3 vers 10 I
[1:48:53] want you to pay attention to how he
[1:48:54] words this and Aaron shall make an
[1:48:57] atonement upon the horns of it horns of
[1:48:59] the altar once in a year with the blood
[1:49:01] of the sin offering of atonements once
[1:49:05] in a year shall he make atonement upon
[1:49:07] it throughout your
[1:49:09] Generations it is most holy unto the
[1:49:12] Lord now if you have a a pencil a paper
[1:49:14] a pen or something you want to make a
[1:49:15] note some maybe your device or something
[1:49:18] Leviticus chap 16:34
[1:49:22] Leviticus
[1:49:24] 16:34 I'll going give you one more
[1:49:27] numbers
[1:49:29] 6:14 Leviticus
[1:49:32] 16:34 Numbers
[1:49:35] 614 each one saying and make an offering
[1:49:38] without
[1:49:40] blemish bringing that that offering to
[1:49:43] the to the altar of the Lord now I want
[1:49:46] you to pay attention to the reality of
[1:49:49] this we read these scriptures and we
[1:49:51] think very like tunnel vision we just
[1:49:53] see one little thing but you have to
[1:49:55] really expand your view and look at all
[1:49:57] of Israel at this time you realize
[1:50:01] that in the Kingdom of Israel was there
[1:50:04] not that there was not only just the
[1:50:06] people that God cared about but also the
[1:50:10] animals the animals were also a part of
[1:50:13] the inheritance as we know Moses told
[1:50:16] Pharaoh not one hoof will be left
[1:50:21] behind God God cared about the animals
[1:50:23] so much brother Brad that when brother
[1:50:26] bradam was translated beyond the curtain
[1:50:28] of time he said all you ever loved and
[1:50:30] all that ever loved you would be there
[1:50:31] and about that time his horse and his
[1:50:34] dog appeared before
[1:50:38] him God loved these animals so much that
[1:50:41] he gave adam the ability to name
[1:50:47] them but now after the fall
[1:50:53] you know the thing that crippled up M
[1:50:54] michef and made him a breathing shame
[1:50:57] same thing that made us a breathing
[1:50:59] shame as Man became the Breath of Life
[1:51:02] came into man he became a living Soul
[1:51:04] after the fall we became a breathing
[1:51:06] shame when you take the breath of life
[1:51:08] no matter how pretty that little baby is
[1:51:10] when it comes to the age of
[1:51:12] accountability and it comes to the place
[1:51:13] to where that it can understand right
[1:51:15] from wrong watch and see what happens
[1:51:16] that little nature starts coming
[1:51:18] out they lie and they do all kinds of
[1:51:21] things and you think as a parent where
[1:51:22] in the world where in the name of God
[1:51:24] did they learn to do this stuff was born
[1:51:26] in
[1:51:27] them just like it was born in
[1:51:30] you parents ins seert your amen
[1:51:34] here
[1:51:37] aha them kids ain't tell only heathens
[1:51:39] you scream at You' be screaming at
[1:51:40] yourself too cuz you were just like them
[1:51:43] once come on
[1:51:44] now right we just forget we get so old
[1:51:47] and holy and you know walking in angels
[1:51:49] wings and all this that we forget that
[1:51:50] we used to be the same way
[1:51:54] I have to remember when I see my girls
[1:51:56] do things that absolutely just baffles
[1:51:58] me I get man I said go what's the matter
[1:52:01] with you and I said whoa bji little
[1:52:07] doggy they're only doing the same stuff
[1:52:09] you did when you was a
[1:52:13] boy God had mercy on
[1:52:21] you amen
[1:52:27] amen you see how people begin to just
[1:52:31] think about that one point for a moment
[1:52:33] you think about how people just begin to
[1:52:36] emerge their true self just emerges
[1:52:39] after some
[1:52:40] time little kid that little baby that
[1:52:43] girl that boy and they're so sweet and
[1:52:44] they're so kind and then all of a sudden
[1:52:46] this nastiness comes from
[1:52:49] somewhere parents are so shocked I know
[1:52:51] I'm the same way
[1:52:53] my
[1:52:54] girl my daughter my
[1:52:56] son what you think he was Raising little
[1:53:00] Jesus
[1:53:02] hello Mercy y'all getting Baptist quiet
[1:53:07] now keep this up we might be Methodist
[1:53:09] quiet for that's not just not go down
[1:53:11] we're trying to go
[1:53:16] up but the mindset
[1:53:21] becomes where raised in a message oh
[1:53:23] wait but every one of us no matter where
[1:53:26] we come up raised in the message not I
[1:53:28] was too by the
[1:53:30] way my mother and father came in in 68 I
[1:53:32] was born in 77 they' had been in the
[1:53:34] message several years I was here because
[1:53:36] of the message my mom was reading a book
[1:53:37] one day where brother B talked about the
[1:53:39] woman being the beding ground of Life
[1:53:41] the Lord moved on her my father and
[1:53:43] mother decided to have another child she
[1:53:44] miscarried I came along right after that
[1:53:46] March the 10th 1977 I was here because
[1:53:49] of a message book
[1:53:53] so I was raised on the Pew just like you
[1:53:55] guys
[1:53:56] are I know what it means to be raised in
[1:53:59] an environment where just believe the
[1:54:00] message believe the prophet on and on
[1:54:02] and on I know what that
[1:54:04] means but because of the
[1:54:08] Fall I'm a breathing shame until I
[1:54:11] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:54:13] baptism in my
[1:54:21] heart and I'm a crippled up
[1:54:24] mess not because of what I've done only
[1:54:26] but because of generations before
[1:54:29] me that passed things down to me that
[1:54:32] made me a crippled up
[1:54:38] mess and so because of the Fall thorns
[1:54:40] and thistles dysfunction brother talk
[1:54:44] about this seed of discrepancy he said
[1:54:46] that Satan sprayed his DDT called it and
[1:54:48] different little chemicals and things on
[1:54:49] the earth and now it produces all of
[1:54:51] this ugliness
[1:54:53] so now we go back to the scene in Israel
[1:54:55] where now God is demanding a paint to
[1:54:58] keep from seeing the sins of the
[1:55:02] people and now the the the the the order
[1:55:05] the standing order is find one lamb that
[1:55:09] is
[1:55:11] perfect what a tall
[1:55:13] order in a time of hybridization in a
[1:55:16] time of imperfection imagine trying to
[1:55:18] find that today you can't even go to
[1:55:20] Walmart without getting a bunch of
[1:55:21] hybrid tomatoes
[1:55:22] or maters I am in Kentucky ain't I I
[1:55:25] guess I don't have to speak
[1:55:27] Yankee come on now everything is
[1:55:32] deformed but God says I don't care if
[1:55:36] that cold over there and I don't care if
[1:55:38] that Ram over there and I don't care if
[1:55:39] that over there and that over there and
[1:55:40] that over there and that over there is
[1:55:42] blind Hal withered crippled missing
[1:55:45] something broken whatever it might be I
[1:55:48] want one perfect
[1:55:51] lamb and that one perfect lamb is going
[1:55:54] to stand in the place GL right all the
[1:55:58] rest of the crippled up little animal M
[1:56:05] chefs and so Aaron takes this Blood puts
[1:56:08] it upon the horns of the altar now we
[1:56:09] think in our mind that the paint was
[1:56:11] just some kind of little thing maybe on
[1:56:13] the
[1:56:14] altar but you realize when this
[1:56:16] sacrifice was offered it's the same as
[1:56:19] that Blood Ring that went around the
[1:56:20] world the paint painted all of Israel
[1:56:23] and when God looked down at the nation
[1:56:25] of Israel the entire
[1:56:27] nation he looked through red saw their
[1:56:31] red
[1:56:33] sins and could only see
[1:56:35] white praise be to God why not because
[1:56:39] of all the crippled up Lambs not because
[1:56:41] of all the other animals that were
[1:56:42] raised in the
[1:56:45] message but because of one perfect
[1:56:49] lamb oh Hallelujah
[1:56:53] brother B tells a story about this old
[1:56:55] Colt he said he said the when the master
[1:56:58] gets home he'll knock me in the head but
[1:57:01] he said if that mother farmer could
[1:57:04] talk she'd say
[1:57:06] look he said he offered a lamb for the
[1:57:11] household he said and brother R said the
[1:57:13] awfulest thing you ever seen is an old
[1:57:15] mule these aren't together tail sticking
[1:57:17] up in the air and he cross
[1:57:19] eyed I said I've preached to people like
[1:57:21] that in church
[1:57:25] say certain things they get crosseyed or
[1:57:27] tail up and they and their legs all
[1:57:30] which away and I've seen them thumb
[1:57:31] through Psalm books and fidget and jump
[1:57:33] and run to the bathroom 148
[1:57:36] times I guarantee something you see
[1:57:39] people start doing that stuff they need
[1:57:40] a prayer line or they need a whip in one
[1:57:41] of the
[1:57:43] other praise the Lord
[1:57:46] somebody but in all that brother bam
[1:57:49] talked about this little crippled up
[1:57:50] disfigured mule
[1:57:52] he said if that Mama could come by that
[1:57:54] Mama farmer the wife the far of the
[1:57:57] farmer oh he'll knock me in the head I'm
[1:57:59] a
[1:58:00] disfigured a
[1:58:03] monstrosity I said if she could speak
[1:58:05] she'd say no you don't have to
[1:58:08] worry because he offered his perfect
[1:58:11] lamb for the whole
[1:58:14] household
[1:58:17] glory and now this lamb takes the place
[1:58:20] and dies so the the disfigured mule can
[1:58:25] live glory to God that's you and
[1:58:28] I disfigured crippled up because of the
[1:58:32] foul a breathing shame living in low
[1:58:35] dear in a place of
[1:58:39] lack but because of the perfect
[1:58:43] L
[1:58:45] Hallelujah Glory because of one perfect
[1:58:49] lamb come on
[1:58:50] somebody because of one perfect sinless
[1:58:54] Holy
[1:58:56] Lamb this disfigured mule can live
[1:59:04] on brother B says what a picture of
[1:59:09] redemption he said that little old mule
[1:59:11] could just kick his little old heels up
[1:59:13] in the air don't forget clapping's good
[1:59:16] but don't forget you're kicking up in
[1:59:17] the hill
[1:59:19] too worship of the Lord and say praise
[1:59:22] the Lord and Nod in your head that's
[1:59:23] good too but don't forget the running
[1:59:24] around
[1:59:26] part remember God don't want just formal
[1:59:30] religion when you really get set free
[1:59:32] and you realize that the Lord Jesus took
[1:59:34] your place it'll make you more than just
[1:59:37] a form a little golf clap
[1:59:39] Christian it'll make you holler amen and
[1:59:41] praise the Lord come on somebody help
[1:59:45] me clap on Lord amen clap on but don't
[1:59:49] let it become a formality
[1:59:55] CU it's so easy for us to get settled
[1:59:57] into the rut of Praise the Lord
[2:00:00] hallelujah Jesus died for my sins amen
[2:00:03] you understand what I'm saying to
[2:00:05] you we shouldn't just be settled into
[2:00:08] this idea
[2:00:10] well if you could only go back and
[2:00:12] remember how disfigured you
[2:00:15] were how crippled up you
[2:00:18] were it make you clap your hands all
[2:00:20] right
[2:00:22] amen make your shout praise the Lord cry
[2:00:24] snot roll in the hay whatever you want
[2:00:26] to
[2:00:27] do amen well you say it's not sanitary I
[2:00:30] know it wouldn't look good on social
[2:00:32] media but that's the way some Christians
[2:00:33] need to
[2:00:35] behave it do them good sometimes just to
[2:00:37] get
[2:00:40] free from the idea of the formality of
[2:00:43] it this is what happens in some of these
[2:00:45] other denominal churches and I dare say
[2:00:46] in the message churches the same we
[2:00:48] preach these kind of things and we're
[2:00:50] just kind of oh well praise the Lord
[2:00:52] isn't that great yeah Jesus died for my
[2:00:54] sins when's the last time you looked in
[2:00:57] the mirror to see that you're
[2:00:59] crosseyed when's the last time to see
[2:01:01] that your tail don't operate right and
[2:01:03] your legs aren't
[2:01:05] straight
[2:01:10] hello unless of course we've blinded
[2:01:14] oursel with message theology so
[2:01:17] deeply that we become these holy
[2:01:20] righteous people within ourselves that
[2:01:22] have no imperfections
[2:01:24] oh I know that's a bad
[2:01:27] word the bride is perfect she is if
[2:01:31] she's laying under the blood of a
[2:01:32] spotless
[2:01:33] lamb but she's not perfect within
[2:01:38] herself praise the Lord I didn't mean to
[2:01:41] discourage you clapping I was trying to
[2:01:42] make a
[2:01:44] point I did that one time got a bunch of
[2:01:46] people mad at me I wasn't trying to
[2:01:48] discourage your clapping I'm just making
[2:01:49] the point we don't want to become forign
[2:01:52] about these things do
[2:01:53] we we want to remember the impact that
[2:01:58] the revelation of what Jesus really done
[2:02:00] for
[2:02:01] us because you know I'll say this for us
[2:02:04] older ones after so many years we start
[2:02:06] to lose sight because we're so far
[2:02:08] separated from that Old life if we're
[2:02:11] not careful the devil get us on the
[2:02:13] other side we get this mentality of
[2:02:14] everything's okay and I'm all right
[2:02:17] and but Lord never let me forget what
[2:02:20] kind of condition I came here by the
[2:02:24] Fall that way I can always
[2:02:27] appreciate what you've done for
[2:02:31] me praise the
[2:02:35] Lord I never want to forget what he's
[2:02:38] done for
[2:02:42] me let's go just a little bit further
[2:02:44] can
[2:02:44] we Ephesians chapter 2 verse2
[2:02:53] call me crippled
[2:02:55] up call me an old mule crosseyed well
[2:02:58] how you think you got
[2:02:59] here you think you were born a thorough
[2:03:01] bread oh I know that's the
[2:03:02] predestination idea of it God saw me
[2:03:05] before the F yeah but he's not talking
[2:03:08] about you he's talking about you not
[2:03:15] you cuz this mother and father they put
[2:03:17] me in a bad
[2:03:19] condition and it took the blood of Jesus
[2:03:22] Christ to change who I was in here even
[2:03:27] though I'm the same man out
[2:03:29] here hair colors the same eye colors the
[2:03:31] same genetics chromosomes all the same
[2:03:34] but in my heart I'm a new creation by
[2:03:36] the grace of God and by the blood of
[2:03:38] Jesus
[2:03:39] Christ now watch what Paul says about us
[2:03:41] Gentiles This Is Us people here tonight
[2:03:43] or this morning I should say Ephesians 2
[2:03:45] and2 then at that time you were without
[2:03:47] Christ being
[2:03:50] aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel
[2:03:53] and
[2:03:55] strangers from the covenants of Promise
[2:03:57] having no
[2:03:59] hope without God in the world all right
[2:04:02] now message people
[2:04:05] brag because he's not talking about
[2:04:08] Israel he's talking about
[2:04:11] us now let's brag about what we've got
[2:04:14] in our compendiums and how many tapes
[2:04:15] we've listened to and how many bibles
[2:04:17] we've
[2:04:19] read according to this right here you
[2:04:21] don't even have a brag
[2:04:23] coming nor do
[2:04:26] I praise the Lord
[2:04:29] somebody according to that I was a
[2:04:31] crippled up
[2:04:33] MF an
[2:04:35] alien a
[2:04:37] stranger without hope and without
[2:04:44] God the word he uses here for aliens is
[2:04:47] to be shut
[2:04:50] out from one 's fellowship and
[2:04:55] intimacy not only were we completely
[2:04:59] shut off we were not even invited we
[2:05:02] were shut
[2:05:04] out of God's fellowship and love and
[2:05:08] care and concern and comfort and
[2:05:12] peace friends stop for a moment and than
[2:05:16] thank when you sit in this church this
[2:05:19] morning and you feel the atmosphere like
[2:05:21] you feel right now and you hear these
[2:05:23] little things and feel things from the
[2:05:25] Lord these little bubbling things that
[2:05:27] come up the goodness of God and you feel
[2:05:29] this stuff working in you and around you
[2:05:31] don't you know how blessed you really
[2:05:34] are not only did God open the door and
[2:05:37] kick it wide open and say come on
[2:05:39] Gentiles it's your turn but he opened up
[2:05:43] himself to his fellowship and his
[2:05:47] intimacy when before that we were
[2:05:50] completely sh
[2:05:53] out just like the foolish virgin
[2:05:56] standing at the door
[2:05:58] knocking as a matter of fact we were in
[2:06:00] such a condition we didn't even care to
[2:06:02] knock we didn't care what the door was
[2:06:04] we wasn't interested in it until the
[2:06:07] door showed up to us till the door came
[2:06:10] to
[2:06:11] me oh I like that I didn't go to the
[2:06:13] door the door came to me
[2:06:16] huah cuz I wasn't looking for God and
[2:06:19] neither was you
[2:06:23] Ephesians chapter 4 now verse
[2:06:26] 17 oh praise the
[2:06:29] Lord hope I didn't discourage you
[2:06:31] clapping
[2:06:32] now I feel bad I got in trouble for that
[2:06:34] once I don't mean to discourage you
[2:06:36] clapping clap please clap God Almighty
[2:06:37] please
[2:06:42] clap verse 17 Ephesians 4:17 this I say
[2:06:46] therefore and testify in the Lord that
[2:06:49] she henceforth walk not as other
[2:06:51] Gentiles walk watch in the vanity of
[2:06:55] their
[2:06:57] mind this is what I was saying before
[2:07:00] when you start making plans for
[2:07:05] yourself that's
[2:07:10] vanity you don't even have to say things
[2:07:13] like oh I'm not a good Christian I not
[2:07:15] even talking about
[2:07:17] that but it is Vanity to entertain that
[2:07:21] you control your own
[2:07:24] destiny oh you say I'm a free moral
[2:07:26] agent whoa you might be but if you're
[2:07:30] gods and you belong to Jesus I don't
[2:07:33] care what decisions you make he's got a
[2:07:36] pathway already determined for you down
[2:07:38] the road and you will take
[2:07:44] it
[2:07:46] amen because if God is determined to get
[2:07:50] us right he will see fit he couldn't
[2:07:53] leave us to our own decisions we would
[2:07:55] never decide for the right way come on
[2:07:58] somebody we would never make that choice
[2:08:01] but God made it for
[2:08:03] me hallelujah hallelujah
[2:08:07] hallelujah he decided for me before the
[2:08:10] foundation of the world he determined in
[2:08:13] his own mind what I would be how I would
[2:08:15] to live in this world and where I I
[2:08:17] would go my destiny would
[2:08:19] be amen amen
[2:08:22] amen and he knows if I take this road
[2:08:26] it's okay because there's another road
[2:08:28] that leads right back to this if I go
[2:08:30] this way it's all right it's going to go
[2:08:31] right back to there if I go here it's
[2:08:32] all right it's going to go back to
[2:08:34] there and the roads that would keep me
[2:08:36] from going back he just shuts them off
[2:08:37] all together I don't even take
[2:08:40] them some people might have got nervous
[2:08:44] if they would have known the story of
[2:08:45] Job like we or Jonah like we know it
[2:08:48] some of might have got nervous looking
[2:08:50] over the banister of Heaven seeing him
[2:08:51] go down to Tarsus but not the Lord the
[2:08:55] Lord wasn't worried cuz he knew before J
[2:08:58] before Jonah made the decision to go
[2:09:00] down to Tarsus for about all 40 years
[2:09:03] there had been this fish that had a
[2:09:04] deformity in it that had a big throat
[2:09:07] that was just a prophet siiz
[2:09:09] swallower and that fish had already been
[2:09:12] prepared Hallelujah before Jonah went
[2:09:15] down to tarus there was already a road
[2:09:18] back to
[2:09:19] Nineveh no matter what you think you've
[2:09:22] decided or what road you think you've
[2:09:24] taken just hang on Jonah there's another
[2:09:27] road that'll take you back to
[2:09:29] him don't worry little prodal you might
[2:09:32] wind up in the hog pin but there's a
[2:09:35] road back to Father's
[2:09:37] House glory to God
[2:09:41] [Applause]
[2:09:44] hallelujah
[2:09:46] amen it's vanity to say I'm going to do
[2:09:50] this I'm going to do that I'm going to
[2:09:51] go here I'm going to go there I'm going
[2:09:52] to be this when I grow up I'm going to
[2:09:53] be this when I get married I'm going to
[2:09:56] vanity then it's vanity for parents to
[2:09:58] say my kids going to be this my kids are
[2:09:59] going to do this my grandma and grandpa
[2:10:01] we're going to do this we're
[2:10:05] vanity you need to add these words to
[2:10:08] everything you think if the Lord be
[2:10:12] willing get that lesson down the rest of
[2:10:15] your life is smooth
[2:10:17] sailing you hear me the rest of your
[2:10:19] life is smooth sailing
[2:10:23] because you think oh I've got a a
[2:10:24] business acument I can do this and I'm
[2:10:27] smart with numbers I that may be
[2:10:29] true but God may not allow you to
[2:10:33] succeed in
[2:10:35] that because he may have another plan
[2:10:37] for your
[2:10:38] life and real Christians want only one
[2:10:41] thing what Jesus wants
[2:10:46] amen look at the next verse having the
[2:10:50] understanding dark
[2:10:53] here's that word again being
[2:10:55] alienated from the life of God through
[2:10:59] the ignorance of sin that is in them
[2:11:01] because of the blindness of their
[2:11:06] heart so they can see but they can't see
[2:11:10] they have
[2:11:11] eyes but they can't understand
[2:11:16] anything you tell them about Christ tell
[2:11:18] them who they
[2:11:19] are and fibf says no I'm just a loser
[2:11:23] I'm a dead dog I'm no good I that may be
[2:11:27] true in your eyes that are darkened
[2:11:29] alienated blackened out you may see
[2:11:33] yourself like
[2:11:34] that but if you can only allow the Lord
[2:11:37] to let you see yourself through his
[2:11:40] eyes then it's a whole new
[2:11:45] world your perception of yourself
[2:11:47] changes alt together when you see
[2:11:50] yourself the way he he
[2:11:54] does Colossians 1:21 if you'd like to
[2:11:57] write this down again Paul said you were
[2:11:58] sometime alienated and enemies in your
[2:12:01] mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he
[2:12:08] reconciled oh I love this brother Bron
[2:12:10] said that was me William brandham no
[2:12:13] good not fit to live worthy to go to
[2:12:15] hell born in a sinful family raised a
[2:12:17] sinner no good not one sound part about
[2:12:19] me well I wish the tape people would say
[2:12:22] what he said
[2:12:24] there well I could quote what a God he
[2:12:26] was wish theyd quote this one one
[2:12:28] time brother bradam didn't see himself
[2:12:31] the way a lot of people have seen
[2:12:33] him he realized what he was but if
[2:12:35] you'll watch this quote carefully he
[2:12:37] goes so far and
[2:12:39] stops the next thing he says but one day
[2:12:43] I accepted Hallelujah he says when God
[2:12:46] looked down on Christ and Christ took my
[2:12:48] place then God don't see me he sees the
[2:12:50] perfect one
[2:12:52] one cuz you see there's the balance we
[2:12:54] can recognize who we are here but we
[2:12:57] have to stop after so much and say you
[2:12:59] know what I may have been born this I
[2:13:01] may have been crippled up I may have
[2:13:03] been these other things but one day
[2:13:06] God's mercy and Grace got a hold of me
[2:13:09] you see the problem is we like to live
[2:13:12] sometimes in that down trash low low
[2:13:15] dear that downcast type of living but
[2:13:18] God wants you to see this you can
[2:13:20] recognize your your weaknesses of who
[2:13:22] you are as a human being in this world
[2:13:24] but also draw a
[2:13:27] line that may be true
[2:13:30] but God who was rich in
[2:13:33] mercy God who was rich in Grace
[2:13:37] Hallelujah saved me delivered me brought
[2:13:39] me up out of the out of the muck and the
[2:13:41] m to make me what I am
[2:13:44] today praise the
[2:13:49] Lord little fur I'm going quit I'm going
[2:13:51] quit I see the
[2:13:55] time in the 10 virgins brother BR says
[2:13:58] it like
[2:13:59] this he says oh I was that
[2:14:05] barabus I was the one that deserved to
[2:14:08] die and he took my place
[2:14:11] imagine I I was thinking of this the
[2:14:13] other day and I thought to myself what
[2:14:14] it must have been like for this man in
[2:14:16] this prison
[2:14:18] cell no doubt he prepared himself for
[2:14:21] months years we don't know weeks he's
[2:14:24] going to Calvary and he's going to be
[2:14:28] crucified and all of a sudden he sees
[2:14:30] that big Roman soldier come down through
[2:14:31] there and he hears them chains are
[2:14:33] clanking and he hears all that that
[2:14:35] armor and all that stuff clinking
[2:14:36] together and them big heavy boots
[2:14:38] walking down and stick the key in the
[2:14:40] lock so to speak and pull the door open
[2:14:43] one of them big Burly guards walk in
[2:14:45] there maybe a big old red beard like I
[2:14:48] got rabbis
[2:14:52] you're
[2:14:57] free what don't don't be playing with me
[2:15:01] man don't be playing with me
[2:15:04] now you're not you're not trying to
[2:15:05] trick me is this a
[2:15:07] joke did you hear me I said you're free
[2:15:11] get
[2:15:12] out what H how how could that
[2:15:16] be you you all coming to take me to
[2:15:18] Calvary in just a little bit no not
[2:15:21] today listen if it was up to me you'd be
[2:15:25] rotten up there right now Birds picking
[2:15:27] your eyes out you low down filthy
[2:15:31] criminal we know
[2:15:34] you come here a
[2:15:36] minute pulls him out of the cell and
[2:15:38] right down the hallway can see at the
[2:15:40] end there's Pilot's judgment
[2:15:42] homeall you see that man standing that
[2:15:45] purple robe on him and that crown of
[2:15:46] thorns on his
[2:15:48] head what in the year we're allowed to
[2:15:50] release is a
[2:15:52] prisoner and the people didn't want you
[2:15:55] they wanted
[2:15:58] him that's the one that took your
[2:16:05] place did you imagine what it must have
[2:16:08] felt like for him to look down that
[2:16:09] hallway so to speak and see Jesus
[2:16:12] standing down at the end of it you know
[2:16:14] the amazing thing history records that
[2:16:16] barabus is first name barabus was his
[2:16:19] surname
[2:16:21] the first name of barabus was actually
[2:16:25] Jesus Jesus
[2:16:31] barabus and can you
[2:16:34] imagine what it must have felt
[2:16:37] like to
[2:16:40] realize I'm not going to die at Calvary
[2:16:42] after
[2:16:43] all because you see when we look up and
[2:16:45] see the three crosses we see the thief
[2:16:48] here the thief here and Jesus in the
[2:16:50] middle but the origin scene would have
[2:16:51] been one thief barabus and another thief
[2:16:55] but you see the thief that was on his
[2:16:58] left it was he pardon right the left
[2:16:59] side I should say correct left right
[2:17:02] yeah left
[2:17:04] correct the thief on his left side was
[2:17:07] predestinated by God to be pardoned by
[2:17:10] Jesus at
[2:17:11] Calvary and you see Not only was the
[2:17:14] road to Calvary a predestinated pathway
[2:17:16] for all of the whole world but there was
[2:17:19] one little thief up there that needed
[2:17:21] some personal intimacy and contact with
[2:17:24] Jesus his whole life had been spent
[2:17:27] doing the wrong
[2:17:29] thing while he's hanging at
[2:17:32] Calvary and he hears all that's going on
[2:17:34] and the scene that's unfolding before
[2:17:37] him Jesus looks and
[2:17:39] says you believe
[2:17:42] that can you say Amen to
[2:17:46] that LE Thief says you better believe I
[2:17:48] can Amen to that he said this
[2:17:52] day you'll be in Paradise he said Lord
[2:17:55] remember me you you understand it
[2:17:58] doesn't matter how you
[2:18:02] come we all have a destiny if God wants
[2:18:05] us there we're going to come whether we
[2:18:07] like it or
[2:18:13] not if you ever get some time to listen
[2:18:15] to this interview this is right before
[2:18:17] brother BR preaches the Masterpiece this
[2:18:19] is an interview with sister Bruce
[2:18:21] and he's talking to sister and he's
[2:18:22] telling her you know all the little
[2:18:24] things that's going on in her life and
[2:18:25] how he's watched her and all that but I
[2:18:27] love I love how brother Braham says this
[2:18:29] this is in July of 64 if you'd like to
[2:18:31] look it up he tells sister Bruce we've
[2:18:34] got a blood sacrifice laying there
[2:18:36] listen to these words God don't even see
[2:18:40] us he hears our
[2:18:44] voice but he sees the blood of Christ
[2:18:46] that's it he sees the blood of his own
[2:18:49] son it's our voice
[2:18:52] Christ's
[2:18:53] blood then it's Christ talking through
[2:18:58] us to God so therefore we're not Sinners
[2:19:01] no more we are
[2:19:06] Christian glory to
[2:19:09] God can you
[2:19:11] imagine this is how Rapture and
[2:19:14] resurrection's going to
[2:19:16] happen because for
[2:19:19] us the shout is the message the voice
[2:19:23] comes from the shout The Voice come the
[2:19:26] heart of the
[2:19:27] elect there you are standing there
[2:19:29] looking in the mirror one day and your
[2:19:31] hair falling out or getting gray and got
[2:19:33] wrinkles in your high sister and you're
[2:19:35] wearing glasses and false teeth and all
[2:19:37] kinds of things and all of a sudden you
[2:19:39] feel like this
[2:19:42] sharp and something moves on you the
[2:19:44] Holy Ghost moves on you says
[2:19:47] speak just like everything else in your
[2:19:50] life that you've done by faith rapturing
[2:19:51] faith will culminate with a voice from
[2:19:54] the elect that comes straight from the
[2:19:56] voice of
[2:19:58] God and I believe this with all of my
[2:20:00] heart that the elect of God will just
[2:20:01] simply speak it
[2:20:04] change you know why'll happen because it
[2:20:08] won't be our
[2:20:10] voice it'll be his voice
[2:20:15] speaking remember he said when he called
[2:20:17] for the name of
[2:20:18] Lazarus had not he specified
[2:20:22] Lazarus the entire Resurrection General
[2:20:25] all together would have taken place
[2:20:26] right
[2:20:28] there and where is the voice of God in
[2:20:31] the last day no longer in brother
[2:20:33] brandom it's in the elect of
[2:20:37] God that's how when Cancer's in your
[2:20:40] body that's how when you're eat up with
[2:20:42] diabetes and blood pressure problems and
[2:20:45] and and all kinds of other things PCOS
[2:20:48] and ADHD and all these other little
[2:20:51] acronyms and diseases they've named in
[2:20:52] the last
[2:20:53] days that's why when you really claim
[2:20:56] Faith like you need to claim it and you
[2:20:58] really stand on the promise of God say
[2:20:59] no
[2:21:01] more and you say
[2:21:03] body from today on I am
[2:21:06] healed if you say that with the true
[2:21:09] Faith Of God it ain't you
[2:21:11] speaking and that's the reason things
[2:21:13] start
[2:21:14] changing right
[2:21:16] there cuz it's not you talking
[2:21:22] it's the voice of God in one place
[2:21:25] brother B says he hears your voice he
[2:21:26] turns to see you and sees Jesus
[2:21:30] there it's the lamb actually talking for
[2:21:34] you God help me to always no matter how
[2:21:39] blinded these crippled up old MF eyes
[2:21:43] are help me remember that I am a King's
[2:21:47] son and that I can speak like r
[2:21:55] praise the
[2:21:58] Lord over the past several
[2:22:02] months the Lord moved on me some time
[2:22:05] ago as you know I've been in pretty poor
[2:22:07] health for the last couple
[2:22:09] years eat up with blood pressure
[2:22:11] problems and diabetic things and all
[2:22:13] that but early this year the Holy Spirit
[2:22:16] moved on me and in certain ways and
[2:22:18] showed me some things that I I I that I
[2:22:21] I need to claim and I need to do
[2:22:23] differently and as I stand here before
[2:22:25] you by the grace of
[2:22:28] God I'm completely off all of my high
[2:22:30] blood pressure medicines I've got normal
[2:22:32] blood pressure my eyes are
[2:22:35] healing my vision's coming back and
[2:22:39] right now I'm in the process of kicking
[2:22:41] that diabetic thing into
[2:22:48] remission first of all thank you for
[2:22:51] your
[2:22:52] prayers second of all I want to remind
[2:22:55] you that the Lord Jesus Christ can speak
[2:22:57] through your mouth in the simplest of
[2:23:01] ways all you got to do is believe him
[2:23:04] and trust him and say lord it's not me
[2:23:07] anyways I'm a crippled up old mule with
[2:23:09] cross
[2:23:11] eyes but Lord your perfect
[2:23:14] sacrifice is what makes me who I am
[2:23:18] today let's stand again
[2:23:23] together praise the Lord let's bow our
[2:23:38] heads with your heads
[2:23:42] bound I wonder just before they
[2:23:46] play in this quietness like this
[2:23:51] I wonder how many of you in the church
[2:23:53] this
[2:23:54] morning would stand here and say brother
[2:23:59] Ben I just see that crippled up identity
[2:24:04] that I've always
[2:24:06] been that's all I ever
[2:24:09] see maybe it's a young person people at
[2:24:12] school or people in social media even
[2:24:15] other churches in the message it's a
[2:24:17] shame to say this but I've heard of so
[2:24:19] many situations girls and boys going to
[2:24:21] camps and Revival meetings and running
[2:24:23] into these Center message kids that need
[2:24:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost need to be
[2:24:27] saved say all manners of evil and
[2:24:29] hatefulness and things like
[2:24:32] that may may maybe you just see yourself
[2:24:35] in a certain maybe that identity is
[2:24:38] sticking with you I'm a loser I'm no
[2:24:41] good I'm shame and
[2:24:44] I but maybe today you'd like to say Lord
[2:24:48] Jesus I want to see myself
[2:24:53] differently I want to see myself the way
[2:24:55] you see me I wonder if you put your hand
[2:24:58] in the air and just tell the Lord right
[2:25:00] now God help me see
[2:25:04] differently my goodness look at the
[2:25:06] hands going up around this building
[2:25:07] thank you Lord Jesus for every one of
[2:25:11] them again don't let it be formality now
[2:25:14] let this be the Cry of your heart tell
[2:25:16] Jesus sincerely tell him when you hold
[2:25:19] your hand up before for him tell him
[2:25:21] sincerely Lord I mean this I want to be
[2:25:23] different I want to see
[2:25:25] different I'm not just raising my hand
[2:25:28] because it's something we do and brother
[2:25:29] Ben's asking us too well
[2:25:32] okay but listen if you mean business
[2:25:34] with God God will mean business with
[2:25:37] you so be deathly sincere as sincere as
[2:25:41] you know how say Lord from the bottom of
[2:25:44] my heart I want to see myself
[2:25:46] differently brother Ben will it come now
[2:25:49] maybe not
[2:25:50] month from now perhaps
[2:25:52] not but whatever faith that you put
[2:25:55] before him today don't let go of it
[2:25:59] don't stop
[2:26:00] it don't hold back on
[2:26:03] it put one foot in front of the other
[2:26:05] and keep stepping and claiming Lord you
[2:26:07] see my confession and my testimony today
[2:26:10] and from today on I'm asking you Lord to
[2:26:12] make things
[2:26:14] different in my
[2:26:17] life you know there may be some of you
[2:26:19] here today that are stuck and can't get
[2:26:21] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost over
[2:26:22] this very thing I'm preing right here
[2:26:25] because how can you have faith that God
[2:26:27] wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost
[2:26:28] when you don't believe you're worthy of
[2:26:29] any of
[2:26:30] that and friend there's a difference in
[2:26:33] seeing that you're not able to do it
[2:26:34] within yourself and then just simply
[2:26:36] putting that in front of you and and
[2:26:38] Jesus and saying well God I'm not worth
[2:26:40] it anyhow and you're you you put so much
[2:26:43] doubt in front of you that he can't move
[2:26:46] for
[2:26:48] you you got to push all that out of the
[2:26:50] way children every bit of
[2:26:52] it all you little children of God in
[2:26:54] here whether you're old children young
[2:26:56] children middle I don't care who you are
[2:26:57] you got to push all that doubt away from
[2:26:59] you and say Lord this depression I'm
[2:27:01] fighting this suicide Spirit or this
[2:27:04] cutting Spirit or this vaping thing
[2:27:06] around the school or you know if it's
[2:27:08] young people or something like that or
[2:27:10] if it's the the pressure from families
[2:27:12] for us older people it's you know moms
[2:27:14] and dads and cousins and mother-in-laws
[2:27:16] and these type of people that pressure
[2:27:18] me with this and that
[2:27:21] you got to just shove all of that out of
[2:27:22] your way and say
[2:27:24] Lord I got one thing to focus on and
[2:27:26] that's to do the will of my
[2:27:28] father help me God to get all of these
[2:27:31] little voices and things out of my way
[2:27:33] so I can focus on the right
[2:27:35] things just friends time ain't stopping
[2:27:37] for nobody and if you're a young person
[2:27:39] in here you'll blink your eyes and take
[2:27:42] one step ahead of you and be in your 40s
[2:27:44] like
[2:27:46] me you look back on your life and you
[2:27:48] think Mercy where did time
[2:27:51] go make all the best steps you can make
[2:27:54] right now this moment don't wait today
[2:27:58] is the day of
[2:28:02] salvation so in your heart decide now
[2:28:05] just decide and clinch it and say from
[2:28:08] today I'm moving on in Jesus
[2:28:12] name now bow your heads with me I want
[2:28:14] to pray with you father for every need
[2:28:17] that was represented here this morning I
[2:28:20] offer one short simple prayer that you
[2:28:23] would help them strengthen them give
[2:28:26] them the ability to walk into that

[2:29:11] do it you want somebody to pray an
[2:29:13] anointed prayer over you fine but you
[2:29:16] know what would make more of a

[2:29:23] standing right there that was able to
[2:29:26] help you get down the road I would love
[2:29:29] to pray for you if you wanted Brother

[2:29:32] got other brothers here that preach they
[2:29:34] would love to lay their hands on you
[2:29:35] they'd be honored to do so I would be
[2:29:37] honored to do so but after what I've
[2:29:40] preached to you today it's going to mean
[2:29:42] more to you if you just claim your
[2:29:45] simple faith and watch it manifest
[2:29:48] before your eyes
[2:29:50] then you'll know that you're not just
[2:29:52] riding anybody's
