Brad comes tonight oh fill my cupboard [Music] I lifted up the floor come and quit this thirsting of muscle [Music] no more here's my cause [Music] amen good to be in the house of the Lord again tonight and man you can have your seeds for just a minute if you'd like we uh we're just going to kind of uh speak just what's on our heart tonight and what the Lord's laid on our heart and I tell you it's a what about the service this morning wasn't that awesome let's give the Lord a hand one more time amen it's just a just an awesome service and thinking about the New Year here coming up and you know they they say whatever you do on the first day of the year you'll be doing the rest of the year I thought we started out pretty good we've we've had Church we've had Fellowship we've had communion we've having church again that's a pretty good start to a new year so how many say we'll keep it going this year amen I tell you what the Lord's certainly been good to us this past year and and thankful for all the opportunities he's done for us and and the church here and watching the the growth of the church and and uh Esther and his family and all they do for the church and and you just don't see the the behind the scenes that goes on throughout the year and we just asked the Lord's blessing on on them uh this 2023 . so but I was uh you know I I was thinking almost called brother Byler last night and said I'm just don't think I'm going to make it to service and just been feeling a little under the weather off and on throughout the week and you know uh the prophet notice there's different uh uh I guess uh demons and tormentors that are throughout the countries and about December and January of every year there's one at vacations in in Kentucky and it causes me to have a dry cough and just it's just aggravating and and uh and I've been having a little bit of chills and and stuff it's not not anymore I feel fine but I think it's just more sinus infection than anything so um but yeah I was almost going to call him last night and say you know what I don't I don't think I'm going to be able to to preach tomorrow night so but it's a I didn't want to give the devil that satisfaction so I said I'm Gonna Keep studying I'm gonna keep praying I'm gonna keep putting forth and we'll just let God move on the scene so Brother David asked me he said in the back he sits are you ready I said are you ever ready are you ever ready because I tell you you can prepare you can pray you can study you can read but if he don't come on the scene the service is just not going to go very well and uh what caused him on the scene you do so we covet your prayers as ministers we covered your prayers so you know I I hope you you know the service this morning I I tell you we uh together we uh preparing and I've had stuff on my mind all week and then it seems like we went a different direction a different scripture completely different scripture come to me yesterday and and I'll just be honest I thought am I just doing this on my own or or what is going on you know because I just didn't feel brother Butler will and he knows you run through times like this you just wonder am I just manufacturing something to tell the people or God or is this you and because it certainly was what I felt like I wanted to preach and you know probably every song every song or singer when they've been asked to sing a special they sat down their seat and they they prepare and they get their mind right and they know what song they're going to sing but their worst nightmare must be if the person gets up in front of them and sings the song they've prepared that must be the worst nightmare well it's a preacher's worst nightmare too so brother Butler gets up this morning he says turn with me to Philippians I was like no no way there's no way he can he can be reading out of Philippians and uh I thought well he surely he can't pick pick my scripture and I thought well you know there's only four chapters in the book so there's a pretty good chance he's going somewhere close to it yeah Philippians 3. so that's where we're at tonight too but it's it's it's all good you know you know and I listen to the songs and as a as a minister you try to pick up on every little detail and be sensitive to the spirit and sensitive to the things that are said and done and the free service and and and those kinds of things and so I think we're right on track and he didn't preach from the direction I'm preaching but uh we'll take a little different approach um but here we are a brand new day right January 1. and I hope everybody's got their goals set in place I was coming to church just a few minutes ago and I seen somebody had an elliptical on the back of the their trailer and I thought well that'll be a closed hanger in about four days so that's what happens to most ellipticals you know but here we are brand new day and January 1st 2023. and thinking about this I want us to look tonight and just kind of my thought was this looking at this first day of the year you could say this is the first day of the rest of your life you've heard that and we've heard it and we've said it and other people have said it and preached on it but the first day of the rest of your life and I thought to myself what a great opportunity it is to know that we have a day-to-day we set aside a first day of the year but in Christ it's every day we a week every day we get up is the first day of the rest of our life and so in reality in the grand scheme of things you could do something if your life that'll really make a count that'll that'll make something happen that God can be pleasing to God because when we think about life we think about time but when we look at really what our life is our life is just a vapor it is so minuscule and and just we're just here it's just a speck on a set of sand and this and the beaches of the sand of time because when we think about that we think about oh we've had a long day we've been at work and man I'm tired and then time drags on and drags on but in God's eyes it's just a snap of the finger things that torment us things that we Hound the things that Hound us it's just it's just a vapor it's here and it's gone and so today is the first day of the rest of your life and that may sound a little a little bold and a little over the top but I want you to think about this because if we are serving a living God if we're serving a living God tonight and the word of God says your steps are ordered by the Lord and your steps are ordered by the Lord then you can rest assured that God's going to make something in your life count whatever you do from this day forward if this is the first day of the rest of your life let it be your best day brother Branham says this and we'll read the scripture here in just a minute I've got a little concoction here it's a lemon and honey and water so we've been slurfing on this for a little bit trying to keep the cough down so uh bear with us and and we'll get through this so brother Brown says this this is a New Year's night Eve he's preaching he says of course everybody's got a Val Road out and a pledge you're going to go and make for New Year's then about a day after tomorrow they'll all be broke he said and so you know you turn a new page every year and then you turn back the next morning and say I did it again how many has ever been there I've lost a thousand pounds in my life or more he says there's one thing he said that I would say and that is like the Apostle Paul said forgetting those things that are in the past all of my mistakes and all the things that I have done impressed towards the mark of the High Calling he said in Christ he said that's my only regrets that I have is errors that I've made in the past year and the past part of my life and I only humbly ask him for Grace to press on toward the mark of the High Calling he said I'm sure that's the testimony of all of us we'd all feel that way let's stand to our feet we read the scripture as we as we read and we'll stand and in honor of the scripture but I want you to think about that as we're as we're reading and brother Byler hit on some of that this morning but this morning we did a reconsecration we rededicated and we re applying ourselves to the Lord to the Lord God Almighty now what do we do with that now that we're here with this day what are we going to do with this day and that would be my my uh title for the scripture for the message tonight is what will you do with this day what will you do with this day Philippians 3 and we'll start with verse 10. that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformidable unto any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend now when you look at that word I may apprehend it means to lay hold of for that which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus so what Paul's saying here is I want to lay hold of all that Christ is because I've come to realize that Christ has laid hold of me so now you've got Paul and you've got Christ in there looking at each other and they've got a hold of each other and one greater place is there to be than hand in hand with Jesus Christ and Paul recognizes this and he says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but that's one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as be perfect thus be thus minded and if anything ye be otherwise-minded God shall reveal even this unto you nevertheless where to we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing Brethren be followers together of me what's he saying watch me watch me the way I act watch me the way I conduct myself Watch Me Be followers together of me and mark them which are also which also walk as ye have for an example for us let's pray Heavenly Father we're just grateful to be in your house tonight Lord and Lord we've come before you today Lord consecrating ourselves rededicating and committing Our Lives fully into your hands today Lord and now we want to ask ourselves what will we do with this day now now that we've done that what will we do with this day and how we approach the days to come Lord we just asked or that you would move on the scene in a mighty way tonight Lord that you would speak to our hearts and as always draw Us close to you Lord because there's no greater feeling than to be in your presence tucked up close into you Lord Jesus when I'll tell you we love you we appreciate you in Christ's name amen you can be seated foreign so I want to speak like I said on what will you do with this day and I'm not going to try to keep you very long tonight I'm going to be conscious of time thank you for your for coming tonight and your sacrifice I think God will honor your sacrifice I know you've missed your nap but please hold off for about 30 minutes before you nap brother Brown said many people say I'm going to quit lying and I'm going to get him around a better class of people I'm going to get into some Society he said here it is God don't care about you turning a new page in our minds as human beings we always want to set goals and we should and we want to get better and we should and we want to be successful in life and we should but he says that is not what the most important thing is to God God does not care about you turning a new page he wants you to turn your heart to Christ he says he wants you to turn your heart to Christ and let him make out of you not what you can do but what he can do not by your good works but by what he does through you he says turn your heart to Christ because Mercy has bought that nothing works that's any man should boast he says for we are Gods because it isn't what I am it isn't Paul wasn't Paul Paul didn't say it isn't what I am but he said it's what God is in me you see brothers and sisters as we look at the life of Paul we see that from the very first day of his conversion his desire and his sole purpose was he wanted that personal relationship with God Paul's number one desire was I want to know the power of his resurrection he states that I want to know the power of His Resurrection The Fellowship of his sufferies I want to know him in such a way that I've never known him before in my life because Paul can draw remembrance and recollect a time that when everything he knew was legalistic everything all lived for God in the kingdom of God was about rules and laws and don't do this and don't do that and and read this and read that and Walk This Way dressed this way act this way Paul says I want much much more than rules and regulations and laws and do's and don'ts he says I want to know Christ that died on the cross for me that is the Christ that I want to know I want to know his power in such a way that I've never seen it before so Paul wasn't interested in his self anymore because that's what Paul was doing before prior he was interested in his status he was interested in setting goals and becoming more prominent and being a better Pharisee are you with me but now it's no more about how I want to be good for himself but he's wanting to know more about Christ to know Jesus is not the same as knowing his historical life it's not the same there's no nothing nothing similar to it it's not the same knowing the doctrines as it is knowing Christ on the cross foreign we can say we know someone because we recognize them right if I point to this picture you recognize that you know who that is if I point to this picture this has been ingrained in our minds as children you know who this is so facial recognition says I know them if I show you a picture of him in in Africa or wherever he I know who that is you know him you can say you know someone because you're acquainted with what he does in other words maybe it's somebody you go and go to the market and hey I know them they work at the market hey that's the butcher at Piggly Wiggly that's that's the the woman that makes bread over at the Dutch Country you know these people by by what they do and you associate it and you can look at someone you say well I know them because I'm on speaking terms with them their relationship's getting a little stronger then because you kind of got a communication you can look at somebody and you can talk to them and they know you and you know them I know them and you can look at someone and and maybe know him because you spend time in their house or with their family and you begin to grow and mold and you begin to know them in a much closer way maybe you know somebody and and many of us have been married and you begin to know it somebody through marriage and all of a sudden now you begin to know everything about this person good bad and ugly you know it but there's something different there's something different there's a different way of knowing who Jesus is that includes all of this but it goes so much farther and so far beyond of just knowing who he is by a picture or by scripture or knowing this or that it's about knowing and having that personal relationship that every drop of blood that was shed on Calvary was shed for you to cover your sins for the remission of your sins for your healing that's knowing god and that's what Paul was wanting to know I want to know him in such an intimate way that he's so important to me that nothing else in this world matters if I were to ask confessions of what what are what are your goals many many of them were I want my business to succeed here I want this I want this I want this for this and sometimes our goals and ambitions are not what really is important to God knowing brothers and sisters knowing Jesus means knowing his power that ought to be our number one goal tonight that ought to be our number one thought is I want to know just like Paul wanted to know I want to know the power of his resurrection I want to know the power of his resurrection I want to know that life that is given to us now not when we die that power is laying here for us today you know Sister Johnny she just crossed over she does that from one dimension of time like a vapor into an eternal destination a Time you know she gained not one bit of Power by doing that why are you so quiet why do we why do we think that because man would make it to heaven now we're powerful no God says I'm going to give you everything that I am now now through the power of my resurrection through the power of my resurrection healing is yours today because the power of the Resurrection said by his stripes and it was a finished work on Calvary I won't strike him no more he took his last stripe why so you can have the power of the resurrection of healing today love is yours today love is a power of a resurrection you don't believe me let me ask you this what does it take for a person to go be beaten spit on mocked and scorned the way he was to die and Rise Again that's love that is the power of the resurrection of love that he would do such as that for you peace is yours today understanding Grace overcoming forgiveness all of this stuff is the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ is evidencing power it's evidence that everything has been sealed that everything Jesus did was true do you think about that it's powerful the life that Jesus lived think about the Miracles think about all the things that happened in those 33 years there but what's more powerful is he done something by the resurrection that sealed exactly what he was nobody could doubt anymore anything he'd done there could be no more naysayers why because he said destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it again we're talking about the man who healed the blind who healed the who opened blinded eyes healed the sick raised the dead he done it to himself that is evidence of a sealed power of God the power of the Resurrection justifies us connected with Jesus Christ the power of the Resurrection is consoling comforting foreign other consolation and comfort is there to know when a loved one passes on that they knew Jesus Christ if you felt like they were thinner no but you want to make sure when your loved ones crossed over that they know who Jesus Christ was that they were saved by Jesus Christ that is the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and Paul says I want to know him in all this magnitude all of these Powers I want it and I want to own it but we know as Christians that this is not going to be an easy Road and we know as Christians many times as we come to this new year every year when this time rolls around we somehow try to convince ourselves that this year is going to be a perfect year well some of us do it's gonna be the best year of my life I hope it is I hope you have no troubles I hope you have no setbacks because it molds us it makes us it causes us to be join heirs with Christ the reality of everything is going to be perfect in this in this next year is a far-fetched idea because brothers and sisters knowing Jesus Paul says is knowing the fellowship of his suffering oh knowing the fellowship of his suffering but the Bible tells us if we're children heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ we indeed suffer with him that we be glorified we get on into verse 12 and through 14 and we see Paul here and he's beginning to talk about his relationship with Jesus Christ many of us think about Paul in such a way of his spiritual maturity right and we think about Paul and we think man this guy has conquered all spiritual difficulties this man's almost right here on the on the verge of near Perfection and we see him right there and but yet what did Paul say he said I'll assure you I'm not perfect Brother David said it in a song service he said Paul said I have to die what daily so that's why I say today is the first day of the rest of your life if Paul had to Die daily I for sure have to Die daily and so us as individuals we have to look at that and Paul says because I'm not perfect I press on I have to press on I realize that I have not arrived Paul says we're not there yet as much as we love it as much as we love this feeling it's just we love the Holy Ghost until we walk through those streets of gold we have not arrived and therefore I have to Die daily and I'm going to have to keep pressing on because Paul says listen to this Paul says I'm going to put my hands through the plow and I'm going to refuse to look back I'm going to keep pressing on many times I think we wake up and and we pray and we get down and before God when we wake up and say God this is what I I want today but I think maybe we should rephrase that when we get down and pray and say God what do you want today you see the difference in the context because in our minds we tell ourselves as Christians that we want to do what God wants to do but God this is the way we want to do it we want our businesses to be so successful so that we can give here and we can give there and we can do this and we can do that but I think the correct approach is God what do you want to do today what do you want me to do with my business today where do you want me to invest my money today where do you want me to go witness today where do you want me to do today what Can I Do Lord to further your kingdom that's our goal in this new year man this church here has been on fire have you noticed the church hears there's been something there's been a movement going on in the church here and people has been getting excited about the word of God why is that it's because we're in a late hour and God is calling out to his bride and he's trying to get her ready and he's trying to alert her to the hour we're living in and his power and his demonstration and His holy spirit is moving amongst the people let me tell you it's okay to Cloud brother Tommy it's okay to shout it's okay to speak in tongues it's okay to do these things Paul Begins the verse with the idea that Jesus Christ had laid hold of him sometimes we get it in our minds that Jesus has got a hold of me I'm a Christian and that's it no it's so much more than that Jesus has a hope to Paul and why does it say that why did it why did Paul say that he wanted he wanted Jesus to have it lay a hole to him and him lay a hole of Jesus why did Paul say that Jesus laid a hold of Paul to make him a new man do you realize that Jesus got to hold them and said Paul I'm going to make you a new man he did that so that Paul would lay a hold to that and see what the converting power of God was all about Jesus laid a hold to Paul to confront to conform and to him the image of Jesus Christ so that Paul could lay a hold of them and wanted to see the nature of Jesus Christ within him you see you can't have a hotel one and the other night I have a hope to view if you want a strong bond it takes two if Jesus can hold on to me as tight as he wants but if I'm not looking to hold on to him I'm not giving him a chance he's not going to let me go if I'm one of his he's not going to let me go he didn't teach us to swim to watch us drown you know the song but it works out so much better if you're locked hand and hand and everything you're doing is is with God lock together hand in hand Paul was focusing on this one thing and he would not let those things which were behind him distracting because it says he pressed on for the prize and if we're not careful as believers if we're not real careful as Believers those things which are behind us distract us whether they be good or bad brother Butler talked about looking in the rearview mirror we're not going to be rearview mirrors Lookers Christians not rearview Christians there's no room for that and look at this the Apostle Paul sometimes looking in the past keeps us from what God has in store for us in the future your past experiences can place doubt in your lives let's talk about it for just a minute you prayed about something you're waiting for something to happen to take place it never takes place at least in your mind and your outlook and you're thinking it never takes place God never answers your prayers six months down the road is another incident another situation you begin to pray and you begin to pray and you're like well this will be just like last time God won't answer it works the same way with fears and anxieties and those kinds of things that hinder us if we continue to look back to the past you can let the fears of things that's happened in your past keep you from doing what God wants you to do in the future and Paul recognized this and Paul began to challenge himself as we as Christians ought to be challenged on a day-to-day basis to keep moving forward to keep walking in the faith and he says Brethren I do not count myself to be have been apprehended but one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind me and repressing toward the goal high calling for the prize of the High Calling of Christ so when Paul says he's forgetting those things which are behind him he's referring to not looking back at past relationships his memories his failures his Temptations things that distract him from that single-minded Focus single-minded Focus remember he wants to get so close to Christ he can't be looking back at the things in his life Paul gives us a an image and Paul was probably one of the greatest illustrators in the Bible he could give an illustration and a picture and paint a picture and he tells us he says I want you to think about an athlete running a race and he says this athlete has to have this under this this uncompromising determination to reach the finish line and win this race I want you to listen to the way the New Living Translation says it I know we we we read out of the King James version don't don't think I've converted but I do look at other commentaries the New Living Translation says it like this I focus on this one thing forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead I press on to reach the end of this race and receive the Heavenly prize for which God through Christ calling us let me tell you brothers and sisters as we run this race Christ Jesus is your biggest fan can you just say I'm standing at the finish line and he's standing at the finish line of this race and he's saying keep running Don't Look Back press forward dig in run get go go go go don't quit don't give up that's what Christ is doing and Paul here is telling us this Paul is telling us to win this race you surrunner must dis Miss ever every distraction have you ever watched Olympic runners when they come to the line they set their feet in they take one hand put it down put this hand down and then they usually bow their head they're meditating getting their thoughts together and then they look up and that's it there is no more distractions it's like the eye of the tiger they've got a goal they've got a purpose their focus is 100 on what's happening in front of them because they know they can't look back if you ever watch a runner run and he begins to look back at the competition they'll catch him and they move so fast that they catch them in just an instant and so he says I got to forget and he says look at this Runner forget what's behind you don't be looking back looking back causes heartache you know when you run forward motion did you ever know that or did you realize that everywhere that you you move your eyes as your body tends to follow yeah watch preachers preach they turn their head they'll start walking this way if I look over here I'm coming back this way natural response to the human anatomy and physiology wherever you look wherever your head goes your body will follow I remember when I used to swim as a young person I was trying to learn how to do flips they said just tuck your head whichever way your head goes your body will will follow you know what it wasn't long I was doing front flips back flips side flips because I figured out wherever way I turned my head that's what direction I would go and Paul's saying be like this Runner don't look behind because when you're running and you're running forward if you look back oh you're slowing down we don't have time to slow down in this race we've got to keep pressing forward and that's why he says I'm pressing towards the mark of the High Calling Paul urges us to stop looking back think about the emotions of looking back and how it hinders your spiritual growth we don't want to we're not trying to rehash your past but if you're honest with yourself that's what you're when you're you're looking back and you're thinking back next thing you know uh bitterness Creeps in unforgiveness Creeps in doubts creeped in jealousy Creeps in yeah anger Creeps in Temptation creep Creeps in deceit Creeps in and the next thing you know you begin to lose this full experience of your salvation because your eyes are not on the prize foreign so I challenge you today and I ask you what will you do with this day what will you do with this day there was a man by the name of Abraham I've got several characters I don't want to bring them out and I want you to realize what he says what he's preaching in these when the prophet's preaching about these I'll bring out some high points but he said there was a man called Abraham and this man was a good man he was a just man but he said I want you to know it was just an ordinary man how many of you feel like you're just an ordinary person you're just an ordinary man or woman child and you're sitting here and you're going through life you're just an ordinary person he said that's who Abraham was you're just an ordinary person he said and Abraham one day did you hear what I said one day he said when he was out in the field he was hunting or picking berries or he was working one day he'd come out there and he said he met God one day one day changes the course of his history one day he said he met God and from that time he was changed he said he could call things that was not as though they were because he had met God he had known the minute the hour that he met God it changed him and God called him to be the father of many nations and believed God and believed his promise because he hadn't met God one day [Music] yeah one day he says when when man meets God it changes his entire makeup let me tell you I'm talking about today I'm talking about tomorrow I'm talking about Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday we need that to be our one day the first day of the next 364 or the first day of the next day of the rest of our life and he says one day he said watch this 25 years later they were trying to disgust him and Tony said you must have believed something wrong Abraham you must have believed something wrong and it says what happened the Bible said no he got stronger and stronger all the time he said he got stronger and stronger all the time giving praise to God because he knew that God had to keep that promise a one-day event there was a man named Moses this man was trained in all the wisdom of the world had all all the theology school by the best he could teach the Egyptian Scholars about the word of God but he was a cat Howard that's your Prophet I said that I did he was a coward he said he was a coward and he was running around on the back side of the desert herding sheep for a stranger but there came a day and we give ourselves little hope of ever overcoming he said and there came a day when God met him there in a burning bush and from that time on Moses was changed because he'd met God in a burning bush and he came face to face with God so he couldn't be the same anymore when I wake up with a temper if I go before God face to face I can't be the same if you want to walk around and money grub and be be mad and angry all the time it's because you haven't been face to face with God and I don't mean ever I mean that day brothers and sisters it's my desire in 2023 to meet God on a day-to-day basis to find out that I want to meet him in the morning I want to meet him in the noon time I want to meet him in the night time I want to meet him over and over and over because I have found out we have just scratched the surface of who God is the more I study the more I realize how minute we are how little we know and how much we think we do he said didn't only change Moses listen now it didn't only change Moses but it changed Israel it changed Egypt it changed the world one day one day there was a little girl teenager she was on the road to the well one morning to get a bucket of water down there in Nazareth says she was a nice little girl she believed she had faith maybe that's your granddaughter maybe that's your daughter maybe that's your niece think about it a good little girl down there to go get a bucket of water she had Faith but what that morning [Music] one time been raised around Church had heard the Scrolls over and over and over but that morning she met God he said and he told her something and she believed it and it changed the whole course of life for this woman and made her immortal do you see what the power of the Resurrection is do you see the power of one day can mean in your life he said that little girl he said that little her name was Mary the mother of there was a man by the name of Peter hey we're gonna hit everybody today every character every every personality you can think of why because it's us it's us today you know scriptures are being written in heaven about us isn't that amazing what will they say but every day we live is being scribed you know the prophets of our whole lives will be played back like on a big screen right well you know what I thought about that and and it just popped up one day and I got to read about this study it's not in my note so this is one of those free things but they found out I forgot what university it was but they said when a person dies they figured out that the neurons in their brain continue to be active for about 10 to 15 seconds okay so you've heard of people having near-death experiences and they've determined when these people would come out of these near-death experiences they would recount their whole life I I see myself as a child I see myself as a young adult I see myself get married I've seen my kids I've seen all of this and it lasted forever it was like I lived my whole life you know how long they were dead about 10 or 15 seconds so in 10 or 15 seconds time when you die your brain fires and your whole life flashes before you that's an amazing thought here's Peter and the prophet said he was an Old Rugged fisherman as rough as they come big old Burley bully guy he said bully this is Peter a big old bully guy probably it's just a big push of a bully rugged fella didn't care about nothing he didn't believe in hardly anything but one day he met God you see it don't matter what your Walk of Life is you can be rough and tough and rugged and think that you're the next thing next thing closest to John Wayne but if you'll ever meet God face to face he said from that time on he was changed from that time he become an apostle of Jesus Christ and we can't forget about the author of our text today Paul's written a text that's been used twice today so we can't forget about Saul of Tarsus here is a murderer of murderers oh a murderer sitting there holding the coats of murderers as they watch Stephen be stoned to death do you know how that ritual was carried out let me tell you how brutal this was and what what Saul set back and watched they would dig a hole in the ground about maybe waist deep and then have the accused get down on his knees in that hole and fill and fill the hole up with dirt around him until nothing stuck out but his chest and his head and then they commenced to beating his brains out with rocks that throws some light on the picture doesn't it and this is Saul of Tarsus this man right here the murderer of murderers and he's going down to persecute more because they're singing and shouting and having a good time in the Lord and he says this is uncalled for this is unheard of they'll be put to death but that day one day I thought it was amazing as I began to study these and look these up and read about these it was always he said but one day but one day he was on the road to Damascus where he met God and God the light of God shined about him and from that time on he was no more Saul of horses but he was Paul who the humble one the make one how does a man who is a staunch cold-hearted murderer how does that man become Meek and gentle and humble one day with God there was a leopard laying at the gates there was a leper laying at the gates and all the remedies of medicine have been used and here he laid with his hands drawn up in his little fingers all survived sores the prophet said as he sat there at the gate and he could hardly drag himself and he was so hopeless but one day he met God the power of Resurrection the power of life one day he met God coming to the gate and he fell down and worshiped him he said if thou wilt thou can make me whole if thou wilt you think how many people must have been sitting around that gate when he come through there I can only imagine many of them are sitting there saying Heal Me Heal Me heal me remember what I said and sometimes we pray I want this I want to be healed I want to be healed I want to be healed instead of saying God what do you want and here's this leper said If thy will he didn't say come heal me If thy will come and heal me from that time he said no more or less leprosy why because he met God face to face with God because a day with God can change your entire life so I ask you again what will you do with this day there's a blind man sitting by the road and the prophet said he couldn't see daylight from dark that's pretty blind so his whole life was a life of just complete utter Darkness nothing he said come up here but one day somebody come walking down the city of Jericho and when he met God from that time he could see he was healed the sight of light had broken to his eyes and he could see again that day that day there was a man tied up in Chains the chains couldn't hold him that he could break the chains with the strength of the demons that he had upon him but the prophet said that one day when he met Jesus he went right back to this country as a good Countryman went back to his house as a father and raised his family why because he met Jesus and let me tell you brothers and sisters there's not one of us sitting here that wouldn't be just as brute as he was if it wasn't for God almighty so I ask you again what will you do with this day how do we have this day how does this day come as I'm closing how do we get this day I tell you how we got this day there was a man on a day one day they took it and they began to spit up on him they began to tie him up and they scores them and they planted a crown of thorns and placed it up on his head and they spat up on his face and then he went down there and they went to the hill called gal goth and he walked up that bumpy road bumpity Bop dragging that cross and he went up to the cross of Calvary and he sat there and he cried out not my will but thine Lord he didn't say come take me off of this tree he said not my will but thine Lord why because we needed one day we needed one day when he would die on that cross go down into the pits of hell and shake the pegs of Heaven of Hell shake the pants of hell and say devil give me those keys we needed that day because without that day Our Lives mean nothing without that day we die a cold hard Sinner's death as musicians come so I ask you once again what will you do with this day and when I say this day every day I have to have it every day you have to have it every day we're not setting a resolution here we're not saying oh every day I'm going to do this or I'm going to do that because you'll fail I put it on my calendar last year I was gonna do this this and this I made it through about January the 19th I think a calendar still on my desk never flipped the first month I had a lot of good intentions but God's not worried about your new Leaf he's not worried about turning the page on that he just won't used to spend time with you face to face hand in hand as you walk through this journey this year you have purpose what will you do with this day let's stand to our feet let's just pray gracious kind Heavenly Father we're just thankful Lord that you moved on the scene tonight We Trust as we lifted your name you were pleased Lord and realizing in ourselves we're nothing and we look at ourselves and we think about Paul and Paul's desire to just know you in such a greater way that he could understand and realize and get a grasp of what the power of the Resurrection was they'll never spit on you again they'll never whoop you again they'll never stick another crown of thorns on your head again they'll never Mock You Again all many will doubt many will will make fun of many will will ridicule the Believers but the work is finished the power of the Resurrection is here for us today the power resurrection power of love and grace and mercy and forgiveness and endurance and dedication and commitment those are all Resurrection powers and Lord we just bow humbly before you this afternoon as we face this 2023 how we want to say Lord make every day a day that I can meet you consecrate my life to you Lord and ask what you want from me [Music] as if I can just do what you want Lord the rest will take care of itself if I can do what you want there'll never be a financial burden there'll never be a need that can't be met I'm not saying we won't have challenges but Lord if we do what your will is you'll take care of your own you'll see us through you'll see us to the other side you'll make us powerful so Lord give us the strength and endurance and the commitment in this year ahead Lord Jesus to live every day with you ready for the rapture Rapture Ready everything if we could get up every morning and say Lord what do you want from me because I just want to be
