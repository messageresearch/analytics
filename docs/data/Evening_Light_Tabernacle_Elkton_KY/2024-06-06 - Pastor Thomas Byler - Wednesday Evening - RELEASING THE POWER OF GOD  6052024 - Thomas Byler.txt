Bram had a time of rest too didn't he love go squirrel onun for a while and go out in the woods and take it easy and we all have our different things and different way of just kind of taking our little amen relax under the juniper tree or whatever you might want to call it amen so praise the lord I can't think of any other the announcements I do know that we've got brother Timothy coming at the middle of the month right brother Tommy Timothy puit we're going to have him around the 20th amen and then I've got uh brother Jesse Smith from akan I've had him uh scheduled for about six month now probably so he'll be here the first of next month brother Jesse Smith he's going to come down amen I went and visited his church and I really liked him I liked his preaching and his church and everything amen and so I wanted him to come down here amen and have fellowship with us amen amen and so it looks like we've got different things going on Amen but amen let's just bow our head and be bow our heads go before the author Lord Jesus we come before you father tonight once again thankful Lord to be able to Father come to the house of God to lay aside all the cares of Life Lord Jesus and everything that's going on and all that has happened Lord and father just to focus on you first we want to thank you Lord Jesus for Brother John Lord Jesus his arteries and everything not being any worse than what they were and father we just pray God that you will take all that dizziness and everything away from him Lord It's also good to see brother uh brother John Wade here father tonight Lord him feeling better we thank you for the touch that you gave him Lord and we just appreciate all the all the times God that you have touched our bodies and made us better Lord father we realize Lord as we get older father one day father we're going to have a brand new body Lord and we just trust you tonight Lord in the service father and thank you Lord for speaking to my heart during the week this week Lord and I just pray God now as I try to speak what you want to say father I just submit myself to you asking God that you will take over lord Jesus and have your way in the service tonight bless us as we open your word reveal and Quicken the word to us now for we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen so I W to I want to take a quote basically and uh that I start it with amen and just kind of pick it up and and and continue a little bit kind of the same line that we've been talking amen and and that we've been going to but if you will turn to Psalms let's turn to Psalms amen and I'm gonna have to see make sure that this little edge here brother Tommy I'll catch my iPad amen I think it does just fine as long as I don't get crazy amen all right so in Psalms 42 amen I'm pretty sure brother Brad we're going to be able to get even to quotes up there amen so we're going to get with you on that when we get to things running again amen because I can no doubt we can get it if we can get script scriptures up we can get quotes up so praise the Lord Psalms 42 as the heart panteth after the water Brooks so panteth my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirsts for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before thee Amen in Matthew 11 got three scriptures I think it is only three that I know of that I've got this evening half a dozen or so quotes amen things that we've heard before Matthew 11 and verse 28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your soul for my yoke is easy and my burden is light may God add His blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen this evening amen tonight I want to speak about releasing releasing the power of God Amen and I basically want to begin with amen and I also kind of thought maybe a subtitle would be letting go Letting Go amen amen the quote I wanted to uh start with was one of the ones I read um last Sunday amen if I can find it that is it may have not sure hope it didn't rearrange it I thought I had it right there right there it is brother bam says it is joy unspeakable and full of glory amen woo I feel twice my size yes sir I'm home now I'm glad I'm glad that we come uh out aren't you happy oh my what God could do with this little group right now what he can do if he can ever get one person in his grip just so that he can hold that one person amen amen just so that he can hold that one person he can put 10,000 to flight with that one person with one person with genuine Faith he can put 10,000 Devils running as hard as they can go yes sir amen you know isn't it something that whenever you talk about God and when you look at God's word it's always it's always pretty extreme amen I mean he says if you can believe all things are possible right that's pretty extreme he said you know with you nothing shall be impossible that's that's God Amen and my concept tonight is about amen letting go and it'll be about you letting go of yourself amen and we call it maybe uh just a onean power just whatever you can do is that right because as long as you're doing it amen you can only do what you can do amen and if you find that it's you doing it most of the time as humans how many knows especially in the Christian ranks and realm if it's you that's doing it it's going to be a catastrophe it's not going to be good anyway not in the real maybe in the natural you might become a millionaire I don't know whatever you can do however far you can but into spiritual if you get your hand in what God's trying to do and you try to do things in yourself I many knows that's a no no it don't work not with God it don't amen so releasing the power of God no doubt but I thinking of of David here how that no doubt but d David had a relationship a close relationship with God and he had seen the power of God Amen I believe in another place he said he thirst to see his power how many tonight thirst and longs to see God's power amen and as you let go of yourself and and get out of the way so to speak then God can do a thousand times more than what just you could do amen one of the one of the first things that a preacher do does when he gets up here is he has to learn to let go to submit himself and you should look at the quotes I read under submitting and so forth under submit how brother bam every time many times he come up and pray now Lord as I submit myself to you commit myself to you let myself go amen and let God have his wonderful for we sing this song let go and let God have his wonderful way amen praise the Lord missed you all last weekend good to see yall amen praise the Lord so it's just wonderful to be back in the house of the Lord I'm going to take my time tonight would that be all right amen and just see if I can somehow try my best to convey what the Lord laid on my heart amen so David thirst even though he was close he thirst for the Living God you and I as a Christian we still thirst we still long to see more of the power of God and there's got to be a way amen that more of that power of God can be released in our lives amen and I'll tell you what just that little thought God brings it back I backslide you backslide amen and we preach it again blessed is thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on day I get still busy a lot of times and oh oh man remember when you preach that remember you've done for God about it and and you know you need to get your mind on by God again I don't care if you're driving down the road I don't care if you're work where you are keep it on God day and night amen and God will bless you with having perfect peace if just that can give you perfect peace what about the rest of it amen so praise the Lord so I thought about this scripture how that he said if he can get him in his hand now uh let's let's look at the other side of it for just a minute I know one place the prophet of God said that Faith or the word of God the sword of the word no matter how sharp it is no matter how real it is he said that sword is only as good as the strength and the arm of the one that's holding it a't that right I mean you know some people just well I got weak Faith well you're not going to kill very many Devils that way amen it's only as sharp and only as good as the one wielding in any battle everybody knows two people's fighting with so guess what the better guy amen does it better he's going to win amen and so that's the same way it is with the word of God it's you know word of God is sharp it'll cut it'll do everything but if your faith is weak and you can't barely even pull a thing up off the ground well you're probably not going to get very far but if you're a man like David doesn't matter what your stature or is but the great strong arm of faith and amen it'll bring giant down and that's what we need amen like I said Wednesday talking our Sunday talking about you know if all you have is mental Faith well that's that much and I still don't understand everything but I'm here to tell you brother bam says that whenever they applied the blood over the lentil and so forth they used a common weed which he said it's just common Faith the kind of faith that you have that your car's going to start I read back there that F kind of f he said you can't even move your finger with without having faith I just read it I was like wow you can't move your head you can't move your arms you can't kick with your feet unless you got faith he says and that's the kind of faith that it takes woo that's right praise the Lord but first of all we're always talking about you know ourself and wielding The Sword and and what what we can do and what we can accomplish and having on the breastplate and having on this and having on that amen putting on the whole armor of God and and so forth but tonight I want to talk to you about a little bit different way because I want you to understand that brother bamet you know that uh you know what what is it what is it now amen that's going to cause 10,000 Devils to run away from you as hard as they can doing a teaching tonight kind of like we did Sunday why are you so quiet I thought boy you really Stomp Them people they were thinking what kind of a stupid question you you know why are we so quiet well you that ain't telling you nothing i' have been out there for while I haven't got a clue why you're so quiet let's talk about a box wagon maybe being full or something I can tell you then why you know might be a little more quiet you know if you're full and you know and so forth like brother bam said but anyway the so de question is question tonight is what puts it on on the run is it your ability is your faith that you have is the weapons that you have no no brother bam said if he can get one person in his grip if he can get and he can get a hold of one person nothing when God grabs a hold of you and you become the weapon you are God's weapon that God uses to bring 10,000 and that's exactly right look back in the scriptures and find out it was one man by the name of Moses when he come into surrenderance to God Amen would let go of himself and forgot about all of his can't talk can't do this can't do that Amen Let Go of all that and did what God said he put the whole Egyptian Army amen down into the red say one man one man one person in the hands of God you see why brother B says man what could happen with a little group like this my we could have every call kind of devil if one can chase 10,000 a 100,000 ought to be running tonight if he can get you in his grip but that's the secret isn't it if he can get you in his grip if he can get let get you to let go of this and let go of that and Just Surrender yourself amen remember a little my little sermon the other day my mini sermon this is kind of this what we're speaking of Amen let him go let go how many know in this world and in this life and in this Christian walk there's a lot of things that you got to let go you got to let your past go you got to let those who offend you and your past offensive you got to let all that go it's pretty tough because how many knows if you don't let go God can't use you you got to let go of your own abilities you got to let go of your own mind you got to let go of your own thoughts your own Ambitions your own goals you got to let go of your own life you got to let go of everything and say God I surrender all to you he that forsakes not all you got to let go of it all for God all of your plans you got to let go of your your pleasure life your leisure life you got to let go of of whatever it might be let God be in control you got a business you got to let go and let God have it let God rule we got to let go so much until you can't plan on going and uh brother Joel going somewhere and I got a whole junkyard that I'm going to buy in there tomorrow I'm going to go there and buy it no Bible says the Lord willing we'll go to do this that or the other you're going to go buy some Timber you're going to go do this you're going to do that no yeah let go of yourself and say Lord willing we're going to do this why because you're under God now anden he has you in his hand oh can I just say what comes to mind what kind of worship would we have what kind of Praise would we have if you just let go and not be all stiff and starchy oh man I believe we'd have a whole lot more amens we'd have more praise the Lord you ain't going to bother me a bit if you say amen and Hallelujah amen I'll probably say louder than what you are so you are not going to drop me out Glory releasing the power of God but already said it's like having an ocean up there amen the size of that light ball of water coming down amen let's get a bigger pipe let's open her up how many is with me let's open her up let go let go let it flow down through here oh they used to have Pentecostal meetings they used to have preachers used to preach amen until they buckle down in the knees Plum time preaching everybody glory to God coming back up SP catching their breath huh where's those days at amen oh don't get me going where's the people used to walk the AES and tears come down the eyes people stand up raise their hands and praise the Lord where's those things at oh there in the days going by those days are gone like them trees that were all dead up there in the mountains isn't that right all them dead trees the wind blowing through it days of Miracles is passed we don't shout anymore like that that preacher is too fanatical we better get us one that don't quite get down on us quite as hard huh there's no more Holy Ghost no but down underneath some underbrush how much underbrush do we got tonight amen them little leaves were just clapping their hands they were just clapping their hands W Lorry we got life in us that's right praise the Lord let the peace of God rule what's ruling in your heart fear anxiety doubt I can't do it I'm not a very good Christian huh I'm backslid I sined I'm filled and I'm not worthy those are all the devil's words amen how many believe you got to talk God's language I'm a Christian I'm save God has forgiven me I'm strong in faith I can more than able to do it you're more than able I guess you might call it self-esteem but you got to have a little self-esteem you just esteem yourself nothing well you've met people I'm just nothing I'm just nobody and I Ain never you know amount of much no you probably won't not if you keep thinking like that amen no amen but so what I want to say is it's not so much it's not so important what you got in your hand amen but it's important whether God has you in his hand I believe brother Brandon preached a message called what is that in your hand David that right what is that in your hand what was it a little sling just a little sling it's all David had he didn't have much brother Braham says well I people think well I can't barely sing a song or I can't barely do this that or the other whatever it is that God has given you go out there and use it let God get behind it and it'll become a lot a little as a a lot when God is in it that little sling meant a lot it become a whole Mighty it might as well up in an atomic bomb for that g it didn't matter what he had a great big long sword a matter what he had David didn't need one of these big machines that threw Fireballs no he just needed a little SL and God that's all he needed to be in the hands of God he can bring the giant down I'm here to tell you if you'll surrender yourself Amen to God God will bring every Giant in your life down God will use you to Kill Devils he'll use you to get rid of lukewarmness God's going to use somebody to bring us to a Rapture Amen to a body change amen he's going to use somebody do you believe you're going to be that one person that he's going to use amen amen I'm believing we're all going to go but if only one's going to El out of Elton or Lewisburg me and you going to fight we going to fight we're going to argue we're going to have have a dis dis a disagreement you say you're going I'm going say no I'm going let me just kind of check that the Holy Spirit kind of brought that check me I'm not going to tell you no sister Hannah no I'm just going to say well that's wonderful but I know one thing I'm going cuz I want you to go and I'm not going to say no you ain't going to go hello no cuz I want you to go amen but I believe that God it doesn't matter I'm going only one going out Elon and I'm going too you know the good part sister Hannah I don't live in Elon so one can go from Elon one can go from Lewisburg sorry guys she spoke up first you ought to be quicker to preach amen the preacher amen but that's all good isn't it that's what he said that's Prophet taught us you have to believe and have enough self-esteem to believe you're the one that's going amen I got a little more I might as well go ahead and go a little more this road would that be okay I'm I'm going to come down here here brother Glenn you come on my mind when I was studying this let me let me say something first of all one of the ways to release the power of God is your confession or profession how many knows he's the high priest of your profession brother Bram said that's the confession to confession is to say what he says now how many knows that before you confess something you have to let go of something brother Tommy if we have a diff differences and we had a bad falling out we had this that or the other amen and before we can never be friends again somebody's got to confess if we're mad at each other we ain't no it was Tommy no it was Tommy no it was Tommy huh ain't nothing going to be released under those conditions but when I say predat Tommy I believe man I should have done a little different than that I'm sorry it was my fault how many notice there's power that comes with that you're letting go of that you're admitting to the truth that's what we got to do to the word of God conf uh admit to God's word confess his word he says that by your his stripes you were healed amen the work was done on Calvary you better start talking his language make a confession and it'll release the power of God in your life but B says you'll never get nothing until you confess that he's already done it it's already done it's already done it's already done I'm already raptured it's already done before it's ever going to happen you're going to have to believe that it is butam says Abraham we're a type of Abraham and Sarah Abraham was turned back to a young man again if I'm not wrong brother bandam Illustrated it one morning Sarah said to Abraham Abraham your hair you don't have any gray hair anymore your gray hair is gone is that right so brother Glenn I was going to say do you see my hair is there less gray hair boy we messed up on that one brother Glenn why do we got to confess before we ever get [Laughter] it oh my confession right how about them wrinkles under my eyes are they a little better or worse but that's a little safer but what is it how many believe that if that's true that we're like Abraham and one of these days he's going to so before it happens even before we see it we're going to see it yeah I'm seeing it I see it by faith brother by faith you see amen my hair is getting blacker amen I'm getting stronger I'm going to turn right back into a 20-year old man like I was in 20s this guy's going to change me back how many believes that but before it happens you better start confessing I believe I'm going to be in that Rapture so look in the mirror brother Glenn yeah hey look in the mirror brother Glenn keep looking for them Heritage to come back to you they're going to come back you ain't lost to one okay all right couldn't believe it finally you realize but I me please that's right every I don't care if you're gray or if you're bald God's got those hairs one of these days they're all going to come back amen but how many believes before there's a physical change before there's a physical change there has to be a spiritual change on the inside we have to come to what the word said that we're going to be amen I want to tell you something this more this this evening how many beli it's time for the word to jump off the tapes and the books amen into hearts into lives and comes into manifestation that's what it's time for I believe it were here you're you're seeing it happening in me it's happening folks it's becoming real the word coming off of here into me why come unto me in other words ye who are weary and heavy laden cast your cares upon me let go of your cares and cast them on me for he cares for me he cares for you cast all of your burdens cast all of your weariness cast all of your gift cast all of those things away come to him praise the Lord am mean I thought that was a good Revelation you see it it's all right brother Joe go up the folk hey you see my hair coming back no oh well they're gonna they're going to you see me get young again I don't care how old you are brother Glenn you're going to get young again I'm going to have Spirit I'm going to have to have spiritual Revelation to probably know who you are CU how many knows we change a lot now I'm sure y'all have seen that on YouTube different places of where they put these movie stars of when they were young and then all of a sudden they look like some old hag this is terrible then even brother B says I don't care how handsome you are how strong you are how PR you're going to shrivel up and die that's right that's where you all end up at but guess what it don't matter because we got another place that we're going to amen so we got to have what I call John Ryan Faith common Faith just believe it God said it that's settles it see folks have a hard time brother Brandon preached a message on enticing Spirits this is where uh most of my my my thoughts came from amen how do you let go so many people are wondering today saying well brother bandam how do you let go cuz see a lot of people were trying to just let go people want to try to speak in tongues they want to let God let go and let God have his wonderful way amen you know you heard a lot of theology on it let go a lot of people just work up a sweat trying to let go Oh my he says many people come around to I'll go on a 40-day fast so I can do something you don't need a 40-day fast what you need to do is let go of the world and all these devilish things and take God's word in your heart you got to be taught how to do it you don't do it by jumping up and down neither do you do it by 40-day fast you do it by a surrendered heart to almighty God glory how many believes it's about surrendering to almighty God so that he can use you like a little baby or a child I would have said when you're trying to dress them when they're real small you try to put that coat on is that right sister Serenity knows some of our sister knows when you're trying to put a something on that baby it'll just pull that arm back got to pull that thing back and try to get that thing on pull it back and put it on ain't that right young children sometimes before they really know how to dress you gotta just hold still hold still and let me do it Mom grabs the arm puts it in there ain't that right that's right mother's trying to put that little Jack on him this morning he wanted to get this little old arm in his sleeve he can't put it in there he don't know how he says you've got to guide his little arm he wants to get his arm but he just keeps beating all around and he never gets into sleeve amen that's the way we are about amen oh we want to see God do this we want to see that but sometimes we just we're fighting too much we're struggling too much we're trying too hard we're not just surrendering to God say God dress me God clothes me cuz when God does it boy it's going to be done so much better how many believe that try to put his arm in he's got to have someone to direct him how to put it arm in and when he gets his arm in his little jacket he knows it's all right amen people might struggle they might fight they might battle who was it buddy Robinson I guess it was or one of them I believe it was I believe it was him that was out plowing ain't that right he was out PL plowing and he always his mules would always act up and he beat him and everything else one time the mule acted up and he went up and bit his ear didn't he pulled a Mike Tyson on him bite your ear off I can't beat you I'll bite you amen then he got down and apologized and said God I'm in cornfield and if you don't if you don't give me the Holy Ghost had to battle out had to struggle it out and that right struggle but just learn to release to God Amen and finally when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh my how wonderful it is before I read the rest of this quote let me read you this one now you just got your ups and downs and ups and down I would advise you to go to God stay there until you're really born again when trials and troubles and heartaches and disappointments set in something holds amen not you holding something holding you see it isn't a question whether I held or not it's a question whether he held or not it isn't looking at me it's looking at him he's the one a man came not long ago said brother brand I'm not worthy to be saved I said no you're right you're not he just started weeping he said ' I've tried since 1940 to get saved he said but I can't find myself worthy huh folks will do this they'll go on 45 day fast they'll try to do this they'll try to do that to get worthy no you'll never work yourself worthy you ain't got to crawl on your knees so far you ain't got to beat yourself on the back like a lot of them will still do today trying to find God thinking that by whooping themselves buddy you just whooped yourself in vain huh cuz he is already worthy it's already there he's the worthy one wo he says that's the way is with every born again Christian when he really gets in wait a minute wrong story all right you really he says you'll never be worthy he says then I can never be saved see if we could ever get the scare out of the people that's something oh don't know uh you're wanting a little uh touch me uh lay your hands on me Hocus Pocus he says God's word is your basis God's word is your basis how many believes if a sinner uh hotting uh out in Africa somewhere get a hold of a Bible amen he he would read John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten said whosoever if that boy genuine I believe that's what God Said that boy can get saved that girl can get saved right there right then ain't got to pray long ain't got to do all that Just Surrender and just believe what God said because if you'll believe what God said you're ready suring your will your ideas on God's basis I like that that's part of our sermon tonight God said so just lay there out there perfect that's right that's where we believe it see it's not nothing or if I can do this or that or that this or that or the other it's not what you done it's what God has done for you oh my people say oh if I could just keep holding on now how many knows in life there's a time to hold on Amen and one of the hold on is your faith you hold on to faith Paul says I have finished I have finished a fight I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith that right we call it the fight of Faith the real fight the real battle is in that faith because if thou can't believe all things possible see the battle is in your unbelief and the between B uh unbelief and Faith now notice Keep Holding On It ain't you holding on it's whether he held on or not it ain't what I am it's what he is what he presented represented in me me he said God don't see me as I am if I'm in Christ he sees Christ he don't see me no more for I'm dead and my life is hid in Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord and he goes to S speaking and he explained it to the man he says oh I see he understood it's not about you trying to be worthy because you'll never be worthy it's about accepting what he has done already it's about what his word has said remember that common hiss of faith that I was talking about am me brother I call it John Ryan Faith because John Ryan he he he went out there confessing thank thank God for my healing thank God for my healing is't that right and he did it for a few days and it never happened and he got back into prayer line didn't he he says it didn't happen and so forth and and God says don't you believe me he say yes I believe me I believe you then why are you doubting go out there and confess he went out there amen and have no doubt but all he had is confession he confessed confessed believed and confess it and then of course his eyes come popped open I mean know that's the way we do take God's word into your heart and watch God make a revelation out of that make it quick to your life but you've got to take it on the inside here first and believe it with all of your heart amen just that common Faith amen and whenever God comes down and does something for you I mean knows after that then you're not more your own anymore it's not about you folks we like to brag about our faith the mountains we've moved and and and the people were healed and everything else under their prayer let me tell you something it's all belongs to Jesus Christ ain't a good thing about any of us except for the Christ that's on the inside of us how many of know amen listen to this so he says after he gets that jacket on you he says that's the way it is with every born again Christian amen when he really gets God into God he watches his life with God's word and he realizes he's lined up with every bit of it he's got long suffering and gentleness and quietness and meekness and Fa power and faith and love and joy and peace he ain't tossed about like a troubl se he ain't worried about every little thing W Glory how many's glad that amen when you let go of yourself and committed yourself to God God takes care of you you ain't got to worry about everything let me tell you something how many people this evening would like to stay looking young remember the lady brother B met in the little store amen and she was 60 years old and he he got to talking to her and said you look 30 she don't 30 that she says I learned amen that when I got born again I commit my case to God I let go of all my cases and I commited to God Amen if he can't take care of it ain't no worry about no sense in me worrying about it oh my when you live like that in the peace of God rules in your heart that no matter what comes you committed to God and said you oh God's going to deal with it how many believe you God fights your battles for you but where does he do it at in your heart in your life that's where he fights it that how many knows we are God's Victory we are God's Victory oh I'm not very much I'm all defeated no you're not you're Victorious I'm an overcomer you're an overcomer amen you can shout and dance with the Overcomers you're not defeated you're an overcomer you're triumphant you're blessed you're Victorious everything belongs to you that every promise in the book is mine nothing's impossible with me nothing's impossible with you why that's what he said we say oh I can't do it I don't know if I got the faith that's what the devil tries to tell you that's what he uses your flesh to tell you isn't that what he told Moses Moses was telling himself oh I can't do it huh but he could it God didn't like his confession did he he saidwell who makes the mouth I'm the one that makes the mouth to speak amen praise be to God oh couldn't Moses have uh been have anxiety couldn't he have fear why my goodness wake up in the morning he say really this this today I got to go face pharaoh and I'm supposed to get in front of him and tell him to let everybody go I don't know if I can do this huh every thought that you could possibly imagine might have went through his mind but it doesn't record it does it no because after the backside of the desert experience he mounted the donkey took his wife and his child amen and everybody passed by he says Hey I'm going down to Egypt to take over he had a little positive he had a little self-esteem he was positive I'mma take over brother B said he's they say all said he's probably a boy he's a little bit old you know you got to just Overlook that stuff huh but no he went there met him and faced him why because he was going to the hands of God I mean believe the bride is in the hands of God that's not good enough let's make it more personal you you you you you you you you're in the hands of God not just the bride overall but make it personal it's wonderful to say the bride no I'm part of that bride you're part part of that bride and you're going to be without spot you're going to be without wrinkle cuz God said so I believe it and that settles it thank you Jesus let's get the Holy Ghost a good hand Holy Spirit you're welcome him come down over the audience right now [Applause] amen amen praise be to God God is good ain't he amen my my that's right I can't preach it all to you so I got to decide which one I tell which one I want to do so listen I love it I love the thought of God holding on to me God holding on to you every trial that you've ever went through everything you've ever experienced every deep valley and you look back at it and if you look at it correctly you can say no I didn't hold on he held on to me if that don't do something to us I don't know what will he held on to me he would not let me go amen Mercy said no I'm never going to let you go that's what we could about brother Glenn we might fail but he's never going to fail we will fail we'll backslide but he's never going to fail amen folks I'm here to tell you if you backslide you do something that you're wrong you say that's a lie I repent and that's a lie that ain't nothing but a trip over to the devil I'm Victorious and I accept God's grace God forgive me and go on get right back up get back up so quick the enemy the bar can see that you was down amen and got to knocking him out some more cuz that is what the punch of the devil is amen when you get back upen and say are you kidding that all you got I'm just getting started I don't know I'm going to get a little personal but when we was going me and my wife this church we was going through our great great trials deep dark Valley I was fighting many devils discouragements and everything else and I felt like this I felt like I was fighting the devil and a bunch of demons that were trying to get on me with one hand behind my back one hand behind my back wounded limping down and anything I just have to F fight with one arm just fight them Devils with one arm fight with everything I got and I realize it was God Amen but I said to myself wait till I get this arm out wait we ain't even started yet amen can I tell you something we're going good now we're started and we're going to give the devil what he deserves we're going to give him all we got and that's him more of God God less of me I empty myself God take and take every devil out of this church amen don't let one demon come in here why is all these why is all these attacks that's coming Upon Us brother John and the other brother John and different things and different you know butam said anytime there's a Revival amen anytime there was ever Revival amen there's also a lot of demon activity amen that goes on and rs them up amen and they hit anything they possibly can but we got the power of the Holy Ghost amen and we will conquer every devil amen this is the time to receive the Holy Ghost this is the time to raise up all of our feet and say I want more of God and I'm going to let go of everything let him F me I'm Healed brother John you're healed brother John that ain't nothing but a liying symptom amen oh it'll cause him to get stirred up try to come out of his dormant spot ain't that right try to not be dormant but we rebuke him in Jesus name go back to hell where you come from amen we enforce it in the name of Jesus not our own name Devils of cancer we rebuke it in Jesus name get out of this building high blood pressure get out of this building diabetes get on out of here this ain't the place for you this is God's house these are God's people Freedom Reigns here Joy Reigns here love Reigns here goodness Mercy longsuffering generous rules at evening light Tabernacle let his peace rule I like it when his love rules I won't read it all but brother Bram talking about his wife when he was holding Billy Paul and they were putting hope down in the grave she was being buried they heard the clots of the dirt hit in the casket cl cl Billy Paul mama mama mama baby crying for its Mama being buried almost more than brother could be very hard very very sad time for him is't that right very sad time amen we all know what the devil did when little Sharon Rose was passing God was asking God to spare the little baby little child spare the black sheet just come in front of him God refused him God didn't hear him and the devil says see he's look what kind of God he is amen he didn't try to tell him there was no God say God he knew there was already God but that he didn't care didn't love like he should the devil tried to tell him if that's how God's going to be then is't that right amen that's many times where we come to in those low spots in those places where it dividing line of whether you're holding on to this or whether he's holding on to this woo how many of us tonight can say I'm sitting here because he held on we have no brag about no I did that no God held on to me he held on to you that's why you are sitting where you are that's why you are looking at the manifestation of God Amen that can hold a person through no matter what you go through that can bring joy unspeakable and full of the glory but you got to get Lord let go to pass you can't have any anything and hold on to nothing except to him amen I'm GNA read part of it because I thought it was so good about a few weeks afterwards I couldn't get over it I went back to work about a month or two I was going up the road I had my hands behind me my old pair of boots on I couldn't go home I couldn't go anywhere my heart was broke the state senator of Indiana Mr eer come to my church and I was going walking up the road like that and I heard a little old truck coming I looked around he stoed jumped stopped jumped out run over there and he put his arm around me and cry he said Billy how are you doing I said Mr eer you know how I'm feeling said I want to ask you one thing solemnly Billy I said all right ask me Mr Eiser said what do you think about the Lord Jesus now after taking your baby your wife everything you had a 20 some years old young man love of his life his first love how many knows that's a special love that's right should be the only love that you have amen what do you think about after everything he had I turned around looked at him took him by the hand looked him in the eye said Miss Senator I want to tell you something he's more than life to me me he said do you love him I said with all my heart with all my soul and with all my strength after taking your baby and wife I said though he would send me to hell if there's such a thing as I could love him there I would love him amen what shall separate us from the love of God I mean believe that's what happens when you get born again you fall in love with almighty God and he loves you ain't that right and if it wouldn't have been for the grace of almighty God another time they asked him he said you know he did you hold your religion during that time he says no it held me how many realize it was that Holy Spirit it was that holding of him that in the time that he might have said if God how God's going to be but it changed ain't that right oh how many knows that it wasn't job that held on it was God in Job that hold held on to him during his trial during his test job you I none of us could ever make it most carnal people that they go through trials like that they would forsake God they'll quit church quit church for a lot less than that why somebody tell something bad about them or do something oh boy I hope people are listening something go wrong in the church they're gone what have you ever had a real trial real test how many knows that when you come to church you got to learn to get along with people you got to overlook their faults you got to be able to forgive their sins and failures cuz this is the front line amen they we not perfect we're all human beings we all make mistakes you got to overlook your pastor and his mistakes in order to sit there and listen to him y'all know all my faults y'all know my failures I know you do yall know my past yall know things I've done wrong you've got to get past that don't you that's exactly I I ain't never said that before now have I that's a new one brother Tommy but that's the truth and it's a little bit the other way anything we you've ever done I got to forgive see I don't it's all going amen and now we can hug each other and love each other and say brother you're my brother you're my sister we are going forward we don't care what the devil tries to do [Applause] amen I don't know what you came to do but I came to praise the Lord amen you love him I get so caught up I don't know where my second set of eyes are all right we got 20 after let's give me another 10 minutes okay aren't you glad he held on oh my we're so grateful for that aren't we I haven't got to read any of my quotes hardly but maybe a couple here listen enticing Spirits versus the word of God let loose let go how do you do it brother Brandon just let go that's all you got to do take God's word let go of everything else just believe God's word that's how you do it amen because he was dealing with a lot of Pentecostals who them Jump Around D speaking they they try to work up something that's why he said bad there I'm sweating but I'm not trying to work nothing up I'm not trying to let loose they would they do all of those things trying to let go let go a shelf and let the Holy Spirit Come perhaps and speak in time but that's not it he said you don't have to work up a sweat to let go all you got to do is let go and let God have his wonderful way how many believes after this Wednesday night hopefully tomorrow you'll be a different person wherever you are even listening to this you'll be different because you're learning to let go of yourself there's so many things we could go over yourself and everything about yourself has to be gone and you are God's Property and you are in his hands that's right don't try to work nothing up don't get down here at the altar and beat on it and holler God give me the Holy Ghost Lord give me the Holy Ghost he ain't coming you beating on the altar that don't do no good that ain't the way it comes it t taking him at his word he said many times yeah you come you come you repent say God I'm sorry for my sins amen but if you don't accept the pardon say I accept Lord I believe that you've forgiven me I accept your forgiveness and I believe you'll fill me again with the Holy Ghost there's be a time otherwise you'll stay there and the devil keep making you doubt because why you're waiting on some great feeling well I want the Great feeling you don't get it by feeling you get it by Faith by taking God at his word amen Peter brother says while he was on the trouble see they were fixing the die Jesus come on the water is that right he said Lord if that be you uh bit me come to you the Lord said come on Peter now he said he didn't say wait Lord let me go on a 40-day fast see if I can walk on that water or not let me get enough Spirit on me that I can dance in the spirit and speak in tongues in this boat then I'll step out no sir he took him at his word w how many believe there is nothing more powerful than taking him at his word they fished all night they fished all night but they caught no fishes fished all night but they caught no fishes amen next morning Jesus said you know cast your nets on the other side we ain't caught a thing they said but at Thy word we're going to do it amen I don't care if you don't see anybody Fe anybody or whatever it is God said it I believe it at Thy word we'll do it praise be to God all right let me just take this last quote let's talk about who's the most powerful let's talk about dancing in the spirit screaming running whatever it might be who's more powerful what's real power you know people want power and they don't really know what power is they don't know what goes with it see the way up is down if you want Power see how humble you can get get away in that let go of all of your worldly thinking I'm here to tell you folks just since I have I've absolutely committed myself to keeping my mind on God it's been a big change for me try it if you want it but I advise you to try it a little more I don't care if you're putting Rafters up I don't care if you're putting ceiling joists up I don't care if you're putting walls up I don't care if you're manuring the dogs know word cleaning out the cages no matter what you're doing driving down the road is one of the special times isn't it when you can turn some good music on and think about the Lord woo you get sing as loud as you want you won't wife won't hold her ears huh just a good Tim in the Lord changes you what did Brother bam says you want more power change your thinking get rid of your old thinking and I anybody listening to this listen see how committed to God you are there's nothing like not no God can't can't can't use anybody that's not 100% committ Comm it to him he'll just use you a little bit he God wants a 100% commitment out of every part of your life not just sometimes not just Sundays not just this area or that area every area of your life if you are a child of God you will line want to line up with what God s that's surrendered that's committed to God and then you watch God use you get rid of of your own abilities your own thinking if you really want God to use you I don't know about you but I want to be used by God don't you amen listen to this see how get away from all of your worldly thinking and hum yourself before God and then you got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a whole lot of noise I make a bunch of noise hello listen to this makes a whole lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself how many knows the biggest enemy that we have is you you are the biggest enemy you are the biggest plug in this hydrant of the power of God is ourself not your preacher not your neighbor not your mom not your dad not your B don't blame anybody else you are Your Own Worst Enemy and if you can conquer yourself if you can absolutely submit yourself yield cuz how many know yielding is letting go just like like confession is Letting Go amen yield to him and commit yourself to him if you can commit yourself to him you'll have more power than people some people that run all over the place amen oh my I didn't get it did I okay I had another good quote foram talked about I'll go ahead and say it since it's coming talked about he says some people can run all all over the building shout and scream and dance in the spirit like you ain't never seen go out there and have hatred and Malice say something in the church and cause the church to be broke up he says that ain't nothing but demon power whoa why you might dance in spirit you might do it all but what do you do out there what kind of words come out of your mouth are they uplifting are they damaging what are they if they're damaging and tearing people apart and gossiping everything you've got to devil on you it's the sulfuric demon acid amen I thought that was good Lord help us not to be that way amen say good things about each other uplift each other praise the Lord now 8:30 One More Story One More Story Paul Raider I love the story of Paul Raider is that right he was a missionary to Africa he got way back there in the jungles and got some kind of a malaria or whatever and he was
