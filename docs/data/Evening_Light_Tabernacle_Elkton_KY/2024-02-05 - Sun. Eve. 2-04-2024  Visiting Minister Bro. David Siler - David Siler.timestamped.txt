[16:22] Master how do you believe that God
[16:24] orchestrates
[16:26] things even when it comes to the s of
[16:30] songs well the Lord laid this message on
[16:33] my heart earlier in the week to speak to
[16:37] you today and I want to speak on that
[16:38] song we just sang tonight Matthew
[16:41] Chapter 14 verse
[16:43] 22 I believe our God is so mindful of us
[16:46] Matthew
[16:49] 14:22 me and your song leader didn't get
[16:53] together to make sure that happened but
[16:56] I believe we serve the same God don't
[16:58] you
[16:59] Matthew
[17:01] 14:22 I just love when the Lord puts
[17:03] things together and validates what he's
[17:07] placed on your
[17:08] heart whenever he had started the
[17:11] service with that song the Master of the
[17:13] wind I thought how perfect they singing
[17:16] that song tonight and then whenever he
[17:18] gets ready to call me out he could not
[17:22] said a better tongue Matthew
[17:26] 14:22 straightway Jesus strangest
[17:29] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[17:32] before him to the other side while he
[17:35] sent the multitudes away and when he had
[17:37] sent the multitudes away he went up into
[17:40] a mountain part to pray and when the
[17:43] evening was come he was there alone but
[17:47] the ship was now in the midst of the sea
[17:51] tossed with waves for the wind was
[17:53] contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the
[17:56] night Jesus went into to them walking on
[17:59] the sea and when the disciples saw him
[18:02] walking on the sea they were troubled
[18:04] saying it's a spirit and they cried out
[18:07] for fear but straight way Jesus spake un
[18:11] them saying hallelujah be a good cheer
[18:16] it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered
[18:20] him and said Lord if it be thou bid me
[18:25] come unto thee on the water and he said
[18:28] said not 75 scriptures not 150 quotes
[18:31] one word and he said come and when Peter
[18:35] was come down out of the ship look at
[18:38] your Bible when he come down out of the
[18:40] ship he walked on the water to go meet
[18:45] Jesus amen let's buy our hearts tonight
[18:48] ask the Lord to come and help us now
[18:50] Heavenly Father we just believe tonight
[18:52] Lord that you have orchestrated this
[18:55] moment and this time and Lord Lord I
[18:58] just pray Lord for the things that we
[19:01] have upon our heart tonight that you
[19:02] would just help me Lord that I can yield
[19:05] to your presence that you could just
[19:06] come speak these things to us Lord we
[19:09] believe that you are so mindful of our
[19:12] needs and Lord we thank you that you're
[19:14] so faithful Lord to everything in our
[19:17] lives Lord whatever need we would have
[19:19] whatever would come up you're so
[19:21] faithful to provide and tonight Lord for
[19:23] the preaching of the word may you come
[19:25] once again as we pull our chairs your
[19:28] table Lord we come we're hungry tonight
[19:32] we desire something from your presence
[19:34] something from your word may we be
[19:36] edified Lord by our high have your way
[19:39] in this place and we'll give you the
[19:41] Praise In The Name Of The Lord Jesus
[19:43] Christ and everybody said amen God bless
[19:46] you tonight you can be seated praise the
[19:49] lord well that's certainly wonderful to
[19:53] um see the way this has come together
[19:56] now it makes me a lot less nervous
[19:58] knowing that the Lord's truly behind
[20:01] this I'm going to speak to you tonight
[20:04] on something really strange something
[20:07] really odd and I want to take this
[20:09] tonight to kind of um give us some
[20:12] direction for a while I believe that the
[20:15] L Lord is directing us to as his
[20:18] children we know that we're living in a
[20:21] time period today when our faith is
[20:23] going to be tested more than it's ever
[20:25] been tested before and we know I belief
[20:28] what we stand upon what we believe the
[20:31] principles of what we believe it's going
[20:33] to have all kinds of opposition that's
[20:36] going to come against it and we know
[20:38] that Satan has sent every demon out of
[20:41] hell to come against the bride in this
[20:44] last day he has sent every disease at
[20:47] his disposal every weapon that he has he
[20:50] has sent everything that he has to try
[20:53] to upset the plan of God for this day
[20:56] and he's actually not just coming
[20:58] against the world though we know that
[20:59] they are affected by this too but he's
[21:02] affecting you and I as the children of
[21:03] God and we see that we see termoil
[21:06] everywhere we look we see turmoil in the
[21:09] world we see Church turmoil trouble
[21:11] stress sickness problems everywhere we
[21:14] look and that's why I'd like to speak on
[21:16] this subject tonight to kind of help
[21:18] your faith just for a few minutes but I
[21:21] want to make a statement No don't throw
[21:23] me out till we get done tonight but I
[21:25] want to make this statement to you and
[21:27] it's want to be real strange but I would
[21:30] personally like to have the ability to
[21:33] walk on
[21:36] water I know
[21:39] oh Lord what kind of a nut we got
[21:41] preaching
[21:42] tonight I would love to have the ability
[21:45] to be able to walk on water now you
[21:48] might think that that's crazy why in the
[21:50] world would any man want to possess the
[21:53] ability to be able to walk on water but
[21:57] understand and I'm not talking about a
[22:00] river I'm not talking about a lake I'm
[22:03] not talking about a pond I'm talking
[22:05] about life in many different places the
[22:07] prophet tells us that life is like a sea
[22:10] and brother Rim said a sea is always
[22:13] unstable that it always has the ability
[22:16] to be connected to the weather that no
[22:18] matter however much the wind would blow
[22:20] that the sea becomes unstable whenever
[22:23] the wind blows and we know that the
[22:25] prophet tells us that not only is the
[22:28] see unstable but life itself it is
[22:30] unstable it's uncertain it's always
[22:33] moving it's always being
[22:35] tsed about it's always being tossed to
[22:38] and fro and brother said that life is
[22:40] like the storms that comes upon a sea
[22:43] and he said when the wind whips upon
[22:45] that sea and as it comes across the top
[22:47] of that water it changes the condition
[22:49] of the water and it causes the sea to
[22:52] become unstable and we know that's a
[22:54] type of the age that we're living in
[22:57] that this is an age AG of uncertainty as
[22:59] a matter of fact whenever David
[23:01] described it in the Book of Psalms
[23:03] chapter 27 that David said that we are
[23:05] living in a time of trouble brother and
[23:08] sister how true is
[23:10] that today that there has never been
[23:13] trouble like there is today and I want
[23:15] to say this tonight that we cannot
[23:18] expect for the Seas to remain calm we
[23:20] can't expect for the waters to remain
[23:23] calm you cannot expect the days of calm
[23:25] Waters is over the days of the Seas
[23:28] being leveled out those days is done as
[23:31] a matter of fact it's going to get worse
[23:34] and worse and worse as more as the signs
[23:37] of the end time begins to unfold and the
[23:40] governments are contrary one to another
[23:42] people are contrary one to another the
[23:45] waters are going to continue to get
[23:47] worse and more rough and more rough more
[23:50] tumultous than what they ever have been
[23:52] and people themselves the prophet tells
[23:55] us towards the end are going to go
[23:57] completely in Saye all I can say is we
[23:59] have a right when you don't know what
[24:01] you are you don't know what a man is you
[24:03] don't know what a woman is I can
[24:05] honestly say that tells me we have lost
[24:08] our minds we have went completely insane
[24:11] when people today and because of the
[24:13] uncertainty amongst the people what's it
[24:15] do it puts pressure on our homes
[24:17] pressure on our minds pressure on our
[24:19] jobs and the thing of it is it's because
[24:22] the world has went in to this chaotic
[24:24] condition to where the waters are so
[24:26] rough that no nobody knows where to turn
[24:29] psychiatrist are trying to find
[24:31] psychiatrist and the doctors don't have
[24:33] the answer and they tell us that they
[24:34] don't have the answer and certainly our
[24:36] governments don't have the answer the
[24:38] pope don't have the answer the doctors
[24:40] of divinity theologians they don't
[24:43] understand it because there's trouble
[24:44] everywhere we look trouble in our nation
[24:47] troubles everywhere that we look at
[24:49] that's the reason why tonight I tell you
[24:52] I want the ability to be able to walk on
[24:55] the water I want to the ability to be
[24:58] able to walk over it I don't want to be
[25:00] like the rest of the world that s sinks
[25:03] in Despair and the depravity of the
[25:06] world but I want to have the ability to
[25:08] be able to walk over trouble to walk
[25:11] over stress to walk over sicknesses to
[25:13] walk over diseases if I can't stop the
[25:16] waves from coming and I can't stop the
[25:18] waters becoming tumult us and we can't
[25:21] stop the storms coming up I want to have
[25:23] the ability to walk on what other people
[25:26] sink in now I'm not going to ask God and
[25:29] you and I realize we cannot ask God God
[25:32] calling the waters for
[25:33] [Music]
[25:35] us Lord give us a little bit more time
[25:37] and Lord give the waters a little bit of
[25:39] a break and let it calm down a little
[25:41] bit listen friends why in the world do
[25:43] we need the waters to stop when we got a
[25:46] God that has the ability to give you
[25:48] that strength to walk upon the waters I
[25:51] don't want to be tossed around like the
[25:53] rest of the world I don't want to be
[25:55] tossed around and have so much
[25:57] uncertainty de mind I want to walk on
[26:00] the water I want to walk on it why sink
[26:02] to the bottom when you got the power to
[26:05] be able to walk on the water when you
[26:07] serve a god that is a creator of the
[26:09] water and a creator of the heavens and
[26:11] he's a creator of the earth why seek
[26:14] when your God has given you the
[26:16] authority like Peter that you can walk
[26:18] on the water why put up with when you
[26:21] can walk over it and that's our setting
[26:24] tonight our scene opens up upon the Sea
[26:27] of gilee and it's a tremendous
[26:30] time now because remember the prophet
[26:32] tells us whenever the disciples is going
[26:34] to cross this water as our brother just
[26:36] sang and he tells us that as the boat
[26:38] comes upon the Water he said notice that
[26:41] Jesus is sending them to the other
[26:46] side so see but I want to remind you we
[26:49] didn't go on our own we didn't start
[26:52] this walk on Upon Our Own but it is the
[26:54] Lord that is commissioned us and has
[26:57] commed commissioned us to cross the sea
[26:59] [Music]
[27:02] so if he's told me to go the way through
[27:05] and here
[27:07] the disciples are in this boat they've
[27:10] been here all night now think about this
[27:13] it is the darkest time of the night it
[27:16] is the fourth watch Being divided into
[27:19] the watches it is the fourth watch of
[27:21] theight so they're Tire they're wore out
[27:24] I'm preaching to you right now you get
[27:26] tired you get weary in the fourth watch
[27:29] in the darkest age in the darkest hour
[27:31] when it looks like there ain't nobody
[27:32] going to be able to make it in the
[27:34] Fourth Watch of the night it is the
[27:36] darkest time and the darkest hour and
[27:39] here comes the storm against God's
[27:41] people now let me say this this storm
[27:44] ain't just against anybody but the
[27:46] biggest part of this storm is trying to
[27:48] upset the elect that is in this boat
[27:50] trying to cross the waters the ones that
[27:54] Jesus loves the one that Jesus cares of
[27:57] about and here is Satan coming against
[28:00] his elect here he is coming against his
[28:02] Chosen and now God now remember the
[28:05] prophet tells us that Jesus was not out
[28:07] on the water but he had climbed up to
[28:10] the highest hill and he said he'd been
[28:12] watching that boat out of upon that sea
[28:14] let me just tell you you may not see him
[28:16] nowhere around you you may not feel him
[28:18] nowhere around you but the prophet said
[28:20] his eye is always on you and he's always
[28:23] watching he's always looking he's always
[28:26] mindful of it
[28:30] Here Comes This Storm this storm is not
[28:33] Jesus testing them this storm is not
[28:36] Jesus trying them to see where their
[28:39] faith is at he's not trying to see how
[28:41] much Faith they got but the prophet
[28:42] tells us in the message of perfect Faith
[28:44] where the Storm come from he said this
[28:47] storm come up because of the devil and
[28:49] he said here is Satan trying to take
[28:52] advantage of these disciples because he
[28:54] sees them in the Ship Without Jesus so
[28:57] he was waiting for the moment he was
[28:59] looking for the time that Jesus ain't in
[29:01] the boat and now he sees him on the sea
[29:04] and they're all by their C there is no
[29:07] Jesus that's going to put his foot on
[29:08] the bow of the boat he's not in the ship
[29:11] and Satan but tells us that Satan is
[29:13] sending this storm and he said here is
[29:16] what Satan's doing he's got a demon on
[29:19] every way he said he's got a demon of
[29:21] Doubt on every wave and he said this
[29:24] next wave I'm going to take him out this
[29:26] next wave is going to sink the
[29:29] ship and Jesus is watching over all of
[29:32] it so they're crossing the sea the
[29:36] waters are so choppy the waters are so
[29:39] rough and the prophet tells us they got
[29:42] scared now you realize we look at that
[29:45] and we think why would they be scared
[29:47] did they not see the Miracles did they
[29:49] not see the signs did they not see the
[29:51] Wonder they've seen blinded eyes come
[29:53] open they've seen the lame walk they've
[29:55] seen all of this but notice when
[29:57] whenever Jesus
[29:59] ain't nowhere near and they can't see
[30:02] him with the natural eye notice now
[30:04] they're going to have to walk by a faith
[30:06] that they've never had to possess before
[30:08] they've never had to walk like this
[30:10] they've never had to go like this and
[30:12] Satan knows that Jesus ain't there and
[30:14] fear grips them when we can't look down
[30:16] at them fear's done us the same way and
[30:19] the prophet tells us that fear paralyzes
[30:22] faith that faith and fear cannot be in
[30:24] the same place at the same time you
[30:26] either got fa or you got fear and let me
[30:29] tell you that's the same thing that
[30:30] comes to us first bad report from the
[30:32] doctor we get scared first sign the flu
[30:34] we get scared first sign of Co first
[30:37] sign of a c first sign of
[30:39] a knows what happens we get scared and
[30:43] brother said these demons was watching
[30:45] these disciples on every wave they would
[30:47] come up thinking it could any moment at
[30:49] any time they can be going and Satan let
[30:52] me say this Satan is saying the same
[30:54] thing tonight as what he said against
[30:56] them he's trying to let you know you
[30:58] won't make it through this age all it
[31:00] takes is one more way one more trouble
[31:03] one more doctor visit one more bad MRI
[31:05] one more bad CT scan that's all you're
[31:07] going to be able to take but let me say
[31:10] this Jesus Is Watching Over Us I said
[31:13] Jesus is watching us there has never
[31:15] been a time but
[31:16] the the threat of the kingdom of hell
[31:19] was going to come that Jesus didn't
[31:21] divert that threat and settle it for his
[31:25] disciples you who believe
[31:28] the word for this day is who hell's
[31:29] going to be against you that stands for
[31:32] truth Satan hates you he hates you so
[31:35] bad listen he ain't out here trying to
[31:37] get denomination he's already got him
[31:40] he's not trying to get out here and
[31:42] getting the people in the pups he's
[31:43] already he wants those that says they're
[31:45] Believers he wants those that says I
[31:47] believe the word those that are Christ
[31:49] followers that that's who he want he
[31:51] wants young people that claims that
[31:53] they're children of God he wants moms
[31:55] and dads that has a principle and stands
[31:57] on the principles of the word that's who
[31:59] he
[32:00] wants you know why you're a threat to
[32:03] the kingdom of
[32:04] hell so what's he caus waves of
[32:07] sicknesses come by
[32:11] storms of discouragement come by he
[32:14] causes doubts he causes troubles I'm
[32:17] preaching to you you know why he wants
[32:19] to make us fear he knows if he can get
[32:23] these disciples and if he can get Christ
[32:25] disciples if he can get us to fear and
[32:28] shake them up enough and steer them up
[32:31] in that boat enough he knows he'll
[32:33] eventually sink the
[32:35] boat even Satan knows that faith cannot
[32:39] stand in the atmosphere of fear he knows
[32:43] faith cannot reside at the same time so
[32:46] what's he do he gets them looking at the
[32:48] waves he gets them looking at how much
[32:50] water's coming in the boat he gets him
[32:51] looking at broken ores are you hearing
[32:53] me he gets us looking at everything that
[32:56] goes wrong he gets us looking at the
[32:58] news you might not even worri about the
[32:59] news like the prophet said it's going to
[33:01] be the it's going to be the same thing
[33:02] but a different
[33:04] person that ain't changing it's the same
[33:07] thing but different people is that right
[33:09] there no sense to look at it's going to
[33:11] be the same thing over and over and over
[33:13] again and what Satan is doing is he
[33:16] wants to bring obstacles and he wants to
[33:18] bring confusion bring doubt bring fear
[33:21] into our minds to try to limit our faith
[33:24] from being able to move if he can bring
[33:26] me to a place where he paralyzes me and
[33:29] I'm get in that weak moment he's looking
[33:30] for that vul moment that weak moment
[33:33] when you're down when you're discouraged
[33:35] when you're depressed and he'll use
[33:36] everything that's around you he'll use
[33:38] all kinds of sicknesses that are around
[33:40] to try to make you doubt your
[33:43] Fai he'll put a demon on every
[33:47] wave he'll do everything he can to sink
[33:50] your
[33:51] boat now what does
[33:54] Satan Tak as he sees this advantage
[33:58] here is the disciples and no doubt you
[34:01] know these men is not just men that
[34:04] doesn't know anything about the water
[34:05] they've been raised on the sea they know
[34:07] what this they know what the Sea of
[34:08] galile is like they know how storms can
[34:10] come up but this ain't a normal this
[34:13] ain't a normal storm I'm gonna tell you
[34:15] one more time this ain't a normal storm
[34:18] this is a fourth watch storm and Why Oh
[34:22] Glory and why they are in
[34:25] Despair and it looks like there's no way
[34:27] they're going to make it and Satan's
[34:29] done everything he can to sink that boat
[34:32] but what Satan didn't know is Jesus was
[34:37] coming Hallelujah I said Jesus was
[34:40] coming and when Jesus came off the
[34:43] mountain amen and he come down on the
[34:46] sea and he come down on the waters and
[34:49] he come down in your life he came
[34:51] walking on top of the
[34:53] W waves he came walking over every
[34:56] redeeming he come walking over all the
[34:58] trouble he come walking right down where
[35:01] they was at let me tell you that's the
[35:02] same thing that God did for you he come
[35:05] walking over your trouble he come
[35:06] walking in your sin and iniquity maybe
[35:09] you was in a drug house he came walking
[35:11] to where you was at he walked right down
[35:13] into that Ballroom he walked right down
[35:15] in your
[35:19] depravity you know how he knew where to
[35:21] get you he'd been watching
[35:23] you he'd been watching you he knew right
[35:26] where you was at he knew the trouble
[35:28] that you was in he was mindful of
[35:29] everything that you was going
[35:32] through and that's my message you can
[35:34] either sit in the boat or you can walk
[35:38] on the
[35:40] water you hear that you can either let
[35:44] me tell you you can either just sit
[35:46] around this thing and let it be
[35:48] scriptures quotes good feelings good
[35:50] church good sermons pretty ideal
[35:53] socialized religion or you can be
[35:55] somebody that steps out of the boat you
[35:57] can be one of those Believers and when
[35:59] it comes time to believe you're going to
[36:01] that's what believers do they
[36:03] believe I can't think of nothing better
[36:05] brother Tom I can't think of nothing
[36:07] better tonight than a whole church
[36:10] walking on
[36:11] water amen I say we need to look up say
[36:15] Lord if that be you be me to come to
[36:18] thee upon the
[36:21] [Applause]
[36:22] Water can you imagine young people walk
[36:26] Walking on water preachers walking on
[36:28] water deacons walking on water trust it
[36:31] everybody Walking On
[36:34] Water Peter looks up and they see
[36:37] something coming on the water and fear
[36:40] struck them but Peter Allelujah Peter
[36:44] looks beyond
[36:46] waves Glory he looks beyond trouble and
[36:51] he says
[36:52] Lord if
[36:54] that that be you do you know why Peter
[36:58] says this because he knows it's no
[37:01] longer safe in the
[37:03] boat are you hear me I'm telling you
[37:06] listen it's no longer safe in this boat
[37:08] no more Lord if that be you didn't me to
[37:11] come walk on up friend there's only one
[37:14] way to do that there's only one day
[37:16] you've got to call out yourself it must
[37:19] be an individual Revelation in every
[37:21] heart that when you see the word for
[37:23] yourself that you say Lord if that be
[37:26] you and you read your Bible Lord if that
[37:28] be you whenever you get down lord if
[37:30] that be you when you push play Lord if
[37:33] that be you Lord B me I don't want to
[37:35] just hear I want to be an actor of the
[37:37] word I don't want to just talk about it
[37:39] I don't want it to be TBL talk I want to
[37:41] become the very embodiment of what it
[37:43] says that be you bid me as an individual
[37:47] to come walking on the water you know
[37:50] what Jesus said think about this Jesus
[37:54] uses one word I like that he uses one
[37:59] word
[38:01] come he don't he don't say and Moses
[38:05] said and Jeremiah said and Nehemiah said
[38:08] and Ezekiel said and Isaiah said one
[38:12] word one word think about one word you
[38:16] think what you need for the word to be
[38:17] put into action all we need is one word
[38:20] but that word is not just any word that
[38:23] word may be spoken by one syllable but
[38:25] let me tell you it may be spoken that
[38:27] way but when it's received it goes past
[38:29] the fifth all my it gets way down inside
[38:32] of the heart it goes way down inside the
[38:34] soul of a man and something about that
[38:36] word begins to steer on the Inside Man
[38:40] and it does something to the inside of a
[38:42] man hey man it's more than just hearing
[38:46] the word but there's an action from the
[38:49] inside Lord if that be you bid me to
[38:53] come and walk on the water so we must
[38:57] have a part in this bid me what are you
[39:02] hearing can I ask you that what do you
[39:04] need to hear
[39:06] tonight what do you need to hear is it a
[39:10] good sermon we've heard a lot of good
[39:12] sermons what do you need to hear what do
[39:14] you in your personal walk with God I'm
[39:17] not talking about me don't think about
[39:18] me I'm talking about what are you
[39:20] needing to hear to build your play your
[39:22] life into a place and a sphere of faith
[39:25] that you can walk on the what's it going
[39:27] to
[39:27] take you waiting for another tape to be
[39:30] found somewhere maybe a Bible verse that
[39:32] you ain't never had what's it going to
[39:33] take what you are listen what you are by
[39:36] the word right now is what you're going
[39:38] to be what's it going to take what has
[39:42] to happen to get our attention how bad
[39:45] does the storm got to get how big and
[39:48] how tall does the waves have to get how
[39:51] high does the waves got to get I don't
[39:53] want to offend you but I got to say this
[39:55] you can either sit in the boat or you
[39:58] can get
[40:01] out let me tell you what I see I see too
[40:05] many people hunkered down in the
[40:11] boat I'm just preaching to myself I'm
[40:14] just preaching about me a minute I see
[40:16] too many people that's hunkered down the
[40:18] boat they got a hold of the rail they
[40:21] got a hold of a broken ore they got a
[40:22] hold of the bottom of the floor and you
[40:24] listen how can you ever walk on the
[40:26] water if you don't stand
[40:28] up come on how can we really walk where
[40:31] we need to walk if we're so worried
[40:33] about the fear and the trouble and the
[40:35] waves and the problems and the
[40:37] circumstance how can we walk on the
[40:39] water if we're too busy hu her down the
[40:43] boat anybody listen anybody can come to
[40:46] church and sit on pews anybody can pack
[40:49] a Bible around anybody can put a picture
[40:51] on the wall anybody can carry message
[40:53] books but it takes somebody who is
[40:55] serious with God to stand up in that b
[40:58] and to go walking around it takes
[40:59] somebody that's got a real
[41:03] Revelation I'm talking about standing up
[41:06] in the middle of a test standing up in
[41:08] the middle of trouble standing up in the
[41:10] middle of sickness Lord if that be you B
[41:13] me to come on the
[41:17] water why listen to me why do we think
[41:22] that the safest place is in the bottom
[41:25] of the boat
[41:27] why is it why do we put more F faith in
[41:31] boats than we do Walking With
[41:35] Jesus it hits you strange don't it I'm
[41:39] challenging you I know why there are
[41:42] securities in the
[41:44] boat lots of Securities in this
[41:48] boat it's
[41:50] tangible I can put my hands on it I can
[41:53] put my feet on it I can feel it
[41:57] when you got your hands on it and you
[41:59] know when you left the shore this boat's
[42:01] got you this far but it ain't going to
[42:03] get you the rest of the
[42:04] way come on what happens is we put our
[42:09] faith we put more faith in material
[42:13] things than we do Walking With
[42:16] Jesus listen to me but our faith cannot
[42:19] be tested the way that God wants it to
[42:21] be tested hunker down the bottom of the
[42:25] boat
[42:27] had Peter been like everybody else this
[42:30] scripture wouldn't even be here in the
[42:31] Book of Matthew think about it had Peter
[42:35] been like everybody else we wouldn't
[42:37] even have this story but I want to tell
[42:40] you oh my here is Peter and something
[42:43] strikes him listen don't let the devil
[42:45] talk you in the staying in a sinking
[42:47] boat I don't think the safest place is
[42:50] the boat I think the safest place is
[42:52] with Christ I think the safest place is
[42:55] with Jesus the safest place ain't the
[42:57] both the safest place ain't your comfort
[42:59] zone it ain't Le on a sea it ain't the
[43:01] church the safest place is Walking With
[43:06] Jesus that's the safest place how many
[43:10] times do we get hunkered down that boat
[43:12] and about that time here comes a billow
[43:14] slaps the side of that boat you know
[43:15] what we do get a little bit bigger grip
[43:18] on that boat listen friends we got a lot
[43:20] of confidence in the boat the boat's
[43:22] been good for a long time and we get in
[43:24] there we got our heads down
[43:27] and we think oh my here comes another
[43:29] one and another one and another one but
[43:30] all you're doing is hanging on yeah and
[43:34] hope it
[43:36] stops but hope ain't going to get you
[43:39] out of here faith
[43:41] is you hear me Faith is many people
[43:46] hopes it's going to get better oh their
[43:48] hope is November 20124 give me a trump
[43:52] man ain't the hope I'm looking for it
[43:53] ain't that trump it is a trump but it
[43:55] just ain't that Trump
[43:56] our hope is not in government the
[43:59] prophet says the last vision of this
[44:01] nation it was in it was in atomic ashes
[44:04] don't put your hope in governments don't
[44:06] put your hope in politics put your hope
[44:08] in the only place and the safest place
[44:10] and that's walking with Jesus because
[44:12] governments a failure men will fail you
[44:14] preachers will failure but God Amen God
[44:17] will never fail
[44:22] you I'm just hoping it goes away hey man
[44:26] we need more than hope we need a faith
[44:29] to get up and to step out you know we do
[44:33] in the boat we got so much confidence in
[44:35] the boat can I preach this all right too
[44:38] late ain't it we start bailing
[44:41] water we start bailing water you know
[44:44] why saving this boat I'm in control you
[44:47] know what you're telling God I got this
[44:49] Lord let me bail some of the water out
[44:51] of this boat I think I can save myself I
[44:54] mean I think I can save this boat I got
[44:56] enough strength I got enough ability I
[44:58] got enough understanding I got enough
[45:00] engineering that I can save this soul I
[45:02] can save myself you can't save yourself
[45:05] I can't save myself you can't pray
[45:07] enough you can't fast enough you can't
[45:09] clean yourself up enough you've got to
[45:10] be able to have faith to walk with
[45:14] Jesus it's going to take more than your
[45:17] ability to save you amen if you don't
[45:20] get H of Jesus guess what going to be a
[45:23] whole boat full of dead men I said Jesus
[45:26] don't show up it's a bunch of dead men
[45:29] let me tell you why because there's more
[45:31] water coming in the boat than what's
[45:33] going out of the
[45:34] boat you see what I'm saying there's
[45:37] more trouble around us there's more
[45:38] things that's going on there's more
[45:40] water that's coming in than what we can
[45:42] get out of it's impossible to keep the
[45:45] boat afloat without
[45:47] faith it's impossible to take the
[45:49] Rapture without faith it's impossible to
[45:53] overcome this age without faith that's
[45:56] the reason I say Lord if that be you B
[45:59] me to come walk on the water the prophet
[46:03] tells us as he describes in great detail
[46:05] that the ores are broke the boats
[46:08] filling up with water the Sails are
[46:10] broke they can't sail their way out they
[46:12] can't listen they can't bail their way
[46:14] out and too many of the men is still
[46:16] sitting around hanging on that boat I
[46:18] say it's time for somebody to stand up I
[46:22] say it's time for the bride to stand up
[46:24] it's time for the body to start walking
[46:26] over some things that they used to sink
[46:28] in things that used to take them down
[46:30] and completely put them down the M it's
[46:32] time we start walking over that I don't
[46:34] care what it is if it's radio television
[46:37] family children spousal Problem whatever
[46:39] it is it's time we don't allow that to
[46:42] affect us but our eyes has got to be
[46:44] upon Christ and tell him Lord I'm
[46:46] walking
[46:48] over this the way you walked over drugs
[46:51] the way you walked over alcohol the way
[46:53] you walked over the world that's the way
[46:54] you can walk on this
[46:57] water you know what it's going to take
[46:59] you got to put something into action and
[47:02] you never can make that listen you can
[47:04] never make the first step until you
[47:05] stand up it's imperative listen to me
[47:08] tonight it's imperative it's an
[47:10] emergency we must get out of the
[47:13] boat if the sails Won't Sail and the
[47:15] ores won't if the ORS won't paddle and
[47:19] the storm's not going away there's only
[47:21] one answer stepping out of the boat
[47:24] that's right oh yeah amen prise
[47:29] Lord it was at this
[47:32] moment something Supernatural takes
[47:35] place it was at this moment that Peter
[47:39] now watch that Peter looks up and he
[47:42] sees something coming across the water I
[47:45] don't know how many saw it but I can
[47:48] tell you this at least one of them did
[47:50] see it now it may not have been as we
[47:53] would say the way the store starts
[47:56] because they think it's a
[48:00] spirit so there's fear listen the moment
[48:04] that Christ is coming that's when the
[48:06] most fear is coming against
[48:10] them and when Jesus sees
[48:14] Peter he's been oh something about Peter
[48:19] looks and he says who it is so Peter the
[48:24] one that's SS to walk he has a
[48:27] supernatural Enlightenment Amen to who's
[48:31] coming toward them so in the darkest
[48:34] time Peter had eyes to see in the dark
[48:38] come on somebody
[48:40] in when the waves are the greatest Peter
[48:43] seen who it was when the trouble is the
[48:45] greatest Peter seen who it was was his
[48:48] eyes come open actually he see he not
[48:50] only look but then he
[48:52] recognizes so he looks he recogniz
[48:56] now it's time to act are you hearing me
[48:59] let me just say this when he seen it was
[49:01] Jesus and he seen Jesus walking on the
[49:04] water something about what Peter saw
[49:07] done something inside of Peter something
[49:10] in Peter begin to awake Glory Glory GL
[49:13] something in him is moved to the sphere
[49:15] of faith that caused him to stand up and
[49:20] speak and I want to tell you this that's
[49:23] exactly where we are at right now
[49:26] do you hear me this is where this is in
[49:28] my honest opinion this is where we're at
[49:31] right now this is where we're at today
[49:33] our faith has been restored by the
[49:35] message of the hour it's in this day
[49:37] that God is calling the elected bride to
[49:40] a higher real of faith in what she's
[49:42] ever possessed before I'm not just
[49:44] talking about faith I'm talking about a
[49:46] perfect faith we cannot sit here and our
[49:48] keep our eyes on the ways come on
[49:50] somebody we can't sit here and keep our
[49:52] eyes on trouble he's letting us know
[49:54] Jesus is here there's a Christ that is
[49:56] Among Us the word is Among Us and it's
[50:00] [Applause]
[50:02] real everything that God promised us he
[50:05] would do he's done it this day our faith
[50:08] has come back our hearts has been turned
[50:11] back the word has been revealed the
[50:12] seals has come open the Mysteries has
[50:15] become real God has left us without
[50:18] excuse now it's time that faith of the
[50:21] word moves in and you've got to do your
[50:24] part amen what do I need to do let this
[50:28] faith that has been brought by the
[50:29] message of Malachi
[50:31] 4 let it move you into
[50:34] action so he's heard he's recognized and
[50:39] now something in Peter oh my when he
[50:43] sees Jesus and he looks and sees him he
[50:47] seen something I don't I can't really
[50:49] even understand it but there's something
[50:52] in him that when he sees that word he
[50:54] recognized his day and its message he
[50:58] recognized an authority that lays in the
[51:01] word that gives him a
[51:04] right when the waves got higher it moved
[51:08] Peter's Faith to a place of
[51:12] speech where he can say some things now
[51:15] I said that's where Christ is trying to
[51:17] be get the church to he's trying to move
[51:19] us to a place where you can ask anything
[51:21] in my name and it shall be it don't
[51:23] matter how impossible it looks it don't
[51:25] matter how big the waves are you want to
[51:27] walk on waves you can walk on you want
[51:29] to walk on cancer you can walk on you
[51:31] want to walk on Diabetes you can walk on
[51:37] it something about this moves Peter to a
[51:41] dimension of Faith to where Peter opens
[51:43] up his mouth and his faith says Lord if
[51:46] that be you the storm moved him to open
[51:51] his mouth and start speaking Yeah
[51:56] Lord help me to get a hold of it we need
[51:58] to get so fed up with bailing water
[52:01] we've got to get so fed up that it moves
[52:03] our faith into a place to where we can
[52:05] speak notice Peter didn't do listen when
[52:08] Peter says Lord if that be you the
[52:10] moment Peter's Faith reaches out and he
[52:13] sends that Faith out he sends those
[52:15] words out Jesus did not remain silent
[52:17] during the storm I said Jesus will not
[52:21] remain quiet in the middle of
[52:23] troublesome times
[52:27] the power of one word give this man The
[52:31] Authority the word give this man of
[52:34] authority to walk on water can you
[52:37] imagine the present tense word Christ
[52:40] the present tense word give this man a
[52:43] disciple of Christ an elect of God it
[52:46] give the elect the authority to walk on
[52:49] the
[52:51] water Jesus said well come right on
[52:54] Peter
[52:56] can you
[52:57] imagine Jesus hearing this from Peter
[53:00] Lord that be you been me can you imagine
[53:03] what this must have done to the heart of
[53:05] him when he sees this man in the middle
[53:07] of the great this dark trial that
[53:09] they're going through when just a moment
[53:11] ago
[53:12] there was so much hope you got enough
[53:15] ear to hear the voice tonight calling
[53:17] from the water come on young people come
[53:21] on Daddy come on
[53:24] sick I'm on depressed if you've been
[53:27] worried all you got to do is come right
[53:28] on the water's
[53:31] fine this is what I see this is just the
[53:34] way I see
[53:35] it I can see Peter stand up I don't
[53:38] believe the boat stopped
[53:40] moving I can see Peter stand up that
[53:43] boat's moving all around him I mean that
[53:45] thing's rocking back and forth but
[53:48] Peter not only has he seen not only has
[53:51] he heard but now there's a supernatural
[53:54] faith that is has elevated him and
[53:56] something in this man starts responding
[53:58] to the word his faith is elevating him
[54:01] to a realm of the supernatural listen
[54:03] that no other man in the scripture
[54:06] outside of Jesus has ever even done this
[54:09] why his faith took over his
[54:12] eyes his fith took over his emotions his
[54:16] fith took over his feelings his fith
[54:18] took over his thoughts his faith took
[54:20] over his mind he looked past the wave he
[54:23] looked past the wind he Pastor I'm
[54:26] preaching to he look past that's what
[54:28] faith does faith looks past all
[54:31] the it looks past all right it looks
[54:34] past CT and it looks to the Divine
[54:36] promise of God that says come on Peter
[54:39] come on walking on the
[54:41] [Applause]
[54:42] water this man's not even seeing waves
[54:46] he's not seeing the wind he's not seeing
[54:48] the trouble he's not seeing the turmoil
[54:50] a mortal
[54:53] man I see Peter stand
[54:57] up and about that time Beyond thought
[55:02] Beyond intellect Beyond any part of a
[55:04] man's mind simply by faith I can see
[55:08] Peter stick his foot over the edge of
[55:10] that
[55:16] boat sounds solid to me how about
[55:20] you I'm talking about just as solid as
[55:22] that floor is I can see as he takes his
[55:26] leg and say it feels like a board down
[55:28] there something feels like it's
[55:29] happening
[55:31] right here you know what I think I'm
[55:33] going to do I think I'm going to go
[55:35] ahead and get out of this boat and the
[55:36] first thing you got to do is you got to
[55:38] let go and when you let go you start
[55:40] walking out of the water I'm walking to
[55:42] where Jesus is I'm not stopping I'm not
[55:44] looking ways I'm not looking at troubles
[55:46] I got my eyes on that word and I ain't
[55:49] quitting till I get there I ain't
[55:50] stopping till I get there I'm walking on
[55:52] the
[55:54] water
[55:55] [Music]
[55:58] but you know what too many of us do my
[56:01] brother David but you don't know
[56:04] me you don't understand I know Jesus can
[56:08] do it but this is me I know the Bible
[56:11] says that Peter did it but this is me
[56:14] I'm sure brother Rand could do it but
[56:17] this is me brother Tom can do it but
[56:19] this is me if Peter would have thought
[56:23] that he would have never got out of the
[56:26] boat
[56:27] amen you know what you're saying let me
[56:29] interpret it for you what if I don't
[56:31] make the Rapture what if I'm not elect
[56:35] what if I'm not predestinated what if
[56:36] I'm not a child of God your faith must
[56:38] be anchored to the revelation of this
[56:40] hour it's beyond what you see it's
[56:43] beyond what you feel it's beyond what
[56:45] you think it's beyond your natural mind
[56:47] it's what the word says about
[56:53] you
[56:57] what scriptural
[57:00] evence does Peter
[57:03] have what quote can he take us back
[57:06] to huh oh he don't have none he ain't
[57:10] got one scriptural evidence of another
[57:12] man ever walking on
[57:14] water he didn't need
[57:16] evidence because in the present tense of
[57:18] the light the word it elevates his faith
[57:21] to a sphere where it does things man
[57:24] knows nothing about
[57:25] I can imagine the waves didn't stop
[57:27] trouble didn't stop you know what he did
[57:29] put his foot right over there when the
[57:32] wind won't stop the rain won't stop and
[57:33] the storm will stop listen there was no
[57:36] change in the Storm at
[57:39] all but they didn't need a change in the
[57:42] storm God needed a change in
[57:45] Peter take it home with you tonight we
[57:49] don't need a change in the world we
[57:51] don't need to put some preacher to bring
[57:52] some big rally to America you know what
[57:54] we need we need a change in America we
[57:56] need a change in our life a change in
[57:58] the way we see things said God could put
[58:00] Abraham Lincoln on every corner and he
[58:02] said wouldn't do no good Abraham Lincoln
[58:04] may not do it let me tell Billy gram or
[58:06] orl Roberts wouldn't do it but I'm want
[58:08] to tell you the word Christ Among Us it
[58:10] will change it may not change America
[58:12] but it change some
[58:15] Americans there was a change in Peter
[58:17] the word pulled this man to a higher
[58:21] Dimension yes it caused Peter to be
[58:26] raptured that's what I'm preaching to
[58:28] you did Peter walk on top of it so he
[58:31] was caught up or raptured up above it
[58:36] the word pulled him to a sphere his
[58:38] faith did it pulled him to the sphere
[58:40] where all things are possible to them
[58:42] that believe but if you're always
[58:45] looking at the senses and the feelings
[58:46] and the emotions and the sensitivity he
[58:49] has listen you must go beyond human
[58:51] ability it went it sent him to a
[58:53] dimension that I allowed him to do
[58:55] something outside the carnal mind can
[58:57] even
[58:59] think that's the people that's got the
[59:01] faith of Abraham they call those things
[59:03] which were not as though they
[59:06] were do you realize that's the same
[59:09] faith that Samson used to defeat a
[59:11] thousand Phil stones with the dry jaw
[59:13] bone of an ass that's the same faith
[59:15] that David used when he slung it at a
[59:17] giant one day it's that same Faith
[59:19] that's the faith that shamgar had when
[59:20] he went down there with the Oxo listen
[59:22] that is the authority that the bride
[59:24] needs it ain't some great big true huge
[59:26] Revelation it's who you are in Christ
[59:28] and recognizing who he is recognizing
[59:31] who you are and then acting on what it
[59:34] is circumstances don't matter the odds
[59:38] don't
[59:39] matter no matter how outnumbered they
[59:42] was it doesn't matter the size of the
[59:44] giant it don't matter how hot the fire
[59:46] is that's not what we're looking at
[59:48] Faith looks at the word not circumstance
[59:50] not symptoms it looks to the promise of
[59:52] God listen don't don't worry about
[59:56] that just like the thing we read the
[59:58] other day don't tell your storm don't
[1:00:00] tell your God how big your storm is tell
[1:00:03] your storm how big your God
[1:00:05] is how you looking at it tell that storm
[1:00:09] that your God to a water walking God
[1:00:12] tell your storm your God walks through
[1:00:14] the fire tell your God that tell your
[1:00:16] storm that your God has the ability to
[1:00:19] do abundantly more than you can ask or
[1:00:23] think
[1:00:26] I guarantee you when Peter stood up in
[1:00:29] that boat he got the attention of
[1:00:30] everybody in that
[1:00:31] boat they may think the same thing about
[1:00:34] you but I don't
[1:00:36] care I said I don't care people watching
[1:00:40] you stand up in the boat who cares well
[1:00:42] what's people going to say I don't care
[1:00:44] what they say what's people going to
[1:00:45] think if they see you standing up in the
[1:00:48] boat I don't care what they think you
[1:00:50] confess you're a Believer you say you're
[1:00:52] solded out you say you're anchored to
[1:00:55] people's going to watch you they're
[1:00:56] going to watch your life they're going
[1:00:57] to watch what you wear they're going to
[1:00:59] watch what you do go ahead go ahead and
[1:01:01] keep right on watching they may call you
[1:01:03] a fanatic they may call you a manfa but
[1:01:05] what they didn't hear they didn't hear
[1:01:06] the word that you heard that said come
[1:01:08] on out
[1:01:10] [Applause]
[1:01:12] here well you ought to be used to
[1:01:14] getting looked at strange but now come
[1:01:17] on that's the way you're denomination
[1:01:19] looked at you when you walked out their
[1:01:20] doors that's why the that's why your
[1:01:23] friends looked at you when you told them
[1:01:24] you were serving God and now you're a
[1:01:26] Christ
[1:01:27] follower
[1:01:29] amen when you tell them you're getting
[1:01:31] out of this boat they're going to look
[1:01:32] at you strange even people around our
[1:01:35] message well look at you strange well
[1:01:38] who do you think you are anyway what do
[1:01:40] you think you're doing what do you think
[1:01:42] you do coming around our church telling
[1:01:43] people to step out of the boat listen
[1:01:45] friends God's been building this kind of
[1:01:47] a church year in and year out this is
[1:01:49] the kind of people that God wants and
[1:01:50] this is the kind of people he's going to
[1:01:52] have and I'm afraid that's where people
[1:01:53] is missing that we know quotes we know
[1:01:55] scriptures we know seals we know
[1:01:57] Thunders we know pools but let me tell
[1:01:59] we know all about mechanics but do we
[1:02:01] got enough M Faith do we got enough
[1:02:03] Dynamics to make the mechanics move what
[1:02:05] good does it do to have a perfect car if
[1:02:07] you ain't got no Dynamics to make that
[1:02:10] car
[1:02:15] move yall they're going to talk about
[1:02:17] you yeah they're going to look down on
[1:02:20] you but they didn't hear you hear word
[1:02:23] when Jesus said come right on you know
[1:02:26] what I wonder I wonder if people has
[1:02:29] really apprehended God or have they just
[1:02:32] block Baptist boats for message boats or
[1:02:35] Pentecostal boats for message boats
[1:02:37] Catholic boat for a message
[1:02:38] boat Peter puts his foot out that boat
[1:02:42] bobbing back and forth he didn't try to
[1:02:45] figure it all out he didn't try to get
[1:02:47] into the Alder this thing see pleas
[1:02:50] minus three x pyx this and uhuh Faith
[1:02:54] went beyond every bit of that he never
[1:02:57] the prophet tells us in perfect Faith he
[1:02:59] never even
[1:03:02] thought when are we going to stop trying
[1:03:04] to figure out how the Rapture is going
[1:03:06] to come how the body change is going to
[1:03:08] work and all kinds of ideas to it listen
[1:03:11] simply believe Lord I don't know when
[1:03:14] you're going to do it I don't know
[1:03:16] exactly how you're going to do all of it
[1:03:18] but I want to make sure when you find me
[1:03:20] I'm not hunker down the boat somewhere
[1:03:22] you're going to find me walking on the
[1:03:23] water
[1:03:27] how can God do that how can God heal us
[1:03:29] Deliver Us how in the world can God meet
[1:03:32] our need if we're trying to figure it
[1:03:34] out on our
[1:03:35] own don't you realize Jesus had already
[1:03:38] told these men where I am may you be
[1:03:44] also you hear that tonight what you got
[1:03:47] to do Peter take him at his word get out
[1:03:50] of the boat and God will take care of
[1:03:52] the rest of it
[1:03:54] and for a few
[1:03:56] moments something about the word
[1:03:58] elevates this man to where he's walking
[1:04:01] on this
[1:04:03] water but the moment he started getting
[1:04:05] his eyes on waves troubles problems
[1:04:10] everything I'm preaching governments
[1:04:12] politicians politics votes elections
[1:04:15] structure around work politics around
[1:04:17] your job that's when you start sinking
[1:04:21] down there is a walk of faith that we
[1:04:23] can possess
[1:04:25] stand our feet tonight as we bow our
[1:04:27] hearts
[1:04:29] Hallelujah there's a walk of faith that
[1:04:33] you can possess
[1:04:34] tonight I believe there's a realm where
[1:04:37] we can walk in where all things are
[1:04:41] possible we cannot sit still friends
[1:04:44] listen to me you cannot sit still and
[1:04:46] hope that somebody else gets up and
[1:04:48] walks on the water for you you must take
[1:04:50] the initiative as an individual yourself
[1:04:53] Young person you got to take the
[1:04:55] initiative for
[1:04:57] yourself say Lord if you're going to
[1:04:59] send a
[1:05:00] Revival I want you to start right here

[1:05:13] boat your battle isn't over just because
[1:05:15] you walk don't mean the trouble's over
[1:05:17] and the wavs are going to start oh no
[1:05:18] but if you keep your eyes on the promise
[1:05:21] you'll finally come in Jesus I get a
[1:05:23] hold of you
[1:05:24] oh God help us tonight Hallelujah think
[1:05:28] about this quote where says faith is the
[1:05:30] substance of things hop for the evidence
[1:05:32] of things you don't see taste feel smell
[1:05:34] or hear but when faith when he catches
[1:05:37] the word it sends him into a dimension
[1:05:41] that makes it so real to him till it's
[1:05:43] just as good as he's got it in his hand
[1:05:46] he knows it's going to happen
[1:05:49] hallelujah
