[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Morning, brothers and sisters. If we'll just stand this morning, maybe brother John Wade will open us in prayer this morning. Amen. The children can be dismissed for Sunday school if you'll just go with me in the Psalms. We're going to go to Psalms 103 today. Sure is good to be in the house of the Lord. Brother Brenham said, "You can't leave the same." He said, "You'll either leave better or you'll leave worse." And I prayed that we all leave better this morning. Psalms 103. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases, &gt;&gt; who satisfy the mouth with good things, so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles. He made known his ways unto Moses his acts unto the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger forever. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. &gt;&gt; Like as a father pityth his children, so the Lord pityth them that fear him. As for man, his days are as grass, and as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. &gt;&gt; The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness is unto a children's children. The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over all. the Lord, all ye his host, ye ministers of his that do his pleasure. Bless the Lord, all his works in all his places of his dominion. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. God bless. You may be seated, Brother Brian. Morning, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; You know, after reading a chapter like that, God cares about you that much. If you would turn with me to uh the Gospel of John, the the 15th chapter. I have to do it this way. the middle of my Bible is those from chapters like 14 to 17 and they're destroyed. But I was uh thinking this morning all all the messages that we've listened to, all the word of God that we've read in our lives. I was thinking are is it grounded in you this morning? Is the word of God completely taken over your heart this morning? Your very spirit, your soul, your flesh is everything possessed by the word of God and the spirit of Jesus Christ this morning. And I was thinking of the age that we're in this morning and the circumstances in the world, everything that goes on in our families, in our lives this morning. Are you grounded in Jesus Christ this morning? And are you so grounded no matter what the circumstances are in your family or in the world, no matter what they say, are you going to fall on your knees and believe Christ or are you going to believe the world? And I was I was I was just thinking this morning, I'm one of my uh a historical thing on from I seen a truth social post this morning. They were talking about this this object headed to the earth. And you know, I'm not trying to be funny this morning, but the reality of Jesus Christ is what I'm trying to say. If if an alien spaceship landed on the earth tomorrow morning and started killing human beings, would you still believe Jesus Christ this morning? If a asteroid was about to destroy, what would you believe? And what and not trying to be funny, but what I was really thinking about is we all have people in our lives that we interreact with every day of our lives. I'm thinking more in that circumstances. If a brother that you knew for 50 years or 40 years all of a sudden renounced Jesus Christ and walk the other way, where would your soul and where would your foundation? Would that unsettle your foundation? Would that unsettle your soul this morning? If a pastor that you trusted and believed all your life suddenly turned away from the gospel of Jesus Christ, would that leave you ungrounded? Would you have problem going the next day believing that Jesus It's to the point in the world this morning that you we have to be totally rooted in the word of God. no matter what the circumstances are in your family, in the world, or in the church that you know that you know that Jesus Christ is alive this morning. I I can't say it any other way that it's a late hour that we live in. And you know, Steve gave me this this morning. This is a fuel bill for the start of the year. Just lets me know something. My mind can only go back to the word of God is just like in Hebrews, we have no continuing cities here on this world. We have none. We look for one to come. So none of us this morning, no matter what the circumstances, we're each getting closer every hour, well, every second, every minute, every hour, every day, every year to that appointment one time. And that as I read the word of God and I listen to the message of the hour, I know that only thing one thing matters is is my relationship with Jesus Christ closer this morning than it was yesterday. And um it really struck me that the world is um falling apart. And and I know one thing in my own life, whatever you put before God, I I can tell you right now that he's going to pull the rug out from underneath it. I know in my own experiences in my life, if I've ever emphasized something so much in my life that I'm putting everything into it, all of a sudden, I know that God will pull the rug out for to get my attention. And we don't want to be that way in this late hour. We want our total focus this morning to be on the word of God and on Jesus Christ. We're we're unwavering in our faith, believing the word of God this morning. And I hadn't even read the scripture, but I was thinking of u the devotional from yesterday and and I'm not trying to be a comedian here this morning, but I was listening to the message from that devotional and when brother Brandham was talking to all the people in the service. Now, you know, I'm not an ed I'm not an educated man. Uh I have I don't have a degree in divinity. I don't have a PhD in something. But just think of it. Brother Brandham's talking to these people and he's saying is and I thought it was pretty. You got to realize when you build yourself up so much or you think your education gives you what you need to have and all of a sudden he says things like this. I just think of all those preachers that were in that service and he's talking like this. I I was just I'm not giggling. I'm just thinking he was talking about there's two types of chickens. One that's brooded and raised by its mother and one that's incubated. And brother Brandham was telling all these people just imagine you're a doctor of divinity out there. And he's saying that you've been raised in an incubator and everything that you've been taught is wrong and that you need to come God's way. You would say that would be a humiliating thing. That would rock your foundation. You're either going to do two things. you're going to get angry or your mind's going to open. And I thought it was funny, but I'll just read what his quote was this morning. Uh not going to things I always refer. I'll just read to what he had to say. And um he said Jesus would not permit his disciples to preach the gospel and until they receive the Holy Ghost. So that's really important. He wouldn't let them preach the gospel. He told them to go away until you're endued with power. That's no different in our own lives. We really can't be successful as Christians until the very presence of Jesus Christ possesses your heart and soul this morning. You're going to wind up go, like I say, running into circumstances where you can continue to fail until you go back to the correct foundation. He says, yet they have been honored to walk with him three and a half years. So he's saying you can be in a church for 10, 15 years, the same thing. Think you know it all that you know it, but if you ain't got the Holy Ghost when you need it, you won't have it. So they they thought they were holy men accepted in his sight. But he would not let them go preach until he waited up there and got all the differences out of them and the Holy Spirit came. And if you have that human nature, that natural nature, you're going to want you're going to find differences. You're going to have differences. But once you got God's nature, the only thing you're going to project to people is the true will of Jesus Christ. And he goes on to say here, what the world needs today is the same filling when the dumping outcomes. And that's what the brothers have been talking about a lot lately is you got to be completely empty to be filled. You know, you can't fill an old vessel with with something new or it's not going to work. And it's so important this morning that I know in my own life, you got to be totally empty so God can possess it this morning. If it needs a filling, what does the filling do when it comes in where you have doubt? And that's the problem with the world this morning. There's so much out there to give you doubt. It brings faith. Where you have indifference, it brings love. And that really speaks to the age that we live this morning. There's so much indifference out there in the world this morning. It's hard for people to be to show love anymore. There's so much indifference, so much hate, so much, you know, people just the wrong spirit. It brings love where you had hatred. It brings fellowship. You know, that's a Christian, those are Christian virtues there. Those should be coming, you know, out of us every day of our lives. love fellowship and when the church of the living God someday will be united under one great head that that will be the head of God. God in you in a unity of the body of Christ and we will we will be the governor and the king and the and king and lord over the entire church under his control and she will be received up and I'll just sit down here in a few minutes. I didn't want to be up here and not read a few scriptures this morning out of God's word. Yeah. And I you all know I spent a lot of time I I love the Gospel of John. I I read it all the time. I But I'll just read what Jesus said in the 15th chapter. A few verses here. Um but I was just thinking what I said in the beginning. No matter what happened out there in the world this morning, whatever circumstances are out there in the world, if it's totally opposite of what you been told in the world, are you going to believe the word of God or are you going to believe the circumstances? So, I'm all I can do is speak for myself. No matter what happens out there, I'm going to believe God's word over everything. &gt;&gt; And that that's our obligation as Christians. I'll just read what Jesus had to say. And we all know this 15th chapter. I am the true vine and my father is the husbandman. I have to do it this way nowadays too because when I try to read it up here I lo I lose the words sometimes. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away. Every branch that beareth fruit he purge it. So God's going to purge you. You know God's going to make you better than tomorrow than you were today. God should have an o over his hand completely over your life making you better. He'll purge it. He'll bring forth more fruit. As God deals with you, he'll bring more fruit out of your life. Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken on you. And my own thought comes out of reading that third verse. If you're not in the word, you're not going to be clean by the word. So you can't have one with the other. You can't stay clean in this world or clean in this life unless you're abiding in the word of God. Abide in me and I in you and the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine. No more can you except you abide in me. So everything's based on that relationship this morning. And I am the vine and you are the branches. He that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit. Without me you can do nothing. And I'll read a couple more. And if a man abideth not in me, he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather him and cast him into the fire and they are burned. If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you. And I know there are many people here that have needs this morning. And this scriptures is in just as real right now as it was 2,000 years ago. Here is my father glorified. And this is God's desire for all of us. He wants you to bear fruit. He wants you to be a what what's the best you know the example brother Brham gave about the two calves one was fed good and the other one wasn't. Well, he wants you to be the one that's fed good this morning. Here in my father is glorified that you bear much fruit. So you shall be my disciples. And he go and I'll finish with this. As the father have loved me so I have loved you. Continue in my love. And this is really I I won't read that 10th verse. I keep saying I'm going to stop and I don't. But I do know one thing. God's commandments aren't grievious for us to do. He's just simply asking us to perform his word, love his word, and do his word. And like I started this morning, the really the only way you can do it with love and understanding is you got to have that baptism of the Holy Ghost. You have to have that experience in Jesus Christ this morning. Brother David, &gt;&gt; man, it's good to be here this morning. Let's stand and let's sing I'm redeemed. Bought with a price. [Music] Well, I am redeemed. I'm bought with a price. And Jesus has changed my whole life. If anybody asks you just who I am, oh tell them I am redeemed.

What is that in your hand? Amen. This morning, um, and I think I had a I had a uh little subtitle, I think, fire starters Wednesday. And I certainly didn't get through my sermon, but Amen. We're going to title give it a subtitle. Fire starter starters. God of the unusual. God of the unusual. Amen. Amen. Let's go before the author. Lord Jesus, we come before you, Lord, knowing God that all scripture is given by inspiration of you. is for do profitable for doctrine for reproof for instruction in righteousness Lord and we just ask God that you'll just bless the reading of the word this morning the meditation of our heart father and most of all we ask God that you'd help me just to get it out of the way that you'll use the gift Lord Jesus and just speak to your people what you once said this morning Lord my heart's desire father is Lord Jesus that this word that we speak Lord that it would be a word that is in time and for we know that that is precious, Lord Jesus, when we have a word that is in time, Lord. And Father, we thank you, Lord Jesus, for each one, Father, that is feeling well today, Lord. Those that haven't been feeling well, that are feeling better, Lord. We thank you so much. Amen. For Sister Parish this morning. Thank you, Lord, that she's feeling better, doing a little better, Lord. And we just ask, God, that you just continue to help her to scale that height of health again, Lord. And Lord, we want to just thank you for the healing that you provide for each and every one of us, both physically and spiritually, Lord. And if there's any spiritually sick this morning, we ask, God, that you would heal that sickness, Lord. For we know that that would be more important than physical healing, Lord. So we come before you, Lord. Our hearts are open, our minds are open, and Lord, and we sing yes, yes, Lord, to your will and to your way. And Father, that'll certainly come into our message this morning. for sometimes it's easier for us to say no and to doubt than it is to say yes. So we ask God that you'll bless the reading of the word, Lord. And we thank you, Lord Jesus, for Wednesday night service, God. And we ask now, Father, that you'll give us a fresh outpouring this morning of your word in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Amen. Turn your Bibles if you will, and we'll read the scripture once again. Amen. In Numbers 16. Numbers 16 and verse 29. Amen. No, it's not numbers. I'm sorry. Not. It's Exodus 4. Exodus 4. And I don't know just how long I'll go. Amen. On this little series of what is that in your hand? But basically the my thought is what is that in our hand? Amen. What have we got in our hand? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows? We could talk about that for a while. Ain't that right? What has the Lord given us in our hands? &gt;&gt; Amen. To whom much is given, much will be required. And how many knows we've been given a lot? &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, yeah. I mean, we're talking about more than anybody has ever been given. Amen. Sure, Paul had the revelation of Christ and he brought that revelation, but he didn't have the revelation of the book of Revelations. Nobody knew that. Not until the opening of the seals. Isn't that right? Took seven angels coming down. Even brother Brandham had it wrong in his room. Amen. That angel turned his mind and showed him. So, Amen. That's what you and I have in our hands. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, well, well. We could just go on and on and on. Amen. I believe that we have in our hand what it's going to take to get us out of here. Amen. I believe that we have in our hand the ability to believe every word. Amen. To take us back where Eve took us from by doubting one word. Amen. Oh my. Amen. I was on the road. on the road. On the road, I was thinking how that we're blessed people because every church age fell into a cycle of death. &gt;&gt; Every age. So, we're going to break that president, right? &gt;&gt; We're going to uh break that president and we're not going to fall. We have a scriptures quotes that says she's not going to fall. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Talk about fire starters. &gt;&gt; How many believe we got a fire started in in Malachi 4. Amen. The pillar of fire started. Amen. &gt;&gt; Through the prophet of God. He was a God used him to start a fire. Went around the world seven times with that fire. And did that fire burn out? &gt;&gt; Is it still burning? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, that's right. It's still burning right here. And it's going to burn. It's going to burn all the way to the end. Amen. I'm thankful for that. So, you talk about starting a fire. We know that even Billy uh Graham, I think or Roberts and those great men, they all admitted that brother Brandham's ministry spearheaded to revival of the 19th century. That was the spearhead. It's the one that led the revival of Tommy Hicks and all these other brothers. Amen. So you talk about getting the fire started. I'm thankful for to be a part of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So let's read in Exodus 4 and uh verse one and a couple of I think one and two. And Moses answered and said, "But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice, for they will say, the Lord hath not appeared unto thee." And the Lord said unto him, "What is that in thine hand?" And he said, "A rod." Amen. And of course, we know what God did to uh with that. Ain't that right? But what is that in your hand? Amen. And we know that David, all he had in his hand was a sling and five smooth stones. But when God got in it, &gt;&gt; Amen. God will use stones. He'll use sticks. It just Brother Ram says, it was just some stick that he picked up out there in the desert somewhere. It was nothing special. But Amen. But after he met the pillar of fire, Amen. God ordained that. Then it became a special stick. But Abraham said it became the actual judgment rod for Egypt. That's right. God's judgment rod. Amen. And of course, we know that that sling became a judgment rod to the giant. Ain't that right? Amen. Shear the ox goat. Little old ox goat. Something sticking in the corner of the building there. Amen. Amen. Mix that with a little faith. Ain't that right? And he grabbed a hold of that. Went out there and killed 600 Philistines. Amen. Amen. God will take little things, does things in unusual ways. Bring this down a little bit. Amen. Ma uh Matthew, one more scripture. Matthew 9. Maybe I'll go ahead and read my third scriptures. I only have three or four of them today. Don't have very many. I thought I was just going to have this one one scripture here and that was it. But I wanted to read what we started out with just in case I mean somebody perhaps out there hasn't seen where we were coming from or where we're going. Amen. Matthew 9:17 says, "Neither do men put new wine into old bottles, else those bottles break, and the wine runth out, and the bottles perish, but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved." Amen. Praise the Lord. First Corinthians 1 Corinthians I want to read that one yet and then we'll go on. 1 Corinthians 1 and verse 25 because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the w the the weakness of God is stronger than men. For we see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh. Not many mighty, not many noble are called. But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. And God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty. And the base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God chosen, yay, the things which are not, to bring to not things that are. Amen. So we see here how that God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound a wise. Back up in verse 18 of the same chapter there it says, "For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness." &gt;&gt; Amen. But unto us which are saved, it is the power of God. Amen. Somebody's glad for preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. To the world it might seem foolish, but to us it's the very power of God. God takes the foolishness of preaching to save those that believe. May God add his blessings to the reading. You can be seated this morning. Amen. Amen. I will say that this has probably been the shortest study I've done. Amen. On for a while. Amen. So, thank you for your prayers. I sat down yesterday not knowing just where I was going to go really and and and uh I started looking over my notes of what I where I had been and so forth and the Lord just began to pour it out. Amen. And I did a did a little uh I don't know what you call it little notes on the side, you know, before I get my main notes before I knew I had a whole page. And I said, "Well, I don't want to rewrite all that. I'll just bring my yellow tablet out and we'll do it the oldfashioned way." Amen. But anyway, so I like that when the Lord just begins to pour it out and just Amen. just uh gives us something to preach. Amen. So, praise the Lord. Certainly enjoyed Wednesday night. Amen. Brother Brad does a wonderful job, don't he? Amen. With the help of course of God, just as I need it also. Amen. Now, we want to start and just by God's with God's help and grace and want to Amen. and just see what the Lord will what the Lord will really where he'll all go with us. But we know that God does things in unusual ways. Amen. Uh I didn't pull the quote up, but brother B said one place he he was saying he says, you know, people will make the statement. He says, "Well, that's unusual." And he says, "Well, that's where God is." That's where God is. God is in the unusual or uh uh I want to use the worst pres unprecedented. I and I've learned this word I guess because of our uh justice systems and everything else they have a president they have a set ways if they they do things and when you do something different than that's unprecedented and amen it's not the usual it's not what you usually do. Amen. And God is that way. Amen. So as we begin to look at this we want to look Amen. First, let me just read the quote. Brother Bam says, "Now, we think of how God does things in unusual ways." Amen. And I want to say also that he does things in new ways or different ways. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I also want to say that uh that humanity, we as as as people, it's so important that we understand a little bit of how God operates, what he's like. Ain't that right? Uh and what he requires. Amen. And I believe that this message that God has sent in our day has really given us a real understanding. It's been a real in book of instruction. It's been instructions on our life. &gt;&gt; How many believes that &gt;&gt; it is instruction? And if you don't follow those instructions, how many knows most of the times when you don't follow the instructions, what happens? Chaos ensues. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. And that's why the people's lives are in chaos is because they don't read the instructions. When they get it together, the back wheels on the front, the handlebars are upside down. The chain won't fit. Hello. You forgot the sprockets. There's no sprockets for the chain. And oh my, you can't go nowhere. The only thing you can do is push the thing around. That's about the way people's lives are. You're pushing here and pushing there. It's a sweat. It's terrible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God expects his people, God expects humanity to have faith. Amen. He don't expect you to be smart. He don't expect you to be educated. &gt;&gt; He don't expect you to be intellectual. You don't have to have the college degree. He's not expecting any of that. When he chose his disciples, he chose people that couldn't sign their own name. He took the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. Amen. When that lame man walked, when Peter prayed for him, they had to take note that they had been with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. and they know somebody. They're in contact with somebody. And I believe that's the way it is with the believer this morning. That's the way we are supposed to be in contact with somebody. And that is the maker. Praise the Lord. Amen. So he says God does things in unusual ways because he is unusual himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is unusual. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the supernatural infinite. So anything he does is unusual. God is so great till he takes the unad identified things of the earth to identify himself by why he was preaching on why little Bethlehem. He says that's what we want to talk on God taking the things of the world because the scripture says by the foolishness of preaching it's please God to save them that believe. Ain't that right? Oh my. Now notice here. And we think it's good. God glorifies it. Now you pardon me. Amen. So is it today the story of the power of the Holy Ghost today upon the earth in the church is so unusual to the organization and the denominational mind. They don't want to believe it. It's too unusual. It's too fantastic. Amen. The Bible said that it would be that way. He says, "Many man has been tied up in some creed. Really wants to believe that, but it's so unusual. He just can't hardly tell it." Amen. He don't know what to do. He's in a predicament like Joseph was. And we'll get into that later. But let's talk about this unusual and how that God is in the unusual. Amen. Down further. One more. One more quote here. I know I had another one. He says that's where God dwells and that's where God dwells in the unusual to the carnal mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the unusual things that make him God. He goes to the unusual. He makes things unusual to the people. Yes, sir. Amen. So, get ready. One thing we learned as message believers is God dwells in simplicity. Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because people are always looking for great things. It's got to be great, great, great, great, great. No, God is in humility and he is in simplicity. Amen. Hides himself in simplicity. Brother Brandham preached a message and I didn't do you any study on it or get any pull quotes from it but you remember in the junction of time brother Brandham says it's at the junction of time that God always does the supernatural. Amen. He talked about a mason and how that anybody perhaps can lo lay block down that straight wall but when you come to a corner and you have to turn a corner that's a different story. &gt;&gt; Amen. And how many know God turns a lot of corners? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not all just a straight wall. No. How many knows the first one, Amen, that we want to talk about for just a minute was Noah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? God did something very unusual. &gt;&gt; Very unusual. The life was just going on. People were living their lives. They were building. They were marrying and giving in marriage, eating and drinking and everything was going like usual. Everything was so usual. There was no man the dew would come down so heavy at night and that it would water they needed. They never had a thunderstorm. They never had a tornado. They never had rain to come down out of the sky. I can't imagine that. Can you? That would be unprecedented. That's right. But guess what? One day, God come down and talked to Noah and said, "Noah, I want you to build an ark because the people have gotten wicked." &gt;&gt; Let me just stop there for a minute. Boy, oh boy, oh boy. Wouldn't we be a bunch of smart humans if we could just learn from history? &gt;&gt; But we stupid, we are stupid humans. Let me tell you something. Humanity is the most ignorant, stupid thing that I've ever met. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; They can be given warning. They can see the thunderstor clouds come, but they won't take any action. They can be told. They can be vindicated. It can be proven, and they still won't believe it. How dumb is that? &gt;&gt; You say stupid. Yeah, I mean it. blind. Isn't that right? I mean, Jesus can raise Lazarus from the dead. Nicodemus says, "We know that you're cleansed from God because of nobody but God. Somebody somebody from God could do that, but we still don't believe." In other words, if you go to hell, you're going to go stupid because you jumped over every barricade, every stop sign, everything God put there to stop you and you crawled your way to hell. &gt;&gt; And you ain't going to get over there and say, "Well, God, you're to blame." No, he says it's your stupidity. It's your ignorance. It's your own selfishness that got you there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of getting smart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you're stupid. You're dumb. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going to put it that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz even God himself said a fool. A fool called you a not stupid. You're a fool. A fool says in his heart there is no God. &gt;&gt; Amen. My &gt;&gt; hello. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So Lord help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. How many believes? Where is the wise? Where is the disputer of the world? Amen. &gt;&gt; God is the only one that's wise and he gives you wisdom. Young fellas, stay on the right course because I'm here to tell you this man probably here would be dead in the grave if God didn't give me a little bit of wisdom. &gt;&gt; If he didn't save my soul and help me to think, right, Tommy back there, right? &gt;&gt; Ain't no telling. It's It's a miracle we're here, right? Especially him. That's right. Do things come close to death. wrecks and drugs and everything else. But that's the grace of God. &gt;&gt; You got to jump a little. Say, "Thank you, Jesus. I'm glad I'm here. It was you that watched out for me." Anyway, that was not on the script at all. Maybe somebody needed that, but I just felt like saying that. Humanity. I don't have too much confidence in humanity. They don't even listen to their maker. They even don't even acknowledge they have a maker. Anybody that can look at the world and should know, hey, there's got to be somebody doing that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And then you want to say, "No, nobody's doing that. It was just by chance." There's only one word for you, and I'm not going to say it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. How many wants to be smart? &gt;&gt; Then read this. This will make you smart. Amen. &gt;&gt; This will give you wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. This will keep you alive. &gt;&gt; Young people. Amen. Oh, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right that you may live long upon the earth there. That's some good instructions right there. That's right. Go the other way and see how long you last. Not a good road. Amen. Praise the Lord, Noah. That's right. Something never happened. He said, "It's going to rain this whole place. It's going to rain till it's going to go beyond the highest mountain. It's going to rain." It seemed foolish to the carnal mind. It's unusual. Now, it had never happened before. I don't know that anybody had ever walked on water before, but Jesus did. He does things that's unusual. He can do anything. Ain't nobody that I know of ever created squirrels before, but I believe it. &gt;&gt; Stop the bull. Stop the horn and stop the storm. &gt;&gt; Hello. It was unusual. People have a hard time believing it. &gt;&gt; But told the story of, "Hey, I seen my dog there. The one that got poisoned. I seen my horse come up with nicker and give me some sugar. My dog come up by my side. Oh my, I hear my horse." Now, somebody said, "Brother B, I believe you're sorry until you talk about a horse being in heaven. Heaven ain't for no horses." Huh? Somebody stupid. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He says, "Okay, well, what about what those horses that came and got Elijah? What about the Bible that says when he comes from the heavens of heaven, him and all the hosts of heaven are going to come on white horses?" Shut up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Blew him away, didn't he? &gt;&gt; That's right. Bible talks about all kinds of horses. &gt;&gt; But what is it? Let me tell you something. Our preconceived ideas &gt;&gt; will not allow us to accept the unusual. We are so usual and such a trend until we can't accept when God does something &gt;&gt; off the books, so to speak, &gt;&gt; out of the our regular. Oh, God, help us. Help something unusual to happen here this morning. Why? Cuz if God is here, there's no telling what might happen. I like to just look around, man. Be expecting something unusual to happen. I mean, we got God here, you know. Ain't no telling what might happen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Sinners might come to God. People might repent and get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Hello. You never know. Somebody might come to the altar. Oh God, fill me with your spirit. &gt;&gt; This place might become smoky. Who knows? We might see a pillar of fire. There just ain't no telling what might happen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. I'm thankful that so many men God has brought along that have what we phrase as paved the way for us. &gt;&gt; In other words, like paving a road. They paved the way for you. Brother Bams call it, you know, those people that was even before him, maybe Luther and Wesley and Pentecost, they all come did things that hadn't been done before. The restoration of the gifts, they hadn't been done before, but it happened. Amen. Even the baptism in Jesus' name, Acts 2:38, everything with father, son, the holy ghost before then. Amen. and pave the way. Amen. But I want to say that we're still we're still in uncharted territory. &gt;&gt; In other words, it hasn't been mapped out. Uncharted. We're still in new places. I believe it. Solomon said that there's nothing that hadn't been before and so forth. And I thought, well, how can we be uncharted territory if there's nothing happening hasn't happened before? We're at the end of the world. Yeah, Noah was at the end of the world. Sure, but it was different. Why? Because then God just overflowed the earth with water. He just washed it off with water. You and I are not at that place. &gt;&gt; We're at the place, Amen, better call it the end times. We're at the end of the end when God is going to take this whole thing and he's going to change it. He's going to lift the curse this time. The curse wasn't lifted last time. He's going to lift the curse. Amen. We're going to go out into a millennium. There's going to be an ushering in of the millennium. &gt;&gt; We're going to go out on a new heaven and a new earth. We're going to We're here at the end of the world &gt;&gt; as we know it. &gt;&gt; Living in a Satan's Eden, most evil age that there ever was. And yet at the same time, living in the most brightest hour there ever was. Amen. &gt;&gt; Unusual. We're in an unusual place. &gt;&gt; This is not where we are usually. Sure, it was wicked. Sure, it's a lot the same, but yet it's a little different. Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all forgive me. I'm going to try this fan a little bit. Would that be all right? If it don't make you too too if it's not too much noise. Amen. We'll see if we can do that right there. Thank you, Jesus, for our fan. Amen. Last Sunday, I was just drenched in sweat and kind of running down. I says, "Well, why do you want to do that when they make perfectly good batteries and fans?" You know, it just isn't quite hot cold enough up here for me. Amen. Amen. But anyway, so praise the Lord. So look, there's one Noah unusual. And like brother Bram said, talking about the power of the Holy Ghost upon the earth is so unusual that the organizations can't comprehend it. They just can't grasp it. And I've thought about different times that I've tried to witness to people and you'll talk and you'll give them and you'll tell them about the acts of the prophet. Hello. You tell them about the pillar of fire and how that that's the only picture that was taken. Hello. And you begin to testify the power of God and people shrug back. What? Cuz how many know people have a hard time believing that God sent a prophet. It's so unusual &gt;&gt; and it really blows them their mind when he says organization and denomination he condemned all of it. He brought us back to the word. He had thus said the Lord and you tell them story after story. Amen. Or a prophet visits South Africa and a lot of Amish a lot of folks will just look at the man and oh he's got a necktie on. That ain't no God man of God. Is that right Woody? You got a neck tie on that ain't no man of God. Get it away from me. Why? Because I'm talking about they're so blinded in their mind. They have such preconceived ideas that when something like that comes and you tell them about the crowds that he had in Africa and India and 30,000 and challenging the Hindu and the Buddha and the Muslim and all of them and saying, "Let them come up any of your gods." Amen. Buddha or any of them come up here and open this blind man's eyes and I'll serve your God. But in my Jesus will come who I proclaim, who I represent, if he'll come and do it, will you serve him? Hey, below. You try to tell people that try to tack people's attention. Try to open up their minds so they'll say yes. Yes, Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; That's what we need. &gt;&gt; It's so unusual to hear of a prophet. It's been nearly 2,000 years since we had one. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many knows, brother Bram said that those were reformers? He called those reformers. Luther, Wesley, and all of them reformers, but we hadn't had a prophet for about this long if I'm not sure if I I'm if I'm right. I think he said like right since the time of Paul. That's a long time. Not 400 years like Israel. Almost 2,000. Why do you think you're so blessed? &gt;&gt; Why do you think I'm so blessed that you've got thus sayeth the Lord? You've got a vindicated word of God. &gt;&gt; That's what's in your hand. That's what's in my hand. &gt;&gt; And it gives us a weapon against the devil. &gt;&gt; It's our weapon against It's an atomic bomb. It's what gives you faith. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says the opening of the eyes of the blind and all these things ought to give you rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to read you something. I was back there reading when brother Steve come back there and got me and I was just looking at a little bit just opened the the book and somebody had said something about this and in just one of the cases he says those born blind receive their sight. After praying for one totally blind man, brother Brandham said to him walk up there to the pulpit and put your finger on that preacher's nose. He walked straight up to the minister, then pulled his nose, causing the audience to laugh. Hello. That's the kind of miracles that happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. No such a thing as a hard case with God. A lady from Greece who had no opening uh in her throat entered the prayer line. She could not swallow a single drop of water or any kind of food. As soon as brother Brandham prayed for her, she drank a glass of water and ate candy. A candy bar. Amen. A night or two later in the same meetings, nine deaf and dumb mutes came into prayer line and all nine were healed. Amen. You can tell them about the power of God and they just can't fathom it. Well, it didn't come to our church. It didn't come the way we thought it ought to come. I mean know that that was the scribes and Pharisees problems. They were the old bottles and that Jesus just could not put new wine, no new stimulation cuz their hearts have been hardened. Ain't that right? They had hard hearts. God has to make you a new bottle. Amen. And put that stimulation of new revelation in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then it expands. &gt;&gt; Never put a period behind what you believe. They put a period behind what they believe. Amen. That was what their problem was. It was too unusual. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So many so many cases. Amen. In all these different junctions of time, can you imagine when Samson come with a jawbone of a mule when he begin to beat him down? I imagine them Philistines, they were pretty surprised, huh? After about 400 of them got killed and the word got back to their captain, hey, we have lost 400 and we can't beat these Israelites. The captain says, well, how many is there? Uh, there's just one. Just what? I didn't hear you right. 1,000 100,000. What is it? No, one. There's just one manise. And after about a thousand dying, they said, "Hey, we can't beat this man." Hallelujah. Unprecedented, unusual. That's what God loves to do. He loves when you have faith in him for the unusual. &gt;&gt; Now, most of the time, we want things to be in the Bible, right? Sure. But how many things did God do that he hadn't done before? Amen. &gt;&gt; He can do anything. &gt;&gt; Expect it in your life. &gt;&gt; Expect it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Think about this. Remember when Nathan and Kora when they rose up and did what they did, Amen. And Moses begin to tell them what's going to happen. He says, "Hereby know, ye shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them of my own hand. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then the Lord has not sent me." In other words, if you die an old man, but if the Lord shall make a new thing, Amen. and the earth opened her mouth and swallow them up and all that that pertains unto them and they go down quick into the pit. I have a question. I maybe maybe the answer's in there, but how did po how did uh Moses know or was he just prophetically speaking? Huh? Because how many knows? He says, "If the earth opens it up and they go down quick into the pit, then shall ye understand that these men have provoked the Lord." And it came to pass as he has made an end of speaking all these words that the ground claims under. &gt;&gt; Hello. That was under them. and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up. Their houses and all the men that are pertained to Kora and all their goods. They and all that pertain to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the congregation. Hello. God did a new thing. I don't know if there ever had been a time before Sodom and Gomorrah that God rained fire out of heaven and destroyed those cities. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says in the tribulation period when God destroys that great harlot with fire and so forth, he says it'll be a weight of a 100 pounds. I believe a fire come down. Imagine something traveling at 100 something 100 pounds. Amen. Traveling at a great speed. Don't think you're gonna hide. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Things that he had never judgment that hadn't come before. It was water before fire. God does new things sometimes even with judgment. God did a new thing when he uh called Abraham to come and follow him. Isn't that right? Something new, something different. All in the all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. There Abraham was out there. Isn't that right? God come down and showed himself to Abraham when he when they visited the wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah and Lot was down there. It was something people hadn't expected when Jesus, let's go all the way to Jesus. When Jesus came, think about when Christ came. Let me just read it the way that the Bible says it. He was in the world. The world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came to his own and his own received him not. What a terrible picture. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them to them that believe on his name. the very God of heaven come to the earth, the one that made them and they couldn't receive him because they had their own ideas. They were in such a form, brother Bam said, a preconceived idea. How many believes it's important to have your heart open? &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes we think we might have it all figured out, but be careful. Oh, God is unusual. &gt;&gt; Why do we think so? Why do we look so close at at that woman in purple? Cuz it's easy to miss it. &gt;&gt; It's not hard to miss it. The Pope going to Rome out of America. That That's pretty pretty plain there, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Pope right out of America. Right there you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you aren't watchful, you'll miss it. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many wants to say, "Lord, I don't want to miss the rapture. &gt;&gt; I want to be ready. I believe God has provided us the means to be ready." &gt;&gt; That is the message of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; And his own received him not. Okay. Now, you no wonder when you carry the flat gospel and see the Holy Ghost come in and make it manifest amongst an old-fashioned bunch of people, it's foreign to you. It's hard for you to believe it. Amen. As I said the other night about Joseph, it was hard for him to think that Mary being pregnant, how could she be that, a holy woman like that? and she said that Gabriel had visited her. How many know Joseph had a hard time believing Mary's story? &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, he had a little bit of a question about whether an Gabriel Gabriel who right Gabriel who he was mind it he had it in his mind to put her away. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? He doubted it. He had a hard time believing that because why it was so unusual, Brother Ram says it wasn't usual at all. And even though perhaps there's a scripture pointing to it, a virgin shall conceive. Perhaps he knew that, but nah, it just wouldn't happen to my wife. It wouldn't happen to my virgin. Amen. about like the devil tries to tell you and I sometimes ah you aren't going to make that rapture. &gt;&gt; There's only two of them that ever went into the rapture. Ain't that right? That were ever translated. So it won't be unprecedented. It has been done before. But folks, I don't know about God's going to do it again. How many believe God is going to do it again? And I plan on being one of them. And I plan on you being one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had a hard time with it. Joseph did. As a matter of fact, he took an angel took an angel to come to Joseph's and say, "Don't be afraid to take unto thee, Mary, thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Then he was okay with it. Kind of like we are. Oh, it might have a hard time with, oh, there's no eternal hell or this, that, or the other, but it's thus saith the Lord. So, I accept it. People have a hard time with doctrines, but Jesus comes and vindicates it. That should take care of your doubt. But it's hard. It's hard for people to believe that God came and did what he did. That he actually sent Malachi 4 to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers &gt;&gt; to restore us back to the faith in the most evil, the most wicked age of all. The miracle is what I'm looking at right there. I'm looking at a miracle. Every one of us is a miracle. &gt;&gt; I don't know where Devin and Jana are, but them and Glenn and Sherry and them that's just recently come to the message now. It's awful long. How many believe it's a miracle that they can believe? Even Sherry has testified there for a while. She was a little bit questioned, you know, whatever, but she finally got the revelation &gt;&gt; and she testified. I finally got it. Yeah, I believe God has sent us a prophet. We needed it. &gt;&gt; It takes a opening of God take it takes God to open up the mind, the heart to able to accept something so unusual. &gt;&gt; Man is so duped in their tradition with the God. Every last Amish menite and all of them could hear this this morning. God don't ask nobody what to do. He does it who he wants, where he wants, how he wants. And he don't come to fit the way you think he ought to do it. You have to come to thinking and understanding and believing the way that God does it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's important. That's an important thing to humanity, to church religions, is don't think that God has to do it the way you think he has to do it. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. It was so unusual. It was so unusual for a thing like that. It never had happened before. But brother Bam says that's where God dwells. He takes the unusual things, the unthought of things. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now the resurrection, he says, was unusual to many of his people that loved him. Yet it was the promised word, but too too unusual to believe. I think brother Brad may have wr uh read this Wednesday and it's found in Mark. I believe it is. Let me find this. Matthew Mark. Now when Jesus was risen early, the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene. out of whom he had cast seven devils. And she went and told them that had been with him. So as they mourned and wept, Amen. What'd you tell them? He's risen. &gt;&gt; He's risen. And they when they heard it that he was alive and had been seen of her, believed not. In Luke, he puts it this way. It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles, and their words seemed to them as idol tales, and they believed them not. Then Jesus says, "I'm going to rise again the third day." He even told him that right? Sometimes it's hard to say yes Lord. Yes. Sometimes God will tell you no and you have a hard time saying yes. Amen. All right. And afterwards that he appeared in another form unto two of them that was Cleopus I believe it was that was going to as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it to the residue neither believe they them. Amen. And afterwards he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat and upraded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because beloved they believed not them which had been seen of him after he was risen. See the resurrection brother Bam says the people that loved him could not believe it &gt;&gt; because he was unusual. &gt;&gt; You mean he rose from the dead? And this is where my name gets a little black mark. Thomas. Yeah. I hate that. Every time you say Thomas, especially preaching you, we know where you going there. That's right. Thomas, he was man stubborn. He was like, "No, I'm not believing it. It ain't true. ain't so I'll have to put my fingers in his side and I'll have to fing feel his hands. Amen. Before I believe there's some good things said about Thomas. I when one of the disciples or when somebody was dying, he said, "Let's go down and die with him." But in this case, he just would not believe. I don't know if brother Brad said it or not, but Thomas wasn't Yeah, I think he did. I remember. He said, "Thomas wasn't the only one that wasn't believing the air, right?" &gt;&gt; He wasn't the only one not believing. We just read it. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't believe and wouldn't believe. They just had a hard time believing it. &gt;&gt; Thomas is just, "Hey, this just comes fresh. Comes fresh." Thomas, he's just got he just got a little bit more vehement about it. I'm going to have to put my fingers in his eye. The rest of them didn't believe it. He says, "I'm gonna have to touch him. I'm gonna have to feel him." And remember when Jesus appeared and he says, "Come here, Thomas. Put your hands here. Feel me here." And Thomas fell down and he can preach to a lot of trinitarians. He preached the sermon. Thomas did when he fell down on his he says, "My Lord and my God." &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, he's called him God. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; You don't believe he was God. Jesus never disputed it. He was right in line. Amen. Praise the Lord. So unusual. God does things in unusual ways. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, never before had a mule talked to what was his name? &gt;&gt; Balum. Balum. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Balum. Stubborn old guy. I mean, stubborn. I said that word stubborn. He was stubborn. He wouldn't listen to God, right? He wanted to curse Israel and all these other things. And I just want to say this that I I I'll call call it some brother Danny Steven had a lot of trouble in his church one time and there was some somebody that said that you've got witches in your church. You've got witches in your church. and he can figure out just well I don't see him practicing witchcraft or anything but you know but the Bible says that stubbornness stubbornness is as the sin of witchcraft. Hello. How many knows? Don't ever be stubborn. Be careful not to be stubborn. Oh, he ain't going to tell me. Watch out. &gt;&gt; God hates his stubborn spirit. &gt;&gt; It's a terrible sin. &gt;&gt; No wonder you got trouble when you've got a bunch of stubborn people in. They they back up on you. They'll lock up on you. They won't amen. They're nothing but a wet rag in the church. You're going to have problems. &gt;&gt; How many believes when somebody comes in here, Amen, with a critical attitude, stubborn spirit, you're going to have problems. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Off that little rabbit trail. Maybe somebody needed that. Lord, help us never to be stubborn. &gt;&gt; Amen. But baam, he was woo. I'll tell you what, he ought to have gotten down on his knees and prayed. Ain't that right? Cuz that mule talked to him. He says, "Haven't I served you all these days?" Then why you beat me? Huh? That's right. God didn't have to animate it. Brother Troy didn't have to animate that little opening his lips moving. God moved his lips and he spoke out of his mouth talking to him. &gt;&gt; God can use whatever he wants to use. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says God will use whatever part of you give him. If you give him his heart, your mind, your soul, your singing, he says your voice, whatever you give to God, God can use. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On and on and on. It was unexpected. The coming of Christ was so different than what the scribes and Pharisees had. Him coming down on a red carpet. Isn't that right? and embracing KF as hey you are my guys. Guess what? I have come down and we're going to wipe these Romans up off of here. That's kind of what they thought. They was going to come back as a warrior and clean them off and then restore them. But no, he didn't come that way at all. No red carpet come under a bad name. A woman that got pregnant before she was married. Amen. They called him illegitimate. born. We be not born of fornication is what they said. &gt;&gt; How many knows? Can you imagine the Pharisees being so proud until they thought themselves better than Jesus? They thought they were better than Jesus. They had no problem disputing him. That's why when I hear preachers in this message, Amen. trying to talk, oh, brother Brennan was wrong on this, that, or the other, and he hadn't have a right. Who in the world do you think you are? &gt;&gt; You sure don't have my confidence, cuz you sure ain't got no vindication. He had vindication. &gt;&gt; And you'd be in a different ball of wax if he was still here. &gt;&gt; I'd like to drag their sorry hides up in front of the prophet. Say, "Here, you tell him what you told me. You tell him about those wrong dates. Here he is. &gt;&gt; No, they'd be scratching, clawing, getting back out of there. They wouldn't have the nerve. &gt;&gt; They might. They might be dumb enough. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To do it because Brother Bam says those folks, those 90 70 ministers were smarter than I thought &gt;&gt; then to come up there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because it'd have been stupid. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yep. to come on up there. &gt;&gt; And so is it stupid to refute the prophet after he's gone. &gt;&gt; I can't help but think that God's going to turn it up a little bit for you. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's going to be bad. It's going to be bad. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Unusual. That's right. Luther was unusual to the Catholic Church. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. the boldness that he had to pack noses up and start a reformation. &gt;&gt; Wesley was unusual to the Lutheran. Huh? No, you can't just live by faith, but you've got to be sanctified. You got to live a holy life. You can't drink that beer, smoke that cigarette, huh? Can't dip that snuff. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? We're way down the road from that church. You can't just speak in tongues and live out and live on out there. &gt;&gt; We can't live like the Pentecostals lived. We've come further than that. &gt;&gt; You can't just go to church and be a good church member. You won't make it unless the literal life of Jesus Christ is living in you every day. &gt;&gt; You'll miss the rapture shares the world. Glory's required of us &gt;&gt; then it was of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Live a holy life. Live pure for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I like what Matthew preached here the other night about that justification. Never done it in the first place. Never done it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what we are. I love what brother Brad says. You are the pure, virtuous, sinless, spotless bride of Jesus Christ. If you have shand those denomination, if you are believing every word, you are spotless. You're sinless. You're virtuous. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Turn the corner. &gt;&gt; God keeps turning corners. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God takes us higher and higher and higher. Brother Bam says, "Now the devil fights this wonderful truth of divine healing. Someday the church is going to wake up to the fact and realize that the very greatest things that he they had the greatest blessings outside of salvation that they've turned it down. How many know a lot of them believed that in in salvation, but they said the days of miracles is passed. God don't fil with the Holy Ghost anymore. God don't do miracles anymore. God don't heal anymore. They turn it down. Many times I found the heathens over there in Africa. Amen. Because the missionary told them the days of miracles is passed. And the poor fellow is walking around packing mud idols trying to get healing through mud idols because they know that their fathers got winked at their ignorance had healed them through believing in the God of the mud idol. Amen. Don't even ask me. But these folks, they could just go out there and they would believe and God honored their faith. God might give you some I mean not God but the doctor might give you some kind of a just a water pill of some kind and you believe that you're going to get better. You take it and you believe it. You probably get better. Why? Not because of that, but because you believe. But anyway, brother Bam saying here that they got I healed through their mud lles. But the theology of preachers today, the churches and things that deny the power of God. Now notice, friend, now it's strange that brother Brandon would go into this. Now I'm going to I'm going to take this for the next 15 minutes if I could. He goes into notice, friend, one day, for instance, he says the like the electric lights. There was a time when a man would have thought that if if they'd have told somebody 500 years ago that they'd have electric light like that, that person would have said that person's crazy. &gt;&gt; Hello. 500 years ago. Then he said, "Look," and I don't know, buddy, but I'm here to tell you I thank God for Thomas Edison. Is &gt;&gt; that right? crazy. Listen, but they have electric lights. And that person would have said, "All right, but there was a man one time way down in his heart that he could reach electricity." And talking about Benjamin from Franklin, he says he got a kite and a key and fished it out of disguise. Benjamin did. He says, "And it hit into that bottle and he stopped it up." What good did it do to stop up the bottle? He thought he had it. He began to scream, "I got it. I got it." He had it, but he didn't know what he had. And that's what's the church is. The matter with the church today, they've got some, but they don't know what they got. &gt;&gt; How many would say, and and another quote he says, "But Bram says, that's all they know really is that they got it." Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't know a whole lot if all you know is you got it. &gt;&gt; It's good to have it, but I want to know what I got. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to talk that I'm going to preach that probably for the next several times. And if you know talking about what we got, what do you got in your hand? &gt;&gt; What do you got, people? &gt;&gt; Amen. Didn't know what he had. That's where the church is now. As long as he had it, he could rejoice and say, "I know it's there. I feel it. I know I got it. It's there." What was the concept? The concept with Bjamin Franklin is is I know that somehow you can take that power and run it through something. Isn't that right? He got it in a bottle and he thought he had a little electricity. I doubt there was any electricity in there, do you? But he thought he had it. But that was his concept. Another man come along by the name of Thomas Edison come along after Benjamin Franklin and said that he could make it light up. There was something in him that told him that he could make make it light up to help mankind. Wow. Think of the electric every portion of electric motors, electric engines, jet engines, whatever it might be. All because of that man. Isn't that right? Believing that it could be. Amen. I hope you're reading between the lines. Amen. One of these days when we have a new body, &gt;&gt; when we're over there, we're going to say, you know, I knew it. I just knew it was there. &gt;&gt; We held on. We kept going. We kept searching. We kept saying, God, purify my heart. Had me ready for that time. I know it's possible. I know the body change is possible. &gt;&gt; I know we can change in the atoms &gt;&gt; because we can change our character by the power of God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. So he says he could make it light up. So he sat at his desk for tens of thousands of wires tried to make that electric current flow and on and on. tireless hours, nights, and people calling them crazy and everything else. But there's something on the inside of him told him that that electric would light up. Amen. Amen. See, Brother Bam says, "When I first started out in this ministry, he was reading about something about a little baby to eat erasers off of a pencil or a pedal off of a bicycle. When it took the little fella in to examine him to found out that that little boy needed sulfur, see, he's made out of the elements of the earth. That baby's body originally come from the earth where sulfur is, and there's something in there calling for that sulfur." He says there's got to be a sulfur out there to respond to that call. If there's a deep calling, there's got to be a deep to respond. Amen. Now again, he talks about Edison rather. He tried wire after wire and finally he found the right wire that would light up. It's got to be there. If something inside of him told him it would be there, it's got to be there. How many believes, amen, before we take a translation, before we get to that place to be pleasing to the Lord and Amen and walk like Enoch walked, have you gotten that hunger this morning? Have you gotten that deep? Do you believe that we can go further than anybody else has ever went? &gt;&gt; How many believe that the saints that have gone on are waiting for you and I to come to that place &gt;&gt; ready for the rapture? I believe it's there. We're longing for it. &gt;&gt; We're hungering for it, for that body change. But there's got to be a longing for it, a call for it first. Now, notice what brother Bam says. First of all, we realize, Brother Bam says, you know, just like television, television was here since Adam and Eve. Electricity was here since Adam and Eve. the cell phones were here. I don't know. I don't know how they have all these millions and millions and millions of peoples and everybody has a different number and they can make that all work. I don't know. But it's magic. It's pretty phenomenal. And it goes up to satellite, right? &gt;&gt; Maybe you know more about it than I do. I don't know much about it, but I ain't got no line land line anymore. So, it's got to go shooting, bouncing off of something. That's a lot of signals bouncing off of stuff. But that was always here. It's just that somebody discovered it and somebody now look, oh my. You don't need no uh library with world history. What is it called? Like encyclopedia. That's right. I don't have my phone here, but just say the word. There's your encyclopedia is right in your hands. I guess the whole w everything they put on the internet. I don't know if it's all the wisdom of the world or not, but all of that stuff is right there. Amen. And it always was. Amen. I I'm sure glad brother Bennett picked up. He says, you know, how that television uh you know, like Marilyn Monroe, those those hero voice is still going through there. Those and the pictures are still going there. He says, "That's the way that God records our every action. &gt;&gt; Our every action." He records and it's put it on a record. It's still there. It's never going to be erased. That's always going to be there. That's recorded. Every emotion you have. Amen. Lord Jesus, forgive me of all my sins and shortcomings. Lord, fill me with your spirit. Lord, cleanse my heart from all unbelief. I accept what you did for me on Calvary. Let that be recorded. Ain't that right? Because brother Bam did talk about an eraser. Something that stops that record. And that's the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Erases all that, erases your past. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, in in closing here and friends, for 20 years since I've been a Christian, I believe that there was a God that's just as real as the light is on my hand. &gt;&gt; There's a power of God in this room tonight to heal every sick person in here. &gt;&gt; Open every blinded eye. Unstop every deaf ear. Make every lame man leap with a heart. saved a sinner, sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost. Every believe he's here, &gt;&gt; just as real as can be. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, I think any preacher that's worth any dime, Amen, believes in tries to get the people. I know just a couple weeks ago, I felt like the Holy Spirit fell on me. Amen. It just said, "Anybody that really believes it, receive your healing now." He's right here right now. &gt;&gt; How many believe that doesn't change from two weeks ago? He's still right here right now. That presence is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. when that chaplain went to that I'm not sure if he was a he was some kind of a captain. I read it about a week ago when he was dying. He was wounded. He had been shot across the chest. He was dying, bleeding out. He says, "Remember where you left him. Remember where you left him." I want to make a point this morning. I didn't really finish that, but we'll leave that alone. But and there at the end, he finally remembered where he left him and a smile came over him. Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray thee, Lord, my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray thee, Lord, my soul to take. this morning, just in the last week, I feel like the Lord's given me a little revelation that you don't realize, you don't realize how powerful your words of repentance are. &gt;&gt; When you say, "Lord Jesus, I haven't lived the way that I should. I've done wrong. I ask you to forgive me." You might not feel anything. You might not. But if that's coming from your heart, let me tell you something. That's powerful. Don't think that it doesn't make a difference. It does make a difference. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I want to be filled with the Holy Ghost." If you truly do, go before the Lord. Say the words. Repent. Speak those words of confession. Amen. Heal me, Lord. I believe that you by your stripes, I am healed. &gt;&gt; Give me faith to believe it, Lord. &gt;&gt; They're powerful. And I guess the thought that came to me was Jesus went to Calvary. He s those stripes was put on his back. And when one sinner &gt;&gt; needs some of that, he's listening, &gt;&gt; young people, he's listening. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Just comes to mind seeing Courtney there. I don't think she'll mind, but we know that we had a little scare with her. Isn't that right? was a little scare about the C-word and we were all praying Lord don't let it be that Lord just and and guess what the report came back &gt;&gt; that it's not Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. We thank God for that. That's great news. That's something to give God praise about. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Every day I thank God for my wife back there. Amen. You know, we we we sometimes say say it a lot. Talk about it. But Tommy sitting there, doctor said, "You'd never lift over what, five, 10 pounds. Never get off of that." That's a miracle sitting there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, I believe that God deserves the glory. &gt;&gt; And I believe the devil deserves the black eye. Hallelujah. Say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus." That's right, devil. You ain't got no rights here. Faith up in this house. We believe Jesus in this house. &gt;&gt; That's right. The devil, we'll just rub it in his face. will keep mentioning it because we like to rub it in the devil's face that he is not stronger than our God. &gt;&gt; We don't have to fear him. &gt;&gt; We don't have to be afraid of him because if we have been taught by the messenger of this hour and brother Bham says don't bring no new don't bring no 22 to the fight. &gt;&gt; Don't bring your ARs. Don't bring your cannons. Hello. Don't bring your bunker busters. They're powerful. Most powerful weapon, I guess, outside of a nuke. I still can't imagine that bunker buster that we blew up over there just the other day. Enormous amount of weight going 170 200 feet into ground. I can't imagine anything going 200 feet in the ground through whatever it is, steel, concrete, reinforced, it's going down and then it's blown up. &gt;&gt; Oh man, don't get me going. Then the critic said, "But he didn't do anything." Yeah, right. Something's going to happen. Whole thing's going to come down. &gt;&gt; But what is out? What am I trying to say this morning? Don't bring your bunk. Don't bring your little weapons. What is it that you have in your hand? Evening light tabernacle. What is it that we have in our hand? I'll tell you what's been given to our hand. The vindicated word of God of thus sayaith the Lord that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Boom. Nuke that devil says you've got a nuclear bomb. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53-6. Amen. He was wounded for our transgression, bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace is upon him and by his strip we are boom healed. Blow him away. You got a nuclear bomb. That's what we have in our hands. a God that came down and said ma Hebrews 13:8 that he is not dead. He's not in an age gone by. &gt;&gt; He is alive &gt;&gt; and he's the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it means to me when you say the same. That means he's alive and well and waiting for your confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. How many believe this morning that there's something in the making? &gt;&gt; We're turning a corner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're turning another corner. I'll tell you what I see. You know what I see? I see an army rising up. &gt;&gt; Young people rising up. &gt;&gt; Amen. That believe the word of God. I see an invincible army rising up. &gt;&gt; That's what I see. Because I'll tell you this right now, he's given us an invincible word. &gt;&gt; How many believe the word is invincible? &gt;&gt; He brought us back to the pure word of God. &gt;&gt; Why do you think that it's so important to not believe in three different gods? Because as long as you believe in three different gods, you're still messed up. If you believe in a triune baptism, you're still messed up. But he came and restored the word. &gt;&gt; If you want to be invincible, Gideon, God has given you what you need. The Bible and the message of the hour. You know, I call it the message, but I believe that when God give us the messages, all the messages came from God to give you the power to live a victorious life. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. [Applause] Amen. Praise the Lord. [Music] Land, I'm longing for you. There's a deep calling. We don't want to be tied to this earth. How many's looking for that ber long? And someday on thee I'll stand [Applause] there. My hope shall be eternal. [Music] la land. Sweet bula land. Amen. Stand with me this morning. Bow your heads. Search your hearts. Ask yourself, are you ready to meet the Lord this afternoon? If this afternoon is when he comes. If he comes by 2:00, are you ready? If you're not ready, come up here and we'll pray with you. You can confess your sins to say, "God, I want to be right. I'm not right and I want to be right. I want to be right right now." Jesus will hear your prayer. He'll forgive you of your sins and your shortcomings. He'll do it. [Music] Amen. I'm glad I'm glad that all of you feel like you're ready to go if he comes. Amen. But if you're not, as your pastor, I just want to make sure. Amen. How many wants to be that? No. Every day you want to be ready if he was to come in the next minute. God bless you, Lord Jesus. We bow our heads to you today. And we thank you, Lord, for what you do. Lord, when you saved each one of us, when we think back of what you did, Lord, it was unusual. But God, we thank you for being such an unusual God. Lord, Father, things that we didn't expect to happen, yet it did. You came and saved a wretch like me. Didn't deserve it. Wasn't worthy of it. Nothing that I did. Nothing that any of us did to merit salvation. But yet, you saved us. And we want you to know that. We thank you, Father, for that, Lord. And we ask, God, that you would bless each and every one under the sound of my voice, Lord, to be ready for that rapture that lays ahead, God. This world is damned. This world is doomed. But God, we have another world that we're going going to go into, Lord, that is not damned, that is not doomed, but it's heaven. We'll have a house not made with hands, eternal into heavens, a new body, Father, a body like unto your own glorious body, Lord. And we're longing for it. We're groaning for it. There's a deep calling for it. And that's why we sing that song, Bula Land. I'm longing for you, Lord. Prepare every heart, every hand that's raised. Go down to that heart. forgive any transgressions, any sins. Wash us white in the blood of the lamb. Let us go out these doors. Father, though our sins be red like crimson, when we leave this place, Lord, they'll be white as snow because we confess, Lord, we are faulty. We have our failures, Lord. And we ask forgiveness. And Lord, we thank you for the infilling of your spirit that convicts us, Lord, and that speaks to our hearts, Lord. We thank you for this morning's service, Lord, and for your Holy Spirit that comes and speaks to us, Lord, and teaches us your ways and the ways that you are. That we are not to try to mold you into what we think, but we are to mold our minds to what you say and the way that you think. Lord, bless every heart now this morning in a special way. All of our young people, Lord, hold them in the palm of your hand. Lord, with all that's out there, Lord, we ask God that you give them strength of the Holy Spirit to walk daily. Lord Jesus, let there be no evil among them, no wickedness among them, no bad spirit, Lord, but a spirit of Christianity and love and gentleness, meekness and humility. For we ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. you the land I'm longing for you [Music] and someday [Music] only I'll stay [Music] there My hope shall be turn sweet [Music] land. I'm kind of home.
