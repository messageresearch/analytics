[27:04] evening
[27:06] twisting the more that I Surrender
[27:09] I was thinking about this song today and
[27:12] I looked up what's the universal sign
[27:14] for surrender and it's Palms open hands
[27:17] up over your head and I was thinking
[27:19] sometimes when we come to church we're
[27:21] tired and we don't feel like praising
[27:23] the Lord or worshiping but sometimes we
[27:25] can just surrender and see what the Lord
[27:27] can do through US amen
[27:29] yes
[27:30] the more that I
[27:34] surrendered
[27:37] the lighter
[27:41] [Music]
[27:43] the more that
[27:46] I release my curse the more you take
[27:52] control
[27:54] the more that I
[27:57] [Music]
[28:00] the more you lift me up
[28:05] every day I live
[28:10] Lord I love you more
[28:17] and it's the more that I Surrender
[28:25] [Music]
[28:30] the more that I
[28:34] don't really smart IT cares the more you
[28:39] take control
[28:41] [Music]
[28:42] the more that I can humble myself
[28:48] the more he lifts me up
[28:54] every day I live
[28:58] the Lord I love you more
