sorry about or to feel sorry for you've come to the wrong place because I tell we're here tonight to draw strength from one another we're here tonight to lift up each other we're here to let Satan know you've picked on the wrong [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] of already there's people praying all around the country all around the world brother Ron Spencer brother Donnie Reagan brother Ted Pedley down in Florida around world there's prayers are going forth we're B getting stronger in the word somebody said I'm excited about tonight I am too you know why because we're going to see God in action [Music] tonight Isaiah 53 he was despised and re rejected a man of acquainted with grief and he was hid as our faces from him was despised and esteemed him not borne our griefs he's carried our sorrows yet did esteem him stricken smitten of God what's it say but he was wounded for our he was bruised for our the chastisement of our peace your peace him and by his stripes [Music] everyone everyone can be healed tonight now I want you to think about this this scripture we can look at it in many different ways but as I we look at this tonight I want you to see a scene of a battle this is a battle taking place we see an innocent all Mighty God who has stepped into the flesh a God who had left the Splendor of Heaven A God who had stepped down knowing that there was a battle ahead he knew that there was a battle for sickness he knew that there was a battle for depression he knew there was a battle for broken heartness he knew there was a battle for those that were cast down for those who were lost he knew that there was a battle and this battle was a battle that no mortal man could take on his own shoulder you can't do it I can't do it it the prophet couldn't do it but God Almighty by his stripes we are [Music] healed this scripture describes what the weight of the world must have felt like on one man's shoulders I can only imagine Monday that report come in how the weight of the world must have fell on their weight of the world must on their shoulders I talked to and he said when I caught him he said I'm just picking myself up off the floor you know there's a saying it says if I fall let me fall on my back because if I get up keep looking to Jesus Keep who can who can fix the problem but you know sister Donna she didn't come here tonight to weep no she didn't come here tonight to weat she didn't come here for you to feel sorry no she came to fight that's a [Applause] fight when Jo we got the phone call from Brother B and I I begin to explain to Jo what he had told me looked at each other in utter shock and and and just unbelief of what we were hearing I said I think you better call sister Donna and she said what will I say I said you'll know and she dialed the phone she said sister Donna this is Jo just calling the CH and let me tell you my wife didn't have to say nothing and she just kept talking and talking looked at the she she pointed at the phone are you hearing this yeah I'm hearing I'm I'm following along she was not defeated Believers don't know the word defeat Believers don't know how to quit Believers refuse to lose so don't cry for her you see because no doubt a diagnosis can be frightening when you hear it you're frightened it can be frightening but I do know this too a diagnosis in reality to a Believer is no more than one man's opinion I'm in the medical field and I've done come to find out that a diagnosis is nothing more than one man's opinion you say well what about the prognosis let me tell you what a prognosis is it's a speculation of what they think might happen they're speculating I don't speculation I deal with facts and the facts tell me that God has the answers facts tell me that I know a god who's never lost a fight facts tell me we know a God that hears our cries the facts tell me that God has fought a battle and won the war how many believes that tonight how many believes we can overcome tonight brother brandham said the angel of the Lord came to me and he said a supernatural being came walking into the room and he said an angel said he was sent from the very presence of God he began to sit there he said he looked at him and he said if you can get the people to believe if you can get the people to believe would and would be sincere when you pray nothing did you hear what I said nothing that means heart trouble cancer diabetes eye trouble back trouble high blood no blood nothing he said could stand before your prayer not even cancer [Applause] his next statement was and thousands have been healed how many Believers are here tonight how many look at the hand building let me tell you that portals of Heaven are open tonight and Angels the building and they're waiting to hear the commands of God's people they're waiting to hear what our request is if that promise was good for brother that promise is good for us if his stripes would heal then his stripes will heal [Applause] now when I got that phone call from Brother Bor I knew I knew there was a problem and he began to tell me and and he began to tell me the what the situation was and emotions began to run through through my head many emotions begin to run through my head sorrow grief compassion hurt but what more as I thought more about it was I was angry that Satan come and lay his hands on not not not any of any any of our people here I was that he could come and begin to torment and to grab a hold and to put into place that he could begin to torture should we say yeah sister Donna the study on Sunday she didn't know what was wrong she said but it's like a hot it's me that made me angry and I begin to think as I thought about this has come to my mind when when Japan begin to put their raid out on Pearl Harbor and they begin to pack it every angle and that's what sister Donna said she said it hits me here it hits me there it hits me she said it's like a hot iron just searing and twisting and Japan put that out there on Pearl to Pearl Harbor and begin to attack but you know what they found out they begin to look and they realize and Yamamoto said I'm afraid we have awakened a sleeping giant Satan hear me tonight awaken asleeping [Applause] giant because we the bride of Jesus Christ and we've been preached to and preached to and preached to and we now know who we are we are an invincible Army [Applause] we have rounded up the troops we've rallied the the people you're in trouble Satan you know the prophet told the story of the kids and he was a little boy in the backyard and he said they would they would tussle and fight and carry on in the backyard maybe they didn't see out to eye but don't pick on nobody in my family in the front yard devil you brought it to the front yard now we're not going to quit I'm going to bring this back to you by Rememberance I am a soldier in the army of the Lord Jesus Christ is my commanding officer the Holy Bible is my

and deliverance and peace I am a soldier in God's Army you love the Lord give him a round of applause God here to do something special [Applause] [Music] tonight brother you going have to forgive me I'm going to break order just a little bit father and sister Donna come up at this time if they would come up brother Caleb brother Micah sister Grace Alena emilin just stand right there family that prays together stays together together am sister Donna has a a little testimony she'd like to share with you I look at this smile on her face and I think glory to God okay as yall know I I'm always any some emotion in there because there's I'm alive okay and that's part of it runs in the family so if I do cry a little bit it ain't because I'm any other reason but want to say that even from the very start that the Lord has never allowed any fear um I I've never I I'm I'm a hater of Satan and when I can get him under my feet I will smash him as much as I possibly can and and was in there I felt like I kind of looked in the eyes of some devils because there was one of them come in there and I thought well they're dealing through science but I thought whoo they you say you are going to die from breast cancer and I thought boy now what kind of devil am I looking at and I just thought that's what you say not me was like I didn't say that you did but anyway I'm just saying that's what the Lord even in all of it even in them saying and showing these pictures and then these things and I thought Lord there's no fear that that fear and there's I'm like no Satan you can have that and go to hell with it that's right what I said that's right that's right and the way that I believe is that I'm already healed it's already done that's where I stand thank the Lord um [Applause] and I don't say it just out of like an emotion I stand on it I know all the cloud of witnesses that we have of the positive I also know that there are some that because of the disas have stepped over into the other dimension I'm aware of all of that stuff because you think well they probably thought that is one crazy woman she didn't even she didn't you know and I I have an on time God I have a God I have a rock and he's my shield and my protector I have him to that is with me all the time and none of this actually basically I guess you would say kind of showed it or tried to show a until it was like I began to get very sincere with the Lord and I realized you know and I prayed and I thought Lord we hear so much about you about people getting real sincere with you in the time of trouble and I a long time ago I thought Lord I don't want to wait till a time of trouble I want to be that close yeah you know so yep I just prayed that and then I was blessed to be able to help with homeschooling the girls here and we have a Bible every morning and I'm telling you what it just it's yum you know it's good and I thank for it and it's not just me trying to help them to armor up to be able to stand against the enemy and to share with them how to how he works and how to shut him down it's just I it myself and I've learned I've become closer and closer Lord and it's it's just a resounding amen the devil I he might hate me but I don't care there's no love lost there trust me and and I try to tell them all the time he comes by way of thoughts mess with the young people by attitudes and emotions and and changes go through as young people and I try to give them a head up on it you know and he didn't like it because I was squashing him really really bad and I just praise God don't keep on squashing him and I'm oh oh and another thing I'm not preparing for a funeral I'm preparing for a Rapture [Music] [Applause] amen amen praise the Lord that's how she truly has been through the whole deal mean so much when I heard the news well no none of that everything that could hit me did hit me and she was already dead in the grave and I felt the emotions I actually felt the emotions of the thoughts of not having her with me you know I was like she's gone the doctor said and and and only only if you experience can you really know what that the pain I mean you talk about pain you know I've had to pick myself up off the ground I mean knock down like you know and and begin to try to have the faith that she does right because she deserves it you know God's faith it ain't my faith there you go she's always said that she's not my faith it's you know God is praised God is lifted up because it's the god in me that's doing all that's right sister that's right anyway so uh it's been a couple days for me trying to get up and I'll be honest with you until about noon today course it still hits me probably will still hit me and I thoughts you know the thoughts of where it would go the other way and when when you be down that road while you're going to have tears coming flowing you know so you got to completely overcome you know you got to think God's thoughts the way that she think God's thoughts amen that it's already done already healed and praise God and worship him and just as if it was already done and let me tell you something no doubt a lot of us here will are fighting doubts tonight but you got to fight those doubts you've got to shun them the side otherwise we'd all be boohoo in here right the reason that we find those doubts though is because we've seen others that have passed on you have to recognize that and say Lord I understand all of that but that's not what I believe that's not what's in here and I'm okay if you feel that way but it's just like this too and like I told them I came home and I told them I said if you want to cry that's fine and I might cry with you but it ain't because I'm feeling sorry for myself I'm sorry you're unhappy I said and I'm going to cry and I'm be like Lord help him be happy you know but I told him and I said listen I said Mike and Grace the girls they're building a house I said y'all need to keep on building a house I said and they have homeschool and I'm going to keep on helping homeschool I said and I'm going to help do housework and laundry and all that other kind of stuff I said I'm going to keep on walking in the Lord every day I said this and I told him I said it's it's like it's unclean spirits brother brandom taught us about the three unclean and they always look back they always look back I said we're not looking back I said today is the first day of our life and we're going to do it with Jesus every single day I said every day is a new day and that's when we're walking in the Lord Jesus Christ in the line of D amen praise the Lord amen so we just want to say we have we love you all very much and amen one thing it did to to for me is when they me that of course I broke down and wept on her you know started to ask forgiveness for everything I had ever done every little fight I read you know and all that and I looked in her face and I seen that same young girl that I married 40 years ago and it was like a renewed love just an appreciation amen but you know a trespasser how many believe we got a trespasser here tonight this is God's church here this is God's people how many believes that amen that trespassing Devil's going to get cast out tonight amen so we're going to try to we're going to of service now and we're just going to ask brother berer and just stay

hold and he said the cancer was like a crab and it would grab a h and and and all its way down and that's what's happen happened with this with with sister Sherry this fibrosis it's fibers that begin
