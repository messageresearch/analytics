[58:56] mention anything about Giants or
[58:57] anything of that nature this morning
[58:59] we're just going to get into the word of
[59:01] God and uh I do ask one thing from you
[59:03] can you give me one thing this morning
[59:05] can you give me an amen can you pull on
[59:07] the gift of God and you know I'm kind of
[59:09] like brother brandham he say you know
[59:10] when you goes the only skunk I know is
[59:13] the devil and he says I can look at my
[59:14] dog Fritz and say sick boy and Fritz to
[59:16] run in there he didn't want to run in
[59:18] there but he ran in there anyway and he
[59:19] got after him so I need y'all to say
[59:21] sick and boy this morning cuz this ain't
[59:23] my word this is his word and if you're a
[59:25] son and daughter of God you got a right
[59:27] to this word you got a right to the
[59:29] promise you got a right to say Amen to
[59:31] it you got a right to shout a right to
[59:33] jump a right to worship a right to
[59:35] praise God look now I don't see anybody
[59:37] here with shackles on their hands this
[59:40] morning amen nobody with shackles let's
[59:43] use those hands let's use those mouths
[59:45] this
[59:46] morning let's just go to him in prayer
[59:48] before we turn to the word father what a
[59:51] great privilege we have to stand before
[59:53] the elect of God and the purchase of the
[59:55] blood and Lord we just count it an honor
[59:57] to be here Lord so appreciate brother
[1:00:00] Thomas his friendship the church Lord
[1:00:03] and just what they have meant to us
[1:00:04] these last four months just forging a
[1:00:06] relationship and a friendship and Lord
[1:00:08] our desire today is that we can get
[1:00:11] ourselves out of the way and allow the
[1:00:12] gift that you placed in our hearts and
[1:00:14] our lives to operate but we know Lord
[1:00:16] your Prophet would teach us that the
[1:00:18] gift is not ours but it's the people
[1:00:20] that operates that gift so we pray Lord
[1:00:23] that the people here of the even light
[1:00:25] Tabernacle operate the gift that you
[1:00:26] placed here for it's not for me to show
[1:00:29] who I am or what I am but it's to edify
[1:00:32] and to meet the needs of those people
[1:00:34] those hands those hearts so may you do
[1:00:36] that this morning Lord may you speak
[1:00:38] expressly to us Lord however time we
[1:00:41] have set aside this morning this entire
[1:00:43] day we just give it to you and we just
[1:00:45] want your fellowship we want your
[1:00:47] worship to be pleasing our worship to be
[1:00:49] pleasing to you and and Lord may your
[1:00:51] Holy Spirit just flood every heart every
[1:00:53] life every situation every home God may
[1:00:56] you have the preeminence in this service
[1:00:58] this morning for we ask it in Jesus name
[1:01:01] amen if you have your Bibles this
[1:01:02] morning we're going to look here in
[1:01:03] Exodus 3 going to also have you look in
[1:01:06] numbers 33 but we're going to look here
[1:01:08] in Exodus 3 and verse1 14
[1:01:13] first say Amen when you get
[1:01:16] there amen and God said unto Moses I am
[1:01:21] that I am and he said thus shalt thou
[1:01:24] say unto the children of Israel
[1:01:26] I am has sent me unto you so I want to
[1:01:30] just stop just for a minute there I know
[1:01:31] I have you standing but I want you to
[1:01:33] rec recognize who's speaking here this
[1:01:36] is not Moses speaking to himself with a
[1:01:39] you know a voice that he thinks he's
[1:01:40] hearing but no this is God the I am the
[1:01:43] self-existing one the almighty Jehovah
[1:01:46] he's come down and he said Thou shalt
[1:01:49] say unto the children of Israel I am not
[1:01:53] I was not I will be but whatever your
[1:01:56] situation is right now I am still God
[1:01:59] I'm still God of your healing I'm still
[1:02:01] God of your deliverance I'm still God of
[1:02:03] your situations I'm God of your family
[1:02:06] life I'm God of every situation I am
[1:02:09] that I am you tell them I am has sent me
[1:02:12] unto you notice Moses wasn't going just
[1:02:15] to show who Moses was Moses was going
[1:02:18] because Moses had a commission from God
[1:02:20] to go to you and I want you to see this
[1:02:24] this morning and God said moreover to
[1:02:26] Moses thou shal and thus shalt thou say
[1:02:30] unto the children of Israel the Lord God
[1:02:32] of your fathers the god of Abraham and
[1:02:35] of the god of Isaac the god of Jacob has
[1:02:38] sent me unto you this is the name
[1:02:40] Forever This is my Memorial Toto all
[1:02:43] generations now notice what he tells
[1:02:46] Moses go and gather all the Elders of
[1:02:48] Israel together and say unto them the
[1:02:51] Lord God of your fathers the god of
[1:02:52] Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob appear
[1:02:56] unto me saying I have surely visited you
[1:02:58] and seen that which is done to you in
[1:03:01] Egypt so God recognizes the oppression
[1:03:04] that they were under and God recognizes
[1:03:07] the oppression in which some of you are
[1:03:08] under this morning he understands where
[1:03:10] You' been he understands the trials the
[1:03:12] situations he understands those dark
[1:03:15] nights he understands those valleys that
[1:03:17] you've been in and notice and he says in
[1:03:19] verse 17 and I have said I will bring
[1:03:22] you up out of the Affliction of Egypt
[1:03:25] unto the land of the canites and the
[1:03:27] Hittites and the amorites and the
[1:03:29] perizzites and the hivites and the
[1:03:31] jebusites unto a land flowing with milk
[1:03:35] and with honey oh my that's a good land
[1:03:39] let's look here in numbers 33 and verse
[1:03:42] 51 speak unto the children of Israel and
[1:03:45] say unto them when not if but when you
[1:03:49] are passed over Jordan into the land of
[1:03:51] Canaan then ye shall drive out the
[1:03:54] inhabitants of the land from before you
[1:03:57] so God is expecting for each of us this
[1:03:59] morning to play a part in this going out
[1:04:02] of Egypt and into a new land you shall
[1:04:05] drive out the inhabitants of the land
[1:04:07] from before you and destroy all their
[1:04:09] pictures and destroy all their molten
[1:04:11] images and quite pluck down their high
[1:04:12] places and ye shall dispossess the
[1:04:16] inhabitants of the land and dwell
[1:04:18] therein for I have given you the land to
[1:04:21] possess it and you shall divide the land
[1:04:24] by lot for an inheritance among your
[1:04:26] families and to the more you shall give
[1:04:28] the more inheritance and to the fewer
[1:04:30] you shall give the less inheritance
[1:04:32] Every Man's inheritance shall be in the
[1:04:35] place where his lot falleth according to
[1:04:38] the tribes of your fathers shall you
[1:04:40] inherit God bless you you can have your
[1:04:41] seats this
[1:04:45] morning where's brother Tommy at this
[1:04:49] morning this is a beautiful
[1:04:51] Pulpit this is nice my my my this is
[1:04:56] wonderful are you glad to be a Christian
[1:04:57] this morning so I want to speak to you
[1:05:00] just for a little bit this morning
[1:05:01] footprints in the land of
[1:05:04] inheritance so Footprints we know that a
[1:05:07] prophet would teach us Footprints means
[1:05:10] possession Footprints is also an an an
[1:05:13] impression that is made in the ground
[1:05:15] how many Hunters we have here this
[1:05:16] morning how many people do we have here
[1:05:19] this morning you ever seen a footprint
[1:05:21] you say well somebody's been here before
[1:05:23] so that's what a a footprint is that
[1:05:25] shows that somebody has been here
[1:05:27] somebody has walked in this exact spot
[1:05:31] and somebody has made their impression
[1:05:33] right here see a footprint shows today
[1:05:36] that that uh that a that that somewhere
[1:05:40] that somebody has been that others can
[1:05:42] follow that they can follow those same
[1:05:45] Footprints and reach the same goal the
[1:05:47] same end product and I believe today
[1:05:50] that God is calling us to make
[1:05:52] footprints in the land of our
[1:05:54] inheritance many times we seen our
[1:05:57] forefathers our grandparents those that
[1:05:59] had the outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:01] back in' 64 and 65 but many times we put
[1:06:05] those miracles on the shelf and ask what
[1:06:07] is God doing today I'm telling you they
[1:06:09] made their footprint but what about a
[1:06:12] Believer today God has sent you a
[1:06:14] message and it's high time that we start
[1:06:16] making footprints in the land of our
[1:06:19] inheritance to show the devil that I've
[1:06:21] been here some of you need healing this
[1:06:24] morning you need to step out on it and
[1:06:27] place your foot on it and say that's
[1:06:29] belongs to me this morning healing is
[1:06:31] mine Deliverance is mine salvation is
[1:06:34] mine the Holy Ghost is mine this
[1:06:37] morning make a footprint on what belongs
[1:06:40] to you and to your
[1:06:43] family thank you notice he says in
[1:06:45] numbers 33 and 53 and you shall
[1:06:49] dispossess the inhabitants of the
[1:06:53] land that word dispossess means you have
[1:06:55] to
[1:06:57] destroy means you can't play games with
[1:06:59] the
[1:07:00] devil trying to keep your Xbox and
[1:07:03] playing Call of Duty and stuff like that
[1:07:04] ain't going to get you to heaven I ain't
[1:07:07] going to say it's not going to get you
[1:07:08] there but it sure ain't going to help
[1:07:10] matters but we find here it means to
[1:07:13] destroy to bring to ruin to disinherit
[1:07:17] to take possession of so God is saying
[1:07:21] I'm taking you out of bondage I'm taking
[1:07:23] you out of Egypt but I'm taking taking
[1:07:25] you into a land a land that I promised
[1:07:28] to give to Abraham a land that I
[1:07:30] promised to give to Isaac a land that I
[1:07:33] promised to give to Jacob notice God
[1:07:35] never changed the land he gave it to
[1:07:38] Abraham it was the same promise he gave
[1:07:40] to Isaac the same promise he gave to
[1:07:42] Jacob and it's the same promise that
[1:07:44] he's given to the believer this morning
[1:07:46] he never backed up off the promise that
[1:07:49] he gave to William brandom it's the same
[1:07:51] promise today it's from to you to your
[1:07:53] children to them that are far off even
[1:07:56] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:07:58] he's still given the same promise but
[1:08:02] somebody's got to make a footprint
[1:08:04] somebody's got to step out and say this
[1:08:06] is mine I'm tired of struggling I'm
[1:08:09] tired of fighting I'm going to take
[1:08:10] possession of it this morning it belongs
[1:08:13] to me it belongs to my
[1:08:17] family can I get a little bit more
[1:08:19] volume up here if that's okay but notice
[1:08:21] it means to
[1:08:23] destroy I know sometimes we want to be
[1:08:26] polite we're Christians
[1:08:28] right and as Christians sometimes we
[1:08:31] don't want to get our hands dirty we
[1:08:33] don't want to fight you know that's for
[1:08:34] rough people the Bible says the
[1:08:38] violent the violent taketh by
[1:08:41] force not the coward the violent that
[1:08:45] means those that are strong those that
[1:08:47] see that that belongs to me and I refuse
[1:08:50] to let the devil keep me from it that's
[1:08:53] right notice that this
[1:08:56] time God sent Moses and I'm just going
[1:08:58] to some of this is going to be
[1:09:00] Elementary for us cuz we're Believers
[1:09:02] but I'm going somewhere this morning
[1:09:04] that's right so God sent Moses with the
[1:09:06] greatest message brother Tommy of their
[1:09:09] day notice you're leaving a land of
[1:09:13] bondage I'm taking you out of Egypt what
[1:09:16] a
[1:09:17] message what if some of you've been
[1:09:19] struggling 5 years with a situation
[1:09:21] they've been 400
[1:09:23] years 400 years of cruel oppression 400
[1:09:28] years of seeing the young girls raped
[1:09:30] 400 young 400 years of seeing the young
[1:09:33] men not rising to much only to become a
[1:09:36] slave 400 years they were ready they
[1:09:39] knew they had a word that God was going
[1:09:42] to deliver them they were under an
[1:09:44] expectation that someday someday we're
[1:09:47] going to get out of here and we're going
[1:09:49] to go to another land we're going to
[1:09:51] have our own land we're going to have
[1:09:53] our own place we're going to have our
[1:09:54] own
[1:09:56] promises and they were looking forward
[1:09:58] to
[1:09:59] that and Moses God sent Moses with the
[1:10:03] greatest message it was not only a
[1:10:05] message of coming out of Egypt and
[1:10:07] leaving their bondage behind and leaving
[1:10:10] the the the the rulership of their
[1:10:12] taskmasters but it was a message where
[1:10:14] they had to apply the blood they had to
[1:10:17] apply the token cu the death angel
[1:10:18] sweeping through the land that's right
[1:10:22] but it was also a message that I'm not
[1:10:24] only going to take you out but I'm going
[1:10:26] to take you in see it's one thing to
[1:10:29] come out and have nowhere to
[1:10:31] go so a prophet of God came in the in
[1:10:34] the early 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s he
[1:10:37] called us out of a land of
[1:10:39] denominationalism but what if it was we
[1:10:41] didn't have anywhere to go but no we
[1:10:43] have a place to go God has taking us
[1:10:46] into the opening of the word God has
[1:10:48] taking us into the realities that he's
[1:10:51] still God he's still the god of Abraham
[1:10:54] Isaac and Jacob
[1:10:57] and notice this land had been designated
[1:11:00] by
[1:11:01] God when God said let us make man in our
[1:11:04] image he already knew where he was
[1:11:05] taking
[1:11:06] them come on somebody work with me this
[1:11:09] morning God already knew when God called
[1:11:12] you God already knew where he was taking
[1:11:14] you brother Tommy he knew exactly where
[1:11:17] you would be the road you would go down
[1:11:19] but he knew it right at that
[1:11:20] intersection one day you were going to
[1:11:22] meet God you were going to come in
[1:11:24] contact with this message and your life
[1:11:27] would be forever be changed why because
[1:11:29] God's got a promise and God's got a
[1:11:32] purpose and God's got a plan for each of
[1:11:34] us here this
[1:11:36] morning it's a land that's been
[1:11:38] designated for ordained by God for his
[1:11:41] chosen people there wasn't a greater
[1:11:44] Message In the
[1:11:46] Land There wasn't a greater message in
[1:11:50] the
[1:11:51] land then I'm taking you out of
[1:11:53] Egypt woo
[1:11:55] Jes come on Amen there wasn't a greater
[1:11:59] message that I'm taking you from your
[1:12:01] bondage and I'm bringing you into a land
[1:12:04] of promise I'm going to bring you into a
[1:12:07] land of liberty I'm going to bring you
[1:12:09] into a land of Freedom I'm going to
[1:12:11] bring you into a land of Victory come on
[1:12:14] all eyes on
[1:12:15] me all eyes up here I'm the preacher
[1:12:18] this
[1:12:19] morning I'm taking you to a land of
[1:12:22] promise a land of Victory a land that a
[1:12:25] Pentecostal experience whether we don't
[1:12:27] put these things on the back shelf and
[1:12:29] say God used to be he's still the I am
[1:12:32] God he's still the one that pours out
[1:12:35] his holy ghost he can still come even
[1:12:37] here this morning in our church in our
[1:12:40] service and give you a revelation that
[1:12:42] I'm calling you out of Egypt I'm calling
[1:12:44] you from that land of bondage I'm
[1:12:46] calling you from that Taskmaster and I'm
[1:12:48] taking you into a land of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:51] of a land of Victory a land of promise a
[1:12:53] land of total defeat over the enemy this
[1:12:56] morning he's calling us to
[1:12:59] that notice he's taking us to a land
[1:13:01] where we could
[1:13:04] worship oh this ain't some Baptist idea
[1:13:06] where we come to the house of God and we
[1:13:08] become a bunch of head noters no we got
[1:13:11] a right to worship
[1:13:13] God we got a right to praise God we got
[1:13:17] a right to dance in the spirit if we
[1:13:19] want to dance in the spirit we have that
[1:13:22] right because it's part of the land
[1:13:27] Noti it's a land you don't have to be
[1:13:28] afraid anymore of the
[1:13:30] Taskmaster you don't have to live in
[1:13:32] fear what they might do to you but it's
[1:13:35] a land where Sons and Daughters of God
[1:13:37] can live as Sons and Daughters of
[1:13:40] God you know but notice what they had to
[1:13:43] do they had to trust the
[1:13:47] message and they had to trust the
[1:13:51] messenger see they had to trust that the
[1:13:53] messenger heard from God come on hope
[1:13:57] you're seeing they had to trust that the
[1:14:00] messenger heard from God and they had to
[1:14:03] trust that the message was God's
[1:14:06] message not The
[1:14:11] Messengers so we find here in Exodus 3
[1:14:14] and verse 7 I'm going to take my time
[1:14:15] this morning we're here all day
[1:14:18] right all right praise
[1:14:22] God and he said and the Lord said I have
[1:14:26] surely seen the Affliction of my
[1:14:29] people come on somebody God seen your
[1:14:33] Affliction oh which are in Egypt and I
[1:14:36] have heard their Cry by the reasoning of
[1:14:38] their task Masters for I know their
[1:14:41] sorrows many times we think we're in
[1:14:43] that Valley we're in that deep pit of
[1:14:46] despair that nobody knows God doesn't
[1:14:48] even know where I met I'm all by myself
[1:14:50] am I talking to myself this morning some
[1:14:52] of you been there we feel like if we're
[1:14:55] we're all alone this is us I'm having to
[1:14:56] fight through this by myself but he says
[1:14:59] I am and I have come down to deliver
[1:15:02] them out of the hand of the Egyptians
[1:15:04] and to bring them up out of the land
[1:15:07] unto a good land and a large land unto a
[1:15:11] land that's flowing with milk and honey
[1:15:13] unto the place of the canites and
[1:15:15] hivites and amorites and perizzites and
[1:15:17] hivites and jebusites notice there's
[1:15:19] people already occupying the
[1:15:21] land but it didn't belong to those
[1:15:24] people it belong to you as a son and
[1:15:26] daughter of God what am I telling you
[1:15:29] this morning there's there's there's
[1:15:31] demons right now in the land of your
[1:15:33] physical body it may be cancer it may be
[1:15:35] lung trouble it may be sugar diabetes it
[1:15:38] may be lust it may be something else but
[1:15:40] that land don't belong to them it
[1:15:43] belongs to you this morning and you got
[1:15:45] a right to that land you got a right to
[1:15:47] that promise this morning and though
[1:15:49] it's already been occupied you got to
[1:15:52] dispossess the inhabitants of the land
[1:15:58] so notice he says I this is Jehovah
[1:16:01] speaking I am come down to deliver them
[1:16:05] out of the hand of the Egyptians then we
[1:16:08] drop down in verse 10 come now therefore
[1:16:11] and I'm going to send you
[1:16:13] Moses yeah well I thought this was God
[1:16:16] but all I see is Moses Moses was the
[1:16:19] mouthpiece of
[1:16:23] God and I'm I'm looking at two
[1:16:25] mouthpieces right here for you for the
[1:16:28] Believers here in Elton they're the
[1:16:30] mouthpiece of God for you look beyond
[1:16:33] their stature look beyond their frame
[1:16:36] look beyond their mistakes look beyond
[1:16:38] their failures and listen for the voice
[1:16:41] of them speak of God coming down and
[1:16:43] speaking to you to give you exactly what
[1:16:46] you have need of cuz he
[1:16:51] knows he says now therefore I will send
[1:16:54] thee unto pharaoh and thou mayest bring
[1:16:57] forth my children of Israel out of Egypt
[1:17:01] so we find here it wasn't Moses's
[1:17:03] message it wasn't Moses's thoughts it
[1:17:07] never was Moses's intellectual property
[1:17:10] that's see it was the message that God
[1:17:14] gave to Moses for one
[1:17:18] purpose to deliver the
[1:17:21] people did you hear me one purpose to
[1:17:25] deliver the people and our message ain't
[1:17:28] about William
[1:17:29] brandom one purpose deliver the people
[1:17:34] we're going to show that here with
[1:17:35] quotes and we're going to show it with
[1:17:36] scripture so don't freak out oh he said
[1:17:40] brother brand no no I'm saying this
[1:17:42] message was never about William
[1:17:46] brandham it was about God seeing a
[1:17:49] people that was under the cruel hand of
[1:17:51] denominationalism and God said I have
[1:17:53] come down in 1947 1948
[1:17:58] 19565 I have come down for one purpose
[1:18:01] William brandham and that's to break the
[1:18:03] Revelation that these people can be free
[1:18:06] and I'm going to take a Rapture and I'm
[1:18:08] going to Rapture people out and they're
[1:18:10] no longer going to be held by
[1:18:11] denominational bondage they're no longer
[1:18:13] going to be held by sin they're no
[1:18:15] longer be held by unbelief but I have
[1:18:17] come down in this hour in this day the
[1:18:21] same Pillar of Fire that will leading
[1:18:23] the children of Israel out of the Egypt
[1:18:25] it's the same Pillar of Fire that we see
[1:18:27] right back here and he's leading us on
[1:18:30] to the promised land into the land of
[1:18:32] our
[1:18:33] inheritance he's still God he never
[1:18:37] changes if he led them out by a pillar
[1:18:40] of fire and he was taking them to a land
[1:18:42] flowing with milk and honey you can buy
[1:18:44] God bet today that he's still doing the
[1:18:47] same thing we're not going to some
[1:18:49] oppressed land we're not going out to
[1:18:51] where he's going to leave us high and
[1:18:52] dry we're going to a good land we're
[1:18:55] going to a large land it's a land
[1:18:57] flowing with milk and
[1:18:59] honey somebody need to get their
[1:19:01] appetite L wet this morning it's a good
[1:19:07] land they say
[1:19:10] that we find milk and honey in this land
[1:19:13] and they said that was the diet of
[1:19:18] Kings not everybody can Feast on milk
[1:19:21] and honey but Kings could
[1:19:26] there subjects could in Revelations we
[1:19:28] find that he has made us both Kings and
[1:19:32] priest come on you got a right to the
[1:19:35] Honey Jar this morning stick your hand
[1:19:37] in start licking you got a right to the
[1:19:40] milk not just not just some little bit
[1:19:42] of nothing but you got a right you can
[1:19:44] drink on the word of God Feast on the
[1:19:46] word of God partake of whatever you have
[1:19:48] need of this morning for it's unto you
[1:19:51] and your children
[1:19:55] notice now the message was a message
[1:19:59] that God gave to Moses for one purpose
[1:20:02] that's to deliver the people and we find
[1:20:05] that this same Pillar of Fire brother B
[1:20:08] will tell us Moses met the angel of the
[1:20:12] Lord the angel of the Covenant otherwise
[1:20:16] he met he would tell us here and does
[1:20:18] God Chang his mind Moses was leading the
[1:20:21] children of Israel just as God would
[1:20:23] tell them where to go led by the pillar
[1:20:25] of fire you see that picture right there
[1:20:29] that ain't about a man you got to look
[1:20:32] above his head and see who that is
[1:20:34] that's taking his picture with him that
[1:20:36] wasn't to Iden yeah it was one and in
[1:20:39] one aspect to vindicate brother Bon but
[1:20:41] another way to to vindicate that he's
[1:20:43] here for us in this hour and what he did
[1:20:46] for them then he's doing for us today
[1:20:48] he's the same and he changes not he led
[1:20:51] them out of their land of and he's here
[1:20:53] to lead you out of your land
[1:20:55] bondage but notice what he says now he
[1:20:58] said led by the pillar of fire the
[1:21:01] supernatural being that was leading the
[1:21:03] way and Moses was getting his
[1:21:05] information through the
[1:21:08] logos Moses was getting his information
[1:21:11] through the logos of course that went
[1:21:13] out of God the pillar of fire which was
[1:21:15] the angel of the Covenant which was
[1:21:17] Christ the anointed one he was getting
[1:21:20] his message through there and giving it
[1:21:22] to the children of Israel on the road to
[1:21:25] the promised
[1:21:26] land so Moses never put his own
[1:21:29] interpretation to the
[1:21:31] message he stayed with what the pillar
[1:21:34] of fire
[1:21:35] said come on
[1:21:37] somebody so
[1:21:39] Moses received his message from the same
[1:21:43] angel that brother brandham received his
[1:21:46] from because there's only one Angel of
[1:21:48] the
[1:21:49] Covenant okay so notice and when he he
[1:21:52] gave the message to the to the children
[1:21:55] of Israel no longer was it Moses's
[1:21:58] message now it became their
[1:22:01] message now they had to trust the
[1:22:04] messenger they had to trust the message
[1:22:06] and when they became one with the
[1:22:08] message no longer was it just Moses now
[1:22:11] it's my message now I'm the one that's
[1:22:13] believing I believe that Moses heard
[1:22:16] from God I believe that Moses met a
[1:22:18] pillar of fire I believe that Moses met
[1:22:20] the angel of the Covenant I believe and
[1:22:22] therefore I'm going to go out on what
[1:22:24] Moses said and therefore the message is
[1:22:26] no longer in the mouth of Moses now the
[1:22:29] message is in my heart and I'm going to
[1:22:31] follow the message I'm not following the
[1:22:34] messenger per se but I'm following the
[1:22:36] message which the messenger is speaking
[1:22:38] because I know he's following the pillar
[1:22:40] of
[1:22:43] fire I hope you see the parallel between
[1:22:46] their day and our day their message and
[1:22:48] our message God never
[1:22:51] changes and notice we have been given
[1:22:55] we as a people have been given the
[1:22:56] greatest message in all the
[1:23:00] world see and the message was never
[1:23:02] about Moses what kind of leader could he
[1:23:05] be it never was about how great he was
[1:23:08] or how great he esteemed to be the
[1:23:11] message was for Moses to go and call out
[1:23:14] a people always go and deliver my people
[1:23:20] you believe that this morning see the
[1:23:22] message was God was going to take a
[1:23:24] people out out of Egypt but he was going
[1:23:25] to take him into a land flowing with
[1:23:26] milk and honey he was going to take him
[1:23:28] from bondage of sin the bondage of
[1:23:30] man-made Creeds and ideas and dogmas and
[1:23:33] he was going to take them into the land
[1:23:34] of the opening of the
[1:23:36] word where the same signs that followed
[1:23:39] on the day of Pentecost that came down
[1:23:40] is the same God the same signs the same
[1:23:42] wonders the same Supernatural That's
[1:23:44] fallen in our day just because a prophet
[1:23:48] is gone doesn't mean that the angel of
[1:23:49] the Covenant is gone he's still here the
[1:23:52] Holy Ghost is still here how many how
[1:23:54] many of you got the Holy Ghost today how
[1:23:56] many of you are under the age of 50
[1:23:58] years old today that means that the Holy
[1:24:01] Ghost the same one that was with brother
[1:24:02] brandom the same one that had his
[1:24:04] picture taken was with you when you
[1:24:06] received the Holy Ghost if he would have
[1:24:08] left you would have never received it
[1:24:10] but he goes to show that he's still here
[1:24:12] he's still calling he's still moving
[1:24:15] he's still filling with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:17] he is still God and he's leading a
[1:24:19] people to a land
[1:24:25] notice he's taken them to a land where
[1:24:28] all the loose sins of the previous ages
[1:24:30] has all been tied
[1:24:31] together for all the mysteries of God
[1:24:35] had now been revealed so we're not
[1:24:38] looking for Moses to come back when
[1:24:41] Moses went beyond the curtain of time
[1:24:43] when it was time for him to go God
[1:24:45] anointed another
[1:24:46] servant a
[1:24:48] Joshua and the same
[1:24:50] commission that Moses had Joshua had
[1:24:54] yeah now take them Joshua you're going
[1:24:57] to divide the land for him and hold
[1:25:00] brother B taught us that our Joshua is
[1:25:02] the Holy
[1:25:04] Ghost he had to leave so the Holy Ghost
[1:25:06] could be poured out upon us and notice
[1:25:08] we can only receive the Holy Ghost in
[1:25:10] our day through the ministry of Malachi
[1:25:14] 4 through an end time message cuz when
[1:25:17] is it applied when do you apply the
[1:25:19] token in the evening time not in the
[1:25:22] morning time not in the midday day time
[1:25:24] of the message but in the evening time
[1:25:27] all the loose sins now been finalized
[1:25:29] all the mysteries of God had been
[1:25:31] revealed and notice we're going to a
[1:25:33] land of Supernatural freedom and liberty
[1:25:35] a land where all things are possible for
[1:25:37] the believer oh come on believer but we
[1:25:40] must trust the message and we must trust
[1:25:43] the
[1:25:44] messenger see we don't have to try to
[1:25:46] figure it all out you can find Brothers
[1:25:48] today men today that preach this message
[1:25:50] and they try to make I mean my goodness
[1:25:53] they got the cow eating GRE grass up in
[1:25:54] the top of a tree and we mean we got
[1:25:57] them all mixed up they got their types

[1:26:04] top of the tree but just called at least
[1:26:06] put the cow in the grass and let them
[1:26:08] Forge around a little bit and eat what
[1:26:10] he can eat stay with the word stay with
[1:26:13] what you know don't try to be some great
[1:26:15] teacher when you're not a teacher I
[1:26:17] learned that lesson I tried to teach the
[1:26:19] Holy Ghost series to our young people
[1:26:20] years ago brother Thomas man I sat down
[1:26:22] I was like I better sit down because I
[1:26:24] know what kind of preacher I am I'm
[1:26:26] about halfway through it I'm like I
[1:26:27] can't do this guys I jumped up and I
[1:26:30] mean I preached the Holy Ghost them we
[1:26:32] did like several months of the Holy
[1:26:34] Ghost and man we had just an outpouring
[1:26:36] of the spirit of God on our young people
[1:26:39] you know and you just got to know what
[1:26:40] God's called you for so just stay in it
[1:26:43] but notice brother Brandon would tell us
[1:26:44] in the message of Shame he goes I close
[1:26:46] my eyes I just let the Bible fall open I
[1:26:49] put my finger on the scripture Genesis
[1:26:52] 24:7 elas or Abra Abraham's faithful
[1:26:55] servant the model servant of the Bible
[1:26:57] being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac
[1:27:01] and he said that's right with the rest
[1:27:03] of my message pulling out the
[1:27:06] bride so he had a message of Divine
[1:27:08] Healing but this part of it stayed right
[1:27:11] with his message he knew what he was
[1:27:14] sent for and that was to call out a
[1:27:16] bride for our
[1:27:19] Lord and he would talk about elizar he
[1:27:22] said he he went straight right out and
[1:27:23] began praying and he met the beautiful
[1:27:25] Rebecca that became the Bride of Isaac
[1:27:27] just a perfect message back to the word
[1:27:30] go get that bride he says that's a duty
[1:27:34] that's what I'm here for that's what I'm
[1:27:36] trying to do is call out AB bride he
[1:27:39] never was about building a kingdom to
[1:27:42] himself he never was about people
[1:27:45] baptizing in his name he never was about
[1:27:48] people falling down and worshiping him
[1:27:50] he was about finding that elect for
[1:27:53] almighty God call falling out the and
[1:27:55] that's why you're here this morning is
[1:27:58] because you didn't hear just the voice
[1:28:00] of William bradam you heard the voice
[1:28:02] behind the voice that one that spoke to
[1:28:05] him you heard that same Pillar of Fire
[1:28:07] say come out of her my people and be not
[1:28:10] be not yoked up in her
[1:28:14] bondage notice he didn't come to build
[1:28:17] his own kingdom draw man to himself but
[1:28:19] he come to get a bride and that's what
[1:28:21] every God call man's purpose is or
[1:28:24] should be so when you find men building
[1:28:26] kingdoms you know they ain't of God oh
[1:28:29] they can be under the umbrella of the
[1:28:30] message they can be they can have signs
[1:28:32] and wonders and Supernatural this that
[1:28:34] and the other but if they're drawing men
[1:28:35] to themselves that's a seed of
[1:28:39] discrepancy because we got one purpose
[1:28:41] one plan and that's to fill the Great
[1:28:44] Commission and call out an elect call
[1:28:47] out a bride for Jesus
[1:28:50] Christ brother Thomas how long you been
[1:28:52] here 30 years
[1:28:55] 32 years I don't see no Kingdom yet
[1:28:58] that's right because it ain't about
[1:28:59] Thomas Bor it's not about Brad pow it's
[1:29:02] not about Joe Adams Tim pu Donnie Reagan
[1:29:05] Ed Bisal put whoever you want there it
[1:29:07] ain't about
[1:29:08] us it's about you this
[1:29:11] morning oh come on I don't think that
[1:29:13] fell flat it's about you this morning
[1:29:16] the message has always been about you
[1:29:19] it's been about a pride it's been about
[1:29:21] an elect God his own Focus it's always
[1:29:24] been about I want a wife I want
[1:29:27] Fellowship I want someone that can
[1:29:29] reciprocate my love so God sent a
[1:29:33] messenger in it's end time for
[1:29:37] you notice what he says in the breach he
[1:29:41] goes we know that this book of
[1:29:42] redemption will not be thoroughly
[1:29:44] understood it's been probed at through
[1:29:46] six Church ages but at the end when the
[1:29:48] seventh angel begins to sound his
[1:29:51] mystery he winds up all the loose sins
[1:29:53] that these Fells probed it and the
[1:29:55] Mysteries come down from God as the word
[1:29:57] of God reveals the entire revelation of
[1:30:00] God so God sent a messenger to reveal
[1:30:03] the entire
[1:30:06] Revelation but you know what we try to
[1:30:08] complicate the Revelation the Revelation
[1:30:11] the entire Revelation is about you go
[1:30:14] listen to Christ the mystery of God
[1:30:16] revealed right after he opened the Seven
[1:30:18] Seals after he preached it was all about
[1:30:21] you all that God was he poured it in the
[1:30:24] Christ and all that Christ was he pours
[1:30:27] it into a bride or poured it into a
[1:30:29] people so that you and him can be the
[1:30:31] same so that he could come back in one
[1:30:33] day he's going to Rapture of people
[1:30:35] that's going to be bone of his bone
[1:30:37] flesh of his flesh life of his life she
[1:30:40] is
[1:30:42] him this ain't stuff we just teach this
[1:30:45] ain't stuff that we just fill your head
[1:30:46] with a bunch of head knowledge this is
[1:30:48] the reality that God is still here God
[1:30:51] is still moving God is still filling
[1:30:53] heart God is changing the
[1:30:57] people God changes drug drug addicts
[1:31:00] alcoholics and make some Sons and
[1:31:02] Daughters of God cuz before the
[1:31:05] foundation God deposited something
[1:31:10] there notice let me keep going here he
[1:31:12] says at the sounding of the seventh
[1:31:14] Church age how many believe we're in the
[1:31:17] seventh Church age at the seventh Church
[1:31:20] age all the loose sins that through
[1:31:22] these AE Church ages have been probed it
[1:31:25] will be wound up together and I'm going
[1:31:28] to put this out there if there is still
[1:31:30] a loose in we have an imperfect
[1:31:34] message if there is still a mystery that
[1:31:37] has not been revealed we have an
[1:31:39] imperfect
[1:31:42] message because he was sent to reveal
[1:31:45] the entire revelation of God to a people
[1:31:48] so you got to look at the word you got
[1:31:50] to look at the message that were
[1:31:51] preached and you got to find yourself
[1:31:54] in The Invisible Union got to find
[1:31:58] yourself in modern events made clear
[1:32:00] through prophecy you got to find
[1:32:02] yourself in leadership cuz only the
[1:32:05] bride's going to follow the pillar of
[1:32:06] fire cuz the others can't follow that
[1:32:09] it's too hard so notice what he says now
[1:32:12] and when the seals are broke and the
[1:32:14] Mystery is revealed down comes the angel
[1:32:17] the messenger Christ setting one foot on
[1:32:19] the land and one on the sea with a
[1:32:21] rainbow over his head now remember this
[1:32:23] seventh angel is on the earth at the
[1:32:25] time of his coming so we know who the
[1:32:27] seventh angel is the seventh messenger
[1:32:29] that obviously is brother brandom but we
[1:32:31] find it wasn't brother br's message
[1:32:33] Christ came down and Christ put his foot
[1:32:36] on the land and put his foot on the sea
[1:32:38] he was declaring di minion over the
[1:32:40] Earth at that time saying that he was
[1:32:42] coming back and we were going to occupy
[1:32:45] this Earth there's going to be a people
[1:32:47] that's going to take possession of
[1:32:49] it come on
[1:32:51] Church excuse me now he said talk about
[1:32:54] a jubilee talk about a time when the
[1:32:57] lamb walked forth the book even sealed
[1:33:00] in heaven the Mysteries are and you say
[1:33:02] is my name there he goes I don't know I
[1:33:04] hope it is but if it is it was put there
[1:33:06] before the foundation of the world but
[1:33:09] the first thing that represented that
[1:33:11] Redemption came a lamb and he had T been
[1:33:13] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:33:15] and he took the book Glory he opened the
[1:33:18] book he tore the seals off and sent it
[1:33:21] down to earth to his seventh angel to
[1:33:23] reveal it to the
[1:33:26] people This Book used to be
[1:33:30] closed come on
[1:33:32] somebody this book used to be closed but
[1:33:35] Christ came down and he what did he do
[1:33:38] he took the book when John looked and
[1:33:40] said no man was found worthy to take the
[1:33:43] book or even look at the book oh the
[1:33:45] elders said weep not John the lion of
[1:33:48] the tribe of Judah he had prevailed and
[1:33:51] John turned to find a lion and he saw a
[1:33:54] lamb a lamb that have been slain he was
[1:33:56] slain on your behalf he was slain on
[1:33:59] your benefit he was slain so you
[1:34:00] wouldn't have to be SL and he prevailed
[1:34:03] and he took the book oh Hallelujah he
[1:34:06] didn't just take it to leave it in his
[1:34:08] possession but he ripped the seals off
[1:34:10] of it and he handed it down to the
[1:34:12] messenger and he said reveal it to the
[1:34:14] people reveal this mystery to the people
[1:34:17] so they will know that they are the
[1:34:20] elect of
[1:34:22] God thank
[1:34:24] so God revealed the entire mysteries of
[1:34:27] God but he gave it to a messenger
[1:34:30] remember when brother BR was about to
[1:34:31] preach the first
[1:34:34] seal I would have made a horrible
[1:34:38] mistake I would have made I would have
[1:34:40] made a horrible mistake but he came in
[1:34:43] the room
[1:34:45] woo that's what we want this morning we
[1:34:48] don't want to hear from a man we don't
[1:34:50] want to hear from a man we wanted him to
[1:34:51] come in the room we want him to come to
[1:34:54] the house of God we want him to come and
[1:34:56] break the bread of
[1:34:57] life notice he opened the book and tore
[1:35:00] the seals off and sent it down to earth
[1:35:02] to his seventh angel to reveal it to his
[1:35:05] people it's always been about the
[1:35:08] people the mystery the purpose the plan
[1:35:11] was to bring the people out of
[1:35:14] bondage go see that's that that's the
[1:35:17] message of the seventh angel never was
[1:35:21] about him well you can go play and it's
[1:35:24] all about him cuz all they hear is the
[1:35:27] voice of William brandom they don't hear
[1:35:29] the voice behind that they don't see the
[1:35:32] one that met him in the cave they don't
[1:35:35] hear the one that spoke to him and tore
[1:35:37] the seals off and met him in the closet
[1:35:39] met him in the room when he brought
[1:35:41] those Revelations of those Seven Seals
[1:35:43] he met the angel of the Covenant cuz it
[1:35:46] was to wind up all the loose sins so
[1:35:49] that you could have confidence in the
[1:35:52] message yeah come on somebody so that
[1:35:56] you you young people so that you young
[1:35:58] people could have confidence in the
[1:36:00] message and it no longer be just Mom and
[1:36:02] Dad's message or Mom and Dad's belief or
[1:36:06] just the preachers belief or just the
[1:36:08] deacons and trustees and whoever else
[1:36:10] the officials in the church are these
[1:36:11] Great Men no look you can go to a youth
[1:36:14] camp and you can meet the same Pillar of
[1:36:17] Fire that your mom and dad had met years
[1:36:19] ago why because it ain't about the man
[1:36:22] it ain't about the messenger it's always
[1:36:24] about the message to the people and if
[1:36:26] you can believe that God sent you a
[1:36:28] message you can walk out this morning
[1:36:30] you can walk out different then you
[1:36:31] walked in you can walk out free you can
[1:36:34] walk out healed you can walk out filled
[1:36:36] with the Holy Ghost you can walk out
[1:36:38] this morning a change Man by putting a
[1:36:41] footprint into your
[1:36:43] inheritance and that's what God is
[1:36:45] expecting us to he's want to see young
[1:36:47] men have a real experience of the Holy
[1:36:50] Ghost don't just go through the motions
[1:36:52] I believe God sent Prophet well big deal
[1:36:54] the devil does too so you equal with the
[1:36:58] devil no he wants you to have an
[1:37:00] experience so when those Dark Hours come
[1:37:03] so when those lonely days come so when
[1:37:06] you're being pushed and tried by the
[1:37:07] enemy you can make a footprint that this
[1:37:10] is mine Satan this don't belong to you
[1:37:12] Satan this is my promise this is my
[1:37:15] inheritance it belongs to me this
[1:37:17] morning somebody make a
[1:37:20] footprint make an impression on the word
[1:37:22] of God that somebody else can watch
[1:37:26] you somebody else can watch your life
[1:37:30] say I want to follow those steps I know
[1:37:33] where they're leading I know where he
[1:37:35] came from I seen him in the bar I seen
[1:37:38] him in that life I seen what he used to
[1:37:40] be but I'm watching his Footprints I see
[1:37:43] where they're leading
[1:37:44] him come on
[1:37:48] somebody
[1:37:50] notice the seventh angel was making
[1:37:53] known the promise to the
[1:37:56] Overcomer he was leading
[1:37:59] them he's leading us into our
[1:38:03] inheritance okay it's more than just
[1:38:06] going to church like I said or believing
[1:38:08] God sent a prophet but it's believing
[1:38:10] that the message and the messenger you
[1:38:13] know there there's people that take that
[1:38:14] quote that the messenger and the message
[1:38:16] are one and they claim that the message
[1:38:18] brother Brams but he clearly states over
[1:38:21] and over and over and over and over that
[1:38:23] it never was his message he was
[1:38:26] receiving it from the angel of the
[1:38:29] Lord and one purpose to call out a bride
[1:38:33] we find here in Exodus 3 and verse 17
[1:38:35] notice now he says I have said this is
[1:38:38] God speaking not Moses I will bring you
[1:38:41] up out of the Affliction of Egypt unto a
[1:38:44] land of the canites Hittites amorites
[1:38:46] perizzites hivites jebusites unto a land
[1:38:49] flowing with milk and honey so we found
[1:38:52] that God God promised to people a
[1:38:55] designated land and today that land is
[1:38:58] being bombed by Iran it's being
[1:39:01] persecuted by all those over in Asia
[1:39:03] right now she's a burdensome Stone but
[1:39:05] yet it's a land that God chose God
[1:39:08] predestinated them to dwell in that land
[1:39:12] and God had promised you to dwell in
[1:39:14] this land see the opening of the book is
[1:39:17] not for
[1:39:19] everybody to the Baptist it's still
[1:39:21] closed to the Pentecost it's still
[1:39:24] closed to the Presbyterians it's still
[1:39:26] closed and to many message Believers
[1:39:28] it's still
[1:39:30] closed but to the bride to the elect
[1:39:32] it's an open
[1:39:34] book how many of you ever had a real
[1:39:36] difficult test in high
[1:39:38] school maybe some of y'all didn't go to
[1:39:40] high school in Kentucky I don't know I
[1:39:42] didn't get very many hands go up okay
[1:39:44] how many let's do this again I'm G to
[1:39:46] speak real slow how many have ever had a
[1:39:50] hard
[1:39:51] test that's much better I know I speak
[1:39:54] too fast of what it was you had a hard
[1:39:57] test and you were Fred all night about
[1:40:00] that
[1:40:00] test you try to cram and try to refra I
[1:40:03] mean r to retrain all the information
[1:40:06] but you get to school the next day and
[1:40:07] the teacher says all right kids it's
[1:40:09] open book W Glory I ain't got to wor
[1:40:15] about me in my ability to try to
[1:40:17] remember everything it's an open book
[1:40:19] all I got to do is start flipping
[1:40:21] through the pages start looking at at
[1:40:23] the chapters start looking at where this
[1:40:25] was and where that what am I telling you
[1:40:27] this morning I'm telling you it's an
[1:40:29] open book this morning you ain't got to
[1:40:31] worry about your ability it's already
[1:40:34] been loosed it's already been open he's
[1:40:36] already revealed it to you just start
[1:40:38] looking through the book start looking
[1:40:41] through the chapters every promise in
[1:40:43] the book is mine every chapter every
[1:40:45] verse every line oh it's Glory toide
[1:40:48] Church it belongs to you and it's open
[1:40:51] this morning
[1:40:58] so this is a land that God has selected
[1:41:03] for a special class of
[1:41:06] people this book ain't for
[1:41:08] everybody now the Bible
[1:41:11] yes but the open book became a new
[1:41:16] book came a different book because now
[1:41:19] the Revelation
[1:41:21] came that which is been hidden through
[1:41:24] seven Church ages had now been revealed
[1:41:27] because God sent a message to give it to
[1:41:31] you so when you read your
[1:41:34] Bible I hope you don't think you're
[1:41:36] reading the same way the Baptist read it
[1:41:38] the same way the Pentecost to read it no
[1:41:40] you're reading it with a whole new set
[1:41:41] of eyes with the eyes of vindication
[1:41:44] eyes of the pillar of fire because why
[1:41:47] because God has revealed the
[1:41:49] understanding of this book to you a
[1:41:51] special Hey Brother Brown we call a
[1:41:53] prophetic class of people a prophetic
[1:41:57] come on somebody I know we in Kentucky
[1:41:59] but prophetic is a pretty powerful word
[1:42:02] and that's how your Prophet described
[1:42:04] you you are a prophetic class of people
[1:42:06] not just an ordinary people not just a
[1:42:09] church goer not just somebody's going to
[1:42:11] occupy of you but you are a prophetic
[1:42:13] class of people God knew of your coming
[1:42:16] he prophesied of your coming and he sent
[1:42:18] a word to capture your heart to turn you
[1:42:21] back to the faith of the fathers
[1:42:25] good so to the present day believer our
[1:42:28] promised land is the open Word of God
[1:42:34] our promised land is the Holy Ghost and
[1:42:37] what is the Holy Ghost it's a personal
[1:42:39] revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:42:43] you so it's not just the Holy Ghost
[1:42:45] that's you know God used to be above
[1:42:48] them walking you know being above them
[1:42:49] then he came down and he walked with
[1:42:51] them but now in this day in this age is
[1:42:53] the Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ in us so
[1:42:57] we find it's Jesus Christ the land of
[1:42:59] our inheritance church is that God is
[1:43:02] trying to take a people and fill them
[1:43:04] with his spirit so that he can Rapture
[1:43:06] them out of
[1:43:08] here and take us to a literal
[1:43:11] land but
[1:43:13] notice God's Prophet led us out of
[1:43:15] denominational bondage into the opening
[1:43:18] of the word it's no longer a sealed book
[1:43:21] the people we are the people of the open
[1:43:23] book we are the people of the revealed
[1:43:25] word we are the people that can live and
[1:43:28] manifest every promise in this Bible
[1:43:31] nobody can do that but
[1:43:33] you come
[1:43:36] on the Bible says that all things are
[1:43:39] possible for them that are
[1:43:42] believe that's all you got to do is
[1:43:44] believe this
[1:43:45] morning notice a people that can live
[1:43:49] and manifest a full word of God both
[1:43:51] mechanics and and Dynamics signs and
[1:43:55] wonders you said well brother Joe we're
[1:43:57] taught we're not supposed to seek after
[1:43:59] signs and wonders no you're not but if
[1:44:01] you're a bonafied Believer signs of
[1:44:03] Wonders are going to identify that you
[1:44:05] are a son and daughter of God you not
[1:44:08] maybe not be seeking after you but you
[1:44:09] can't help it because you believe and
[1:44:12] they follow those that believe it's an
[1:44:14] identification that you are a son and
[1:44:17] daughter of God and so God is taking us
[1:44:19] into the land of signs and wonders where
[1:44:22] cancer can can be defeated where
[1:44:24] Miracles can take place where demon
[1:44:26] Spirits can be cast out that's the land
[1:44:28] that we're going to
[1:44:31] church a land where the supernatural we
[1:44:34] poured out in our lives in our homes in
[1:44:36] our churches and it's a land that's
[1:44:39] already been searched out by
[1:44:42] God so God knew in Elton Kentucky a
[1:44:45] little bitty small town in the middle of
[1:44:46] a bunch of fields where to put a
[1:44:49] church some of y'all need to say Amen to
[1:44:52] that otherwise you wouldn't have nowhere
[1:44:54] to go but God knew where to put a
[1:44:57] church cuz he knew there would be a
[1:44:59] people that would drive an hour and a
[1:45:01] half two hours some drive whatever to be
[1:45:04] here so they can hear the atmosphere
[1:45:06] they can see the change they can see
[1:45:08] when the power of God drops down all the
[1:45:11] things that they're battling the
[1:45:12] pressures of life that they're going
[1:45:14] through begin to lift off of them and we
[1:45:16] can have a supernatural outpouring of
[1:45:18] the Holy
[1:45:20] Ghost because it's a supernatural land
[1:45:23] that God has taken us
[1:45:25] into and it's already been searched out
[1:45:29] and that's why Satan fights us so hard
[1:45:30] brother Thomas he doesn't want you to
[1:45:32] make a footprint into that
[1:45:35] land cuz when you make a
[1:45:39] footprint and show that you possess that
[1:45:42] land you possess that promise you
[1:45:45] possess that healing brother Tommy you
[1:45:47] possess your young people brother John
[1:45:49] you possess your young people let me
[1:45:51] tell you when you put your foot on that
[1:45:53] Satan knows right then that you mean
[1:45:56] business and he's going to fight you to
[1:45:58] keep you from that he don't want you to
[1:46:00] occupy the promise he don't want you to
[1:46:02] come into the Revelation that yet that

[1:58:50] promise but it

[1:58:55] this morning but it's yours it belongs
[1:58:58] to you this
[1:59:00] morning oh Hallelujah notice the land of
[1:59:03] the word belongs to you you're not just
[1:59:05] here going you got to be here to be more
[1:59:08] than just persevering you got to fight
[1:59:11] and Satan's going to do everything he
[1:59:13] can to keep the Revelation from you
[1:59:15] you're going to have to fight through
[1:59:16] traditions of man you're going to have
[1:59:18] to fight through man-made ideas you know
[1:59:20] you're going to have to fight through
[1:59:21] what you know to hear the voice of God
[1:59:23] and the spirit moving in the house of
[1:59:25] God and notice when God was taking them
[1:59:27] into this land they were a wondering
[1:59:29] people they wandered 40 years in the
[1:59:32] desert because of their
[1:59:35] unbelief I ask you this morning how long
[1:59:37] are we going to keep going around that
[1:59:38] same proverbial Mountain how long are we
[1:59:41] going to keep kicking the can down the
[1:59:43] road waiting for this great service or
[1:59:45] that great service or my favorite
[1:59:46] preacher of this super anointing to come
[1:59:49] when are we going to go in they were
[1:59:50] three days journey from the
[1:59:53] land three days journey from the land
[1:59:57] they can look over brother Thomas the
[1:59:59] Propet was say they can look over and
[2:00:01] they can see every promise in the
[2:00:05] land but their unbelief kept them from
[2:00:08] occupying the
[2:00:10] promise their unbelief kept them they
[2:00:13] could see brother Tommy somebody else be
[2:00:16] delivered of cancer but what about
[2:00:20] me he's still God
[2:00:23] he never said just encamp about the
[2:00:25] mountain he said I've given you the
[2:00:29] land I've given you the land notice so
[2:00:32] we find that when that promised land was
[2:00:34] a land of their
[2:00:37] rest that they could cease from
[2:00:39] wandering around the desert they could
[2:00:42] cease from going around the mountain
[2:00:44] they could cease from making it all
[2:00:46] their efforts and all that hardship and
[2:00:48] all that now when they entered into that
[2:00:50] Promised Land it was land of rest in the
[2:00:53] Hebrews chapter 4 brother br will tell
[2:00:55] us what is the rest when did the rest
[2:00:57] come when the people spoke with tongues
[2:00:59] and had stammer lips and stammer lips he
[2:01:01] says that didn't they didn't speak
[2:01:03] nothing they stammered but when did it
[2:01:05] happen on the day of Pentecost when the
[2:01:07] Holy Ghost come that is the rest the
[2:01:10] Holy Ghost Jesus says come unto me all
[2:01:12] ye that are weary and heavy late and I
[2:01:15] will give you rest it's where you cease
[2:01:18] from your own worldly ideas and your own
[2:01:21] worldly ambition and you're on worldly
[2:01:23] efforts and you rest in the promised
[2:01:25] land of
[2:01:28] God so church I'll just tell you just
[2:01:32] because you speak in tongues don't mean
[2:01:33] it's
[2:01:34] it I'm going to share something with you
[2:01:36] right now that happened to us Wednesday
[2:01:38] night at our home church and I ain't
[2:01:40] going to go into all the details because
[2:01:41] it's pretty graphic but we had a young
[2:01:43] lady in our church she was invited by
[2:01:45] another sister of our church she works
[2:01:46] with her at a school and this young
[2:01:48] girl's 21 years old got four children
[2:01:50] ages probably what you say say nine to
[2:01:52] infant six to infant six to infancy she
[2:01:56] come up for prayer at the end of the
[2:01:57] service crying out to God wanting
[2:01:59] Deliverance so we all the ministry team
[2:02:02] knelt down and we begin to pray for
[2:02:03] brother Thomas and when she looked up
[2:02:06] she looked into my eyes and I'm like a I
[2:02:09] done seen this before I mean I looked
[2:02:12] into the eyes of a
[2:02:14] demon and she said I have made agreeance
[2:02:18] with this
[2:02:20] Spirit she says I have a spirit of
[2:02:24] divination I've been given discernment I
[2:02:27] have large
[2:02:30] discernment so this spirit that has
[2:02:33] occupied she says they're
[2:02:36] Legion they're many their Legion but
[2:02:38] she's wanting she's wanting freedom from
[2:02:41] this or these
[2:02:44] spirits and here she is we would begin
[2:02:46] to pray and and we would pray a little
[2:02:48] bit and you seem like a little bit of
[2:02:50] relief but then she's back you look in
[2:02:52] those eyes again and you see the same
[2:02:54] thing like this girl's not delivered
[2:02:56] this girl's not delivered this girl so
[2:02:58] we took her to a side room the ministry
[2:02:59] Cham and we had a sister come in there
[2:03:01] with us and we begin to deal with her
[2:03:03] and not just pray but brother Tim be to
[2:03:05] talk to her and she through this course
[2:03:08] of time she says I just became a
[2:03:10] Christian a year ago began to read my
[2:03:11] Bible and she just got out of the insane
[2:03:14] institution two weeks
[2:03:16] prior she said I was reading my Bible
[2:03:18] and I walked through there and it gave
[2:03:20] me a spirit of speaking in tongues
[2:03:22] and she said I could speak in Chinese
[2:03:24] and Bam she began to speak in fluid
[2:03:29] Chinese don't tell me that because you
[2:03:32] got the you can speak in tongues but you
[2:03:33] got the holy ghost that devil can speak
[2:03:37] in any language that we can speak in and
[2:03:40] this girl she worshiped that thing
[2:03:43] because it gave her power it gave her
[2:03:46] Credence it gave her purpose she could
[2:03:49] speak in tongu she could have
[2:03:50] discernment so she thought she had
[2:03:52] discernment brother Tim looked at her
[2:03:53] and said that's a lion Spirit that's a
[2:03:55] devil you don't have that's not from God
[2:03:58] so the devil has tricked her in thinking
[2:04:00] that everything that she'd received came
[2:04:02] from God because he impersonated the
[2:04:05] gifts of
[2:04:08] God now this young lady worshiped it so
[2:04:10] when you worship that Spirit you don't
[2:04:12] get delivered of it right so we did by
[2:04:15] the grace of God her countenance did
[2:04:17] change but she walked out she was still
[2:04:20] bound as bound as she was when she
[2:04:22] walked in but there is a desire for
[2:04:25] deliverance so I say all that to say
[2:04:28] this just because you can speak in
[2:04:29] tongues that's not rest you got to know
[2:04:32] that your heart has been changed your
[2:04:34] Nature has been changed your desires had
[2:04:37] been changed that you had a real
[2:04:40] experience with God and not just because
[2:04:42] you can feel the Goosebumps or you can
[2:04:44] feel the emotion and you can shout in a
[2:04:46] church service that ain't about it Satan
[2:04:48] can shout he can speak in tongu he can
[2:04:51] dance in the Spirit he can do all that
[2:04:53] but he can't live the life what am I
[2:04:56] telling you he can't live he can't put a
[2:05:00] footprint on the promise but you can
[2:05:03] this morning you can step out there with
[2:05:05] a change life and say this is my land of
[2:05:10] inheritance let me go on a little bit
[2:05:12] further brother Brown says there's three
[2:05:13] stages of the journey it typed J he said
[2:05:16] now there's the first stage was leaving
[2:05:18] Egypt the second stage was the
[2:05:20] Wilderness and the third third stage was
[2:05:23] Canaan and he said Canan does not
[2:05:24] represent the age of the Millennium it
[2:05:26] only represents the age excuse me of the
[2:05:29] Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming
[2:05:33] in Revelations 21:7 says he that
[2:05:35] overcometh shall inherit all
[2:05:39] things how many of you Overcomers this
[2:05:42] morning all right so we're living in the
[2:05:45] age brother Thomas of the final
[2:05:49] Overcomer I'm the final fin
[2:05:52] Overcomer there's not another age
[2:05:55] promise there's not another messenger
[2:05:56] promise I am the final
[2:06:00] Overcomer so notice the land here
[2:06:03] brother B says now what is the land
[2:06:05] promised to the New Testament believer
[2:06:07] he said the promise is the Holy
[2:06:11] Ghost so there's three stages of the
[2:06:13] journey and numbers 33 and verse 54
[2:06:16] we're going to start driving this home
[2:06:18] driving it I'm about to start I'm going
[2:06:20] to start Landing this airplane been
[2:06:22] flying is that all right I know brother
[2:06:25] J for y'all used to have him he'd
[2:06:26] parachute out there's times I parachuted
[2:06:29] out last weekend that brother said
[2:06:30] brother Joe why didn't you pray for
[2:06:32] anybody like man I was sick and tired I
[2:06:34] was
[2:06:37] done sometimes you just got to be a
[2:06:39] preacher right to understand it but we
[2:06:41] find I want to go down this road just as
[2:06:43] we begin to close because we're looking
[2:06:45] at footprints in the land of inheritance
[2:06:48] so what is an inheritance let's go here
[2:06:50] and it says you shall de abide The Land
[2:06:52] by lot for an inheritance among your
[2:06:55] families and to the more you shall give
[2:06:58] the more and to the fewer you shall give
[2:07:00] to fewer but every man's inheritance
[2:07:02] shall be in the place where his lot
[2:07:04] follow so every believer has an
[2:07:08] inheritance you that have great faith
[2:07:12] there's going to be a little bit more
[2:07:12] land for you because you have faith to
[2:07:15] occupy the
[2:07:17] land how many of you are familiar with
[2:07:19] the prayer of jabz
[2:07:22] increase my borders enlarge my Coast see
[2:07:27] JZ wasn't just settling for just one
[2:07:29] Revelation Jaz wanted everything that
[2:07:32] God had for him he was going into that
[2:07:34] land he said Lord enlarge my Coast Lord
[2:07:37] enlarge my borders and that should be
[2:07:39] the prayer of every believer this
[2:07:41] morning God increase my understanding
[2:07:44] increase my Revelation Lord I'm going
[2:07:46] into that land of promise I want all
[2:07:48] that you have for me I want everything
[2:07:51] in the land I want the contents in the
[2:07:53] land from border to border I Want It All
[2:07:55] anything outside the Border but I'm not
[2:07:58] worried about that but I want what
[2:08:00] pertains to me as an overcomer believer
[2:08:03] this
[2:08:04] hour so we find you shall divide the
[2:08:07] land by lot then we look here but it
[2:08:09] wasn't so from the beginning and and
[2:08:11] this is paragraph 20 brother B says we
[2:08:13] Noti on the day of Pentecost when the
[2:08:15] Holy Spirit returned the pillar of fire
[2:08:18] just separated itself in tongues of Fire
[2:08:21] sat upon each of them they were all
[2:08:23] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[2:08:25] speak in tongues as the spirit gave them
[2:08:27] utterance now tongues licks of fire sat
[2:08:30] upon each of them what was it God
[2:08:32] dividing himself the
[2:08:35] spirit where he had Jesus with it
[2:08:38] without measure now we have it by
[2:08:40] measure but it's the same spirit so we
[2:08:42] find here in numbers 33 you shall divide
[2:08:46] the land their inheritance and then on
[2:08:48] the day of Pentecost God the pillar of
[2:08:51] Fire that came from the logos begin to
[2:08:53] divide
[2:08:55] itself it begin to divide itself and say
[2:08:58] this is the land I'm giving you the
[2:09:01] portion that belongs to you this morning
[2:09:04] and when you got the Holy Ghost Church
[2:09:06] it means you got eternal life it means
[2:09:08] you got everything that God has it means
[2:09:11] that we're join a with Jesus Christ all
[2:09:14] that he had we had all that belonged to
[2:09:17] him belongs to us he had it without
[2:09:20] measure we got it with measure but the
[2:09:23] land was being divided
[2:09:25] up oh that's
[2:09:28] beautiful so the pillar of fire that
[2:09:30] came from the logos divided itself up
[2:09:34] and what he did that day he's the same
[2:09:38] today he showing that the land of
[2:09:41] promise to the believer is the Holy
[2:09:43] Ghost notice you shall divide the land
[2:09:47] by lot for an inheritance
[2:09:52] this word
[2:09:54] inheritance Adriana what's it
[2:09:58] mean I told you I get the last
[2:10:05] say notice now this word inheritant
[2:10:08] means to receive an irrevocable
[2:10:12] gift oh I don't think y'all heard that
[2:10:15] maybe you don't know what irrevocable
[2:10:17] means I'm glad you asked cuz I'm going
[2:10:19] to tell it to you an irrevocable able
[2:10:21] gift with an emphasis of a special
[2:10:24] relationship between the benefactor and
[2:10:26] the recipient so this word irrevocable
[2:10:29] means it can't be revoked it can't be
[2:10:32] recalled unable to be repealed not able
[2:10:34] to be an knowed not able to be altered
[2:10:36] so what am I telling you when God gives
[2:10:38] you the Holy Ghost it can't be recalled
[2:10:41] it can't be aled it can't be separated
[2:10:44] he ain't going to call it back it's an
[2:10:46] irrevocable gift based on a special
[2:10:49] relationship oh Hallelujah somebody
[2:10:51] should speak in tongues right now
[2:10:54] irrevocable gift that God has given to
[2:10:56] you
[2:10:59] Church it means the third pool is your
[2:11:02] promise the open word is your promise

[2:21:34] inheritance of it he says so when he
[2:21:36] stepped out on God's promise watch what
[2:21:38] happened Abraham oh my listen to it

[2:22:17] and a hallelujah look through the
