[28:37] this morning I think brother Joe had it
[28:38] on uh one of his Pages or something on
[28:41] the Internet there but um it was a
[28:44] little clip there that somebody put out
[28:45] and it was talking about the message and
[28:47] and different things and it and it said
[28:50] don't ever think that becoming a
[28:51] Christian will make your life
[28:54] easy you're an enlisted soldier in God's
[28:57] Army yeah do you think about that you're
[29:00] an enlisted soldier in God's Army and
[29:03] then the next thing was the Holy Spirit
[29:05] will teach you how to fight aren't you
[29:08] thankful for the Holy Spirit tonight
[29:10] amen I I want to speak to you tonight
[29:12] and it was just fitting that that come
[29:14] up because uh I want to speak to you on
[29:16] fighting for possession fighting for
[29:19] possession and if you want to get your
[29:21] Bibles and you want to turn to the book
[29:22] of Deuteronomy and we'll be reading
[29:24] there and I've I've preached and spoke
[29:26] some of these thoughts before but I'm
[29:27] going to go a little different Direction
[29:29] with them so if you hear something that
[29:31] you hadn't heard or that you've heard in
[29:33] in a few months prior just uh just say
[29:36] well I needed to hear it again and we'll
[29:37] we'll keep on building on it okay so uh
[29:41] the prophet tells us this in in the the
[29:44] message preparation and I want you to
[29:46] listen to what he says here he says
[29:48] little old shamgar stood there and
[29:50] thought well I ain't no Soldier I don't
[29:53] know how to fight I don't know nothing
[29:56] about it and he said says but the to to
[29:59] you holy people I want you to know his
[30:01] righteous ignation got
[30:04] up he said I hope yours does too a
[30:07] little bit tonight he says get up
[30:10] against evil get up against that old
[30:13] wheelchair get up against them crutches
[30:16] he says what the devil stuck on them
[30:19] don't have to be to them no sir he says
[30:23] they don't belong to you so these things
[30:26] that the devil is putting on us they
[30:28] don't belong to us anyway he says Christ
[30:31] said should not this daughter be loosed
[30:34] on the Sabbath day that's been bound
[30:36] with the devil all these
[30:38] years how many wants to be loosed from
[30:40] any bondage that Satan can put on us it
[30:43] may have been years and years and years
[30:45] you've been fighting this battle but he
[30:48] says it's going to be up to
[30:52] you wow it's going to be up to you so
[30:56] let's just bow our heads before we go
[30:58] and read the word and and just dedicate
[31:00] the evening to the to the Lord here so

[31:04] tonight Lord thankful for the day you've
[31:06] given us thankful for the message this
[31:08] morning Lord that stirred our hearts and
[31:10] Lord we just ask that you would just uh
[31:12] just take these uh hungry hearts that
[31:14] are here tonight Lord and though they
[31:16] may be weary and tired in flesh but just
[31:19] energize us through the holy spirit that
[31:21] we could just dedicate a few minutes of
[31:23] our time to to fully focus on what you
[31:25] would have in store for us and the
[31:27] thought thoughts and hopefully that will

[31:48] out of the way and allow the people to
[31:50] pull for the needs that's upon their
[31:52] heart Lord and you know those needs so
[31:54] we just ask that you would deliver
[31:56] tonight in Jesus name amen amen
[31:58] Deuteronomy chapter 11 and I'm going to
[32:00] try to not to hold hold us long I know
[32:02] you're tired I know you you've had a
[32:04] good meal and and uh just just Naturally
[32:07] Speaking when when you eat the blood
[32:09] leaves your brain goes to your belly to
[32:11] digest the food so you get tired you get
[32:13] weary that's just the way our bodies
[32:15] work so let's just uh let's just uh set
[32:18] that all aside for a few minutes and
[32:19] let's take about 45 minutes if we could
[32:21] and and we'll go from there and see what
[32:23] happens so Deuteronomy chapter
[32:26] 11 that's your days may be multiplied
[32:29] and the days of your children in the
[32:32] land which the Lord swear unto your
[32:34] fathers to give them as the days of
[32:37] Heaven upon the Earth for if ye watch
[32:40] now if ye shall diligently keep all
[32:42] these Commandments which I command you
[32:45] to do them watch what he says to love
[32:48] the Lord your God to walk in all his
[32:52] ways not some of his ways not the ways
[32:54] that you like not the ones that that are
[32:56] pleasing to the flesh but if you'll walk
[32:58] in all of his ways and to cleave unto
[33:03] him then will the Lord drive out all
[33:07] these nations from before you and ye
[33:10] shall possess greater Nations and
[33:14] mightier than
[33:16] yourselves wow every place every place
[33:22] every
[33:24] place where on the souls of your feet
[33:26] shall tread shall be yours from the
[33:29] Wilderness and Lebanon from the river
[33:31] the river Euphrates even unto the
[33:33] uttermost sea shall your Coast
[33:37] be so what the Bible is telling us here
[33:40] as we look at this it's telling us that
[33:43] if the Lord will drive out all of these
[33:45] nations so we could replace the word
[33:47] Nations there and we could put
[33:49] challenges battles afflictions
[33:54] sicknesses insecurities that's right we
[33:57] put all of these here and he will says
[33:59] he will drive all these nations before
[34:01] you and you shall possess greater
[34:04] Nations and mightier than yourself so to
[34:07] me I'm weak where it says mightier than
[34:09] myself I am weak I I can't battle the
[34:12] devil on my own I'll just be honest and
[34:14] tell you I can't fight him on my own
[34:16] that's why I have to be filled with the
[34:18] Holy Ghost and the Bible tells us that
[34:21] greater is he that is in me than he that
[34:23] is in the world so there is where we
[34:25] find ourselves now fighting and we're
[34:28] mightier than
[34:30] ourselves every place let's go on down
[34:33] there shall be no man can we say no
[34:36] devil I'm not trying to add to the word
[34:37] but I'm just trying to type it
[34:39] here there shall be no devil no sickness
[34:42] no desire no flesh lust of the flesh
[34:47] that would be able to stand before you
[34:50] for the Lord your God shall lay the fear
[34:53] of you and the dread of you upon all the
[34:55] land and you shall Tre that you shall
[34:58] tread upon as he has said unto you so
[35:00] you mean to tell me tonight brothers and
[35:02] sisters that that God's commission here
[35:05] tells me that I no longer have to fear
[35:07] Satan but Satan should be fearing
[35:10] us we are enlisted
[35:13] soldiers we're not the ones to cow down
[35:15] and to back away and to say let Satan
[35:18] walk and run all over us but the Bible
[35:21] says the commission here is that he will
[35:23] lay the fear of you up on and the dread
[35:27] of you upon all of the land we say of
[35:30] Satan are you with me may the Lord add
[35:34] His blessings to the reading of the word
[35:35] you can have your seats
[35:37] tonight so I've been preaching on this
[35:40] for the last couple times I had to speak
[35:41] at the school this last Thursday and and
[35:44] I'm I'm going to go a little different
[35:45] direction but we preached some of this
[35:47] at brother Luke's and and and it's just
[35:49] been on my heart so we're just going to
[35:50] stay with it and and we look here and we
[35:53] see the children of Israel and God is
[35:55] making a promise to the children of
[35:58] Israel after them being in bondage for
[35:59] over
[36:00] 400 years 400 years they find themselves
[36:05] down in the Egypt and under a pharaoh a
[36:07] and now all of a sudden they find
[36:09] themselves being getting ready to be
[36:10] delivered and so no doubt this was an
[36:13] exciting time in the in the children of
[36:15] Israel in their lives there was a reason
[36:18] why Miriam picked up the tambourine and
[36:19] there's a reason why she shook that
[36:21] tambourine there's a reason why they
[36:23] danced and they cheered and they shouted
[36:25] because they were in bondage for over
[36:27] four 100
[36:30] years and I spoke this at the school the
[36:32] other day and and I was applying it to
[36:34] an exciting time for for
[36:37] students because you know students they
[36:39] think when they're in school they're in
[36:41] bondage and they're under the task
[36:44] Masters and so I I spoke to them and I
[36:47] told them listen now seniors stand up we
[36:49] want to recognize you so we had all the
[36:51] senior stand up and we clap for them and
[36:53] I said but you know we're happy for you
[36:56] you should be happy for yourself but let
[36:58] me tell you not all of you sitting here
[37:01] I said let me tell you your journey is
[37:03] just now
[37:05] beginning your journey in life is just
[37:07] now beginning we have three here that
[37:10] just finished up their real estate let
[37:11] me tell you their journey in life is
[37:13] just now
[37:16] beginning and so when we look at this
[37:18] here and we see the children of Israel
[37:20] they're standing in a place in a time
[37:22] under the rulership of pharaoh where
[37:24] they're making bricks day after day
[37:26] after day and they're laboring and in
[37:29] this bondage and and so as they're
[37:32] making these bricks we've went over it
[37:34] before they're waiting through the mud
[37:35] pits now I want you to keep in mind as
[37:37] we're talking about fighting for
[37:39] possession they're waiting in these mud
[37:41] pits and the these feet that they're
[37:44] squishing the mud with there's no
[37:47] possession of anything under those feet
[37:49] at this time they possess no Freedom
[37:52] they possess no Deliverance they possess
[37:55] no happiness they possess possess no Joy
[37:58] No Love they possess nothing of the
[38:01] goodness of God only thing under their
[38:03] feet is squishing mud mire clay and
[38:07] straw
[38:09] right think about
[38:11] it but finally God decides and tells
[38:14] them I'm going to make a move and God
[38:17] begins to to deliver the children of
[38:19] Israel out of this bondage now he he
[38:21] don't come to him and tell him now I'm
[38:23] going to make this easy because you know
[38:25] what you you children I've been watching
[38:27] you and and you've worked hard all these
[38:29] days and you've labored and you've been
[38:30] under this bondage and this this slavery
[38:32] of this
[38:33] Tyrant he doesn't come and say so so I'm
[38:36] going to just make this easy for you and
[38:38] and I'm gonna do all the work for
[38:40] you I I'm gonna do all the work for you
[38:43] and give you this promised land no he
[38:44] doesn't do that but he places them into
[38:47] a journey he places them into a
[38:50] Wilderness of
[38:52] Life A wilderness of life you know
[38:55] Wilderness can be a wild place
[38:58] when you're in the wilderness things can
[38:59] come at you from every angle when you're
[39:01] in the wilderness and you're in the dark
[39:03] and you have no light things can kind of
[39:05] spook you and scare you might we
[39:08] say but here they are on a Wilderness in
[39:10] life and a journey that should have
[39:12] taken them four or five days to go from
[39:14] from the Red Sea into the promised land
[39:16] of Canaan this five- day journey is now
[39:19] stretched out into 40
[39:22] years are you with me 40 years now I'm
[39:26] not trying to enourage anybody tonight
[39:28] but the reality of it is we got to
[39:32] fight the children of Israel had to
[39:34] fight they had a fight ahead of them
[39:36] there's going to be challenges there's
[39:38] going to be complexes insecurities
[39:40] there's going to be things that we Face
[39:42] problems at home I don't know what it
[39:45] is problem your job problems in your
[39:48] career problems in your
[39:54] business you got to fight
[39:57] you got to fight God's promises are
[40:00] still there nothing changed when those
[40:02] children of Israel were dobbing in the
[40:04] mud day after day after day and treading
[40:07] and making brick after brick after brick
[40:09] even though they didn't realize it God
[40:12] still had a promise that would never
[40:15] fail your promises of God will never
[40:18] fail you just have to keep walking you
[40:21] got to keep believing you got to keep
[40:23] knowing that there is a promised land
[40:25] for you and that God will not not give
[40:27] up on you that he said he will be with
[40:29] you even in you until the end of the
[40:31] world but you got to
[40:36] fight brother Bown said let's just go
[40:38] forward and Conquer
[40:41] it that's easy to say isn't it let's
[40:45] just go forward and Conquer it he said
[40:47] remember Joshua was told every place
[40:49] that The Souls of your footstep that's
[40:51] possession he says Brothers the footstep
[40:54] means possession so let's just keep
[40:56] walking into the Promised Land Not
[40:58] Looking Back to see happen back there he
[41:01] said or what somebody else is doing but
[41:03] keep your eyes on Jesus you know he said
[41:07] if you look in the rearview mirror
[41:08] you're bound to wreck we shouldn't be
[41:11] looking back but keep going forward and
[41:13] keep Our Eyes Upon Jesus and he said
[41:15] when you keep moving on like that you
[41:17] get into deeper depths and higher
[41:20] Heights and then you're beginning to
[41:22] possess everything that God give you in
[41:25] his word
[41:27] thank you Lord we need the possession of
[41:29] Jes of what Jesus has for
[41:36] us but you got to
[41:39] fight you got to fight you can't be like
[41:43] that two and a
[41:44] half you know I talked about the two and
[41:46] a half before and some of you looked at
[41:48] me puzzled didn't really didn't know
[41:49] where I was going or or maybe hadn't
[41:51] rehearsed that story as much but the two
[41:54] and a half that stayed out on the
[41:55] outside of the river
[41:58] the two and a half tribes uh Gad and and
[42:01] Reuben and half of
[42:02] Manasseh when they come up to the
[42:04] promised lamb when they come up to the
[42:06] river they said you know what this looks
[42:07] really good over here we think we just
[42:10] want to stay right here because we raise
[42:11] cattle and the cattle love Green Grass
[42:15] and Moses this is the greenest grass
[42:17] we've ever seen so if it's okay with you
[42:19] we'll just take our inheritance right
[42:21] here brothers and sisters there ain't no
[42:23] place for us just to stop on the
[42:25] outskirts
[42:28] what was their problem their problem was
[42:29] with
[42:30] selfishness their problem was with
[42:32] selfishness that we want what we want we
[42:35] want to make our money we want to raise
[42:38] our cattle we want to see our herds and
[42:41] flocks to increase so we're just going
[42:43] to stay right here we'll still call
[42:45] ourselves the children of Israel we'll
[42:47] still call ourselves the bride of Christ
[42:50] are you with me but I think we'll just
[42:52] stay out here and linger outside of
[42:54] where the real where the real message is
[42:57] is is is taking
[42:59] place yeah so here was that two and a
[43:02] half living right there outside of the
[43:05] river but here we see the children of
[43:07] Israel come up to this River and you
[43:09] know God has a way of always reminding
[43:11] us how Mighty he is God has a way of
[43:14] telling us that he's the most powerful
[43:15] that he's omnipotent there is nothing
[43:18] that can stand in his way and as God
[43:20] standing there we look at this and the
[43:22] Bible tells us that it was the time of
[43:24] harvest and as the time of harvest this
[43:27] river that was normally 100t wide so we
[43:30] might say uh twice the length of this or
[43:33] the width of this building maybe the
[43:35] maybe from this wall to that wall 100
[43:40] feet 100 foot wide river how many of you
[43:44] think that you could swim that if you
[43:45] had to your life depended on it 100 feet
[43:49] come on you could doggy pedal across
[43:51] there
[44:00] but now God pulls them up here to this
[44:02] River at the time of harvest and it's no
[44:04] longer 100 foot wide but now this river
[44:07] is a mile wide outside of its
[44:11] banks a mile wide outside of its banks
[44:15] and Joshua looks at this and he begins
[44:17] to think how am I going to get across
[44:19] this how am I going to take these people
[44:21] across here so that we can get into the
[44:23] God's Promised Land the land that he has
[44:26] promised every one of us is ours how am
[44:29] I going to get across it he didn't have
[44:32] a negative mind he didn't look at it and
[44:35] say well I I I guess we've gone as far
[44:37] as we can
[44:38] go I guess God's done
[44:41] healing I guess God's done
[44:44] delivering I guess God's done saving
[44:47] he's brought us up to a place that's
[44:53] impossible no he didn't have that
[44:55] attitude but he began to look at this
[44:56] and he he said you know what I I I don't
[44:59] know how we're going to do this at this
[45:00] very moment but I tell you one thing I
[45:02] remember back in the word in the
[45:05] scriptures in the Scrolls it was said
[45:07] that if we would diligently keep all of
[45:09] his
[45:11] Commandments and if we would love the
[45:13] Lord Our God and if we would walk in all
[45:16] of his ways and if we would cleave unto
[45:21] him he'll give us every place the so of
[45:24] our feet touch
[45:28] that's how we're going to do it we're
[45:30] going to walk and we're going to love
[45:33] we're going to cleave on to God you know
[45:35] that word cleave means to glue or to
[45:37] adhere and stick in in the Book of
[45:40] Genesis it's expressive to say
[45:42] cling so I'm going to cling to my God
[45:46] I'm going to hold fast to my God where
[45:49] other what other place in the Bible do
[45:51] we see an illustration similar to this
[45:52] we look in the Book of Ruth you look at
[45:55] the Book of Ruth and you see that that
[45:57] Naomi here's Naomi and her husband died
[46:00] and here she's left with two sons and
[46:02] and they take them wives right Ora and
[46:06] Ruth and so here we're going through
[46:08] time here and a few time a few days or a
[46:10] few years pass and and here's M and and
[46:13] and chilon I think how you say his name
[46:16] both of them died that's the husbands of
[46:18] Ruth and Ruth and
[46:19] orpa and now here they are they're
[46:22] sitting here moaning they're grieving
[46:26] they're lost lost their whole world's
[46:28] been turned upside down because of the
[46:30] loss of their husband and Naomi looks at
[46:33] her two daughter-in-laws and says each
[46:35] one of you need to go back to your
[46:37] mother's
[46:42] house go back to the way you used to
[46:46] live are you with me go back and she's
[46:50] telling them go back and deal with the
[46:52] dead deal with that deal kind let the
[46:54] Lord deal with you there there you can
[46:56] find rest there maybe you'll find you
[46:59] another husband surely he'll be with you
[47:02] go there do this and Naomi says turn
[47:05] turn and go go with the go there and her
[47:08] daughters look at this and say no we
[47:10] want to stay with you and again she
[47:13] urges them I'm too old can't you see
[47:15] that I even if I had a child in my womb
[47:18] today they would never be old enough for
[47:20] you to marry Go Your Own Way go back to
[47:23] the old ways that you used to live go
[47:25] back to your Gods that's what she told
[47:28] them go back to your
[47:31] gods and they lifted up their voice it
[47:34] says and wept again now I want you to
[47:37] watch and it says orpa kissed her
[47:41] mother-in-law oh
[47:43] no we could say maybe she's she's been
[47:45] hanging around that two and a half too
[47:48] long because now orpa it says in the
[47:51] next scripture it says that she's gone
[47:52] back to her people so orpa has kissed
[47:56] Naomi goodbye
[47:58] even though she has the same last
[48:02] name the children of Israel the same
[48:06] tribes lingering outside of the promised
[48:09] land orpa lingering outside of the what
[48:12] was promis for her but it says if you
[48:15] read on it says but Ruth what
[48:20] clave Ruth clave unto her Ruth onto her
[48:25] Ruth clinged on to her and Ruth why how
[48:29] could Ruth do that the prophet said that
[48:32] Ruth was a type of the Gentile bride so
[48:35] there was something that Ruth was
[48:36] looking through the eyes of the Bride of
[48:38] Jesus Christ and as she began to look
[48:40] through those eyes what did she say she
[48:43] said entreat me not to leave thee
[48:46] entreat me not to leave thee nor to
[48:48] return after following thee whether you
[48:50] go I'm going to go where you Lodge I'll
[48:53] Lodge your people shall be my people
[48:56] there was some something special that
[48:57] Ruth could see into the future she could
[48:59] see by a vision that I am a special
[49:02] person and no doubt God's got a promise
[49:05] for me and if he's got a promise for me
[49:07] he must have a kinsman redeemer for me
[49:17] somewhere so that back to
[49:20] Joshua and Joshua begins to remember
[49:22] those
[49:24] words and he says brothers and sisters
[49:28] we got to keep God
[49:30] first we got to keep God first in our
[49:33] lives and you know our Pastor said this
[49:36] morning he said you know uh his words
[49:39] kind of paraphrasing he said Don't
[49:40] expect to go in the rap rapture with
[49:42] filthy living is that what he said this
[49:45] morning how many heard that raise your
[49:46] hand if he was listening this morning
[49:48] all right now we know who
[49:53] wasn't but he said Don't expect to go
[49:56] into the rap
[49:57] with your filthy
[49:59] living Joshua looks at these people and
[50:01] says keep God first and sanctify your
[50:07] lives sanctify your lives clean up your
[50:11] lives clean up the life that you're
[50:12] living He says and watch God do wonders
[50:16] before us he knew God wasn't going to
[50:20] move on the scene live in any old way
[50:22] they could God is not going to answer
[50:24] your prayers he's not going to move on
[50:26] your seen if we're living any old way
[50:28] that we
[50:31] want so it's Bible says they take the
[50:34] Covenant of the Lord and the and the and
[50:38] the Ark of the Covenant and it says
[50:41] that they took 12 men one out of each of
[50:43] the tribes and as soon as the as the ark
[50:48] passed and the priests that were bearing
[50:50] it as soon as it passed into the Waters
[50:52] of the Jordan that the Waters of the
[50:54] Jordan shall be cut off from down from
[50:58] above and from which they
[51:01] stand so you got these
[51:04] priests and they take this
[51:06] Ark and they place this Ark upon their
[51:12] shoulders and they begin to
[51:15] walk they've they've cleaned their lives
[51:18] up they've come out of Egypt they've
[51:21] been in the wilderness brother Bram said
[51:23] that was justification sanctification
[51:26] and now Canaan is getting filled with
[51:29] the Holy
[51:30] Ghost and in order for them to get
[51:32] filled with the Holy Ghost they've G to
[51:34] have to put God first in their
[51:36] life so now these these Levi priests are
[51:40] carrying this Ark and they begin to
[51:42] carry this Ark and they're walking and
[51:44] they're walking and they're walking now
[51:47] can you imagine the feeling as they
[51:48] begin to reach and get up on the brink
[51:50] of this of this Jordan
[51:52] River because the Bible tells us as They
[51:55] Carried the ark and the people kept
[51:57] their eyes upon the
[51:59] ark the ark that was filled with Aaron's
[52:01] budding Rod it was filled with the Mana
[52:05] that they were fed with in the
[52:07] wilderness it was fed with the word of
[52:09] God the Ten Commandments and now they
[52:11] take this Ark which is God before them
[52:14] and as they step into the
[52:19] water the flood waters raised
[52:22] now it says as they stepped into that
[52:25] water that they stood stood there on
[52:27] firm dry
[52:32] ground I said firm dry
[52:37] ground I wasn't going to tell this but
[52:39] I'm just going to tell it again Carson
[52:42] he he call his I didn't call his name at
[52:45] the school the other day but I call his
[52:47] name
[52:48] here he decides we we drained this pond
[52:51] at our
[52:52] house and we drain the pond and the
[52:54] water leaves and then you know we leave
[52:56] it dried and they they dug it out and
[52:58] cleaned it out and so we we wait for it
[53:01] to fill back up so it's all look like
[53:03] it's filling up you know look good but
[53:06] it's it's crusty all around where the
[53:08] water had risen to and it's crusty and
[53:12] dry and I'm sitting at the house and I
[53:15] hear the four-wheeler about to blow
[53:18] a blow
[53:23] up I'm like what in the world is that
[53:26] that kid doing so I step on the back
[53:28] porch and I'm looking and listening and
[53:30] then I figure out where it's coming from
[53:32] so I get I I just take off walking
[53:34] through the woods and I'll go over there
[53:36] and there he is about this
[53:39] deep in what appeared to be dry
[53:44] ground the ground was crusty the ground
[53:47] was cratered it was crusty and here he
[53:50] stood about this de I said what are you
[53:52] doing he said I was going to drive
[53:54] around the pond I thought it was dry I
[53:56] said said don't you know his thing's
[53:57] been holding water for the last 50
[54:00] years don't you think it's a little
[54:02] Mucky a little
[54:03] mire so here I go tring out
[54:06] there to try to help get it out we got
[54:09] the fourwheeler out he lost his boots
[54:10] they're still to be
[54:12] found but that wasn't the case with the
[54:15] children of
[54:16] Israel when they went across there it
[54:19] says it was heaped up on dry
[54:22] Ground God does the
[54:24] impossible God makes things happen he
[54:27] don't halfway do something them them
[54:30] feet that they used to walk in and and
[54:32] and tread through mud and mire and that
[54:34] mud squeezed up through their toes they
[54:36] went across there and dust puffing out
[54:37] under their
[54:45] feet so if we put God first in our
[54:49] lives there's no room for filthy
[54:53] living are you with me
[54:56] as long as we keep God first in our
[54:58] lives there's no room for filthy music
[55:01] filthy movies filthy thoughts filthy
[55:04] things to
[55:05] do no because why if you got God first
[55:08] when those things those thoughts hit you
[55:10] those songs hit you those movies hit you
[55:12] you say uh this is not
[55:14] pleasing because I got my Ark
[55:17] first I got my God first in my
[55:22] life the prophet says
[55:26] he says now Canaan doesn't represent the
[55:28] age of the Millennium no he says it only
[55:32] represents I like this the age of the
[55:37] Overcomer it's the dispensation of
[55:39] overcoming because in Canaan they still
[55:42] killed they burned they took cities and
[55:44] there will be no death in the Millennium
[55:47] a lot of times people years ago tried to
[55:49] put make the canaan's land this was
[55:51] Heaven I don't know I don't feel like
[55:53] I'm in
[55:54] heaven but I do feel like I've been
[55:56] given some
[55:58] promises I do feel like I there there's
[56:00] been some Deliverance given I do feel
[56:03] like I can call upon the god a God our
[56:06] God who will give us healings I do feel
[56:08] like there is a God that that makes us
[56:11] Overcomers but I'm not in
[56:14] heaven I hurt too bad to be in
[56:21] heaven so just because we get saved and
[56:24] filled and filled with the Holy ghost
[56:26] doesn't mean that our battle's
[56:28] over no it's just the beginning so when
[56:31] the children of Israel crossed over into
[56:33] crossed over that River into canaan's
[56:35] land that's when their battles really
[56:36] started to begin as Holy Ghost filled
[56:39] Believers because brother Brown sat over
[56:41] in canaan's land that was the Holy
[56:44] Ghost and so here we are their battle's
[56:46] now beginning because Satan's not going
[56:48] to be
[56:49] slothful did you ever realize that if if
[56:53] if you're if you're happy today
[56:57] yeah Satan's not
[56:59] happy if you get delivered today he's
[57:03] not
[57:05] happy I if you find forgiveness in your
[57:08] heart for a brother and he knows that
[57:10] you've genuinely forgiven somebody boy
[57:13] he's going to throw it at you
[57:15] tomorrow why because he's not slothful
[57:18] in his actions he wants you to be the
[57:19] most miserable person that you can
[57:21] possibly be he don't want you to have
[57:23] any Joy so he throws you temptation
[57:28] yeah sure he does he he throws these
[57:31] things at you he throws you things to
[57:33] look at he throws you things to listen
[57:36] to to catch your
[57:38] attention you can be having the most
[57:40] glorious day Holy Ghost filled Bible
[57:43] Bible reading song singing day of your
[57:45] life and go into Lowe's and you'll hear
[57:47] something that you hadn't heard since
[57:48] you were
[57:50] 16 but what do you begin to
[57:54] sing uh we're here
[57:57] human but that's the way Satan Works he
[57:59] begins to throw these things at you over
[58:01] and over so there's your battle there's
[58:05] your battle right there and the prophet
[58:06] said what is the land promised to the
[58:09] New Testament believer it's the promise
[58:11] of the Holy Spirit he says for it shall
[58:14] come to pass in Joel 2:28 that I will
[58:16] pour my spirit upon All Flesh your sons
[58:19] and daughters shall prophesy your
[58:21] handmaids and Maid servants I will pour
[58:23] out my spirit and they shall prophesy I
[58:25] will will show wonders in the heavens
[58:27] above and in the earth and the pillars
[58:29] of fire and smoke and
[58:32] Vapor the prophet says but did you
[58:34] notice
[58:35] Joshua before they crossed over he said
[58:38] go into the midst of the CL camp and
[58:39] clean your clothes sanctify every one of
[58:43] you and let no man come with his wife
[58:45] within three days if you want to see the
[58:47] glory of
[58:49] God he said what was that he said they
[58:52] were getting ready to inherit a promise
[58:55] you see God gave Abraham the promise of
[58:57] the land of Palestine it was to be
[59:00] theirs their possession forever they was
[59:03] always to remain in the
[59:05] land we can get political right there
[59:07] can't
[59:10] we God gave the children of Israel the
[59:13] land of Palestine so what's a protest
[59:18] about I wonder how many of them
[59:20] protesters are pro Palestinians are are
[59:23] say they're
[59:24] Christians I'd like to know know because
[59:27] I'd like to know do you if you're
[59:28] Christians do you read your
[59:30] scriptures do you read your Bibles do
[59:33] you know what God's promised to Israel
[59:37] was that's free I just had to share
[59:40] that he said they didn't own nothing in
[59:43] the
[59:44] wilderness how many can remember a time
[59:46] in your life before you before you come
[59:49] up to the promised land before you got
[59:50] filled with the Holy Ghost before you
[59:52] gave your life to Christ that you didn't
[59:53] have nothing in the wilderness you were
[59:56] lost you didn't have no happiness you
[59:58] were thirsting for something but you
[1:00:01] didn't know what it was and you didn't
[1:00:02] have it and so here they were they were
[1:00:04] out there in the wilderness with nothing
[1:00:07] he said then they came into Canaan he
[1:00:10] said and when they came into Canaan then
[1:00:12] they had
[1:00:13] rights oh brothers and sisters aren't
[1:00:16] you thankful tonight that we've got
[1:00:18] rights he said we've got rights because
[1:00:21] now these rights Turn The Impossible
[1:00:23] into possible these rights turn our
[1:00:26] sicknesses into
[1:00:28] Deliverance these rights give us the the
[1:00:31] the honors and the glories that go with
[1:00:33] the servant Jesus Christ these are our
[1:00:36] rights in our Promised Land he said but
[1:00:39] you're going to have to fight for
[1:00:41] it every inch of ground you're going to
[1:00:44] have to fight for
[1:00:46] it he said get over into Canaan once
[1:00:49] brother and you'll realize where you
[1:00:52] belong what what happens when we get
[1:00:54] into Canaan
[1:00:56] brother brandom said when you get over
[1:00:57] into Canaan he said ou'll realize right
[1:00:59] then you'll watch prayer start being
[1:01:01] turning things
[1:01:04] around do you see the power of canaan's
[1:01:07] land do you see the power of the promise
[1:01:09] of Jesus Christ do you see the power of
[1:01:12] the Holy Ghost in our lives he said when
[1:01:14] you get in there you can see things turn
[1:01:16] around and you can say look here Satan
[1:01:19] this is mine how many here tonight say
[1:01:22] Satan's got a hold to something of
[1:01:24] yours maybe it's a
[1:01:27] child huh maybe it's maybe it's one of
[1:01:30] the fruits of the spirit Satan's got a
[1:01:33] hold of it but he says now when you get
[1:01:35] into canaan's land you can say look at
[1:01:37] here Satan this is mine I'm the
[1:01:40] possessor of this God gave it to me God
[1:01:44] said so so move out and move off of my

[1:01:56] say he's going to say your
[1:01:59] grounds your
[1:02:01] grounds and then you're going to have to
[1:02:03] ask
[1:02:05] yourself do I know where I
[1:02:08] stand but the prophet said yes you look
[1:02:11] at him right then and you say yes sir my
[1:02:13] grounds I have an abstract deed to it

[1:03:22] over a property dispute that he can't
[1:03:25] win
[1:03:26] he said he's nothing more than a
[1:03:28] squatter he says because Christ became
[1:03:31] the kinsman redeemer and he redeemed all
[1:03:34] of this back to us yes he says but Satan
[1:03:38] wants to try to possess it but one of
[1:03:40] these days the fight will be over he

[1:04:26] to let take these words you got the

[1:06:25] children I claim my brother I claim my
[1:06:27] sister he says when Satan takes a
[1:06:30] brother and a sister out of
[1:06:33] church we should put our foot on
[1:06:36] them uh no we should hold him
[1:06:41] down no that isn't what he said he said
[1:06:44] but when they when Satan takes a brother
[1:06:46] out of the church and coaxes them to
[1:06:48] leave and go out there he said you say
[1:06:51] I'm coming after them I claim it
[1:06:58] we're heir of all
[1:07:01] things he said it's given to me I'm an
[1:07:03] heir I can claim everything that God has
[1:07:06] promised me he said it's mine he said
[1:07:10] how do you get it something something
[1:07:12] you've done no sir not something you've
[1:07:14] done it's unmerited gift God give us and
[1:07:17] it's ours it belongs to us now listen to
[1:07:20] this next statement Satan cannot hold it
[1:07:23] if you go to him in the super or the
[1:07:26] scriptural
[1:07:28] authoritive let me start that over
[1:07:30] that's a hard thing to say Satan cannot
[1:07:33] hold it if you go to him in the
[1:07:34] scriptural authoritative word with faith
[1:07:39] and say it's
[1:07:42] mine the
[1:07:45] sword the
[1:07:47] sword I said you as in listed
[1:07:50] soldiers it's time we get the sword
[1:07:53] sharp it's time we get the old Bible off
[1:07:55] the off the shelf and blow the dust off
[1:07:57] of it it's time that we start seeing the
[1:07:59] words of Deliverance in the Bible it's
[1:08:01] time we start seeing the what what uh
[1:08:04] promises that God has given
[1:08:06] us and we begin to attack Satan with the
[1:08:09] very word he tries to
[1:08:14] destroy Satan he says you take that
[1:08:17] authoritative word to him and say it's
[1:08:19] mine lay it
[1:08:22] down and I when I when I read that and
[1:08:25] it struck to me and I thought you ever
[1:08:27] seen a
[1:08:28] dog they pick up something they're not
[1:08:30] supposed to have and you say hey
[1:08:32] hey lay it
[1:08:38] down that dog will cow
[1:08:41] down and that's the way Satan is but
[1:08:44] we've got to have authority we've got to
[1:08:47] have a hold to his leash we take a hold
[1:08:50] of his choke collar and when he begins
[1:08:52] to put stuff on us we just yank that
[1:08:54] collar up a little bit grip it into his
[1:08:56] neck say now lay it down it's
[1:09:03] mine he said heavens and earth will pass
[1:09:06] away but this notice shall not we serve
[1:09:09] notice on Satan today we serve notice
[1:09:13] that every promise in this book is
[1:09:15] mine get off my property no trespassing
[1:09:20] don't come
[1:09:21] back I ain't calling a law if you're
[1:09:23] coming back I'm calling a higher
[1:09:29] authority he says yeah he says tell him
[1:09:34] tell him he says lay it down he says and
[1:09:37] that'll get him running how many wants
[1:09:40] to see Satan on the run I want to see
[1:09:42] Satan on the run then when he comes at
[1:09:44] me I just say get out of here move out
[1:09:47] of here and he runs and runs and runs
[1:09:50] why because he fears all that is before
[1:09:52] us
[1:09:57] brother Brown said yes you got that
[1:09:59] scriptural Authority because you're a
[1:10:02] Believer you get it that's what he says
[1:10:06] you're a Believer and you get
[1:10:11] it he's talking about Switzerland here
[1:10:14] and we're going to try to finish up here
[1:10:16] with this thought he's talking about
[1:10:18] over there in Switzerland he said there
[1:10:20] was a a land of Peace there was a
[1:10:22] peaceful people but back in 138 6 1386
[1:10:27] there was an invading Army that come
[1:10:29] down into Switzerland they began to
[1:10:31] trample down all of Switzerland they
[1:10:33] were leaving everything in chaos they
[1:10:35] were burning the homes killing the
[1:10:36] children ravishing the wives killing off
[1:10:38] the young driving away their their stock
[1:10:40] and all their livelihood burning up
[1:10:42] their Farms they couldn't eat the
[1:10:46] Invaders come in and they were moving in
[1:10:49] you know that's what Satan is is an
[1:10:51] Invader he wants to take every one of
[1:10:53] the things that I just described
[1:10:56] and he was invading and here this Army
[1:10:59] was invading into Switzerland and he
[1:11:00] said they they rolled rocks up down him
[1:11:03] but there was nothing that could stop
[1:11:05] them and he said there was this little
[1:11:07] Swiss Army that had been backed up into
[1:11:09] the corner of the Plains and he said
[1:11:11] they were at the end of their Road and
[1:11:13] they knew nothing could be
[1:11:15] done nothing could be done he said and
[1:11:18] that great Army coming at them with
[1:11:20] their Spears in front of them their
[1:11:21] Pikes can you imagine looking facing
[1:11:24] that Army uh just row after row of 8ot
[1:11:27] tall Spears with big spear head the
[1:11:29] Pikes that they were coming at them with
[1:11:31] and backing them into a corner and he
[1:11:33] said there was that Swiss Army that was
[1:11:35] trying to fight with every anything they
[1:11:37] could
[1:11:40] find farm implements rocks hammers
[1:11:46] rakes and here they stood backed into
[1:11:48] the corner he said they were hopeless
[1:11:50] and
[1:11:52] helpless and everything that they had
[1:11:54] tried it failed how many's ever been
[1:11:57] there before where you felt hopeless you
[1:12:00] felt you felt helpless and hopeless and
[1:12:02] everything that you tried you've tried
[1:12:03] this way and that way and you've done it

[1:12:27] was full of ruins it was a chaos I
[1:12:29] didn't know where I was going or coming
[1:12:31] and here this little army there here
[1:12:33] their wives were going he said their
[1:12:35] children were going the nation was going
[1:12:37] everything gone and nothing could stop
[1:12:38] them and they're backed into this little
[1:12:41] place and here they are standing there
[1:12:44] and Arnold Von Winkle Reed stepped
[1:12:48] up he said Arnold Von Winkle Reed
[1:12:51] stepped up and he said men of
[1:12:53] Switzerland this day I'll give my life
[1:12:56] for
[1:12:57] Switzerland what was he doing right
[1:13:00] there what was he doing he was serving
[1:13:02] notice to the enemy he was serving
[1:13:06] notice that today I don't care what
[1:13:08] happens I don't care if it cost me my
[1:13:11] life I don't care what it is this day
[1:13:14] I'll give everything that I have for
[1:13:18] Switzerland and the prophet said they've
[1:13:20] tried everything it's
[1:13:23] failed well let me tell you
[1:13:27] I can try to do things in
[1:13:29] myself and it'll fail you can try to do
[1:13:33] things in yourself you're going to fail
[1:13:35] you can throw money at your
[1:13:38] problems you can't buy
[1:13:41] them you can throw hundreds and hundreds
[1:13:43] and hundreds of dollars at your problems
[1:13:45] it's not going to fix
[1:13:49] it and you can just go and you can you
[1:13:51] can just keep going and going and going
[1:13:54] and it's just going to keep
[1:13:56] failing but here this young man this
[1:13:58] Arnold Von Winkle right he said he tried
[1:14:01] everything and they said what are you
[1:14:03] going to
[1:14:04] do he says I'm just just follow me and
[1:14:08] fight as the best you have in you to
[1:14:11] fight and he said he went out through
[1:14:13] there and he said he threw down
[1:14:14] everything that was in his hand he
[1:14:15] raised up his arms and he said Make Way
[1:14:19] for victory Make Way for Liberty and as
[1:14:23] he stormed into there the prophet said
[1:14:25] and the in history will tell us that he
[1:14:27] found the heaviest concentration of
[1:14:29] those Spears and he runs and he grabs a
[1:14:32] hold of all those Spears and pull pull
[1:14:35] them all into his
[1:14:36] bosom and fell upon those Spears and
[1:14:40] died but what did it
[1:14:43] do it made a way for his people it made
[1:14:49] a way for the people of Switzerland when
[1:14:51] he pulled those Spears into his into his
[1:14:54] bosom and he fell upon on them the the
[1:14:56] line
[1:14:58] collapsed and then all of his fellow
[1:15:00] soldiers said let's go he made way for
[1:15:03] Liberty he made way for Freedom he made
[1:15:06] a way for us to go forward he made a way
[1:15:09] for us to get our homes back he made a
[1:15:11] way for our families to come back he
[1:15:13] made a way for us to
[1:15:15] eat and so they break through the lines
[1:15:17] and they take over they take it
[1:15:20] over and you know I looked this up and I
[1:15:22] was studying this out and as I looked it
[1:15:24] up you know I looked and and and
[1:15:25] Wikipedia says it gives some some small
[1:15:28] facts it says and it says cause of death
[1:15:34] suicide I thought no they got that wrong
[1:15:37] cause of death
[1:15:41] sacrifice
[1:15:42] sacrifice and I thought my
[1:15:45] goodness the prophet when he brought
[1:15:47] that out and he's no wonder they said it
[1:15:49] was suicide I say it's sacrifice he said
[1:15:52] when Adam's race was backed into the
[1:15:54] corner
[1:15:56] that's us when we were backed into a
[1:15:59] corner and there was no way out there
[1:16:01] was no hope all was lost there was
[1:16:04] nothing you could do you were helpless
[1:16:06] your children were
[1:16:08] Sinners your family was falling
[1:16:11] apart he says but right back there he
[1:16:14] says one day in glory the most precious
[1:16:16] thing of Heaven stepped out before the
[1:16:17] angels of God and said this day I'll
[1:16:21] give my life for the sons of Adam
[1:16:25] he says this day I'll do something
[1:16:27] that'll break the ranks of my
[1:16:33] enemy what was God doing he was making a
[1:16:37] way he he breached the Gap he tore a
[1:16:41] hole in the enemy's line to where he
[1:16:43] says come on come on Saints come on
[1:16:46] don't step Don't step behind don't stay
[1:16:48] behind let's March through this Gap and
[1:16:50] let's take back what I've given you
[1:17:01] let's stand to our
[1:17:03] feet I was
[1:17:05] thinking I've had shamgar on my mind all
[1:17:08] week and as some musicians make their
[1:17:10] way and Prophet said there was a little
[1:17:13] old
[1:17:14] shamgar and he said there was shamgar
[1:17:16] there and no he he looked around he
[1:17:18] couldn't find nothing but his righteous
[1:17:20] indignation got up he said he couldn't
[1:17:23] find nothing he wasn't a war War but
[1:17:26] what he had in his hand was a ox
[1:17:29] go and he said those 600
[1:17:33] Philistines those 600 Philistines come
[1:17:36] at him and they stood right there and it
[1:17:38] said he be to beat their heads
[1:17:43] in he didn't lay down and say take it
[1:17:46] again Satan it's yours no but he said he
[1:17:50] took that as his righteous ignation got
[1:17:52] up and he wanted what was rightfully his
[1:17:54] this This Is My Land This is my food
[1:17:56] this is my home these are my people this
[1:17:59] is my church these are my
[1:18:02] kids and he said he began to beat their
[1:18:05] heads
[1:18:06] in and I love it when brother Ron
[1:18:08] preaches it he said dumb devil he said
