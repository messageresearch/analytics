bow out and climb my tree so praise the lord god is good all right so greetings everyone god bless you richly it's just good to be in the house of lord good to be a christian amen and so we just want to share a little thought the lord i feel like he opened something up for me this afternoon and i trust it'll be a blessing to you amen i think everybody's doing pretty good let's just bow our heads amen and if anybody has any special rare prayer requests you just want to lift up before the lord you have a need amen say lord help me in this whatever it might be father we come before you tonight lord our hands are raised to you lord lord and we just desire god that you look upon our needs lord each heart father you know just what it is and we pray god that you'll just meet that need lord jesus in a special way may they know that there's a god that's the same yesterday today and forever and that you hear the prayers of your children lord father we just commit this service to you now i ask him for your leadership your guidance father and your blessing upon the reading of the word in jesus name amen and amen let's turn our bibles if you will to the uh let's go all the way back to psalms if you will go back to this book of psalms and we want to speak tonight on strength strength amen i mean i was pondering that thought about strength and it uh come into my mind the lord began to deal me with that thought of what brother bram said about a man that had been like devil possessed or whatever he becomes many times his normal strength amen somebody that's demon possessed and he says how much more the holy spirit should give us strength isn't that right and make us strong amen and so i wanted to read something david said here about strength in psalms the 1 psalms 18 not 118 but psalms 18 amen and we'll read run one through seven i will love thee oh lord my strength the lord is my rock and my fortress he is my deliverer my god there he says it again my strength in whom i will trust my buckler the horn of my salvation and my high tower i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from all my from my enemies the sorrows of death come past me the floods of ungodly made me afraid the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress i called upon the lord and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry became before him even into his ears then the earth shook and trembled the mountains also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was wroth amen may god and his blessings to the reading of the words you can be seated amen so david begins to describe here amen um about the sorrows of death compassing him in verse 4 and also the sorrows of hell compassing me about and the snares of death preventing him so how many knows david had gotten into some real dangerous situations he had gotten into very sorrowful places and he should we say he got into some real bad places in his life but he knew what it was like to call upon the lord amen and call for strength he was without strength amen so tonight we want to talk about amen perhaps even some of the statements that we would might make some time about oh well i'm tough i can handle it you know or you can handle it you're tough you know tough tough people and so forth isn't that right and but i want to first of all look at it you know talking about strength you know another place the bible talks about and i'm not going to get into it very much but i want to just mention it about abraham amen brother bab talked they were well stricken in age they were old folks isn't that like they were beginning to get old 65 years old they were losing their strength how many knows as you get older you lose your strength amen you get you know you were you're not near as strong as what you used to be abraham and sarah were of course weak and then of course after they got the promise of having children and so forth you know they even got weaker and weaker all the way to 95 years old and sarah 75 years old so they got really old and they got really weak and they got really you know where they needed strength but you know uh as the prophet put it he says you know he came and he presented himself to abraham as el shaddai amen which was a man interpreted being depressed at god am i right and he told him to just you know nurse so to speak on el shaddai amen amen because you know that he was going to draw his strength from god amen and so as we get older you different ones of us get older i don't care if you're old if you're young or what you are amen your true strength comes from the lord tonight before i really get to the core of my subject i want to talk about three different areas of strength amen areas of strength and that is you know the strength of the body the strength of the spirit and the strength of the soul because we're a triune being amen and i know that anybody that's lived very long knows that you know just physical strength or just body strength isn't really all that much strength the bible one place it says body bodily exercises profit is little another place i believe it says it profit is nothing is that right so it just doesn't do a whole lot for uh your physical body and the physical strength that you have and so i was thinking about this physical body and how much strength it really has how strong it really is and so uh i i googled it i i talked to siri about it and she told me how how strong a man what the strongest man was and how much weight that he has lifted amen and so um with anybody like the guests in the class tonight about the most weight that a man human being is lifted seven hundred and eleven of eleven and 1104. eddie the eddie the beast hall over in england i guess it was 1104 somewhere in their pounds i've got a picture and it says also that later he picked up 1180 some pounds with the the barbell going across at 18 inches with a little bit higher barbell i mean he got uh 1180 some pounds up which is quite a bit you know and so he that's pretty strong that's pretty a lot of weight isn't that right i mean but it did say that that when he was when he did it that he would bled out of his ears he bled out of his eyes but out of his nose you know every part of his head was bleeding and he about passed out you know but that's what it said but anyway so i guess he was really really you know and that is a lot of weight truly is but you know you think about that but you know that's just the physical just this the body power that's not a whole lot when you go into the spirit realm how many knows that truly are strength now your spirit can make your physical body many times more distract than it's used to all right and so that's in the spirit realm amen for for example let's just read a story with me if you will go to mark 5 amen and we'll read a script story and we'll go right into the spirit part of uh strength talking about in the spirit realm there's much more strength now uh we know that just uh you know cain let me just maybe maybe pick this up just a little bit here talking about cain how many knows that you know he was actually a churchgoer amen one place he was called a believer and that right king was you know and he was a church goer and he worshipped god but you know he found out what the strength of his spirit will do and what it'll make a man do amen he found out what evil spirits do amen such as jealousy and that right he found out that jealousy or even envy led to jealousy about the same thing and then that led to hatred and that right and that hatred gave him so much strength amen until he actually killed his brother it's an evil strength it's an overwhelming strength it's a power it's an evil power isn't that right amen all these things you talk about cain and and what he would do because of uh the spirit that was on him the spirit that got on him amen and the things that he me it caused him to do but over in mark the fifth chapter we want to go and take a little journey through a graveyard tonight if you would with me amen and they came over unto the other side of the sea and the country of the dorians and when he was come out of the ship immediately that met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit who had his dwellings among the tombs amen he my home was in the graveyard he slept with dead people didn't bother him not did it and no man could bind him no not with chains huh i'd like to see eddie uh the the the beast try to tear a chain in half right because it can hold more than 1100 pounds can't it that's right but this guy could rip chains that right because he had been bound often it says often been bound with feathers and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken into pieces talk about a superman talk about a strong person he had a lot of strength didn't he that spirit he may have been as grounded a little bit i'm sure he didn't look nothing like eddie because if you see eddie he looks like a monster all right he's huge you know i wouldn't want him follow me let alone do anything else anyway but listen this guy here was in feathers but he was probably didn't look like too much he probably didn't eat too much but yet he was super strong and they couldn't keep him in jail they couldn't catch the guy it was terrible right and no man and neither could any man tame him and always night and day he was among he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones and when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshiped him and cried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god that thou torment me not and he said because listen i believe one place brother bam said that these devils recognize who jesus was and they didn't want to go to torment yet so they said don't torment me yet because they know they got torment coming that right and he said unto him come out of the man thou and clean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is legion for we are many let me know jesus god didn't just have one devil he had a lot of devils he had a lot of evil spirits in him ma let me tell you something that's what the world is full of it how many knows most of the people that you meet out there they don't got just one evil spirit they're full of evil spirits and they can have many spirits many evil spirits on them at the same time and he besought him much that he would not send them out of the country now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding and all the devils beside him saying sent us into the swine all right that we may enter into them and forthwith jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea and there were about two thousand and they were choked in the sea and they were choked in the sweet and we we know what the rest of the story is how the different ones ask him to leave the area because they didn't want him to mess up their business it was bad for their swine business isn't that right and then rather than accepting a man that could cast out devils and bring eternal life they'd rather have hogs and it's sad to think that people rather have hogs than jesus you know that's quite something because you know the miracle of that man and being delivered and what god had done for him said hey you know come and preach us a sermon come and have a revival in our church but don't say they said leave we don't want you around here isn't that something how human beings can be so closed-minded and so amen until they you know it's right there in front of them the power of god's in front of them and they still don't even want it amen so my my my when you look at that it's like wow amen another place just another good good on a couple of good sides somebody knows that sham guard just being a regular guy he wasn't much he was just a farmer but when the spirit of god came upon him his righteous indignation come up in him isn't that right amen and i really really this has to do with part part of the soul too i want to talk about the soul and its strength but you know it was very special when the spirit of god come upon him come upon david come upon samson how did samson would kill a thousand philistines but six hundred ain't that much different so we talk about samson a lot but samgar if the spirit of god came on him because him he knows it's not limit to a person it's only limited to the spirit of god but whether the spirit of god came on you it don't matter necessarily the numbers and nobody's going to defeat you and that spirit came upon them and then because he'd made him so strong amen that we all know that you couldn't kill a thousand you would wear out before you killed a thousand and then i don't know how long you would be at battle with one or two or three at the same time but it would be a chore it'd be a real choice and it takes supernatural power to give you the kind of strength that you would need to do that much killing both for sham god or for that and that's why i think a lot of times the bible talked about he was afterwards very tired amen and had to go and rest for a couple days you know but you think about that how how in the spirit realm how much stronger that a person can be amen in the spirit realm both with the holy ghost and also the the privacy and the ugliness and the horribleness because people don't have even common decency amen that just a normal human being would have amen when evil spirits come upon they do things like hitler did very evil spiritual they'll go into schools and shoot little kids what kind of a wicked spirit would do something like that to go to a third grader or fourth grader just little kids and shoot them that's a wicked spirit amen but how many knows it's the devil's power it's the devil's strength that drives them to do things like that that's why the tribulation period folks all of these video games and all of these things it's all getting them ready desensitizing them getting them ready for the bloodiest time the world has ever known amen we're right on the brink of it amen but that's the evil spirits that we do amen david amen he knew that he didn't have the power how many knows david knew he didn't have the power but he had a god and he believed and trusted in the strength of jehovah to deliver him amen that's what we truly need more of now i don't know about you let me just ask you this question tonight how many really needs more strength i really need more strength well i'm gonna tell you tonight how you're gonna get that strength how it's gonna come and you're not gonna like it uh well y'all like it well just wait a minute then we'll see i hope you do but amen it doesn't always come in the way that you think it might come all right but let's talk about the soul for a minute now truly if you look at this and you look at the spirit realm of things and and so forth and the power that it has but i believe tonight that the soul amen the soul has even more strength the soul the power that lays in the soul it even has even more strength wow how's that brother balor well it has to do with true love that goes down on the inside of the inside because we all know that peer people people will do things that go so far with certain things in the spirit realm but then they'll drop off but they're things that people will do that is just out of the human comprehension and in this realm you find that people that have a real sort of have a soul so to speak they still got a soul down there hey man unless we've heard many stories of heroic acts even in war many times they'll get the medal of honor because their buddy amen perhaps in the army and the war somewhere is out there he's wounded he's on the road and he can't go anymore but they're still shooting at him and they're to your brother and perhaps it's your brother out there and man you're just in your soul huh it's your the chorus that is my brother isn't that right and you'll run out through bullets and everything else and go great it would normally be you wouldn't do that people don't go out there don't even think about doing that but you'll do it because down in your soul you have the love of god in your heart or you love your brother is that right that love power of love in the soul that real power it'll make a mother running into a house that the flame that the fire department meant won't even run into it anymore no no you don't go in there you're gonna die she don't care if she's gonna die and so that is her baby and that right and she will run through those flames just to try to save that little baby we know the story of that isn't that right that's kind of power comes from the soul amen the power of the soul is when you love god and you realize that down in the soul there's a gene how many knows there's a gene and if you are a seed of god that's going to come up it doesn't matter how much concrete there is it don't matter how much it's going to find its way out the sunlight it's very powerful you know right it'll crack the sidewalks if it has to amen and it'll make it'll make you run through a fire and if you have true real genuine relationship and love for jesus christ paul said there's not tribulation distress no nothing that's ever going to separate you from that people that just have the spirit on on their flesh and in their flesh realm and so forth and also in their spirit realm you know when the tribulation comes from the hard times come the bible says by and by they're offended and off they go but not somebody that's genuinely born again when that seed is all the way down on the inside there is nothing that can separate you from the love of god you will gladly walk into an arena knowing that you will be ripped apart by lions because you love your god so much you can't you can't you can't stop that you can't stop the church of the living god you can't slap somebody that's absolutely in love with almighty god hello listen to this if you just listen to your flesh how many knows if you just have your just have to flesh to deal with your empty you really don't have any spirit man it ain't going to take nothing for the devil to talk you out of coming to church or praying in the morning or reading your bible no it don't take no any kind of flimsy excuse he's going to do but if you've got the spirit amen i'll tell you what you love to get on your knees and have fellowship with god and say god here i am how are you doing today i love you lord it's not hard to pray when you've got the holy ghost it's not hard to read your bible it's not hard to say praise the lord it's not hard to worship god why because it gives you strength to do it but it's got to be down in here amen so you see where i'm coming from tonight that down in your soul when that love of god is done in your soul paul said self tribulation cell distress shall death not even death can separate us from the love of god people would gladly be burnt at the stake burned alive at the stake i mean they would do it just to try to get them to renounce their religion but why it was so powerful down in inside they'd rather be burnt alive than to give up this fellowship that he had with god i mean believes that truly our greatest thing tonight is the fellowship that we have with jesus christ nothing can separate it's a real power the most powerful thing there is when you become relation to almighty god there's nothing going to stop you so i got to thinking about this and i got to pray and i said lord strength i talk about strength and so forth the body of fear and then i begin to think isn't the lord brought that message to my mind about where where where brother brandon preached about strength how many knows he preached about strength that's his strength the joy of the lord i thought well the joy of the lord is my strength that's one good thing they that wait upon the lord that right shall renew their strength man these dear scriptures talk about strength and how to get strength and so forth but the prophet of god brought it in a beautiful way so turn with me another scripture and we want to look at the aspect of how to receive strength how to get strength how to be stronger a stronger christian paul said finally my brethren be strong in the lord isn't that right and in the power of his mind okay so in second corinthians the 12th chapter second corinthians 12. amen brother bam makes a statement he says you know we always want to tell how big we are and how great we are how tough we are ah we're tough people think they're tough amen let's build on that for just a minute paul how many knows paul was a pharisee of the he he said let me give you a few minutes here you know not to boast but if anybody's got the right to boast i got to write the most i was a pharisee of the pharisees i was this side of the other circumcised on the earth of the sock of israel and he went on and on and on and on but what did he say eventually he says you know all those things that count but dung for the excellency of the knowledge of jesus christ he was very zealous for the lord he was very tough very strong but he found out that the lord had to take all of that toughness away from him he had to knock him down amen you realize god has to knock us down have you ever heard the phrase you know sometimes they'd have a fight you know and they'd fight each other and and one guy would knock him down and if he'd stay down the fight was over but if he got back up fight wasn't over right stay down stay down don't get up right i believe that's what god tells us stay down and don't get up but listen so paul here was talking about his problem that he had he had an issue either with his eyes or something and he kept bothering him in verse 7 of chapter 12 second corinthians 12 beginning with verse 7. at least i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations that was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me wow at least i should be exalted above measure for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me amen don't we pray for problems to leave us sometimes just take care of this problem and i don't want to have this problem anymore huh he saw him thrice and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in your weakness amen most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then am i strong amen but we could rephrase that when i am weak then he is strong amen so brother brahms goes to saying listen we want to tell how big well he was talking about pentecost how many knows he was talking about pentecost and and when he was preaching on perfect strength by perfect weakness everybody always want to tell how great they are and so forth and that's why god gave me this text he says to get that out of our mind see we come together amen he says if we don't come together to find our bad places then we don't come for the right reason we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places to see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's strong amen praise the lord listen again if we ever get to a spot that we think that we can do it in our own intelligence by our own abilities and we've got to master that in such a way and get rid of that thing and lay it aside so that god can use us that's right let's talk about a few minutes about how that jesus christ god is amen he's a potter isn't that right amen and we are the clay he molds us and brother babe says sometimes god has to take that part because the day ain't high likely and he has to thoroughly break that pot down so that he can remold it we're all so tight with gold how many knows that we're also tight with gold beaten gold beaten go where god beats us down he coming up paul thought that he was a great guy he thought he was on top of the world and got the head that god had to punch him he had to knock him off of his high heart down onto damascus road and make him realize that everything that he thought he was doing right in his zealousness for god was all absolutely wrong the very god that he thought he was working for he was persecuting in that right after that he had to realize that he was absolutely only going about it the wrong way and god just struck him down on the road to damascus he took him off of his high horse as the brother ma'am said amen and that my friend brother this is the core of the strength of receiving our strength is when god knocks us down getting to a place to where you realize you're not so tough you can't handle that situation do you realize that's exactly what god tried to do with israel and that just like he did with all god three times different times god tried to knock israel down and then right three times one time it was because you know he he took him to a place where there was no direction to go no way and we as human beings we like to make our own way we always want a way out we always this is oh my we always try to fix it so to speak and have our thing in it and israel they come to the red sea and they thought boy this can't be right you know we're not supposed to just come up against the red sea we're not consequenced to come to a place where we don't know what to do next but that was god was telling them look you've got to die to your own way i'm leading you here sometimes we don't know which way to go sometimes we don't know the next move and god brings us to that place to show us hey you know you got to realize that it's not about you making the way you've got to realize i'm making your way and he brought him down to that broken place the place of breaking them is that right but how many knows they would not be broken instead they murmured and complained against god amen let's look here now that's now listen so he says we've got to get rid of that thing such a way and lay it aside that god can use us so he can use us and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender and come to god you've got to surrender to him both soul body and spirit i believes you've got to be completely certain if you really want the power of god your real strength is when you're completely surrendered to god that's what god was trying to do with israel trying to get him to completely surrender when he knocked saul down onto the road damascus he meant he made him realize that hey you're completely wrong sit back and let me guide you let me lead you huh just surrender completely to me everything you got everything that you are has to be surrendered to god in order for god to work his will in you and in me now that's hard i know because we're always wanting to put our part in something that we know now isn't that exactly what it was every time you know because he he tested them on in a way that the god will make a way they want to make their own way and then the other thing that god tried to break him on was that you know it's not about you supplying for yourself amen because god let him get hungry and he also let him get thirsty isn't that right amen and so he he wanted them to come to a place of surrender to god saying lord i know that you've led us this far i know you'll provide food sure my stomach's hungry i'm growled amen but i know that you'll make a way but instead it would not be broken huh lord if it's your will to die for me to starve to death and here i am lord huh god would have been happy with that here look at them they're not complaining they're completely surrendered to me here let me bring some manna down let me rain down some quail huh god have been smiling that's what i'm looking for how many knows god brought him all to these places because he was looking for a product he was trying to mold him he was shaping them i believe you know i believe that's what god does with you and me every day he is in the remoting business in the reshaping business amen austin he's got to completely crush that car it's a piece of junk crush the thing send it back into the hot kettle and what a little do it'll become lava it'll just become a a hot liquid and then whatever they make out of it it can be remolded that's what we got to be it may completely broken down and reshaped isn't that right that's what god was trying to do with israel he was dealing with paul and every person that comes to god has to come to that molding place that place to where you don't supply for yourself you don't worry about your own way you ask god for his direction he brings us that place of being broken down amen he gives us it's really good but we always want in our part we want listen to this i hope everybody at least for myself and i believe a lot of us i know a lot of people that have gotten in major trouble major trouble because amen they've tried to do things in their own ability when you try to make things happen hello you're going to make it happen you remember god ain't in it god ain't in it one bit he can't use any of our own abilities it has to be god doing it amen and as long as you do it in your own ability do things by your own ability remember you will bitterly fail only when you completely surrender to god and then watch god do it and then it'll be perfect but so many times we get carnal we let that self we let that self come in isn't that right but the man says that's your most dangerous that's their biggest enemy is that self it's what paul said about the black dog he says when i we would do it's that other guy that's right there beside you all right it's that it's at the high horse that dog that brother man talk about that black dog that wants to raise up and he always wants to have his input on it he tries to come he's always there to try to every day he'll if you're completely surrendered that dog will try to raise up tomorrow morning he'll try to come but he'll try to revive how why do you think brother brown says you know amen get off your eyes or horses like paul amen and stay on the mus damascus road and then what did he say and stay there that's right and stay there don't get up hallelujah help thomas don't get up stay down there stay surrendered cause the old guy he'll want to raise up he'll try to get up but let me tell you some only the holy spirit will help you to stay down and watch the perfect strength of god be manifested the perfect strength of god because god said to paul my strength is made perfect when you're completely incapable when you're at the place you can't you're not such a tough guy anymore my strength is made perfect in your weakness amen in the same way with israel red sea his strength would have been made perfect in weakness his strength was still made perfect wasn't it beautiful wasn't it glorious it was glorious we still talk about it forever talk about the seas party and them walking over across that was god's strength i'd like to try i'd like to see them try to part that and try it out but we need a lot of fans a lot of times in the whole couple of years isn't that right no god just did it in an instant same way with the birds same way with water from a rock his strength is perfect i can make water coming out of a dry rock what about it where do you get water from a rock no maybe a spring maybe some dirt bubbling up in water no but a rock a dry rock and a desert gotta do the miraculous how many weeks you'll do that in your life in my life if you'll be surrendered to god amen but no like brother bam says he listened to what brother brahm said he said you know i know that's hard it's hard to not let the flesh have its way amen in those times like god said to paul my strength is made perfect in weakness my strength becomes more perfect as you become more weaker and the more you can yield to me the better i can use you the more you forget about all that you know education the more you forget about your denomination the more you can get forget about your stuff and i blue line the stuff hello let me know sometimes we still got stuff and yield yourself to me the more i can use you because you have to become weak amen and then i'll make my own purpose strong so god can make strength out of weakness that's why that's the reason that he always does it and he always chooses weak people amen but don't use that as an excuse amen so i thought about this in closing i thought about it's kind of like this because most of us we've been being shaped by the lord how many has been led by the lord god's working a lot of us for a long time already but you know it's wonderful if you take a car and you fix this and you fix that perhaps it's in a wreck it's in bad shape you fix this you fix that but if you drive it down the road and let's say the right side of your car in the front wheel amen the steering rod that goes over there to the left it still has a real bad bend in it isn't that right and it causes that wheel to squall and squeak and make one or you run off the road and you got to fight that thing i want you to run off the road right guess what it's time to take it back to the body shop right to cake it up and take that rod off and then perhaps heat it up and bend it straight again put it a little under pressure get it a little fire on it and fix that thing and i mean that's what god is doing to your life and to my life those little areas and anybody that raised their hands i need more strength let me tell you there's still an area in your life still an area in my life where god is trying to get the whole machine oh my don't you like a new vehicle it don't have a pulling problem how many likes a car with a pulling problem i don't like a car with a pulling problem you know something's wrong they find their name in the line right something you know is it funny to watch some of these people you know i would do it if that's all i had brother steven i'd go down there i'd drive an old chevy truck with the back end and going that way you know you know it's just something y'all i'm seeing right you know they're going down like that it's just a back end it's a guy it's been in the wreck it's in bad shape that's where you and i are sometimes you might be a truck you might be a christian you might be going down the road but he sits straight the way it's supposed to be amen amen so god's still working on us isn't that right as we sing that song many times god's working on a steel amen so god's going to take that one little thing in our life amen that's still not quite right and he still has to take that in his shop so to speak and fix it and i don't know about you but i've got that area say lord you know you know where i need fixing amen praise the lord you think you're so tough but guess what amen god has to do like he did with paul he has to do like he did with david and all these different places you know so that you can really realize that hey it's not me it's all about him you realize that without him we can do nothing how many is that way lord jesus without you i can do nothing when i was in cancer i was people perhaps you know i was just gonna die and god came down and he delivered me amen i was backed up against death got in the corner but the lord delivered me praise be to god you know i mean you give god the glory you realize you can sing that song with all of your heart amen his hand reached further down then i could reach up amen that's what he wanted israel to say that's what he wanted all of them to realize hey you know he could reach further down than what you can reach up but you just got to surrender yourself and say thank you lord you know you have to break me you have to break my selfishness my spirit amen to where i can just yield to you and give god all the glory god bless you tonight amen you can stand with me if you will musicians if you'll come amen let's just power heads while they're coming let's talk to the master the one that does these things the ones that kind of breaks us down in different places has to remoles a certain area isn't quite right so he has to work on that because he's getting a bride ready to leave this world he's getting a bride that has the strength of god in her and that strength only comes when you are weak to yourself and completely yielded to him and given him the glory let him lead your life every aspect of it he's got control of every aspect then we'll truly become strong is when we're weak in ourself lord jesus we come before you tonight we just ask god that you continue lord to mold us and shape us into your image lord and while we all raise our hands saying yes we want more strength we want more strength of the lord but lord if you bring us to that place where you have to break us down lock us down some few places praise break that place where we're still not yielded like we should be then lord help us to realize that's just god working on us and getting us to yield so that we can see more of the strength of god in our life and lord jesus i just pray god that you'll just take these words tonight lord and place it in each heart and cause it to draw us closer to you lord jesus and make us realize where our bad places are our father where we can become stronger where we can better serve you lord and i thank you father that we truly can be strength strong when we think about paul lord jesus how how did he was didn't look like anything according to the picture he didn't have big arms and strong no he was really puny looking but he was a spiritual giant he was strong in the lord leaning on you for everything he gladly laid his head on the chopping block so that he could come home to be with you he was brave he was so strong because he had you in his soul that's what we want we want the holy spirit the love of god in our soul that'll truly make us strong father we ask god your blessing upon each one now in jesus name amen and amen david sing that little course the more that i surrender all the more that i surrender the lighter my lord the more that i release my cares the more he takes control the more that i can humble myself the more he lifts me up oh every day i live lord i love you more once again
