[19:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many's looking
[19:38] forward to a good day in the Lord? How
[19:41] many's come to worship the Lord? Amen.
[19:44] That's what we come to do, to worship
[19:46] him in spirit and in truth. God bless
[19:49] you this morning. Good morning.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. It is a good
[19:54] morning. Amen. Amen. We just want to
[19:56] open up service in prayer. I'm sure
[19:58] brother Amen. Joshua probably has some
[20:00] prayer requests, but let's just open up
[20:02] in prayer this morning. Dear heavenly
[20:04] father, as we come before you, Lord,
[20:07] gathering ourselves together for one
[20:09] purpose, Lord Jesus,
[20:11] like it was in the days of Job when the
[20:14] sons of God gathered themselves together
[20:16] to present themselves before the Lord.
[20:19] Lord, and we know that you see us, you
[20:21] see every good thing about us. You see
[20:24] every bad thing about us, Lord. So here
[20:26] we stand, Father, with open hearts and
[20:28] open minds, Lord, asking God that you'll
[20:31] search our hearts, see if there be any
[20:34] wicked way in us, Lord. And as you said
[20:36] in your prayer, deliver us from all
[20:39] evil, Father. And that's what we would
[20:42] desire this morning, God, that you'll
[20:43] help us to be better Christians when we
[20:46] leave today, Lord. And we ask God that
[20:48] you would just come Lord Jesus and by
[20:51] your Holy Spirit speak through the
[20:53] minister brother Chris Kathy this
[20:55] morning speak through him Lord Jesus.
[20:58] Use his lips father. Use his mind. Use
[21:01] his heart father. Use his spirit God
[21:04] Lord Jesus to minister to your people
[21:06] what we have need of today Lord. For we
[21:09] know that you're the same yesterday,
[21:11] today and forever. And Lord, you still
[21:13] can cause our hearts to burn along the
[21:16] way as you speak with us. Father, you
[21:19] know the needs, Father, this morning.
[21:20] And we commit this day, this morning's
[21:22] service, we commit our fellowship,
[21:25] dinner, our fellowship one with another.
[21:28] And then the evening service at 2:30.
[21:30] Again, we commit to you asking God that
[21:32] your divine will would be done. For we
[21:34] ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen.
[21:38] You can be seated for a minute. I just
[21:39] want to talk to you for a couple of
[21:40] minutes before we start the worship
[21:42] service. Amen. First of all, I just want
[21:45] to Amen. Thank brother John. Amen. And
[21:49] Sister Alicia for all they've done out
[21:51] here with the with our property. Amen.
[21:53] With the bulldozer and stuff that he's
[21:55] done. Tens of thousands probably. I
[21:57] mean, it would a lot lot of lot of work
[22:00] he did. Amen. And we really really
[22:02] appreciate it. We're getting close to
[22:04] getting the pad ready back here or uh
[22:06] just graded. What we're doing it is
[22:08] we're just getting to get it ready so
[22:09] that whenever a year, two years,
[22:11] whatever, whatever time frame God has
[22:13] for us, if we see y'all decide to have a
[22:16] building there, we will. Amen. But I
[22:19] felt led just to go ahead and get that
[22:20] foundation and all done. And so that has
[22:23] went well. And I think right now, uh,
[22:25] Brother John, of course, he, uh, took
[22:27] all the logs off of it and we got like
[22:29] $3,200, Amen. for the logs. Amen. And we
[22:33] appreciate that. And so, uh, I think the
[22:36] bill for about 40. I thought when I
[22:39] first started doing it, I I told him,
[22:41] "Well, we're going to need about 10
[22:42] loads of rock in here."
[22:46] Oh, my brother Joe come along. He said,
[22:48] "No, you're going to need a hundred.
[22:49] What are you talking about?" So, we were
[22:51] hoping to meet somewhere in the middle,
[22:53] you know, but Amen. So, I don't know. I
[22:55] think it's around 41. Brad said 49. 47.
[22:58] 47 loads that we've hauled so far. But,
[23:01] Amen. We appreciate Brother Joe. Amen.
[23:04] We was going to have to pay $275
[23:07] a load. Amen. Brother Joe did a little
[23:09] of his business and got us uh got it up
[23:14] here at the rock quarry just about a
[23:16] mile up here. Ain't that right? Y'all
[23:17] see that big old pile, right? Amen. Got
[23:19] it for $175 a load. So that's, you know,
[23:22] it'll probably be at least the 6,000 at
[23:24] least $6,000 he saved by making a phone
[23:27] call. So that's the kind of guy he is
[23:29] though, is he? He's a businessman.
[23:30] whatever he touches it turns into pure
[23:33] gold.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we appreciate him. Amen. And of
[23:38] course, brother Brad also with what he's
[23:40] done. He's not here this morning with
[23:41] the work that he's done and so forth,
[23:43] but Amen. So any we do have uh eight
[23:47] $8,600 bill, I think, that we're going
[23:48] to try to pay tomorrow.
[23:51] Um and so but we did get 3,200 off of
[23:55] there. So, I think it's around I don't
[23:57] know, my math may be off, but it's
[23:59] somewhere around $5,500 that we have to
[24:02] come up with, but that's not just too
[24:03] bad, but we do need about He said,
[24:06] Brother John says about 20 more loads to
[24:08] get it right up to grade where we want
[24:09] it. So, that's supposed to happen
[24:11] Tuesday, Lord willing. Okay. And so, I
[24:14] was going to have an offering this
[24:15] morning towards that, but Amen. with so
[24:17] many gone and everything and we're not
[24:18] having it done yet, let's just wait till
[24:20] we get it all all in and then we'll tell
[24:22] you what we have need of and then we'll
[24:23] go maybe have an offering next weekend
[24:25] for that. Would that be okay?
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if anybody has something you
[24:29] want to give in between or something,
[24:30] you just talk to brother Brian say,
[24:31] "Hey, you know, I just want to do I want
[24:33] to do this or whatever." Okay? But for
[24:37] everybody, give everybody a chance to be
[24:38] blessed.
[24:40] Amen. Amen. One more important very very
[24:44] important announcement we want to make
[24:46] and it's it's on a um I'm talking about
[24:50] whistles and bells kind of an
[24:52] announcement. Amen. Is that all right?
[24:55] Amen. Brother Gersham and Courtney stand
[24:57] up. They got engaged.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:03] [Applause]
[25:06] Amen. Thank y'all. Congratulations.
[25:10] Congratulations. You can be seated. How
[25:11] long have y'all been dating?
[25:14] &gt;&gt; Three and a
[25:17] &gt;&gt; three and a half month.
[25:19] All right. Well, that's okay. Me and my
[25:22] wife, I think we're right at three
[25:23] months when we got engaged. We didn't we
[25:25] didn't mess around either.
[25:30] But anyway, so that's all right. Amen.
[25:32] When you find the right one, why wait,
[25:34] right? Amen. I drove up drove past them
[25:37] this morning and and they got out of
[25:39] their truck. I pulled up in here and I
[25:41] said to Donna, I said, "I hear wedding
[25:43] bells
[25:45] or something like that, didn't I,
[25:46] honey?" And so I came in here and
[25:48] Brother Willie said, "Hey, you can
[25:49] announce that they're going to get
[25:50] married." So I was like, "That's
[25:52] awesome." So praise the Lord. Everybody
[25:55] happy this morning.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how we like it. God bless
[25:58] you. Let's worship the Lord. We'll turn

[49:21] Oh, let the sons and the daughters sing.
[49:29] I'm surrendering
[49:31] my all.
[49:33] [Music]
[49:37] I surrender to the king.
[49:45] And father, I hear it growing louder.
[49:50] The song of your redeem. As the saints
[49:54] of every nation
[49:57] are awakening a sing from our hearts
[50:02] there comes an anthem. Oh hear the
[50:06] heavens ring. This is our song
[50:11] a song to our king.
[50:14] Let the worshipers arise.
[50:20] Oh, let the sons and the daughters sing.
[50:28] Oh, I'm surrendering
[50:30] my all.
[50:36] I surrender to the king.
[50:44] And father I see a bride in power with
[50:49] full authority.
[50:52] She is claiming every promise and
[50:56] believing what she speaks. Every weapon
[51:01] formed against her has fallen at her
[51:05] feet. Oh hear her praise.
[51:09] Oh the king of kings.
[51:12] Let the worshippers arise.
[51:18] Oh, let the sons and the daughters sing.
[51:26] Oh, I'm surrendering
[51:28] my all
[51:35] to the king.
[51:39] All sing it.
[51:41] Let the worshippers arise.
[51:48] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[51:56] I'm gendering my all.
[52:00] [Music]
[52:03] I surrender to the king.
[52:07] Aren't you thankful this morning?
[52:09] I was actually thinking that song as I
[52:11] was driving here this morning. I said,
[52:13] you know, I'm going to ask him to sing
[52:14] Let the Worshippers Arise. And I
[52:17] thought, God knows before we even asked.
[52:19] That's how much caring he is. He just
[52:21] says, hey, I'll confirm it today. I
[52:24] said, thank you for confirming it.
[52:25] Aren't you thankful? I believe we live
[52:26] in a time that it it's not a time to sit
[52:29] back and relax.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; I was thinking as I was driving over
[52:32] here, Brother Ber, I thought it's time
[52:35] to arise. Yeah, it
[52:37] &gt;&gt; it's not a time to sit back and relax.
[52:39] It's it's a time to buckle up and put on
[52:43] the armor and say, "God, I I'm moving
[52:45] forward." God didn't give you a message
[52:48] just to sit back and just relax. He
[52:50] didn't open just part of the book just
[52:53] to say, "Hey, he didn't set you free
[52:55] just to be like, I'm going to barely
[52:57] make it." But he's gave you a way. He's
[53:00] gave you a light. He He's gave you the
[53:02] greatest thing that's ever hit this
[53:04] planet.
[53:06] and he's calling you to arise. And we
[53:08] get up in the morning and we like we're
[53:10] about to die. We I it blows my mind that
[53:13] we get up in the morning and we're down
[53:14] and out. But we should put our feet on
[53:17] the ground and say, "God, I'm thankful
[53:19] for waking me up this morning. I'm
[53:22] thankful to know the truth." I tell you
[53:25] what, I I I come out of a Baptist home.
[53:28] I come out of a I call me the CEO
[53:31] Christian, Brother Ber. Uh I I came on
[53:34] uh uh what was it? Christmas, Easter,
[53:36] and other holidays. That's when I came
[53:38] to church. But I'm thankful that God
[53:41] gave me the truth that every time them
[53:43] doors are open, I don't care what we're
[53:46] on vacation. Yes. My wife, we're going
[53:48] to get fed.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; I I'm just that way. Because when you
[53:52] fall in love with the maker,
[53:55] &gt;&gt; when you fall in love with your God,
[53:57] when he becomes personal to you,
[54:00] &gt;&gt; when you realize you can't live without
[54:02] him, when you see sister Ber healed of
[54:05] cancer and you see things changing and
[54:07] you you God is the still same yesterday
[54:10] and today and forever.
[54:12] We serve a God.
[54:14] [Music]
[54:16] Oh my, I love him this morning. I like
[54:19] to brag on them. I like to talk about
[54:21] him. I'm not here to talk about me. I'm
[54:24] here to lift the one up that carried the
[54:26] load. He's carried it all for you today.
[54:29] May God bless you. I better stop. We'll
[54:31] be preaching all day long. But I'm here
[54:33] to tell you, God is good.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful. I just, you know, you
[54:37] going to call me a holy roller, whatever
[54:39] today, but I'm thankful to be called
[54:41] that today.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; I'm just, you know, they say, "Chris,
[54:44] you're a nut." I said, "Well, I want to
[54:45] leave me that way. I'm happy that way."
[54:47] I tell you, the more I've been in this
[54:49] message, it's been nothing but good.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; This message has been nothing but good.
[54:54] It, you know, it's took me years and
[54:56] years to to grow in wisdom and strength
[54:58] and but I'm I'm so thankful every day
[55:00] he's working on me.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful he's working on me. May God
[55:05] bless you. God bless you, saints. You
[55:06] may be seated. I hope it's okay. I was
[55:08] asking my wife, would she could she sing
[55:10] a song this morning if you don't mind?
[55:12] Uh I just had this song on my heart,
[55:13] too, and I hopefully she can encourage
[55:16] you today. We thank you in the name of
[55:18] Jesus Christ. Brother Larry Harris sends
[55:20] his greetings. We moved to
[55:22] Campbellville, Kentucky. Brother Wade
[55:24] was there and um we're kind of like two
[55:27] hours away on the opposite side of you
[55:28] now. I was looking on the map trying to
[55:30] figure out where where everybody was,
[55:32] but we're like two hours on the opposite
[55:33] side. And I'm just thankful there's
[55:35] bride AC. I was driving here and I
[55:37] thought we passed all these churches and
[55:38] I thought young people you should be
[55:41] blessed today
[55:43] that there's plenty of people going to
[55:45] church but who has the key to unlock the
[55:47] door?
[55:48] &gt;&gt; And I pulled up brother Ber and I
[55:50] thought here's another church that has
[55:52] the key to unlock the door.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; You know that it ain't not it's it's
[55:57] grace. It's grace. It's it's nothing
[55:59] you've done. It's just what God has done
[56:02] for you.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; He's gave you grace in this day. May
[56:06] this song bless you this morning.
[56:12] [Music]
[56:21] &gt;&gt; There we go.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[56:26] Sometimes I fall
[56:32] to my knees
[56:34] and pray.
[56:38] Come Jesus, come.
[56:43] Let today be the day.
[56:50] Sometimes I feel
[56:56] I'm going to break,
[57:01] but I'm holding on
[57:06] to a hope that won't fade.
[57:13] Come Jesus, come.
[57:18] We've been waiting so long
[57:24] for the day you return
[57:28] to heal every hurt and write every
[57:32] wrong.
[57:34] [Music]
[57:36] We need you right now.
[57:42] Come and turn this around.
[57:48] Deep down I know this world isn't home.
[57:55] Come Jesus,
[57:57] come.
[58:01] There'll be no war.
[58:06] And there'll be no chains
[58:12] when Jesus comes.
[58:17] Let today be the day
[58:23] he'll come for the weak
[58:28] and the strong just the same
[58:34] and all will believe
[58:40] in the power of his name.
[58:44] Sing it with me. Come Jesus, come.
[58:51] We've been waiting so long
[58:57] for the day you return.
[59:00] To heal every hurt and write every
[59:05] wrong.
[59:09] We need you right now.
[59:15] Come and turn this around.
[59:21] Deep down I know this world isn't home.
[59:28] Come Jesus
[59:30] come.
[59:34] One day he'll come
[59:39] and we'll stand face to face.
[59:44] Come and lay it all down.
[59:50] Cause it might be today.
[59:57] The time is right now.
[1:00:03] There's no need to wait.
[1:00:08] Your past will be washed
[1:00:14] by rivers
[1:00:16] of grace.
[1:00:20] Come Jesus, come.
[1:00:25] We've been waiting
[1:00:27] so long
[1:00:31] for the day you return
[1:00:34] to heal every hurt and write every
[1:00:38] wrong.
[1:00:43] We need you right now.
[1:00:48] Come and turn this around.
[1:00:55] Deep down I know this world isn't home.
[1:01:01] Come Jesus,
[1:01:04] come.
[1:01:07] Come Jesus, come.
[1:01:12] We've been waiting so long
[1:01:17] for the day you return
[1:01:21] to heal every hurt and write every
[1:01:26] wrong.
[1:01:30] We need you right now.
[1:01:36] Come and turn this around.
[1:01:43] Deep down I know this world isn't home.
[1:01:49] Come Jesus,
[1:01:51] come.
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:58] Father, we truly just come before your
[1:02:00] throne today,
[1:02:03] God. We're needy people, Father.
[1:02:06] God, I ask we read these words, Father,
[1:02:09] and don't take it lightly. May it come
[1:02:11] through every aisle, come every through
[1:02:13] every heart. May you come through my
[1:02:14] heart, God. May be delivered in love and
[1:02:18] God, not out of selfish or motives, but
[1:02:20] God, you would speak today. We come to
[1:02:24] hear from you, Lord. And God, may you
[1:02:26] encourage your people. Whatever it is,
[1:02:28] Lord,
[1:02:30] we just love you, Father. We're just so
[1:02:32] looking for your coming, Lord. It's I
[1:02:34] believe it's anytime. And I I believe
[1:02:36] we're standing at the door, Lord, and
[1:02:39] we've put some of the world is the most
[1:02:41] of the world has put you on the outdoor
[1:02:43] knocking. But God, we've opened our
[1:02:45] heart today. And we say, Lord, come in
[1:02:47] and change our lives. And God, let us be
[1:02:50] a fire on the hill that serves you,
[1:02:52] Lord, with everything we got. Forgive us
[1:02:56] of our failures, Lord. May you speak
[1:02:58] your only what you'd have speak this
[1:02:59] morning. We love you. Bless this church.
[1:03:01] Bless your people. Bless brother Ber,
[1:03:03] faithful pastor. bless him today.
[1:03:06] Encourage him in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:03:08] Amen. God bless you today. We we God we
[1:03:12] we greet you in the name of Jesus. We uh
[1:03:15] I don't if you've known me, but I'm
[1:03:17] Chris Kathy. That's Rachel. Kathy. I got
[1:03:19] my son Isaac. He's about 6 foot three
[1:03:21] now. He I have to look up to him. Uh
[1:03:25] Joseph is uh catching up. And uh man,
[1:03:28] it's time's flying. Um I thought I
[1:03:31] thought this morning I'm like, man, I I
[1:03:33] I'm going out and he's going up. So So
[1:03:36] you can tell my wife still feeds me
[1:03:38] well. So, but I'm thankful that God
[1:03:40] feeds us the most. And um thankful,
[1:03:43] brother Ber, for having us. And I do
[1:03:45] count it an honor to be before you
[1:03:47] today. And I don't count it lightly
[1:03:49] because I believe you're God's children.
[1:03:51] And uh I just I I this could be my last
[1:03:54] service. And I just this could be your
[1:03:56] last service. Listen, I just let's enter
[1:03:58] in today. Let's come expecting. Brother
[1:04:00] Bram says you get expecting what you
[1:04:02] came for today. So, if you came for just
[1:04:04] a crumb, then you're going to get a
[1:04:05] crumb. But I I drove through here and I
[1:04:07] said, "Lord, I I really want to be spoke
[1:04:09] to this morning. I even myself." And may
[1:04:12] God really speak this morning. God bless
[1:04:14] you as we turn this morning uh to
[1:04:17] Ephesians uh Ephesians chapter 5. Very,
[1:04:21] very familiar scripture. Ephesians 5
[1:04:24] verse uh verse one. We're just going to
[1:04:26] go through that this morning. Ephesians
[1:04:28] 5 verse one. This is just kind of what
[1:04:31] God kept leading me back through last
[1:04:33] night and just thinking on what God had
[1:04:35] to speak on. But Ephesians uh 5:1
[1:04:39] uh we're going to go through this. It
[1:04:40] says, it says in Ephesians 5:1, it says,
[1:04:43] "Be ye therefore followers of God as as
[1:04:46] dear ch dear children and walk in love."
[1:04:50] I believe a lot of times in this message
[1:04:51] that we might know the book, we might
[1:04:53] know we you might have been raised in
[1:04:55] the message. I wasn't raised in the
[1:04:56] message, but I, you know, I tell you
[1:04:59] what, people doesn't care what you got
[1:05:00] to say. People don't care what you how
[1:05:02] many quotes you know if you're not
[1:05:04] walking in love. Um, it says, "Walk in
[1:05:06] love as Christ also had loved us and had
[1:05:09] given himself for us. An offering and a
[1:05:12] sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling
[1:05:15] savior." Aren't you thankful that we
[1:05:17] have a sweet smelling savior that just
[1:05:19] loves us? And I'm just building to this.
[1:05:21] And I like what it says in verse four.
[1:05:24] It says, "We are not required to be
[1:05:26] perfect." Aren't you thankful that
[1:05:28] you're not required to be perfect, but
[1:05:30] to receive his love? You know, a lot of
[1:05:32] times we think we got to be perfect. And
[1:05:34] young people, you think you got to I got
[1:05:36] to be the most per you're going to fail.
[1:05:39] But aren't you thankful that God that
[1:05:41] God died for you? all that he all your
[1:05:43] sins, everything that you've done, you
[1:05:45] know, you're going to fall, but I'm here
[1:05:47] to tell you to get back up.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; You know, get back up. He says, we are
[1:05:51] not you, we are not required, but we're
[1:05:53] perfect. Uh we're not required to be
[1:05:55] perfect, but we receive his love. Verse
[1:05:57] five, we cannot earn God's favor. It's
[1:05:59] free given freely. Aren't you thankful
[1:06:01] of that?
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Um and then uh um it goes on, I want to
[1:06:06] read that verse uh uh verse sorry, I
[1:06:10] think I read the wrong thing. Sorry. But
[1:06:11] verse verse uh two, go back to verse
[1:06:14] two. It says, "And walk in love as
[1:06:15] Christ hath loved us, has given himself
[1:06:18] for as an offering and sacrifice to God
[1:06:20] for a sweet smoke." Verse three, "But
[1:06:22] fornification, uncleanness and
[1:06:24] covetousness. Let us not once named
[1:06:26] among you as become saints." Verse four,
[1:06:30] it says, "Neither filthiness, nor
[1:06:32] foolish talk, nor jesting, which are not
[1:06:35] covenant, but rather giving of thanks.
[1:06:37] For this ye know, that no homonger,
[1:06:41] nor unclean person, nor uh covenant man,
[1:06:44] and the idoltor, hath any inheritance in
[1:06:47] the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no
[1:06:50] man deceive you with vain words. Beau uh
[1:06:53] for because of these things come in
[1:06:55] wrath. It says, the God of God upon the
[1:06:58] children of a disobedience. But ye but
[1:07:01] not ye therefore be takers of them, for
[1:07:04] ye were sometimes darkness. Aren't you
[1:07:07] thankful that you could say, "I was
[1:07:09] sometimes darkness, but now you are
[1:07:12] light." I love that scripture because,
[1:07:14] you know, we were all caught in that
[1:07:16] that that that light that we were
[1:07:18] sometimes darkness, but now you are yet
[1:07:21] light in the Lord. Walk as children of
[1:07:23] light. For verse 9, for the fruit of the
[1:07:25] spirit is all what?
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Goodness and truth. In righteousness and
[1:07:31] truth. Aren't you thankful? It's all
[1:07:32] good. There ain't nothing God that that
[1:07:35] you can say today that God hasn't been
[1:07:37] good to you.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm here to tell you that the
[1:07:40] devil gives you bad days, but God
[1:07:42] doesn't give you a bad day.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful of that? Verse uh
[1:07:47] 10, it says, "Provening what is
[1:07:48] acceptable unto the Lord." And it says,
[1:07:50] "Have no fellowship with the unfruitful
[1:07:54] works of darkness." And it goes on to
[1:07:56] say, "Uh, but rather reprove them." In
[1:08:00] other words, expose them. In verse 12 it
[1:08:02] says, "For it is a shame even to speak
[1:08:04] to those things which are done of them
[1:08:07] in secret, but in all things that are
[1:08:10] reproved and made manifest by the light.
[1:08:12] For whomsoever doeth make manifest in
[1:08:15] the light." It says, "Wherefore," he
[1:08:18] said, I like what he says here. This is
[1:08:20] the Lord speaking. He says, "Wherefore,"
[1:08:22] he saith, "Awake thou that sleepest, and
[1:08:26] arise from the dead, and Christ shall
[1:08:28] give thy life." You may be seated. May
[1:08:30] God had his blessings. And I I'm He said
[1:08:33] to sing that song, let the worshippers
[1:08:35] arise. And I thought how great that song
[1:08:38] is. Because we live in a time that I
[1:08:41] believe that the bride needs to wake up.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; I believe we live in a time that,
[1:08:46] brother Ber, we live in a time that that
[1:08:48] that the message has become common to
[1:08:50] us. That we've grown up in the message.
[1:08:53] We've lived in a home that's grown up in
[1:08:54] the message. But but really I I believe
[1:08:57] the Lord is saying today in verse 14, he
[1:09:00] says, "Awake thou that sleepeth."
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I I've got
[1:09:04] up at 5 4:00 on plane flights for work
[1:09:07] and I uh about every other week and you
[1:09:09] get to the motel room and you you want
[1:09:12] to set up a wakeup call cuz your
[1:09:13] flight's at 6:00, but you got to get up
[1:09:15] at 3:00 and then the only person is
[1:09:18] awake is the pilot and God. I mean, I'm
[1:09:21] just being honest this morning. You
[1:09:22] know, you get up, you get to the you get
[1:09:24] there and everybody's asleep. They walk
[1:09:26] on the plane, they they get to the
[1:09:28] plane, they get I'm just bringing life
[1:09:30] to you today, but you get to the airport
[1:09:32] and you feel like, man, is the air is
[1:09:34] even the captain awake. You know, you
[1:09:36] you look down through the hall and you
[1:09:38] get on the plane and you look through
[1:09:39] there and you go, "M, I hope the
[1:09:41] captain's awake cuz I'm not awake that
[1:09:43] this morning." And I thought, but you
[1:09:45] know, we serve a God that doesn't sleep.
[1:09:48] We serve a God that doesn't sleep on
[1:09:50] you. I don't care what time of morning
[1:09:53] it is. I don't care what time you get on
[1:09:54] your knees, what time you call on God.
[1:09:57] Our God is a 24-hour God that doesn't
[1:10:00] sleep. That's always a caring God that
[1:10:03] says, "Hey, while you're sleeping, I'm
[1:10:05] still watching over you."
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; That's our God today. But it says,
[1:10:10] "Awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[1:10:12] the dead." And I'm here to tell you
[1:10:14] today, I was reading that. And I was
[1:10:15] looking that up, brother Ber the other
[1:10:17] night and I was really studying that and
[1:10:18] I thought, "Wow." And they used to read
[1:10:20] this back in the day when they would
[1:10:22] baptize somebody, they would actually
[1:10:24] put them under the water and they would
[1:10:25] actually recite these words, "Awake thou
[1:10:27] that sleepest from the dead." And
[1:10:30] meaning that your old flesh, maybe you
[1:10:32] haven't been baptized today, but I'm
[1:10:34] here to tell you, don't wait. Don't wait
[1:10:37] to get a God. Don't wait to get an axe
[1:10:39] experience with God. Don't wait to get
[1:10:42] God on the inside. Don't wait to let the
[1:10:44] Holy Spirit change your life.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; But he says, "Wherefore awake, awake
[1:10:49] that sleepeth and arise from the dead,
[1:10:51] and Christ shall give thy life." Verse
[1:10:53] 15 says, "See then that we walk
[1:10:56] circumstantly not as fools but as wise."
[1:11:00] Verse uh 16, redeeming the time because
[1:11:03] the days are evil.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; And I just want to speak a few minutes
[1:11:07] on this on this thought, redeeming the
[1:11:09] time. I believe we live in a time that
[1:11:12] time is going so fast you can't keep up.
[1:11:15] I believe we're living in such a
[1:11:17] busyness of life. The devil keeps us
[1:11:20] busy, young people. He keeps you busy
[1:11:22] with social media. He keeps you busy
[1:11:24] with social your phone. He keeps you
[1:11:27] busy. I tell you, I was at a store the
[1:11:29] other day, Brother Ber, and this young
[1:11:31] kid was doing this and literally hid the
[1:11:33] wall. Hid the wall. He didn't even look
[1:11:36] up. He just hid the wall. I said,
[1:11:40] "That's the time we live in that go that
[1:11:42] the devil wants to keep you so busy,
[1:11:44] young people, that you don't have no
[1:11:46] time for God. And God is still waiting
[1:11:49] for you to come back to your first love.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; He We're in a time that everything's
[1:11:55] running fast. We're we're in a time that
[1:11:58] is busy." And I said, "You know what
[1:11:59] busy stands for? Being under Satan's
[1:12:02] yoke.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Being under Satan's yoke." God. The
[1:12:06] devil wants to keep you so yolked up in
[1:12:09] even your job or whatever you're doing
[1:12:11] that you'll even miss Wednesday nights.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's okay to miss a little Wednesday
[1:12:16] night here and there. It's okay to maybe
[1:12:18] miss a Sunday, but no. Have you ever
[1:12:21] missed the gas station when you went by
[1:12:22] when it was almost on E? No,
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; I have. I'm going to be honest.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; My car didn't run that good, Brother
[1:12:31] Ber. I I kind of started putting. But
[1:12:34] maybe some of you felt like I barely got
[1:12:36] here today, but you're here. And maybe
[1:12:38] you didn't feel like getting out of the
[1:12:40] bed today. And maybe you feel like you
[1:12:42] just put along in life. But I'm here to
[1:12:44] tell you, let God come on and change
[1:12:47] that attitude. Let God fill you up.
[1:12:50] Maybe you say, "Brother Chris, my joy is
[1:12:52] empty." Well, guess what? He'll give you
[1:12:54] some more joy today. Whatever you need
[1:12:57] today.
[1:12:59] Well, I tell you, aren't you thankful
[1:13:00] that we got a little gauge? And
[1:13:02] sometimes, I mean, there's not every day
[1:13:04] that I feel like waking up. And there's
[1:13:06] been days I'm like, "Oh gosh, I got to
[1:13:07] preach today. Oh, my barely can feel my
[1:13:10] body. I'm not feeling good." But I'm
[1:13:12] here to tell you, it's not about your
[1:13:13] feelings today.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; It's not about how we feel. It's it's
[1:13:17] about we just come here and say, "God,
[1:13:18] you have control. You have control of my
[1:13:21] life." But now, we live in a time that
[1:13:23] we need to redeem our time back. The
[1:13:26] devil's trying to steal your family's
[1:13:27] time, your devotion time, your prayer
[1:13:30] time, your everything in your life. The
[1:13:33] devil wants to take up in your family's
[1:13:35] life, fill it with games, and hey,
[1:13:37] they're all good in their place. In
[1:13:39] volleyball, I saw all that's good in his
[1:13:41] time. But God wants to fill you young
[1:13:44] people. He wants to fill you with the
[1:13:45] Holy Ghost.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; He wants to give you a life that's worth
[1:13:49] living. Maybe you're maybe you say,
[1:13:51] "Well, my family don't do this. My dad
[1:13:53] don't pray. My mama don't read the
[1:13:54] Bible." Well, guess what? You read the
[1:13:56] Bible.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; You pray. You read your scriptures every
[1:14:00] day. You listen to the prophet. If your
[1:14:02] parents don't listen to it, you listen
[1:14:04] to it.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, we're living
[1:14:08] in a time, brother Wade, that we need to
[1:14:10] redeem our time back. We don't have I
[1:14:13] tell you, I'm 43 years old and as time
[1:14:16] goes, I'll be 50 and 60. Before you know
[1:14:18] it, Isaac's going to already he just got
[1:14:21] his permit the other day. And I said,
[1:14:22] "Lord Jesus." I said, "Son," I said, "I
[1:14:24] guess I need to practice and you need
[1:14:26] the prayer."
[1:14:29] But I started to realize, "Where is time
[1:14:31] going?" Hey, just before a blink of an
[1:14:34] eye, you're a grandparent or whatever.
[1:14:36] And these young people look at us like
[1:14:38] we're crazy, but they'll say the same
[1:14:39] thing.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; But we're living in a time. We have the
[1:14:43] greatest message of the hour. We have
[1:14:45] the whole book revealed before you from
[1:14:47] Genesis to Revelation. What are you
[1:14:50] doing with it?
[1:14:52] It's time to take the sword and say,
[1:14:55] "Lord, wherever you want me, I'll
[1:14:57] follow. If I'm the if I'm the housewife,
[1:14:59] I'll be the best housewife. If I be the
[1:15:02] I'll be the Sunday school teacher, I'll
[1:15:04] be the best Sunday. If I'll be a leoty,
[1:15:06] I'll be the best leoty."
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; If he tells me to clean the bathrooms,
[1:15:10] I'll clean it the best I can.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But I like redeeming the time. I
[1:15:16] wrote this down. I was looking this up.
[1:15:18] Redeeming the time. And it it talks
[1:15:20] about a word called chyros. Chyros
[1:15:23] meaning it's a time that we look back
[1:15:25] at. In the Greek word, we look at chyros
[1:15:27] as like on your watch. You look at your
[1:15:30] time every day. I You're probably
[1:15:31] looking at your time. When's he going to
[1:15:33] be quiet?
[1:15:35] But I but I'm here to tell you, we're
[1:15:36] living in a Kronos time, brother. That's
[1:15:38] in a time that that's in a different
[1:15:40] atmosphere.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; That's in God's time when he says one
[1:15:44] day is a thousand years. A thousand
[1:15:46] years is a day. And I tell you what, we
[1:15:49] it's still there. It's it's dark out
[1:15:51] here. It looks light. We were leaving
[1:15:53] the house. It looked It looked dark, but
[1:15:55] I'm telling you, it's it's dark in out
[1:15:57] here. But it's light and go tonight.
[1:15:59] It's light in this building today.
[1:16:02] Aren't you thankful? He says, I like
[1:16:04] redeeming the time. It comes from the
[1:16:06] Greek word. It says extra orzo. It says
[1:16:09] it means to buy up, to purchase, or
[1:16:11] rescue from the loss. Aren't you
[1:16:13] thinking that God rescued you from where
[1:16:16] you were one day?
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe you were in a p maybe you're in a
[1:16:20] pool room. Maybe you were in a Baptist
[1:16:22] church like me. Maybe you just went to
[1:16:24] church on Christmas, Easter, and the
[1:16:26] holidays. But God has redeemed you back.
[1:16:29] He's took you from the pawn shop and
[1:16:32] he's gave you something to live for.
[1:16:35] He's gave you something to not just wake
[1:16:37] up and go, "Well,
[1:16:39] I see it every day. People wake up and
[1:16:41] they they get in their bed and then they
[1:16:43] go they say, "God, God, lay me down to
[1:16:45] sleep." And then they get up and they
[1:16:48] It's just terrible to get up. But I'm
[1:16:50] here to tell you, I tell you, you should
[1:16:52] wake up and say, "God, what do you want
[1:16:54] me to do today for you? Who you want me
[1:16:56] to witness to today? Redeem your time
[1:17:00] back." Because the devil is Man, I need
[1:17:02] to remind you, church, the devil is
[1:17:04] under your feet today. He's not. He's
[1:17:07] under your feet. And I tell you, it
[1:17:09] should put something inside of you to
[1:17:12] say, "I'm a called out child of God."
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; That I didn't just come here. We got to
[1:17:17] remind the devil who our daddy is.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; We need to remind the devil who he is. I
[1:17:23] heard brother Donnie say at the
[1:17:24] meetings, he said when he took the keys,
[1:17:26] I loved it. He said when he took the
[1:17:28] keys of of heaven and hell, he come down
[1:17:30] there and took it from the devil of
[1:17:32] hell, he kicked the door open. And he
[1:17:34] said all of a sudden all the selfies he
[1:17:36] had. You know what selfies are? Maybe
[1:17:38] you don't, but but you know when that
[1:17:40] young people do. And he said all of a
[1:17:42] sudden he took the keys of the of hell.
[1:17:44] And he said all of a sudden all his
[1:17:46] selfies of everybody he thought he had
[1:17:48] started falling off the wall.
[1:17:51] It started falling off the wall. I said,
[1:17:53] "Brother Donnie, that's the truth. I
[1:17:56] thought about us. How many selfies the
[1:17:59] devil took of you and had took of me?
[1:18:01] But God redeemed the time. He's redeemed
[1:18:04] you. He's called you out. He's gave you
[1:18:07] a light.
[1:18:10] He's gave you a purpose.
[1:18:13] When it says redeem in the time, verse
[1:18:14] 16, verse 17, it says, "Wherefore be ye
[1:18:18] not unwise, but understanding what will
[1:18:20] of the Lord is." Verse 18, it says, "And
[1:18:23] be not drunk with wine, wearing in
[1:18:25] excess, but be filled with the spirit,
[1:18:29] speaking to yourselves through psalms
[1:18:31] and hymns, I love this, and spiritual
[1:18:34] songs." Young people, Taylor Swift ain't
[1:18:36] a spiritual song. I I'm sorry to say
[1:18:39] that today, but Taylor Swift and all
[1:18:42] this craziness out here is not a
[1:18:44] spiritual song. It's nothing but the
[1:18:47] pits of hell coming through these radio
[1:18:49] stations that's coming after you on your
[1:18:51] Facebook ads and every single thing he
[1:18:54] can get you in. He is trying to take
[1:18:56] your time somewhere you shouldn't be.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; I pray it's a blessing today. He says,
[1:19:02] "And then be not drunk with the wine."
[1:19:04] Verse 19, "Speak yourselves in psalms
[1:19:07] and spiritual songs." Find something
[1:19:09] that's genuine. Find something that that
[1:19:11] that that you know, you look behind it
[1:19:14] and know how they wrote the song. Don't
[1:19:16] just look at and go, "That's a great
[1:19:17] song." They might be a devil worshipper
[1:19:19] just singing a song about God.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; I tell you, we got to redeem the pond.
[1:19:25] Verse 20, giving thanks always for all
[1:19:27] things unto God in the Father in the
[1:19:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I tell
[1:19:31] you, that's hard to do sometimes when
[1:19:32] you're going through the hardest trial
[1:19:34] of your life and just say, "Lord, I'm
[1:19:35] going to give thanks always no matter
[1:19:37] what it is."
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; That's hard to do when you when they
[1:19:40] call you and say, "You got two months to
[1:19:41] live." And say, "God, I still love you.
[1:19:44] I still care for you. You you're still
[1:19:46] my all and all."
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Submitting yourselves to one another in
[1:19:50] the fear of God. I like this
[1:19:53] translation. and he doesn't have that.
[1:19:55] But another translation says, "Be in uh
[1:19:58] imitators of God in everything you do.
[1:20:02] For then you will represent your father
[1:20:04] and the beloved sons of God and continue
[1:20:06] to walk surrendered to the extravagant
[1:20:09] love of Christ." I thought, man, Lord,
[1:20:13] let me walk in a every single day. I
[1:20:16] don't have but so much time in a day.
[1:20:18] And how much time have I set aside for
[1:20:20] God? Yeah.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; How much time have I set aside at night
[1:20:25] to say, "God, I do thy lay me down to
[1:20:27] sleep." I'm preaching to me today, too.
[1:20:29] I'm here to tell you, we got to redeem
[1:20:31] our time back.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about a Cairo time, a
[1:20:36] time that we look at and it's 11:32. But
[1:20:39] God doesn't look at time like that. God
[1:20:42] looks at a time and he goes, "Hey, when
[1:20:44] we pass on, I I bet he looks at you go,
[1:20:46] "Whoa, hey, it's good to see you,
[1:20:47] Brother Chris. It's only been two
[1:20:49] minutes. you've lived two minutes. But
[1:20:51] for us, we feel like it's been 50 years
[1:20:53] and 70 years and we look at the
[1:20:56] calendar, but but but God has pointed us
[1:20:58] to look at Israel and look at the wars
[1:21:00] and rumors. But church, I believe we're
[1:21:03] here.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I believe we're right at the door and
[1:21:07] the ark doors closing. And I want to
[1:21:09] tell you today, if you don't see me
[1:21:10] again, I'm here to tell you to get while
[1:21:13] there while there's grace of God. Get to
[1:21:15] the ark right now and say, "God, I
[1:21:18] surrender my life. Yeah,
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; I surrender my soul. I surrender my
[1:21:22] life. Young people, young girls, uh just
[1:21:25] give it your all. And you know what,
[1:21:27] young people, don't marry somebody that
[1:21:29] doesn't love God.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Your life will be so miserable.
[1:21:34] Find somebody that loves God more than
[1:21:36] you love them.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Find somebody that really loves God that
[1:21:41] not just talk the wall and say the
[1:21:43] message quotes, but find somebody that
[1:21:45] really loves God. Amen.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; As he was saying, someone got engaged.
[1:21:50] Congratulations. And I thought, I
[1:21:52] remember that day. It wasn't It didn't
[1:21:53] last long. You get engaged, it's like,
[1:21:54] let's go. Let's go. You know, you don't
[1:21:57] want to be It's just, you know, they're
[1:21:59] the one. You know, you're the one. But I
[1:22:02] I'm thankful for that. But I thought,
[1:22:03] young people, redeem your time back.
[1:22:06] Don't waste your time dating filth of
[1:22:08] the world.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; I don't know why it's not in my notes,
[1:22:11] but don't waste your time dating filth
[1:22:14] of the world that, you know, they don't
[1:22:16] love God. you know it. You They don't
[1:22:18] love God. They listen to Taylor Swift.
[1:22:20] They listen to all these other trash
[1:22:22] people and all of a sudden come to
[1:22:24] church and just say, "Well, I want God
[1:22:26] today." And all they're doing is just
[1:22:28] sitting there waiting to to pry on you.
[1:22:30] But I'm here to tell you, God, find
[1:22:32] somebody that's sold out to God.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; They're sold out to this message of the
[1:22:37] hour.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; I don't know. It's not in my notes. I
[1:22:41] didn't bring I didn't bring all them
[1:22:42] notes, but God just speaking this
[1:22:43] morning.
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:46] But it says, I like this one one
[1:22:48] scripture in this one verse. It's a
[1:22:50] different in verse 14. It says, "Awake,
[1:22:52] oh sleeper, rise from the dead in Christ
[1:22:54] and he'll give you light. Be careful how
[1:22:57] to you live. Don't live like fools." But
[1:22:59] but like who's that who that are wise.
[1:23:03] I like what it says right here. Uh it
[1:23:06] talks about brother Brandham the prophet
[1:23:08] of God says he said this is the hour. He
[1:23:11] said, "This is the greatest hour that
[1:23:13] the church has ever moved into." He
[1:23:16] said, "Just before the coming of the
[1:23:17] bridegroom, oh, the real church of the
[1:23:20] living God ought to be on fire."
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; I mean, this is 1964.
[1:23:27] He says the real church should be living
[1:23:29] on fire. I believe that
[1:23:32] half the time we travel, I don't know
[1:23:34] why we got a wet blanket on us. I'm here
[1:23:37] to tell you need to get a little fire on
[1:23:39] the inside. You need to get a little
[1:23:41] reviving today. Say, "God, revive me
[1:23:44] today. I'm tired of living stagnant. I'm
[1:23:48] the way. I'm tired of just barely
[1:23:50] getting through." He didn't save you to
[1:23:52] barely get through. He saved you to put
[1:23:55] you on your feet and conquer the devil.
[1:23:59] Oh, he's conquered death hell in the
[1:24:01] grave. He's not a halfway God. He's not
[1:24:04] a God that just saves you. Say, "Well,
[1:24:06] you just live through life." And you
[1:24:08] know what, brother Chris? Well, I'm just
[1:24:09] going to get up this morning. No, he
[1:24:11] gave you something to praise him about.
[1:24:14] He set you free. He's gave you the keys
[1:24:17] to open the door.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, I I always pray. I said,
[1:24:24] "Boys, you get some of this. Don't get
[1:24:27] what get get what daddy's got." That's
[1:24:29] like that one preacher would say, "Hot
[1:24:31] dog, he's got it." I'm here to tell you,
[1:24:33] get something real. Get something that
[1:24:36] will change your life.
[1:24:38] redeem the time back. But he says just
[1:24:41] before the coming of the bridegroom, oh
[1:24:43] the real church of the living going
[1:24:45] ought to be on fire, burning with the
[1:24:48] light of the gospel being vindicated
[1:24:50] among them. Rise and shine for the light
[1:24:53] has come to you. The light of this this
[1:24:56] day, he says, I like what he says, rise
[1:24:58] and shine. He said, the light of this
[1:25:00] day, Isaiah was the light of his day.
[1:25:03] Noah was the light of his day. Why? He
[1:25:06] had the word manifest.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said in the gospel, the Bible,
[1:25:12] the word of this day, the light of this
[1:25:14] day. What a glorious time we're living.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; And you know what? The light has come in
[1:25:21] your day
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; and my day. And I tell you, we're going
[1:25:24] to be held accountable for what we've
[1:25:26] been seeing.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; You know what? They don't they don't see
[1:25:29] it. I heard the prophet say the other
[1:25:30] day on the tape, he said, "I'm not
[1:25:32] against them people. I'm against the
[1:25:34] organizations."
[1:25:35] There's great people in all these church
[1:25:37] that that that that that grow up and
[1:25:39] they all they can see. But God has gave
[1:25:42] you the entire book.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; He's gave you the entire revelation open
[1:25:48] before your eyes and we still don't
[1:25:50] redeem the time back
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; and say, "God, when I get home, I'm
[1:25:55] going to dedicate the next 30 days. I'm
[1:25:57] going to say, God, I'm going to I'm
[1:25:59] going to pray to you more. I'm going to
[1:26:00] read my Bible more. I'm going to listen
[1:26:02] to these tapes more. Amen.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; We have every app. I'm tell you what, I
[1:26:07] was overseas last year in Ecuador.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; I'm tell you, we are blessed people.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; I got in a car and I rode down. I said,
[1:26:14] "We, Brother Ber," I said, "I'm going on
[1:26:16] a missionary trip and I thought, wow, I
[1:26:18] got in here just kind of joined the
[1:26:20] military." When I was in the military, I
[1:26:22] joined it for the GI Bill. I'm just
[1:26:24] being honest. I joined it to pay for
[1:26:26] college, but when it was time for war
[1:26:28] and they said, "Hey, you're going to
[1:26:30] Iraq." I was like, "I didn't sign up for
[1:26:32] this.
[1:26:35] I signed up. I'm being honest. I signed
[1:26:37] up for the GI Bill, not this. I'm here
[1:26:39] to tell you, when you sign up to be a
[1:26:41] Christian when you sign up to accept
[1:26:43] this message, put on it on the whole
[1:26:46] armor of God. Hey, the devil's going to
[1:26:49] come at you. Your family's going to
[1:26:51] destroy come at you. Family members,
[1:26:54] your kids, your grandchildren. But I'm
[1:26:56] here to tell you, it's time to take a
[1:26:58] stand and say, "God, I will stand for
[1:27:01] this truth." Like Sister Hattie Wright
[1:27:03] said, it's nothing but the truth.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; I know you're all going to say, "Well,
[1:27:08] uh, y'all just get this crazy guy out of
[1:27:10] here." But I'm here to tell you, I love
[1:27:12] Jesus. I love this message. Every single
[1:27:15] day, Brother Ber, it gets sweeter.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; It's it it just it did the book become a
[1:27:21] new book to me. And when the problem is
[1:27:23] today, the book hasn't became a new book
[1:27:26] to you and me. And when it becomes a new
[1:27:29] book and you realize what he's done for
[1:27:31] you,
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; you'll redeem the time.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; You'll redeem the the nonsense of this
[1:27:37] or social media. The other night I was
[1:27:39] on my phone. I was scrolling through it.
[1:27:40] Maybe you had done this and I said,
[1:27:41] "Lord, I'm putting this nonsense down."
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Because all the time we'll sit there and
[1:27:47] we just look this and look down. I said,
[1:27:49] "Lord, I started praying the other
[1:27:50] night. I said, "Lord, let me get I
[1:27:52] control this phone,
[1:27:55] not the phone controls me.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of it. The devil wants you to
[1:28:00] do this all day long and you can't talk
[1:28:02] or you can't do this and all of a sudden
[1:28:04] you're asleep." And I said, "Lord,
[1:28:06] forgive me.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; I'm being honest. I'm being real. I'm
[1:28:09] just being real with you. I hope that's
[1:28:10] okay. I'm just being real. I just
[1:28:12] because I got a tie on doesn't mean I
[1:28:14] don't fail." And I'm here to tell you,
[1:28:16] just because I'm a preacher today, I'm
[1:28:17] here to tell you
[1:28:30] an hour on Facebook.
[1:28:32] I'm just being honest with you today.
[1:28:34] I'm here to tell you, God will go
[1:28:36] whatever time he can get to you. The
[1:28:38] devil will come to you every which way.
[1:28:40] If it's on your job, he'll make you
[1:28:41] work. I can make extra money and not go
[1:28:44] to church. Let me tell you, that's not
[1:28:46] the will of God.
[1:28:49] That's not the will of God to go move
[1:28:51] somewhere. Someone said to me one time,
[1:28:52] "Brother Ber," they said, "Well, we're
[1:28:54] going to move all the way over here."
[1:28:55] And I said, "Is there a church?"
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to make really good
[1:29:00] money. I'm going to make hundreds of
[1:29:01] thousands. I said, first of all, I don't
[1:29:03] care how much money you're going to
[1:29:04] make. Is there a church that will feed
[1:29:05] your family?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Is there a church that stands for the
[1:29:09] message of the hour?
[1:29:12] So too many times we we look at that
[1:29:15] that oh well I look at this and I look
[1:29:16] at this number and look at this well
[1:29:18] it'll help my family. No, it'll actually
[1:29:20] pull you farther away from God.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; That ain't in my notes. But I'm here to
[1:29:25] tell you if you're looking to move away
[1:29:27] make sure they have a church that loves
[1:29:29] God.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; There has a pastor like brother Ber so
[1:29:32] many years been standing for the message
[1:29:34] of the hour.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; People are falling by the wayside. Kids
[1:29:39] and youth and families are falling apart
[1:29:42] because they don't redeem the time
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; and put Jesus Christ where he should be
[1:29:47] put.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Chasing things of this world is
[1:29:51] nonsense. I'm here to tell you it says
[1:29:53] in my Bible it says, "Seek ye the
[1:29:55] kingdom of the first and everything else
[1:29:58] will be added."
[1:30:01] I told the boys the other day, I said,
[1:30:02] "Boys, you listen. If something happens
[1:30:05] to daddy, you seek the kingdom with
[1:30:08] everything that's within you and then
[1:30:10] everything else will be. Don't do it the
[1:30:12] other way. Don't put it the other way.
[1:30:15] You put it out of order, it don't work.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; But too many times we put it out of
[1:30:19] order in God and but we need to redeem
[1:30:22] the time. But I was thinking talking
[1:30:23] about that pilot. You get on the
[1:30:24] airplane and you think about the time
[1:30:26] and you think about how early it is. But
[1:30:28] have you ever just messed the wake up
[1:30:30] call? Have you ever set your alarm and
[1:30:32] you didn't hear it and you're and 30
[1:30:34] minutes passed or an hour passed and
[1:30:35] you're like, "Man, I got called this. I
[1:30:37] got to tell him, I'm sorry I'm late. I
[1:30:39] overslept." I'm here to tell you, you
[1:30:41] don't want to oversleep on God.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you, you got the
[1:30:45] greatest thing that ever hit you today.
[1:30:47] And I'm here to tell you to redeem your
[1:30:49] time and say, "Lord, I want to walk with
[1:30:51] this light that I got. I want to be a
[1:30:54] blessing to the world. I don't care if
[1:30:55] they're on my job. I don't care if
[1:30:57] they're at the gas station. I don't care
[1:30:59] where they're at. They might not look
[1:31:01] like you, but that might be the very
[1:31:03] person that God wants to call in.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Too many times in the message, we go,
[1:31:09] "Oh, well, let me go measure your hair
[1:31:11] and let me go look at your shoes and let
[1:31:13] me look at your pants." You know what? I
[1:31:15] came out of a church. I didn't have any
[1:31:17] of that. I had shorts on, believe it or
[1:31:19] not. But God called me out. Yeah.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Too many times we we got these measuring
[1:31:26] tapes and we Oh, by the way, Brother
[1:31:28] Ber, let me see how big them hit. You
[1:31:30] know what? Stop worrying about them.
[1:31:32] Just pour the love of God on them.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Let God do the cleaning.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Just invite them to church. Let God do
[1:31:40] the cleaning.
[1:31:41] [Applause]
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; It could be the very person on your job
[1:31:45] today that we're waiting on.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; It could be at the gas pump today. It
[1:31:50] could be the person the bomb sitting
[1:31:52] there. Whoever it is, I'm just telling
[1:31:54] you to be salty.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Be salty today. Redeem your time. I like
[1:32:01] that. He said, "Be on fire. We ought to
[1:32:03] be so on fire for God." I tell you what,
[1:32:05] I I'm just watching these people leaving
[1:32:08] the message like drove. Like just off
[1:32:10] the scenes. I said, "It's insanity. I I
[1:32:13] don't understand because if the Bible
[1:32:15] become a new book and the whole book has
[1:32:17] been open.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; I heard someone say the other day,
[1:32:20] brother Ber, they said, "Well, they went
[1:32:23] they actually went to a church, left a
[1:32:24] message." He said, "Well, I don't
[1:32:26] believe just like that, but I believe a
[1:32:28] serpent seed." And I'm like, "That's
[1:32:29] just nonsense."
[1:32:31] You know what? You either believe it
[1:32:33] 100% or you don't. I believe it all the
[1:32:35] way. 100%.
[1:32:38] I'm thankful for it.
[1:32:40] I looked this word up, Kronos. It says
[1:32:43] it's the Greek word is the time. It's
[1:32:44] the minutes and the hours, the days and
[1:32:46] years. But God's in chairos time. The
[1:32:50] Greek word meaning it's it's a moment.
[1:32:52] It's God's season. It's God's appointed
[1:32:54] time. I believe I was thinking about uh
[1:32:56] we just went through 911 again. Like 23
[1:32:59] years has passed since 911. And then you
[1:33:01] have that Charlie Kirk one life 33 years
[1:33:04] old. I thought stand up for God. don't
[1:33:07] even know the message of the hour, but
[1:33:09] stood up for God. Died as a martyr. And
[1:33:11] I thought he redeemed the time. There's
[1:33:14] people going to church. Maybe not a
[1:33:15] message church, but they're going to
[1:33:17] church praying more. And one life said,
[1:33:20] "Lord, let me be that life."
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; I had the greatest truth. Let me redeem
[1:33:26] my time back where young people and
[1:33:28] older people could say, "You know what?
[1:33:30] I want to be on fire like he's got it."
[1:33:34] people buying shirts and this and by God
[1:33:37] people are going to I mean the re ratio
[1:33:39] of people getting back to church blows
[1:33:41] my mind. How about the bride of Christ
[1:33:43] today? How about the bride that I'm
[1:33:45] speaking of today? You might have come
[1:33:47] down and out. You might have barely made
[1:33:49] it to church, but I'm here to tell you
[1:33:51] say, "God, refill me today. Give me some
[1:33:54] more fire." Maybe a mother's down today.
[1:34:02] Oh, I thought about this. Paul urged the
[1:34:04] believers to redeem the time. He says,
[1:34:07] "Because the days are evil." Ephesians
[1:34:08] 5:16.
[1:34:10] He's not just managing hours, but he's
[1:34:12] se he's seizing God's opportunities.
[1:34:15] He's saying, "Hey, you have opportunity
[1:34:16] for God. You have a certain amount of
[1:34:19] time." Every one of us in here are
[1:34:21] allotted a certain amount of time.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; There's people in the hospital today.
[1:34:25] There's babies being born that are on
[1:34:27] incubators. There's babies there's
[1:34:28] babies that are on life support today.
[1:34:30] There's babies that passed away. There's
[1:34:32] young kids that just got hit in a car
[1:34:34] wreck. There we all have an appointed
[1:34:36] time.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; But what are you doing with your time?
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm here to ask you today.
[1:34:45] What are you doing with your time? What
[1:34:48] am I doing with my time? I say, Lord,
[1:34:50] forgive me. Lord, let me redeem my time.
[1:34:53] Luke 2:49.
[1:34:56] And it said unto them, "How is it that
[1:34:58] you be you you you sought you sought me?
[1:35:01] Witz ye not that I must be about my
[1:35:04] father's business." I like that
[1:35:06] scripture because he talks about it
[1:35:07] talks about a time that he should be
[1:35:09] about his father's business. I believe
[1:35:10] that we live in a time that we should be
[1:35:13] about our father's business. We live in
[1:35:15] such an hour that the Russia could pull
[1:35:18] the bomb any day. But aren't you glad
[1:35:20] that we live in a time that God is on
[1:35:22] the inside? And when they push that last
[1:35:24] that before that first bomb drops, the
[1:35:27] bride will be singing farewell,
[1:35:29] farewell, sweet hour of prayer.
[1:35:32] I'm loving it. I'm waiting for his I'm
[1:35:34] looking every day for his coming.
[1:35:36] Brother Ber, I know you are. Every
[1:35:39] single day, every single day, I said,
[1:35:41] Lord, could this be the day? Could this
[1:35:44] be the very hour that my mom walks
[1:35:47] through the door and says, "Boy, what
[1:35:49] you been preaching about? What you been
[1:35:51] living about? Come on, let's go."
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; That's the hour I'm living for.
[1:35:59] That's the hour as I get older, younger,
[1:36:02] younger generation, you'll realize as
[1:36:04] you get older, that's what you live for
[1:36:06] is Jesus Christ alone.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; You can't breathe without him. You can't
[1:36:10] walk without him. You can't go to your
[1:36:12] job without him. You can't pay your
[1:36:14] bills without them.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; You can't pump the gas like we did
[1:36:17] earlier without him.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm thankful that we serve a God
[1:36:22] that cares.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my I thought about
[1:36:29] I thought about this Galatians talking
[1:36:32] about time. Actually, let's turn to
[1:36:34] Psalms 39:4-5 about time. It says that
[1:36:38] it says the Lord make me to know t mine
[1:36:41] end and the measure of my days. He says
[1:36:44] what it is that I may know how def fril
[1:36:47] I am but th how hast made my days as a
[1:36:50] handbreath and my age is as nothing
[1:36:53] before thee.
[1:36:56] Verse uh James 4, turn to James 4. I
[1:37:00] like that it says James 4:14. Where is
[1:37:02] you? You know not what shall be
[1:37:04] tomorrow? For what is your life? We're
[1:37:08] talking about a time. We're talking
[1:37:09] about redeeming the time, young people.
[1:37:11] For what is your life? It is even a
[1:37:13] vapor that appearth for a little while
[1:37:15] and vanished away. I hope Brother Ber
[1:37:17] don't don't get me on this. But I
[1:37:19] thought about that scripture just a
[1:37:21] minute ago and if he could put that on
[1:37:22] the screen, James 4:14. But I thought
[1:37:25] about that back there and as I was
[1:37:26] praying and I thought, you know, for
[1:37:29] what is your life? It says for young
[1:37:31] people it says it's even a vapor but it
[1:37:34] pierced for a little while and vanished
[1:37:36] m I said how can I pure a vapor so I
[1:37:38] thought that's your vapor
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; that's how much your life means in the
[1:37:45] time of choros time but in God's time
[1:37:48] that's young people that's how much time
[1:37:50] we have that I hope this sticks with you
[1:37:53] today more than everything it has that
[1:37:55] that's how much time your life is and it
[1:37:58] becomes a vapor and you don't see it
[1:37:59] anymore more.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you to live that
[1:38:03] vapor of life, to live that life, young
[1:38:06] people, all whatever age you are, to
[1:38:09] live that vapor the best you can.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; May this paper stick with you all. I'm
[1:38:14] going to have to buy him a whole new
[1:38:15] thing of lens cleanser. Sorry, brother,
[1:38:17] but I thought about that's how long your
[1:38:20] life is. I'll mail it to you, brother.
[1:38:23] I'll do Amazon.
[1:38:27] But I thought today, brother Wade,
[1:38:29] that's how long we have of time.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; It's here for a little while and it's
[1:38:34] gone. And you know, we just buried my
[1:38:36] father-in-law that believe this message
[1:38:37] with all his heart. And I thought, we're
[1:38:39] ordering this and they're trying to
[1:38:40] order the grave, the the grave marker.
[1:38:42] They're trying to figure that out. And I
[1:38:44] thought, we got out there and they got
[1:38:45] the little hash mark in between your
[1:38:47] name and it says, "I live from this day
[1:38:50] to this day." Okay, it's a start and a
[1:38:52] finish. But you know what? That's a good
[1:38:55] thing. But I want to know what matters.
[1:38:57] What matters the most is the hash. Is
[1:39:00] what matters the most? What you're doing
[1:39:02] for God now through the years that he
[1:39:04] alllighted you? What are you doing with
[1:39:06] God? Are you leaving a true mark for
[1:39:09] Jesus Christ?
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; With that little dash there, there means
[1:39:14] something went on from this day to this
[1:39:16] day. And I want to say, hey, that man
[1:39:18] loved Jesus Christ with all he's got.
[1:39:20] Hey, Chris fell, but he got back up. He
[1:39:23] failed every He I fall every day. But
[1:39:25] I'm here to tell you, it's about getting
[1:39:27] back up, young people. You make a
[1:39:30] mistake, it's going to happen. Get back
[1:39:32] up.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, forgive me." And move
[1:39:35] forward. Too many times we live like
[1:39:38] we're through the rearview mirror. Like
[1:39:40] brother Bram says, we get ragged up. We
[1:39:42] get ragged up on the side of the road.
[1:39:44] My son just got the the permit and he's
[1:39:46] trying to adjust the windows. Sorry,
[1:39:49] Isaac, but he he's just in this. He's
[1:39:51] just in that. how you adjust this and I
[1:39:54] mean I'm praying I'm saying Lord Jesus
[1:39:56] we hope we make it today
[1:39:59] but he's doing really good but he's
[1:40:00] adjusting this he's just that's how our
[1:40:03] is always adjusting something of us even
[1:40:06] at 43 years old he's saying you know
[1:40:09] what put the phone up and talk to your
[1:40:11] wife do something for God do this talk
[1:40:14] to this person he's always adjusting us
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; that's like when you get on a plane they
[1:40:20] adjust the wings and they're flying in
[1:40:22] and they get through turbulence and they
[1:40:23] adjust them and you know what a lot of
[1:40:25] times they'll adjust them down and
[1:40:26] you'll see you'll start maybe there's a
[1:40:28] pilot in here and they'll adjust them
[1:40:30] and all of a sudden they'll start going
[1:40:31] up and they'll be in a storm and all of
[1:40:34] a sudden all of a sudden you get to
[1:40:36] you'll be in the darkest storm and all
[1:40:37] of a sudden you see just clouds of
[1:40:39] shininess.
[1:40:41] I tell you it would do us some good
[1:40:42] today to get get the darkness out of our
[1:40:45] life and start looking what God
[1:40:47] sometimes we just need to write down
[1:40:48] what God's done for you.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. just take a note. I bet you
[1:40:52] couldn't fill up a page of what God has
[1:40:54] done for you. You would have pages on
[1:40:57] top of pages on top of pages
[1:41:00] of what go how God the goodness of God
[1:41:03] in your life.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; The goodness I pray this is okay this
[1:41:06] morning. But but it would do you some
[1:41:09] good to write down and say God and stop
[1:41:11] using God as a checklist and say, "Well,
[1:41:12] God, I need this today and I need that
[1:41:15] today and I need I've been w I've been
[1:41:17] living in that life. I need this today."
[1:41:19] No. Just tell God how much you love him.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Just tell God. Say when you wake up,
[1:41:24] say, "God, I want to redeem my time
[1:41:26] today. I want to be the best mother. I
[1:41:29] want to be the best father. I want to be
[1:41:31] the best employee. I want to be the best
[1:41:33] boss today. I whatever he tells you to
[1:41:36] be, just be it for him.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Just redeem your time." We live in an
[1:41:41] hour that he's taking our time up. The
[1:41:44] devil is just bomb. I don't know about
[1:41:46] you, but he's bombarding your minds. I
[1:41:48] like Ephesians. if if you could turn
[1:41:50] there. Ephesians how we read that. But I
[1:41:53] flipped over there this morning in
[1:41:54] Ephesians
[1:41:55] 6
[1:41:57] verse 10.
[1:41:59] It says, "Finally, my brethren," this is
[1:42:01] right after we're talking about
[1:42:02] redeeming the time. Chapter 6 10. It
[1:42:05] says, "Finally, my brethren, be strong
[1:42:08] in the Lord."
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown preaches a message, the
[1:42:12] greatest battle ever fought. I just
[1:42:13] wrote that down. He says, uh, "Be strong
[1:42:16] in the Lord in the power of his might.
[1:42:18] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[1:42:20] may able to stand against the ws of the
[1:42:22] devil. He's equipped you today.
[1:42:26] Verse 12, for the wrestle not against
[1:42:28] flesh of blood, but against
[1:42:29] principalities, against powers. Most
[1:42:31] people almost recite this, against the
[1:42:33] rulers of darkness of this world,
[1:42:35] against spiritual witness in high
[1:42:36] places. We have arrived.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; We have arrived in this hour.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Verse 13. Wherefore take ye upon the
[1:42:47] take ye onto the whole armor of God that
[1:42:50] you may able to withstand in this evil
[1:42:51] day. Having done all to stand therefore
[1:42:56] having your lord your loins gird about
[1:42:58] with truth and having on the breath of
[1:43:00] righteousness and your foot shaw with
[1:43:03] the preparations of the gospel of the
[1:43:05] peace. Above all, taking the shield of
[1:43:07] faith, wherein you shall able to quench
[1:43:09] all the fiery darts of the of the
[1:43:12] wicked, and take the helmet of salvation
[1:43:14] with the sword of the spirit, which is
[1:43:17] the word of the God. Aren't you thankful
[1:43:19] that you have the word of God that you
[1:43:21] can defeat the devil anywhere, any
[1:43:23] place, and anyhow,
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; that you don't just have Aren't you
[1:43:28] thankful that you're not in a Baptist
[1:43:29] church today, that you came to church
[1:43:31] today, that the entire book has been
[1:43:34] open?
[1:43:36] I'll tell you, my dad still looks at me
[1:43:38] like, "Son, hey," he called me today. He
[1:43:40] said, "Hey, I want to come visit you and
[1:43:41] the boys." And I, you know, I grew up
[1:43:44] home, a very broke up home. And dad
[1:43:46] said, "Hey, I want to come visit the
[1:43:47] boys. I don't want to go to church, but
[1:43:49] I just want to see the family."
[1:43:51] I said, "Well, I I'm sorry, but I'll be
[1:43:53] in church. You can come visit us, but I
[1:43:55] tell you what, we going to church when
[1:43:57] the doors are open. I don't care if I'm
[1:43:59] speaking or not. I'm going to church. I
[1:44:01] need church. I need to be You know what?
[1:44:04] I need you and you need me. Believe it
[1:44:06] or not, we need we live in an hour and
[1:44:09] we need each other. We need each other
[1:44:11] more than we've ever need each other.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Dad, I tell you what, I'm
[1:44:17] sold out for Jesus Christ." 21 years
[1:44:20] ago, when I saw the message, I said,
[1:44:21] "Lord, this I'm thankful that you
[1:44:24] brought me in."
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; My grandmother, I remember leaving for
[1:44:27] the military. She handed me two books.
[1:44:29] Maybe you've heard this before. She
[1:44:31] handed me Jezebel religion and why we're
[1:44:33] non- denomination.
[1:44:34] I tell you what, brother Ber, I was in
[1:44:36] them barracks in the military. I lit
[1:44:38] that place up. Like I was I'm telling
[1:44:41] you, I was crazy for I said, "Lord, let
[1:44:44] me be on fire in these barracks. Let me
[1:44:46] change a life." I didn't go in there
[1:44:48] shoved the whole message cuz I didn't
[1:44:49] know the whole message. I just come in
[1:44:51] there with love of Jesus Christ.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; I'm tell you one morning, I'll never
[1:44:55] forget the drill sergeants w I'm talking
[1:44:56] about redeeming your time. The drill
[1:44:58] sergeant walked into the room and we had
[1:45:00] Bible study. It was 2:00 in the morning.
[1:45:02] I'll never forget I was in Leonardwood,
[1:45:04] Missouri. I call it Lost in the Woods.
[1:45:07] And we were in Lynwood, Missouri. And
[1:45:09] Brother White, Brother Wade, I was in
[1:45:11] there and we were having Bible study at
[1:45:12] 2:00 in the morning. The drill sergeant
[1:45:14] came by to see what we were doing. We're
[1:45:16] supposed to be asleep. We're having
[1:45:18] revival. I mean, brother, brother, I'm
[1:45:20] just being honest. I redeemed the time.
[1:45:22] I got in there. We were talking about
[1:45:24] God. We were talking about the Bible. I
[1:45:26] was trying to teach about service seed
[1:45:27] and barely knew about serene and I
[1:45:30] started just started eating the word.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; I started young people eating the word.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Read the word and let it become real to
[1:45:38] you.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; And that's when it started becoming real
[1:45:41] to me and I was like I want them to go I
[1:45:43] want them to get what I got.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; And I started eating the word and and
[1:45:48] the drill sergeant walked in. He goes,
[1:45:49] "What are you doing, Mr. Kathy?"
[1:45:53] I said, "We just having church. Is that
[1:45:55] okay? He said, "No, it's not." He said,
[1:45:57] "You know what? Y'all go to bed. You're
[1:45:59] going to do lunges the rest of the
[1:46:00] night."
[1:46:02] And I thought about he he had this he
[1:46:04] had this log. I hope this is okay. He
[1:46:07] had this log and he called it had on the
[1:46:08] side of it was desire. It had written
[1:46:10] desire on it. He said, "You're going to
[1:46:11] become best friends with desire."
[1:46:14] He made me take that log and he said, "I
[1:46:16] want you to walk up and down the hallway
[1:46:19] and I want you to do lunges till the
[1:46:20] morning till you see sunlight."
[1:46:23] I started doing lunges down the hall and
[1:46:25] as I would do one I would just say thank
[1:46:27] you God. Thank you God. And you know
[1:46:30] what? About two hours passed and I
[1:46:33] thought about what God done for me.
[1:46:35] About 2 hours passed I started getting
[1:46:38] really tired and weary and my legs
[1:46:40] started shaking and I wanted to drop the
[1:46:42] log. And then three hours passed and
[1:46:45] four hours pass and I got down to the
[1:46:46] end of the mall and I said, "God, this
[1:46:48] ain't nothing what you done for me. You
[1:46:51] carried a cross on a hill called Galtha.
[1:46:54] You died for my sins. You redeemed me.
[1:47:00] That's what he's done for you. That's
[1:47:02] what he's done for me this morning. He's
[1:47:04] redeemed you today. He's got you from a
[1:47:08] pawn shop out here and pulled you out
[1:47:10] and gave you the light.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Why are you not the happiest people in
[1:47:16] the world? You should be the happiest
[1:47:18] people today. You should be something on
[1:47:20] the inside that says, "I'm happy. I
[1:47:23] don't care what I'm going through. I
[1:47:25] love Jesus Christ."
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; But too many times we wake up and, "Oh,
[1:47:31] well, let's go to church and it's just
[1:47:33] another day." No, it's not another day.
[1:47:36] It could be the very day your
[1:47:37] grandchildren, your children, your
[1:47:39] family gets restored.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; It could be the very day they get filled
[1:47:45] with the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; This could be the various service. This
[1:47:49] could be their last service.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; This could be my last service. But I'm
[1:47:53] here to tell you to redeem your time
[1:47:55] back.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Take back the time. What the devil is
[1:47:59] trying to steal your time, young people.
[1:48:00] He's trying to steal every bit of your
[1:48:02] time. And you know what? He'll steal it
[1:48:05] with chats. Where you on 14 chats? Oh,
[1:48:08] well, Danny, I'm on a chat. What kind of
[1:48:11] chat? Well, it's a church chat. Well,
[1:48:13] they got 12 of them. They don't got one.
[1:48:14] and they got 14 chats and I'll say,
[1:48:17] "Son, when have you read your Bible?
[1:48:19] When have you read? When have you
[1:48:20] prayed?" Same thing with me. I'll get on
[1:48:22] these chats for work and conversations
[1:48:25] and I'll go, "Lord,
[1:48:27] have I forgot you today?
[1:48:31] Redeem your time back. Saints, young
[1:48:34] people, old people, young middle age,
[1:48:36] redeem your time.
[1:48:38] Oh, he's worth it all to us."
[1:48:42] I think Colossians 5, you don't have to
[1:48:43] turn there for time, but Colossians 4:5
[1:48:46] says, "Walk in wisdom toward them that
[1:48:48] with without redeeming the time."
[1:48:50] Talking about redeeming the time.
[1:48:53] Ecclesiastes 3:11, "He hath made
[1:48:55] everything beautiful in his time." And
[1:48:58] also, he has set the world in their
[1:49:00] heart so that no man can find out the
[1:49:02] work that God maketh from the beginning
[1:49:04] to the end.
[1:49:06] John 13:33-35,
[1:49:09] he says, "A new commandment I give unto
[1:49:11] you, that you love one another as I as I
[1:49:15] have loved you, that you also have one
[1:49:18] one love for the other. Be he says, by
[1:49:21] this shall all men know that you are my
[1:49:22] disciples if you have love for one
[1:49:24] another." I tell you what, I tell you, I
[1:49:27] I I say, Lord, give me more love today.
[1:49:30] Fill me today with so much love, Lord,
[1:49:33] that when I go out that when I pass
[1:49:35] somebody like like uh if I even walk by
[1:49:38] somebody, I don't have to say anything,
[1:49:40] they feel the love of God.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; They know that just because I carry a
[1:49:45] message book or I quote the message that
[1:49:47] it's more than just quoting a quote. The
[1:49:49] devil knows the quotes. The devil knows
[1:49:51] the Bible. The devil knows the word
[1:49:53] better than you do. But get the word on
[1:49:55] the inside and let it become a living
[1:49:58] life.
[1:50:01] I tell you what, that's what we need
[1:50:03] today. And I'm here to tell the bride
[1:50:05] today is if I could say anything, I
[1:50:07] would tell you to take the time back
[1:50:08] that go the devil has stolen.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; He's stealing every bit of our time. He
[1:50:13] steals mine every day. But I'm here to
[1:50:16] tell you, I say, "Oh, devil, I'm going
[1:50:17] to take the time back.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to redeem the time."
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; I like what it says here in uh I'll turn
[1:50:27] to it. John John third as I was reading
[1:50:29] 34-35
[1:50:32] another translation says so now I'm
[1:50:34] giving you a new commandment love each
[1:50:36] other just as I have loved you are also
[1:50:40] to love one another your love for for
[1:50:42] one another will prove to the world that
[1:50:44] you are my disciples I said Lord let me
[1:50:47] be let me have so much love that they
[1:50:49] know that I love Jesus Christ
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Matthew 24 1-12
[1:50:56] I love this they can turn it there
[1:50:58] Matthew 24 1-12 as we come down to a
[1:51:00] close he says then Jesus went out and
[1:51:03] departed from the temple and his
[1:51:05] disciples came to him for show show him
[1:51:07] the buildings of the temple and Jesus
[1:51:09] said unto them see ye not all these
[1:51:11] things verily I say unto you there shall
[1:51:14] not be left one here one stone upon
[1:51:17] another and then shall not be thrown
[1:51:20] down verse three and he set upon the
[1:51:24] mount of olives the disciples came unto
[1:51:26] him privately, saying, Tell us, when
[1:51:28] shall these things be, and what shall
[1:51:31] they be sign of thy coming, the end of
[1:51:32] the world? And Jesus answered, said unto
[1:51:34] them, take heed no man deceive you. For
[1:51:37] many shall come in my name, saying, I am
[1:51:40] Christ, and shall deceive many. Verse
[1:51:43] six, and ye shall hear the wars of
[1:51:46] rumors of wars, and you shall not be
[1:51:48] troubled. I believe that's where we're
[1:51:49] here today. For all these things must
[1:51:52] come to pass, but the end is not. For
[1:51:54] nation, listen to this, for nation shall
[1:51:57] rise against a nation, kingdom against
[1:52:00] kingdom, and there shall be famines and
[1:52:01] pestilence and earthquakes and diverse
[1:52:03] places. We're here.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; We have arrived.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; It says, "And all these things are the
[1:52:10] beginning of sorrows. Then shall you
[1:52:12] deliver you up from the afflicted, and
[1:52:14] shall kill you, and you shall be hated
[1:52:16] of all nations for my name's sake." I
[1:52:18] believe we arrived to this.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; These killings and everything. I like
[1:52:23] verse 11. They go to verse 11. It says,
[1:52:25] "And many false prophets shall arise and
[1:52:28] shall deceive many. And because iniquity
[1:52:30] shall abound, the love of many shall wax
[1:52:33] cold. But he that shall endure to the
[1:52:36] end, the same shall be saved." So I'm
[1:52:39] here to tell you, endure to the end.
[1:52:41] Give it all you got. Give everything you
[1:52:43] got for the truth. Give you redeem your
[1:52:46] time back and say, "Lord, I'm brother
[1:52:48] Ber. I'm giving it all I got. I don't
[1:52:51] want to just live a halfway life. I
[1:52:53] don't want to live here and live halfway
[1:52:55] in the world and h No, young people,
[1:52:57] give it all you got.
[1:53:00] Sell out to Jesus Christ. Sell out to
[1:53:03] them to the word of God.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't sell out to it, the
[1:53:08] devil will sell you out to the world.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; And he'll leave you up somewhere. I'm
[1:53:12] telling you what the devil will do,
[1:53:13] young people. He will put you somewhere
[1:53:15] you don't want to be. He'll wreck you up
[1:53:17] somewhere. He'll run over you and laugh
[1:53:18] at you and say, "Guess what? That's
[1:53:20] where you should be." But you know what?
[1:53:22] you you're in the best place you could
[1:53:23] be in today. That's the house of God.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; The house of God. But it says, I like
[1:53:30] what it says in verse 11, and many false
[1:53:32] prophets shall arise. I thought about,
[1:53:34] aren't you thankful that we had arise, a
[1:53:36] prophet that arise that's not false.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; And too many times I I just want to get
[1:53:42] personal with you today. Too many times
[1:53:43] we're on websites and we're redeeming
[1:53:46] our time on nonsense.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; I don't understand it. I don't
[1:53:50] understand why you would go to a church
[1:53:52] website or to a website, not even a
[1:53:54] church website, that that believe the
[1:53:56] sign and do this and do that. Well, you
[1:53:58] know what I The only sign that I believe
[1:54:00] is the one that the prophet took a
[1:54:02] picture of.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Show me one picture I thought about
[1:54:06] this. I thought about there's no other
[1:54:08] places that Jesus took his picture with.
[1:54:12] And people, Brother Ber, people are
[1:54:13] getting on these websites and on these
[1:54:15] things and social media and they're
[1:54:17] taking these people's word. The only
[1:54:19] word I want to take is what God says and
[1:54:21] what this Bible says and what the
[1:54:23] prophet of God has opened the word of
[1:54:25] God to you and me today.
[1:54:33] I would tell you to stay off them
[1:54:34] websites. I would say stay only website
[1:54:37] the only thing you should be in the
[1:54:38] message of the hour and this book every
[1:54:40] day.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; This book I tell you this book will
[1:54:44] become a new book when you take the
[1:54:45] message of the hour and you line it up
[1:54:47] with the word of God. It will it will
[1:54:49] hit the target every time.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Mine's falling apart, but I'm here to
[1:54:53] tell you it's about to fall off the plat
[1:54:55] platform. But I'm here to tell you, I'm
[1:54:57] just tell you, I love my maker more than
[1:54:59] I do more than I did yesterday, more
[1:55:02] than last week because I every single
[1:55:04] day I want to fall in love with him
[1:55:06] again.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; I like what the prophet says as the
[1:55:11] musicians come. He said, "You you asked
[1:55:14] them." He said, "You you talk about it."
[1:55:16] He said, "Well, you got our television.
[1:55:17] and we got our television and that's how
[1:55:20] we find comfort. See, he said, "That's
[1:55:22] the American attitude. See, we got
[1:55:24] television, we got plenty of money." I'm
[1:55:26] like, "Amen." He says, "We got fine
[1:55:28] cars. We got nice houses." He said,
[1:55:30] "What what do we need with the Lord?" He
[1:55:33] said, "What do we need?" He said,
[1:55:34] "That's the attitude."
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; I said, "My the brother of God says
[1:55:40] about the only religion is salvation we
[1:55:42] have and love is amongst the real godly
[1:55:45] people. Yeah.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know, the Bible said that
[1:55:49] would happen." The Bible readers, he
[1:55:52] said, "I heard you holler, "Amen." And
[1:55:54] you preacher back there. He said,
[1:55:55] "That's right." He said, "Love would
[1:55:57] would be so far away in the last days."
[1:56:00] Listen to this. He said, "Love will be
[1:56:02] so far away in the last days. The only
[1:56:05] love there would be left will be between
[1:56:07] the elect of God's people."
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Between the elect. I'm I feel like I'm I
[1:56:13] believe I'm speaking the leg today. He
[1:56:15] said, "The only love left will be
[1:56:17] between the elect of God." I tell you
[1:56:19] what, I love being around believers.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Wade, I love being around,
[1:56:23] Brother Ber. I love being around
[1:56:25] believers. There's something that they
[1:56:27] put off. There's something that the love
[1:56:29] of God is so on the inside. I'm here to
[1:56:32] tell you that's the kind of love you
[1:56:33] want to get. God's love.
[1:56:37] The prophet go go goes on to say he said
[1:56:39] oh bless the eternal God who in the
[1:56:41] message called love he said oh bless the
[1:56:43] eternal God who brought again the lord
[1:56:45] from the dead he has now pres presented
[1:56:48] us to us after 1900 years yet alive and
[1:56:52] just as sufficient in his power and his
[1:56:55] presence as he was 1900 years ago when
[1:56:58] he walked in the Galilee
[1:57:00] and we thank thee oh father because thou
[1:57:02] has done it to us done for us he said in
[1:57:05] this dark evil day that We're living
[1:57:07] when there is so much confusion on every
[1:57:10] hand among the world. I'm like, "Amen,
[1:57:12] brother." And in the nations, and
[1:57:14] politics, and every walk of life, the
[1:57:16] prophet of God says, "Even to the
[1:57:18] Christian walk, yet there is confusion."
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Then he goes on to say, he says, "But we
[1:57:26] are so glad to know that Jesus still
[1:57:28] lives."
[1:57:30] Oh, he says, "And as the scripture has
[1:57:32] said unto him, the same yesterday,
[1:57:34] today, and forever, and when we see the
[1:57:37] end of approaching rapidly," he said,
[1:57:40] "the signs of his near coming, our
[1:57:42] hearts jump for joy." He said, "We rest
[1:57:45] upon the blessed promise that he is the
[1:57:48] same and that he loves us and he gave
[1:57:50] himself for us."
[1:57:53] He said, "Our hearts jump for joy." I'm
[1:57:55] here to tell you when I see the signs in
[1:57:57] the Russia and Ukraine and I tell you it
[1:58:00] made I'm excited. People look at me at
[1:58:02] work and they're like, "Chris, you
[1:58:04] crazy." You know, I'm scared to death.
[1:58:06] There ain't nothing to be scared about
[1:58:07] when you're in Jesus Christ.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; There ain't, as the prophet would say,
[1:58:11] there ain't no bomb shelter that will
[1:58:13] cover you. There won't be nothing to
[1:58:15] cover you but the grace of God
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; and the God that's on the inside.
[1:58:20] as they pay something softly this
[1:58:22] morning
[1:58:24] as we come down to a close about
[1:58:26] redeeming the time.
[1:58:30] Maybe all heads bowed just for a few
[1:58:32] minutes.
[1:58:35] Maybe there's someone today
[1:58:38] that will step out and say, "Lord, I
[1:58:41] I've been this. I've been that way."
[1:58:44] Just say, "Lord, I want to redeem the
[1:58:46] time back.
[1:58:48] [Music]
[1:58:51] just one person. It didn't matter who it
[1:58:53] is. No one looking around. You can do it
[1:58:55] in your seat. You can The altar's open.
[1:58:58] Whatever.
[1:59:00] Say, "Lord, I want to redeem the time
[1:59:02] back
[1:59:04] from my phone, from social media,
[1:59:06] whatever it may be that's taking your
[1:59:07] time.
[1:59:10] Say, Lord, I want to redeem my time to
[1:59:12] give it more to you."
[1:59:15] Oh, hands everywhere, Lord. Bless them,
[1:59:17] Lord. My hands up, Lord. I say, redeem
[1:59:20] the time in my life.
[1:59:23] Let me be more like you, Lord. Maybe
[1:59:26] there's someone online today. Say, "I
[1:59:28] want to redeem the time, Lord. Maybe
[1:59:30] they couldn't make it to church today.
[1:59:32] May you bless their hearts.
[1:59:34] May you touch them where they're at. May
[1:59:36] where they're sitting. Father,
[1:59:39] may these young people, may you just
[1:59:41] cover a shield of protection around
[1:59:42] them, Lord, where they would get the
[1:59:45] Holy Ghost, Lord.
[1:59:47] Oh, may you fill them today, Lord.
[1:59:49] Whatever their whatever their requests
[1:59:51] are, all these hands, Lord, may you
[1:59:53] touch every one of them this morning. We
[1:59:56] love you, Father. May you restore us.
[2:00:00] May you just put a zeal in our heart to
[2:00:02] be on fire for you, Lord. Bless your
[2:00:05] people today.
[2:00:07] We love you, Father. We give you today.
[2:00:09] We give you our lives. We surrender
[2:00:12] everything to you, Lord. Bless Brother
[2:00:14] Ber and your saints today. in Jesus
[2:00:17] Christ's name.
