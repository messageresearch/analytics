I'm gonna read a little bit out of Psalms 119 here we're gonna start in verse 17 and we'll read to verse 32 there the old Bountiful with thy servant that I may live and keep thy word eyes I'm a stranger in the earth hide not thy Commandments from me God has tribute the proud that are cursed which do air from thy Commandments go forward princess also didn't sit and speak against me but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes I sold cleaveeth unto the dust quickened thou me according to Thy Word make me to understand the way of thy precept so shall I talk to thy one of thy wondrous works remove from me the way of lying and Grant me thy law graciously I am stuck unto thy testimonies O Lord put me not to shame I will ruin the way of thy Commandments when thou shalt enlarge my heart God bless you may be seated brother Brian foreign brothers and sisters no I was that those first couple of words as we were reading in 17 I was thinking my mind if you want to another Psalm that goes to the from the 17th to the 24th you would go back to the first psalm kind of hits the same subjects again I was that quote up there this morning from uh Thursday yeah that's where we have to be at this morning that no matter who we are or what we where we're at to put the word of God first and not be afraid of what people might say about you no I was just thinking there which can be a dangerous thing I'm going to say I was thinking this world we live in everybody's running after the shiny thing now you're not satisfied in their hearts not satisfied in their lives they're just running after every shiny thing that's thrown before them but it should be that way for a Christian the only thing a Christian's concerned about is where he is in the word of God at that any given time and you have an answer in the word of God you don't have to run after all those shiny things you see out in the world and as I see the years go by I see that Satan and the world just keeps putting more shiny things out there for people to run after not that some of the things that we do in the world are bad it's just they God wants you to be totally focused on him he doesn't want you running after every little thing out there in the world and some times we forget we have and I was as we're reading the Psalms I was thinking about David and some of the other people that wrote These Psalms they knew the word of God but they were humble before the word of God David is always saying I need to learn more there's more that God can give me there's more that I need to know I'm not complete I'm always learning and striving to be better than what I was the day before in the scriptures but if you would go with me to uh Corinthian uh no Galatians this second chapter before I get started uh I mentioned last week that the two things left to do for the church the finish the year money wise other than any emergencies I've taken care of the pre prepaid for the year I prepaid another 1500 gallons of fuel that bring us into the new year and uh that's enough to get us that's enough to get us probably to February or March and I got the insurance for the uh upcoming year in uh yesterday in the mail and I was a little concerned because we did make a claim this year but Lord blessed us our insurance payment for the year this year is the same as it was last year so it didn't change making that claim didn't change the amount of insurance we have to make so I paid 3 600 I had to pay for the summer Phil uh which was right around thirty six hundred dollars and change that include what they put in in August and that's paying for 1500 gallons that was thirty six hundred dollars and change and the insurance for the next coming year is uh about 3 800 so that's uh and we have more than enough money in the general fund to cover that without hurting the general fund so I thought I'd let you know but going to this jumping to the second chapter of Colossians here you know I was thinking this morning in that that quote keeps coming up thirsting for the word of God and everything that we do and I'll just read in a in cautions the second chapter and in First Peter the first chapter uh Peter and Paul are saying pretty much saying the same thing each started the ministry but I'll just read what this has to say uh this morning or wood that you would know with great conflict that I have for you and for them at lateral Seer for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh so Paul Paul saying he knows what he's writing here not everyone will ever hear Paul speak well you know never see Paul but he's writing things in this epistle that'll go for generations to come and he's setting everything in order here and he goes my face that their hearts might be come from being knit together and love onto all the riches of the full assurance of the understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ and this goes about what brother Branham taught us about the godhead and then he goes on to say in whom are HID all the treasures and wisdom and knowledge but you all have a you guys are all of us are pretty lucky this morning we have a message for the hour that you have the reveal a word that you can look at the scriptures and you know where you stand in the word of God this morning and he goes on to saying humor hid all the treasures and wisdoms and knowledge and this I say at least any man should beguile you with enticing words and that goes back to what I was saying earlier the world is full of shiny things and those shiny things are to beguile you and they take you away from the word of God this morning and he goes on to say for though I am absent in the flesh yet I am with you in the spirit joining and beholding your order and you said your faith in Christ as you have therefore received Christ Jesus as the Lord so walk ye in him and that's the same for us this morning as God Reveals His word to you this morning as he reveals the message of the hour this morning you're obligated to walk in yet I know that sounds legalistic I don't mean it that way as God gives you more truth it gives you more presence of his spirit in your life more is going to be required of you as you walk and he goes on to say booted and built up in him the steps in faith as you have been taught abounding therein for Thanksgiving beware at least any man spoil through philosophy vain deceit after traditions of men after the removing itself the world and not after Christ that goes what I was saying about them shiny things you know you've got to be careful with what you're listening to and what you put your heart in sometimes it can be the wrong thing for all all for in him dwell with all the fullness of the godhead bodily and you are complete in him which is the head of all Prince priorities and Powers so there's nothing out there in the world that's going to make you any better but this word of God and his Spirit In Your Heart life is going to make you better that's the only thing that's going to make you better in whom you also are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands and putting off the body of sins of Flesh by circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism with him through faith and the operation of God who hath from the dead and and I'll just read these last two scriptures here and being dead and being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh how he quickened together with him having forgiven all your trespasses and the most important one here blotting out the handwriting of ordinance that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and then I'm going to read another one I know I do this all the time and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made her show them openly trying to let them over them and excuse me for my pronunciation I was going to jump back here to Matthew if I didn't lose my place here I thought I had it more you know sometimes things happen you never know why I'll just I lost my place there and I don't want to say something that I'm not sure about but you know all of us this morning as we strive for life there's only one goal that we should have and that is to be in Christ as his child as a son and daughter of God willing and able to be able to listen to the spirit of Christ as it leads to guide you in the day that we live in and outside of the word of God we're all lost we're hopeless people with outside of the word of God for the hour that we live in this morning it doesn't make us better than anyone else does it make it us more important than anyone else just makes us simple Christians simple Believers in the word of God this morning and uh I'll read this chapter this first chapter of Peter this morning and uh Peter and the Apostle of Jesus Christ to the stranger scattered throughout pontus galathea I've given my pronunciation of tapioca Asia and bifnia elect according to the foreknowledge of God and the father for sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiple and that's all the men of God in the New and Old Testament they always put God's peace and Grace upon the people when they speak to him and blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy have forgotten us again unto our livelihood by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance and corruptible and undefiled that you fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are you are kept by the power of God through Strife onto salvation to be ready to revealed last time we're in greatly rejoicing now for you for our season if need be even heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perish though would be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearance of Jesus Christ and I'll just finish with that this morning I don't have a lot to say but I you know you that quote that was up there earlier than this morning that was traveling through one about healing if you're not willing to testify to people about what God has done for you both in the physical and the spiritual sense that then what are you if you're not willing to take the word of God and apply it to your life whatever that situation is and walk in it then what are you that that's what that quote talks about are you are you uh are you a hidden Christian are you a visible Christian that's it's just where we're at do people know you're a Christian or when people ask about your do they know what you really are but you're the people you brought up against in the world do they know that you're a Christian or do they have to look at you sometimes the name Sammy to see what you are that's what we want people to know who we are and what we are I mean I do I fall short I I know I fall short sometimes as I get older like I said I've got to watch I I have the same disease my father had when they when he got older I tend to get angry for no reason to get angry and that's not right so I have to watch in my own self as I get older the things that are not right in my own life so the only thing I would say this morning we just need to be I guess the simplest thing to say was you don't need a lot of understanding and we just need to be better something Daughters of God we need to be better Christians and not running after everything that doesn't that won't be there on my day you know we all have to work we all have to provide for our families you know that's that's a given we all have to do that but that not shouldn't you know I have raised my hand here that shouldn't be the only thing I live to do is to work either you should live for to serve Jesus Christ this morning if uh brother Josh will come thank you I met us down this

infection and he's going to be fine I think but you're stuck with me this morning and this evening so you got the spare tire I apologize for that but we'll do the best we can do if you would turn with me in your Bibles I will go into the Book of Joshua again Joshua chapter 3. I want to read you this quote as you're turning there and just think about the words of the Prophet here he says give me a preacher give me a Christian Listen Now give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer or a factory worker that will put God first in everything and I'll show you a man that will be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him we can go home now Joshua chapter three let's let's read and we're going to talk today and I've got a goal in mind for the day we'll see how the Lord leads but I've got a goal to accomplish two things we're going to get Joshua across that River and we're going to tear those walls down before the day's over okay we've been here for a while and uh I love the history of it and I hope I don't bore you with the history and the and the uh facts of the of what happened but we just love the word of God Joshua chapter 3 we'll read all this chapter and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from scheidom and came to the Jordan he and all the children of Israel and Lodge there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when ye see the ark we gotta learn to keep God first when ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priest the Levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2 000 cubits by measure that's about a half a mile okay so now this Ark that is normally hidden I want you to remember three things about it now everybody can see it now everybody can see the ark and and and and looking at it normally it's on the inside but now it's out in view for everybody to see and follow this Ark and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders amongst you and Joshua spoken to the priest saying take up the Ark of the Covenant and pass over before the people and they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people and the Lord said unto Joshua this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all of Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee and I believe brothers and sisters that we're living in the day and in the hour to where when God is looking down there and he's looking at us and he's saying I'm going to magnify you as the Bride of Jesus Christ so that the whole entire world will recognize and realize who you are do you know who you are and thou shalt command the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant saying when you come to the brink of the water you shall stand still in Jordan and Joshua said unto the children of Israel come hither and hear the words of the Lord and Joshua said hereby you shall know that the Living God is amongst you can you say Amen the Living God is amongst you and he will without or let me back up and that he will without fail drive out from you the Canaanites the Hittites the he bites the parasites parasites whatever you want to call them sicknesses doubt frustrations fears are you with me habits slothfulness enemies that look so great and so big before us he said I will drive all of those out verse 11 behold the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth passeth before over before you into Jordan now therefore take you 12 men out of the tribes of Israel out of every tribe of man and this shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the Ark of the Lord the Lord of all the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan aren't you thankful that you got a resting place they shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the Waters of the Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon a heap we're going to get into the details of this but that sentence right there is quite an amazing statement when you research it out and we'll see it in a minute and it came to pass that when the people removed from their tents to pass over Jordan the priests bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and as they bear the ark we're coming to the Jordan and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for the Jordan overflowed all its banks all the time at the time of harvest that the waters which came down from above this is about 20 miles up above where all this water starts pouring in okay came down from above and stood and Rose upon a heap very far from the city of Adam and this is beside Zartan and those that came toward the Sea of the plain and even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed right over against Jericho and the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground um in the midst of the Jordan and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over Jordan so I want to continue our thoughts on Kingdom Builders this morning and looking at Joshua I want to speak on mission impossible mission impossible let's pray Heavenly Father we come before you this morning with grateful hearts and thankful for the opportunity we have to come and gather into your house and hear the word of God and and just to be able to read your scriptures knowing that they're they're true and infallible and there's there's life in the word itself Lord and we're thankful for that Lord we just ask as we look at this little thought and topic that you would just Quicken it to our hearts allow me to get myself out of the way that you could pull the words that's on paper into a living form this morning that it would strike into our hearts in a way that would just give us overcoming power that we could see ourselves in the word this morning we can see ourselves in the scripture that we are Overcomers we're more than able we're more than conquerors through Christ we just want to tell you we love you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen you can have your seeds the prophet says every one of them come out from under the pillar of fire they come out of the Wilderness believing God they march on but when they come to see the obstacle when they came to see the obstacle that's when the ten came back and said we can't take the land oh my there's Giants there there's this and that and the other we just can't do it it's impossible so in their eyes these Ten Men of God Ten Men of the tribes of the children of Israel and their minds they begin to look at this and they say this is a mission that's impossible it can't happen they look there and they peered over the river and they seen a city about a city of about eight or nine acres and then this city is double walls and I gotta paint this picture for you because it's quite amazing it's a double walled City that sets up on a knob and you come up to the First wall and that first wall that you come to is about 23 feet high and from that wall the ground Terraces up into the next wall and this double walled city was supposed to be fortified so that it's impenetrable and that second wall as it goes up grows to the height the whopping astounding height of 46 feet 46 feet a lot of times we don't hear that we don't paint that picture we just know that there was a wall this was a fortress this was a impenetrable Fortress that they're coming up against and they're sitting there and these guys are looking and said this is impossible but the prophet said what did Caleb and Joshua do they stealed the people and they said no no we are more than able to take this he said it was because those people were looking at what they could see they were looking with their eyes at what they could see and what they could look out there and touch but Caleb and Joshua was looking at more they were looking at the promise of God and God said I have given you this land go get it it's all in the perspective that you're looking through others and sisters God is looking for more joshuas and more calebs in this hour that we're living in he's looking for a group of Believers That Could See Beyond the obstacles that are set before them he's looking for a group of people that can come up to the river and say hey there's something for me on the other side of this River he's looking for people that not only sees what's on the other side but believes they can possess it we're gonna have ownership of what God has given us and what God has promised us he's got to have people who can see beyond defeat and doubt and fear let me add in our cancer and sugar diabetes and seizures and heart issues he's going to have people that can see beyond those and say God gave me a promise you know sometimes in life the river just looks wide right the tumor looks too big the heart issue looks too detrimental the daughter looks impossible your fear your doubts it gets big and it's wide and you think there is no way that I can ever ever get across that but that is when God steps in and proves himself that's when God moves into the scene and I want you to remember this morning that the greater the battle is the greater the victory you say I I can overcome this and I can overcome that praise God but when that battle is so big and so huge that the people around you says there's no way he'll ever get through it there's no way she'll ever overcome that there's no way God can move on the scene that's when you can step back and say praise God he got me through and you can begin to worship and praise and give Glory and Honor it's a good Almighty who Gets You Through The River everyone the more we overcome the more glory god gets I feel pretty good now we see here that he lived the children of Israel out of Egypt under what was a strong hand of rulership he under a man who was a tyrant he let him out of a man who was a tyrant and a Tormentor of God's Own people and he leads them out of there and we see that Moses at that time he served his Nation for 80 years Moses serving the children of Israel this faithful servant but now Joshua has stepped onto the scene Joshua has now stepped on the Saint Joshua and Caleb were the two slaves in Egypt do you realize that they were the two remaining members of the original ones that come out of Egypt and for 40 years Joshua serves as Moses great military general for 40 years he's provided safety and protection for the people for 40 years Joshua was loyal and devoted and a real friend and and took mentorship from Moses and although his call may not have been profound as others Joshua here steps in here and he is God's choice to lead the children of Israel into the Promised Land brothers or sisters to the world we may not look like much to the world they may laugh at us to the world they may not understand what we're so happy about to the world they may understand why we preach the way we preach to the world they might not understand the why we shout the way we shout but I'll tell you this I know what I'm shouting about because God has done something for each and every one of us set in here in this day you are the one in a million the Bride of Jesus Christ brothers and sisters is coming into view she is coming into view as she sees her vision beyond the river Brown says a man that is born of God this is the way it may get a little sticky for a minute but it's good for us a man that is born of God a Son of God has to have the nature of God he has to be like God he honors God he is part of the word of God and in this last days taking form just exactly the same power that he was and at the beginning has come up through these organizations and so forth and come out for the bride and he can't be nothing else but that you're one in a million group of people and you know people get people get a little bit standoffish when we say that well you think you're better than everybody you think you're more you think you you think you live better you think your life is cleaner I'll tell you this I don't think that but I'll tell you what I know I know that a born-again Christian will despise the things that God despises a born-again Christian will despise everything that is evil in the sight of God a born-again Christian will love everything that God loves and when I say that I want to make I want to give yourself an example of what I'm trying to get across to you if you just you're born again Christian despises the things that God despises build as far as nicotine they'll despise alcohol that was fires drugs they'll despise pornography they'll describe the despise filth what about a person who's hung up on those things I didn't say that you wasn't a born-again Christian but I said you will despise it you may have to battle those things you may that may be your river that you're coming up to that may be your Jordan but if you live around that Jordan long enough it'll make you so sick of it it'll make you so miserable and it'll make you hate that thing so much that you'll say God deliver me I need Deliverance I need to walk across the Jordan River this morning it doesn't make us better it doesn't make us uh above anybody but it says that there is such a love in the hearts of those people that they do not want to hurt their God they don't want to hurt the love of their life there's a lady sitting right here I would do nothing to hurt the love of my life have I made mistakes you better believe it has she want to choke me more than once but it wasn't intentional did she forgive me you better believe she did she still cooks for me if you can't tell I love her the Bride of Jesus Christ loves Jesus Christ you're built to overcome brothers and sisters the Bride of Jesus Christ can't be nothing but Overcomers they can't be nothing but Overcomers because she sees further than the obstacle that's placed in front of her and her goal is to finish what she starts you know Paul says it's not the one who starts the race but it's the one who finishes the race and so here we are this morning we ought to make sure that we're the ones that are finished in the race you know over 2 million Israelites left Egypt over 2 million Israelites started out on that race from Egypt they were running can you imagine as as that red sea part that they ran across there they sang They danced they shouted they played tambourines two two went into the Promised Land they couldn't finish the race that they've started and the prophet tells us he said they should have seen it the Jews and their days they should have seen it because it was all manifested in front of them but then God looks at him and says they're everyone dead I don't want God to look down at this assembly or any assembly around this world and say look at them they started out to try to win this race and they had a lot of fire and Thurber when they started but look at them they're all dead now and I think it's something when the prophet talks about one in a million or two coming out of two million with Caleb and Joshua but it's an amazing thing that he he he ties this to the Natural conception of human life think about it the natural conception of human life you have an egg in the female you're gonna get a little scientific here so bear with me you've heard it before he mentions this so it's nothing nothing heard before you have an egg and then a female and that egg is a receptor and then the male discharges life by the Millions [Music] of the millions did you hear what I said and one fights until he gets to the egg Millions science has been able to put it in video and it's an amazing thing to watch as the germs sail the sperm and the germ cell it's life it lives its fight it's battle it's going through the mucous membranes to get to that egg and it's fighting all the way to get there what is it there's something on the inside that says I gotta live there's something on the inside of you that said You Gotta live you fall from the very day of conception to be where you're at this morning so don't tell me you're not special don't tell me you're not wanting a million you're a miracle setting here today the prophet said himself he said because there's something someone made this one fertile and ordained this one and he predestination by predestination my brother sure God has determined I like this because it dispels the boy girl thing God has to determine whether you're going to be a boy or a girl God has to determine whether you're going to be a redhead or a blackhead or whatever it is it's determined by God he said it's more of a mystery than the Virgin birth to me wow what don't you love science I love science when it proves God's word there were two million to come out sung and shouted and done everything he said spoken tongues they shouted they give God glory danced up and down the sea and done everything that all the rest of them did but there were only two that went into that Promised Land Caleb and Joshua that's the one out of a million that's the one out of a million in natural birth every one of them had the same blessings that's not good enough just to hang out around Church it's not good enough just to say you go to this church or this is your pastor or that's your pastor or this or I go to this meeting every year that's not good enough there has to be something on the inside brothers and sisters when Moses sent the spies over sent one out of every tribe you know and they come back and out of their own mouth they testified this is a good land how many of us this morning say this is a good message [Applause] God's promises are good in my life you're testifying with the mouth they testified with their own mouth but then they couldn't be content with that but then they had to look through their eyes and they said oh mercy oh mercy we can't take it oh my God the amorites are there they make us look like grasshoppers beside them they're Mighty Men they're army men they're military men their their walls are big and they're huge I wish I'd have just died down in Egypt can you imagine can you imagine after all they had seen God do think back about the plagues think back about the the blood token over the door and the Death Angel passing through and not a single soul of the Israelites under that token was harmed not a single one and they've seen all of this but yet here they look back and they say the walls are two big but Joshua and Caleb he says they jumped up and quieted them and said we're more than able yes sir there's the one he said now look what happened Joshua and Caleb knew that God gave the promise he said I don't care how big it is how much the obstacles are how high they are how great they are he said that don't have nothing to do with it you know sometimes we blow things up and when we realize we're just really just a really small portion of dust of what God has done in this universe we make our problems so big and think he can't handle them he said God said so and we can take it he said do you know that there were only two people like that only out of two and a half million that ever crossed into the promised land because they held their faith and what God Said was the truth we have to find ourselves in this day we have to have ourselves holding on to the promises of God holding on to the promises it says I can be healed hold on to the promises it says I can be delivered hold on to the promises it says I can get by these obstacles God cares about my well-being God cares about me making a rapture that's exactly right and Joshua comes up to his first major task he comes up to his first major task of Crossing this Jordan Crossing the Jordan River which signifies leaving behind my old life the children Israel come up there and Joshua can you imagine him preaching this is it guys this is what we've dreamed of this is what we've longed for this is what God has promised us look over there it's soon to be ours can you imagine as he looks out there and he says today we're going to leave everything that's holding us back everything that's hindering us everything that's making us sick and depressed and sad we're leaving all of that back behind us the past is the past and today's a new life but as he preached those words they had to realize that there had to be a full commitment to this promise there's a commitment that had to be made to cross the Jordan River this River brothers and sisters was out of its banks it was in the Harvest Time of the Year let me let me break this down for you think about it this way here's another Red Sea situation do you know how long it was between the Red Sea and the crossing of the Jordan see anybody want a venture to throw a number out there it floored me 11 days 11 days less than two weeks ago they saw Moses Stan with his arms up and the winds blowing from the East and separate the Red Sea so that they could walk across on dry land and watch the Seas consume pharaoh and all of his armies 11 days you say how you know it's 11 days it was an 11 day Journey from where they was when I crossed the Red Sea to the Jordan River but because of what they saw on the other side of the Jordan River they wandered for 40 years can you imagine Joshua can you imagine the commitment and the dedication that he had to have in his life to come up to their first of all to be one of the spies that goes in and says we can do this Brothers we can do this and then they leave and cross the Red Sea and they walk up to the Jordan and he's thinking marching up let's keep going everybody says no no we got to stop they're too big and for two years he lived by the law and for 38 more they wandered what did they do while they were wandering they were blessed so don't always think that your blessings it's fresh now don't think that your blessings are always what it means that you're one of them that you're the chosen that you're committed and you've dedicated you make sure that your heart is right you make sure that you've committed to yourself deep down on the inside this says I'm one of gods and I want failing I won't let down I'll keep pressing on when the battle gets rough I'm Gonna Keep marching forward 11 days 40 years they're going to need a supernatural intervention because this River has come out of its banks this River has come out of its banks and its rivers now what's normally a hundred feet wide and maybe 10 to 30 feet deep is now over a mile wide and rivers and Waters are running in from the upper upper part from the north lands are just flooding into this and now a mile wide river stands before them oh you know it usually wouldn't have presented itself as a problem we got things in our life that don't really present us a problem do they I don't have a problem smoking I don't have a problem drinking I don't have a problem cussing I don't have a problem chasing women I don't have a problem doing all those things at one time they come up to this River and sit there for 40 years looking at this river that was a hundred foot wide wasn't really a big problem they could have probably took it but God wanted to show he's God God wanted to show he's God so he said down there and he began to do things in such a way that only God can do God sets us River in motion allows it to back up for 20 miles of my wife just so that man can't take credit for what he's about to do if you're taking credit for something in your life um is God in it because I can do nothing on my own you can do nothing on your own everything you have everything that you've been given everything that you know that that God has given you it's God's done it God's Made A Way God's blessed your business God bless your home God bless your children God save your children God saved your life [Applause] if I could save children I would save everyone to ever come in contact with nobody wants to send anybody lost but it's God that has to do the saving so God now has placed a river in their way and this Jordan River is swelled up and it's wide and wider than it normally is and nobody could cross this River on their own and brothers and sisters sometimes we have to face a swollen River has anybody ever faced a swollen River [Applause] we go through things in our lives that you think is going to bury you you go through hardships in your life that'll take you to your knees not in prayer but in and discouragement and depression and fear and in doubt you let the doctor tell you you got six months to live you let the doctor tell you if you'd like brother Tommy if you do too much exertion you're a dead man those are swollen Rivers you get a phone call in the middle of night that something's happened to your family that's a swollen River you want your children as they go astray you talk about a swollen River that's a swollen River and you ask yourself how am I going to get across it you won't you won't in yourself but I know a god I know a god who's able to dry up the Red Sea he's able to dry up the River Jordan he's able to allow you to walk across on dry land if you'll just do what he asks you to do I don't know what kind of obstacles you're facing in your life this morning some of you I know you're going through things some of you has got challenges some of you has got doctors that pronounce things on you that you don't agree with and you don't want to accept don't accept it look across the river and say my God is able my God's a healing my God's a deliverer my God crosses Rivers this morning I'm looking at the the children of Israel we begin to look at this account there and I thought you know the very same thing that allowed them to get across that River three thousand years ago is the very same thing that allows me to get across my Rivers today it didn't change God didn't change the way he does things God don't change nothing about his program if he could do it for them he can do it for me if he does it for me he can do it for you that's the way God works brother Brown said something about it hallelujah what is it he says there is a deep calling out to that deep and we hear this quote and use this quote a lot he said but there's a hunger in that human heart to move out and do something for God he said I've seen Joshua and he's standing there I seen Joshua and he's standing there and he says how's he going to get a cross this River he said look there was no Bridges there was no arches there was no steel there was no materials there's no wood because that's the way we are as humans right no doubt Joshua looked there and thought man can we float across this can I build a build a dam back here here and try to try to get the people enough shallow water we can swim across this what can we do how can we do this any carpenters in here your Builders you're gonna try to figure out a way across that River and no doubt he was there but there was no materials nothing like that for him to get across nothing but the muddy swollen Jordan River and he said he looked back there and he seen tens of thousands and thousands of Jews and he's looking there at this River and he's looking back at his congregation and he's looking at this River and he looks at his congregation and he says you know what God Will Make A Way that was all the word that he had to give to his congregation God Will Make A Way I don't know how he's going to do it I don't know when he's going to do it but when the word comes we will go to church hold on to the prom ISE he said and if God promises it God will keep his word he said if God promises to heal you he'll do it was it muddy walking up to that River do you still feel the symptoms sometimes maybe you're treating in a little bit of mud as you're coming up to the river maybe you can feel it it's holding you back you're getting stuck you're getting deeper and deeper but if God promised it he'll do it if God promises to give you the Holy Ghost he'll do it he said if you'll just come and repent and be baptized and believe in him and Watch What Happens he'll fill you with the Holy Ghost because God God is obligated obligated to his word he can't take his word back he's got to keep his word in order to be God if God would have brought them up to that Jordan River after he had told them for 40 some odd years you're going to go across it and then he looks and said you know what I don't I don't think it's possible Joshua you know what that would have made God a liar God can't be a liar it's Satan that's the LIE it's Satan the one that tells you all these things and places all these obstacles in your path but God says don't listen to the lies listen to The Promise listen to what I told you listen to what I could do and Trust in what I can do that was the assurance that Joshua had been given by God almighty listen to the word Joshua received four Commandments trying to hurry commandment number one cross over this Jordan in other words this is your task cross over this Jordan the next one was to be strong and very courageous this is your attitude I don't recall him ever saying uh walking weakness cow down to the enemy listen to the liar I don't ever recall that being the attitude no he said be strong and courageous Joshua here's the attitude you must have and when you go over there divide the people their inheritance this is your destiny this is your destiny this is your god-given rights your god-given lands your god-given possessions God has divvied out to the bride of Christ who she is the word of God was given to us you talking about an inheritance you're talking about a possession you're talking about something that you can hold on to when the message of the hour broke and the Word was revealed to you one in a million because other command was obey God's Commandments completely this is a challenge you know sometimes it's a it's hard to obey God's word completely oh y'all quiet it's hard to obey vague word completely but Joshua stood there and he stayed with his message he stayed with what was told before him who did the original word come to Moses right Moses is the one who was originally was told about the promised land and told about the promise and told about the inheritance but Moses now is dead and Joshua was sitting there and Joshua now has this promise and it's his promise now he's holding on to the promise and the three promises were given to him that no one will be able to stand before you you know sometimes as Believers we we back away from situations we back away from situations when all we got to do is rely on God's strength we back away because we get scared we let fear consume us we let doubt we let anxiety sure I'll tell my wife the other day I said you know what I used to love scuba diving and it says no this is not a spiritual thing but just just take the the analogy here I used to love to go scuba diving but it scared me I couldn't do it I I get down to 105 feet under water and the first thing goes to my mind if this tank runs out I'm dead I can't get back to the surface quick enough and if I do my my brains are gonna blow up wow you know that's what I'm thinking at 105 feet down there trying to scoop it up has anybody ever done it Austin has Adriana has right no she said now now but if we allow fears to come and consume us we allow the enemy to win one over on us speaking spiritually if you allow Satan to tell you that you're not going to make a Rapture you're allowing fear to come into your life speaking spiritually if you let Satan tell you that your children are not going to make it that they're going off on astray and you didn't teach them correctly you've allowed fear and doubt to come into your life when the promise is all that that you that has served me will be given raise a child up in the way and they shall not stray you're doing that right that's a promise that's a that's a written word and commandment of God raise a child up in the way that they should go and they will not depart from it as they grow old do you believe that promise why do we cry well we're going to move on Joshua's standing here now in this Valley of decision and they're here to this point of the journey and up to this time they had relied completely on Moses they complained as they followed they listened to the voice of Moses they followed Moses they followed a cloud my day in a pillar Fire by night they had Manna they had Quail when they hungry they ate when they were thirsty they drink they had everything that they could possibly want their clothes weren't even worn or tattered after 40 years can you imagine wearing what you're wearing today 40 years from now that's a pretty powerful God in itself their clothes weren't torn or tattered they lived as children without responsibility and you know that's what a lot of people around the message try to do they try to live as children without responsibility they want to be in the message they want to be in the bride they want to be in God's program but they don't want the responsibility that it takes to live it Moses had gently led him along Moses had prayed for him he wept over him he carried them all in his heart and pampered and pet him but now Joshua's on the scene this is a different kind of guy Joshua is a different kind of leader he's a different kind of character and Joshua is moving in a New Direction and he's telling the children of Israel the days of being passive the days of being soft the days of giving in to the enemy they're over did you hear what I said the days of being passive and giving in and giving over to the enemy they're over and brothers and sisters Joshua knows that if Israel is going to possess the land they must be aggressive and deliberate and be willing to fight and take it because it's yours go get it and so here they are now and they they're coming up to this Raging Waters of the Jordan for three days isn't that something how it's three days did you ever think about that three days and he rose three days standing there looking at this water three days the waters are raging some of these people probably were gripped by fear some of them are probably sitting there trying to decide are we are we going across and Joshua says don't talk that way [Applause] don't talk that way this is ours but but I don't want to hear no butts you ever you ever do your kids that way but but I don't want to hear no butts no ifs ands or buts you're doing this and that's the way Joshua had to approach them don't tell me none of your negativity don't give me none of your doubt because in my mind it's mine and I'm going many people choose to live in a valley of indecision they can't decide from one day or the other are they in or are they out am I a Christian today and and a and a hang tomorrow what am I oh church was good but my friends are good on Monday you know what I'm saying you've seen those people they're in the set indecisive they can't make their mind up they don't know if they're in or they're out and here they stand in this Valley and God brothers and sisters has offered salvation to anybody that would accept it if you ignore God's choice or God's decision his offer it's your choice it's your choice we choose I chose on a certain day that I was going to do this now has it always been a flyer and better bees now we know better than that the prophet taught us better than that it's a battle and leaders like Joshua people who will get up and preach the word of God and preach against sin and preach against writing and Ruckus and we'll tell the people where the rubber meets the road and getting those people ready that's what we need in an hour that we're living in when everything goes if you're not careful you'll find yourself in a trap that you fall in there that well everybody else right you can't worry about everybody else Joshua we'll get him across this River for just a minute I'm going to show you how he's going to get across that River Joshua he wakes up into a state of Readiness he rises up early in the morning and he's got great anticipation and he knows we're going a new direction today everything's fixing to change the life that we once knew we'll know no more we're going to have what God has had us to inherit for us for all of our days that I've been wandering through this silly Wilderness for 40 years do you ever feel like you're wandering through a Wilderness a silly Wilderness for four years thank you and Joshua comes down there and he begins to preach to the people teach the people talk to the people in Courage however you want to put it because for years the pillar of the cloud and the pillar of fire was above them and every person went from day by day by day just as an ordinary day you saw the pillar or cloud for 40 years you saw this for 40 years and a Nightfall comes for 40 years you saw the pillar of Fire if it moved you moved if it went this way you went this way but now the commission has changed now the commission has changed because now the word of God says I'm going to bring out my Ark stay with me now he says now I'm going to bring out my Ark and people must keep their eyes on this Ark and people have to keep their eyes on this Ark in a way they never have before each person now is having to take responsibility for their own life now the people have come into a place that they're going to have to have a personal relationship with God you know there's a lot there's a time in your life when you can hang around church and you can hang around friends in the church and you can go to meetings and groups and this and that but there comes a day when you have to have that personal relationship with Christ and if you haven't had it seek it foreign [Music] it held three items the first one The Ten Commandments the tablets that Moses was given the Ten Commandments are inside the Ark of the Covenant secondly it held a jar a golden jar of manna sealed up and placed in the ark and thirdly it held Aaron's budding rod Matthew Henry who writes commentaries years and years long ago probably one of the greatest preachers him and some of those other old guys that just really knew the word and dug into it the church was taught how it was fed and how it was ruled the law came down from God the Manna came down from God Aaron's budding Rod was the life of God and so now the people that they come up to this to this to this River now and they're sitting here and the instructions are very clear don't crowd the ark remember we said what was it two two thousand cubits that's about a half a mile stay a half a mile away from the ark why was that why did they have to stay a half a mile away from the ark different Scholars that disagree and they agree on different things but I liked what I said what I heard when they said they they wanted he wanted the children of Israel to be able to have to look and focus and see God in action he wanted to be able to look out there and see but yet still keep the sanctity of God you know sometimes people we get so so uh so involved around church and around God that God really doesn't hold the the sanctity that he should hold and we have to be careful with that and that's what the children of Israel had to do they had to be careful with what they were doing with the ark and Joshua tells him he says sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders amongst us clean yourselves up is what he was saying clean yourselves up live a clean life if you got dirt on you clean it up if you've got filth in your life clean it up why because God can't do miraculous things in a dirty life [Applause] foreign God always does wonders among sanctified people have you ever noticed that God can do wonders in your life when you're living the life that you should be living but the next thing you know your little sins your little lifestyle your little habits begin to come in do you see God really moving in action then no no God can't use that vessel why because that little Dove has flown off the holy spirit is has went away and said I can't I can't handle this no more so if we expect the Lord to do wonders amongst us let's clean our lives up rid ourselves of doubt and fear and unbelief then Joshua looked and I'm closing I'm not going along today and then Joshua looked and he took the Ark of the Covenant and he told him he said go gather yourselves out there sanctify yourselves against tomorrow and get ready for you'll see the glory of God and he knowed that God was with him and he took the priest and watched his next statement and he put God first he took the priest and he put God first what was our opening quote let me see if I can find that where did that go I'll get it here uh wrong page you know what I'm going any man woman housewife businessman whatever that'll put God first there's not enough Devils that can stand against him hear the children of Israel standing there and he puts the Ark in his priests in the hands of his priest and they begin to walk out through there he says brothers and sisters if you put God first in anything you do you're bound to come out right that's all I want to be that's all I want to be is right I want to put put God first in my life in my home in my business in my in my marriage and everything I do I want God first and everything is going to come out right you know when you try to do those things God will answer a little little blessings little things and and mighty ways sometimes you know we have facade business that we do with those flowers and this just comes to me so I'll share it with you we had some really nice planners okay and uh we normally get I don't know forty dollars Thirty Thirty forty dollars at the sale for these planners and so we took a bunch down there and we've always tried to pray and make sure that God is first in it and you know any any business you got any business people knows you got challenges okay and sometimes those challenges can try your patience your nerves and so we get a phone call and says hey I need you to come pick up these planters that you sold on Tuesday this was on Thursday you should come pick these planners up that you saw down here on Tuesday the guy I brought them back said they're infested with bugs I said those planners didn't have no bugs huh well he says they do he don't want you to come get them so I go down there of course you know I'm disheartened we're having a good year and here you got 30 of these things down there now and they're going to be junk and sure enough when I pull up they didn't look the best because he just threw them around and and speculating what had happened he bought more than what he should have and and decided he didn't need them all and and I had other friends of mine look at them and that grow and they said no that's that's no reason for you to take those back there's no bugs that's eating these things up you know these things are healthy they're good yes so mayor something and and he'd come back no no I ain't gonna split nothing with you okay so I'll take them back trying to keep the right attitude put them back out there start watering them inspect them trim them spray them trying to do whatever you know to make sure nothing's wrong with them a few days pass they began to perk up where he basically about destroyed them and I said well I'm gonna take them back down there so you know what we did we gather them up we took them back to the sale put our number on them sold them again let me tell you how God takes care of you the first time I sold them I think they averaged thirty dollars second time I took them dinner I think they average right at forty dollars so do you see it's the little things that God does for you that a lot of times goes unnoticed if you're not careful but if you keep God first in your business in your life and in your marriage little things that build up and says that's what makes you successful as a Christian the little things and he said everything you do keep God first they're bound to come out right and when you went to packing that Ark he said when the priest's feet rested in the water can you imagine what the scene must have been when they packing that Ark and the priest's feet rested in the water and he said at that time the god rolled back to Jordan she moved back and he stood as a pillar and Israel crossed over on dry land and built their camps let me just give you a picture of this and in our minds we think about a group of people walking across a little Gap right if you read in your Bible it says the waters went all the way back and heaped up into a town called Adam and when you look from where the Jordan Crossing was at gilgad all the way out to the to the town of Adam that's 20 miles a 20-mile span of a river that was one mile wide when the priest stepped in with God in the front the waters began to push all the way back up northward and held up and heaped up into a place called Adam brothers and sisters they didn't walk across on a ballast balance beam trying not to step in the mud they didn't walk across on a sidewalk they walked across on a 20 mile wide Highway two million people crossed the Jordan River Standing on the Promises of God let's say under our feet you know both faith and fear are contagious Joshua's Faith was contagious when we when we had baseball all my life we would I play baseball and I never was afraid to be hit by a baseball just I never was afraid but if you take a kid that ever gets hit with a baseball and comes back to the Dugout and tells everybody oh that hurts over I'm just I don't ever want to buy it again that fear becomes contagious but on the flip side of that you take somebody up there throwing 90 miles an hour and you let somebody step into the batter's box and rip one down the line and hit it as hard as they can that becomes contagious too they begin to get their confidence up and think man if he can hit that guy I can hit that guy and let me tell you if God can do for Joshua and the children of Israel what he did on that day we need to grab a hold of that get a little bit contagious about it and say I've got courage I've got strength and God's promises we will succeed amen praise the Lord let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we're thankful this morning for the word Lord for the lesson that we've had and Joshua and it's in my own life it's been such a blessing to study this word out and see the history of it but Lord you're you're not a historical God you're a God of today and whatever you did for the children of Israel 30 000 years ago you can do for us today if we have need for healing we can have healing today if we have need of deliverance we can have Deliverance today if we if we're saddened if we're lonely we can have hope we can have joy we can have peace we can have understanding that passes all and Lord Jesus it's all because you love us we're your children we're your bride we're one in a million you chose us before the foundation of the world we were predestined to be set in where we're at today it's not by circumstance it's not by happenstance we're here because God you chose us from the beginning of time and said that will be my Overcomers all the Devil May tempt us the devil may try us the devil may beat us down but we're
